Johnson GREEN BARBARISM TURNS PARADIGM The land of Zanj is vast, wrote Suleiman the Merchant. Its plants are all black in colour.1 When he gets to heaven, I don't think he'll walk through the pearly gates. He'll swing in on a grape vine. - Pat Buttram, actor, upon the death of Johnny Weismuller, January 1984. I did not know the time that I entered into a dreadful bush which is called the "Bush of Ghosts" because I was very young to understand the meaning of "bad" or "good". This "Bush of Ghosts" was so dreadful so that no superior earthly person ever entered it. - Amos Tutuola, My LiJe in the Bush of Ghosts. The following summary views of Camara Laye's The Radiance of the King (1954), of Saul Bellow's Henderson the Rain King (1959), and of Ayi Kwei Armah's Two Thousand Seasons (1979) will serve to introduce the relevant features of a certain genre, narratives of descent-into-enlightenment, which I am designating as the Safari-Quest, one in which "Africa" so predictably plays a major role. Accordingly, we note that in Laye's narrative a middle-aged Clarence, a white man and rather at loose ends, wanders through a fabulous junkyard of heady aromas heavy and seductive with dissipation and the alogical. Nonetheless, Clarence achieves, after much wandering and near-Bacchanalian experiences of excess, a transfiguring and mystical union with an exquisite chimera of a Black king. In Bellow's novel, Henderson, white and somewhat more rambunctiously at loose ends, wanders through an African landscape where meets with an odd assortment of dependents and mentors, among whom is King Dahfu, whose palace is surrounded by a vegetable and mineral junkyard. The fifty-five year old Henderson finally achieves some sort of insight which results in our last vision of this erstwhile rambunctious Yankee engaged, with lion cub and boy, in a suggestively totemic dance, "leaping, leaping, pounding, and tingling," around an equally totemic-looking airplane, and all this near the Arctic. And, finally, in one of the introductory chapters of Armah's Two Thousand Seasons, titled "The Ostentatious Cripples," we read of Arab, predator, and quest: "The predators, their first appearance among us was that of beggars. Haggard they came, betrayed and lonely in their hunger of soul and body." Soon, however, we become witnesses to an orgiastic ecstasy of appetite and satiety: "Our women gave the predators an LEMUEL A. JOHNSON is professor of English, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. overflowing measure of joy, filled them with such exquisite happiness their senses grew overloaded and pleasure kept them dumb, insensate. Outside stood the askaris, zombis kept to guard the predators, destroyers of our people."2 Read in the light of ideas culled from stereotype, cliche, or Hollywood pop-art, or, alternatively, from the seeming esoterica of Proppian taxonomy, Stith Thompson's motif- indexing or Joseph Campbell's heroic typology, Laye, Bellow, and Armah are apparently engaged with the Quest Monomyth, though with an Afrocentric orientation of that Monomyth. Unavoidably, they bring to mind other quest- inspired descent-into-hell narratives: from the watery expanse and excess of Herman Melville's Moby Dick to the "dark wood" and inferno of Dante Alighieri's Midway this way of life we're bound upon I awoke to find myself in a dark wood Where the right road was wholly lost and gone. Or else, given the wanderings of Amos Tutuola's The Palm- Wine Drinkard, with its inebriate Father of the Gods; the experiences of the child-protagonist in My Life in the Bush of Ghosts; and on down to actor Pat Buttram's version of the Christian paradise at the end of Tarzan's vine-swinging in Africa, we can further map out other geographies of descent in search of angles of ascent. Such narratives are at once convention and invention. Robert Pageard's reading of the central motif in The Radiance of the King is hardly surprising in the security of its observation that "L'idee generale n'est pas douteuse et a ete plusieurs fois indiquee par l'auteur: le sujet du roman est la quete de la grace."3 And Daniel Hughes' genealogical understanding of Henderson's ancestry is reasonably various: Henderson evokes "either directly or in parodic mode Oedipus, Moses, Joseph, Jacob, Falstaff, Lear, etc., and his entire quest has a familiar mythic pattern."4 Jung thus rightfully notes that one of the commonest dream and myth symbols of release through transcendence is the theme of the long journey or pilgrimage on which the initiate becomes acquainted with the nature of death; and geography and mythic pattern can indeed be as benign as Jung then goes on to suggest. The totemic and the mystical transfiguration that may, and which seems to, result in Laye and Bellow, is what gives to The Radiance of the King and to Henderson the Rain King their seeming closure in ritual and celebration. The counterplay of darkness and descent and light and ascent is driven, it seems, by a rather benign dialectics, the Manichean 45</page><page sequence="2">ISSUE: A JOURNAL OF AFRICANIST OPINION potential of which is not given as much free play as it is in Ayi Kwei Armah's Two Thousand Seasons. Vine-swinging in Africa thus describes, it would appear, an arc that reaches from the darkness of the "dark continent" to the whiteness of the pearly gates. Thus, descent is not really descent unto death as a last, irredeemable judgement-though the threat of annihilation is ever present. As Conrad's Marlow somewhat jauntingly, and safari-like, puts it: "The earth for us is a place to live in, where we must put up with sights, with sounds, with smells, too, by Jove!-breathe dead hippo, so to speak, and not be contaminated" in the very heart of darkness.5 We need the realities of annihilation, nonetheless, to get to the nature of the Safari-Quest. And in his inimitable way, Tutuola points the way to such narratives of "full dead persons": After I told him some of my stories in this Bush of Ghosts, then he asked this question-"Have you died before entering this bush?" I replied-"Not at all sir." But at the same moment that this reply came out of my mouth, he shouted with his loudest voice "Ah!" together with some ghosts who sat with us at that time. Then he said-"You will not be able to live with deads, of course, as you soon become a full ghost and also hear the language of ghosts, so by that time I will teach you until you will qualify to be a full dead person."6 We are not really shown any protagonists who qualify as "full dead persons" when the narratives are read as journeys that allow for release, renunciation, and atonement, presided over and fostered by some spirit of compassion. The spirit that presides over such a quest is clearly more malleable than the one, the Spirit of Empire and Race, that attends the Safari-Quest of Armah's Arab predators, Saul Bellow's excess-prone Yankee, or the peculiarly insecure arrogance of Camara Laye's European-which is all perhaps as it should be, whether one harks back to the opening years of the sixteenth century, It is often said that the Renaissance discovered man, and that the perplexities associated with the discovery were profound. But even so, the man discovered was a familiar fellow, a white European. When, at about the same time, the explorers threw the spotlight of publicity upon the backward, dark-skinned non-Europeans, when they brought home and told their stories of naked cannibals, there was something more involved than the enlargement of the European sample of the genus Horno. Here, or so it seemed, was a different kind of man. Or was he a man? There were those to say he was not,7 or else to the opening years of the twentieth century when a postulation of darkness in human form drives Conrad's Marlow to a telling incoherence, one at the very limits of word, syntax, and conceptualization: "It was unearthly, and the men were-No, were not inhuman. Well, you know, that was the worst of it-this suspicion of their not being inhuman. We would come slowly to one." Close encounters of such kinds lead to what can only be called deconstructive consequences for self and other: They howled and leaped, and spun, and made horrid faces; but what thrilled you was just the thought of their humanity-like yours-the thought of your own remote kinship with this wild and passionate uproar. (HD: 36-37) Still, the wild and passionate uproar of such centuries-old Safari-Quests in the Bush of Ghosts has ever been profitably choreographed to the "merry dance of trade and death"-as Marlow is himself fully aware. The untidiness that considerations of race and racism introduce, the tensions involved in the politics of anxiety and strain, and the predictable momentum toward Master-Slave relationships in the drive for profit and power in the bush of Ghosts all lead to particular transformations, if not to outright inversions, of the benign conclusion to which the Quest would otherwise move. It is thus of some relevance here to note how, in a quite early example, Adeimantus' orientation results, in Plato's Republic, in a mocking inversion of an erstwhile descent-into-enlightenment text: Still grander are the gifts of heaven which Musaeus and his son vouchsafe to the just; they take them down into the world below, where they have the saints lying on couches at a feast, everlastingly drunk, crowned with garlands; their ideas seem to be that an immortality of drunkenness is the highest meed of virtue.8 The Safari-Quest thus introduces and conflates ambivalent or contradictory impulses in a way that leads our concern with Laye, Bellow, and Armah past the archetypal consciousness in Jung and Campbell to the psycho-politics of excess in a Joseph Schumpeter's Imperialism and Social Classes (1951) and to the strategic punning on genealogy and cultural dependence that is so quickly signalled in the title of Valentin Mudimbe's study of the colonized consciousness, L 'Odeur du pere (the odor/ordure of the father). The Safari- Quest further invokes the brand of political and literary historiography that we find in Jonah Raskin's The Mythology of Imperialism and in the somewhat complacent mischief- making of Paul Theroux's "Tarzan is an Expatriate." Raskin thus translates the now not so mythic patterns and ideologies at work: In Victorian novels the colonies are usually places to transfer burned out characters, or from which to retrieve characters when they were needed. They are especially convenient for the beginnings, turning points and endings of fiction.9 Paul Theroux's 1967 Transition essay re-states the conventions and expectations of the Quest Monomyth with a mischievous insight that is appropriate to a pseudo-Homeric reading of Edgar Rice Burroughs in the Bush of Imperial Ghosts: We should not wonder why Tarzan came to the jungle. The reasons Tarzan had could be the same as those of any expatriate in Africa. There are five main reasons: an active curiosity in things strange; a vague premonition that Africa rewards her visitors; a disgust with the anonymity of the industrial setting; a wish to be special; and an unconscious desire to stop thinking and let the body take over. All these reasons are selfish in a degree. Mixed with them may be the desire to do a little good, to help in some way.... The wish to be special (rewarded) is dominant; the need for assertion-the passive assertion, the assertion of colour-by a man's mere presence eventually dominates the life of the expatriate. Tarzan must stand out.10 And Tarzan can, in fact, stand out with a degree of immortality that is at once comically engaging as well as culturally instructive. Thus, the following death and 46</page><page sequence="3">VOLUME XIII / 1984 resurrection of Tarzan: JUNGLE SHOUT ECHOES AT WEISMULLER FUNERAL Acapulco, Mexico-Tarzan's famous jungle shout resounded at Johnny Weismuller's funeral as the casket of the star of 18 Tarzan movies was lowered into the grave.11 TARZAN A PREPPIE? A preppie Tarzan? A 150-pound Lord of the Jungle? That happens to be exactly right where Christopher Lambert, star of "Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes," is concerned. News film critic Christopher Potter has the details on page B1.12 Still, one need not go as far as such obviously revisionist readings of myth and archetype to discern those contradictions, or ambivalences, that Tarzan's Safari-Quest in Africa seems to invite. The problem is unwittingly introduced, of all places, in Joseph Campbell's apparently egalitarian proposing of a universal taxonomy for the Quest Monomyth-and this in the very first line of The Hero With a Thousand Faces: Whether we listen with aloof amusement to the dreamlike jumbo of some red-eyed witch doctor of the Congo, read with cultivated rapture thin translations from the sonnets of the mystic Lao-Tse; now and again crack the hard nutshell of an argument of Aquinas, or catch suddenly the shining meaning of a bizarre Eskimo fairy tale: it will be always the one, shape- shifting yet marvellously constant story that we find, together with a challengingly persistent suggestion of more remaining to be experienced than will ever be known or told.13 The postulation of enlightenment at the end of Campbell's descent into the Congo is explainable by way of Jung and archetype; but that the Congo is "red-eyed" and "jumbo" in feature and speech may better be understood by way of Mudimbe, Raskin, or Theroux. At one level, Campbell's types and response are being marshalled in support of archetype and symmetry, a necessary structure upon which the "constant story" of the hero with the thousand faces depends. On the other hand, as the "natives" themselves have been known to put, "Bwana Metro makes a piksha." And it is under the influence of the Safari-Quest that the "piksha" (picture) is produced the way it is. The Safari-Quest is a genre that more unambiguously "preys on strange people and prowls in far-off places"-as Joseph Conrad puts it in the apologia that constitutes the "Author's Note" to Almayer's Folly (1895). The charter myth, as it were, behind and in the genre's descent into Africa-Avernus (Africa-Underworld) is given axiomatic form in Joyce Cary's "The attraction of Africa is that it shows these wars of beliefs, and the powerful, often subconscious motives which underlie them, in the greatest variety and also in very simple forms. Basic obsessions, which in Europe hide themselves under all sorts of decorous scientific or theological or political uniforms, are there seen naked in bold and dramatic action."14 Conrad's Marlow, finding himself in that most Victorian and imperial of places, the "heart of darkness," had been even more declarative and apocalyptic. In the "terrible frankness" and "fiendish row" of his charter myth of descent we learn that "Principles? Principles won't do. Acquisitions, clothes, pretty rag-tags that would fly off at the first good shake." (HD: 37) The Safari-Quest's Africa is one that is fashioned out of such questing and "weary pilgrimage amongst hints for nightmares" (Conrad) and profit. Sylvia Wynter has provided a comprehensive summation of the various implications, philosophical to aesthetic to libidinous, of the charter myth and its Manichean tensions: The reduction of language, the reductionism of a relationship; stereotypes confronting one another; exchange value for casual use. Africa, the psychological brother of Europe, its instant pornography. A labyrinth of presuppositions, lurid imaginings, invest Africa with the Manichean opposite of Europe's conceptual universe.15 The Manicheanism need not be so exclusively conceived: Europe contra Africa. Ayi Kwei Armah's focus on the Islamic and the Arabic Safari-Quest in Two Thousand Seasons spells out a Manichean counterpointing that is graphic in its Afro-Arab versions of "labyrinths of presuppositions" and "lurid imaginings." In its willingness to reduce the drives in the charter myth to a fierce and libidinous nakedness, Armah's narrative treats the Safari-Quest's descent in search of the profit of ascent with comico-bizarre ferocity. He thus gives us the descent, beyond and beneath principle and decorum, of Hussein, twin brother of Hassan the Syphilitic, "who had long since given up the attempt to find a way for his phallus into any woman's genitals. His tongue was always the truest pathfinder." Hussein dies a gruesomely appropriate death, with a well-honed knife in the neck: "the first woman stroked the disjointed head with affection, pressing it firmly down so the first hoarse cry from the throat came out a muffled sound of happy lechery." The assumption into paradise is as appropriate as the one that Buttram imagines for Tarzan: That devout Muslim accomplished one miracle even as he died: he swallowed the ninth date of his three circuits before he went to embrace his slave-owner god. (TTS: 35) In sum, Armah thus translates, with graphic gallows humor and exuberance, one of the reasons that Theroux proposes for Tarzan's visit to the jungle: that vague premonition that Africa rewards her visitor. It is, ironically, ominous premonition indeed that attends Armah's predatory Tarzans and their Safari-Quest: "Faisal sang that night. Laughing he sang. The words, what were they but a demented praise song to black bodies." While the promise of reward is, in Camara Laye, the exquisitely even if ambiguously asexual Black King, in Armah the reward is incarnate in Azania, "beautiful as a walking dream." The ecstasy of union and fusion could not be more dramatically contrasted between Armah and Laye. What Armah gives us is not mystical transcendence; it is, rather, a grimly ironic transfiguration of homosexual buggery and shuddering penetration: Azania took the spear and pushed it with the energy of seasons and seasons of hatred shown only as love, pushed it hard through the askari's right side, so hard it went through him into the Arab panting beneath, threading him also in his right. The two, the predator and his askari, were thus fused together when the agony of death usurped their sweeter pain. (TTS: 36-37) In a sense, this is all as it should be: the Safari-Quest being what it is-that is, a Manichean penetration through and beyond restraints in search of profit and enlightenment: "The 47</page><page sequence="4">ISSUE: A JOURNAL OF AFRICANIST OPINION land of Zanj is vast," Suleiman the Merchant had after all written. "Its plants are all black in colour." In this respect, the negroland of the Arabs is familiar territory, much like that of the European renaissance-both of them responsive to and engenderers of a seemingly comic but deconstructive rhetoric of mayhem and profit in a Bush of Ghosts, as in Yambo Ouologuem: Having depopulated whole regions, the slave trade had long been unprofitable and seeped away like water in the hungry sand. It had become difficult to find good laborers, and all in all it seemed preferable to bleed the people with all manner of taxes, direct and indirect, drive them to the utmost in the fields and workshops of the notables at a meager wage for which the Hereafter would find means to compensate them. The religious gymnastics of the five daily prayers of Islam were maintained as a safety valve; the poor in mind and spirit were kept busy searching and striving for Allah's eternal kingdom. Religion, whose soul had been vomited by the clergy of Nakem, became a mystification; losing its mystical content, it became a means of action, a political weapon. Marabouts and notables battened on it, entered into sumptuous polygamous marriages with the leading families of the day, merging their interests and thronging in pilgrimage to Mecca, the Holy City. Intelligence is a gift of the God who metes out rewards: wassalam. 16 We thereafter enter, as in the "Ecstasy and Agony" chapter of Ouologuem's Bound to Violence, into a limbo fashioned out of the Safari-Quest's discovery of how grimly and yet comically unavoidable is the Bush of Ghosts' propensity to name and to un-name, to turn signifiers back upon themselves. So ideologically and racially hallucinatory does language become. It is appropriate, then, that Camara Laye's Clarence should find himself confronted by a great number of doors which only open up to uncertainties: "All these doors were ornamented with illegible and pretentious inscriptions-at least they appeared to be pretentious ... by their great length and by their elaborately formed characters . . . they were more eloquent than if the characters had been decipherable."17 For his part, Marlow soon enough discovers that when "the bush began to howl" what he hears is at once suggestive and undecipherable: "Whether it meant war, peace, or prayer we could not tell.... The pre-historic man was cursing us, praying to us, welcoming us-who could tell?" (HD: 36) In effect, Tutuola had, it turns out, quite appropriately elaborated upon the role and the nature of language in the Bush of Ghosts, especially so in "Hopeless- town": "You must not speak any word with your mouth but with a shrug of your shoulders. Whenever you are talking to any ghost in this town you must not raise up or down your eyelids and also your mouth must not open at all. If you mistakenly or willfully break any of these warnings it would result in a severe punishment for you." (MLBG: 126) Clarence's cry, "I am not guilty!" cannot but reverberate with a certain mocking hollowness against the cumulatively "hope-less" and "name-less" effects of language in the Bush of Ghosts-that much he finds out when the doors of inscriptions close in on him. Tutuola's protagonist had, of course, made the same discovery when a passing ghost "mistakenly smashed (his) food unexpectedly with his heavy foot which had long nails of about half a foot." As a result, "I cried out louder suddenly-Oh", a quite unnatural articulation that leads him to another, and more appropriate kind, of sentence: Then he (the judge and king of Hope-less town) was asking me these questions with a shrug of his shoulders as follows: -"Who are you?" but as I did not understand what he was asking me with the shrug of the shoulders, so to set myself free from punishment I began to reply as well as with my own shrug of the shoulders as he was doing, which means to him-"you are a bastard king." And again, on the same spot that I stood before him I mistakenly raised up and down the lids of my eyes which means-"you are a fool," and this is contrary to the law of the town. Again I mistakenly opened my mouth at the same moment, and this means to them-"I shun you away." but when all the ghosts and ghostesses who stood by saw this again, all were shouting with the shrug of their shoulders in such a way that the shoulders were nearly cut off, this means-"Ah! you are abusing the king." (MLBG: 127-28) Sentence to Limbo is the right verdict when language takes so drastic and deconstructive a turn: "so the king ordered those who brought me to him to take me to the purgatory which is near the town to throw me inside it as a punishment." We thus enter, with the Safari-Quest, into language-systems in which, to borrow an assessment of Norris' in The Deconstructive Turn, there can only remain "an undertow of figural meaning which naggingly pulls against any firm assurance of the power to distinguish between 'live' (meaningful) and 'dead' (arbitrary) language-games."'8 The play of signifier and signified thus remains cancelled by and yet bound to violence; valuing, to echo Marlow, becomes pretty rag-making-rags that would fly off at the first good shake by Christian, Pagan, Heretic, or Moslem: In reality, warriors in the days of the first Saifs (Glory be to the Almighty God), had become intriguers for power: (Amen). At the death of the accursed Saif (blessed be the Eternal One!), conscious of their own need of stability (So be it!), they had flung the people into a bath of pseudo- spirituality, while enslaving them materially. (and praised.) (BV: 23) All in all, a great deal of strain is imposed upon thought and word in the effort to restore the vast land of Zanj and all its plants back to greenness, as is readily indicated by the "Hard to say No and Hard to say Yes" dilemma of the protagonist of My Life in the Bush of Ghosts-when the "Television-handed Ghostess" makes the following descent into healing proposition: "I was born over two hundred years ago with sores on my head and all over my body.... I have been to many sorcerers to know whether the sore would be healed, but every one of them was telling me that there is an earthly person who had been lost in this Bush of Ghosts, so that if I can be wandering about I might see you one day, and the sorcerers said if you will be licking the sore every day with your tongue for ten years it would be healed." (MLBG: 162) There is, in effect, an ironic and eloquent incoherence that attends the tongue's "busy-ness" in the Bush of Ghosts-be it that of Hussein's sexual expressiveness where the tongue "was the truest pathfinder," or Henderson's attempt to fix normative meanings to gift, "coat," "waterproof," and "awhonto." It is an attempt at mediating signification which makes a sexual burlesque, it seems, out of the reductive 48</page><page sequence="5">VOLUME XIII / 1984 effects of the failure of language in the Safari-Quest. I tried to get him to explain to the queen that the coat which she had now put on was waterproof, and, as he seemed unable to find a word for waterproof, I took hold of the sleeve and licked it. Misinterpreting this she (Queen) caught and licked me as well. I started to let out a shout. "No yell, sah," said Romilayu, and made it sound urgent. Whereupon I submitted, and she licked me on the ear and on the bristled cheek and then pressed my head toward her middle. (HRK: 65) Descents into Africa-Avernus are thus at once narrative conventions as well as political, racial, and psychological penetration. The Safari-Quest invariably demands a penetration that is "beyond geography" (HRK: 50). We thus move by way of charter myths into a "territory which has never been well mapped" (HRK: 43), to an "interior," an "inner station," or else into "forest" and "bush". Space soon enough collapses, under the cumulative weight of an investment in difference, adventure, and profit, into pre- history; or else into a close encounter of the sort that makes Henderson feel a jaunty release from Time and from the anthropomorphic, that is, of course, from a Euro-American anthropomorphism. He has, in effect, descended to the point where the human ceases, except, unavoidably, for the certainty of his own voice and perception. Tarzan must stand out: We came into a region like a floor surrounded by mountains. It was hot, clear, and arid and after several days we saw no human footprints. Nor were there many plants; for that matter there was not much of anything here; it was all simplified and splendid, and I felt I was entering the past-the real past, no history or junk like that. The pre-human past. (HRK: 42) Conrad's Marlow had, of course, mapped out this unmapped terrain in a somewhat more melodramatic invasion of the Bush of Ghosts: We were cut off from the comprehensions of our surroundings; we glided past like phantoms, wondering and secretly appalled. We could not understand because we were travelling in the night of first ages, of ages that are gone, leaving hardly a sign-and no memories. (HD: 36) There is, nonetheless, the memory and the fact of ivory and of cheap and disposable black labor-and all this in that merry dance of trade and death whose historical and political economy effectively counterpoints the language of fantasy in the Safari-Quest. In Laye's The Radiance of the King the penetration beyond the stricter economies of geography and race is effected by a synaesthetic cluster of images. Space and Time cancel each other as Clarence, infected by the peculiar psychopathology of a failed mission civilisatrice "safarist," falls away, and down, into an oddly numbing yet quickening sensuality: They were made aware of [the forest's] proximity by an odour which ought to be described, not merely because Clarence was especially sensitive to smells, and very curiously affected by them, but also, and above all, because this odour was particularly representative of the whole character of the South. (RK: 94) To an intensely a priori degree, I'odeur/l'ordure du pere is Bush of Ghosts. COCKS, DEEP LIPS, AND NEBUCHADNEZZARS The fact that the Safari-Quest takes place in an Other- and Underworld determines the nature of the natives. We thus enter a world and time that give birth to all sorts of prodigies, from swollen, spit-covered backsides (Radiance) to "tall Negro cowherds ... with their greased curls and their deep lips. I had never seen," Henderson adds, "men who looked so wild" (HRK: 41). Camara Laye arranges Clarence's Safari-Quest descent into such a world against a number of colonial truisms, such as that "In the Colony, the white man is boss, the black is his servant" from his A Dream of Africa. It is the failure of the tidy economy of this truism that drives Clarence to the esplanade. Behind him is the inaccessible security of such evidence of the mission civilisatrice as "spacious veranda" and "neatly arranged tables" and "swaying fans"-and black waiters in their white jackets putting bottles of wine to cool in buckets of ice. Would he ever go back there? ... No.... There was not one of those white men whom he did not owe money to, money he had lost at cards, moreover, money he had borrowed at a time when he still had hopes of getting on his feet again, and-what foolish hopes-of breaking his run of bad luck. (RK: 24-25) Camara Laye thus descends to the first of his numerous appeals to Safari-Quest situations in a tactical anthologizing of stereotype as insight and parody. For example, the immediate significance of Clarence's point of departure may be more fully appreciated by positing Theroux against the following observation from Albert Gerard's introduction to The Radiance of the King: "There's something repulsive about an American without money in his pocket," a United States official tells an impoverished compatriot stranded in Algiers in Paul Bowles' novel The Sheltering Sky. This may be a sad American truth anywhere in the world; in Black Africa, it is certainly any white man's truth, which is why it determined Camara Laye's choice of a hero. (RK: 11) Faced with this "truth" and a consequent lack of shelter, Clarence at the esplanade is nonetheless driven by his reduced circumstances to another imperative: "the need for assertion-the passive assertion, the assertion of colour-by a man's mere presence." Tarzan must stand out: "I am not 'just anybody'," replied Clarence. "I am a white man." "A white man?" said the black man. He made as if to spit, but stopped himself just in time. "Am I not a white man?" cried Clarence. "The white men do not come here, on the esplanade!" retorted the black man .... "No, this esplanade would not be the place for white men to put in an appearance," thought Clarence bitterly. "They wouldn't let themselves be shoved around by all these black men; they would more likely be sitting in their villas, where it was cool, or else playing cards and sipping iced drinks on the veranda of the hotel." (RK: 24) To appropriate a Norris proposition in The Deconstructive Turn, the Safari-Quest may thus be seen as a multiform and what originates and defines Clarence's rites of passage in the 49 tensile medium, and profit, sex, and race as the</page><page sequence="6">ISSUE: A JOURNAL OF AFRICANIST OPINION deconstructive lever which raises that tension to breaking- point. Sexualization of the deconstructive turn is consequently a necessary feature of the Manichean strategies of the Safari- Quest, that much we have seen in quite dramatic form in Armah's Arab-African confrontation. Clarence is subject to a graphic but somewhat more fantastical and narcotizing lasciviousness. He is assailed by and responsive to the "intoxication which the forest-odour caused." Unwilling and yet pre-disposed victim of a jungle erotomania, Clarence dreams the appropriate dreams and sees the appropriate visions, among them "the three fish-women (who) continued to drag themselves over the grass where their scaly robes now glimmered spectrally like robes of dying moonlight." As long as one saw them from behind, one could easily mistake them for large-sized fish; but as soon as these ambiguous creatures turned over, as soon as their dead white breasts flashed their gleaming scales beneath the moon's sepulchral light, one though at once of women, one could not help thinking at once of women.... Could it be that the fish- women had hands? He could not remember having seen hands. They had just breasts; he could distinctly remember those breasts, not the hands. Yet they were really hands that were fumbling him all over. (RK: 119-201) At the nadir, at the bottom-most circle of this descent, Laye offers us a clear deprivation of high conduct, a stultifying lasciviousness which rides, ironically, on the pornography of racial stereotype to present, as will Bellow, white Nebuchadnezzar as Stud: the great white hunter turned phallic beast and bursting with hot seed. The odor/ordure of the father now translates into assimilationist (mutation- spawning) sexual activity in which Clarence, as buffoon fertility god, copulates with nameless black women-all this through the queerly undecipherable agency of the Naba to whom he has been sold. Voluntarily and involuntarily Clarence engenders a race of half-castes: "little half-caste brats in the courtyard of the harem didn't just drop from the clouds." He learns that every night he had been with someone different, "like two snails out on a filthy crawl." Clarence's conscience is pricked; but what Laye intends is an inflation and collapsing of sexual cliches about blackness upon Clarence. Additionally, of course, the Safari-Quest invariably demands climactic or orgasmic suggestions of "unspeakable rites"-and such rites have to do with the appetite gone wrong, be it cannibalism or copulation ("the unthinkable fire stirring in the loins"). Laye "celebrates," appropriately, that conventional expectation. But because he is bent on anthology and inversion, what we get is that outburst of invectives with which the Master of Ceremonies makes cocksure that the inversion of sexual stereotypes has taken place: "A cock! That's all you are, a great cock! ... It was for a cock the beggar sold you to the Naba, and it is as a cock you've behaved." "He sold me?" said Clarence incredulously. "Yes, sold you! Bartered you, if you like. Bartered you for an ass and a woman past her first youth.... Perhaps you didn't know that you are no longer your own master, that you belong body and soul to the Naba; well, now you know: you know that even if you wanted to serve the king, you could not possibly do so ... what would the king want with a cock? ... Can you imagine the Naba saying, 'this is my cock?' . . . Or, 'I should like you to meet my cock?' ... Oh, you may count yourself fortunate that such things will never be said about you in the king's presence!" "A cock . . ." said Clarence in a wretched voice. "A cock is not worthy to appear in front of the king," said the master of ceremonies. "A great cock like you." (RK: 239) The Safari-Quest is thus a depiction of "ignoble fumblings and penetrations." And what Marvin Mudrick conceives of as the problem in such narratives, "to persuade the reader-by epithets, exclamations, ironies, by every technical obliquiry-into an hallucinated awareness of ... unplummable depravity (and of) primal unanalyzable evil," is no real problem at all-when once the charter myth of descent and its Manichean postulates are engaged, either as legitimization or as parody.'9 Armah's Azania, "beautiful as a walking dream," inflicts full and melodramatic violence on the great Arab hunter-that much we have already seen in the blood-soaked ecstasy by and through which Faisal becomes a "full dead person." Camara Laye's hallucinatory Aziana is the inner station in the geography of The Radiance of the King; it is, accordingly, the subjective and objective extension of Clarence's obsession with sexual degradation and revulsion, as well as with his claims and politics of race and privilege. In either case, Laye is graphic in his depiction of the temptation to moral and spiritual annihilation. And this time, it is Dioki, nightmarish as a walking dream, who incarnates that invitation to be a full dead person in the Bush of Ghosts: She was rolling in the dust, among the serpents and these were hissing and rolling themselves around her body. They were embracing, enfolding her: and she-she was crying out. But what sort of embrace was this? Clarence could hardly believe what he saw. These were the passionate convulsions of love itself!. .. Had he to watch this display to the very end, this lascivious spectacle of an old woman whose writhings were obviously related to the lustful jerkings of physical passion?... He closed his eyes. But then he seemed to see even more clearly the old woman and the serpents; he could see with utmost distinctness their ignoble fumblings and penetrations; he could hear even more plainly the sighs and groanings of the old woman's ecstasy, the hissings and slitherings of the serpents. (RK: 221-22) Clarence will, however, breathe dead hippo and live because Laye has sent him off on a pilgrimage, a penetration into the Bush of Ghosts, that is, fortunately, not presided over or attended by the likes of Faisal, Hussein, or Hassan the Syphilitic and their slave-owning god; or the likes of "the short ghosts and their Flash-eyed Mother," the ruler and the only woman of that thirteenth town in Tutuola's Bush of Ghosts. For the fact of the matter is that "all the short ghosts of this 13th town were not doing other work more than to go to bush to hunt for bush animals, to kill them and to bring them to the 'flash-eyed mother' who is their ruler." (MLBG: 96) The radiance of the king, the spirit of redemptive compassion who presides over the Safari-Quest in Laye's narrative, is of an altogether different kind-in spite of the delicate edge of eroticized interest with which the King's slender black torso is apprehended: 50</page><page sequence="7">VOLUME XIII / 1984 It was his fragility that was most striking; it was even more striking than his youth, and painfully so. One wondered how the king, such a slender boy, could bear the weight of all those bracelets, why his arms were not broken by such a load.... He was so extraordinarily frail that he seemed utterly defenseless-yes, defenseless, in spite of his innumerable pages and drummers and trumpeters, in spite of the superb warriors who had ridden so proudly before him, in spite of the reverence of the immense crowd that stood all around him. (RK: 32-33) The need for benign closure in Laye's Bush of Ghosts thus results in the conjuring up of an exquisitely redemptive chimera, in virtual defiance, it would seem, of "short ghosts" and "dead hippo." But even if ineffable and sudden, the radiance of this king is also another way of incarnating what Theroux has referred to as "that vague premonition that Africa somehow rewards her visitors." The descent into Africa is, after all, an intimation of some prior calculation of potential loss and profit, a cost-benefit enterprise at the end of which gleams black gold or white ivory, emporium or empire. In Vergil's Aeneid, for example, Aeneas' descent into an underworld Bush of Ghosts is inextricably linked ("veni, vidi, vinci," after all) to a "colonizing" of the netherworld as a prelude to august ascension: In Vergil's poem, Aeneas' descent is part of this initiation for the role of leader of the Roman people. Vergil emphasizes the fact the truth is to be found in the heart of darkness; thus, the Sybil who, in Vergil's words, "obscuris vera involvens" (hides truth in darkness) guides Aeneas. Moreover, just as Aeneas is about to enter Hades Vergil interrupts his narrative to ask the very elements of hell, Chaos and Phlegeton to allow him to reveal secrets buried in the darkness and depths of the earth.20 Or, as Clarence thinks the proposition through in Laye's special modulation of the motif: "Yes, it seemed that it might be possible to love this frail adolescent, yes, it would be possible, despite the pitch-black night of his skin .... But why 'despite the pitch-black night of this skin'?" (RK: 33) Still, Camara Laye, again as anthologist and inverter of Safari-Quest forms and themes, does move the tradition's Manicheanism into a lyrical epiphany and into a sensuous but transcendent consummation of desires. The Bush of Ghosts' deconstructive turn, with its insistent play on profane ambiguities, is resolved as romance and icon: great white hunter becomes great white seeker, and finder, at the very heart of darkness: When (Clarence) had come before the king, when he stood in the great radiance of the king, still ravaged by the tongue of fire, but alive still, and living only though the touch of that fire. Clarence fell upon his knees, for it seemed to him that he was finally at the end of his seeking, and at the end of all seekings. But presumably he had still not come quite near enough; probably he was still too timid, for the king opened his arms to him. And as he opened his arms, his mantle fell away from him, and revealed his slender adolescent torso. On this torso, in the midnight of this slender body there appeared-at the centre, but not quite at the centre ... a little to the right-there appeared a faint beating that was making the flesh tremble. It was this beating, this faintly-beating pulse which was calling! It was this fire that sent its tongue of flame into his limbs, and this radiance that blazed upon him. It was this love that enveloped him. "Did you not know that I was waiting for you?" asked the king, and Clarence placed his lips upon the faint and yet tremendous beating of that heart. Then the king slowly closed his arms around him, and his great mantle swept about him, and enveloped him for ever. (RK: 253) This "enveloping" of Clarence in Aziana, given the ultimately benign nature of Laye's pilgrimage to the Bush of Ghosts, contrasts sharply with that fatal orgasm which Faisal experiences with and through Azania in Two Thousand Seasons. On the other hand, it more closely anticipates Bellow's Yankee totemic dance and transfiguration after his visit to a Bush of Ghosts where "The African cows do not look like our own" (HRK: 47). THE YANKEE AS ABIKU Although "at a height of three miles, sitting above the cloud," Henderson felt like an "airborne seed," his descent into, indeed, upon the Bush of Ghosts is, characteristically, a "disorderly rush." The disorderliness is, of course, hardly to be wondered at: our great white protagonist from Connecticut moves in the gung-ho and baroque fullness of his lineage and self-portraiture: I came, a great weight, a huge shadow on those stairs, with my face full of country color and booze, and yellow pigskin gloves on my hands, and a ceaseless voice in my heart that said, I want, I want, oh, I want-yes, go on, I said to myself, Strike, strike, strike! And I kept going on the staircase in my thick padded coat, in pigskin gloves and pigskin shoes, a pigskin wallet in my pocket, seething with lust and seething with trouble. (HRK: 14) For Herbert Gold, "it is an actual Henderson, rambling about in his dirty jockey shorts, who becomes a genuine rain king. Comic and pathetic, very slippery, he is a regular American guy resisting godliness."2' True enough, perhaps, though this "regular American guy" does descend into the Bush of Ghosts with a certain disposition, the implications of which are evident in a Leslie Fiedler dictum that George Stade cites-quite properly-in a review of Fiedler's Freaks: "Ask any American for his attitude toward Indian and Negro, and you will discover his attitude toward his own impulsive life." Ask anyone for his attitude toward freaks, Stade goes on to postulate, "and you will get a shudder and a titter, symptoms of primal terrors and monstrous longings, evidences of what we fear we desire, subterranean shocks of recognition."22 Henderson is thus not discontinuous with his civilization in significant enough ways; Hughes is clever and right, though in perhaps too benign a formulation: Almost, one might say, he acts out in something between pantomime and allegory, a whole chapter in the history of Western sensibility. He is a semi-burlesque synthesis of the great questing, exploring, yearning aspirants of the Western imagination-Ahab crossed with Tarzan.23 As Henderson himself says, in a manner which links him to that great Euro-American diaspora whose "ultimates" and whose "nirvana" are bound up with "chillen dankness," "I can swear to you, Romilayu, there are guys exactly like me in India and in China and South America and all over the place" (HRK: 233). 51</page><page sequence="8">ISSUE: A JOURNAL OF AFRICANIST OPINION When Tutuola's child-protagonist descends into the Bush of Ghosts he does so in the turbulence of "many kinds of African wars and some of them are as follows: general wars, tribal wars, burglary wars and the slave wars which were very common" (MLBG: 17-18). Henderson's descent into his Bush of Ghosts is a relevant regression to both the Manichean and the infantile. His Safari-Quest has its private origins in his daughter's black baby, and its public origins in certain of Euro-America's attitudes to "negro" that are traceable back to plantation and slave culture. Henderson descends burdened by the ambiguous paternity of Ricey's baby, by the "infant squalling" that he had once heard coming all afternoon by way of the air ducts. Quietly I opened the closet door and saw the infant sleeping on the chemises and stockings in Ricey's valise, for she had not finished unpacking. It was a colored child, and made a solemn impression on me. The little fists were drawn up on either side of its broad head. About the middle was a fat diaper made of a Turkish towel. And I stooped over it in the red robe and Wellingtons, my face flaming so that my head itched under the wool cap. (HRK: 34) Clarence has descended as he did, in the desperate contradictions of mission civilisatrice failure and jungle fever and erotomania; Faisal, in a manner not discontinuous with his brand of orientalism, descends to sing his fateful "but demented praise song to black bodies." Eugene Henderson of Connecticut is moved to sing his improbable love song to the quivering fleshiness of Mtalba in Arnewi in a manner that clearly demonstrates the "solemn impression" which Ricey's closet baby had made. Mtalba, "the younger sister of Bittahness," was all gussied up, for at such a weight a woman can't go without the support of clothes. Her hands were dyed with henna and her hair stood stiffly with indigo; she looked like a very happy and pampered person, the baby of the family perhaps, and she shone and sparkled with fat and moisture and her flesh was puckered or flowered like a regular brocade. (HRK: 65) Mtalba thus becomes a colored Baby-Woman because there are special Abiku ("born and die baby") indications that Henderson fears what he desires, and that the subterranean shocks of recognition in Arnewi have their epicenters in a house closet in Chicago as well as in the Big Houses of New World plantations: Mtalba, with her lips shut, but the rest of her face expanded to a remarkable extent with happiness and her little henna-dipped hands with puckered wrists at rest on her lips, was looking into my eyes meltingly. (HRK: 75) Infantile regression, and haunting, are thus stages in Henderson's later benign even if potentially buffoon apotheosis. The great white hunter is himself hunted in the Bush of Ghosts by fated and fateful cycles; he is haunted by and into becoming Abiku, the spirit child. As the "At a Ghost Mother's Birthday Function" chapter of My Life in the Bush of Ghosts puts it: if you do not believe this story if a "born and die" baby dies from a woman, after he is buried, watch the grave in which he is buried and after the second day try and go to that grave and dig it out; you would be very surprised that he would not be found there any more, but he has e c e come back.... (p. 55) This, then, we are told, is the secret, of "born and die babies," of "the meaning of 'I am and I am not'," for born and die babies "are feeding on anything that earthly people have." (p. 55) There is, accordingly, much that is entirely appropriate as Henderson the Man-Child descends into the Bush of Ghosts: So what I thought was something like this: The world may be strange to a child, but he does not fear it the way a man fears. He marvels at it. But the grown man mainly dreads it. And why? Because of death. So he arranges to have himself abducted like a child. So what happens will not be his fault. And who is this kidnapper-this gipsy? It is the strangeness of life-a thing that makes death remote, as in childhood.... Thus I sat while Willatale, the woman of Bittahness, queen of Arnewi, softly shook her head; perhaps admiringly. Mtalba's face gleamed with a similar expression and her forehead began to fold softly upward toward the stiffly standing indigo hair. (HRK: 74) This regression to Aunt Jemimah and Slave Mammy, to nurse and foster mother, is as it should be here: a reasonable enough form for that vague premonition, that Africa somehow rewards her visitors, to take. Henderson had, after all, penetrated beyond and through time to "short pants" years; he had taken appropriate stock of Charlie and of himself: "Was this the kid I used to know in dancing class? How time had changed us both. But we are now, as then, in short pants." (pp. 40-41). It is to Willatale, queen and Mammy ("Her head was white and her face broad and solid") that the Man-Child turns for the formula grun-tu- molani, for "Man Want to Live." And although Henderson believes he had entered "the past-the real past, no history or junk like that. The pre-human past," his descent in search of an angle of ascent is, of course, not all that "simplified and splendid." The fact is that he had emerged from a closet only to descent, in a quite appropriate manner, into a "regular bargain basement of deformities"; and there he demonstrates that his soul is, indeed, "like a pawn shop ... filled with unredeemed pleasures, old clarinets, and cameras, and moth-eaten fur" (HRK: 71). It is with old, unredeemed cameras that Bwana Henderson is constrained to "make a piksha" of his Safari-Quest. Faisal on Azania, Clarence in Aziana, and Henderson "inside" Willatale all present us with appropriately instructive closures in the Bush of Ghosts. It is the "special mark of the old lady's favor" and fate in Henderson the Rain King that Henderson should play the role of foster spirit child and she that of the Big House Mammy whose sex, womb, and maternity are, once again, on loan; making her truly the woman of "bittahness": Itelo protruded his lips to show I was to kiss her on the belly. To dry my mouth first, I swallowed.... Then I kissed, giving a shiver at the heat I encountered. The knot on the lion's skin was pushed aside by my face, which sank inward. I was aware of the old lady's navel and her internal organs as they made sounds of submergence. I felt as though I were riding in a balloon above the Spice Islands, soaring in hot clouds while exotic odors arose from below (p. 65). Given such a translation and assumption into I'odeur de la mere, there is much that is quite understandable in the infantile megalomania with which the Yankee Man-Child 52</page><page sequence="9">VOLUME XIII / 1984 expresses his needs: Henderson "had a voice that said, I want!" (p. 241) or, alternatively, "King me!" As in Laye, a spirit of compassion presides, nonetheless, over the descent into the Bush of Ghosts in Henderson the Rain King. In other circumstances, such as in Armah, it is less embraceable foster mothers and chimeras who respond to "man want to live" invasions and Safari-Quests. Indeed, the attendant imagery can be quite spectacular in its deconstruction of Mammy and Aunt Jemimah, and of those representations of romance and seduction that make Faisal and Hussein move as they think themselves moved. In the 13th town of the Bush of Ghosts, They could not move about or from the body of their mother to another place. Their mother had a special long and huge head which she was using to talk and to feed herself, it was above everything in the town and it showed her out from a distance of about four miles from this town. She had a large mouth which could swallow an elephant uncut. The two fearful large eyes which were on the front of her head were always flashing or bringing out fire whenever she was opening them, and this is why all the rest ghosts and ghostesses with all other creatures gave her the name of "flash-eyed mother." There were over a thousand thick teeth in this mouth, each was about two feet long and brown in colour, both upper and lower lips were unable to cover the teeth. The hair on her head was just bush, all could weigh more than a ton if cut and put on a scale, each was thicker than a quarter of an inch and almost covered her head, except the face. All these hairs were giving shelter to her whenever it was raining and whenever the sun was scorching her as she was not walking to anywhere. Both her hands were used in stirring soup on the fire like spoons as she did not feel the pain of fire or heat, her finger nails were just like shovels and she had two very short feet under her body, she sat on them as a stool, these feet were as thick as a pillar. She never bathed at all. (MLBG: 99) Contrastively, there is a cockeyed pathos to the "flash-eyed mother" that Henderson needs and conjures up in the Bush of Ghosts: Look how happy she was, grinning with her flat nose and gap teeth, the mother-of-pearl eye and the good eye, and look at her white head! (HRK: 69-70) A threatening disintegration of personality, a descent to the bottom which would effectively resist any exalting into design-these are, of course, requisite stages in the Safari- Quest, as Clarence and Dioki serve to illustrate. And Henderson does not, indeed, cannot, move to the ecstatic and totemic celebration that ends his Safari-Quest before experiencing the nadir of a threatened bestiality, one that is resonant with the unspeakable rites of the appetite gone wrong: It remains to be recorded that I was once more fatally embroiled with animals, according to the prophecy of Daniel which I had never been able to shake off-"They shall drive you from among men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field." (HRK: 78) Vine-swinging in the Bush of Ghosts does not, however, make Henderson forget Zion, make his tongue cleave in annihilatory silence to the roof of his mouth. His exile is thus temporary; a breathing of dead hippo, the effluvia of which does not contaminate in perpetuity: "I had claws, and hair, and some teeth, and I was bursting forth with hot noise, but when all this had come forth, there was still a remainder. That last thing of all was my human longing." This, all the ignoble fumblings and penetrations, all those vast acts of carelessness and profit in the disposable lands and among the disposable creatures that make up the Bush of Ghosts, are finally resolved in that Arctic ecstasy of abandonment and reconciliation which ends Henderson the Rain King: I told the kid, "inhale. Your face is too white from your orphans troubles. Breathe in this air, kid, and get a little color ...." And the lion? He was in it, too. Laps and laps I galloped around the shining and riveted body of the plane, behind the fuel trucks. Dark faces were looking from within. The great beautiful propellers were still, all four of them. I guess I felt it was my turn to move, and so went running, leaping, leaping, pounding, and tingling over the pure white lining of the gray Arctic silence. (p. 286) Henderson is thus transfigured in his Arctic epiphany; he has gone from being haunted Bwana to the Henderson-Sungo called for by "red-eyed" (naturally) King Dahfu, he of the hunting and eclectic metaphysics of transcendence by surrender: "Roar, roar, roar, Henderson-Sungo. Do not be afraid. Let go of yourself. Snarl greatly. Feel the lion.... Be the beast! You will recover humanity later, but for the moment, be it utterly" (HRK: 225). Bellow's Yankee Abiku is thus saved from the fate that is visited upon, and from the pure dark line that is inscribed on "born and die" babies when things really fall apart in the Bush of Ghosts: He brought out a sharp razor from the goatskin bag slung from his left shoulder and began to mutilate the child. Then he took it away to bury in the Evil Forest, holding it by the ankle and dragging it on the ground behind him. After such treatment it would think twice before coming again, unless it was one of the stubborn ones who returned, carrying the stamp of their mutilation-a missing finger or perhaps a dark line where the medicine man's razor had cut them.24 CONCLUSION: THE FUTURE-SIGN TREE Twenty-four years after he first entered the Bush of Ghosts, at age seven, Tutuola's protagonist finds himself under the fruit tree which is near his tome town (the Future-Sign). It is fitting that the sign should incorporate the divergent tendencies of the Bush of Ghosts-what impels towards it and that which points to an exit. The Future-Sign Tree can thus be seen as the fulcrum, as the meeting point, in ambiguity, of the Manicheanism of the Safari-Quest; as, perhaps, the tree from which the arc of Tarzan's flights, from the bush of Paradise, are measured. "It was under this fruit tree my brother left me on the road when he was running away from the enemies guns which were driving me father and farther until I entered the Bush of Ghosts, and it was the fruit of this tree I ate first immediately I entered the Bush of Ghosts" (p. 106). The fruit itself may then be seen as the "magnetic juju" which, temptingly, conjures up and also exorcises the twenty towns of the Bush of Ghosts, from the economies of Lost or Gain Valley ("All our dresses cost more than 100") to the pre-history of Nameless-town. In their strikingly similar yet dissimilar ways, Laye, Bellow, and Armah have responded to the narrative and ideological consequences of the proposition, from Sir Thomas 53</page><page sequence="10">ISSUE: A JOURNAL OF AFRICANIST OPINION Browne and every other mother's son, that "There is all Africa and her prodigies in us." In Two Thousand Seasons, Henderson the Rain King, and The Radiance of the King, the Quest Monomyth becomes the Safari-Quest, with power not unlike what Tutuola has designated "Invisible Massive Magnetic Juju which could bring a lost person back to him from an unknown place, how far it may be" (p. 154). There are, of course, those deadlier than mere fantasy impulses that provide form, content, and ideology to the Safari-Quest and to the attendant search for a way out of the Bush of Ghosts. Armah is predictably graphic when the illustration comes from him; vine-swinging in the bush of Ghosts is, he helps us conclude, bruta facta turned into fantasies of "long and tiring seasons spent journeying through high forests": Ah, you will know. Two thousand seasons, a thousand going into it, a second thousand crawling maimed from it, will teach you everything about enslavement, the destruction of souls, the killings of bodies, the infusion of violence into every breath, every drop, every morsel of your sustaining air, your water, your food. Till you come again upon the way. (TTS: 26-27). NOTES 1. See also William D. Cooley, The Negroland of the Arabs (London: Frank Cass and Co., 1966).
