<plain_text><page sequence="1">170 Vol. 15, No. 2 METAMORPHOSIS IN ABE KOBO'S WORKS Fumiko Yamamoto I often invite non-existent beings onto the stage in order clearly to apprehend reality. The realm where ghosts live lies beyond the constricting walls of stereotypes. Ghosts are diaphanous, and if we gaze at them we should be able to penetrate through the thick crust of daily platitudes and look direct- ly into the heart of reality.1 Thus Abe Kobo (1924- ), a contemporary Japanese writer, explains how he employs fantastic elements in his works in order to expose and destroy the stereo- typed "balance of reason and sense"2 which supports the complacent state induced by our daily routines. In casting the light of fantasy over our daily platitudes, he gives life to hypothetical situations and makes these platitudes "lose their balance and appear ab- normal."3 Only when we are confronted with this con- cretization of fantasy in an exaggerated form do we as readers see the distortion and perversion of our milieu and the degraded human image within it. The physical transformation of man into some other form plays a major role in Abe's early works, written from 1950 to 1955. Although every human body undergoes marked physiological changes as it becomes older, the underlying conception of the essential structure of the body does not alter, and this re- sults in a concrete sense of reality and a secure feeling of universality. When this human form grad- ually dissolves into something else, the victim helplessly confronts an overwhelming power before which everything is vulnerable. As a result, assumptions about humanity itself are brought into question and a different kind of reality emerges. Abe's metamorphosis aims at this very effect of JOURNAL OF THE</page><page sequence="2">ASSOCIATION OF TEACHERS OF JAPANESE shaking the mundane sense of security engendered by day-to-day routines. In these works of Abe Kobo, as in many modern transformational stories, such as Franz Kafka's Metamorphosis or Eugene lonesco's Rhinoceros, the power of metamorphosis creeps into the daily lives of ordinary people. Most of Abe's heroes are name- less, or have names which are strangely deprived of individuality: one hero is called Mr. S. Karuma (Karma) and another is referred to as Komon-kun (Common?). Everyone else is simply called "man" or "woman" and lives in nameless large cities. Abe assumes there are two types of social environments: a farming village where people are united by a neighborly spirit, and a city where industrial development sets people apart. His interest lies with the urban group and the images of lonely people congregating in large cities. Abe speculates as follows: A person in a big city is like a perpetual traveller. Having only very occasional con- tact with the outside world, he cannot help being blown away like a ping-pong ball on water.... The irritation he feels does not come from external conditions such as defects in the city's plan... or traffic jams, but rather from the frustration caused by compli- cated and abnormal human relationships.... People are lonely--given their mistrust and isolation they have turned into veritable crustaceans.5 Industry and the business world compartmentalize human life and thus not only deprive the individual of human contacts but also offer little sense of fulfill- ment or self-identity. A character in "The City under Water" (Suichu toshi) (1952) complains, for example: 171</page><page sequence="3">172 Vol. 15, No. 2 I wonder what on earth I am doing at the com- pany.... I am in this kind of state because the rationale is not in the work itself but in the capitalistic system. In order for capital- ism to be complete... our reality has been shat- tered into inorganic fragments. I started thinking recently that it may be a mistake to consider reality continuous. I often ask myself, "How are you feeling?" And I look hard for an answer. Then I try an answer, "I think I am bored." But as soon as I say it, the word "bored" becomes a hard substance like a pebble and it chokes my throat. I spit it out into my hand, roll it, pick it up and try to hold it to the light. I start feeling strange. What kind of relationship is there between this word and real ity?6 As these words indicate, Abe's character, alien- ated from his own emotions, is beginning the process of self-disintegration. His hero in "For the Nameless Night" (Na mo naki yoru no tame ni) (1948) feels un- easy, as if the town where he lives is sinking into unknown depths. He worries that perhaps in the deep, "the verb 'to exist' appears as a noun in dictionar- ies before people are aware of it."7 Abe's metamor- phosis is a depiction of the common man's loss of initiative, a loss leading him to the immobile existence of a noun. As a basis for this metamorphosis, Abe begins with man's cognition of reality. To illustrate man's "human" condition, Abe refers to the case of a wolf boy found in eighteenth-century France. The boy starts the process of acculturation by taking a luke- warm bath which helps him recognize his skin's sensi- tivity; from this Abe concludes that human nature is not spiritual, is not innate, but rather has its roots in our physiological perception of the outside world. Human nature, he adds, is also socially cultivated. He claims that man is after all "a Social Corporeality."9 Man's inside reality is his own reflection of outside JOURNAL OF THE</page><page sequence="4">ASSOCIATION OF TEACHERS OF JAPANESE reality, although in daily routines he seldom differ- entiates one from the other. As long as the outside world is stable, man believes that his daily routine (nichijo-sei) is continuous, and he comfortably trusts his inner reality to be a correct reflection of the outside. Abe notices, however, "that when man's life becomes complicated and distressing, man's conscious- ness can no longer rely on this common sense which is thebalance between man's internal and external worlds in his daily routine."10 If the balance is severely shaken by an unusual incident or strain, man's organ- ism often regresses temporarily into a primitive stage. The regression does not involve just the physical system but takes place within the structure of consciousness. In a time of crisis, Abe says, "the deeper consciousness, which is something in- stinctive, comes to the surface and attempts to take over the whole consciousness."11 In general, Abe's metamorphoses of man are the concretizations of the processes whereby man's inner self literally changes his outer form into a figure which is regarded as sub-human or a-human. In his conversation with Haryi Ichir6 in 1956, Abe talks about his experience in Manchuria after the end of World War II. Observing that the social norm was utterly shattered, Abe completely lost his faith in an immutable existence and, instead, developed a materialistic perception of reality. Abe says that at this juncture he received a methodological clue for his works from the surrealism which was popular in Japan. He learned from it a technique by which he could "subordinate consciousness to an object (taishO) and by using objects create the process of collapse which takes place in man's consciousness."'2 Abe wanted "to peel off the veil of concept (kannen) from various phenomena"13 so that these phenomena could be seen as they were. The literal expression of his attempt was materialized in "Dendrocacalia" (Dendorokakariya) in 1949, the first of his short stories on metamorphoses written in the early 1950s. 173</page><page sequence="5">174 Vol. 15, No. 2 Abe's metamorphosis stories can be divided into two groups according to the effects of the transforma- tion on the hero. In one group which includes such stories as "The Flood" (KOzui) (1950), "The Magical Chalk" (Mahl no chDku) (1950), and "The Life of a Poet" (Shijin no shogai) (1951), transformation be- comes an active force allowing man to start a new life style. In the second group, which contains such works as "Dendrocacalia," "A Red Cocoon" (Akai mayu) (1950), The Wall--Mr. S. Karuma's Crime (Kabe-- S. Karuma-shi no hanzai) (1951), and "A Stick" (Bc) (1955), transformation emerges as a negative force which is destructive of the human psyche. It is on this second group, which bears a significant rela- tionship to his later works, that I shall concen- trate in this paper.l4 "Dendrocacalia" is a prototype of Abe's negative transformation stgies in which he experiments with "dissecting man." Komon-kun, the hero of "Dendro- cacalia," one day discovers that his feet are changing into the stalk of a plant. The attack lasts for only a moment, and he almost forgets the incident until he receives a letter a year later. The letter, bearing the signature of K, asks him to meet K at a coffee house. In his speculation about K, Komon-kun falls into a self-induced hypnosis and wonders if K is his sweetheart whom he does not remember. While he is waiting for K at the coffee house, he has his second attack. His face begins to turn inside-out, but his still human hands hastily grab it and turn it back again. The attack is over. Komon-kun notices that a strange looking man has been watching his attack. In fear he flees outside where he suffers a third attack in a vacant lot. This times his hands have difficulty grabbing the wiggling face in order to turn it right side out. He almost gives up when the man whom he has seen in the coffee house appears and tries to pluck Komon-kun whose body has almost com- pletely turned into a plant. The man accidentally dislodges Komon-kun's face which then returns to its normal position. Komon-kun barely makes his escape from the man. JOURNAL OF THE</page><page sequence="6">ASSOCIATION OF TEACHERS OF JAPANESE A few days later, Komon-kun receives a letter which is addressed to "Mr. Dendrocacalia Crepidifolia." The letter is signed, "From K., Botanical Garden Superintendent." Now he knows that K is the same per- son who sent the first letter and who also tried to pick him in the vacant lot. K appears in person that evening and promises that Komon-kun will be comfort- able and will be well taken care of in K's garden if he cares to move there. Komon-kun drives him out, but K swears that he will follow Komon-kun everywhere lest the transformed Komon-kun be plucked by someone else. One morning Komon-kun decides to attack K, and to set other transformed men free from their captivity in the garden. However, once he reaches the garden, he realizes that he is powerless to do anything alone. Yielding apathetically to the superintendent's sugges- tion that the garden is ready for his entry, Komon-kun gives up his human body and transforms himself into the plant. With glee, the superintendent securely pins a label on his stem, which identifies him as "Dendrocacalia Crepidifolia." Abe, who once intended to be a doctor and gradu- ated from the medical school at Tokyo University, manifests his early interest in describing the col- lapse of man's consciousness by tracing the psycho- pathological process of self-disintegration in "Den- drocacalia." A common symptom of mental derangement is disorientation to time and space. Komon-kun experiences this sensation while waiting at the cof- fee house, and wishes his "consciousness could keep pace with the movement of the outside world, then any movement would be transfixed into a stationary posi- tion. But, no, things are all going wrong. All the outside movements only leave obscure traces in the consciousness which can't catch up with them.'16 He feels dizzy, losing his secure perspective. His sense of space is also distorted. Objects lose their shape and "melt into a layer of strong light" (Den., 15). In his first attack, he feels as if he is being pulled away to somewhere else, and wonders if his 175</page><page sequence="7">176 Vol. 15, No. 2 "heart is this empty" (Den., 8). His emptiness needs to be filled with something from outside. On the sec- ond attack, he looks up at the sky and the sky flows into his eyes. The heavy sky fills his whole body and his entrails are forced out- side of his body. He senses someone loitering on his face... he looks to find who this can be... it is no other than himself. His own face is reflected in the dark. The earth is rumbling. He feels the comfortable feeling of saturation: the attack has started. (Den., 15-16) Man's mental activity, which consists of a rational faculty and a sensory faculty, has "its direction and meaning [only when it is understood] in its relation to man's action."17 Komon-kun loses this tie between his consciousness and his physical actions. He kicks a pebble and worries about why he did it. While he is wondering, his other foot kicks it as if it acts of its own accord. When he is going through these attacks, Komon-kun feels that his face wants to turn inside out while his hands want to turn the face back. The hands not only try to grip the face, they seem to want to do various things without his consent. While looking absentmindedly at a knife on the ground, "his hands all of a sudden picked it up and put it into his pocket... Even his legs... started running effort- lessly" (Den., 20). Komon-kun feels that all these actions are taking place outside his consciousness, and he does not particularly care how things are going. Komon-kun cannot control his bodily functions. He, at the same time, develops a sense of perception which is translated into physical terms. After he finishes reading the first letter, he holds it securely between his two palms. He feels that his palms turn into eyes, ears, nose, and mouth and fin- ally melt into the letter. When K appears as a threatening figure and glares at Komon-kun, he feels as if "he has a loose hinge in his neck, which al- lows his head to fold over, so that his eyeballs are sticking to his heart" (Den., 12). When he is JOURNAL OF THE</page><page sequence="8">ASSOCIATION OF TEACHERS OF JAPANESE in agony, waiting, Komon-kun senses that "time is slip- ping through his fingers like sand" (Den., 13.) What Komon-kun goes through in his sensations seems to be the reverse of the experience of the wolf boy. Through sharpening his sensory perceptions, the boy develops his humanness which connects his inner consciousness with outside stimuli and makes him a socialized being. His relationship to the outside world is opened up through corporeal channels. Komon-kun, on the other hand, draws the outside stimuli into himself. Exter- nal and internal agitations are translated into physi- cal terms and consequently they become personal and oppressive to him. When he feels physically surrounded by these pressures, his only defense is to form a se- cure world of his own. His withdrawal into himself is completed by his act of transformation into a plant. K in the story explains that "plants and animals are different not in quality but in quantity.... Sci- entifically, plants and animals are the same. Isn't it wonderful? It is a cognition which is extremely value-free. In my mind, plants are analogous to schizophrenia. They are the heroes of the modern era" (Den., 28). Abe explains more about plants in his early work At a Road Sign on the Street Which Has Ended (Owarishi michi no shirube ni) (1948). A homeless opium addict in this work happens to see green leaves shooting out of the snow. He suddenly feels The animal inside of me groans with envy for the complete self-containment and self- fulfillment attainable only by plants. Have I come to the end of the earth in order to look for a conjuration to transform myself into a plant? No, it cannot be. Plants whose sole purpose is their existence cannot have means. As long as they have no need of means, there cannot exist any distinction between action and a recognition for them. If one merely wants to possess oneself as a plant, turning out to be a mad man is quite sufficient. 177</page><page sequence="9">178 Vol. 15, No. 2 Plants and animals are not the same although K tries to persuade Komon-kun that they are essentially iden- tical. By turning into a plant, Komon-kun totally loses that initiative which could move him toward a quest for the meaning of his existence. Instead, he is now "a ruin in the shape of a man."19 Komon-kun at least retains some form of life no matter how immobile he may be. In other of Abe's metamorphosis stories, men turn into inorganic sub- stances, thus scarcely reflecting the dignity of man. In "A Red Cocoon," dusk is falling and the protagon- ist is looking for his home. He does not know why he is homeless. He wonders if he has a house and merely does not remember it. He knocks in vain on the door of a house to see if it is his own. Every place on earth seems to belong to someone other than himself. If he tries to rest at a public place, he is told "this place belongs to everyone and no one in particular. Keep on walking."2 He asks him- self if the wandering Jew refers to himself. In his roaming, he notices a silk thread coming out of his shoe. As he pulls it, his foot and leg unravel. The thread starts unwinding by itself and wrapping him until his whole body turns into a big empty cocoon. He is certain that he has finally found his own home where he can rest, but then he realizes "there is no more 'I' to come home to" (Akai, 144). The cocoon is picked up by a passerby and is given to his son as a toy. We are not told by Abe what kind of work the hero does, nor how he looks. The impression we re- ceive from the work is that of a nameless being in search of a place which would establish a proof and reason for his existence. The search which starts from nothing ends in a void. He still has an external form but it is an empty shell devoid of any action. Abe explains that the mentally deranged do not per- ceive the normal flow of time which is usually felt when there is a shift of space or a change in the course of an incident. If the mental derangement becomes severe, Abe says "there is the possibility JOURNAL OF THE</page><page sequence="10">ASSOCIATION OF TEACHERS OF JAPANESE that a crack in time can be expanded into a patient's whole world."21 In "A Red Cocoon," after the pro- tagonist changed into a cocoon, "time stopped inside the cocoon. The outside darkened, but inside the cocoon it was always dusk. The cocoon glimmered red with the evening glow inside it" (Akai, 144). The hero's time is fixed at the moment when everyone goes back home. His whole consciousness is congealed into the endless and useless search within himself for his non-existent identity. In 1951, Abe received Japan's most coveted liter- ary award, the Akutagawa Prize, for his novella The Wall--Mr. S. Karuma's Crime. The narrator of this story, Mr. Karuma, one morning finds that he cannot recall his own name. There is no trace of his name on his belongings. He goes to his company where he sees that another "man" is already working at his desk. When he stares at his other self, he realizes that it is his name-card. Mr. Karuma finds that the empti- ness he felt in his chest in the morning has devel- oped into a true cavity. He goes to a clinic where he confuses his name with Karute (Chart), Arute, Aruma and finally with Akuma (Devil). While he is waiting for a doctor, the cavity in his chest sucks up the scene of a wild plain which he has seen in a magazine. Thrown out of the clinic, he visits a zoo where animals of the savanna show an unusual attrac- tion for the space within him. While he is resisting the temptation to absorb a camel, he is caught by a zoo keeper and secret policemen. He is put on trial in the basement of the zoo in the presence of every- one he knows or has ever met. People put a blindfold on Mr. Karuma lest they should be absorbed into his vacuum. Mr. Karuma is charged with stealing the pic- ture of the wild plain and of tempting the camel. The trial in the basement is a reflection of a similar one in "A Red Cocoon." When the hero in "A Red Cocoon" tries to stay at a public place, he is told, "Walk on. If you don't like it, we want you to come to the basement through the gate of the law" (Akai, 142). The underground is where the law carries out its scourging power upon individuals. Komon-kun is in 179</page><page sequence="11">180 Vol. 15, No. 2 danger of being tried by the law which has been founded on mores established to regulate social life for people's benefit but which has become abstract and inhuman and now has an independent power of its own. One of the judges at Mr. Karuma's trial explains, If there is no trial, there will be no accused. If there is no accused, then the crime becomes impossible. The fact that crime is impossible implies that even if there is something we want to steal, we cannot steal. Accordingly, in order for those who want to steal to steal freely, trials are necessary."22 As his name suggests karma, Mr. Karuma is tried by his own human acts which have taken the form of a vicious circle of cause and effect.23 At the trial all the witnesses fail to prove that Mr. Karuma is indeed the real Mr. Karuma, and the judges cannot come to a verdict. They decide instead that Although the law cannot judge the accused, the accused at the same time cannot claim his rights. The law and justice are concerned only with names. Consequently, we must maintain the status quo and keep the case open. Until the accused finds his name and a decree is possible, the trial must be continued forever. (Kabe, 57-58) Mr. Karuma takes off the blindfold and the people run away in great haste.24 Mr. Karuma goes back to his room and waits for his name-card's return. He worries that "until the name-card comes back and I go back to my original self, no one will come close to me without a blind- fold. Solitude, where one is deprived of freedom, is the solitude of a solitary cell in a prison" (Kabe, 66-67). In the middle of the night, his name- card slips back into the room and stirs Mr. Karuma's belongings into a mutiny against him. Under a JOURNAL OF THE</page><page sequence="12">ASSOCIATION OF TEACHERS OF JAPANESE manifesto, "From Dead Organic Substances to Live Inorganic Substances," Mr. Karuma's jacket, trousers, shoes and glasses claim their own initiative and inde- pendent existence. At dawn, his belongings become docile, but when he tries to put them on, all of them refuse to be handled. Just as Komon-kun suffers from uncontrollable movements of parts of his body, Mr. Karuma's paraphernalia become more active than Mr. Karuma. The consciousness of the objects seems to be more clearly directed to a goal than that of Mr. Karuma. In his use of the objects, Abe may be influenced by the concept of objects in surrealistic paintings where objects are often treated with the same dignity as man. In surrealistic paintings ob- jects come alive as the "material expression of in- hibited wishes, anthropomorphic vegetations of the permanently unpredictable in man." 5 In the case of Mr. Karuma, his belongings express his perhaps not unpredictable, but certainly inhibited, wishes for action. When Mr. Karuma finally succeeds in putting on his clothes, he goes again to the zoo where he sees his name-card having a date with his girl friend. When he looks at the girl closely, he realizes that she is a mannequin doll that he often saw in a show window and to whom he had taken a liking. Mr. Karu- ma's world comes to resemble that of a nightmare where his wishes come true; yet he cannot control them. On his way back from the zoo, another manne- quin suggests that he go to a movie show on the topic of the end of the world. The mannequin tells Mr. Karuma that he may escape from the pursuit of the court at the end of the world. At the private show, Mr. Karuma sees the wild plain in his chest reflected on the screen. A speaker at the show tells Mr. Karu- ma that, since the earth is proven to be round, the end of the world is swept into one spot. The speaker explains, "strictly speaking, for those who think of the end of the world, the world has changed itself into the most familiar thing. In other words, for you, your room is nothing but the end of the world and the wall there is the horizon which limits it" (Kabe, 181</page><page sequence="13">182 Vol. 15, No. 2 107). He adds that because at the end of the world the north pole and the south pole are joined together in a dialectical synthesis, your room becomes the true end of the world when you find the other end of the world as its opposing pole. Perhaps we can arrive at a philosophical interpretation that those who travel to the end of the world not only escape from the world, but, at the same time, be- come important messengers to connect the two poles.... in other words, messengers who send themselves as messages to themselves... The con- crete method for departure... starts from one's steady gaze at the wall. (Kabe, 107-108) Mr. Karuma goes back to his room through the screen and starts staring at the wall. It is the first time he has looked at the wall in such a way. He specu- lates that the wall represents both "man's activities since olden times and the breeding womb for the skep- tical and experimental spirit of man"(Kabe, 114). He starts singing a song which suggests a clue to the meaning of Abe's concept of wall: Wall, I praise your great activities. To beget man, you were born out of man. To be born out of man, you begot man. You freed man from Nature I call you thus Man's hypothesis. (Kabe, 114) Man differentiated himself from other animals in nature in his effort to formulate sets of hypothetical regula- tions out of the phenomena around him. Regulations are the frame and protection which mark man's terri- tory of consciousness, and within this consciousness man carries on his daily activities. Abe explains that "without a hypothesis no thought is possible. However, sensations of day to day living lead one to believe that one's hypotheses are unmovable universal truths (that is, common sense),and do not make one aware that JOURNAL OF THE</page><page sequence="14">ASSOCIATION OF TEACHERS OF JAPANESE they are, in fact, hypotheses. 26 Hypothesizing is an inevitable ingredient in man's culture, but it can also shield man from seeing reality or can bind him into confinement. After Mr. Karuma's paean to the wall, the wall disappears and reappears again with a gloomy look. The wall looked wet and swollen. That was the wall's other face which absorbed his predecessors' lives like a blotter. All of a sudden, he saw a dark curse standing between him and the wall. The wall was no longer a consolation but an unbearable burden. It was not a wall of freedom which would protect man, but a wall of restraint which had stretched from the prison. "It was your fault," the wall said, "that I became most fully developed in pris- ons and fortresses." (Kabe, 114-115) For Abe's literary endeavor, the well established wall of petrified hypotheses is something to be shattered. He says, "The reason I see real value in developing a style is because I have felt the need to make my- self clearly aware that a hypothesis is just a hypo- thesis and that that hypothesis needs to be replaced by a new hypothesis."2 In this regard the statement in the story that "those who leave for the end of the world are the messengers who send themselves as mes- sages to themselves" has two meanings. For Mr. Karuma who has to fight his own split self, repre- sented by a name-card, the phrase is a prediction that he will be caught in a hypothesis of his own creation. His world is to be closed like that of the plant into which Komon-kun has changed. For Abe him- self, the phrase suggests that the story is the expression of his effort and is now being presented to himself in concrete form as an independent entity. The wall can be a beginning and an end. Although Mr. Karuma is able to glimpse a potentiality in the wall, he soon falls back into a blind alley. As Mr. Karuma watches the wall, it is absorbed into his vacuum and starts growing there. Two 183</page><page sequence="15">184 Vol. 15, No. 2 characters representing "The Growing Wall Investiga- tion Party" try to explore the phenomenon inside Mr. Karuma but run away when they find it is more than they can tackle. They leave saying, "'Let's pull out.' 'Yes, let's go back!' 'To our home!' 'To our home!"' (Kabe, 138). "To our home" re- flects that they are not the lost ones like the protagonist in "A Red Cocoon" but successful people who have found security in hypothetical "pseudo- communality."28 Left alone, Mr. Karuma feels that the wall is pushing him from inside. He looks at him- self in a window pane and sees he is like a stretched hide on a tanning board. Finally his whole body changes into a thick sheet of wall. The novel ends with the following phrase: Wild plain as far as the eyes can reach. I am the wall growing silently and endlessly in the midst of it. (Kabe, 138) The common notion of a wild plain is that of a no man's land. When we recall, however, that the sand hills in Abe's later work, The Woman in the Dunes (Suna no onna) (1962, tr. 1964), implicitly suggest city life and also that the end of the world in The WaZZ implies one's own room, we can speculate that the wild plain is a segment of man's daily life where a wornout hypothesis takes precedence over the dynam- ism of changing reality. In this life, Mr. Karuma himself becomes a restricting limitation in which there is no insecurity and then again no freedom. Abe's short story, "A Stick," first appeared in 1955 and was rewritten as a play in 1957. In these versions of "A Stick," Abe concentrates more on the social import of metamorphosed man than on the de- scriptionofa psychological process. In the first story, the narrator, "I," falls from the rooftop of a department store where he is taking care of his children. He does not know when he has been meta- morphosed, but he hits the ground in the form of a stick. A man, who looks like a professor, and his two students pick up the stick and start discussing JOURNAL OF THE</page><page sequence="16">ASSOCIATION OF TEACHERS OF JAPANESE its merits. (These three characters are replaced in the later play by two characters from hell: an instruc- tor and a worker newly stationed on earth.) From the scars and the worn condition of the stick, they con- clude that the stick must have been well used by people in its former life. They define the stick as a funda- mental tool, and because it is not particularly molded for any special purpose, see it as being used in many ways. A stick can be used for leading the blind, for training dogs or for hitting one's enemy. A stick must be the embodiment of "sincerity (seijitsu)," they decide.29 The professor tells the students that "in short, this man was a stick. And this is the necessary and sufficient answer about this man... in other words, this stick was a stick."30 They reveal that they are here to judge the dead. They conclude that the stick "must be judged by not being judged."31 The professor assures the students that the best pun- ishment for the stick is to leave it as it is so that someone will pick it up and use it the way it was used in its former lifetime. Abe says in one of his essays that "by giving the name 'stick' and by recog- nizing it as a stick, man acquired not individual sticks, but an abstract general stick."32 The hero's change into an abstract general stick signifies that his metamorphosis takes place within the boundary of human affairs. There is no superhuman power to change man, but man has fallen into a pit of his own digging. The play, "A Stick," written in 1957, was put to- gether with two other short plays and came out in 1969 as a three-act play, The Man Who Turned into a Stick (BZ ni natta otoko) (tr. 1975). The first act, "A Briefcase" (Kaban) centers around the conversations of two women who are curious and who want to open and see inside a briefcase which is played by an actor. The second act which originally came out as a separate work (1964) is entitled "The Cliff of Time" (Toki no gake). The action follows a boxer's monologue from the first round till he is knocked out in the fourth round. The last act is "The Man Who Turned into a Stick." Abe indicated that each act might be sub- titled "Birth," "Process," and "Death," respectively. 185</page><page sequence="17">186 Vol. 15, No. 2 The women's noncommittal curiosity in the first act suggests that people are born without any particular meaning, and also that man is nothing inherently prom- ising at his birth. Abe goes on to explain that people are fascinated by boxing because there is only victory or loss for the boxers. It is a rule quite contrary to that which regulates the masses. For these common people, ordinances are "based on a mid- dle ground of neither victory nor defeat... the foundation for the rules of civil society."33 The boxer in the second act anticipates that after his retirement from the ring he will have to assume a life in the middle ground of daily routine. The tension and vigor in fighting for either victory or defeat is seldom sustained throughout man's life. Most boxers are fated to suffer a sense of loss once their career comes to an end. The last act is called "Death" and the employees of hell come to judge the symbolic death of the hero. The man transformed into a stick con- tinues to exist in his dead state of total passivity. In "Dendrocacalia," "A Red Cocoon," and The WalZ, transformation is carried out by single heroes, al- though there is a suggestion that the heroes represent Everyman. In The Man Who Turned into a Stick, meta- morphosis obviously becomes a fate shared by many people. In the last act of the play, Abe adds an epi- logue recited by the employees of hell after they judge the stick. The instructor walks to the front of the stage, points to the audience, and says: Look, this forest of sticks that surrounds you... these innocent people who perhaps want to be a different species of sticks but never once thought of becoming anything other than sticks... stick comrades, you with no fears of being either judged or punished.... (Suddenly changing his tone...) Oh, no, I'm not hinting at anything... no, no, how could I be so impolite... never... (forcing a smile) a mere fact, just a fact as it stands, you understand.... [The worker, to the man who has become a stick,] That's right, you're not alone. Out JOURNAL OF THE</page><page sequence="18">ASSOCIATION OF TEACHERS OF JAPANESE there, you have many friends... men who have turned into sticks.3 The great number of sticks in Abe's work does not add gaiety or vitality to the group but instead breeds a gloomy silence. The instructor in the play suggests that "Those who... have become sticks fill the earth. The lord has gone and the earth is the grave of decay- ing sticks" (Bo ni, 657). Abe's metamorphosed men are deprived of language and sounds. There are a great number of sticks, plants or cocoons, but they are not able to communicate with one another. Since language works as a connecting device between man's internal world and external reality, when a collapse occurs in man's consciousness, there is also a concomitant loss of language ability.35 The sticks, while not repre- senting the obvious symptoms of schizophrenia, are also unable to create out of their emptiness any topics to share with their fellow men. The crus- taceans are people who are irritated by the seeming purposelessness of their lives, but they don't know what they are looking for, nor do they take the initiative to find out what it is they could be look- ing for. They seldom discuss their problems with their friends. All the characters in Abe's works show the same characteristics of an internal vacuum. The emptiness is expressed in such phrases as "feeling of being pulled away somewhere" (Den., 8), the falling of the body, or "flowing away" (Den., 17). Komon-kun, exhausted by holding onto his shaky face, is tempted to throw it away. Then he thinks, "If I do that, what can remain behind?" (Den., 17). He does not have any internal substance which could support his face. Many of the characters do not have a place which they can call home. The repetition which fills their lives makes them lose a clear grasp of time. A hippie type girl in the last act of The Man Who Turned into a Stick complains that "when tomorrow arrives, tomorrow is today again.... I fail to grasp. I can't bear the thought that after tomorrow comes another tomorrow ad infinitun" (BD ni, 652-653). Their past 187</page><page sequence="19">188 Vol. 15, No. 2 memory also fails. The protagonist in "A Red Cocoon" imagines he does not remember his own home, and Komon- kun is not sure whether he has a sweetheart or not. For all of these characters, metamorphosis visits one day without any ostentatious introduction. It merely creeps in on them as if it had been quietly spun out of the elements of their daily routine. When they find the unusual happening to them, they are uneasy and upset but seldom look for what is causing it. Once they are used to the change, they feel rather complacent. Komon-kun, feeling a strange and comfort- able sense of saturation at his attack, comments, "I will be a plant. Once I make up my mind to be a plant it is a kind of pleasant sensation" (Den., 18). The man in The Man Who Turned into a Stick mumbles, "What else can I be but a stick?" (B5 ni, 659). Both com- ments suggest that the characters in Abe's stories wish to change themselves without realizing their desire to do so. Perhaps they are passively conditioned by an outside power to wish the change. The name-card in The Wall declares Good men and women simply keep waiting for the last judgement. The weakling who could not re- sist during the war eagerly wished to go mad.... The coward who does not have the ability to live makes up the story of the devil.... We simply change their sodden wishes into reality and re- turn these to them. (Kabe, 89) The man in "The Stick" confesses that he unconsciously has tried to run away from the responsibility of taking care of his children: his wish has been granted in a perfect form. Abe's works do not explicitly state what the out- side agents are which create pressure for change. We can, however, speculate from the passage in "The City under Water," quoted earlier, that the agents repre- sent an abstract power operating in a social mechan- ism.36 In "A Red Cocoon," "I" is told by "he" (kare), who appears to be a policeman, to leave public places. "He" takes the shape of an authority which reinforces JOURNAL OF THE</page><page sequence="20">ASSOCIATION OF TEACHERS OF JAPANESE the social regulations which work favorably for the abstract mass but not for individuals. This is the same "he" who finds the cocoon lying between the railroad tracks. Seeing the cocoon, "he gets angry at first" (Akai, 4) probably because the cocoon is immobile, but nevertheless he picks it up and gives it to his son. The utter humiliation of the pro- tagonist occurs when he finds himself in the boy's toy box. In "Dendrocacalia," the superintendent of the garden assures Komon-kun that, after his trans- formation, his comfort will be guaranteed by "the government" (Den., 28). Komon-kun feels that K knows everything about him although he never met K before. K, who seems to be omnipresent, seems like a Harpy to Komon-kun. K is merely a tangible repre- sentative of the whole scheme which is too large and abstract for Komon-kun to understand. Komon-kun calls this obscure power encircling him "fate" (unmei) (Den., 14). Although it appears to be the heroes' secret wish to deal with the threatening power by metamorphosis, when they actually become aware of the wretchedness of their condition they suspect that it is a "punish- ment." When Komon-kun compares his state with that of Dante's suicides who are punished by being trans- formed into trees, he reaches an understanding: "I must have committed suicide without my knowledge" (Den., 23). What he does not know is that he has not ruined his body but has killed his inner life, his own personal joy and sorrow, and his drive for action. Komon-kun also looks into Greek mythology and feels that man is driven into metamorphosis by the hands of the gods. He thinks, "After all, metamorphosis into a plant means that one is deprived of happiness in- stead of being saved from unhappiness. It means being thrown into punishment itself instead of being freed from punishment. This is no law of man. This is the law for Zeus' slaves" (Den., 26). While he longs for a new Promethean fire which cannot be ex- tinguished by the Olympian gods, he is only capable of creating a weak flame by burning a letter from K. Because he cannot grasp the cause driving his 189</page><page sequence="21">190 Vol. 15, No. 2 adversary, K, Komon-kun's ingenuity, like the ephem- eral flame, fails him, and he finds himself unable to create any change. Abe explains the theme of "The Stick" as being "the description of human alien- ation in modern society where man's sole reason for existence is to be used by others like a stick.... By being a stick, man is punished by his own internal reality."37 Simply because it is his own internal reality which recoils back upon him, he fails to see what punishes him. Without the ability to see the cause of his misfortune, Komon-kun, like all of Abe's metamorphosed heroes, lacks a sense of guilt. He then resigns himself to punishment rather than accept- ing it. Abe's transformed people are not the chosen classical heroes who cause their own misfortunes and then are endowed with the insight to recognize the folly of their self-defeating hubris. In this respect Abe's early heroes are not unique individuals but Everyman. In Abe's early works, after the heroes are trans- formed they lose their identity and become types--as suggested by their anonymity or symbolic names. Thus stick, cocoon or wall, all come to stand for the es- sence of a dehumanized existence. In his later works, however, Abe moderates the use of physical alteration as a major device so that his heroes are not transformed into types. The ordinary heroes in Abe's early works are transformed not simply because they are in a sub- servient social position, but because their sensitivity will not allow them to endure inhuman predicaments and therefore they are exceedingly vulnerable to insults to their human qualities. This sensitivity, in Abe's later works, acts as a catalyst in the hero's effort to change himself and the environment so that it will be possible to discover the meaning of his existence and establish new, significant human relationships. For example, the man in The Woman in the Dunes, as he collects water out of sand, attempts to extract mean- ing from this material which constitutes his daily exist- ence; the hero in The Face of Another (Tanin no kao)(1964, tr. 1966), wears an artificially made new skin over his JOURNAL OF THE</page><page sequence="22">ASSOCIATION OF TEACHERS OF JAPANESE chemically disfigured face and thus attempts to re- establish human relationships; the vagrant in The Box Man (Hako-otoko) (1973, tr. 1974) tries to secure a point of view all his own by disguising himself in the pseudo-metamorphosis of a box-shell with a peep- hole. Thus Abe's heroes have evolved from the nega- tive images of more passive transformed figures into decisive, transforming individuals. Metamorphosis is revealed to be the necessary step through which Abe examines how man is adversely affected by the en- croaching demands of a hostile world. Only then can man proceed to the next stage--demonstrating how this predicament can be converted into a constructive chal- lenge. NOTES Abe K6ob, Sabaku no shiso (Tokyo: Kodansha, 1970), p. 32.

In the group of stories mentioned in this text, the change appears as a complete and automatic physical transformation of man's body. In another group which encompasses "The Invention of the R62" (R62-go no hatsmnei) (1953), "Appendix" (Moch5) (1955), "Enterprise" (Jigy5) (1950) and "The Petition- ing Party against Eating Human Flesh and Three Gentle- men" (Jinniku-shokuyo-hantai-chinjodan to san-nin no shinshi tachi) (1956), the alteration affects a part or whole of man's body, and is deliberately brought about by another human. 5Hasso, p. 161. 1 6"endorokakiriya, " Suichu toshi, Dendorokakariya, p. 15.

The differences between Kafka and Abe are clear in the sense that, in the work of Abe, the accused does not have a sense of guilt and also he is tried for the obvious anti-social act of "name- 1essness." 24 The importance of name as proof of one's iden- tity is later reflected in The Woman in the Dunes in which the hero, who is captured by the villagers on his insect hunting trip, rationalizes that he cannot be claimed to be non-existent by the outside society because he has "a family register, has a job, pays taxes, and has medical insurance."
