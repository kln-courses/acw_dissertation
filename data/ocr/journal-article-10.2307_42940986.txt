<plain_text><page sequence="1">SHOFAR 5 SUMMER 1984 FEMININE LANGUAGING IN THE HEBREW SCRIPTURES by Arthur E. Zannoni One of the givens of Judeo-Christian theology is that the Bible is a source of God's revelation to humankind. Before the last quarter of the twentieth century, biblical scholarship had been engaged in androcentric or patriarchal interpretation, which displays the cultural values that arise in a male-oriented society. But with the rise of feminist hermeneutics (principles of interpretation), biblical interpretation enters a new era with new practitioners who offer "a critique of culture in light of misogyny" (Trible, 7). These new feminist critics believe that a "hermeneutic of suspicion" needs to be developed to better interpret biblical texts. Virginia Mollenkott sums up this "hermeneutic of suspicion": Because patriarchy is the cultural background of the scriptures, it is absolutely basic to any feminist reading of the Bible that one cannot absolutize the culture in which the Bible was written. To absolutize something means to regard it as the fundamental or ul- timate reality. So to absolutize the biblical culture would mean to assume that the standards of ancient Israel or first-century rabbinic Judaism represent God's ultimate will for the human race. Instead of making such an assumption, we must make careful distinc- tions between what is "for an age" and what is "for all time." We cannot assume that because the Bible was written against the backdrop of a patriarchal social structure, patriarchy is the will of God for all people in all times and all places (91). Utilizing such a feminist hermeneutic, this article will explore the "suspicion" that the Hebrew Scriptures witness to varying images for God. While male imagery may in fact predominate, the Bible does nevertheless witness to feminine imaging as well. The article will focus on three areas of reflection from the Bible: feminine vocabulary for God, parent images for God, and reflections on the mutuality of male and female. The Limitations of Language To begin, the reader must understand the inevitable limitations of all religious language. All expressions - symbols,</page><page sequence="2">SHOFAR 6 SUMMER 1984 analogies, metaphors - utilized in the religious enterprise are analogous and metaphorical. Every statement contains a bracketed "as if" or "as it were." Statements, articulations, expressions about God should not be taken too literally, for they certainly do not exhaust all the possibilities for naming and describing God. Rather they are the most adequate human expressions available within current human idioms, that is, linguistic conventions which point to that which transcends language. In brief, all language about God is anthropomorphic - human in form. As such, human expressions about God contain no inherent finality or unalterable relevance and convey no ultimate truth. To ignore these limitations by fixing on one set of ideas and thinking that a real correspondence exists between these images of God and God is to be unrealistic, insensi- tive to language, and fundamentally idolatrous. But, because expression and communication are inevitable, images and concepts of God are also inevitable. Therefore, the limitations of language present no problems if one remembers those limits whenever one is tempted to literalize and absolutize one's language. Rosemary Ruether urges a deeper consciousness of God- language: We need to look for God-language which is liberating and redeeming, rather than those images which ratify unjust and repressive characteristics of sinful human society. This is a constant process of renewal of the meaning of language in the context of movements of renewal of our experience of God as liberator and redeemer. There are a number of key principles in Scripture and theology which can be drawn upon to help us see the ways of revising our God-language. One such key principle is the proscription of idolatry. We are to make no graven images of God. Fixed pictorial representations of God tend to be taken literally and so become idols. Hebrew thought was chary not only of artistic, but also verbal images of God, and refused to write out in full any name for God. Verbal images too can become idols when they are taken literally. Thus when images of God drawn from male roles are taken literally as meaning that God is male, such images become idolatrous. Feminine Vocabulary for God In the Bible God has dominion over womens' wombs. This principle is illustrated in three stories. Genesis 20:1-18 tells of how the patriarch Abraham passes off his wife Sarah as if she were his sister and permits King Abimelech to take her into his harem. We are told that immediately God acts to protect and save Sarah by threatening the King, who releases Sarah to Abraham. Sarah is vindicated by God, Abraham prays, and fertility comes to</page><page sequence="3">SHOFAR 7 SUMMER 1984 the household of King Abimelech. But the significance of this fertility is explained: "For God had closed every womb of the house of Abimelech because of Sarah, Abraham's wife." God, who had closed wombs in judgment, opens them for fertility. The second narrative illustrating God's dominion over women's wombs concerns Leah (Genesis 29:31-35). She had been used by her father Laban to trick Jacob, who now hates her. Therefore "when God saw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb." Interestingly, the story does not contrast God's favor for Leah with God's disfavor of Rachel. It simply states that "Rachel was barren," not that God had closed her womb. Later, though, "God remembers Rachel," harkens to her, and "opens her womb" (Genesis 30:22). In the third story of God's dominion over wombs, "God remembers" Hannah (I Samuel 1.1-10), who had been sad because "God closed her womb" (I Samuel 1.5,6). In time, "Elkanah knew Hannah his wife and God remembered her" (I Samuel 1.19); she conceived and bore a son. In all three stories, the noun womb (rehem) is a physical object upon which the deity acts. Control of it belongs neither to women nor to their husbands. Only God, according to the aforementioned narratives, opens and closes wombs in judgment, in blessing, and in mystery. Associations of God with the uterus are found in other parts of the Bible of ancient Israel. Not only does God (not Baal) control fertility by closing and opening the womb, but God also works in the organ itself to mold a gestate individual human life: Before I formed you in the womb (beten) I knew you, and before you came forth from the womb ( rehem ) I set you apart (Jeremiah 1.5). As the place of God's creative activity, the womb provides the origin and destiny of the prophet Jeremiah. The theological legitimation of Jeremiah's prophetic vocation comes from God's activity in Jeremiah's mother's womb. This is also the case fòr the Psalmist: For thou didst form my inward parts, thou didst knit me together in my mother's womb. (Psalms 139.13). Thou of course refers to God. The book of Job broadens the activity of God in the womb to include other people, not just a chosen few: Did not he who made me in the womb (beten) make him? And did not one fashion us in the womb (refcem)? (Job 31". lb) I'</page><page sequence="4">SHOFAR 8 SUMMER 1984 For the writer of Job, this organ, the uterus, is the source of human equality because of the creative activity of God, who also governs life outside the womb. It was left to the psalmist, however, to sharpen God's activity in the womb. He/She presents the deity as preparing the uterus for birth, doing the birthing, and receiving the infant out of the mother: Yet thou art he who took me from the womb (beten) : thou didst keep me safe upon my mother's breast. Upon thee was I cast from the womb (reķem); from the womb (beten) of my mother my God thou art. (Psalms 22.9-10). Phyllis Trible believes that "in this poetry the divine and the maternal intertwine. God takes the baby from the womb and places it upon the breasts of the mother. In turn the tranquility of the breasts becomes a symbol of divine care " (38). Thus for the author of Psalm 22, God is impregnator, mother, midwife, and nurse. The juxtaposition of breasts and womb occurs again in Genesis 49.25: by the God of your father who will help you, by God almighty (el sadday ) who will bless you with blessings of heaven above, blessings of the deep that couches beneath, blessings of the breasts (sadayim) and of the womb (rah am) . The crux of this passage lies in the word play between the epithet sadday (mountains) and the noun sadayim (breasts), which connotes a maternal aspect in the divine. In addition to the implications of the words womb and breasts , the Bible languages God in a procreative fashion. We can see this in the Song of Moses (Deuteronomy 32.1-43). One verse is of special concern: You were unmindful of the Rock that begot you (yeladeka) and you forgot the God who gave you birth (meholeleka) (Deuteronomy 32.18). These phrases use two metaphors for God: rock and birthing. Rock signifies God's integrity and stability against Israel's corruption. In this passage the noun rock is modified by a verbal form that introduces the dimension of procreating: yeladeka. The root yld can describe either the begetting of a father or the birthing of a mother. Proverbs 23.22 and 25 show both meanings:</page><page sequence="5">SHOFAR 9 SUMMER 1984 Hearken to your father who begot (yeladeka) you, and do not despise your mother when she is old (Proverbs 23 . 22 ) . Let your father and mother be glad, let her who bore you (Yoladteka) rejoice (Proverbs 23.25). Thus in Deuteronomy 32.18, the divine image suggested by yeladeka may be either maternal or paternal : the Rock that bore you or the Rock that begot you. The corresponding image at the end of verse 18 of Deuteronomy 32, "the God who gave you birth," is, however, exclusively maternal. Meholeleka designates in the Bible only a woman in labor, and this activity the Deuteronomist ascribes to God. With labor pains God gave birth to Israel. Thus an androgynous interpretation of Deuteronomy 32.18 presents complementary parental metaphors. In the first half of the verse, the Rock is the father who begot, and God is the mother who writhed at birth. An androcentric interpretation is no longer tenable. Birthing vocabulary is not confined to Deuteronomy. It appears again in predication of the deity in the poetry of the anonymous prophet Second Isaiah. God exclaims: now I will cry out like a woman in travail, I will gasp and pant (Isaiah 42.14b, RSV). or Like a travailing woman I will groan; I will pant. I will gasp at the same time (Isaiah 42.14b, NAB). Besides the vocabulary of labor pains and birthing, there is also in the Bible the vocabulary of conception. In Numbers 11, the people of Israel, wandering in the desert, cry out like babes wail- ing for their mothers. By indirect language Moses disclaims that he is the poeple's mother and implicitly attributes that role to God: Did I conceive all this people? Did I bring them forth, that thou shouldst say to me, "Carry them in your bosom, as a nurse carries the sucking child, to the land which thou didst swear to give their fathers? (Numbers 11.12). In this text Moses implies that God conceived and bore Israel; he even expands the imagery to suggest that God is to wet-nurse the infant too. This reading suggests that God is a woman, or more accurately is imaged as a mother whose bosom gives care and nourish- ment to Israel, the newborn infant. The image of the nursing child reminds us also of the baby safe upon its mother's breasts and cast from the womb upon God's benevolence as narrated in Psalms 22 . 9-10 . Thus the aforementioned</page><page sequence="6">SHOFAR 10 SUMMER 1984 texts reveal that the entire process of birthing has been attributed to God. In various passages we have noted that God conceives, is pregnant, writhes in labor pains, brings forth a child, and nurses it. Such a feminist critique allows God the mother to emerge alongside God the father in the Bible. Both metaphors seem to be presented; the challenge is of course to hold both of them in a healthy tension. Parent Images for God in the Bible In several announcements and at various occasions in the Bible, God speaks of Israel as a son. The first of these - canoni- cally speaking - occurs in the speech Moses was instructed to pass on to the pharoah: And you shall say to Pharoah, "Thus says the Lord, Israel is my first-born son, and I say to you, 'Let my son go that he may serve me ; if you refuse to let him go, behold, I will slay your first-born son"' (Exodus 4.22-23). The parent-son relationship between God and Israel had thus been established in connection with , or even prior to, the deliverance from Egypt. Quite similarly, Hosea - who made such profound use of the husband-wife analogy - interprets the Exodus event as the deliverance of God's son: "When Israel was a child, I loved him, and out of Egypt I called my son" (Hosea 11.1). In these passages the sexuality of the child is clear but not that of God. It is said neither that God is male or female nor that God is mother or father. The issue is a single one: the relationship of Israel to God, a relationship which is either the motive for the deliverance from Egypt or its results. Other biblical texts speak of this relationship between God and people in images pertaining to father and mother roles. Jeremiah, for example, uses the word father explicitly to describe God in relationship with Israel: I thought how I would set you among my sons, and give you a pleasant land, a heritage most beauteous of all nations, And I thought you would call me, My father, and would not turn from following me (Jeremiah 3.19). Yet the people did turn away from their father as faithless children. Regardless, that father-son relationship cannot be dissolved, even by disobedience. That relationship itself serves as the motive for God's deliverance of Israel from exile, just as the parent-son analogy once provided the basis for the exodus from Egypt: Behold, I will bring them from the north country, and gather them from the farthest parts of the earth . . . for I am a father to Israel, and Ephraim is my first-born (Jeremiah 31.8-9).</page><page sequence="7">SHOFAR 11 SUMMER 1984 Elsewhere, too, God is portrayed as acting like a father to Israel, particularly as one who disciplines his son to refine him. In the wilderness period, God tested and humbled Israel: "Know then in your heart that as a man disciplines his son, the Lord your God disciplines you" (Deuteronomy 8.5). In this capacity God functioned as a teacher of wisdom, a father instructing his children: My son, do not despise the Lord's discipline or be weary of his reproof, for the Lord reproves him whom he loves, as a father the son in whom he delights (Proverbs 3.11-12). Thus God is compared to a father when he performs the function of a wisdom teacher, and God is Called father when he, the King, delivers his people from bondage. In either case, the role which God plays, rather than divine gender , determines the use of the analogy. Another image that requires exploration is that of God as father of the Davidic King. On the basis of Nathan's oracle narrated in II Samuel 7, David's successors to the throne in Jerusalem stood in a special relationship to God. Along with the divine promise that God would make David's dynasty endure forever, God saysî "I will be his father, and he shall be my son" (II Samuel 7.14). This mythical relationship of king to God is realized in ritual. Psalms 2, a royal coronation psalm, describes the action of the ceremony in Jerusalem when each succeeding Davidic king was crowned. Among the several stereotyped images is the announcement from God through the priest, "You are my son, today I have begotten you" (Psalms 2.7). The point of "today" was that the relationship with God was not. established at birth; rather on coronation day God adopted the king by use of a legal formula, "You are my son." Jerusalem's rulers were not, therefore, divine beings, They were adopted by God on the basis of their office and dynasty which God had established with David himself. In Psalms 89, where the mythological victory of God over the sea provides a theological foundation for the Davidic covenant, God promises that just as he stilled the raging sea, so he will set the hand of his anointed one (his messiah) on the sea (Psalms 89. 9-10,25). This transfer by the Psalmist of primordial power to the king who faces various enemies will enable the king to cry, "Thou art my Father, my God, and the Rock of my salvation" (Psalms 89. 26). As for God, he will elevate this king beyond all others: "I will make him the first-born, the highest of the kings of the earth" (Psalms 89.27). It is in connection with deliverance and power over enemies that the Davidic ruler uses the title "Father"; thus the role of warrior, so vital to the throne of Jerusalem, and the "Father" image go hand in hand. If the traditional male roles of protection and pedagogy led the ancient Israelites to speak of God as Father, then the divine roles of compassion and mercy were conveyed by various images</page><page sequence="8">SHOFAR 12 SUMMER 1984 related to mother. One aspect of the female image is related to the belief that various emotions were founded in specific organs of the human body. The liver was the seat of joy; when it was poured out, the person was sad (Lamentations 2.11). The kidneys were the seat of conscience (Psalms 7.10, 6.2); the heart, the center of the intellect, the mind (Proverbs 16.9). Thus, in a society where internal organs were of more interest psychologically rather than physiologically, it is consistent that "mercy" is related to the Hebrew term for the female anatomical part , womb ( r ehem ) . In the same chapter in Jeremiah in which God based deliver- ance from exile on his being "Father" to Ephraim (Jeremiah 31.9), the prophet used the female image to support the loving, intimate relationship between the two of them: Is Ephraim my dear son? Is he my darling child? For as often as I speak against him, I do remember him still. Therefore my heart yearns for him: I will surely have mercy (raham) on him, says the Lord (Jeremiah 31.20). During the Babylonian Exile in the sixth century B.C.E., the anonymous prophet Second Isaiah compared God to a mother. In response to Israel's painful sense of abandonment, God assured, "Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should have no compassion on the son of her womb?" (Isaiah 49.15). Earlier, the same prophet reláted God's sudden change in behavior regarding Israel's exile to the pains of a woman giving birth. Just as the long waiting of pregnancy suddenly erupts in the travail of labor, so God changes from silence at Israel's plight to the actions of deliverance and restoration. Out of this thunderous silence God erupts : For a long time I have held my peace I have kept still and restrained myself; now I will cry out like a woman in travail, I will gasp and pant (Isaiah 42.14). Then a series of formidable rhetorical questions by God demonstrates to Job divine unfathomable power in contrast to human limitation, and God appears (or is interpreted) as father and mother over nature: Has the rain a father, or who has begotten the drops of dew? From whose womb did the ice come forth, and who has given birth to the hoarfrost of heaven? (Job 38.28-29). God gives birth to dew, ice, and frost: the writer explicitly depicts the deity as Mother Nature. Simultaneously the same explicit female activity portrays God as Israel's mother. In another instance of the female imaging of God, the Divine Mother gives birth to the ruling messiah on coronation day. In</page><page sequence="9">SHOFAR 13 SUMMER 1984 the announcement to the king in Psalms 2.7, God adopts the king by the legal formula, reciting "You are my son." Then God speaks like a mother: "Today I have begotten you" (or as the original Hebrew expresses it , "Today I have given you birth" ) . Addressed to an adult male, this formula can in no way be taken literally. It is, like the analogies stated above, a means by which the relationship of God to the Davidic king is described. Even though the act of a man's giving birth is incomprehensible - "Can a man bear a child?" (Jeremiah 30.6) - it is the function of the relation- ship rather than the sexuality of God which is important to observe in this instance. In brief, God's functional relationship to the king is both maternal and paternal. The parental images presented thus far describe the ways God relates to the world and to people. God is neither male nor female, but functions in various roles which ancient Israel assigned to male and female, to mother and father. That in the same society, even in the same pieces of literature in that society, God is described both as father and mother leads us now to one final consideration, the image of God as it relates to humans. The Relationship of God to Human Sexuality and the Mutuality of Male and Female In the environment surrounding ancient Israel, the sexuality and sexual activity of the gods were related directly to human sexual behavior. The Mesopotamian king performed the sexual role on the part of the god; the Egyptian deity was incarnate in the sexual act of the pharoah; in Canaan sacred prostitution corres- ponding to heavenly ecstasy, was the means by which fertility of land and humans was insured. If God is intimate but not genital with Israel, if Israel's God has no sexual partner but merely sexual metaphors, what can be said of human sexuality? The much-discussed poem in the Priest's creation account affirms both the sexuality of God and human sexual activity. By use of synonymous parallelism the relationships among the various components is deepened: So God created humankind in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them (Genesis 1.27). The verb created appears in all three lines. The synonyms for the Subject God in lines 2 and 3 are he and he. Humankind is parallel to him and them as objects of the verb. That structure leaves as synonyms in his own image , in the image of God, and male and female . (In actuality what is usually translated male and female in the original Hebrew is pronged [zakar] and orif iced [neqebah] ) . That the Priest should describe God's image as bisexual is completely consistent with the father and mother analogies discussed above. While god is neither male nor female, God is understood and languaged</page><page sequence="10">SHOFAR 14 SUMMER 1984 by humans in terms of the sexual roles of both sexes. God's role as creator of the world is communicated, humanly speaking, by roles assigned to female and male alike: to bear fruit and thus create human life throughout the earth (Genesis 1.28). In addition, this divine image in terms of female and male exercises dominion over the rest of creation: as kings and queens ruling all other living things. By this function, too, something about God is known and communicated on a human level. Walter Bruggemann notes that "because humankind is an image, a modeling, an analogy of God, sexual metaphors are useful for speaking of the mystery of God" (33; see also Bird, 129 ff.). The creation account of Genesis 1.1 - 2.4a affirms human sexuality to exiles in Babylon during the 6th century B.C.E. with the creation blessing of God, "Be fruitful and multiply," and so testifies to a living God ruling over the universe. Yet it is precisely in this proclamation of hope that the Genesis writer asserts the place of sex and sexual roles. The blessing of progeny could not be achieved apart from sexual intercourse of male and female, so the act was ordained and blessed by God at creation itself when the creator assigned roles to every created phenomenon. When God the Creator examined the divine work, even the sexual nature of male and female, the deity pronounced "Good." The God of the Bible needs no sexual intercourse. Without a sexual partner, encompassing within the divine self both female and male roles, God bestows the gift of sexuality upon human and animal creatures. As humans responsibly cooperate in the creative act, they reflect and image the divine creative act. For the priestly author of Genesis, human sexuality reveals therefore the image of God. The simultaneous creation of male and female depicted in Genesis 1.1 - 2.4a does not at first seem to appear in the Yahwist account of creation (Genesis 2.4b-25), so the Yahwist has often been labeled a male chauvinist. The Yahwist describes the creation of the sexes sequentially, the male appearing first, and character- izes the woman as "a helper fit for" the male. Yet we may recall that when God examined the lone male in the garden, God determined it was "not good" for the man to be without female. The primary human relationship established at the beginning was thus the mutuality of companionship. The Yahwist' s description of the woman should also be translated more literally as "help as his counterpart" (Genesis 2.18 &amp; 20). The Hebrew word kenegdo simply means "as opposite him" and in no way implies that the woman is inferior or subordinate to the man. As for the help designation, philology has substantiated that elsewhere in the Bible, the word ezer ( help ) is used only in reference to God. Either God is the source of help (see Psalms 20.2; 121.1-2; 124.8) or God is help (see Exodus 18.4; Deuteronomy 33.7; Psalms 33.20; 70.5; 115:9-11). Far from indicating subordination and/or assistance, the Hebrew word ezer (help) might be related to the Ugaritic gzr , connoting strength. Thus the woman in Génesis 2 is at least the equal of the man from whose rib she was formed. Trible comments on the Yahwist' s creation account:</page><page sequence="11">SHOFAR 15 SUMMER 1984 Finally, woman is not derived from man, even as the earth creature is not derived from the earth. For both of them life originates from God. Dust of the earth and rib of the earth creature are but raw materials of God's creative activity. Truly, neither woman nor man is an autonomous creature; both owe their origin to divine mystery. Differentiation from the earth, on the one hand, and from the man, on the other, implies neither derivation from them nor subordination to them (102). If Genesis 1 portrays human sexuality solely in terms of progeny, Genesis 2 depicts human sexuality as pleasure and beauty in commitment. The Yahwist's paradise account is not alone, however, in such an affirmation of the joys of human sexuality. The Song of Solomon (Song of Songs) portrays vividly the romance of a man and a woman. The love epitomized here is eros - sensual, sexual love which takes pleasure in the anatomical parts of the partner and which extols and celebrates the beautiful physical affection a man and a woman can share. Similar in form and content to many such love songs in the literature of ancient Israel's neighbors, this Song is particularly interesting for our discussion. The Song of Songs maintains that sexual love is not an embarrass- ment but unequivocally good. Indeed, the entire love relationship between the male and female brings shalom, peace - completeness and wholeness - by participation in life's joys (Song of Songs 8.10). The love affair as depicted in the Song is by no means designed for the production of progeny. The pleasure and fantasy of the bedroom rather than the results and reality of the nursery occupy the sage/poet's concern and language here. Moreover, it is not even clear in the Song that the man and the woman are marriéd to each other. (Nor is it clear that the man is a king and the woman a queen . ) In addition, the woman as depicted in the Song is by no means a passive agent serving as the instrument for the man's pleasures. Rather, throughout the Song she takes as much initiative in the lovemaking process as the man and enjoys its pleasures equally. Her and his sensuality are celebrated throughout the Song. There is no superiority of male over female here. Finally, the noun God appears nowhere in the Song, so the approbation for the erotic lovemaking does not come from God but from the mutuality of male and female. Taken together, then, Genesis 1 and 2 and the Song of Solomon (Song of Songs) attest to the equality of male and female and to the natural beauty of human sexuality. Without the need for correspondence with heavenly activity, human sexuality is God's gift to male and female. Without the need for divine affirmation, human sexuality is the gift of man and woman to one another as articulated in the Song of Songs. As a piece of wisdom literature, the Song of Songs celebrates the human condition of sexuality without God's entering from the outside.</page><page sequence="12">SHOFAR 16 SUMMER 1984 Conclusions We may then draw these conclusions from our examination of some feminine imaging in the Bible: 1. Employing ä "hermeneutic of suspicion" may result in a depatriarchialized exegesis of the Bible. 2. Examining feminine vocabulary for God's activity and parent imaging for God takes seriously feminist criticism of biblical studies and begins to move toward a feminist reconstruction of biblical theology. 3. An exploration of the mutuality of male and female in the Bible avoids an androcentric interpretation of texts and an overly absolute gender izat ion of either God or humans. Or as one scholar has stated, "In the biblical tradition God completely transcends sexual distinctions. Hence both masculine and feminine terminology can be applied to God: as well as 'anthropomorphism,' there are ' gynomorphisms '" (Scobie, 46). I have attempted to remain faithful to the challenge of Elisabeth Schussler Fiorenza, a sister exegete, who presents this caveat for interpreting Biblical texts: Hermeneutical discussion is concerned with establishing the meaning of biblical texts. Although the interpreter always approaches a historical text with specific contemporary experiences and questions, the scholar must attempt to become as free from preconceived understanding of -the texts as possible, even though it is impossible to detach oneself completely from any preunderstanding . It is the subject matter of the text, or the text as such, and not preconceived ideas or presupposed situation that should determine the interpretation of biblical texts (5-6). ********************************* Sources Cited Bird, Phyllis.
