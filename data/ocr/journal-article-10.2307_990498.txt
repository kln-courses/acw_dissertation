<plain_text><page sequence="1">Plan and Space at Amiens Cathedral: With a New Plan Drawn by James Addiss STEPHEN MURRAY and JAMES ADDISS The combination of a new measured plan, a detailed investigation of the building fabric and spaces, and a reinvestigation of the textual sources for Amiens Cathedral leads to a revised chronology and a new interpretation of the interaction between the visitor's perception of the building and the geometry inherent in the spatial envelope. We show how decisions made by thefounding master mason, Robert de Luzarches, determined the entire plan, but also brought inherent structural problems that were exacerbated by revisions introduced in the last phase of con- struction. INHERENT IN OUR UNDERSTANDING of Gothic planning and space are two apparently contradictory currents of thought. In the spirit of 19th-century romanticism, we may see Gothic masons as people who "felt rather than measured"; that is, as artists able to manipulate space and light to elicit a powerful emotional response in the mind of the beholder, conjuring up thoughts of the sublime.1 We also inherit the "rational" pre- conception that a great building must have been systematically The surveying work for the new plan was completed in 1987 and 1988 in a collaborative effort by James Addiss and Stephen Murray. Bay dimensions were measured directly by means of a steel tape, and or- thogonality was established through extensive triangulation. Stephen Murray measured the piers with a large pair of calipers and constructed pier sections on a one to 10 scale, and the hemicycle on a one to 50 scale. James Addiss constructed the major spaces on a one to 50 scale and drew the final plan on a one to 100 scale. The buttresses at the base of the hemicycle and to the north of the northwest tower could not be reached, and the Durand plan (itself derived from Viollet-le-Duc's plan) was used in order to plot these units. While the new plan presents the cathedral in its 13th-century state, ancillary buildings known to have existed at this time are not shown. The most important of these was the two-story treasury to the north of the choir, repository for the relic of John Baptist's head. The treasury, demolished in the 18th century, is shown in the plan given by Jean Baron, Description de l'eglise cathedrale Notre-Dame d'Amiens, written before 1815 but published only in 1900. The authors wish to thank Jean-Yves Le Corre (Conservateur re- gional des monuments historiques) and Jean-Francois Porcher (guard- ian) for their assistance. In addition, Stephen Murray recognizes the support that he has received from the American Philosophical Society, the American Council of Learned Societies, and the Guggenheim Foun- dation. 1.

Frankl, The Gothic; Literary Sources and Interpretations through Eight Centuries, Princeton, 1960, especially 417-488. 44 thought out during the initial stages of design, with the main relationships in plan and elevation fixed through the application of proportional systems that we ought to be able to isolate and understand.2 It is curious that so little attempt has been made by students of Gothic architecture to relate these two concerns one to another, and to explore the way in which the peculiar spatial effects of a given building resulted from careful choices made by the master mason during the early stages of planning. Studies of Gothic planning have sometimes led to the imposition of squares, rectangles, circles, and other geometric figures upon small-scale plans of dubious accuracy. The first essential component of a study of this kind is an accurate large-scale plan (Fig. 1).3 Then, we must also take temporal dimensions into account: first, the extent to which the existing building expresses the intention of the initial designer or has been modified during construction; and second, the changing reactions of the beholder moving through the interior spaces. It is this action of movement that energizes space, causing it to "soar" as attention passes from the lower to the upper parts, or to "expand" as we become aware of the relationship between central and peripheral spaces. To what extent was a Gothic cathedral planned specifically to take advantage of the pilgrim's movement through space? The historical dimension Amiens Cathedral, begun in 1220 and virtually complete by 1269, is an obvious choice for an essay on the relationship between space and planning, since it was constructed relatively quickly, probably without major changes of plan.4 Moreover, 2. Such "rational" preconceptions are expressed by E. E. Viollet-le- Duc, Dictionnaire raisonni de l'architecturefrancaise du XIe au XVIe siecles, 10 vols., Paris, 1858-1868. 3. The plans published in Durand's monograph (see n. 4) are small in scale but, as far as we can tell, quite accurate. They were derived from plans originally made by Viollet-le-Duc (Archives Nationales F19 7601). However, they do not indicate many of the idiosyncratic features of the Amiens plan, such as the slight variations from orthogonality and the added orders in the transverse arches of the aisle bays adjacent to the crossing. 4.

Moreover, Amiens was an intellectual center of some repute, and members of the clergy would certainly be familiar with Euclidian ge- ometry and with Aristotelian thought. For instance, in his Bib- lionomia, written while the cathedral was under construction (c. 1260), the chancellor of the Amiens chapter, Richard de Four- nival, made reference to the most recent writings on statics by Jordanus de Nemore.5 While we have a mass of information about the clergy in- volved in the construction of the cathedral, our understanding of the identity of the master masons is much more limited. An inscription running around the central plaque of the labyrinth set in the pavement of the nave informs us that the work was begun in 1220 and was directed successively by Robert de Lu- zarches, Thomas de Cormont, and his son Renaud de Cormont.6 A charter dated 1260, still preserved in the departmental archives, mentions the house held by master Renaud de Cormont in the episcopal manse to the northeast of the cathedral.7 Thus, the master designer lived in close proximity to the clerical patrons expressed by G. Durand, Monographie de I'eglise Notre-Dame, cathedrale d'Amiens, 3 vols., Paris, 1901-1903. This understanding was modified by A. Erlande-Brandenburg, "La facade de la cathedrale d'Amiens," Bulletin monumental, CXXXV, 1977, 253-293, who believed that con- struction of the western frontispiece was delayed because of the inability of the chapter to gain control over the land to the west, and that the form of the existing west facade is the result of a compromise. This interpretation has been challenged by J. Thiebault, Les cathidrales go- thiques en Picardie, Amiens, 1987. A new skepticism about Durand's chronology is also evident in D. Kimpel and R. Suckale, "Die Skulp- turenwerkstatt der Vierge Dor6e am Honoratusportal der Kathedrale von Amiens, Zeitschrift fur Kunstgeschichte, XXXVI, 1973, 217-265; idem, Die gotische Architektur in Frankreich, 1130-1270, Munich, 1985; and M. Foucart, "L'6glise Saint-Firmin-le-Confesseur et la cathedrale d'Amiens, Cahiers archiologiques de Piacardie, VII, 1980, 310-310. 5. Richard de Fournival, La Biblionomie, (ed.

The labyrinth, set in place by Renaud de Cormont in 1288, was removed when the cathedral was repaved between 1827 and 1829. It was restored in 1894; see E. Soyez, Les labyrinthes d'eglises; labyrinthe de la cathidrale d'Amiens, Amiens, 1896. The form of the original pavement and the shape of the labyrinth had been recorded in drawings; the central octagonal plaque was preserved (it is now in the Mus6e de Picardie in Amiens); and the inscription running around the plaque was recorded in a 14th-century martyrology and register of the distributions (Archives de Somme, MS G 2975). 7. Archives de Somme, MS G 194, a charter dated 1260 relating to a house "sitam in manso dicti domini episcopi iuxta domum Lamberti mercerii clerici ex parte una et domum quondam magistri Renaudi cementarii magistri fabrice beate marie ambian. ex altera." of the cathedral. There is every reason to believe that the build- ing project evolved through a continuing series of conversations between the clerical patrons and the master masons, Robert de Luzarches and his successors Thomas and Renaud de Cormont. In addition to the labyrinth inscription, we also have the information contained in the charter issued by Bishop Geoffroy d'Eu in 1236 referring to the grand plan of the founding bishop, Evrard de Fouilloy (d. 1222).8 The main concern expressed in the charter of Bishop Geoffroy d'Eu was with the reestablish- ment of the H6tel Dieu, the hospital that had existed on a site to the north and west of the Gothic cathedral in a new location to the north of the city in the parish of Saint-Leu. The parish and collegiate church of Saint-Firmin the Confessor, which had been located in the area of the north transept of the Gothic cathedral, was moved to the site of the H6tel Dieu. If the 1236 charter refers specifically to the administrative framework es- tablished by Bishop Errard de Fouilloy to expedite the start of work, what about the architectural plans? Did Robert de Lu- zarches draft a complete plan on a sheet of parchment or on a stone or plaster surface at the start of work? Our study of the manipulation of the geometric skeleton that lies behind the cathedral plan will suggest that this was, indeed, the case. Analysis of the plan A plan can be conceived either through the addition, one to another, of a series of modular units to create a total entity, or it might be envisaged as a totality that could then be subdi- vided into smaller parts.9 These principles are obviously not mutually exclusive. If the first principle were the dominant one, then we would expect to find a high degree of regularity in the dimensions of the bays, expressing an ideal unit (perhaps a square) that might then be multiplied in a mechanical way. Villard de Honnecourt drafted such a modular plan based upon square schematism as an ideal plan for a Cistercian church.10 Appli- cation of the second principle, on the other hand, might bring consistent geometric generation of the overall plan. The study of the Amiens plan reveals both a high degree of precision and also a surprisingly wide range of dimensions for the bays, especially in the transept and choir (Appendix). The nave extends for a total of seven bays from the western fron- 8. Gallia Christiana, X, col. 342, item LXVII. A copy of the same charter is also to be found in the Cartulary of Saint-Firmin le Confesseur, Bibliotheque d'Amiens MS 520 fol. 30 v?. 9. In a recent article on the reconstruction of Saint-Denis, Michel Bouttier, discussing the forms of rayonnant window tracery, termed these two approaches to design as "crystallization" (the placing side by side of identical modular units) and "hierarchy" (implying the subor- dination of the subunit to the whole); see Bouttier "La reconstruction de l'abbatiale de Saint-Denis au XIIIe siecle," Bulletin monumental, CXLV, 1987, 357-386. 10.

Three different lengths for the bays are employed in the nave, allowing transitions to take place at the west and east ends. The five middle bays are approximately the same, and the repetition of identical units experienced as the visitor walks down the nave establishes a spatial norm by which the spectacular effects of the transept and choir can be judged. In the central vessel each bay is nearly a double square, being only slightly longer in an east-west direc- tion (average north-south span: 14.66 m.; east-west length: 7.44 m.). These dimensions are taken from the center of one pier to the center of the next-points that the beholder cannot expe- rience directly. We sense the proportions of the nave bays main- ly through the proportions of the high vaults carried down to our own level by the shafts of the walls and piers. Each bay of the vaulting is defined by longitudinal arches (formerets) framing the clerestory windows and the transverse arches. The thickness l S | g lA | S: S F [:: [S' Fr&gt;?[': [-N</page><page sequence="11">48 JSAH, XLIX:1, MARCH 1990 Fig. 4 Amiens Cathedral, detail of the dado of the west aisle wall of the north transept. of these framing arches creates a cell that is very close indeed to the shape of a double square.1" This is the first indication that the plan of Amiens Cathedral was shaped by a designer who was primarily interested in shapes and proportions based upon simple geometric relationships that can actually be sensed. How- ever, the bounding lines of the spaces are not established by wall surfaces or the axis lines hidden in the mass of the piers, but rather by the linear elements-colonnettes, vault ribs and arches, and string courses. The same conclusion may be derived from a study of the space and plan of the bays of the nave aisles (Fig. 3). Here our study is complicated by the fact that the original outer wall of the aisle has been eliminated and a string of lateral chapels added in the late 13th and 14th centuries.12 In order to provide suf- ficient depth for the new chapels, the buttresses were extended outward and new exterior walls, windows, and vaults were con- structed, lending a flat, screen-like periphery to the exterior of the nave. Each bay of the original aisle wall had an interior dado of six panels topped by half quatrefoils, exactly as we still see in the existing outer walls of the transept and choir (Fig. 4). At the foot of the dado runs a socle bench. The arrangement creates a sculptural effect, resulting from the projection of the bench and the depth of the arches of the dado that frame shallow panels of space. These dado panels should be construed as es- sentially anthropomorphic entities: they establish a human scale that is then immediately transcended by the extraordinary height 11. In this context, the setting back of the upper wall of the Amiens nave takes on a new significance, since it allows the north-south span of the main vaults to become wider, approaching the shape of a double square. 12. For the addition of the chapels between 1292 and 1375, see G. Durand, Monographie, I, 40-54. The nave dado was carefully removed and adapted to fit against the new outer wall of each chapel. The remains of the dado, heavily mutilated through the installation of the present altars, can still be seen, hidden under 18th-century wooden paneling in the depth of each chapel. Fig. 5. Amiens Cathedral, bronze tomb effigy of Bishop Evrard de Fouilloy, d. 1222. of the aisle and central vessel. In his tomb effigy the founding bishop, Evrard de Fouilloy, is enclosed in an architectural frame capped by just such a half quatrefoil (Fig. 5).13 Above the dado arcade, the aisle windows came down very low, filling the entire bay opening and establishing a translucent screen that defined the edge of the aisle space. Although this screen is now gone in the nave, the piers marking the bay divisions survive in a modified state (Figs. 6, 7, and 8). In their present form, the chamfered edges of the windowjambs have been extended down to the pavement, allowing us to establish the exact location of the plane of the glass. Measured to this point (the glass of the original aisle windows) the bays of the nave aisle are rectangles, with their long sides running north-south (average 7.44 m. by 8.79 m. in the south aisle and 7.44 m. by 8.73 m. in the north aisle; see Appendix). However, our perception of the bay is fixed more by the shape of the vault, which is framed by arches of varying thickness and, as we look down the aisle, perceived through the projecting springers of the transverse arches. These 13. The quatrefoils enclosing the figurative sculpture of the embra- sures of the western portals have the same dimensions as the dado panels, and the upper row of quatrefoils is set at about the same height as the top of the panels.</page><page sequence="12">MURRAY AND ADDISS: PLAN AND SPACE AT AMIENS CATHEDRAL 49 Fig. 6.

The experience of the nave aisle is thus, in part, one of tightly defined and controlled spaces. The visitor's path down the nave aisle was hemmed in by the original outer wall and windows, which is so unlike the present arrangement with chapels that form deep pockets of lateral space. Particularly destructive to</page><page sequence="13">50 JSAH, XLIX:1, MARCH 1990 0.50o Fig. 8. Amiens Cathedral, section of a respond attached to the outer wall of the nave, restored to its original state. the spatial schemes of the original designer has been the outward extension of the lateral buttresses that now block the diagonal admission of light (Fig. 9). Originally the visitor might have been able to use the rapid rhythm of the dado panels as a means of measuring his own progress down the aisle, while the rep- etition of (seemingly) square aisle vaults and double squares in the central vessel established an equally rigorous norm on an even grander scale. The spatial experience The visitor entering at the west portal and progressing to the east will experience the spaces of the nave, transept, and choir in a particularly dramatic way.14 The church is more than an abstract plan and a physical structure: it is an experienced spatial entity. In this processional path the spaces gradually and pro- gressively reveal themselves as a set of transformations of the initial order. It is possible to reconstruct this essentially mobile 14. A couple of caveats are in order as we begin our journey. It should be recognized that the present lighting of the interior is much brighter than would have been the case in the middle ages, when stained glass windows were present; see the unpublished study by N. Frachon-Gie- larek "Cathedrale d'Amiens, etude de la vitrerie," Contrat d'gtude, Minis- tere de la Culture, July 1984, with extensive bibliography. The glass probably disappeared over a prolonged period of time, victim of the violent storms that sweep in from the northwest and of changing taste. Similarly, we must realize that the arrangement of the interior furniture was somewhat different, although the height of the medieval choir screen, installed in the late 13th century, may have corresponded rough- ly to the present screen. It would be presumptuous to claim to recreate the viewing experience of a medieval person-of course, we see the building through 20th-century eyes. However, we can explore the building in no way other than moving through it, and the present study seeks to allow full recognition to the role that this movement plays. The sculptural program of the west facade provides an invitation to think in terms of motion, since the sequence from the minor prophets on the front surfaces of the buttresses to the major prophets to the Fig. 9. Amiens Cathedral, view from nave into south aisle, showing lateral chapel. apostolic age, and finally to the age of grace provides a kind of accelerator that hastens us into the interior spaces by means of Christ the door. The kinetic energy of the visitor, arriving before the central portal, unleashes the coming of the Christ of the Last Judgment. Fig. 10.

As the visitor enters at the west end of the nave the limitless bounds of the exterior world and the vast spread of the west facade are reduced by the funnel-like effect of the portal (Fig. 10a). In the interior, the great spare forms of the nave focus the attention of the beholder directly toward the altar at the end of the long spatial axis (Figs. 2 and lOb). You see and are imme- diately made part of this long axis down to the bright choir. You also see the vertical axis of space up to the bright clerestory (Fig. 11) and the horizontal axis formerly framed by the bright aisle windows (now transformed through the addition of lateral chapels). Of the solids perceived at this point, most important are the first free-standing piers of the nave, the responds of the great piers at the base of the towers, the thickened walls of the entrance portals, and the grouped responds of the aisle colon- nettes and vaults. Above, the triforium and its rich foliage band, the clerestory, and the nave vaults appear in steep perspective. These forms and their spaces seem like an apparition, different in color, shape, vocabulary, coolness, and height from the out- side world. Standing still, the interior induces the sensation of Fig. 12. Amiens Cathedral, nave, south arcade to east. various kinds of motion, a rush along three different axes: width, height, and length. The length of the nave seems infinitely distant in the sense of being uncountable units long, and its width is unexpectedly generous. Most of all, its height is far greater than the blocky forms of the exterior implied. The cathedral has created a new kind of reality which obviates for the moment the dictates of a uniform and consistent physical world.15 At Amiens this experience is powerful in an unusual way because there is no separately defined transitional zone between outside and inside. The abrupt transition at the west entry is the result of the unusual design of the towers, each open to the interior on its east side at its lower stage. In the central portal 15. It is the creation of a new kind of reality through the undertaking of a journey that lends mythological dimensions to the experience of our visit. As a result, the visitor or pilgrim becomes a type of hero. We are encouraged to entertain the idea of myth partly through the presence of the decorative labyrinth, known in the middle ages as the "House of Daedalus," in the tiles of the nave floor. It should be remembered that Daedalus, the inventor of wonderful things, was the first man to fly. H. Birenbaum, Myth and Mind, Lantham, 1988, defines myth in terms of space, time, and wonder.</page><page sequence="16">MURRAY AND ADDISS: PLAN AND SPACE AT AMIENS CATHEDRAL 53 Fig. 13. Amiens Cathedral, south transept from nave. the visitor experiences the thickness of the west wall (more than two meters) only as a diaphragm, not as an opaque longitudinal plane defining the inner side of a tower. The complex transitions from exterior to interior of earlier medieval architecture-Car- olingian, Romanesque, and early Gothic-are rejected in favor of a radical simplification which enforces a shock of experi- ence.16 Away from the portals to the east the main axis to the altar remains dominant, reiterated through the repeated uprights of the piers (Fig. 12) and their shafts and the rhythm of the vaults above. The transept arms and the choir aisles remain invisible. All the way down the nave, the supports, lines, planes, and bay openings repeat themselves endlessly, enveloping you in a com- plex three-dimensional system of clearly demarcated lines and (less clearly expressed) planes that frame the repeated spaces of the bays. The faceted diagonals of the vault ribs above, and the 16. The mass of the tower-supporting piers at the west end of the naves of Notre-Dame of Paris, Laon, or Reims cathedrals creates a very different kind of entrance with a distinct area of transition between exterior and interior space. sliding planes of the walls, whose locations are always changing from one level to the next, lend a dynamic, moving quality to the system. The system seems to envelop you completely, not only because you are surrounded by it, but also because of the hypnotic effect engendered by the multiplicity of the elements, especially the linear elements, that compose it. This dynamic regularity prepares you for the eventual con- trasting transformations of the opening spaces of the transept (Figs. 13 and 14) and the concentrated radiality of the hemicycle. The experience of the nave serves to intensify the effect of what follows to the east. Bourges, without a transept, Beauvais, with- out a nave, and Poitiers, without a clerestory, must necessarily be experienced very differently from Amiens, Chartres, or Reims. Let us now recreate the spatial experience of the path down the nave in some more detail (Fig. 10). From the first (west- ernmost) bay the view east is laterally limited, and the beholder seems drawn into the repetitive system (Figs. 2 and lOc). From the east side of this first bay the transept can barely be perceived; it is but a hint within the overall consistent frame of the nave and choir. In the second bay the view of the transept closes down again. Then, from the forward area, the choir aisles begin to appear.17 In the third bay of the nave the transept and outer choir aisles become visible (Figs. 12 and lOd), and at the eastern edge of this bay, both outer bays of the transept and the east crossing piers are completely revealed. From the fourth bay the beholder sees for the first time the bounding north and south walls of the transept facades, and hence the entire width of the cross axis. The transept clerestory and the space between the east and west crossing piers also become visible, that is, the transept becomes the potential equiv- alent of the nave. The converging spaces induce a sensation of being engulfed. In the fifth bay the transept arms open up as a set of spaces- aisles and main vessel, with constituent piers, arches, and walls (Fig. lOe). The tops of the vaults are still hidden. From the sixth bay, the penultimate one, the full set of tran- sept spaces and choir aisles are visible (Figs. 13 and 14). At the eastern edge of this area the full transverse rhythm of the tran- sept piers comes into play. And finally the transept is experienced as the full equivalent of the nave, with all of its spaces and solids, and its vaults overhead. This bay of the nave was of particular significance in functional terms, since it was here that the clergy and people would assemble to listen to sermons.18 17. The builders of the lateral chapels of the nave removed the glass of the aisle windows to the west of the transept arms, leaving the open tracery, through which one glimpses the piers on the west sides of the transept arms. 18. The importance of preaching in the 13th-century cathedral is attested through the survival of a written version of a sermon thought to have been delivered in the unfinished cathedral; see A. Crampon, "Un sermon pr&amp;ch6 dans la cathedrale d'Amiens vers l'an 1260," Me-</page><page sequence="17">54 JSAH, XLIX:1, MARCH 1990 Fig. 14. Amiens Cathedral, south transept from nave (Courtauld Institute). In the seventh and last bay you are still in the nave, but also in the transverse axis of the transept, since the ends of the west aisles of the transept arms are visible (Fig. 10f). The aisles seem extremely open, partly because of the increased width of this bay, but mostly because they are three bays deep. Now the total spatial organization of the church seems clear, especially since the choir ahead has appeared the same throughout. But a new surprise appears: the choir aisles-a hall space without visible connection to the still mysterious set of spaces behind the hemicycle arcade (Fig. 15). So the choir, until now the seemingly simple and well-understood beacon at the end of the approach axis, is now understood as having a complexity yet to be experienced. The crossing bay is above all a great intersection of two colossal axes of space (Figs. 16 and 10g). It subordinates and simplifies. The differences in the lengths of the axes are less important than the similarities in their cross sections and ele- vations. The five colonnettes and the angles of the stepped bodies of the great crossing piers rise in a single sweep at the four corners of the central space (Fig. 17). Beyond the crossing piers open the biggest aisle bays of the cathedral-big not only be- cause of their dimensions, but even more because they are seen across their diagonals and open out into the adjacent spaces. The crossing is thus, by far, the most open part of the church, not only because of the intersection of the four great spaces, but also because its base opens diagonally into the subordinate Ls formed by the aisles. The peripheral walls of these aisles were all punctuated by great windows, so the crossing is flooded with light from its surrounding spaces, lower as well as higher. Our processional path down the nave has brought us into a new kind of reality that is progressively transformed. The initial extraordinary awareness of spatial expansion in three dimensions is transformed into the experience of the eastward leading tun- nel, with its regularly repeated spatial units. The transformation of this regularity begins at an early point in the path eastward. First perceived as potentially limitless, the transept spaces pro-</page><page sequence="18">MURRAY AND ADDISS: PLAN AND SPACE AT AMIENS CATHEDRAL 55 Fig. 15.

The culmination of the experience is reached in the penultimate and last bays with the realization of the identity of the transept and the nave (their spaces are the same in cross section) and the power of orthogonal transfor- mation. This rich sequence starts out by being cumulative; in the first bays you can carry the memory of the totality of what you have seen. Eventually, however, these memories become too many to retain. They compress and overlap, creating a fusion of the experiences of repetition and transformation. To the east of the crossing comes a further succession of bays and similar revelations.19 This description of the nave sequence is enough, however, to show the role of the beholder's move- ment in realizing the potential of the design decisions made by moires de la Societe des Antiquaires de Picardie, 1876, 551-601. While it seems that the nave of the cathedral has always been free of fixed seats, we can only presume that the 13th-century pulpit was placed in the same position as the present, 18th-century one at the east end of the north nave arcade. For an interesting 17th-century legal case involving a young man who took his own chair to sit and listen to sermons, bypassing the woman who rented chairs at seven sous, see Archives de Somme, MS G 1201. 19. A further study is planned by James Addiss, "Spatial Design at Amiens Cathedral." Fig. 16. Amiens Cathedral, crossing vaults (Raymond Foery). the master planners. The character of the entrance bays, the portal, the relative openness of the tower bays, and the relation of nave to transept and choir are not arbitrary. Within the set of design possibilities of their time, these features are related to each other and to the plan as a whole. A key feature in the relationship between planning and the viewer's experience is the existence of widened bays adjacent to the crossing. It is readily apparent from the plan that the easternmost bay of the nave has been increased significantly (from 7.44 m. in the nave, to 8.60 m., center to center, see Fig. 1). This increase in span is, to some extent, absorbed by the extra mass of the crossing pier, but still the gap between the piers is much wider than in the nave (6.00 m., as opposed to 5.20 m.). The expansion of the easternmost bays of the nave aisles is also facilitated through the unusual design of the piers at the corners where the nave aisles turn outward into the tran- sept (Figs. 18 and 19). These asymmetrical piers have double center points and embody shafts carrying additional orders in the transverse arches of the aisles. This arrangement was clearly motivated by optical as well as structural considerations. The</page><page sequence="19">56 JSAH, XLIX:1, MARCH 1990 Fig. 17. Amiens Cathedral, southwest crossing pier, looking up. additional order contributes to the overall span of this oversized bay, and also helps to support it. The choir aisle bays adjacent to the crossing have identical piers at the angle with the eastern aisle of the transept, and additional orders in the transverse arches as shown in Figure 1. The double axis points of the pier tend to blur the nature of the transition between the crossing and the nave, since the spans expressed on the west sides of the transept arms have only an indirect relationship with the widths of the nave aisles that open to the west.20 The crossing bay itself is almost square, being about 0.08 m. wider in an east-west direction. However, the transept aisles are somewhat narrower than the aisles of the nave. Each bay of the transept arcade is different, starting with oversized bays adjacent to the crossing (average 8.88 m., as opposed to 8.60 m. in the 20. This is apparent both from the detail of the pier section, Figure 19, and from the direct measurement of the lateral spans on the east and west sides of the pier in question. These piers at Amiens are almost identical (even in dimensions) to the equivalent piers of Laon Cathedral. This must tell us something about the regional background of master Robert de Luzarches. Fig. 18. Amiens Cathedral, respond at the angle between the west aisle of the south transept and the south nave aisle. first bay of the nave). This progressive diminution of the spans produces the smallest bay adjacent to the faSade, thus reducing the depth of the projection of the transept arms beyond the body of the building. We begin to perceive a consistent principle of design in the plan of Amiens Cathedral. In the extremities of each of the four arms of the cathedral-that is, in each of the transept arms, the nave, and the choir-the designer has adopted a contracted plan that pulls the periphery inward toward the center. This is as true of the plan of the nave with its reduced western towers (rectangular in plan, rather than square) as of the choir, where the double choir aisles are reduced to a single ambulatory ringed by rather shallow chapels. In the nave the designer has hidden substantial masses of masonry from the eye of the beholder by simply leaving them on the outside: the greater part of the mass of the lower wall is on the exterior; the enclosing arches of the chapel windows resemble little bridges and the flying buttress system is a substantial one. Conversely, the spaces open up more widely toward the center, creating a kind of extended crossing square that includes the adjacent widened bays of the nave,</page><page sequence="20">MURRAY AND ADDISS: PLAN AND SPACE AT AMIENS CATHEDRAL 57 I / I \ / / , / , , I ,'". !/ ?/ \ I J/ \.

The importance of the crossing is announced in the exterior massing through the presence of an emphatic steeple, whereas the western frontispiece is deempha- sized.21 The effect of the contraction at the extremities of the transept and nave is to enhance the impression of shock created by the tall, narrow bays experienced immediately upon entering the edifice. The planning of the choir In the main vessel of the choir, the east-west spans of the arcade are slightly wider than in the nave, facilitating diagonal views into the spacious double aisles. Each of the double aisles of the choir functions spatially as a kind of hall church (Fig. 15). Slight variations in the east-west spans of the main arcade of the choir follow no particular pattern. A wide bay adjacent to the crossing (8.57 m.) is followed by two narrower bays of 21. Most of the antiquarian sources for Amiens Cathedral refer to the existence of a 13th-century crossing tower of masonry and timber; see, for example, J. J. de Court, Memoires chronologiques qui peuvent servir a l'histoire ecclesiastique et civile de la ville d'Amiens, Bibliotheque nationale, Collection de Picardie, II, 18. The steeple was consumed in a fire in 1527. After extensive conversations with a range of masons and car- penters, the chapter chose the design offered by a local carpenter, Louis Cordon, who supervised the construction of the present magnificent steeple that was finished by 1533. The present crossing vault seems to have survived the disaster of 1527 and to be the original vault installed in the second part of the 13th century. some irregularity (7.58/7.65 m. and 7.56/7.51 m.) and then a wider bay before the hemicycle. The inner aisle bays are not quite square (being wider in a north-south direction), and the outer aisle bays are reduced in width, each being half the width of the main vessel. At the extreme east end of the building the main vessel is terminated in a ring of supports forming a hemicycle of seven segments (Figs. 1 and 20). The two segments at the base of the hemicycle on either side are substantially wider than the other five. The double aisles of the choir are reduced to a single ambulatory made up of seven trapezoidal bays. Shallow five- sided chapels open from this ambulatory; only the axial chapel has extra depth provided by two additional rectangular bays. Visually as well as conceptually the hemicycle is a key element in the cathedral plan and may be seen as a most powerful expres- sion of the identity of the master mason. Thus, the creative identity of Jean d'Orbais, the first master mason of Reims Ca- thedral, was expressed by a skeletal rendering of the hemicycle plan in the labyrinth formerly set in the nave pavement.22 The analysis of this part of the plan can thus provide vital information about the vision and working methods of the master mason. The Amiens plan type may be contrasted with buildings where the hemicycle is divided into five segments and the center point of the scheme is placed precisely upon the line that forms the 22. R.

Murray and Addiss, Amiens Cathedral, plan of the hemicycle. Copyright 1989 by Stephen Murray and James Addiss. base of the hemicycle, as at Reims, Soissons, Bourges, and Notre- Dame of Paris. Each of the five segments of the hemicycle can then be exactly 36 degrees. This scheme is rigorous, allowing fewer choices than the type of plan used at Amiens and Beauvais cathedrals, where the center point of the composition has been pushed to the east, creating a stilted hemicycle. In the kind of plan used at Reims, the radius of the half circle of the hemicycle piers is fixed by the width of the main vessel of the choir, and a syncopated rhythm links the semicircular bay of the hemicycle with the first straight bay of the choir. In the stilted hemicycles of Beauvais and Amiens cathedrals, on the other hand, the radius of the hemicycle was conditioned but not fixed by the span of the main vessel, and the position of the center point of the composition could be adjusted in order to achieve the desired effects. Thus, the five-segment plan can fix the relationship between the hemicycle and the adjacent straight bay and can link them under a common vault; the seven-segment plan sep- arates the two elements and can produce an abrupt transition. What does the analysis of the Amiens plan tell us about the underlying design methods of the master mason? This question has been addressed by Viollet-le-Duc and N. L. Prak, who both adopted the same explanatory technique: a schematic diagram where the key points are labeled with the letters of the alphabet (Fig. 21).23 When we, too, attempt to explain such a complex type of design as a hemicycle, we tend to slip into a step-by- step, how-to-do-it narrative that imposes our own presupposi- tions upon the sequence of design. We should recognize the limitations of our own framework of interpretation. In the plan of the east end of Amiens Cathedral we are dealing with the collision between two systems of design: one based upon two great concentric circles with their radii (for the placing of the piers of the hemicycle and ambulatory), the other forming 23.

Amiens Cathedral, schema of the east end by Viollet-le-Duc (Dictionnaire raisonne de l'architecturefrantaise du XIe au XVIe siecles, II, 332). the rectilinear grid system of the body of the building, expressed in our schematic plan as line ABCD, the eastern division of the last bay of the choir (Fig. 22). The points A, B, C, and D mark the centers of the piers at the base of the ambulatory and hemicy- cle. The two entities (concentric and rectilinear systems) meet in the outer of the two circles struck from a center point 0, placed on the axis of the main vessel at a distance of 2.52 m. to the east of the line ABCD.24 In placing this center point to the east of the line rather than directly upon it, the designer has created a segment that is greater than half of a circle. The circumference of this segment is then divided (empirically) into 24. This dimension can only be found through the work of surveying and construction. Viollet-le-Duc gave a correct figure; N. L. Prak an incorrect one. seven exactly equal parts forming the mouths of the seven ra- diating chapels. It has sometimes been implied that these di- visions each constitute one-twelfth of the total circumference of the circle, but in fact, although they are close to being one- thirteenth part, they do not form the sides of a regular polygon, and it is unlikely that they were established by strictly geometric means.25 Similarly, we find no abstract geometric rationale behind the placing of the center point 0. This placement was probably determined empirically. Such a procedure implies the use of scaled preliminary sketches made on parchment or a plaster tracing surface. In working out the design, our master mason clearly had two factors in mind. The circumference of the great circle could be increased or diminished by pushing the center point 0 to the east or west. This would affect the span of the openings into the radiating chapels, the angle of each segment of the hemicycle, and the angle at which each of the chapels at the base of the crown joins the rectilinear grid system of the body of the choir. Most critical in the placing of 0 was the desire to create a composition in which the radius drawn from point E through 0 would run directly through the center point of pier B at the base of the hemicycle.26 Thus, through the placement of 0, our matrix provides a means of relating the span of the mouth of the radiating chapel to the width of the central vessel of the choir. Both Prak and Viollet-le-Duc con- cluded that the former was the fixed entity that determined the latter. In other words, we are asked to believe that having fixed the center point and the outer circle, the designer worked in- ward, running the line from E through 0, thus discovering point B and establishing the width of the central vessel. How- ever, neither Prak nor Viollet-le-Duc tells us how point 0 was fixed, and it seems evident that this point could be moved at will to accommodate the various parts of the composition. Evidence of experimentation of an empirical kind is also found in the planning of the hemicycle. Here, the radius of the inner of the two concentric circles used to fix the placement of the hemicycle piers is not OC, as assumed by Viollet-le-Duc (Figs. 25. See, for example, L. Schiirenberg, Die kirchliche Baukunst in Frankreich zwischen 1270 und 1380, Berlin, 1934. The Beauvais plan, closely related to that of Amiens, was formed by dividing the circum- ference into 13 equal segments-a procedure also employed in the choir plan of Saint-Denis; see S. Murray, Beauvais Cathedral, Architecture of Transcendence, Princeton, 1989; and P. Kidson, "Panofsky, Suger and St. Denis," Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes, L, 1987, 1- 17. 26. 0 is the point of intersection of the radial lines of the apse piers and the responds between the chapels. The choir keystone is placed approximately on this point. However, the center point of the great half-circular plinth of the foundations that runs around the exterior of the radiating chapels, with a projection for the axial chapel, is about 0.40 m. to the west of 0. This is reflected in the fact that the buttresses of the westernmost chapels have a deeper projection than the buttresses of the chapels toward the east and center of the system.</page><page sequence="23">60 JSAH, XLIX:1, MARCH 1990 Fig. 22. Amiens Cathedral, schema of the east end based on new measurements. 21 and 22). Such a choice would have produced a design where the first segment of the hemicycle at the base of the system where it joins onto the straight bays of the choir would be on the same plane as the main wall of the choir arcade. Instead, it is apparent on inspection that this first segment is at a slight angle to the choir wall, beginning the faceted composition of the hemicycle.27 The designer has chosen a circle with a slightly smaller radius, passing just to the inside of points C and B. The composition was probably conceived by striking a line from C parallel to DE and allowing it to run through radius OE to point F. The radius of the circle upon which the hemicycle piers are placed is thus OF, and the piers at the base of the system at B and C do not stand upon this circle. In this way, the designer has ensured a composition in which the lines CF 27. This important conclusion may be reached both by means of direct measurement and also by simply looking down the interior of the triforium passage in the choir, which can be seen to begin to turn slightly at the base of the hemicycle. The same conclusion can also be derived from a direct sighting along the colonnettes of the main arcade piers of the choir on the aisle side. and DE, forming the sides of the first bay of the hemicycle, are parallel. Thus, the design of the hemicycle of the Amiens choir reflects a certain freedom from rigid geometric schemes based on regular concentric polygons. The same is true of the plan of each of the radiating chapels. Viollet-le-Duc and Prak both thought that each chapel was formed of five parts of an octagon. Such an arrangement would lend geometric perfection to the composition. It would also bring serious difficulties, since the parallel lateral walls of each chapel would render the wedge-shaped masses of masonry and buttresses between the chapels thicker than necessary. In fact, the design of each chapel reflects a compromise between the idea of an octagon and the desire to keep the masses of masonry relatively slender. Thus, the lateral walls are not parallel, but the space is allowed to open out in the depth of each chapel. The resulting expansion both counteracts the compactness of the planning and allows more light to enter. The chapels are thus both pressed close to the ambulatory and expand out from it. On the exterior the reduced mass of the main buttresses between the chapels allows for visual coordination with the smaller buttresses.</page><page sequence="24">MURRAY AND ADDISS: PLAN AND SPACE AT AMIENS CATHEDRAL 61 The geometry, then, of the hemicycle as it meets the straight bays of the choir is a little loose. This looseness is the result both of mechanical problems encountered in laying out the building and of inherent conflicts within the design itself. It is in this part of the plan that we encounter the largest discrep- ancies in dimensions that are intended to be equal. The spans of the ambulatory bays on the north are somewhat narrower than those on the south, while the chapels' mouths on the north side are wider than those on the south. In the faceted exterior surfaces of the chapels with their projecting buttresses we find a wide range of discrepancy-as much as 0.23 m. And then we encounter the geometrical irregularities that have resulted from the nature of the design itself. The collision between concentric and rectilinear systems has produced dis- torted ambulatory bays and smaller chapels at the base (west) of the system. Moreover, it has been seen that the hemicycle tangents meet the main arcade piers at the base of the system in an uncomfortable way. The architect has deemphasized these problems by several devices-the treatment of the east end of each of the outer choir aisles as a blind window echoing the real tracery of the adjacent aisle window and the near continuity of the line of the main arcade for one bay into the hemicycle. On the other hand, the different forms found in the dado, the responds, and the transverse arches and capitals of the aisle and ambulatory vaults emphasize the abruptness of the transition. But the most important visual device employed in the plan of the hemicycle results from the regular concentration of the radial axes of the radiating chapels and the masses of masonry between them inward through the ambulatory bays to the main vessel of the choir and the high altar. This concentration is marked on the plan by the great wedge-shaped blocks (tapering fromjust over 2.00 m. to about 0.25 m.) that form the buttresses between the radiating chapels. These arrow-shaped masses are laid out very accurately and point to a single center-exactly the spot where the high altar and relic altar are thought to have been located. The combined effect of the spaces, light entry, and visible structure of these radial slices, despite small differ- ences between them, simply overwhelms the slight geometrical discrepancies. And so here, too, at the east end of the building, we find that willingness to push and pull, to modify absolute geometrical regularity in the service of the same kind of visual spatial effect that we experience in the processional path from the west entrance to the transept and choir. Chronology It is hard to describe Amiens Cathedral in any way other than from west to east. We have thus introduced the temporal di- mension-the way our perception of the building changes as we move through it, and the time taken to construct the edifice. Are the changing spans of the bays, for example, the result of modifications to the original plan introduced in the course of construction, or do they belong to the initial grand plan? Was this initial grand plan drafted by Robert de Luzarches on a sheet of parchment that he handed on to his successors, Thomas and Robert de Cormont? It has been customary to assume that the lower choir was begun some 16 to 20 years after the start of work in the nave.28 Thus, the building is generally considered in two distinct parts: the nave and the west aisle of the transept on the one hand (1220-1236), and the east aisle of the transept and the choir on the other (1236/41-1269). The nave has often been seen as "classic" and the choir as "almost decadent." However, study of the physical evidence and a rereading of the written sources suggests that the entire lower building was laid out relatively quickly, without any major break, following the great plan established in the years around 1220 by master Robert de Lu- zarches. In the lower building it is only in the hemicycle that the vocabulary of articulation changes slightly. Whereas in the lower nave, transept, and straight bays of the choir the transverse arches have a rectangular section, in the ambulatory and in the entire upper building the transverse arches have a triangular section and capitals are beaked (Fig. 23). The use of arches of rectangular section allowed the bays to exist as discrete, but 28. It had been thought that work on the transept and choir was delayed until after 1236, when Bishop Geoffroy d'Eu issued a charter intended to expedite the establishment of the church of Saint-Firmin on the site to the northwest of the cathedral occupied by the hospital (Hotel Dieu) of Saint-Jean. Saint-Firmin, a church belonging to the episcopal group, is thought to have occupied a site to the north and east of the cathedral; see G. Durand, Monographie, I, 19. A. Erlande-Bran- denburg, La facade, 260, even suggested that Saint-Firmin occupied a site on the axis of the Gothic choir, and that the start of work on the transept and choir was delayed until 1238-1241. However, a careful reading of the 1236 charter reveals that the precise date of the demolition of the church of Saint-Firmin is never defined-it is merely referred to in a past tense: oportebat ecclesiam beati Firmini confessoris matricis suae cedere fundamentis ("it was appropriate that the church of Saint-Firmin should yield to the foundations of its mother [the cathedral church of Notre- Dame]"); see Gallia Christiana X, col. 342, item LXVIII. The provisions allowing the parishioners and canons of Saint-Firmin to find alternative spaces for the celebration of the mass were set up before 1222, and it was therefore quite possible to demolish the church at this early date. On the other hand, the site of the Gothic cathedral choir was encum- bered by the remains of the old Gallo-Roman wall and city ditch, now rendered obsolete by the construction of the new city wall built under King Philip Augustus. On the topography of the site, see the article by Foucart cited in n. 4. The lowest parts of the walls of the choir (up to the window sill) seem to follow directly after the earliest work in the facades and west aisle of the transept arms and nave. The chapel of the conversion of Saint Paul, on the east side of the south transept, was founded as early as 1233; see Cartulaire du chapitre de la cathedrale d'Amiens, Memoires de la Societe des Antiquaires de Picardie, XIV, 1905, 279-289. This thesis will be explored in greater detail in S.

The more linear effect of the new kind of triangular arch section tends to break down the clear differen- tiation between transverse arch and diagonal rib, and to allow the bays to flow together more easily. This change, introduced, we believe, in the mid-1230s, preceded a mass of other inno- vations appearing in the upper parts of Amiens Cathedral in the years around 1240-openwork flyers, reduced mass in the flying buttress uprights, bar tracery in the triforium of the east side of the transept and choir (plate tracery is used in the triforium of the nave and west side of the transept), the glazed triforium, and new decorative forms. The real contrast in Amiens Cathe- dral is not between the nave and the choir, but between the lower and upper parts, and this is particularly true in the choir, where the lower walls of the straight bays were begun very soon after the nave, probably in the mid-1220s. The changes introduced in the 1240s do not affect the plan of the cathedral, but they do modify the effects of space and light, and they certainly exacerbated structural difficulties already inherent in the extra-wide spacing of the bays adjacent to the crossing. Structural implications It is always assumed that the basic vision of Amiens Cathedral was a structurally sound one. However, the widened bays ad- jacent to the crossing created abnormally heavy lateral thrusts that buckled the crossing piers at the level of the main arcade (Fig. 17). The situation was exacerbated by the use of relatively thin supports in conjunction with a relatively thick arcade wall. In the period around 1500 acute difficulties were experienced in the area around the transept crossing and in the upper choir. Appropriate remedies for these difficulties were discussed in a series of chapter meetings, and copies of these deliberations are preserved in the Municipal Library.29 The first deliberation, dated 1497, relates to an expertise carried out by the master mason Pierre Tarissel and several colleagues on the main piers of the crossing, which were found to be "bent and bowed on one side and the other by the thrust of the first [aisle] vaults and also the adjacent bays of wall [of the main arcade] are broken and opened because of the said thrusts, and similarly the bays of the walls [of the main arcade] toward the principal portals of the nave [i.e., to the west] are broken...." The gaping vertical fissures in the main arcade bays adjacent to the crossing 29. Bibliotheque d'Amiens, MS 563, 226r?-229ro. See also G.

Amiens Cathedral, view of north ambulatory vaults. are visible to this day. In order to prevent the tendency of the crossing piers to bow inward under the thrust of the adjacent bays of the main arcade, the experts recommended that great chains of Spanish iron should be installed along the pavement of the triforium passage and that these chains should run right through the masonry of the main piers of the crossing and be terminated by pegs or anchors that would act as retainers. The chains, made up of a series of linked iron bars c. 0.08 m. by 0.0375 m. in section, were installed as recommended, and run the entire length of the nave and each of the transept arms. In the choir, they continue to the base of the hemicycle. Structural distortions at the level of the triforium and clere- story were also experienced. This resulted partly from the fact that the outward thrust of the crossing arches and vault is not met by flying buttresses, but by the adjacent arches of the clere- story windows, which were placed rather too high. Moreover, there may have already existed a crossing tower that would add to the problems experienced in the upper crossing piers. The design of the glazed triforium in the east side of the transept arms tended to remove much of the lateral bracing necessary to support the flanks of the upper piers. These problems led to considerable diagonal movement in the upper transept arms,</page><page sequence="26">MURRAY AND ADDISS: PLAN AND SPACE AT AMIENS CATHEDRAL 63 which are relatively short and are not terminated by massive masonry in the form of towers at the transept facades. This diagonal movement, already evident in the 13th century, pro- duced dislocation, and required the rebuilding of parts of the tracery of the outer skin of the triforium; it caused the upper parts of both transept facades to fail, necessitating the installation of new and reinforced tracery. The deficiency of the new open- work flyers, first introduced in the 1240s on the west sides of the transept arms, also contributed to this failure. As a result of structural difficulties already apparent during construction of the upper transept, the design of the flyers was quickly modified, and additional tracery elements were introduced in the later work on the east side of the transept arms and in the straight bays of the upper choir.30 Thus, we should conclude that the serious structural problems encountered at Amiens Cathedral in the late middle ages were due not only to the innovations introduced in the 1240s (glazed triforium, openwork flyers, bar tracery) but also to the initial vision embodied in the plan of Robert de Luzarches. Of critical importance were the oversized bays adjacent to the crossing that create such a spectacular visual effect, but which contributed to the inward buckling of the crossing piers noted by the experts who visited the cathedral in 1497. The relative slenderness of the supports and thickness of the arcade wall at Amiens also contributed to the problem. Conclusion We should close by returning to a question posed at the start: does some geometric master plan lie behind the characteristic spatial effects of Amiens Cathedral? If the irregularity of the bays of the transept arms and choir indicates that the modular system found in the five bays of the nave was not applied throughout the building, was any proportional system used to determine the overall lengths of the nave and the choir? Such an overall scheme was proposed by N. L. Prak, who believed that the major spans of the building could be under- stood in terms of multiples of a royal foot (he does not specify the length of this foot, but one assumes that he means a unit 30. The chronology proposed here is quite different from that pub- lished most recently in the Histoire d'Amiens, cowritten byJ.-L. Cadoux, P. Desportes, D. Duverlie, C. Engrand, R. Hubscher, P. Oudart, and M.-L. Pelus, Toulouse, 1986, 74-78. Deceived by the presence of Late Gothic tracery in the upper transept fasades, the authors, like most previous students of Amiens Cathedral, concluded that the upper choir was finished before the upper transept, which remained unfinished (they believed) until the late middle ages. In fact, ragged masonry breaks around the windows of the upper faSades in north and south transept arms reveal that the present tracery is not original. It is probable that the original composition embodied very slender Rayonnant forms that failed. Both fasades were reworked and reinforced in the 14th century, and the south transept rose was redone again soon after 1500. G. Durand has very little to say on the subject; see Monographie, I, 47 and 63. of around 0.3247 m.).31 In the nave he found a great rectangle of 100 by 140 feet, embodying the relationship of five to seven. Each of the choir aisles is a rectangle of half these dimensions, 50 by 70 feet. It follows that the overall length of the choir (straight bays) is exactly one half of the nave. Prak was convinced that relationships in the plan were purely arithmetic (in the order of 5:7) rather than geometric. He concluded that pro- portional relationships were used mainly for practical rather than for any philosophical reasons. Prak's valuable study has, as far as we know, never been subject to the scrutiny that his scrupulous surveying work and inter- esting conclusions warrant. Our own measurements suggest that not all of the bays can be understood in terms of exact feet or half feet as Prak would suggest. The subtle changes in the dimensions of the bays of the choir are particularly hard to fit into a rigorous system of royal feet. Moreover, Prak's conclusion that the design embodies arithmetical rather than geometrical thinking, and that arithmetic solutions were applied for practical rather than philosophical reasons, seems needlessly positivistic. Geometric versus arithmetic; practical versus philosophical- these are not necessarily mutually exclusive entities. One of the games played by the designers of a great cathedral might have been the reconciliation of arithmetic and modular systems with geometric schemes, as was demonstrated by James Ackerman in his study of the debates that accompanied the construction of Milan Cathedral.32 In this context, the relationship of five to seven found by Prak in the plan of Amiens Cathedral takes on a particular significance, since it gives us a ratio very close to one to the square root of two, a relationship defined by Euclid in his Elements (translated into Latin in the 12th century), and one which was of great interest to Gothic designers.33 Thus, it is worth returning again to the question as to whether the great rectangles first noticed by Prak in the Amiens plan might have resulted from some overall geometric scheme. Our own measurements of the lengths (east-west) of the choir and nave correspond quite closely with those of Prak, and if we use the measurements of the widths of the aisles taken in the cross- ing, we do, indeed, find rectangles with sides whose dimensions are related by the 5:7 ratio just as described by him. Such a rectangle with sides of 100 by 140 royal feet would give metric dimensions of 32.47 m. by 45.45 m.: the actual dimensions of the nave are 32.39 m. by 45.35 m.-a relatively small discrep- ancy. In the choir aisles, the ideal rectangle of 50 by 70 feet translates as 16.23 m. by 22.72 m.-in the south choir aisle the 31. N. L. Prak, "Measurements of Amiens Cathedral" as in n. 23. 32. J.

LJLJ' Fig. 24. Amiens Cathedral, suggested general schema for plan. dimensions actually correspond exactly with these, and the north choir aisle is very close: 16.31 m. by 22.68 m. However, when we look more closely at the precise way in which such rectangles correspond to the actual masonry of the nave and choir, we run into an interesting problem. Prak seems to have taken his measurements of the widths of the aisles of the nave and choir in the transept aisles; yet we have already seen that, owing to the peculiar design of the expanded bays at the corners formed by the aisles of the transept and the aisles of the nave and the choir, the actual widths of the nave and choir aisles are somewhat less than this-the plane of the glass of the windows of the aisles was about 0.10 m. inside the axis of the pier as expressed on the side toward the transept (Figs. 1 and 19). No major difference, it might seem, but one with significant implications. If we take account of the fact that the aisles of the nave and the choir are slightly narrower than the transept spans suggest, then the proportions of the rectangles in the nave and in the choir aisles change; and rather than a ratio of five to seven (1:1.4), we find relationships closer to 1:1.41, in other words, one to the square root of two. Thus, we disagree with Prak's conclusion that the ratio that fixed the relationship between the long and short side of the rectangle was necessarily a purely arithmetic one. We believe, rather, that it was geometric, as expressed in the relationship of the side of a square to its diagonal. This conclusion is particularly significant since, of course, the great square that generates this diagonal is actually present in the building in the form of the extended crossing (the crossing plus the enlarged adjacent bays on each side, Fig. 24). The diagonal across this square gives the length of the nave and of the choir to the first bay of the axial chapel. One half of this diagonal will give the length of the straight bays of the choir. The nave is thus formed by a great rectangle whose sides embody the ratio of one to the square root of two. East of the great square of the extended crossing, the main vessel of the choir plus the inner aisles (straight bays) also forms such a rectangle, but of half the size. A smaller rectangle of the same proportion is found in each of the double aisles of the choir (Fig. 25).34 Thus, the concept of space inherent in the mind of the de- signer of Amiens Cathedral involves the juxtaposition of the repetitive and modular system of the nave with the dynamic geometry resulting from the use of the diagonal of the square of the extended crossing. He has created great geometric units (circles, squares, rectangles) that function in the way that we 34. However, it is necessary to reiterate that the overall scheme that generates the lengths and proportions of the nave and choir from the "extended crossing" (crossing plus adjacent bays to north, south, east and west) was not rigidly imposed. Thus, the extended crossing is not perfectly square, the result of the fact that the transept aisles are narrower than the aisles of the nave or choir. It is also evident that the entire north nave aisle is somewhat narrower than the south one, and the north choir aisle is wider than the south one; see the dimensions sum- marized in the Appendix. The design of the piers in the angles of the aisles of the transept and the nave brings a slight reduction in the span of the nave; thus, the short side of the rectangle constituting the nave is a little shorter than the side of the great square. Extensive triangulation shows that the overall layout of the plan is strictly orthogonal and accurately set out. It is worth noting that the perimeter walls, probably the first part of the building, were more accurately laid out than the freestanding piers. The most significant deviations (between 6 and 10 cm.) affect the third pier from the west in the north nave arcade, and the fifth from the west in the south nave arcade, and the two choir piers west of the hemicycle in the south arcade. The errors are made up in the adjacent bays. The construction of the cathedral is thus comparable in accuracy to modern construction norms for masonry or concrete buildings. 4. --4.</page><page sequence="28">MURRAY AND ADDISS: PLAN AND SPACE AT AMIENS CATHEDRAL 65 ! l I + ... .

This is particularly true of the extended crossing square that is such a spectacular feature of the spatial experience of the visitor to Amiens Cathedral. The divisions of these spaces were deemphasized and fixed in a way that was sometimes modular and repetitive, and sometimes more em- pirical or freewheeling, as in the different bay dimensions of the transept arms and the design of the hemicycle. The cathedral was created both through geometric and arith- metic means, as well as through the physical and historical process of building.35 And into this edifice comes the visitor, whose movement energizes the spaces, transforming reality. Through his or her sense of wonder the visitor recreates the cathedral in a way that is already anticipated by the master designers, but also in a way that is peculiar to each individual. 35. An extended study of the elevation of Amiens Cathedral would reveal the same kind of interaction of geometric and arithmetic (mod- ular) thinking. Thus, the nave was designed "ad quatratum"-the great square of the extended crossing gives the height to the capitals of the main vaults. The base of the square must be placed not at pavement level, but at the top of the pier plinth, as already seen by N. L. Prak, "Measurements," 211. The height of the main piers (from the base to the abaci of the capitals of the arcade) equals the space enclosed between the arcade walls, and the same module gives the height of the top of the triforium above the capital, forming a double square. Half this module locates the band at the top of the triforium. The section of the nave aisle is close to a double square taken between colonnettes and from base to top of capital. The centers from which the pointed arches of the main vault are struck lie on the quarter points of the spring line, so that the vault heights are necessarily not modular. Half the overall height of the central vessel to the soffit of the transverse arch, however, does locate the triforium floral band. We do not have adequate space here to undertake a complete explo- ration of the problem of mensuration, and particularly the isolation of the kind of foot unit used in laying out Amiens Cathedral. Prak believed that the building was laid out in multiples of royal feet. Particularly seductive is the fact that each side of the great square of the extended crossing (and therefore the height of the main vault capitals) is close to 100 royal feet. However, we know from the local historian Jean-Baptiste Pages that the local foot unit was smaller than the royal foot; see L. Douchet, ed., Manuscrits de Pages, marchand d'Amiens, ecrits a la fin du 17T et au com- mencement du 18e siecle sur Amiens et la Picardie, 6 vols., Amiens, 1856- 1864, II, 44. Set in the wall of a house in front of the city pillory was a length of iron with the pied de la ville d'Amiens inscribed upon it. This unit equaled 1 1 /3 inches of the pied de roi-in other words, it was 0.3066 m. Measured in such units, the bays of the main vessel of the nave are very close to rectangles of 48 by 24 feet. The aisle (measured in the crossing) is 29 feet, giving a total spread of 106 feet, which equals the height of the main capitals. A foot unit of 0.2957 m. (Roman foot) divides neatly into some of the key dimensions: measured with this unit the span of the main vessel of the nave is 50 feet and the sides of the great square around 110 feet. It is worth keeping these foot units in mind as we explore the mod- ularity of the support system. The diagonal ribs are over one foot in thickness (about 0.32 m.) and the transverse arches under two feet (0.56 m.) while the main arcade is under four feet (1.20 m.) giving (very roughly) a ratio of 1:2:4. The smaller (diagonal) shafts of all attached responds are close to eight inches (local or Roman foot) in diameter (0.205 m.) while the main shafts of the responds in nave, transept and choir straight bays are 14 inches (0.375 m.) giving no direct modular relationship to the smaller shafts. In the choir aisle intermediary piers, the shafts follow a sequence from 8 to 16 to 48 local inches, giving a ratio of 1:2:6. The shafts of the ambulatory responds are 8, 16 and 24 inches, a ratio of 1:2:3. The hemicycle piers have a ratio of 1:2:5 fixing the relationship of the shafts to the central core, but with a different module of about 0.25 m. And in the main arcade the shafts have a diameter of one and a half feet, the cylindrical body of the pier is four and a half feet, and the total width (including flanking shafts) is exactly seven local feet. These were the decades in which Parisian weights, measures, and monetary units were displacing local systems in Picardy, and it is quite possible that more than one type of foot unit was in use.</page><page sequence="29">66 JSAH, XLIX:1, MARCH 1990 APPENDIX A.
