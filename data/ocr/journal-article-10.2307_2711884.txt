<plain_text><page sequence="1">DEATH AND THE INTERPRETATION OF CULTURE: A BIBLIOGRAPHIC OVERVIEW JACK GOODY African Studies Centre St. Johns College, Cambridge THE FACT OF DEATH PROVIDES A CENTRAL FOCUS AROUND WHICH HUMAN cultures develop in two main ways. Firstly, there is what we may loosely call the conceptual aspect of death; secondly, the organizational. Or to put it another, and not altogether overlapping, way, there is the anticipation of death and the actuality of death, the ideology and the interment. The first of these clusters of meaning lies at the core of much religious and indeed philosophical activity, and from it perhaps stems the whole mesh of religious beliefs. The inevitable fact of death needs to be reckoned with and accounted for; it has to be explained and to be included in a wider scheme of representations, a belief system, a religion, an ideology. In a re- cent volume on "the origins of a sense of God," J. Bowker argues that reli- gion has failed to disappear because of the great "constraint" of death; the role of religion is to find a way through this limitation to human existence.' The theme echoes Malinowski and the many scholars of previous centuries who, taking a cue from the actors themselves, stressed the link between the journey of the soul (death, survival, immortality and passage to the other world), the dualistic concept of the human being (body and spirit/soul), and the existence of spiritual beings. The theme requires little elaboration. It characterizes Euhemerist expla- nations of the origin of religion, and runs through the evolutionary schemas of 19th century scholars like Herbert Spencer and E. B. Tylor.2 Indeed it is enshrined in the latter's minimum definition of religion.3 But such specula- 'The Sense of God: Sociological, Anthropological and Psychological Approaches to the Origin of the Sense of God (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1973). 2For a fuller account see the opening chapter of Jack Goody, Death, Property and the Ancestors (Stanford: Stanford Univ.

Historically the elaborations of human burials in the Upper Palaeolithic strongly suggest the existence of a symbolic and ideological halo around the physiological facts of death, specifically in the use of red ochre, of special burial positions, and other funerary rituals. Such a set of beliefs would clearly require the elaboration of a complex system of communication which permitted the reference to "concepts" that were not physically present to the actors, in other words, a language. But whether these forms of disposing of the dead constituted in any way an "origin" of the whole complex of religious beliefs must remain guesswork, though one that fits with an acceptable logical model. But when we come to deal with the religious activities of specific societies, then the role of death and the dead is clearly of central importance. H. Sawyer has recently argued that in West African religion God is indeed the Great Ancestor.4 On another level, since death is the ultimate misfortune, religious cults that offer some hope of dealing with man's calamities, with disease and with want, inevitably have to deal with death. Herein lies a basic contradiction; such cults have not only to ward off death but also to comfort the bereaved and the dying, since mortality is a state of being both avoidable in the shorter run and inevitable in the long. Christ is at once the earthly healer and the heavenly savior. The complex of beliefs and practices surrounding death are of great significance to the sociologist and historian alike. In treating general as- pects of the "world view," the historian is inevitably handicapped because what usually persists as documentary evidence of "belief" are the written elaborations of specialists. Indeed the very fact of reducing such beliefs to writing may well have some radical influence upon them. For those working in a living society, there is the questionnaire, which often has similar disad- vantages, or, better still, the passive ear, an instrument of research whose utility is often greatly underrated. But apart from the literary reflections of priest, poet and philosopher, death leaves other material traces of which historians and sociologists have recently begun to make considerable use. In the first place we have the will, that is, testaments made in anticipation of death, which in earlier times were concerned not only with the disposition of property but also with the fate of the soul. Notable among achievements in this field has been the work of French historians of the "Annales" school, especially that of M. Vovelle. Following up the study of Daumard and Furet based on marriage contracts, a work that was central in the formation of a school of "l'histoire quantifide," Vovelle examined a large number of wills not in a search for the manner of distributing property but in order to es- 4God: Ancestor or Creator? (London: Longmann, 1970).</page><page sequence="3">450 A merican Quarterly tablish "I'histoire des mentalitds," a history of the mind rather than ideas, since he was interested in the generality of individuals and hence the over-all distribution of will-making among the population at large was of crucial im- portance. In this regard he was fortunate in his choice of 18th century Pro- vence, where even in the rural areas between 60 and 70 per cent of males and 40 to 50 per cent of females made written testaments, as compared with less than 20 per cent around Lyon.5 Looking at the spiritual testaments that de- veloped as part of the will after the Counter-Reformation, Vovelle attempts to assess the popular mind. The spiritual element has certain formulaic qualities about it, repeated in will after will over determined geographical areas. But the formulas are not fossilized; they change over time, and hence can be used, Vovelle argues, to reconstruct changing attitudes to death. This examination leads him to conclude that there was a profound change in the collective sensibility during the 18th century, the century of the Enlightenment, which he describes as "dechristianisation." As compared with the Baroque world which preceded it, men were less confident of their passage to the other world, and more concerned with the physical aspects of death. Such changing attitudes are linked with the changing position of women and with changing attitudes within the family.6 Similar kinds of study can be carried out on other of the material remains that the advent and actuality of death leave behind. The analysis of grave goods is central to reconstructions of prehistoric societies, where they throw light on technology, stratification and migration as well as indicating attitudes toward death. Apart from grave goods, there are the markers of graves, tombstones, which in literate societies offer a rich harvest of biographical and sometimes attitudinal material. Using the inscriptions on Roman tombstones K. Hopkins and earlier writers have made a useful contribution to social and demographic studies.7 In many societies funerary artifacts also take a more artistic form, playing a major part in the history of art. The impetus is to preserve some material memorial of the dead, part of his physical being, then an object such as the stool he sat on, imbued with 5G. and M.

Vovelle, PiWte baroque et dechristianisation en Provence au XVIIIe sikcle (Paris: Plon, 1973). The same kind of variation is encountered with written marriage contracts, the figure of 50 per cent in Paris contrasting with the rare occurrence in Normandy. It should be added that the testators are often themselves illiterate; at the beginning of the century some 31-38 per cent of men sign their wills, only 15 per cent of women (Vovelle, 1969, p. 606), and there is little change by the time of the Revolution.

The nature of the physical memorial varied from the ancestral tablets of traditional China to the stools of Ashanti, the clay pots of the Tallensi to the simple anthropomorphic shrines of the LoDagaa, and the completely naturalistic heads of bronze that played a part in the worship of royal ances- tors in Ife and in Benin.9 In Africa the religious significance of wood carving, bronze casting and sculpture hardly needs comment; much of this centers around the dead. These material objects, significant in themselves for the study of religion and the history of art, have also been used as indices of social attitudes. The style of the bronze heads of Benin kings became increasingly decorated and florid, a change which Bradbury sees as going hand in hand with the greater centralization in the state, the greater isolation of the monarch. In Pro- vence, G. and M. Vovelle have traced changes in the iconography of altar- pieces of chapels for souls in purgatory between the 15th and 20th centuries, changes which they see as indicating shifts in the collective sensibility; for example, during the course of the 19th century, the souls in purgatory are not simply recipients of the prayers of the living, rather they are acting as mediators with the deity; there is a shift from service to serving. 10 It is not only in the sphere of the graphic arts that funerals have had an influence on creative activity. Without wishing to espouse a theory of the 8See, for example, W. A. Douglass, Death in Murelaga: Funerary Ritual in a Spanish Basque Village (Seattle: Univ. of Washington Press, 1969), p. 140: "There is one Basque custom that does serve to preserve the memory of specific individuals.

This is particularly true in oral cul- tures where the funeral sums up, in a significant way, the past history as well as the social relations of the man who died. In other words the obituary is acted out, as indeed are many of his closest ties." The result is a dramatic performance utilizing standardized incidents in the past life of the deceased or the methods of punishment to be meted out to those who had harmed him. For the funeral is often an inquest as well as an interment, a pointer to revenge against a supposed killer or to ways of warding off death in general. We can look at the rituals and beliefs of death not only to get an idea of collective attitudes toward the other world, beliefs about spiritual beings and the fate of the soul, or indeed bereavement, that is, the individual's reaction to loss. We can also examine them to throw light upon the rela- tions between members of the social group, whether living or dead. For be- havior at funerals is often the occasion for revealing not only details of indi- vidual life histories, "family secrets" otherwise hidden, but also the generalized attitudes, both positive and negative, characteristic of the ac- tors in the funeral drama, husband and wife, father and son, mother and daughter, brother and sister. Such attitudes are brought out with greatest clarity in matters dealing with the transmission of relatively exclusive rights, whether pertaining to material property or to less tangible possessions such as roles and offices. We can look at such transfers from two angles, firstly from the relational one, secondly from the wider standpoint of the community and the transmission of the basic means of production. For in pre-industrial societies, and often in industrial ones, inheritance has to do with control of "the commanding heights of the economy," being the major way of transferring land and small enterprises. The fact that such transfers are usually between kin helps to perpetuate certain forms of social differentiation and turn it into a "class" system. On the relational level, interpersonal tensions are often revealed in the course of the funeral ceremonies both in generalized and in individual form. Expression is often given, again in the customary or personal form, to the kind of ambivalent attitudes toward the death of close relatives that is epitomized in the words spoken by Mark Anthony, when in the midst of his affair with Cleopatra, he hears of the death of his wife, Fulvia. There's a great spirit gone! Thus did I desire it: What our contempts do often hurl from us, We wish it ours again; the present pleasure, By revolution lowering, does become "1E.g., Goody (1962), p. 129.</page><page sequence="6">Death and the Interpretation of Culture 453 The opposite of itself: she's good, being gone; The hand could pluck her back that shov'd her on. (Anthony and Cleopatra, I, ii, 123-28) The incidence of these tensions, that is, the particular relationships within which they fall, will vary with the particular mode of transmission. Let us consider first the transfer of office. Where succession occurs at death, the funeral (or the death itself) may well be the occasion for the installation of a successor. Hereditary succession, involving the passage of office between kin, varies in several ways. For example, there is the extent of dynastic eligi- bility: narrow dynasties, such as characterized modern Europe, entailed the continual shedding of the more distant members; while mass dynasties of the Anglo-Saxon type (widespread in Africa) involved election or rotation between segments.'2 In the first case the inevitable tensions between the in- cumbent and his successor fall between close kin, while in the latter, such relationships are relatively free of potential conflict on this score. Systems of inheritance also differ in the laterality (i.e. whether siblings are eligible), in direction (partrilineal or matrilineal) and in the eligibility of women. Each of these variables, which are interconnected in various ways, shifts the balance of interfamilial tensions in critical ways, ways that are often given explicit expression in the funeral ceremonies, or in less formal behavior that surrounds the death, providing an insight into the innermost reaches of family cleavages and solidarities. Of this the reader of English detective fiction needs hardly to be reminded. Where would the investigators or indeed the plot get were one unable to ask the question, which of the in- terested parties stood to lose or gain by the death? There are many problems in the analysis of societies that are related to variations in the mode of transmission. For example, where the family farm, the industrial enterprise or in Lear's case the kingdom, is passed on before the death of the holder, his situation is inevitably more precarious and very precise arrangements are often made for his continuing support. Does this early handing over also affect the attitude of the survivors to his death or indeed to death in general? Is this reflected in mortuary custom or funerary monument? Is the relatively small attention given to funerals in contemporary societies related to the earlier establishment of one's descen- dants, to the non-familial avenues for placement and opportunity, the state schemes for the maintenance of the old and the bureaucratic procedures for retirement? Why is it that in the present day funerals are of much less significance than in earlier times and in other cultures, the main spheres of the work of the social historian and the social anthropologist? The reason is simple. '2Jack Goody, ed., Succession to High Office (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1968).</page><page sequence="7">454 A merican Quarterly Today funerals have so much less work to do. There is the sense of personal loss to be dealt with. But bereavement is more personal and less a matter for joint participation, given that local ties are limited by frequent change of residence (mobility), by the diversity of work (division of labor, partici- pation in different enterprises), and sometimes by the deliberate search for anonymous neighbors that marks many urban areas. The lack of com- munitas, of gemeinschaft, the growth of individualism, involves a certain withdrawal from each other's personal problems including their deaths and their dead, unless these occur within the context of national calamity. Aligned with this change is the shift of responsibility, even for one's own parents and children, onto the resources of the state rather than of the indi- vidual or even of the community. The individual's links run direct to the state, mediated by income tax officials and the appropriate ministry, rather than by kith or kin. Hence only the bare bones of death are seen today in Western societies. With smaller households and low mortality, each individual experiences a close death very infrequently, if we understand close in both a spatial and social sense. In childhood, one is often kept away from the immediate facts of death, either by parents (if it is a sibling) or by relatives or friends, if it is a parent. Grief is suppressed rather than externalized. As an adult, one is immediately concerned only with the death of spouses (usually husbands, because of differential marriage ages) and parents (usually the father first, followed by the mother); even the deaths of siblings, separated by space and by sentiment, take on little significance. Indeed they often assume less importance than the funerals of work colleagues and even of national leaders. This has not always been so, nor is it necessarily so in contemporary so- ciety. There are important class differences, not simply related to mobility; and there are important cultural differences, even in the urban setting. It is more common in the United States than in England to see the kind of an- nouncement that one finds so often in the New York Times: "The Alumni Association Academy Mt. Saint Vincent, Tuxedo Park, records with deep sorrow the untimely death of its beloved member and extends its deepest sympathy to the members of her family." Here the associations to which an individual belongs announce their loss, not simply by representation at the funeral but by public advertisement. In Israel, the epitome of the associa- tional state, the newspapers are filled with large displays from the members of the same associations, while the bereavement of more important national figures receives attention from state corporations, office workers and private individuals who can afford to take the advertising space in news- papers. The extent of the consumption in funerals and their expense, a fact to which social reformers have often devoted attention, has always been an important aspect of domestic and societal economy.</page><page sequence="8">Death and the Interpretation of Culture 455 The fact of death still provides the theme for much human contemplation and social action; it gives rise to an area of human behavior where the in- terests of both Marx and Freud are equally relevant, where the analysis of both economic and psychological variables is called for. It is the most critical, the most final, of crisis situations, which capitalizes culture and social organization for actor and observer alike.
