<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Embodied Animal Mind   and Hand-Signing Chimpanzees kelvin j. booth Thompson Rivers University chimpanzee language studies have generated much heated controversy,  as Roger Fouts can attest from firsthand experience. Perhaps this is because  language is usually considered to be what truly distinguishes humans from  apes. If chimps can indeed be taught the rudiments of language, then the  difference between them and us is not as great as we might have thought. It  is a matter of degree rather than kind, a continuity, and our species is not so  special after all. The advantage of this continuity thesis, as Fouts has empha- sized, is that it conforms to the general tenets of evolutionary theory, and  fits well with the evidence from paleontology and genetics that suggests that  apes and humans are close cousins. It also has profound implications for the  way we treat our primate relatives.  Opposed to continuity theories are those who posit a discontinuity be- tween humans and apes, perhaps due to a “language instinct” (e.g., Pinker) or  a specialized cognitive module. The advantage of this view is that it accords  with prima facie observations that we humans are unique in our cognitive  abilities, our complex cultures, our desire for meaning, our fondness for sto- ries and rituals, and our tendency to ponder our ultimate fate. The problem  with the discontinuity view is that it lacks an evolutionary explanation of  how a new instinct or module arises, or exactly what these might be in terms  of human biology. Perhaps more importantly, and as Fouts has pointed out,  it tends to support the view that humans are special, and consequently rein- forces, particularly in Western cultures, our domination over other species.  Parallel to the continuity-discontinuity debate is a dispute over how  to interpret complex animal behavior. There are those who insist on being  hard-nosed and, in the name of being scientific, avoid all mentalistic terms.  But many people in both the sciences and humanities find such paradigms  too restrictive to describe and understand complex animal behavior. They  the pluralist Volume 6, Number 3 Fall 2011 : pp. 25–33 25  ©2011 by the Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois Pluralist 6_3 text.indd   25 9/13/11   10:25 AM </page> <page sequence="2"> 26 the pluralist 6 : 3 2011 contend that since there is an evolutionary continuity between apes and hu- mans, apes must be cognitive creatures in much the same way that humans  are. Thus we can use terms from human folk psychology when talking about  other animals. For some, this includes talking about animal consciousness.  Fouts, I believe, is on this side of this debate.  Unfortunately, mentalistic and folk psychology views have their own  problems. One is that they usually rely on a Cartesian and Lockean view  of mind, something Fouts wisely wants to avoid. Mind is something non- physical “inside” the animal that forms representations of the outside world.  Fouts contrasts a Cartesian view with Darwinian continuity; but affirm- ing evolutionary continuity does not necessarily dispel Descartes’ delusion,  which is mind-body dualism and a representational psychology. Applying a  mentalistic folk psychology to animals risks foisting a quasi-Cartesian mind  onto our animal relatives.  The second widely acknowledged problem with a mentalistic view of ani- mals is anthropomorphism. This is where the debate can become particularly  acrimonious. Is anthropomorphism scientifically legitimate? Can it be avoided?  Is there good and bad anthropomorphism? Primatologist Sue Savage-Rum- baugh (1999) quite reasonably believes that we need to be anthropomorphic  in order to find out whether apes can develop primitive language skills (168).1  They will learn linguistic communication only if we believe they can. Imagine  a human child growing up amongst adults who treated all of her linguistic  behavior with skepticism. Anthropomorphism is also important for practical  ethics: the more we see apes as being like us, the more likely we will be to sup- port efforts to improve their conditions in captivity and protect them from  extinction in the wild. This is the important practical thrust of Fouts’s work.  Fouts is right to be in the Darwinian continuity camp. I think it likely  that researchers will eventually conclude that there is no special language in- stinct or even a distinctive cognitive module that separates human cognition  from ape cognition. Still, the differences are so vast, at least on the surface,  that they call for an explanation. This is largely lacking in continuity theories.  With Fouts and others, I also believe that we need to understand animal con- sciousness for any adequate understanding of animal life and cognition, and  for animal ethics. However, if we want to get to the bottom of ape abilities (as  well as human abilities), some anti-anthropomorphic skepticism is in order.  Eager anthropomorphism not only blurs the differences between humans and  apes; it can also obscure the genuine continuities. It also presents a potential  problem for practical ethics, for if anthropomorphic interpretations turn out  to be unsustainable in the long run, this would weaken arguments for the  Pluralist 6_3 text.indd   26 9/13/11   10:25 AM </page> <page sequence="3"> booth : Embodied Animal Mind 27 humane treatment of apes that are based on such interpretations. Besides,  as Fouts implies in his book (Fouts and Mills 372), basing an ethical stance  toward apes on human-like language skills might leave other not-so-human- like animals at a disadvantage. In short, even though I support the continuity  and consciousness sides of these debates, I see some problems.  Primate cognition is usually assessed using criteria based on human,  linguistically mediated ways of knowing. This partly derives, I would argue,  from seeing human experience as primarily an affair of knowing and think- ing. “I think, therefore I am.” We then ask if other animals can think, use  language, or are rational. I also suspect that this bias derives from a denial  and an ignorance of our own animality. Biologically, yes, we know that we  are animals, but we are not accustomed to thinking of ourselves as animals  from the inside, so to speak. We are persons, selves, thinking beings, souls  perhaps. We then wonder if there is a person-like self or thinking being be- hind the eyes of a chimp or a dog. We look for the non-animal in the ani- mal. This results in a tendency to project unconsciously a Cartesian dualism  into animal experience. The result is, paradoxically, an impoverished view of  animal experience rather than a richer one. Animal awareness may in some  ways be richer than our own just because animals do not filter their experi- ence through a layer of human-like thought and rationality.  The alternative is first to develop a sufficiently deep and nuanced under- standing of what it is to be an animal, then include more human-like cogni- tive abilities if they are required to explain animal behavior. This approach  opens up interpretations of ape-human communication that are at least as  interesting as ones based on linguistic models. It also would put the humane  treatment of animals on a more solid footing. Our compassion for animals  would be based not on a conception of their supposed “rationality,” but on  realizing that they are feeling, sensitive individuals capable of a high degree  of perceptual acuity and experiential complexity.  There are at least two promising ways of moving toward a rich view  of animality. First, we can see animal experience as immediate experience.2  Surely, if there is any part of human experience that is similar to other ani- mals’, it is our pre-linguistic, pre-reflective immediate experience. Insight  into the qualitative immediacy of human experience should, then, be able  to provide some insight into animal experience. This would be a fruitful  anthropomorphism. Dewey’s discussion of qualitative immediacy is a good  place to start. A second source is descriptions of intense athletic activity,  where the self is forgotten in complete absorption in the game, the ball, or  the opponent. A third source is Zen meditation, which opens the practitio- Pluralist 6_3 text.indd   27 9/13/11   10:25 AM </page> <page sequence="4"> 28 the pluralist 6 : 3 2011 ner to aspects of experience that are prior to language and prior to a sense  of an individuated self.  Buddhism teaches that there is no substantial mind or self. This puts it  in stark contrast to Cartesianism. In Zen meditation the reflective activity  of the self ceases. When reflective activity ceases, the self ceases to be a self.  At that point there is no difference between, say, the person hearing a sound  and the sound that is heard. Dogen says that, “Since there is no mind in me,  when I hear the sound of raindrops from the cave, the raindrop is myself ”  (Laycock 396). This, I would argue, characterizes animal mind. The animal  is fully engaged in the world, so that the world is the animal’s mind. This  full engagement also characterizes Zen action. T. P. Kasulis likens Zen ac- tion to the pre-conceptual responsiveness of a major league batter. The batter  is absorbed in directed concentration, but without self-consciousness. The  ball player focuses totally on the ball, and “merely waits, poised to respond  to the virtually infinite number of paths the ball might follow” (Kasulis 58).  The response to the ball as it arrives is immediate and spontaneous with no  thought of self. I suggest that animal action is Zen action, and not just oc- casionally, but all the time. Animal action-mind always throws itself into  responsive relationships with those things it must secure or avoid, and with  other individuals in its social world. The animal exerts focused effort with no  distance between mind and world, or between mind and other individuals.  The second resource for developing a rich view of animality is recent  work in embodied mind and the “lived body.” The animal body is a lived  body. The lived body is not an object of awareness; it is the body that is “do- ing the awaring”—the body as subject. The subject body is not the body we  have, says Shigenori Nagatomo, it is the body we are (6). This notion of the  body completely undercuts the Cartesian dualism of body and mind. The  body, not the mind, is the “epistemic center of consciousness” (Nagatomo 5).  Parts of the animal body—an ape’s hands, for instance—can become objects  to its consciousness, but the animal body as a whole cannot be an object of  its own awareness. Regardless of how big a part of the body is taken as an  object, there is always part of the body that does not enter into the body  image, and there is the standpoint that is aware of the body-part-as-object.  This standpoint is the subject body. It is the felt unity from which things are  perceived. The animal does not, then, make the distinction between a total  self-as-object and environment. It is not a self-as-object to itself.  Shaun Gallagher distinguishes between body image and body schema.  The body image is the body as an object of awareness. The body schema is  a “system of sensory-motor capacities” that function without becoming an  Pluralist 6_3 text.indd   28 9/13/11   10:25 AM </page> <page sequence="5"> booth : Embodied Animal Mind 29 object of awareness (24). The body schema is not static; it is a dynamic ca- pacity for movement, and movement is fundamental to animal life. Maxine  Sheets-Johnstone refers to a “primal animation” that is the ground of animal  experience and sense-making (xxiv, 261). If animals can be said to think, they  think in terms of movement.  Movement is anticipatory. As the animal moves toward the completion  of an act, it anticipates events as they emerge. Movement can only be coor- dinated if anticipations are constantly being integrated into ongoing activity.  To catch a ball, I anticipate its trajectory. To catch a rabbit, a coyote must  anticipate its movement and make continual adjustments. For a chimpanzee  to interact with its human caretakers, it must try to anticipate human behav- ior. We approach a household appliance with an organized set of expectations  and are prepared to use the appliance before we reach it. Likewise when a  chimpanzee approaches food or a social situation, it is prepared to respond to  probable conditions. It might pick up a useful-looking stone on the way to a  nut-cracking site, or solicit the company of a friend when expecting conflict.  When the animal encounters something unexpected and its activity is  interrupted, there is an “impulsion” to complete the interrupted act. Hab- its probe the situation as kinesthetic and perceptual anticipations. The live  creature, says Dewey, anticipates its future as “possibilities that are felt as pos- sessions of what is now and here” (24). There may be some rather hesitant  moves as the organism “tries out” responses, anticipating their outcomes.  There is a “welcoming and rejecting” of felt possibilities (Mead, “Definition”  24). Eventually a definite course of activity is recovered. This process con- stitutes embodied animal thinking. Anticipations are not “mental,” they are  bodily and behavioral. They are felt possibilities of movement in the subject  body. The animate creature does not think of its movements; it thinks with  its movements (Sheets-Johnstone 265). Its thinking is actually a form of in- cipient movement of the body schema.  The ape subject-body is a social body. Chimpanzee society is an inter- corporeal affair, or as Barbara King (2005) describes it, a social dance.3 It is a  scene of bodies in relationships of movement and anticipation. We need to  resist the strong temptation of a Cartesian psychology when we are consider- ing primate social life. In the immediacy of animal social experience, there is  no separation between subject and object, or consciousness and content; there  is no separate animal self or mind that interacts with other separate selves or  minds. Recall Dogen saying that, since there is no mind in me, when I hear  the raindrop, the raindrop is myself. When the animal perceives and responds  to another individual, the movement of that other individual is the perceiv- Pluralist 6_3 text.indd   29 9/13/11   10:25 AM </page> <page sequence="6"> 30 the pluralist 6 : 3 2011 ing animal’s mind. Just as the professional ballplayer is totally absorbed in  the oncoming ball, the animal is totally absorbed in its social relationships  and focused on the movements of others.  Returning to the dance metaphor, dance partners are sensitively attuned  to each other’s movements. One dance instructor quoted by King describes  how an attuned dancer is sensitive to subtle changes in the partner’s move- ments such as “a tilt of the head, a change in the level of the hand hold, a  general weight shift” (1). King argues that this is the kind of sensitivity that  apes have to the movements of their groupmates. There is a “mutual attun- ement,” which she and Stuart Shankar call “co-regulation” (Shankar and King  606). In this mutual attunement, perception and response are simultaneous.  As one animal adjusts to the other’s movements, the other is adjusting to  the movements of the first. The movement of the two animals is a single  dynamic system of mutual adjustment. It is important to note that when  two humans are dancing together, they do not have to understand what is  going on in the partner’s mind. To do so would result in awkwardness and a  lack of responsiveness. If the dancers are completely absorbed in the dance  without self-consciousness, then there is nothing going on “in” their minds  except the actual dance itself. This mutual absorption in immediate bodily  experience forms the context of ape gestures.  A gesture, in Mead’s terms, is any movement of one animal that is re- sponded to by another. A conversation of gestures is the mutual adjustment  of two animals moving in response to each other—King’s social dance. A  conversation of gestures gives rise to what we could call “gestural meaning”  as distinct from symbolic meaning. The gesture of one animal “means” the  outcome of the social act to the other. As Mead points out (Mind, Self 75+,  145), the gesturing animal is not conscious of this meaning. That is, it does  not respond to its own gestures from the standpoint of the other animal. This  is because it is completely involved in responding to the movements of the  other rather than its own movements. There is no space for an interceding  self to reflect on its own meaning. Thus the gesture is not, in Mead’s terms,  symbolic.4 The gesture is not picked out as a separate social object. Rather,  it is part of the felt capacity of the body schema or subject-body.  Even though a gesture is not symbolic in Mead’s sense, it can still be  intentionally directed toward another with the expectation of the other’s  response, as a dancer might direct her movements toward a partner. For  instance, chimpanzee gestures to initiate grooming or playing are clearly di- rected toward others and are under intentional control. Apes also learn that  Pluralist 6_3 text.indd   30 9/13/11   10:25 AM </page> <page sequence="7"> booth : Embodied Animal Mind 31 another ape must be facing in its direction if its gesture is to have the desired  effect. But directing gestures to another who is facing toward the gesturing  individual does not require an ape to understand others as experiencing be- ings; these gestures are more like the movements of dance partners who know  from experience that they must be facing each other for the dance to work.  In Mead’s view, being able to understand others as being centers of conscious  experience is crucial to symbolic language.  Like other ape gestures, hand-signing is a social dance of immediate  experience and mutual attunement. The hands are a channel of intentional  movement through which the animal acts in order to initiate a movement  in its communication partner. The ape is immersed completely and selflessly  in the relationship, sensitive to subtle movements of the other in a dynamic  system of mutual adjustment. As it signs, it has expectations of the move- ments of the other that it integrates into its own ongoing activity. In complex  situations, an ape might “think” by moving its hands overtly or covertly as it  organizes its anticipations in response to its situation.5 This does not require  the gestures to be symbols in Mead’s sense, although they are symbols for  their human caretakers.  There is no doubt that some ape behavior, especially in individuals raised  in close human contact, suggests the ability to take the standpoint of the other.  Unfortunately, this is difficult to establish one way or the other. One clear  indicator would be what Michael Tomasello has called “declarative pointing,”  which appears in early human childhood. This is pointing simply to show  something to another person and have that person share a perspective. Most,  and perhaps all, ape pointing is “imperative pointing.” Apes learn that point- ing gestures will cause humans to get them what they want. This does not  require that apes understand others as experiencing beings like themselves. To  have this understanding, they would have to become objects to themselves.  What exactly would that object be? Not the object-body, but the very subject  that experiences. That is, apes would have to objectify their own subjectivity  so that they can objectify the subjectivity of others.6  If we cannot know for sure that apes cannot take the standpoint of the  other, we could, of course, assume that they can and that their communica- tion is symbolic. The problem is, this would prevent us from asking how they  might be communicating using hand signs without this ability. This could  be a very important question. If, in lacking clear evidence, we take the skep- tical position, we can ask what it is about human animality that is different  from yet continuous with primate animality that gives us this ability, and  Pluralist 6_3 text.indd   31 9/13/11   10:25 AM </page> <page sequence="8"> 32 the pluralist 6 : 3 2011 consequently enables us to use language easily and spontaneously. Finally, we  should remember that just because other primates cannot take the standpoint  of the other—a trick that gets humans into all sorts of difficulties involving  self-objectification—does not mean they are not worthy of our profound  respect as conscious and highly sensitive beings with an extraordinary degree  of animal intelligence. notes  1. Savage-Rumbaugh complains that her critics have a double standard when it comes to  interpreting ape language research. When reporting behaviors that are similar in children  and apes, researchers are expected to assume linguistic abilities in children but assume a  lack of linguistic abilities in apes.  2. By the term “immediate experience,” I have in mind Dewey’s notion of immediacy,  especially as discussed in chapters 3 and 8 of Experience and Nature. “Immediate” does  not mean non-temporal. Temporality can be experienced immediately as a qualitative  sense of what has happened and what is expected to happen. Anticipation, discussed in  the paragraphs following, is part of immediately experienced temporality.  3. See also Sheets-Johnstone 483–526.  4. See Mind, Self and Society chapters 10 and 11 for Mead’s discussion of the difference  between meaning and the consciousness of meaning. Symbolic communication is found  only in the latter. (In Mind, Self, Mead uses terms like “mind” and “consciousness” in a  much more restricted way than I am using them in the present article.)  Like Mead, primatologist and developmental psychologist Michael Tomasello claims  that one chimp gesturing to another would not comprehend that same gesture directed  toward itself by another chimp as indicating the same intention. He says that their ges- tures are therefore not symbolic (Tomasello 282). “[T]hey would not understand their  own gestures as reciprocal communicative symbols, but rather as acts that produce cer- tain predictable reactions in others, and they would understand the gestures of others  as simple indications of their impending behavior.” Tomasello thinks that “[t]he reason  that chimpanzees’ intentional gestures are not symbolic . . . is that chimpanzees do not  understand the behavior of others intentionally. . . . [T]hey do not understand that  other chimpanzees may have intentional relations to outside entities” (282). He thinks  that chimp gestures that are not understood reciprocally are best called “signals,” not  “symbols.” Signals are spurs to action of another individual, not intentional devices that  could be adopted by the self when needed.  5. A chimpanzee might also move its hands in its sleep, as Fouts has reported. This is  likely similar to cats and dogs moving in their sleep, apparently dreaming. But this does  not mean that chimps are symbolically talking to themselves in their sleep.  6. Those who assert that apes can take the standpoint of the other (or in contemporary  terms, that apes have a “theory of mind”) rarely if ever consider that the animal would  have to objectify its own subjectivity, and what a tricky business that might be. What  might that mean for the animal’s own experience? Would they experience shame and  embarrassment? If this realization is robust, it might dawn on them that other ape-selves  die, and thus their own self can come to an end. Being able to objectify one’s own sub- jectivity is a very complex and mixed blessing.
