Introduction Of all the gods and goddesses of the Hindu pantheon, Gaçesa is the most interesting, not only on account of his importance, but also because of his iconographical peculiarities. He is depicted with an elephant's head, a bulging belly and in a variety of poses. In point of time the god is supposed to be a late addition to the group of Brahmanical deities but, at the same time, it is noteworthy that he achieves a very exalted position in the hierarchy of gods and goddesses within a very short space of time. The general opinion seems to favour the view that his worship began sometime in the 6th century A. D. and during the following two or three centuries we witness his rapid rise to prominence, so much so, that by the tenth century an independent sect - albeit within the fold of Hinduism - commonly known as the GSnapa- tya, comes into being.1 Ganeša was also borrowed by other religious systems such as Buddhism and Jainism, and his worship spread almost all over Asia where Buddhism and Hinduism became living faiths. Gaçesa is still accorded a very high position by Hindus and it is one of the most important deities worshipped in India today. * R. G. Bhandarkar Anniversary Address delivered on Rsipañcaml, 5th September 1989. 1 R. G. Bhandarkar, Vaisnavism, " Šaivism and Minor Religious Systems (Strass- burg 1913 ), p. 145-50. "</page><page sequence="2">2 Annals BORI, LXXI ( 1990 ) The origin of this extremely popular god is shrouded in mystery inspite of the painstaking researches by scholars, and it is surprising that even though there exists such a vast plethora of evidences - literary, archaeological and otherwise - we do not know anything precisely about the origin of Ganeša. His images have been found even in the remotest corners of India and there is also a considerable mass of literary evidence which furnishes us with a variety of legends regarding the origin of the god. They make the confusion worse confounded and appear to be imaginary. A critical analysis of these legends would show that they in fact suppress more than what they reveal, and the student is left with the impression that the ancient writers were at great pains in explaining the mysterious origin of the elephant-headed deity. The sculptural evidence that has so far been considered by scholars is all datable to the late Gupta and the post-Gupta periods from 6th century onwards. So far as the literary evidence is concerned it is necessary to be cautious at every stage for it is common knowledge that, while dealing with the Purãnic evidence we are not on a firmer ground. This makes the task of tracing the origin of Ganeša well nigh impossible. Another important factor that should be especially emphasized is that Ganeša, as the leader of the Ganas on the one hand and the elephant-headed deity on the other, are very often confused. Although Ganapati, Ganeša and Gajãnana are one and the same today, they were not identical in the ancient past. This has led some scholars to trace the worship of the god in the well known Ganapati-Atharvašírsa of Vedic literature. This is obviously addressed to Brahmanaspati in the usual formula of the standardised GSyatrl.* Even Ganeša's reputation for wisdom was born of a confusion between Ganeša and Brahmanaspati, the Vedic god of wisdom.3 Furthermore, even in the Vedic literature there are some portions which are undoubtedly of a later period and can therefore be taken as interpolations. In the šatarudríya text of the Maitrayanï Samhitã which belongs to the ť Black Yajurveda ' school we come across the epithets of Rudra as karata ( one having the ears of an elephant ), hasti-mukha ( elephant-faced), and dantin ( one with tusks ).4 It is needless to state that here we already very clearly have a vivid description of an elephant-headed deity which is none else but the Ganeša-Gajanana of the medieval period. But this particular passage of the Taittiriya Äranyaka is rightly supposed to be a very late interpolation which was possibly effected in 2 J. N.

D.5 when the Gãnapatya sect was gradually coming into prominence. This demonstrates that we cannot depend much on literary evidence unless it is reliable, and what is therefore necessary is to carefully examine the available archaeological evidence in the first ins- tance, and then compare it with the literary evidence. In fact it was the study of these sources which prompted the writer to trace the origin of this curious and interesting god and the conclusions which followed have led him to show that the existing theories regarding the origin of the god are no longer tenable in the light of the available archaeological evidence. The present paper therefore is an attempt to demonstrate that we can definitely trace the origin of Ganeša, the elephant-headed god, as also the different stages of his rise into prominence, his identification with the Lord of the Ganas on the one hand and Vinãyaka on the other and finally his borro wal by the Buddhists and the Jainas. II. Early Sculptures The worship of Ganeša, the elephant-headed deity, in the post-Gupta period is an established fact. This has been conclusively proved by the evidence furnished by an inscription on an ancient column at Ghatiala near Jodhpur (Rajasthan). The inscription is dated 862 A. D. (V. S. 918 ) and has been taken to be the earliest of its kind in the praise of the elephant- headed god . &gt; The column is crowned by four images of Ganeša, seated back to back and facing the four cardinal points. This shows that by 862 A. D. Ganeša, in the form of the elephant-headed god, had risen to that exalted position where he was worshipped independently and invocated for success^ Earlier images of the god are met with in the rock-cut temples at Elephanta Ellora and Badami in Western India. The images of Ganeša ascribable to 6th century A. D. are few and far between. Noteworthy among them is the one in the Gupta temple at Bhumra ( Panna Dist. M. P. ). These images have been adequately noticed by scholars who agree that the worship of Ganeša was in vogue in the late Gupta period. In this connexion it is interest- ing to note that Varãhamihira prescribed in his Brhatsamhitã ( LVII, 58 ) the details regarding the fashioning of the Ganeša images. The work is dated to the beginning of 6th century and it can therefore be surmised with reasonable amount of certitude that the images of the elephant-headed god must have existed in the still earlier period at least in the fifth century. This view has to be revised now in the light of new evidence. The earliest known images of Ganeša are of 6th century, but there are some which • J. N. Banerjea, op . oittt pp. 575 77. « El, IX, pp. 277-81.</page><page sequence="4">4 Annals BORI, LXXt f 199Ô ) are of a still earlier period. Among these we can include twö idols from Afghanistan of which one can be assigned to the fifth century and the other to the 4th.7 The Ganeša images at Bhumra, Udayagiri caves and other Gupta sites are already known. Among the recent discoveries, the coinage of Ganeša on the Ramgarh Hill in Vidisha District, Madhya Pradesh, is note- worty.8 This appears to be a mature product of the Gupta school and can be dated to the fifth century. Another 5th-century image from Mathura is in the William Rockhill Nelson Gallery of Art, Atkins Museum of Fine ArtSg Kansas city.9 Yet one more of the same age is reported from Sirpur (M. P. ). 0 It should therefore be clear that there are Ganeša images of the fourth and fifth centuries A. D. Hence Varãhamihira could prescribe the iconography of the god in his Brhat-samhita ( ch. LVII ) which has been placed in the late fifth or the early sixth century. Two early images have recently been discovered in Maharashtra. One was found at Hemalapuri near Ramtek ( Dist. Nagpur ) which is of Väkätaka date. It has been placed in the fourth century, because of the lingering Kushan influence.11 The other one is from Ter ( Dist. Osmanabad ), and is dated to the third century on stylistic grounds. li! There are a few still earlier representations of Ganeša which are to be found in the Mathura Museum. There are over forty images of the god which were discovered at Mathura and its environs.13 One of these, which is on display in the Museum ( No. 1170 ) is reported to have been discovered in the Yamunã river near the city itself ( PI. I ). It shows a standing Ganeša whose portion below the knees is missing. It is carved in the round, and represents the god with arms, the left one holding a bowl of sweets which the god is eating with his trunk. He is naked with the genetic organ prominently indicated. 7 M. K.

It is a well known fact that carving figures in the round was the distinguishing feature of the sculptures of the Kushan period at Mathura. All these images have therefore been assigned to second-third centuries A. D. There is also one more early image, datable to the Kushan period, from Sankisa which Alice Getty believes to be the most ancient representation of the elephant-headed god discovered so far.14 Carved in the mottled red sand stone of Mathura it depicts a standing Ganeša with two arms, the left one of which holds a bowl of sweets which the god is eating with his trunk and the right one holding probably the broken tusk. The god is shown nude with the genetic organ prominently marked. It probably marks an early attempt at carving the anthropomorphic representation of the god, and may therefore be dated to the second or third cent. A. D. There is yet one more image of Ganeša which may belong to the Kushan period.15 It is a small image depicting the god in a standing posture with two hands, the left holding a bowl of sweets and the other resting over his hip. The most remarkable feature of the image is that yet another image is carved at the back. It may be again emphasized that such addorsed figures is a characteristic feature of the Kushan statuary.16 Equally important is the recent discovery of a terracotta image of Ganeša which was found in the course of excavations at Veerapuram ( Dist. Kurnool, Andhra Pradesh).17 It was recovered from the levels of Period IIIc which could be securely dated because of the association of Sãtavahana coins. The Ganeša image can, therefore, be dated to pre-300 A. D. The terracotta figure of the god, however, is fragmentary. It depicts probably a standing Ganeša whose legs are broken and the head-dress is damaged. The trunk too is partly destroyed. Another terracotta figure of Ganeša was found at Akra (NWEP). 8 There are, some images reported from Afghanistan which have not yet been studied properly.59 They throw a flood of light on the controversial origin of the elephant-headed deity and as such it is of prime importance to describe them fully. Of these one was found some years ago 4 Gania : A Monograph on the Elephant-faced God ( New Delhi, 1971 ), p. 26, pl. 2a. The image is in the collection of Mr. and Mrs. James W. Aldorf, Chicago.

II ). The sculpture is a typical product of the Indo- Afghan school. It is made of inferior marble and represents the elephant- headed Ganeša. It is about 60 cm. high and 35 cm. broad and on its pedestal is carved an inscription in two lines which records that " This great and beautiful Mahã-Vinãyaka was consecrated by the renowned Shahi king, the illustrious Shahi Khingala, who was Paramabhattãraka Mahãrãjãdhirãja in the eighth year ( of his reign ), in the MahSj'yestha mãsa, šuklapaksa, trayodaši, višakha naksatra and si mha lagna. " On the basis of the palaeography of the record, it can be assigned to early 6th century.-0 However, we do not know anything about this king Khingala. It is interest- ing to note that Kalhana in his Rajataraňginl records that a very ancient king named Narendrãditya also bore the name of Khiňkhila.1 But Narendrä- ditya of Kashmir who bore this peculiar title was a late king and cannot be identified with Khingala who, as the record explicitly states, was a Shahi. He was an early king and may be identified as the issuer of those coins bearing the legend Khiòga or Khingi on them. One such coin is in the Indian Museum, Calcutta, and nine other similar ones are said to have been in the possession of one Mr. J. P. Rawlins who is reported to have found them in Punjab. According to Vincent Smith, the Indian Museum specimen is ascribable to the end of 5th century.^- In that case the inscribed image of Ganeša from Afghanistan can be ascribed to the end of 5th century. This dating is also supported by the stylistic peculiarities of the image. Ganeša is shown standing in the all dha pose; his hands, legs and the chest are muscular suggesting a strong Hellenistic influence. The trunk, which is broken, was turned to the left while the broken tusk is clearly indicated on the left. A close-fitting tiara on the head, a necklet ( kanthl ) of alternating mani, a pravãla-valaya composition, also close-fitting in the neck are noteworthy as in Gupta sculptures of Sarnath. The ears have been camouflaged into foliage and this has misled some scholars into thinking that they were wings. The god had originally four hands all of which are broken. His yajftopaví ta is the snake with which he is said to have secured his belly full of modakas when, according to the story, the moon laughed at him from the sky. His undergarment is a short dhoti ( ardhoruka ) on which designs like ki rti-mukha, lotus buds and tassellated fringe of swallow's tail occur while the torso, the 20 D. C.

The anatomy of the figure, with an emphasis on muscular hands and legs is clearly suggestive of the lingering Hellenistic influence. Another interesting image of Ganeša from Afghanistan was found at Sakar Dhar ( Šaňkara-Dhara ), ten miles north of Kabul, from where are reported very interesting images of Sürya and Šiva.23 It is also made of marble. Its undergarment displays a tassellated fringe in which the swallow's tail and the bird's plumage designs occur. The general effect is to create an impression of a motif resembling the acanthus. What is remarkable is that the stem of the acanthus is suggested showing Ganeša as ürdhvamedhra , the acanthus design appearing to hang on it. The bulging tummy is not however of huge proportions that Ganeša is usually associated with. He wears a nãga - yajñopavila with a knot simulating the snake's head. The chest is muscular as is common in Gandharan sculptures. The trunk rests sufficiently high above the left shoulder, a trait of an early date. The right tusk is intact but the left is broken, suggesting that the image is a product of the recognised form of Ganeša as ekadanta . The ears are symmetrically spread fan-wise, which may give the impression of wings. The god has four hands ; the upper left arm is broken and missing. The two lower arms are spread down in a highly symmetrical pose and are seen resting on the heads of two attendant ganas , who are looking up at Ganeša with devotion. These ganas super- ficially suggest similarity with Greek dolphins and actually show the curly locks of hair, the patra-kundalas in the ears and necklet which we meet in Gupta sculptures. The sculpture resembles the early Gupta sculptures in the curly hair of the ganas , the ürdhvamedhra aspect which can be compared with the Kaušambi sculpture of Haragaurï, the absence of his vahana and the sinistral turn of the trunk high up and on level with the shoulder. The cen- tral folds of the undergarment showing the swallows tail design as well as the overall picture of the inverted acanthus may very well single this sculpture out as a product of the 4th century when Gupta influence had come and the Hellenistic had not left. Stylistically and by virtue of its fidelity to physical anatomy it may fall in the transition period of the art of India, say between Kushan and Gupta. It is interesting indeed that the Hindus of Kabul are now worshipping this image in the Shore Bazar locality (Narsinghdwara) of Kabul. III. Numismatic evidence The archaeological evidence from Afghanistan thus shows that the worship of Ganeša was in vogue in that country during the 4th-5th centuries a3 Dhavalikar, op. cit .</page><page sequence="8">8 Annals BORI, LXXI ( 1990 J A.D. It is no doubt curious that early sculptures of such an important Hindu divinity should have been found outside India, but at the same time it should be borne in mind that the eastern half of Afghanistan was a part of India in the ancient past not only culturally but administratively as well. The worship of Ganeša in Afghanistan in ancient times is rather vaguely suggested by the testimony of that most celebrated Chinese traveller, Yuan Chwang, who visited India during 629-645. He travelled through Central Asia and Afghanistan on his way to India in 630. During his prolonged journey he spent considerable time in visiting Buddhist establishments in Afghanistan where he spent a whole summer in ancient Kapisã ( modern Begram ). He has recorded a very curious and interesting legend regarding the tutelary deity of the inhabitants of Kapisã. We can do no better than quote the words of the pilgrim : " To the south west of the Capital ( Kapisa ) was the Pi-lo-so-lo mountain. This name was given to the mountain from its presiding genius who had the form of an elephant and was therefore called Pi-lo-so-lo"** The pilgrim's testimony amply demonstrates that during 6th-7th centu- ries the people of Kapisã were worshipping their tutelary god Pilusãra who had the form of an elephant. It is necessary to emphasize that Yuan Chwang merely records a tradition which was in vogue long before he visited Kapisa. This tradition is confirmed by the evidence furnished by an important coin type of Eukratides, an Indo-Greek king who ruled over a part of the Asiatic possessions of Alexander the Great ( 171-150 B. C. ). It can be described as follows : Obv. Diademed bust of king to right, wearing helmet. Greek legend : Basileos Megalou Eukratidou Rev. A deity wearing a mural crown, seated on throne to front, holds wreath and palm ; to right of throne forepart of elephant to right, and to left, a pilos (?) Kharosthi legend Kavi (pi) šiye nagara devatä " The coin has been discussed at great length by several numismatists. Charles Mason, the first discoverer of the coin, found one at Begram which has been identified with the ancient Kapisa. He identified the enthroned figure as a female deity.25 But E. Thomas suggested that the deity might be 24 Thomas Waiters, On Yuan Chwang* s Travels in India ( 1st Indian Ed., Delhi, 1961 ), I, p. 129. 25 JA SB( 1834), p. 164, pl.

He observed that, " The divi- nity, in so many words called a city deity, wears a mural crown, carries a palm but not a sceptre, in fact she is a city goddess. She precisely resembles the city Tyche on the copper coin of Hippostratus."30 A. K. Narain, who has examined all the five specimens in the British Museum and a few more in private collections, is also convinced that the divinity wears " a mural crown and carries a palm but not a sceptre ". He feels that it may rather be com- pared with the city fortune on a copper coin of Hippostratus, on a silver coin of Maues and on a copper coin of Azilizes : on certain specimens the figure seems certainly female. Further two other points observed by Whitehead are also quite pertinent : the legend itself precisely calls it the city deity of Kapisa and that the deity cannot be Zeus on the coins of Maues and Azilizes, since in each case he appears on the reverse of the coin.31 The coin has thus become the subject of much discussion. Moreover the enthroned figure on the coin has also been variously interpreted. Some scholars would like to connect the elephant on the coin with Buddhism.32 The most interesting interpretation has been given by J. N. Banerjea. He identifies the enthroned figure as that of Indra who was also known as the yakça of Indrapura in the Mahãmayarl. According to him, the place Si-pi- to-fa-la-tzu, referred to by Yuan Chwang, is ävetSsvatälaya, the abode of Indra who incidentally was also known as Švetavat. He further states that, " It is possible to identify the central device of the coin as ' Indra enthroned with the partial representation of his mount AirSvata ( with the White Ele- phant ) before him." ávetãsvatãlaya, according to the description of Yuan Chwang, was a suburb of Kapisa in the seventh century A. D., and its very name indicates that it had Indra as its tutelary deity. Banerjea concludes : " So in the Indo-Bactrian money, enthroned Zeus and Devaraja Indra are often confused and it will be better to describe these figures as Indra where he is accompanied by an elephant or partial representation of an elephant."33 26 Cited by Lahiri, op. cit., p. 127. 27 Numismatic Chronicle ( 1869 ), p. 225, No. 21, pi, ( c ) VI, 6. 2j BMC, p. 19, pl.

But whether it is a male or a female is doubtful. It has been taken to be a female because of its resemblance with city Tycho on the copper coin of Hippostratus. It should, however, be borne in mind that a majority of scholars identified the figure as that of Zeus because they took it to be a male figure. It is possible that she can be taken to be a female because majority of city deities were females such as the city goddesss of Puskarãvatí. Here we should take into consideration the identi- fication of the coin by Rapson. Of the two symbols viz., the elephant;head and the mountain, Rapson identifies the former as the mountain Pilusara and the other as the elephant god, of tha mountain as also the city of Kapisa. Rapson was the first to connect the two symbols and the legend recorded by Yuan Chwang regarding the tutelary deity of Kapisa.84 Yuan Chwang's testi- mony amply demonstrates that in the seventh century Pilusara was the tute- lary deity of Kapisa which had the form of an elephant. It seems that the tradition which had great antiquity for the dsity, as pointed out by Rapson, was depicted' on an early Indo-Greek coin of second century B. C. The scholars who tried to identify the enthroned deity on the coin as Zeus or Indra as also those who take it to be a female deity have overlooked the guardian deity of Kapisa which is portrayed on the coin and is also specified by the legend. That the guardian deity was the elephant genius has been clearly testified by Yuan Chwang. Whether the deity is male or female is immaterial, for the mint masters were here facing a curious problem of depi- cting a sacred animal - that of the therianthropic representation. What they did was to portray the deity enthroned and show the forepart of an elephant by its side; they could not possibly think of the combination of the therimor- phic and the anthropomorphic representation of the deity. This would also show that they never bothered about the male or the female character of the deity. This ultimately has caused a controversy among scholars. However, in the light of the discussion in the preceding pages it should become clear that the coin depicts the anthropomorphic form of the tutelary deity of Kapisa enthroned ; but that it was in the form of an elephant is clear from the forepart of the beast and its abode in the mountain to the south-west of the city is shown by pilos on the coin. Hence the representation of Zeus, because to Greeks a god who lived on a mountain could not well become anything but Zeus.35 31 E. J.

Although it appears on the earlier punch-marked coins, it is depicted most realistically on the coinage of Indo- Greeks. It is one of the few truly Indian motifs which is represented on the coinage of foreigners who ruled in the early period. The elephant, as is well known, is one of the sacred animals to the Hindus and the Buddhists as well, and it was so even in the remotest past as its representations on Indus seals would show. But it is difficult to hazard any guess regarding the religious affiliation of the elephant that is to be seen on Indo-Greek coins. Nonethe- less, it is equally clear that its representation on coinage must have certainly satisfied both the Hindu and the Buddhist populations in the north-western India. The most realistic and the full-bodied representation of elephant occurs on the coins of Apollodo tus. These are squarish pieces of silver on which we have, on the obverse, a standing elephant facing left with the legend in Greek while on the reverse is shown a standing bull facing and with the legend in Kharosthi. This coin type, which marks a distinct deviation in the Indo* Greek coinage, has been taken to have definite religious significance, for in this case the bust of the king on obverse and the usual Greek divinities on the reverse have been replaced by animals which are characteristically Indian. Even the bull is of the typical Bos indicus - the humped variety. The elephant is also equally Indian. Another Indian religious symbol is the nandipãda which occurs on the reverse, above the hump of the bull and the other on the elephant on the obverse,36 and the conjunction of these two types is imitated by subsequent kings who ruled in the north-western parts of the sub-continent viz., Heliocles and the Sakas Maues, Azes and Azilizes. The fact that Apollodotus' 'humped' bull and elephant type became a regular type of the Šaka kings also shows that it had a considerable local significance. The full-bodied elephant occurs on the coins of Antimachus I and II,37 Menander,38 Holiocles, Lysias, Archebius, Azes and Azilizes. On some of the coins of Demetrius ( I ), Menander, and Maues, the elephant is shown with a bell round its neck while on some issues of Apollodotus the animal is adorned with a band round its body.3 ' On some issues of Antima- chus II the elephant is shown striding with its trunk upraised.40 36 Percy Gardner, Coins of Greek and Scythic Kings of Bactria and India in the British Museum ( Chicago, 1966, new print ), 34, No. 10.

Gardner43 is of the opinion that the figure is that of the king whereas Tarn identifies it as that of the Buddha. He observes that " the elephant is not running ; he has both his forefeet high in the air and any Indian Greek knew well enough that elephants do not run like that. The creature is dancing, dancing on its hind legs and offering a wreath to the seated figure. "44 On a bronze issue of Zoilus we have on the obverse Apollo clad in chalmys and boots, holding bow and arrow in his hands and quiver at the back ; and near him on left is a small elephant.'5 This association of ele- phant with Apollo is indeed significant. As we shall see later, it is the divine character of the elephant which forced the Greek rulers to associate the animal with their own gods. Elephant-head is also shown on some coin types. On bronze issues of Demetrius, who was the son and successor of Euthydemos, we find the ele- phint-head on right with bell round his neck shown on the obverse, while the reverse has caduceus.46 This was later copied by Maues. On a bronze square coin of Menander also we find on the obverse an elephant-head on right, with bell round its neck while on the reverse is the club. Similarly on a bronze round coin of Maues is shown the head of elephant with bell round its neck on obverse while on reverse is the caduceus.47 Tarn is inclined to identify the elephant that we see on these coin types with that of Taxila. He states that, " There is a story which may bear on the elephant of Taxila. It is known that Philostratus, when he wrote on the life of Apollonius, had before him a pretty accurate description of Parthian Taxila by someone who had visited it and he says that at Taxila there was a very old elephant, once belonging to Porus whom Alexander had dedicated in the temple of the Sun and had named Aias, and whom the people used to annoint with myrrh and adorn with fillets ( Life of Apollonius, II, 20). Philostratus attributes many things to Alexander and Porus, but the story might really be the evidence for the existence at Taxila of a sacred elephant, " Ibid, p. 87, pl. VI, 18. Bííç.p. 71, pl.

N. Banerjea is inclined to identify the elephant with the elephant deity of Kapisa. He states : " On the basis of our main hypothe- sis, it will be possible for us to suggest that the device ' elephant's head ' with a bell round his neck used by Demetrius on some of his copper coins and other Indo-Greek and the Šaka rulers like Menander and Maues was associ- ated with this elephant deity, peculiar to Kapisa and its environs. We are not certain whether the elephant used as a device on so many coins of these kings is in any way connected with it ; but if any connection between two could be proved, then one could demonstrate the extreme popularity of the device."40 The representation of elephant 011 a coin type of Antialkidas is extre- mely interesting and is certainly not without significance. These coins are of silver and are round in shape.50 On the obverse they have the bust of the king while on the reverse is shown Zeus sitting on throne, holding Nike in his right hand, who in her turn, bears wreath and palm ; on left is the forepart of an elephant. He has a bell round the neck and he has raised his trunk. It appears as if Nike is garlanding the elephant who is accepting the wreath with his upraised trunk. The same motif is copied by the Šaka king Maues on the reverse of his bronze square coins.61 Here Zeus, the greatest of the Greek divinities, seems to be paying his respects to the elephant who then can be said to be not a mere animal who was of great use as it served as the veritable tank in the army, but seems to have been accorded equal position with Greek deities. Of this coin type we can distinguish four different varieties which were all issued by Antialcidas. On the obverse of all the varieties the bust of the king is depicted. On the reverse of one variety ( silver, round ) is shown " Zeus seated on throne left ; holds in right Nike who bears wreath and palm ; in left, long sceptre ; in field left forepart of elephant with bell round neck who raises his trunk."52 The same device was also used by Maues on the reverse of his square bronze coins.53 On one variety there is Zeus seated on left on throne ; holding in right hand palm and wreath ; in the left is sceptre ; to the left is a small elephant op. cit* , p. 164. 49 "Indian Elements on Com Devices of Foreign Rulers 01 India , 1 HQ, Vol. XI V ( 1938 ), pp. 300-301. 6° BMC, p. 25, pl.

Oa yet another coin there is on the reverse " Zeus seated on throne left ; holding in right hand Nike and in left the sceptre ; the left is the forepart of an ele- phant who carries off the wreath of Nike."55 On one copper coin of Antialcidas, which is squarish in shape, there is the bust of the king on the obverse and on the reverse is depicted elephant to right, holding wreath in its upraised trunk.66 Since this is an issue of Antial- cidas, there should be little doubt that it can also be grouped with the preceding varieties with the only difference that Zeus with Nike is absent in this case. Similar device is also used on a square bronze coin of Maues. Here, however, it is on the obverse that we find elephant running right and holding in his trunk wreath in square of fillet pattern, while on the reverse is the king seated cross-legged.67 To the same series may also be added yet another coin type of Anti- alcidas. Here we have on the obverse the bust of the king to the left thrust- ing javelin while on the reverse is shown elephant walking left with Nike on his head and the radiate, sceptred Zeus by his side.58 The most interesting representation of elephant on some of the Indo- Greek coins is that in the form of a scalp, which crowns the king's headgear. Demetrius, the son and successor of Euthydemos was the first king to be depicted with elephant's scalp on his silver coins ( PI. Ill ) and also on some of his bronze issues.59 The same device was later borrowed by Agothocles and Lisias who are shown on their coins in the same way. It is said that even Alexander and Ptolemy had issued certain coins on which they were shown wearing elephant scalp on their helmet ( Pl. IV ). We do not know whether these coins were issued to commemorate Alexander's conquest of India. But this would then be a strange way of symbolising a conquest. If at all it means something, then it certainly shows the reverence of the issuing authorities for elephant. As Whitehead has observed in the case of Lysias, it can be interpreted " to mean that he ( the issuing King ) regarded himself as under the protection of the elephant god of Kapisa."60 In this connection it should be noted that Alexander had great regard for the elephent of Taxila whose story has already been narrated. We should agree with Tarn accord- 64 Ibid, p. 25, pl. VII, 10. 65 Ibid, p. 25, pl.JVII, 14. 66 Lahiri, op. o it., p. 87, pl. V, 18. 51 BVG, p. 70, pl. XVII, 5. 58 Lahiri. op. cit., p. 85, pl.

In fact the elephant head with bell around his neck has been identified by scholars with the sacred elephant of Taxila. 6¿ J. N. Banerjea rightly con- cludes : " On the basis of our main hypothesis, it will be possible for us to suggest that the device elephant head with a bell round his neck used by Demetrius on some of his coins and other Indo-Greek and Saka rulers like Menander and Maues was associated with this deity ( that is, Indra ) peculiar to Kapisa and its environs. We are not certain whether the elephant used as a device on so many coins of these kings is in any way connected with it, but if any connection between the two could be proved, then one could demon- strate the extreme popularity of the device. "63 The next logical step was to produce a therianthropic representation of the elephant-headed deity. It takes place in the time of the last Indo-Greek ruler Hermaeus, on one of whose coin types we have a clear representation of a Ganeša (Pl. V ). The coin has recently been noticed by A. K. Narain in the old collections in the British Museum. " If this is accepted ", observes A. K. Narain, " surely this would be the earliest representation of Ganeša and a veritable specimen of syncretic tendencies which started operating from the time of the Indo-Greek and resulted in the formation of many new gods and goddesses. This is also an example of how a local deity was transformed or, if you may like to say, elevated to the respectable status. The foregoing account of the elephant motif on the coins of foreign rulers, more particularly of the Indo-Greeks, shows that the animal which was sacred to the Hindus was also held in reverence by the foreign rulers who wanted to win over the population to their side. It may be interesting to note in this connection the fact that there are quite a good number of places in Panjab, more appropriately in the ancient Gãndhãra, which are associated with elephant in their names. To begin with Kapisa, the name signifies that the place was ' endowed with elephants ' So also is the case of Puskarãvatí, for Puskara means elephant. It is also significant that the ancient site Hastanagar is named after king Hastin, the hero of the eponymous tribe. It was a city of elephants like the Hastinãpura of the Kauravas and Vãranãvata of the Pãndavas. We have already narrated the story of the sacred elephant 61 Tarn, op, cit.* p. 164. 62 Banerjea, op. cit., IHQ, Vol. XIV ( 1938 ). 63 Banerjea, 0p . cit., IHQ , Vol. XIV ( 1938 ), pp. 330-3. « Presidential Address, JNSI&gt; Vol. XXXVI ( 1974 ), p. 190.</page><page sequence="16">16 Annals BORI , LXXI ( 1990 J of Taxila. Cunningham identified the ancient site at Palo-dheri which was the ancient township of Polusa/5 referred to by Yuan Chwang. According to him to the north-east of the town rose the hill of Dantaloka, with a cave* in which Prince Sudana and his wife had taken refuge. It is about forty miles from Potali. Very probably the association of elephant with several places in the Gãndhãra region may be due to its being the habitat of the tribe of the Hastikas. The historians of Alexander mention a king named Astes ( Hasti ) as ruling over a people called As takenoi ( Hastikas ) living in the region of Puskarãvatí. Arrian states that when Alexander's army, together with the local chiefs, reached the Indus, they carried out all orders of Alexan- der. But Astes, the ruler of the land of Poucelaotis ( Puskarãvatí ), rose in revolt which both ruined himself and brought ruin also upon the city which he fled for refuge. Hephastion, the General of Alexander, captured it after a seige of thirty days and Astes himself was killed.66 Strabo also in his geography describes that after the Cophes (the Kabul river) followed Indus, and the region between these rivers was occu- pied by Astacenoi (Hastikas), Masiani, Myasi, and Hispacii.67 Pliny records that " They ( many writers ) include also the Astaceni, in whose coun- try the vine grows abundantly and the laurel and boxwood and every kind of fruit tree found in Greece."-3 The accounts of classical writers thus show that there lived in the fouith century B. C. in the Kabul valley the valiant tribe of Hastikas who were ruled at the time of Alexander's invasion by a king named Hasti. The tribe was there even in 6th- 5th cent. B. C. as Panini refers to the Hãstinã- yanas as occupying the area near the confluence of the Swat and the Kabul, with their capital at Puskarãvatí.69 The Hãstinãyanas of Pãnini are in all probability the kastikas of the classical accounts. The region occupied by the Hastikas formed in ancient times a part of the Gãndhãra country which in its turn was an integral part of India from the earliest epoch of Indo- Aryan civilization. We do not know about the Hastikas beyond what has been recorded by classical writers and Pãnini They appear to be quite a valient people.

It is therefore not unlikely that the elephant was extremely sacred to them ; it might have been their totem as well.70 After conquering them, the Indo-Greek rulers possibly introduced elephant on their coins to win over the loyalty of the Hastikas. Also interesting in this context are the elephant-headed genii occurring in the Buddhist shrines at Amaravati ( Andhra Pradesh ) and Mihintale in Sri Lanka, both of which can be assigned to circa 1st cent. B. C.71 These representations clearly show that the goď belonged to the Yaksa class. Per- haps this is one reason why the worship of the elephant-headed god was considered abhorrent by the people belonging to upper classes for a long time. This is vaguely suggested by some of the verses in Manu and his commentators Medhätithi and Govindaraja who refer to the malevolent character of Vinäyaka.72 IV. Evidence from literature All the evidence thus points to the widespread worship of elephant in the Kabul valley in 4th century B. C. and even in the still earlier period. Fortunately there is some evidence to show that elephant was venerated even by the Vedic Aryans. In the Rgvedic hymns mention is often made of a mythical steed called ' Paidva. ' It is so called because it was given to a person called Pedu by the Ašvins. Pedu was a protege of the Ašvins and they favoured him with good steed instead of a bad horse which he had. This ' swift strong, white, incomparable and dragon-slaying steed ' was the Paidva. The Paidva is described as white ( Rv, I. 116. 6 ) -švetam, ( Sãyaça s šveta-varna-ašvam. I. 118.9 švetam-ašvam, X. 39. 10 švetam-ašvam ). The Paidva is praisworthy and invoked by men ( Rv. I. 116.6, I. 119. 10). Kiríenyam Sãyan i explains as mahimahat ati-gambhiram ata èva kirtenyam sarveh kïrtaniyam pra&amp;ãsyam ). The Paidva is swift and powerful ( 1. 116. 6; I. 117. 9; VII. 71. 5, I, 118. 9, X. 39. 10) ; it is loud-neighing ( Çv. I. 118. 9; 70 The Niddesa passage quoted by Bhandarkar ( op. oit., p. 37 ) mentions such objects of worship as suparna, yaksas, asuras, gandharvas, an elephant etc. See. J. N.

X. 4. 4), invincible in war ( #v. I. 119. 10) and strong winner of thous- and spoils ( Rv. I. 117. 9 ). The Paidva is impelled by Indra, he is a dragon-slayer like Indra and is comparable to Indra in prowess ( Rv. I. 118. 9; I. 119. 10). Indra and Paidva have subdued and tamed the vicious snake ( Av. X. 4. 10 ). In Rv. IX. 88. 4 Soma is described as " Soma is like Paidva in slaying the dragon. " Besides, in Rv. (I. 116. 7 and I. 117. 6) Paidva seems to be the steed from whose kãrotara ( which means, according to Yãska, Nirukta ITI. 23 a kï rpa or utsa that is the cavity in the head ) the Ašvins make flow hundred jars of wine. It is probably the same Paidva who is referred to as Petva, Pitva and Pidva. Petva is twice mentioned in Av. ( IV. 4. 8; V. 19. 2 ) where reference is made to its vãja that is strength and swiftness but by that probably its male power is meant, as the spell is for removing lack of virility. In Av V. 19. 2 Petva is said to have overcome a horse. In VII. 18. 17 Petva overcomes a female lion. Petva is further mentioned in the list of animals offered in the Ašvamedha sacrifice.73 Petva is generally taken to mean the same powerful animal as the Paidva.74 Now which is this animal called Paidva described as white, swift and powerful, invincible in war, loud-neighing, able to overcome a horse and a lion and from whose head wine flows ? He is said to have been impelled by Indra and is often compared to Indra for his prowess. These qualities can only be attributed to an animal like an elephant. An elephant of white colour, powerful, loud-neighing and rutting, and goaded by Indra and having the qualities of Indra himself, reminds us of Airãvata, the elephant of Indra in classical mythology. Though I do not propose here to deal with the story of the mythical Airãvata, I would like to point out that Indra does not possess any elephant in Vedic mythology. He is only once compared to " a wild elephant with might invested" (Rv. IV. 16. 4). So if we are to trace the origin of the Airãvata from the Vedic myths we cannot overlook its similarity with the mythical Paidva. If it is admitted that the steed Paidva was an ele- phant, it is possible to go further in the history of the name. All the forms, Paidva , Pidva , and Pitva , are reducible to either Pedu - Pidu or Petu - Pitu . The fluctuation of the vowels e and i and that of the consonants d and t show that it was a foreign word that was being transcrib- ed. The foreign word was probabiy the word under consideration, pedu or 73 There is a place called Paitava near Kapisa. See Rosenfield, op. cit., p. 200.' 74 See Keith and MacdonelFs Vedic Index , Tai .

As the cerebralization had not started in the Indo-Aryan in that period, the cerebral was rendered simply by a dental.75 In the later Vedic period we come across with other words for elephant like hasti, kari etc. But these words are all descriptive and evolved in a period when the Indo-Aryans had become more familiar with the elephant. The account of Pedu-Paidva reveals probably their first acquaintance with elephant. The Indo-Aryans had in earlier times greater familiarity with the horse. The superiority of elephant over horse in strength, speed and in other respects inspired them with awe at the first instance and that awe found expressions in coloured stories which gradually took the form of the myth of Paidva. The archaeological evidence discussed above is to a considerable extent corroborated by literary evidence. It should be noted here that the references to the elephant-headed deity in the Maitrãyaní Samhitã have been proved to be very late interpolations and need not be taken seriously.76 Regarding Ganeša in the epics, M. Winternitz concludes : " It is, however, worth men- tioning that ( as far as I am able to see ) it is very doubtful whether the ele- phant-headed god can claim a place in the Epic pantheon. "77 So far as the legend that the great sage Vyãsa secured the services of Ganeša as scribe for writing the great epic, Winternitz has shown that it is a late legend which was known about 900 A. D.78 The epic further tells us that among the ganas of Šiva who were benevolent deities of nine classes dwelling on mount Kailãsa, there was another group called Vinäyakas ( MB, XII. 284. 202 ). They were evil beings of attacking disposition. Although malevolent, they could be propitiated. Their propitiatory rites and ceremonies have been mentioned in both the epics ( MB, III. 65. 23 ; Rãmãyana , VI, 128, 113 ). Vinäyakas are also mentioned in the Mãnava-grhya-sutra in the sub- section which is titled Viwyaka-kalpa or " the Pacificatory Rites for Vina- yakas " where the four names of Vinäyakas appear as Usmita, Devayajana, áãlakatankata and Kusmãnda-Rãjaputra, and the appeasement of the trouble creating god is prescribed. The worship of Ganeša is also alluded to in such later Smrtis as the Yãjnavalkya-smrti (I. 271-294). In the Baudhãyana - grhya-pariéesasütra ( III. 10 ), which can be assigned to the same period as 75 See for discussion P. C. Bagchi, " Some Linguistic Notes " J HQ, Vol. IX ( 1933 )f pp. 253-65. 76 J. N.

Herein the group of four Vinãyakas is addressed to as one god, and he is looked upon as the son of Ambikã. This one Vinãyaka was appointed by Siva as Ganapati Vinãyaka, who may be considered as the earliest form of Ganeša. He is given the role of creating difficulties and obstructions if not properly propitiated.79 In the Baudhäyana-grhya-parisesa-sütra ( III. 10 ), among many invocations to the spirit under various epithets, there is one which speaks of it as hasti-mukha or elephant-faced. It is interesting that the same epithet has been applied to Vighna and Vinãyaka in the Baudhãyana Dharmasutra. In it the spirit or deity Vighna ( obstacle ) is given most of the epithets of Ganeša like Vinãyaka, hasti-mukha , vakra-tunda, eka-danta, lambodara etc. Thus it appears from the literary evidence that in the early centuries of the Christian era one Vinãyaka had come to supersede the con- cept of four or more, making his identification with Ganapati easier. But his malevolent character is conspicuous, for he is invoked both as Vighna ( obstacles ) or Vighnešvara ( Lord of Obstacles ). " Only one step further," writes G. S. Ghurye, " and that a very radical transformation was needed to enthrone Ganesa being the Lord of Obstacles as the Destroyer or Remover of Obstacles. Such transformations inhere in the very nature of early religio- magical system of beliefs... So Vinayaka, the trouble-maker becomes the much-prayed-to trouble-averter Ganesa."00 This transformation in all proba- bility was completed long before fifth century and hence the occurrence of the images of Ganesa in the Kushan period. Two more important sculptures in the Mathura Museum are of great significance. One of these is a frieze ( No. 2335 ) carved with three horizon- tal bands of which the upper one has a railing and the middle one contains six arches showing worshippers. In the band at the bottom, which is partly preserved, are depicted five elephant-headed figures. V. S. Agrawala identfies them as elephant-headed yaksas each of which according to him " is the earliest representation of Ganeša figure in the Mathura art, perhaps an offshoot of Kubera iconography."01 We are inclined to identify these figures as the representations of Ganesa, more particularly of Vinãyakas although doubts 79 Yãjnavalkya-smrti , 1, 271-94. According to R. G. Bhandarkar, Šaivism etc. ( p. 212 ). the Y õj nav alky a Smrti is not earlier than 6th century, but P. V. Kane has shown that it is not later than the third century.

Origin of Ganeša 2Í have been expressed about their identification/- They appear more to be the prototypes of the Pañca-Ganesa images of the later period. As already discussed, the Vinãyakas are usually mentioned as four and the earliest refe- rence to them is to be found in the Mãnava-grhya-sutra which is supposed to be one of the earliest Grhya-sutras dating back to about second century B. C. The four Vinãyakas are said to have been invoked under four separate for- mulae in the Mãnava-grhya-sutra ( II, 14, 47 ) and they again appear in the Yãjnavalkya-smrti (I, 285 ). The elephant-headed figures in the Mathura frieze have also been identified as Vinãyakas by P. K. Agrawala who observes : " In the art of Amaravati and Mathura during lst-3rd cent, of the Christian era the portrayal of Vinayakas- who were originally a team of attack- ing beings of evil disposition -appears probably to render them as elephant- headed demons or yaksas . The Mathura relief may be identified as Vinaya- kas or four figures. Probably the chief of them was shown thcriomorphi- cally." It may however be stated that five Vinayakas have been mentioned in the Ganapati-kalpa section of the Yãjmvalkya-smrti (I, 285 ). They are Mita, Samhita, Šalakantaka, Kusmãnda and Rãjaputra.8:: The increase in number is due to the separate mention of Kusmãnda and Rãjaputra who, as already seen, have otherwise been referred to as one Kusmãnda-rãjaputra. Again Mita and Samhita are phonetically similar to Usmita which occurs in the Mänava-grhya-sütra. But Devayajana, which occurs in the Mãnava- grhya-sutra has been dropped in this list. It is noteworthy that among the gods, to be invoked to propitiate Vinãyakas, Yaksas are also mentioned (Mänava-grhya-sütra, II, 14,29). Be that as it may, it appears that the concept of five Vinãyakas was also prevalent in the early centuries of the Christian era, along with four. Yet another interesting sculpture is also in the Mathura Museum. It depicts Gajalaksmi in the centre, flanked by Ganeša on right and Kubera on left. B. N. Sharma, while referring to this sculpture observes that " Shri V. N. Srivastava, the Curator of the Mathura Museum, says that there are three such sculptures in his Museum. Of these, one belongs to the Kushan period and the other two to the Gupta period."81 For us, however, the image belonging to the Kushan period is of crucial importance for this shows that even in the Kushan period Ganeša was becoming popular. His association 82 "Some Varanasi Images of Ganapati and Their Iconographie Problem/' Artibus A sia e . Vol. XXXIX ( 1977 ), p. 139. 83 Late Sir R. G.

Laksmî, as we know, is the goddess of wealth and the same is the case with Kubera, a yaksa , who is referred to as Dhanada. Kubera and Ganesa have in fact many features in common. Both are grotesque in appearance and pot-bellied. Even Coomaraswamy has noted this similarity, for he says : " Ganesa is undoubted- ly a yaksa type by his big belly and general character ; but he is not cited by name in any lists. He is effectively and perhaps actually equivalent to Kubera or Manibhadra.'^5 Perhaps that is why the artist selected Kubera and Ganesa to flank the goddess in the centre to balance the sculpture. But in doing so, he was unconsciously elevating Ganesa, who was an obstacle creator, to the level of a divinity, ranking him with Gajalakçmï and Kubera in importance. Both Kubera and Ganesa were yaksas first but the former remained a yaksa whereas the latter attained divine status. Last but not the least important is the name of the guardian deity of Kapisa which Yuan Chwang has given as Pilushara. This name can be favourably compared with Pillaiyar which is the Dravidian name for Ganesa and is still current in south India. The present name is no doubt a corrupt form of his ancient title and is obviously derived from the Dravidian words pallu or pella, both signifying tooth, that is, the tusk of the elephant altho- ugh in the present form there is no meaning of ' tusk ' Pilla is the Tamil word for child, and Pillaiyar means noble child, but pilla originally meant the 4 young of an elephant '8J However, from the similarity between the names it seems that Pillaiyar is derived from Pilushara for when Sanskrit words were borrowed into Tamil, Sk. sa or sha was sometimes changed into ya . 7 The ancient name of Ganesa thus survives in south India where many of the Hindu traditions still continue in an unadulterated form. Epilogue If we may now attempt to sum up, we see that the evidence - archaeo- logical and literary - brings into sharp focus the development of the elephant- headed god from animal totem to its therianthropic representation. In all likelihood it was a totem of the tribe of the Hastikas and perhaps many others in the north-western parts of the sub-continent and there should be little doubt that elephant was a sacred animal in those regions. Hence its occurrence on the coin of Taxila. What is more, there was a sacred ele- phant in the city of Taxila whom even Alexander offered worship. The ele- Yaksas , pt.

This was the first step towards the therian- thropic representation of the animal whereas that on the coin of Eukratides marks another stage as it offers the animal equal status with Zeus, and the legend on the coin testifies to it. From this the therianthropic form on the coin of Hermeus was the logical development. But it took a couple of centuries more to fashion the images of the god in stone and clay. When images of different divinities of diverse pantheons came to be carved on a large scale under the Kushans, the first images of Ganeša were also produced."8 The literary evidence is also corroborative. The early Buddhist litera- ture shows that elephant was held sacred and was worshipped by people along with other godlings. The Mänava-grhya-sütra refers to four Vinãyakas who were creators of obstacles but could be propitiated. They are combined into one in the Yãjnavcilkya-Smrti of second-third cent. A. D. This is the same process by which four gods Skanda-Kumãra-Visãkha-Mahãsena, who were represented separately on the coins of Kaniska, were later merged into one Skanda. The god - Vinãyaka - was an obstacle creator ( vighna-kartã ) first and became obstacle destroyer later and therefore his worship soon began to be popular from Gupta period onwards. Almost simultaneously it reaches South India, where the earliest Ganeša image is to be found in the 6th century Chalukyan caves at Badami in Karnatak.09 Although the representa- tions of Ganeša are absent in the early Paliava art, the first independent shrine of god was consecrated by the end of the 7th century at Tiruchirapally. The earliest invocation of the god is in the Baijanath prašasti of circa 750 A. D.90 and his invocation for success is to be found in the Ghatiyala inscrip- tion of 862 A. D. This development is parallelled in literature also, for Bhavabhüti invokes the god in his Mâlatï-Mâdhava ( Act 1, v. 2 ). Varãha-mihira also mentions Vainayakï, the female form of Ganeša, as one of the sapta-mãtrkãs ( Br. Sam. V. 56-57 ). By the tenth century the cult of the Gãnapatyas comes into being. Even the ardhanãrí švara form of Ganeša is mentioned in the Halãyudhastotra which is inscribed in the Amare- 88 Bharata in his Nãtyasãstra , which has been placed between A. D. 200-400, refers to Ganesa as one of the lesser gods. See Manomohan Ghosh, " The Date of Bharata- Nãtyasãstra Jr. of Deptt. of Lettres , Univ. of Calcutta, Vol. XXV ( 1934 ), pp. 41-42. 89 Aschwin Lippe, " Early Chalukyan Icons ", Artibus Asiat.

This is perhaps the one in the Badami caves. 90 It Opens with O ¡il Svasti Ork Ganapayoh , El , I, p. 104,</page><page sequence="24">24 Annals BORI , LXXI ( 1990 ß shwar temple at Omkar Mandhata in Madhya Pradesh. The record is dated to 1063 A. D.91 It is intriguing that a rat, which is the vãhana of the god in later representations, is conspicuously absent in early sculptures. Perhaps the earliest representation is in the temple at Muktesvar in Bhuvaneshwar in Orissa which belongs to the 10th century.9* In South India a rat does not occur before the 12th century.9 : It may be recalled in this context that a rat is associated with Rudra in the Yajurveda .94 We have seen that the epithets of Ganeša like karata , vakratunda , dantin etc. have been applied to Rudra also in the Taittiriya Aranyaka . It was therefore not difficult to associate Rudra's rat with Ganeša, but this happened much later in the 10th century. Ganeša outside India As in India, the worship of Ganeša spread in other countries of Asia in short period of time.'5 We have alraady referred to the elephant-headed figure on a first century B. C. Buddhist stüpa at Mihintale in Sri Lanka. This was obviously due to contact with Amaravati. In Afghanistan, the worship of Ganeša began at an early period as elephant was considered sacred in its eastern parts. From there it spread into central Asia, Tibet and thence to China where the god was worshipped by the Buddhists. Two early representations in China belong to the sixth century A. D. One of them is painted in Tun Huang caves which can be placed in the early 6th century, whereas the other is a stone image in the rock-cut temple at Kung- hsien which is inscribed and is dated to 531 A. D. From China, the worship was introduced into Japan in the 9th century by Kobo Daishi, a Buddhist monk. The double form of Ganeša ( Kangi Ten ) was quite popular in Japan. In Central Asia and Far East the god was worshipped as Vinãyaka by the Buddhists, but in southeast Asia the worship was offered by the Hindus. In Cambodia and Viet-nam he was known as Ganeša when worshipped inde- pendently, but, when he was shown seated with Šiva as his attendant, he was known as Vinãyaka and in several places he was associated with mountains. Both these traditions are reminiscent of its origin in India. All this would show that Ganeša is the only god who was worshipped all over Asia and was venerated by the Hindus, Buddhists and even the Jainas. 91 EI, XXV, p. 175, V. 1. K. C.
