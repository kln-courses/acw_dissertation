The book begins with a discussion of Gershom Scholem's view that the attempt to build an artificial hominoid was integrally involved in ecstatic mystical practices. Idel reexamines Scholem's hypothesis through close readings of a wide variety of particular texts. His central conclusion is that "the Golem changed forms in accordance [with] the metaphysical systems serving as the background of the discussion" (p. 272). Of the four major forms of the Golem, Idel associates only that of Abulafia and his school with ecstatic experience. A second form, embodied in works such as Sefer ha-IHayyim, is shown to configure the Golem in astrological terms. Another group of works, rep- resented by the circle of the Special Cherub, employs the Golem to integrate three themes: an anthropomorphic theology, the 231 gates mentioned in Sefer Yesirah, and the 236 tens of thousands of parasangs of the Shi'ur Qomah. Theosophical Kabbalah, which provides the fourth term, "translated the Talmudic text [on the Golem] and the views of Sefer Yezirah into an anthropomorphical theosophy which transformed the Golem into a supernal man, constituted by the sefirot" (p. 272). The study is argumentative and empirical. The argumentative frame is set from the opening discussion of Scholem, and the direction of the twenty individual chapters and three appendices is often at least partially determined by engaging the views of other scholars on particular points. The empirical focus emphasizes texts presented in trans- lation, with careful discussion of original vocabulary and context. Given the history, cultural, and geographical sweep of the volume and the specificity of the discussion, it is not surprising that the presumed audience is specialized. Any reader venturing into Golem will be well advised to have read carefully and frequently works such as Sefer Yesirah. Golem is a pioneering work that will influence future research and may well launch a number of dissertations (almost every chapter offers a compelling and intrigu- ing set of questions for further research). An example of the kind of argumentation that occurs is Idel's hypothesis that the original talmudic text on the Golem is a polemic against pagan magical practices involving the animation of statues (pp. 27-43). It is illustrative of Golem that the tal- mudic text, which anchors not only this particular discussion but also the book as a whole, is not cited until chapter 3, and then is used almost immediately in connection with specific arguments. The text from bSan 65b reads as follows (Idel's translation): Rava said: "If the righteous wished, they could create a world, for it is written, 'Your iniquities have been a barrier between you and your God'." For Rava created a man and sent him to R. Zeira. The Rabbi spoke to him but he did not answer. Then he said: "You are [coming] from the pietists: Return to your dust." * Moshe Idel.

He first cites a medieval text in which the sin of Enosh is identified with the shaping of an image of man, the breathing into it of the spirit of life, and the animation of the statue through the agency of Satan (p. 32). The passage seems to indicate that the Jews of that time knew of the worship of animated statues. Idel infers that we can move such knowledge back in time, and he cites the "much earlier" passage from Sefer Hekhalot (3 Enoch) in which the sin of the generation of Enosh is identified with the following practices: collection of precious stones; construction of heaps and mountains out of them; erection of idols of 1000 parasangs; bringing down the sun, moon, planets, and constellations to the idols. The specific passages condemned in Sefer Hekhalot are characterized as "astro-magical statues in existence in the contemporary pagan Hermeticism and Neoplatonism" (p. 33). Such awareness on the part of the authors of these two later texts suggests by analogy that the talmudic authors may have been engaged in a similar polemic against similar Hermetic magical practices. The final twist in the argument involves the location of the practices the talmudic authors would have had in mind. According to Idel, Hermetic and Hellenistic magical animation of statues were more likely to be found in Palestine than in Mesopotamia. Idel needs to explain why the passage occurs only in the Babylonian Talmud. His explanation involves the Palestinian origin of two of the figures mentioned in the San- hedrin passage, R. Hanina and R. Oshaya. It is not clear to this reviewer, however, why Hermetic practices of statue animation could not have existed in Mesopotamia. The extensive literature in Arabic on the practices of the Sabaeans of Harran (collected in Chwolsohn's pioneering study) focuses on precisely the kind of practices criticized in Sefer Hekhalot. According to Arabic writers, the Sabaeans of Harran constructed tem- ples modeled on precious stones, placed idols within each temple, and "drew down" the celestial deities into the idols, thus animating them. The Arabic texts even include speculation on whether or not the sounds produced by the statues were genuine or faked. These practices were explicitly attributed in some texts to Hermetic deities such as Agathodaemon. When such Hermetic magic would have come to Harran is an open question, but Idel offers no argument that it must have been after the period of the authors of the Babylonian Sanhedrin passage.' Until the truly vexing question of the provenance of Sefer Hekhalot is answered, a complete answer to these questions may elude us. Perhaps more important than agreement with every point in these detailed discus- sions are the various horizons which they will open up for further discussion. Idel's willingness to go out on a limb with the positions he takes is particularly effective in stimulating further questions. There are some limitations in style and composition. The syntax can be cumbersome (a second or a more rigorous copy-editing would have done much for the readability of this book). The organization of the book is at times convoluted. The Maharal, for example, is discussed at length before the reader is finally (on pp. 251-253) informed of the person and significance of R. Yehudah Loew ben Besalel of Prague.

In one place the author cites a long, opaque passage from R. Sadoq ha-Kohen of Lublin. After four attempts to understand the passage, this reader turned in desperation to the end of the passage and found this first line of commentary by Idel: "The author's intention is only clear in very general terms" (p. 223). It would have been more useful to the reader to have placed such a caution before the citation. If the issue of the provenance of Hermetic magical practices criticized in the Tal- mud and in 3 Enoch is an example of the intricate historical issues addressed in every chapter, the work also raises more theoretical issues. The central theme of the study, that the Golem changed forms in accordance with differing metaphysical systems, is argued within a rich and sophisticated literary, theological, and mystical context. The specific discussions of the four basic forms taken by the Golem in connection with differing systems constitute a significant achievement. The question now arises: what do these four forms tell us about the deeper theoretical issue, the meaning of ma'aseh bere'shit? It is a commonplace that early Jewish mysticism was divided into two basic categories, ma'aseh merkavah (the work of the chariot) and ma'aseh bere'shit (the work of creation). Ever since Scholem, we have been developing a deeper understand- ing and appreciation of merkavah mysticism. Bereshit mysticism, however, remains an enigma. What is its central principle? What is it all about? Perhaps these questions are premature, and should only be asked when the hori- zons opened up by Idel's explorations are fully explored. The virtue of this volume is that it prepares us to ask these questions in a more productive manner, particularly in the difficult interface between the magical and the mystical. The volume itself might have engaged these larger questions more directly had it placed them at the beginning, instead of starting with Scholem's position. After this groundbreaking series of probes, the author or someone else may wish to revisit the form outlined here and shape it anew. Although we now have a better sense of the different forms that the Golem took within differing cultural and intellectual contexts, the wider signi- ficance of the Golem in Jewish thought remains mute. Idel's rich study, with its care- ful grounding of various conceptions of the Golem in differing metaphysical con- texts, should provoke further efforts to make the Golem tell us more about the secret of ma'seh bere'shit-if, that is, it has anything further to say, and if we are equipped to hear it.
