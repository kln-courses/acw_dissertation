Low offers his own historical and theoretical development of the issues and draws upon the insights of present-day thinkers on life, such as Jonas and Uexk?ll. Rejecting a causal-mechanical Erkl?ren in favor of a Verstehen of nature deriving from "the ends of life," Low puts forward the concept of a Leib-Apriori within the broader notion of a psycho physical subjectivity as ground of a new teleological thinking. In the opposed viewpoints of the ancients on the essence of orga nism Low sees a joining of the issue for all subsequent philosophizing. The Presocratics, e.g., Empedocles, view life as a contingent emer gence from primordial beginnings through mechanical laws. For Low this means a reduction of the living to the lifeless, an obliteration of the "ontological uniqueness" (p. 53) of living creatures. This ontologi cal uniqueness first obtains its due in Aristotle, although Low is not primarily concerned with Aristotelian ontology. In Aristotle's teleol ogy, particularly its view of nature not in terms of mechanical neces sity but of "the normal," Low sees the approach of a Verstehen of liv ing nature and nature generally. Aristotle investigates the living creature not as an assemblage of parts but as a whole, functioning in accord with its norm through its own proper organs. Such an ap proach, says Low, is first made possible through the concept "organ," which has its source and legitimation in man's foreknowledge (Vorwis sen) of his own power to command his body in its purposive employ ment. Low's thesis comes as an eye-opener. Can we view the whole Aristotelian teleology in this way? Soon doubts begin to creep in. Is it Aristotle who claims such a legitimation, or is it such in the eyes of Low? Low points to Aristotle's favorite analogies with human techn? and his frequently anthropomorphic language for nature. Certainly teleology is anthropomorphic, argues Low, but as deriving from man's primary relation to his own self it is as much a precondition of man's thinking relation to nature as the Kantian a priori. Can there be a better example of anthropomorphism than Aristotle's love-motivated stellar movement? In the interests of a doctrine of Verstehen, L?w thus implies, we have much to gain in making Aristotle's teleology in dependent of his metaphysics. To this I think the answer might be: one thing at least is not gained but lost, namely, an insight into the Aristotelian effort per se and on its own terms to take up efficient into final causation. In taking up the empirical into the eternal, Aristotle does not intend merely to ground experience in an a priori. In saying that god is a life Aristotle is not only saying something about god but also that life is divine. In viewing Aristotelian teleology as a man-cen tered Verstehen L?w misses fundamental dimensions of Aristotle's comprehension of life. Where Aristotelian Normalit?t viewed terrestrial change as a regu larity of "for the most part," early modern science sees nature in terms of universal laws of mechanism. Teleological Verstehen gives way to an abstract mathematical intellectualism put into service of a mastery over nature. The mechanical model for organism, which for Aristotle was an analogy arising out of man's Vorwissen of his own bodily em</page><page sequence="3">792 DEREK CROSS AND STAFF ployment, becomes for the new causal-mechanical thinking an "exam ple" (p. 78). In presenting the scientific-historical background for Kant, Low focuses on certain main problems of biological thinking, such as origin and development, the orders of living nature, classifica tion, etc. Drawing upon his specialized knowledge of early modern medicine and physiology, Low deals with the controversies regarding ovulism and animalculism, preformation versus epig?nesis, and spon taneous generation. Low sees Kant as standing in the crosscurrent of a triumphant Newtonian mathematical physics on the one hand, and on the other an ebbing of mechanism's influence in biology due to the failure of the res extensa theory of nature to make good its promises concerning organic life. In the main section of his book Low ranges from the precritical writings of Kant to the Opus Postumum. He demands that we look at Kant afresh, that we be ready to revise or set aside certain fixed opin ions that regard the critical writings as the final word on life and na ture generally. Kant's thinking needs to be considered also in the con text of contemporary biological thinking. Hence Low weaves together with critical considerations some of the main issues of the previous chapter. We see how Kant views mechanistic explanation in biology, the doctrines of sensibility and irritability, spontaneous gen eration, etc. We learn the particulars of Kant's indebtedness to Boer haave, Blumenbach, Haller, and Kant's interest in the Brownian the ory of disease. Low effectively contrasts Kant's views on genesis and development with later Darwinian theory. But Low is not merely of fering a well-rounded survey. He means to argue that we cannot properly speak of "the" Kantian doctrine of organism (p. 227), that the philosopher's thinking on life and teleology presents a many-sided and continuous development, and indeed finally a "conversion." This is not to say that Low slights the critical problem. It emerges especially clearly in the exposition of Kant's meaning of the indivisibility of the organizing principle in living creatures. This principle can never de rive from those Anfangsgr?nde which make possible a mechanical sci ence of nature; but at the same time any claim that such a unifying principle is already present in matter would contradict the Anfangs gr?nde and mean the death of all natural philosophy. But for Low, as for many others, Kant's separate ways of approaching nature amount to a breach in the unity of experience. Here is where Low steps in with a rather audacious thesis. Kant's teleology can point the way to a genuine unity of experi ence. In the Critique of Judgment Low detects a movement on the part of Kant to go beyond the mechanistic view of nature in the Cri tique of Pure Reason and the Metaphysical Foundations of Natural Science. We obtain our notion of end (Zweck) not from objects, says Kant in the third Critique, but by an analogy to a subjective ground, namely, ourselves in our own causality. With this notion of end, which Kant expressly bars from constitutive employment, Low con nects his notion of the Leib-Apriori (pp. 137, 238-39), man's preintel lectual experience of his own body. The very notion of causality has its condition of possibility in man's "noncategorical experience of his</page><page sequence="4">SUMMARIES AND COMMENTS 793 own psychophysical totality, his having a body and being able to be a cause" (p. 289). Where the Kant of the first Critique derived from consciousness the a priori forms for a knowledge of nature as mecha nism, Low would derive from the psychophysical totality the ground of a teleological Verstehen of nature. But further, Low sees this as the intention of Kant himself. As in the case of the alleged Vorwissen in Aristotle, we immediately ask: where does Kant say anything like this? Low finds it in the Opus Postumum. Kant in his last years was occupied with the transition from the metaphysics of nature to its empirical investigation. In what many scholars regard as tentative probings, Kant in the Op. P. seems to be considering an extension of the transcendental subjectivity along cer tain lines, including those of Fichte's self-positing ego. Kant writes, for example, of our "consciousness of our own organization as a moving force of matter (Materie)" making possible for us "the notion of organic materiality (Stoff) and the tendency (Tendenz) toward physics as an organic system" (Academy Edition, vol. xxi, p. 190: Low, p. 18). This and a few other scattered remarks (e.g., Low, p. 215) provide vir tually all of Low's hardcore documentation. What forms Kant's late probings ultimately may have taken, what implications any extension of the transcendental self might have had for the whole Kantian archi tectonic are hardly clear. But any claim that Kant was preparing to abandon or radically transform his central position can only remain conjectural. To claim further that Kant was turning back towards an alleged Verstehen in Aristotle (p. 229) is to combine conjecture with problematic reconstruction. Just as Low claims to connect his Vorwissen with Aristotelian tele ology, he tries also to link his Verstehen with a Kantian apriori. Man's preintellectual prescience of his bodily employment, claims Low, is the condition for the possibility of an objective experience of nature (p. 39). But while "objective experience" has a very definite meaning in the Kantian a priori, Low never makes clear what he means by nature as an object. Kant, bent on connecting his a priori with empirical sci ence, seeks in the Op. P. for such a connection through a purported transcendental grounding for the concept of matter as ether. At least the intention in Kant seems clear, even if no solution is forthcoming. How Low would proceed to connect the Leib-Apriori with concepts for an empirical science remains a mystery. Even if we grant that our idea of cause derives from a preintellectual Vorwissen, where do we go from here? What categories from a Leib-Apriori that purportedly make objective experience possible will mediate nuclear physics with a teleological Verstehen? In his treatment of Aristotle and Kant, Low tends towards a post Nietzschean approach: look closely at the philosopher's words but be hind them for the meaning. But if Low's interpretations of his two main thinkers are problematic, they are also in the highest degree stimulating and challenging. Low's historical and background materi als abound with insights. The polemics against neomechanism: cyber netics, teleonomy, selfish-gene evolution, sociobiology, etc., are sprightly and effective. That the notion of a psychophysical totality</page><page sequence="5">794 DEREK CROSS AND STAFF can lead to a teleological thinking, that a Leib-Apriori can ground a new Verstehen of living and nonliving nature, has been argued at times brilliantly but not demonstrated.?M.G.</page></plain_text>
