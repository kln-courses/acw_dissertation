He has also criti- cized Christianity for its tendency to divide the world "into a world of matter and moral law and an overworld of spirit and love." As a result of this division, redemption cannot crown the work of creation but can only vanquish it. But for Judaism redemption is not redemption from evil but of evil, as "that powerwhich God created for his service and for the performance of his work"; and the work of redemption must take place not through the overcoming of the contra- dictions of life in some apocalyptic future but through their unification and consummation in the earthly present. In this redemption we are dependent on grace, but we must begin with ourselves. We cannot complete the work, but "only our beginning, our having begun, poor as it is, leads us to grace." In his last two sections on Zionism and the mission of Israel, Buber reiterates the prophetic demand that Israel manifest the righteousness of God as a community. To do this, Israel must have not only a land and language of its own but a renewed contact with its religious origins and an unshakable faith in the power of the spirit. If the means to the goal are in accord with the spirit of justice, the work of Israel will pre- vail. Only if Israel realizes the word of God in its own life can it bring great tidings to mankind. Buber's prophetic message of the spiritual task of Israel is of the greatest significance to- day as a reminder to triumphant political Zion- ism of its ultimate goal and of the means which must be taken to reach that goal. MAURICE S. FRIEDMAN University of Chicago Die Wiirde der Menschheit: Uber die erkennt- nisstheoretischen Voraussetzungen der Reli- gionsphilosophie bei?Kant. By IARALD EK- LUND. Uppsala: A. B. Lundequistska Bok- handeln, I947. i44 pages. Harald Eklund, of the University of Uppsala, continues in this volume the publication of his studies of the intellectual life of Central Europe. Seven years ago he published his work on reli- gious quality and morality in which he reached the conclusion that, despite recent attempts to avoid it, the fact is that religion has a moral foundation. The present volume presents the re- sults of his investigation into the epistemological presuppositions of Kant's philosophy of religion. This book is a carefully documented study of this important phase of Kant's thought in both the precritical and the critical eras. It will not prove easy reading, but it will prove intellectual- ly stimulating to those who will devote some time to it. The first part of the book traces Kant's teachings concerning Gefiihl. It will be remem- bered that the age in which Kant lived was pro- foundly interested in the nature of feeling. Rous- seau, Leibnitz, Wolff, and Teten all had some influence upon Kant's thinking in this field. He apparently accepted the view throughout much of his life that feeling referred to pleasure and pain ("Lust" and "Unlust"). But a more care- ful consideration of the Critique of Judgment (published late in Kant's life) leads Eklund to conclude that Kant meant much more by Gefiihl than the pleasure-pain complex. He conceived it as a cognitive instrument for the investigation of the inner life. Eklund asserts that at this point Kant became an empirical investigator; by means of the feelings he investigated the realm of subjective experience. This meant that he could no longer hold to the view that the inner life was essentially unknowable (pp. II7-I8). The conception of the dignity of man, based upon the feeling of the sublime in humanity, was for Kant an empirically derived conclusion. The significance of this general approach to the feelings was considered in the second part of the volume under consideration. The question of the distinction between right and wrong was one of the major problems of the eighteenth cen- tury. Allied to this was the problem of the rele- vance of morality to the truth of religion. Ac- cording to Eklund, Kant based his view of the moral judgment upon the primacy of the "un- analyzable feeling of the Good," which was the crucial fact in the moral equation. Furthermore, this "Gefiihl des Guten" provided the factual foundation for a valid philosophy of religion. Religion was for Kant the recognition of one's duties as divine commands. As such it was in it- self a moral theory and found its support in feel- ing (p. 123). Feeling thus became for Kant an organ of knowledge analogous to perception and reason (p. 128). At the same time he insisted that it was not only that; it was also the motivational factor in human activity, and it had its pleasure-pain quality. It is this which leads Eklund to declare that Kant was more than the "intellectual ma- chine" of philosophic tradition. He was, in fact, motivated much more by feeling and affection than is generally believed. I59</page></plain_text>
