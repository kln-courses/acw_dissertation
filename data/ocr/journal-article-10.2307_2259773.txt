V6T I Y8, Canada INTRODUCTION Recently, there have been a number of references to perceiving the vegetation in a com- munity from the 'plant's-eye-view' (Turkington 1975; Harper 1977, 1978; Turkington &amp; Harper 1979a, b; Fowler &amp; Antonovics 1981). It is interesting to ask questions about communities from the plant's-eye-view rather than from the usual anthropomorphic view- point, since the fitness of an individual plant is most influenced by those plants that make demands on the same environmental resources-primarily immediate neighbours. Investi- gations of interspecific association and community diversity have been dominated by the measurement of species presence-absence, cover, frequency etc. in quadrats (see review by Janson &amp; Vegelius 1981), but this scale is often too large and fails to document the finer-scale relationships that are immediately relevant to the individual plant's experience (see Mack &amp; Harper 1977). It can be argued that the biologically most meaningful analysis of vegetation would impose no anthropocentric scale, but would ask of the plants themselves how they sensed the composition of the community; this is to ask for a 'plant's- eye-view'. Various plotless sampling methods have been devised that permit questions to be asked concerning the nature of the community from the plant's-eye-view. Yarranton (1966) developed such a technique and applied it to a bryophyte-lichen community. This method was modified and used in pastures by Turkington (1975) and Turkington &amp; Harper (1979a, b); the method, called the 'contact sampling' method, was also used by Turkington, Cavers &amp; Aarssen (1977), Aarssen, Turkington &amp; Cavers (1979), Turkington &amp; Cavers (1979), and Saulei (1981). A modified form of the method has been used by Aarssen (1983). Further, Stowe &amp; Wade (1979) developed the speciesjuxtapositions method and species-regions method for an old field in Illinois, and Fowler &amp; Antonovics (1981) the neighbouring point analysis for a mown field in North Carolina. Ratcliffe (1983) has applied Stowe &amp; Wade's (1979) methods in the alpine zone of southern British Columbia, Canada. All of these methods focus attention on the way in which an individual plant experiences its environment of neighbours and they are sensitive and convenient for detect- ing fine-scale interspecific association. De Jong, Aarssen &amp; Turkington (1983) and Meagher &amp; Burdick (1980) have drawn attention to the frequent erroneous statistical treatment of data collected by various plotless methods. However, it would be unfortunate if pertinent questions in plant ecology could not be addressed adequately for lack of appropriate and available analyses. When the contact-sampling method is used to collect data, the usual method of ?

De Jong, Aarssen &amp; Turkington (1980) have presented and discussed a method of analysis where the data are tabulated in a K x K triangular (folded) contingency table in which the same categorization occurs on each margin and the leading diagonal is deleted. In this sampling method, K species form pairs (contact samples) in which the pair ij is not distinguished from j, i and species do not form pairs with themselves. Subsequently, de Jong, Aarssen &amp; Turkington (1983) dealt with a more general and realistic model and showed that, where it is possible to do so, it is preferable to tabulate and analyse the data by maintaining the distinction between ij and j,i pairs.

However, neither of these two papers dealt with exact numerical procedures to be followed in the context of folded tables. Folded tables present a problem partly because the construction of the usual tests for randomness requires a relatively clumsy numerical search. This paper describes means by which this search can be facilitated and the technique is used to reanalyse the data of Turkington &amp; Harper (1979a, b).</page><page sequence="4">126 Interspecific associations TABLE 1. continued.

The data were analysed (see Appendix) using chi-square methods but employing a general technique known as the EM algorithm (Dempster, Laird &amp; Rubin 1977) to construct the expected cell counts. The technique is here used in the context of the random pairing model P((ij]) pair) =p, qJ/(l - q) + pjqil(1 - qj), i = 1, 2, .. ., K, i &gt; 1, which is the folded counterpart to that presented in de Jong, Aarssen &amp; Turkington (1983).</page><page sequence="5">R.

Here P is the upper tail probability level calculated from normal tables and the standardized residual or z-value m,- Ii i,j= 1,2,...,K,i&gt;j, where m,1 is the observed number of i,j pairs and eij the estimated expected number. Values of C near 1 indicate significant positive association, near -1, significant negative association, and near 0, no significant association. For example, C &gt; 0.95 or C &lt; -0.95 corresponded to significant departures from randomness at P = 0.05.</page><page sequence="6">128 Interspecific associations CZ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ u CZ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ C)~~~~~~~~~</page><page sequence="7">R. TURKINGTON et al. 129 The discussion in de Jong, Aarssen &amp; Turkington (1983) stressed that P-values, or equi- valently C-values, are a statistical index of association reflecting both the absolute departures from random association comparing min, to e11, and the 'weight of evidence' being roughly related to the number of observations. Thus, C-values between different studies involving different numbers of observations are not strictly comparable. For this purpose a measure of departure from random association such as log,(mij/eij) might be more appropriate although now the significance of the departure is more difficult to gauge. Moreover, it should be realized that results in general, and C-values in particular, are dependent on species groupings and inclusion or exclusion of other species in the study. Also the various standardized residuals are not independent. An interspecific association diagram based on positive association detected by this statistic is presented in Fig. 1. Table Id and Fig. 1 are the counterparts of Table 1 and Fig. 6 in Turkington &amp; Harper (1979a). The contact sampling data from Turkington &amp; Harper (1979b) were also reanalysed.

First, there is often a marked over-estimation in the degree of negative interspecific associations and, secondly, there is a strong bias towards generating negative associations. Both biases are readily evident when Fig. 4 of Turkington &amp; Harper (1979b) is compared to Fig. 2 of this paper; compare especially the Trifolium repens-Lolium perenne association where most data points move from a weakly positive position to a significant (C &gt; 0.95) positive position. Also, the correct analysis yields an additional sixteen positive associations over the incorrect analysis. Similar increases in the number of significant positive associations using the correct analysis are shown in Fig. 1 relative to Fig. 6 of Turkington &amp; Harper (1979a). The reanalysis radically alters the patterns of interspecific associations but in neither case does it affect the general ecological conclusions previously reported; indeed the current analysis strengthens the previously reported arguments and conclusions. However, it is important to appreciate the inherent danger of adopting and applying well tried and tested analyses to relatively new situations where the assumptions underlying the statistical methods are violated.

(Received 21 December 1983) APPENDIX This appendix describes the statistical techniques used to construct tests for random association in the context of a folded matrix of counts derived from contact sampling. Suppose mij for i &gt; j is the number of contact pairs ij irrespective of order. To construct maximum likelihood expected cell counts assuming random pairing a two step procedure is used and iterated until convergence is achieved. The two steps form a single iterate of the EM algorithm described in Dempster, Laird &amp; Rubin (1977). The two steps themselves have to be tailored to the specific contact sampling situation, as outlined below, but appeal- ing to the general theory of the EM algorithm shows that convergence will be achieved. In the first step, called the E-step, assume there are available estimates of the basic parameters pi and qi and use these to construct expected value ni for the counts of the unfolded table such that n1j + nji = mij for i &gt; j. It may be shown that these expected values are given by n ij mI 1-qi |(-qi 1-q- From these expected value ni additionally calculate the intermediate quantities fi = n., s1= E nil. Given the f and s, values, now execute the second, or M-step, of the algorithm to derive updated estimates of the pi and qi. These formulae follow those given by de Jong, Aarssen &amp; Turkington (1983) and are pi =f1/N, rI i = Si (N -si g-fi- fj nj), i = 1929 ... ., K qi = fli/(l + Hi1), where the second equation must be iterated in order to find a solution. The updated values for the pi and qi serve as input to the next E-step and the whole process is repeated until stable values are obtained. As stated before, such convergence is guaranteed. Starting values for the pi and qi may be taken as E mj1/2 and E mji/2. The final pi and qi serve to define the expected maximum likelihood cell counts (Table 1 b) as follows: ei1 = Npi qj/(l -qi) and from these we calculate the standardized residuals (Table 1c) (min - eij)//eij. Under the hypothesis of random pairing these are approximately standard normal and hence values far away from zero (compared to normal tables) indicate deviations from random pairing. Negative values indicate negative associations and vice versa. It is clear that the whole estimation process is relatively time consuming and this argues for the retention of order information in contact sampling whenever possible.</page></plain_text>
