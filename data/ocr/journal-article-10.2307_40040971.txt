<plain_text><page sequence="1">Daydreams and Anarchy: A Defense of Anomalous Mental Causation NICK ZANGWILL Durham University Philosophy and P he no meno logical Research Vol. LXXIII, No. 2, September 2006 Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards. Goethe Must mental properties figure in psychological causal laws if they are causally effica- cious? And do those psychological causal laws give the essence of mental properties? Contrary to the prevailing consensus, I argue that, on the usual conception of laws that is in play in these debates, there are in fact lawless causally efficacious properties both in and out of the philosophy of mind. I argue that this makes a great difference to the phi- losophical relevance of empirical psychology. I begin by making the case that revolu- tions and hurricanes are lawless phenomena, before arguing for a similar thesis about creativity, love, courage, dreams, daydreams, and musings. Furthermore, the empirical research on these phenomena suggests that the philosophical issues may be independent of what empirical psychology can tell us. Is the human mind bound by laws? Many philosophers believe that mental properties figure in psychological laws. There are two mains reasons why they believe this. The first is that it is necessary for the causal efficacy of mental properties; the second is that it is necessary if mental properties are to have natures or constitutive essences. That is, firstly, mental properties are causally efficacious and can be causal efficacious only if they figure in psy- chological laws; and secondly, mental properties have natures (or constitutive essences) and these natures are given by the psychological laws in which the mental properties figure. The existence of psychological laws is thought to be philosophically important for these two reasons. It is also why many philosophers think that empirical psychology is relevant to philosophy. The usual idea is that empirical psychology discovers the laws binding mental properties, or else it discovers the sub-personal (neurological or computa- tional) mechanisms that underpin psychological capacities that are manifested in lawful ways; and since those laws explain the causal efficacy or uncover the natures of mental properties, empirical psychology is philosophically relevant. However, in this paper, I shall argue that not all mental properties DAYDREAMS AND ANARCHY 253</page><page sequence="2">are bound by psychological laws that explain their efficacy or give their natures. So empirical psychology cannot play the philosophical role that philosophers envisage, at least in respect of those mental properties. I proceed as follows. In section 1, I set up the issues over mental causa- tion, natures and laws. Those who are impatient may wish to skim or even skip to section 2, where the argument begins. There I consider a range of examples of mental properties that are not usually discussed in the philoso- phy of mind, and I argue that these mental properties are efficacious and have natures despite not figuring in psychological laws of the sort usually envis- aged. There are many anomalous causally efficacious mental properties. In section 3, 1 turn to consider a weaker conception of psychological law and I argue that even where there are these weaker laws, they neither explain the causal efficacy nor give the natures of the mental properties under discussion. I then consider consequences of this result; in particular, I consider contra- nomic causation, counterfactuals and a non-nomic explanation of causal effi- cacy. In section 4, 1 consider a particular explanation of the anomalousness of properties and explore that explanation in the cases of sandpiles, human his- tory and mental properties. Lastly, in section 5, I spell out the consequences for the philosophy of mind. The main conclusion is that we should learn to live with anomalous causal efficacy. However, there is also a general meth- odological implication concerning the relevance of empirical psychology to philosophical questions about the efficacy and nature of the mind. I end with suggestions for fruitful research. ยง1. Setting Up the Issues ยง1. 1 Mental Properties and Causal Efficacy: The Nomic View Many philosophers of mind think that if mental properties are causally effi- cacious, then, although they need not figure in exceptionless or strict laws, they must at least figure in non-strict laws - that is, laws that hold other things being equal. Statements of non-strict laws are hedged with what are called ceteris paribus clauses. Perhaps the apparent moderation of this view makes it popular. I shall call this the nomic view.1 Probably the most prominent and resourceful defender of this view is Jerry Fodor (see in particu- lar Fodor 1989). But many others agree with him. Although the nomic view is popular, there are some philosophers who resist it. Simulation theorists, for example, reject it (Heal 1986, Gordon 1986). And Barry Loewer and Ernest Le Pore offer a counterfactual account of causal efficacy (Loewer and Lepore 1987). But the nomic view is probably the default view in contemporary philosophy of mind. Philosophers tend to hold the nomic view, other things being equal. 254 NICK ZANGWILL</page><page sequence="3">I shall argue that it is not the case that causally efficacious mental proper- ties do in fact always figure in non-strict laws. I shall give examples, and diagnose the source of their anomalousness. The nomic view I take as my target needs to be qualified in two respects, although these qualifications are not made by those who embrace the view. The first, less important qualification, is that the nomic view does not itself imply that all mental properties are bound by laws. For there could in princi- ple be some mental properties that lack causal efficacy, and they need not figure in laws. Or perhaps some instantiations of a mental property are caus- ally efficacious while others are not. The real issue is about those mental property instantiations that are causally efficacious, and the nomic view should really be just that they figure in laws. The second, more important point, is that the issue is not really about whether all causally efficacious mental properties in fact do figure in laws. The issue is whether their causal efficacy depends on figuring in laws. Perhaps there are causally efficacious mental properties that figure in laws but their causal efficacy does not derive from those laws. However, the nomic view says, or should say, that mental properties are causally efficacious in virtue of being bound by laws. Thus, when I argue that some causally efficacious mental properties do not figure in laws, it is way of casting doubt on whether mental properties must figure in non-strict laws and thus on whether the causal efficacy of mental properties depends on figuring in non-strict laws. Taking this on board makes a sig- nificant difference, as we shall see. It is this nomic theory of the causal effi- cacy of mental properties, thus modified, that I take as my target here. ยง1.2 Laws, Knowledge, Meanings For the time being, I shall deploy the conception of non-strict law that Fodor deploys, along with many others. Fodor writes: "... if it's a law that M -&gt; B ceteris paribus, then it follows that you get Bs whenever you get Ms and the ceteris paribus conditions are satisfied" (Fodor 1989, p. 152, his emphasis). He also writes: "... hedged (including intentional) laws necessitate the con- sequents when their ceteris paribus conditions are discharged" (Fodor 1989, p. 152). We can put Fodor's idea in terms of conditionals: if it is a strict law that one property instantiation follows another, then the second property will be instantiated if the first property is instantiated. But if the law is a non- strict or hedged law, then the second property will be instantiated if the first property is instantiated and certain contingent conditions are met. These contingent conditions are the 'ceteris paribus' conditions, and they are the background causal conditions that are conjoined with the instantiation of the first property when the second follows. The law linking those two properties is a non-strict law, since the second property is instantiated only given the obtaining of the ceteris paribus condition. DAYDREAMS AND ANARCHY 255</page><page sequence="4">Two remarks: (A) I shall assume that laws always involve cross-time relations between instantiations of properties, since these are the kind of laws that are relevant to the discussion. This will simplify matters later on. (B) There is some connection between laws and predictability on this view, but it is quite weak. If it is a law that As cause Bs then there is sense in which in principle Bs could be predicted on the basis of knowledge of As by someone who knows the law. But complexity might mean that prediction is impossible for creatures like us (Cummins 2000). Even comparatively simple 'three body' physical systems yield surprisingly intractable unpredict- ability within a short time. Or a system may not have closed boundary condi- tions. On the other hand, if there are regularities and predictability (such as in the timing and height of the tides) then it is likely that there are laws that explain the regularity. Now this conception of laws assumes - rightly in my view - that laws are objective relations between properties, rather than something linguistic, semantic or epistemic. The claim that mental properties figure in non-strict laws says nothing about anyone's knowledge of mental properties or of the laws in which they figure. And it says nothing about the meanings of sen- tences that refer to such properties and laws. However, many philosophers maintain that certain statements of psychological laws have a status attaining or approaching that of 'analyticity', in the sense that they collectively define what we mean when we talk of mental properties. They are sometimes said to be platitudes of 'folk psychology'. (See, for example, Armstrong 1968, Lewis 1972, 1980, Shoemaker 1975, Churchland 1984, Braddon-Mitchell and Frank Jackson 1996.) On this view, mental concepts are concepts of proper- ties or states that have certain lawlike causal roles.2 It is a conceptual truth that mental properties instantiate psychological laws. So, to think that some- thing instantiates a mental property is to think that it instantiates psycho- logical laws. Let us call this the folk nomic view. One prominent version of folk nomism is what is called 'analytic func- tionalism', according to which mental concepts are the concepts of properties or states that have specific types of lawlike causal roles. As far as the pure metaphysics of mental properties goes, analytic functionalists believe that it is essential to mental properties to be 'realized' in other properties that have certain causal properties. So mental properties have second-order causal prop- erties. That is, to be a mental state (that is, to instantiate a mental property) is to instantiate certain non-mental properties that have certain causal proper- ties. But in itself, folk nomism involves no commitment to realization and second-order causal properties. Folk nomism includes analytic functionalism as a special case. Generic folk nomism only claims that it is essential to our A 'description theory' of the meaning of names of mental properties is true. 256 NICK ZANGWILL</page><page sequence="5">thought about mental properties that we believe that there are psychological laws that bind them. On all such views, however, the property is baldly iden- tified with the causal role, so there is not much explaining of causal efficacy to be done. The explanation is trivial. However, the laws are also supposed to give the natures of the properties, and that is less trivial. The folk nomic view is both a view of mental properties and of our con- ception of mental properties. It is their nature to have certain lawlike causal roles and we conceive of those properties as having those lawlike causal roles. Some philosophers of mind accept the nomic view but reject the folk nomic view. They deny that the non-strict psychological laws that give the natures and explain the efficacy of mental properties are built into folk psy- chology, but they still think that mental properties must be bound by non- strict laws that give their natures and explain their efficacy (Lycan 1988, Rey 1996). The folk nomic view is the conjunction of the nomic view of the effi- cacy and nature of mental properties with epistemic and semantic theses. So if I can show that the nomic view is false, I will thereby have shown that the conjunction is also false. ยง1.3 The Lawless Mind According to the nomic view - folk or non-folk - there are non-strict psy- chological causal laws binding mental properties; and it is in virtue of these laws that mental properties are causally efficacious, and these laws give the nature of the properties. The question is: why should we believe this? Why can't there be anomalous causally efficacious mental properties? The position that the mental is anomalous is one that is often associated with Donald Davidson (Davidson 1980, essays 9-11). But I am interested in making room for a position that is considerably stronger than Davidson's. Davidson does not deny the existence of psychological laws (as he is some- times misinterpreted). All he denies is the existence of strict psychological laws. However, I say we should deny the existence of even non-strict psy- chological laws, at least for a significant range of mental properties. Of course, Davidson himself is not interested in accounting for the causal effi- cacy or nature of mental properties, since he does not believe in properties of any sort. For him properties are just categories under which we slot events. The view I am sympathetic with is, I suppose, a vaguely Davidson/an posi- tion; but it is not Davidson's. The view I defend is that many mental proper- ties are utterly anomalous, by which I mean that there are no strict or non- strict laws binding them. The position that all mental properties are utterly anomalous has something to be said for it, but I will not consider that posi- tion in this paper. Utterly anomalous properties - if there are any - are caus- ally efficacious and have their natures despite their lawlessness. I shall argue that many causally efficacious mental properties are utterly anomalous. DAYDREAMS AND ANARCHY 257</page><page sequence="6">Three comments: (A) The utterly anomalous position is compatible with the thesis that causal relations are always underpinned by laws of some sort relating the objects or events that are causally related; so if an object or event possesses a causally efficacious mental property, it must have some properties that instantiate a strict or non-strict law (for example, a physical law). The idea is just that there need not be non-strict laws binding the mental properties themselves. That is: it may well be true that if a mental property is causally efficacious, then there is some strict or non-strict physical law that subsumes the thing that has the mental property; but that can be true even though the mental property itself does not figure in non-strict laws. The thing has other properties that figure in laws. (B) The utterly anomalous position about certain mental properties is compatible with accepting developmental laws involving those properties. Our mental capacities develop from our conception in regular ways (Cum- mins 2000). Developmental empirical psychology might tell us how we come to have capacities to have mental properties of a certain general kind. Furthermore, evolutionary theory might tell us why we are creatures that have those capacities. But both explanatory projects would not tell us what it is that has those developmental or evolutionary origins, and it would not tell us how the mental states that are the exercise of the capacity cause what they do. Perhaps it is true that we have such states as a consequence of a very specific history. But that does not mean that there are laws linking these mental properties with other mental properties of the sort that nomists expect. Laws concerning the origin of capacities to have propositional atti- tudes of some sort do not imply laws binding those propositional attitudes. (C) One can hold the utter anomalousness view compatibly with holding that there must be true generalizations about mental properties if we are to know about other people and about ourselves. Perhaps knowledge of mental states requires knowing true generalizations that the folk nomists think are the folk psychological 'platitudes' that define mental properties. Perhaps we know others by subsuming them under these psychological generalizations. But this leaves open the possibility that there is a mental reality beyond those epistemic limits. For a full-blooded realist about the mental, there are facts about mental states that transcend our ability to know them.3 Indeed, it is an important part of our psychological knowledge that we know that the generalizations we know are of limited use. We know that some of our men- tal life has no psychological explanation. This is common sense. Some 3 Here again I probably depart from Davidson himself, since his anomalism seems to be tied to his 'interpretationism' about psychological attributions. Davidson's interpreta- tionism seems to be opposed to the full-blooded realist idea that what it is to be a mental state is metaphysically distinct from interpretation. 258 NICK ZANGWILL</page><page sequence="7">people are a mystery to us! Even those we know well are a mystery some- times and in certain respects. Our common sense psychological knowledge itself tells us that its explanations will not always work. It recognizes its own limitations. I shall argue for and explain this uncompromising anti-nomist view in this paper. The issue has important consequences concerning the scope of philosophy and empirical psychology. A theme running through this paper is cautious skepticism about what empirical psychology can do for philosophy. If psychological laws binding mental properties existed, then such laws might explain the efficacy of mental properties or reveal their natures; and thus if scientific psychology discovers psychological laws, or discovers the sub-personal mechanisms that constitute psychological capacities that are lawfully manifested, these discoveries will be relevant to those two philoso- phical matters. But if there are no such laws, then empirical psychology is not philosophically relevant, at least in those two respects. Furthermore, per- haps somewhat paradoxically, I shall, at various points in the paper, draw on research in empirical psychology to argue in precisely in the opposite direc- tion from that which many philosophers envisage. This research, I argue, positively supports the idea that there are no laws, at least for many mental properties. So while empirical psychology does not tell us about the causal efficacy and natures of many mental properties, it does have a negative phi- losophical relevance: it tells us that empirical psychology is not relevant to philosophy in the way that many philosophers think. Let us now proceed to the argument. ยง2. Examples of Anomalous Efficacious Properties ยง2. 1. Revolutions and Hurricanes The possibility of anomalous causally efficacious properties seems to be open. It is certainly open as far as anyone has argued. But is it really open? How can we argue about whether non-strict psychological laws are or are not necessary for the causal efficacy of mental properties? How can we argue for or against the thesis that there are anomalous causal efficacious mental prop- erties? Since we are primarily concerned with actuality, I shall argue from actual examples of anomalous properties rather than from mere thought experi- ments. I shall first give two kinds of non-mental examples of anomalous properties, before turning to examples of anomalous mental properties. We can be softened up for the possibility of anomalous properties in the philoso- phy of mind if we can recognize them elsewhere. Consider the revolutions that swept through Eastern Europe in 1989. Were they bound by laws? Earlier I separated laws and predictability; but let us nevertheless ask: how many predicted those revolutions? The answer is DAYDREAMS AND ANARCHY 259</page><page sequence="8">spectacular and embarrassing: nobody! Absolutely nobody. This is an extraor- dinary and humbling fact. Political pundits, Solidarity activists, Gdansk shipyard workers, Communist leaders and party members, Western politi- cians, Western and Eastern-bloc social scientists, historians, philosophers, journalists, science-fiction writers: it took everybody by complete surprise (see Levesque 1997). Clearly, no one at that time knew any reliable historical non-strict laws concerning the causes of revolutions!4 And I haven't heard of any astonishing breakthroughs since then. If we knew revolutionary generali- zations and could predict revolutions reliably then that would give us reason to think that they are bound by laws. But we lack that reason. Not only does no one know historical laws concerning revolutions - strict or non- strict - there is also no reason to believe that there are such laws at work. Of course, someone might piously assert that there are historical laws still to be discovered, even though none are yet known by historians. But if there were such historical laws, surely clever historians would have discovered them by now. It seems that only a philosophical prejudice could make us think that there must be unknown historical laws. Consider the effects of revolutions. Revolutions sometimes cause dictatorships. Why must there be a law to the effect that revolutions cause dictatorships other things being equal? Some- times revolutions don't cause dictatorships. Is there a law that says under what conditions they do cause dictatorships and under what conditions they don't? My point here is both the negative point that we have no reason to believe that there are such laws and also the positive inductive argument that since no one has yet come up with such a historical law, there probably aren't any to be had. I give further reasons to disbelieve in historical laws below in section 4.2. Secondly, consider the weather. (This was one of Davidson's early exam- ples; Davidson 1963, p. 17.) Are there laws of any kind connecting hurri- canes and catastrophes? Surely not. There is no non-strict law to the effect that hurricanes tend to lead to catastrophes, other things being equal.5 These two cases are similar. Sometimes hurricanes cause catastrophes, and sometimes they don't; sometimes revolutions cause dictatorships, and some- times they don't. But we have no generalizable explanation of why they do 4 It is obviously not that people knew the laws but faced problems of complexity or leaky boundary conditions. 5 Whether or not a catastrophe occurs can depend on incidental facts. For example, a flood might cause an art-historical catastrophe only because certain valuable artworks happened to be temporarily transferred to the museum's basement when the flood hap- pened. And a flood might cause a humanitarian catastrophe in certain circumstances but not in others. Earthquakes of similar strengths have very different humanitarian conse- quences depending on building regulations and their enforcement. This explains the dif- ference between the effect of the earthquake in Bam, Iran in 2003, which killed tens of thousands of people, and the similar earthquake in Los Angeles, USA in 1994, which killed only a handful. 260 NICK ZANGWILL</page><page sequence="9">when they do, and of why they don't when they don't. So we have no reason to think that there is a law at work. It is true that once we know that there is a hurricane or a revolution in progress, there may be some true generaliza- tions, and we might be able to make some short-term predictions: there will be fences blown down; there will be shortages of goods in the shops. And given that hurricanes are centers of low pressure, and given other facts, we might know that things caught in hurricanes tend to move anti-clockwise (in the northern hemisphere). But over the longer term, and in detail, we are at a loss. There are no long-term regularities to which we can appeal in order to predict catastrophes given hurricanes or to predict dictatorships given revo- lutions, despite their evident causal connection in many particular cases. Not only does no one know any true generalizations that might be the basis of predictions, there is no reason to believe that there are any. In the case of hurricanes and revolutions, there is causation - often with a vengeance! The properties of being a hurricane and being a revolution are clearly causally efficacious properties: houses collapse, heads roll! Contrast these cases with Davidson's example of the properties of being the event reported on page 5 of Tuesdays Times and being the event reported on page 13 of Wednesday's Tribune (Davidson 1980, p. 17). These properties of the events are intuitively not causally efficacious with respect to catastrophes and dictatorships, by contrast with being a hurricane and being a revolution. (Not unless people reading about the event on that particular page were somehow causally significant.) We can deploy defeasible counterfactual criteria of caus- ally efficacious properties to catch the difference. We can sometimes say that if an event had not had the property of being a hurricane then the ensuing catastrophe would not have occurred; and we can sometimes say that if an event had not had the property of being a revolution then the ensuing dicta- torship would not have arisen. (There might be no common cause operating in these cases to defeat the counterfactual criteria.) But such counterfactuals fail for the case of the property of being reported on page 5 of the Times. The newspaper editor might easily have decided to run another story on page 5, but the event reported on page 13 of Wednesday's Tribune would have occurred just the same. In the hurricane and revolution cases, there is causation without laws, and because of this there is explanation without predictability. After the event, we can explain why a particular catastrophe occurred by citing a particular hurricane; and after the event we can explain why a particular dictatorship occurred by citing a particular revolution. But given the information that a hurricane or revolution is in progress, there are no laws to know such that we could predict whether a catastrophe or a dictatorship will occur (even if noth- ing interferes). We lack knowledge of even roughly true general statements about these types of phenomena. No one knows any plausible long-term DAYDREAMS AND ANARCHY 261</page><page sequence="10">generalizations - strict or non-strict - concerning these properties; and there is no reason to believe that there are any waiting to be discovered. Nevertheless, there are perfectly good retrospective explanations - explanations that trace the causal history of that particular property instantiation. They are 'post facto' explanations (see Hobbs 1993). In sum, it is plausible that the properties of being a hurricane and of being a revolution are utterly anomalous. We have causation, yet - apart from very short periods of time, or apart from very broad parameters over the longer term - we have nothing remotely like laws involving the properties of being a hurricane and of being a revolution, and we have nothing remotely like pre- dictability when we describe the events as 'hurricanes' and as 'revolutions'. I add "apart from very broad parameters" because even though there may be no laws to the effect that hurricanes lead to catastrophes, it is perhaps a law that hurricanes will not spawn a flock of winged pink elephants, flying in forma- tion, and singing the national anthem. And even though there are no laws to the effect that revolutions lead to dictatorships, it is perhaps a law that revo- lutions will not lead to a society of androgynous four-headed beings whose main interest is stamp-collecting. Perhaps there are negative laws of this sort, and perhaps we can know them, and, on the basis of that knowledge, issue reliable (but not very interesting) negative predictions.6 ยง2.2 Creativity, Courage and Love The general possibility of utterly anomalous yet causally efficacious proper- ties thus seems to be open. The properties of being a revolution and of being a hurricane look like examples. The interesting question for those interested in the mind is whether human psychology is similarly lawless. I think that it is, at least in part. Let us note in passing that the idea that the mind is lawless has consider- able introspective phenomenological appeal - at least to some of us! But these days there is little faith in the deliverances of introspective phenome- nology. So we need another argument. Before we proceed to some examples, I want to lodge a complaint about the way that the folk nomists use examples when they introduce their view. Their view is typically promulgated by an unsupported generalization from a paltry few 'paradigms'. We are presented with a list of various prosaic exam- ples of general claims that are alleged to state non-strict laws (for example: 6 Another widely accepted example of anomalous causal efficacy comes from evolution- ary history. The aerodynamic shape of a creature's proto 'wing* fact might mean that it just made it across a river and was not eaten by a crocodile. That creature might be a necessary causal precursor to the existence of some aerodynamically advance winged creature today, despite the lack of laws connecting the two aerodynamic properties of the creatures. Luck has a vast role in the causal history of whatever organisms happen to exist. (See also Bury 1916, p. 68.) 262 NICK ZANGWILL</page><page sequence="11">"Persons in pain tend to want to relieve that pain", and "Persons who feel thirst tend to desire drinkable fluids" (Churchland 1984, p. 58)). We are then surreptitiously encouraged to think "And so on". Philosophers of mind thus quickly and easily arrive at the conclusion that there are folk psychological laws for all elements of psychological vocabulary. They produce a list of a few plausible examples, and then generalize wildly on the basis of them. But the generalization is questionable. We are given no reason at all to believe that we conceive of all or even most of our mental life as bound by such non- strict laws. The considerations that the folk nomists put forward in favor of their view, as a general thesis, are notably unconvincing. This is one reason why it is important to explore other sorts of examples. I am interested in examples of mental phenomena that are less prosaic than those usually discussed in the philosophy of mind. Let us begin, as a preliminary, with some reflections on creativity, courage and love. There are perhaps certain folk or scientific non-strict laws concerning the effects of creativity, courage and love. Perhaps creative people tend to have interesting ideas or create beautiful things. Perhaps courageous people tend not to be as deterred by the belief that something is dangerous as non-coura- geous people. And perhaps those who are in love tend to care for the object of their love. But these non-strict laws (if such they are) only take us forwards to effects not backwards to causes. It seems not to be the case that these mental properties have lawlike causes. Does creativity have lawful causes? Does bravery? Are there laws that govern who people fall in love with and when? Surely not. Scientific psychologists have not, I gather, managed to acquire credible theories involving lawlike generalizations covering these phenomena, such that they can use these generalizations to predict what will happen. And if no one knows such laws now, why should we believe that there are any? The idea there must be some such laws - somewhere - seems to be an article of faith. Moreover it is even more certain that we do not have folk psychological laws concerning the causes of these phenomena. We might muse whimsically "If only we did!" In the cases of creativity, courage and love, there seem to no standard causes at all, whether purely physical stimuli or other mental states. These mental properties have a typical causal role only with respect to their effects. Perhaps this should not seem particularly puzzling. After all, it is common in science to postulate the existence of something in order to explain certain observed events - an extra planet, for instance. And some would admit such a scenario in the case of quantum physics, where particle spin has effects but no causes. But that is usually seen as a special case, which we should not extend to the everyday categories in the philosophy of mind. It would be a little odd and disappointing to find that defenders of the nomic view have absolutely no idea concerning the lawlike mental or physical causes of certain DAYDREAMS AND ANARCHY 263</page><page sequence="12">mental phenomena. Pain and perceptual experience at least have standard physical causes. But creativity, courage and love do not even have that.7 ยฃ2. 3 Daydreams, Dreams and Musings Now to my main examples. Consider the flow of thoughts when we are day- dreaming or dreaming or when we are musing to ourselves. Maybe it is true that when we are daydreaming, we tend to be less attentive to our surround- ings. There may be roughly true generalizations about people who are day- dreaming, dreaming or musing about something or other. Perhaps they tend not to be attentive to what is going on around them. But there are no true psychological generalizations concerning daydreams, dreams or musings that are content specific - that is, there are no true generalizations about day- dreams, dreams or musings about so-and-so or that such-and-such. We cer- tainly have no reason to believe that there are such laws yet to be discovered. Daydreams, dreams and musings are therefore different from creativity, cour- age and love in that there are no non-strict laws concerning their causes or effects. There are no content-specific true generalizations about daydreams, dreams or musings, that science can discover; and it is even more certain that there are no content-specific generalizations that define what we mean by "daydream", "dream" or "muse". Let us linger a moment longer on daydreams - (an activity at which I am something of an expert!) Daydreams do not consist of beliefs and desires, but of entertained thoughts? Perhaps we should go along with the folk nomic view in thinking that beliefs and desires have their folk non-strict laws. For example, perhaps it is a non-strict law that a belief is something that, other things being equal, would combine with a desire with the relevantly matching content so as to produce an intention. Let us concede the existence of these kind of laws, for the sake of argument. Merely entertained thoughts, by contrast, are not bound by such laws. Daydreams have their own inner dynamic - a kind of crazy internal logic perhaps, but nothing approaching a pattern that we might recognize. There seem to be no non-strict laws about According to the Armstrong/Lewis folk nomic view, mental states are states with a cer- tain standard nomic causal role, both with respect to input and outputs from and to other mental states, and from and to physical states (stimulus and response). In most cases, the causal role with respect to other mental states is thought to go both forwards and back- wards - to mental causes and mental effects. However, in some cases, such as physical pain and perceptual experiences, the only causes are thought to be physical input, such as damage to the body or the presence of something nearby. In such cases, there is no mental cause. Such cases are unlike the cases I am focusing on, where there are no lawlike causes, mental or physical. If there must be laws corresponding to causal rela- tions, then there is a danger, in the cases of creativity, courage and love, that we will be is stuck with the curious position of the opposite of traditional epiphenomenalism: these mental states have effects but no causes. David Velleman discusses the causal and motivational role of imagination (Velleman 2000). Imagining something is a cognitive state other than belief. 264 NICK ZANGWILL</page><page sequence="13">how daydreams will unfold. Daydreams seem neither to have lawful mental causes nor lawful mental effects. Yet it is also common sense that daydreams are real features of our mental life, which on particular occasions are caused and are causally efficacious. Daydreaming about Kew Gardens might, on a particular occasion, be caused by seeing a cactus in a flower shop. Daydream- ing about Kew Gardens might on a particular occasion cause me to daydream about Kibble Palace. And daydreaming about Kew Gardens might, on a par- ticular occasion, cause me to slightly dent a lamp-post by walking into it. But no laws underpin these particular causal relations (except between the non-mental, physical properties of the events). Daydreams are lawless, but they are no less real or causally efficacious for that. We have the counterfac- tual: had I not had the property of daydreaming about Kew Gardens then I would not have had the property of daydreaming about Kibble Palace. What makes that counterfactual true is a particular causal relation between an instantiation of one mental property and an instantiation of another. Laws involving these mental properties are not required. Daydreams are a counter- example to the nomic view of mental properties. And what goes for day- dreams also goes for dreams and musings. If we consider the undirected thought of daydreams or musings, we can see how each thought led to the next; each was no accident given the last. Each thought unfolded from its predecessor. But such understanding is entirely post facto. Such explanation and understanding is retrospective not prospective. It was not the case that one thought caused the next in a lawlike way, and it is not that one can be predicted given knowledge of the other. We have expla- nation without laws or predictability.9 Some super-Freudian theory, which delivers non-folk laws for these men- tal phenomena is, I suppose conceivably true but we have absolutely no reason to expect this. Freud's own explanations of dreams were highly per- son-specific (Freud 1976). They fail to correspond to the nomic model. He does not provide us with generalizations that could be the basis of predictions of the dream contents of other people. What he does is to try to show how, after the event, it was no accident that a certain person had a certain dream.10 No one knows any non-strict laws that bind dreams with a specific content to other dreams with other contents, or to other kinds of contentful psychologi- 9 Mary McCarthy's novel The Group is written in 'free indirect discourse1 such that it appears to let us intimately listen in to the rambling flow of her character's undirected private thoughts (McCarthy 1954). It seems like one is having the thoughts oneself. Freud does not have a nomic theory of dream content. Anyway, that would not be neces- sary for on-the-couch interactive 'analysis'. But for doubts about the entire psychoanalytic enterprise of dream analysis, Freudian or any other, see Hobson 2002, which I comment on in footnote 12 below.

The reason is that there are none to be found.11 ยง2.4 Beliefs about Daydreams, Dreams and Musings: The One Law Scenario A possible reply to my argument, on behalf on the nomist, would be to say that there are laws connecting daydreams with beliefs about daydreams. Per- haps there is a law to the effect that daydreams about p typically cause the belief that we are daydreaming about p. In responding to this suggestion, we should first note that even if this were true, it would be pretty lame if it were supposed to be the only law binding daydreams. There are presumably many other kinds of mental state besides daydreams for which there also seem at most to be laws binding these states to beliefs about them. Since those laws are the same for all these dif- ferent kinds of mental states, there would be a problem about how such states are to be distinguished. For example, what distinguishes daydreaming that p from wondering whether p? The law connecting daydreams with beliefs about daydreams, and the law connecting wonderings with beliefs about wonderings, are similar, and thus there is not enough to distinguish these different kinds of mental states from each other. Furthermore, since the law binding daydreams to beliefs about daydreams is a non-strict law, it can fail. This means that it is possible to have day- dreams without having beliefs about them. We are certainly not infallible in our memory beliefs about daydreams. And it is not plausible that we always have beliefs about daydreams while we are having them. Sometimes we just have them. (This is especially obvious in the case of dreams.) So if there is a law linking daydreams with beliefs about daydreams, it is definitely not strict. But, since the network of laws is supposed to give the nature of the property, we lack an understanding of how, when the non-strict law fails, we still have a case of the mental property. How can exceptions to the only non-strict law binding a property still involve that property? The nomist might say that 11 What about the standard examples of purely psychological non-strict generalizations (for instance, that people try to get what they want) that I have not questioned? The possibility I have so far left open is that these are cases of genuine laws, as the nomic view says, but that the other examples that I have highlighted are not. So some of the mind is lawbound while some is not. (Thus my arguments here have nothing in common with Stephen Schif- fer's in his (1991), since he recommends a quite general skepticism about the notion of a non-strict ceteris paribus law). In fact, I also hold that we need to seek a quite different metaphysical and semantic account of ordinary folk-psychological thought and talk from the view that folk psychology is a theory positing non-strict laws binding mental proper- ties. That is, I reject the 'theory theory'. I cannot go into this here. (See Zangwill 1998, 2005.) However, even if folk psychology does not generally posit non-strict laws and the theory-theory is false, there are still true generalizations corresponding to at least many of the standard 'platitudes'. By contrast, such true generalizations are lacking for the mental phenomena I am interested in. 266 NICK ZANGWILL</page><page sequence="15">when the law fails, the mental property instantiation is nevertheless of the same sort as the mental property instantiation when the law holds. But this reply is unavailable, since we lack any idea of what would make the two mental property instantiations of the same kind. In his paper "Non-strict laws and Psychological Explanation" (Fodor 1991), Fodor concedes that there may be what he calls 'absolute exceptions' to non-strict psychological laws, where what should follow a mental property ceteris paribus does not. But he thinks that there can be absolute exceptions only so long as the mental property in question is subsumed under other non-strict laws. On this way of looking at things, a causally efficacious men- tal property stands at the intersection of a network of many non-strict laws, and if, in an exceptional case, one such law fails to bind a particular instantia- tion of the property, then other non-strict laws do so. Fodor thinks that apparently anomalous mental property instantiations are subsumed by other laws in the network; there can be no absolute exceptions to all the non-strict laws binding a property, although there can be absolute exceptions to one or two of them. So if a mental property instantiation does not obey one of its non-strict law, there must be other such laws that they do obey. But this is exactly what seems not to be true of daydreams, dreams and musings. Day- dreams, dreams and musings seem at most to be bound by one law (conced- ing, for the sake of argument, that the connections between these mental states and beliefs about them is a law). So the reply that Fodor has in mind in that paper cannot apply to daydreams, dreams and musings. The one law cannot be strict, for that would fly in the face of folk psy- chology, which tells us, at very least, that we are fallible. (We can misremember our dreams and we can be unaware of them.) But if the one law is said to be non-strict, then we lack any idea of what the property consists in when all other things are not equal - when ceteris ain't paribus. The one-law fall-back position is an insecure resting place for the nomic theory of mental properties. ยง3. Probabilistic Laws, Causal Efficacy, Psychology and Philosophy ยง3. 1 Probabilistic Psychological Laws The non-rational phenomena I have been discussing - creativity, courage, love, daydreams, dreams and musings - have not been entirely ignored by empirical psychology. Both philosophers of mind and empirical psycholo- gists have tended to focus their investigations on forms of reasoning, theo- retical and practical, as well as perception, memory, motivation and action. However, there has been some research into the non-rational phenomena I have been discussing. Let us look at some of this research in order to see whether it uncovers psychological laws, and if so what kind of laws they are. DAYDREAMS AND ANARCHY 267</page><page sequence="16">What this research uncovers are probabilistic psychological laws. I take a probabilistic law to be one where the cause raises the probability of the effect, perhaps just a little. These laws, thus characterized, do not coincide with the non-strict psychological laws that Fodor and others believe in. Fodor thinks that if a non-strict law obtains then the cause suffices for the effect, given that the ceteris paribus condition is satisfied. (See section 1.3 above, and also (Fodor 1989, p. 144 and p. 152, and Fodor 1995, p. 8.) This is a very strong conception. It implies at least that the cause makes the effect more likely than not, given the satisfaction of the ceteris paribus condition. However, a probabilistic law may be weaker than that, where the probability of the effect is raised by the cause, but it may not be raised as far making it more likely than not to occur given the cause. Let us stipulate that a non- strict law implies at least that the satisfaction of the antecedent makes the satisfaction of the consequent more likely than not, given the satisfaction of the ceteris paribus condition. There can be probabilistic laws that are weaker than this. And when we look at the empirical research that has been done into the psychological phenomena I am interested in, we find that what it unearths are weak probabilistic laws and not the stronger non-strict laws of the sort that Fodor and others believe in. Some empirical research into daydreams focuses on the circumstances of daydreaming, rather than its specific content, so such research does not bear on our concern, which is with laws involving propositional attitudes. (The empirical research on daydreams is summarized in Gilhooly 1996.) One sur- prising finding is that very fat people daydream less vividly (Singer 1975). But that is not a law quantifying over propositional attitudes together with their complete contents, although it does bear on one aspect of their content. Other research does reveal that certain themes do tend to occur in daydreams. There has been research into the contents of undirected thought, and into free associative thought that is not prompted by any external stimuli. The ques- tion is: what are the causes of undirected thoughts with specific contents (Gilhooly 1996, p. 206)? (I have called this "musing".) The research does seem to show that current concerns are likely to be reflected in undirected thoughts, and also in daydreams (Gilhooly 1996, p. 208). So perhaps there is a weak probabilistic law that says: if p is an object of current concern then the probability of thinking or daydreaming about p is raised. Creativity also seems to be bound by probabilistic laws. The idea of 'brainstorming' was originally a technique for producing novel ideas invented by Alex Osbourne (Osbourne 1953). This technique presupposes lawlike regularities covering creativity. One important idea is that we should defer judgment on our ideas, simply producing as many ideas as possible, without pausing. That procedure enhances the production of creative ideas - their frequency and quality. Moreover, group brainstorming, surprisingly, inhibited 268 NICK ZANGWILL</page><page sequence="17">creativity. The larger the group the worse it got. Other findings were that, in science, creative people tended to be more aggressive than average, whereas in art they tended to be more manic-depressive than average. These are prob- abilistic laws governing creativity. (See also Sternberg 1988, and Sternberg and Davidson 1995.) What about love? Robert Sternberg isolates some factors that he, not implausibly, thinks constitute love in many central cases (Sternberg 1986). And he isolates a number of causal factors that seem to increase the prob- ability of love. He tests these factors in predicting date choice (Sternberg 1998, chapter 9). For example, one finding (not Sternberg's) is that people are more likely to be attracted if they have recently felt fear. Hence the wis- dom of taking one's date to a horror movie or funfair. So even love seems not to be beyond the reach of empirical research. Empirical research has been done on the dynamic aspect of dreams, inves- tigating the internal structure of dream reports, looking at their overall coher- ence rather than the meaning of parts (Hobson and Stickgold 1994; Sutton, Rittenhouse, Pace-Schott, Stickgold, et al 1994; Stickgold, Rittenhouse, and Hobson, J. Allan 1994). On the basis of experimental findings about judg- ments about dream reports and about artificially edited ('spliced') dream reports, the researchers concluded that dreams tended to possess specific coherence properties. Surprisingly, dream segments tended to be internally coherent, but disparate segments had no thematic connection.12 ยง3.2 Philosophy, Causal Efficacy and Probabilistic Laws What this means is that we overstate the case if we say that there are no laws involving creativity, courage, love, daydreams, dreams and musings. Although there may be no strict laws or non-strict laws, there are probabilis- tic laws, often quite weak ones. For a probabilistic law, it is sufficient that the instantiation of one property raises the probability of the instantiation of another property. It need not raise it much, just so long as it raises it a little - perhaps from 1% to 2%. For example, there is an associative psycho- 12 Psychoanalytical accounts of dreams lead us to expect dreams to be more coherent over- all than in fact they are (Stickgold, Rittenhouse, and Hobson 1994, pp. 126-127). The researchers found no latent content of the sort postulated by Freud and his followers (Freud 1976). However, in the paper by Stickgold, Rittenhouse, and Hobson just cited, no actual evidence against the existence of such a unifying latent content, Freudian or otherwise, is provided; although they point out that whether trained psychoanalyst judges would find more latent unifying content in the manifest content of real dream reports as opposed to spliced dream reports is, given their methodology, an empirically testable matter. By 2002, however, things have apparently moved on: Hobson reports that psy- choanalysts failed to distinguish real dream sequence reports from artificially spliced dream reports (Hobson 2002, p. 155). Were there anything in their art, psychoanalysts should be better than random at detecting real dreams. But according to Hobson, they were not. Their failure was complete. DAYDREAMS AND ANARCHY 269</page><page sequence="18">logical law to the effect that if one person says "cat", another is more likely to say "dog" than "elephant". This is statistically significant and a probabilis- tic law.13 This may be a rather weak conception of law, but there seems to be no reason to deny that it is a law. (It supports counterfactuals, it is confirmed by its instances.) In this sense, it seems that it is undeniable that there are after all laws governing mental properties, such as creativity, courage, love, daydreams, dreams and musings. This seems to be a problem for the overall theme of this paper. However, the two questions we must ask are: do these probabilistic laws explain the causal relational properties of the mental properties that figure in them? And: do these probabilistic laws give the natures of the mental prop- erties that figure in them? I propose to agree that there are probabilistic psychological laws accord- ing to which certain mental property instantiations raise the probability of other mental property instantiations. There are probabilistic laws covering creativity, courage, love, daydreams, dreams and musings. But, crucially, we can make that concession without accepting the nomic theory of mental cau- sation. For even if there are such probabilistic laws for mental properties such as creativity, courage, love, daydreams, dreams and musings, it does not follow that these mental properties are causally efficacious in virtue of the probabilistic laws. Even if there are probabilistic laws binding these mental properties, according to which they raise the probability of the effect, they do not explain causal efficacy. Moreover, there is also the idea that there is something that it is to be a mental property - that mental properties have a nature (or constitutive essence); and such natures explain their causal efficacy - they are causally efficacious in virtue of their natures. But probabilistic laws involving mental properties do not give their natures. These generalizations are sometimes interesting - for instance that very fat people daydream less vividly than nor- mal people. But they are of little philosophical significance, since they neither give the natures of mental properties nor explain their efficacy. It is neither part of what it is to be a daydream, nor does it explain how daydreams are causally efficacious. Similarly, perhaps there are associative psychological laws, such as if someone says "cat" others are more likely to say "dog" than "elephant". This generalization is moderately interesting. But it is of interest to psychologists and not to philosophers. The generalization linking "cat" with "dog" and "elephant" neither explains what it is to say "cat" nor why saying "cat" is causally efficacious. Thus, even if there are probabilistic laws covering creativity, courage, love, daydreams, dreams and musings, they do not help with philosophical Saying 'cat' s not sufficient for saying 'dog' other things being equal, nor does it make saying 'dog' more likely than not. 270 NICK ZANGWILL</page><page sequence="19">concerns. Such laws neither explain the causal efficacy of such mental prop- erties nor give us their natures. This allows us to sidestep the problem of probabilistic laws. ยง3.3 Counter-nomic Causal Efficacy However, since I have claimed that causal efficacy does not depend on laws - strict or non-strict - it could reasonably be argued that I must not only allow the possibility of causal efficacy without laws but also of counter- nomic causal efficacy. In reply, I supply examples. What is needed are exam- ples of properties, the instantiation of which normally lowers the probability of the instantiation of another property, yet on a particular occasion, the first property instantiation raises the probability of the instantiation of the second. Here are two examples: revolutions and horseshoe nails. Giving hungry people food reduces the probability of revolutions; that's a probabilistic law. Bread and circuses are a jolly good idea if you are an emperor. They keep the people relatively happy and distracted, and thus not too rebellious. However, in particular circumstances, with a lot of complex factors working together, giving hungry people food might actually increase the probability of revolution. Suppose, for example, that Marie Antoinette had both said "Let them eat cake" and had also gone ahead and given some angry hungry people some rather fancy cake. That some hoity-toity aristocrat gave angry hungry people cake might make them feel insulted, and that be a causal factor leading to revolution, even though it is a probabilistic law that giving the people food lowers the probability of revolutions. The fact that this people were given this particular food in these particular circumstances was counter-nomically revolution-inducing. The second example is a modification of the famous children's rhyme, according to which for want of a horseshoe nail a kingdom was lost. The nail made the difference. At each point in the causal chain between the lack of nail in the horse's hoof and the loss of the kingdom, there is a causal and counter- factual relation between the elements in the chain. And let us admit that there is a (very) weak probabilistic law connecting the lack of nails in (army) horse's hoofs with losses of kingdoms. But suppose that a messenger was riding an ill-shod horse on his way to deliver an order to initiate a military action that would have turned out to be disastrous, and which would have resulted in the loss of the battle and thus the loss of the kingdom. Luckily, however, the horse stumbled due to the absence of the nail in its horseshoe. So for want of a nail the kingdom was saved. And this is the case despite the weak probabilistic law connecting lack of horseshoe nails with losses of kingdoms. Thus, again, we have counter-nomic causation. DAYDREAMS AND ANARCHY 271</page><page sequence="20">Both are examples of counter-nomic causally efficacious property instan- tiation. It follows that although a causally efficacious property might in fact figure in a law, its causal efficacy does not depend on doing so. Both these examples raise the metaphysically vexed issue of the causal efficacy of more or less determinate properties (see Yablo 1992). Being a cake-giving is a more determinate property than being a food-giving. Clearly, a property and a property it determines can have different causal roles. For example, an instantiation of the property [P &amp; Q] might have a causal role with respect to an instantiation of another property, even though an instantia- tion of the property P does not; and an instantiation of the property P might have a causal role with respect to another property, even though an instantia- tion of the property [P or Q] does not (see Zangwill 1996, sections 6 and 7). Causal roles are not transmitted by the determination relation. (Incidentally, this shows that psychophysical supervenience is not sufficient to explain the causal efficacy of mental properties, although it is necessary. That a physical property has a causal role does not mean that the mental property it deter- mines will thereby inherit that role. By contrast - and controversially - I do think that causal roles are transmitted by the constitution relation. There are interesting issues here.) At any rate, weak probabilistic laws, where they exist, do not threaten the thesis that causally efficacious mental properties do not depend on causal laws of any sort binding these properties, even though it might still be true that if something has a less determinate property that is causally efficacious but not in virtue of a law binding it, then it has some other more determinate prop- erty that is causally efficacious in virtue of a causal law binding it. ยง3. 4 Efficacy, C ounterf actuals and Laws The claim is not the very bold one that there are causally efficacious proper- ties that do not figure in causal laws but the slightly less bold claim that the causal efficacy of many mental properties does not depend on figuring in causal laws. However, it might be objected that that any causal rela- tion - even a weak probabilistic causal relation - generates a counterfactual, other things being equal.14 But then surely these counterfactuals in turn gen- erate laws. In the abstract, my answer is that it is true that if we fix absolutely all the circumstances in question, then the same causes would have the same effects (if we put aside worries about quantum mechanical indeterminacy). Call that a law if you like. But what is controversial is the idea that whenever one prop- erty instantiation causes another property instantiation, we must have a law In the case of a probabilistic causal relation, the counterfactual would be that, in the circumstances, if the first property had not been instantiated then the probability of the second property being instantiated would not have been raised. 272 NICK ZANGWILL</page><page sequence="21">to the effect that all instantiations of the first property raise the probability of instantiations of the second property. This is not at all obvious. For some particular instantiation of one property might raise the probability of an instantiation of another property, even though it is not generally the case that instantiations of the first raise the probability of instantiations of the second. That law might fail, even though it is perhaps a law that if we fix everything exactly as it was, an instantiation of the first property would lead to an instantiation of the second. For example, the Solidarity Gdansk ship- workers strike was a causal factor leading to the fall of the Eastern Bloc. There was a causal chain that we can trace. Are there laws? Well, perhaps it is true that a molecularly identical situation on an isolated planet would (quantum mechanical indeteterminism aside) lead to the same result. But some situations are very finely balanced. And in a similar situation, a merely very similar situation might have a very different outcome. Some situations are volatile and some are stable. A ship- yard workers strike in contemporary England would be unlikely to lead to revolution. That is predictable given the relative stability of the contemporary English political system. But in some situations, many different outcomes are real possibilities. A straw can break a camel's back. That is a real possi- bility if the camel is already carrying a great deal of weight. In other situa- tions a straw cannot break a camel's back. Similarly, in a volatile society a strike can lead to a revolution, but in a non- volatile society, it cannot. Per- haps strikes slightly raise the chance of revolutions. But a particular strike may be revolution-enhancing or stability-enhancing. An example of the latter might be the British miners strike in the mid-1980s. That strike was counter- nomically stability-enhancing. Where a strike is revolution-enhancing, its revolutionary efficacy is not due to the probabilistic law. The same goes for our earlier example of revolutions and dictatorships. A particular revolution might cause a dictatorship, such that without the revolution, the dictatorship would not have ensued. Whether or not revolutions tend to raise the probability of dictatorships is another matter. Causal relations between property instantiations, and the counterfactuals they typically involve, do not necessarily imply laws relating those properties. ยง3.5 What Does Explain Causal Efficacy Then? Someone might object at this point: if there are no laws at all binding mental properties that explain their efficacy, then what does explain it? This is a rea- sonable challenge. However, in my view, there is a candidate answer, which has some plausibility, although it has had its share of critics. I shall state the answer briefly without argument or defense. What is the causal efficacy of a property - that which we want explained? I think we should not give a reductionist explication of what it is for a prop- DAYDREAMS AND ANARCHY 273</page><page sequence="22">erty to be causally efficacious. But we may take it to be a defeasible crite- rion of the causal efficacy of a property that its instantiation makes a differ- ence. That is, other things being equal, if the property had not been instantiated at a time, then the world would have been different thereafter. And, if we are including probabilistic laws: other things being equal, if the property had not been instantiated at a time, then the world would be more likely to be different thereafter. That is, if the property had been instantiated, the probability of things being different thereafter would be higher than it would have been if the property had not been instantiated. Such a counter- factual criterion for causal efficacy is defeasible. There is a lot more to be said about the counterfactual criterion, but I shall assume it here. This counterfac- tual criterion is not an account of what it is for a property to be causally effi- cacious. It is a way of knowing about causal efficacy. Furthermore, we can use it as a test of theories that purport to explain causal efficacy. If they can capture the counterfactuals, they are probably doing well, and if they cannot, they are probably doing badly. The candidate answer I have in mind explains the causal efficacy of utterly anomalous mental properties by appealing to the conjunction of two rela- tions. The first is a determination or strong supervenience relation - that is, the existence of one-way modal ties to the effect that the instantiation of cer- tain conglomerations of physical properties at a time metaphysically suffices for the instantiation of a mental property at that same time. (In a sense, it could be said that such metaphysical necessities are laws. But nothing hangs on the word Maw'. Such 'laws' are not what are being denied when it is said that mental properties are anomalous. The physical-to-mental necessities of strong supervenience are not the sort of cross-time causal laws that Fodor and others invoke. Recall that in section 1.3 we assumed that a 'law' means a cross-time causal law.) In my view, strong supervenience is necessary if we are to explain exactly how causally efficacious yet utterly anomalous proper- ties are possible. Strong supervenience, however, is not enough. Sufficiency is insufficient. For various reasons, we must add a second relation: constitu- tion. (I mentioned one reason in section 3.3.) We need to add that particular instantiation of mental properties are constituted by particular instantiations of physical properties. Such constitution relations are also not cross-time causal relations. It is true that it is difficult to provide a strict definition of exactly what constitution consists in. Constitution is a very basic relation that probably cannot be specified in other terms. (Philosophers often say something similar about identity.) But to say that a constitution relation holds between instantiations of mental properties and instantiations of physi- cal properties is at least to say that the relation is like the relation that holds in various more uncontroversial cases of constitution, such as that between ships and planks of wood or between clouds and water molecules. 274 NICK ZANGWILL</page><page sequence="23">A supervenience plus constitution account of the causal efficacy of mental properties is controversial, and I cannot pursue it here. It needs to be shown how such a supervenient plus constitutional causation account captures the counterfactuals that are criteria for causal efficacy, and furthermore that these criteria are not defeated (Zangwill 1996). However, my task in this paper is to defend the actuality of anomalous causally efficacious properties. I have argued that some causally efficacious mental properties are in fact anomalous. My aim is not to show exactly how such anomalous mental properties can be causally efficacious. But I have argued that it is intrinsically plausible both that there are causally efficacious mental properties that are not at all bound by laws, and also that the causal efficacy of some mental properties is not due to the existence of laws involving those mental properties.15 ยง4. Complexity and Anomalism These defensive moves seem to me to dispose of the objection from prob- abilistic laws. The causal efficacy of properties does not depend on their fig- uring in non-strict or probabilistic laws, and we have a feasible explanation of the causal efficacy of anomalous properties. However, it seems to me that these moves are not completely satisfying. They do not remove all our per- plexities. For we want to know why there is anomalous causation in some cases. To show that there is, and that we need to be forced to deny it by cer- tain rather abstract principles, does not discharge this deeper explanatory task. To address this, I shall look at certain characteristics of some purely physical systems, of human history, and of the individual mind, which I think provide the basis of such an explanation. ยง4. 1 Sandpiles There has been much research into sandpiles in the last two decades (Bak 1997). Researchers have studied what happens when grains of sand are dropped onto an existing sandpile. After a time, the sandpile builds up. Every now and then one of the grains sets off an avalanche. But which grain will cause an avalanche is entirely unpredictable. The dropping of a grain can cause an avalanche even though there is no knowing whether or not that grain will cause an avalanche or, if there is an avalanche, how big the avalanche 15 I have said nothing about the Jaegwon Kim's explanatory exclusion argument, which at some point needs to be addressed in full (Kim 1993). In brief, Kim argues that once we deny identities between mental and physical property, we are then faced with the pros- pect of overdetermination, so that any effect of a mental property instantiation also has a complete physical cause. This objection threatens the supervenience plus constitution account. I suspect that the only way round it is to deny that identity and distinctness are exhaustive. Lynne Baker pursues this strategy in Baker 2000. But in my view she spoils her own promising gambit by making the strategic mistake of attempting to explicate con- stitution in modal terms. This opens her to many objections. Instead I think she should take constitution to be primitive. DAYDREAMS AND ANARCHY 275</page><page sequence="24">will be. What is interesting and surprising is that it turns out that there are definite statistical principles concerning the frequency and size of avalanches. Per Bak calls such complex systems 'self-organizing criticalities' because they obey these statistical principles, in particular, what is known as the 4power law'. The distribution of avalanche frequencies and sizes are predictable even though when they will occur is not. (Bak distinguishes such complex sys- tems from merely 'chaotic' systems at Bak 1997, pp. 29-31. Self-organizing systems are chaotic systems that also exhibit certain kinds of statistical regu- larities.) Consider the dropping of a particular grain of sand on a sandpile, which, as it happens, causes a sandpile avalanche. Question: does this imply coun- terfactuals or laws? Answer: yes and no. It was crucial for that avalanche that the particular grain landed exactly where it did, and that the pile was arranged exactly as it was. We must sepa- rate two counterfactuals. The counterfactual 'If a grain were dropped, then there would be an avalanche' is false. Most grain-droppings do not cause ava- lanches. But the counterfactual 'If a grain of sand exactly like that one were to be dropped exactly in that place on a sandpile exactly like that, then there would have been an avalanche' is true. The question is one of 'fine-grained- ness'! The counterfactual with the more fine-grained description is true, while the counterfactual with the more coarse-grained description is false. One property is more determinate than the other, and the more determinate property determines the less determinate property. Dropping a grain in exactly that way determines dropping a grain somehow. But the more determinate property of these two properties figures in counterfactuals while the less determinate property does not. Similarly, being red determines being a color; and being red might figure in certain counterfactual relations to other properties, while being a color does not. However, what may be surprising is that while there is a difference between the more and less determinate prop- erties with respect to counterfactuals, both have causal efficacy. For dropping a grain somehow was causally efficacious with respect to starting the ava- lanche. Perhaps the grain must also instantiate a more determinate property that figures in counterfactuals. But that does not detract from the fact that the less determinate property is causally efficacious with respect to the avalanche. Counter-nomic causal efficacy is easy to envisage with sandpiles. Drop- ping a grain of sand (slightly) increases the probability of an avalanche. That's a probabilistic law. However, one grain might fall so that it lodges firmly in place, which might in fact increase the stability of the overall sand- pile structure and thus reduce the probability of an avalanche. (Avalanches are by definition unstable.) Dropping that grain increased stability. This gen- erates the counterfactual that if that grain had not been dropped (in exactly that exact trajectory and on exactly such a sandpile) then sandpile stability 276 NICK ZANGWILL</page><page sequence="25">would not have been enhanced. That is, that particular grain's being dropped, exactly as it was, enhanced stability and thus lowered the probability of an avalanche, even though it is a probabilistic causal law that dropping grains causes (increases the probability of) avalanches. Dropping a grain on this occasion increased stability, even though it is a probabilistic law that drop- ping grains reduces stability. Being a grain dropping in exactly such and such trajectory onto a sandpile that is arranged exactly so-and-so, is a more deter- minate property than merely being a grain-dropping onto a sandpile. But the less determinate property is nevertheless causally efficacious. ยง4.2 Cleopatra's Nose In a famous essay on historical explanation, J. B. Bury wrote: The shape of Cleopatra's nose was rightly conditioned by the causal sequence of her heredity. This sequence had nothing to do with the causes which produced the situation of the Roman world and the political position of Anthony when he fell victim to Cleopatra's charms. The collision of the two causal sequences modified the course of history. (Bury 1916, p. 62.) The course of history seems, then, to be marked at every stage by contingency, some of greater, some of smaller import. (Bury 1916, p. 66.)16 Cleopatra's nose might not seem a momentous matter. But it changed the world! For Mark Anthony was besotted by Cleopatra, partly in virtue of her beautiful nose. And this besottedness significantly affected political relations between Rome and Egypt.17 If we describe the world at that time in history in considerable detail but omit the shape of her nose - something seemingly minor - then we omit a significant causal factor. Cleopatra's nose made a vast difference to the entire history of the world. (For a contrasting view see Ober2001.) However, Bury considerably understates the extent to which her nose effected history (his word was "modified"). For one thing, he thinks that the radical dependence of history on detail is less pronounced in more democratic nations and eras, when less hangs on the influence of 'Great men' (Bury 1916, p. 69). But voting is significantly affected by accidental details such as Richard Nixon's failing to shave properly for a presidential press conference in 1960, or by a journalist's question to John Smith, the British Labour 16 In the same view, H. A. L. Fisher wrote: "I can see [in History] only one emergency following upon another as wave follows upon wave; only one great fact with respect to which, since it is unique, there can be no generalizations; only one safe rule for the histo- rian: that he should recognize in the development of human destinies the play of the con- tingent and the unforeseen" (Fisher 1936). The example comes originally from Pascal: "If Cleopatra's nose had been shorter, the whole face of the world would be changed" (Pascal 1995, p. 10).

More important is Bury's underestimation of the extent of the change wrought by Cleopatra's nose. Let me be brash here and assert and then sup- port the following dramatic counterf actual: if Cleopatra's nose had been a slightly different shape then none of those currently alive on earth would ever have been born. You, dear reader, would not be reading these words if Cleopa- tra had had a slightly differently shaped nose! This is especially true of her nose, given her historical salience. But it is also probably true of Cleopatra's servant's noses and of the noses of any randomly chosen 1st Century Norwe- gian shepherdess. In support of this surprising counterf actual, I offer two considerations. (1) All a nose needs to do is cause a romantically active per- son to pause a moment longer while walking, and that would be sufficient to make a difference to which people exist in the next generation. For very slight differences in timing make a great difference to which (if any) of many millions of competing sperm succeeds in fertilizing an egg during a romantic encounter. Thus a slight pause while walking of one of the romantic parties would be overwhelmingly likely to make a difference to which sperm is suc- cessful. The egg might be the same but the sperm would have been different. And that means that a difference in the nuance of the shape of a nose can eas- ily cause a different person to enter the world. That's a significant local difference in only one generation. (2) That local and short term difference fans out over two millennia so that it is enough to make it certain that no one now alive would be alive, given how populations intermingle to an extent that is far greater than is popularly thought. Statisticians have estimated that the number of generations back in time by which it is overwhelmingly likely that all those alive have common ancestors is surprisingly few. One credible calculation, given the over-idealized assumption of random mating, is the astonishing recent date of around 800 years ago! And factoring in reasonable assumption about non-random mating takes the estimate only to an equally astonishing recent date of about 1500 years ago. This is much less than one would have thought. (The classic paper is apparently Chang 1999; more accessible is Rohde, Olson and Chang 2004; and see the profile of Mark Humphrey's work in Olson 2002). 18 Add these two points together and our Cleopatra's nose counterfactual falls out without much difficulty. In the light of this, we cast a critical eye on a distinction, which some historians have tried to draw, between features of situations that are historical 'relevant' and those which are not. Reflection on Cleopatra's nose should lead us to be skeptical of such a distinction. We could make the notion of histori- It is over 99% probable that, apart from the a few isolated aboriginal or South American tribes, we are all directly descended from Mohammed and King Alfred. It is even more certain that we are all directly descended from Moses, Socrates and Ceasar. 278 NICK ZANGWILL</page><page sequence="27">cal 'relevance' vacuously broad by just including anything that makes a causal difference to historical matters. So properties of Cleopatra's nose will be relevant in this sense. It is true that 'historically relevant' properties, in this sense, might not involve microphysical properties - so there is some limitation on them. Perhaps it makes no difference exactly what her nose is composed of. Had she had a nose job in order to attain its outward form, its effect on Mark Anthony would have been the same. But other physical prop- erties, such as the shape of her nose, however constituted, are historically relevant. (Contrast Carr, 1964, p. 108.) R. G. Collingwood writes "All history is the history of thought", and he recommends 'reenactment' as a way of getting 'inside' the thoughts of the people who figure in history (Collingwood 1946). I am somewhat sympa- thetic to this view of how we must understand the minds of the participants in history. But as a general way of pursuing history, this method must be a grossly restricted. For the collection of circumstances, in the context of which an action has its effect, is a whole lot more than the sum of people's thoughts. Mark Anthony may indeed have had thoughts about the beauty of Cleopatra's nose. And perhaps we need to get inside his head, to an extent, in order to understand how he felt about her nose. But tracing the effects of his desire though history involves tracing a series of accidents that transcend the contents of anyone's thoughts. Similarly, we may understand the motivations of the individual who shot the archduke. But that will not tell us why that event led to the First World War. Of course, the thoughts of others are part of the story, as its effects trickle down through time, and as they fan out from the initially restricted zone. But that certain people were thrown into the path of this particular wave is not something inside anyone's head to be reenacted. They are accidental facts, as Bury says. This convergence of independent causal pathways is in most cases not explainable by understanding any num- ber of agents' points of view.19 My view, then, is that there are no historical laws of any interest - apart, that is, from absurdly complex laws, specifying all macro-physical proper- ties, and apart from negative historical laws.20 But this raises the question: if there are no interesting laws at work, why aren't there any? One plausible explanation would be the fact we are dealing with a system with chaotic properties. It is the nature of a system with chaotic properties that even though it may be completely deterministic, due to a very great sensitivity to minute differences in initial conditions, the state of the system as a whole at a later time diverges exponentially, and thus is entirely unpredictable, within 19 One of the interesting things about Tarantino's film Pulp Fiction is the way major shifts in the plot turn on coincidences or minor contingencies. Hence I am firmly on W. D. Dray's side, as against Carl Hempel and Patrick Gardiner (Dray 1957, Hempel 1942, Gardiner 1952). DAYDREAMS AND ANARCHY 279</page><page sequence="28">certain broad parameters. Even in a deterministic macro-physical chaotic sys- tem, there are no laws, even of a non-strict sort, containing macro-level prop- erties. In this respect, history is like the weather. Revolutions are like hurri- canes. The idea is not that history and the weather are entirely chaotic, just that they are in part. (George Reisch argues that history is sometimes chaotic (Reisch 1991; see also Ferguson 1997).) Revolutions and hurricanes are both plausible examples of phenomena that involve chaotic causality. That would be why they are anomalous. And it is why, even though the system may be entirely deterministic, what happens at both micro and macro-levels, outside very broad parameters and over the longer term, cannot be predicted. What happens at the micro-level is indeed governed by laws, but there is no predict- ability at either micro- or macro-levels. Big things are indeed made of little things; but we have no knowledge of the behavior of the little things that can help us to predict the behavior of the big things (within certain parameters and beyond the short term). An interesting question that now arises is whether history is merely cha- otic or whether it also exhibits Per Bak's 'self-organizing' properties. For example, are wars and genocides like sandpile avalanches?! That is, despite their unpredictability, does their frequency and size conform to what is known as the 'power law' governing the frequency and size of these phenomena?21 ยง4.3 Brain Chaos, Mind Chaos What about the mind? A natural speculation would be that the anomalousness of the mind would be unsurprising if the brain exhibits chaotic behavior. Chaotic systems are those in which trajectories diverge exponentially given very slight variations in initial conditions. That is why prediction is impossible, within broad parameters. (Thus defined, chaos is a matter of degree.) Because of its complexity and structure, the brain is a prime candidate for a physical system that exhibits regularities but that also has the potential to behave chaotically. And chaotic brain behavior is fairly well documented. Given that the mental supervenes at least in part on, and is constituted at 1 If so, then (dare I say it?) this may be the key to world peace! There is of course a men- talistic element is the actions that lead to and are involved in war and genocide (Zangwill 2003). Ideology is a significant factor in history, and Marx was wrong to downplay that factor. But one thing Marx was right about was the way a social phenomenon can arise from intentional actions of individuals, which no one intended. Thus through our own intentional actions, we become, in Marx's phrase, "the playthings of alien powers" (Marx 1975, p. 220). We need to see whether there is a statistical pattern in the distribu- tion and size of wars and genocides, which, though not intended, is brought about by actions that are intended. Only then can we investigate the mechanisms, individualistic, social and whatever else, that generate that pattern. And only then could we work towards creating long-term historical sandpile stability, in so far as this is possible. (This footnote is somewhat whimsical - I admit; but given what is at stake, a little whimsy is surely forgivable!) 280 NICK ZANGWILL</page><page sequence="29">least in part by the brain, one might expect the chaotic behavior of the brain to spill over into our mental life. By itself, this is an armchair speculation, albeit one with some plausibility. The question needs to be addressed in the light of precise mathematical definitions of chaotic behavior, together with abstract models of the kind of neural networks that the brain instantiates. Much work is now being done in this area by neurophysiologists, psycholo- gists and mathematicians who study the formal and mathematical properties of neural networks. Philosophers should defer to the outcome of this inter- esting research if they are to say that mental lawlessness is indeed explained by brain chaos. The good news, at least from what I gather, is that the mathematical analysis of some neurophysiological structures does indeed look like it sup- ports the thesis that the brain exhibits some chaotic behavior. For example, Hendin, Horn and Usher 1990, Hansel and Sompolisnsky 1996, and van Vreeswijk Sompolinsky 1996 offer computational models of connectionist networks that deliver the result that such systems do exhibit chaotic behavior. They develop models of deterministic connectionist systems that allow and predict chaotic behavior. This work is comparatively abstract and theoretical, and not based directly on experimental studies of the human brain. But other researchers have looked at aspects of human neurophysiological activity, and they conclude that there is chaotic brain behavior. For example, Babloyantz and Destexhe 1986, Skarda and Freeman 1987, Freeman 1994, Bak 1997, chapter 10, Freeman 1999, chapter 3, Tsuda 1999, all conclude that some brain behavior is chaotic on the basis of data about the brain rather than on the basis of the abstract modeling of complex neural networks. So there is some evidence from the brain science that there is some chaotic behavior in the brain. By itself, this does not directly support or explain the thesis that mental properties are lawless, or that they owe their lawlessness to chaotic brain processes. There is an extra step here. It is possible that chaos does not spill over from micro to macro. Consider gas. In a gas, there is chaos on the atomic micro-physical level together with the standard gas laws, which hold at the macro-level. In principle, the mind might be like gas! Mental proper- ties, like gaseous properties, might be lawlike despite the chaotic nature of what they depend on. However, as I argued earlier, not all mental properties are lawlike, and this is not analogous to gaseous properties. Unfortunately, the idea that the (utter) anomalousness of some mental properties is indeed due to brain chaos is something that has not received much experimental attention. We need to know whether the brain exhibits chaotic activity during daydreams, dreams and musings. And we need to establish whether chaotic brain activity is responsible for the erratic course of daydreams, dreams and DAYDREAMS AND ANARCHY 281</page><page sequence="30">musings. However, one notable pair of researchers has concluded exactly that in the case of dreams. J. Allan Hobson and Robert Stickgold write: In dream bizarre nnes we see a mental readout of the chaotic brainstem activity of REM sleep ... (Hobson and Stickgold 1994, pp. 10-1 1.) Chaotic phasic signals arising in the potine brainstem constantly impinge upon and sometimes disrupt ongoing processing in sensory and motor centers of the limbic forebrain. These signals are thought to lead directly to the visual and motor hallucinations, emotional intensification, and distinctly bizarre cognition that characterize dream mentation. The change in cortical chemi- cal modulation from aminergic dominance (in waking) to cholinergic dominance (in REM) sleep) is a possible substrate for the recent memory (dream-amnesia), the orientational insta- bility (dream bizarreness), the failure of internal attention (loss of self-reflective awareness), as well as breathtaking leaps of association seen in the narrative plot, and all of which char- acterize dreaming. ... (Hobson and Stickgold 1994, pp. 13.) This is just to cite one paper (see also Hobson, Pace-Schott and Stickgold 2000). We need a more confirmation before we can assert that brain chaos does underlie psychological anomalousness, quite generally. However, right now I think that it is reasonable to think that since there is evidence that cha- otic brain activity does explain the erratic characteristics of some mental phe- nomena - of dreams - it may also underpin the erratic course of daydreams, musings and other anomalous mental phenomena. But we need to be patient and see what empirical research turns up before believing this with a high a degree of confidence. ยง5. Morals and Beyond $5. / Bedtime Stories: Philosophy, Psychological Laws and Empirical Sci- ence Let us now draw threads together and draw some methodological conclusions. Many philosophers of mind would like to see the mind 'naturalized', in the sense of discovering the hidden laws that govern the mind or discovering the mechanisms in virtue of which psychological laws obtain; and these phi- losophers appeal to empirical sciences to support their vision. These nomic naturalizers wish to show how the mind can be understood in the way they think that ordinary natural phenomena have been understood. The usual com- forting bedtime story they tell us is this: Once upon a dark and backward time, many natural phenomena were found mysterious and inexplicable, and the only explanations we had were hopelessly anthropomorphic: in our benighted ignorant state, we posited spirits, hobgoblins, ghosts, spirits, and demons. Then due to the gallant progress achieved by the knights of science, striv- ing against the backward forces of superstition, mysticism and 282 NICK ZANGWILL</page><page sequence="31">prejudice, the apparently inexplicable and disturbing phenomena were finally understood and explained, by subsuming them under laws that allow us to explain and predict them. But what about the mind? At present, it is true that there is no satisfying science of the human mind. Psychology awaits its Newton. But never fear. The same fate is nevertheless in store for the human mind. The glorious sword of science and reason will slay the demons and discern the laws. Science will remove the apparent mysteries of the mind by laying bare the laws that govern it. As things stand, most of the fearful dragons and demons that we once thought populated the world have been cast out by science and reason. Only the mind now remains unconquered. But the inexorable march of science will soon triumph and show how the mind too is a part of the natural order and subject to its laws. Hurrah. Science and reason triumph over super- stition! Oh what a happy ending! Now we can sleep easily! But there is surely some- thing fishy about this messianic story. The nomic naturalizers typically say they are against a priori philosophy. They say that philosophers interested in the nature of the mind should see the philosophy of mind as continuous with various associated empirical sciences, like psychology and neurophysiology, and they say we should be sensitive to the work that is being done in those sciences when we advance views of the nature and explanation of the mind. But unfortunately for the nomic naturalizers, and contrary to myths abroad in some philosophy departments, the actual empirical research is less encourag- ing to the nomic naturalizing philosophical project than we have been led to believe. Firstly, even when we look at cognitive science (which somewhat conveniently tends to be the preferred alliance of choice for philosophers with the nomic naturalizing urge), the results are not so clear. There are many mental phenomena, of the sort I have been emphasizing, that are not be bound by non-strict laws of the sort envisaged. And even if there are probabil- istic laws binding these phenomena, they are of no philosophical interest. Such probabilistic laws neither explain efficacy nor penetrate natures. Secondly, some empirical work posits chaotic processes at the brain level, which at least encourages the belief in anomalousness at the mental level, since it would be a very good candidate to explain it. Moreover, some empiri- cal work has posited chaotic processes as the explanation of some mental anomalism. This empirical work points to psychological lawlessness, not psychological laws. The philosophical nomic naturalizers want us to take empirical psychol- ogy seriously. Fair enough. But in fact this proves far less useful in their campaign than they think. In fact, much of the science is distinctly bad news for their nomic naturalizing cause. DAYDREAMS AND ANARCHY 283</page><page sequence="32">ยง5.2 In Praise of Anarchy The nomist says: no laws, no causal efficacy. However, hurricanes and revolutions are utterly anomalous yet causally efficacious. Creativity, courage and love are caused and yet lack nomic causes. And daydreams, dreams and musings are like hurricanes and revolutions in being utterly anomalous, both in respect of causes and effects. Those who emphasize non-strict psychologi- cal laws may be right that much of our mental life is governed by laws. But 'much' is not 'all1. We should not generalize irresponsibly. Much of the mind may be tame and law-abiding. But some of our mind is wild and lawless. Some is anarchic. I have not shown exactly how it is possible for anomalous mental proper- ties to be causally efficacious; all we have arrived at is the idea that some mental properties actually are like this. Work needs to be done to show how what is the case can be the case. Further exploration of the supervenient and constitutional causation model is needed. And further exploration of the cha- otic nature of the brain is needed in order to see whether it explains mental anomalousness. A philosopher might simply insist that properties are not genuine and causally efficacious unless they figure in at least non-strict laws; so if day- dreams, dreams and musings really are anomalous, it goes to show that these properties lack causal efficacy or that they are not genuine properties. So an epiphenomenalist or elimnitivist position beckons. It might be suggested that we should refine our concepts for describing these phenomena until we reach descriptions that pick out properties that do figure in non-strict laws. If such redescriptions took us very far from the original concepts, we would have reached some kind of eliminitivist position; but if we have not strayed too far, then perhaps we would have given a lawlike explanation of the phe- nomena. It is exactly the pressure to go in this direction that I am resisting. I am not prone to wielding the accusation of 'scientism' - I don't feel comfort- able doing that - but in this case, the demand for some non-strict laws bind- ing every causally efficacious mental property does seem to be a kind of 'sci- entism', and it is a prejudice that I want to remove. I want to question whether the possession of causal efficacy by a property, or being a genuine property, means figuring in non-strict laws. Given that common-sense and science agree that creativity, courage and love are causally efficacious and that there are no strict or non-strict laws concerning their causes, and given that common-sense and science agree that daydreams, dreams and musings are causally efficacious and that there are no strict or non-strict laws concerning either their causes or effects, we should eschew the scientistic principle that efficacy requires laws. Some causally efficacious mental properties may be bound by systems of laws, but some are not. Some causally efficacious men- tal properties are anomalous. Furthermore, even if mental properties are 284 NICK ZANGWILL</page><page sequence="33">bound by probabilistic laws, these are not laws that explain their causal effi- cacy. So causally efficacious mental properties do not have to be lawbound, and their efficacy is not due to their being lawbound. Those who are irre- trievably wedded to the view that nomological kinds are the only kosher kinds could take my argument to have an eliminitivist conclusion about mental properties. But the more sensible upshot is to reject the dogma that kosher kinds are nomic. ยง5.3 Strategic Ramification Lastly, a recommendation: when non-philosophers hear about the philosophy of mind, they hope that it will tell them something about the more mysteri- ous and inexplicable aspects of the human psyche. Perhaps understandably, they want to know about cases of extraordinary and dramatic life or death choices, about the possibility of extra-sensory perception, and about some of my favorite subjects - creative genius, love and dreams. They want to know about the weird and wonderful, or about phenomena, like dreams, which despite being familiar and everyday, seem mysterious. However, the academic approach in the Anglo-American tradition is different. The focus of interest is in pains, itches, the desire for ice-cream, the belief that today is Tuesday or that I am seeing a tree. We try to lead people to see that on reflection, such ordinary states are in fact more mysterious than they initially appear. Our favorite sort of question is: how could a belief or a pain arise out of the complex arrangement of mere physical matter? We (Anglo-American thinkers) pride ourselves, perhaps rightly, on our attention to the apparently prosaic. We teach people to see the mysteriousness of everyday phenomena. We want to find the extraordinary in the ordinary. This is a laudable aim. But when we are thinking about laws in the philosophy of mind, I suspect that too much of this tendency may be unhelpful. The Anglo-American tradition focuses on the prosaic, whereas the continental tradition tends to focus on the extraordinary and bizarre and inexplicable. But one needs to beware of having 'a one-sided diet of examples' - both ways. It distorts the subject matter of the philosophy of mind only to have the prosaic examples in view. We also need to think about phenomena like creativity, courage, love, daydreams, dreams and musings. These are subjects that 'continental' philosophers (along with novelists and poets) typically have had more to say about. So - bring on the intense existentialists! Philosophers of mind and their counterparts in empirical psychology have been investigating the decent law-abiding mind for some time. We should celebrate and investigate the indecent lawless mind.22 Many thanks to Helen Beebee, Marius Usher and Steven Yablo.
