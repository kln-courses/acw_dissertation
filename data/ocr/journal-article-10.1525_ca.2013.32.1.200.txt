<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> CRAIG A. WILLIAMS When A Dolphin Loves A Boy: Some Greco-Roman and Native American Love Stories This article catalogues and interprets an underexplored body of Greek and Roman narratives of animals who fall in love with humans. These narratives, unlike myths and fables, purport to tell of events which occur in the real world of their day; they are stories of desire (eros), but not of copulation; and their configurations of desire are characteristically Greco-Roman (the desiring animal is almost always male, and the human object of his desire is a woman or a young man explicitly or implicitly described as beautiful). With their anthropocentric and hierarchically configured models of desire, and their emphasis on the impossibility of fulfillment, these narratives illustrate some lasting Western perspectives on the relationship between animals and humans and on desire itself. Some Native American narratives of animal-human love, emphasizing relationship and kinship, stand in suggestive contrast. Do you really think that an eagle or a lion or a dolphin prefers any form other than his own? (an tu aquilam aut leonem aut delphinum ullam anteferre censes figuram suae?) Cicero De natura deorum 1.77 She looked over at the deer. His eyes were steady and warm with a deep black light. His heart shone right out of his eyes. He loves me, she thought. He loves me and I love him back. Right down to the ground. Who he is. No different. Of course, too bad that he’s a deer. Still, she made a bed out of young hemlock branches and curled against his short, stiff pelt. She I gave a preliminary version of this paper at the University of Rostock, and wish to express my warm thanks to fellow participants in the Rostock conference as well as to audiences at Columbia University, the University of New Mexico, and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and to Mark Griffith and the anonymous readers for Classical Antiquity.

Louise Erdrich, The Antelope Wife, Chapter 6, “The Girl and the Deer Husband” As the title of a recent volume of essays suggests, the boundary between hu- man and animal—whether its establishment and enforcement or its transgression or disruption—is a central theme in Western culture in general and its formative Greek and Roman phases in particular 1. What is more, according to a perspective sometimes known as “human exceptionalism,” we humans are a distinct category, the most advanced of living beings and culmination of creation, which is in turn the work of more or less explicitly anthropomorphic forces. On this view, human- ity understands itself in contradistinction to “nature,” conceived as something against which to struggle, something to fear and where possible dominate. Justifi- cations for this view have ranged widely. Only we—not dogs or deer—were made in God’s image; only we—not eagles or bears—have language and rationality; Zeus gave the ethical principle of justice (dike ̄) to us alone, not to fishes and beasts (Hes. Works and Days 276-80); we are destined to rule over other living beings (Plin. NH 7.3: animal ceteris imperaturum); man is the measure of all things. Fuelled by Stoic and especially Aristotelian understandings of reason and language2 along with Judeo-Christian beliefs regarding humanity’s divinely enjoined hegemony, this way of seeing things (we have reason and language, ani- mals do not, and this makes us inherently superior) continues strong in Western culture. To be sure, powerful challenges to this perspective have always existed within theWestern tradition; most recently, a range of intellectual, philosophical, artistic, and political movements, such as those related to animal rights or more generally what has come to be called post-humanism, have questioned or sought to unseat human exceptionalism.3 Yet these movements come in response to millennia of tradition—they represent precisely a struggle against an entrenched belief that “man’s ascendancy over the animal and vegetable world has, after all, been a basic precondition of human history 4.” In some other cultural traditions, that blithe assumption of ascendancy has never been there to begin with. In words that eloquently describe a perspective widespread among the indigenous peoples of North America, for example, Jenny Leading Cloud (Lakota) explains: 1. Alexandridis et al. 2008.

Thomas 1996: 16. </page> <page sequence="3"> 202 classical antiquity Volume 32/No. 1 /April 2013 We Indians think of the earth and the whole universe as a never-ending circle, and in this circle man is just another animal. The buffalo and the coyote are our brothers; the birds, our cousins. Even the tiniest ant, even a louse, even the smallest flower you can find—they are all relatives. We end our prayers with the wordsmitakuye oyasin—“all my relations”—and that includes everything that grows, crawls, runs, creeps, hops, and flies on this continent. Erdoes and Ortiz 1984: 4 Numerous American Indian traditions reflect a worldview according to which we humans are kin not only to animals but also to trees and other plants, and to all the elements of the world around us upon on which our continued existence depends 5. Within this network of relationships, animals have a special status in Native American traditions: ancient tales, contemporary poems and novels, and a living oral tradition represent them not only as our closest relatives but as powerful beings who deserve our respect, who play a key role in the creation and continuance of the world as we know it, on whose lives ours depend, in whose honor songs and dances are performed to this day. In a Mohawk elder’s recent telling of traditional stories concerning the foundation of the Iroquois confederacy, the figure of Atata ́hrho appears as “a mean man, a witchcraft man, a sorcerer,” one whose fundamental spiritual problem was that “he wanted to control everything, even the animals 6.” The contrast with models for animal-human relations prevailing in Western culture seems clear and profound, as indeed it is. And yet, not to mention the recent challenges to human exceptionalism, the Western tradition itself has never been monolithic. Already in the ancient Greek and Roman textual tradition there are voices which, although they have often been drowned out by others, insist that animals do indeed have emotions and rationality, have morality and souls, and in some ways are distinctly superior to us humans 7. In what follows, as part of a larger project bringing together Native American and Greco-Roman perspectives 5. Garroutte 2003: 132 summarizes: “In tribal philosophies people take their place, or find their identity, within a kinship network that includes not only other humans but also animals, plants, minerals, geographic features, the earth itself, celestial bodies, and spirit beings. They both owe certain things to, and expect certain things from, all of these entities. Acts of reciprocity in this extended community are not solely—perhaps not even primarily—for the benefit of humans.” There is a massive body of oral and textual material by and about Native Americans that is relevant to animal-human relations; see especially Cornplanter 1938, Erdoes and Ortiz 1984, Allen 1989, Martin 1999, Harrod 2000. My writing is also informed by experiences at various powwows, dances, and ceremonies which I have been privileged to attend, as well as many conversations andmuch reflection on my own Mohawk heritage. 6.

Elsewhere I hope to explore similarities and differences between Native American understandings of kinship and the concept of “relatedness” (ο κει της) found in the Greek textual and specifically philosophical tradition. See Dierauer 1977: 170-77 and </page> <page sequence="4"> williams: When A Dolphin Loves A Boy 203 on animal-human relations as a means of highlighting the specificities of two quite distinct cultural traditions 8, I present and interpret a body of surprising, even startling narratives from the Greek and Roman textual tradition which issue a radical challenge to human exceptionalism by telling of animals’ capacity for love in general, and love for human beings in particular: not only affection and devotion, but a quite specifically erotic love. See Table 1 for a catalogue of the more than thirty distinct narratives of this kind of love I have found in the surviving textual tradition. This is already an impressive number, but I suspect that we are dealing with the tip of an iceberg, in other words that there was an extensive body of orally transmitted narratives across the eastern Mediterranean basin, from Syria and Judaea to North Africa and Italy, only some of which have survived in the textual tradition.9 Many of these stories are discussed by August Marx in his 1889 Griechische Ma ̈rchen von dankbaren Tieren und Verwandtes; nearly all of them are cited by Sebastia ́nMartı ́nez in a 1995 article that catalogues references to “unhappy animal loves” (incestuous relations, love for animals of different species, for inanimate objects, for human beings), but his discussion mingles mythic tales and those which present themselves as narrating truly occurring incidents and offers little by way of interpretation; and a few of them are cited by Dominique Goguey in her 2003 study Les animaux dans la mentalite ́ romaine. Goguey distinguishes among four types of love (friendship; a parental kind of affection; copulation; and an intermediate type which is “independent of the sexual aspect” but “evokes amorous passion” in its intensity and exclusivity), but it remains unclear on which bases these distinctions are made; in any case, as we will see, they do not consistently correspond to any obvious features of the narratives themselves 10. compare Porph. De abstin. 2.26.5 on the Egyptians’ view of animals (ο κε α κα  συγγεν  ταupsilonperispomeneτα το ς θεο ς  ν μιζον ε ναι κα  το ς  νθρ ποις). 8. For some reflections on how knowledge (real or presumed) of American Indian cultures can influence readings of Greco-Roman traditions, see Vidal-Naquet 1986: 129-56. Zweig 1993 suggests some ways in which some Native American models for gender might inform readings of ancient Greek material. 9. I exclude from Table 1 stories of animal-human love which do not explicitly use the language of ero ̄s in Greek and the imagery of Venus, flames, or the like in Latin: for example, Plin. NH 8.56-61, 8.157 (Nicomedes’ horse), 8.143 (the dog Hyrcanus), 9.18, and Ael. Nat. anim. 2.8, 2.40 (Androcles and the lion), for which see Newmyer 2006: 76-84. I also exclude Ael. Nat. anim. 12.34 (κα  μελ ττας δ  τινας  ρωτικ!ς ε ναι π πυσμαι, ε  κα  α" πλε ους σωρφρονοupsilonperispomeneσιν), understood by both Martı ́nez 1995: 91n.33 and Zucker 2002: 79 to be an allusion to bees’ eroticism with human beings. Aelian is contrasting the chaste nature of bees as a species with the behavior of some individuals, and he makes no mention of their love for humans in particular. The sentence comes in the same paragraph as references to 24 and 25, but Aelian frequently and sometimes quite abruptly shifts topic within paragraphs, nor is it certain that he was responsible for the paragraph divisions as printed in modern editions. 10. Missing from Marx 1889 are 14-16, 23-25, 31; missing from Martı ́nez 1995 are 10 and 23; Goguey 2003: 53-61 discusses 11, 12, and 18 as illustrations of the intermediate type of love and 6 under the heading of “friendship.” Despite its seemingly inclusive title, Dierauer 1977 does not discuss any of these narratives, apart from a single ambiguous reference in a footnote (see below, </page> <page sequence="5"> 204 classical antiquity Volume 32/No. 1 /April 2013 Because many of its assumptions and much of its method continue to charac- terize scholarly writing, Marx’s study deserves a brief closer look. As the very title suggests, for Marx these stories are Greek; they are Ma ̈rchen (legends or fairytales); and—in a baldly evolutionary scheme characteristic of scholarship of his day—he sees them as a variation on an original folklore motif (“the grate- ful animal”) which itself derived from a still earlier motif (“the sacred animal” possessed by the divinity). For Marx, moreover, interpretation begins with the opposition between the true and the false and the assumption that these stories are false: he opens with a quotation on the value of exploring “the history of the untrue” (“die Geschichte des Unwahren”). My reading of this material, by contrast, does not see a specifically Greek tradition, and I suspend questions of historicity (did a dolphin really fall in love with a young man of Pozzuoli in the time of Augustus?) as well as of ethology (can animals really fall in love with human beings, or has the behavior of certain animals been re- or misinterpreted by human observers?), although I will admit that I do not share the thinly veiled skepticism or outright denial of so much scholarly discussion sinceMarx. Nor do I here travel the winding, intriguing path of Quellenforschung. Rather than appeal- ing to the opposition “true”/“false,” or trying to piece together which narratives may have had which sources and what interrelationships there may have been between them, I read these narratives in the first instance as narratives, looking for recurring patterns and considering what kinds of answers this body of material suggests about two large questions in particular: What joins or separates humans and animals? And what is this thing called love? In what follows, I first survey the narratives of animals in love with humans that I have found to date—they range from simple notices (“a goose fell in love with a boy at Aigion”) to elaborate tellings with a considerable amount of detail—organizing them by species of animal protagonist in descending order of frequency, and briefly situating them in the context of Greek and Roman views on the relevant species. I then take first steps in interpretation. THE NARRATIVES In many times and places recognized for their special closeness to human beings, dolphins appear in the Greek and Roman textual tradition as chief among the sea animals, as lions are among the land animals. Their love of music and of human beings (philanthro ̄pia) was renowned: a speaker in Plutarch’s De sollertia animalium (On the Cleverness of Animals), a text to which we will return, argues that dolphins are the only animals who love us humans for our very humanity, and the story of Arion, a musician rescued by a dolphin from certain death at pirates’ n.14). Newmyer 2006: 76-84 discusses narratives of animals’ “friendship” and “aiding behavior” with human beings, but passes over the erotic in silence, even when the texts he discusses explicitly use the language of ero ̄s. </page> <page sequence="6"> williams: When A Dolphin Loves A Boy 205 hands, was well known, recounted by Herodotus and commemorated in a statuary group at Tainaron bearing an inscription attributed to Arion himself.11 The image of a young man astride a dolphin, moreover, was circulated in a range of visual media, from coins from Taranto depicting the city’s eponymous founder riding a dolphin to a second-century ad wall painting adorning a riverside villa just outside Rome’s walls. Among these dolphin-riders, perhaps not coincidentally, one of the most common figures is Eros, for the love that dolphins showed for human beings could be described not only as philia or storge ̄ but as ero ̄s 12. Stories of dolphins in lovewith youngmen—no stories of dolphins andwomen survive, a point to which we will return—were circulating in the fourth century bc and presumably earlier, and were being told in various places around the eastern Mediterranean: Aristotle speaks of dolphins’ desire for young men (πρ$ς πα δας %ρωτες κα   πιθυμ αι) as something well known in Taranto in southern Italy, Caria in Asia Minor, “and elsewhere 13.” A few centuries later, Pliny reports that there have been “countless examples” of dolphins becoming intimate with boys: The dolphin is fond (amicum) not only of humanity but also of the art of music; he can be soothed by singing in harmony and above all by the sound of a water organ. He does not fear the human as if he were another species (ut alienum) but in fact comes up to ships, jumps up and plays with them, vies with them and swims before them even at full sail. During the reign of the deified Augustus, a dolphin was brought to the Lucrine Lake (5). The son of a poor man from the district of Baiae went to school in Pozzuoli and would linger on the way at noontime, repeatedly calling “Here, Bottlenose!” and enticing the dolphin with pieces of the bread that he brought every day for his trip. The dolphin conceived a marvelous love for this young man (miro amore dilexit). (I would hesitate to report this were not the matter recorded in the writings of Maecenas, Fabianus, Alfius Flavus and many others.) At whatever time of day the boy called out for him, and no matter how deeply he was lurking in the waters, the dolphin would leap out of 11. Plut.

See Csapo 2003 for a rich discussion of Arion, his hymn to Poseidon, and a series of vase paintings depicting dolphins with human legs as part of a larger complex of meaning whereby “to Greek eyes, dolphins are dancers” (81). 12.

Dierauer 1977: 162-70 follows many nineteenth-century editors in identifying this book of the Historia Animalium as “Book 9,” rejecting its Aristotelian authorship, and positing Theophrastus’s now-lost Περ  ζ 3ων φρον4σεως κα  5θους as its principal source. More recent scholarship has restored the identification as Book 8 and considers the doubts of Aristotelian authorship unfounded; see the 2002 Cambridge edition by D.M.

He would then carry the boy across the open sea to his school in Puteoli and bring him back in the same way. This went on for several years until the boy became ill and died. The dolphin kept returning to their usual meeting-place—saddened, like one inmourning— and eventually died; no one doubted that it was out of longing (desiderio) for the boy. In living memory, another dolphin at Hippo Diarrhytos on the North African shore (8) likewise ate from people’s hands, offered himself to their touch, played with them as they swam, and carried them on his back. When Flavianus, proconsul of Africa, smeared the dolphin with ointment its unfamiliar scent evidently sedated him; he floated about lifelessly, keeping away from human contact for several months as if he had been wronged. Eventually he returned and once again became the object of amazement; but the expense incurred by the people of Hippo, obliged to host important people who came to see the dolphin, in the end compelled them to kill the animal. A similar story is told about a boy in the city of Iasos in Asia Minor, some time ago (2): a dolphin showed his love (amore) for the boy over a long period of time, until one day he eagerly followed the boy on to the shore, was stranded on the beach and thus died. Alexander the Great appointed the boy to be high priest of Neptune at Babylon, taking the dolphin’s love to be a sign of propitious divinity. Hegesidemus writes that in the same city of Iasos another boy, Hermias by name (6), likewise rode on a dolphin’s back at sea until one day he perished in the waves during a sudden storm; carrying the boy back to dry land, the dolphin took the blame for his death, refused to return to the open sea and so perished on the shore. Theophrastus records that the same thing also happened at Naupactus (3). There are countless examples of this (nec modus exemplorum); the people of Amphilochia (7) and Taranto (1) tell the same tales of boys and dolphins. All of this leads one to believe the story of Arion. Plin. NH 9.24–28 There is much here that we will be seeing elsewhere: the delicate evocation of physical intimacy, the tragic turn at the end, and above all Pliny’s point, underscored by his citations of authoritative sources and driven home by the final remark regarding the story of Arion, that, as surprising as they are, these incidents really occurred. Real-life love stories, then: but is this love ero ̄s? The Latin vocabulary of amor and desiderium is notoriously flexible: “love” or “affection,” “longing for” or “missing.” It is striking that Pliny does not use the less ambiguous language of Venus or draw attention to the boys’ physical beauty, and that his narrative of what happened at Hippo Diarrhytos does not even mention a specific dolphin-boy pair. In fact, from the opening invocation of amicitia to the closing link with the story of Arion, Pliny frames his dolphin stories in such a way as </page> <page sequence="8"> williams: When A Dolphin Loves A Boy 207 to suggest not so much ero ̄s as philia, more particularly philanthro ̄pia. And so, no doubt partly under Pliny’s influence, scholarly references to dolphin stories have tended to downplay or entirely block out the erotic, speaking instead of “friendship” or “attachment 14.” Precisely in their swerve away from the erotic, however, Pliny’s narratives turn out to be unique. Several centuries earlier, as we have seen, Aristotle had observed that dolphins are known for their erotic desire for young men (%ρωτες κα   πιθυμ αι), and in the third century bc Douris of Samos had told one of the stories from Iasos to which Pliny alludes (2) in an erotic key: the young man, fresh from wrestling in the palaestra, swims in the nude and arouses the dolphin’s interest 15. Pliny’s own nephew gives a subtly but significantly different version of the incident at HippoDiarrhytos (8), describing a specific dolphin-boy pair who are joined by mutual amor and admired by others, both dolphins and boys (Plin. Epist. 9.33). And, narrating the same incident in his Halieutika, the second-century ad poet Oppian vividly evokes the dolphin’s “hot desire” (θερμ$ν %ρωτα).16 In his own report of dolphin incidents, Aulus Gellius clearly signals the erotic, introducing them in Latin with the language of Venus and burning before including a remarkable quotation from Apion’s Greek narrative: That dolphins are passionate lovers (venerios et amasios) is clear not only from the chronicles of the past but also from certain events in recent mem- 14. Cf. Dierauer 1977: 271 (“ganz besonderer Abha ̈nglichkeit und Freundschaft gegenu ̈ber Menschen”; a footnote refers to Theophrastus’s “Erza ̈hlungen vom Eros der Delphine,“ but the formulation might leave the impression that these are stories of dolphins’ eroticism in general, not specifically in their relationship with human beings); Beagon 1992: 128-29 (“anecdotes about the intelligent dolphin’s remarkable associations with human beings”); Giebel 2003: 172 (“Freund- schaften von Delfinen und Menschen”); Newmyer 2006: 124n.124 (“friendships between boys and dolphins”). Goguey 2003: 62 compares the story of the dolphin and the boy at Pozzuoli (5) to Odysseus and his dog Argos and to Pliny’s narrations of horses’ devotion to their masters. Higham 1960 and Jacques 1965, arguing that at least some of these stories of dolphin-riders may be based on real occurrences, are silent on the point of ero ̄s. Mastrorosa 2000 focuses on 8, describing it as a narrative “sottesa fra i confini del mirabile . . . e quelli della zoofilia” (1859) and concluding that this narrative is not merely “folklore,” but reflects knowledge of real animal behavior (1880). Citroni Marchetti 2011: 193-202 reads Pliny’s dolphin narratives (1-3, 5-8), which she classifies as “legend,” in connection with pederastic models in general and Plato’s Symposium in particular, in other words as narratives of ero ̄s. 15.

A student of Theophrastus and eventually tyrant of Samos, Douris authored a number of texts which survive only in scattered quotations, most prominently a narrative history of the Greek world from the battle of Leuctra in 371 bc to the death of Lysimachus in 281 bc. 16. Plin. Epist. 9.33.6-7: agnosci se, amari putat, amat ipse; neuter timet, neuter timetur; huius fiducia, mansuetudo illius augetur. nec non alii pueri dextra laevaque simul eunt hortantes monentesque. ibat una — id quoque mirum — delphinus alius, tantum spectator et comes. nihil enim simile aut faciebat aut patiebatur, sed alterum illum ducebat reducebat, ut puerum ceteri pueri; Opp. Hal. 5.453-55: κα  ποupsilonacute τις Λ βυος κοupsilonacuteρου π θον ο δεν  κοupsilonacuteων, / τοupsilonperispomene ποτε ποιμα νοντος  ρ'σσατο θερμ$ν %ρωτα / δελφ ς. For further discussion of these narratives of the dolphin on the North African coast, see Stevens 2009, Mastrorosa 2000, both of whom rather downplay the language of desire (cf. Mastrorosa 2000: 1870: Oppian “ricorda specificamente la condotta filantropica del mammifero”). </page> <page sequence="9"> 208 classical antiquity Volume 32/No. 1 /April 2013 ory. Under Caesar Augustus in the sea near Pozzuoli (5), as Apion wrote, and some centuries earlier near Naupactus, as Theophrastus recorded (3), ardent lovers (amatores flagrantissimi) have been discovered among dol- phins. Falling in love not with their own kind (neque amaverunt quod sunt ipsi genus) but with good-looking young men of whom they happened to catch a glimpse on boats or in shallow waters at the shore, these dolphins burned with love in surprising, human ways (miris et humanis modis arserunt). I have written down the words of the scholar Apion from Book 5 of his Aegyptiaca, where he describes the habits, the games, the playful rides of the dolphin lover (5) and the boy who did not resist (delphini amantis et pueri non abhorrentis). Apion says that he himself and many others saw it all. “I myself,” he writes, “saw near Pozzuoli a dolphin aflutter with passion (π θοις  πτοημ νον) for a boy named Hyakinthos. His soul in flight, the dolphin would flatter the boy with his voice and would retract his sharp fins ( ντ$ς τ'ς τε  κ'νθας upsilonasperποστ λλων), being careful not to scratch the flesh he longed for (τοupsilonperispomene ποθουμ νου χρωτ ς). The boy rode him like a horse ("ππηδ ν τε περιβεβηκ τα) and the dolphin carried him as far as 200 stades. Rome and indeed all of Italy streamed to the shore to have a look at this fish who had been tamed by Aphrodite (τ ς Α6 φροδ της .νιοχοupsilonacuteμενον  χθupsilonacuteν).” Apion then adds something no less amazing. This boy, a dolphin’s beloved (δελφινερ μενος), was subsequently afflicted by a disease and perished. His lover (ille amans) swam up repeatedly to the usual spot on the shore, but the boy, who had usually waited for the dolphin’s appearance in the shallow waters, was nowhere to be found. The dolphin wasted away and died out of longing for the boy (desiderio); his body was discovered on the shore and buried in his boy’s tomb by people who knew what had happened. Gell. NA 6.8 In the midst of Gellius’s Latin paraphrase of Apion’s report, the Greek del- phinero ̄menos leaps to the eye. Whether the term was used by witnesses at Pozzuoli or was a coinage of Apion or just possibly of Gellius, this exuberant compound says it all, casting dolphin and boy in the two complementary roles of the pederastic tradition: the dolphin as older, desiring eraste ̄s, the young man as younger, desirable ero ̄menos. In his Περ   δι τητος ζ 3ων (generally known by the Latin title De natura animalium), the second-century ad freedman Claudius Aelianus aims to demon- strate by means of an impressively massive compilation of material he has found in earlier writers that, while animals do not possess the rational principle of lo- gos as humans do, they do display an entire roster of qualities that have often served as pillars in the edifice of human exceptionalism: intelligence, memory, loyalty, justice, religion, technical knowledge (medicine, augury, mathematics)— </page> <page sequence="10"> williams: When A Dolphin Loves A Boy 209 and love, whether philia, storge ̄, or ero ̄s 17. Among the many things Aelian reports or retells for his readership is one of the dolphin stories from Iasos, which he describes—and on this point there is no reason to doubt him—as something that has long been renowned: I do not think it right that the long-celebrated love (%ρωτα . . . π'λαι  Aδ μενον) of a dolphin for a beautiful young man in Iasos (6) should go unmentioned inmywork; so the story of this love shall be told. The people of Iasos have their gymnasium on the seashore, and following the ancient custom the young men go down to bathe after they have run and wrestled. Once, as they were swimming around, a dolphin fell intensely in love ( ρBA %ρωτα δριμupsilonacuteτατον) with a particularly beautiful young man. At first the boy was frightened and startled by the dolphin as he approached him, but eventually he became accustomed to him and even developed a friendly goodwill towards the dolphin (φιλ αν τιν! κα  εupsilonlenisacuteνοιαν). At any rate, they began to play around with each other, sometimes swimming side by side in mutual competition; sometimes, too, the boy would mount the dolphin like a rider on a horse ( ναβα νων 8ς π*λον "ππ της), proudly sitting on the lover who swam beneath him (upsilonasperπονηχομ νου τοupsilonperispomene  ραστοupsilonperispomene). Both to the people of Iasos and to visitors this all seemed quite amazing. Carrying his boyfriend (τ! παιδικ'), the dolphin would go far out to sea, just as much as his rider wanted. . . . In addition to his natural beauty, the boy was widely admired, since not only human beings but animals found him so beautiful. Before long, however, this boy who requited the dolphin’s love (οupsilonasperperispomeneτος E  ντερ*ν) became the victim of divine envy. One day, having exhausted himself with a great deal of exercise, he flung himself belly first on to his mount. The animal’s dorsal fin happened to be erect and pierced the beautiful boy’s navel (κα  πως %τυχεν . τοupsilonperispomene ζ 3ου &amp;κανθα . κατ! τοupsilonperispomene ν του Fρθ/ οupsilonlenisperispomeneσα κα  τ*3 8ρα ω3 τ$ν Fμφαλ$ν κεντε ); some veins were severed, a great deal of blood flowed, and the boy died on the spot. Ael. Nat. anim. 6.15 Once again we see the dolphin cast in the role of pursuer and lover (eraste ̄s), the young man in that of paidika, beautiful and modest recipient of his lover’s attentions who responds to the latter’s keen desire (ero ̄s) at first with modest af- 17. Cf. Ael.

Aelian’s massive compilation has no immediately obvious organizational principle, and in the epilogue he reveals that this was a deliberate choice in the interests of variety (poikilia). To this extent, the individual narratives invite being quoted and read without being placed in their immediate textual context; this is not to deny that one can also read De natura animalium with attention to larger structural patterns.

Aelian brings this tragic tale to its conclusion. When he realized what had happened, the dolphin could not bear to outlive his beloved; bringing the boy’s body with him, he deliberately beached himself and died. Aelian then tartly observes that the dolphin behavedmore decently than Oedipus’s father Laius, who for Aelian as for some others is the first Greek to have entered into a pederastic relationship: after having had his way with Pelops’s son Chrysippus, Laius left him, whereupon the young man killed himself.19 Returning to Iasos, Aelian wraps up the story: Responding to the pair’s powerful love (τ/ν φιλ αν  κε νων τ/ν  σχυ- ρ'ν), the people of Iasos built a single tomb for the handsome young man and the passionate dolphin (δελφ νος  ρωτικοupsilonperispomene) and set up a stele depicting a beautiful boy riding a dolphin. They also struck a coin of silver and one of bronze illustrating the pair’s fate (τ$  μφο ν π'θος), respectfully memorializing the deed of so great a god (sc., Eros). I am also told that in Alexandria in the days of Ptolemy II a dolphin similarly fell in love ( ρασθ ναι) (4), and at Pozzuoli in Italy as well (5). If Herodotus had known of these incidents, I do not suppose he would have been surprised by them any less than he was by what happened to Arion of Methymna. Ael. Nat. anim. 6.15 The allusion to the story of Arion has the effect of evoking the concept of dolphins’ philanthro ̄pia, but at the same time Aelian situates his narrative firmly within pederastic discourse by evoking young men’s beautiful bodies working up a sweat in the gymnasium, describing public recognition in the form of a joint tomb and memorial coins, citing the myth of Laius and Chrysippus, and precisely by blending the language of ero ̄s and philia. The dialogue by Plutarch now generally known by the Latin title De sollertia animalium begins with the axiom that all animals have intelligence (dianoia and logismos, 960A); as its Greek title makes clear, the question is whether land animals or sea animals are superior in this regard 20. Defending the cause 18. The 2009 Teubner edition prints the manuscript reading  ντερ*ν, while the 1959 Loeb edition accepts Hercher’s conjecture  ντ ρως. On either reading, Aelian describes a response on the part of the boy to the dolphin’s ero ̄s. For Eros and Anteros, see Pl. Phdr. 255b-e (some eromenoi feels antero ̄s for their erastai but call it philia), Paus. 1.30.1 (an altar to Anteros in Athens), and Ael. Nat. anim. 14.28 (a myth of origin), with Scanlon 2002: 255-64. 19. It is characteristic of Aelian to draw a comparison between animal and human behavior in such a way as to be distinctly unfavorable to the latter. For Laius and Chrysippus, see also Ael. Var. hist. 13.5 as well as the surviving fragments of Euripides’ Chrysippus. 20. Π τερα τ*ν ζ 3ων φρονιμ τερα, τ! χ ρσαια J τ! %νυρδα.

The wording is significant. Even as he himself assigns the dolphin’s love for the boy to the categories of eunoia and philia, Plutarch’s character observes that the animal was commonly believed to have experienced erotic desire. The coins circulating at Iasos mentioned by Plutarch (984F) and surviving in third-century bc examples, the head of Apollo on the obverse and a young man and a dolphin on the reverse, would thus seem to be alluding to a remarkable story of ero ̄s. Another eyewitness report is associated with a dolphin incident at a town called Poroselene, probably though not definitely located on the Aegean island today known as Hekatonisa or Moskhonisi in Greek, Cunda or Alibey in Turkish: A man of Byzantium, Leonidas by name, says that as he was sailing through Aeolia he himself saw in the town called Poroselene (9) a tame dolphin who lived in the harbor and who treated the town’s inhabitants as if they were his personal friends ( διοK νοις). Leonidas adds that an old woman and an old man who lived with her raised this dolphin as their foster-child, luring him with bait and other things. The old couple’s son grew up with him—they raised their own son together with the dolphin— and somehow, from the experience of growing up together, human and animal fell in love with each other without knowing it (κα  πως  κ τ ς συντροφ ας  λαθ την ε ς %ρωτα  λλ4λων upsilonasperπελθ ντε). And so the “grand and requited love” (upsilonasperπ ρσεμνος  ντ ρως) of that well-known phrase was honored in the case of those I have mentioned. Ael. Nat. anim. 2.6 The language of ero ̄s is clear enough. Whether Aelian found this detail in Leonidas’s eyewitness report or added it himself from some other source, he tells of dolphin and boy growing up together and gradually falling in love without knowing it, rather like the young couple Daphnis and Chloe of Longus’s novel 21. In the last of our dolphin-boy pairs, the subject of local tradition at Teios or Ios (10), at least for the scribes and readers of two manuscripts of Aelian’s De natura animalium the animal’s desire was not only requited but consummated: most 21. Longus 2.8.3: σχεδ$ν τοupsilonperispomeneτ   στιν E %ρως κα   ρ*μεν  λλ4λων οupsilonlenisκ ε δ τες. Oppian’s poetic narrative of the Poroselene dolphin uses the language of both ero ̄s and philia (Opp. Hal. 5.508: το η μ+ν ζ 3ω3 φιλ η π λεν; 459-60: οupsilonlenisacuteτι παλαι ν,  φ( .μετ ρη: δ+ γεν θλη: / δελφ ς Lς ποτε παιδ$ς  ρ'σσατο νησα οιο). Pausanias writes that he, too, saw a dolphin at Poroselene carrying a boy on his back, adding that the dolphin had helped heal the boy after he was beaten up by some fisherman; one wonders what further stories lurk behind this remark (Paus. 3.25.7: τ$ν δ+  ν Ποροσελ νη: δελφ να τ*3 παιδ  σ*στρα  ποδιδ ντα Mτι συγκοπ ντα upsilonasperπ$ Nλι ων αupsilonlenisτ$ν  'σατο, τοupsilonperispomeneτον τ$ν δελφ να ε δον).

For elephants have intelligence, memory, morality, justice, religion, and—last but not least—love: Elephants know nothing of adultery, nor is there that fighting over females which is so destructive to other animals. But this is not because they lack the power of love (amoris vis). After all, it is said that an elephant once fell in love (amasse) with a woman who sold garlands in Egypt (11); and—lest anyone think the elephant had chosen a common sort—this woman was also greatly admired by the famous scholar Aristophanes. Another elephant is said to have fallen in love with a young man from Syracuse namedMenander who served in Ptolemy’s army (12); whenever he was prevented from seeing his beloved, the elephant showed howmuch he missed him (desiderium eius) by refusing to eat. Juba, too, records that a woman who sold perfume was loved (dilectam) by an elephant (13). All of these elephants showed the signs of love (amoris argumenta): delight in seeing the beloved, clumsy caresses, dropping coins given them by the public into their beloved’s lap. Nor is it surprising that these animals should experience love, since they also have memory. Plin. NH 8.13-14 23 These stories illustrate “the power of love,” but what kind of love? The “signs of love” (amoris argumenta) Pliny cites—the awkwardness and lack of appetite, the suffering upon separation and delight upon reunion, the shy gifts and caresses—suggest the realm of Venus more directly than do his dolphin narratives and, more tellingly still, these elephants’ behavior illustrates the same kind of amor that leads to ferocious combat between actual or potential mates 22.

Pliny’s concise reference to “Ptolemy’s army” may suggest that he is alluding to a well- known incident; perhaps Menander of Syracuse was one of the many mercenaries in the army of Ptolemy IV Philopator, who deployed 73 war elephants against Antiochus’s 102 in the battle of Raphia in 217 bc (see Polyb. 5.79, Scullard 1974: 137-45). Juba II, king of Numidia in the mid-first century bc, presumably recorded the story of the elephant in love with the perfume-seller in his Libyka, one third of whose surviving fragments are concerned with elephants (see Roller 2003: 204-209). Discussions of elephants in the Greek and Roman world include Keller 1909: 372-82, Toynbee 1973: 32-54, Scullard 1974. Aelian records a belief that elephants are generally restrained in matters of passion (Nat. anim. 10.1: σπαν ως  λ φας  ρBA, φασ ν. %στι γ!ρ σ φρων, 8ς &amp;νω μοι λ λεκται).

Sat. 2.4.3). </page> <page sequence="14"> williams: When A Dolphin Loves A Boy 213 and “adultery” among other, less faithful species 24. In short, Pliny’s amor here suggests ero ̄s more than philia. Telling the first of these stories (11) in Greek, the defendant of land animals in Plutarch’s contemporary De sollertia animalium emphatically uses the language of ero ̄s; and, whereas Pliny makes a discreetly vague allusion to awkward gestures of affection (blanditiae inconditae), Plutarch’s speaker draws our attention to one elephant’s trunk in particular as it slips under the young woman’s clothes “like a hand” and feels its way to her breasts 25. Two further stories of elephants in love found in Aelian blend the language of ero ̄s and philia and tell of a response on the part of the beloved human being. In the first, we read that an elephant of Antioch (14) used his polyvalent proboscis in a rather less forward manner than Aristophanes’ rival in Alexandria, cleaning a woman’s face with it, and that his gentle attentions did not go unrequited. Every day the woman put out a new garland of seasonal flowers as a “love-charm” (philtron) and every day, of course, the infatuated elephant accepted it 26. In the other narrative we read that an elephant trainer in India (15) was in love with a white elephant whom he had raised since his youth and that he was loved by him in return (κα  5ρα τοupsilonperispomene κτ4ματος κα   ντηρBτο, Ael. Nat. anim. 3.46). As the drama unfolds—the local king tries to seize the elephant; when the trainer is wounded in the ensuing struggle, the elephant kills some of his attackers and rescues the trainer—the narrative compares the man to “a jealous boyfriend” (8ς  ρ μενος ζηλοτυπ*ν) and casts the elephant in the honorable role of “faithful friend” (φ λος πιστ ς) whose loyalty should be a lesson to less faithful humans. When we read of snakes as lovers, their phallic associations and their ability to entwine, caress, and probe—much like an elephant’s trunk—are worth keeping in mind, along with the mythic narrative of Tiresias, who comes upon a pair of snakes copulating and changes sex as a result 27. The peculiar, even uncanny quality of snakes’ sexual behavior surfaces in a remark of Pliny’s as well: mating snakes look like a single two-headed being (NH 10.169). It is also suggestive that Pliny places snakes second in his zoology, immediately after elephants, and that he observes that the one tender emotion shown by this otherwise “pestilential being” (huic tam pestifero animali) is conjugal: they live in pairs, and if a snake’s partner 24. For the language of marriage and adultery among animals, cf. Ov. Ars 2.484 (dogs), Plin. NH 10.104 (pigeons), Ael. Nat. anim. 10.1 (elephants); for erotic rivalry, see Plin. NH 8.42: magna his [sc., lionesses] libido coitus et ob hoc maribus ira. 25. Plut. Soll. anim. 972D: τ/ν προβοσκ δα τ*ν χιτων ων  ντ$ς Lσπερ χε ρα παραβαλTν  τρ μα τ ς περ  τ$ στ θος Lρας %ψαυεν. 26. When the woman eventually died, the elephant went wild with grief, “like a lover who has lost his beloved” (Ael. Nat. anim. 7.39: Lσπερ οupsilonlenisperispomeneν  ραστ/ς  ρωμ νης  τυχ*ν  Kηγρι θη). 27. For phallic snake imagery, see, e.g., the scholiast on Aristoph.

It is Pliny who preserves a snake story which had been told by Democritus as early as the fifth century bc. An Arcadian named Thoas (16)—not to be confused with two different mythic figures by that name—raised a snake in his youth and came to love him; but the young man’s father feared the snake and got rid of him. Some time later, when Thoas was attacked by thieves in the countryside, the snake recognized his voice and came to his aid. A story of love and devotion, then: but what kind of love? Democritus’s own narrative is lost, but Pliny’s Latin paraphrase uses the elastic and vague verb diligere (dilectum admodum) and indeed, as in the case of his dolphin narratives, Pliny does not seem to be telling a tale of erotic love, citing the incident as an illustration of animal gratitude and devotion, and placing it between the story of a grateful panther and an allusion to Romulus, Remus, and the she-wolf (NH 8.60- 61). Aelian’s telling of this story is more complex on the delicate question of love. It begins as a story of animal and human growing up together and of reciprocal philia (Ael. Nat. anim. 6.63:  λλ4λους μ+ν  φ λουν); but then, when he comes to the encounter with the thieves, Aelian calls the young Arcadian “the lover and beloved of the animal I have mentioned” (E τοupsilonperispomene ζ 3ου τοupsilonperispomene προειρημ νου  ραστ/ς κα   ρ μενος). Perhaps not coincidentally in a story of a snake, Aelian adds a mingling of roles to the entwining of the language of philia and ero ̄s characteristic of pederastic discourse. Another snake narrative was found in the poetry of a certain Hegemon, usually dated to the fourth or third centuries bc. Hegemon’s poetry is lost, but in Aelian’s prose paraphrase we read that a snake in love with a blond Thessalian shepherd named Aleuas (17) “slithered up to him, kissed his hair, cleaned his boyfriend’s (τοupsilonperispomene  ρωμ νου) face by licking it all over with his tongue, and brought him a large number of gifts from his hunting expeditions” (Ael. Nat. anim. 8.10). Yet another snake story (18) appears in Plutarch’s De sollertia animalium as the second of four illustrations of land animals’ capacity for ero ̄s: “the snake who fell in love with the Aetolian woman” (972E: E δ+ δρ'κων E τ ς Α τωλ δος  ρασθε ς). This snake came to his beloved at night, wrapping himself around her body while carefully avoiding any “unintentional harm,” spending the night with her but always leaving “decently” as dawn approached (οupsilonlenisδ+ν οupsilonlenisacuteθ( XκTν οupsilonlenisacuteτ, &amp;κων %βλαψεν,  λλ! κοσμ ως  ε  περ  τ$ν Vρθρον  πηλλ'ττετο): a scrupulously respectful lover. Nonetheless, the woman’s family separated the pair; a few nights later, though, the snake found his way back to his beloved and greeted her with something like light bondage, tying her hands to her body and lashing at her calves in affectionate reproach. The same polyvalent gesture appears in another snake story that was the subject of oral tradition in Judaea and is preserved by Aelian (19): in the days of King Herod, a huge snake fell in love with a beautiful young woman and slept with her “in a quite erotic way” (συνεκ'θευδε σφ δρα  ρωτικ*ς, Nat. anim. 6.17), a suggestive phrase indeed when one thinks of the animal’s phallic shape and nimble tongue. </page> <page sequence="16"> williams: When A Dolphin Loves A Boy 215 That birds should be the next most frequently occurring protagonists in surviving Greek and Roman narratives of animals in love with humans is not entirely surprising if we think of Aphrodite’s doves and Catullus’s sparrow, the phallus-bird of Attic vase painting, or the association of birds with sexual acts and organs in Greek and Latin as in other languages. Birds’ own erotic inclinations were the subject of various beliefs: some species (e.g., pigeons) were thought to be strictly monogamous, while others (e.g., partridges) had quite the opposite reputation.28 Nor were their erotic interests thought to be limited to their own kind: That geese can be alert and attentive is shown by their defense of the Capitoline when the dogs, through their silence, almost led to our downfall; and so when the censors take office, among the first things they do is to arrange a contract for feeding the geese. There is, moreover, the well-known story of a goose in love with an unusually beautiful boy in Aegion, Amphilochus of Olenos by name (20) as well as of one in love with Glauke, king Ptolemy’s kitharode (21), who is said to have been loved at the same time by a ram as well (26) (fama amoris Aegii dilecta forma pueri nomine Olenii &lt;Amphilochi&gt; et Glauces Ptolemaeo regi cithara canentis, quam eodem tempore et aries amasse proditur). That geese can perceive widsom is also clear: for example, it is said that a goose was always at the philosopher Lacydes’ side (22), never leaving him—whether in public or in the baths, whether by night or by day. Plin. NH 10.51 We will return shortly to the memorable figure of Glauke and her animal admirers. Here I would point out that Pliny’s language of fama suggests that the story of Glauke and the goose (21), like that of Amphilochus (20), was well known in at least some circles of Greek and Roman society in his day, and a small clay vase dating from around 100 bc, perhaps made in Alexandria, has been plausibly interpreted as depicting Glauke in the company of her goose lover 29. For his part, Amphilochus’s goose admirer was described by two of Aristotle’s students— Clearchus in the first book of his Erotika and Theophrastus in his Erotikos—and, as we will see shortly, Plutarch cites “the pederastic goose in Aegion” as an example of a story so well known as not to need retelling. And although Pliny cites the goose who never left the side of Lacydes of Cyrene as an illustration 28. For birds in the Greek and Latin sexual vocabulary see Henderson 1991: 128-29 (male genitalia), 147 (female genitalia), and Adams 1982: 31-33 (phallic imagery); cf.

Then as now, the peacock was renowned for its spectacular tailfeathers. Presumably reporting common opinions, Aelian observes that the bird is aware of its beauty and, like a handsome boy or lovely woman, skillfully exploits it; for his part, Pliny contrasts the peacock’s pride with the modesty of geese. Like their human counterparts, gorgeous peacocks were hardly immune to falling in love: as well as telling of Amphilochus and the goose, Clearchus’s Erotika included the narrative of a peacock in Leucadia who fell in love with a young woman, joining her in death (23).31 The corvine jackdaw appears in ancient texts characterized by a harsh voice and dark ugliness, but also as a child’s pet. Modern ethologists describe the jackdaw as a highly social animal and one which, like a number of other bird species but unlike most mammal species, regularly creates long-term monogamous relationships—and not only with other jackdaws. In his classic work of popularizing ethology, King Solomon’s Ring, Konrad Lorenz writes of his own relationship with a colony of jackdaws, telling of a female named Jock who fell in love with Lorenz’s housemaid and of a male who fell in love with Lorenz himself; apparently unknown to Lorenz is Aelian’s passing reference to a jackdaw who fell in love with a beautiful young man of Sparta (24).32 And in another bird story surviving from antiquity, told by Nicander of Chalcedon in his Peripeteiai (probably datable to the second century bc) and by an unidentified Philo, a cock named Centaur fell in love with Secundus, cupbearer of one of the Bithynian kings named Nicomedes (25).33 30.

Plin. NH 8.142: fidelissimumque ante omnia homini), it comes as no surprise to find that Aelian adds a dog to the list of Glauke’s lovers (27), and that he also reports the existence of a story of a dog in Cilicia who fell in love with a young man named Xenophon (28).35 Another one of Glauke’s lovers is a ram (26), an animal with specifically phallic associations in the Greek and Roman textual tradition.36 Having told the stories of the elephant in Alexandria (11) and the snake in Aetolia (18), Plutarch’s Aristotimos caps off his review of land animals’ capacity for ero ̄s with these words: As for the pederastic goose in Aigion (20) and the ram who desired the musician Glauke (26)– well, these are famous stories (περιβ ητοι γ'ρ ε σι) and I suspect that you have had your fill of them; so I omit them. Plut. Soll. anim. 972F Aristotimosmaywell be exaggerating for effect, but the effect can only be achieved if there is some substance behind the claim. The boy and the goose in Aigion, Glauke and the goose, and Glauke and the ram must all have been fairly well- known stories 37. Like Apion’s delphinero ̄menos (Gell. NA 6.8), the phrase τ$ν δ(  ν Α γ ω3 παιδεραστοupsilonperispomeneντα χ να draws attention to itself not only for its use of the E δ+ Σεκοupsilonperispomeneνδος aν ο κ της Νικομ4δους τοupsilonperispomene Βιθυν*ν βασιλ ως, 8ς "στορε  Ν κανδρος  ν Sκτω3 Περιπετει*ν. For Nicander of Chalcedon, to be distinguished from the better-known Nicander of Colophon, see FGrH 700. It is not clear which of the several Bithynian kings named Nicomedes was Secundus’s master; Jacoby suggests Nicomedes II, king from 149 to ca. 128 bc, and conjectures that Nicander’s text bore the title Περιπ τειαι τ*ν τ ς Βιθυν ας βασιλ ων. 34. Glauke of Chios is mentioned at Theocr. 4.31, Athen. 4.176d, Plut. De Pyth. or. 397A, and perhaps A.P. 7.262 (a brief epitaph to “the renowned Glauke,” attributed to Theocritus). For interpretation of Glauke and her animal lovers in connection with the myth of Orpheus attracting animals by his music, see Goldhill 2005: 276-80, Power 2010: 62-71 (in a discussion of women kitharo ̄idoi). The parallels with Orpheus are indeed suggestive, but it is worth noting that no surviving narrative of Glauke and her animal admirers draws attention to her playing ofmusic. Ogden 2008: 364 hears “the ring of hellenistic poetry” in the stories of Glauke and wonders whether they “originated in Theocritus or a colleague.” By contrast, Thompson 1964: 321 asserts that the story of Glauke and the goose probably has a factual basis (“the owner of pet birds will recognize the poses of the goose as completely realistic”), but describes the incident as a “scandal,” something which no surviving Greek or Roman text actually suggests. 35.

Among Latin texts, in some lines from Lucilius the speaker admires a ram’s genital endowment (Lucil. 534-36 Marx). 37. The reading Α γ ω3 in Plutarch’s text is an emendation, now generally accepted, of the manuscript readings α π* or Α γupsilonacuteπτω. Marx 1889: 85n.1 reads Α γupsilonacuteπτω and thus sees yet another story of a goose and a boy, this time set in Egypt. </page> <page sequence="19"> 218 classical antiquity Volume 32/No. 1 /April 2013 vocabulary of Greek pederasty but for its concisely allusive quality. Like “the ram who desired the musician Glauke” (τ$ν  πιθυμ4σαντα Γλαupsilonacuteκης τ ς κιθαρω3δοupsilonperispomene κρι ν) and “the snake who fell in love with the Aetolian woman” (E δ+ δρ'κων E τ ς Α τωλ δος  ρασθε ς, Plut. Soll. Anim. 972E), the expression reads less as an arch lead-in to an improvised joke or story (“Did you hear the one about the goose and the boy?”) than as a matter-of-fact reference to a commonly known narrative. Another species associated with matters erotic in the Greek and Latin cultural traditions is the horse. The substance known as hippomanes, found on a newborn foal’s forehead or emanating from a mare’s genitals, was a powerful love-charm; the language and imagery of taming, horseback riding, and the stud were elements in discourses of human sexuality 38. But although, as we will see, stories of copulation between human and horse certainly circulated, only one surviving love story of the kind I am exploring here has a horse as protagonist, and—unlike some others (5, 6, 20, 26)—this story was little known even in antiquity. There was a certain Socles of Athens—I have the impression that not many know about him—who was considered beautiful, as indeed he was. He bought a horse who was himself good-looking, but also extremely erotic ( ρωτικ$ν δ+  σχυρ*ς) and evidently too clever to look at other horses. And so he fell intensely in love with his master (29) ( ρBA τοupsilonperispomene δεσπ του δριμupsilonacuteτατα), snorting when approached by him, neighing when he patted him, quite obedient when he mounted him, with a moist gaze when he stood in front of his face. Ael. Nat. anim. 6.44 Aelian’s evocation of a horse’s fourfold physical response to physical contact with the beautiful Socles is memorable, even titillating. We will return to the climax of this story below. In all of the preceding narratives the animal protagonist is male. Two surviving narratives tell of female animals falling in love with human beings, and these narratives stand out in two other ways as well: the animals belong to species with a reputation for being repugnant or dangerous, and the humans do not possess that combination of qualities which explicitly or implicitly marks those of all the other narratives: youth and beauty. The first of these stories (30) involves an asp who was the subject of oral tradition in Egypt. The Egyptians say—and learned men do not take it lightly—that in a certain district of Egypt named after Zeus’s son Heracles there was a boy, good-looking as far as Egyptians go, who herded geese and who had as his lover an asp ( ρ'στριαν  σπ δα λαχε ν). Quite smitten with him, they say, she came to her beloved in a dream and warned him of a plot being 38. See Griffith 2006 for rich discussion. For hippomanes see Plin. NH 28.180-81, Ael. Nat. anim. 3.17, 14.18; for admissarii see Adams 1982: 207 and cf. Henderson 1991: 126-27 for the sexual imagery of horses in Greek Old Comedy. </page> <page sequence="20"> williams: When A Dolphin Loves A Boy 219 made against him by another animal who was her mate (σupsilonacuteννομον); one might say that he was making an attempt on the boy out of jealousy for his bride (τ ς νupsilonacuteμφης). The boy listened to the dream, was persuaded by it and took due precautions. Ael. Nat. anim. 4.56 Aelian elsewhere reports that Egyptians treated asps with respect and thus were safe from being attacked by them (Nat. anim. 17.5), but among his Roman and Greek readers the asp was hardly known for its affection for human beings; and the description of the boy as “good looking as far as Egyptians go” deploys ethnocentric bias in order to undermine the compliment it purports to make. The triangular dynamic, and the encounter between animal and beloved human in a dream, round out the unusual features of this narrative. In the other surviving storywith a female protagonist (31), Eudemos (probably Aristotle’s student) told of a seal, a species with a mixed reputation in antiquity at best:39 Eudemos says that a seal fell in love with a man ( ρασθ ναι  νδρ ς) who regularly dove for sponges, and that she proceeded to a place in the sea where there was a rocky grotto and was intimate with him there (Eμιλε ν αupsilonlenisτ*3). This man was the ugliest among his colleagues, yet to the seal he seemed the most beautiful. Perhaps that is not surprising, though, since it often happens that humans too fall in love with those who are less beautiful than themselves (πολλ'κις τ*ν iττον καλ*ν Yρ'σθησαν), and not only remain unaffected by the good-looking, but pay them no attention at all. Ael. Nat. anim. 4.58 Here, too, there are some unusual details. Not only is the man explicitly described as ugly, indeed superlatively so, but the passing allusion to what the seal and her beloved did in the grotto draws attention to itself, since the verb homilein is a standard euphemism for copulation.40 This passing but vivid evocation of 39. Telling of his encounter with Proteus, Homer’s Menelaos emphasizes seals’ unpleasant odor: “Who would lie next to such a monster of the sea?” (τ ς γ'ρ κ( ε ναλ ω3 παρ! κ4τεϊ κοιμηθε η; Od. 4.443). A remark of Aristotle’s is all the more tantalizing because the text is disputed: female seals’ bodies resemble women’s in certain respects—on some readings, specifically in the genital area (Arist. Hist. anim. 6.567a2-13: %χει δ+ κα  τ$ α δο ον . θ4λεια Mμοιον βατ δι [a flat fish or ray], kπαντα δ+ τ! τοιαupsilonperispomeneτα Mμοια γυναικ ; in his 1968 Belles Lettres edition, Pierre Louis emends to Mμοιον προβ'τω3, π'ντα δ+ τlλλα γυναικ ; earlier conjectures include kπαντα δ+ τ! τοιαupsilonperispomeneτα Mμοιον %χει γυναικ  and kπαντα δ+ τ! τοιαupsilonperispomeneτα Mμοιον α δο ον %χει γυναικ ). See Detienne and Vernant 1978: 259-75 for a reading of seals’ peculiar gait and ambivalent status as animals of both sea and land in connection with the mythic figures of Hephaistos and the Telchines. 40. Cf. Ael. Nat. anim. 6.60, 8.19, and most appositely 4.9 (on a man who has sex with his mare: τελευτ*ντα δ+  πιτολμ σαι τ*3 λ χει τ*3 K νω3 κα  Eμιλε ν αupsilonlenisτ :). Because Aelian paraphrases, we cannot be entirely certain that Eudemus himself used the verb Eμιλε ν, but it is not unlikely that he did and it seems in any case clear that he referred to close physical intimacy between seal and man. Aelian’s paraphrase does not explicitly identify the seal as female, but since the Greek word for </page> <page sequence="21"> 220 classical antiquity Volume 32/No. 1 /April 2013 physical intimacy along with the absence of the other kinds of detail we have seen elsewhere—the man’s name, for example, or where or when this happened—give a touch of the timeless, placeless, emblematic. Indeed, Aelian uses precisely this story to make his point about the surprises and complexities of desire, regardless of species. CLASSIFICATION One of the first questions a scholarly reading of this material will ask is how to classify these narratives. Generations of scholars, starting at least with Marx’s 1889 study, have used such terms as “saga,” “tales,” “legends,” or “fiction 41.” The interpretive gain is clear: we can use the tools provided by Vladimir Propp’s Morphology of the Folktale or Stith Thompson’s Motif-Index of Folk-Literature to describe recurring patterns; we can construct models of development and variation; we can conclude that certain superficially distinct narratives are in some important sense “the same story 42.” With the latter move in particular, however, the risk is great of flattening out differences significant to the narratives themselves: for example, that in (6) the boy is named Hermias and dies at Iasos, whereupon the dolphin kills himself in desperation and the two are buried together in a joint tomb, but in (2) the boy is named Dionysios and not only does not die but is taken to Babylon, and is there made priest of Poseidon by Alexander; or that for the elder Pliny (2) and (6) are quite distinct incidents, and both a goose (21) and a ram (26) fell in love with Glauke. Perhaps the most important feature inherent in the narratives themselves which risks being lost from sight if we classify them as legends or tales is that they present themselves as true stories of events which have occurred in specific times and places, sometimes recently, sometimes with eyewitness reports 43. And the animal is grammatically feminine, male gender would almost certainly have been marked by means of a word like &amp;ρρην. Perhaps more significantly, the seal’s beloved is identified not as a boy or young man (πα ς, μειρ'κιον) but as an adult man ( ν4ρ). In prevailing Greek and Roman gender systems the former are normative objects of desire for males or females, the latter only for females. 41. Cf. Toynbee 1973: 207: “there can be little doubt that these dolphin stories of the Roman period are, to some extent at least, fictitious.” For “tales” and “legends,” see Beagon 1992: 128-29, Goldhill 2005: 279-80, Newmyer 2006: 76-84. 42. Marx, for example, sees (2) as a “new version” of (6), updated by means of inserting Alexander the Great into the plot. Interpretations which implicitly appeal to the notion of “the same version” include Helmbold’s comments in his 1957 Loeb edition of Plut. Soll. anim. at 984F (“the story [6] has a happier ending (sic!) in one version found in Pliny, NH 9.27 [2]: the dolphin dies, but Alexander the Great makes the boy head of the priesthood of Poseidon in Babylon”) and 972E (18, “told somewhat differently, and of a Jewish woman, in Aelian” [19]); and Martı ́nez 1995: 88 with n.12, summarizing 19 and adding a reference to 18: “on es diu que la dona era eto`lia.” 43. Relevant discussions of the complex set of issues surrounding truth, lies, fiction, and belief include Gabba 1981, Beagon 1992: 8-11, Gill and Wiseman 1993, Bowersock 1994, Murphy 2004: 18-22, Ho ̈mke and Baumbach 2006, Daston and Galison 2007. </page> <page sequence="22"> williams: When A Dolphin Loves A Boy 221 they do not do so in the ironic manner of Lucian’s True History, which opens with the admission by the narrator that “the only true thing I will say is that I tell untruths“ (pseudomai, 14). By contrast, while Pliny questions or flatly denies the truth of a range of popular beliefs (the phoenix, the werewolf, the swan song) by means of terms like fabulosum and falsum, he makes no such qualification when referring to the elephant in Alexandria (11), the dolphin in Pozzuoli (5), or the goose in Aegion (20). In other words, he locates his narratives of animals in love among the observable realities of nature that he aims to describe in his Naturalis historia, even if he cannot always provide explanations for them 44. For his part, Plutarch’s Aristotimos distinguishes what he calls muthoi from those animal behaviors which he and others have seen with their own eyes: spiders’ careful plans to entrap their victims, for example, or crows’ and dogs’ use of stones to raise the level of water stored in vessels (Soll. anim. 967A); and the incidents of amorous elephants, rams, and snakes he cites clearly belong to the latter category. Aelian introduces his text as a work of learning (mathe ̄ma), casting himself in the role of “scholar” and “ardent lover of truth” (ale ̄theia ̄s eraste ̄n diapuron). He has either seen with his own eyes or found in earlier writers everything that he records for posterity; he is not telling falsehoods (katapseudesthai).45 And Aulus Gellius is openly skeptical of what he has read in some Greek books which he bought at Brundisium: men in the East who have no necks or only one leg; Indian men who are covered with feathers and subsist on the inhalations of flowers; even the Pygmies: these are not just “wondrous things” but are “unheard- of, unbelievable tales,” even though ancient and authoritative writers, including Pliny himself, cite them as true (Gell. NA 9.4: erant autem isti omnes libri Graeci miraculorum fabularumque pleni, res inauditae, incredulae, scriptores veteres non parvae auctoritatis). Yet Gellius records and accepts the historical truth of Apion’s eyewitness reports on Androclus and the lion in the Circus Maximus at Rome as well as on Hyacinth and the dolphin at Pozzuoli 46. 44. Plin. NH 8.80: homines in lupos verti rursusque restitui sibi falsum esse confidenter existimare debemus, aut credere omnia quae fabulosa tot saeculis comperimus; 10.3: phoenicem, haut scio an fabulose (cf. 11.23: Actaeonem enim et Cipum etiam in Latia historia fabulosos reor); 10.63: olorum morte narratur flebilis cantus—falso, ut arbitror aliquot experimentis; general statement of goals at 11.8: nobis propositum est naturas rerum manifestas indicare, non causas indagare dubias.

The story of Androclus/Androcles and the lion has become a fixed item in the repertoire of fairytales and fables: see Hellmann 2008: 192-98. Apion himself, however, emphasizes that he is taking this incident not from his massive library but from his own experience, and Gellius is at pains to emphasize the distinction: sed in his quae vel audisse vel legisse sese dicit . . . hoc autem, quod in libro Aegyptiacorum quinto scripsit, neque audisse neque legisse, sed ipsum sese in urbe Roma vidisse oculis suis confirmat (Gell. NA 5.15.1-7). </page> <page sequence="23"> 222 classical antiquity Volume 32/No. 1 /April 2013 In connection with their self-presentation as telling of really occurring events, these narratives’ recurring emphasis on witnesses draws attention to itself. To be sure, the claim “I saw it myself” invites being interpreted as one among several authenticating techniques for establishing the “reality effect”; it is hardly a guarantor of factual truth and indeed can highlight the very fictionality of an account 47. But the very use of this authenticating technique makes our animal stories different in kind from two other types of narrative which tell comparable tales of animals and humans: fable and myth. Fables are set in a world in which, as Phaedrus reminds his readers, animals and trees can talk; and their animal protagonists are, generally speaking, ciphers for human beings as much as (perhaps more than) they are representatives of their own species.48 For their part, Greek and Roman myths are set in the distant past, a time when gods moved among and mated with mortals. The stories of Leda and the swan, Europa and the bull, or Ganymede and the eagle, could not, by definition, be told by Greeks and Romans of the historical period who assert, “I saw it myself,” or “an authoritative scholar of a few generations ago saw it with his own eyes.” Furthermore, while visual representations of these and similar mythic tales allow viewers, ancient and modern, to see and reflect on bodily intimacy shared by animal and human (a woman is held in a swan’s winged embrace or rides a bull’s firm back; a boy rests his arm on an eagle’s strong neck as the two look into each other’s eyes),49 verbal narratives of these myths make it clear to their audience that it is not really a swan; and mythic narratives of copulation between humans and real animals are stories of degradation, punishment, monstrosity. Pasiphae is after all a standard image of the monstrous throughout Greek and Latin literature 50. In our narratives of animals who have fallen in love with humans, by contrast, these are real animals, in flesh and blood and desire, no more and no less. There is, moreover, a distinct swerve away from copulation (a point to which we will return), and above all these are not tales of the monstrous or shocking but of the remarkable, the moving, the beautiful. Another interpretive category to consider as we read these narratives is para- doxography. Held to have been inaugurated by Callimachus, texts participating in 47. Cf. Feeney 1993: 239, citing Barthes on “the reality effect:” “We may authenticate utterance by saying ‘I saw it myself;” we may authenticate it by saying the opposite: ‘This is not my story, but the Muses’—or Phaedrus’—or Marlowe’s.’ Either of these two techniques may always be hovering in the background to destabilize its twin.” 48.

See Henderson 2001 and 2004 for translation of and some thought-provoking comments on Phaedrus and the fable tradition; see n.78 below for two fables which tell of animals in love with human beings. 49.

A sampling of the facts and factoids about animals which were culled by Antigonus of Carystus from Aristotle’s Historia animalium gives an idea.51 Deer give birth by the side of roads so as to avoid enemies; the dove uses oregano to heal its wounds; animals which have bladders also have intestines, but those which have intestines do not necessarily have bladders; many animals are bloodless, especially those which have more than four legs; males have more teeth than females, both among humans and among other animals; the eel is neither male nor female. Among the many hundreds of tidbits in Alessandro Giannini’s standard collection of paradoxographical texts, I find only two refer- ences to animals in love: the reference to the rooster and boy in Bithynia (25) by a certain Philo, and Aristotle’s remark about dolphins and boys in Taranto, Caria, and elsewhere (1, 2), as slightly rephrased by Antigonus 52. To some ex- tent, of course, this paucity reflects Giannini’s editorial practice; he might have included many or most of the items in my Table 1. But even those thirty or so items would still be a drop in the bucket of Giannini’s nearly four hundred pages of surviving material. In fact, a reading of those continuous paradoxographical texts included in his edition—Antigonus’s work, the pseudo-Aristotelian Περ  θαυμασ ων  κουσμ'των, the Paradoxographus Vaticanus, and a few others— suggests that stories of animals in love with human beings were barely on the paradoxographers’ radar screen. Moreover, if we consider the wide range of facts and factoids to which the key adjectives παρ'δοKον, θαυμ'σιον, and mirabile are applied—from the seemingly impossible to the mildly surprising to the merely interesting or curious—reading our animal love stories through the lens of para- doxography may not tell us much more than that these incidents were seen as surprising or unusual 53. 51. Alessandro Giannini’s 1965 Paradoxographorum Graecorum Reliquiae, a nearly four- hundred page critical edition of Greek paradoxographical texts with his own Latin translation, offers countless factoids on a broad range of subjects, from plants and animals to rivers and lakes to ethnography. There is something elusive about the very term “paradoxographer:” Who exactly counts, and why? Giannini includes some of the authors quoted by Aelian, but not all of them, and he identifies Aelian himself as an auctor serior, indeed only a pseudoparadoxographus. The criteria are not clear—which is perhaps as it must be, since neither the term παραδοKογρ'φος nor παραδοKογραφ α occurs in any surviving ancient text. See further Schepens and Delcroix 1996. 52. Giannini lists Ael. Nat. anim. 12.37 (on Centaur the cock) as fragment F3 (dubium) of Philo’s Περ  θαυμασ ων; his doubts have to do with whether the Philo whom Aelian quotes is this one or another man by the same name. Antigonus’s modified quotation of Arist. Hist. anim. 8.631a9-11 is listed as Antigonus F1 (the modification has the effect of toning things down a bit; instead of Aristotle’s πρ$ς πα δας %ρωτες κα   πιθυμ αι Antigonus writes πρ$ς πα δας  ρωτικ*ς %χειν). 53. In his Varia historia, Aelian provides a brief catalogue of “absurd” and “paradoxical” but truly occurring love affairs (γελο ους kμα κα  παραδ Kους τοupsilonacuteσδε τοupsilongraveς %ρωτας, 9.39), including Glauke and her animal admirers (21, 26, 27), the young Xenophon of Soloi and his dog lover (28), and the jackdaw who fell in love with a young Spartan (24), along with a young Athenian who fell in love with a statue of Agathe Tyche and finally killed himself, and king Xerxes, who fell in love with a plane tree (cf. Var. hist. 2.14: γελο ος  κε νος E h ρKης). </page> <page sequence="25"> 224 classical antiquity Volume 32/No. 1 /April 2013 Another interpretive category which suggests itself is that of the urban legend, “highly captivating and plausible, but mainly fictional, oral narratives that are widely told as true stories 54.” Like our animal love stories, these are marked by an insistence on the truth of what otherwise might seem incredible or highly strange, by variations in detail, and by an appeal to eyewitnesses, sometimes many of them. On the other hand, a hallmark of urban legends is what specialists have called the FOAF, the friend of a friend, “the ‘reliable witness’ whom no one can ever seem to find or name 55.” In our animal love stories, we have names and even a first-person eyewitness statement or two. Apion’s detailed narrative of what he claims to have seen at Pozzuoli seems far from the world of the FOAF. Furthermore, urban legends are usually reducible to a single narrative—alligators in city sewers, or a cat in a microwave oven—with variations in detail which cluster around the question of where it happened. But it would be hard to identify the single “urban legend” of which our more than thirty narratives of animals would be variations—“the dolphin and the boy” is crucially different from “the snake and the shepherd” or “the elephant and the boy” (or is it “the elephant and the woman”?)—and the least common denominator, “the animal in love with the human,” seems so broad as to be nearly meaningless. The kinds of divergence we find in our animal stories go far beyond the variations typical of urban legends. They get at the very essence of the narrative. Is it the human or the animal who dies? Or do both die? Or neither? Is it only the animal who falls in love with the human, or is there requital of some kind? In short, reading our animal love stories with terms like “legend,” “paradox- ography,” or “urban legend” in mind helps illuminate some of their qualities, yet no one of these categories entirely captures their specificity. Moreover, the very use of any of these labels perhaps inevitably appeals to the antithesis true/false; in any case, interpretations of our animal love stories which use these labels have almost always strongly implied or openly asserted that the events at stake simply did not happen as narrated. I myself incline to locating the burden of proof on the other side—why should we assume that animals cannot fall in love with humans?—but, as I suggested above, as a matter of method my reading of these narratives sets aside true/false questions of historicity or ethology and reads them precisely as narratives, looking for recurring themes and patterns and considering what they can tell us about Greek and Roman perspectives on animals, humans, and desire. 54.

The English Wikipedia article “Pozzuoli,” accessed in December 2012, asserts that 5 (described as “a dolphin who had made friends with a child,” with no mention of ero ̄s) “is considered the first known urban legend;” a similar statement is made in the Italian article “Lago di Lucrino.” 55. Enders 2002: xxiii. </page> <page sequence="26"> williams: When A Dolphin Loves A Boy 225 THEMES AND PATTERNS One point is clear, and worth emphasizing. Although some of them also explore themes of devoted affection or warm gratitude on the part of animals, these narratives (with the notable exception of the elder Pliny’s reports on dolphins and boys) tell of a specifically erotic desire. And they do not speak the language of analogy used by Aristotle when he asserts that animals show “traces” of qualities more fully present in humans, or by Cicero when he grants that they experience “something like human love 56.” Any gestures of comparison or qualification have to do with the animal protagonists’ behavior (“the elephant acted like an abandoned lover”; “one might say the snake acted out of jealousy”), but the reality of their desire is consistently taken for granted and often explicitly asserted. An equally clear pattern in these narratives is that what we might call the vector of desire consistently points in one and the same direction: from animal to human being.57 To be sure, there are hints at requital—as when Gellius uses the figure of litotes to make the point that the young man at Pozzuoli did not entirely reject his dolphin lover’s attentions (pueri non abhorrentis, NA 6.8)— and occasionally even more than hints, as when Aelian attributes reciprocal ero ̄s to the dolphin and boy at Poroselene (Nat. anim. 2.6: ε ς %ρωτα  λλ4λων), or writes that one of the young men at Iasos returned the dolphin’s desire (Nat. anim. 6.15:  ντερ*ν), or describes a young Arcadian man as the “lover and beloved” of a snake (Nat. anim. 6.63:  ραστ/ς κα   ρ μενος). Then there is the Indian elephant trainer, who appears in Aelian’s narrative first as subject of a reciprocated desire (Nat. anim. 3.46: κα  5ρα τοupsilonperispomene κτ4ματος κα   ντηρBτο), then as jealous eromenos vexed at the prospect that someone else might “master” his lover (ibid.: E δ+ 8ς  ρ μενος ζηλοτυπ*ν κα  μ ντοι περιαλγ*ν ε  %μελλε δεσπ σειν αupsilonlenisτοupsilonperispomene &amp;λλος). Like Latin elegiac poetry from Catullus onward, with its male poet-lover and female domina, and like a few joking (?) remarks in Martial’s epigrams to the effect that a man’s slave sexual partners might actually be his domini,58 these 56. Arist. Hist. anim. 7.1.588a17-b3: %νεστι γ!ρ  ν το ς πλε στοις κα  τ*ν &amp;λλων ζ 3ων `χνη τ*ν περ  τ ν ψυχ/ν τρ πων, kπερ  π  τ*ν  νθρ πων %χει φανερωτ ρας τ!ς διαφορ'ς; Cic. De amic. 81: idque faciunt cum desiderio et cum quadam similitudine amoris humani. At Plut. Soll. anim. 961E-F (quoted and endorsed at Porph. De abstinent. 3.22.5), Autoboulos vigorously rebuts arguments like these: they are contradicted by observable reality (παρ! τ/ν  ν'ργειαν) and it is as patently false to say that animals “as it were” (8σανε ) show memory, fear, or anger as it would be to say that they “as it were” hear, see, cry out, breathe, or live. His interlocutor immediately concedes the point. 57. In two stories reported by Aelian—a man who raised a female leopard, “loving her as if she were his friend or girlfriend” (6.2, οpα δ4που φ λην J  ρωμ νην  γαπ*ν), and a young man who raised an eagle “like a boyfriend or younger brother” (6.29,  ρωμ νου δ κην J  δελφοupsilonperispomene νεωτ ρου)— the vector of desire points from human to animal. But the swerve in language (“as if;” “like”) and the open provision of alternative models (boyfriend or brother, friend or girlfriend) stand in significant contrast with the narratives listed in Table 1. 58. Cf. Mart. 11.70, 12.66, 13.69, with discussion at Williams 2010: 170-76, 258-62. </page> <page sequence="27"> 226 classical antiquity Volume 32/No. 1 /April 2013 narratives remind us, if we need reminding, of the complexities of desire and the multivalence of power. Still, the great majority of our narratives distinctly present themselves as reflections on animals’ capacity to fall in love with human beings, not the other way around. By drawing attention to animals’ agency and will, these stories may well cause some readers to ponder other types of living beings who, in Greek and Roman patriarchal traditions, were subject to different but not entirely dissimilar kinds of “othering” with respect to free-born human males: women and slaves, for instance.59 A related pattern has to do with the configurations of gender. All but two of our narratives tell of a male animal falling for a woman or a boy—not for an adult man—and no meaningful distinctions between male/male and male/female pairings are detectable; only two surviving stories have a female animal protago- nist, and both of them tell of human males 60. Further stories with female animal protagonists may well have circulated in antiquity, and among these there may have been stories of female animals in love with women, like Lorenz’s report of the female jackdaw and his housemaid. Still, stories of female animals in love with human beings were clearly in the minority, and none of this is coin- cidental. That human males as a whole are normatively and naturally capable of experiencing desire for both females and males is an axiom throughout the Greek and Latin textual traditions—occasional philosophical objections concern copulation, not desire—whereas female desire in general, and female desire for female in particular, attracts scrutiny and sometimes outright condemnation 61. In short, when Gellius exclaims that the erotic dolphins he describes behave in an astoundingly human fashion (NA 6.8, miris et humanis modis), for “human” we may read “Greco-Roman male,” and the point can easily be generalized: the 59. Much has been written on various types of parallelism between women and animals in ancient Greek religious practice or more generally: see for example Franco 2003 with bibliography, and Griffith 2006 for thought-provoking discussion in connection with equids. For slaves in the Roman literary imagination see Fitzgerald 2000. 60. It is hard to know what to make of the fact that all of the dolphins in these stories desire young men, not women, but it is significant that no ancient text draws attention to this exclusivity. As it happens, male bottlenose dolphins tend to form pair-bonds with other males starting at around the age of ten and do not begin mating with females until the age of twenty or twenty-five; even then, they do not generally pair-bond with females but retain their primary male partners (Bagemihl 1999: 23, 342-48). Thus the dolphin couples to which Pliny refers (NH 9.21, vagantur fere coniugia) may well have been same-sex pairs. As of December 2012 over 165,000 Facebook members have liked a page called “Dolphins are gay sharks.” Independently of dolphins’ actual behavior, the phrase’s evident appeal, perhaps bolstered by an episode of the popular television series Glee, reflects persisting stereotypes of gender and sexuality: sharks’ brute strength is coded as masculine and heterosexual, the light elegance of dolphins as effeminate and homosexual. 61. See Boehringer 2007 and Williams 2010. Particularly relevant is the world of Ovid’s Metamorphoses, where pederastic relations are a matter of course (consider the tale of Lycabas and Athis [5.47-73], the passing reference to Narcissus’s male lovers [3.351-55], and the stories of Apollo and Cyparissus, Apollo and Hyacinth, and Zeus and Ganymede narrated by Orpheus in Book 10), but Iphis, a young woman in love with another, bitterly condemns her own desire, invoking the gods and nature and claiming that female animals are not attracted to other females (9.728-34). </page> <page sequence="28"> williams: When A Dolphin Loves A Boy 227 animals of these narratives act remarkably if unsurprisingly like human beings, Greek and Roman human beings at that. Finally, if we consider what kinds of animals are protagonists of these narratives, we find no clear-cut answer, and that in itself may be significant. All three elements of the tripartite distinction standard in the ancient textual tradition—animals of land, sea, or sky—show up. As for the distinction between wild and domesticated, the majority of our stories involve animal species which generally live outside the world of human cities or farms (dolphins alone account for about one-third); but then there are the dogs, the horse, the geese, and what of those elephants? The stories on snakes (16-19) draw attention to a particularly suggestive ambiguity. These animals come into human homes and become intimate with individual humans, yet often slither away back to their native realm. In short, one plausible reading of our stories is that, as a body of meaningful narratives, they explore the transgression of boundaries and the blurring of distinctions—between human being and animal, between wild and domesticated, between land animals, animals of the sea and sky—in and through ero ̄s. GETTING PHYSICAL On what basis might these ancient narratives be making the claim that these animals experienced a specifically erotic desire for human beings? The difficulties of making any assertions about what animals experience, especially when it comes to feelings or emotions, are notorious 62. But description of observable behavior is a good place to start. Lorenz, for example, notes how some birds display in their interactions with chosen human beings certain kinds of behavior they otherwise display only with actual or potential mates of their own species.63 More recently, Bruce Bagemihl’s magisterial treatment of sexual behavior across a wide range of animal species appeals to five categories: courtship behaviors; expressions of affection; sexual acts (ranging from touching, rubbing, or licking genitals to penetration of various orifices by penises, fingers, or even clitorises); pair-bonding (in turn divided into the categories “partnership,” which is generally accompanied by sexual acts, or “companionship,” which usually is not); and parenting.64 In our Greek and Latin narratives, for their part, what Pliny calls “the signs of love” (Plin. NH 8.14: amoris argumenta) fall into three broad categories. (1) The animal is attracted by the sight of a beautiful young man or woman coming from 62. See Alexandridis et al. 2008 for some of the massive bibliography. Especially relevant to the topic at hand are Masson and McCarthy 1995: 64-90 (love and friendship), Bagemihl 1999 (sexuality), and the reflections in Payne 2010 are thought-provoking. 63. The male who fell in love with Lorenz “tried to make me creep into the nesting cavity of his choice” and fed him “with what he considered the choicest delicacies,” stuffing finely minced worms into Lorenz’s mouth or even ear (Lorenz 2002: 129-30). 64.

(2) The animal clearly wants to be with the beloved, brings gifts, is unwilling to leave his or her side, shows sadness upon separation and deep, sometimes even suicidal, grief if the beloved dies: ero ̄s as attachment. (3) A dolphin takes a young man on his back, an elephant slips his trunk under a woman’s clothes, a snake wraps himself around a body, a goose presses his beak into a neck: ero ̄s as touch. Along with these concrete signs, a more diffuse charge is often in the air— erotic, sometimes phallic. Oppian, for example, imagines the scene at Poroselene (9) in evocative detail. The dolphin comes up to the boy’s boat, lifting up his head so as to touch his beloved, and the boy in turn caresses the dolphin; when the two swim together, their heads touch, and “you would think the dolphin yearned to kiss the boy, hold him against his chest 65.” Less specific but even more evocative is Aelian’s description of the snake who slept “in a very erotic way” with the Judeaean woman (19; Nat. anim. 6.17, σφ δρα  ρωτικ*ς). It is worth noting, too, that the language and imagery of horse-back riding, more than once used of a boy astride his dolphin lover, also describes the sexual position among human beings in which the receptive partner sits astride his or her insertive partner 66. Likewise, Aelian’s narrative of the erect fin (Nat. anim. 6.15, &amp;κανθα . . . Fρθ4) of one of the dolphins at Iasos (6) piercing a boy’s midriff near his navel, leading to a gushing of blood, draws attention to itself, as does a puzzling detail in Apion’s and Pliny’s narrations of the incident at Pozzuoli (5). Pliny writes that the dolphin retracted his fin “as if into a sheath” (Plin. NH 9.24, velut vagina condens), and Apion provides a motivation: he did so in order not to scratch the boy’s flesh (Pliny elsewhere observes that dolphins use their sharp dorsal fin as a weapon against crocodiles: NH 8.91). The language is intriguing enough in itself, as “fitting something into a sheath (vagina)” is a metaphor for sexual (as it happens, anal) penetration in a Plautine joke and no doubt figured in others now lost to us 67. But dolphins’ fins are not retractable, and one wonders whether the images in Apion and Pliny constitute a garbled or discreetly obfuscating reminiscence of 65. Opp. Hal. 5.475-89, concluding: φα ης κ  μιν "με ροντα / κupsilonacuteσσαι κα  στ ρνοισι περιπτupsilonacuteKαι μενεα νειν / Y θεον. The same poet elsewhere writes that male dolphins mate like men and that their genitals resemble those of humans, except that the penis is usually hidden in a sheath, only extended when needed (Hal. 1.580-83). 66. See Apion apudGell. NA 6.8, "ππηδ ν τε περιβεβηκ τα (5); Ael.

For the language of human sexual positioning, see Henderson 1991: 165, Adams 1982: 165-66, and for discussion of the homologies between the taming and riding of horses and human sexual practices, see Griffith 2006: 322-36. 67. Plaut. Pseud. 1181: conveniebatne in vaginam tuam machaera militis? Pliny uses the noun vagina to describe the sheath in which felines retract their claws (NH 8.41) or, in a striking metaphor, the body as a receptacle for the soul (NH 7.174). Other linguistic details in the dolphin-boy narratives are capable of a secondary sexual meaning: see Henderson 1991: 179 for κεντε ν, 112 for Fρθ ς, and 76 for the eroticization of the navel (cf. Arist. Clouds 977 on the sexy young men of the good old days: τοupsilonlenisμφαλοupsilonperispomene . . . upsilonasperπ νερθεν). Adams 1982: 98-99 suggests that &amp;κανθα can be a metaphor for the </page> <page sequence="30"> williams: When A Dolphin Loves A Boy 229 an anatomical feature peculiar to whales and dolphins: both males and females have a so-called “genital slit,” within which the male’s penis is hidden when not erect 68. Against this suggestive background, Apion’s (or perhaps Gellius’s) term δελφινερ μενος (Gell. NA 6.8) is all the more evocative: one thinks of human eromenoi and their admirers on Attic vase painting, the embraces, the “up-and-down” pose, intercrural copulation.69 And yet, with the apparent exception of Aelian’s narrative of the seal and the ugly sponge-diver (31) and perhaps also of a dolphin and a young man (10), none of the narratives in Table 1 brings the animal’s desire to fulfillment in a genital act. In some constellations of species, to be sure, copulation would seem a physical impossibility, but even in those cases in which genital contact in one form or another is possible, verbs like coire orσυγγ γνεσθαι do not occur in the narratives. There is, in short, a distinct swerve away from the genital. Nor is this entirely surprising. Apart from a few smilingly ironic references to shepherds or farmers resorting to livestock in the absence of opportunities for sexual contact with other humans 70, animal-human copulation is regularly portrayed in the ancient textual tradition as monstrous or perverse. Among incidents reported as really having occurred, the story of the Babylonian queen Semiramis and her stallion was evidently well known (Juba, preserved by Pliny at NH 8.155; Hygin. Fab. 243.7); Eudemos wrote of a man who copulated with his mare, provoking such outrage in the mare’s foal that he killed the man (Ael. Nat. anim. 4.8); and Aelian alludes to what must have been an unusual scandal in Rome: a matron was tried for adultery—rather ordinary scandal, that—but the adulterer was a dog (Ael. Nat. anim. 7.19)!71 And, as we have seen, Pasiphae is a standard clitoris and pinnacula or pinnae for the labia. In Oppian’s narrative of the pair at Poroselene (9), the boy takes hold of the dolphin’s dorsal fin (Opp. Hal. 5.490-91). 68. Bagemihl 1999: 339-59. 69. For Athenian iconography of pederastic couples, see especially Dover 1978, Lear and Cantarella 2008. To avoid any misunderstanding: I am not suggesting that Apion, Pliny, or others are implying that the dolphin anally penetrated the boy (indeed, the vagina in Pliny’s narrative is the dolphin’s) but am drawing attention to the perceptible sexual charge of this and other narratives. 70. E.g., Plut. Sept. sap. conviv. 149C-E (asked for advice about a mare who gave birth to a human/horse hybrid, Thales replied that youngmen should not be allowed to be the mares’ caretakers, or else they should be given wives). Phaedr. 3.3 tells a similar story regarding Aesop and lambs born with human faces. 71. Other allegations of real-life copulation between animals and humans include Plin. 7.30 (on men in India who copulate with wild animals and produce bestial offspring), Ael. Nat. anim. 7.19 (on dogs and baboons who sexually assault women), and 15.15 (“reddish apes,” probably orangutans, who do the same). In the realm of invective poetry, see Juv. 6.332-34 (women and asses, a sign of women’s uncontrolled libido) and Anth. Lat. 148-49 Riese (a man and his mare: prodigiosa Venus, crimen, gravis ira deae). For fictional narrative see Apul.Met. 7.20-22 (a boy accuses Lucius the ass of having raped women, girls, and boys), 10.19-23 (Lucius tells how a Thessalian matron successfully seduced him, introducing his tale with an evocation of the woman’s vesana libido and a comparison to Pasiphae) with the so-called spurcum additamentum; cf. Lytle 2003. The title character of Plutarch’s Gryllus, one of Odysseus’ shipmates who had been turned by Circe into a pig, makes a set of claims which are as patently false as they are polemical: humans are the only </page> <page sequence="31"> 230 classical antiquity Volume 32/No. 1 /April 2013 example of the monstrous. To the rhetoric of the monstrous and perverse could be added that of the unnatural: Artemidorus’s description of the kinds of sexual acts occurring in dreams assigns both male/female and male/male copulation among human beings to the category “natural” (κατ! φupsilonacuteσιν), but female penetration of female, copulation between humans and gods, and copulation between humans and animals all fall into the category of “unnatural” acts (παρ! φupsilonacuteσιν).72 Animal-human copulation was, then, a matter for rough humor, satire, or invective, and could be condemned as unnatural, monstrous, or shocking in a tone ranging from ridicule to outrage: if contact is initiated by a human being, he or she is targeted for his or her excessive, uncontrolled desires, and allusions to animals who try to have their way with human beings (and sometimes succeed) are tales of bestial lust.73 But in our stories, an animal’s falling in love with a human being is a sign of the remarkable capacities of animals, the marvelous diversity of nature, and the universal power of beauty and desire. After summarizing Hegemon’s narrative of Aleuas and the snake (17), Aelian makes explicit an assumption underlying so many of these narratives: “Evidently it is a property of animals that they can fall in love not only with their own kind and their own species, but also with one who is not related to them at all, yet beautiful” (Ael. Nat. anim. 8.10). Elsewhere Aelian comments on the snake and the Judaean woman (19) with an homage to Eros as ruler over gods and animals which invites being read with more famous Virgilian lines on the power of love over humans as well as animals of land, sea, and sky: love is the same for all 74. We return to the story of the beautiful young Socles of Athens and his horse (29), which we left hanging: This was, to be sure, all quite erotic, but it seemed delightful enough ( ρωτικ! Vντα 5δη Mμως τερπν!  δ κει). Yet when the horse rashly began to want to do something to the young man (Lς τι κα  δρασε ων ε ς τ$ μειρ'κιον προπετ στερος) and people started sayingmonstrous things omnivorous animals (991C); no male animal has ever desired to copulate with another male, no female with another female (990D); no animal has ever tried to copulate with a human being (991A). For some visual representations of animal-human copulation see Johns 1982: 108-11, Goure ́vitch 1983, Alexandridis 2008. 72. Artemidorus, Oneirokritika 1.80; cf. Winkler 1990: 17-44. 73. As for acts initiated by animals, Aelian writes that dogs “boldly assault” women ( πιτολμBν) and baboons “force” them (βι'σασθαι; Nat. anim. 7.19); certain red apes are “woman-crazy” (γυναικομανε ς) and feared as potential adulterers (μοιχο ; Nat. anim. 15.15). Among more recent reflections on animal-human sex, Edward Albee’s The Goat, or Who Is Sylvia, while in one scene considering the goat Sylvia’s gaze at a man named Martin, is nonetheless a drama of human desires (man for wife, man for goat, man for son, son for father) and rather insistently focuses on the question of copulation. 74.

See Gale 1991 for a reading of these lines in conjunction with Lucretius. Oppian’s Cynegetica 2.393-444 evokes Eros’s ability to cause animals to desire not only their own kind but other species as well. </page> <page sequence="32"> williams: When A Dolphin Loves A Boy 231 about the two of them (δι ρρει λ γος upsilonasperπ+ρ  μφο ν  τοπ τερος), Socles could not bear the slander. Rejecting the horse as if he were a lascivious lover, he sold him off (8ς  ραστ/ν  κ λαστον μισ4σας  πημπ λησε). Unable to endure separation from the beautiful boy, the horse resolutely starved himself to death. Ael. Nat. anim. 6.44 The horse’s flattering attentions, his looks and his neighs, his perceptible re- sponse to being ridden: all this was acceptable enough and even “delightful”— presumably both to Socles and to others who saw it all happening. But then the horse went too far (Aelian’s language is decorous, but the verb δρασε ων suggests that he showed signs of wanting to penetrate the boy) and people began talking, apparently even insinuating that the boy was letting the horse have his way (λ γος upsilonasperπ+ρ  μφο ν). And so the situation became intolerable for Socles, who put an end to it by means of a drastic expedient not available to him in the case of an unwelcome human lover, thus precipitating the tragic outcome 75. In its exploration of the boundaries of an acceptable ero ̄s, this narrative draws out a question or two lurking in many others. Greek traditions of pederasty, with their careful negotiation of differences in status and delicate balance on the point of copulation, offer food for thought. Whatever actually happened in private, the younger partner in a pederastic couple must not seem to desire sex with his lover— in particular, not to enjoy being penetrated—if he wished his growing masculinity to remain intact in the all-important sphere of public representation. And so we see some clear rules of the game, even some taboos. In visual media, there is the well- known reluctance to depict the anal penetration of beardless youth by bearded man in Attic vase painting. Publicly uttered words were subject to comparable restrictions: gleefully ignored by the characters and choruses of Old Comedy, these restrictions are well illustrated by an anecdote regarding Periander, the sixth-century bc tyrant of Ambracia, who one day asked his boyfriend: “Aren’t you pregnant yet?” The remark—whether affectionate, teasing, or insulting in intent—provoked a dramatic reaction. According to Plutarch, the boy killed his lover, while according to Aristotle, the insult sparked a larger plot against Periander 76. In any case, the anecdote reveals a great deal about a certain code of 75. Cf. Griffith 2006: 328: “Aelian’s narrative seems to compliment the horse on its good taste in noticing Socles’ beauty; indeed their erotic affair, it seems, was initially decorous and even somewhat mutual, similar to that between any human erastes/eromenos pair. But it went a little too far. The conclusion of the story confirms the essential nobility of the lovesick horse.” I pursue another but complementary implication of the story’s conclusion. Decorously observing that “certain stallions, if not watched and handled strictly, are not particularly choosy about their mates,” Hyland 1990: 234 speculates that what Socles experienced “was not an uncommon occurrence.” 76.

What was suspected, taken for granted, or even known was one thing; what was openly said was quite another. Might Socles and his horse stand for some other animal-human pairs, pederastically configured or not? An animal’s display of affection for a human being might not only be tolerated but celebrated, and even to a degree reciprocated. But there were limits, above all to what one would want said. LOVE, BEAUTY, KINSHIP A body of tales of love between animal and human from across Native North America have rather different emphases. These are not humorous or scandalized stories of sex between species or myths of animals who are not really animals but anthropomorphic gods in disguise; these are not stories of the power of human beauty; these are not even primarily stories of desire. These are serious narratives of relationships between humans and animals, the real thing. In a traditional Haida story written down in the nineteenth century, a bear takes a human woman as his wife and tries his best to please her; the song he sings for her is handed down among the Haida people, and whoever can sing it can count on the lasting friendship of bears (Erdoes and Ortiz 1984: 419-23). Telling the story of the union of a male eagle and a human woman, the twentieth-century Lakota holy man John Fire Lame Deer concludes: “So we are descended from the eagle; we are an eagle nation” (Erdoes and Ortiz 1984: 95). The Abenaki protagonist in a novel written by contemporary storyteller Joseph Bruchac reflects on ancient marriages between dogs and humans which gave rise to certain families among his people (Bruchac 1993: 55). And the narrator in the passage from Ojibwe novelist Louise Erdrich’s The Antelope Wife quoted at the beginning of this article raises the possibility of copulation even as she rejects it with a slyly humorous remark: “Of course, too bad that he’s a deer.” But in her next breath she speaks of another kind of physical intimacy—a shared bed, the feel of his stiff hair—and then brings us to what really counts: shared lives, relationship, family 77. The Greek and Roman narratives I have surveyed here tell not so much of family or kinship as of the universal sway of desire and the global power of beauty. And while these narratives offer a clear challenge to the teachings of Stoics, Aristotelians, and others about the uniqueness of humanity and the inferiority of animals, we should make no mistake about it: the beauty which triumphs in these stories is that of the human beings, not of the animals. It is worth noting, too, that, in the end, these narratives assert the ultimate impossibility of 77. These are recurring themes in stories told and sung across the continent. Among the stories collected in Erdoes and Ortiz 1984, for example, see “The Girl Who Married Rattlesnake” (Pomo), 397-98, and “The Owl Husband” (Passamaquoddy), 399-402; see also Evers and Molina 1987 for Yaqui deer songs, Tedlock 1999 for Zuni stories, and Harrod 2000 for further discussion. </page> <page sequence="34"> williams: When A Dolphin Loves A Boy 233 fulfillment.78 In all of this, our stories of animals in love explore some central themes in Greek and Roman reflections on desire itself. In Plato’s Symposium, Aristophanes tells a story of halved beings searching for completion: in a famous phrase, he describes ero ̄s as “the desire and pursuit of the whole.” But those beings are unmistakably anthropomorphic, and one’s other half, whether of the same or opposite sex, is of the same species. In her climactic revelation, Diotima limits animals’ experience of ero ̄s to the drive toward copulation—with each other, she carefully specifies—and to the raising of offspring; and lurking throughout the Symposium is the image of striving for something one does not, perhaps cannot, have 79. An elephant awkwardly caresses a young woman’s breasts—but no more than that. A snake wraps himself around a pair of legs—but then slithers away. A dolphin delights in carrying a young man on his back—but eventually must bring him back to shore. And a horse, precisely by coming too close to achieving the union he so clearly desires, provokes the ultimate rejection. Brooklyn College and the Graduate Center, CUNY CraigW@brooklyn.cuny.edu 78. In the fable tradition, consider Aesop 50 ed. Perry (a female weasel falls in love with a man, is transformed into a human so that she may marry him, but when the bride reveals her true nature, the marriage is dissolved and she returns to her weasel state) and Aesop 140 ed. Perry (a lion falls in love with a girl and is accepted by her father as son-in-law on condition that he remove his fangs and claws, but when the lion does so, the girl’s father loses his respect for him and calls off the marriage; Babrios 98 adds the remark that ero ̄s between lions and humans is impossible: 8ς &amp;μικτον  νθρ ποις /  ρBν λε ντων J λ οντας  νθρ πων). Canadian novelist Marian Engel’s Bear tells of a white woman named Lou who develops an intimate relationship with a male bear. It is notable that an elderly Cree woman named Lucy who frames the narrative is interested in friendship between human and bear (35, 112), whereas the white narrator describes the genital pleasures she experiences with the bear in explicit detail. To be sure, on one hot summer evening the narrator “lay naked, panting, wanting to be near her lover, wanting to offer him her two breasts and her womb, almost believing that he could impregnate her with the twin heroes that would save her tribe” (98). But that “almost” is key; in the end, as she tells the bear one day, “It’s over. You have to go to your place and I to mine” (107). 79. Pl.
