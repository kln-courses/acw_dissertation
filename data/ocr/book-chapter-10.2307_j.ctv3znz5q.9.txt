<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Chapter Four  The Unhappy Endings of Morphology Oswald Spengler’s Demonic History Kyklisches so gut wie eschatologisches Denken kann sich der  großen Parallele bedienen. [Cyclical as well as eschatological  thought can make use of grand parallels.] —Carl Schmitt, “Drei Möglichkeiten eines christlichen   Geschichtsbildes” (Blumenberg and Schmitt,  Briefwechsel 1971–1978) The Problem of “Realization-Recoil” The Austrian novelist Heimito von Doderer used the term “Erfüllungs- Rückstoß”—“the recoil of fulfillment”—to refer to a wide range of  phenomena associated with the idea of realization in its various senses. The  term appears in Doderer’s diary as a part of the important 1933 “thematic”  list (discussed in chapter 7), which conceives it as a political allegory, specifi- cally as a mode of reflecting on new problems that inevitably arise when an  idea or plan is realized. The “realization” in question in 1933 was the end  of the Weimar Republic and the Nazi rise to power in Germany. Doderer,  an Austrian, had been a supporter of the Austrian National Socialist move- ment since before 1933. This context is clear in his diary, according to which  Erfüllungs-Rückstoß defines the situation of artists in the new political land- scape: “The condition in which a spiritual worker [ein spiritueller Arbeiter]  now finds himself, in the first period after the birth of the new Reich, stands  under the psychological law of Erfüllungs-Rückstoß” (Tagebücher 1920– 1939, 1:651, my translation).1 Doderer’s support of Nazism and his reactionary politics at this time pose  questions that may never be completely answerable.2 Biographical issues  aside, however, the problem of realization and fulfillment undoubtedly  reflects a more general experience. Georg Lukács, for example, may have   87 </page> <page sequence="2"> 88 The Unhappy Endings of Morphology confronted similar uncertainties following the Russian Revolution of 1917. A  more contemporary example of such a “recoil” scenario is the post-1989 fall  of communism, which led to speculation about “the end of history,”3 while  the citizens of affected nations did not experience an immediate realization of  all of their hopes and dreams. On the political stage, the “recoil” of a “real- ization” includes renewed conflict, disappointment, and despair (which may  undermine the proclaimed “realization”). Doderer’s case is trivial, one might  say, because he mostly seems to understand the problem with respect to his  own chances as a writer. Even this triviality, however, reveals the conception’s  wide applicability to countless large and small events; and this in turn makes  it viable as a literary theme capable of surviving Doderer’s involvement with  fascism.4 The psychological law of “fulfillment recoil” is psychological because it  applies to everyone differently; it would state that once a particular sweeping  change has taken effect—such as a military victory or “the birth of an empire”  or the election of a certain president—this does not mean that every individual  hope (or fear) is automatically realized. To the contrary, Erfüllungs-Rückstoß  is only the first wave of future backlash, the first moment of disillusion- ment. Thus the Nazis’ rise to power was ironically inauspicious for Doderer,  because his pro-Nazi epic The Demons (begun around 1930) was supposed  to end with a vision of the “new empire.” History got there first, realizing  his hopes before he could programmatically espouse them in writing. This  odd case of timing provided the basis for his postwar literary success: if he  had actually completed and published a pro-Nazi novel (before or after the  Anschluss), it would have been exceedingly difficult for him to convincingly  backtrack his ideological commitments in time to save his reputation. “Fulfillment recoil” is not one theme among others—for Doderer or in  general. It recurs throughout his work as a figure of the demonic, starting  with early texts predating his turn toward fascist politics.5 This idea—of  “being taken aback by an unexpected realization”—is most compactly and  systematically articulated in Doderer’s diary (May 5, 1933) in a “microscopic  comparison”: It is this Erfüllungs-Rückstoß which still always takes one’s breath  away [den Atem versetzt]. Allow me a small, even microscopic com- parison [Vergleich]. If I am thinking of someone as I walk down  the street, and then he is suddenly and “accidentally” [‘zufällig’]  standing in front of me in the flesh: this means that something has  jumped from the inside into the outside [etwas von innen nach aus- sen gesprungen] and a thought has become flesh [ein Gedanke Fleisch  geworden]. After that, to put it mildly, one is left gasping for air. . . .  The irrational has once again staged one of its great eruptions [Ein- brüche] into history (and maybe history essentially consists only of  such eruptions). (TB 1:591) </page> <page sequence="3"> Oswald Spengler’s Demonic History 89 This kind of scenario, in which a thought, fantasy, or desire is unexpect- edly realized externally—ambiguously as if from the outside—is an ordering  principle in the final published version of Doderer’s The Demons. Chance  encounters are made to coincide with concerns welling up from the inside.  This phenomenon bears an affinity with what Freud called “the uncanny”  (das Unheimliche), and thus it is not without precedent in fiction. The dif- ficulty of knowing or deciding what to do when something appears to realize  itself can also be conceived as a morphological problem: “Fulfillment recoil”  arises whenever one wants to discern a culmination or declare that a particu- lar developmental (or historical) cycle is finished and has run its course. But  not all endings are of the same quality, and, depending on one’s perspective,  an end may be a new beginning. A finished cycle may produce a restart—or  an ending may endure in a more or less stable way, giving rise to a new (but  perhaps only apparent) continuity. Especially in biographical analyses and plot mechanics, the unworkability  of the morphological format becomes apparent. Goethe’s conception of mor- phology supposes open and potentially endless cycles; but from the perspective  of an individual life, thought and action are often conceived in terms of ends.  Morphology causes limited ends and “realizations” to appear subjective in a  way that blocks their interpretation as the realization of a supposedly objec- tive morphological providence. The only perspectives from which realizations  can be judged are the intents and the desires of individuals. But, as Doderer  knew, especially unwilled events (or those that are only wished for) are not  fulfillments but demonically charged wish fulfillments, disorienting coinci- dences that leave one “gasping for air” in the face of an irrational eruption. Goethe’s mood on the very last page of book 20 of Poetry and Truth can  also be taken as an example of “fulfillment shock.” At first glance, it might  appear that there is no sense of disillusionment here, but readers of the Italian  Journey may still see this euphoria as a partial precondition of a future disap- pointment. The initial reaction may be shock—a forward-looking emptiness,  in which past cares echo away in the desired outcome—but disappointment  may be the only way forward: what can follow such a profound (but perhaps  partly retrospective) fulfillment? The conflict is resolved, the desired outcome  achieved, but how should things now proceed? Unlike the end of Poetry and  Truth, the treatment of the problem of historical and artistic fulfillment in  Goethe’s conversation with Eckermann on March 11, 1828, is ironically  fatalistic. “Fulfillment” here is not identical with death, but it is related to it: —The only way out is to keep ruining oneself! [Der Mensch muß  wieder ruiniert werden!]—Every exceptional individual has a certain  mission [Sendung], which he is called [berufen] to bring about. Once  he has accomplished it, he has no purpose on earth in this form [in  dieser Gestalt], and Providence will reuse him for something else.  But because everything down here happens in the course of nature,  </page> <page sequence="4"> 90 The Unhappy Endings of Morphology the demons try to trip him up, over and over until he finally falls.  This is what happened to Napoleon and many others. Mozart died  in his thirty-sixth year, Raphael at almost the same age, and Byron  was only a little older. But all had fulfilled their mission [Mission]  perfectly, and then it was simply time for them to go [es war wohl  Zeit daß sie gingen], so that something is left to do for others in this  world, which was set up to be long-lasting. (Eckermann, Gespräche  mit Goethe, 660) The morphological point of Erfüllungs-Rückstoß is that once “form”  (Gestalt) has been achieved (as the result of a development or culmination),  there is nowhere to go but down. The productive energies that went into the  blossoming of form cease and become static following their realization, and  death (or at least “ruin”) is the precondition of continued individual contri- butions to a greater whole. Goethe’s explanation here differs, at least in part, from his Orphic  “Urworte,” Poetry and Truth, and the morphological writings; to Eckermann  he asserts a comprehensive analogy between human life, history, and the  forms and cycles of nature. Regardless of the cause of such deaths, the “mor- phological” or “demonic” cause was the fact that these geniuses had fulfilled  their intended purpose. This “mission” was also not exclusively their own but  was facilitated by “demons,” as well as the higher powers of “nature” and  “providence.” The main topic of the conversation is the source of Goethe’s  own creativity, and thus his own long life stands in implicit contrast to Byron,  Mozart, and Raphael. Goethe does not die, and he avoids the demons by  “ruining” and subsequently reinventing himself. Doderer presents history as essentially consisting of irrational breaks and  false fulfillments. Goethe’s remark to Eckermann, on the other hand, under- stands history like Gundolf, who allows contingency to be subsumed by  overarching morphological necessity. In book 20 of Poetry and Truth, Goethe  characterizes life more like Doderer as a permanent failure of learning: “we  usually only learn the strategy after the campaign is over” (HA 10:183)—but  he tells Eckermann that the lives of “great men” are overseen by a supraper- sonal providence. History is a cosmic drama and the exclusive result of the  productive energy of exemplary individuals. This is Gundolf’s thesis, but it  does not conform to the more systematic and less conventional narratives of  the Orphic “Urworte,” Poetry and Truth, and the morphology. However, the naturalization of the “untimely” deaths of heroes and  geniuses—rationalized so as to make them precisely timely—may be partly  ironical. He tells this story to Eckermann in a rather unserious way (which  Eckermann is likely to take seriously). Goethe ignores empirical-historical  causation, for example, in favor of a legend about the “mission” of geniuses  whom “demons will try to trip up.” His final words offer an especially implau- sible justification: the productivity of geniuses must come to an end “so that,  </page> <page sequence="5"> Oswald Spengler’s Demonic History 91 in the course of the world, which is conceived on the long term, there’s some- thing left for the rest of us to do.” Such a witty explanation may work in a  conversation, but there is no reason to think that Goethe actually believed it. With respect to Goethe’s own longevity, the line about “leaving something  for others to do” implicitly gives voice to younger writers (who may have  wished Goethe had a shorter career). With respect to history, the ironies of  Goethe’s story take the form of latent counter-narratives and myths. They  are ironic because in our time one is supposed to know better. However,  many philosophies of history arguably have a similarly ironic structure.  Goethe’s story of fulfillment dynamics, for all of its unseriousness, betrays  an awareness of epistemological problems common to both morphology and  the philosophy of history. Morphology’s diachronic idea of form can, so to  speak, never decide if it is cyclical or teleological. Form-in-transformation  can only be represented as an arbitrary point on a continuum, and any given  moment of a cycle can only represent the underlying process metonymically.  The metonymic shift from transformation to enduring form (Gestalt) freezes  metamorphosis and hypostasizes morphology’s diachronic-teleological  intent. A “form” in transformation, retrospectively isolated as an apparent  culmination, fruition, or fulfillment, can only be a metaphor, the coloration  of which always reflects value judgment and anthropomorphism. Goethe’s  reading of the lives of geniuses is thus not only a “naturalization” of human  history through the analogy with natural forms: the morphological concep- tion of nature itself includes the human perspective that makes the analogy  possible in the first place. Introducing Oswald Spengler The pitfalls of this kind of philosophy of history are most apparent in  Oswald Spengler’s Decline of the West (Der Untergang des Abendlandes:  Umrisse einer Morphologie der Weltgeschichte, 1918 and 1922). This noto- rious work, more often mentioned on account of its influence than actually  read, is a valuable source for ideas about the demonic, because, like Gundolf,  Spengler tries to fuse the demonic and morphology. Spengler, more drastically  even than Gundolf, places morphology’s method of retrospective analogiza- tion in the service of a sweeping historical hypothesis. Goethe’s remarks to  Eckermann indicate that an approach like Spengler’s was always a possibility  of morphology, but Goethe himself never pursued it. And he never would  have, because for him morphology was a way of thinking—a medium of  reflection—and not a descriptive or predictive theoretical system. Many of Spengler’s self-proclaimed “innovations” are easily unmasked as  morphological rejuvenations of the clichés of a quasi-philosophical philoso- phy of history. In this category is the language of “rise and fall,” “development  and decay,” “blossoming and fading.” If one wanted to see an innovation  </page> <page sequence="6"> 92 The Unhappy Endings of Morphology here, it would lie in the interdependence and ambiguity of opposing terms:  for Spengler, “recoil” is an immanent part of the formal-developmental  structure of “fulfillment,” “culmination” (Vollendung), and cannot be dif- ferentiated from “decline” (Untergang). “The history of a culture is the  progressive realization of its possibilities [die fortschreitende Verwirklichung  ihres Möglichen]. Culmination is synonymous with the end [Die Vollendung  ist gleichbedeutend mit dem Ende]” (UdA 141).6 These sentences give com- pact expression to Spengler’s idea that every culture harbors the possibility  of developing its own unique civilization; its “culmination” terminates this  potential and at the same time fully realizes it (to the retrospective viewer). For Spengler, the telos is only a passing phase, the beginning of the end.  This stands in contrast with a retrospective view of history focusing on  unrealized potentials or felicitous historical correspondences. This is not  Spengler’s approach. For him, each cultural-historical monad has only one  unique realization and its only possible outcomes are success or failure. A  culture may fail to realize its potential for numerous contingent reasons, but  this is irrelevant for the success stories, such as the West, which succeeded but  have already passed their zenith. According to Spengler, cultures blossom into  civilizations, and the latter are, by definition, in a state of decline with respect  to the culture that gave rise to them. To illustrate this conception, Spengler  makes a literary-historical hypothesis: “Goethe could—perhaps—have died  in his younger years, but not his ‘idea.’ Faust and Tasso would not have  been written, but even without this poetic manifestation, in a very mysterious  sense they would nevertheless have ‘been’ ” (UdA 189). What applies here on  the small scale is valid for history itself. All historical events are functionally  “substitutable” (vertretbar) for other historical events within a morphologi- cally predetermined system of inevitable realization: The French Revolution could have been substituted [vertreten] by  an event of a different form [von anderer Gestalt] and in a different  place [an anderer Stelle], maybe in England or Germany. Its “idea,”  . . . the transition from culture to civilization, the victory of the anor- ganic cosmopolis over the organic countryside, . . . was necessary, and  indeed precisely at this moment [in diesem Augenblick]. . . .When an  event is epoch-making, this means: it marks a necessary, fateful turn- ing point [eine notwendige, schicksalshafte Wendung] in the course  [Ablauf] of a culture. (UdA, 193) Unlike Doderer’s “fulfillment recoil,” Spengler’s idea of “culmination” (Vol- lendung), though synonymous with “the end,” pretends indifference toward  the effects and affects of beginnings and endings. In the big picture there is  only one possible outcome, he argues; accidents or coincidences only affect  the specific way in which the end is achieved. Spengler’s philosophy of history  is thus the exact opposite of Doderer’s: the latter sees history as an endless  </page> <page sequence="7"> Oswald Spengler’s Demonic History 93 series of irrational, merely apparent fulfillments. For Doderer, no historical  (or biographical) “culmination” can be the verifiable result of “demonic”  entelechy. In Spengler, on the other hand, a preordained morphological  superstructure provides certainty and stability, which allow contingencies to  be cancelled in the process of culmination. By positing that there is only one possible end, Spengler’s theory of sub- stitution (Vertretung) negates the sphere of means. The point of the end itself  is thereby also negated: a Vollendung from which nothing can proceed, from  which nothing begins, is precisely contrary to Goethe’s morphology, which  sought to imagine not only the analogical but the generative interconnection of  all things ad infinitum. Rather than concentrating on forms and their genesis,  Spengler’s morphology focuses on the determination of a discrete, closed, and  repeatable, cyclical form of history. To the extent that history is the predeter- mined form of all forms, the forms themselves are only the superfluous evidence  of the “morphology of world history.” For Spengler, events and actions are also  morphologically structured, occurring for the sake of an unavoidable but ulti- mately senseless “culmination,” which is to say: for no reason at all. This reading of cyclical form in terms of inevitable mortality gives the  impression of an overelaborate nihilism, which may make sense at a cosmic  scale, which makes earthly life seem diminishingly small and insignificant.  But there is little reason to think, as Spengler does, that cyclical forms could  be generalized in a way that would allow for prognostication. He does  not argue that “everything passes away” or “all life is mortal,” but argues  for a universal etiology of rise and fall. He refuses to call this fated cycle  “teleology,” because this conception instrumentalizes and “rationalizes”  heroic-tragic destiny (UdA 157); the idea of inevitable decline explicitly  opposes both eschatological and progressive understandings of history. But  these disclaimers do not mean that his morphology of history is not teleologi- cal.7 In Goethe’s morphology, the form of the cycle itself must be teleological  in order to be identified as a cycle. In part 2 of Decline of the West, Spengler  seeks to clarify this point by arguing for “local” teleologies (“culminations”)  against a single unifying teleology: I protest . . . against two assumptions that have corrupted all histori- cal thought up to the present: against the assumption of an ultimate  goal [Endziel] of all of humanity and against the denial of the exis- tence of any kind of goals [Endziele]. Life has a purpose [Ziel]. It is  the fulfillment of that which was posited [gesetzt] in its conception  [Zeugung]. (UdA 613) The beginning always already includes the end and eliminates everything  between. One could speak in Spengler’s sense of “limited” and “general” tele- ologies. The larger problem, however, lies in the dubious significance or  </page> <page sequence="8"> 94 The Unhappy Endings of Morphology meaningfulness of the Ziele and Endziele: ultimately, the secularized and  naturalized providence of Spengler’s theory is meaningless insofar as it lacks  an external guarantee or reference. The discernment of “limited” teleological  cycles endows life and history with a purely (but merely) immanent purpose  within the morphological system. A further problem is the way that perceived  cyclical “forms” are immediately identified with real cyclical, iterative, and  developmental cycles; analogies are easily constructed if the points of com- parison are general enough. The existence and meaning of iterative-cyclical  form is a genuine question, but if it is approached in a very general way (as  “nature”), then everything seems to fit. Key arguments from the first pages of Spengler’s introduction illustrate the  approach and its drawbacks. One might imagine that he is focused on classic  questions of the philosophy of history, for example, the “old questions” of  Kant’s 1798 “The Conflict of the Faculties”: Does history reflect a general  progress of mankind? Is it possible to conceive of history a priori? Accord- ing to Kant, only a transcendental a priori would allow the form and ends of  history to be known. Historical or economic trends in the small scale—the  perception of busts and booms, advances and setbacks—are ambiguous with  respect to the question of ultimate ends, and the relevant time scales for  measuring cycles are never completely certain. Only if the condition of the  possibility of history can be established can its direction and telos be guar- anteed (even if the precise path is unforeseeable).8 Kant treats this question  with strategic irony, whereas Spengler offers a relatively prosaic answer: the  a priori of history can only be perceived empirically, a posteriori. Hindsight  and comparative analysis—after the end of many histories, cultures, and civi- lizations—make it possible to perceive the general form of history. Beyond the systematic and theoretical aspects of this question, however,  Spengler is pragmatically motivated. He wants to know how to make history  at the end of history. To act historically, he argues, one must know what history  will do and what outcomes it will favor. Lacking this knowledge, historical  ends are not directly pursued by individual actors but indirectly through the  “cunning of reason.” It has been argued (for example, by Nietzsche and Rein- hart Koselleck) that it is detrimental to human agency if history is viewed as  a suprapersonal “spirit.” Spengler, however, explicitly rejects human freedom  as a guiding force in history. He claims, in effect, to have discovered the  system of “the cunning of reason.” Those who know the system will have a  competitive advantage over those who do not. This peculiar “freedom” thus  claims competitive advantage, motivation, and rhetorical leverage for those  who pursue it. History, in Spengler’s morphological conception, is a force of  nature to which humans must relate in much the same way as they relate to  death. And since the outcome is the same no matter what, Spengler advocates  an ethics of maximizing self-interest within the preset limits of history. Spengler, unlike other philosophers of history (and despite his claim to use  a comparative historical method), claims that European modernity offers an  </page> <page sequence="9"> Oswald Spengler’s Demonic History 95 ultimate historical standpoint. But the problem of retrospectivity is a prob- lem for all philosophies of history. For Kant, for example, the human Anlage  (“predisposition” as a universal-transcendental preset) cannot be known  unless it betrays itself in a historical sign. Such a sign allows the a priori of the  human Anlage to be determined, and on this basis the course of history can be  known (but not predicted in individual cases). Spengler, rather than looking  for a singular sign or event, claims to use a comparative method to discover  the underlying form of human nature in a comprehensive system of analo- gies between nature and all recorded histories. This approach is conditioned  by his lateness with respect to his own culture and other civilizations—and  by the sheer volume of cross-cultural data available in the early twentieth  century. Spengler’s relativist historicism includes non-European histories and  developing ethnographic ideas,9 but he aims to produce a monolithic idea of  History. By pretending to use the taxonomic and tabulative methods of the  natural sciences, his idea of the human Anlage reflects the natural diversity  of human fauna as reflected in the variety of human history and culture.  He produces parallel analogical currents to show consistent direction and  development—but the story always ends with decline. To the extent one can  speak of a moral to the story, it emerges from a fabric of historical paral- lels, which are totalized into a supposedly inescapable pattern. The scope  of this systematization is apparent in Spengler’s tabulation of the “simul- taneous” epochs of art and spirit (UdA 71–72), which break down various  historical cultures according to rubrics such as “Spring, Summer, Fall, and  Winter” and “Prehistory, Culture, Civilization.” Spengler claims that these  analogical patterns, which are presented as evidence of an inescapable cosmic  destiny, are the result of inductive analysis, but his approach is transparently  deductive. Spengler insists that his non-Eurocentric approach represents a “Coper- nican” revolution in the concept of history (UdA 24), but his terminology  is conventional. His system is a hyper-historicism that imagines the devel- opment of man in a multiplicity of possibilities that are inevitably defined  by death and decline. “Culture” blossoms into unique symbolic forms that  define the historical identity of a people, but once these forms are fully articu- lated, there is (as Goethe said to Eckermann) “nothing left to do,” and “old”  civilizations fall to the vitality of “young” cultures. Histories end in civiliza- tion, and civilization is defined by empty repetition, expansion, and eventual  self-destruction. Artistically epigonal and politically imperialist, civilizations  assert themselves mechanically until they collapse under the imbalance of  internal and external forces. The developmental paradigm that Spengler attempts to establish in cross- cultural and comparative historical analogies is at best debatable and at worst  disingenuous. The length of his book is the result of the overstated ambition  of its central thesis, which is relentlessly recuperated in more than a thousand  pages. This fundamental imbalance between Spengler’s thesis and its proof  </page> <page sequence="10"> 96 The Unhappy Endings of Morphology causes the latter to outweigh the former. This overabundance of material  is only supportable to the extent his specific narratives and interpretations  offer something different from his repetitive metanarratives. Also, because  the theory, though influential, has been the object of decisive refutations,10 I  will now turn my attention to the methodological sections of part 1 of The  Decline of the West, in which the demonic often merely amplifies the pathos  of the conception. At the same time, however, key elements of Goethe’s more  systematic articulations are implicitly retained. Fate in Spengler’s Morphology of History The “morphological” basis of Spengler’s fatalistic philosophy of history  grants a specific access to the problem of mortality and finitude. I take this  partly from Adorno, who implies that Spengler was a lesser, more pop- philosophical Heidegger.11 For Adorno, Spengler was the better Heidegger,  precisely because he was a more transparent historical symptom, and his  motivations were more transparent and taken less seriously by professional  philosophers. The coauthor of The Dialectic of Enlightenment does not treat  Spengler as a taboo figure because he is a symptom of Enlightenment’s regres- sive possibilities. One might even argue that Spengler, Heidegger, and Adorno  himself tried to historicize the drawbacks of instrumental reason and positiv- ism in the absence of metaphysics. Thus in Spengler’s sense, all three may be  seen as “substitutable” (vertretbar) at the level of functional equivalence. To  be clear, the point of this substitution is not guilt by association, but rather,  following Adorno, to read Spengler in the context of recognized problems of  modernity. In this context, Goethe’s idea of morphology gives voice and authority to  Spengler’s prototypically anti-rationalist discourse. Like Gundolf, Spengler  reads Goethe neither as a philologist nor as a critic—not as any kind of  professional—but as a disciple. Spengler presents himself as a mouthpiece,  identifying himself with Goethe so intensely as to eliminate critical distance.  Goethe’s words, which often lack quotation marks or a reference to their  source, only say what Spengler thinks. His use of Goethe is often clearly  deceptive or wrong—but he may be a deceived deceiver. And even if mor- phology is only a legitimating discourse for ends that are both highly suspect  and completely conventional, Spengler’s ability to ventriloquize Goethe may  also be a precondition for his work’s strange persuasiveness and popular  success. When it comes to specific differences between Spengler and Goethe, the  question of morphology and “fate” is answered very differently. Spengler,  like Gundolf, would see his difference with Goethe on this account not as a  mistake on his part but as the result of the changed perspectives of the new  century. This historical difference in turn depends on morphology’s inherent  </page> <page sequence="11"> Oswald Spengler’s Demonic History 97 ambiguity with respect to questions of “optimism” or “pessimism.” Goethe’s  morphology does not emphasize decline, mortality, and death but instead  implicitly focuses on birth and rebirth. Spengler, on the other hand, absolu- tizes mortality in the discrete finitude of cultural monads. This combination  of mortality and relativism may also recall Herder (one of Goethe’s most  important sources).12 Spengler’s morphology might also be taken as a variant  of Nietzsche’s idea of eternal return, except that Spengler’s exposed “de-”  prefixes (unter prefixes in German) such as de-mise or de-cline conspicuously  replace Nietzsche’s trans- and super- (über-) compounds. Such comparisons, when articulated, make Spengler’s shortcomings clear.  But without such differentiations, his theory appears close enough to Goethe  and to other philosophies of history to produce borrowed plausibility. Spen- gler lends authority to assertive theorizations by claiming inspiration from  Goethe, Nietzsche, and others. Nietzsche is a possible source of Spengler’s  thesis that it is characteristic of the West to think historically and imagine  itself upon a historical stage. He claims that the modern Occident is uniquely  possessed of an acute awareness of time and history that is only haphaz- ardly articulated in other cultures. Spengler’s own system is presented as the  culmination of this awareness. The Decline of the West proclaims itself a  comprehensive and objective science that will allow “the form” of world his- tory to be “known” (UdA 21). The analogical deep structure of all known history is supposed to allow  accurate predictions, but this aspect of Spengler’s method is more than a  little contradictory. His conception is split between “future” and “fate.”13 He  claims that his methods are retrospective and inductive—and that the fate he  predicts is unavoidable—but this does not stop him from invoking an ideal of  futurity which, by his argument, should not exist. He wants to do more than  impotently confirm the inevitable; thus he predicts inevitable decline in order  to incite individuals to action—but he avoids the activist model of an “incon- venient truth” (which invokes a looming “fate” in order to avert it). Spengler  paradoxically combines extreme fatalism with activism: decline is unavoid- able, but the dominant affect of his book is not resignation but passion. The  latter is expressed above all in the prophetic status he attributes to his own  work. The Decline of the West will give rise to a “philosophy of the future”  (UdA 6), a philosophy that depends on the certainty of decline. The case is  terminal, death is inevitable, but this knowledge is, for Spengler, the basis  for rational action: culture’s fall into civilization (and subsequent collapse)  cannot be avoided, but individuals, including individual nations, can choose  their own roles. The idea of “substitutability” (Vertretbarkeit) means that,  though the big picture cannot be changed, knowledge of it will give a com- parative advantage in competition with others. In this phase of the argument,  Spengler’s “philosophy of the future” emerges as esoteric opportunism— hedonism and nationalism—more focused on going down heroically14 than  on resisting the inevitable. Spengler’s relativist method is thus negated by his  </page> <page sequence="12"> 98 The Unhappy Endings of Morphology chauvinist conclusion that, though the fate is unavoidable, the knowledge  of it will help Germany to assume a leading role in the West’s final march  toward the abyss. Thus Spengler—following a critique that can be traced  from Hermann Heller to Adorno and beyond—gives a theoretical alibi to the  practice of domination. Spengler acts as if acceptance of his oracle necessarily means accepting  his interpretation of it. But it may be, as Adorno implies, that the relation of  the prophecy to Spengler’s politics and ethics is not coherent. The political  message of The Decline of the West can be easily set aside. Without denying  that Spengler’s message may do damage through those who seek the ratio- nale he provides, his theory’s politics was not essentially more convincing in  the 1910s and 1920s than it is today. He believed that human and historical  possibilities could be rethought on the basis of morphological “knowledge,”  and this idea, combined with his pessimism, certainly resonated in his time,  but it presumably mostly did so in ways that reinforced existing behaviors  and opinions. Thus I would claim that nothing revolutionary came from Spengler, either  in opposition to his thesis or through attempts to follow it. But much may  have been activated and channeled through his work, and if a systematic  point is to be rescued here, it pertains to the role that Spengler assigned to his  own theoretical claims. The implicit dynamics are similar to those of the “end  of man” thesis from Foucault’s The Order of Things: in claiming the ability to  perceive the approaching end of a specific, deterministically conceived epis- temic constellation, the episteme in question—ultimately the present one—is  made visible, as if from the outside, and thereby implicitly destabilized. Or,  the other way around, such an “end” is performatively pronounced in the  hope of producing the described epistemic break. The inherent contradiction  between these two options is a productive one: it rests upon the performative  bracketing of epistemic determinants, which, assuming they exist at all, may  continue to do their own thing in spite of every attempt to distance them into  a hypothetical “meta.”15 Such exercises in speculative defamiliarization may have a momentum of  their own, even in a case such as Spengler’s. The perspectives introduced in  the juxtaposition of Spengler and Foucault make it possible to define mor- phology in a way that is at once more general and more precise: morphology  is the “science,” after the end of philosophy, of accurately reading the clock  of history—or of persuasively claiming to do so. This kind of speculation is  never purely theoretical; there is always an oracular implication. Morphol- ogy in this sense is the art of timeliness—the pseudoscience of claiming to  know what is auspicious. This function would traditionally fall to artists  and writers, rhetoricians and politicians, but Spengler’s idea is to try to for- malize it and put his insight at everyone’s disposal. Science is only a veneer,  however—and Spengler in any case denies that morphology is a modern  (positivist) science. The art of morphology can only be informal divinatory  </page> <page sequence="13"> Oswald Spengler’s Demonic History 99 cultural analysis based on intuition, which may produce—with the help of  good luck and eloquence—the appearance of success. To put it in the terms of the demonic in Goethe’s Poetry and Truth: even  in very small events, the difference between chance and agency often can- not be resolved, and the final grounds of even one timely occurrence or act  often cannot be recounted in a way that would control for all variables. Thus  by Goethe’s standard, Spengler’s claims for historical morphology are either  mistaken or disingenuous. But the question of the basis and motivation of  action has precedents in the demonic: knowledge and desire influence action,  and can be used to influence them. This much is a commonplace, but the  demonic, for Goethe, exerts itself through impossibility, through the blockage  and obstruction of knowledge and desire, and he posits that this is the typical  situation of historical actors most of the time. Perhaps Spengler understood  this action theory well enough to try to manipulate his readers at the level  of knowledge and desire, despite the fact that the schematics of his theory  can be read as contradicting it. What Spengler appears to believe—what his  theory extensively shows—is that the era of the blossoming of culture and  art is over for the West; the noxious forms of “civilization”—empire and  expansion, money and bureaucracy—will henceforth be the rule. The clock  cannot be turned back. Spengler thus passes himself off as a futurist and not  a conservative, but his “philosophy of the future” remains conservative in its  claim to differentiate the possible from the impossible in order to pick the  morphologically preordained winners. And the assumption that the possible  is intrinsically more desirable than the impossible is psychologically naive  compared with Goethe’s conception. Inescapability with respect to the spirit of the age is “demonic” for Spengler,  and the capitalist industrialist Cecil Rhodes is the emblem of the possibili- ties that remain in modernity. But the lure of the demonic impossibility in  Goethe’s sense may also have been cast by this thesis. Spengler overtly politi- cizes his own theory, but its fatalism can be interpreted differently—against  the spirit of the modern age, which Spengler himself depicts as odious. His  work’s ambivalent “futurism” must have been discarded or modified by all  but the most docile readers, whereas his analysis of history and modernity  could have energized opposition (from right or left) to “modern civiliza- tion.”16 His bleak outlook on the modern world is ultimately more persuasive  than his political agenda. The “fate” he perceives may be written in stone, but  it remains open to interpretation and the correlated freedom of action. The  provisional acceptance of Spengler’s “fate,” rather than producing fatalism or  resignation, can just as easily produce unexpected forms of inspiration. Wor- ried that readers will get the wrong message, Spengler emphasizes the futility  of striving against fate. Resistance, he claims, only leads to the repetition of  the exhausted possibilities of past eras. The epigonal strivings of modern  artists are condemned as inauthentic and eclectic, classicist and romantic,  yearning for a state of past wholeness. Ironically, this is what Schiller meant  </page> <page sequence="14"> 100 The Unhappy Endings of Morphology by the word “sentimental” more than a century earlier.17 Spengler’s dismissal  of all attempts to go against the spirit of one’s own age—even though these  efforts are themselves inevitable—raises the question: is Spengler’s idea of  fate adequately paradoxical? The foreknowledge of fate can produce action,  despair, or acceptance. If a fate is truly a fate, then the attempt to thwart  it only helps bring it about. Spengler’s brand of fatalism—of collaborating  with fate—thus exhibits a lack of irony with respect to the possible reac- tions to “impossibility.” This lack of irony about his work’s utility subjects  Spengler himself to a dramatic irony that makes his work appear primarily  autobiographical. The Decline of the West produces an unintentional self- caricature: Spengler casts himself as “a prophet of gloom and doom,” and  his performance in this role undoubtedly contributed to his book’s popular- ity. Later authors of pop philosophy, pseudoscience, and punditry perceived  the marketing strategy. Successful popularization did not completely cancel  out Decline’s specific claims and messages, but it made it into a vehicle of  divergent motivations that cannot be reduced to a single ideology or line of  reception.18 Demons of Warp and Weft (Goethe in Spengler) I see no reason to doubt the words of the foreword to Decline’s 1922 repub- lication: “I take my method from Goethe and my questions from Nietzsche”  (UdA IX). “Method” here certainly refers to “morphology,” following  Decline’s subtitle, “Outline of a Morphology of World History.” As I have  shown, Spengler’s morphology drastically departs from Goethe’s—but this  does not mean that it has no basis in Goethe. And, setting aside theoretical  systematics, Goethe’s sheer ubiquity in Spengler is astonishing. The name  undoubtedly occurs with more frequency than any other; citations and allu- sions also abound. In addition, “the Faustian” (das Faustische, adjective  faustisch) characterizes the modern Occidental epoch; this equation of the  Faustian and the “modern,” though not entirely unprecedented, is extreme in  its scope and systematic intention.19 Goethe’s ubiquity in itself does not mean much. Spengler’s appropriations,  in the language of his own theory, are cases of “pseudomorphosis”—a form  of appropriation that syncretically distorts what it appropriates to fit its own  terms.20 Like Gundolf, who skews Goethe’s morphology toward “fate” by an  overemphasis of the Orphic Dämon, Spengler dismantles Goethe’s architec- ture and puts the various concepts contained by the demonic to his own uses.  Goethe viewed the demonic as a private (sub-conceptual) and only indirectly  communicable medium of reflection, whereas Spengler makes it a part of his  universal morpho-history. He implicitly recognizes the not fully rationalizable  and communicable aspects, but this does not stop him from schematically  reducing Goethe’s conception. For Goethe, Urworte and aperçus allow  </page> <page sequence="15"> Oswald Spengler’s Demonic History 101 countless individual understandings and half communications, which may  produce illuminating effects in private conversation, but the demonic is not a  fixed system, structure, or terminology. It is a semi-medium for talking about  the ineffable. Spengler was aware of this unsystematic, dialogical aspect,21  but he uses it in the service of his most extravagant claims—for example,  that Goethe was the Socrates of our era, whereas Kant is our Aristotle. This  is typical of Spengler’s use of historical typologies that often prefer place- ment in a framework over specificity. He sees himself as an inheritor of the  intuitive, uninstitutionalized philosophies of Socrates and Goethe (UdA 68),  but, contradicting this rejection of logic and systematics, his own theory is  hyper-schematic. In Spengler’s system of historical epistemes, Goethe’s way of writing about  the demonic might be categorized as an example of the “magical” un- or anti- form of the arabesque, an indefinite spiraling figure that Spengler associates  with the imageless relation of text and script in early Christian and Islamic  culture. For Spengler, however, the demonic corresponds to a “Faustian” idea  of the infinite—of the effortful striving of the individual Dämon against the  limits of time, knowledge, and mortality. This drive manifests itself in the  unachievable will to freeze, close off, grasp, and represent infinite “becom- ing” (Werden) in a single moment. This conception evokes key lines of Faust  I and Faust II (HA 3:57, 3:348), but Spengler never reflects on the potential  problems of basing his theory of modernity on a character in a literary work,  who is further identified with Goethe’s own beliefs and ideas.22 In Spengler’s typology of cultural styles and characteristics, Goethe may  belong to more than one category, whereas Spengler, despite identifying with  Goethe, strives to be as Faustian as possible in his theorization of the West’s  inevitable end. The words of the Earth-spirit (Erdgeist) to Faust apply to  Spengler’s reading of Goethe: “You are like the spirit that you can grasp, but  not like me” (Du gleichst dem Geist, den du begreifst, nicht mir, HA 3:24).  Spengler sees Goethe as purely “Faustian,” “Western,” and “modern” and  views his own “morphology” as an equally Occidental product. Self-critical  potentials that might have emerged from Goethe are thus repressed in the  interest of Decline’s central dogmas. Goethe is the avowed source of Spengler’s mythology of the “Faustian,”  but this is relatively unrelated to Spengler’s theory; “Goethe” merely swirls  arabesque-like in the background. A methodological centerpiece can be located,  however, in section 9 of the introduction (Intro. 9) and in the parallel section  (I.ii.19) from the second long chapter of Decline’s first part, entitled “The  Problem of World History”;23 section I.ii.19 is part of this chapter’s second  half, subtitled “The Idea of Fate and the Principle of Causality” (“Schicksals- idee und Kausalitätsprinzip”). Another signpost unites Intro.9 and I.ii.19: the  Dämon stanza of the Orphic “Urworte” (UdA 35, 206); Intro. 9 only cites  “characteristic form, living and self-developing” (geprägte Form, die lebend  sich entwickelt, UdA 35), whereas I.ii.19 quotes the stanza at greater length. </page> <page sequence="16"> 102 The Unhappy Endings of Morphology This double invocation of Goethe’s Dämon as the source of Spengler’s  idea of developmental entelechy localizes the demonic in Decline’s method- ological sections.24 In Intro. 9, Spengler criticizes the causal-narrative and  Euro-anthropocentric biases of nineteenth-century conceptions of history.  He opposes their approach to his own “Copernican” attempt to show the  “natural form” (Gestalt) of “the total happening of the world” (das Weltge- schehen); the epistemic object of morphology “resid[es] within the depths,”  in deep structures that become “evident to the unprejudiced gaze” (UdA  34). Spengler’s morphology is declaredly “developmental” and diachronic,  but it is not concerned with the “substitutable” epiphenomena of events,  which are contingent in comparison to the “total happening of the world.”  Spengler’s “seasonal” schema for historical development further structures  and organizes time in a way that spatially conceives historical individuals— including individual cultures—as substitutable elements in a grid. Both the  outcome—the “fate”—and the development that produces it are static and  fixed. History is divided up in analogy with the natural life cycle or the ages  of man: “youth, ascent, blossoming, and decline” (Jugend, Aufstieg, Blütezeit,  Verfall, UdA 36). This sequence reflects temporal progression, which Spen- gler recognizes as metaphorical, but argues that his concrete application of it  will transform it into a strict terminology (UdA 36). This categorical impulse  conceives time timelessly and maps the form of finite biological individuality  onto history and culture, which are perceived as comparably regular, predict- able, and finite. In Spengler, the individuality of geprägte Form is conceived as a state  of endless transfer to and from suprapersonal symbolic forms that delimit  cultural monads in contrast to one another. Individuals realize the devel- opment of cultural totalities, the individuality of which expresses itself  through individuals. This approach presupposes the morphological iden- tity of individual and totality without dialectical mediation. The result is an  aesthetization of world history (which is reduced to the history of cultural  formations), and the comparative history of cultural forms is magnified into  universal history.25 The basis and result of this broad synthesis is the pre- supposition of parallelism in all spheres of a given culture: art, architecture,  custom, society, government, and even the forms of language, math, and sci- ence all correspond to the same underlying symbolic-archetypal-epistemic  paradigm.26 “I recall Goethe” (UdA 35). This evocative sentence from Intro. 9 does  not lead one to expect a systematic methodology, and what follows is in fact  a whirlwind of paraphrases and allusions. Wilhelm Meister is the only work  referred to by name, but it apparently stands for the idea of the Bildungsro- man. Spengler claims that Goethe “always, constantly, drew out the life, the  development, of his figures, their becoming and not their being” (UdA 35). This  introduces the opposition between “becoming” (Werden) and “that which  has finished becoming” (das Gewordene), which is a persistent systematic  </page> <page sequence="17"> Oswald Spengler’s Demonic History 103 differentiation in part 1 of the Decline, in which Spengler uses the idea of  developmental Werden as a weapon against positivist historiography’s exclu- sive focus on facts and causation. Spengler claims that the representation of  becoming—of organic development (Entwicklung) as opposed to “process”  (UdA 203)—is the specific characteristic of Occidental art and of the modern  episteme: whereas the art of antiquity (supposedly) valued the Apollonian  beauty of closed forms, Faustian art autobiographically, self-referentially, and  symbolically depicts the development out of which the work emerged. Like  Goethe in his comments on the debate between Cuvier and Saint-Hilaire,  Spengler prefers organological development to “construction”: Here [in Goethe] the world as mechanism did not stand in opposition  to the world as organism, nor did he oppose dead and living nature,  nor law [Gesetz] and form [Gestalt]. Every line he wrote as a natural  scientist was meant to illustrate the shape of things in transformation  [sollte die Gestalt des Werdenden vor Augen Stellen], to illuminate  “characteristic form, living, self-developing” [geprägte Form, die leb- end sich entwickelt]. (UdA 35) In a quasi-Pauline language, Spengler sets the future above the past, devel- oping form over fixed law, the living over the dead—but his own theory posits  development in terms of an iron law: Decline tells the story of inevitable rise  and fall in the exhaustion of cultural paradigms and characteristic forms.  Goethe’s geprägte Form, die lebend sich entwickelt, however, makes no such  claims. Insofar as Spengler’s invocation of geprägte Form contradicts both  Goethe and Spengler’s own theory, it would appear to be primarily rhetorical.  There is, however, an additional systematic claim, according to which the mor- phological “demon” becomes a figure of typology. The type in Spengler’s sense  (das Typische, UdA 36) does not correspond to Dämon (as individuality) but  to Goethe’s fourth Urwort: reductive-generalizing Ananke who overshadows  “life” with the narrative closures that are typically necessary. Spengler intro- duces this generalizing moment together with his idea of contingency (Tyche)  as “substitutability” (Vertretbarkeit). Tyche with her “fickle fortunes” (wech- selnden Geschicke, UdA 36) is mere contingency; she is that which could have  happened differently without making an essential difference. Spengler, as he  says, seeks “the necessary in the unruly surplus of the contingent [das Not- wendige in der unbändigen Fülle des Zufälligen]” (UdA 36). Thus an idea of development that purportedly comes from Goethe is  made synonymous with Spengler’s idea of fate. The “tychical” surplus that  manifests itself in the time of development only adds aesthetic value and the  appearance of singularity to the typical fate that necessarily befalls all life: And just as he [Goethe] traced the development of the form of the  plant from the leaf, as well as the rise of the vertebrate type, and   </page> <page sequence="18"> 104 The Unhappy Endings of Morphology the transformations of geological layers—the fate of nature, not  its causality [das Schicksal der Natur, nicht ihre Kausalität]—I will  likewise trace the language of forms in human history [die For- mensprache der menschlichen Geschichte], their periodic structure,  their organic logic, which develops out of the abundance of sensible  details. (UdA 35) Spengler wants to “develop” his system in analogy with Goethe’s “devel- opment” of the forms of nature (so wie . . . soll hier). He thus circularly  supposes the form of development both in his object (human history) and  in his own method (which will proceed by developing). “Just like” Goethe  who hypothesized that “everything is leaf” (Alles ist Blatt), Spengler sees a  universal form underlying all development. Just as the leaf is supposed as  the base unit of the plant, and the plant is “pure leaf” in transformation, so  human development and history are also supposed to display “organic logic”  and cyclical periodicity. However, as in Goethe’s morphology, differences of scale and time scale  as well as the perspectival variability of historical beginnings and endings  impede the application of this method to human society, culture, and history.  Kant and Nietzsche, Weber and Foucault, Koselleck and Blumenberg, all take  this kind of question seriously: How can a philosophy of history identify with  certainty the singular beginnings of “cycles” or epochs? How can the cycli- cal vs. developmental forms be unambiguously determined? What motivates  and necessitates historical cycles? How does this conception relate to history  conceived in layers, as a web or fabric? Are these only metaphors, and if  so, can one choose between them? Is the recourse to metaphor an index of  human intents and anthropocentric perspectives? In light of such questions,  Spengler’s shortcomings are evident—but that does not mean that his work  can entirely ignore these considerations. His preference for thetic overstatement and exaggerated univocality thus  produces rhetorical benefits at the expense of internal coherence. Self-critique  is not Spengler’s style, but this does not stop him from aggressively attacking  ideas he opposes. He argues, for example, that his morpho-developmental  idea of history avoids the misconceptions of words like “process,” “causa- tion,” and “motivation.” This critique is brought to bear against Marx and  Darwin, who only perceive causation in the lowest terms of sheer material  survival, “hunger and love” (UdA 202–4). Against this, Spengler points to  the varied forms of human culture, which reflect a morpho-anthropological  base comprised of complex form-drives. The mechanisms of these drives  are morphologically determined fates that express themselves through the  “inner certitude” (innere Gewissheit) of individuals (UdA 198). This “feel- ing” (Gefühl, UdA 201) corresponds to a talent for the forms through which  individual and collective destinies come to fruition. According to this model,  individuals and cultures are possessed by predetermined culminations. The  </page> <page sequence="19"> Oswald Spengler’s Demonic History 105 “inner certitude” of being in touch with one’s self and one’s time is felt in  individual experience and “demonically” dictated in view of collective ends: Whoever lives in streaming ardor [in strömendem Überschwang]  toward an unknown “something” [einem Etwas] does not need to  know anything about purpose or usefulness [von Zweck und Nut- zen]. He feels himself as the meaning of that which will happen [als  Sinn dessen, was geschehen wird]. This was the belief in the star,  which never forsook Caesar and Napoleon as little as it did other  doers of great deeds [die großen Täter anderer Art]. (UdA 199) Ironically, the more the individual experiences itself as an end in itself, the  more it is instrumentalized—the more it falls under the “demonic” control  of “the total happening of the world.” The subjective feeling of demonic  self-certainty is the medium through which morphologically predetermined  forms and cosmic patterns are realized through (not by) geniuses, heroes, and  leaders and dictators.27 The preestablished harmony of morphological reason (which reads all  actions within a given cultural paradigm as symbolic and productive of that  paradigm) combined with Spengler’s refusal of the principle of sufficient rea- son (which is blind to “the mystery of becoming” [UdA 203]), more than  earns him his reputation as an irrationalist. He is also not alone in this, how- ever: elements of his “irrationalism” are common to much more reputable  conceptions.28 Pointing this out does not mean rehabilitating Spengler—nor  is it an attempt to discredit others by associating them with him. Rather,  the idea is to establish a fine line between Spengler and the many others  who have offered critiques of instrumental reason. Instead of posing his- torical causation as a problem, he exploits its fragility through a tendentious  “theory,” whose greatest harm—and asset—may be that it reveals the risks  associated with the critique of reason. Spengler is, however, occasionally more than just a negative example of  the risks inherent to the twentieth century’s attempts to come to terms with  positivism and rationalization. Other possibilities emerge whenever Spengler  fails to reproduce his main thesis and unintentionally allows “tychic” sur- pluses to emerge. This occurs, for example, in a passage on Michelangelo,  whom Spengler imagines standing before an unshaped block of marble. This  image, Spengler declares, expresses “the cosmic fear of that which has already  come into being [die Weltangst vor dem Gewordenen], the fear of death  that art seeks to banish [bannen] into a shifting form [durch eine bewegte  Form]” (UdA 354). This echoes Goethe’s “flight behind an image” (Flucht  hinter ein Bild, HA 10:176), and the identification of “that which has already  become” (das Gewordene) with death thus coherently reflects another aspect  of Goethe’s idea of the demonic: the refugee from “what has become (impos- sible)” flees into what might be and what might have been. </page> <page sequence="20"> 106 The Unhappy Endings of Morphology Here, in opposition to Spengler’s main thesis, art’s attempt to banish  “what was” is conceived as an allegory of the overcoming of death. Art reani- mates the dead positivity of an ended historical world. “Morphology” in this  sense differs significantly from Spengler’s official understanding. The latter  urges an attitude of amor fati with respect to decline, whereas the confronta- tion of artist and raw material is poised between metamorphosis (rebirth)  and finitude (death). This is the demonic uncertainty that provokes a flight  into images. Such a flight may not permanently solve or even stabilize the  underlying crisis, but the uncut stone reflects sheer potentiality and a lack of  predetermination. Spengler here recognizes the ambivalence of the demonic,  which implicitly contradicts his schematic version of morphology. Art’s  transformative drive to sublimate death corresponds to Spengler’s theoretical  instrumentalization of death, but whereas Spengler presents a one-way street,  Michelangelo’s artistic-morphological decision reflects ongoing indetermi- nateness: the uncut stone stands for each individual’s attempt to symbolically  answer morphology’s life-or-death question of the possibility of future devel- opments. In Spengler’s theory, the dead facticity of the uncut stone is all that  matters,29 whereas Michelangelo’s “demonic” nature constantly sought to  shape the dead matter of the past (UdA 354). The demonic character in this  sense is not possessed by a morphologically preordained fate or a feeling of  “inner certitude,” but by an inner conflict generated by the attempt to come  to terms with the demonic (in Goethe’s sense) as a placeholder for death  and the unknown—for the questions to which religion and philosophy have  perennially sought answers. The Michelangelo sentence reflects an accurate understanding that can be  traced to Goethe; it also shows that the appearance of a “demonic charac- ter” is the by-product of a given character’s confrontation with the demonic  ambiguity of morphology’s lowest terms, which push toward forms of subli- mation and overcoming that are declared impossible in Spengler’s philosophy  of history. This may be only a small lapse, an instance of evidence that sub- tly undercuts the argument it is meant to support, but it is not difficult to  find larger systematic contradictions, motivated by the evident obstacles to  interpreting history as pure morpho-demonic fate. In particular, Spengler’s  strict historicism contradicts his meta-history: he is forced to admit that there  is not always a direct connection between the personal and the supraper- sonal, between the individual Dämon and the demonic force of morphology.  Demonic historicism is thus supplemented by a theory of pseudomorphosis  that supposes the existence of cross-cultural influences capable of obstructing  the pure development of cultural monads; individuals can likewise interfere  with their own development if they strive to produce forms that are not  proper to their own culture and demonically dictated episteme. “Non-demonic” impersonal, intrapersonal, or trans-historical epistemic  cross-currents may be relegated to the status of contingencies, but they can- not be completely denied. Thus at the end of I.ii.19, Spengler presents a kind  </page> <page sequence="21"> Oswald Spengler’s Demonic History 107 of secularization thesis based on Goethe’s idea of the demonic from book 20  of Poetry and Truth: In the [modern] reality [Wirklichkeit] of conscious being [des wachen  Daseins], two worlds are woven together, that of observation [Beobach- tung = the modern way of distanced seeing] and that of abandonment  [Hingebung = the original experience of life as pure unprecedented  happening], just as in a Brabant tapestry warp and weft come together  to “knit” [wirken] the image. In order to be available [vorhanden] to  understanding in any way, every law must have once been discov- ered—and that means experienced [erlebt]—within the history of  spirit [Geistesgeschichte] as something that was brought about by fate  [eine Schicksalsfügung]. Every fate appears in a sensible costume—per- sons, deeds, scenes, gestures—through which natural laws are at work  [am Werke]. The life of primitive man was abandoned to the demonic  unity of fate [die dämonische Einheit des Schicksalhaften], but in the  consciousness of individuals in mature cultures [im Bewußtsein reifer  Kulturmenschen], the contradiction [der Widerspruch] between this  early and their own late image of the world [jenes frühen und dieses  späten Weltbildes] can never be silenced. (UdA 207) This passage contrasts the modern perspective of retrospectivity, which  includes Spengler’s own morphological vision, with the “demonic” omni- presence and intensity of reality for pre-cultural man.30 Spengler opposes a  primitive state characterized by “certainty” and “unity” to a developed state  characterized by consciousness and doubt. The self-doubt expresses itself, at  least partly, in modernity’s inability to authentically identify with its fate in  the way that primitive man supposedly did. In the context of fate, the loom metaphor may seem predictable, but there  are no Norns or Parcae here, only a fixed fabric that presumably bears an  image—of the world. This figure of a world image (Weltbild) defined by  ambivalence implicitly cites Poetry and Truth’s reflections on the demonic.  The wovenness of the image stands for a perpetual effect of perceptual ambi- guity, defined by the retrospective idealization of primitive life and, on the  other hand, by the realization that the “rational” modern era is ruled by  fates that are already finished. Out of this split between absent primal unity  and the awareness of an established rational world order (to which one is  subjected but with which one cannot identify), a woven image appears; its  unity is composite, artificial, figural, oscillating like a Vexierbild between an  imagined picture of the whole and the partially obstructed imagination of  oneself as a part of this same image. In Poetry and Truth, the loom image of “warp and weft” (Zettel und Ein- schlag, Spengler’s Kette und Einschlag) configures the irreducibility of the  demonic in every conceivable world order: </page> <page sequence="22"> 108 The Unhappy Endings of Morphology Although this demonic [jenes Dämonische] can manifest itself in  everything that is corporeal and incorporeal [in allem Körperlichen  und Unkörperlichen]—and indeed expresses itself most notably in  animals—it nevertheless stands, above all, in the most astonishing  relationship [im wunderbarsten Zusammenhang] with man and   comprises a power [Macht] which, though not opposed [entgegen- gesetzt] to the moral order of the world [die moralische Weltordnung],  crosses through and cancels it [sie durchkreuzt] in a way that could  allow the one to count as the warp [Zettel] and the other as the weft  [Einschlag]. (HA 10:177) Unlike Spengler’s loom, Goethe—more like Max Weber’s “iron cage” (stahl- hartes Gehäuse)—depicts the ongoing relation of idea and realization,  predictability and unpredictability, rationality and irrationality, norm and  exception, in the (modern) world. What holds the extremes together and  brings them into focus is the idea of an interweaving or “crossing” of opposed  yet interlocking views, which join to “knit themselves into an image.” The  tapestry fuses perspectives which, taken separately, would either represent a  totally rationalized causality or a completely unreflected natural order. The  extremes belong to an omniscient God and, on the other hand, to animals.  Such limit-attitudes are inaccessible to Spengler’s “civilized” humans, who  experience this double perspective as a fabricated unity whose illusionary  quality, though perhaps occasionally evident in moments of unraveling, is  habitually overlooked.31 According to the logic of this metaphor, the per- ception of a morphologically predetermined fate can only be the result of  an artificial synthetic unity. The supposed “demonic” unity experienced by  primitive man, by contrast, only perceives itself as a fate and thereby de- realizes all other orders for as long as this perspective is intact. In humans,  this is a formula of megalomania: if I am a fate and I know it and I affirm it  (rather than questioning it), then I imagine that I am in no way subject to the  world because it is entirely subject to me. In Poetry and Truth, the demonic manifests itself as the appearance of  reason in beings (such as animals) or circumstances (such as coincidences)  that are either ambiguously devoid of reason or possessed by unknown rea- sons. For Goethe as for Spengler, individuals are regularly but unpredictably  confronted with such crossroads that force a decision between the fundamen- tally retrospective (and often unfulfillable) demands of sufficient reason and  the much more immediate competing claims of highly mobile reasons and  rationalizations. Thus, even if the “moral order of the world” (whether in a  theological or merely sociological sense)32 is in fact an airtight system—of  laws, determination, causes and effects, fates and providences—this is not the  aspect it shows to humans, who are left to interpret it ex post facto. Spengler  clearly prefers the attitude of subjection (Hingebung), of giving one’s self  uncritically to the force of one’s own representations, which are, according  </page> <page sequence="23"> Oswald Spengler’s Demonic History 109 to his theory, never really “one’s own” but are dictated by the morphologi- cal force of history. Retrospective critical reason, on the other hand, only  impedes us in being and becoming ourselves. Spengler thus envies “the life of  primitive man” for its “demonic unity,” its idealized primal ability, like that of  Napoleon or Caesar, to live its own representations—to just live life—free of  the reason and doubt (Sorge) that cloud the Faustian sense of self.33 This leads me, in conclusion, to suggest that the demonic, and not mor- phology, is the more essential Goethean inheritance in Spengler’s classic  meta-history. Decline flattens the idea of morphology to such an extent that  it only shares the name with Goethe’s conception. The latter, though avail- able to a dogmatic reading, was not itself doctrinaire, whereas the demonic  more obviously inflects Spengler’s sub-systematic thinking. Especially Tyche  is that which Spengler most seeks to eliminate or contain. Spengler’s partial  adoption of Goethe’s idea of demonically inspired character also produces an  exemplary mystification that he is unable to theoretically sustain. “Demonic”  heroes like Caesar or Cecil Rhodes are supposed to have a direct connection  with the universe (in keeping with Goethe’s motto Nemo contra deum nisi  deus ipse), but Spengler is forced to interpret them as epigones, as ideals of  pre-modern life. The psychology of the demonic character supposedly corre- sponds with the prehistoric unity of being, but this contradicts morphology’s  deterministic historicism. The word “demonic” in Spengler thus refers to the  sheer appearance of an undivided being, but, in drawing on Goethe’s concep- tion, it unintentionally introduces a problem of the optics through which  such “demonic” appearances are produced in the first place. Spengler tries  to suppress this problem, but his reflections on the demonic (and the related  idea of pseudomorphosis) reveal modernity’s divided, layered, historical— geschichtetes and geschichtliches—consciousness to be demonic (in its lack of  unity) and at the same time productive of the demonic (in idealized unities). To the extent that Goethe’s idea of the demonic is conceived as open and  endlessly theorizable in religions, philosophies, and individual lives, Spen- gler’s Decline qualifies as “one more” concept of the demonic, which further  reflects the antinomies and the sense of crisis that always lie behind the  demonic. These contradictions were growing during the nineteenth century,  while the will to harmonize them was diminishing.34 The popular and to  some extent enduring success of Spengler’s work lies not only in its expres- sion of an underlying crisis and the consolations it offers with respect to this  crisis—it also shows how the formulae, affects, and questions associated with  the demonic in Goethe’s “Urworte” and Poetry and Truth can be simultane- ously foundational and destabilizing for (pseudo)theoretical discourses. If,  as Blumenberg argues, the demonic marks a limit of theorizability, then it  also reflects the theoretical limitations and questionable sources of theoreti- cal power. </page> <page sequence="24">  </page> </plain_text>
