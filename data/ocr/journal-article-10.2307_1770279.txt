<plain_text><page sequence="1">CHARLES MARTINDALE Paradise Metamorphosed: Ovid in Milton O VID'S Metamorphoses was apparently Milton's favored Latin reading, at least in old age.' This choice might be felt an unex- pected one for the aging, blind Puritan poet, surrounded by the worldli- ness of Restoration England. But perhaps we might have expected it. Milton's favorite English poets were also Ovidians: Spenser, who put scenes from the Metarmorphoses to more sage and serious use, and Shakespeare, who had been regarded by contemporaries as a kind of Ovid redivivus-as Francis Meres put it: "As the soule of Euphorbus was thought to live in Pythagoras: so the sweete wittie soule of Ovid lives in mellifluous &amp; hony-tongued Shakespeare, witnes his Venus and Adonis, his Lucrece, his sugred Sonnets."2 Milton's passion for Ovid, which marks him as a true son of the En- glish Renaissance, might already have appeared old-fashioned in the 1 See Samuel Johnson, Lives of the English Poets, ed. G. B. Hill (Oxford, 1905), I, 154. Milton had shown an early interest in the Latin love elegists. More- over his own Latin style owes most to Ovid: see Douglas Bush's introduction to "The Latin and Greek Poems," in A Variorum Commentary on the Poems of John Milton, I (New York, 1970), 3-24; and Harding (see note 6), pp. 42-57. How- ever, too much must not be made of this, since Ovid, readily imitable where Virgil was not, provided a lingua franca for neo-Latin poets. For example, while Mar- vell's The Garden is Horatian-Metaphysical, the Latin version Hortus (which could be the original) is unlike Horace but fairly close to Ovid (I owe this ex- ample to Dr. J. H. Parker). 2 Palladis Tamia (London, 1598), p. 281 ff. The bulk of Shakespeare's Sonnets do not strike a modern reader as particularly Ovidian, even if Shakespeare fre- quently echoes Metamorphoses XV, together with Golding's version of it (see S. Lee, "Ovid and Shakespeare's Sonnets," Quarterly Review, 210 [1909], 455-76); Meres is perhaps thinking of very broad similarities of mood and style. For Ovid in the Sonnets see the index to J. B. Leishman, Themes and Variations in Shake- speare's Sonnets (London, 1961), s.v. "Ovid," p. 246. For Shakespeare and Ovid generally see T. W.

Dryden begins to shadow forth the new attitudes of a nascent neoclassicism. He partly modified an early enthusiasm for Ovid in favor of the supposed stylistic purity of more restrained authors, especially Virgil and Horace. In 1667 he had praised Ovid for "invention" and "fancy," and found his representation of female passion superior to Virgil's: "Ovid has touched those tender strokes more delicately than Virgil could." But by 1685 he was criticiz- ing Ovid's lack of "majesty" and metrical variety ("he is always ... upon the hand-gallop, and his verse runs upon carpet ground"), while in 1700, comparing Ovid with Chaucer, he was more severe: Ovid's conceits are "glittering trifles" that "in a serious poem .. . are nauseous, because they are unnatural." We may compare his changed attitude to du Bartas (another Miltonic and early seventeenth-century favorite) : I remember, when I was a boy, I thought inimitable Spenser a mean poet in com- parison of Sylvester's Dubartas; and was rapt into an ecstasy when I read these lines: Now, when the Winter's keener breath began To crystallize the Baltic Ocean; To glaze the lakes, to bridle up the floods, And periwig with snow the bald-pate woods. I am much deceived if this be not abominable fustian; that is, thoughts and words ill sorted, and without the least relation to each other.3 Today Milton's preference should appear less surprising, for a sense of Ovid's greatness and place in European culture is gradually being re- covered.4 Charles Tomlinson even makes Ovid a presiding genius of 3 See John Dryden, Of Dramatic Poesy and Other Critical Essays, ed. George Watson, 2 vols. (London and New York, 1962), I, 98-99 ("Account" prefixed to Annus Mirabilis) ; II, 22 (Preface to Sylv) ; II, 279 (Preface to Fables Ancient and Modern) ; I, 277 (Dedication to The Spanish Friar). It would, however, be wrong to force undue consistency on Dryden's vacillating critical pronouncements, and he certainly never wholly lost an admiration for Ovid, as the translations for the Fables show (see Rachel Trickett, The Honest Muse: A Study in Augustan Verse, Oxford, 1967, pp. 68, 73 ff., 77). For Dryden's translations of Ovid see William Frost, "Dryden's Versions of Ovid," Comparative Literature, 26 (1974), 193-202; and Charles Tomlinson, Poetry and Metamorphosis (Cambridge, 1983), pp. 1-22. 4 In fact Ovid has never lacked for critics. Quintilian, who rightly identified lascivia, a sort of playful exuberance or exuberant playfulness, as a key Ovidian characteristic, censured Ovid as "nimium amator ingenii sui" (Inst. Or. X.i.88) ; cf. Seneca the Elder, Controversiae II.ii.12. Likewise Ovid has always had his defenders; thus, despite the Victorian emphasis on "high seriousness," James Henry gives the palm among Latin poets to Ovid in some comments on Met. XV.603 ff., "qualia succinctis, ubi trux insibilat Eurus, / murmura pinetis fiunt": "Whoever has been in a pine wood will require no further comment on succincta, in its literal application to the female dress. A pine wood is indeed a wood of bare legs. Let no one say that Ovid is not a poet, or subscribe to Dryden's most unjust opinion of him. He was a more natural, more genial, more cordial, more imagina- tive, more playful poet not only than Dryden, but than our author (Virgil), or 302</page><page sequence="3">OVID IN MILTON literary Modernism, exploring his influence on Eliot and Pound. One of the most delicate and moving allusions to the Ovidian theme of meta- morphosis occurs at the end of Part I of Finnegan's Wake: "My foos won't moos. I feel as old as yonder elm ... My ho head halls. I feel as heavy as yonder stone." Joyce gives his washerwomen something of the tenderness that Ovid shows his Philemon and Baucis.5 This article will attempt to sketch some of the reasons that may have drawn Milton to Ovid, and to describe the nature of the Ovidian pres- ence in Paradise Lost.6 Some initial caveats are in order. First, it is important to remember that Milton's Ovid is not quite today's Ovid; the texts that Milton used differed in some respects from ours, and different emphases were laid in the Renaissance commentaries that he read, and in the way that Ovid was taught in school. Harding gives a small but instructive instance of what can be missed if this point is ignored. In Metamorphoses 11.2 the Palace of the Sun is described as "clara micante auro flammasque imitante pyropo" ("bright with sparkling gold and pyropum that imitates flames"). Pyropum probably signifies an alloy of gold and bronze, but in the Renaissance it was usually taken to mean "carbuncle." Milton, with Ovid in mind, men- tions carbuncle in his description of the Sun (PL 111.596). The tiny allusion passed unnoticed among commentators well versed in Ovid but unfamiliar with the Renaissance usage.7 A failure to differentiate the Renaissance from the modern Ovid vitiates Martz's otherwise attrac- tive treatment of Ovid and Milton in Poet of Exile, so that some of his observations are attended by a strong whiff of anachronism.8s For ex- ample, noting that modern critics have detected a slackening in the writing in the later books of the Metamorphoses, and also in Paradise Lost XI and XII, Martz suggests that Milton may deliberately be re- producing an Ovidian effect in the altered manner. But Martz does not stop to ask whether seventeenth-century readers shared the modern view of the closing four books of the Metamorphoses. Mirandula's pop- ular quotation book Illustrium Poetarum Flores, published many times in the Renaissance, is particularly rich in citations from Book XV, one any other Latin poet" (Aeneidea, or Critical, Exegetical, and Aesthetical Remarks on the Aeneis, I [London, 1873], 618). 5 Tomlinson, p. 7. 6 The fundamental study is D.

Likewise Dryden thought the lines on Pythagoras's philosophy in Metamorphoses XV "the most learned and beautiful" section of the poem.10 Martz also argues that the structure of the Meta- morphoses was imitated by Milton. He accepts the contentious and (in my view) implausible structural analyses of Brooks Otis in terms of balancing "panels," and finds analogies for these panels in Paradise Lost. However, it seems obvious that Paradise Lost recalls the epic structure (with its teleological implications) of the Aeneid, and not the fluid and episodic form (or perhaps rather non-form) of the anticlassi- cal Metamorphoses. In general Martz too readily assumes that Milton shared late twentieth-century American perceptions of Ovid. However, in avoiding the Scylla of anachronism, we must not sail into a Charybdis of crude historicism. Equally unconvincing would be the assumption that Renaissance responses to Ovid were restricted to the kinds of observation made in the commentaries. At a time when literary criticism was in its infancy, much that was felt would not find ready expression, or would find expression only in direct imitation. Thus Chaucer obviously understood Ovid's sly humor, despite the fact that medieval commentaries largely ignore this aspect of the Metamor- phoses, concentrating on moral and allegorical exegesis. Ovid was Chaucer's true master among the ancients; even when adapting the story of Dido and Aeneas out of Aeneid IV, Chaucer recalls the man- ner of Ovid. The royal pair take refuge in the cave, where their love is to be consummated, and Chaucer cheekily observes: She fledde hireself into a litel cave, And with hire wente this Eneas also. I not, with hem if there wente any mo; The autour maketh of it no mencioun.11 9 Mirandula also regularly cites passages from the early part of Metamorphoses (the Four Ages and the Creation), and from the various allegorical set pieces (the home of Sleep, etc.), as well as anything that can be used to make a moral point (e.g., some lines from the story of Baucis and Philemon are quoted under the heading De Concordia). The Flores thus point to a continuance of traditional preferences. 10 Headnotes from Fables Ancient and Modern, 1700. 11 The Legend of Good Women, lines 1225-28. For the two poets see J. M.

Hoffman, Ovid and the Canterbury Tales (London, 1966); and E. F. 304</page><page sequence="5">OVID IN MILTON Similarly Marlowe's understanding of Ovid, whether or not he could have articulated it in prose, is expressed in Hero and Leander. Sandys, while seldom enlarging on Ovid's wit in his commentary, can show a perfect appreciation of it in his translation. For example, for Ovid's jest about Jupiter's palace: Hic locus est; quem, si verbis audacia detur, Haud timeam magni dixisse Palatia caeli. (1.175-76) he gives : This glorious Roofe I would not doubt to call, Had I but boldnesse lent mee, Heaven's White-Hall.12 In the case of Milton, whose feeling for classical literature was clearly exceptional, it would be wrong to assume that his Ovid is merely the Ovid of the commentators. A second general difficulty is the problem of determining whether Ovid is the Source for particular passages in Paradise Lost. Many of the likely Ovidian allusions are to stories in the Metamorphoses, and most of these stories would have been familiar to Milton from other sources as well as from Ovid. In Book II at their games the devils tear up rocks and hills amid "wild uproar": As when Alcides from Oechalia crowned With conquest, felt the envenomed robe, and tore Through pain up by the roots Thessalian pines, And Lichas from the top of Oeta threw Into the Euboic sea."1 (542-46) Milton would have known the story of Hercules' death from the Trachiniae and the Hercules Oetaeus as well as from Ovid, and doubt- less numerous commentaries and handbooks. Certain verbal details, together with the fact that Ovid (unlike Sophocles and Seneca) places the scene in Thessaly, suggests that the Metamorphoses (IX.134 ff.) is the main source.14 Yet even if this is so, the passage is not especially Shannon, Chaucer and the Roman Poets, Harvard Studies in Comparative Litera- ture, 7 (Cambridge, Mass., 1929). 12 George Sandys, Ovid's Metamorphosis, Englished, Mythologiz'd and Repre- sented in Figures (Oxford, 1632), photographic reprint, ed. Stephen Orgel (New York and London, 1976) ; hereafter cited in the text. 13 All quotations from Milton are taken from the edition of John Carey and Alastair Fowler (London and Harlow, 1968). Ovid is cited from Heinsius's edition (Amsterdam, 1659), which differs in many respects (especially punctuation) from modern texts. 14 For the sources of the simile see Osgood, p. 41.

Tal- bert, Classical Myth and Legend in Renaissance Dictionaries: A Study of Renais- 305</page><page sequence="6">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE Ovidian in feeling. The baroque muscularity (to use Ricks's word) of the writing, in particular the separation of "tore" from "up" creating an effect of violent dislocation, and the dizzy pause that results from the placement of "threw" at the end of the line so that we can see the mo- ment when Lichas topples over the edge, recalls the epic manner of Virgil. Admittedly in his account of Hercules Ovid is naturally writing more "epically" than usual: in particular he imitates Virgil's emphatic positioning of verbs at the beginnings and ends of lines (adspicit, line 212; corripit, 217) and striking use of enjambment ("... terque quater- que rotatum / Mittit in Euboicas, tormento fortius, undas," 217-18). However, it was not primarily from Ovid that Milton learned such effects. Thirdly, we must be careful not to restrict Ovid's influence on Milton to supposed verbal "allusions" or imitations. The index to the Colum- bia edition of Milton gives a long list of these, some of them trivial (useful mainly as parallels) or implausible.15 For example PL 1.619 ff., "Thrice he essayed, and thrice in spite of scorn, / Tears such as angels weep, burst forth" is not an allusion to Metamorphoses XI.419, "Ter conata loqui, ter fletibus ora rigavit," but just an instance of a standard rhetorical organization commonly found in Latin poetry (naturally Milton's schoolboy studies of Ovid will have helped him to write readily in this way). Conversely an allusion may not be marked by close verbal similarity. There was nothing in the spare Biblical narrative of Genesis to help Milton when he set himself to describe Adam and Eve, and it seems that Ovid's Deucalion and Pyrrha, who recreate the human race after the Flood, came into his mind (in Book XI he directly compares the two couples). Ovid uses carefully balanced phrasing suggestive of the mutuality and mutual dignity of his lone man and woman (such an "echoic" manner is more characteristic of Ovid than, say, Virgil or Horace) : Et superesse videt de tot modo millibus unum, Et superesse videt de tot modo millibus unam; Innocuos ambos, cultores numinis ambos (Met. 1.325-27) sance Dictionaries in Their Relation to the Classical Learning of Contemporary English Writers, Chapel Hill, 1955, especially pp. 226-339.) Christopher Ricks ably defends the poetic syntax against the criticism of Donald Davie (Milton's Grand Style, Oxford, 1963, pp. 43-45). The application of the simile is uncertain. Hercules' frenzy is natural as an image of violent rage (as in Antony and Cleo- patra IV.xii.43-47), but curious in the context of the devils' pastimes, since the devils at play are not involved in the intensity of emotion portrayed in the human story. There thus seems a characteristic Miltonic contrast; but see Fowler's note ad loc. 15 See The Works of John Milton, ed. F. A. Patterson et al., 20 vols. (New York, 1931-40), Vol. II of Index, pp. 1409-11. 306</page><page sequence="7">OVID IN MILTON ("Jupiter sees that one man is left from so many thousands, that one woman is left from so many thousands, innocent both, worshippers of divinity both.") Milton employs comparable procedures throughout his initial descrip- tion of Adam and Eve: For contemplation he and valour formed, For softness she and sweet attractive grace, ... Adam the goodliest man of men since born His sons, the fairest of her daughters Eve. (IV.297-98, 323-24) The analogy is not noticed by editors, presumably because the lines contain no precise verbal imitation. The context within which Milton read the Metamorphoses may be briefly sketched."' Broadly, there were four aspects to the Renaissance Ovid, even four different Ovids, available for Milton's use. First, we have "moral" or "exemplary" Ovid: each Ovidian story could be read as pointing an improving moral. There was precedent for such an ap- proach in antiquity. In De Providentia V.9-11 Seneca uses the opening of the tale of Phaethon to illustrate a proper ardor for the challenges and difficulties of the virtuous life ("per alta virtus it," par. 11). This is an odd reading in view of the sequel, and the Renaissance more plausibly saw an exemplum of youthful folly and "ruining ambition" (Sandys, p. 66). Humanists, who emphasized the educational value of classical poetry, and the conjunction in it of the utile and the dulce, favored exemplary readings. Some doubted whether Ovid was the most suitable author for such purposes. Thomas Elyot, who moved in humanist circles, expressed his preference for Horace as an author for children: I would set next unto him [Virgil] two books of Ovid, the one called Metamor- phosis . .. the other is entitled De fastis ... : both right necessary for the under- standing of other poets. But because there is little other learning in them concern- ing either virtuous manners or policy, I suppose it were better that as fables and ceremonies happen to come in a lesson, it were declared abundantly by the master 16 For a bibliography of studies of Ovid's reception and influence see Aufstieg tnd Niedergang der r6mischen Welt, II, 31.4 (1981), 2214-45, 2254-63.

Wherefore in his place let us bring in Horace, in whom is contained much variety of learning and quickness of sentence.17 However, Raphael Regius, whose humanist edition of the Metamor- phoses, first published in Venice in 1492, was immensely popular throughout the sixteenth century, lent his authority to the moralizers, as in this passage from the Praefatio dedicated to Francesco Gonzaga (here translated by Sandys) : There is nothing appertaining to the knowledge and glorie of warre, whereof we have not famous examples in the Metamorphosis of OVID; (not to speake of stratagems, nor the Orations of Commanders) described with such efficacie and eloquence, that often in reading, you will imagine your selfe imbroiled in their conflicts. Neither shall you finde any Author, from whom, a civill life may gather better instructions. (Sandys, "Ovid Defended," n. pag.) For Regius the transformation of Lycaon into a wolf illustrates the penalties assigned to robbers, while the story of Daphne exemplifies the virtue of chastity and its rewards. Golding's translation of the Metamorphoses (1567), which nour- ished the imagination of an age, includes an Epistle and Preface which can largely be assigned to this tradition.s8 Golding defines the general use of his book thus: The use of this same booke therfore is this: that every man (Endevoring for to know himself as neerly as he can,) (As though he in a chariot sate well ordered,) should direct His mynd by reason in the way of vertue, and correct His feerce affections with the bit of temprance... (Epistle, lines 569-73) He offers exemplary readings of most of the stories, finding in them "pitthye, apt and playne / Instructions" (64-65) : for example, "Nar- cissus is of scornfulnesse and pryde a myrror cleere, / Where beawties fading vanitie most playnly may appeere" (105-06). It was how to understand the gods that caused Golding most trouble. In the Epistle he toys with the euhemeristic view whereby the gods are "noblemen, who for their vertues bee . .. canonized . . . by heathen men" (18-19). In the Preface they are interpreted as standing for different sorts of men, virtuous or vicious (lines 57 ff.). Golding also saw glimmerings of a deeper understanding. "Little seedes and sparkes of heavenly lyght" 17 The Book named The Governor, ed. S. E. Lehmberg (London, 1962), p. 32. 18 Quotations are from the edition of J. F. Nims (New York, 1965).

Although their writings "noth- ing may in worthinesse with holy writ compare" (Epistle, 334), yet they contain glimpses of the truth (306 ff.). Ovid may have read Gene- sis (338 ff.), and mystic senses can be assigned to some details: for example Prometheus in the Creation story may stand for the Word of God (453). Golding's occasional forays into Christian allegory bring us to the second Ovid, the allegorical Ovid, Ovide moralise, the Ovid of the High Middle Ages.1' In the exemplary approach each story as a whole yielded a moral, which was at least plausible and to some extent suited it. How- ever, in the tradition of the Ovide moralise multiple inconsistent read- ings were offered for each story, and also the details of the story were given allegorical significance, in a way that often quite lacks any super- ficial plausibility (the multiple allegories might include exemplary moral allegory of the kind already discussed). Two points should be underlined. First, the essential impulse was not a desire to bowdlerize unsuitable material, but rather to make Ovid relevant to contemporary concerns.20 Secondly, there were so many versions that there was no agreement about the meanings of the stories, and hence no readily avail- able fixed code of meanings for poets to exploit. It is rather a question of habits of mind. It is usually said that the Renaissance saw the de- velopment of a more historically aware attitude to the classics. There is much truth in this : for example Regius's edition of the Metamorphoses is devoted to correcting the text and explaining Ovid's words, ignoring allegorical exegesis, although it should be remembered that Regius's notes were often combined with Lavinius's Christian commentary on the first book. Nevertheless the old approaches continued. Sandys's extensive and tralatician commentary accompanying his translation in the 1632 edition contains much traditional allegorical lore. Alexander Ross's Mystagogus Poeticus or the Muses Interpreter (1647) con- tinued in use until the end of the seventeenth century, to familiarize English schoolboys with many of the allegorizations. For example, Ross interprets Ceres as a type of God's Church and of Christ, who "is truly Ceres; which having lost mankind, being carried away by the Devil, he came, and with the Torch of his Word, found him out; and ... went down to Hell, and rescued us from thence."21 A special case is consti- 19 It would be wrong to make an absolute distinction between a humanist ex- emplary Ovid and a Medieval allegorical Ovid. In 1555 Georgius Sabinus (son- in-law of Melanchthon) produced an elaboratte commentary on the Metamor- phoses, containing interpretatio, ethica, physica et historica, which was widely used in the Renaissance and which marks a kind of compromise between the two approaches. 20 See Tuve, p. 304. 21 Mystagogus Poeticus or the Muses Interpeter : Explaining the Historical 309</page><page sequence="10">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE tuted by the account of Creation and Flood in iMletamorpphoses I, where the correspondences with Scripture (whether treated as typology or as historical allegory) almost forced themselves upon the reader, and won widespread acceptance, enabling Milton in Paradise Lost to use Ovid as a quarry to supplement the briefer accounts in Genesis. The remaining two Ovids bring us closer to twentieth-century per- ceptions. First, there is the "rhetorical" Ovid, poetarum elegantissimus as Milton called him,22 master of artifice and of all the ornaments of rhetoric. At St. Paul's School, Milton will have been taught to dissect this aspect of Ovid's art in the minutest detail. Ann Moss has demon- strated that in France there was a shift in editions of Ovid during the sixteenth century towards rhetorical comment and away from alle- gory.23 A similar story could doubtless be told of England, even if it is arguable that the Renaissance in this country was a late and sickly growth. Holofernes, that doyen of Elizabethan schoolmasters, puts the point with heavy pedagogic humor: "Ovidius Naso was the man [viz., 'for the elegancy, facility, and golden cadence of poesy']: and why, indeed, Naso, but for smelling out the odoriferous flowers of fancy, the jerks of invention" (Love's Labour's Lost IV.ii.118 ff.). We have seen that Ovid's exuberant rhetoric began to diminish in appeal after the Restoration, and it is possible that Milton may have listened, to some degree, to the criticisms. Some frivolous details in Ovid's description of the Flood, a brilliant series of static conceits that constitute a set of variations on the "fishes in the trees" topos,24 had been condemned by Seneca (Naturales Quaestiones III.xxvii.13) as "pueriles ineptiae" (he is specifically commenting on line 304, "nat lupus inter oves: fulvos vehit unda leones": "the wolf swims among the sheep, the water car- ries tawny lions"). Sandys sensibly comments: "Seneca reproves this part of the description, as too light for so sad an argument, herein per- haps a better Philosopher then a Poet" (p. 7). It may be significant that Milton's account of the Flood (PL XI.738 ff.), while briefly pick- ing up the Ovidian theme, tones down its excesses (although the ex- planation might lie mainly in difference of genre), so that the resulting description becomes more Virgilian.25 In fact it is Dryden who best reproduces this particular aspect of Ovidian sensibility, both in his Mysteries, and Mystical Histories of the Antient Greek and Latin Poets (London, 1675), p. 69; hereafter cited in the text. There is an epigram praising Ross which maybe by Milton (Columbia edition, XVIII, 357). 22 Prolusions I, Columbia edition, XII, 144. 23 Ovid in Renaissance France: A Survey of the Latin Editions of Ovid and Commentaries Printed in France before 1600, Warburg Institute Surveys, 8 (Lon- don, 1982). 24 For the complexities of this topos see A.

Finally, there is what may be dubbed the "amoral" Ovid. In the 1590s there was a fashion for serving Ovid "neat" in short narrative poems, usually of a strongly erotic character.26 The wit, humor (at times approaching farce), grotesqueness, brittle pathos,27 lyricism and elegance of Ovid's narratives were reproduced in poems which might be seen as the literary analogues of Titian's mythological poesie (Ti- tian's painting, perhaps in an engraved version, may indeed be one of Shakespeare's sources of inspiration for Venus and Adonis).28 Mar- lowe in particular showed considerable sensitivity to various aspects of his master's art. For example, in the story of Hermaphroditus Ovid plays cleverly on the dual nature of Salmacis, partly a pool, partly a water nymph; thus, when Salmacis embraces Hermaphroditus the word circumfunditur (IV.360) is appropriate both to a human embrace and to the movement of water around a body (the trick, though often enough found in ancient literature, is a particular favourite of Ovid's). Similarly in Hero and Leander, when Neptune attempts to seduce Leander, he is both the anthropomorphic god of the sea and the waters of the Hellespont, and on one level the passage is perhaps the most accurate and sensuous description of swimming in English poetry: He clapp'd his plump cheeks, with his tresses play'd, And smiling wantonly, his love bewray'd. He watch'd his arms, and as they open'd wide At every stroke, betwixt them would he slide And steal a kiss, and then run out and dance, And as he turn'd, cast many a lustful glance, And threw him gaudy toys to please his eye, And dive into the water, and there pry Upon his breast, his thighs, and every limb, And up again, and close beside him swim... (Sestiad II, lines 181-90) Again, when Shakespeare sports lyrically with the play of white on white in Venus and Adonis 26 See William Keach, Elizabethan Erotic Narratives: Irony and Pathos in the Ozvidian Poetry of Shakespeare, Marlowe, and Their Contemporaries (Has- socks, Eng., 1977). For Marlowe and Ovid see also E.

As one would expect he sometimes uses a classical myth as an exemplum. In the invocation to Paradise Lost VII Bellerophon's attempt to ride to heaven exemplifies sinful aspiration. This was the usual interpretation: "By the example of Bellerophon, beware of Pride, which will spoil all good actions in us, and at last will give us a fall" (Mystagogus Poeticus, p. 46). Milton articulates the moral by means of a pun. Bellerophon falls on the Aleian plain-Milton, following the etymological implica- tions of Homer, Iliad VI.201 evidently connected this with the Greek word ahado/at 'I wander'30--in line 20 "erroneous there to wander and forlorn": "erroneous" bears both its Latinate nonmoral and its normal developed moral meaning. Milton may have got the idea from Horace, who uses the story as a (humorous) exemplum and points the moral by a different pun: "exemplum grave praebet ales / Pegasus terrenum equitem gravatus / Bellerophontem / semper ut te digna sequare," Odes IV.xi.26-29 ("Pegasus who refused the weight of his earthly rider Bellerophon affords a weighty example that you should always follow things worthy of you"). In Paradise Lost IV.449 ff., Eve describes how on first waking she saw herself in a pool, but was then warned by a divine voice to shun her reflection and seek Adam. The whole sequence is delicately moving, if perhaps slightly coy. The phrase "unexperienced thought" (457) could be taken as the keynote: to Eve's innocent, enquiring mind water is like sky, and her ignorance requires education. Her turning from shadow to substance makes her story balance Adam's account in VIII.452 ff. of how he dreamed of Eve and then, in Keats's famous phrase, "awoke and found it truth."31 Eve's story is explicitly moralized in that the Wethey, Titian: The Mythological and Historical Paintings, Vol. III of The Paintings of Titian (London, 1975), pp. 188 ff. 29 This becomes something of a topos in English poetry; see J.

There can be no doubt that the story of Narcissus is recalled in this sequence, and specifically Ovid's version of it. The awkwardness in the tenses of "With thee it came and goes" (469), which gives the words a curious Miltonic power, is due to exact imitation of the tenses of the original: "tecum vanitque, manetque" (111.435). Milton is perhaps tacitly cor- recting, with a kind of passionate pedantry not untypical of him, the translation of Sandys which renders vinit by a present tense.32 Ovid's interest in Narcissus is not essentially moralistic; his concern is rather with the psychology of such abnormal sexuality, and with the conceits and verbal paradoxes that entangle the self-lover. However, the story lends itself to moralizing, and the temptation was not resisted. In the simplest version Narcissus represents self-love and Echo boastful- ness: boastfulness naturally loves self-love (so, for example, Sabinus). The name Narcissus, according to the commentators, "signifies stupid or heavy" (Sandys, p. 105). Best known of more elaborate moraliza- tions is the Platonizing version of Ficino in his commentary on Plato's Symposium (VI.xvii). Narcissus here is the antitype of the Platonic lover: Diotima teaches Socrates to avoid death by leading him from body to soul and thence upwards to God ("quam utique mortem ut Socrates devitaret, Diotima ipsum a corpore ad animum, ab hoc in angelum, ab eo reduxit in deum"). By contrast Narcissus is ensnared by the world of appearances and the beauty of the body, mistaking this for true beauty. As a result, in Sandys's words (his rambling comments on Narcissus are much influenced by Ficino), "Narcissus ... ignorantly affecting one thing, pursues another; nor can ever satisfie his longings" (p. 106). Both the simple and complex versions seem relevant to Milton's pur- poses. In Book IV Eve behaves in accordance with Diotima's instruc- tions; she is not caught by the beauty of appearances, and recognizes the true beauty of Adam, even though he initially appears "Less win- ning soft... / Than that smooth watery image" (479-80). But it is also possible to see an ominous prolepsis in the allusion to Narcissus: Eve will eventually fall through exactly the self-love of the simple version. Sandys connects the story of Narcissus with the fall of the angels: "a fearfull example we have of the danger of selfe-love in the fall of the Angells; who intermitting the beatificall vision, by reflecting upon themselves, and admiration of their owne excellency, forgot their de- pendance upon their creator" (p. 106). Milton thus makes quite subtle ed. H. E. Rollins (Cambridge, 1958), I, 185. 32 See K. W.

Harding has shown in detail how extensive is the use that Milton makes of the traditional identifications between events in Metamor- phoses I and Genesis. Yet even here there can be surprises. Deucalion was normally associated with Noah (although some, including Golding, argued that Deucalion's flood was a second deluge, later than Noah's). Milton, however, links Deucalion and Pyrrha with Adam and Eve: ... yet their port Not of mean suitors, nor important less Seemed their petition, than when the ancient pair In fables old, less ancient yet than these, Deucalion and chaste Pyrrha to restore The race of mankind drowned, before the shrine Of Themis stood devout. (XI.8-14) The comparison is a curious one, and was censured by Bentley as "Rub- bish and Rags": "It was very instructive to tell us, that the Flood was not as ancient and early as the Creation. But was the Man bewitch'd, with his Old Fables, but not so old as these ? Is Adam and Eve's History an old Fable too, by this Editor's own Insinuation ?" (Bentley, who will stand as my example of a neoclassical and anti-Ovidian sensibility, is arguing, or pretending to argue, that the poem is full of errors and interpolations introduced by an ignorant editor.)34 The effect of the simile is to introduce a flavor of ancientness which only rarely sur- rounds Milton's voluble and far from primitive Adam and Eve. The simile also stresses (at precisely the point where it becomes significant) the intense isolation of the pair, a strong feature of Ovid's story. This shift in perspective matters as much as the ostensible point of compari- son (the dignity and importance of the prayer), and is comparable with the impact of the more evocative simile in which the partly clothed 33 For Narcissus in European literature see L. Vinge, The Narcissus Theme in Western European Literature up to the Early Nineteenth Century (Lund, 1967), pp. 123-27 on Ficino, 224-26 on Milton. The pattern of turning from a reflection (first of self, then of another) in a mirror to the full reality of the other person appears in Spenser FQ III.ii.18 ff. and earlier in the Romance of the Rose (see C. R. Edwards, "The Narcissus Myth in Spenser's Poetry," Studies in Philology, 74 [1977], 63-88). Satan's love for Sin is specifically narcissistic (PL 11.764-65); see J. H. Collett, "Milton's Use of Classical Mythology in Paradise Lost," PMLA, 85 (1970), 88-96 (p. 91). 34 Richard Bentley, Milton's Paradise Lost, A New Edition (London, 1732).

The tradition of the allegorized Ovid finds a closer reflection in one of the most famous passages in Paradise Lost: Not that fair field Of Enna, where Proserpine gathering flowers Her self a fairer flower by gloomy Dis Was gathered, which cost Ceres all that pain To seek her through the world; nor that sweet grove Of Daphne by Orontes, and the inspired Castalian spring, might with this Paradise Of Eden strive; nor that Nyseian isle Girt with the river Triton, where old Cham, Whom Gentiles Ammon call and Lybian Jove, Hid Amalthea and her florid son Young Bacchus from his stepdame Rhea's eye; Nor where Abassin kings their issue guard, Mount Amara, though this by some supposed True Paradise under the Ethiop line By Nilus' head, enclosed with shining rock, A whole day's journey high, but wide remote From this Assyrian garden, where the fiend Saw undelighted all delight ... (IV.268-86) Ovid treats the story of Proserpina twice, once in the Metamorphoses (V.385 ff.), and again in the Fasti (IV.417 ff.). Milton doubtless con- sulted both accounts, and perhaps too Claudian's De Raptu Proser- pinae. Though the writing is compact in a not quite Ovidian way, both the wit (the play on "flower") and the careful rhetorical patterning owe something to Ovid. Milton also shows how well he understands the Ovidian conventions. Frequently in the Metamorphoses descriptions of loci amoeni are the prelude to acts of sexual violence, while the pluck- ing of flowers has an obvious sexual implication.35 Milton too is prepar- ing for the irruption of violence in the person of Satan and for the "rape" of Eve; throughout Book IX there is a strong hint that Satan is seducing Eve, while the Fall includes the corruption of innocent sexuality. The Proserpina image is perhaps as near as Milton comes to the Ovide moralise."6 Milton is using the myth typologically to prefigure the 35 See C. P. Segal, Landscape in Ovid's Metamorphoses: A Study in the Transformations of a Literary Symbol (Wiesbaden, 1969), especially pp. 6-19, 33-38. The best general introduction to the Metamorphoses is G. K. Galinsky, Ovid's Metamorphoses: An Introduction to the Basic Aspects (Oxford, 1975). 36 Milton also makes use of the allegorized Ovidian Scylla for his description of Sin; see Harding, pp. 95-98. Bush (p. 270, n. 56) suggests that in PR IV.563- 68 Milton may be glancing at the traditional allegorization of the contest between Hercules and Antaeus; see also Fowler ad loc. 315</page><page sequence="16">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE Fall. In Book IX, when Satan sees Eve, she is picking flowers, "mindless the while, / Her self, though fairest unsupported flower" (431-32), and earlier she is compared to Ceres "Yet virgin of Proserpina from Jove" (396), still unravished. In the traditional allegorization Proserpina represents the Human Soul, Pluto the Devil, Ceres the Church or some- times Christ, and the flowers bona termporalia; nowhere that I have found does the story seem to be read as a type of Eve's fall. Sandys does come close, but even he is tentative: "Proserpina having eaten seven graines of a Pomegrannet (a fatall liquorishnesse, which retaines her in Hell; as the Apple thrust Evah out of Paradice, whereunto it is held to have a relation) .. ." (p. 195). Milton almost certainly got the idea, not from Ovid commentaries, but from one of his favourite poets, Dante."7 In Purgatorio XXVIII Dante sees the lovely Matelda (a mysterious figure, who seems to be a representative both of the Active Life and the unfallen Eve) picking flowers at the top of Mount Purgatory in a beautiful springtime landscape. It is always spring in the Earthly Para- dise, and one phrase in Ovid's description of the fair field of Enna seems to link it with his Golden Age, widely regarded as the pagan equivalent of the Earthly Paradise (1.107, "ver erat aeternum"; V.391, "per- petuum ver est"; cf. PL IV.268 "the eternal spring," just before the Proserpina passage). It was perhaps this echo in Ovid that led Dante to associate the rape of Proserpina with the loss of the Earthly Paradise. At all events, in lines 49-51 Dante explicitly compares Matelda with Proserpina, thereby associating her with the prelapsarian Eve: "Tu mi fai rimembrar dove e qual era / Proserpina nel tempo che perdette / la madre lei, ed ella primavera" ("You make me recall where and what was Proserpina at the time when her mother lost her, and she the spring"). Shelley in his translation of this canto combines Dante and Milton: like Proserpine Thou seemest to my fancy, singing here And gathering flowers, at that time when She lost the spring and Ceres her .., more dear. The conjunction shows that Shelley understood the point of the com- parison, even if, as Dorothy Sayers observes, in Shelley the human and allegorical levels are not as perfectly fused as they are in Dante.38 In Dante the twofold loss is the loss of Paradise; Shelley's additional point that a mother's love for her daughter matters more than the loss of the 37 For the two poets see Irene Samuel, Dante and Milton: The Conmmedia and Paradise Lost (Ithaca, N.Y., 1966). 38 See "Dante and Milton," in Further Papers on Dante (London, 1957), pp. 148-82 (pp. 178-82) ; T.

That Dante's application of the myth was unusual is suggested by the failure of Benvenuto da Imola, one of the best of the early commentators on the Comedy, to explain the allusion correctly. He mentions two allegorical interpretations of the myth, both "phys- ical" and neither in the least relevant. Milton at any rate was not deceived. Behind Proserpine and Dis we may thus discern Eve and Satan. The typology indeed matters more than the ostensible point of comparison. Some would go further and understand Ceres as a type of Christ. Noth- ing in the poem encourages the connection, and it is wrong to treat Milton's similes as diagrams in which tenor and vehicle must corre- spond exactly.3" After the glittering language of the opening there is some change of style for the final phrase "which cost Ceres all that pain / To seek her through the world." While most critics find pathos here, K. W. Gransden suggests that "all that pain" may rather be dis- missive of the mythological longueurs of Ovid's narrative of Ceres's search.40 An objection to his view is that even the most cursory glance at a concordance will show that "all" is a powerful word in Milton. However, on either interpretation there seems some extra pressure of reality, so that rape and loss can no longer simply be concealed behind an elegant conceit about the gathering of flowers. Bentley disliked the whole passage IV.268-86, arguing for deletion: How could the Editor find in his Heart to part these Clauses so lovingly united with an Insertion of 17 lines? with a silly thought in the whole, and as sillily conducted in its several parts. Not Enna, says he, not Daphne, nor Fons Castalius, nor Nysa, nor Mount Amnara could compare with Paradise. Why who, Sir, would suspect they could; though you had never told us it? And then,... you give us their bare Names, with some fabulous Story to them, not denoting at all any Beauty ... Where your Woman Flour is but fit for a Madrigal; and the rest has a meanness of Stile contemptible. Though crass, this criticism is marked by a perverse intelligence. Bent- ley has noticed that the lines on Proserpina herself are stylistically re- mote both from anything approaching an epic norm and from the other comparisons in the series. He has also observed the odd effect of the use of negative comparisons. It is possible to find analogies in classical poetry. Ovid and Lucan are both fond of what might be termed "nega- tive ecphrasis,"41 the description of something in terms of what it is not. The ironic Horace delights in all sorts of negativities, including recusa- tiones (poems of refusal) and negative commands. For example, he 39 I have argued for this in detail in "Milton and the Homeric Simile," Com- parative Literature, 33 (1981), 224-38. 40 Gransden, p. 282. 41 See E. J.

It is wrong to complain (as I have seen done) of Horace's puritanism in dismissing his great baroque image; the simultaneous evocation and rejection of the lingering rose creates a complex mood of checked sen- suality which is of indubitable power. The effect in Milton is compar- able. Ostensibly Milton's lines constitute an example of the "outdoing" topos: the fair field of Enna was not so fair as Paradise. But it is pos- sible to hear, as a subaudition, a suggestion that such things as the rape of Proserpina never happened. The length of the sentence, the delay before the main verb, and the firm thump of the initial "not" create a sense of disorientation in which the Proserpina comparison becomes momentarily distanced from the immediate point of reference (the comparative splendors of various gardens) and is presented with a strong negative emphasis. Throughout Paradise Lost Milton snipes at classical story. This begins when he makes exquisite use of the fable of Mulciber's fall from heaven, carefully imitated from the Iliad, only to knock it down as pagan error ("thus they relate, / Erring," 1.746 ff. ),42 and thereafter the words "feign" and "fable" are accompanied by an insistent suggestion of falsity.43 The effect of the characteristic Mil- 42 Douglas Bush cites an interesting parallel to the Mulciber passage from Sandys's A Relation of a Journey ("Notes on Milton's Classical Mythology," Studies in Philology, 28 [1931], 266 ff.). Collett (p. 2) argues that Milton is criticizing only the Homeric chronology, but this ignores the marked change of style between the lines in imitation of the Iliad and the abrasive rebuttal. That rebuttal is in fact itself couched in Homeric terms, since Milton has in mind one, and perhaps two, common Homeric formulae. The first is an ironic motif (some- times with implications of pathos) used mainly in connection with the minor vic- tims of war, who are said not to be saved by achievements, qualities or possessions (e.g., Iliad V.49-58; cf. Virgil Aen. XI.843 ff., "nec ... profuit"). The second is a corrective formula used when a character acts in ignorance of the true state of things, and is always introduced by vPrrtos ("fool") as the emphatic first word in the line, rather like Milton's "erring" (e.g., Iliad XX.463-68). The two motifs are combined in Iliad 11.871-75. The effect of using Homeric rhetoric against Homer himself is unnerving; Milton's relationship with his classical models is, as ever, complex and devious. It can of course be argued that Milton's procedure is merely the standard on' of at once illustrating the errors of paganism and showing how they pre-echo the Christian truth. But this is to neglect the curious edginess of Milton's relationship with the ancients. One can compare the way he adopts the manner and matter of classical epic with an almost pedantic thoroughness only to denounce its moral and literary shortcomings in the prologue to Book IX, thereby cutting the ground from under his own (and the reader's) feet. There is nothing standard about such a strategy, which is without exact parallel in Renaissance poetry. 43 See PL IV.250 ff., 705-08; V.379-82; IX.439 ff.; XI.8-14 (all passages cen- sured by Bentley). For a different view see Collett, pp. 88-96 (however, his at- tempt to distinguish sharply between "fable" and "feign" seems to founder on PL IX.30-31, "fabled knights / In battles feigned"). In Comus Milton shows a gen- erous inclusiveness towards classical mythology (see especially lines 512-18), and 318</page><page sequence="19">OVID IN MILTON tonic modulation, from lyricism to scorn, in the description of Paradise under discussion is somewhat analogous to the rhetorical movement of the Mulciber passage. The precarious lyric beauty of the opening gives way to drier comparisons, and finally to the scornful, mocking pedantry of the close. The pagan house of cards has been laboriously constructed for the purposes of demolition; beauty is evoked, then undermined. The suspicion of classical legend is not hard to parallel among writers of the period (for example, Cowley talks of "the confused antiquated Dreams of senseless Fables and Metamorphoses").44 What is harder to parallel is Milton's extraordinary sensitivity towards the stories he rejects. Since Milton is often thought of as our prime classicist, it is worth insisting that his evocation of the Proserpina story is not quite "classi- cal" in feeling (in the normal stylistic sense of the word). A comparison with some famous lines in The Winter's Tale, which Milton may well have had in mind, should make this clear: I would I had some flowers o' th' spring, that might Become your time of day; and yours, and yours, That wear upon your virgin branches yet Your maidenheads growing: O Proserpina, For the flowers now, that, frighted, thou let'st fall From Dis's Waggon! daffodils, That come before the swallow dares, and take The winds of March with beauty; violets, dim, But sweeter than the lids of Juno's eyes Or Cytherea's breath; pale primroses, That die unmarried, ere they can behold Bright Phoebus in his strength. (IV.iv.133-44) For all the lyricism, Shakespeare's classicism is a sturdy thing; "Dis's waggon" brings the allusion into an English present as firmly as hap- pens to classical stories it -Golding, or in Venus and Adonis.45 By con- trast Milton as it were sees the myth through a romantic, shimmering haze, and re-creates it with a desperate sweetness which proclaims its precariousness. In Paradise Regained 11.289 ff., Milton describes "a pleasant grove," which "to a superstitious eye" would seem "the haunt / Of wood-gods this attitude may reappear in one passage in PL (IX.439-43), if "mystic" there means "containing a concealed truth" (see Osgood, Introduction, pp. xlv-li; Bush, pp. 269 ff.; Harding, pp. 93-95). But generally Milton is more antagonistic. 44 See J. E. Spingarn, Critical Essays of the Seventeenth Century, 1650-1685 (Oxford, 1908), p. 88 (quoted by Bush, p. 247). This is an instance of a general tension within Protestantism; one could compare Herbert's attitude to poetry in Jordan, or Marvell's in The Coronet. But the dichotomy runs deeper with Milton, because of his especial familiarity with classical literature. 45 See A. D. Nuttall, William Shakespeare: "The Winter's Tale," Studies in English Literature, 26 (London, 1966), pp. 40-42. 319</page><page sequence="20">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE and wood-nymphs." (The whole description is interestingly Ovidian: "Nature taught Art" briefly echoes a characteristic Ovidian antithesis, e.g., Met. III.158 ff., "simulaverat artem / Ingenio Natura suo," "Na- ture had feigned art by her own cunning," and also XI.235 ff.). One wonders what superstitious eyes, likely to peruse learned poetry, were left in seventeenth-century England to be misled by such pagan feign- ing. One possible answer is Milton himself, or at any rate a part of Mil- ton himself. In the Nativity Ode, in the description of the pagan deities routed at the Incarnation, he had shown considerable imaginative in- sight into the power of rival religious systems. One verse is especially striking: The lonely mountains o'er, And the resounding shore, A voice of weeping heard, and loud lament; From haunted spring, and dale Edged with poplar pale, The parting genius is with sighing sent, With flower-inwoven tresses torn The nymphs in twilight shade of tangled thickets mourn. (stanza 20) There is a lack here of any pejorative adjectives, or of anything to run counter to the prevailing note of pathos and even tragedy. This is the more remarkable if those scholars are right who see an allusion to the slaughter of the Innocents in Matthew 2:18, where Jeremiah is quoted: "In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning." Toward the close the ode lurches oddly back into paganism with the evocative lines on "the yellow-skirted fays." Milton's feel- ing for the power of classical fables seems to have been of unusual proportions. For Milton classical story is untrue and belongs to a vanished world, but such false surmise may offer a little ease to the dreaming poet. While it is doubtless right to claim that Eliot's doctrine of "the dis- sociation of sensibility" is in essence a Symbolist myth,40 nevertheless some dissociation does seem characteristic of Milton. Keats puts the point brilliantly: The Genius of Milton, more particularly in respect to its span in immensity, cal- culated him, by a sort of birthright, for such an 'argument' as the Paradise Lost: he had an exquisite passion for what is properly, in the sense of ease and pleasure, poetical Luxury; and with that it appears to me he would fain have been content, if he could, so doing, have preserved his self-respect and feel of duty performed; but there was working in him as it were that same sort of thing as operates in the great world to the end of a Prophecy's being accomplish'd: therefore he devoted himself rather to the ardours than the pleasures of Song, solacing himself at inter- 46 See F. Kermode, Romantic Image (London, 1957), pp. 138-61. 320</page><page sequence="21">OVID IN MILTON vals with cups of old wine; and those are with some exceptions the finest parts of the poem. With some exceptions-for the spirit of mounting and adventure can never be unfruitful or unrewarded: had he not broken through the clouds which envelope so deliciously the Elysian field of verse, and committed himself to the Extreme, we should never have seen Satan as described- "But his face Deep scars of thunder had entrench'd, &amp;c."47 As a result of this doubleness in his attitude to paganism Milton antici- pates certain aspects of Romantic sensibility. We are not so far from Wordsworth's feelings about "old Triton," and we can see why Keats was enthralled by the Proserpina image. It is interesting that Milton should have helped to pioneer this response to classical myth, since he contributed to a similar sensibility about the Middle Ages, neo-Gothic rather than Gothic as we might put it, witness the famous lines in II Penseroso: But let my due feet never fail, To walk the studious cloister's pale, And love the high embowed roof, With antique pillars' massy proof, And storied windows richly dight, Casting a dim religious light. (lines 155-60) Here we have a feeling for vague numinousness that is a feature of the Romantic response to the Gothic and which still affects us today (as was illustrated by the opposition to the cleaning of King's College Chapel in Cambridge), so alien to the precision and elaboration with which the buildings were originally conceived. Milton's response to church architecture and to religion itself seems in this passage curiously aesthetic. In particular, the phrase "dim religious light" (whether "religious" means "appropriate to religion," as OED and the com- mentators suppose, or rather "connected with a religious order") oddly suggests an almost post-Christian sensibility, or at least a strange aes- thetic detachment. At all events, it goes beyond the feeling for Gothic ruins (partly a reaction to the affects of the dissolutions at the Reforma- tion) which is characteristic of the period; two familiar and eloquent examples are Antonio's speech in The Duchess of Malfi (V.iii.9 ff.) 47 "Notes on Milton's 'Paradise Lost,' " quoted from The Complete Works of John Keats, ed. H. Buxton Forman (Glasgow, 1901), III, 256 ff.; hereafter cited in the text. Cf. Gilbert Murray, "Poiesis and Mimesis," Humanist Essays (rpt.

Ovid is evidently an important source for Milton's response to classi- cal "fable." In Paradise Lost XI.126 ff. Milton alludes to the Ovidian story of Argus: .. the archangelic power prepared For swift descent, with him the cohort bright Of watchful cherubim; four faces each Had, like a double Janus, all their shape Spangled with eyes more numerous than those Of Argus, and more wakeful than to drowse, Charmed with Arcadian pipe, the pastoral reed Of Hermes, or his opiate rod. Mean while To resalute the world with sacred light Leucothea waked, and with fresh dews embalmed The earth. Predictably Bentley again senses his quarry: "But our Editor had such an Itching to mix Fable with the most serious Matter, that he could not but insert Janus's Faces, and Argus's Eyes, and Mercury's Pipe. A great Character indeed of the Cherubim; that they were more wakeful than a Country Cow-herd Argus. And note the fine Expression, More wakeful than to drouze: more vocal than to be mute, more white than to be black." Milton's point is presumably precisely that the Biblical cherubim were free of the shortcomings of the pagan Argus who was eventually cheated into sleep; but Bentley certainly alerts us to the oddly relaxed quality of the writing-this is the closest that we shall come to the Milton of Eliot (in his first essay) and Leavis, in love with sound at the expense of sense-and the combination of syntactic loose- ness with the vocabulary ("spangled," "drowse," "charmed," "opiate," "embalmed") brings us curiously close to Keats or Shelley.4s The effect is both like and unlike Ovid, but it does suggest that Ovid contributed something vital to the structure of Milton's imagination. The story of Proserpina may have had a special significance for Mil- ton, since, in a letter to Diodati, he uses Ceres's search for her daughter as an image of the poet's pursuit of the idea of the beautiful.49 Else- where Milton uses an Ovidian myth in an even more obviously personal way. The story of Orpheus had always appealed to him,50 and in Ly- 48Collett (pp. 95 ff.) offers a very different reading; his concentration on typological possibilities leads him to ignore the character of the poetry. 49 Columbia edition, XII, 26 ff. (quoted by Bush, p. 248). 50 See L'Allegro, lines 145-50; II Penseroso, 105-08; Osgood, pp. 66 ff. PL XI.833, "Down the great river to the opening gulf," seems to recall, in rhythm and movement, line 63 of Lycidas, "Down the swift Hebrus to the Lesbian shore." This presumably accidental echo could have resulted from an unconscious associa- tion of the Orpheus myth with loss (here with the loss of Paradise). 322</page><page sequence="23">OVID IN MILTON cidas he uses it as a focus for his fears about the poet's insecurity. Some critics, wrongly in my view, read the passage "allegorically," finding in it a glimmering of Christ's redemptive suffering. That the Orpheus- Christ equation would indeed have been familiar to Milton and his read- ers is shown by, for example, this passage from Alexander Ross: Christ is the true Orpheus, who by the sweetness and force of his Evangelical musick caused the Gentiles, who before were stocks and stones in knowledge, and no better than beasts in Religion, to follow after him: it was he only who went down to hell to recover the Church his Spouse, who had lost her self ... . What was in vain attempted by Orpheus, was truly performed by our Saviour, for he alone hath delivered our souls from the nethermost hell; and at last was he torn with whips, and thorns, and pierced with nails, and a spear, upon the Cross, for our transgressions. (pp. 338-39) However nothing in Milton's lines suggests the Passion. This section of Lycidas is concerned with the powerlessness of the poet, and the particular quality of the lines, with their intense personal anguish, tells against the allegorizers. Moreover Christ's earthly sufferings do not appear to have moved Milton deeply at any stage of his poetic career. He sensibly abandoned his early poem on the Passion which conveys only ersatz emotion, while the vita Christi in Paradise Lost XII is one of the driest passages in the entire poem; the lines on the Crucifixion are almost brutally insensitive ("But to the cross he nails thy enemies," 415), and it is only the Resurrection which seems to fire Milton's imagi- nation ("ere the third dawning light / Return, the stars of morn shall see him rise / Out of his grave, fresh as the dawning light," 421-23). The prologue to Book VII lends further support to the view that Orpheus had a personal rather than a religious significance for Milton. For 39 lines, like a dog worrying a bone, Milton explains how the Muse he invokes is not one of the pagan nine, but the true Heavenly Muse. The climax is reached when Milton uses the story of Orpheus against paganism: But drive far off the barbarous dissonance Of Bacchus and his revellers, the race Of that wild rout that tore the Thracian bard In Rhodope, where woods and rocks had ears To rapture, till the savage clamour drowned Both harp and voice; nor could the Muse defend Her son. So fail not thou, who thee implores : For thou art heavenly, she an empty dream. (VII.32-39) The tortuous illogic of the lines is almost as remarkable as their extra- ordinary emotional power. The argument would make strict logical sense only if the story of Orpheus's death were in some sense true, which Milton denies. 323</page><page sequence="24">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE Orpheus was so well known that we cannot be sure that Ovid was the source, particularly since Virgil gives an incomparable account of the myth in Georgics IV. Nevertheless it is significant that what moves Milton is not so much Orpheus's loss of his wife, the focus of Virgil's account (though Milton makes graceful, relaxed use of this in L'Al- legro) as his death and dismemberment, which is described in detail in Metamorphoses XI.1 ff. In Ovid's version Orpheus cannot be killed until the clamor drowns the music of his lyre (before that the weapons merely fall beguiled at his feet), and this detail seems to lie behind lines 35-37. Milton probably wrote the passage shortly after the Restoration at a time when some of his former colleagues were being, literally, dis- membered by the restored Royalists, and he himself was potentially in grave danger as one who had recommended regicide; his old fears that the blind Fury might preempt his great task must have returned to him with peculiar strength. Traditional moral and allegorical readings of the myth are thus irrelevant. Golding thought the death of Orpheus a punishment for sexual incontinence (Epistle, 224-25), while to Sandys Orpheus represented "the life of philosophy" and the Bacchants "the heady rage of mutiny and sedition" (p. 387). For Milton, however, Orpheus is simply the inspired bard who could not save himself and who in the world of paganism could not be saved, a figure for Milton as he might have been without grace. Not surprisingly, in view of their Romantic quality, Keats selected these lines as one of the two finest poetic moments in Paradise Lost, the other being the Proserpina simile: There are two specimens of a very extraordinary beauty in the Paradise Lost; they are of a nature as far as I have read, unexampled elsewhere-they are en- tirely distinct from the brief pathos of Dante-and they are not to be found even in Shakespeare-these are according to the great prerogative of poetry better described in themselves than by a volume. The one is in the fol [lowing]--"which cost Ceres all that pain"-the other is that ending "Nor could the Muse defend her son"-they appear exclusively Miltonic without the shadow of another mind ancient or Modern. (pp. 264 ff.) Furthermore in the lines that conclude the Orpheus passage "dream" is an almost Keatsian touch, and significantly the stalwart and neo- classical Bentley proposed emending to the more logical "Name." The passage shows how deeply Milton engaged with classical mythology, and the word "dream" points to the source of its power and its ultimate dissatisfactions. The Miltonic poet was a dreamer ("Such sights as youthful poets dream / On summer eves by haunted stream," L'Al- legro 129-30; "And let some strange mysterious dream, / Wave at his wings in airy stream," II Penseroso 147-48), and yet what he dreams could be elusive and unsatisfying, as much an escape from as a release 324</page><page sequence="25">OVID IN MILTON into reality. The clash between Milton's Platonism and his Hebraism is strongly felt at such moments; in Paradise Regained it is finally re- solved, but at tremendous poetic cost. As has been said, the loss of a deep natural familiarity with classical texts has often resulted in a preoccupation with supposed verbal allu- sions, at the expense of more widely diffused influence in matters of style and decorum, Two scenes in Paradise Lost are marked by a pro- found Ovidian presence, while containing nothing to signal the debt by way either of exact imitatio or specific mythic reference, and neither as it happens has won the wholehearted acceptance of the critics. In Book V, Raphael is entertained by Adam and Eve to a vegetarian meal that might remind gourmets of the nouvelle cuisine (Eve does not believe in adulterating flavors, 334-35). The episode has embarrassed some of the poet's friends,"' and one infamous detail aroused snorts of derision from Bentley. The scene is a theoxenia, the entertainment of a divine guest or guests by a mortal, and the Old Testament provides important models, particularly Abraham's reception of the three angels (Genesis 18), which Milton calls to our mind when Adam sits at the door of his bower sheltering from the sun (PL V.299-300; Genesis 18 :1). But the Biblical account is somewhat lacking in fullness of detail, and Milton did not so much want a feeling of numinously mysterious visitation as to show man and angel on a familiar footing. (Milton was probably also thinking of the apocryphal book of Tobit, in which a disguised Raphael plays an important role in a story of a markedly bourgeois character, an episode from which is referred to in PL IV.167-71.) The locus classicus (if the mild pun may be forgiven) for a poetic theoxenia is Ovid's story of Philemon and Baucis in Metamorphoses VIII.611 ff. (Also important is Aeneas's visit to Pallanteum in Aeneid VIII, which provides a precedent for a quasi theoxenia in a pastoral setting in epic.) Ovid's story is given a moral framework and a clear moral direction by the poet, but it is also a fairy story with an exotic Eastern setting, touched with magic at its close, when the two old peo- ple are turned into trees simultaneously. Much of the tale is given over to genre-painting and to bourgeois comedy in the manner of Calli- machus. Renaissance commentators spell out the moralitas: "hospi- talitas Deo grata" (Sabinus). Philemon and Baucis represent, accord- ing to Sandys, "the patternes of chast and constant coniugall affections: as of content in poverty . . . A condition as full of innocency, as secur- ity" (p. 295, wrongly numbered 265). Biblical analogues are also cited, Paul and Barnabas at Lystra mistaken for gods (Acts 14:8 ff.), Lot and the angels in Genesis 19 (Sandys speculates that Ovid's story might 51 See A. D. Nuttall, Overheard by God (London, 1980), pp. 85-93. 325</page><page sequence="26">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE have been taken from there), and the famous verse from the Epistle to the Hebrews 13:2 ("Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for there- by some have entertained angels unawares"). But, unusually, Ovid's wit also aroused comment. Sabinus notes that the tale is told humor- ously (hilari animo), and even speculates that Philemon may have been modeled by Ovid in his own bailiff; according to Sandys the story is "most conceitedly expressed by our wittiest of Authors" (p. 296), a rare observation of this kind in his commentary. Ovid lovingly describes the preparation of a simple meal in the couple's humble hut, and a comic climax is reached when Philemon and Baucis attempt to catch their goose to sacrifice it to Jupiter. As Dryden gives it in his version (scarce- ly inferior to the original) : One Goose they had, ('twas all they cou'd allow) A wakeful Cent'ry, and on Duty now, Whom to the Gods for Sacrifice they vow : Her, with malicious Zeal, the Couple view'd; She ran for Life, and limping they pursu'd: Full well the Fowl perceiv'd their bad intent, And wou'd not make her Masters Compliment; But persecuted, to the Pow'rs she flies, And close between the Legs of Jove she lies. ("Baucis and Philemon," lines 130-38) In one respect, perhaps deliberately to be remarked on by the sophis- ticated reader, Milton alters the Ovidian (and Biblical) pattern. Raph- ael comes undisguised and is not entertained unawares. The unfallen Adam and Eve neither need nor receive a testing, and meet their angel guest on equal terms; hence almost a casualness in the encounter, a lack of awe and mystery, however richly described the visitant may be. In the details of the scene Milton shows a perfect understanding of the Ovidian conventions, while adapting the various motifs to the vege- tarian conditions of Paradise, and making the humor less broad. He combines the exotic (the angel--"another morn / Risen on mid-noon," as Adam puts it, V.310-11-the spicy forest where "nature . . Wan- toned as in her prime ... enormous bliss," 294-97) and the homely and domestic as Eve busies herself preparing dinner. Adam and Eve behave as beseems a good bourgeois couple, and have an amusing exchange about stores (308 ff.); Adam assumes that Eve as a good housewife keeps food ready, while Eve not unreasonably points out that there is little need for stores in Paradise. It would be idle to suppose that Milton himself missed the humor of this conversation, any more than in the case of the splendid if notorious "No fear lest dinner cool" (396) with its jab of social satire, where the heavy Miltonic wit unjustly aroused from Bentley wit yet heavier: "If the Devils want feeding, our Author 326</page><page sequence="27">OVID IN MILTON made poor Provision for them in his Second Book; where they have nothing to eat but Hell-fire; and no danger of their Dinner cooling" (note on V.415). Even the normally sober Fowler is moved to wit at this point: "Thyer thought superfluous moist too philosophical for Eve, but it seems quite appropriate for an intelligent woman to have technical knowledge about food storage. Eve was in no position to leave such things to the servants" (p. 694). In the account of the meal Milton balances simplicity, good house- keeping (for example, the moralized vessels, 348), and frugality ("fru- gal storing," 324), as required by certain aspects of his Puritan philoso- phy and suggested by the Ovidian story, with the sheer abundance of Paradise and with a feast of great richness. Fruits may be frugal fare, but the fruits of Paradise are fit for a feast; the equivocation (if it is such) perfectly suits the, in one sense, unimaginable unfallen condition which Milton points to so skillfully: ... and from each tender stalk Whatever Earth all-bearing mother yields In India east or west, or middle shore In Pontus or the Punic coast, or where Alcinous reigned, fruit of all kinds, in coat, Rough, or smooth rined, or bearded husk, or shell She gathers, tribute large, and on the board Heaps with unsparing hand ... (337-44) (Fowler thinks the reference to Pontus and Punic figs ominous; this over-interpretation illustrates the danger of ignoring the poetic char- acter of a passage through irrelevant learning.) The primitivism of the alfresco dinner arrangements (a table of "grassy turf," 391-92; "mossy seats," 392) is offset by the fullness and glamour of "And on her ample square from side to side / All autumn piled, though spring and autumn here / Danced hand in hand" (393-95). The story of Philemon and Baucis, at once exotic and humorously homely, is found unusually agreeable by most readers of Ovid, but Milton's analogous combination has not proved so popular. It can, however, be defended. Paradise is at once ordinary and wondrous, and if that is not our imagining, then the poet might complain of our moral attitudes as much as of our literary tastes. Here, as elsewhere, Milton affronts the fastidious by his extreme physicalism and his refusal to retreat into vagueness. An example is the way that he insists, provocatively, on Eve's nakedness throughout the scene. After the witticism about Eve's being undecked save with her own beauty and the comparison with the naked goddesses at the judgment of Paris (379 ff.), we have the angelic salutation prefiguring 327</page><page sequence="28">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE the Annunciation, "Hail mother of mankind," startling, even incongru- ous, in such a context; the resulting iconographic clash produces a kind of frisson. Later Milton observes, dangerously, that Raphael might well have been (though he was not) enamoured by the naked Eve as the sons of God later were by the daughters of men (443 ff.). Equally marked is the concreteness of the description of Raphael descending and of the dinner arrangements, and the insistence on the actuality of angelic appetite and digestion ("what redounds, transpires / Through spirits with ease," 438-39-there is no angelic constipation evidently!). The combination of grandeur and theatricality with a kind of hyper- realism (linked, in Milton's case, with the sheer intellectual obstinacy that leads him to pursue such matters as angelic digestion, a habit of mind everywhere revealed in De Doctrina Christiana) is an important aspect of the baroque sensibility, and a further link between the imagi- nations of Ovid and Milton. Admittedly Ovid's concreteness tends to be used for more frivolous ends. For example in the Phaethon story Apollo wears a crown of rays which he has to take off to allow his son to approach (Met. 11.40-42; Milton's imitation, PL 111.625-26, is far more sober). The zodiac through which the chariot passes is alive with actualized beasts; the poison of the normally torpid Serpent is warmed and thus activated by the proximity of the fiery chariot (Met. 11.173 ff.). What is sometimes found offensive in Milton is admired if we turn to the sister art of painting. In the Galleria Doria-Pamphili is a painting by Caravaggio of The Rest on the Flight into Egypt.52 An elegant and sexually provocative (if androgynous) angel stands with his back to us. He has immensely solid birdlike wings, and plays a precisely rendered violin, as Joseph holds out some sheet music with a lullaby, which can in fact be transcribed. The picture is not quite a masterpiece, but the concreteness points clearly forward to the great triumphs ahead. Mil- ton's Italian visit doubtless helped to foster this aspect of his sensibility, but Ovid as the most "baroque" of the great Latin poets will also have played his part. Furthermore, parallels for the vividly concrete cosmic imaginings of Paradise Lost are provided both by baroque painting and by Ovid, especially the Phaethon story, with which Milton was evidently deeply involved. In the description of the fall of Mulciber (1.740 ff.), Milton engaged in emulous rivalry with Homer, Iliad 1.590 ff., particularly in the superb placement, mimetically, of the verb "dropped" (Homer's xKdarrecov). Milton removes the warmly human touch with which Homer ends ("there the Sintian men straightway cared for me on my fall"), 52 See Howard Hibbard, Caravaggio (London, 1983), pp. 53-55. 328</page><page sequence="29">OVID IN MILTON but increases the sense of cosmic drama. The comparison with a falling star (although referred by Todd to Theocritus, Idyll XIII.50 ff.) was surely suggested by some lines in Metamorphoses II: "Fertur; ut in- terdum de caelo stella sereno, / Etsi non cecidit, potuit cecidisse videri," 321-22 ("Phaethon is carried along, as sometimes a star from a clear sky, even if it has not fallen, still could appear to fall"). Ovid's Phaethon was often linked with Lucifer, so that he would naturally come to Mil- ton's mind."3 Milton also increases the linguistic opulence and wistful romantic lyricism ("crystal battlements"; "noon to dewy eve / A sum- mer's day"). We may say that Milton Ovidianizes Homer. Whatever is thought of it as an ensemble, Milton's theoxenia un- doubtedly contains some of his finest writing. A second episode that would have been seen as Ovidian in overall character is deliberately one-dimensional. In Book X.504 ff., Milton turns to the metamorphosis theme itself to describe how Satan and the fallen angels are changed to snakes and forced to eat bitter ashes. The scene, as Waldock observed, is characterized by a grand-style version of a "comic cartoon" tech- nique.54 It would be possible to complain that Milton's most glamorous creation is given his comeuppance with too great ease. However the ludicrous discomfiture of the villain at the very moment of his apparent triumph has been carefully calculated. In Book IX, to seduce Eve, Satan makes his supreme effort, recovering, in his serpent form, much of his original glamour. The lovely description of his progress towards her "With burnished neck of verdant gold, erect / Amidst his circling spires" (501 ff.) perfectly expresses his self-satisfaction and vanity. But, like lago and other Renaissance literary villains, the deed done, he is necessarily deflated ("Back to the thicket slunk / The guilty ser- pent," 784 ff.), and his speech on his return is the emptiest of bombast. The style of the peripeteia that follows is thus in accordance with the demands of decorum, "the grand masterpiece to observe." Milton successfully catches the grotesqueness and humour of many Ovidian transformations, but his response to the actual process of change in this episode is less poetically urgent than his master's. Classi- cal scholars sometimes suggest that the theme of metamorphosis is to Ovid only a pretext to provide a semblance of unity to his poem, not at the true center of his concerns; yet the virtuoso descriptions of change are almost alwa s beautifully handled, like the lines on Daphne being transformed into laurel which Dryden gives thus: Scarce had she finish'd, when her Feet she found Benumm'd with cold, and fasten'd to the Ground: 53 See Harding, pp. 88-92; Doran, p. 48. 54 See A. J. A. Waldock, Paradise Lost and its Critics (Cambridge, 1947), pp. 91 ff. 329</page><page sequence="30">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE A filmy rind about her Body grows, Her Hair to Leaves, her Arms extend to Boughs : The Nymph is all into a Lawrel gone, The smoothness of her Skin remains alone. Yet Phoebus loves her still and, casting round Her Bole, his Arms, some little warmth he found. The Tree still panted in the unfinish'd part, Not wholly vegetive, and heav'd her Heart. He fix'd his Lips upon the trembling Rind; It swerv'd aside, and his Embrace declin'd. (Translation of Met. I, lines 742-53) Apollo promises that Daphne will be his tree, and in response "the laurel waved her new-made branches, and seemed to move her head- like top in full consent" ("factis modo laurea ramis / Annuit : utque caput, visa est agitasse cacumen," Met. 1.566-67). The moving equivo- cation (is this a genuine human gesture of assent, or just a tree waving in the wind ?) is at once delicate and slightly wistful, and such delicacies are certainly irrelevant to Milton's concerns in Paradise Lost X, and perhaps even out of his range. The snake passage is rather designed primarily for scornful comic effect: for example, the various learned puns (often a sign of stylistic lowering)--"supplanted," "reluctant," "sublime," "exploding"-and the joke whereby the expected applause is metamorphosed into "a uni- versal hiss" (508). (Low diction also marks the vigorously sensuous description of the chewing of bitter ashes, "which the offended taste / With spattering noise rejected," 566-67). For the transformation Mil- ton obviously had in mind the passage in Metamorphoses IV (576 ff.) in which Cadmus and Harmonia are changed into snakes to the horror of the onlookers. Curiously this is not specifically alluded to here, though it has been mentioned earlier, in Book IX (505 ff.), presum- ably proleptically, in a way that can be regarded as typical of Milton.55 In a notable fit of outdoing in Inferno XXV (94 ff.), Dante had claimed that his serpentine transformations surpassed their analogues in Lucan and Ovid. In his own treatment of change Dante showed Milton (who takes hints from all three poets) how a Christian writer could use Ovid- ian metamorphosis for the comic horrors and the cruelties of Hell.56 Milton's episode is heavily moralized, and it may thus be relevant to recall that Ovid's transformations were regularly given moral signifi- cance by Medieval and Renaissance commentators. In reality metamor- phosis occurs in Ovid for various reasons-as punishment both merited 55 See John Hollander, The Figure of Echo: A Mode of Allusion in Milton and After (Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1981), pp. 69 ff. 56 See Fowler's note ad loc.

However, Golding treats meta- morphosis as something essentially moral. One Italian allegorizer even states (quite falsely) that "there is not a single transformation which did not result from a disregard of God or from sin.""57 It is against this background that Milton's fashioning of Satan into the great shape- changer must be seen. This may take various forms, from actual meta- morphosis to comparison with delusive shapes (for example, the whale- island of the simile in 1.200 ff.), or descriptions that seem to dissolve Satan's solidity, like the passage about his spear (1.292-94) so ingeni- ously analysed by Stanley Fish.58 Keats particularly admired IX.179- 91, the moment when Satan enters the sleeping serpent: "Whose spirit does not ache at the smothering and confinement-the unwilling still- ness-the 'waiting close'? Whose head is not dizzy at the possible speculations of Satan in the serpent prison? No passage of poetry ever can give a greater pain of suffocation." In the splendid completion of this pattern the self-changer is changed at the very moment when he most wants to be himself. The comparison (530 ff.) of Satan to the Python who was slain by Apollo (Met. 1.438 ff.) creates an appropri- ate quasi typology (Satan is "the great dragon" as well as "that old serpent" in Revelation 12:9). In the final lines of the episode (578-84) Milton returns to classical mythology, identifying the devils with the heathen gods; the pedantic learning has been taken as genuinely specu- lative, but the dry tone and some details ("fabled" and "perhaps") rather suggest mockery: And fabled how the serpent, whom they called Ophion with Eurynome, the wide- Encroaching Eve perhaps, had first the rule Of high Olympus ... Milton probably shared the common humanist suspicion of such per- verse ingenuities. Ovidian feeling is diffused throughout large parts of Paradise Lost, and is perhaps particularly evident whenever Eve is on the scene (see, for example, the Circe simile at IX.521 ff.).59 Ovid thus becomes the focus not only for ambiguities about classical mythology which at one level meant so much to Milton, but also ambiguities about women (a matter beyond the scope of this article) and about sensuality in general, the tensions evident throughout Milton's poetry between his love of 57 Quoted by Allen, p. 177. 58 Surprised by Sin: The Reader in Paradise Lost (New York and London, 1967), pp. 22-27. 59 For Milton and Circe see Harding, pp. 58-66; and L. L. Brodwin, "Milton and the Renaissance Circe," Milton Studies, 6 (1974), 21-83. 331</page><page sequence="32">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE beauty and his Puritan disdain for it. In Ovid's story of Salmacis and Hermaphroditus there is a finely imagined moment when the nymph watches the naked boy swimming in her pool, unobserved by him (Met. IV.340 ff.); there is a special quality of voyeuristic sensuality about such unseen watching. A similar atmosphere (increased by the even greater verbal opulence) characterizes the scene in PL IX when an un- seen Satan watches Eve moving among the flowers (the eroticism is of course more conventional than in Ovid in view of the masculine sex of the watcher). The reminiscence of Proserpina brings into focus the familiar Ovidian theme of rape in a locus amnoenus. Indeed this whole section of Book IX is full of Ovidian allusions,60 in particular the simile cluster 386-96, where the comparison of Eve with Pomona creates a mood of sweet fruitfulness (there is little attempt here to deny a value in classical stories). At such moments the austere Puritan be- comes the most sensuous of English poets: He sought them both, but wished his hap might find Eve separate, he wished, but not with hope Of what so seldom chanced, when to his wish, Beyond his hope, Eve separate he spies, Veiled in a cloud of fragrance, where she stood, Half spied, so thick the roses bushing round About her glowed, oft stooping to support Each flower of slender stalk, whose head though gay Carnation, purple, azure, or specked with gold, Hung drooping unsustained, them she upstays Gently with myrtle band, mindless the while, Her self, though fairest unsupported flower, From her best prop so far, and storm so nigh. Nearer he drew, and many a walk traversed Of stateliest covert, cedar, pine, or palm, Then voluble and bold, now hid, now seen Among thick-woven arborets and flowers Embordered on each bank, the hand of Eve ... (421-38) I have attempted to show how various aspects of the Renaissance Ovid influenced Milton's deployment of Ovidian material in Paradise Lost. Familiarity with the text of the Metamorphoses, and the tradi- tional ways of reading it, run deeper with Milton than with any other English poet, even Shakespeare. But in the last resort Milton used the Metamorphoses, as the Romantics later used the Faerie Queene, as a door into "faery lands forlorn." In this way Ovid became part, and not an unimportant part, of Milton's sensibility, and thus of the delicate 60 For PL IX.386, cf. Met. VI.452-54 (dryads) ; PL IX.393-95 alludes to Met. XIV. 623 ff.
