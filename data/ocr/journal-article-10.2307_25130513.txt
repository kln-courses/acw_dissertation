<plain_text><page sequence="1">The African Archaeological Review, 7 (1989), pp. 127-153 Rock engravings in the Wadi el-Barramiya, Eastern Desert of Egypt GERALD FUCHS Abstract This paper describes new rock art sites in the region east of Idfu, where at least 50 sites with several thousands of petroglyphs offer huge potential for future research. Site ET-A/WB 4 provides the largest representation of a boat yet discovered in the Eastern Desert; it is part of a scene extending over about 10 m of rock with boats, animals and human figures in procession. This scene and another one from site ET-A/WB 5 can be dated to the transition from the prehistoric to the dynastic periods. All sites in the Wadi el-Barramiya are endangered due to their location near a main road used by construction works and visitors. R?sum?

Introduction In contrast with the rapid progress of archaeological research in the Western Desert of Egypt (Wendorf and Schild 1980) and even in the central Sahara (Striedter 1983:221-43, 1984), the region between the Nile and the Red Sea has not seen major field projects and its archaeology, including its rock art, remains poorly known. The Eastern - or Arabian - Desert remained a region of economic importance even after the climatic deterioration of the third millenium BC. This is shown by mention of quarrying expeditions and mining</page><page sequence="2">128 Gerald Fuchs throughout pharaonic times (Goyon 1972), by the establishment of transit routes (Murray 1925) under the Ptolemies and their improvement in Roman times for the Indian trade, and by the presence of Roman quarries for diorite and porphyry (Kraus and R?der 1962; Kraus et al. 1967). The numerous rock engravings in the region are not exclusively prehistoric and must be interpreted bearing all these activities in mind: they are a valuable source of information, which may compensate to some extent for the scarcity of other remains like habitation sites, burials or inscriptions. An outline of early research in the Eastern Desert and in Nubia has been provided by Cervicek (1974:3-10). In the early nineteenth century F. Cailliaud, while on a journey from Redesiya near Idfu to Sikeit, recorded rock engravings at a place approximately 97 km east of the Nile Valley. He was the first to mention material of this category in the Eastern Desert, but the precise location of his discovery cannot now be identified. V. Gol?nisheff ( 1890:79) noticed engravings near the rock temple of Sethos i at El-Kanayis (Fig. 1) and A. E. P. Weigall (1909:157-8, pis xxvm-xxx) published some pictures of this site, which lay close to the second station on the ancient road from Apollinopolis Magna (Idfu) to Berenice (Murray 1925; Meredith 1953). Activities associated with its central position are reflected in the rock engravings: in contrast to the Wadi el-Barramiya sites presented here, a high percentage can be dated to historical periods, some being associated with Greek and Roman inscriptions. The engravings at El-Kanayis were documented in 1926 during the eighth German Inner-African Research Expedition (DIAFE) conducted by Leo Frobenius; publication followed nearly half a century later (Cervicek 1974:57-62, figs 249-94). Other sites documented by Frobenius' expedition in the region east of Idfu are El Kab (Cervicek 1974: 40-2, figs 155-9), Mamla - El Otuani (ibid: 71-8, figs 359-407) and Scharab (ibid: 80-7, figs 421-71, pi. 14.27). In 1935 S. Schott and J.J. Cl?re visited Bir Abbad and El-Kanayis (Cl?re 1938). Systematic fieldwork by H. A. Winkler of the Sir Robert Mond Desert Expedition (1936-7) concentrated on Wadi Hammamat and its surroundings, but was not extended to Wadi el-Barramiya (Winkler 1938). In 1960, W. F. E. Resch (1967) discovered several further sites near El-Kanayis and in the vicinity of the junction between the Wadi el-Barramiya and the Wadi el-Miya. In 1985 I revisited El-Kanayis and moved further to the east along the Wadi el-Barramiya, examining the rocky ledges on both sides of the wadi to gain an impression of the overall distribution and extent of the engravings and of their typical inventories. Only a rough reconnaissance with conrentration on selected places could be carried out. Brief description of selected sites in the Wadi el-Barramiya A more or less continuous series of sites stretches over many kilometres. Although discon tinuous where tributaries join the main wadi, elsewhere they are sometimes so close that one site merges into the next. We may estimate that the wadi contains at least 50 sites and several thousands of engravings. All of them are situated at the rocky margins of the wadi, where by lateral erosion near-vertical rock faces with heights up to 20 m have been cut into the Nubian Sandstone, with boulder heaps and screes at the base (Fig. 2). Both the bedrock and the boulders provided surfaces for engravings; in some cases subsequent movement of boulders can be demonstrated.</page><page sequence="3">y 33?E 33? 30' \?,\Jr\ \ K -~\^ V ^ 25?

Rock face on the south side of the wadi, with boulders at the base. The sites described below are indicated on the map (Fig. 1). The simple registration system employs a prefix WB (for Wadi et-Barramiya) and a serial number. Site ETA/WB 1 (25?0V N., 33?32' E.) The site is located on the south side of the Wadi el-Barramiya, at ca 290 m above sea level at a point 23.6 km east of El-Kanayis temple and 69 km from Idfu. It is within 100 m of the road. Most of the engravings are on a vertical rock facing north; a few are on nearby boulders. The figures are 10-70 cm high, mostly pecked, with some engraved or scratched. One indetermi nate animal has a pecked body and engraved legs, horns/ears and tail. The patination, according to Trost's (1981:200) grading system, varies from very dark to light. A few undiagnostic potsherds were found in the vicinity. Superimpositions, as well as the different motifs, patination and style, show that engrav ings belong to several periods. One of two giraffes - both have two legs only- is superimposed by the tusks of a small elephant; the elephant is superimposed by the line to which is tied an animal with lyre-shaped horns, apparently contemporary with a geometric human figure. Another scene, partly damaged by weathering, includes a variety of horned animals and dogs carelessly depicted in a subnaturalistic style and bearing medium light patination; later a stylised animal and the pecked outlines of a kneeling person, now only lightly patinated, were added. Into a pre-existing boat (type n of Cervicek's 1974 typology) a long-horned bovid was put, executed by hammered and smoothed contours. A single bull is hammered slightly in outline. Giraffes, ibex and antelopes (?) are present. In a hunting scene a man with a bow</page><page sequence="5">Rock engravings in the Wadi el-Barramiya 131 follows an ibex (?) with its kid, another hunter with a bow is confronting a huge antelope (?). In both scenes, the style is subnaturalistic, the patination medium light. The following pictures (Fig. 3) could be contemporary; no parallels can be given for the tapir-like animal; below it cattle and a 'square boat' with an anthropomorphic figure can be seen. Other animals occurring at this site are ibex (Capra ibex), antelopes and a falcon (Falco sp.) (Fig. 4). All the human figures are subnaturalistic to abstract in style. A man with a bow has a close parallel at the site of Gait el-Aguz (Cervicek 1974:157, fig. 164). Most of the boats occur as single pictures, a few are linked to other representations. A type v boat (Fig. 5) is superimposed on a dark-patinated animal and an ibex (right); it is superimposed by an unfinished boat. Boats of type n and v are depicted several times; there is only one type vu boat. The most interesting example is of type v (Fig. 6) with a cattle-figurehead and an anthropomorphic figure within a cabin. Site ET-A/WB 2 (25?01' N., 33?32S E.) These two sites, about 100 m apart, are on north-facing vertical rocks located on the south side of the wadi, ca 300 m from the road at a point 69.5 km from Idfu (Fig. 2). The westerly site, WB 2a, has a 60-cm pecked type iv (?) boat and an engraved hieroglyphic inscription, both with very dark patination. Site WB 2b has fairly lightly patinated pecked figures, 15 60 cm wide. There is a scene (Fig. 7) with several boats and animals depicted in a geometric style: two boats of type vu are connected by a line, and there is an anthropomorphic figure standing on board the largest boat.

Located on the south side of the wadi, 72.7 km from Idfu and ca 300 m above sea level, these engravings are scattered over an 80-m long north-facing surface and nearby boulders 50 m from the road. The hammered figures, 10-70 cm high, have patination ranging from dark to light. In a scene on the upper surface of a boulder (Fig. 8) a dog follows an ibex with kid. Other animals depicted in subnaturalistic and geometric styles are less readily identifiable, with the exception of representations of asses (Fig. 9) either wild (Equus asinus africanus) or Figure 8 Site ET-A/WB 3. Scene on the upper face of a boulder: dog following an ibex with kid. Note the fairly light patination of the worked surface in comparison to the unweathered rock (Nubian Sandstone) exposed at the broken edge of the boulder and the dark bluish-grey patination at the upper side of the boulder.

One of them is superimposed on a hieroglyphic inscription apparently associated with a carefully executed boat (Fig. 10), a variant of type xxm which is dated by Cervicek to the New Kingdom. There are further boats of type vu and two, nearly identical, of type n with standing anthropomorphic figures (Fig. 11). Figure 11 Site ET-A/WB 3. Boat of type n with standing anthropomorphic figure.</page><page sequence="10">136 Gerald Fuchs Site ET-A/WB 4 (25?02' N., 33?39S E.) The site extends over 100 m on the south-eastern side of the wadi, 50 m from the road at a point 82 km from Idfu. It is ca 325 m above sea level. The central part is a vertical or near vertical rock facing north-west: on the periphery further motifs occur in niches or on sloping or horizontal rock faces and on boulders (Fig. 12). Individual figures vary from 10 cm to 180 cm in size. Pecking is the most common technique, but scratching, engraving and rubbing also occur. Patination is very variable as a result of varying orientations, positions and ages. Even elements of the scene thought to be contemporary show grades of patination from fairly light under the overhang to dark on the convex part of the rock face with a slope of ca 80? not protected by overhanging rock. Petroglyphs, even recent ones, which are periodically covered by floods, have the same patination as the unworked rock. This is one of the most interesting sites in the Eastern Desert and no direct parallels are known for the scenic compositions incorporating boats. Superimpositions occur, but a considerable amount of the work seems to have been executed within a short period. As the selection of single pictures could not give an adequate impression of this composition, it is reproduced here in a series of overlapping illustrations (Figs 13-19). The most spectacular single representation is the huge boat of type vu (Figs 14, 15). With a length of ca 1.80 m, it is the largest hitherto discovered in the Eastern Desert. Its crew, indicated by vertical strokes, numbers 70 persons. A line leads to the left (Fig. 14) and ends with seven vertical strokes, perhaps representing people towing the boat; a similar scene is repeated beneath (Fig. 15, right side). The standard of the large boat is superimposed by a bull; no difference in patination being visible between the two representations, so if the ?fart *= :&gt;&gt; #?{{i * - :? :?; "/: t Figure 12 Site ET-A/WB 4.

The mast is superimposed on an antelope, perhaps a Saiga. Immediately above is a smaller boat of the same type containing two anthropomorphic figures: it is partly obscured by a dislocated hanging boulder. Below the large boat the first of several nearly identical scenes occurs: an antelope (Damaliscus lunatus?) is connected by two lines to a human figure. This figure, hard to see due to the dark patination, is superimposed by a long-horned bovid, not shown in Fig. 15. A similar representation from the site of Kagug-Schibeika has been published by Cervicek</page><page sequence="12">?0mW ""% 1%. ?pifiad is AH' Figure 15 Site ET-A/WB 4; cf. Fig. 14.</page><page sequence="13">Rock engravings in the Wadi el-Barramiya 139 (1974:fig. 236). Other animals include wild asses (Equus asinus africanus), ibex, antelopes and cattle. A type vu boat (Fig. 16) with a crew of ca 30 people is elaborately decorated with a theriomorph standard and a figurehead apparently representing a horned quadruped guided by a man. Above it, a complex scene continues to the right: two asses are accompanied by two persons; on top of the larger animal are two human figures with feather (?)-ornamented heads; to the right two small animals (dogs?), an archer, a recent horse and a recent Arabic inscription can be seen. The lines leading from the asses to the right end at a horned animal from where a single line further continues over Figure 17 to a boat (Fig. 18). Completing the description of Figure 17, we may draw attention to the human figure below the line guiding an animal (crocodile?) attached to lines. Above, another person holds an antelope, followed by a flock of other beasts; four of them are more lightly patinated, probably having been added later. The boat in Fig. 18, of type n, bears ornaments on stem and stern; the standing anthropomorphic figure is of exaggerated size. Further to the right the compostion includes asses with kids, antelopes and ibexes. A rider on horseback and a camel were added considerably later. On board a type v boat (Fig. 19) an anthropomorphic figure stands with raised arms. Animals follow: asses, antelopes including Saiga (?) and a bird. Once again the scene of a man holding an antelope (Damaliscus lunatus?) occurs and is repeated further to the right (Fig. 20) between boats, as well as animals of the species already mentioned and human figures.

A selection of the most interesting pictures situated away from the main rock face includes representations extending in date from the earliest period to the present. Giraffes (Fig. 21) are superimposed on antelopes (Damaliscus lunatus?)', the picture of a feline could be contemporary with the latter. Of different types of boats may be noted a 'sickle boat' (Fig. 22) with a cabin built amidships and stem and stern heavily drawn back as in examples cited by Winkler (1938: pi. xxxv, 28, 29). A boat resembling types v and xv (Fig. 23) is remarkable for its theriomorph figurehead and for a standing human figure.</page><page sequence="16">142 Gerald Fuchs Figure 21 Site ET-A/WB 4.

An ostrich in quick motion seems to be the earliest picture; two antelopes (Saiga?) are carefully incised and rubbed smooth. Ajackal (?) follows a larger antelope.

Recent engravings. Site ET-A/WB 5 (25?02' N., 33?40' E.) This site comprises two rock shelters on the south side of the Wadi, 30 m from the road at a point 83 km from Idfu and ca 330 m above sea level. Petroglyphs occur in various places on the walls, floor and ceilings of the rock shelters. Most of the motifs, 10-60 cm in size, are pecked but a few are engraved and one rubbed smooth. Patination varies, according to age, position and exposure, from very dark to very light. A few potsherds, probably recent, were found nearby. W. F. E. Resch (1962, 1967: pi. 18) has published a photo graph from this site, designated simply 'Wadi el Baramiya', but it is not shown on his distribution map. A scene on a steeply inclined rock face is composed of several boats of type vu (Resch 1967: pi. 18), together with a man hunting antelopes and ibexes; it continues to the right (Fig. 28) with more ibexes, giraffes, small indeterminate animals, a small boat with a figure raising its arms, geometric human figures and a bird. Other pictures include a type n boat with a cabin and two standing anthropomorphic figures with ornamented heads (feathers?), a hip popotamus, antelopes, oryx(?), a falcon, a snake, abstract signs and recent Arabic inscriptions. In another scene (Fig. 29) archers are hunting ibexes and antelopes (?) with the aid of dogs surrounding the game. The stylistic variations observable in the representations of the hunters - from realistic to geometric - demonstrate the need to be cautious whenever style is considered to be characteristic of a specific period.</page><page sequence="20">146 Gerald Fuchs rt?tili "' ' ??El JilS l?llP^ -f '^.;Pi!: 111 Figure 28 Site ET-A/WB 5.

Hunting scene.</page><page sequence="21">Rock engravings in the Wadi el-Barramiya 147 Dating The present state of research In Egypt we have a good database and excellent possibilities for linking the petroglyphs with prehistoric and early dynastic cultures in the Nile Valley by formal analogies and parallels concerning the motifs and often their deeper meaning. It is necessary to view them in the context of climatic and ecological changes, the development of cultures and the role of the Eastern Desert during later periods, and also in conjunction with the results of detailed site studies including an evaluation of the evidence from superimpositions, patination, motifs and style. At present we are far from achieving this objective: here, the present state of research may be outlined. G. Schweinfurth (1912) was the first to deal with the problems of dating Nile Valley petroglyphs in a systematic way; he recognised the importance of patination for this task and its difficulties. His five-period system including a prehistoric group of engravings and four later periods is still valid in general terms. H. A. Winkler tried to split the group of prehistoric engravings into five (Winkler 1937) and then into four (Winkler 1938) subgroups, relating each to a different ethnic population and a different period. His methodology was unsuccessful and his database too small. Despite these problems, Resch (1967) believed that Winkler's system could be maintained in a slightly modified form. P. Cervicek, working with the material collected during the eighth DIAFE in 1926, presented a new chronological system based on detailed analysis and numerous comparisons with other archaeological materials from the Nile Valley. Three periods were distinguished (Cervicek 1974:98M99, 1978): 1 from the second half of the fourth millenium to the middle of the third millenium BC, 2 from the second half of the third millenium until about 1000 BC, 3 from the early first millenium BC to the sixth century AD. New evidence from the Wadi el-Barramiya sites We may now compare the evidence from the new sites studied here with Cervicek's chronological system. In general a close accord is apparent whenever sufficient evidence is available. Site ET-A/WB 1 According to Cervicek's chronology, boats of types n, v and vu can be dated to the late prehistoric and early dynastic periods. Giraffes, antelopes, ibexes and cattle may have been depicted in the same period; they include superimpositions (cattle over elephant over giraffe) without noticeable differences in patination. For the wild faunas an earlier date could be argued. A later period is represented by animals and people in a more geometric style and a rather light patination.</page><page sequence="22">148 Gerald Fuchs Site ET-A/WB 2 The type vu boats and the animals (Fig. 7) with a rather light patination should be dated to the early dynastic period, the upper limit given by Cervicek. The darkly patinated type iv(?) boat could be prehistoric. Site ET-A/WB 3 The variant of a type xxm boat (Fig. 10) can be dated to the New Kingdom; it is placed next to a hieroglyphic inscription. Type n boats (Fig. 11) occur from late prehistoric to early dynastic times; the fairly light patination matches the light unworked rock surface and cannot be considered as clear evidence against this date. Boats of type vu are very abundantly represented in the region and were executed over a long period, overlapping in part with boats of type n. The animals are not very distinctive in style but probably range in date from the prehistoric period to the New Kingdom. Site ET-A/WB 4 Again boats give the most reliable chronological indications. The occurrence of types n, v and vu in the main scene is valuable as their differing dates overlap in the late prehistoric/ early dynastic period which may be proposed as the date for all the contemporaneous representations in this scene. The evidence from this site offers some degree of confirmation of Cervicek's chronology for these types of boat. Superimpositions may be noted, but their significance for dating is limited. The giraffes superimposed on antelopes (Fig. 21) belong to an early period, but difference in absolute age cannot be quantified, patination being dark in each case. For pictures added much later a very light patination is common. Horses with or without riders do not occur before the middle of the second millenium BC, camels probably not much earlier than the beginning of the Christian era. Patination and style make them easily distinguishable from prehistoric and early dynastic petroglyphs. Site ET-A/WB 5 The presence of type n and vn boats in one scene again permits us to date it to the transition from the late prehistoric to the early dynastic periods: the combination of faunas and style are also similar to those at site ET-A/WB 4. These facts may be considered as additional arguments for supporting our chronological classification. Discussion Problems In an attempt to make a systematic comparison of the Wadi el-Barramiya material with that published from other sites in the region, problems arise due to the incomplete coverage of research, uneven quality of documentation and varying criteria used for the documentation of selected pictures or sections of larger scenes.</page><page sequence="23">Rock engravings in the Wadi el-Barramiya 149 Frequently data are unsuitable for processing and the application of statistical techniques. The principles and methods of interpretation outlined by Striedter (1983:3-12, 22-44) represent an extremely important approach to these problems, and emphasise the need for a high-quality database. The task is further complicated by our present inability to establish a detailed chronological framework. The following critical statement touches the core of the problem and suggests the limits of interpretation: Genau genommen, wei? man so gut wie nichts ?ber ihre Urheber noch ?ber die Umst?nde, unter denen sie entstanden sind. Verst?ndlicherweise war man bem?ht, dieses Dilemma zu unterlaufen, indem man versuchte, mehr oder weniger intuitiv die Inhalte des Dargestellten zu erfassen, oder indem man zur Deutung der Felsbilder Beobachtungen heranzog, die in rezenten Kulturen gemacht worden waren. Solche Interpretationen m?gen im einzelnen richtig sein, doch die Wahrscheinlichkeit, da? sie falsch sind, ist mindestens ebenso gro?. Selbst wenn man geneigt ist, manche dieser Interpretationen zu akzeptieren, mu? man sich dar?ber im klaren sein, da? man eher 'Bedeutungen' in die Felsbilder hineinprojeziert, als da? man solche aus ihnen ableitet (Striedter 1983:22). Interpretation of site distribution The distribution map of rock art sites in the Eastern Desert and in the Nile Valley (Resch 1967) reflects research activities, itineraries of expeditions, the existence of suitable rocks and probably the geological structure; it cannot be expected that it shows the real distribution of sites, nor their numbers. The new sites of Wadi el-Barramiya are the easternmost in this wadi system and represent a locally relevant change of the pattern, but do not alter the overall distribution. The northern limit of the art is marked by the line from Qena to Safaga, many sites being situated along the Nile Valley. With increasing distance from the river, sites seem to become less abundant and to discontinue near the watershed between the Nile and the Red Sea; no sites are mapped on the Red Sea coast. (The one exception is in the region south-west of Berenice including the sites of Abrak, Aigat, El-Beida, Gait el-Aguz, Magal Hodein, Wadi Abu Agag etc., which are distant from the Nile and nearer to the Red Sea.) Cultural affinities can be demonstrated between early rock art and the Naqada culture (Cervicek 1974:200), especially in the representations of boats discussed below. The apparent absence of rock art sites near the Red Sea coast may be real and indicate that the watershed marks a former cultural, maybe territorial, boundary. This assumption has to be tested further. When we examine the published data relating to the location of rock art sites, we observe that about 90% are situated along wadis or the Nile Valley, and that 85-90% are located in the area of the Nubian Sandstone. It would be plausible, therefore, to propose that the distribution of the petroglyphs depends primarily upon the availability of suitable rock. However, while the geological structure clearly has some influence on the distribution of sites, it does not determine the overall pattern, nor is it responsible for their eastern limit. A preferable explanation is one which emphasises the Nile Valley affinities outlined above. It so happens that a large part of this area is of Nubian Sandstone. Unlike the first model, this one provides an explanation for the absence of rock art sites near the Red Sea coast. The distribution of sites mainly along wadis is not likely to be seriously modified by further research and requires close examination. Wadis may be considered natural routes for the movement of people, herds and goods. But their decisive importance derives from their role</page><page sequence="24">150 Gerald Fuchs as habitats under slightly wetter climatic conditions such as may have occurred during several phases of the Neolithic period, when they would have provided vegetation, water and other resources required for nomadic pastoral communities. Higher precipitation rates affect the wadi systems by the concentration of runoff to a higher degree than mountains or highland plains, with direct implications for changes in the different ecological zones. We do not have adequate data to discuss these themes in detail, but it is clear that we cannot simply transfer the results from the Western Desert (Wendorf and Schild 1980) to the Eastern. The former is today a hyperarid region, whereas annual precipitation rates in the Eastern Desert may reach up to 70-100 mm. Similar differences may have occurred in the past. The reconstruction of climatic conditions from faunal assemblages depicted is complicated by several factors which must be carefully considered, notably: 1 problems of dating accuracy 2 the fauna depicted cannot be expected to form a representative sample (e.g. sheep and goats are rarely represented in the petroglyphs, but must have been economically - important) 3 species considered to be characteristic for different 'periods' (e.g. giraffes, cattle) may have existed in a similar environment and even at the same time 4 animals depicted at a particular site could include species from another environment 5 representations from a site need not be typical of its immediate surroundings. (For this last point ample evidence may be cited from the Wadi el- Barramiya sites.) Distribution of specific motifs The numerous representations of boats quite often occurring far from the only navigable river, are the best example of subjects separated from their expected surroundings (category 5, above). Their frequency decreases from the north to the south; estimates based on published data are not precise, but they indicate the order of magnitude (Cervicek 1974:98). Boats as single pictures and scenes including boats represent the following percentages of the total petroglyphs: 40% in the Wadi Hammamat and surroundings 20% in the Nile Valley between the First and Second Cataracts &lt;10% in the Nile Valley north of the Second Cataract &lt;1% in the Nile Valley close to the Second Cataract. The Wadi el-Barramiya sites fall into the first zone, probably exceeding the rate of 40%. Although a detailed calculation has not been undertaken, there is no reported site without boats. Interestingly, this first zone, characterized by the highest frequency and quality of boat representations, probably does not extend into the Nile Valley. No explanation for this phenomenon can currently be offered. The evidence provided by the boats for extensive and frequent contacts with the Nile Valley makes it probable that other features of the same origin may be present. They are more difficult to detect, but could include various animals adapted to a river or lake environment, for example crocodile (? Site ET-A/WB 4, Fig. 17), hippopotamus (Site ET-A/ WB 5) and waterfowl (Cervicek 1974:173, 179, 189). Such representations are rare (&lt;1%),</page><page sequence="25">Rock engravings in the Wadi el-Barramiya 151 and the majority of animals are typical of a steppe-like environment; so the assemblages from the new sites are not significantly different from those elsewhere in the region. Selected motifs Taking a sample of the Wadi el-Barramiya rock engravings, we will primarily concentrate on the boats and on representations associated with them. A high percentage of the boats (Winkler 1938:35-9, pis xxxiii-xli; Cervicek 1974:98-138) show distinctive features charac teristic of certain types of vessel. Prominent anthropomorphic figures are distinguished by size and more elaborate work; the crew is indicted by vertical strokes only. Figures with arms akimbo occur on boat types n, in, iv, v and vu (Cervicek 1974:117). We can present examples for types n, v and vu (Figs 3, 7, 11, 14), in one case each together with a figure raising the arms (Figs 14, 15), with ornamented(?) head (Fig. 23), characterized by symptoms of false steatopygy without the typical gesture (not illustrated), together with a second figure on board. Those with animal-like heads or masks (?) have been reported from other sites (Winkler 1938:pls xxxvu. 52, xxxvm. 62), but the evidence is ambiguous. The gesture is interpreted as a dancing posture. Figures with raised arms on boat types n (Figs 14, 15, 28) and v (Fig. 19) seem to indicate the deformed horns of a cow (?); this has been interpreted as the deity later identified with Hathor. Animal figureheads and/or standards with or without human figures amidships occur on boats of types v, v (variant) and vu (Figs 5, 6, 14?16, 23) and show many variations. A figurehead in the form of a bird's beak (Fig. 18) is unique, as is the anthropomorphic figurehead (not illustrated). According to Cervicek, type v boats occur in the archaeological record as models from the third dynasty onwards, but the rock pictures seem to be earlier. A representation at El-Kanayis (Cervicek 1974:141, fig. 289), showing the pharaoh with the Upper Egyptian crown on board, can be interpreted as the important religious act of the king's voyage through the country. At site ET-A/WB 4, the most interesting scenes are those where boats are connected by lines to groups of human figures and animals (Figs 14-18). The lines may be interpreted as ropes or as abstract mental links to make a context evident. Similar representations (e.g. antelopes guided by people) in the vicinity of the boats are also integral to the scene. This large composition constitutes a great procession with people, animals and boats involved (not a single 'normal' boat occurs); its meaning remains unclear. For most of the other scenes (hunting scenes, herds of animals, riders on horses and/or camels) and single pictures numerous parallels can be found, most of them at sites situated in the region of Idfu. At present this area cannot be considered as a distinct region within the larger east Egyptian and Nubian 'rock-art province', but the distribution of certain motifs (e.g. asses, some kinds of boats, etc.) and their more frequent occurrence compared to neighbouring regions may be noted. The 'great procession' at site ET-A/WB 4 is unique in the whole Eastern Desert. Concluding remarks I hope that this presentation of a few sites from Wadi el-Barramiya gives an impression of its potential wealth and scientific significance. These sites are endangered. As a result of their</page><page sequence="26">152 Gerald Fuchs locations quite close to a main road any construction works may cause direct and indirect damage; at some places visitors have traced the pictures by chalk, charcoal, enamel paint or scratched the surface injuring patination. Site ET-A/WB 4 could be totally destroyed by the extension of a nearby quarry. For these reasons a complete documentation of the Wadi el Barramiya sites is an urgent task, which should be carried out as soon as possible. One aim of this paper is to draw attention to the problems.
