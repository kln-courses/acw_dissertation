<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Socialist Popular Literature and the  Czech-German Split in Austrian Social  Democracy, 1890–1914 Jakub Beneš In 1897, a fi ft een-year-old Czech villager named Vojtěch Berger found work on  a construction site in Vienna. Originally from the tiny south Bohemian hamlet  of Todně, Berger lived primarily in the Habsburg capital from 1897 to 1914,  becoming a trained carpenter and a convinced socialist. During his Vienna  years he also began keeping a diary in which he recorded various aspects  of his life, including conditions on job sites, his political opinions, and what  he read.1 Berger’s diary reveals that as he became more committed to socialism, he  became a more self-conscious and fervent Czech nationalist. His increasingly  nationalist opinions paralleled a discursive shift  in the proletarian popular  fi ction and verse that he read on a regular basis: a shift  from the idea that  workers were unjustly and hopelessly excluded from their respective, seem- ingly elite-oriented ethnonational communities to the notion that workers  could and should righteously lead their ethnic nations. Czech and Austrian  German socialist popular literature did much to shape and legitimize workers’  new stance toward the nation, which hastened the splitting of late Habsburg  Austria’s vast Social Democratic movement along ethnic lines in the fi nal de- cade before World War I. These pages will show how this eff ect of popular  literature worked against national reconciliation. This article is also more broadly about how the socialist workers’ move- ment in east central Europe developed around 1900, not—as has oft en been  thought—as an antidote to nationalism, but as a vehicle for it. In the years be- tween Austrian Social Democracy’s 1890 emergence as a mass political force  and the outbreak of World War I, socialist popular literature provided a dis- cursive fi eld on which a specifi cally working-class brand of nationalism took  shape. This previously undocumented case thus deepens our knowledge of  how the working classes in the region understood, appropriated, and restyled  nationalism on their own terms. On a more fundamental level, I argue that  such direct engagement with grassroots political culture is necessary in or- The American Council of Learned Societies supported research for this article.

A note on terminology: Where known, both Czech and German place-names are given.  To avoid awkward locutions, I sometimes use the generic term socialist interchangeably  with the party-specifi c term Social Democrat(ic) refl ecting Social Democrats’ own usage,  even though a few other parties (e.g., Czech National Socials) sometimes referred to them- selves as “socialist” as well. Under Austrian German I subsume all German speakers in the  Austrian or “Cisleithanian” half of the Habsburg monarchy. 1.

Historiography: Ethnic Nationalism in the Bohemian Lands  and Workers’ Politics in East Central Europe Recent studies of nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Czech and German  nationalisms have greatly heightened scholarly awareness of the intricacies— and limits—of nationalist politics and mobilizations. Pathbreaking works by  Pieter Judson, Jeremy King, and Tara Zahra in particular have fundamentally  recast debates by calling into question the notion that the rise of nationalism  constitutes the master narrative or organizing principle of modern east central  European history.2 They suggest that this interpretation—following historical  sociologist Rogers Brubaker—itself refl ects a “groupist” nationalist reifi cation  of ethnic nations as unitary, historical actors and should not mislead us into  confusing a “category of practice” (in this case, nationalist politics, construc- tion of national identity, or “ethnicism” in King’s phrasing) with a scholarly  “category of analysis.”3 As Brubaker has written, scholars must view nations  as a “perspectives on the world” not as “things in the world.”4 Through in- novative research, such studies have revealed how limited the national per- spective seemed at times and how nationalists tried, oft en futilely, to extend  its reach. Furthermore, they argue that, contrary to nationalists’ expectations  and aspirations, most ordinary people (especially workers and peasants but  other social strata too) long remained “nationally indiff erent” even in the face  of vigorous mobilization campaigns.5 2.

The “nationally indiff erent” were  unifi ed only by an externally imposed or imputed mentality and therefore  cannot constitute a “category of practice” in the same way nationality and  nationalism (or class) do.8 This is not to say that national indiff erence was  not an important “perspective on the world” that imprinted the late Habsburg  social world in crucial ways.9 Rather, it is to say that historians must probe  beyond the boundaries of middle-class nationalist rhetoric that articulated  both a stringent defi nition of nationalist commitment and its ostensible nem- esis, “national indiff erence” (a catch-all term for those who did not conform  to the defi nition), in order to understand how both nationalism and national  indiff erence assumed meaning among ordinary people.10 The present article seeks to do this by examining the pre-1914 popular  print culture of socialist Czech and Austrian German industrial workers.  While the specifi c meanings and uses of nationalist discourse among workers  in Habsburg Austria remain little explored, national indiff erence discourse  outside the middle classes has been charted even less. Recent historical work  has documented how nationalists deployed “national indiff erence” as a rhe- torical weapon to galvanize the putatively indiff erent and has proposed that  “tensions between nationalist aspirations and popular responses to their  demands oft en propelled political change and radicalization in modern east  central Europe.”11 But scholars have not explored the possibility that these  the Bohemian Lands, 1900–1945,” Central European History 37, no. 4 (December 2004):  501–43; and Zahra, “Imagined Noncommunities: National Indiff erence as a Category of  Analysis,” Slavic Review 69, no. 1 (Spring 2010): 93–119. 6.

Indiff erence to the ways middle-class nationalists  tried to mobilize support for their causes did not necessarily equal political  indiff erence—as Zahra and Judson have rightly acknowledged—but could pro- duce rival nationalist projects that were completely at odds with the middle- class propagators of national indiff erence discourse.13 This insight draws strength from the emphasis present-day historians  have placed on intranational competition as a driving force behind the spread  of nationalist politics and their radicalization.14 Czech and Austrian German  nationalist movements were variegated, oft en with little consensus on what  the nation meant or what its goals should be. But this point remains under- developed in scholarship on the Czech and Austrian German popular classes  and is easily obscured.15 Above all, we lack a clear picture of how more de- motic variants of nationalism looked or how powerful alternative nationalist  movements emerged. King argues that intranational political strife arose on  the one hand from institutional changes that naturalized the national out- look, such as the 1905 Moravian “Compromise” and the 1907 Austrian elec- toral reform that redrew electoral districts to refl ect ethnic borders as much  as possible, and on the other hand from the fact that the nationalist idiom  resonated with more political orientations than any other alternative.16 Much  work remains, though, to show how and why the nationalist idiom resonated  so widely.

In the rich literature on pre-1914 Austrian Social Democracy, nationalism is  commonly seen as spreading contagion-like from the bourgeoisie to the ranks  of the laboring classes as an especially insidious form of false consciousness— the product of either overpowering bourgeois-determined social and political  structures or of the growing infl uence of closet bourgeois nationalists in the  socialist movement.18 Such works capably identifi ed important structures  and leaders that permitted the Marxian socialist workers’ movement to “suc- cumb” to nationalism. For instance, they stressed that employers, mostly  German-speaking, engaged mostly Czech-speaking workers in many areas.  They also highlighted the early involvement of national-democratic bour- geois reformers in the inchoate workers’ movement in the 1860s, the promi- nence of former (or persistent) German nationalists such as Victor Adler and  Engelbert Pernerstorfer among Austrian German Social Democrats, the rise  of “revisionists” such as František Modráček and František Soukup among  Czech Social Democrats, and the ideological and institutional ethnonational  cleavages that already divided Austrian politics before socialists entered the  arena. Yet they fell short of illuminating the fundamental appeal of national- ism to ordinary Austrian Social Democrats, which resulted in the movement’s  grassroots nationalization by 1911 at the latest. The neglect of nationalism’s  cultural dynamics among ordinary workers led a historian as knowledgeable  as Hans Mommsen to label the increasingly nationalist behavior of Czech so- cialists aft er 1905 a form of “collective hypnosis.”19 This one-sided and con- ceptually foggy analysis of nationalism contrasts with the literature’s sen- sitive examination of other aspects of Czech and Austrian German workers’  social- cultural life.20 17.

This is symptomatic of a larger gap in our historical knowledge of  how workers’ and peasant movements in east central Europe became increas- ingly nationalist before World War I. Such nationalization was evident in the  1911 Austrian parliamentary elections, when Social Democratic Czech vot- ers (including Vojtěch Berger) overwhelmingly supported the newly seceded  “autonomist”/separatist party, which advocated ethnic segregation in trade  unions and political organizations.21 Czech separatism antagonized German- speaking Social Democrats, the strongest ethnonational grouping of the once  unifi ed Austrian movement, and accelerated their adoption of exclusivist na- tional positions as well. In November 1918, Austrian German cadres in Bohe- mia led the nationalist campaign for the territorial secession of the “Sudeten- land” from the newly established Czechoslovak Republic.22 Other regional examples show that workers’ pre-1914 nationalization was  not limited to the Czech-German case. In Austrian Galicia, the Ukrainian and  Polish socialist movements self-nationalized to the point that they split apart  before 1914 and even took up arms against each other in the 1918–19 Polish- Ukrainian armed struggle.23 In Russian Poland, the mainstream Polish So- cialist Party’s (PPS) commitment to independent Polish statehood (in stark  contrast to the Czech movement’s avoidance of the independence question)  opened cleavages in the fl edgling workers’ movement that produced—in ad- dition to Rosa Luxemburg’s more orthodox Marxist Social Democracy of the  Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania (SDKPiL)—an increasingly nationalist Jew- ish socialist movement (the “Bund”) and, aft er the 1906 PPS split, a stridently  nationalist PPS-“Revolutionary Faction” under Józef Piłsudski’s leadership.24  Musner, Unruly Masses: The Other Side of Fin-de-Siécle Vienna, trans.

Serious engagement with the distinct nation- alist imaginings and agendas of the working classes is missing for the Czech  and German context of late Habsburg Austria, though Karl Bahm stated it as  a desideratum and off ered a brief glimpse of what it might look like over a  decade ago.28 Following Bahm and Stauter-Halsted’s lead, this article empha- sizes the cultural and social portability of ethnic nationalism in east central  Europe around 1900. It explores how ordinary people—in this case, Social  Democratic Czech- and German-speaking industrial workers—developed a  unique and meaningful vocabulary of nationalism around the turn of the  twentieth century in east central Europe. Popular Literature in Pre-1914 Austrian Socialist Print Culture To accomplish these aims, I have mustered evidence from a wholly neglected  source base—middlebrow, working-class prose fi ction and poetry published  by the offi  cial Social Democratic press or sympathetic publishing houses.  In social-political terms, this genre was signifi cant in three ways: as an ex- tremely popular form of entertainment appearing in serialized publications  or periodicals and purveyed to a broad working-class public by colporteurs  (door-to-door book peddlers) or by ubiquitous lending libraries; as a means for  party eminences such as Josef Krapka Náchodský and Ferdinand Hanusch to  broadcast socialist party positions on issues in easily digestible form; and as  a means for aspiring working-class intellectuals such as the north Bohemian  tailor František Cajthaml from the movement’s grassroots to contribute to the  development and articulation of socialist political discourse.

Judson has shown that the Austrian German middle-class  nationalist press turned local events or skirmishes with ambiguous mean- ing into nationalist events by situating them in certain narrative structures.29  Similarly, the works addressed here provided a discursive arena in which pro- letarian authors appropriated and restyled existing narrative structures and  created new ones to emphasize diff erent nationalist events and a very diff er- ent sort of nationalism.30 In 1907, when Otto Bauer—a famous adherent of the nonorthodox Marx- ist “Austro-Marxist” school centered in early twentieth-century Vienna—pub- lished his landmark study, The Question of Nationalities and Social Democracy,  he sanctioned the shift  in working-class discourse that this article traces.31  Bauer wrote that “only socialism can give the nation full autonomy, true self- determination” and more provocatively that “drawing the people as a whole  into the national community of culture, achieving full self-determination by  the nation, growing intellectual diff erentiation between the nations—this is  what socialism means.”32 Socialist workers, in other words, possessed every  right to redefi ne their national cultures on a more inclusive basis and lead  their expanded national communities to autonomy and fulfi llment. This view  encapsulates the novel Austro-Marxist response to the nineteenth- century  “nationalities question,” which led orthodox Marxists such as Friedrich En- gels and Karl Kautsky to instead predict the melting “into thin air” of pre- viously solid ethnic diff erences under the capitalist mode of production.33 It  also demonstrates that Austrian Social Democracy did not orient itself solely  toward the creation of a sealed-off  subculture but aimed to appropriate and  remake the dominant national culture.34 But Bauer’s comment was not just  prescriptive; it also described a fundamental change unfolding before him in  the Austrian workers’ movement. The popular literary works discussed below  facilitated and helped articulate this shift , which was already underway when  Bauer published his magnum opus. Yet their authors—proletarian men and  29.

Unlike Bauer’s treatise, popular literature spoke a language that every  worker understood and straddled the boundary that scholars of socialist print  culture and socialist education reformers at the time oft en drew between “sci- entifi c” or “important” socialist literature on the one hand and “trivial” or  “belletristic” writings on the other.35 This binary distinction leaves little room  for popular fi ction and verse that broadcast socialist teachings, entertained  readers, and provided a discursive realm for articulating new party positions,  as Jiří Brabec illustrated in an exceptional study.36 Furthermore, party leaders  and socialist publishers were in practice eager to capitalize on forms and con- tent that would reach the widest readership. Between 1890 and 1914, the wid- est circulating media were newspapers and other periodicals, annual worker  calendars, and annual Mayday commemorative brochures. In terms of con- tent, popular fi ction and verse proved critical for ordinary workers’ engage- ment with Social Democracy and seem to have assumed growing importance  in the eyes of party leaders. Socialist leaders regarded newspapers as the most important form of  political agitation, and in Austria in particular, the Social Democratic move- ment grew synergistically with the expanding circulation of its most impor- tant papers.37 Thus the immense expansion of Austrian Social Democracy in  the context of the 1905 universal suff rage campaign was visible in the daily  circulation numbers of the Vienna-based Arbeiter-Zeitung (up to 100,000 from  50,000 a decade before) and the Prague-based Právo Lidu (up to 50,000 from  10,000 in early 1905).38 Historians focusing on high politics have neglected  the poetry, song, and fi ction that appeared in these papers. These oft en lured  new socialist recruits more eff ectively than the front-page articles and repre- sented voices from outside the party executive (oft en identical with the edi- torial boards of the leading dailies).39 More importantly, historians have left   largely unexamined the popular literature purveyed in the Mayday brochures  and worker calendars that were oft en published and sold in conjunction with  party newspapers or magazines.40 Less seditious than newspapers in the eyes of Habsburg authorities,  35.

Instead they showed a clear preference  for the undiff erentiated category of “belletristic” writings, including poetry,  world literature ranging from Lev Tolstoi to Jules Verne, travel literature, and  the socialist popular literature under investigation here.44 Many workers who did not, as a rule, buy books made an exception for  Mayday brochures and worker calendars and increasingly for self-contained  editions of socialist popular literature. For instance, Hanusch’s 1910 collec- tion of sentimental short stories Die Namenlosen (The Nameless Ones), sold  8,495 copies of 10,583 printed—notable fi gures in an era when only a guaran- teed success could justify an initial print run of over 5,000.45 The appearance  of periodicals devoted to disseminating such works in serialized form testifi es  to the growing popularity of the genre. The Czech “illustrated and novelistic  monthly,” Rudé Květy established around 1910, was described by one delegate  at the 1911 Czech congress as the “pride of our party” and rose in circulation  from around 3,000 monthly in 1911 to 13,000 every two weeks by 1913.46 Demographic and legal structures warranted an intense propagation of  printed texts from all genres. On the one hand, Czech- and German-speakers  in Austria were nearly completely literate by 1900 at all levels of society—a  rather exceptional state of aff airs among workers in east central Europe.47 On  the other hand, faced with offi  cial persecution and police capriciousness for  Hans Schrott, Verlag der Wiener Volksbuchhandlung 1894–1934: Eine Bibliographie (Vi- enna, 1977). 41.

Even aft er open socialist agitation was renewed in 1890, this asso- ciational infrastructure expanded, thrived, and dominated the Social Demo- cratic movement for much of its pre-1914 history. The circulation of periodicals  and the expansion of workers’ libraries within the loose network of cultural  associations remained a top priority even as leaders took bold steps from 1909  on toward organizational centralization.49 It is exceedingly diffi  cult to gauge how individual Czech- and German- speaking workers read popular literature in the decades before 1914. The his- torian must avoid what Jonathan Rose refers to as the “receptive fallacy”; that  is, trying to “discern the message a text transmits to an audience by examin- ing the text rather than the audience.”50 Yet there are several ways, beyond  sales statistics, in which workers’ reading preferences and even understand- ings of texts emerge from the archival record. First, as suggested above, a  feedback loop existed between what workers wanted to read and what social- ist publishers off ered. In 1904, for instance, the Czech party press introduced  the “People’s Library” (Lidová Knihovna) series that aimed to “provide a pic- ture of working-class life and of the thoughts that are stirring in the working  class, and further [to give] a faithful picture of class struggles, described with  the utmost faithfulness to the truth. In the easily accessible form of tales, nov- els, sketches and feuilletons [the People’s library] seeks to edify readers about  the goals and yearnings of proletariats.”51 Second, socialist party leaders and  educational reformers had almost no control over semilegal socialist door- to-door book peddling or “colportage”—the motor of book sales in working- class communities—giving colporteurs the incentive to simply sell whatever  they knew workers would buy.52 Statistics of colporteurs’ orders from the Vi- 48.

If popular literature did not neces- sarily invent nationalist positions, it certainly legitimized them in the minds  of workers. Berger, the carpenter, was an avid reader and even when unable to af- ford the socialist party membership fees, as in 1903 and 1904, he still bought  the Mayday booklet and several other pamphlets. In 1913, when he fi nally  got around to reading Marx’s Capital, he grumbled that it was very slow go- ing, each page demanding much contemplation.54 Berger availed himself of  literary classics in translation, including works by Honoré de Balzac, Victor  Hugo, Tolstoi, and others, but the most frequent additions to his collection  were editions of the People’s Library that did not require such literary ambi- tion. Most important, based on his opinions and actions, popular literature  strongly infl uenced or reinforced Berger’s developing stance toward the Czech  and German ethnic nations and toward workers’ politics. National Exclusion and National Hypocrisy Judging solely by numbers of books acquired, Berger’s favorite author was  Cajthaml, a villager from Suchomasty west of Prague who journeyed to north- ern Bohemia to become a tailor and later an autodidact working-class poet  publishing under the pseudonym “Vive la Liberté.”55 By 1913 Berger owned  fi ve of his books, not including the numerous Mayday booklets and worker  calendars that featured Cajthaml’s writings.56 Aft er embracing socialism and  serving a brief jail term in 1889, Cajthaml regularly contributed poetry and  fi ction to socialist newspapers and published no less than eight books in  the 1890s before an offi  cial Czech party press existed. His sentimental texts  harped on timeless injustices faced by the poor but also addressed a new sort  of national injustice. Specifi cally, Cajthaml captured proletarian feelings of  exclusion and resentment towards the vociferous “representatives” of the na- tion, who seemed to have little interest in their plebeian conationals. In so- cialist workers’ eyes, their neglect of the popular classes cast serious doubt on  their self-ascribed national leadership role, revealing the hollowness of their  bombastic nationalism. In the early 1890s, Cajthaml and other socialist Czech workers directed  53. Langewiesche, Zur Freizeit, 111–16. 54. AHMP, Berger, Book I, 152. 55.

Czech workers’  Austrian German comrades rejected the nationalism of a more variegated po- litical scene, which ranged from radical German nationalists on the far Right  to increasingly nationalist German liberal parties, formerly on the center-Left .  This constellation of mostly middle-class parties experienced a sharpening of  nationalist rhetoric around 1890, just as Austrian Social Democracy became a  mass political force expressly committed to internationalism. Nationalist par- ties across the spectrum vilifi ed Social Democracy for its allegedly treasonous  national indiff erence, manifest above all in its intent to place class struggle  above intranational unity. Around the turn of the century, a fi ercer version of  this argument led to the establishment of national socialist parties—the Czech  National Socials (1897) and the far smaller German Workers’ Party (1903).57  Despite these parties’ noisy and sometimes well-funded encroachments onto  the Austrian (particularly Czech) political scene, they never managed to seri- ously challenge Social Democracy’s electoral strength.58 More importantly,  the discourse of these renegade workers’ parties always stressed antisemitism  and competition between ethnic nations above competition within nations.  For most industrial workers, such hate-mongering remained an unconvinc- ing alternative, as did the antisemitic, clerical, and enigmatically nationalist  Christian Social party outside its few strongholds.59 Elite and middle-class monopoly control of established national move- ments, coupled with their seemingly insincere commitments to workers’  needs and their exclusion of workers from meaningful participation in na- tional cultural life, fostered bitter sentiments of exclusion and resentment in  the growing Social Democratic movement.60 The fact that virtually all non- socialist political camps mercilessly attacked Social Democracy added an  57.

According to annual Habsburg Ministry of the Interior reports on Die social- demokratische und anarchistische Bewegung (SDAB) from the Österreichisches-  Staatsarchiv, Allgemeines Verwaltungsarchiv, Vienna (AVA), Social Democracy was by  far the largest workers’ organization. From 1890, anarchists attracted a shrinking fringe  of workers while Christian Socials and various radical nationalist parties could only make  limited inroads among workers beyond a few artisanal trades.

Although some of the elements of this narrative pre-dated 1890, it was  not until the socialist movement’s emergence as a signifi cant political player  that popular literature had topical and practical relevance.61 Thus, in addition  to articulating and elaborating stances on various issues, popular literature  was instrumental aft er 1890 in repelling harsh attacks on socialist politics.  Proletarian autodidact writers such as Cajthaml accomplished this by allego- rizing political debates through engaging stories that conjured recognizable  everyday scenarios.62 In his 1893 book Mráčky před bouří (The Little Clouds before the Storm),  Cajthaml scorned his loosely fi ctional and deeply hypocritical “fi gures from  the national community.”63 The “Young Czech” Prague newspaper magnate  Kalický, for instance, perpetuates social injustice while calling shrilly for na- tional unity. This proud member of the Sokol, or Czech nationalist gymnastics  association modeled on the German Turnverein, greets his fellow sportsmen  fraternally—using the informal “thou” (ty) form—and ranks “among the great- est and most freethinking nationalists” in the whole city, in Cajthaml’s sar- castic words.64 Kalický is undeniably Czech—unlike Cajthaml’s model “Old  Czech,” whose preference for German language and culture is clear—but he is  willing to compromise his identity for social and economic advancement. For  instance, despite his fervent campaigning against cultural Germanization in  Czech public life, he allows the most aggressive German nationalists to place  advertisements in his newspapers. More egregiously, he sends his own chil- dren to German schools so they will learn German perfectly—an acidic retort  to the charges of “national indiff erence” that middle-class activists leveled  against working-class families who sent their children to German-language  schools for better amenities or because they had no choice.65 Yet Kalický’s hypocrisy is intended to off end readers’ sensibilities more  than his association with Germans. This becomes clear in the story’s denoue- ment, when Kalický’s unconscionable treatment of his own Czech workers  irreversibly undermines his position of national leadership. When printing  workers go on strike, Kalický fl oods the urban labor market with rural strike- breakers and then fi res the strikers one by one. The last of those fi red is the  strike leader and fellow Sokol member Brožovský, who subsequently cannot  fi nd work with any Czech employer and ultimately joins a German fi rm that  is much more responsive to workers’ needs.66 So deep is Brožovský’s disillu- sionment with the national community and its paeans to interclass solidarity  61.

Whoever would search him now  for his former nationalism would be gravely mistaken. The conduct of the  patriots/bread-givers opened his eyes and today he actively, materially, and  spiritually supports the movement of the international working class.” 67 In a diff erent volume from 1893 edited by the Viennese socialist leader  Franz Schuhmeier—the child of impoverished, proletarian parents in the   Vienna suburb of Ottakring—an unknown Austrian German poet named  J. Stauff acher brought analogous outrages to the attention of German-  speaking readers in his satirical poem, “Die Volksbeglücker” (The Tribunes  of the People): Theirs is all phraseology in the end. We rarely hear an encouraging word. And if they say: people, we shall set you free, That’s only the babble of parvenus . . .  They speak of freedom and love. But it’s not your freedom that they are crowing about. Since time immemorial it’s been like this: Many are needy and few are content . . .  People, you have earned your honest bread With sweat and travails, while desperate and worried. And what about your tribunes, the chattering class? They babble with fl ourish about freedom . . .  Saying that they are saving the fatherland.68 Besides ridiculing the nationalist “Tribunes of the People” or self-  proclaimed nationalist heroes like Cajthaml’s Kalický, working-class writers  appropriated and restyled revered national symbols. In the Czech cultural  milieu, the prize was the legacy of Jan Hus, the martyred fi ft eenth-century  religious reformer whom Czech patriots regarded unequivocally as an early  advocate of national autonomy.69 In works by socialist authors, Hus also be- came an early advocate of collective ownership and progressive taxation, as  in party leader Krapka Náchodský’s 1894 short story “Co ta lípa vypravuje”  (What the Linden Recounts). Krapka presented this soppy tale about the over- lapping social oppression and national exclusion faced by poor Czech folk  as the memory of an anthropomorphic old linden tree, which to readers was  an obvious symbol of the Czech nation.70 By letting a central emblem of the  Czech nation speak for itself and about another sacred national symbol—Jan  Hus—Krapka attempted to create a pure Czech voice that was also harshly  critical of bourgeois nationalists.

The gnarled linden tells the story of a family of nearby cottagers in the  wooded hills east of Hradec Králové/Königgrätz (a medium-size town in  northeast Bohemia) who were terribly poor, but “they were satisfi ed. They  were people of that well-known patient, fair, and pious Czech disposition.”72  The father would oft en read “solemnly” from a historical chronicle, though  he would periodically lose his concentration while reading about the Hussite  movement. At one point, he strikes the table with his calloused fi st and indig- nantly cries aloud, “that today it’s equal rights—that it’s just—when a person  toils here from childhood to ruin and doesn’t have anything as protection  against the cold—he is not even allowed that bit of brushwood from the for- est. . . . Our Jan Hus explains it well: forests, fi elds, earth, rivers, they belong to  all people and not to some lords. If only people would understand and unite . . .  and these are supposedly the children of the Hussites.”73 The self-proclaimed  heirs of the Hussites—the socially exclusive Czech national community—have,  according to this story, forsaken the (alleged) Hussite program of emancipa- tion from the ancient injustices of manorial society, representing a betrayal  more painful than the injustices themselves. Clearly allied with the poor cottagers, the narrator-linden implies a close  kinship between the essence of Czechness—embodied both by the linden and  by Jan Hus—and the honest and downtrodden poor. As in most exemplars of  social fi ction at this time, the story unfolds with misery and ends with trag- edy. The mother dies of malnourishment, and both the father, hunted as a  fugitive aft er poaching game in the wood, and later the son, broken by life in  the wider world, hang themselves in despair on the branches of the linden  tree.74 Both father and son deliberately and suggestively end their lives on a  central symbol of the Czech nation—a fi nal act of defi ance against the sham  Czech nation that provides patriotic window dressing for social injustice. Socialist popular literature also employed the less melodramatic tactic  of mocking the symbols that pompous nationalists held so dear; for exam- ple by parodying the unoffi  cial German nationalist anthem “Die Wacht am  Rhein” (The Watch on the Rhine).75 As in other political camps at this time,  song fi gured centrally in the Austrian Social Democratic milieu as a means  71.

This was especially  true in Austria, where German nationalists of all stripes sang it almost un- failingly at their events and in service of myriad causes.77 The particular ver- sion that Austrian workers encountered in the Social Democratic songbooks  around 1900, however, mocks nationalist enthusiasts as idlers who relish  bombastic phrases but are too lazy to exert themselves for their own projects  of national prestige: The watch on the Rhine, that is the title, Of the song, that is now in fashion. It is a very eff ective means, For one, who otherwise understands nothing, That is why, by sun and moon, I sing only ever the watch on the Rhine, The wi—wa—watch on the Rhine, the watch on the Rhine. Should I march forward to France, To battle in the bloody fi ght? I do not like to bore myself so, Because I will not be incommoded. I sit by my glass of wine And sing full of rage the watch on the Rhine, The wi—wa—watch on the Rhine, the watch on the Rhine . . .  I am sorry for you poor fools, Servitude causes you little anguish You are predestined to be slaves And you want to be the guardians of the land. You can only wretchedly cry The stupid song, the watch on the Rhine The wi—wa—watch on the Rhine, the watch on the Rhine.78 The “fools” referred to in the last stanza are also the “slaves” of cynical big  capital, ever keen to whip up national chauvinism as an antidote to interna- tional working-class solidarity. Implicit in both this song and Stauff acher’s  poem is that the alleged national leaders are sorely inadequate. The “Tribunes  of the People” serve their own interests and not those of the people, while the  singers of “The Watch on the Rhine” unwittingly serve callous, exploitative  capitalists. 76.

Conspic- uously unenthusiastic, however, were Czech socialists, despite the fact that  workers were certainly among the more than two million visitors to the ex- hibition (held in the working-class suburb of Holešovice) during the fi ve and  a half months it was open.80 Nonetheless, most politically engaged workers  found that the exhibition ignored their lives completely—a perception seem- ingly validated aft er exhibition planners reneged on their original intent to in- clude a working-class exhibit.81 The worker-poet Vilém David—born to a prole- tarian Prague family before being orphaned at a young age and later entering  the cabinetry trade—lyricized this sense of exclusion in his 1897 book of verse  Dojmy z výstavy (Impressions from the Exhibition).82 In the poem “Dojem cel- kový” (Overall Impression), David struck a deeply plaintive tone: There [at the exhibition] the wail of women, the groan of children, Is concealed in beauty There the sighing cry, “We are hungry!” Is never to be heard! There misery is cloaked In patriotic phrases . . .  There the poor worker clothed in rags Does not promenade! . . .  The eye exults with a gaze On those works magnifi cent; You do not see our life, Simple and poverty-stricken. There everything splendidly conceived Is veiled in a precious vestment Misery, hunger, and manifold evil— Grief only incessant. Be proud, you lords, Pique yourselves with this work! For me—I cannot— The beauty fades away! . . .  The stench and horror of factories The tears, all the yearnings! All, that the poor Czech worker Must endure! . . . 83 79.

Popular literature emphasizing the elitism and hypocrisy inherent in na- tionalist party visions gave ordinary workers a vocabulary and moral leverage  with which to justify their continued adherence to the only internationalist  party in Austria. For some years this inimical stance toward established na- tionalist rhetoric seems to have held wide purchase in the workers’ movement  and even translated into concrete action. In March 1897, for instance, the fi ve  newly elected Czech socialist deputies to parliament silenced all overtures  from the Czech nationalist camp by issuing a sensational declaration reject- ing the Bohemian “State-Rights Program” (plan for Czech federal autonomy  within the monarchy).85 Soon aft er, socialist workers registered some success  in countering the nationalist frenzy that gripped Austrian politics for months  aft er Minister-President Kazimierz Badeni proposed his infamous language  ordinances in April. Badeni’s proposal to give Bohemian Germans limited ad- ministrative autonomy but require civil servants in Bohemia and Moravia to  demonstrate profi ciency in both Czech and German languages by June 1901  elicited furious reactions from Germans across Austria, outraged at the pros- pect of being forced to learn an “inferior” language. The pro- and anti-German  nationalist aggression that ensued marked a nadir in Austrian politics. But ro- bust internationalism still generally prevailed in Austrian Social Democracy  and an autumn 1897 demonstration for national peace and reconciliation in  Prague attracted 20,000 Czech and Bohemian German workers.86 Deserving and Appropriating the Nation Yet implicit in the narrative of national exclusion and hypocrisy was the  proposition that workers were themselves better suited to lead their respective  ethnic nations. This sentiment eclipsed the discourse of national exclusion  gradually and unevenly, but the institution of democracy in Austria acceler- ated the shift  considerably. By the time all adult men could vote on more or  less equal terms in 1907, the narrative of workers’ deserving and realizing  national leadership was fi rmly established. Already with the fi rst drastically  unequal introduction of universal male suff rage in 1897—through Badeni’s  introduction of a fi ft h “curia” or electoral class—the workers’ movement dis- played a more proprietary stance toward national symbols. On 30 May 1898,  for instance, Czech Social Democrats staged their fi rst pilgrimage to Lipany to  84. Another diff erence was Austrian Germans’ close ties to Reich German socialists. 85.

Although socialist workers brawled later  that day with radical nationalist National Socials who had provocatively torn  up their wreath, the incident only emboldened Social Democrats to return the  following year and stage a commemorative event attended by 4,000 people.87  Universal suff rage—by appearing to off er the working classes the power to  reshape society—made the new discourse of appropriation an eminently be- lievable proposition in the workers’ movement.88 Examining how this narra- tive strengthened synergistically with state-level electoral reforms also adds a  crucial dimension to scholarly understanding of how the interaction between  civil society and the Habsburg state furthered ethnic nationalism.89 As Czech and Austrian German Social Democrats competed for votes in  their respective national spheres, this more proprietary stance toward national  society strengthened at the expense of commitments to internationalism.90  This also seems to have had a powerful and divisive eff ect on the thinking of  socialist leaders, who now sought to colonize the issues that their bourgeois  counterparts had prioritized. In the Czech case, this meant assuming leader- ship in the fi ght for Czech minority schools in historically German areas, such  as northwest Bohemia and Vienna.91 In the Austrian German case, it meant  resisting the Czech campaign and pressing for greater administrative central- ization in the empire along with preserving the German language’s privileged  status in the capital and state institutions.92 This also demonstrated insen- sitivity toward Austrian Slavs’ linguistic concerns and skepticism that they  could do without German leadership. Socialist popular literature normalized  if not anticipated such rising nationalism. While authors continued to under- score Czech and German workers’ common interests, these interests were now  noticeably subordinated to a specifi c national cause or conceit.

Wenzel feels pangs of social inad- equacy among the other smartly dressed journeymen and is overjoyed when  the master lends him his own outsized frock and top hat (Zylinder). En route  to a dedication ceremony for a statue of the Virgin Mary, a gust of wind blows  the hapless Wenzel’s headgear into the river, at which point a Good Samaritan  “painter” lends him his own “artist hat.” Wenzel protests that the gift  looks  like a “Sozi hat” but the painter—self-consciously parodying Christian Social  rhetoric—assures him that he is a redoubtable “Anti” who is the bane of Vien- nese “Semites” (Jews). Satisfi ed with these credentials, the gullible Wenzel  attends the dedication ceremony where he is promptly beaten up for wearing  a socialist hat that even has a red feather attached. Soon aft er, a group of  genial socialists befriend Wenzel in a pub where he is recovering from the  incident. Present is also the “painter”—an “Ober-Sozi” himself, it turns out— who off ers Wenzel a respectable job. Benevolently steered on the right path,  Wenzel fi nally has the means to court his lovely co-national Marianka and be- comes a loyal and active comrade. Although this stock Czech character with  a prototypical Czech name (the Czech version would be Václav Březina) is  won for Social Democracy, he is incapable of fi nding his own way and fi rm  German leadership is necessary to get him there.94 Zimmerman’s story was a  rare instance of an Austrian German author treating nationality issues in the  workers’ movement at all, though it tellingly suggested that the movement’s  success depended on central German leadership. Austrian German socialist competition with extreme German nationalist  parties also began to infl uence the character of popular narratives in these  years. A while aft er völkisch nationalists introduced biological racism into  their political discourse in the 1880s, some socialist authors apparently felt  compelled to keep pace and emphasize workers’ Germanic authenticity. The  highly popular 1910 book The Nameless Ones portrayed the tender and pure  proletarian child Robert Köhler as having “big cornfl ower eyes”—in Habsburg  Austria, the cornfl ower was an obvious reference to radical German national- ism and even to treasonous großdeutsch aspirations.95 And the 1912 tale Laz- arus depicted a prominent worker activist with conspicuous “Nordic” traits  like “a high forehead” and “water-blue eyes” who inspires the title character  to become a socialist.96 The author of both stories was Hanusch, who hailed  from an impoverished Silesian family of weavers, later rose through much  93.

While he was likely not a racist, his  contributions to socialist popular literature linked working-class heroes with  the physiognomic signifi ers that radical nationalists associated with German- ness. This appropriation of German nationalist iconography advanced the  claim that socialist workers most truly represented the German Volk and had  every right to claim its leadership. On the Czech side aft er 1907, the workers’ movement was attempting to  take the lead on issues such as minority school rights that bourgeois national- ist parties had long championed.97 This bid for national leadership took potent  narrative form in a book that Berger acquired in 1909, J. E. Šlechta’s contribu- tion to that year’s People’s Library entitled Život za život (A Life for a Life).98  The heartrending tale “Boj za Právo” (A Struggle for Rights) pits the German  Herr Ingwerthaler—the owner of an enamel factory in a small north Bohe- mian mountain town—against Křemen, one of his Czech workers, who defi es  Ingwerthaler’s decree that all his employees send their children to the German  school. Facing dismissal, eviction, and starvation, Křemen sees Ingwertha- ler’s order as an aff ront to natural law: “now all of a sudden he [Křemen] was  supposed to abandon all his best intentions and resolve and was supposed to  act against his principles, betray himself, set himself adversely against the  natural law of self-determination of man and of the spiritual development  of nations.”99 Although Křemen’s proletarian German coworkers Schauer and  Troppauer unwaveringly support him, the story is ambivalent about the pros- pects of German-Czech relations. Not long aft er Křemen caves in to employer  pressure, his fi rst-grade son Karel dies of injuries sustained at the hands of  an abusive German schoolmaster. In the end, Křemen is out of work but resil- ient and takes his remaining family to a Czech town where two Czech work- ers, former colleagues from Ingwerthaler’s factory, help him fi nd decent work  without the threat of Germanization.100 Šlechta’s story strikingly places an industrial worker in the vanguard of an  earnest struggle for national minority school rights and in so doing appropri- ates and restyles an established middle-class nationalist trope: the “school- house siege narrative,” as Judson has described it.101 While the middle-class  narrative portrayed rural schoolhouses as outposts of national consciousness  and healthy nationalism (thanks usually to a transplanted, educated school- master/mistress) in a sea of hostile national others and vulnerable, “indif- 97.

Readers of earlier proletarian popular literature had  encountered cynical social elites acting insincerely in the name of workers  like Křemen. But the elite Czech nationalists that Cajthaml tilted against in  1893 have disappeared in Šlechta’s story, having been replaced as villains by  chauvinist Germans. The fact that some German workers were, in this story  and in reality, sympathetic to the Czech struggle for linguistic parity does not  alter the fundamental tension here between Czech labor striving for cultural  rights and German capital.102 The 1907 introduction of universal suff rage seems to have allowed these  new proprietary narratives to sink deep roots in the culture of the Austrian  workers’ movement.103 Not only did popular literature normalize socialist po- litical positions in readers’ minds, but its powerful narratives may have pro- vided ordinary workers with scripts of action. In February 1911, Berger joined  the Viennese Czech school association “Komenský,” which united Czechs  across social strata and ranked among the most important Czech nationalist  institutions in Vienna.104 Along with other newly inducted workers, Berger  tried to force the club in a socialist direction by calling everyone “Comrade,”  even though convention dictated that members address each other as “Sir/ Mister” (Pán).105 On 5 October 1911—aft er the offi  cial split of Czech and Aus- trian German Social Democratic parties—Berger and other Czech workers dra- matically forced their way onto the fl oor of parliament with a group of school- less Czech children in order to protest the recent closure of a Viennese Czech  school as well as the assembly’s vote (which Austrian German socialists sup- ported) against further funding and legal recognition for Czech schooling in  the capital.106 By 1912, Berger fi rmly believed that only socialist workers could  realize the nationalist agenda of Czech minority schooling as he revealingly  commented on the subject: “it’s really about time that workers solved the na- tional question themselves rather than leave it to the bourgeoisie.”107 The variant of ethnic nationalism emerging from the Marxian industrial  workers’ movement did not lead to alliances with bourgeois nationalist par- ties before World War I. Nor is it likely that Berger’s brand of nationalism  made much sense to middle-class Czech or German nationalists, embedded  as his opinions were in a distinctly working-class fi eld of meaning. In 1908,  for instance, he irreverently dismissed the debates among Czech nationalist  102.

The best solution, wrote Berger in his  diary, would be to drag Václav by his collar and toss him in the river.108 In  1912, he was similarly disdainful of the great Sokol rally in Prague and re- fused to attend an event where “bourgies puff  themselves up [jak se u nich  buržousti nafukují].”109 Moreover, in the years aft er 1907, conventional mea- sures of working- class political strength showed little sign of decline. The  Austrian trade-union movement with close party affi  liations continued to ex- pand steadily, and the 1911 elections saw the socialist share of parliamentary  deputies drop only slightly to eighty-two.110 This suggests that most workers  viewed the rising nationalism in the socialist movement, which splintered  it along national lines and severely limited its parliamentary effi  cacy, as a  natural extension of working-class politics. Socialist popular literature with  its emotion-laden narratives facilitated and justifi ed this profound shift .111 In examining this important case of converging socialist and nationalist  politics in east central Europe and the cultural dynamics involved in the rise  of divisive ethnic nationalism in pre-1914 Austrian Social Democracy, I have  sought to make several contributions. First, this mode of cultural commu- nication—popular literature written by proletarian “organic intellectuals”—  provided an important discursive arena for the articulation and legitimiza- tion of evolving nationalist positions.112 It is perhaps impossible to determine  whether the scripts examined here fi rst introduced or rather only more widely  disseminated socialist political positions to working-class audiences, but  given their immense popularity, the importance the socialist organization ac- corded the genre, and the prominence of the autodidact authors concerned  (oft en by virtue of their having authored such narratives), it is reasonable to  suppose that they did both. Studying the interactions between state-level  reforms—here, substantially democratizing the terms of male political partic- ipation—and understudied dimensions of civil society—here, working-class  popular literary culture—helps to reconceptualize the dynamics of Habsburg- era nationalism. Attention to working-class nationalist discourse enriches the literature  on east central European socialism and connects it to recent scholarship on  Czech and German nationalism in the Habsburg monarchy. Despite the clear  virtues of these bodies of work, they have until now been considered sepa- 108. Ibid., 55. 109. Ibid., 138. On the rally itself, see Claire E.

While one too eagerly denied the genuine  appeal that nationalism could pose to workers, the other has too readily as- sumed a broad pervasiveness of indiff erence or resistance to nationalism at  society’s grassroots. Both approaches warrant a closer engagement with how  nationalism made sense within the evolving constellations of meaning that  workers and peasants constructed as they entered the age of mass politics. The evidence mustered here contributes to our understanding of how na- tionalism and national indiff erence made sense for the Czech and Austrian  German working classes on the eve of World War I. If national indiff erence  proved a powerful rhetorical tool (both for the activists who employed such  terms and in subverted form for the populations they putatively targeted) and  reveals much about middle-class nationalist attitudes, it qualifi es rather than  eclipses the rise of nationalism as a master theme in this region’s modern  history. The ethnic nation was, to be sure, not everywhere mobilized around  1900—and powerful alternative loyalties still held for many subjects of the re- gion’s multinational empires—but it appeared in increasingly heterogeneous  forms, discourses, meanings, and debates that middle-class activists oft en  failed to understand or recognize as national. Scholars studying national- ism’s purchase have too oft en taken their words for granted. To put such views  into perspective and at the same time open new vistas on the region’s national  past, it is necessary to enter the world of people like Vojtěch Berger. </page> </plain_text>
