<plain_text><page sequence="1">I UMM DABAGHIYAH 1972: A SECOND PRELIMINARY REPORT By DIANA KIRKBRIDE The I972 season at Umm Dabaghiyah took place under vastly different conditions from the first year. An exceptionally good Spring turned the countryside into a comparatively green and flowery land. Without a single dust storm and with thunder and rain only during the evenings and nights, we were able to work without inter- ruption. These climatic changes are important to record, as within two consecutive years we have experienced two extremes which must also have been regular occur- rences when the site was occupied. The field work lasted for nine weeks, from mid-March until late May, and was followed by a further month at Baghdad when all the final drawings were prepared, a task impossible to undertake in damp tents. The excavations took place under the auspices of the British School of Archaeology in Iraq and with the aid of a grant from the British Academy. Directed by the writer, the following team took part; Miss Deidre Bowden, Messrs. Stuart Munro-Hay, John McDonald and Peter Farries, site supervisors; Mr. Neville Akroyd, draughts- man and surveyor, and Mrs. Barbara Akroyd, conservator. Sayid Ismail al-Hajara, representing the Directorate General of Antiquities, was an invaluable member of the team and a first class site supervisor. We are grateful for his hard work and genuine interest in the site. During the season we were most pleased to welcome the Director General of Antiquities, Dr. Isa Salman, when he visited the excavations together with members of his staff. Once again we express our deep gratitude to the Director General of Antiquities, to the Inspector General of Excavations, Dr. Fuad Safar and to the staff of the Directorate General for their helpful co-operation and interest. We also thank the Government officers at Hatra for their friendly help. The Excavations As is usual when a preliminary report is written immediately after the end of a season, several points made in my summary in Iraq 34 (1972) will have to be revised. Owing to bad weather, the I 97I season became little more than a sounding, but this year, with only four hours work lost, our knowledge of Umm Dabaghiyah is con- siderably enlarged. The results from I97I were reported in Building Phases, twelve in all, as worked out in our biggest trench. In addition, I suspected that three main Levels existed within the site, but designated the uppermost a possible camping site phase, with a few vestiges of small storage rooms with plastered floors. It can now be said that Umm Dabaghiyah has four main Levels, each with its own phases. The latter, of course, vary within each few excavated squares.</page><page sequence="2">2 DIANA KIRKBRIDE Most of the second season was concentrated on Levels I and II (the two latest levels), and so Levels III and IV were reached over comparatively small areas. It seems at present as if Phases 12-8 (Iraq 34 (1972), Plate I) formed the earliest settlement in other words, Level IV-and that a hitherto unsuspected Level had been founded to one side of it, its courtyards and storage bins forming Phases 6 and 7. This unexpected level is now Level III. As these two areas have not yet been joined stratigraphically, this must remain tentative for the present. We have not yet found a complete ground plan of a Level IV house, but those parts we have found confirm our impression formed last year that Level IV has the highest standard of building, as well as of artifacts, in comparison with the later levels. The illustrated example of a house (Plate IVa) unfortunately ran beyond the excavation limits, but one can see the excellent lay-out, and the well plastered walls and floors, one with traces of red paint. Witll the exception of the doorway on the left, whose left jamb was re-used at a slightly later phase, all the walls were shaved off to only a few cms. in height. It is possible that when the two areas have been joined, this house may connect with the curvilinear ones of Phase I I that were found nearby and also just above virgin soil (Iraq 34, Plate Illa). Above this house were many thin layers containing the cut down, rather flimsy walls of roughly rectangular rooms, or perlhaps yards. These are extraordinary in that a little oven or bin was built out from one corner, the openings flush with the interior wall faces, and the originally domed part sticking out beyond the walls' exterior. The floors and walls of these buildings were plastered and some bore traces of red paint. Each had been rebuilt, or the floor replastered, at least twice (Plate IVb). They form a feature that was foreshadowed in I97I (Iraq 34 (1972), Plate IVa), where similar traces were found above the Level IV house walls and formed our Phase 7. At the moment we do not know whether these strange constructions formed the very top of an original tell (Level IV), or whether they were installations belonging to Level III. The latter, so far as we know at present, lies at about the same absolute level, but that does not mean that they will connect stratigraphically. For the present, and only temporarily, they have been placed in Level III. It seems that the village contracted with each main level. Thus Level IV appears to have been the largest, while Level III, although lying partly below Level II, runs out beyond the present limit of the excavations. The walls of Level III houses had been cut off along the northern perimeter of the courtyard which, in part, ran over the top of them. All one can say at the moment is that we have one main wall running from east to west, from which a series of small rooms, each slharing a party wall, leads out to the north beyond the excavations. Part of one room with a large vessel standing in the corner can be seen on Plate Va. These rooms were well built and appear very regular in width. So far we have eight in a row, but in no case is one fully excavated as yet. It follows that Level II is somewhat smaller than III. In order to reach the lower levels on a broad scale, we have uncovered a large area of Level II and so are able to form a good idea of the central part of the village at this time (Plate I). The sketch plan shows the general lay-out, but tllere has not been time to complete it. The reason for the disconcerting lack of buildings noted in the last report, in the centre and along</page><page sequence="3">PLATE I N _ I W v x y - ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~.. north centre o th c a o e t'~~~M DAAHYH LEELI</page><page sequence="4">UMM DABAGHIYAH I972 3 the apex of the tell, is accounted for by the presence of the very large central court. This area remained an empty space throughout Levels I and II. In Level III some ovens were built on part of it, but in the main it seems to have been kept empty throughout the last three levels. As far as we know at present, Level IV buildings underlie the southern half and the adjacent walled enclosure. When Level II was founded, the walls of the earlier buildings were shaved off and, in some cases, re-used as bases for the new houses. The whole central area was paved with clay slabs heavily tempered with vegetable material, laid as a kind of pavement of about 15 x I2 m. For the sake of clarity only some indications of these paving slabs are shown on the sketch plan. Houses were built at the east and west ends and continued in part down the north side. Along part of the south side, the central portion, a walled enclosure was built directly on part of the pavement. This was a long, rather narrow enclosure; its full length and entrance have not yet been found, and the south wall was re-used in part during Level I, the latest level. The purpose of this enclosure is unknown, although one might hazard a guess that it might have been used to keep the smaller domestic animals safely inside the village should need arise. A very big wall founded originally during the earliest period and right on virgin soil, and with a neat pit dug into bedrock at the base, lies parallel to the walled enclosure and nearly five metres from it (Plate Vb). This wall seems to have been built up during each period, and remained in use throughout the life of the village (Plate VIa). A series of trenches were put out at the end of the season to find if there had been a village wall, and also to see the extent of the settlement. Certain evidence points to village walls being present, but not whether they encircled the whole area or whether backs of houses were also used over part of the perimeter. The houses of Level II were not so well built as those of the earlier levels, although there was nothing haphazard in the lay-out of the village as a whole. The house at the west end of the court (Plate VIb), had various small rooms opening off a central corridor. They were probably storage rooms, as larger ones ranged to the north and containing various domestic fittings such as pottery and ovens, were probably residential. Floors and walls of this house were plastered, and one coat showed traces of red paint. The houses on the east side of the court did not have plaster except in rare cases. This Level II village showed signs of having been deserted; the ceilings of several houses had collapsed, and an unexpected number of complete pots were found (Plate VIIa). From the ceiling fragments it appears that they were made in the same way as they are today in the country districts of Iraq. A reed mat, with a specific weave, the same now as then, was laid over the rafters and above this, resting on it and taking the imprint of the weave, a thickish layer of gypsum. The roof itself was of packed mud and the whole roof structure carried by beams that must have been imported from a wooded area. Nowadays clay and not gypsum is usually placed over the mats. The uppermost village, Level I, has been largely eroded, but around the perimeter of the court, and sometimes founded directly on Level II walls, we have some wall stumps right on the surface and the floors just below. Once again the village seems to have been deserted, probably for good, for a number of pots and some very fine</page><page sequence="5">4 DIANA KIRKBRIDE stone vessels were left in situ on the floors. This level also contained a number of gypsum basins, a feature not yet found in the earlier levels. Outside the houses of the various levels, but generally not in the main courtyard, were numbers of the curvilinear domed ovens or storage bins, some with foundations of sherds below their floors, and almost all shaved down nearly to the floors. One domed oven belonging to Level III was founded on top of two earlier walls from two phases of Level IV (Plate VITb). The plastered door jamb on the left is part of the house shown on Plate IVa. It was re-used at a slightly later date for a room, or perhaps oven, which runs under the baulk. The oven uses both these walls. The exterior face of one wall has been cleaned down to show the strips or slabs of clay of which it was made. Some of these early walls give the impression that they were made of clay shapes resembling mud bricks, (Plate.VIIIa), whereas those of the later were more often made of tauf. In addition to the Moslem and Parthian graves and pits that covered the top and eastern end of the tell, we found five more crouched burials. Once again, with a single exception, they had no grave goods by which to date them. The single excep- tion was buried with a large, pierced marine shell near the face. As this is not diagnostic, I still presume that these burials belong to the Hassuna/Samarra site some 200 m. away. These burials were without any particular orientation, and the graves were neat oval shafts, cut down from the top, and about I * 50 m. deep. When allowance for the almost total erosion of Level I has been made, they must have had originally a depth of some two metres. If these burials are Hassuna, then their depth comes as a surprise, but this may be the first time that such shafts have been dug individually. The Finds Once again this brief description of the finds is based on field-sorting and not prolonged study. The Small Finds (Plates II, VIlIb, IXa-d). Most types of small finds were described and adequately illustrated in the previous report, and here it is necessary only to mention a few points. It seems that the inhabitants of Umm Dabaghiyah were so hard up for stone in their inhospitable environment that they made a fairly large proportion of their beads of baked clay, which they subsequently burnished. Two more torsos of female figurines confirmed last season's impression that this type was modelled without arms. No animal figurines have been found yet. Many ground stone axe-heads were present; again, in this stoneless area they may well have been imported finished. Some have polished bits, and others are wholly polished (Plate IXc). They vary in size, but are generally small. In contrast to the first season we found some fine stone vessels in a Level I house. The oval alabaster bowl is at present unique at the site (Plates II, I ; VIlIb), but it resembles those from the earlier levels at Tell es-Sawwan. It was accompanied by two pink-veined limestone jars (Plates II, 2, 3 ; IXd) and some coarse pottery vessels that were too brittle to remove intact. Presumably the weight of tractors and ploughs, not to mention combine-harvesters, over the surface only a few centimeters above has crushed them in situ. The stone vessels found this year, although mostly</page><page sequence="6">PLATE II 18 12 13 1 .1 | 'I - -.4 5 6~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~1 1K _ 12 3~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~1 IR 3~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~I</page><page sequence="7">PLATE III 2U 5 6( },,i,, ~~I j N 9~ ~! __ ! 10 11 9 .. ... 13 12J 15 1 _14 _ _16 18 19 20 21 22 23 A selection of sherds with applied decoration, nos.

The whole range is illustrated, and although only one other complete specimen (Plate II, 4) was found in Level II, it can be seen that this jar shape was repeated throughout the deposit; Plate II, 6, was found in Level IV. In addition, we found sections of various open stone bowls (Plate II, 5, 8, Io), and a miniature (Plate IT, 9). These finely polished pink and cream veined limestones were also found in the form of large and heavy beads, one of which is cylindrical (Plate IXa). A further class of ground stone object is the so-called mace-heads, which are made of basalt and polished (Plate IXb). The Pottery. (Plates II, I2-18; III ; X-XI). Our impression that the pottery from the lower levels is better made and fired, and more varied, is confirmed by the second season's results. As before, below the paved court of Level II, we began finding the painted and burnished wares. Not so many sherds of the fine burnished ware were found as before, and one gains the impression that only a few vessels were bought at the same time, probably from travelling potters, and when these were broken no more were forthcoming. Generally pottery of the same type as before was found, but now some complete (or almost so) oval bowls and many sherds thereof must be added (Plate II, I7, I8). We also found base sherds with scars such as indicate that tripod legs had originally been attached, although we have not found any legs yet (Plate II, I6). Tripod legs were found at Thalathat in Level XV, which shows so many similarities to Umm Dabaghiyah that they must be considered the same culture. We found more ex- amples of high ring-bases, or low pedestals (Plate II, I5), and more fragments of husking-trays (Plates II, I4; Xc), the latter being confined to the later levels so far. A new feature is shown by a section of a shallow oval dish with herring-bone incisions across its interior (Plate Xd). Vessels with a hole pushed through the wall either just below the rim, or through the rim itself form another early feature noted also for Hassuna Ia and Thalathat XV (Plate II, I3). Painted Wares. The number and types of painted decoration have been slightly en- larged, but complete vessels are very rare. Most startling of the selection illustrated is the large vessel with both stripes and dots, which also has applied knobs (Plate III, 23). It is this kind of decoration, taken into conjunction with the applied full- face animal heads, that seems to anticipate Halaf. In my report on the first season I stated that painted chevrons were not found in the lower levels. This must now be revised, as they occur throughout the lowest deposits. Applied Decoration (Plates III, i-8; Xa, b; XIa-d). The range of applied decoration was increased in the second season by the presence of what may best be described as figurines applied to the pottery. In the case of human figures, we have the head and shoulders of a female (Plates III, 5 ; XIa, upper), and the full length figure with outstretched arms (Plates III, I ; XIa, middle right). A sherd with an almost identical figure to the latter came from Thalathat XV. In addition we found com- binations of knobs with ridges or crescents, some of which might be eyes and eye- brows (Plate XIb, left and centre). The decoration on Plate XIb, right, is enigmatic. It may be a broken human figurine applied front-face forming an anthropomorphic jar. The protrusions could be a breast with an arm beneath, the classic rendering of the majority of female figurines of this time.</page><page sequence="9">6 DIANA KIRKBRIDE Applied animal figures constitute the most fascinating element of all, and their numbers suggest the reason why we have found no animal figurines as yet. As with the human figures, we have seen that very many examples of rams' heads (Plate XIc), and some goats' heads, were applied full-face to the pot (Plate XId), and very finely modelled too. We now have a possible bucranium, unfortunately broken (Plate III, 3). Sherds with whole animal figures applied are a new feature. This was an experiment that called for perspective. The bull's head (?) (Plate III, 2) has the horns in perspective. The almost complete figure of a pregnant horned beast feeding (Plates III, 8 ; Xa) also had the horns in perspective, but the legs proved difficult, so it was given one in front and one, presumably, at the back. On the other hand in two more cases the perspective, if it was tried, has not worked, and we have examples of stick animals (Plates III, 4, 7; Xb). In addition many more examples of knobs, crescents, ledges and coffee-bean eyes were found. Incised Ware was very scarce. A few crosses, triangles and zig-zag lines were found (Plate II, I 2) . This roughly incised ware has not yet appeared earlier than Level II. Chipped Stone Industry. Nearly 4,000 pieces were sorted in the field. No essential difference in the types of tools was noted, except that arrow-heads tanged and without pressure flaking were found. They are of a western type, different from those illustrated before, but contemporaneous. Plants and Animals Extremely little additional plant material was found during this second season. Dr. Hans Helbaek has looked at it and could pick out only a few fragments of lentil and one seed that, although without specific criteria, could hardly be anything but a pea. Since neither of these plants can be grown in the dry steppe without irrigation, and since the topography and hydrology does not allow irrigation, these leguminous seeds must have been imported from areas with a higher precipitation. The faunal remains from both seasons have now been identified by Dr. Sandor Bokonyi. His preliminary report is appended to this. Conclusion From the results of this second season at Umm Dabaghiyah, many different aspects of the life of this village, situated as it was on the very fringe of the possibility of dry-farming, have been glimpsed. The botanical, faunal and geomorphological reports, together with my own conclusions, tend to show that no significant climatic change has taken place in that area during the last eight millennia. The people of the village were very poor. They grew what wheat and barley they could and kept the five domestic animals common to sites of this period, namely, cattle, dog, pig, sheep and goat. Despite this poverty they must have produced a surplus in order to barter for both essentials and luxury commodities unobtainable in their neighbour- hood. Timber and stone are both essential to a Neolithic economy, and in a stoneless and practically treeless environment, we have an exceptionally clear idea of the articles present in the village that must have been brought from elsewhere.

The luxuries include such items as obsidian, marine shells, excellent stone vessels or the stone to make them, and fine pottery. One wonders what was traded in return, which was available either in the village or nearby. Unfortunately we can never know, and no more than a possibility can be suggested. Bokonyi's report on the fauna shows a very heavy preponderance of onager bones, well over 6o% in all levels. It seems reasonable to suggest that the onager not only supplied most of the meat protein for the village, but that with their hides they provided at least one valuable bartering commodity. The village is also interesting architecturally, for although we have not the full plan-for example we do not know whether the houses had individual courtyards as well as the communal one the fact that this large court and the walled enclosure occupied the centre of the village must be in accordance with a tradition of very long standing. In future, sites of this period should be excavated with this central open space in mind (at Umm Dabaghiyah the court and enclosure together cover over 200 m2), for if only a sounding is made, and that in the centre, the verdict will be as for Hassuna Ia and lowest Matarrah, that no architecture existed. By finding the plan of a village such as this, one may suggest that a large site of this period would be made up of many small ones of the same basic plan as Umm Dabaghiyah, which would probably be family units within a large town. We still cannot date Umm Dabaghiyah except on typological grounds. We can say that it is the same culture as exists, in a single building phase only, at the base of Thalathat, Tell 2, where walls built of similar clay slabs or strips are noted, as well as some practically identical sherds. The date for Thalathat, Level XV is 5570 B.C. i I 20 (TK-24. Radiocarbon i i (1 969), 513) which, in the opinion of the writer, is some- what on the late side even at the limit of its variation. We can also say that Umm Dabaghiyah is closely akin to Hassuna Ia and lowest Matarrah, and is probably present at the base of Nineveh. At the moment, then, it seems that the culture represented here is the earliest known in the northern plains of Iraq, and that its architectural traditions show evidence for a long evolution elsewhere, as do other facets of the culture.</page></plain_text>
