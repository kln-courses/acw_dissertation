<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE DATU1M AS ESSENCE 487 THE DATUM AS ESSENCE 1 THE theory that the datum of perception is a universal is shared by Messrs. Strong and Drake. It has been repudiated by the former, though not by the latter. This theory has been given in most detail, I believe, in The Origin of Consciousness, (1918), and in Mind and its Place in Nature, (1925) .2 As Mr. Stronig's book is the clearer and as Mr. Drake says that he agrees with Mr. Strong, I shall in the main confine myself to it. The theory may be briefly stated as follows. The perceptual datum is ani essence of physical entities projected by mental states into time and space. It is inexistent, but in veridical perception it is somehow "part of " the physical object whose essence it is. What the properties of essences are I shall discuss without delay, emphasiz- ing here that, as in Mr. Santayana, they are of things. This raises the problem of discovering what they are of. The things that they are of may be either physical or, in the case of introspection, psy- chical. The term "mental states" deniotes "awareness," conscious- niess of," anid the like, except that it connotes a process or activity, having presumably a beginning, a middle, and an end. What, then, are essences? To begin with, the term is obviously Aristotelian. Aristotle called that-which-made-an-object-what-it-was, its peculiar traits, its essence. Now it is clear that some of the things in the world are very simple. Instances of colors, sounds, and the like, considered in themselves, what Aristotle called " incomposites, " do not differ from one another. Red is just red and its essence is thus its peculiar color. The essence of such a thing is apprehended, said Aristotle, in what would nowadays be called "immediate knowledge" or perception. But it is also clear that the essences of many things-of all non- sensibles-can not in Aristotle's opinion be perceptually grasped, but are known otherwise, through "reflection." The essences of Messrs. Strong and Drake differ from Aristotle's. To take up their traits in the order given by Mr. Strong (Origin, 38), they are first "whatever we can think of or know, considered solely with regard to what it is, and not as existing." At the outset one is aware of an assumption which is vital to the whole theory, namely, that what we think of is identical with what we perceive, that there is no essential difference between sensation and thought. Since this assumption is not discussed by our authors, it is only just to accept it as they do, noting, however, the fact that our acceptance of t This is the fourth section of a longer study on contemporary theories which hold that the datum of perception is a universal. 2 To be referred to as Origin and Mind respectively.</page><page sequence="2">488 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY it is purely for purposes of discussion. The essence, then, is a uni- versal (Id., 39, 103), a "mere logical abstraction" (Id., 125) .3 But it is a peculiar kind of universal, in that it "is perfectly concrete" and has "even the vividness of the sensible," when it is "of the sort given in sense-perception" (Id.,.39). This can only mean that there are two kinds of essences at least, the perceptual and the non-percep- tual. But nowhere have I found Mr. Strong explaining why the perceptual essences are concrete and vivid and the non-perceptual not. "Vivid" one can understand, but "concrete" is more difficult to comprehend. Certainly it is the last word which would be nor- mally applied to a universal. The reason why the essence is a universal is that it is "indefinitely repeatable in space and time" (Id., 39). To be repeatable in space dloes not mean that the essence is in space or in time (Id., 89, 177). Yet Mr. Strong seems to admit that visual essences at least are ex- tended (Id., 99) and apparently move (lb.). In fact he speaks about "an object at a certain distance" as an essence, not about its having an essence, but about its being one (Id., 132). I should not imagine that the universal redness was extended, but obviously if it be visible, it must be extended. But if some essences are extended, wlhat does one mean by their not being in space? Does one mean aniong other things that they do not necessarily depend for their being upon a given position, or does it mean that they are not three- dimensional? After all, the former characteristic is not peculiar to essences; it pertains to any moving body. The second also pertains to particulars-any surface has only two dimensions, but is not there- fore a universal. Nor are moving bodies and surfaces non-spatial in the usual meaning of the word. Again, there are certain qualifications to be made of an essence's timelessness. Though essences are not in time, Mr. Strong admits in at least one instance-that of the negative after-image-that they change (Id., 97). The negative after-image is not the essence of a physical object; it is the essence of "a certain psychic state" (Id., 95). Nevertheless, as he says, it is an essence, for "since it is given, and only essences are given, it must be one" (lb.). He does not 3 Cf. Mind, 68. But see, however, the footnote on Mind, 8. "But of course what I am aware of may be a particular. That particular is, then, my ' datum,' the essence 'given' to me. The term 'essence' need not be contrasted with the particular, or the concrete, or indeed with anything. The class of essences is the inclusive class, covering anything that can be mentioned. " Surely Mr. Drake is exaggerating. If essences include everything, like Mr. Holt 's "being," they connote nothing and it is no more enlightening to say that perceptual data are essences than it would be to call them "beings." In other words, the term becomes meaningless. The footnote concludes, "We are, indeed, aware of par- ticulars, and of actually existing particulars. "</page><page sequence="3">THE DATUM AS ESSENCE 489 assert, as Mr. Santayana seems to in analogous cases, that the changes in the negative after-image are a series of discrete essences; he says, on the contrary, " While we observe the after-image, it goes through a course of chaniges-it gets less and less brilliant, and then becomes dark'" (Id., 97). It is, then, not timeless, so that it becomes an ex- ception to the rule that essenses are out of time. Mr. Strong does not appear to be aware of the danger of this exception; he makes no attempt to explain it away, which is courageous, but fails to see that some such explanation is necessary if its lack is not to invalidate the whole theory. In what sense does a negative after-image differ from any normal veridical percept? Only in the conditions under which it occurs. But these conditions are not given in immediate percep- tion and the reason why we are led to investigate the special nature of such phenomena as negative after-images is that they do not differ in appearance from veridical content. We have seen that the essence is a datum, or more strictly that all data are essences. Yet Mr. Strong also maintains that (in spite of their sensible vividness) they " are mere intent, " "not sensible facts " (Id., 179). All data are essences, but we learn to our surprise that "a datum is everywhere a physical property or state" (Id., 93); surely an ambiguous clause; that one of the requirements of logic is that the "object" must be "directly known" (Id., 188) in order to avoid subjectivism and representationism; that "the great funda- mental illusion" is "mistaking the essence for the object" (Id., 191); that in introspection "the self is not only the true but the sole datum" (Id., 105). Essences are normally essences of things not themselves, the qualities of objects, which permits Mr. Strong to feel at least as realistic as Mr. Dawes Hicks. But sometimes there are essences of nothing, floating qualities which our minds pick up as their antennae brush them. This permits Mr. Strong to account in a way for error. He wavers restlessly between these two points of view: sometimes he writes as though there were no "direct vision" of an essence's ob- ject; at other times he writes as if an essence were one of the object's "parts." For instance, he speaks of the possibility "for an essence to be given which is really the essence of the object. When this is so, cognition is at once direct and true" (Id., 41). Again, "Because what we are conscious of is the essence, this unizversal, which may be identical with the essence of the object, we are able, despite the ex- ternality of the mechanism, to contemplate-precariously, as I have said-the true inwardness of the object" (Id., 42).4 Mr. Strong 4 Or again, "Two things are said to be 'distinct' when one has a different essence from the other. . . . If by 'percepts' we mean the essence given, this essence and the essence embodied in the object are not distinct" (Id. 43). As</page><page sequence="4">490 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY probably exaggerates his case in order to escape "representationism" (Id., 43), as when he says that the essence is the object without the object's substance (Id., 175) or existence. It is obvious that he does not avoid representationism by such assertions, for as long as the datum is not the whole object, as long as there are parts of the object which can not be given, those parts are represented by what is given and one's theory of perception is dualistic. This is all illustrative of Mr. Strong's ambiguity. At times he uses the word "essence" as very much like the Aristotelian essence and at times as a perceptual quality or property of an object. By what would be a pun, if he were not serious, he slips from one mean- ing to the other, using the former to explain veridical data, the latter to explain error. Thus when the datum is an essence, meaning a per- ceptual quality, perception may be invalid; but when it is an essence meaning "the inner nature," perception is valid. The impossibility of the identity of data as he describes them and any part of a physical object can easily be proved. They can not be one if they have in- compatible properties. But they are bound to have incompatible properties if the datum is a universal, for the physical object is cer- tainly a particular. It is a particular if it is the ordinary physical object of common sense and also if it is the "scientific object." The essence is timeless, they are in time; a timeless entity may be a sign of one in time, but it certainly can not be identical with it. If the object of which Mr. Strong is speaking is the "scientific object, " its relation to the essence becomes even more puzzling. The scientific object is by definition imperceptible, so that the datum could not be its essence in the sense of one of its qualities. Since the inner nature of the scientific object is to be infra-perceptual, the datum could not be its essence in the Aristotelian sense of the word. If the object of which Mr. Strong is speaking is the physical object of common sense, i.e., the total object as perceived, any datum might be one of its qualities, but could never be its Aristotelian essence, for according to Mr. Strong's premises its existence is never given and it is certainly an important item in the essence of physical objects. The next question which arises is how we reach the objects through their essences. In Mr. Santayana we reach them by animal faith. In Mr. Strong the process is much the same except that it is a matter of fact, according to this definition of " Idistinct," two essences could only be distinct if eaeh essence had an essence and so on. Mr. Drake is more definite. He says that the primary qualities "of our normal perceptual data may (in so far as perception is accurate) be regarded as literally features of the existent world in the midst of which we live" (Mitnd, 53; but see 55, n. 1). This may be justifiable, but certainly not because of any felt difference between the normal perceptual data and the abnormal.</page><page sequence="5">THE DATUM AS ESSENCE 491 more fully explicated. Essences have three groups of properties to each of which he gives varying emphasis. Ontologically, for instance, they are inexistent and can appear identical in veridical perception and in hallucination. Psychologically they are (a) the termini of sensations and acquire almost a subjectivistic tinge when he speaks about their being, "brought before the mind?" by various sensations (Id., 132), one of the few clues he gives as to the mode of their ap- pearance; (b) they are used by intellection to round out incomplete experiences (Id., 118), though he does not explain how intellection knows which ones to choose. Logically they are signs, "meanings" as Mr. Drake calls them (Mind, 188), and thus have a logical self- transcendence. It ig through their transcendent reference that we reach their objects when they have any. But Mr. Strong does not mean that our passage from these signs to what they signify is logical (Origin, 39). We do not find evi- dence of an object's existence in the presence of its essence; we act as if it were present. Mr. Strong refers to this act as an operation of " instinct " (Id., 47).5 This is not, however, an answer to the question. For if a given essence may now be veridical, now illusory, why does the instinct now act as if an " object " were present, now as if it were not? How does it know which data point to physical objects and which do not? That it soon acquires such knowledge is a fact; we seldom mistake images for percepts. One does not believe, for instance, that the spokes of a wheel fuse into a solid disk as the wheel begins to revolve. Nor is it by an irrational saltus that we discover the truth. When we are in doubt, we reason about our data (or can if we will) and resolve our doubts. If we moved by a faculty which might properly be called "instinct," why is it so often hesitant? I have elsewhere listed a number of absurd propositions which would be plausible if immediate data of a single sense at a single moment were the sum total of our wisdom; 6 as a matter of fact they are not, and not even Mr. Strong believes that they are. The reason why Mr. Strong, like Mr. Santayania, believes that the process of positing existence is irrational, is because his conception of the word "reason" is a bit narrow. It is true that no term by itself implies anything; it might just as well be nonsense. "Red- ness," "triangularity," "man," what can one reason from these terms in isolation? Again, no universal implies "existence." But 'existence" is not peculiar in that respect. We have to know the 5 Mr. Drake also believes that essences are guides to action (Mind, 193), but it is difficult to explain how "purely imaginary" things could be. Nor does he explain. 6 1 The Truth of Immediate Knowledge, " this JOURNAL, VOl. XXIIT, NO. 1.</page><page sequence="6">492 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY signs of a thing before we can logically begin to reach it. But the relevancy of non-conventional signs is learned, it is not intuited. Who could argue logically from a man's finger-prints to a man with- out first knowing the individuality of finger-prints? 7 Such knowl- edge can never be completely acquired, I admit, in the case of natural objects, but certain reliable hypotheses can be formulated and are formulated. The same remarks apply to "existence." A baby likes to touch what it sees, as if touch were an infallible sign of physicality. So Destutt de Tracy made the feeling of resistance a sign of external ex- istence. For all I know, there may be tactile illusions just as there is tactile ancesthesia. One suffering from such illusions would not admit the reliability of such a proof. But I venture to suggest that the sup- pression of all hypotheses or postulates in thinking would not open the way for " instinct, " but for silence. It is an old story and my sug- gestion will seem very banal to students of the history of philosophy. The point is, as everyone knows, that reasoning is as much the test- ing of hypotheses as anything else; that is its way of behaving and it is folly to upbraid it for what it can not help. In other words, the logical fertility of a concept, term, proposi- tion, or what you will, is not self-evident. Logic begins after one has discovered or assumed the relations between entities. The con- templation of an essence or any other meaningful term is not suffi- cient to reveal its implications. When it seems to be, it is because we have formed the habit of linking the two entities together and are no longer aware of anything other than the termini of the process. It has usually been acknowledged that logical order is not the order of learning nor of existence, but is a rearrangement of what is learned. Hence in moving from the datum of sense beyond, we ob- viously can not move without making certain guesses or hypotheses. Memory, habit, learning, guide us in our guessing and that our hy- potheses are an articulation of our past experience ought to occasion no surprise. It is not a sign of their invalidity or illogicality. Is a biologist or a chemist using an illogical or an "instinctive" process in correcting his guesses by experiment? The process is behind all our reasoning, is what makes us suspect the applicability of our rea- soning to the "real world" and what permits us to reason instead of acting. Hence to call the positing of an existent beyond the es- sence by a derogatory name is gratuitous libel. We may make mis- takes at times, but even mathematicians make mistakes. The trouble is that we demand a kind of apodictic certainty in epistemology which is found nowhere else and which we have every reason to be- lieve is unattainable by human beings. 7 Cf. the beautiful discussion in Mr. Santayana 's Dialogues in Limbo, p. 110.</page><page sequence="7">THE DATUM AS ESSENCE 493 II There remains one question which must be put to all theories that the datum is an essence. It is the question of how inexistent timeless essences appear before the mind. To save space I shall confine myself to the views of Messrs. Strong and Drake. The reader may apply the criticism to other views at his leisure. One would suppose essences to be independent of human beings according to Mr. Strong 's definition of " independence. " Two things, he says (Origin, 42), are independent "when one can exist without the other." As the realm of essences is intermediate be- tween the Ego and its objects and as its inhabitants are immutable, one might imagine them to be independent of us. We light upon them; we do not create them. Yet to read The Origih of Consciousness is to see to how great an extent they are dependent upon us. If there were no human beings or animals " higher " than human, it is doubtful whether "gold moun- tains," "round squares," or anthropomorphic gods would subsist. So many of our essences seem to be the literal effects or products of the human equation that the only other explanation of their ap- pearance would be that human minds were made to fit them. It may be, for instance, that God created toothaches first and then teeth to fit them, that He created visceral sensations and in His infinite mercy made viswera to suit. Though Mr. Strong's theory would seem to imply such a cosmogonly, he admits that some essences are functions of the human mind. For both he and Mr. Drake refer to the phenomenon of fusion, which Mr. Strong in his later book, A Theory of Knowledge, (1923), calls "confusion," and in his articles in Mind (January and April, 1926), "The Genesis of Sensible Appearances, " calls " simplification." Fusion is the welding together of manly petites perceptions into a datum wlhich has no parts. Few psychological facts are better at- tested than this. Whatever examples may be chosen to illustrate the process, it produces out of a variety of elementary data, of which one may or may not have been aware, a datum which has every ap- pearance of simplicity and as a datum is, of course, simple. But the resultant simple datum is, as all explanations are bound to concede, a function at least of the original petites perceptions, their interre- lations, and the human nervous system. If these were different, the datum would be differenlt. An-id it is not inconceivable that if the human sensory equipment alone were not precisely what it is, the simplifications would be different. So in the mixing of pigments, the original elemental colors are not visible, but nevertheless deter- mine what derivative color will be seen.</page><page sequence="8">494 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY If these facts are admitted, and they are insisted upon by Messrs. Strong and Drake in the metaphysical portions of their books, what becomes of the timeless inexistent essence which the mind beholds, but takes no part in producing? Is there any difference in the effectuating of these simplified data and that of anything else which is a function of definitely existing things? In many cases we know that we can conitrol the effect by controlling the physical stimulus and cai thus prove its partial dependence upon the physical stimulus. If it is desirable to call the effect an essence, well and good, but surely it is no longer an Aristotelian essence, for it is the inner natutre of nothing but itself; nor yet a quality, for it is a property of nothing in the sense that color is a property of objects; nor timeless, being both dated and mutable; nor spaceless, being (at least in the case of vision) not onily extenided but localized. A possible answNver to this criticism is that the process of fusion does not create a new essence but merely directs our intuition upon a new one. This is possible, but is not the answer of Messrs. Strong and Drake, for, iiideed, unless the process is a real one operating upon fusible elements, it is of little value to their theories. In fact the inlcompatibility of such appearance? with the doctrine of essences is practically admitted by Mr. Strong in his "Genesis of Sensible Appearances," although Mr. Drake refers to these articles as if they were harmonious with the epistemology of The Origin of Conscious- ness (Mind, 140, n. 1). It is obvious that such dated products must be particulars, for the only genesis attributable to universals is the fertility of implication. But no one would maintain that the prod- ucts of fusion were caused by a logical implication of their elements. But perhaps the best argument against these theories is that the datum does not look nor act like a universal. On the theory of nieutral beinig, the only reason why all univer- sals are not perceived is accidental. But there are certain properties of universals, above all their universality, which in the nature of things could not be perceived. One does not see the repeatability of a patch of redness; one sees a red patch. To know that some- thing is repeatable requires memory and recognition. When one perceives a quality, otne is aware of just that particular entity at that time (plus certain associations and the like which are more important psychologically than epistemologically) and when ihe quality is re- membered, it is remembered as that particular entity of that particu- lar time. Its logical traits are a discovery which could not be given. If this were not so, why should we spend so much time trying to iden- tify and classify our experiences? The repeatability of a datum can be discovered only after the datum has been repeated and reflected</page><page sequence="9">THE DATUM AS ESSENCE 495 upon. Henlce if the criterion of universality is repeatability, the datum could not look like a universal. Simnilarly if a universal is spaceless, some data can not be uni- versals. For whether visual data, for instance, are in public or in private space, they are in some space. A red patch is so many cen- timeters long-but redness can not be or the old puzzle about the exhaustibility of universals would arise. It is to the right of this and above that and near the other. It has a dozen and one spatial properties which a true universal could not have.8 Moreover, the datum does not act like a universal. The only characteristic like causation among universals is implication. The authors I have treated either confuse the causal relations of data with implication (Mr. Holt) or deny that they have any. We have two typical cases of such relations which I should like to inldicate here. 1. We know from experience that if a given visual datum is in a certain spatial relation to a mirror, it is duplicated. If the patch of color is homogeneous, it is visually identical in the mirror and out of it except that it will probably be brighter in the mirror. But if it have an irregular shape, it is discovered to be reversed and, of course, there is no reason to doubt that it is always reversed. In what sense of the word could a purely logical, a spaceless and time- less eintity, be reflected in a mirror? This is not merely a rhetorical question. It will, I think, be admitted by everyone that the mirror- image is not simply another datum, but is causally related to its original, so much so that one has only to change the original in the slightest degree to effect a change in it. But if it can change, it is, I should imagine, no universal. Moreover, if all mirror-images are reversed, we have on the theory of essences an inexistent, timeless, and spaceless entity undergoing a very elaborate causal operation. Now if the mirror be warped, the datum is still further modified. I submit the following alterilatives: either the mirror-image has no causal relation to its so-called original, or it is no universal. It seems to me more reasonable to assert the latter ajnd deny the former. 2. To turn from elementary physics to psychology, we discover that the datum is modified by other data in the contemporary per- ceptual field, by memories of past data, by what one expected before it entered one's perceptual field, as well as by other psychical facts. If one takes a universal like "humanity, " one assumes, I believe, that its connotation is a constant; inideed, there is very little other ground, as far as I klow, for calling it " timeless. " The same thing ought to 8 Cf. A. 0. Lovejoy; "La th6orie de la st6rilit6 de la conscience dans la philosophie am6rieaine et anglaise," Bull. de la Soc. Frangaise de Philos., 25e ann6e, nos. 4-5, Oct.-Dec., 1925.</page><page sequence="10">496 JOURNAL OP PHILOSOPHY be true of "redness." If, then, data are universals, why are not the universals which are data constant as to their connotation? The thought "redness," or the judgment, "This is red," can arise when there is next to no perceptual evidence for it. Anyone who has studied painting knows how difficult it is to find a pigment which is, as one says, "pure. " Similarly-indeed, partly for this very reason -it is difficult to find a perceptual datum which is pure. It is adulterated, not only physically, but psychically. This, one might object, can be easily done away with, just as the chemist does away with the impurities he encounters. The fact that it has to be done away with shows that it is there and that the duality of the universal and the perceptual has not been reduced. For if percepts of red were literally "redness," why should they ever differ? Mr. Ilolt in 1914 argued that they must be the same; that if x and y were both, say, red, there must be a common quality, "red- ness," in both x and y. There must, indeed, when one is thinking about them, just as every circle must be round. But just as no per- ceptual circle is round, though on the essence-theory it ought to be, so no-or very few-perceptual reds are spectral reds. That this is so may be discouraging to Platonists, but on the whole it is a tribute to the economy of thought. It is a kind of evidence of how different thouLght is from its subject-matter and of the whole process of classi- fication and abstraction. I suggest that the difficulty arises over a misconception of what a common property is. It is usually supposed that members of the same class must all have some property which can be abstracted from them and considered by itself in isolation be- cause it exists in each of them as a self-identical entity. This seems, before one reflects about it, to be the case with perceptual properties -colors, shapes, sounds, odors, etc. But one can easily see that it is not always the case. Mr. Russell has shown that when a number of terms have a given transitive symmetrical relation to a given term, they form a class. And it will be seen that if a number of terms have a given relation to another term, whatever the character of the relation, they will or can be given a common name, and so be popu- larly suspected of having a common property. Everything east of Suez may form a class of terms called "orientals" and may be said to have the common property of orientality; but no one would main- tain seriously that there was a property, orientality, resident in all orientals. For if he did, how could he avoid the fallacies which Socrates committed in the Theatetus (154, 155) wheni he argued against relativism? The hypostatising of relatives would lead to such logical absurdities that one would feel willing to go to any lengths to avoid it. A familiar case would be the following: one</page><page sequence="11">THE DATUM AS ESSENCE 497 can say truly that the sums of the angles of all triangles are equal; but is the sum of the angles of any given triangle equal? The hypothesis of common properties-though apparently justi- fied in sense-perception-needs much qualification before it can be applied to all classes. But in a paper of this sort, such qualification can not be made. There is a final arg,ument against these theories (with the excep- tion of Mr. Holt's) taken in a body. They all, it will be recalled, posit the existence of a physical object of some sort, a concrete par- ticular, as the transcendent reference of the perceived essence. The object is something which has never occurred before and never will occur again, unless the Earth's great year begins anew. How could one ever infer from a universal more than that, if it were correlated with a physical object, the physical object would be of such and such a nature? 9 But that, for instance, redness-in-general is evidence of this or that particular event in space-time is obviously an illegiti- mate inference. The believers in the essence-theory agree, and con- clude-except in Mr. Hick's case-that therefore faith or "action" will posit what reason denies. The answer is that faith-if thus aroused-and action would come to grief unless things were as the illegitimate inference concludes. But that in turn means that we have probably a true conclusion following from false premises. This point, however, has been discussed above and we shall accord- ingly not repeat it. The issue is as follows: (a) The essence theory. 1. The datum is a universal. 2. It has transcendent reference to a particular. 3. But a universal can not logically imply the existence of any- thing. 4. Therefore the existence of the transcendent reference is posited by a non-logical but reliable act of faith. (b) This paper. 1. The datum is not a universal, for 2. It has transcendent reference to a particular, 3. And a universal can not logically imply the existence of any- thing. 4. Nevertheless the existence of the transcendent reference is discovered by the same type of reasoning as is used in any other inference. GEORGE BOAS. T}IE JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY. 9 Cf. C. D.
