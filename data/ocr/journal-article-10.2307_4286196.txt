<plain_text><page sequence="1">Amos Megged Magic, popular medicine and gender in seventeenth-century Mexico: the case of Isabel de MontoyaI Beginning in the second half of the seventeenth century, as Solange Alberro highlighted in her masterful book on the Mexican Inquisition, charges of magic and diabolical witchcraft were met in Mexico with a growing current of caution and scepticism on the part of the Holy Office. In spite of the accumulating evidence in regard to the growth of these practices, the Inquisitors were now far less hasty in proceeding against them.2 Why, then, was the Mexican church and Inquisition so different in its response to such phenomena from that of its European counterparts? As Brian Levack asserted, 'The reasons for the lenient treatment of witches had a great deal to do with the nature of the Inquisition and the way in which the crime of witchcraft was perceived at the time.'3 When we examine the thought of Spanish theologians of the seventeenth century, we can trace the very roots of such rationality and scepticism on the issue of witchcraft, which made the Spanish Inquisition so different from its European counterparts. Already, in i6i i, the theologian Pedro de Valencia had written in his famous treatise on the question of Basque witchcraft4 that witchcraft and magic in all its variations were the product of natural potencies, the same as illnesses, illusions and deliriums.5 But this latter assumption was not in itself novel. In his principal book on witchcraft, Disquisition magicarum, first published in Louvain between 1599 and i6oo, the Jesuit Martino Del Rio had devoted a large part of his discussion to deeds that are but natural potencies, or a kind of delusion.6 Nevertheless, Valencia had obviously taken the work of ' This article is partly based on research carried out at the Van Pelt Library, University of Pennsylvania.

Thus Valencia's work made a breakthrough by considerably devaluing the earlier emphasis upon demonological interpretations. This development left its undeniable impact on succeeding generations of Spanish and New World Inquisitors. The subsequent debate among men of the church in Spain concentrated on the Devil's anthropomorphism. Refuting the witches' deeds as real had moved the discussion in Spain forward to deal with the Devil's ability to deceive (engainar). But by the second decade of the seventeenth century this had also convinced most of the high level Inquisitors in Spain and the New World that witchcraft accusations relating to an explicit pact with the Devil were generally unfounded.7 The growth of scepticism is, however, not the only explanation for the absence of a forceful persecution of magic and diabolical witchcraft in seventeenth-century Mexico. In a recent article on Devil worship in Queretaro, Mexico, for example, Fernando Cervantes argued that the Mexican Inquisitors acted at best out of fear, rather than out of scepticism, being convinced that 'if the concept of the devil was to retain its credibility, the best they could hope for was that no such evidence be found'.8 In this present article we, nevertheless, wish to turn the debate to a different interpretation. From the middle of the seventeenth century onwards, the Counter-Reformation Mexican church and Inquisition were indeed alarmed, but by a different and more acute threat. This was embodied in the challenge to the formal liturgy, church rites and principles, performed within the church itself and through the priest's supreme mediation, from their misappropriation by a growing penumbra of alternative ritual frameworks. One of the most dominant of these frameworks was popular healing. For Mexican colonial society in general, the framework of popular healing served as a much-needed mechanism for alleviating a wide variety of anxieties unresolved by official church rites and curbed by a rigorous moral code. The practice of healing outside conventional medicine became, in Mexico, a powerful subculture absorbed by those outcast,9 but also attracted a flourishing clientele from among the conforming elite. Establishments like those of Isabel de Montoya and her colleagues in this profession, which we examine in this paper, thus became increasingly accepted in the main cities of Mexico by persons coming from different social strata of society. They were used as outlets for spiritual relief, and mediation with the supernatural, and were sought out by many for distinct needs outside the conventional procedures of medicine and the Catholic liturgy. Moreover, when the Inquisition's persecution against magic in general had declined in Mexico, popular healing which involved the use of ritual became far more accepted.

The Inquisition and the church obviously had an important role in deciding where the border between the acceptable and the deviant lay. But their role was now considerably shaken by changing mental and social criteria regarding the definition of deviation.'0 In these insecure times, therefore, stricter measures had to be employed to demarcate crumbling norms, violated limits and spoiled practices, and to sort out the transgressors. Writing on magical healing in late sixteenth-century Modena, Italy, Mary O'Neil has skilfully described how, 'in the eyes of the church, magical remedies not only competed with clerical ones, but competed unfairly, for their format was invariably syncretic, putting familiar Christian devices to purposes not approved by the church'." For the church and the Inquisition in Mexico, the existence of popular healing establishments obviously posed a threat to their supremacy over intermediation with the other world, leading astray the minds and bodies of the faithful. In this paper we intend to pursue further the important concern with the misappropri- ation of religious forms of intercession in seventeenth-century Mexico. In this context, we will try to understand, through the analysis of particular popular healing frameworks, the essence of the penumbra between proper church rites and what could be regarded as heresy. I The healing-magical profession in seventeenth-century Mexico was especially prominent among women of the lower castas - mestizas, blacks, mulattas and castizas - who lived under conditions of constant oppression due to their racial identity, gender and inferior social and economic status. They were women of an 'impure race', belonging to the lower classes of Spanish colonial society, and living very close to the edge of seventeenth-century colonial moral codes and ethics. With the drastically rising rate of miscegenation in Mexico, the castas, those of a racially mixed ancestry, now became the dominant element,'2 competing with the different phenotypical groups for space and a limited autonomy under Spanish colonial rule. 13 The reliance of local society on women of the lower castas to relieve spiritual needs, frustrations and bodily pains undoubtedly contributed to the flourishing of such subcultures, where racial prejudices and social limitations were easily crossed. 14 '1 On the changing attitudes of the Inquisition with regard to heresy, see for comparison, Carlo Ginzburg, The Night Battles, Witchcraft and Agrarian Cults in the Sixteenth and Seven- teenth Centuries (i983), 72, 78.

Most of them could be found at the bottom of the local social and labour hierarchy. They were usually household slaves or free servants, maids, midwives, cooks, bakers, and food- and flower-sellers in the city markets, 5 who were marginalized by society due to their racial affiliation, and also as an outcome of their loss of sexual honour. 16 A few of them were once married to Spaniards of the lowest stratum, but the majority were poor concubines deserted after a short time by their husbands and lovers. In her stimulating study of gender and disorder in early modern Seville, M. E. Perry notes: 'Poverty may explain why the husbands or lovers of these and other women of the parish had abandoned them. But if poverty acts as an acid in corroding human relationships . . . it may also act as a catalyst in forming new relationships that become essential for survival. 17 The collective practice of healing, therefore, established for those women in colonial Mexico alternative social settings, that transcended limitations of caste, status and norms, and alleviated their earlier experiences of social and sexual oppression.'8 In this sphere, new ritual bonds could also be created through the administration of particular rites and religious duties. In her studies of women's spirituality, Caroline Bynum emphasized that non-orthodox religious activities exercised by women in autonomous frameworks during the high Middle Ages originated in the church's denial of their celebrating mass.19 Such autonomous frameworks, as in the case of the beatas, remained on the edge of church rites, but assumed growing realms of expression and popularity, by way of mysticism, dreams and apparitions, which, in time, were viewed as rivalling the almighty authority of the church hierarchy.20 It was then that such women were directly associated with heresy, as well as with witchcraft and magic, and thus subjected to constant persecution. During the late sixteenth century, women healers in Europe, particularly those serving as midwives, were 15 Patricia Seed, 'Social dimensions of race: Mexico City, '753', Hispanic American Histori- cal Review (hereafter HAHR), LXII, 4 (1982), 569-606; also, Rodney D.

They were, likewise, accused of using their houses as shelters for other women where, supposedly, they facilitated illicit sex, among other services.21 Are we to infer that women's covert associations during this period were linked directly with the growing restriction and persecution of their expertise? We can, certainly, confirm this in the case of the seventeenth-century Mexican healer, Isabel de Montoya. II Night after night in the year of I662, Isabel de Montoya, an elderly woman of humble background and mixed Indian and Spanish descent who resided in Mexico City, dreamt that she saw St Michael. Later, when she was being interrogated by the Mexican Inquisitors about his appearance, she described St Michael as dressed in an orange- coloured jacket that had majestic green sleeves, and above it an open, green taffeta cloak with golden buttons. Beneath he wore a white tunic and on his head a woollen cap. Each time he appeared before her the saint urged her to take upon herself the curing of the sick and needy.22 Isabel de Montoya was thirty-eight years old, living in the town of Guaxocingo, in the bishopric of Puebla, when she was imprisoned and tried for the first time by the Holy Inquisition of Mexico, in July i652. At the first hearing of the court in Mexico City, she described herself as a castiza, and her profession as a healer. She confessed, in a 'well-spoken' Romance, that she could not read or write, but was able to recite the Credo, the Ave Maria and the Salve Regina, as well as some of the Articles of Faith, and part of the Ten Commandments.23 She was born in i6I4 and baptized in the parish of Santa Vera Cruz in Mexico City, north-west of the cathedral, where she was later confirmed when she was seven years old. Her godparents were the Attorney-General of the Mexican audiencia and a black slave of the public notary - a highly contrasting social and ritual union, indeed, which could partly be explained by Montoya's descent. Her father, a native of Spain (Gachuppin), was a shoemaker in the Vera Cruz quarter, while her mother was a mestiza born in Mexico City in the same quarter. Montoya's family household was strongly matriarchal, and the healing profession, which was the most dominant attribute of this family, was passed from mother to daughters for three generations. The initiator of the family tradition, Montoya's grandmother, a mestiza blanca, practised healing from an early age and passed on the knowledge to Montoya's mother and two aunts. One of them, Isabel Martin, who became a 21 Perry, Gender and Disorder in Early Modern Seville, op. cit., 20-7.

This aunt was not just Montoya's baptismal godmother, but also her closest teacher in the art of healing. Montoya had, in fact, learnt healing at the age of eight, serving as an apprentice to both her mother and her aunt, who taught her how to grind herbs, and instructed her in the preparation of potions and lotions for the cure of diverse types of burning fevers.24 Some of the prescriptions she learnt were common knowledge in Spain, as well as being part of colonial conventional medicine at that time. One of the most famous colonial medical works, Tractado Brebe de Medicina (1592), written by Augustin Farfan, for example, strongly recommended the use of nearly sixty Aztec therapeutics, often as substitutes for scare European drugs.2S However, some of these drugs were already under the close scrutiny of the Mexican Inquisition, especially when dealing with women practitioners from among the castas. The use of Indian herbs was now often associated with magic, and thus, for example, in i620 in the Edict of Faith, the Mexican Inquisition prohibited the use of peyote 'and any others of the type that hold the virtue to cause fantasms and representations upon which divinations are founded'.26 Montoya remembered how, for example, an Italian physician who visited Mexico City once came to her aunt's home, and on that occasion wrote down the names of different herbs that he knew were applied in Europe for healing and could be found in Mexico: peppermint, sage, rosemary, la palataria and many others.27 Galenic medicine of contemporary physicians was thus merged in Montoya's family household with Indian traditional curing methods, with no apparent conflict. Montoya was taught by her uncle and another physician to cure with black chickens, and she was also shown how to construe signs of bewitchment in an ailment, according to whether the patient's excrement contained 'some hairy worms the size of a leech, if it had dark colour, and some hairs were in the form of a cobweb'.22 She had also learnt to recognize bewitchments by the trembling of the heart or a sudden stomach pain, as well as by a pale-coloured countenance. Her mother and aunt cured these mischiefs using different powders sold by pharmacies at the city's main square (called 'against poison'),29 and they also used the yellow peyote, which she said 'had been applied by all the ancient Indians'.30 24 ibid., fol. 268r. 25 Risse, op. cit., 48-9. In his work on Morisco medicine in Spain, Garcia-Ballester has noted that: 'Classical medical practice and literature like the book of therapeutic pharmacology of Discorides translated into Spanish, was passed via Morisco doctors and specialists to Old Christians, and became a norm in medical practice.'

As an offspring of miscegenated ancestry, she was forced to fulfil her family's castizo - social aspirations - as well as the brutal norms of the creole subordinator's society. Concubinage of young girls, of racially 'inferior' origins, to men of superior status and racial affiliation was largely institutionalized among the castas in contemporary Mexican society. It was also by no means contradictory to 'preserve the illusion of chastity in spite of social reality'.3' Under these terms, obviously, there was hardly any room left for the girls' individual choice. By her parents' sanction, then, a Gachuppin man took Montoya away with him to his mother's house, proposing to marry her, and left her under the supervision of his household servants, a mulatta woman and her daughter. There she remained for four years. When she was fourteen, Mexico City's treasurer took her as his mistress, placing her under the guidance of a black slave, enclosed in a house, where she cooked and knitted, for over a year. She was 'rescued' from that house by a sergeant-major, who kept her as his concubine for six more years, during which time she was also his personal servant. At the age of twenty-one she fled when her parents wanted to marry her off against her will, to the city's treasurer. Consequently, her parents asked the city councillor to imprison her. While serving her first term of penitence at the city's House of Seclusion she met her future husband, Gaspar de la Penia. It was a most unfortunate union, lasting only eight days, and nearly ended her life because her husband tried to do away with her.32 She then fled Mexico City, this time to the city of Puebla, where for the first time she established her own independent household, together with two other poor women whom she maintained. Montoya remained in Puebla for nearly nineteen years, and earned her living there as a part-time prostitute and a healer,33 making unguents and selling them through an Indian artisan at the local market. In one of the Inquisitorial hearings of her case, Montoya described her adolescence in Puebla as 'living in total promiscuity'.34 About three years after coming to Puebla, she was placed in Puebla's House of Seclusion for a year and a half, by the orders of Bishop Palafox, for such immoral practices as the seduction of men and the attraction of married women.35 After her release from the House of Seclusion, she moved temporarily to the nearby towns of Cholula, San Salvador and Guaxocingo, to avoid the Inquisition's close surveillance, especially of her trade in the illegal yellow peyote. She made her living in these places as a healer and a midwife, but occasionally she also worked as a cook for local dignitaries and the Franciscan friars. In these towns she established her fame in the healing profession, as well as extending her body of women adherents, who assisted her in her work, even as far away as the port town of Vera Cruz. 31 Seed, To Love, Honor, and Obey, op. cit., 64. 3Z Ms. Lea i6o, op. cit., fol. 92r. 33 For further reference on this point, see also O'Neil's depiction of Modena's women special- ists in love magic procedures as mainly prosti- tutes.

We should start by stating that these women were all devout Catholics, who took part regularly in church rites and the holy feasts. All of them were able to recite part or all of the Credo, and the three prayers - the Ave Maria, Pater Noster and Salve Regina - as well as sentences from the Articles of Faith, and some of the Ten Commandments. Their knowledge of the Catholic faith was somewhat better than that usually prevailing at the time among Mexico's popular classes. Examining the list of items which Montoya brought with her to the Inquisition's prison in Mexico City on 24 July i662, there is fair evidence of her piety to the cult of the saints, although this ran parallel to her devotion to the rich collection of powders and herbs she possessed. Her devotional objects, which would not have dishonoured ladies of the Spanish colonial aristocracy, included a black rosary with an insignia of the Immaculate Conception; two small slips of cloth with an engraved image of Our Lady of Carmen; small plates engraved with the image of St James; a rectangular plate, with an engraving of St Anthony, holding a branch in his left hand; a copper plate with an engraved image of Our Lady of Solitude, together with a painted figure; an image of the adoration of St Mary Magdalene holding the cross; the figures of male and female saints engraved on six parchments; Agnus Dei with a painted cloth; a roll of bread of St Nicholas; a paper with the image of Christ; a bull of the Holy Cross; a calf of St Anthony; and two small ivory images of St Francis and St Mary Magdalene coiled in paper.36 Some of these objects had probably been donated to her either by the friars who frequented her house, or by some of her closest patients. Montoya's teachings to her adherents, apart from the practice of healing and counter-magic, included popular devotions to her favourite saints. Maria de Rivera, for example, was taught by Montoya to become a devotee to St Martha. She instructed her to go to a mulatto artist who worked at the marketplace, and ask him to paint an image of the saint for her. Montoya also gave her a chant devoted to that saint, which she had kept since early childhood, written on a piece of paper.37 Popular chants, such as that to St Martha, were composed and recited at that time by street-balladeers among the castas, and were usually the by-product of liturgy, blended with Indian and black myths. Such chants, as for St Martha 'Martilla', were also popular at that time throughout Spain and formed an inseparable part of the body of love magic traditions, some of which were obviously brought to Mexico and adopted there by local practitioners from among the castas, like Montoya.38 From what we know, Montoya and her co-practitioners were actively involved in the yearly procession of the confraternity of the Holy Sacrament in Puebla, enacting the burial of Jesus, wearing black tunics, ropes on their necks and a thorn crown on their heads. 36 ibid., fol. 249v. 37 ibid., fol. 23r. 38 Sanchez Ortega, 'Sorcery and eroticism in love magic' in M.

Their ongoing interaction with the priesthood in the city convents and at Montoya's home doubtless enriched their knowledge of the liturgy. Nevertheless, it also provided them with additional channels to the supernatural, practised by some of the priests, such as the use of astrology and alchemy, which had been curbed by the Counter-Reformation church since the last decades of the sixteenth century.40 The priests' reliance on Montoya's healing practices, in Puebla and Mexico City, no doubt also reinforced her sense of power and authority in religious matters, especially when dealing with the poor and uneducated of the lowest castes. Thus, for instance, we are told how a mulatta who was a priest's housemaid in Cholula used to come to Montoya, when she was in Puebla, to acquire 'the salt with which they baptize' and other church items. The testimony presented in the Inquisitorial courtroom by the witnesses, as well as the forensic evidence collected at Montoya's lodgings in Mexico City, could provide a reasonable explanation as to where the popularly approved penumbra of non-deviant healing probably lay during this period in Mexico. This testimony, however, also reveals the 'hidden co-operation' between the official religion and popular ritual.42 The iconography of Montoya's devotional objects, her ritual means and methods, represented a spectacular combination of lotions, potions, herbs, vapour-producing substances, minerals, and hallucinatives - all of them 'borrowed' mainly from native cosmology - merged with chants, prayers and ritual actions of the Catholic liturgy, as well as popular devotions to the cult of the saints.43 Local variants of folk healing, in Montoya's repertoire, included, among others, Aztec herbs for curing arthritis; fragments of a viper against contraction of the tendons; a hare's ear against hearing problems; some powders for curing babies' bad indigestion; and a 'toad's grass' for treating gout and urinary complications.44 Some of her medicines, however, such as aromatic smoke, ointments, mineral powders and juniper oil, could also be easily taken by her prosecutors as originating from Moorish 39 Ms. Lea i6o, op. cit., fols iiov, 252V, 312V. 40 ibid., fol. 24r: Montoya's astrological ex- periences with a Franciscan priest, who served his sentence with her at Puebla's House of Seclusion.

I9 NO. 2 folk healing,45 brought from Spain by Spanish settlers and assimilated in normative medicine, as well as by local healers in Mexico, who belonged to the lower castes. We should now turn to the actual ritual procedures used by Montoya and her co-practitioners in her healing establishments, in Mexico City, Puebla and more peripheral towns, that so alarmed the church and Inquisition in Mexico. One of Montoya's patients, for example, the wife of a local dignitary in Mexico City, described her own experience in Montoya's lodgings to the Inquisitors. The woman, to whom Montoya was recommended by a friend, suffered from recurring fits. On entering the house she asked Montoya if she knew how to cure or deliver a baby. Montoya responded that she knew all forms of cures, and was also a midwife. The patient undressed, lay on a mattress and was anointed with a green unguent, while Montoya recited the Credo. She then told the woman to confess, and to trust God, 'who cured whole', and sold her the ointment. Twelve days later, after the Day of Ascension, she returned to Montoya's house, where the latter gave her some rosary beads rolled in paper, and some incense-producing substance. On a third visit to Montoya's place, on the day of St Anthony, she saw there a number of other women and friars who had come to be cured.46 To her clientele Montoya sold unguents, together with small loaves of bread mixed with dust gathered from the relics of St James and St Michael located in the city churches. She told her patients that the saints 'plead with God so that evil would come upon no one, and helped the ill to heal, and because they were God's saints and powerful, they could cause no harm to anyone'. One of Montoya's healing associates attested that 'many persons came to her to consult, because she became well known for her knowledge of sorcery, as well as for her discourse on the Sabbath'.47 Before and after treating her patients and exorcizing them, as the testimony illustrates, Montoya prayed to the saints. And before curing anyone bewitched by devils, she instructed him/her to say two Masses, 'knowing that Masses have the property of curing bewitchments caused by the Devil'. This had obviously posed a clear alternative to the priest's eminence as a mediator with the other world, as well as the church's role as the sole exorcist and Devil's exorcist. In her potions Montoya mixed 'things that belong to the saints - for additional help', praying for the person's sake 'in the name of God and the Holy Trinity'. The potions against bewitchments, for instance, were made of oil, 'very holy, ground herbs', 'counter-poison', and rosemary. She explained in her own words that she cured evil 'like a saint, who knew how to undo the works of the devils', having been granted those virtues directly from God. For such administrations, Montoya was later imputed by the Inquisitors of 'blending evil with the pure and benevolent, just like real witches', and charged with transgressing the church's authority.48 We could certainly indicate here that the most indisputable logic behind society's classification of the normative and the accepted, as the above attests, relied mainly on the degree to which the judged practices combined components of the official religion. 45 Garcia-Ballester, 'Academism versus em- piricism', op.

The latter were also much more prone to shy away from such questionable practices, under the threat of retribution by the church. Maria de Jesus, for instance, a free mulatta who lived near to Montoya in Las Doncellas street in Mexico City, described to the Inquisitors why she sought Montoya's alternative healing. Her mother, who suffered from arthritis, had been treated by the doctors for some time but in vain. When she was referred to Montoya the latter gave her some powders, which she later disposed of, after her confessor had warned her to go and divulge the matter to the Inquisitors.49 IV During the early i650s, Montoya's permanent establishment in Puebla, as the Inquisi- torial proceedings illustrate, was regularly crowded with laity, as well as priests from the nearby Franciscan monastery. They came not only to find cures for their bodily pains and frustrated love, but also to obtain counter-magic against bewitchments. Most of the clientele were women, of all classes, who sought by different means - love potions and magical substances (usually, hearts of wax and healing-minerals) - to retrieve the men who had abandoned them and were now engaged to other women. Apart from functioning as a popular healing sanctuary, the place also became a shelter for deserted women of the lower caste and class, such as household maids, nannies, cooks and midwives, who had escaped their former afflictions. Some of these women who stayed temporarily served as apprentices to Montoya. Common grounds for group identity were shared there by these different women, who had experienced similar circumstances to those of Montoya. Thus they were able to mould a supportive gender consciousness which helped them withstand repression. The collective practice of healing, the knowledge which they passed on to each other while staying there, became for these women an alternative social and ritualistic haven from the male-dominated 'caste system' of the colonial theatre. They were able, therefore, to fulfil their desires to attract and unite with men of higher status and prestige, and also to take revenge on their ex-seducers, using the love magic they had learnt from Montoya.i0 Who were the women with whom Montoya associated during this period, and under what circumstances did they form bonds with each other? Montoya, while imprisoned in Puebla's House of Seclusion, befriended Maria de Rivera, a mulatta, bread-seller, and regular visitor. In the course of her sentence, Maria habitually provided Montoya with food and clothing, which she badly needed. In return, Montoya taught her new friend a number of supernatural crafts: how to perform magic with herbs; to make her bread rise better; and how to foretell the future by casting lots from Ava leaves, and from glazed earthenware pans and corn grains. After her release, Montoya asked Maria to share her home in Puebla.s' 49 ibid., fol. 232v: Maria de Jesus's testimony, 3 April I663. so ibid., fol. 264r.

Fearing that she would soon be arrested by the Inquisition for trading with intoxicants, she fled to the nearby town of Cholula. That year Montoya travelled to Cholula especially for the feast day of Our Lady of the Mountain (Nuestra Sefiora del Cerro), hoping for easy gains by selling her yellow peyote to the crowds gathering in the marketplace. The two women met there, at Juana's stand, where Montoya bought some silver lace which she displayed on an open cart to the gathering bystanders. Montoya returned occasionally to Cholula, where the two women continued to meet. During their encounters, Montoya was able to demonstrate her expertise as a practising midwife, as well as her supernatural capabilities. Juana came along with her daughter, Isab,l de los Angeles, a 25-year-old wool weaver, pregnant by a man from Tlascala who had abandoned her despite his promises of marriage. Montoya informed Juana that her daughter was extremely weak, and had had a miscarriage, and then told her that 'she would entrust her daughter to God's will'. Some months later, Juana returned to Puebla, where Montoya kept her accommo- dation, and was scolded by Montoya for not having cared for her daughter as she had promised. Montoya also told Juana that she had sown seeds in the earth, 'to know whether the man who had left Isabel would come back to marry her'. In this case, as in many others, Montoya clearly used a variety of divination methods that were assumed to be most efficacious at the time, especially among Indians and blacks in the colony. Montoya's and Juana's shared life in Puebla was, evidently, in constant danger of exposure by the local police or the Holy Office, for their illegal activities. Juana continued to sell her pulque, clandestinely, to a growing clientele, while Montoya extended her treatments, often using a variety of hallucinogens, such as the forbidden peyote. She passed her knowledge on to Juana, on one occasion telling Juana to bring her a jar, into which she poured water together with some powders and two peyote plants. She then gave her the potion to drink and advised her to remember well what she would dream.52 The use of dreams was closely combined with the rest of the divination techniques that were generally passed on to Montoya by Indian practitioners who operated close by. Montoya, apparently, had already established close working relations by then in Puebla with local Indian practitioners, who regularly assisted her in her own practice of healing and fortune-telling. Such co-operation clearly taught her traditional curatives, such as the use of peyote, and chants which she applied according to her distinct, syncretized cosmology. In the case of Juana's daughter, she had thus instructed one of these Indian practitioners to light some candles, and gave him wine, to make him foretell whether the man who had abandoned Isabel was about to return and if the girl should marry him.53 In this case, as in many others later in her career, Montoya's role as an intermediary with the supernatural undoubtedly relied heavily on Indian knowledge and experience, which she passed on to her adherents. While at Montoya's house Juana, for example, regularly consulted an Indian herbal specialist, who taught her how to improve her pulque.54 52 ibid., fols 6ov-63v: Juana de Sosa's testi- mony.

Monica made her living there as a cook in the households of local Spaniards and also as a balladeer, reciting popular prayers in the streets while selling different foods. She and Juana de Sosa, presumably, got to know Montoya during the same period, while trading in the same marketplace of Cholula, on the feast day of Our Lady of the Mountain. Another of Montoya's adherents was Margarita de Palacios, a native of Puebla who was married to Gaspar de Morales, a lime-burner. Margarita became acquainted with Montoya through Maria de Rivera. Margarita was brought to Mexico City, to stand trial, on Saturday, 22 June I654, having been imprisoned ten days earlier by the Holy Office of Puebla, accused of 'sorcery and using superstitious herbs and frauds'. When asked if she knew why she had been brought in front of the Inquisition, she answered that it might have been because of the 'adventures that she had experienced earlier with Maria de Rivera'. Eight years earlier, when Margarita had fallen ill with malaria, she went to Maria de Rivera, who offered her a remedy in the form of a winter vetch. The herb was to be dissolved in water, then some of it was poured on the heart and the rest of it was drunk, 'by which she would be cured of that habitual weak constitution'. Two days later, very early in the morning, passing through Rivera's lodgings, Maria invited her in and there Margarita met Montoya, who offered her some dry, green herbs.55 Some days afterwards, while confessing to Fr Mateo de la Cruz in El Carmen monastery, Margarita told him about the herbs and he instructed her to tear and cut them into small pieces. Then he absolved her and warned her never to see Montoya and her co-practitioners again, advice she evidently did not follow.56 This was doubtless a clear example of how, in contrast to the growing concern with ritual procedures alternative to the church's monopoly, the local priesthood treated these forms of magical healing. They tried their best to prevent their parishioners from being personally involved in such illicit activities, but only to a certain extent, rarely pursuing the information they were given, nor turning in the suspects to the Inquisitors. In the following year and a half we find Margarita sharing the same house with Juana de Sosa, whom she called sister-in-law because she had relations with the former's brother, Francisco de Palacios, and actively involved in Montoya's healing practices in town.57 Such sisterhood among these women might well be interpreted as a form of pseudo-consanguinity that could be paralleled with the relationship of blood-sisters among the beatas and Alumbrado groups of women in southern Spain during the early seventeenth century.58 In her study of love magic in Modena, O'Neil has also stressed the fact that many of these women shared ritual means and formulae,59 and we could clearly infer that they also regarded themselves as socially and ritually bound, in a similar way to Montoya and her co-practitioners in colonial Mexico. 55 ibid., fol. 47v. 56 ibid., fols 49r-50v. 57 ibid., fol. 6I V. 58 On the Alumbrados in southern Spain see V.

I9: NO. 2 V We should return at this point to examine the history of the Holy Office's persecution of Isabel de Montoya, and the reasons that lay behind it. On 25 June I65z, Isabel de Montoya was taken into the penitentiary of the Holy Office in Guexocingo, together with a few of her belongings: two shirts, a mattress, and her powders and herbs. She was placed under the custody of the parish priest of the San Salvador barrio, Don Joseph de Goitias. A week later she was transferred to Mexico City, to the Holy Office's prison. The original allegation, read before her by Guexocingo's Inquisitors, was that she continually abused her local profession as a midwife, having treated her patients with illicit means. In the Mexico City courtroom the prosecutor, Thomas L6pez de Erenchun, broadened the allegations, describing Isabel de Montoya as 'a famous healer, who used herbs, roots, vapour-producing substances, and powders, all for the sake of evil ends, reciting superstitious words and prayers, and forming an explicit pact with the Devil, with whom she consulted and communicated those matters'.60 On i6 February I653, after seven months of imprisonment and torture, Isabel de Montoya was finally sentenced to an auto-da-f6, a hundred lashes, exile from her city Puebla, and a three-year penitence in Mexico City's hospital, Am6r del Dios. We should stress here that the institution of the public hospital - the almshouses - became for the church in Mexico the means of banishment and 'reconversion' of those women, like Montoya, who deviated from its paramount authority and ritual monopoly. In the almshouses, the church could thus place women under its direct supervision and guidance, interrupting their threatening influence on society. After enduring long periods of imprisonment and trials, these women were often sentenced to serve the poor, till death, at the city's hospital. However, in the city hospital, ironically enough, these women actually rejoined persons of their own social class and caste, and thus were often able to continue and even improve their covert practices by absorbing new traditions, particularly when the hospital'sprotomedico, or the supervising cleric, was absent.61 On 17 February, Montoya was taken from the Santo Domingo monastery, nude from the waist upward, mounted on a pack-saddle wearing a coraza with the insignia of a sorceress, and holding a green wax candle in her hands. She was led through the city streets, to the main square, where the public crier pronounced her sentence.62 In I656, after her release, we find Montoya living in a small alley, behind the church of San Juan de Dios, in the Santa Clara barrio of Mexico City. It was only a few hundred metres away from the Holy Office's palace. She shared her lodgings there with two other mulatto women, and after a very short period of abstention, she was back working as a healer, in the capital. This time she gained ever-growing popularity, as we have already described above. Having completed her first sentence, as the testimony tells, Montoya was, nevertheless, far more daring than before in her sophisticated application of a variety of procedures 60 Ms. Lea i6o, Op. cit., fols 86r, I 15v. 61 On the protomedicos in New Spain, see Risse, Medicine in the New World, op. cit., 30-2.

Why, when Montoya was living so close to the Holy Office, did so many years elapse before she was finally arrested again, in 1663? The answer to that is to be found in the list of some of her clientele, among whom were prominent members of the local elite, and with whom she maintained an intimate relationship. Highly placed city women and learned friars, as well as one of the Inquisitors themselves, Don Francisco de Estrada, helped considerably in concealing Montoya's activities and provided her with an alibi when there was danger of exposure. It would be possible to presume that the most renowned of her clientele, in particular, wished to remain anonymous and hide their involvement, as far as they could, in order not to be exposed to the coercion of the church. Much of the Inquisitorial testimony, brought against Montoya to facilitate her arrest and trial in I663, discussed a death caused a year earlier to a prominent patient, as a direct result of Montoya's counter-magic. That year she was called in to cure a certain Don Miguel, an honorary citizen who resided next to Mexico City's main square. Her prognosis was that he had been bewitched by his wife, his mother-in-law and his sister, during his term of office in Suichiapa. The bewitchment, she said, was carried out by means of taking a small piece of bread chewed by Don Miguel, placing it in the mouth of a toad and nailing the toad to the hinge of a door. She then prescribed him some anti-magic potions made of peyote, to extirpate the bewitchment. It took twenty days for Montoya to 'cure' Don Miguel, after which time he died. Before he returned his soul to the Creator, Don Miguel divulged to his wife that he had seen the Devil himself. The information was quietly but rapidly passed on to the Holy Office. Montoya's second arrest soon followed. When her adherents and close patients were brought to court by the Inquisitors they already acknowledged to each other the undeniable fact that the evidence gathered against Montoya in the course of those years would clearly incriminate them as accomplices in matters that were given rigorous penalties - especially charges related to heresy. However, they knew that if they confessed fully to those sins and attributed them directly to Montoya herself, their punishment would be remitted. Consequently, they were eager to expose to their interrogators that the roots of their 'diabolical actions' were initiated by Montoya during her long career. Margarita de Palacios and Juana de Sosa, Montoya's accomplices, thus testified in court about certain recitations and ritual actions taught them by Montoya and directed to the Lord of the Street, who was the Devil in person. The goal of the recitations was to relieve these women from their harsh social position, and meet their aspirations of finding a man of a higher status, with wealth and power. They participated in nocturnal offerings to the Lord of the Street (the Devil), using a vapour-maker of violet silk, golden lace and rosemary, which Montoya dispersed to the four corners of the street - 'for the lord's dinner'. The chants and prayers performed to the Devil, in the form of St Martha 'the wicked', or the Lord of the Street, were also prescribed by Montoya for the sake of protection 'against vengeful men who wished to do away with their women or hurt them'.63 Nevertheless, the confessions by Montoya's accomplices could be quite easily interpreted by the late seventeenth-century Mexican Inquisitors as related to various superstitions, magic and 'other falsities', rooted in social goals and aspirations, and 63 ibid., fols 14v-15r, 39r.</page><page sequence="16">204 Social History VOL. 19: NO. 2 embodied in immoral conduct, that had very little to do with heresy or demonology. Due to the Inquisition's growing indifference towards denunciations of magic, charges against Montoya's accomplices were therefore dismissed and they were given the comparatively light penalties of a public flogging and a short period of penitence. Montoya herself, however, was quite another matter. Interrogated by the Inquisitors as to who had taught her the falsities, she answered that it was the Devil who tempted her 'so that she would be considered as the woman who mastered those elements'. Later on she added that she did not consider the herbs she used as breaking the rulings of the church; however, she acknowledged that her recitations were sinful. They were the direct consequence of being misled by the Devil.64 One of the most intriguing documents among the two volumes of Inquisitorial paperwork written on Montoya's case is what is named there as 'the prosecutor's propositions for consideration', dating from io January I663. The document highlights, very vividly, the intense mental and ideological conflict that raged among the Inquisitors who dealt with this case of the once anonymous healer, Isabel de Montoya. Moreover, examining this discourse, we are better able to understand the more general current of scepticism that had just begun within the Mexican Inquisition, and thus ensured that punishments of women like Montoya were far more moderate than earlier on. The discourse begins by discrediting Montoya's powers to cure, or even generate evil through her medicine. It goes on to argue that her patients, like the honourable Don Miguel, could have lost their senses by taking the hallucinogens she prescribed, such as the forbidden peyote, either out of natural causes (virtus natural), or occult - so the prosecutor concludes that on this point it could not have been the natural effect of the peyote as such. Nevertheless, if those drugs were applied with the intention of causing a supernatural effect, and could not be conceived by means of natural causation, it was indeed magic, which is to say, 'at least an implicit pact with the Devil'.65 Thus the door was left open for scepticism. The same spirit of reservation and doubt is also identified in the prosecutor's ambivalent interpretation of Montoya's use of dreams to predict her clients' fortunes. According to the prosecutor, if the dreams, which he interpreted as pure divination techniques, existed, they could not have originated from God, considering the evil way she construed them. However, this contention leaves enough room for belief in their actual validity. None the less, if these dreams 'never existed', they were 'straight forward witch's swindles', applied only for the sake of reinforcing the recognition of her healing efficacy by her patients. We should clearly be able to recognize here, in the prosecutor's uneven posture, the long-standing influence of one of the most notable Spanish theologians of the sixteenth century, Pedro Ciruelo. The latest and enlarged edition of his famous book Reprobacion de las supersticiones y hechecenas (c. 1530), which appeared in Barcelona in 1628 and also included two copies of Sixtus V's papal bull against a variety of occult practices such as divinations and astrology, must have been studied carefully by the prosecutor. In the sixth chapter of this book, devoted to the subject of dreams, Ciruelo concludes that: 6 ibid., fol. xogv: Montoya's defence. 65 For comparison on this point, see Cer- vantes, 'The devils of Queretaro', op. cit., 65-7.</page><page sequence="17">May 1994 Magic, medicine and gender in Mexico 205 Dreams do not have either a natural or a supernatural power from God to provide the kind of information diviners seek in them. Every good Christian must abandon this preoccupation with interpreting dreams. Since dreams can arise from many different causes, the uneducated members of the faith cannot determine precisely the reason the dreams arose. Because the devil is so subtle, he can quickly deceive the devotees of this superstition.66 Another prominent Spanish figure who probably influenced the prosecutor's stand was Del Rio, who also dedicated a comparatively large part to the phenomenon of dreams in his wider inquest, proposing the category of the 'preternatural' - for such and other phenomena that appeared miraculous - because they were 'natural' in more than the usual sense. Thus the outstanding question of the reality of magical tools like dreams was carried forward in late sixteenth-century Spain and passed on to the New World's theologians and Inquisitors. 67 On the margins of his discourse, the Mexican prosecutor noted that the deeds, dreams and cures to which Montoya had confessed proved that she was indeed a sorceress 'and a superstitious person', but some of the magic she used, such as the dreams themselves, were actually still in doubt. It was Fr Juan de Torres, one of the Dominican priests, the tribunal's counsellors on theological questions, who advised the prosecutor that magic which was'not administered by means of food or potions' was acceptable and licit, and was an inseparable part of the 'formal doctrine of the Doctors of the Church'. The learned priest clearly referred here to the church's monopoly on the uses of charms, blessings, holy water, exorcism, sacramentals, etc. that were branded earlier as superstitious and magical by the European Reformers. Moreover, there was a crucial issue raised here. It was the implicit recognition by men of the church that there was an interrelationship between 'high' and 'low' magic, and that in some forms they might have been directly linked. The case of Montoya did, indeed, bring out these concerns. In her study of Modena, O'Neil has also highlighted this point, by stressing the possibility that 'many magical remedies developed as extensions of the remedial functions of orthodox religion rather than from some wholly separate non-Christian source',68 somewhat in contrast to what Carlo Ginzburg would have indicated. But the Mexican priest had also emphasized the already existing concern of the tribunal over a more precise definition of the border line between diabolism and heresy, and the by-then far less sinister superstitions, some of which would have already been conceived as unreal. Another point of rationality and scepticism in the prosecutor's 'propositions for consideration' was his treatment of a healer's possible blame for not having applied the appropriate remedial means by which the patient could have been cured, or, in other words, the question of malpractice. As in the case of conventional medicine of that time, the prosecutor denied the blame for direct negligence, and thus left room for natural causation beyond the ability of the healer to control. Therefore Don Miguel's death, following Montoya's treatment of his ailment with a variety of curing procedures, should 66Pedro Ciruelo's a Treatise Reproving All Superstitions, op. cit., 135. 67 On this development see also Stuart Clark, 'The scientific status of demonology' in B.

I9: NO. 2 not have been sufficient grounds, in the prosecutor's eyes, to denounce her for possible manslaughter. This last point was quite significant with regard to the more general polemic of the church over magic and its malevolent outcomes. Returning to the prosecutor's predicament in the case of Isabel de Montoya: after the denunciation of an explicit pact with the Devil was finally accepted as dubious, he turned to cautiously examining the 'hard' evidence. This trend on his part was, indeed, quite compatible with the recent current of empiricism. Relying on the unrivalled expertise of Indians in native medicine, the Inquisitors were asked to call in some of the most prominent Indian herb specialists, to give their verdict on whether the substances used by Montoya were malevolent. Juan Domingo and Catalina Maria, herb and medicine specialists from Mexico City's main square, concluded their inspection by declaring the substances to be entirely benevolent and falling within the limits of conventional medicine. The same verdict was given by their colleagues, Adrian Domingo, a ladino Indian (Spanish-speaker and 'acculturated') and Maria Magdalena, both 'of noble descent'.69 On 20 September 1663, during the last session of the Holy Office of Mexico City concerning the case of Isabel de Montoya, the prosecutor finally withdrew his demonological argument and concentrated instead on what concerned both theologians and Inquisitors most - Montoya's religious deviance, including false visions, illicit communication with the saints and the rejection of the sacrament of confession. The last point clearly transgressed the limits of individual authority and choice drawn by the church, especially by women. Moreover, it also corresponded to contemporary accu- sations put forward against some of the beatas in Spain.70 The public proclamation of Montoya's sentence took place on Sunday morning, 4 May I664, at the chapel of the Santo Domingo convent in Mexico City. Present were Don Diego de Villegas of the Santiago Order, the Inquisitors and many other honorary citizens. Examining the sentence, we can clearly identify the paramount stress placed on reforming women such as Montoya, by placing her under the direct supervision of the church, as well as dissolving those women's recognized spheres of influence - the alternative establishments of healing and ritual. The Inquisitors' verdict emphasized the malevolent consequences of unsupervised healing by women such as Isabel de Montoya, and its injurious influence on the religious and moral conduct of society at large. And Montoya, as a model for the rest, was prohibited from healing in the future, and from teaching others to cure or 'augment their knowledge on the virtues of herbs'. To be able to reform her individual conduct, and return her safely to Catholic orthodoxy, Montoya was sentenced to serve the poor, perpetually, in the Am6r del Dios hospital of Mexico City, where she had stayed twelve years earlier. In the course of her three-year penance she was to recite the Rosary Cycle every Friday, on her knees, facing the altar at the hospital's chapel. On i8 June a man, who was said to have been sent from the Am6r del Dios hospital, entered the main hall of the Holy Office palace in Mexico City and told the Inquisitors that Isabel de Montoya had died there that day. It was only a month since she had begun Ms Lea x6o, op. cit., fols 275v, 28ir: 11.7.1662. 70 ibid., fol. 336v.</page><page sequence="19">May 1994 Magic, medicine and gender in Mexico 2o7 serving her penance, but she had suffered more than two years of imprisonment, interrogations and torture under the wheel. She was close to fifty years old and suffering from incurable pneumonia, which was apparently the cause of her death.7' Finally, what is striking in the Inquisition's attitude towards the case of Isabel de Montoya is the lack of concern over the question of race. The Inquisitors themselves, as well as the witnesses, referred to Montoya's and her accomplices' racial descent, but only for the sake of classification and description of an outer appearance - and also in the sense that the witnesses' descriptions were often blurred or conflicting. The question of race was, nowhere throughout the discourse, merged with the denunciations, the verdict or with the theological polemic. Gender, in contrast, was constantly brought up in the Inquisitorial proceedings. The quite ordinary preconceptions of women as easily tempted by the Devil, women as the cause of promiscuity and moral decay, as well as the more particular allegations pertaining to Montoya and her colleagues' deviances beyond the issue of healing, received substantial attention in the discourse. Moreover, the rivalry over the misappropriation of magic and the powers to mediate with the supernatural and communicate with the saints, and also women's capacity to defraud and defeat men by the use of 'superstitious practices' such as sorcery and love magic were the most vehement anxieties of the Inquisitors in the case of Isabel de Montoya. The ever-growing popularity of folk-healing among the different social strata, and its functioning as a haven for alternative ritual procedures, was conceived by the church as calling for its direct intervention, in order to relieve society of this state of 'moral chaos'. Healing, and its repression, however, was only the direct consequence of all these concerns in late seventeenth-century Mexico. University of Haifa 71 ibid., fol. 348r.</page></plain_text>
