<plain_text><page sequence="1">Parent Birds and Their Young. Alex ander F. Skutch. 503 pp. University of Texas Press, 1976. $27.50. With more than 200 titles on avian subjects to his credit, Alexander Skutch has contributed more to our under standing of the breeding biology of neo tropical birds than any other individual, living or dead. In this work he has ex panded his geographical horizons to create an artfully written worldwide survey of the reproductive biology of birds, from pair formation to the attain ment of independence of the young. The book is a successful, though not de finitive, synthesis in an area where no other exists. Skutch states modestly in the preface that only a fraction of the observations presented in the book are his, yet this would be a far thinner volume if all mention of the author's own findings were omitted from it. The emphasis is, therefore, predictably on tropical forms. Despite the formidable bibliography (over 800 titles), several deserving "life history studies" escape mention, and certain well-studied avian groups (e.g. the birds of prey) receive little atten tion. The literature survey was appar ently concluded in 1972. Nevertheless, the book contains such a wealth of ex amples that most readers will be satia ted, and one is compelled to wonder how Skutch managed to produce such a work while writing at his remote farm in Costa Rica, far from the resources of a modern university library. For professional biologists the most provocative chapter of the book is the last. Here Skutch presents in updated form his reasons for supporting the theory of adjusted reproduction, in which the reproductive rate of birds is determined by their annual mortality, and his arguments against the theory of maximum reproduction, popularized by the late David Lack, in which annual mortality is determined by the rate of reproduction. This section and others in the book should offer lively fare for many a vertebrate seminar. Some biologists will chafe at Skutch's occasional anthropomorphic excursions (not lapses, since they are intentional), but they will be able to detect few fac tual errors in the book. Both the gener</page><page sequence="2">ally easygoing tone of the text, which is virtually free of graphs or other quanti tative treatments of data, and the costly format suggest that the book is intend ed more for the sophisticated lay reader (and book buyer) than for the profes sional biologist or graduate student. De spite this, I recommend it as a useful supplement to the existing college or nithology texts and as simply enter taining reading for anyone who enjoys birds.?Lloyd F.
