A High Church clergyman once told me he enjoyed nothing so much as a "good stiff book of theology." Tennyson and Personification is good, stiff and ultimately theological. Alfred Tennyson is neither stiff nor theological and whether you think the book good depends on your ideology. Together the two books under review exemplify two aspects of literary theory, the semiotic and the Marxist. Alfred Tennyson, which forms part of the Rereading Literature series edited by Terry Eagleton, lucidly expounds the party line on the nothingness of individual man before the Marxian god, society. Between Shelley and the early Tennyson a "developing bourgeois hegemony" relegated the poet to a marginal from a central position, whence he had addressed "the most important human issues . . . the way a society functions" (18-19). In response Tennyson inferred fron his "solitary waking trances" a metaphysical power to transcend the limitations of language and find himself within a boundless Other. Conversely, he portrayed an Ancient Sage who sought to name the Nameless, or a Ulysses who, like many a Victorian, journeyed from his own realm of bourgeois freedom to the margins of the world. Sinfield aspires to "materialist deconstruction" (74) of Tennyson's major poems, so as to show their significance as primarily political. When, as in In Mem?ri?m, Tennyson's "incantatory" language seems to guarantee "the metaphysical reality toward which it points" (115), it is rooted in</page><page sequence="2">14 "ideological anxieties" (117) about the class struggle and the science-religion conflict, that were decentring man from his apparent unity with the world, his referent. Sinfield can be hoist upon the petard of his own reductionism. Thus "we might view" similarities between the mysticism of Tennyson and Plotinus as evidence that the former "constructed his physical experience" within the framework of ideas that were "determined culturally," so "we" might "rightly" judge Tennyson's belief that his trances pointed toward seme meaning beyond his culture as being a "chimera" (59). Ws might, if we all share Sinfield's materialist assumptions, which are presumably determined by his late twentieth century academic culture. The trouble with reductionism is that you can work it both ways. Likewise, Sinfield views Tennyson's endeavours to name the Nameless as perhaps successful for the religiously inclined, but for those who are not so inclined, "a suppressed admission of failure," beyond which lurk further anxieties, about God, sex, and personal identity. Inability to define or comprehend the divine in words being a commonplace of mystical theology, is a poet's frustration any more surprising than that of a visual artist who cannot portray God in images? Yet if their visions have no basis in reality, why are the mystics impelled, age by age, to describe then? Rather than further deconstruct Sinfield's reductionism?for example by reading his insistent reiterations of Marxist terminology as, like Tennyson's religious language, a cover for personal doubt?I turn to his main contention, that Tennyson's oeuvre make most sense when read politically. "Modern theory, above all, denies the autonomy of the subjective self," which was a major tenet of "conventional nineteenth and twentieth century thought" (65). To analyse away this concept as a "philosophical mistake" is not enough: "its significance</page><page sequence="3">15 is political." Eighteenth-century individualism was "a progressive stage" in the repudiation by "the bourgeoisie, spearheaded often by radical intellectuals," of a "corrupt aristocratic rule," in the name of the freedom, "at least of each European male," to pursue his own legitimate goals (66). Of course human rights should have been extended to slaves, to women and to the working class, which remained voiceless owing to lack of education and the penal tax on newspapers. Yet any extension of freedom can be seen in the context of a gradual change from a closed to an open society. In that evolution Tennyson, with his faith in honest doubt and concern with exact recording, played an honourable part. The openness and pluralism of present-day society should rule out the chronological snobbery and group-thinking inherent in Sinfield's appeal to "modern theory" as supreme authority, his dismissal of the science-religion conflict as no longer an issue for "most educated people" (128-29), or even his claim that this century has a body of "conventional thought." Even more should it rule out his denial of the individual psyche. To say that "the issue of the self is the same as that of the ultimate reality: whether there is any such entity" is another way of saying "N? God, therefore no fI!." If all assumptions are up for discussion, so must be the Lockean principle, cited from Lacan, that "the self is not innate but acquired." One would like to hear a present-day geneticist on "[a child] receives an identity constructed in the world" (67). More soundly, Sinfield claims that In Mem?ri?m witnesses to an anxiety lest Tennyson1s sheer variety of writing point to "instability of cotmiitment and identity" (123). He legitimately opposes the sense of continuing identity in the pessimistic section 78 to that in the optimistic section 125. He goes too far, surely, in rejecting progression (cf. "on stepping-stone of our dead selves") as evidence of inner consistency, and asserting that the poem "is not</page><page sequence="4">16 the representation of a unified self" (124). If the stock of Haliam's death overwhelmed Tennyson's psyche, if he counter-attacked by asserting a will to live and liberalized faith, that does not warrant a denial that the inner battleground existed. In Tennyson, the values of a closed society?imperialism and a knee-jerk reaction in favour of the existing order?warred with those of an open society?scientific curiosity, self-observ?tion, and artistic particularity?until decline set in with the Idylls. To deny the integrity and independence of the self is the first step toward Room 101. Indeed, the deconstructionist movement itself begins to look like a closed society, with its insistent name-dropping, its a priori denial that the imagination can shape or evoke a reality beyond the movement's stockade of permissible discourse, its self-confirming assumption that all texts undermine themselves, that?to adapt C. S. Lewis?literature consists of linguistic noises made by almost nobody about almost nothing. Among Sinfield's virtues as a writer are his clear and engaging prose, his wide knowledge of modern authors and critics, his sensitivity to and evident enjoyment of the all-too-few passages he treats in detail, his refusal to brand Tennyson as a deconstructionist, and his calmly objective placement of the homosexual element in Tennyson's friendship with Haliam, within a survey of the varieties of nineteenth-century male bonding. His chapter "The Importance of Arthur Being" tackles sexuality in both Haliam and the legendary king with an honesty he finds scandalously lacking even in present-day criticism. For all its rigour and alertness, Harris's monograph on "Tithonus" does on occasion treat Tennyson as a late twentieth-century literary theorist. This can only be demonstrated by reference to his complex argument. Harris sees the poem as Tennyson's examination of personification within the new genre of dramatic monologue. Tithonus personifies the personifying</page><page sequence="5">17 process itself, which amounts psychologically to a neurotic or magical fulfilment of sexual desire, and theologically to "theogony," or god-formation. His imagination personifies the dawn not as a character with attributes, like Spenser's Aurora, but as a divinity. His mythologizing leaves him miserable and self-estranged, for, having put on immortality so as to enjoy her sexually, he realizes how her beauty shows up his ugliness. Prosopopeia involves not only personification but impersonation. In this, his only dramatic monologue addressed to a divinity, Tennyson underscores the divine indifference and attacks the notion of sympathy between the human and natural worlds. Since Tithonus experiences with the dawn a relationship only he has chosen, the trope creates the similitude it supposedly has discovered. The "mystic change" as the dawn brightens raises the question how Tennyson can dissolve the trope without destroying his dramatic monologue. He chooses to make Dawn, as signifier, transcend the dawn, her referent, until the dawn becomes imminent within Dawn. To compare Aurora's blush with Dawn's reddening through the gloom is to see how Tennyson fuses cause with effect, treating the dawning as a change in Dawn's body. Her preservation until evening, when she returns in her silver-wheeled chariot, raises the question of how mind can exist without the activity that defines it. Dawn bifurcates into the natural dawn and Apollo's lover. The poet views her as a personification, the speaker as a goddess, but both poet and reader as the dawn, Tithonus having failed to relate his divinity to matter. "The system of signification which results from Tithonus' need to spiritualize matter . . . shows how very much he is prepared to sacrifice in order not to endure a spiritless world." In quoting from the conclusion, I have by-passed the absorbing penultimate chapter, which relates both poem and trope to Tractarian theories of the Incarnation and Eucharist and Sir Edward Burnett Tylor's discussion of animism</page><page sequence="6">18 in Primitive Culture (1871). The relation of referent to signified?of natural dawn to Dawn as anthropomorphic personification?like that between Christ and the divine spirit, is a matter of faith. Is the "mystic change" of Dawn and of the eucharistie elements literal or figurative? To Harris, Newman's teaching on the Real Presence resolved a dilemma that Tithonus could not. Tylor, who also considered the problems of multiple locations and anthropomorphism, found parallels between the animistic and Christian 'incarnations. In the end Sinfield and Harris agree that the religious or mythopoeic quest represents a vain effort to spiritualize a world devoid of the human spirit. To dispute this would take us beyond the province of literary criticism. The value of their books depends on what they have told us by the way. The major flaws of Harris's book are opaqueness and indifference to historical evidence. Though its general drift is clear, tortuous expressions such as Tithonus' envisioning of a "lucid outline" around Dawn being an "autotelic imaginative act that has no sanction in the insensible world" (34), or "the personifier replicating himself in the fonti of a personification . . . undergoes another repetition ... as the shadow or simulacrum of the personification he has made" (56), scarcely assist the reader. More annoyingly, there being no bibliography, one does not gather what lyior did until the first mention of his book, on page 85. Harris adduces fascinating correspondence between Tennyson's practice and the eighteenth-century discussions of personification but nowhere indicates whether Tennyson had read them. Perhaps Haliam had, for his essay "On Sympathy," but this too is not made clear. As an example of Harris's backward projection of deconstructionism, Tithonus's view of Dawn as "only" a goddess being as mistaken as the eighteenth-century view of her as "only" a personification, Tennyson observes</page><page sequence="7">19 the "contiguity of the two modesblurs the boundary between them, and so points the issues raised by their "brusque and disrespectful collocation" (66). One wonders also whether Tennyson himself realized that the Real Presence accomplished in Christian theory what Tithonus could not in psychological practice (98). In that passage Harris, however, shows a restraint apparently beyond Sinfield by not obtruding his own views, or presuming upon his reader's agreement. Neither book is for the inexperienced. Sinfield is constrained by space to often sensitive discussion of snippets, and in any case the reader needs first to form his own impressions of the poems, and to have learned from, say, Christopher Ricks, something of Tennyson's life and background. From Harris, the graduate student or professor can absorb a major insight, that rhetoric and theology present two sides of the same coin, and apprehend correspondences and contrasts between works of poetry and criticism from Spenser to Keats and Hopkins. What few readers are likely to acquire from Harris is a love of the poem. Despite his important claim for Tennyson as a witty and theologically, sensitive poet hitherto denied his intellectual due, and his less plausible one for "Tithonus" as a document central to Victorian culture, his relentless and somewhat reiterative scrutiny leaves one wondering whether even "Tithonus" is worth all this. As Leavisianity divided readers into the elect who squeezed all the sacramental wine they could out of Conrad and Lawrence, and the damned who turned with relief to, among other forbidden authors, Tennyson, so the very exhaustiveness and esotericism of this approach could in time confine the serious study of literary works to a professional elite. Sinfield, at least, conveys a conviction that the poems are worthwhile to read, but how one tires of that un-English word "hegemony."
