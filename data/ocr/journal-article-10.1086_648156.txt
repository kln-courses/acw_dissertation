      <p>Tales of tool‐using crows, dancing cockatoos, teaching ants, and counting monkeys not only capture the public's imagination but form the basis for experimental investigations into the evolution of mind. From its beginnings in the late 19th century, such research has been characterized by tension between anthropomorphism and more mechanistic Cartesian accounts of animals' apparently clever behavior. Anthropomorphism was embraced by supporters of Darwin's claim that the “mental powers” of animals differ “in degree but not in kind” from those of humans, whereas less generous interpretations were supported by experimentalists such as Thorndike, whose findings indicated that “smart” behavior may result from “stupid” mechanisms such as trial‐and‐error learning. The same tension exists today: animals performing feats that look clever by human standards may appear to be thinking and reasoning in a human‐like way, but surprisingly often they are not (and sometimes, despite what they believe, people are not either).</p>

         <italic>The Smartest Animals on the Planet</italic> is a superbly illustrated compendium of the most recent research in this area, including discussions on tool use, communication, social learning, numerical cognition, and communication. Beautiful photographs illustrate fascinating behaviors of species from ants to chimpanzees, maps show where in the world they are found, and clear and elegant drawings show step‐by‐step how their behavior has been studied experimentally. Specialists in the field may disagree with some of Boysen's emphases, but notwithstanding the words “smart” and “clever” in the title, most topics in this book are treated in a balanced way, with due regard for alternatives to anthropomorphism. The title, large format, glossy photographs, and absence of scholarly references suggest that the volume is aimed primarily at general readers, but the informative drawings and impressively up‐to‐date and broad coverage will also be useful to serious students and teachers. Either way, the book seems designed to inspire as well as instruct in that the author does not shy away from unanswered questions and controversial topics such as animal empathy and the possibility of culture.</p>
