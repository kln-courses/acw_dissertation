<plain_text><page sequence="1">401 Notes A HAPPY (RE)MARRLAGE. The catalogue to the recent exhibition at the Herzog August Bibliothek, Wolfenbüttel, is, like the exhibition itself, more important than its size would suggest. Hochzeit von Bild und Buch : Anfänge der Druckgraphik , 1420-15 /5, aus den Beständen der Herzog August Bibliothek by Ad Stijnman (Wiesbaden, Harrassowitz Verlag, 2009, 48 pp., 31 col. and i b. &amp; w. ills., fio), explores the interdependence of the earliest printed texts and images. As explained in the In- troduction, the study deliberately bridges two fields: these ob- jects were made before early printed material was divided into print collections and libraries, and therefore before schol- arship split into the history of graphic art and the history of books. Stijnman concisely offers an alternative history of printing, one free from the long-standing bias against colour in the graphic arts, by demonstrating how the earliest printed material blurs the lines between categories such as text and image, and book and manuscript, in terms of both technique and visual effect. Following a short introductory essay, the catalogue entries fall into five undesignated sections, each arranged roughly chronologically: very early woodcuts, woodcuts printed in colour, engravings (some in colour), metalcuts embedded in text and pasteprints. The examples tend to be outliers, excep- tions to the dominant narratives of the history of woodcut. The catalogue starts with a bang: a woodcut from c. 1420, which is a blind impression, whereas prints, by definition, in- volve ink. Early woodcuts usually lack colour; these carefully selected woodcuts and engravings, however, run the gamut of the very earliest European colour printing, from single-colour prints in red, blue and gold, to multicolour prints from two, three, even four blocks. The focus is on innovations. For in- stance, one example highlights the technical difficulties posed by running a sheet through two kinds of presses to achieve a metalcut illustration surrounded by moveable type, and an- other consists of an engraving with text that imitates the ap- pearance of moveable type. The illustrations make an argument for the link between the development of printers' ornaments in colour and colour illustrations or single-leaf woodcuts. Two of the best known milestones of colour printing are sandwiched between the first image printed in red (printer's mark of Johann Fust and Peter SchöfFer, 1469), a red image surrounded by black images (printer's mark of Jacobinus Suigus and Nicolaus de Bene- dicts, 1495), and a page with both images and texts alternat- ing in red and black (title-page to Celse Hugues Descousu, Divi Hieronimi..., printed by Stephanus Balam in 1509). The missing link between adjacent images in different colours and multicolour images is the printer's mark of Erhard Ratdolt, a two-colour image in red and black. However, the first three- colour illustration (a lunar eclipse from Ratdolt's Sphaerae mundi , originally published in Venice in 1485) and a four- colour woodcut that was also the first multicolour print in Germany (a bishop from Ratdolt's 1487 Obsequíale Augustense) situate Ratdolt both at the core of this section of the cata- logue and also in the evolution of colour printing. This visual narrative of the earliest history of colour in printed books concludes by leaping to the only black-and-white image in the book, a seventeenth-century reissue of a sixteenth-century single-sheet Italian chiaroscuro woodcut, which is comparative material rather than core evidence. The high quality and generous size of the illustrations allow for close visual analysis of the objects, many of which are of great rarity and technical interest; all are available in high resolution through the online database shared by the Herzog August Bibliothek in Wolfenbüttel and the Herzog Anton Ulrich-Museum in Braunschweig, virtuelles-kupfer- stichkabinett.de. There are a few small errors - Albrecht Dürer did not make chiaroscuro woodcuts himself, as all known colour impressions of his woodcuts are actually posthumous reissues from the Netherlands - but they do not detract from the value of the text. Although many entries raise more questions than they answer due to their brevity (most hover around three to five sentences), a vast amount of information is packed into this small exhibition catalogue. L. ELIZABETH UPPER MERCENARIES AND TURKS. The Museum Boij- mans Van Beuningen has acquired two exceptional sets of hand-coloured woodcuts from a private collection. The prints date from around 1530 and were made by the Nurem- berg artists Sebald Beham, Erhard Schön, Niklas Stoer and Peter Flötner. For more than 50 years after they were sold from the collection of the princes of Liechtenstein they were thought to have been lost. From 5 December 2009 until 7 March 2010 they were exhibited for the first time in the Rot- terdam Print Room. The two series were published by Hans Guldenmund and Nielas Meldeman in Nuremberg. The dimensions of the sheets and the format, a combination of woodcut and text in letterpress, are very similar. The texts are attributed to the same author, the celebrated Nuremberg shoemaker-poet Hans Sachs. Thematically the sets belong together, as pen- dants of a kind, with German and Swiss soldiers of fortune on one side and Turkish soldiers and their leaders on the other. They can only be understood in their historical con- text, closely linked as they are with the struggle for hegemony in Europe being waged at this time. One set (inv. no. MB 2010/ 1 a-t) consists of twenty sheets of 'lansquenets', Swiss and German mercenaries who played a major rôle in the wars being fought at that time. Lan- squenets were feared - on the field of battle and beyond. If they were not paid on time they constituted a real threat to the civilian population. At the same time their footloose lifestyle was a source of fascination, and they were conspicu- ous in their flamboyant dress: close-fitting breeches with ex- aggerated codpieces, doublets with slashed sleeves and broad-brimmed hats with enormous plumes. The bright shades used in these hand-tinted impressions provide a unique insight into just how colourful lansquenets' outfits were.

There were various func- tionaries in a regiment, who were responsible for specific du- ties such as justice, policing and provisions. Individual prints of lansquenets had already been designed by Dürer, Cranach and others, but the series by Guldenmund and Meldeman is the earliest devoted to this subject, illustrating for the first time the various offices and positions - from common foot soldier to 'Doppelsoldner' (a soldier who received double pay), 'Feld- waybeF (corporal of the field), 'Profos' (provost marshal) and 'Schuldthos' (judge advocate). Lansquenets were infantrymen whose weapons of choice were the pike, the halberd and the sword. In the early sixteenth century arquebusiers and mus- keteers were still in the minority in the regiment, but they are also represented. The 'Büchsenmayster' loading his weapon, designed by Sebald Beham, is arguably the finest print in the set (fig. 218). The second series (inv. no. MB 2010/2 a-r), depicting Turkish soldiers and their commanders, is of immense cul- tural and historical value. The Ottoman Empire, with its cap- ital of Constantinople, was in the ascendant. Turkish forces advanced towards the heart of Europe, laying siege to Vienna in 1529. Among the many woodcuts issued in response to this historical event, Guldenmund's set is outstanding. With three poignant illustrations of the atrocities inflicted on the civilian population - during the Siege of Vienna the countryside around the city was ravaged by pillage, arson and murder - it was clearly playing to anti-Turkish feeling. These sheets show Ottoman soldiers butchering women and children and carrying off peasants as prisoners. Most of the prints in Guldenmund's series do not, though, reflect anti-Turkish sen- timent. Taken as a whole, they actually reveal a degree of re- spect for the enemy, with the mighty Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent at the head of a procession of outlandishly clad soldiers on horseback or riding a dromedary (fig. 219). The accompanying texts stress the precision and accuracy with which everything has been rendered. Here again, as in the case of the lansquenet set, we see a fascination with the exotic fuelled by a combination of fear and admiration. Two of these eighteen woodcuts do not belong to the Turks series, but they have been kept with the other prints for two cen- turies. They are probably the sole survivors of a set of Russ- ian figures, likewise designed by Schön and published by Guldenmund. One print depicts Vasili III, who was Grand Prince of Moscow from 1505 to 1533, the other shows a Mus- covite on horseback. According to the accompanying text, the Muscovites were as much of a threat as the Turks. The prints of lansquenets and Turks must have been very widespread in their day, but nowadays they are extremely rare. Apart from another hand-coloured impression of Beham's portrait of Grand Vizier Ibrahim Pasha in the British Museum, the series of Turks seems to be unique in this state. Some of the single lansquenet sheets are unique as well, others are known only in a few impressions or later states. Stuck on walls, their fragile paper exposed to light, damp and dirt, all the other impressions have been lost over the years. The two rediscovered sets escaped this fate. The superb condition of the sheets suggests that they were never hung on a wall but were stored in an album by a collector from early on. Before they were acquired by Johann II, Prince of Liechtenstein, in 1883 they had belonged to the German art scholar Joseph Heller (1758-1849) and the Austrian gen- eral Franz Ritter von Hauslab (1798-1883). The lansquenet and Turks series are described in Max Geisberg's Der deutsche Einblattholzschnitt (lansquenets: nos. 274, 276, 278-79, 832, 1198-1201, 1203-06, 1209, 1221, 1365, 1367- 6g&gt; '371; Turks: 297-99, 1219, 1239-40, 1242-43, 1288, 1382- 88) and partly in The Illustrated Bartsch ( Vol. ij Commentary). The best descriptions can be found in Ursula Mielke's Hollstein volume on Erhard Schön (2000), who expresses some doubts on the attribution of the lansquenets to Schön. A tentative re- construction of the complete lansquenet series, consisting of 50 separate woodcuts, was made by Birgit von Seggern in her dissertation, Der Landsknecht im Spiegel der Renaissancegraphik um i 500-1540 (Bonn 2003, pp. 574-94). It should be noted that until now most of the illustrations in art historical publica- tions - even those in Hollstein and Bartsch - are reproduced after nineteenth-century tracings and facsimiles. The Boij- mans has published a free brochure with small illustrations of all prints {Landsknechten en Türken. Een teruggevonden schat uit de Duitse renaissance / Mercenarìes and Turks. A Recovered Treasure from the German Renaissance , Rotterdam 2009, 16 pp., 45 col. ills.). Further research, analysis and scholarly publication is planned. PETER VAN DER COELEN VENICE AND DÜRER. Did Dürer's Woman of the Apoc- alypse and the Seven-headed Dragon inspire mosaics in St Mark's Basilica? This question is raised by two images of striking sim- ilarity (figs. 220 and 221). These images - a woodcut and a mosaic - clearly depict the same subject-matter, namely the Woman of the Apocalypse and the Seven-headed Dragon, the incarnation of evil, as described in a passage from the Revelation of St John. The woodcut (fig. 220) is one of a series of fifteen created c. 1497 by Dürer constituting his cycle of The Apocalypse. The mosaic, which adorns the north wall of the west vault of St Mark's Basilica, is the work of the broth- ers Francesco and Domenico Zucatto, who in about 1570 were working under the general supervision of Titian on the mosaic decoration of St Mark's. For obvious reasons of chronology, the mosaic is based on the woodcut rather than vice versa. Dürer enjoyed extensive contact with Venice, visiting the city at least once and probably twice. During his sojourns he was actively engaged in selling his prints and promoting his reputation, interacting with and indeed competing with the local artistic community. His prints circulated freely in Venice and were frequently copied by Italian engravers, particularly by Marcantonio Raimondi. Indeed, Dürer's 1505-08 visit was in part occasioned by his desire to take action in the Venetian courts to end pirating of his prints. He won a Pyrrhic victory when the courts required Raimondi only to remove Dürer's initials from the copies that Raimondi made and sold without recompense to Dürer. Moreover, the entire series of Dürer's Apocalypse was copied by Italian woodcutters and published in Venice by Alessandro Paganini in 1515-16. Thus, it seems highly likely that a copy of Dürer's image of the Woman of the Apocalypse , which was so easily available to the Zucatto brothers, served as the model on which they based their mo- saic. It seems extraordinary that this borrowing has gone un- noticed in the extensive literature on the mosaics (B. Bertoli, Le storìe di San Marco nei mosaici e le ragioni dell'agiografia , n.l., n.d., [1993?], pp. 89-124; La basilica di San Marco arte e simbolo- gia , edited by B. Bertoli, Venice 1993.

It is gratifying that students of history in the widest sense are coming to realize that they need to study prints to gain a fuller understanding of their subject, and that prints must be approached with the same consideration of context as any other sort of historical document. The book is based on papers given at two conferences connected with Michael Hunter's project to create a database of early British prints (www.bpil 700.org.uk). Organizers of conferences often feel under pressure to publish papers in book form, but the ques- tion has to be raised whether the useful contributions pub- lished here might not have found a wider audience elsewhere. The book is alarmingly expensive and has only a small print run: it is arguable that the essays would have been more accessible in specialist journals or on Hunter's database. It may be that these financially straitened times will encour- age greater acceptance in academic circles of online publish- ing. For readers of Prìnt Quarterly it is likely that essays dealing with how prints were produced and received by contempo- raries will be of most interest. The first four essays, grouped together as 'Printed Images and the Reformation', prove fruitful. Religious controversy dominated life in early modern Britain, and prints could be clear - and sometimes dangerous - signals of the position of publisher or patron. Book illus- trations are of particular interest to Hunter and to several of his contributors. Margaret Aston's essay investigates the un- ease prevalent at that time over the depiction of the God- head, which resulted in the adoption of the Hebrew tetragrammaton to replace the conventional elderly bearded God the Father and of the trigram 'IHS' to stand for Christ. The latter was established before the Reformation, but be- came extremely problematic once the Jesuits had adopted it as their badge. The tetragrammaton first appeared in Ger- man prints in 1529 and was introduced into England in Hol- bein's design for the title-page to the 1535 Coverdale Bible. At that date the English Church under Henry VIII was still fairly relaxed about images, and the use of the tetragramma- ton was an indication of advanced Reformist views. As the century progressed, attitudes hardened. This could lead to difficulties when publishers reused old woodblocks in- cluding images that were no longer acceptable. It is hard to find an exact modern parallel for Reformation anxiety about images, but Islamic sensitivity towards the representation of Mohammed comes to mind. Both Aston and Richard L. Williams discuss the use of old blocks to illustrate the Bishop's Bible of 1568 where the figure of God the Father was altered to the tetragrammaton on the title-page, but in other in- stances remained unchanged. Such recutting of old blocks was often clumsily done: Williams draws attention to a wood- block of The Creation of Eve in the 1569 Christian Prayers and Meditations , where the Hebrew letters replace the upper part of the body of God the Father, but his robe and feet emerge below. Williams questions the extent to which changes were a matter of self-censorship by publishers anticipating, or re- sponding to, vociferous demands from Reformers, rather than the result of formal government intervention. He concludes that self-censorship would have been the norm: certainly the second edition of the Bishop's Bible in 1572 included no il- lustrations that might be open to criticism. In the tense at- mosphere following the Northern Rebellion of 1569 and the 1570 Papal Bull of Excommunication on Elizabeth I, which released English Catholics from the obligation of loyalty to their queen, any publisher would have been extremely wary of printing images that might hint at Roman Catholic incli- nations. A carefully considered iconography appropriate to the Reformed church developed. Tara Harding looks at how prints were used as sources for architectural decoration in de- vout Protestant homes in the first half of the seventeenth cen- tury. Heads of households encouraged piety by incorporating religious imagery into plasterwork and wall painting, but there could be no echoes of Roman Catholic worship: the Crucifixion was replaced by its Old Testament préfiguration, the Sacrifice of Isaac; the tetragrammaton was used to stand for God the Father. Harding's essay draws on her post-grad- uate research on decoration in the 'godly household' and it is encouraging that young scholars are developing Anthony Wells-Cole's ground-breaking work on prints as sources for architectural decoration {The Art of Decoration in Elizabethan and Jacobean England: The Influence of Continental Prìnts, 1558-1625, New Haven and London 1997); in a later essay Katherine Acheson observes that the highly influential illustrations in Conrad Gesner's Historìae animalium (Zurich 1551-58) were sources, among much else, for interior decoration. Alexandra Walsham discusses another type of subject- matter with religious connotations and politically charged meaning: William Dugdale's Monasticon Angličanům (1655-73) and his History of St PauVs Cathedral (1658), which together in- clude nearly 200 illustrations, many by Wenceslaus Hollar. The prints have been appreciated since the late eighteenth century for their antiquarian interest, but when first published their meaning was much more contentious. They were re- minders of the Roman Catholic past, whether viewers looked on them with regretful nostalgia (as was clearly the case with some of the subscribers who had funded plates), or as warn- ings against potential backsliding. Ruined medieval monas- teries were seen by some as architectural fossils that might remind the faithful of past errors, to others they ran the risk of acting as a focus for a resurgence of the old faith and should be made 'utterly extinct'. In the late sixteenth century the risks involved led historians and publishers to avoid illus- trations of such buildings. Attitudes had changed by the 1630s, when not only St Paul's but also neglected parish churches were being refurbished as part of Archbishop Laud's drive to restore the 'beauty of holiness', but the fol- lowing decade saw reaction and wholesale iconoclasm. Dug- dale was galvanized into recording these monuments by the risk that they might perish altogether. The four essays dealing with 'Printed Images and Politics' might be expected to work together in the same way as those discussing religious imagery, but the authors take such differ- ent approaches that there is no cross-referencing or cumula- tive effect. This is not to say that their contributions are not of interest individually. Like the writers of earlier essays, Mal- colmjones pays attention to how prints reflect subtle changes in attitude over relatively short periods of time. He investi- gates The Common Weale's Canker Wörmes , or the Locusts both of Church and State, a print known only in two surviving impres- sions that was previously assumed to date from the 1650s. The iconography combines traditional medieval images of Death PRINT QUARTERLY, XXVII, 2010, 4</page><page sequence="7">NOTES 407 with familiar satires on the professions, but Jones argues con- vincingly that topical references date it firmly to the mid- 1620s. He points to a forceful anti-Jesuit, anti-Spanish message expressing Puritan anxiety about growing tolerance of Roman Catholicism on the part of state authorities. Two crucial characters among the ten portrayed are Henry Gar- nett, confessor to the Gunpowder Plotters (in the 1620s radi- cal Puritans were energetically raising memories of the Plot), and the hated Spanish Ambassador, Count Gondomar. The richness of Jones's sources places this print - and by extension others - within a vital context of religious and political con- troversy in which pamphlets, plays and ballads all played a part. Jones even links the print to a speech by the Speaker of the House of Commons anticipating the banning of the Je- suits in 1624: 'the generation of locusts, the Jesuits and semi- nary priests, which were wont to creep in corners [will be] blown over the sea'. Helen Pierce's essay looks at prints produced 50 years later in the flowering of English visual satire towards the end of the reign of Charles II. She focusses on Roger L'Estrange, Li- censer of the Press (effectively state censor) from 1662-79. L'Estrange's scepticism about the alleged Popish Plot to assas- sinate the King in 1678 led to accusations that he was a crypto- Catholic. He was portrayed in several satirical prints as 'Towser', a large spotted dog, and retaliated with his own at- tack on the Puritans, The Committee , a fine print after a drawing by Francis Barlow. Pierce quotes a lengthy annotation alluding to The Committee on one of the an ti-L' Estrange prints, Strange' s Case Strangfe] ly Altered , citing it as evidence of a contemporary 'dialogue between images'. The print was attributed by a number of contemporaries to Stephen College, the 'Protestant joiner' who made wooden effigies for anti-Catholic proces- sions as well as designing prints and who ended his life on the gallows convicted of treason - a powerful indication of the importance attached to satirical prints by the political class. The remaining essays are grouped together as 'Printed Images in Science and Cartography' and 'Printed Images and Aspects of Late Seventeenth-Century Culture'. These classi- fications are somewhat arbitrary and are not helpful to the reader. Other connections might just as well have been made. Lori Anne Ferrell's essay might have been included with those looking at the effect of the Reformation on prints. She dis- cusses the diagrammatic modes introduced by Protestant pro- pagandists to explain abstract concepts (William Perkins's 'ocular catechism' of 1600 is an example) and argues that such didactic aids helped the dissemination of a wider range of ideas: innovative use of diagrams was, for instance, made in a 1570 translation of Euclid and in Arthur Hopton's man- ual on surveying, Speculum Topographicum (London 161 1). Gill Saunders' account of printed wallpapers in middle-class homes could have been linked to Harding's essay on 'godly interiors', or - since Saunders uses information gleaned from letters by John Evelyn and others intended to contribute to a Royal Society history of trades - with Ben Thomas's essay, which also considers the Royal Society's new interest in the mechanical arts. Thomas places Prince Rupert's demonstra- tion of mezzotint and John Evelyn's accounts of the tech- nique in that context. He points out that the erosion of traditional deference to ancient authority allowed scholars not only to initiate empirical experiment, but also to consider seriously what had previously been overlooked as menial ac- tivity. A focus on the production rather than the reception and use of prints links the essays of Simon Turner and David Alexander, who look at the work of some of the major print- makers of the seventeenth century. Turner draws attention to Wenceslaus Hollar's mapmaking, incidentally providing an exhaustive bibliography for the artist. Alexander discusses the perennially important (but currently surprisingly unfashion- able) subject of portraits, specifically engravings of the later Stuart period. He provides a valuable survey of the subject, and a much needed listing of portraits made by David Log- gan* Michael Hunter's introduction is a useful overview of six- teenth- and seventeenth-century printmaking in England. Other essays look at how ballad illustrations might introduce new fashions to a wider audience (Clare Backhouse and Angela McShane), at portraits of George Villiers, Duke of Buckingham (Alastair Bellany), at book illustrations as expres- sions of the association of church and state (Justin Cham- pion), and at the print and its relationship to reality as considered by seventeenth-century philosophers (Matthew Hunter). SHEILA O'CONNELL RELIGIOUS IMAGINATION. Some books must be sipped, not gulped, because they have been distilled from long research and erudition. The large, richly illustrated volume by Christine Göttler, Last Things: Art and Religious Imagination in the Age of Reform (Turnhout, Brepols, 2010, 472 pp., 25 col. and 156 b. &amp; w. ills., ť 130) must be counted among them, for its author, formerly Professor of the University of Washing- ton and now at the University of Berne, has been working on this material for the better part of two decades; portions of it appeared already within her published dissertation on imagery of Purgatory after the Reformation, Die Kunst des Fegefeuers nach der Reformation (Mainz, 1996). Here Göttler broadens her scope to the 'Four Last Things' (Death, Purga- tory, Hell, Heaven) in art of the Counter-Reformation, and her geographical sweep features artists from Italy, Germany, Flanders and Spain in a variety of media, often neglected, besides painting and sculpture: wax tableaux and life-sized sculpted and painted tableaux, manuscripts, even the garden of Bomarzo, plus prints and printed books. Her book offers up a feast for readers of this Journal, exemplifying the best kind of truly interdisciplinary study of religion, visual culture and the relevant social history of patrons and consumers of these art works. The title accurately reveals the book's contents. Göttler's focus also permits her to establish the importance for the Catholic Reformation of the later sixteenth and early seven- teenth centuries of private and personal meditation on the disposition of the soul. At the heart of her discussion are the set of four heads, first represented in four engravings by the Munich court printmaker, Raphael Sadeler (figs. 222-25), but then refashioned in wax by Giovanni Bernardino Azzolino and others for such patrons as Marcantonio Doria of Genoa and Cardinal Federico Borromeo in Milan and soon widely replicated in various media, including Bernini marbles and Spanish paintings. These portrait-like presentations for pious courtly patrons model the torments and bliss of the eternal soul for an individual viewer and evoke emotional responses that foster penance and personal 'shaping' of the soul.

But the clear association of the rôle of faith as well as the Church's efficacy in redeeming souls from Purgatory had already been estab- lished in imagery by the fifteenth century, particularly within the context of the image of the miraculous Mass of St Gre- gory and its associated indulgences described in chapter one. Chapter two, 'Sites for the Devout', discusses how the re- lationship between seeing and believing is also epitomized by the evolving displays with life-sized figures and full settings and characters of the New Testament events at the Sacro Monte at Varallo, chiefly created by Gaudenzio Ferrari. Göt- tiens focus on the Last Things, however, leads her to consider a segment of this favourite site that remains virtually un- known because it was never completed as planned: Galeazzo Alessi's designs for further, subterranean chapels of Limbo, Hell and Purgatory, conceived 21s detached and voyeuristic viewing sites rather than as interactive experiences in the round like the prior sites. Göttler insightfully relates this more scopic sensation to the altered sense of the image and the im- portance of imagery understood as representation alone, not as an icon, after the Council of Trent. She also compares the separation of visitors from their religious events as akin to the new institution of the confessional, formulated at exactly the same moment. Linking late medieval manuscripts to later sixteenth-cen- tury meditational books, chiefly produced by Jesuits through Antwerp publishers, the theme of the Four Last Things shows a clear continuity - too often ignored by scholars on either side of the Reformation divide - between the meditation practices of the Jesuits and their precedents in fifteenth-cen- tury treatises, such as the 'mirrors for sinners'. Sometimes this personalized imagery was elaborated in Counter-Reforma- tion-era illustrations by professional engravers in Antwerp, 21s in Anton Wierix's series dedicated to the relationship between the fervent heart of the believer and the youthful Jesus: see related studies by Walter Melion on this engraver and his Je- suit programmes, as well as on Wierix's illustrations for med- itations on the New Testament by Jerome Nadal. Another analysis considers a pair of major seventeenth-century Jesuit meditation manuals - by Antoine Suquet (1625), illustrated by Boëtius à Bolswert, and by Jeremias Drexel (1621), illus- trated by Raphael Sadeler. At other times, religion was connected to visualized places, whether physical sites like Varallo or mental constructs, such as the religious version of memory palaces or maps for Par- adise or Hell. These are covered in chapters three and six. This kind of imagery also found expression in representations of Hell or the Temptations of St Anthony at the start of the seventeenth century by Flemish painters, chiefly Jan Bruegel, who extended the demon-filled, fire-landscape formulas of Hieronymus Bosch from a century earlier. Chapter seven per- ceptively discusses these neglected works in the context of the Four Last Things rather than their usual genealogy as part of the later history of Boschian forms. Bruegel's 'poetic' Hells found a mythic counterpart in fire landscapes featuring Vul- can. A brief review cannot capture the range of insights and details - from all across Catholic Europe - that enliven this book with specific persons, places, and programmes related to the larger theme, which still manages to remain coherent and powerfully cogent for Counter-Reformation religious practice using visual culture. LARRY SILVER C ALLOT EXTRAORDINAIRE. It could be a fox, but I would call it a dog, the kind of dog Callot liked, with the lion haircut, keeping a tight rein on a sort of dinosaur vomiting spears, halberds, arrows and guns at the hermit. Or it could be a pilgrim, yes, with the shell on the shoulder, the staff be- tween the paws and the flask at the belt. It is that 'fox-pil- grim', that 'renard-pèlerin', as the Lorenese artist etched it in his Temptation of St Anthony (second version), who gives its mysterious title to the most unusual and astounding book that Paillette Choné has devoted to Jacques Callot (Remrd-pèlerìn: Mémoires de Jacques Callot écrìts par lui-même , Paris, Le Bruit du temps, 2009, 264 pp., i b. &amp; w. ill., €22). Strange the title, ambiguous the subtitle. Extraordinary also the writing, the style, the vocabulary of Choné, who gives the impression of creating her own language, graceful, pleas- ant, flowery, suggestive and therefore effective. At the begin- ning, a lot of short notes, prose poems of a sort; perhaps she had in mind an emblem book, in which Callot's character got naturally included. To dig in the archives often seems boring to those who do not know how to search or find: next to the expected nuggets a lot of scoria comes to the surface that one doesn't know what to do with at the time except to put it aside in some cas- ket: a name, a craft, a strange deal, a forgotten object, a weird situation, an uncommon word - and all that ordinary stuff describing the everyday life around the stars that we are in- terested in: in this way Choné has come to know by their first name all the neighbours of Callot's family, and a lot more about the printmaker himself in the Lorenese, Roman and Florentine archives, in published and as yet unpublished doc- uments. The organization of the 'memoirs' is chronological. The artist, sick, convinced he is at the end of his life, drafts them at the same time that he is composing his second version of the Temptation , hoping for some consolation for the unfortu- nate destruction of the first one, unknowingly concluding the cycle of his prints with a final masterpiece. These reminis- cences are written for the attention of a supposed mistress, created by Choné at the same moment she describes the St Amon print (the only illustration in the book, used as a fron- tispiece) that she so intently scrutinized that she detected in it a secret love story: a triangle she draws between the glances of a young woman seated, lost in her thoughts, those of an unpleasant man who is listening no more than her to the saintly preacher, and those of Callot, half masked by his own print frame. Such is the book, plaiting 'true' and 'false' into a precious dialectic that bewitches the reader lost in that world of im- ages. A mixture of invention and commentary. It is so re- markable that, after reading the postscript where the author herself admits to some confusion, one begins not to believe in the apocryphal nature of those memoirs and even hopes they could be genuine. Working in small strokes, in short chapters of one or few pages, the author avoids overwhelming the readers with her scholarship. On the contrary, she arouses their curiosity. She tries to bring back to life the moment when the works were created. Although she avoids the pica- resque vein associated with the name of Callot since the Ro- PRENT QUARTERLY, XXVII, 2010, 4</page><page sequence="10">410 NOTES man tics, Choné gives flesh to the character, gives him style and judgement, a sort of innocence that makes him most like- able. And we love to love the artists whose works we love. The book is a delight for C allot connoisseurs, who can al- ways believe themselves to be among the happy few able to catch the subtle allusions that Choné scatters throughout. She just glides, not stressing the references to the prints, even if a large part of the œuvre shows through. Readers would be well advised, for their own satisfaction and to make sure they are able to give the right answers to the author's quiz, to keep on hand the catalogue of the large exhibition organized at Nancy in 1992 for the fourth centenary and, next to it, the catalogue of the drawings by Daniel Ternois. How to read this book? Certainly not all in one go. One has to savour it, to nibble it. Moreover, it can bear several readings, often going back and forth. But how to understand it? As a - very successful - straightforward literary exercise? As an attempt - also successful - to reconstruct an epoch's atmosphere? As an essay on Jacques Callot? Certainly. All of that at the same time and nothing of that? What remains for the reader is the supreme delectation of having taken part in an uncommon experiment. I fear, however, that this book, which deserves to be more widely read, will remain a hapax legomenon because it is almost impossible to translate. MAXIME PRÉAUD REYNOLDS' COLLECTION OF WORKS ON PAPER. In 2007 a group of portraits by Sir Joshua Reynolds owned by the Earl of St Germans was accepted in lieu of es- tate duty and allocated to Plymouth City Art Gallery. The arrival of these paintings from Port Eliot, just across the Tamar river from the Devon port, gave rise to the idea of an exhibition concentrating on the artist's connections with the south-west. The show was accompanied by a catalogue edited by Sam Smiles, Sir Joshua Reynolds : The Acquisition of Genius (Bristol, Sansom &amp; Company, with the University of Ply- mouth and Plymouth City Art Gallery, 200 pp., 123 col. and 26 b. &amp; w. ills., £24.99) essays from five contributors. In the course of his discussion of the artist's portraits for the Parker family of neighbouring Saltram, Richard Stephens writes of the keen anticipation of Thomas Robinson, Lord Grantham, then a diplomat in Madrid, of the arrival of an impression of Thomas Watson's mezzotint after Reynolds's painting of his sister, Therese Parker. As one learns from Grantham's correspondence in the British Library, quoted here, the print was a great success not only with him but also at the Spanish court, where 'the manner of Engraving or Mezzotinto is scarcely known.' As one might expect, references to Reynolds's interest in Old Master prints as compositional sources are made in the catalogue. Martin Postie notes his use in reverse of Van Dyck's Paulus Pontius as a model for his portrait of the youthful Lord Cardross, the future antiquarian Earl of Buchan. The Devon artist's painting of the young girl, The Honourable Miss Cholmondeley , holding a pet dog almost as large as herself, is represented here though Giuseppe Marchi's mezzotint of 1768. As Postie records, this has been seen as 'a humorous adaptation of Hercules lifting Antaeus', but Reynolds could also have referenced one of the chiaroscuro woodcuts after Raphael by Ugo da Carpi or by Nicolo Vicentino of Hercules and the Nemean Lion. Rubens, for example, had coupled the two Herculean subjects on a single sheet. The first great mezzotint practitioner to work with Reynolds was James McCardell, represented here by two contrasting prints of Reynolds's eld- erly scholarly uncle, Dr John Reynolds, and the weather- beaten Cornish Admiral Boscawen, as well as by the painter's very fine informal portrait of his collaborator. Postie also re- minds us of the artist's very active participation in the distri- bution of the mezzotints after his work. A separate section of the exhibition was devoted to Reynolds as a collector, the topic of Donato Esposito's cata- logue essay. It remains, however, a subject to which more re- search needs to be devoted, particularly in the area of his print collecting. For Reynolds and Old Master drawings one can turn to the catalogue of the British Museum's 1978 exhi- bition Reynolds and Gainsborough in the Brìtish Museum. Visitors to Plymouth and readers of this catalogue will certainly ap- preciate the quality of some of the drawings and prints amassed by the painter, as well as the wide range of his in- terests. Apparently, there is not yet a doctoral thesis to sit alongside Francis Broun's 1987 PhD, 'Sir Joshua Reynolds' Collection of Paintings'. MARTIN HOPKINSON EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY CHILDHOOD. A recent addition to the growing Ashgate Studies in Childhood , ijoo to the Present series focusses on the period commonly seen as that in which childhood was 'invented': the eighteenth century (Anja Müller, Framing Childhood in Eighteenth-Century English Periodicals andPrìnts, i68g-iy8g , Aldershot, Ashgate, 2009, 263 pp., [ills.? Price?]). Anja Müller who edited the first collection of essays to be published in this series, has written a rich and suggestive monograph that relies on careful primary research in a vari- ety of print collections. She rightly points out that she is deal- ing with 'hitherto widely neglected printed sources' and demonstrates convincingly throughout the book that child- hood was constructed in differing ways during her chosen pe- riod. Müller's canvas is necessarily broad, and takes in discus- sion of such eighteenth-century staple topics as the Grand Tour and illegitimacy, wet-nursing and the education debate. The study is divided into four main chapters that focus re- spectively on the child's body, the child's mind, the child within the context of the family and the public child. Müller's principal resource for the pictorial corpus under examination in these chapters is the Lewis Walpole Library, a rich resource for scholars interested in the print culture of the long eigh- teenth century. Almost 40 reproductions of prints, taken largely from the Lewis Walpole Library, are necessary to the discussion and appear at pertinent moments within the text. Müller shows a keen eye for the telling detail: her readings of the political purposes to which a child's body was put in satir- ical prints are particularly astute. She also demonstrates the ways in which the child's body was sexualized, and is sensitive to the class tensions at work within the period throughout. The main periodicals under consideration are the Tatler , the Spectator , the Guardian , the Female Tatler and Eliza Haywood's Female Spectator , all of which were important forerunners of the 'mass' media that one can more clearly identify in the nineteenth century. This is a carefully produced book, with a useful bibliography and examining a large quantity of unfa- miliar archival material. Müller's interdisciplinary approach is rewarding, indeed essential, for a study of childhood. PRINT QUARTERLY, XXVII, 2010, 4</page><page sequence="11">NOTES 411 That said, the theoretical underpinning in the opening chapter takes for granted a detailed knowledge of a wide range of disciplinary approaches. The reader follows Müller on a whistle-stop theoretical tour, starting with a reference to Aries's study U enfant et la vie familiale sous l'Ancien Régime and references to Anglo-American historians working on similar topics, and moving on to a discussion of the Foucauldian dis- positif via many, many references to recent work by book his- torians, art historians, literary critics, sociologists and psychologists: so many, indeed, that on seven of the eighteen pages of introduction, the footnotes occupy more space on the page than the main body of the argument. This will not intimidate Müller's peers, but it may prove off-putting for the growing body of undergraduate students who are studying children's literature and/or historical approaches to child- hood, and for whom the title of the book will prove attractive. I confess, too, to being slightly frustrated by Müller's date restrictions, despite her reasonable introductory justification that the 'general focus of publications on eighteenth-century childhood remains [. . .] directed towards the second half of the century'. One monograph can only do so much, of course, but extending the limits of the study beyond the wa- tershed date of 1789 would have enabled many more impor- tant periodicals and prints to be examined, and for these to have been read in the context of a growing body of literature for children and works on education published in the 1790s and early nineteenth century. No doubt the choice of dates was in part pragmatic: the Glorious Revolution and the French Revolution do indeed serve as natural 'boundaries' for the study. Those of us who focus on the long eighteenth century or indeed the Romantic period might feel that the continuations, as well as the watersheds, of the 1790s in par- ticular, could have been usefully explored. These, however, are minor caveats. Müller has written a useful book for scholars in the field, and is to be commended for her thorough analysis of lesser-known material. What emerges is a fresh approach to the construction of childhood in the eighteenth century, and one that does not sacrifice care- ful close readings of primary sources to the convenience of a strong thesis. The myriad discourses of childhood are allowed to speak for themselves: by listening to them, the tensions in the period become more apparent than they have hitherto appeared. GILLIAN DOW PICTURING VICTORIAN AMERICA. Everyone has heard of Currier &amp; Ives in New York. Far fewer of us have heard of the Kellogg brothers, Jarvis Griggs Kellogg, Daniel Wright Kellogg, Edmund Burke Kellogg and Elijah Chap- man Kellogg in Hartford, Connecticut, who for several decades from c. 1830, were very busy publishing and selling huge numbers of fancy prints, not dissimilar to those of Cur- rier &amp; Ives. The Connecticut Historical Society in Hartford has 1,028 of them. Or that was the score when Picturìng Vic- tońan Amerìca : Prìnts by the Kellogg Brothers of Hartford, Connecticut , 1830-1880 (edited by Nancy Finlay, Middletown, Western University Press, 2009, 252 pp., iii col. and 1,028 b. &amp; w. ills., $65 hp, $30 pb) was written. No doubt they have a few more now. Picturìng Victorian America is the catalogue of the Society's Kellogg holdings. The rather compact entries are arranged alphabetically by title. Every print is reproduced as a thumb nail which efficiently facilitates identification. But the volume contains much more: a history of the Kellogg firm and its as- sociates by Nancy Finlay; brief biographies of the Kelloggs and their associates by Candice C. Brashears; and a guide to dating Kellogg prints based on publishers' imprints. Scores of essays and conference papers could be written about as- pects of the Kellogg output, but six essays on subjects that are particularly pertinent have been included: 'Family Values and Victorian Virtues in Kellogg Prints of Home and Fam- ily', by Kate Steinway; 'Dressing Romantically: Clothing in Kellogg Prints', by Lynne Zacęk; 'Gothic Style: A Personal and National Taste', by Sally Pierce; 'Written on Stone: Fam- ily Registers, Family Trees, and Memorial Prints', by Georgina B. Barnhill; 'The Kellogg Brothers' Images of the Mexican War and the Birth of Modern-day News'; and 'Sail and Steam on Stone: Maritime Prints of the Kelloggs', by Richard C. Malley. Currier &amp; Ives and the Kelloggs knew the middle class market they shared. The prints issued by both firms were de- signed to be hung on the walls of respectable homes. They were instructive and improving. They were, well yes, Victo- rian. They presented the perfect family. Single shows a thoughtful young man holding a lithograph captioned Married (fig. 226). It causes him to take the plunge. In its sequel, Mar- ried, husband and wife exchange affectionate glances (fig. 227). Their three children are models of good behaviour. A paint- ing of a lonely man in a landscape on the wall serves to re- mind the husband of the fate that would have awaited him had he not taken that sensible decision. Many of the prints are sentimental. There is My Little White Kitties , My Family [of puppies] and plenty of others involving children and pets. Kellogg's The Toung Mother is identified in this volume as Thomas Lawrence's Lady Georgiana Ellis and her Son , highly sentimentalized, of course. The Kelloggs, like Currier &amp; Ives, were ecumenists before their time. For Protestants, they offered several Christ Blessing Little Children and Sons of Temperance' for Catholics, The Sacred Heart of Jesus , St Patrick the Apostle of Ireland and portraits of Pope Pius IX. There were series. The Way of the Cross , for ex- ample (only five of the 'stations' so incomplete?), and The Prodigal Son. In one scene we see the Prodigal revelling with harlots. Top shelf? To the modern eye it all looks harmless fun. There are Napoleons a-plenty, to satisfy the Napoleon cult perhaps, starting with a jolly rendering of David's Crossing the Alps , ending with Napoleon's death on St Helena and includ- ing several of his battles. American battle scenes have to be well represented too, of course, especially for the American Civil War: Baton Rouge, Bull's Run, Chattanooga, Lexington and Williamsburg . . . and the Monitor and the Merrimac slog it out. Too weird for words is Forward March: Uncle Sam's Old Hens on the way to Richmond , showing two iron-clads dressed as mon- strous chickens steaming up the James River backwards. The standard rule in all Kellogg war images - no blood! Topog- raphy is localized. Almost all of the towns represented are in Connecticut or not far away. The exceptions are London and Edinburgh. The London view, dated here as 1863-64, 1 can tell you is a reduced copy of Thomas Allom and J. T. Will- more's out-sized steel engraving, London (from the Upper Gallery of the Steeple of St Bride's Church ), published back in 1846 is now out of date.

In his book, The Mass Image: A Social History of Photomechanical Repro- duction in Victorian London (Basingstoke, Palgrave MacMillan, 2008, 314 pp., 30 b. &amp; w. ills., £58), Gerry Beegan's aim is to show how the mass-produced image enabled late Victorian readers to conceptualize their society. His ambitious thesis is that the photomechanical processes of line and half-tone gave shape and meaning to the vast, fragmented metropolis. By embodying the rapid and ephemeral nature of modernity, the illustrated magazines of the 1890s provided their audience - frequently first-generation city dwellers - with the means of navigating the complexities of urban life. Through partic- ipation in a common experience, readers bonded into an 'imagined collectivity', creating a sense of shared community. Nevertheless, the supporting technology of reproduction did not permit an unmediated reflection of reality. In his con- sideration of half-tones Beegan challenges the views of William S. Ivins, who stated that as they were taken from pho- tographs and had no 'interfering symbolic linear syntax', they represented an accurate record of the world. Instead, he demonstrates that although such images conveyed the impres- sion of veracity and credibility, they were never neutral, the process of selection and interpretation being concealed be- neath the cover of mechanization. Until World War I, half- tones were hybrid products, touched up by hand by women workers to increase contrast and clarity, cropped to focus at- tention and always read in conjunction with text. But used in magazines like the Sketch , they celebrated the ephemeral spec- tacles of the city - shopping, sports, theatre and fashion. As Beegan points out, the system that made stars of Henry Irv- ing and Marie Lloyd was in part dependent on their in- creased visibility in the illustrated periodicals. Line process, first introduced in the late 1880s and predat- ing the introduction of half-tone, was reserved for sketches of humorous scenes and types, notably in Punch. Reproduc- tions of pen-and-ink drawings by Maurice Greiffenhagen, Leonard Raven-Hill and Bernard Partridge were hugely pop- ular as impressions of the urban experience. In contrast to the over-detailed, static quality of photography their sketches captured the social scene at speed, with fluidity and individ- uality. Yet such works were conditioned by style as much as spontaneity, inspired not least by Japanese prints. Beegan fo- cusses on Phil May, who extracted humour from familiar, dis- locating experiences on the London street, usually involving a ragged band of cheeky urchins. The artist was in Paris in the late 1880s, saw the graphic work of Théophile Steinlen and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec and was an admirer of Aubrey Beardsley and William Nicholson. Just as the neutral- ity of half-tone was deceptive, so too the seeming instantane- ity of May's depictions of Cockney types was based on painstaking preparation. Beegan tracks the history of nineteenth-century wood-en- graving from the 'white line' art practised by Thomas Bewick and his followers through the stages of its mechanization. By the late Victorian period it was a demoralized trade, used only for retouching process blocks. The leading firm of Dalziel went bankrupt, its business taken over by process firms, which multiplied from 53 in 1895 to 250 ten years later. They supplied the new picture agencies, starting with the Il- lustrated Journals Photographic Supply Company, founded in 1894. The layout of magazines became more complex, fea- turing a mosaic of different types of image. Both photo- graphs and illustrations were used to cover the Boer War - 'special artists' depicted battles and press photographers cap- tured more static scenes of camp life. This distinction was as much based on convention as on technical capacity. Despite the snapshot aesthetic initiated by the Kodak camera and Eastman roll film, introduced respectively in 1888 and 1889, special artists were still reserved for great occasions and only they had sufficient status to gain close access to royalty. Beegan concludes by assessing the critical reaction to im- ages reproduced by photomechanical means. Some argued that the process was vulgar, resulting in banal images devoid of true significance and even paving the way towards moral laxity and sensationalism. Yet he points out that the visuali- zation of the commonplace and everyday life was a step on the path towards a less hierarchical society. From the vantage point of today's multi-media world, it is difficult to grasp the centrality of the place then held by illustrated magazines in the nation's affections. They were the forerunners of Picture Post , Life and Paris Match. Beegan's important insights serve as a useful reminder of the malleability of images, which has only intensified in the digital age. It is a pity, however, that the author has not been better served by his publisher. There is a great deal of repetition in the dense text, which could have been pruned through careful editing to reveal the argu- ment with greater clarity. And for a book about illustration, it is woefully under-illustrated. CELINA FOX AMERICAN LITHOGRAPHY Jay T. Last's, The Color Explosion : Nineteenth- Century American Lithography (Santa Ana, CA, Hillcrest Press, 2005, 316 pp., 400 col. ills., $35) was pub- lished in 2005 but served as the 'related book' for an exhibi- tion with the same title held at the Huntington Library, October 2009-February 2010. The show set out to explore the impact of colour lithography on American daily life. This is the very great virtue of Jay Last's personal collection. Ob- viously it includes prints to decorate walls - bird's-eye views of cities, ornithological prints, portraits, Civil War battles, and views of the Capitol and of the Niagara Falls for example - in the main, cheap and popular prints for the masses. But the emphasis in Jay's collection is very much on advertising trade cards, circus posters, cigar box labels, certificates of merit, calendars, can labels, tobacco box labels and sheet- music covers, print categories often overlooked which should not be. Jay T. Last was one of the founders of Fairchild Semicon- ductor Corporation, where he directed the group that pro- duced the first diffused silicon integrated circuit chip. As such he is considered to be one of the 'fathers' of Silicon Valley. Collecting chromolithographs was a spare time passion. Today there are 135,000 of them in Last's collection. With PRINT QUARTERLY, XXVII, 2010, 4</page><page sequence="15">NOTES 415 Gordon McClelland, Last has written books on Californian watercolour artists and fruit-crate labels. The present volume tackles the whole topic of chromolithography in the United States from all angles. Starting with the development of li- thography in Europe, it continues with the development of lithography and chromolithography in the United States. Skilled lithographers arrived from Germany in force after the abortive 1848 Revolution and charged up the US industry. Then comes a directory of the most important chromolitho- graphie firms (long entries), followed by a directory of less important firms (short entries). Finally there are chapters on the principal categories of chromolithography; a history of the main centres of chromolithographie printing, described city by city; and an account of the technology and actual business of lithography. For most of us it is the two directories of printers, taking up two thirds of the space, that will be this volume's most use- ful feature. Untangling successive firms, their names ever changing, would have been an awesome undertaking. The Color Explosion is prolifically illustrated, with a bias on ephemera. The ephemera reproduced is all in immaculate condition - bright, no grime, no creases, no stains, no foxing. A shame, but that's just me. The Jay T. Last collection is now being presented to the Huntington Library. Funds to support a curator of lithographic history and ephemera accompany the gift. RALPH HYDE COLNAGHI. Given the vicissitudes of the world econ- omy over the centuries, it is a triumph for any business to be able to celebrate its 250th anniversary, let alone one subject to the peaks and troughs of the art market. Admittedly, Coi- nage's claim to be the oldest commercial art gallery in the world requires some qualification. The firm traces its origins to the Cabinet de Physique Expérimentale, founded in Paris in 1760 by Giovanni Battista Torre. He sold barometers of his own manufacture and imported scientific instruments from England, as well as designing spectacular firework dis- plays - the sale of books and prints was something of a side- line. But in the late 1760s his son Anthony Torre moved to London and established a print shop in fashionable Pall Mall where, in 1785, he was joined from Paris by Paul Peter Col- naghi. Most of the essays in the anniversary publication Colnaghi : The History (edited by Jeremy Howard, London, Colnaghi, 2010, 67 pp., 60 col. and 6 b. &amp; w. ills., £30) examine the gallery's sale of Old Master paintings and drawings in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries to a number of prestigious clients, ranging from the Kaiser Friedrich Mu- seum (now Gemäldegalerie) in Berlin, under the directorship of Wilhelm von Bode, to Isabella Stewart Gardner and Henry Clay Frick. In the first chapter, however, Timothy Clayton describes the firm's print-selling activities until around 1880. When Anthony Torre retired to Italy in 1788, Colnaghi formed a number of partnerships including one with the engraver Luigi Schiavonetti, producing between 1793 and 1797 the famous stipple engravings after Francis Wheat- ley's Cries of London. During the Napoleonic Wars, to supple- ment the dwindling market for such sentimental subjects, he published prints of celebrities after portraits by Lawrence, Hoppner and others and was appointed print-seller to the Prince Regent, later George IV He also had a share in the publication of John Sell Cotman's etchings in 181 1 and in 1820 published a series of colour aquatint views by Robert Havell of the public buildings and bridges in London. His son Dominic Colnaghi - a partner since around 18 10 - made friends with leading artists, including Constable and Boning- ton, commissioning a series of lithographs from the latter, and took over after his father's death in 1833. According to Clayton, Dominic's nephew John Scott was responsible for some of the firm's more innovative ventures in the middle of the nineteenth century. During the Crimean War he sent William Simpson as special artist to the front and the resulting drawings, published as a series of 81 lithographs under the title The Seat of War in the East (1854-56), are said to have net- ted the firm £12,000. At the same time Agnew's commis- sioned Rober Fenton to make a photographic record of the war, which Colnaghi helped to sell. In 1858, the two rivals copublished the photographs commissioned by Scott from Leonida Caldesi and Mattia Montecchi of highlights from the 1857 Manchester Art Treasures Exhibition. As Clayton points out, Colnaghi did not suddenly aban- don the business of commissioning and selling reproductive prints. The gallery responded to the revival of interest in en- gravings after Reynolds and Gainsborough by commissioning new works, but increasingly profits came from dealing in Old Master and modern artists' prints, rising to a frenzy of spec- ulation in the 1920s. Despite the ensuing crash and the firm's much depleted stock, the print department continued to op- erate until 1989. Unfortunately, this work has very little to say on the potentially fascinating story of Colnaghi's involvement in the print market during the twentieth century (in 1981 Katherine Mayer Haunton, then director of the print depart- ment, told me that many records were lost in the war when the firm had to make a hasty move from New Bond Street). Yet prior to the depression, Colnaghi was thought by many to be the greatest firm of print dealers in the world. It cer- tainly had the best connections. Otto Gutekunst, who joined Colnaghi in 1894 to become one of the leading Old Master dealers of his age, started out in the print world. In 1856, his father had established the London branch of Goupil &amp; Co., before returning to Stuttgart in 1864 to set up an auction house specializing in prints and drawings. In the late 1880s, as partner with Edmond Desprez in a print gallery based in Green Street, St Martin's Place, Gutekunst sold some notable prints to George Salting that are now in the British Museum. When in 191 1 Colnaghi merged with Goupil's successor in London, Obach, it acquired as partner the Obach manager Gustavus 'Gus' Mayer, the foremost print dealer in the busi- ness, and Harold Wright as his highly regarded assistant. Twenty years later, it all went horribly wrong, in part through hubris. Mayer's role as international art fixer, which reached a climax in his handling of the Hermitage sales - a story well told by David Ekserdjian - hit the buffers when Colnaghi lost heavily in the 1931 crash and Mayer was de- clared bankrupt. At print sales in the 1920s, Colnaghi had acted with other dealers like Dunthorne in bidding up prints, so that people would buy at inflated prices. When they fell, the firm was left holding over-valued stock and in the struggle to survive it became a limited liability company with Mayer no longer acting as a director. Nevertheless, he continued to play a key rôle. The first job given to James Byam Shaw on his joining Colnaghi in 1935 was to help Mayer (a relative by PRINT QUARTERLY, XXVII, 20I0, Ą.</page><page sequence="16">416 NOTES marriage) value the Albertina's entire collection of prints and drawings with a view to its sale to the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, a transaction only averted by a single vote on Vi- enna City Council. During the post-war years of austerity, as Jeremy Howard recounts in his chapter on the firm from 1940 to 2001, Mayer masterminded the purchase by instalments of the Prince of Liechtenstein's outstanding collection of prints, selling works on to some of the world's great museum print collections, including those of the British Museum, Rijksmuseum and Metropolitan Museum, New York. Following Harold Wright's death in 1961, his place as di- rector and head of the print department was taken by Arthur Driver, assisted by Mayer's daughter Katharina. With their encouragement, Frederick Mulder opened a gallery in the basement in 1972 specializing in twentieth-century prints, a rôle complemented in 1976 when the Old Master print spe- cialist Adrian Eeles was appointed director of the print de- partment. One day, the operation of these generations of scholarly experts within the twentieth-century print market will surely repay closer investigation. CELINA FOX DUTCH ART NOUVEAU BOOK DESIGN. Thirty- seven years ago Ernst Braches published his groundbreaking Het Boek als Ñieuwe Kunst. Een studie in Art Nouveau. A second edition, Nieuwe Kunst en het boek. Een studie in Art Nouveau (Ams- terdam, De Buitenkant), which incorporated supplementary material, was issued in two volumes in 2003. Dutch Art Nou- veau, apart from the work of Jan Toorop, is much less familiar to non-Dutch students than its contemporary movements in France, Belgium and Austria. The appearance of David Rodger's lavishly illustrated translation of this major work, Dutch Art Nouveau and Book Design i8g2-igoj (Amsterdam, De Buitenkant, 2009, 310 pp., 261 col. and 992 b. &amp; w. ills., €95) is therefore extremely welcome. Much of the discussion is of course devoted to book bindings, but there are also many woodcuts and lithographs included in this compendious sur- vey. Many of the 30 designers covered are still little known outside Holland and Belgium. Despite the passage of time Braches's work is still extremely valuable and will provide a rich resource for scholars not familiar with the Dutch lan- guage. Braches introduced his subject with a long discussion of the ideological and theoretical backgrounds behind Gemeen- schapskunst and the birth of Dutch Art Nouveau. In turn, he then covers the introduction of nature-based decoration, the rise of material rationalism, architectural rationalism, the im- portance of the mathematical principle, Jan KalfFs theory of the book and Roland Hoist's reaction to it, and De Bazel's interpretation of De Nieuwe Kunst. A coda is provided by J. W. Enschedé's 1904 lecture, 'Logic in Typography'. The knowledge in Holland of the work of Walter Crane and William Morris is not neglected, but the Dutch movement is rightly seen as very independent. Visually, the products are undoubtedly very different from those of their neighbours and contemporaries. Perhaps one might have expected greater space devoted to the importance of Theosophy in Dutch artistic ideas of the period. The work of individual designers follows, with short dis- cussions of the works illustrated running from Roland Hoist to S. H. de Roos. There are three short prefaces to this sec- tion, which are devoted to symbolic representation of con- tent, nature-based design and rationalism. The book con- cludes with a nineteen-page chronology of Dutch Art Nou- veau book decorations between 1892 and 1903 with full details of illustrators, titles, publishers and publication dates. Readers should also be aware of two other books by Braches, Alle nieuwe kunst wordt eerst niet begrepen, De diploma's van i8g2 door G. W. Dijsselhof, Th. W. Nieuwenhuis, C.A. Lion Cachet (Amsterdam, De Buitenkant, 2003) and Nieuwe kunst. Toegepaste grafiek : documentatie (Amsterdam, De Buitenkant, 2006). MAR- TIN HOPKINSON FITTON. This reviewer never expected to see the publi- cation of a hefty monograph on the architectural etcher, Hedley Fitton, appreciation for whose work only ever reached modest heights among critics of his day. However, Fitton has found his champion in the artist Errol Fuller, who has written and published Hedley Fitton : The Accent of Truth (Tunbridge Wells, Errol Fuller Publishing, 2009, 320 pp., 222 col. and 36 b. &amp; w. ills., £75). Fuller recognizes that he is in a minority and opens his study with quotations from authorities ranging from Malcolm Salaman to Kenneth Guichard, whom he feels have failed to appreciate Fitton's merits. Literature on this printmaker from the fringes of Manchester is sparse. Fitton's dealer published a promotional catalogue of his etchings, and more than 50 years after his death Anselm Kuhn provided a modest basis for a reassessment of his work in a bilingual ar- ticle in II Conoscitore di Stampe (LV and LVI, 1982). Fuller ac- knowledges the work of his predecessor and corrects a number of his errors. A very useful biography introduces his subject, about whose life relatively few facts were previously available. Fitton was born in Didsbury, then a village on the north bank of the Mersey just under five miles south of the centre of Manches- ter. Despite what Fuller writes, it was quite a prosperous com- munity, as surviving mansions on the Withington Road indicate. Fitton himself, however, came from a relatively un- promising background, being the son of a Methodist school superintendent who combined this post with work as a local preacher. He had three brothers and two sisters, and the fam- ily's means may well have been stretched. Fitton began work as an assistant master at The People's College in Warrington, where he also received training of some kind at the local school of art. Perhaps through his Methodist links he came into contact with the elderly painter James Smetham, an artist who held the torch for William Blake and Samuel Palmer. From Warrington the young teacher moved to another post at Runcorn, also on the Mersey, halfway to its mouth at Liv- erpool. There he attracted the attention of Frederick Nor- man, an industrial chemist, the manager of the United Company's Wigg Works and leader of the local Liberal Party. Norman became the young Fitton's first patron. The exact details of this patronage appear not yet to be known. Fitton's career as a teacher came to a sudden end not long after the death of his first wife in 1889, when he was given three months' notice by his employers. He returned to Dids- bury, where for the first time he recorded his profession as artist. Fitton married again in 1891. One would like to have known more about his new wife, Lillian Hamer from Brad- ford. She may well have brought with her sufficient funds for the family to move to the comfortable surroundings of the small town of Haslemere, south of Guildford. One of Fitton's PRINT QUARTERLY, XXVII, 2010, 4</page><page sequence="17">NOTES 417 early etchings was a portrait of the elderly G. F. Watts, who lived nearby in the hamlet of Compton. Fitton quickly ac- quired a group of artist friends, who included the painter, Frank Dicksee, and the President of the Haslemere Art Soci- ety, the Swedish-born etcher, Axel Haig. Thirty years later Fitton succeeded this architectural etcher in the post. It is very likely that Haig introduced Fitton to his dealer Robert Dun- thorne, who had galleries both in London and Liverpool. Dunthorne's success at marketing Fitton's etchings eventually enabled him to leave his tenanted property in 191 1 and to commission a house on the north side of the town in an Arts and Crafts style, much in keeping with buildings designed by Lutyens and other fashionable architects in the neighbour- hood of Haslemere. The prosperity that could come to a moderately successful etcher in Britain up to the end of the 1920s is indicated by Fitton's estate at his death in July 1929, which amounted to £30,221. Apparently his greatest admir- ers were American print collectors. It seems likely that Fitton began to make etchings in the late 1 880s. He delivered a paper on etching to the Warrington Literary and Philosophical Society in 1891. However, a single, rather tentative print, Old Trinity Church, Boston of 1898, is his first known work. It seems likely that this was copied from an- other source on commission. It is only from 1903 onwards that there is a regular sequence of prints. It may well be that Fitton himself destroyed his immature works. For the next 25 years changes in style are almost unnoticeable. The portrait of Watts and an etching of two windmills are the only non- architectural subjects. Despite his friendship with Haig, there is no semblance of influence of the looming Gothic fantasies of the Scandinavian, nor did Fitton cast an eye at Muirhead Bone and his followers in the depiction of buildings and townscapes. Very occasionally one could make comparisons with D. Y. Cameron. Fitton travelled to France, Italy, Belgium and the central belt of Scotland, as well as in England. Only 89 etchings are recorded by Kuhn, and a further five are il- lustrated by Fuller. Four little known lithographs were shown in his memorial exhibition in Marshall Field's department store in Chicago. Fuller also discusses Fitton's drawings in- cluding those related to his etchings. Sometimes these are in the same direction as the prints. MARTIN HOPKINSON WILLIAM STRANG'S THE PLOUGH. Strang had ex- pected a better reception for his huge print, the largest pub- lished by the Art for Schools Association (see also Print Quarterly , xxvii, 2010, pp. 263-77). Much later, in conversation with Herbert Fürst, the enthusiastic supporter of modern British woodcuts, Strang explained what he regarded as its failure as an example of English chauvinism: 'It failed partly because it represents a Scotch plough, not an English one, but probably because so many of those responsible for the aesthetic welfare of the people had, and have an irrational preference for "Old Masters".' If this was the case, it is ironic, as Strang's woodcuts are deeply indebted to early sixteenth- century German printmaking, in particular the work of Dürer. Fürst, writing in 'The Modern Woodcut. Part IF (. Prìnt Collectors' Quarterly, VIII, 192 1, p. 284), however, went on to say that The Plough 'is to be seen, framed, as an ornament of sev- eral of the leading home print-rooms'. He also claimed that Strang's print was 'probably the largest wood-print ever de- signed and cut by the same hand.' As James Hamilton noted in Wood Engraving and the Woodcut in Bńtain c. i8go-iggo (Lon- don, 1994, p. 59), the Birmingham woodcut artist, Bernard Sleigh, also reported on objections to the woodcut in his 1932 monograph, Wood Engraving since i8go (Pinner, pp. 35-36). He wrote 'red tape and ignorance stepped in, because the plough was not a modern make'. Sleigh mistakenly thought that Strang's print was 'made at the instance of the Fitzroy Picture Society' rather than on the commission of the Art for Schools Association. MARTIN HOPKINSON PAUL RANSON. In 2001 the Musée de Pont- Aven mounted an exhibition of the pastels and drawings of Paul Ranson. To commemorate the centenary in 2009 of the death of the artist the Museum has followed this up with a wider survey of his work, organized in partnership with the Musée Maurice Denis in Saint-Germain-en-Laye. Ranson's work also formed part of that Museum's 2009 exhibition, 'Maurice Denis et la Bretagne'. The first edition of the Ran- son catalogue was published jointly with the Museum in Saint-Germain-en-Laye. The second expanded edition, Paul Ranson fantasmes &amp; sortilèges (Paris, Somogy éditions d'art, and Pont- Aven, Musée de Pont- Aven, 2010, 176 pp., 161 col. and 17 b. &amp; w. ills., ( 25), under review here, includes essays by Marc-Olivier Ranson-Bitker, Gilles Genty, and jointly by the psychoanalyst Françoise Bessis and the painter Granjabiel. Although not exactly forgotten, Ranson has long been one of the two least studied Nabis and least known outside France (the other being Jean Verkade), despite the existence of the 1999 catalogue raisonné published by Brigitte Ranson-Bitker and Genty. There was also an exhibition devoted to the artist in 2004 at the Musée de Valence, the catalogue of which I have not seen, and Brigitte Ranson-Bitker has catalogued the artist's prints in Nouvelles de l'Estampe (cxxix, August 1993, pp. n"23)- The Pont-Aven exhibition included paintings, drawings, tapestries, pieces of marquetry and a few prints. Of these, Ranson made about twenty, his printmaking activity being confined to a few years in the 1890s. Among them were works described here as 'eau-fortes typographiques' and 'aquarelle typographique (gillotage)'. Brigitte Ranson-Bitker has ex- plained that 'eau-forte typographique' was originally called 'panicographie' or zincography. For a full explanation one should consult her article in Nouvelles de l'Estampe. The 'aquarelle typographique', La sorcière dans son cercle, of 1892, looks like a design for or an imitation of marquetry, although it was executed half a decade earlier than the works in mar- quetry included in this show. Among Ranson's prints were other techniques, not usually associated with original print- makers: photozincographs, a heliogravure and a phototype. As often before, Ranson is described as 'plus Japonard que le Nabi très Japonard', who was Bonnard. His interest in Japanese art is undoubted, but it is surprising that no one seems to remark on his interest in Indonesian art, which was being avidly collected in Paris at the time. This can be dis- cerned in Ranson's lithograph, La cloche engloutie, made c. 1892 to advertise Ger hart Hauptmann 's play of that title at the Theatre de l'Oeuvre. Nor has anyone speculated on his pos- sible knowledge of the work of the Dutchman Jan Toorop. Toorop was in Paris in 1884 and his work was exhibited at the Salon de Rose + Croix in 1892. He had begun to intro- duce Javanese elements into his work in 1890. The coinci- PRINT QUARTERLY, XXVII, 20I0, Ą.</page><page sequence="18">418 NOTES dence of date of the Rosicrucian exhibition and the earliest evidence of Ranson's interest in the art of the islands off south-east Asia is suggestive. More needs to be done too on Ranson's evident interest in Indian art, Mughal manuscripts, Buddhist and Hindu sculpture, a taste in which was some- times indulged by artists like him who were versed in the Kabbalah, the occult and hermetic Theosophy. One would also like to know more about his maternal grandfather, Jacques-Joseph Maquart, a highly Romantic artist who painted and produced lithographs of extraordinar- ily twisted trees, one of which is illustrated here. What was this artist's relationship with Eugène Bléry and Rodolphe Bresdin? A suggestive anthropomorphic forest setting in a Gustave Doré illustration to Dante's Purgatory is reproduced here, relevant both to the understanding of Ranson's and Maquarťs art. A comparison is made between Maurice Du- mont's 1894 lithograph, La Dame inexorable , and an undated Ranson pastel, Uombre grandit. There is also a question as to whether Ranson knew the Intimist work of Munch executed during the Norwegian's brief period in Paris. Does the Frenchman's 1897 lithograph La malade reflect this? What is not properly discussed is the question of Ranson's dependence on opium and other drugs, which might possibly account for the noticeable sharp deterioration in the quality of his work in the last decade of his life. Ranson's work was appreciated in Scotland, as can be seen from the illustrations in Patrick Geddes's journal The Evergreen. One of the Scottish artists whose work appeared within its pages, Charles Mackie, had visited Ranson in his studio on the Boulevard Montpar- nasse, as Belinda Thomson has noted. Could Ranson's work have also been appreciated by the circle of Charles Rennie Mackintosh? The colours of Jésirah Brìah ou Chimère are close to those sometimes chosen by the Scottish architect, designer and watercolourist. One last note should be made. A drawing reproduced in this catalogue, Femme dans un paysage ensorcelé of 1894 (fig. 30), looks as if it is on transfer paper of a similar kind to that contemporaneously being used by Whistler in Paris, may well be a design for an unrealized lithograph. MAR- TIN HOPKINSON CHARLES DOUDELET. Francesca Cagianelli's book, Charles Doudelet : Pittore, incisore e crìtico d'arte dal t Leonardo ' a 'L'Eroica' ( Florence, Olschki, 2009, 140 pp., 20 col. and 97 b. &amp; w. ills., €26) aims to shed some light on cultural and artistic relations between Italy and Belgium at the beginning of the twentieth century as well as to give an insight into the rôle played as an artist and art critic by Charles Doudelet in the milieu of the Cañe Bardi in Livorno - the famous meeting place of artists between 1908 and 1921. It also analyses Doudelet's relationship with other artists such as Benvenuto Benvenuti and Gabriele Gabrielli, as well as more generally the cultural scene between Livorno and Florence during the first quarter of the twentieth century. Charles Doudelet (Lille, 1861-Ghent, 1938) was in fact a multitalented artist but his fame is still fairly obscure, and this book gives only a glimpse into a particular aspect and period of his work. Doudelet was a Belgian painter, sculptor, stage designer and above all illustrator of great intelligence and versatility. He studied music at the Koninklijk Muziekconser- vatorium in Ghent and sculpture at the Gewerbeschule. He exhibited at the Ghent Salon of 1887, and&gt; despite his lack of an academic background, aroused the enthusiasm of artists and writers such as Constantin Meunier, Paul Verlaine and, above all, the playwright Maurice Maeterlinck, winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature and also from Ghent. Fol- lowing this introduction Doudelet became the most cultured and sophisticated illustrator of Maeterlink's books. With a grant from the city of Ghent he visited Paris in 1887 and Italy in 1890. He greatly appreciated the Old Masters and espe- cially the Quattrocento painters, and after meeting Constan- tin Meunier he started painting Symbolist scenes influenced by Art Nouveau. He exhibited in 1893 with Les XX in Brussels and made a series of decorative panels for Oostakker Castle. As an illustrator Doudelet also worked on various covers for books by the poet Pol Mont, including Van Jezus (Antwerp 1897) and illustrated periodicals such as Le Réveil (1895-96) and the Mercure de France. For Maeterlinck, he designed the- atrical sets for a production by Konstantin Stanislavsky in Moscow in 1908. He travelled to Italy in 1900 to prepare a study on the history of typography and ancient manuscripts for the Belgian government, remaining in Florence until 1924 when he took up the position of Professor of the History of Theatre in Ghent. With his avant-garde, primitive style Doudelet acted as an intermediary between Italian and Northern European culture. His lithographs and illustrations are filled with mystery, ancient religion, mysticism and literary references to evil passions, castles, knights, prisoners and princesses. The book is divided into four sections: the introduction by Francesca Cagianelli summarizes her earlier research in the archives of MART in Rovereto and the Museo Civico G. Fat- tori in Livorno on the milieu of the Caffè Bardi in Livorno. The second part of the book consists of a selection of writ- ings by Charles Doudelet himself: eleven pieces on various subjects from Leonardo Da Vinci and Raphael to the Futur- ists that were published at the time in periodicals such as L'Eroica , Bollettino di Bottega d'Arte and Nuovo Convito. This is fol- lowed by a transcription of a series of letters and postcards by Doudelet to Benvenuti, rediscovered by Cagianelli in the same archives. The biographies of Doudelet, Benvenuti and Gabrielli constitute the final section, even though it would have been much more useful and sensible to have had a brief introduction about the artist at the beginning of the book. Finally, there are some useful notes on relevant magazines such as L'Eroica , Hermes and Leonardo , followed by a short bib- liography and an index of names. In addition to some Italian support, this publication was financed by the Musées Royaux des Beaux- Arts in Brussels, which reflects the Belgian and Eu- ropean fame of the artist. The volume is of modest size with 84 plates, although most of the images in the colour section are only half page, making it difficult to appreciate the details in the illustrations of the lithographs. Charles Doudelet is not a household name and this book does not offer an overview or general insight into his work. The research on which it is based is solid and interesting, but it is very much targeted at a niche audience. The knowledge of the period and social background of the artist is rather taken for granted, leaving this volume very much as a tool for consultation for specific purposes rather than an informative and easy-to-read introduction to the subject. ROBERIA CRE- MONCINI PRINT QUARTERLY, XXVII, 20I0, 4</page><page sequence="19">NOTES 419 228. Rupert Bunny, Siren, colour monotype, 346 x 249 mm (Sydney, Art Gallery of New South Wales, photo Jenni Garter). RUPERT BUNNY, ARTIST IN PARIS. There is a per- verse pleasure in encountering the work of Rupert Bunny, sumptuously illustrated in a recent exhibition catalogue pro- duced by the Art Gallery of New South Wales (Deborah Ed- wards, Rupert Bunny : Artist in Paris , Sydney Art Gallery of New South Wales, 21 November 2009-21 February 2010, Sydney, Art Gallery of New South Wales, 2009, 224 pp., 351 col. and 4 b. &amp; w. ills., AU$50). A Melbourne-born artist who spent nearly ¿ill of his working life in France, Bunny was an eclectic who, as Mary Eagle delicately put it, 'rather consciously steered his career according to a sensitive reading of what were successful trends in Parisian art'. His work invites the vi- sual sleuthing that we sometimes think of as forbidden in today's art history. Manet quotations pop up in a composition indebted to Hans Makart. Figure arrangements redolent of Gustave Moreau are painted with a palette somewhere be- tween Hodler and Gauguin. Other, almost eerie evocations of Courbet, Monet, Bonvin, Munch, even Kirchner, not to mention the Fauves, testify to Bunny's fundamental rooted- ness in European and above all French art circles. The catalogue's main author, Deborah Edwards, self-con- sciously eschews this sleuthing in favour of a narrative fore- grounding Bunny's unique use of colour, his saturated reds and striking juxtapositions, as the linking element of his dis- parate oeuvre. Studiously avoiding the issue of sources, the text as a whole constructs an artist strangely detached from his European context. Edwards touches on issues of national and gender identities, as well as the artist's negotiation of the Paris, London and Australian art markets. But the disquieting eclecticism of Bunny's work - its cunning yet disturbing PRINT QUARTERLY, XXVII, 2010, 4</page><page sequence="20">420 NOTES 229. Rupert Bunny, Fresque , colour monotype, 247 x 240 mm (Sydney, Art Gallery of New South Wales, photo Ray Woodbury). knowingness, the way it addresses itself to art-world insiders - deserves a great deal more attention in relation to turn-of- the-century art world identities, homosocial communities and cosmopolitanism, all of which are mentioned, but seem to me to be especially crucial aspects of Bunny's ambiguous re- lationship with modern art. Denise Mimmocchi provides an engaging and illuminat- ing essay on Bunny's monotype practice, which is confined to two moments of the artist's career, 1898 and 1920-21. Monotypes, on the model of those produced by Degas and Gauguin, are often thought of as the nec plus ultra of print- making as a private, experimental practice. But Bunny, who explored no other printmaking techniques, began making monotypes as a form of social activity among American ex- patriates in Paris. Possibly inspired by Maurice Prendergast, these artists cultivated the monotype, in Mimmocchi's words, as an 'artistic 'sport', where an evening's entertainment con- sisted of monotype production'. While Degas exhibited only a few monotypes in his lifetime, Bunny immediately sought out publicity for his 'specimens of oil drawings', showing them in a solo exhibition at London's Fine Art Society in No- vember 1898. By the late 1890s Bunny had achieved his first Parisian suc- cesses with allegorical paintings of nymphs and mermaids, peasant idylls and biblical scenes. As Mimmocchi argues, his initial forays into monotype formed a counterpoint to these paintings. With more emphasis on mythological subjects and the grotesque, Bunny created highly controlled, structured compositions akin to his paintings, but with a technique that evoked a rapid, quasi-automatic process. The 1898 mono- types used a subtractive technique where thinned paint was applied to the plate surface and then removed with a brush. When printed, this had the effect of exaggerating the 'brushi- ness' of the brushstrokes. Siren, for example, confines a single female figure precisely within the bounds of the image (fig. 228). But the brushstrokes, which are tactile and sensuous, signal an immediacy and an amplified painterliness absent from Bunny's worked-up Salon machines. Mimmocchi aptly concludes that Bunny's early monotypes functioned as 'con- flations' of various traditional studio practices including the oil sketch, promising viewers access to the insider's world of the studio prior to the emergence of the finished painting. In 1920, the Galerie Georges Petit commissioned the artist to produce 100 monotypes for an exhibition to be held in 1 92 1. The intervening years had seen a radical change in Bunny's painting. Although aware of Matisse's work from 1904, his rôle as a juror for the 1910 Salon d'Automne, where Matisse exhibited Dance and Music , sparked an explosion of colour in Bunny's work and an intense interest in Matissean themes, evident in paintings from about 19 13. Instead of a re- stricted palette of earth tones, the 1920-21 monotypes de- ployed a full range of saturated colour. Now, Bunny applied PRINT QUARTERLY, XXVII, 2010, 4</page><page sequence="21">NOTES 42 1 colour to the plate using shorter strokes confined to discrete areas. Possibly because he moistened the paper less, the paint did not penetrate into all the crevices, leaving paint on the plate (thus allowing for cognates which are known to exist) and creating a stippled effect across the entire surface of the print. Evoking frescoes, this technique was eminently suited to the many archaizing figures torqued parallel to the picture plane that populate Bunny's later monotypes. Prints such as Fresque (fig. 229) typify this approach, while Femme couchée shows Bunny particularly close to Matisse's exotic decorative nudes. Bunny's paintings and monotypes, so lovingly presented in this exhibition catalogue, deserve much further study. With its introductory essays, extensive bibliographies and lavish re- productions, the publication will surely form the basis for fu- ture scholarship. The urbane, cosmopolitan Bunny, artist in Paris, embraced 'strategic eclecticism' as a positive value. With much of the raw material for further study now estab- lished, and Bunny's work receiving increased attention both inside and outside his native land, art historians should seek to address that eclecticism head on, to fully explore its import within Bunny's problematic, but fundamentally fascinating modernity. ALLISON MORKHEAD ANDRÉ DESLIGNÈRES. In 2009 the Palais Ducal in Nevers hosted an exhibition of the work of one of the town's best-known artists, André Deslignères. Accompanying the show was the book André Deslignères (1880 à ig68) Peintre et graveur (Nevers, Bibliothèque Municipale, 2009, 152 pp., 41 col. and 7 b. &amp; w. ills., ťi2), edited by Jean-Louis Montarnal and Jean-François Lefébure. Jean-Michel Roudier provided essays on the artist's paintings and illustrations. At the front of the publication a very helpful chronology records the works of the artist that were exhibited up to and after his death. There is also a very full record of Deslignères's work as an illustrator. Quite extensive quotations are provided from the writings of journalists, art critics, historians and other writers. There is also a bibliography that includes manuscript sources, as well as records of works by him in public collec- tions, not just those in the environs of Nevers but also in Paris, Pontoise, Le Havre and Clamecy. Deslignères trained at the Ecole Germain Pilon in Paris from 1889 to 1892, taking up etching in 1898 after a period earning a living as a designer for the decorative trimmings of a tulle and lace manufacturer. The following year one of his wood-engravings was published in L'Estampe Moderne . Deslignères's early etchings were of rural workers, very much in the tradition of contemporary socially committed Belgian printmaking. It is interesting to see that he sometimes re- turned to the compositions of his prints some years later to produce painted versions. Deslignères began exhibiting in his home town at the Société Artistique de la Nièvre in 1904, and retained life-long links with the Nivernais, although he had a studio in Paris. From 1906 he was a regular exhibitor with the Salon des Artistes Independents and became a member of its committee in 1910. For three years from 1912 to 1914 the Nevers artist was employed as a designer in a Parisian jew- ellery business, but he very soon became best known as a wood-engraver. Deslignères was included in the Société de Gravure de Bois Originale's Florence exhibition in May 19 14. It was probably at this period that he became a friend of the Italian printmaker Anselmo Bucci, who, in 1913, gave him an impression of one of his Breton drypoints (A. Bonafous- Murat, Estampes XIXe, XXe et XXIe siècles , Paris 2010, p. 17, no. 87). During World War I he provided prints and humorous drawings for La Marmita , ajournai published by his infantry regiment. Deslignères had become a friend of Daragnès before the war and allowed his fellow artist to use his press. The Mont- martre painter and chronicler, André Warnod, wrote of the presence of his works on the walls of the 'Lapin Agile' and at the 'Adèle', cafés much frequented by artists, philosophers and politicians of note. Deslignères's familiarity with the world of illustration began with his work for the Journal d'Ate- lier between 19 10 and 19 12, for Les Tendances nouvelles - famous for the woodcuts of Kandinsky - in 191 2, for Ombres &amp; Formes in 19 1 3 and for Le Bonnet rouge from 191 3 to 19 14. After the war his career as a book illustrator took off. Deslignères was the first artist to illustrate the work of Eluard, when he provided the frontispiece for the poet's Le Devoir et l'Inquiétude , published by A.J. Gonon. Gonon followed this up in 1918 by issuing a suite of sixteen of the wood-engravings that Deslignères had executed at the Front and which had previously appeared in La Marmita. His cover for Le Bonnet rouge of 31 January 19 14, his association with the Société des Anonymes of which he was the co-founder in 1927, with the Salon d'Art Français alongside Gromaire, and his participation in 1934 in the Salon des Artistes du Travail at the left wing Galerie Billiet- Pierre Vorms, all suggest that he was politically committed. The outer panels of his mural for the vestibule for the Maison du Service de l'Hygiène in his native town, also of 1934, are in keeping with the ethos of the Popular Front of radical par- ties launched that year. However, political commitment is not so evident from the post- 19 1 8 prints illustrated here, apart from Les Vanneurs Corses, a wood-engraving of 1923 . Deslignères's later prints are more decorative, particularly his nudes. He had moved far from the Vallotton-influenced style of Nu (essai), a colour woodcut re- produced here. His illustrations to Les Odes Anacréontiques of 1924 could even be compared to contemporary Romagnole colour woodblock prints. One sometimes wonders how visible foreign woodcuts and wood-engravings were to printmakers in France through journals at this period. The similarity, how- ever, between the Frenchman's illustration to La Luciade ou l'âne and a wood-engraving by the Englishman T. Sturge Moore, is probably better explained by a shared composi- tional source. Deslignères illustrated three books in 19 19 and thirteen the following year, and was much employed by a variety of pub- lishers up to the financial crash of 1929. As Roudier explains, he, Daragnès, Laborde and Decaris were among the artists who benefited most from the explosion of publications of il- lustrated books in the 1920s. These were not generally de-luxe volumes, which fall into the category of livres d'artiste, but livres d'art , more akin to British illustrated books. From Roudier one learns that there were 470 livres illustrés published in 1923 and 1,128 in 1928. The number of publishers of this type of book proliferated so much that a Chambre Syndicale des Éditeurs de Livres d'Art was set up. Roudier highlights the activity of Georges Crès under the direction of Adolphe Van Bever, who issued the series Maîtres de livre, and the Librarie Mornay's rival Beaux-livres series. The importance of the printer pub- lisher Léon Pichón is also stressed. With his The New Illustration PRINT QUARTERLY, XXVII, 20I0, Ą.</page><page sequence="22">422 NOTES in France, published in London in 1924 as a special issue of The Studio, Pichón brought the work of some of the best il- lustrators, including Deslignères, to British attention. The artist benefited from moving in 1925 to Epiais-Rhus, a village near Pontoise, where one of his neighbours was the publisher Marcel Seheur. One of Deslignères's finest sets of illustrations accompanied Rémi des Rauches , the novel by his friend Maurice Genevois, published by Seheur in 1926. By 1932 there were 34 societies of bibliophiles active as publishers in France, many of them provincial. Specialist journals, including Byblis, Arts et Métiers graphiques and Plaisir des bibliophiles encouraged the publication and purchase of livres d'art as well as of the much more expensive livres d'artiste. In 1930 Deslignères launched his own Editions de l'Ours, publishing his illustrations to Apuleius's Golden Ass , La Luciade ou l'âne, traduit de Lucius de Patras. This was published in an edi- tion of 32. So it clearly belongs to the category of livre d'artiste, not livre d'art. Most of his earlier illustrated books had been issued in editions of 300 to 2,000 copies. By 1934, however, the bottom had totally fallen out of the market, Americans were no longer as active as collectors of fine books in Europe, and there was no serious revival of de-luxe publishing until France was liberated in 1944. A new set of journals, including Le Portique and Le Livre et ses amis, supported this renewal of interest in fine books and in the post-war years Deslignères worked on illustrations for a number of publications. His last significant contribution were his wood-engravings for his long-time friend, Fernand Chaffiol-Debillemonťs Abécédaire , published in 1952 by his own Edition de l'Ours, when he was 72. This was his third own publication - in 1938 he had issued Le Monologue du Bon Vigneron, précédé du Discours Joyeux en Façon de Sermon par Maistre Jean Pinard, the work of a late sixteenth- century poet from Auxerre, Louis de Charmoy. MARTIN HOP- KINSON JOSEF VÁCHAL. The Czech printmaker Josef Váchal (1884-1969) must have been one of the most prolific designers of ex-libris of the last century. At his own estimate he made 650 bookplates over a period of 50 years. In 2009, drawing very largely from its own rich collection, the regional museum at Teplicích exhibited 500 of them, 492 of which had been purchased from the collector Karel Pavelka. Other important examples were borrowed from various museums and collec- tions in Prague, Chrudim and Lysá nad Ladem. Accompa- nying the show was the catalogue Ex libris Příběhy knéchoznaček Josefa Váchala (Teplicích, Regionální museum v Teplicích, 52 pp., 27 col. and 67 b. &amp; w. ills, CZKioo), inserted into which is a chronological list of the bookplates, as well as a fold-out colour reproduction of what is claimed to be the world's largest ex-libris, the colour woodcut that Váchal made in 1923 for his friend František Procházka. This comic-strip-like work depicts incidents from the life of Procházka and measures 165 X 1,663 mm- Váchal recommended that it should be displayed in the recipient's window. The impression illustrated here is annotated with numerous inscriptions above and below the image. The imagery is presumably partly inspired by Bo- hemian nineteenth-century popular prints. Váchal may also have had in mind Dürer's Triumphal Procession of the Emperor Maximilian. Was he also aware of Chinese and Japanese fold- ing scrolls of triumphal processions? František Serafinský Procházka (1861-1939) was a poet, journalist and writer. He was the librettist for Janáček's opera The Excursions of Mr Brouček and his musical interests are referred to on a number of occasions in this huge print. B. Chleborádová provides an introduction outlining Váchal's career as an ex-librìste. Also provided is a useful chronology and a summary of the content of the exhibition. The latter is published in English and German as well as in Czech. Short essays are included on the collector Karel Pavelka and the illustrator Anna (Hanka) Macková (1887- 1969), Váchal's wife and fellow bookplate designer. Fourteen of her plates appeared in the exhibition, together with twelve designed by Josef Hodek (1888-1973), another artist in Váchal's circle, 46 of whose ex-libris were owned by Pavelka. Brief extracts from contemporary Czeck writings on Váchal are also published here. The sources of Váchal's imagery were wide and various. He had an unsetded personality. His Anarchic sympathies did not preclude his interest in devotional Christian material, in- cluding mediaeval wall paintings and Bohemian Baroque art. Váchal was also very interested in the occult and in Theoso- phy, as well as in the folk art of Central Europe. Prague was a centre of advanced culture in the years before World War I, and thanks to a series of exhibitions staged by the Mánes Union of Fine Arts, young artists were kept well abreast of avant-garde developments elsewhere in Europe. Váchal paid attention to Austrian, German and Hungarian artists, but also to Netherlandish printmakers. He was clearly an admirer of Toorop, at times adopting lettering that compares with that of the Dutchman. Work with Spiritist and Theosophical undertones appealed to him. He was highly individual, but eclectic, and the iconography of his bookplates deserves thor- ough investigation. Váchal was a writer as well as a painter, printmaker, photographer and innovative graphic designer, and he also devised a method of intaglio printmaking which parallels that of William Blake. Appreciation of his art out- side Central Europe, however, is much hampered by the lack of publications devoted to it in English and French, apart from in surveys of Czech early twentieth-century art. This catalogue does not include a bibliography, but there are nu- merous works devoted to Váchal written in Czech. A weighty catalogue was published by Jindřiška Labutová and Milan Bájak in 1998. More recently, in 2008 Rumjana Dačeva and Jiří Kaše brought out Josef Vachal (i884~ig6g): mezi Bohem a Dáblen. American libraries own more of the Czech books and catalogues devoted to the artist that have appeared over the last fifteen years than their British counterparts. In French, one can consult Facéties et illumination: l'oeuvre de Josef Váchal, un graveur écrìvain de Boheme 1 884-1 g6g (Paris 1999), a collection of texts assembled by Xavier Galmiche. MARTIN HOPKINSON NIVERNAIS PRINTMAKERS. The small city of Nev- ers on the Loire in the rural département of Nièvre to the west of Burgundy sustained a remarkable number of print- makers during the first half of the twentieth century. These artists have been selected for the first volume of the Ency- clopédie illustrée du Mvernais-Morvan. Jean-François Lefebure's La Meure gravée, l'école de Fernand Chalandre (Nevers, La Fabrique, 80 pp., 52 col. and 91 b. &amp; w. ills., ('14) is in effect a mini dic- tionary of 24 artists, who worked in this small area of La France profonde and were associated with Le Groupe d'Em- ulation Artistique de la Nièvre, a society that held exhibitions PRINT QUARTERLY, XXVII, 2010, 4</page><page sequence="23">NOTES 423 in the city between 1903 and 1980. Nevers artists are fortunate in the pride their district takes in their achievements, and in 2002 Maurice Bardin published a Dictionnaire des peintres, sculp- teurs et graveurs nivernais du XVeme au XXème siècle. The popula- tion of Nevers today is barely 40,000, and none of the printmakers discussed here is much known outside the region. Perhaps the most familiar to readers of Prìnt Quarterly will be the prolific etcher, Maurice- Victor Achener, responsible for over 500 plates. Born in Mulhouse and trained in Strasbourg and Munich, he was a contemporary of Dunoyer de Segon- zac in the studio of Jean-Paul Laurens. Achener was intro- duced to the Nièvre by Paul-Adrien Bouroux in the early 1920s. Very active as an illustrator, he worked for the Société de Saint Eloy, an organization founded for bibliophiles by Bouroux. Achener exhibited in Nevers over a period of more than 30 years. Four of his etchings of the town of La Charité sur Loire are illustrated here. Herbert Lespinasse and Jules Fer main taught him to make wood-engravings, and Nevers is best known as a centre for wood-engraving. The key figure was Fernand Chalandre, Achener's close contemporary. Al- though he exhibited an album of etchings of his native city in 1907, he primarily worked with woodblocks. Some of these prints were 'en camaieu'. He was elected president of Le Groupe in 1924, but died in March that year when only 45. The Musée de Nevers owns 269 works by him, almost his complete graphic œuvre. The style of Chalandre's contemporaries is remarkably consistent and in most cases the prints of Nièvre artists are very easily identifiable. Bouroux's work is an exception, to judge from a bookplate of a factory at Fourchambault. Em- manuel Defert specialized in colour woodcuts, possibly as the result of his time in Indochina as an administrator. He con- tributed prints to the Hanoi literary and artistic journal, Pages Indochinoises, and on his return to France in 1925 issued La Chersonese d'Or, an album of 43 colour woodcuts. Defert con- tinued to work in a traditional style well after World War II. More individual in approach was André Deslignères, like De- fert and Chalandre a member of the Paris-based Société de la Gravure sur Bois Originale. His subjects included rural labour as well as townscapes of Nevers and La Charité sur Loire. His wood-engravings were probably influenced by those of Lespinasse. Deslignères also worked as a publisher, printer and typographer. One of the younger artists, Jean- Louis Verrier (19 15-2001), stands somewhat apart in that he made linocuts in the vein of the pre- World War I Fauves. Very occasionally too, Jean Monet, one of whose prints was reissued with this volume, executed wood-engravings stem- ming from the Images d'Epinal tradition. The general im- pression given by this publication, however, is that the printmakers working in the Nevers region were very tradi- tional in their approach. MARTIN HOPKINSON MATISSE. A touring exhibition with homonymous cata- logue, Matisse as Prìntmaker : Works from the Pierre and Tana Matisse Foundation, (Jay McKean Fisher, New York, American Feder- ation of Arts, 2009, 104 col. and 3 b. &amp; w. ills., $25), opened at the Baltimore Museum of Art, Maryland (25 October 2009-3 January 2010), travelled to the Tampa Museum of Art, Florida (4 February- 18 April 2010), the Blanton Museum of Art at the University of Texas at Austin (23 May-i August 2010) and finally to the Art Gallery of Alberta in Edmonton (29 October 2010-13 February 2010). The show was organ- ized by the American Federation of Arts and the Matisse Foundation and included 63 works. Son of Henri, the New York dealer Pierre Matisse was a major figure in the promo- tion of French art in North America. The catalogue, although modest in appearance, is a most important publication on this great artist's prints, in particular for its reprinting of William S. Lieberman's seminal essay from his book Matisse: 50 Tears of his Graphic Art (New York 1 956). Jay McKean Fisher, who wrote the introduction to the catalogue and an essay, is Curator of the Baltimore Museum of Art's major collection of Matisse's prints, the largest in an American museum, thanks to the donation of the Cone sis- ters' collection. Fisher outlines what information on Matisse and his works was available to Lieberman, then a Curator at the Museum of Modern Art, when he published his account some 26 years before the first comprehensive exhibition of Matisse's prints and 27 years before the appearance of the Duthuits' catalogue raisonné. Fisher explains how, unlike his contemporary Picasso, Ma- tisse had no great interest in technical experimentation, but was very happy to learn from professional printers, particu- larly in lithographic studios. He pays tribute to Susan Lam- bert's and John NefTs exploration of Matisse's transfer lithographs, noting the artists choice of non-standard transfer papers, the 'tooth' of which played a significant rôle in the appearance of the finished prints. Matisse's drypoint practice of the second decade of the last century is compared with the early printmaking activity of Degas and Pissarro for its essentially private character. As Fisher says, 'the most startling exposition of his developing engagement' with printmaking was his production of monotypes in 1914-15, a period of in- tense activity in which his subject-matter expanded to include figures and still lifes in addition to the portraits of friends and family of his preceding etchings and drypoints. It was in linocut over twenty years later that Matisse took up this linear drawing, making stunning use of the intense contrasts be- tween the white lines of the designs set against matt blacks. It is lithography, however, with which one associates Ma- tisse, who was able early in his career to use the help of the printer, Auguste Clot, who had worked with Redon - whose prints, Fisher reminds us, the artist greatly admired (fig. 230). In Matisse's pre-World War I prints, both lithographs and woodcuts, there is no concession to the art market. Some of them are spectacular in their audacity. Fisher places them in the context of Matisse's contemporary painting and sculp- ture. He also emphasizes the serial nature of the artist's print- making. This interest in series made Matisse an ideal candidate for the production of livres d'artiste. In essence, after 1918 he saw printmaking as a way to multiply his drawings. He was not enamoured of the preciosity of the print world, on occasion publishing photo-lithographic reproductions of series of drawings, that were released to the public in large editions. Fisher notes that Matisse's edition of Joyce's Ulysses included facsimiles of drawings reproduced on coloured pa- pers as well as soft-ground etchings. Quality, however, was vi- tally important to Matisse, whether in reproductions of his work or in the magnificent series of lithographs that he made between 1922 and 1930, at a time when there was clearly a considerable demand from dealers and collectors for his prints. It was very rare that colour entered his printmaking. PRINT QUARTERLY, XXVII, 20 IO, 4</page><page sequence="24">424 NOTES 230.

MARTIN HOPKINSON PICASSO AND JAPAN. The catalogue Picasso : Imágenes secretas y la estampa erotica japonesa (Barcelona, Museu Picasso, 4 November 2009-14 February 2010, Barcelona, Museu Pi- casso, 2010, 236 pp., 174 col. and 4 b. &amp; w. ills., ( 30) accom- panied an exhibition of the same name that brought together 23 Japanese erotic printed images (a mix of single-sheet prints, book illustrations and album leaves), erotic etchings and drawings by Picasso, and further works on paper by his contemporaries. The catalogue supplements the 38 items in the exhibition with many more images of works in all the above categories. The entire Spanish text is given in English translation at the back of the book. Hayakawa Monta, the leading Japanese scholar in the field of Japanese erotica of the Edo period (1600-1868), wrote a concise, finely judged introduction to the subject. Ricard Bru (Museu Picasso) pro- vided two stimulating essays: 'Ukiyo-e and japonism in the young Picasso's circle' and 'Tentacles of love and death: from Hokusai to Picasso'. In the latter, Bru explores the impact on the European imagination - but perhaps less convincingly on Picasso himself - of Hokusai's notorious image of a woman entwined in the sensuous embraces of a large and a small oc- topus. Malén Guai (also of the Museu Picasso) investigates the ways in which Picasso's art reveals his acquaintance with and response to Japanese prints in the essay 'Dialogues with Japanese Art'. While Picasso claimed to be disinterested in Japanese art, his personal collection included some 60 Japan- ese woodblock-printed images, most of which were explicitly erotic. In the exhibition and in the catalogue Guai and Bre present, for the first time, nineteen Japanese erotic images known to have been in Picasso's collection alongside the star- tlingly erotic etchings of his later years (figs. 231 and 232). This juxtaposition reveals an affinity between the two that must be more than coincidence. A final essay by Diana Wid- maier Picasso, 'The Provenance of Picasso's Collection of Erotic Japanese Prints' reveals that most of his Japanese prints came from the collection of Philippe Berthelot (1866-1934), a French diplomat. Thanks to the co-operation of the Picasso family and private collectors, Guai and Bru - the curators of the exhibition - were able to identify nearly all of Picasso's Japanese erotica and borrowed nearly a third of those designs for the exhibition. The exhibition and catalogue break new ground, casting light on a small part of Picasso's vast output and inviting us to consider yet again the ways in which he as- similated a wide range of exotic influences. Thames &amp; Hud- son published a revised and augmented edition of the catalogue in late 2010. ELLIS TINIOS PICASSO AT MOMA. Exhibitions and their accompa- nying catalogues fit roughly into two categories: those that seek to examine an aspect or theme, often formerly unex- plored, of an artist/movement/period, and those that show and document the holdings of a particular collection, public or private. A Picasso Portfolio: Prìnts from the Museum of Modern Art, by Deborah Wye (New York, The Museum of Modern Art, 2010, 200 pp., 173 col. ills., $40, £25), published to ac- company the exhibition 'Picasso: Themes and Variations', (New York, Museum of Modern Art, 24 March-6 September 2010), sits firmly in the latter category. MOMA's Curator of Prints and Drawings, Deborah Wye, and her team have produced a beautifully illustrated and well- documented catalogue of a remarkable group of Picassos. This is not a ground-breaking kind of catalogue, but does its job of documenting the exhibition extremely well and adds some new information on the subject. I was particularly glad to read Wye's correction (based on research by Anne- Françoise Gavanon) of the common myth that Picasso in- vented the reductionist method of linocutting, and she tells the story of how it was introduced to him by his printer Hi- dalgo Arnera. For a show drawn from a single museum's holdings MOMA's offering was impressive; the exhibition had exam- ples of every print medium Picasso worked in - etching, en- graving, aquatint, lithography, linocut, and even a fine impression of one of the only two woodcuts he made. It also showed an example of every one of the ten most important Picasso prints, with the exception of Buste de Femme au Chapeau (Bloch 1072), colloquially known as the Red Bitch. It also in- cluded (and this is remarkable) at least one set of state proofs of the development of the subject in each medium: lithogra- phy (the famous set of The Bull , 1946, plus Two Nude Women , 1946, and David and Bathsheba , 1947), etching [Pipes, 1946), aquatint and engraving (. Françoise with Long Neck, 1946) and linocut {Jacqueline with Headband , 1962). In accordance with the exhibition's title, the catalogue dedicates a short chapter to each theme in the show, some but not all of which deal with the prints of a particular pe- riod. The sections on the Saltimbanques series and on Cubism deal, of course, with prints made at a specific time, between 1904-05, and 1905-11 respectively. The section on the Mino- taur deals entirely with prints from the 1930s, mostly the Vol- lard Suite, but of course including the great La Minotauromachie , the star of any show of Picasso's prints. The section on 'Animals: Real and Imagined', covers prints from the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s and those on 'Re-enacting the Bullfight' and 'Fauns and Satyrs' cover the etchings of the 1930s and then jump to the emergence of these themes in Pi- casso's linocuts of the late 1950s. The section on 'Lovers and Wives' is, not unexpectedly, the most extensive in the catalogue, as it was in the show, cov- ering the portraits Picasso made of four of his significant re- lationships - Marie-Thérèse Walter, Dora Maar, Françoise Gilot and Jacqueline Roque - in all media and including sumptuous working proofs of several subjects. A fifth rela- tionship, with his first wife Olga Khokhlova, was also repre- sented in the show by the great Portrait d'Olga au Col de foururre from 1923, Picasso's most important print of the 1920s. It is the only major image of his first wife, and exceptionally rare to boot, but the print was acquired too late for inclusion in the catalogue. Of the later sections, 'After The Masters' in- cludes prints after Lucas C ranach and Edouard Manet, all in linocut form, while the final section, simply entitled 'Late Work', abandons the attempt to create a theme from these works made from the mid-1960s on. What does one want from a catalogue of a single-collec- tion show? To my mind, first and foremost good, accurate, plentiful illustrations of the material in the show (my bias PRINT QUARTERLY, XXVII, 20I0, 4</page><page sequence="26">426 NOTES 231. Attributed to Katsukawa Shuncho, Pair of Lovers , colour woodcut, 216 x 330 mm (Private collection, photo Gasull Fo- tografia). comes from being a dealer, trained with Old Master prints, who always values an accurate record of individual impres- sions). The catalogue serves this priority well, with a mini- mum half-page, but mostly full-page, illustration of every state of every print shown in the exhibition. (The model of a missed opportunity, which still makes me weep, was the re- markable Munch show which accompanied Gerd Woll's new catalogue raisonné of Munch's prints in Oslo in 2002 with, as I remember, 8oo-odd prints,' including whole walls of individ- ual states, working proofs and variant inkings of particular subjects - and no accompanying catalogue. Even a colour photocopy of the labels and prints would have been some- tiling-) Now for a digression that really is not one; some exhibition catalogues do not serve their shows well, and some shows do not merit their exhibition catalogues, but some shows deserve a catalogue and do not get one. I am thinking here of Antony Griffiths's show of his personal selection of prints from the British Museum to mark his retirement next year as Keeper, which was at The London Original Print Fair's 25th anniver- sary show in April 2010. The labels for Antony's show (and I will get back to MOMA in a moment) dealt with more of the things people actually talk about, before, during and after a show than any I had ever seen. They said not only where the British Museum had acquired the print but often from whom and for how much, which showed how prescient, or some- times overanxious, the BM had been, and they sometimes commented on the rise or fall of that artist's reputation and therefore prices, since the time of the BM's acquisition. I re- member thinking that the labels were incredibly refreshing and totally appropriate for a show that was part of a com- mercial print fair, and I found myself wishing that there could sometimes be more information in museum exhibitions to do with the commerce as well as with the art, with the stories of pursuit and capture as well as with the imagery. Would it not be useful as well as amusing to know, for example, what MOMA paid for some of its Picasso prints, why, and some- times even how it bought particular subjects when it did and what had happened to the reputation of that period's prints of Picasso in the meantime? A Picasso Portfolio does not break new ground, nor does it attempt to do so, certainly not in any major way, but it is a very sound handbook to the exhibition and to MOMA's col- lection, and arguably more useful for that. The one section I would love to have seen more developed, and in which there is still much room for original research and publication (though I would say this as a print dealer) is that on 'The Mas- ter Printer'. A mere three pages, this merely scratches the sur- face of Picasso's collaborations with his printers.

FREDERICK MULDER EDMUND BLAMPIED. Jersey's best known printmaker, Edmund Blampied, has already been the subject of two cat- alogues raisonnes by Campbell Dodgson of 1926 and by Jean Arnold and John Appleby of 1996, as well as of a biography by Marguerite Syvret. These have been followed by a second biography written by Andrew Hall {Edmund Blampied : An Il- lustrated life , St Helier, Jersey Museum, 10 April-30 October 2010, St Helier, Jersey Heritage, 2010, 274 pp., 303 col. and 15 b. &amp; w. ills., £25). This new volume reveals for the first time the full extent of the artist's commercial work as an illustrator. Hall tells us that he has so far uncovered 202 books and al- most 700 different issues of magazine and newspapers for which the Jerseyman provided images. Much of Blampied's work was the design of book covers. From 1916 he used the diminutive 'Blam' as a signature. Blampied kept his activity as an artist separate from his commercial work, and without outside confirmation it would be quite difficult to see these illustrations as the product of the same mind that created the etchings and lithographs. Also discussed is Blampied's work in the 1930s as a caricaturist. On occasion, his drawings for The Illustrated London News approach the spirit and style of some of his etchings. Now only his paintings require deeper scholarly study. Hall's book is an excellent guide through Blampied's ca- reer, and reading it one can understand why only a relatively small section is devoted to his printmaking. One learns, how- ever, that there is soon to be a third catalogue raisonné. Quite a number of prints, apparently, were not recorded in the 1996 publication. Blampied learnt etching and lithography while attending the London County Council School of Photo-En- graving and Lithography at Bolt Court, rather than at a spe- cialist art school. By no means have all the 26 etchings that he exhibited in March 1914 in an exhibition of students' work at Bolt Court yet come to light. Hall suggests that At the Wings , bound with the annual report of Bolt Court for 1913-14 is the same as The Ballet exhibited in that show and that it was his first formally published print. This 1913 etching already in- cludes some of Blampied's very distinctive jagged cross- hatching, which he used to great success in his mature post-war prints. Early in his career he acquired a very able agent, Marianne van Abbé, sister of another commercial il- lustrator Salomon van Abbé, who established a reputation as an etcher after the war, in his case with subjects derived from the law courts. Marianne married Blampied in 19 14 and was evidendy the mainstay of his life. She introduced the critic H. Granville Fell to her husband's etchings, which he in turn showed to Ernest Brown and Phillips. This resulted in the offer of a seven-year contract. Although the war intervened PRINT QUARTERLY, XXVII, 2010, 4</page><page sequence="28">428 NOTES and Blampied made only a single etching between 19 14 and 1 9 19, the Leicester Galleries showed some of his previous work in their 19 15 'Modern Masters of Etching' exhibition, where the critics already noticed his ability to convey the vivid impression of horses in action. After the war Blampied improved his skills with further studies in etching under Malcolm Osborne and in lithogra- phy under A. S. Hartrick. Like so many of his contemporaries Blampied turned to the master printers, David Strang and H. P. Bray, for his editions of intaglio prints and lithographs respectively, at least until Bray suffered a breakdown c. 1926. Malcolm Salaman became an enthusiastic supporter of his work, the subjects for which were often taken from life in his native Jersey, most notably the collecting of 'vraie' (seaweed) on the beach. This was gathered from the tide line and used locally as a fertiliser. Blampied also etched genre scenes, sometimes showing a humour echoing the work of his French contemporary, Jean Veber. Daumier was obviously as important for him as he was for his brother-in-law, Van Abbé. It is clear too that the Jersey artist was well versed in the etchings of both Rembrandt and Zorn. Most of Blampied's etchings, drypoints and litho- graphs were made between 1919 and 1929, but with the col- lapse of the print market he turned to watercolour and oils for his original artistic works. As late as 1957, however, he was persuaded to make a print for the Royal Society of Painter- Etchers and Engravers' Print Collectors Club. We learn here that 70 of Blampied's etchings and drypoints and thirteen of his lithographs were published. Hall estimates that during the 1920s he received an income of £200-^250 for each edition. In the latter part of Blampied's printmaking career he gained significant support from the American lawyer and collector, Harold James Baily, with whom he began an extensive cor- respondence in 1927. Another American collector of his work was the banker Albert Wiggin. Apart from Van Abbé, Blampied's closest artist friends were the Jersey portrait painter, John St Helier Lander, the etcher John Nicolson and Robert Charles Peter, with whom for a period he shared a house in south London. Peter's fine imaginative mezzotints, although much admired in the 1920s, have still to be redis- covered by modern scholars. MARTIN HOPKINSON RUPERT LEE. Historians of British art of the first half of the last century will mainly remember Rupert Lee as a friend of the Nash brothers and as the chairman of the In- ternational Surrealist Exhibition held in London's New Burlington Gallery in 1936. His work as an artist has largely been forgotten, but Denys J. Wilcox has ensured with his monograph, Rupert Lee. Painter, Sculptor and Pńntmaker with a Cat- alogue Raisonné of the Graphic Work (Bristol, Sansom &amp; Com- pany, 160 pp., 114 col. and 66 b. &amp; w. ills., £29.95), that Lee's place in the inter-war scene can be properly assessed. Lee studied at the Slade at the same time as Robert Gib- bings, his close friend, and Paul Nash, before transferring to the Royal College in the hope of winning a Prix de Rome scholarship. In 191 1 he executed an ambitious tempera paint- ing of Holbein in the House of Sir Thomas More for Chelsea Town Hall, an essay in history painting, a genre which he appears not to have pursued further. One imagines, however, that his lost poster, Shakespeare's England , commissioned for the 19 12 Earl's Court exhibition, may have been in this vein. One of Lee's heroes, Edward Gordon Craig, offered him a post as Musical Director at the theatre school that he intended to start in Florence. Craig told him to study all the Japanese the- atrical masks in the British Museum and to make casts of six of them. But Craig changed his mind and the job never ma- terialized. Instead, Lee tried to make his name as a composer of songs and did some book illustration before being called up. On seeing Gaudier-Brzeska's work, he started to think about becoming a sculptor and made a large number of wa- tercolours inspired by his visits to the zoo. After World War I Lee became an animalier. Wilcox pro- vides a checklist of these works, and of his portraits, nudes and religious sculpture. Some of these pieces were in ceramic. Lee taught alongside Frank Dobson at Westminster School of Art from 1922 and received commissions from Foxton church and St Mary the Less, Cambridge, as well from the Walworth Wesleyan Church in Camberwell. To a slight degree he was probably influenced by Dobson, but his animal pieces are closer to French than to contemporary British work. Like many of his contemporaries, Lee's experiences in the trenches inspired some of his best art, in his case drawings and watercolours. After the war Gibbings taught him wood- engraving and allowed him to use the Crown Albion press in his Chelsea studio, dedicating an impression of his Dublin under Snow to Lee. Lee's 39 wood-engravings made between 1919 and c. 1933 are recorded here, the vast majority executed between 1919 and 1921. He had made an etching in 1915, an Adam and Eve, in a late Symbolist style, but only produced one further intaglio plate. Lee also exhibited two lithographs at the Allied Artists' Association in 1919 of which one was in colour. Most of his wood-engravings were of animals. His most am- bitious plate, however, was The Three Graces , in a distinctly French style showing knowledge of Gauguin. Lee contributed wood-engravings to The Monthly Chapbook in 19 19 and in the following year collaborated with the Nash brothers on The Sun Calendar for the Tear ig20 for the Sun Engraving Company. He also exhibited at the first show of The Society of Wood Engravers. Not mentioned here is that one of his wood-en- gravings, Eve, was used as a poster advertising the dress shop of Miss Jessie Porter of Kensington. The title of the poster is Why worry about Dress. Eve didn't. The British Museum has two proofs, as well as an impression of the finished work. The BM's impression of Panther is dated 1920, rather than 1921, the date assigned to it by Wilcox, and the Museum gives it the title Black Puma. Lee made two wood-engravings of spider monkeys, one of which is in the British Museum (Wilcox 23), where it is titled The Conceited Monkeys. In 1920 Lee began to work as a critic for The Educational Times, The Town Crier and The New Age. He had exhibited with the Friday Club, but he principally showed with the London Group, of which he became President in 1926. This was the reason why he was involved with the 1936 Surreal- ism exhibition, as the London Group had a long association with the New Burlington Galleries. Both Lee and his second wife, Diana Brinton, were experienced exhibition adminis- trators. Lee showed one Surrealist sculpture in the exhibi- tion, but this seems to have been almost a token flirtation. His ousting as President of the London Group later that same year could well have been the result of dissatisfaction with his involvement - or rather lack of it - with the show.

The art world in Russia changed radically after October 1917 when the Bol- shevik Party took control, ousting the old regime and setting up a dictatorship of the proletariat as a prelude to establish- ing Communism. Avant-garde artists embraced the Revo- lution, and in a completely unprecedented manner, redefined art and its rôle within society. By 1921, Construc- tivism had emerged as a radically different way for artists to engage in the task of achieving Socialism - by using their expertise to design useful objects and structures for the new environment. Numerous artists were active in Constructivism, and works by some of these were included in a recent show and catalogue, Rodchenko and Popova: Defining Constructivism , edited by Margarita Tupitsyn (London, Tate Modern, 12 Febru- ary-17 May 2009, Thessaloniki, 18 June - 20 September 2009, Madrid, Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia, 20 October 2009-21 January 2010, London, Tate Publishing, 2009, 192 pp., 210 col. and 15 b. &amp; w. ills., £39.95), but the exhibition mainly focussed on just two, Li- ubov Popova (1889-1924) and Alexander Rodchenko (1891- !956), who between them covered a wide range of experimentation and were thus able to supply a wealth of insights into this unique creative episode. The catalogue documents the show well, through its profuse illustrations and informative essays, which provide good introductions to the artists, their theories and the visual abundance that they created amidst the deprivations and hardships of the early revolutionary period. The show and catalogue provide a comprehensive overview of the artists' theory and practice, giving equal space to 'his' and 'her' Constructivism. Yet why is not the title alphabetical, with Popova first? If anyone still clings to gender stereotypes in art or lingering notions about intrin- sically feminine approaches to art, exposure to her monu- mental and powerful paintings will abolish them for ever. Both the exhibition and the catalogue open with the artists' abstract paintings, in which they forged a new artistic vocabulary and explored painting's essence as a two-dimen- sional construct, including its basic components, such as colour, line, the plane, etc. In Popova's Painterly Architectonic, of 1918, intersecting planes of blue and orange produce a dy- namic composition in which paint is impastoed, hatched, and sawdust has been added to create a variety of pictorial tex- tures {faktura in Russian). This concern was developed further in her later Space-Force Construction of 1921 , where circular and straight lines, built up with layers of pigment applied with a palette knife, create multilayered and dynamic structures on an unpainted plywood surface. Similarly rigorous and un- compromising, Rodchenko produced paintings using a com- pass and ruler to define form, works in which planes are constructed from a network of lines, canvases where stippled geometric forms shade into each other, and one work con- sisting simply of a white zig-zag line painted on a black ground. In autumn 1921 he announced the end of painting with his monochromatic triptych, Pure Red Colour, ; Pure Yellow Colour and Pure Blue Colour , which reduces painting to its ab- solute minimum: there is no image; the canvases are painted uniformly and flatly, with little modulation, so that there is no sense of depth, space, or texture, and the painted 'surface by itself is form', identical with the picture plane. Earlier Rodchenko had extended the line and plane into three dimensions, examining their dynamic interaction with space in an extensive series of constructed sculptures, recon- structed by Alexander Lavrentiev after the lost originals. Rod- chenko's Construction No 12 , The Ellipse , of 192 1, literally consists of a sheet of plywood into which a series of concen- tric shapes were cut, rotated out of the plane to create a com- plex structure of solids and voids and suspended in space. This move into three dimensions presaged the more revolu- tionary step of abandoning art completely for design. Like other Constructivists, Popova and Rodchenko com- pletely discarded all conventional notions concerning hierar- chies and distinctions between the arts, approaching painting, sculpture, print making, architecture and various aspects of design (poster, film, fashion, clothing, theatre) with the same aesthetic and ideological precepts. In all their work, there was an enduring concern for exploring the nature of the medium and a commitment to geometry, valued for its impersonality, and its associations with mathematics, technology, and the collective nature of the industrial proletariat. These qualities can be seen in Popova's scaffolding-like set for the play The Magnanimous Cuckold , 1922, and her designs for costumes, clothing, textiles and posters, as well as in Rodchenko's Work- ers' Club (Paris, 1925), his drawings of kiosks, his photographs, and his many advertisements, such as that for Red October biscuits (1923), where a smiling girl is suspended in a hexagon. The continuities in fundamental approach and language be- tween work for different purposes and at different scales show that, for these artists, a design for a poster, a sweet wrapper or a swathe of fabric was as much a work of art as a painting, a print, or a drawing. As the catalogue demonstrates, this was an exceptional period of artistic creativity, producing ideas and works that continue to inspire and delight. CHRISTINA LODDER DINO VILLANI. In the course of his long career the printmaker Dino Villani rarely left the Lombard plain and Po valley. Very much a regionalist, his work is probably little known today, 21 years after his death. The publication of Dino Villani. L'opera xilografica (Mantua, Centro Studi Sartori per la Grafica and Arianna Sartori, 2010, 176 pp., 142 b. &amp; w. ills., free) edited by Arianna Sartori on the occasion of an exhibi- tion at the Fondazione CORRENTE in Milan, offers the op- portunity for wider dissemination of knowledge of his work. Mariella Milan, Luca Pietro Nicoletti and Maria Gabriella Savoia contributed essays to this volume, which also includes a very full bibliography and a chronology of Villani's career. The artist was born in 1898 at Nogara between Verona and the Po. Initially he worked for the Italian state railways as a stationmaster, before joining Fratelli Bertazzoni, a firm based in Suzzara, which was establishing a high reputation for its kitchen ranges. Villani had a keen interest in the arts, founding a Circolo di Cultura in this small town in the province of Mantua before he took up painting in his mid- twenties. His first prints were linocuts advertising films shown at the local cinema in Suzzara in which his employers had an interest, and illustrating the programme of a recital of the cellist, Gilberto Crepax. Among Villani's earliest inde- pendent block-prints was a linocut portrait of this musician, who taught at the Milan Conservatory and edited the sonatas of Boccherini. A later woodcut of the maestro is re- PRINT QUARTERLY, XXVII, 20I0, Ą.</page><page sequence="30">430 NOTES produced here. This was the proper start of Villani's dual career as a graphic artist in the field of publicity and as a printmaker. As an advertiser, Villani eventually rose to be President of the Associazione tecnici ed artisti della pubblic- ità in 1946 and Presidente della Federazione Italiana della Pubblicità in 1950. An illustration included here shows that he had made a woodcut, Mensa popolare (Al mercato ), as early as 19 17. We are not told where Villani learnt to make prints. He does not seem to have attended an academy of art, even for evening classes. However, he soon attracted the attention of the Bolognese typographer, Cesare Ratta, who included exam- ples of his work in the publication L'incisione ońginale sul legno in Italia of 1929. Similarities have been noted between Vil- lani's woodcuts and those of the slightly younger Mantuan sculptor, Giuseppe Gorni, ten of whose prints were published in the same volume. Gorni was one of the contributors to Mino Maccari's II Selvaggio. Nicoletti compares the sculptor's 1926 illustrations to Virgil's Georgics to the prints of Villani. Gorni's prints can be seen at the Museo diffuso 'Giuseppe Gorni' in Nuvolato. Villani's prints are in a rustic style befitting his subject- matter, the life, landscape and work in the Po valley. He soon developed a style of hatching that resembles little strands of straw. There is nothing of the academicism and politesse of most of his Romagnole contemporaries or of other followers of Adolfo de Carolis. Villani was in contact with Ettore Coz- zani, the founder of U Eroica, and was doubtless aware of the work of Lorenzo Viani. However, his Expressionism was much less violent and his woodcuts remained fairly conven- tional throughout his long career. Luigi Servolini wrote ap- preciatively of Villani's work, both in Technica della xilografia of 1935 and La xilografia of 1950. Villani's style remained es- sentially the same throughout his life. The last dated woodcut reproduced in this volume is of 1983. Villani was the print- maker who captured the central Po valley most faithfully in the second and third quarters of the last century. This is the setting of Riccardo Bacchelli's famous three-volume novel, II Mulino del Po , of 1938 to 1940, and one cannot help thinking that that writer was aware of these woodcuts. Villani was a close friend of the Neo-realist screenwriter Cesare Zavattini, a native of Luzzara, just a few miles south of Suzzara, which was the subject of a print by Villani repro- duced here. For Villani was also a recorder of townscapes, being particularly attracted to the mediaeval and Renaissance buildings of Mantua. Woodcuts show that he travelled to Venice, Padua, San Marino and Assisi, but there are no prints of subjects far north of the Po. A boxing match of 1933 seems to have been an isolated incidence of a study of vigorous ac- tion. One cannot help comparing Villani's devotion to the ordinary people of the Po plain to Segantini's commitment to the farming community beneath the Alps. The artist also made drypoints, two of which were included in the third vol- ume of Ratta's Acquafortisti italiani. Just after World War II Za- vattini provided the preface for Oltrepò , which included 37 woodcuts by Villani, and in 1963 Edizioni Omnia in Milan published Ritorno sul Po. Con xilografie dell'autore. Near the end of the artist's life Frattini published two al- bums of drypoints, the first with a preface by Sassu, the sec- ond with a preface by Guttuso. The majority of Villani's prints, however, were sold singly. In 1992 the artist's heirs pre- sented 228 of his works to the Coop. Fera of Palidano di Gon- zaga in the province of Mantua, as well as 74 to the Centro di Formazione Professionale-Scuola Arte e Mestieri 'F. Bertazzoni' of Suzzara. These gifts very much reflected Vil- lani's political interests. Finally, in 2004 the family gave all the artist's woodblocks and plates to Adalberto Sartori in Man- tua. After conservation the Centro Studi Sartori per la Grafica has published small editions of between three and 25 impressions taken from the matrices in its care. In 2007 there was an exhibition of Villani's poster collection at the Museo della Publicita in the Castello di Rivoli. In addition, the Bib- liomediateca Rai in Turin in its Centro Documentazione 'Dino Villani' houses the artist's library and his collection of posters, publicity material, cuttings and postcards. MARTIN HOPKINSON CAMPARI LITE. This year marks the 150th anniversary of the invention of Campari, Milan's iconic ruby-red apentivo. From the very beginning the company pursued a dynamic and innovatory approach to marketing its products and was among the first to fully grasp and harness the power of the advertising poster, which emerged as a new and effective means of communication towards the end of the nineteenth century. Aiming to create a sophisticated brand profile, dur- ing the early 1900s Campari was to work with some of the most celebrated poster designers of the day, such as Marcello Dudovich, Giuseppe Magagnoli and Leonetto Cappiello. It was, however, the revolutionary campaigns created for Cam- pari by the Futurist artist Fortunato Depero from the mid- 19208 onward that arguably represent the company's best-known and most celebrated commissions (fig. 233). Pop- ulated by his trademark puppet-like characters, Depero's bold, witty and geometric designs marked a sea change in Campari's advertising strategy, no longer relying on narrative elements to engage the viewer's attention, but rather on a strong visual immediacy and an unmistakable signature style. A co-author with the artist Giacomo Balla of the 19 15 man- ifesto 'Futurist Reconstruction of the Universe', Depero was a pioneering figure who perceived advertising as a means of realizing Futurism's ambition to fuse art with life, combating the elitist attitudes that restricted the artist's sphere of influ- ence to the walls of museums by proclaiming the publicity poster to be 'the painting of the future'. A recent volume (Alessandro Mendini, Steven Guarnaccia and Beppe Finessi, Camparisoda: l'aperìtivo dell'arte veloce futurista da Fortunato Depero a Matteo Ragni , Mantua, Corraini Edizioni, 2009, 96 pp., 62 col. and 13 b. &amp; w. ills., €18), dedicated specif- ically to the 1932 innovation of 'Campari Soda' (pre-mixed servings of the drink, sold in conical bottles that were also based on drawings by Depero) aims to bring the story of Campari's long-standing relationship with the visual arts up to date, presenting the work of more recent artists and de- signers who have created imagery inspired by the brand. The book is divided into three sections, the first of which is a brief consideration of the work of Depero by Alessandro Mendini, former director both of Domus and Casabella. The second comprises a series of Campari-related cartoons by the illus- trator Steven Guarnaccia that to some extent partake of De- pero's whimsical spirit, while the third casts an eye over several of the designer Matteo Ragni's recent projects for the company such as his 'Clic' glass, a drinking vessel designed PRINT QUARTERLY, XXVII, 2010, 4</page><page sequence="31">NOTES 431 IDOLATRIA %»Ï-Lu&amp; «f m ww All Ji » (mmalCMM LIQUOR 233.

The book is in many ways engaging and well-designed, dominated by a red, black and white colour scheme reflecting the colour of its subject-matter and the monochromatic char- acter of many of Depero's striking graphic images. As befits a book over which the Futurist influence looms large, it draws on many familiar elements of Modernist book art in its un- conventional shape (tall and narrow), use of a number of dif- ferent fonts and types of paper and inclusion of a fold-out section. A playful touch is worked into the book's slipcase, which incorporates a cut-out element in the shape of a Cam- pari Soda bottle. This 'bottle' seems full when the book is in- serted into the slipcase, its red cover filling the void, yet appears to be drained through a straw by one of Guarnac- cia's cartoon characters as one slides the book downwards, out of its sleeve. The ultimate purpose of the publication, however, re- mains unclear. Short on content in terms of both text and imagery, it feels superficial and sparse, and while constituting little more than a promotional brochure it is presented as a book with a retail price of ťi8. Beppe Finessi's essay concern- ing Ragni's projects for Campari-themed bars, mobile kiosks and promotional sculptures ('luminous urban installations' in the form of the ubiquitous conical bottle, dispensing facts about the history of the company and Futurism through loudspeakers) reads more like a florid press release. In his per- functory consideration of Depero's achievements, Mendini lauds the Futurist's imagery as a high point in Modernism and the development of advertising, but has no room to lo- cate his work in any useful art-historical context, whether that of Futurism in particular or Campari's historical association with the arts more generally. Guarnaccia's cartoons are pleas- ant enough, playing with the iconography and rituals of l'ora del Campań (Campari time) to create a series of visual puns of which the sequence entitled 'To each Italian town its own Camparisoda' is a good example (Pisa being represented by a colossal, tilting bottle). Yet even these are rather slight in their visual impact and, while the ideas are fun, the impres- sion that Depero could have unlocked their full potential is inescapable. In short, while the book is undeniably an attractive object, it feels rather trifling and does not do justice to its subject. For an overview of Campari's recent promotional activities a visit to its stylish website is ultimately more rewarding. CHRISTO- PHER ADAMS GERMAINE ERNST. Born in Algeria in 1905, the daughter of a Swiss textile merchant, Germaine Ernst moved with her family to Lausanne in 19 13, and the city that became central to her life is the home of the Fondation Germaine Ernst, the publisher, with Infolio Editions, of the first mono- graph on her work (Magali Junet, Germaine Ernst: Peintre et graveur i goj-igg6y Gollion, Infolio Editions, 2009, 208 pp., 140 col. and 2 b. &amp; w. ills., CHF52, C35). She studied for five years at the Ecole d'Art Applique of Nora Gross in Lausanne be- fore spending six months in Paris in 1926-27, attending both the Ecole des Beaux-Arts and the Sorbonne. Although this was the first of several visits to France, she remained very much Swiss-based and appears to have very rarely exhibited outside the borders of Switzerland. In painting and print- making alike there is no sign that Ernst had any great interest in wider European art and artists. In Paris, however, she was introduced in depth to Oriental art, particularly Japanese prints, Hindu and Mughal art. An interest in Oriental sub- ject-matter was already evident in her earliest prints, linocuts that she made in Switzerland. Ernst studied intaglio printmaking in 1928 with Violette Diserens, who had been one of her professors at art school. This quickly became her preferred artistic method. Junet es- timates that Ernst made nearly 170 prints between 1930 and 1940, during which period she painted only 25 canvases. She was proficient in etching, drypoint, aquatint and sugar lift. At the same time she pursued a career as an illustrator, fre- quently choosing exotic Eastern subjects taken from Swiss, French and British authors, including Conrad and Kipling, as well as the Mahabharata. None of these was published in books. Ernst made several journeys abroad including to Rome, Venice, Cesenatico and Gabicce on the Adriatic coast of Italy, Barcelona, Saint Jean de Luz and Marseille, as well as return- ing to Paris, which provided motifs for townscapes and land- scapes. She had her first print exhibition at the Galerie Foetisch in Lausanne in 1935. In the 1950s Ernst turned to re- ligious subjects and in the following decade took to making prints recording the victims of society. Junet compares these late works with the lithographs of the horrors of World War I, made by her fellow Swiss, Steinlen. Indeed, throughout her career Ernst remains closest to her compatriots, particularly those from the canton of Vaud, of which Lausanne is the capital. In her printmaking she was most indebted to Diserens and René Auberjonois. She continued to make prints into her very late 70s, the last being made in 1984. The Société des Peintres, Sculpteurs et Architectes Suisses, founded in 1866, excluded women on principle. Hodler was vehement in his opposition to their admission. It was only in 1973 that it relented and opened its doors. One of the most valuable sections of this monograph is devoted to the struggle of women artists in the Vaud for artistic recognition, in which Ernst played a prominent part. She succeeded Violette Dis- erens as president of the Section Vaudoise of the Société Ro- mande de Femmes Peintres et Sculpteurs in 1932. The same year Ernst became a member of the Société Suisse des Femmes Peintres, Sculpteurs et Décorateurs, and was imme- diately made secretary of its Section Vaudoise. She was Pres- ident of this section from 1934 to 1939. Ernst was the first Secretary General of the Société Suisse des Femmes Peintres, Sculpteurs et Décorateurs after it moved its headquarters from Geneva to Lausanne. She held the post from 1943 to ■946- Junet also writes of the groups and associations devoted to printmaking in Switzerland, such as La Société Suisse de Gravure (Schweizerische Graphische Gesellschaft). Little groups of printmakers existed alongside it, including Die Walze, Das Graphische Kabinett, Der Graphische Kreis, Al- lianz and later Xylos. As their names suggest, their member- ship was predominantly German Swiss. In 1930 a touring exhibition organized by Fred Fay showed the Artistes Graveurs de la Suisse Latine. Two years later Ernst con- tributed work to an exhibition of prints put together by the Société des Peintres, Sculpteurs et Architectes Suisses and was also included in two exhibitions entitled 'Schweizerische PRINT QUARTERLY, XXVII, 2010, 4</page><page sequence="33">NOTES 433 Graphik der Gegenwart', organized by the Graphische Sammlung of the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule Zürich in 1932 and 1939. A group of printmakers in the Suisse Romande founded Tailles &amp; Morsures in Pully in 1942. This was the initiative of Marcel Pointet, who in 1940 had organized an 'Exposition de la Gravure Romande Contemporaine', a show of almost 150 prints by 21 artists at the Galerie de la Guilde de Livre in Lau- sanne. Initially there were 23 members in the new group, seven of them women. Marcel Pointet was its President. The group lasted ten years. Thirty-five artists were involved from the cantons of Geneva, Vaud and Neuchâtel. Eighteen exhi- bitions were held in Geneva, Lausanne, Berne, Zurich, Aarau, Lugano, Montreux and various smaller towns. Each year the group contributed to a section in the Premier Salon de Lausanne. In 1949 prints were exhibited at the Biblio- thèque Nationale in Paris. The group's most important exhi- bition consisted of 97 prints by nineteen artists at the Kunsthalle Berne in 1945. Perhaps the best-known print- maker involved was Albert-Edgar Yersin. MARTIN HOPKIN- SON JAPANESE PRINT MUSEUM. In the spring of 2009 a new private museum, Nihon no hanga: Japans Prentenkabi- net (Japanese Print Collection), opened in Amsterdam. The museum founders, Cees and Elise Wessels, assembled the col- lection now housed in it over the past fifteen years and intend to continue adding to it. At present it includes nearly 1,000 woodblock prints, 90 per cent of which date from the twen- tieth century The museum website (http:/ /www.nihon-no- hanga.nl/ about) explains: 'Nihon no hanga has as its goal to provide a comprehensive overview of the developments in 20th century Japanese print production, with an emphasis on the pre-war period.' Both Shin hanga ('new prints') and Sosáku hanga ('creative prints') are represented in the collection. Com- mercial publishers produced Shin hanga , coordinating the work of artists, block-cutters and printers just as their predecessors had done in the Edo period (1 600-1868). They created works of extraordinary technical perfection that encompassed a lim- ited range of subjects chosen for their appeal to foreign - par- ticularly American - collectors. Sosáku hanga were, in theory, entirely the creation of one man, the artist, who not only pro- duced the design but also cut the printing blocks and printed from them without the intervention of a publisher. There was no precedent in Japan for such prints. Shin hanga and Sosáku hanga , with their exclusive reliance on woodblock printing and their emphasis on the human figure and on landscapes, rep- resent just one aspect of printmaking in twentieth-century Japan. Works by artists employing a wide range of imported Western printing techniques are not represented in the col- lection. This emphasis on woodblock prints - and conven- tional subjects presented in them - is characteristic of many European and American collections of twentieth-century Japanese prints. Visits to the Nihon no hanga museum are by appointment only and may be booked through the website. The director plans to have the entire collection available online by spring 201 1. Part of the Museum's remit is to mount two exhibitions a year. A catalogue will be issued for each exhibition. The three so far published are: Chris Uhlenbeck, Broad Strokes and Fine Lines (Amsterdam, Nihon no hanga, 2009, 48 pp., 41 col. ills., ( 7.50), which provides a general introduction to the col- lection; Noemi Raquet and Chris Uhlenbeck, The Urban Landscape and Leisure (Amsterdam, Nihon no hanga, 2009, 64 pp., 54 col. ills., €12.50); and Chris Uhlenbeck, Maureen de Vries and Elise Wessels, Emergingfrom the Bath: the Nude in 20th- century Japanese Pńnts (Amsterdam, Nihon no hanga, 2010, 64 pp., 49 col. ills., (12.50). The last two highlight the two genres favoured by the collectors: prints of landscapes and prints of beauties. Each catalogue contains a short essay and a gener- ous number of colour images. ELLIS TINIOS HENRY MOORE. No one can be better positioned to provide a scholarly overview of Henry Moore's prints than David Mitchinson, the recently retired Head of Collections and Exhibitions at the Henry Moore Foundation, whose in- volvement with the artist and his work stretches back over four decades. His exemplary and elegant publication, Henry Moore : Pńnts and Portfolios (Geneva, Patrick Cramer, 2010, 408 pp., 543 col. and 308 b. &amp; w. ills., £75, de luxe £2,000), fo- cusses on Moore's graphic work, produced either for de luxe books or portfolios, and complements the four-volume cat- alogue raisonné co-edited by Mitchinson Henry Moore: Catalogue of Graphic Work , i-iv, Geneva, 1973-88. The book was re- leased to coincide with an exhibition, 'Henry Moore Deluxe: Books, Prints &amp; Portfolios' (Perry Green, The Henry Moore Foundation, Sheep Field Barn Gallery, 20 March-30 August 2010). Over half of Moore's graphic output, 363 prints, falls within the scope of this new study and provides the opportu- nity to consider these projects within an overview of both his sculpture and drawing. The etchings and lithographs dis- cussed include work responding to numerous writers, among them W. H. Auden and André Gide, as well as portfolios in tribute to other artists such as Picasso and Rothko. Mitchin- son researches the sources for the prints. He reveals for ex- ample, the way in which Moore on occasion used his own much earlier drawings as starting points, as was the case with the 1933 sketch Ideas for Metal Sculpture , which provided the sculptural figures for the lithograph Reclining and Standing Figure and Family Group published 40 years later. The volume is rich in these connections. The relationship of the graphic work both to sculptures and drawings as well as photography is continually reiterated, opening up new readings. The thoroughness of the scholarship is evident throughout, one example being the revelation of the source material in a small collage, Three Reclining Figures , of 1 971, in which a Rothko reproduction placed on its side, a fragment from a Mirò invitation card and a reclining figure from Moore's own poster for an exhibition in Florence, are finally brought together in a coloured lithograph, Reclining Figure with Red Strìpes included in the book Henry Moore: Energy in Space (Munich 1973). Mitchinson quotes Moore as saying: 'Graphic work to me is exactly the same as drawing. If you can draw well you can etch well because it is only using a finer point. The technical side is relatively simple', which suggests a certain pragmatism on Moore's behalf, rather than experimentation and immer- sion. Moore's prints map the territory, reworking themes and drawing heavily on his own earlier output as subject-matter. Sheets of drawings that present either a range of views of a single sculptural form or a free flowing orchestration of re- PRINT QUARTERLY, XXVII, 20 IO, 4</page><page sequence="34">434 NOTES lated ideas - often later used by Moore as motifs for prints - are among his most memorable images. The volume documents the various approaches to tech- nique adopted by Moore and provides invaluable informa- tion, in particular on the use of drawing film and transfer paper for lithography developed by Stanley Jones, the master printer at the Curwen Press. The use of film allowed for ex- perimentation, especially in terms of the backgrounds in Moore's lithographs, with accident and chance playing a rôle before final resolution. Mitchinson's commentary throughout is enlightening, not only for insights into the technical processes of printmaking but also for the way in which a rounded portrait of Moore emerges - a very human portrait of a man increasingly in demand for prints and projects, working against publishers' deadlines. There is a clear sense of the great man being courted and encouraged in order to deliver and of the personalities, publishers, printers and gallery owners all dependent on his output. This is expressed both in terms of tensions and in gentle observations, as in the touching description of the 'small piece of theatre' as Stanley Jones would open up wrapped parcels of prints for Moore's inspection, and the occasions when he forgot to use litho crayon when drawing on transfer paper, rendering the draw- ings useless for lithography. The portfolio that really stands out is 'Elephant Skull', 28 etchings in which Moore approached the object in question as if it were an ancestral landscape. Mitchinson suggests that this was the occasion when Moore first really immersed him- self in etching, and he describes how the maquette studio in Perry Green was transformed into a print studio, with Moore drawing some 36 plates in a period of eleven days. The re- sulting etchings, made predominantly through line, built up volumes through the use of cross-hatching or sometimes with a more simple open line, that maps the forms in much the same way as a contour or a computer-generated wire-frame drawing functions to describe a form. The books publication also coincided with 'Henry Moore' at Tate Britain (24 February-8 August 2010). The Tate exhi- bition endeavoured to position Moore as a more radical fig- ure, a reading that has met with a certain degree of resistance from the critical press, and the decision to exclude prints from this survey was certainly questionable. Without doubt, prints from either the 'Stonehenge' or the 'Reclining figure' portfo- lios would have made a substantial contribution to the argu- ment for the presence of darker more primitive forces. PAUL COLDWELL JOHN CAGE. In 1984 the Fruitmarket Gallery in Edin- burgh staged a fine exhibition of the prints of composer and artist John Cage. Much to my regret as a curator, I failed to stress sufficiently the importance of making an acquisition at that time. It has taken 26 years for Britain to see a selec- tion of works on paper by this outstanding artist again. The touring exhibition organized by the Hayward Gallery, in collaboration with BALTIC Centre for Contemporary Art and the John Cage Trust, opened in Gateshead in June 2010. From the north-east it has moved to Kettle's Yard in Cambridge and it will be shown in 201 1 at Huddersfield Art Gallery and the Hunterian Museum and Art Gallery, Uni- versity of Glasgow, before it finds a very appropriate final venue in the De La Warr Pavilion, Erich Mendelssohn's great building designed with Serge Chermayeff in 1934, which houses a concert hall overlooking the sea at Bexhill. The accompanying catalogue, John Cage: Every Day is a Good Day (London, Hayward Publishing, 201 1, 176 pp., 73 col. and 19 b. &amp; w. ills., £17.99), includes an introduction by Roger Malbert and an essay by the artist Jeremy Millar, who con- ceived the show. Interviews are published here between Mil- lar and Ray Kass, Laura Kuhn, Julie Lazar, and Kathan Brown, who invited Cage to work at Crown Point Press. Brown wrote a marvellous account of Cage's work there in John Cage: Visual Art To Sober and Quiet the Mind (San Francisco 2001), which was reviewed in Print Quarterly (xviii, 2001, pp. 466-67). She also contributes sensitive and informative cap- tions to some of the works illustrated here, as does Helen Luckett. Luckett and Lauren A. White have compiled an A to Z of short texts on Cage's themes and influences, making good use of quotations from the artist's writings and inter- views. In addition, Irving Sandler's account of his 1966 in- terview with Cage is republished from the critic's 2003 memoir, A Sweeper-up after Artists. Ray Kass established the Mountain Lake Workshop deep in the Appalachians in south-west Virginia, where he invited Cage, an avid mycologist, to lead a mushroom hunt in the spring of 1983. Eventually Cage was to make almost all his watercolours on various visits there between 1983 and 1990. Laura Kuhn, the director of the John Cage Trust, worked with him on a number of large-scale projects between 1986 and his death in 1992. Julie Lazar, while Curator of the Mu- seum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, was his close col- laborator in the staging of the touring exhibition, 'Rolywholyover: A Circus', a multidisciplinary show organ- ized according to chance operations following the artist's method of using the I Ching. This changing exhibition in- cluded works drawn from the museum's own collections as well as his own prints, drawings and scores. The height and location of works on display were periodically altered accord- ing to a score composed by ROVER, a computer programme that 'composed' the artworks in time and space. If the in- structions led to pieces overlapping, they would be removed to a secure but visible store within the gallery until the com- puter indicated the time for the next change in the displays. One of the illustrations in this catalogue shows an installation view of Cage musical scores and prints in which their place- ment was determined by drawing numbers out of two hats (one to select the work, the other to give its intended location). Lazar notes that this process evokes Duchamp's 19 13 Erratum Musical. To judge by the illustration here, the resulting display sometimes also had a kinship with early Russian Construc- tivist exhibitions. The interview of most interest to print lovers is of course that with Kathan Brown. Cage visited Crown Point fifteen times over fifteen years, staying for a week or longer working with the printers Paul Singhdahlsen, Stephen Thomas and Lilah Toland. It was Brown's husband Tom Marioni, a con- ceptual artist and printmaker, who had recommended his in- vitation. Artists, according to Brown, have been the keenest purchasers of his prints. She sees a direct connection between Cage's printmaking and his composing. He himself com- pared his set Changes and Disappearances , begun in 1979 , in which the final print has 298 colours, with the complicated Freeman Etudes. Process was primary for Cage, who gradually PRINT QUARTERLY, XXVII, 20I0, 4</page><page sequence="35">NOTES 435 moved through the techniques, etchings being succeeded by engraving, monotypes made with strings, silkscreen, colla- graph relief monotypes, photo-etching, drypoint by itself, aquatint, sugar lift and spit-bite aquatint, and lithography. The last technique he had previously used between 1969 and 1972 when working with Irwin Hollander in New York, sev- eral years before he came to California. Brown clearly and elegantly explains how the various series were made at Crown Point. Cage recognized that his work was not totally governed by chance. He maintained that his choices consisted of which questions to ask of the I Ching. Brown saw that the succeeding use of chance resulted in 'interconnecting skeins' of prints. Some of Cage's series, particularly the Ryonaji prints show, 'a long train of thought', in this case developed over nine years, which manifested itself in drawings, watercolours and music as well as in prints. Brown sees his sliding tones in the Ryonaji music and the layering 'with interpénétration' of his late music as a whole, as related to these prints begun in 1983. MARTIN HOPKINSON LUCIAN FREUD. When Jean Clair brought Freud's touring retrospective organized by the British Council to the Centre Pompidou in 1987, the reaction was a combination of incomprehension and derision. As Clair commented: 'All the press did to address this strangeness was talk of 'blotchy flesh', whereas no art historian would dare compare the pure reds and greens Matisse used in his Fauve portraits to those of an overripe pear or nettle rash'. Twenty or so years on, Freud is back at the Pompidou with a retrospective 'Lucian Freud: The Studio', that looks at his career through the theme of the artist's studio (Centre Na- tional d'Art et de Culture George Pompidou, Paris, 10 March- 1 9 July 2010). The show comprises mainly work of the last 30 years - some 50 oil paintings, a few drawings and a dozen prints and a selection of revealing photographs of his studio by Bruce Bernard and David Dawson, Freud's as- sistant. Enthusiastic reviews and long queues suggest that this time Freud has struck home. The exhibition catalogue, on the other hand, seems rather insecure (. Lucian Freud: The Studio , Munich, Hirmer Verlag, 2010, 256 pp., 201 col. and 43 b. &amp; w. ills., ( 44.90, CHF72.90). After a dozen full pages of Dawson's photographs, the fore- word starts with the question: 'Where does the artist stand? Is he demiurge or small fry?'. This sets the tenor for much of the texts that follow which seem nervous about fully engaging with Freud's work and over-concerned that Freud is 'the most expensive artist in the world' and that his renown has grown among 'wealthy collectors', suggesting that Freud's work 'has often owed its fame to reasons such as record auction prices'. The works themselves are generously illustrated, inter- spersed with pertinent and blunt comments from Freud about his work. From a print point of view the etchings are immac- ulately captioned - including the names of printer and pub- lisher (often omitted from his print catalogues) - but the selection is certainly not of Freud's best and contains no key early images. The illustrations are preceded by five essays, of which the first, 'The Painter and his Context', however, sets the scene perfectly well, discussing Freud's background and influences and the emergence of the so-called School of Lon- don. This is followed by Jean Clair, Freud's original Gallic champion, who is very clear in his views and in 'Freud, the Biologist' tackles his painting head on. Three further essays follow, these being 'Realist Echoes of Lucian Freud' (80 per cent Courbet - whom Freud admires), 'The Secret Studio' and 'Paint Walls', by which time some repetition and more digression is creeping in, and one wished for a single more coherent essay, preferably by Clair. After the catalogue illustrations, Cécile Debray, the Cura- tor and catalogue editor, offers further sections of 'Analyses' - 'Interiors', 'Exteriors', 'Reflections', 'On Painting', 'As flesh' and 'Watteau', Chardin', 'Constable' and 'Cezanne'. The lat- ter four relate to Freud's reinterpretation of paintings by the four artists, and 'Reflections' discusses Freud's self-portraits and his use of mirrors. These are reasonable stand-alone es- says, if forced in places, but start to seem a little desperate in the context of the catalogue, and the repetition becomes more irritating. A Chronology follows, which is also a com- mentary and generally pretty good, but it repeats chunks of what has gone before - particularly Freud's own comments about his paintings - so that one is frequently reading these for the third time. At this stage one wonders if the catalogue has been edited or merely assembled. Sadly, the quality of the main illustrations is not particu- larly good. The colour balance is erratic and the definition not as sharp as it should be. This is most evident in the etch- ings. Freud uses only line, and most of his lines are drawn with equal weight, although differentiated in tone when bit- ten. Too often they appear fuzzy in these illustrations and oc- casionally lose the essence of the line entirely. And the printing quality of the illustrations in the Chronology, printed on slightly textured paper, is frankly dire, not to say repellent. For example, Freud's 'Hotel Bedroom' from the 1950s shows the slightly satanic artist staring at his wife in bed; an impor- tant and disturbing painting rather robbed of its effect in that it has turned purple and the artist's features are almost un- readable. The catalogue is translated from the French, so the occa- sional use of 'engraving' for 'etching' is annoying but excus- able. Some proofing errors are not. In one of the repeated discussions of 'Large Interior Notting Hill', Francis Wynd- ham becomes mysteriously Syndham, the titles of paintings in the text differ from the captions on the same page, the numbered references to illustrations in the text sometimes dif- fer from those of the captions and I eventually found Corinth's 'Reclining Nude', whose reference led to a Bacon, seventeen pages later. I could go on. It all seems a bit of a waste; a major exhibition in territory that has been alien to Freud was an opportunity to produce an important catalogue, but this glossy hardback book turns out to be something of a dog's breakfast. Sorry. DAVID CASE BARBARA RAE. One of Scodand's foremost contempo- rary landscape painters, the Falkirk-born Barbara Rae has been a keen printmaker ever since she studied at Edinburgh College of Art between 1961 and 1965. Andrew Lambirth's monograph, Barbara Rae Prints (London, Royal Academy of Arts, 2010, 160 pp., 171 col. ills., £35), charts her work through her association with print studios in Scotland, the United States and Ireland rather than in a strictly chronological fash- ion. From this book it appears that Rae's first involvement with these studios came in 1983 at Peacock Printmakers (now Peacock Visual Arts) in Aberdeen, when she made an etching, PRINT QUARTERLY, XXVII, 2010, '</page><page sequence="36">436 NOTES screenprint and chine collé. A year later she made two litho- graphs at Glasgow Print Studio. However, discussion of Rae's partnership with the Glasgow studio here precedes her work with the Aberdeen studio. Readers of this monograph will find it helpful to consult the chronology in Gareth Wardell, Bill Hare and Andrew Lambirth, Barbara Rae (Aldershot 2008), a book on the artist's paintings where one can also find a bibliography, which is completely lacking here. The first twenty years of Rae's printmaking are discussed in Lambirth's brief introductory essay. She received her first instruction in printmaking from Archie Imrie, best known as a stamp designer, who ran a department in Edinburgh Col- lege of Art's Design School, not in the Fine Art School. Rae's first lithograph, made on stone c. 1961-62, was much influ- enced by the work of the then Head of Painting, Robin Philipson, who not so long before had been one of those artists making colour lithographs with Harley Brothers. Lam- birth refers to Rae having a moment of kitchen-sink realism in Butcher's Shop , of 1963 (not illustrated here). The same year she also made a woodcut, Baths, and in 1965 a screenprint, Swimmers , in both of which the figures were abstracted. How- ever, Rae soon largely dropped figuration for landscape, por- trayed in a Romantic Expressionist style. Swimmers already has the rich unnaturalistic colours that are found throughout her later work. She herself compares it to a stained-glass window, and one should remember the still potent influence in Scot- land of the abstract art of the Ecole de Paris in the 1960s. Rae recycled many of her early woodcuts and screenprints, making use of parts of them in collages 'for eight or ten years'. One does not glean how many prints she made from the mid-1960s to the early 1980s and how many of these have survived her culling process, because her work of this period is passed over in silence. One knows that she taught print- making at Aberdeen College of Education between 1972 and 1975 and that she made prints in 1974 both at Peacock Print- makers and at Glasgow Print Studio. Rae's palette changed considerably when in 1985 she first visited Santa Fe in New Mexico. Up till then most of her landscapes were rather sombre. One can readily see the in- fluences of Keith Vaughan, of Graham Sutherland of the 1940s and of Paul Nash, all of which she acknowledged. Also important for her, perhaps, were the landscapes of Sir William Gillies, Principal at Edinburgh College of Art when she was a student. Parallels with her work include the high horizons of most compositions. Rae began making mono- types with Ron Pokrasso at Timberwick on the outskirts of Santa Fe, working alongside the abstract artist Reg Loving. Like Loving, she began to cut up manila folders to make col- lages of overlapping shapes. Her colours very quickly became much more intense and brilliant. Rae again worked with Pokrasso in Florence in 2001, when she made a series of plates combining solarplate etching, monotype and chine collé around the central image of a Giotto Madonna and Child. She has returned to make prints in Santa Fe on two further occa- sions. Back in Scotland, Rae was at the forefront of the surge in monotype printmaking at Glasgow Print Studio, where the workshop manager, John Mackechnie, had previously worked on monotypes only with Bruce McLean. Since 2000 she has made many monotypes in her own studios in Edinburgh and Los Angeles. In 2002 she shipped a Takach etching press all the way from Albuquerque to Edinburgh to facilitate their production. Rae's purples, mauves, yellows and reds bring to mind the paintings of Craigie Aitchison and William Crozier. Some- times her prints - as for instance her monotypes of 2000 made in the Belfast Print Studio - show a similar approach to imagery to that employed by Alan Davie when he drew on ancient Carib sources. Rae has found inspiration in the Anas- tazi carvings that she encountered in New Mexico and Ari- zona. The deserts there, in Nevada and California and in the sunburnt lands of Spain, Tuscany and South Africa have re- peatedly provided the material for her landscape prints. In 1998 she made a series of etchings and monotypes on the sub- ject of the Mexican Day of the Dead. More locally, she has long been an admirer of the sculptor and printmaker, Will Maclean, and one cannot help feeling that her prints of cod and small fishing vessels framed in box-like shapes are a trib- ute to this West Highland artist. From time to time one can also sense her memory of the work of the Glasgow-based master screenprinter, John Taylor. Rae has made prints at Inverness at Highland Printmakers Workshop, where she met the English artist, Michael Rand, with whom she subsequently etched in his studio at Strathy on the remote north coast of Sutherland. She began her time at Edinburgh Printmakers by creating etchings and litho- graphs, but found that working with Carol Robertson on water-based screenprinting better suited her talents. She has continued her partnership with her at Graal Press, the print- making studio set up by Robertson and Robert Adam, former Director of Edinburgh Printmakers, in the village of Roslin on the Esk south of Edinburgh. In Ireland, James O'Nolan, the Artistic Director of Dublin's Graphic Studio, introduced Rae to carborundum etching, and almost a decade later she began working with him on photopolymer plates at Stoney Road Press, which O'Nolan had opened elsewhere in the Irish capital in 2002. North of the border, Rae has worked at the Belfast Print Studio with Struan Hamilton, who had learnt viscosity printmaking from Hector Saunier at Atelier Contrepoint in Paris. The list of studios and workshops at which she has worked is completed by London's Coriander Studio, where she made a number of screenprints in 2008. Wherever she has gone, Rae has deliberately chosen to make the best of the specialities on offer at a particular studio, while maintaining the integrity of her artistic aims. MARTIN HOP- KINSON KIKIE CRÊVECOEUR. In Prìnt Quarterly, XXIV, 2007, pp. 307-08 I discussed Kikie Crêvecoeur's indiarubber prints, but more recently this Brussels artist has turned to linocut. Some of her latest prints were presented recently in Liège at that city's Cabinet des Estampes et Dessins as part of the 7ème Biennale Internationale de Gravure Contemporaine. This show was accompanied by the catalogue, Kikie Crêvecoeur Trans (e)mutations estampes (Cabinet des estampes et des dessins de la ville de Liège, Liège, 2010, 32 pp., 18 col. and 20 b. &amp; w. ills., €4), with contributions from Michèle Minne, Eddy De- volder, Michel Barzin, and Esther Delvin and Luc Dethier in a joint poem. This little publication also includes a record of her eight livres d'artiste, her filmography and radiophonie, as well as a list of her previous exhibitions. Since 2008 all refer- ence to figuration has disappeared in a long series of prints entitled Je, tu, il, nous, vous, elles .... She has also worked on PRINT QUARTERLY, XXVII, 2010, 4</page><page sequence="37">NOTES 437 woven textiles with Eddy Devolder, an artist who has made brush drawings in Chinese ink that belong to a similar aes- thetic to hers, the results being a combination of the two styles. Crêvecoeur's own works are either closely packed com- positions of small black dots (points) or overlapping dots in grey and black on a light blue background or green, red and sometimes orange on an yellow background. MARTIN HOP- KINSON PRINTMAKING IN MODENA. In 1979 two young stu- dents, who had recently graduated from the Istituto d'Arte Venturi, opened a printmaking workshop in Modena. The publication Laboratorio d'Arte Grafica di Modena : I trenť anni del laboratorio igyg-200g (Modena, Laboratorio d'Arte Grafica, 2009, 64 pp., 84 col. and 17 b. &amp; w. ills.), to which seventeen artists and critics contributed, was issued to coincide with the exhibition 'I libri dei Gatti', which presented twenty of the Laboratorio's livres d'artiste in the city's Biblioteca Poletti. Two blind prints form the cover of this book, in which the illus- trations provide rather more information than the texts. The husband-and-wife partnership of Roberto Gatti and Anna Maria Piccinini has worked with 112 artists over the thirty years of the studio's existence. Prints made on its premises have been published by Stamparte, Il Cerchio, Editalia, Skira, Alan Cristea and others. Roberto Gatti himself published quite a number of prints, including work by Mimmo Pal- adino and Joe Tilson. Although most of the other artists who have worked at the Modena studio are little known outside Italy, one can see here prints by Piero Dorazio, Roberto Stel- luti, Omar Galliani and Luigi Veronesi. Enrico della Torre is another to have made work there, but his work is not illus- trated. Paladino's collaboration with Gatti and Piccinini on livres d'artiste stands out as the most significant in the history of the Laboratorio to date. MARTIN HOPKINSON ART FOR LIFE'S SAKE. Paper Politics: Socially Engaging Printmaking Today ; edited by Josh Macphee (Oakland, CA, PM Press, 2009, 160 pp., 202 col. and 26 b. &amp; w. ills., £24.95), began as an exhibition and has turned into a book. The proj- ect started out as a fundraising event held in the offices of the Chicago-based investigative magazine, In These Times (www.inthesetimes.com). Around 50 artists contributed prints that were sold to support a graffiti and poster group (Street Art Workers). Promotion by the magazine and invitations from galleries, resulted in an expanded show that toured to eleven venues during 2004-09. Throughout this project the organizers' sought to bring together a disparate community of politically motivated artists and to extend the scope of their audience beyond those who might encounter their art- works in the street. The exhibition and book are, in Macphee's words, a 'messy aggregate . . . the beginnings of an aesthetic conver- sation about what is wrong with the world we inhabit and what a new society we want to live in might look like'. Inter- preted literally, this world will be egalitarian, crafted by hand, and lacking historical insight. Containing around 200 full colour illustrations, four short essays, eleven artists' commentaries and notes on all the par- ticipating artists, Politics and Paper provides a comprehensive snap shot of the cream of politically motivated printmakers' responses to contemporary issues; from wars abroad to strug- gles at home. What it fails to provide is an understanding of the contexts in which these works were made, or the social consequences of their production. Macphee's opening edi- torial remarks: 'Every print in this book was printed by human hands . . . They can't compete with billboards or bus ads, never mind television or the Internet. Yet these print- making methods remain vital, maybe even because of their anachronistic existence', sets the tone for many of the artists' commentaries, which tell us more about each artist's affection for their chosen media than the affect of their artwork on the causes espoused. Consequently the reader is unable to distin- guish between prints made in small numbers and distributed to a handful of associates, from works produced in large quantities contributing significantly to campaigns. In a gallery, or between the pages of a book promoting 'politically motivated imagery', this distinction may not appear to be im- portant, but in the world of political engagement and for any analysis of efficacy, it is essential. The book's weakest contribution is Deborah Caplow's essay, 'Political Art and Printmaking: A Brief and Partial His- tory'. Caplow derails the editor's stated intention 'to write about the history of political printmaking' by her failure to adequately engage with the subject and by leading the reader into a cul-de-sac regurgitation of the most obvious politically motivated suspects: Goya, Daumier, Manet, Kollwitz, Dix, Grosz, Heartfield, Picasso, Rivera, et al. Mexico's Taller de Grafica Popular, Lu Xun, and the Russian avant-garde are mentioned briefly, but much of this history, from the English satirical print to the International Situationist strategy of dé- tournement, which underscores the Subvertising Movement, is consigned to oblivion. Quoi? Atelier Populaire. Distracted by the art world's magnates, Caplow fails to consider the significant shifts in 'new left' sensibilities that took place during the second half of the twentieth century Disillusioned by the evident oppression of socialist regimes, many activists turned to 'the revolution of everyday life'. They worked to transform run-down inner city neighbour- hoods and sought to recreate communities. They fought for gender and race equality. They opposed homophobia through empathy, and generally sought to overturn the shared regimented 'Calvinisť mentalities of communism and capi- talism through a hedonistic cocktail of sex, drugs and rock and roll, spiced with radical political theory It is within this milieu that the artists featured in Paper Politics would be better explored. The hand-crafted object is not the only manifestation of politically motivated print-making active today. During the protests against the Iraq and Afghan wars many Internet sites sprang up spontaneously to facilitate the uploading and cyber-distribution of oppositional graphics. Likewise, groups such as Adbusters publish magazines and advocate the de- railment of consumerism, albeit via an aesthetic that is vir- tually indistinguishable from the products of the Mammon they oppose. What distinguishes the artists featured in this book is a 'small is beautiful' ethic that, in the face of corporate advertising, presents its message on a humanized scale. To some this might appear naive or quaint. But as an effective political strategy it is not entirely without precedent. In the mid-1960s a group of Swedish liberals clubbed together to send a couple of young graduate art students to Zulu Natal to help the locals (somehow). What emerged over the follow- PRINT QUARTERLY, XXVII, 2010, 4</page><page sequence="38">438 NOTES ing decades was the training of a generation of black artists at the mission school at Rorke's Drift. Within the stultifying environment of apartheid, armed with nothing more than lino prints, some of these artists gained international recog- nition and their crude hand-made graphics became a pow- erful force for change. What distinguishes the Rorke's Drift School from much of the work contained in Paper Politics is the fact that the South Africans had no other viable media at their disposal. JOHN PHILLIPS ART, MODERNITY AND CHAOS. The publication by Lutz Becker, Modern Times: Responding to Chaos (Cambridge, UK, Kettle's Yard, 16 January-14 March 2010, Bexhill-on- Sea, De La Warr Pavilion, 1 April-13 June 2010, Cambridge, UK, Kettle s Yard, 2010, 120 pp., 95 col., and 17 b. &amp; w. ills., £12.95), accompanied an exhibition that was the first of a se- ries presenting individual journeys through the art of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Here the film-maker Lutz Becker offers an insightful selection of drawings, prints and films that both make connections across time and stress the fractured nature of recent history. The choice of work demonstrates the curator's filmic vision: 'Drawings are traces of time and thought. It is the awareness of time as the meas- ure of the distance between thought and realisation, of the value of the transient and sense of the fragility of the inspi- rational moment that made me decide to show in this exhi- bition predominantly works on paper.' This sense of time and movement, reflected in the particular works selected and in the sensitivity with which the show was orchestrated, made this an exhibition to be relished and savoured. In the telling juxtapositions of works across different pe- riods of time, Otto Dix's Lament , of 19 15, next to Lothar Fisher's Untitled , of 1970; Ben Nicholson's St Remy, Provence , 1933, next to Donald Judd's Untitled , 1978, Becker challenges a singular linear reading of history. In addition, again and again remarkable works are put together to the benefit of each, repeatedly stressing the immediacy of drawing and the physicality of the mark on paper. Prints are well represented in the exhibition but are concealed in the catalogue under the heading of drawings - a beautiful Fontana, Quattro litografie, and Serra's etching Weight and Measure , to name but two. The catalogue is an excellent document with essays from the curator, as well as from Nick Wadley and David Elliot and an architectural view by Iain Boyd White. PAUL COLDWELL CONTEMPORARY PRINTS IN KENT. For the last four years, history of art students at Kent University have re- searched and curated an exhibition of prints on a seemingly impossibly small budget, £2,500 for everything. The resulting exhibition and catalogue, Krìkey! Kentemporary Prints: Kent Print Collection 4th Exhibition 2010, edited by Patricia Chan (Canter- bury, Studio 3 Gallery, Jar man Building, 10 May~4june 2010, Canterbury, University of Kent School of Arts, 2010, 48 pp., 29 col., and 17 b. &amp; w. ills., £2.50), represents a refreshing and optimistic approach to the problem, an example of how in- genuity and enthusiasm can overcome lack of financial re- sources. It is easy to see from the liveliness of the writing how these students won over the artists and their galleries into sup- porting their project: 'The idea of celebrating printmakers who have a connection to Kent was like a fire that engulfed a forest. Every aspect had been set alight'. The catalogue includes a brief essay in which the students explain their enterprise, showing how the idea of the Kent connection developed and became a thread to connect the works. They describe how through a web of relationships, serendipity and research the exhibition evolved. The students also explore Kent in terms of artistic associations revealing amongst other facts how Duchamp produced four drawings in preparation for The Large Glass when visiting Herne Bay, how Samuel Palmer took Shoreham as his inspiration and how Van Gogh drew in Ramsgate en route to London. The artists in the exhibition represent an impressive list of contemporary stars, including Michael Craig-Martin, Gary Hume and Ian Davenport. Signature works by each are accompanied by short biographies and notes on the works se- lected. My only reservation lies in the miniscule reproduc- tions, barely the size of postage stamps, but on such a tight budget, something had to give. PAUL COLDWELL LINO MANNOCCI. In Lino Mannocci's introduction to the exhibition catalogue, The Angel and the Virgin: A Brief History of the Annunciation (Cambridge, UK, Fitzwilliam Museum, 9 February-9 May 2010, 48 pp., 31 col. ills., £5.99), he writes: 'I find the core of this story, the mystery of the Incarnation, the possibility of embedding matter with aesthetic or spiritual value, an irresistible metaphor for the activity of painting.' For a contemporary artist it is actually rather a radical statement, acknowledging both the intent to make images that connect the material to the spiritual and presupposing in a secular world that we are still able to read the echoes of narratives contained in the pictorial symbols that once made artists, alongside preachers, the most powerful advocates of the developing Christian Church. The conjunction of three recent exhibitions and their ac- companying publications reveal the complexity and depth of Mannocci's aims, providing an important opportunity to ex- amine the artist's sources alongside his original works, where leitmotifs recur across the boundaries of different mediums and the borrowings and mixings of metaphors build to create images that are individual, poignant and psychologically charged. In The Angel and the Virgin Mannocci traces how artists took the elements of the gospel stories and made them explicable in imagery, depicting the Visitation of the angel Gabriel, the transference of God's child to the Virgin's body through ce- lestial beams, her chastity reflected as a glass vase, a lily flower or walled garden and how through the centuries theological developments shaped the form and symbolism of such im- ages. In his own work we see how a secular artist takes these stories and transmutes them, 'making what we see appear lost scenes from a known drama' (David Cohen, Lino Mannocci: Sea Sky Smoke , New York 2009). Mannocci's compositions are imbued with the mystique of narrative but are left open ended, resonant with meaning but resistant to exact defini- tion. For many years Mannocci supported his practice as an artist by dealing in Old Master prints, and he is a highly re- spected expert on the work of Claude Lorrain, authoring the catalogue raisonné published by Yale in 1988. Invited to select an exhibition from the permanent collection at the Fitzwilliam Museum that would run concurrently with a show of his own monotypes he chose to revisit the theme of PRINT QUARTERLY, XXVII, 20 IO, 4</page><page sequence="39">NOTES 439 234. Lino Mannocci, Susanna the Daughter of Hilkiah , 2008, monotype, 200 x 220 mm (London, private collection). the Annunciation, a subject he has explored in his work for over twenty years. Mannocci states rather self-deprecatingly that he is used to examining the surfaces of historic prints for the minute scratches and marks that differentiate when and by whom an image has been made, but an acute attention to the surface substance that forms a printed image is repaid not only in his own process but also in the perceptive comments that Craig Hartley brings in his examination of Mannocci's monotypes in the publication Clouds and Myths (Cambridge, UK 2010). Hartiey's analysis of the techniques by which these mono- types are made makes this a valuable text both in relation to Mannocci and in its advocacy of how fluent and expressive the print medium can be in the hands of an original artist. Mannocci's monotypes 'borrow' figures and themes from a wide variety of sources that include nineteenth-century soft PRINT QUARTERLY, XXVII, 20I0, 4</page><page sequence="40">440 NOTES porn postcards, newsprint photos of Rodin's studio, the Capi- toline Venus, as well as referencing more directly paintings such as Domenico Veneziano 's The Annunciation (c. 1442-48), which was included in his selection for the Fitzwilliam exhi- bition. Working on etching plates, Mannocci utilizes stencils, chine collé , light and dark field inkings and in many instances favours an open-bite application of acid, so that the images are suggested as much through mottled texture as by etched line. Hartley is very good at revealing Mannocci's sublimation of technique to purpose - Susanna the Daughter of Hilkiah (fig 234), a pale grey, second-state impression of a mermaid-like figure, is encroached upon by seven black marks where he has added liquid ink with a brush to the drying surface of the plate. The rich blackness of the marks agitate and intrude on the vulnerable figure, the whole scene lit by a luminous moon, created by a drop of turpentine. 'Because of the two levels of inking, the dense black marks seem to come from another world, heightening the sense of alien threat to the figure: we could see them as suggesting the crude assault of the Elders on Susanna's innocence.' Elsewhere Hartley draws our attention to the platemark, either consciously inked to give physical presence to the image, or left uninked so that the pictorial elements exist somehow isolated and surreal. The use of stencils and cut- outs enable the same figures to be repeated and quoted in dif- ferent contexts, creating shifts and ambiguities of identity within the narratives that Mannocci hints at. The print ...che non è bruto, ne uomo, ne tantomeno Dio , for example, combines a number of elements, brushed ink marks and an open-bite fig- ure, all starkly isolated against an uncoloured ground. A pale pink nude derived from a soft porn postcard, printed as an inkjet and embedded as a chine collé into the surface of the paper, kneels before a looming male figure, covering herself modestly. The pose suggests a Venus Pudica and shares with other of the monotypes hints of the myth of Apollo and Daphne, yet in the uppermost part of the empty picture plane, an open-bite mark, like a disembodied head, calls to mind the many celestial auras that dominate the Annuncia- tion images. Even when directly referencing the traditional iconography of the Veneziano predella panels, Mannocci substitutes for the Virgin the figure of the grieving mother, reflecting the tradition in Christian art to link the conception of Christ with His ultimate suffering. In this artist's hands it is an image that is both human and humane. Mannocci's slow-build layering of myth, symbol and al- legory is distinctive but never didactic. The works that trav- elled to America for the 'Sea Sky Smoke' exhibition included paintings, monotypes and over-painted postcards, revealing familiar themes of pregnant seas, illusive mists and visiting angels, each image distinctively responsive to its own medium. Highly sophisticated in their referencing of tradi- tions in art and other artists, these enigmatic works are ulti- mately less defined by what they portray than by their effects. If one were to settle on a single image to act as a metaphor for Mannocci's art it would be a cloud - light and open, pro- voking a sense of wonderment. EMMA HILL</page></plain_text>
