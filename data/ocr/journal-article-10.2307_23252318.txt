Digitalization has combined with expanding science to address this complexity, creating new ways to measure, analyze, and model chemical compounds, diseases, and human biology. We interviewed 85 scientists and managers working on drug discovery to understand how they deal with complexity. We find a major knowledge fault line between digital scientists, who use computers as laboratories and manipulate signs, and therapy scientists, who use conventional laboratories and manipulate physical material. We build on research on epistemic cultures and knowing in practice to develop empirically grounded theory for the role of digital science in complex innovation. We propose that digitalization creates a new form of knowledge that provides essential complementary insights for complex innovation that cannot exist otherwise. However, digitalization also creates new knowledge boundaries that concern central activities of innovation. These boundaries highlight challenges of complex innovation that digital sciences can help address, but only if the innovation activities are transformed so that digital and therapy sciences can integrate their complementary knowledge.

Introduction Drug discovery is truly complex innovation. It is char acterized by nonlinearity, unpredictable interdependen ces, and the emergence of knowledge over long periods of time, as innovators search the "unknown unknowns" of human biology to discover drug therapies for unmet medical needs (March 1991, Pisano 2006, Simon 1996, Van de Ven et al. 1999). To address this complex ity, scientific advances have been interwoven with digitalization. Digital technologies have poured into drug discovery to, for example, speed up tedious bench sci ence, enable "rational" drug design, screen hundreds of thousands of compounds against targets, and examine how genes interact around a disease (Ng 2004, Northrup 2005). So far, however, digital technologies have done little to enhance drug discovery (U.S. Food and Drug Administration 2004). Industry experts estimate that less than 10% of the data from digital technologies are used, and drug discovery suffers from huge data overloads and bottlenecks (Luther 2009). Critics suggest that the industry has "become high throughput in technology, yet [has] remained low throughput in thinking" (Patwardhan et al. 2008). The cost of bringing a new drug to mar ket has grown from an average of $230 million in 1987 to one of $1.2 billion in 2008, largely as a result of spending on digital technologies. Yet the number of new drug approvals is at best constant, and some argue it is steadily declining (Wishart 2008). How can so much vital new knowledge not lead directly to the discovery of new drugs? We interviewed 85 scientists and managers engaged in drug discovery from a variety of different firms to understand how they deal with the challenges of complexity. From the beginning of data collection, we were surprised to see a major fault line between scientists who work in tra ditional laboratories by manipulating physical material and scientists who work on computers by manipulating digital signs. Each group of scientists deals with com plexity differently by focusing on distinct facets, gen erating separate data, and going in diverse directions. We realized that complexity generates a need for new knowledge, and digitalization of sciences creates this new knowledge. By digitalization of science, we refer to the generation of scientific knowledge that would not be possible without digital technologies, such as bioinfor matics, metabolomics, or genomics. Digitalization goes beyond the technical process of encoding information in digital format and involves organizing new sociotechni cal structures (e.g., science) with digitized artifacts (Yoo et al. 2010b). However, the vast amounts of information from digitalization cannot simply be dumped into the innovation process. Complexity also generates the need 1467</page><page sequence="2">Dougherty and Dunne: Digital Science and Knowledge Boundaries in Complex Innovation 1468 Organization Science 23(5), pp. 1467-1484, ©2012 INFORMS to transform innovation activities themselves in order to integrate digital sciences into the innovation process. Our research question is, how can these digital sciences contribute effectively to complex product innovation? Product innovation involves the cre ation, combination, and recombination of knowledge (Leonard-Barton 1995), so it is necessary to manage knowledge across various boundaries (Carlile 2004). We draw on the literature and our own analysis to under stand how digital sciences provide essential knowledge for complex innovation. We build on theory of know ing in practice to understand the nature of knowledge boundaries in complex innovation and how these bound aries can be bridged (Bechky 2003, Carlile 2004, Knorr Cetina 1999, Levina and Vaast 2005). The outcome of this analysis is a grounded theory for the role of the digitalization of science in complex innovation and the transformations in innovation activities that are neces sary to enable digitalization to play that role. This study contributes to practice by explaining how to integrate the influx of digital knowledge into drug discovery. This study contributes to theory by explicating a new role for digitalization in complex innovation and by explaining how to enhance innovation management so that digital sciences can help address complexity. In the next section, we summarize challenges that complexity poses for product innovation, and we explain how pharmaceutical innovation is complex. Then, we describe the two groups of drug discovery scientists we find to be in conflict, outline the various types of digi tal science in drug discovery, and explain features that enable digital sciences to generate new knowledge. We then draw on the knowing in practice perspective to frame our analysis of the fault line between the therapy and digital sciences. Conceptual Background: Complexity and Digital Sciences Complexity and Pharmaceutical Innovation Complex systems are made up of a large number of parts that have many interactions (Simon 1996). Complex ity raises major challenges that cannot be handled with conventional innovation management activities, because these assume that feasibility is established and that prob lems are defined well enough that solutions can be found and evaluated (e.g., Cooper 1998, Ulrich and Eppinger 2000). In complex systems, all the parts interact unpre dictably, because relations between cause and effect are not understood. The problems of complex innovation go beyond computational complexity (Simon 1996) that involves calculating many interactions among known alternate moves and parameters for evaluating them. Complex systems involve what Grandori (2010) calls "Knightian" or epistemic uncertainty, in which relevant alternate moves and parameters are unknown and thus cannot be calculated. Likewise, Snowden and Boone (2007) argue that in complicated contexts, knowledge of cause and effect exists such that right answers can be fer reted out by experts. In complex contexts, however, right answers cannot be ferreted out and must be allowed to emerge. Conventional innovation activities also presume that product architectures with defined interfaces exist, so innovators focus on new components. In complex systems there are no architectures or defined interfaces, and each product is a unique configuration of interde pendent parts. Finally, conventional innovation activities are based on a linear, step-by-step development process. Complex innovations are nonlinear, so small changes in a product's design can have huge and surprising effects on product functionality. Despite these enormous risks, many pressing needs for innovation involve complexity, including alternative energy systems, new materials, poverty, and sustain ability. The discovery of new drugs for unmet med ical conditions is one of these socially desirable but complex innovation processes. The human body is a complex adaptive system that includes up 25,000 genes that produce millions of proteins that can change over time (Pisano 2006). Many diseases involve multiple pathways, genes, proteins, and cell types, which inter act in unpredictable ways. Moreover, there are millions of possible chemical entities that can become drugs (Nightingale 1998). The human population also varies a great deal, which is why advances in sequencing the human genome have had little effect on medicine so far. The assumption was that a limited number of com mon genetic variants underlie diseases, but it seems now that even common heritable diseases are linked to many different genetic variants, each relatively rare (Singer 2009). In complicated innovation such as avia tion (Northrup 2005), automobile design (Carlile 2004), or semiconductors (Pisano 2006), large bodies of knowl edge enable people to accurately simulate the variables and interactions that are involved. This is not so for drug discovery, because "what is not understood about the human body and how it functions is far greater than what is understood" (Northrup 2005, p. 70). Sciences in Drug Discovery Drug discovery, therefore, cannot rely on blind search. It relies on sciences that frame plausible domains for searching, and drug discovery programs involve hun dreds of scientists from scores of disciplines (Pisano 2006). Our analysis focuses on two broad groups of sci entists: "therapy scientists" who work in teams of 30-50 chemists and biologists on a particular disease area, and "digital scientists" who work in specialty groups to sup port a variety of therapy teams. Therapy Scientists. Some of the scientists we inter viewed do their drug discovery work in a conventional</page><page sequence="3">Dougherty and Dunne: Digital Science and Knowledge Boundaries in Complex Innovation Organization Science 23(5), pp. 1467-1484, ©2012 INFORMS 1469 "wet lab" or "under the hood," using physical samples of proteins, cell cultures, chemical compounds, and lab animals to experiment in vitro and in vivo, interpret results, and develop new hypotheses. These scientists work in ways that are similar to the academic microbi ologists described by Knorr-Cetina (1999); they operate with a technology of treatments and interventions and work hands-on by manipulating, visually inspecting, and getting a feel for their object of study. We call these the "therapy scientists," because in this innovation context, these scientists work in multi-science teams centered on therapeutic or disease areas. Digital Scientists. Other scientists that we interviewed do their drug discovery work on computers and other digital technologies, using databases, digital signs, and models to experiment in silico. We label these the "dig ital scientists," because computers and other digitalized technologies are their laboratories. Similar to the high energy physicists described by Knorr-Cetina (1999), dig ital scientists operate with a technology of representation (not of treatments and intervention); rely on signs about the object of study rather than on material objects; and emphasize measuring, analyzing, and transforming data. Over the past 35 years, advances in many sciences related to drug discovery have generated increasingly efficient and sophisticated tools and methods (Northrup 2005). These tools and methods expand the number and range of compounds that can be synthesized and tested, the amounts and types of proteins that can be generated and tested, and knowledge of diseases (Pisano 2006). The appendix relates some digital sciences to activi ties in drug development, indicating that many of them are used throughout. The lower arrow details discovery activities that comprise the first 6 years of a 12-year innovation process. For example, computational chemistry combines medicinal chemistry with algorithms for assembling organic compounds to generate many virtual com pounds used for in silico experiments. The digital sci ence of bioinformatics was originally designed to carry out computational work needed for DNA sequencing, but it has evolved to apply computer algorithms to mine enormous databases (the European inventory of gene sequences contains 5,000 terabytes of data; see Southan and Cameron 2009). The digital science of metabolomics carries out high-throughput identification and quantification of small-molecule metabolites that arise from the interactions of macromolecules in cells (e.g., DNA, RNA). Metabolomics combines high-field nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy with high-resolution mass spectrometry to analyze an organ ism's physiology (Wishart 2008). Genomics uses many digital technologies to examine DNA sequences and gene functions to understand possible genetic causes of diseases and to find new avenues for intervention. See Barry (2005), Burns (2005), Ng (2004), Pisano (2006), and Yang and Kim (2008) for descriptions of digital sci ences in drug innovation. Digital Science as Knowledge. The digitalization of science does more than generate tools and techniques. Like digital technologies in radiology (Barley 1986) or architecture and construction (Boland et al. 2007), the digitalization of science has changed how people work together. We extend this line of research to suggest that digitalization also generates insights that are not other wise possible, enabling scientists to see new kinds of drug possibilities. Three features turn digital technolo gies into what we call digital science, a type of science that leverages these tools to understand new kinds of patterns in nature. One feature of digitalization that can lead to new knowledge is the ability to map out whole new terrains of human biology and see more dimensions of subsystems in the body. Computational power coupled with scientific advances generates new patterns to explore and new ways to explore them. Second, digitalization enables the scien tists to peer deeply into the functioning of cells, cell pathways, neurons, and other mechanisms that deter mine diseases but that cannot be seen by the naked eye. Third, digitalization enables scientists to simulate com plex biological processes even if they cannot capture all of the functioning as a result of limited knowledge. For example, synthetic biology creates models from many databases to identify specific disease mechanisms, whereas systems biology integrates knowledge from genomics, proteomics, cell biology, chemistry, physics, mathematics, and computer science to study the behav ior of complex biological systems. Despite the obvious benefits of these digital sci ences for drug innovation, there are several reasons why they are not readily integrated into the process. First, most continue to evolve rapidly and are still immature. Genomics, for example, although seemingly well devel oped over the past 20 years, has led to few new cures so far because of the unimagined complexity, and some suggest it has been overhyped (Cohen 2011). Second, Sammut (2005) and Pisano (2006) suggest that many digital sciences were implemented at first simply as tools, not as new knowledge that needed to be integrated with other knowledge. These new tools were expected to replace, not complement, therapy science, which would generate conflicts between the two groups. Digital sci ences were injected into discrete steps of the existing innovation process because it was assumed that screen ing many more proteins and molecules more quickly would result in more drugs. Because the number of new drugs has not increased, this assumption seems incor rect. Third, the complexity must be addressed rather than avoided, which means that the overall process of inno vation may need to transform. Each tool sheds light on</page><page sequence="4">Dougherty and Dunne: Digital Science and Knowledge Boundaries in Complex Innovation 1470 Organization Science 23(5), pp. 1467-1484, ©2012 INFORMS just a piece of a very complex puzzle, but together, the tools dramatically expand the landscape for drug devel opment (Pisano 2006, p. 39). Unless all these pieces come together, the landscape may fragment into isolated islands of expertise. Industry participants now realize that they need to integrate all the sciences more effec tively, but how to do so remains poorly defined. Science as Knowing in Practice, and Discontinuities in Practice as Knowledge Boundaries Insights from knowing in practice theories help to frame the problems with integrating digital sciences into the drug discovery process. Rather than thinking of knowl edge as a thing to be possessed and exchanged, many scholars suggest that knowledge is better understood as an ongoing process that is embedded in what peo ple do in their work (Orlikowski 2002). Knowledge is situated in everyday practices and in particular social and physical circumstances, and it emerges as people interactively engage in the world (Lave and Wenger 1991, Suchman 1987). In our case, knowledge is situ ated in the social practices of innovation (Bechky 2003, Dougherty 1992). Science as knowing in practice is fur ther situated in epistemic cultures that are based on dis tinct machineries for creating, warranting, and validating knowledge (Knorr-Cetina 1999). Scientists draw heavily on a learned tacit background of knowledge that pro vides a "constellation of beliefs, values, techniques, and methods that are shared by a community of practition ers" (Turro 1986, p. 886; quoted in Nightingale 1998, p. 692). This machinery of knowing enables scientists to recognize and understand patterns in nature, to extrap olate and codify those patterns (Nightingale 1998), and to also apply these new understandings to drug products (Pisano 2006). However, different sciences have profoundly differ ent machineries of knowing, which lead to very dif ferent practices for approaching problems, analyzing results, and making sense. Knorr-Cetina's (1999) distinc tion between scientists who manipulate physical objects and scientists who manipulate signs fits our problem. Her discussion of the genome project also highlights possible differences in practice between the therapy and digital sciences in drug discovery. The then unfinished genome project was microbiology's first big-science project. Genomics experts, akin to our digital scientists, envisioned that the genome project would bring about a paradigm shift from small-scale benchwork to a theo retical science that manipulates masses of sequence data rather than biological samples and reagents. But when Knorr-Cetina asked microbiologists, akin to our therapy scientists, what they thought about the genome project, many felt that it was not particularly exciting. In their opinion, "[KJnowing the genetic maps would not provide direct answers to any of today's burning questions.... The concrete significance of these data would have to be investigated step by step in regular bench laborato ries" (Knorr-Cetina 1999, p. 82). Like divergent thought worlds found in other innovations (Dougherty 1992), we expect that digital and therapy scientists not only know different things but also know things differently. Discontinuities in the practices of knowing are boundaries (Levina and Vaast 2005), so to use digital sciences effectively, it is necessary to span the bound aries between therapy science and digital science. Carlile (2004) argues that when there are significant differ ences in knowledge but strong dependencies between the groups, boundaries are likely to be "pragmatic," which highlights the need to alter knowledge on either side and enable each group to influence or transform knowledge used by the other. Because people are invested in their own knowledge, they find it costly to change it and are not only reluctant to change but have no easy means to do so. Novelty exacerbates these problems. The fault line we find between the digital and therapy sciences is likely to comprise pragmatic boundaries. Knowledge at prag matic boundaries needs transformation, which occurs when members of one community come to understand how knowledge from another community fits within the context of their own work, enriching and altering what they know (Bechky 2003). To enable transformation, Bechky argues that groups need to cocreate a common ground using boundary objects such as computer-aided design models, prototypes, and other artifacts. She finds that boundary objects cannot help unless they invoke the differences in the work context. When people cannot create tangible definitions of their problems, bridging boundaries will be very difficult. How to create a "common ground" between the digi tal and therapy sciences in complex innovation is espe cially problematic because this setting magnifies the challenges of boundary spanning described above. The partial knowledge in complex innovation means that there are no simulations, prototypes, or other tangi ble artifacts that can serve readily as boundary objects. The separation of interests between the groups of scien tists, who are deeply invested in their distinct machiner ies of knowing, makes it difficult for them to develop intangible representations of differences. To understand how digital science can contribute effectively to com plex innovation such as drug discovery, we first need to understand the nature of the boundaries between digi tal and therapy sciences, so we ask the following: What constitutes the discontinuities of practice between the two groups of scientists? To identify the core differences between the two groups, we then ask the following ques tion: How do the scientists on either side carry out their innovation work? Finally, to understand possible com mon grounds that can transform innovation activities and enable integration, we ask the following question: How are the scientists trying to overcome these differences?</page><page sequence="5">Dougherty and Dunne: Digital Science and Knowledge Boundaries in Complex Innovation Organization Science 23(5), pp. 1467-1484, ©2012 INFORMS 1471 Methods We interviewed 85 scientists and managers who are engaged in drug discovery from a variety of large phar maceutical firms and small biotechnology firms. These interviews and our analysis focus on the drug discovery process in general. Drug discovery is the first 6 years of a 12-year process, going from initial discovery to phase IIB of clinical trials, or proof of concept (i.e., the molecule is safe and has activity against disease in small samples of healthy people). Digital sciences are also used in the ensuing six years when large-scale clin ical trials are run, but we cannot address whether similar boundaries operate between the scientists who work on these later phases of drug development. We first outline the interviewing process and then describe the data anal yses we used to develop empirically grounded theory. We used methods described by Strauss (1987), Strauss and Corbin (1998), and Dougherty (2002). Data Collection. Of the 85 interviews, 80 were car ried out by the authors, and 5 were carried out by colleagues from another innovation project in which researchers followed roughly the same format. Seventy nine interviews were held at the person's work site, and six were held over the phone. All interviews aver aged about an hour. The interviews were taped (when allowed) and transcribed; otherwise, detailed notes were taken. Interviewees came from various levels and ther apy and digital specialties, as outlined in Table 1. All but three had a Ph.D. Forty-three of the people interviewed worked on or with therapy teams or on preclinical devel opment, or they supervised the scientists. Twenty-three interviewees worked on digital sciences; of these, 7 had Table 1 People Interviewed Distinguished by Knowledge Area and Level Level of Therapy Digital Business Total no. of organization scientists3 scientists'1 managers0 interviews Vice president 8 3 4 15 Director 18 9 8 35 Team leader 8 4 7 19 Team member 9 7 0 16 Total 43 23 19 85 Note.

Also includes preclinical scientists who help teams prepare compounds for clinical trials, workers in conven tional wet laboratories or under the hood, and all science directors focused on the science. Includes scientists who use digital equipment and computers to do their science (e.g., computational chemistry, high-throughput screening, bioinformatics, structural biology). includes strategic managers and planners who study R&amp;D and how it connects with business units and other downstream assets, business developers, and financial analysts. specialist degrees in digital sciences and worked in sepa rate units, 4 had therapy science backgrounds and moved to digital sciences as directors or vice presidents, and 12 had a variety of traditional degrees but concentrated on digital sciences. Nineteen worked as business develop ers or R&amp;D managers, and their interviews reflect both the therapy and digital sciences. We also interviewed 14 industry consultants for insights into the problems that affect innovation, but these are used as background. These data are limited in several important ways that affect the generalizability of our grounded theory. First, the data do not include direct observations or capture processes as they unfold over time. Second, because of access limits, the interviews are weighted to senior-level scientists, so we have little variation on age and expe rience. We cannot explore whether differences in age, the type of Ph.D. program graduated from (e.g., com putational sciences versus "traditional" sciences), pro fessional associations, and other demographics affect the boundaries we find because in our data, the digital and therapy scientists are fairly similar on these factors. Third, we did not interview lab technicians or technol ogists who operated digital equipment, although they would likely provide additional insights. Our data do, however, reflect these scientists' understandings of their practices of science and their rationales for how and why they work as they do. We use these understandings and rationales to explain differences in how digital and ther apy scientists work and how they might overcome or traverse these boundaries. The interviews focused on the process of drug dis covery in general. We asked people to describe what they do, the problems they encounter, and how they deal with ambiguity. We asked for concrete examples to keep interviewees grounded in their work, and we invited them to compare drug discovery to innovation in other industries or in academe, if they had experi ence. Our questions shifted over time as we learned, and they moved to probe additional issues. We invited interviewees to describe what they would change about the innovation system if they could, which generated more insights about this innovation system. Because the work is difficult for nonexperts to understand, we used a "cheat sheet" of scientific and technical terms, and we built up an understanding of processes over the time we collected the data. Data Analysis. We were struck from the beginning by the differences between digital and therapy scientists in how they described everyday work. We found these different descriptions across the firms, so they do not reflect firm-level differences (although future research may uncover firm differences as well). We noted that biologists differed somewhat from chemists, that some digital scientists differed from others, and that large companies differed in practices from small companies.</page><page sequence="6">Dougherty and Dunne: Digital Science and Knowledge Boundaries in Complex Innovation 1472 Organization Science 23(5), pp. 1467-1484, ©2012 INFORMS Many kinds of boundaries exist, but the knowledge boundary between digital and therapy scientists seem to be prominent in our data. Our data do not directly reflect how these knowledge boundaries arose, only how people thought of them at the time of the interviews, which took place from 2005 to 2007. However, as noted above, most of these digital sciences continued to evolve rapidly, and new digital sciences were being implemented continu ally. Implementation of digital sciences did not occur at a single point in time, but rather was (and still is) is an ongoing process. Many of our interviewees also recalled that their firms first implemented digital sciences as tools to speed up specific steps, and so they did not pay much attention to the possible existence of knowledge bound aries or integration challenges. For example, a chemistry leader said, "We thought that by sheer numbers, a gem would pop out. No, that didn't happen. Now we are smarter." According to a project manager, "They said we'll just take enough shots on goal and eventually we're going to get a good drug target. That hasn't panned out." Our findings illustrate that people recognize the need to integrate digital and therapy sciences but are struggling to do so. To get to our explanation for what the knowl edge boundaries are like and how to integrate the two sciences, we first sought to identify meaningful distinctions that define these boundaries. We identified categories that fit both groups, but these were general and descriptive; thus we looked within each group of scientists to capture each one's thought world in its own right. Using QSR (a qualitative analysis software pack age), we flagged and pulled out from the interviews peo ple's descriptions of therapy science, of digital science, and of management from a cross section of 35 interviews and a variety of the firms. This generated six analysis files: digital scientists talking about digital science, ther apy science, and business; and therapy scientists talking about these same topics. We do not use the descriptions of business in this analysis, but we do draw on their discussions of the two sciences. With these focused files, we explored and then coded what each group tried to know, how they know, and how they work. This tactic allowed us to articulate categories that fit each knowledge group. As we developed cate gories, we added interviews to make sure that people from all firms, small and large, fit into these emerging categories. Doctoral students read the focused files to see whether they saw similar distinctions and to help deepen the emerging theory. Students also read some full interviews to make sure the analyses took the interview contexts into account. This phase of the analysis led to two sets of categories that distinguished each group by the approaches they took to their work. Finally, we looked across our two sets of categories to identify common differences that theoretically captured the main patterns of conflicting perspectives and inter ests. The main conflicts concern different approaches to specific innovation activities. We developed the differences between them and looked for examples in people's stories for how they tried to overcome these differences. The examples of trying to overcome differ ences suggest transformations in the innovation activities to create common grounds to help integrate their knowl edge. We describe these findings next. Findings Our findings support the argument in our conceptual background that digital sciences generate new kinds of knowledge that can enable innovators to more effectively deal with complex domains. Digital sciences also cre ate new kinds of knowledge boundaries. To answer our first research question (what constitutes discontinuities in practice?), we find that the discontinuities of practice between the two groups of scientists are constituted not only by different practices of knowing but also by differ ent practices of using that knowledge for innovation. We find discontinuities in three innovation activities: (1) how to define the product concepts that the scientists will work on, (2) how to build the product, and (3) how to project forward to anticipate obstacles. In each section that follows, we first summarize how complexity makes conventional innovation management practices inappli cable. Then we answer the second research question (how do scientists on either side carry out this inno vation activity?) to emphasize the unique insights each has and their potentially complementary nature. Finally, we answer the last research question (how are scien tists trying to overcome these differences?) by examining examples of resolving conflicts. From those we develop ways to transform each innovation activity into create new common grounds (Bechky 2003) that enable the scientists to integrate their knowledge and overcome the challenges of complexity. Table 2 summarizes the three innovation activities, the challenges that complexity poses for each, how digital versus therapy scientists approach each activity when working separately, and finally, how to transform the activities so that digital science can integrate with ther apy science. Figure 1 illustrates the transformations of innovation activities into new common grounds that accommodate complexity. The Knowledge Boundary of Defining Product Concepts to Work on The first knowledge boundary between digital and ther apy sciences concerns the activity of defining product concepts they are working on, as well as the value propositions they seek to achieve. Innovation research emphasizes the need to articulate a "product concept" (Cooper 1998) that defines what the product is intended</page><page sequence="7">Dougherty and Dunne: Digital Science and Knowledge Boundaries in Complex Innovation Organization Science 23(5), pp. 1467-1484, © 2012 INFORMS 1473 Table 2 Innovation Activities as Knowledge Boundaries: Challenges, Digital vs. Therapy Scientists, and Transformation into Common Grounds Innovation activities Challenges complexity How digital scientists How therapy scientists Transformation of activity as knowledge boundaries poses for each activity approach activity approach activity into new common ground Defining product concepts Procedure for creating the product Projecting forward Cannot define precisely up front, no feasibility so no criteria Nonlinear, unknown interactions so no architectures Cannot define or time activities, cannot predict Define via global search of knowns: abstracted, systematic maps Modular: measuring steps as fully as possible Eliminating uncertainties, stuck in the here and now Define via local search of unknowns: realistic, local analysis of emergent process Holistic: exploring immediate interactions among steps Muddling through uncertainties, stuck in local search Define open problem space to encompass multiple alternatives Develop partial models of possible architectures Look farther out in problem space to anticipate more resistances and how to accommodate them systematically to do, how, and for whom. Clear, complete product con cepts define priorities that guide design choices over the course of the projects (Khurana and Rosenthal 1997) and provide a project guiding vision (Leonard-Barton 1995) that coordinates participants. Pharmaceutical innovators also need a product con cept to frame their work, but the complexity of drug discovery makes it difficult to define product concepts because technological feasibility cannot be established a priori, so there are no clear criteria to guide problem solving. People indicated that defining product concepts is a major challenge, as this director of digital sciences explains: Making a decision about what to work on is the most critical. [A consultant at a conference] said that everyone [in the industry] is working on the same targets, so to get away from that we work on more and more risky things. He said that 90% of people are working on the wrong things since the failure rate is so great. As he notes, people across the industry recognize the challenge of defining good product concepts because the failure rates of new drugs are so high. The digital and therapy scientists have complementary insights that can Figure 1 Transformation Product concepts Product concepts as defined by clear open problem criteria spaces A Build products by following linear processes and J hierarchical architectures Build product by developing and exploring partial models of possible architectures Project forward by stages and gates Project forward by anticipating further out in problem space, refraining models and spaces help decide what to work on, but they have divergent perspectives for how to do so. Digital scientists use global searching of large-scale analyses of genes, proteins, or compound structures to systematically map potential product opportunities, as this genomics director describes: We do DNA sequencing, lots of high-frequency DNA sequencing... so if you measure which RNA is expressed in a cell, you can see that cell stage in terms of which genes are turned on and off and how much they are turned on and how that changes with treatments.... [Pro teomics] is a kind of gene chip technology.... You can identify lots of proteins using mass spectrometry We also use a lot of genetic technologies and so we can use RNAi or short hairpin RNA; these are new technolo gies where you can turn genes off. You can take a cancer cell, and you think you have genes that have gone wrong and you can go into the cell and turn that gene off and see what happens.... If it stops growing or dies, that might be a good thing to inhibit with a drug. This quote is an example of how digital scientists decide what to work on. They combine digital sciences to map out proteins that genes express and interactions among these in cells to identify possible targets. This quote also illustrates how digital sciences create new ways of knowing to enable drug discovery. The same digital scientist emphasizes the systematic nature of their work: We do systematic things to try to really work systemat ically across every program. We work on how to under stand how we prosecute a target and all the information we need to find out on a target.... If you want your drug to be potent and selective and not hit off [a certain] target, you need to know all the close family members that you have to avoid so you have to look at [systems of genes]... for best selectivity paradigms. This quote also highlights the very systematic aspect of digital science that emphasizes getting answers and</page><page sequence="8">Dougherty and Dunne: Digital Science and Knowledge Boundaries in Complex Innovation 1474 Organization Science 23(5), pp. 1467-1484, ©2012 INFORMS optimizing the target selections process. Digital scien tists define product concepts by creating maps of the genes that indicates viable drug targets to go after or of the chemical space that indicates chemical structures that may bind with the target. Although these are only partial maps because of the complexity involved, digital scientists have a strong sense of certainty that their maps define clear product concepts. Therapy scientists develop product concepts very dif ferently. They use local searching with hands-on phys ical investigations and decide what to work on as they participate in the discovery process. They look at the immediate functioning of the life system as it actually operates, and they explore actual interactions among proteins and molecules in the cells in vitro as well as in vivo (cell cultures, animal models, humans). They do not think that the maps from digital science provide much more than a vague place to start searching, so instead, they try to get going on the discovery journey. This biol ogist at a small biotech emphasizes the idea of rolling up one's sleeves and digging in, using science as a source of vision for what to ask: You have to have enough... scientific knowledge to understand that this phenomenon investigated is... real and that you understand it a little, you know how to manipulate it a little. You don't have to have the whole picture before you start putting together.... [This is biol ogy] so you'll never get to the end, so at some point you have to judge whether you know enough to start putting together the product... . [He describes a product]: so for us to be able to do this type of analysis we needed a technological advance to allow us to collect and process the data. But the technological advance on its own is bar ren. You had to apply vision to figure out what kind of question to ask. Rather than try to get the "whole picture," he wants to jump into the innovation process and start putting a product together. He finds out about product possibili ties by working on them. He draws heavily on science as tacit, deep background knowledge (Nightingale 1998) that is a source of vision and judgment. The next two examples highlight how indeterminate drug discovery is for the therapy scientists. This biol ogist explains how a genomic technique may not shed much light on a target, in contrast to the stronger sense of certainty we get from the digital director quoted previously: There are a lot of preclinical tests we use to increase the validity of the target.... A lot of times [using these tests] you will observe the behavior you expect, and then you say you are good to go. And then you get all the way down the line, and it did not work out the way you expected. This chemist also emphasizes that digital sciences pro vide only a starting point. To him, it is the process of discovery work that uncovers the product concepts: Screening... is based on the premise that we will gener ate a lot of data, and we can therefore tolerate a relatively high error rate that are false positives or false negatives. So the idea is if you are screening 500,000 compounds, even if you are off 20 to 30 percent of the time—that is, 20 percent of the time you say a molecule is inactive and it really is, or the other way around—you are still generating way more hits than one can work with. So all you really need is a starting point. You are going to take those hits and you are going to do all kinds of things to them, and in the end they are not going to look like what you started with. Whereas digital scientists think their global maps pro vide a clear picture of what to work on, therapy scientists think the maps require extensive hands-on work, as this chemist indicates: The screens are just to give you some molecules that inter act with the target, and then you can start to modulate the target as you improve upon those hits, and that is where you really find out a lot about the target.... The screen ing feeds in, but once you get the possible molecule, then you figure out how they actually work and what you can do with them. For him and other therapy scientists, knowledge of the target emerges as they work hands-on to see how they can modulate it. This essential knowledge does not come from the digital screens. Transforming the Innovation Activity of Defining Product Concepts to Work on The major difference at this knowledge boundary arises from global but abstracted analyses of what is known versus local but realistic analyses of what is unknown. The abstract maps from digital sciences are inherently incomplete, whereas the local forays of therapy sciences into concrete possibilities are inherently limited. If these differences are not bridged, innovation work can easily go off in multiple ways along many local paths, resulting in almost random searching. An analysis of people's efforts to define their product concepts in a better way indicates moving to a mid dle ground between the global and local searching, to define a common problem space (Simon 1977). Simon points out that for some real-world problems, algorithms are unknown, so people need to select problem spaces to explore based on initial goals, constraints, and pro cesses for generating and evaluating alternatives. We find that drug discovery scientists can define their problem space based on what they think they can know and can do. This problem space does not specify proper ties or precise outcomes for the product, but it is based on rich scientific theory that generates plausible alterna tives to explore for moderating the disease. To reach this middle-ground problem space, digital sciences are pulled</page><page sequence="9">Dougherty and Dunne: Digital Science and Knowledge Boundaries in Complex Innovation Organization Science 23(5), pp. 1467-1484, ©2012 INFORMS 1475 together and "down" to focus on diseases, whereas ther apy sciences are pulled "up" to encompass a broader array of plausible interactions in the actual functioning of the life system. The maps of digital science shape the problem space, whereas the forays of therapy science flesh out the space. We find examples of pulling the digital sciences together to define problem spaces. An information tech nology (IT) director describes efforts to integrate several digital sciences to find biomarkers, which indicate that a drug has activity against a disease in the body: We are... increasing [productivity] of our early-stage pipeline in the biomarker arena, where we are trying to couple genomic data with information [from] imaging to use as a diagnostic to determine the effectiveness of a molecule in an animal or human model, or link those two major sets of data with clinical outcomes... to be able to say for this molecule, it impacts in an efficacious way this subset of a population and using that [for] part of a label for the drug. If they can then combine these digital analyses, the resulting diagnostic will apply the considerable knowl edge of digital science to the evaluation of molecules that might become drugs for particular subpopulations. Pulling digital maps together connects them to the actual functioning of the living body. Another example comes from a formulation scientist who described "technology platforms" that integrate sep arate technologies to analyze small samples for differ ent formulation challenges. Chemical compounds must be formulated to enter the body (taken orally to pass through the digestive system, injected, inhaled, etc.). Many new compounds are not soluble and cannot be absorbed, or they have other problems. Without these integrated technologies, scientists would drop difficult compounds from further consideration. Now, however, they can keep the problem space open to more kinds of molecules because they can explore more formulation alternatives. The other side of this transformation in defining prod uct concepts as a problem space is to pull "up" therapy science into a middle ground. Digital scientists can then work directly with the unfolding processes of therapy science and add their scaled-up framing to guide those forays. This genomics director describes their evolution of thinking about integrating "mass synthesizing capabil ities" of combinatorial chemistry with therapy sciences to explore hypotheses about how compounds work: On combinatorial chemistry, everyone thought you could make a million compounds from tossing lots of different pieces together and hoping for the best to screen them. You find—it is not that easy and you have to do lots of traditional chemistry making molecules that are not amenable to that type of chemistry. The way that we use those sorts of mass synthesis processes are much differ ent today than they were in the past. Today it is much more focused, and you make 100 compounds instead of one at a time and they are focused on something that is hypothesis driven, rather than, "Let's randomly make lots of things." They combine the vision of "traditional chem istry" with the analyses of digital sciences to select 100 molecules that might be promising, and then they explore these molecules using both therapy and digital sciences. This integrated approach to defining product concepts as an open problem space provides a common ground in which they can see more product possibilities in more systematic ways. The Knowledge Boundary of Procedures for Creating the Product The second knowledge boundary is concerned with the innovation activity of creating the product—in our case, a molecule. New products are designed and built to incorporate the features and benefits suggested by the product concept. A variety of practices lay out specific procedures for creating products and criteria for evaluat ing progress (e.g., Cooper 1998). Additional procedures for creating the product include using product platforms that define assets that can be shared by sets of products and working with product architectures that predefine connections (Ulrich and Eppinger 2000). Drug discovery scientists need a procedure to guide the work of so many people over such a long period. However, complex product innovation cannot follow lin ear sequences because the process is inherently nonlin ear. For example, in drug development a minor shift in a subgrouping on a molecule can make a drug horribly toxic. Complex innovation also cannot rely on platforms and architectures because many connections among parts are unknown. Both kinds of science provide comple mentary knowledge to help lay out a common proce dure for building the molecule. Unfortunately, both sets of scientists break down the complexity of the work by focusing on different facets of that work, using different procedures. Digital scientists seek to make specific processes of building the drug thorough and precise. They focus on particular steps in drug discovery, such as studying the protein target, and methodically identify its properties and solve problems with clear answers. For example, this digital scientist explains how he creates assays to measure protein stability: Different proteins are susceptible to different pH salts that will affect their stability, so why not develop a stan dard way to make a thousand measurements and be done with it? Using high-frequency screening tools, it's not a pain to make the measurements, and if you have a stan dard way of interpreting it, then every protein should be different but you've asked the same question in the same way. Same... with co-factors or vitamins or other con ditions that [name's] group might add to the protein. I</page><page sequence="10">Dougherty and Dunne: Digital Science and Knowledge Boundaries in Complex Innovation 1476 Organization Science 23(5), pp. 1467-1484, ©2012 INFORMS could just test all of those. If you survey a half dozen biochemists, they are going to come up with a list of 30 or 40 different things that are likely to [affect the pro tein], so let me just test all of them to see what effect they have on protein stability. What we've done over the last year is tried to figure out if that works.... What I see coming in from the project teams when they develop an assay is either, "Well, we've always done it this way, or I got this kit... The results of these systematic assays are digitized for careful analysis of, in this case, what might affect protein stability. He also said that they "vigorously eval uate" all the parameters about the protein stability, so they develop thorough knowledge of the protein and its interactions with other processes in the body. He dis misses the assays (tests) that therapy scientists typically use because he feels these are based on historical prac tice or simple kits—not on good, robust science. Another example from a structural biologist also shows that digital scientists focus on particular steps and optimize those steps to generate the right information to build the product: We figure out exactly what should be screened, how it should be screened, and make sure that the protein is exactly the protein that you want.... If you are in central nervous systems [referring to a therapy area], you are in there because you understand something about the CNS, but you don't know diddly-squat about all the assays that are available for you. You know a couple of them, and those are you stick to because those are the ones that you know. This scientist and his group can find exactly the right protein portion via crystallography, which measures rela tions among atoms and subgroupings. Then they can model the binding sites and how drug compounds might fit. His work is analytical, detached from the functioning of the body, and systematic. He also feels that the ther apy scientists do not carry out proper assays. Robust sci ence is based on how thoroughly and precisely scientists measure particular properties. Therapy scientists, in contrast, focus on how various subsystems that comprise the drug possibilities might interact. Each new drug has a unique architecture of interactions among the molecules, disease processes, and the rest of the body; thus therapy scientists concentrate on the concrete realities of these connections, not on systematic analyses of separate parts. For example, a therapy scientist recognizes the importance of structural biology, but she emphasizes knowing "in intimate detail about the protein that we are going after." Her focus is a grounded, in-depth understanding of how the compound will work with the protein: The structural biology group is the group that starts to work with the proteins and can generate the proteins and express them and crystallize the protein so that we can start to know in intimate detail about the protein target that we are going after. This therapy team leader recommends to his chemists that they "take a little bit of a broader approach" when they study molecules for a particular target: I think that one key is not to put too much into one set of data or one data point, and the way to avoid that is to take a little bit of a broader approach. So, for example,... a hypothesis is... that if I change this hydroxyl group to a fluorine atom, I am going to keep activity and I will get away from some metabolic liability. My advice to them is, don't go out and make one molecule to do that or to make that one switch. Make three or four or five and make them broadly. If you make that one, you might get misled. You might get some data back that is ambiguous, and there might be something else that is masking an effect that you are not going to see in one molecule.... [You need to] design molecules that... will help you get a more complete answer... . If it is too good to be true and it's cell based, now you can go to a tissue base and see if it is that good.... You can go to several of each kind of those models and see really how robust your model is. He emphasizes moving outward from a concrete the ory to carefully explore the hypothesis in several direc tions to avoid being misled. In contrast to the more unitary causal modeling of digital sciences, this ther apy scientist uses a multicausal model of interactions to "get a more complete answer" about how this molecule behaves in the body. Quick and dirty assays that digital scientists dismiss actually make good sense, because the therapy scientists use them to get some data, interpret them, and then tweak compounds some more. Therapy scientists think about building the product in the process of doing their science and describe their work in almost an anthropomorphic sense, such as "how the cells looked when they saw the molecule" or "how did the cells look when the molecule dissolves." Their search is connected to their experience, and they work out from what they know. A massive injection of data can slow them down, because therapy scientists have to think about things as they proceed. They learn in the process of doing science, not from analyzing a lot of data. Transforming the Innovation Activity of Building the Product The major difference at this knowledge boundary is a modular versus integral approach to building the drug product, based on different understandings of what con stitutes robust science. Digital scientists focus on the steps or subsystems, measure systematically but selec tively and abstractly, standardize, and imagine the actual molecule from all their systematic assessments. Therapy scientists focus on the whole system and measure actual interactions, but they imagine interactions beyond their immediate observations. Efforts to resolve the differences in procedure we find in our data combine the more modular but sys tematic answers of digital science with the more holis tic but hands-on approaches of therapy science. Drug</page><page sequence="11">Dougherty and Dunne: Digital Science and Knowledge Boundaries in Complex Innovation Organization Science 23(5), pp. 1467-1484, ©2012 INFORMS 1477 innovators cannot begin with a product architecture but must instead discover the architecture that reflects the unique configuration of interactions among the disease, compound, and bodily systems that each new drug will have. The procedure is to develop integrated but par tial models that reflect possible product architectures and then explore these models. These models shift over time because they are inherently partial, but they are robust understandings that allow multiple alternatives to be explored and learned from. The models highlight what we know so far and what we need to know more about. The interviews have a variety of instances of scientists working together on more integrated models. Digital scientists can work with therapy teams to refine the selection of targets and assays if they participate in thinking through particular models, as this genomics director describes: [OJther activities are highly interactive, so when my group works with a therapeutic area group to look for new targets in a disease they care about, we are work ing to use our technologies and their biology skills to jointly assess what might be useful to manipulate in their key disease. Then that team would select targets... in a collaborative fashion and help with the screen design. And [my group] works on the screen design with the high-frequency screening group to make sure that all the technologies.... They jointly assess "what might be useful to manipulate" by bringing to bear digital scientists' careful measures of protein structures with therapy scientists' intimate understandings of how certain proteins seem to operate. Rather than generate answers in the abstract, digital scientists answer the questions that therapy scien tists have about proteins. Digital scientists also leverage their unique abilities to see more possibilities by looking beyond to see whether other proteins might be better, and they develop assays to expose key issues that both groups think are important. Close collaborations are pos sible if the scientists are working together on the same models of drugs, as this example shows. A director of synthetic chemistry describes his efforts to systematically expand the explorations that therapy scientists can make using statistics and creating visuals: You know that with synthetic chemistry, you can make all kinds of different analogs here and put in differ ent functional groups there... and I can do other varia tions here.... [Chemists] improve molecules by trying to improve different parts of the molecule individually. [A chemist might say,] "I think I have found the right group here, and then I am going to improve this side because I think that this side interacts with the binding there." ... [We in synthetic chemistry] would like to find out what is the contribution of this particular subgroup. Can we detect from the data that we have... that it is sta tistically meaningful, that chances are that you will need this type of functional group here? ... We can do that in many different ways, with machine learning tools, with artificial intelligence... or we can do this with intuitive visualization, where the information does not describe that equation, but it is immediately apparent to you as a practicing scientist. This example suggests that by jointly developing mod els of interactions, scientists create a common ground of a rich set of possibilities to be explored more systemati cally than can either science working alone. Each group can help clarify what they know and need to know by filling in the models with their knowledge. The Knowledge Boundary of Projecting Forward The third knowledge boundary concerns looking forward to anticipate possible issues. Innovation by definition involves surprises, because people are always creat ing something new. Established innovation procedures incorporate a variety of ways to plan ahead, includ ing stage-gate processes and "time pacing" to sched ule major events and time for reappraisals (Brown and Eisenhardt 1997). Complex innovations are especially in need of sys tematic ways to project forward, because unpredictable shocks are inevitable. Because of the ambiguity of com plex innovation, however, people cannot predict how long activities will take or even what the activities may be, so stage-gates and time pacing provide lit tle help. Pickering (1995) argues that scientific practice emerges around unpredictable problems, called "resis tances," or obstacles that prevent scientists from obtain ing their goals, to which they react by revisions of strate gies, or "accommodations." Drug discovery is fraught with resistances such as surprising toxicology or poor pharmacological parameters. If innovators can anticipate some of these resistances, they may be able to bring them forward. In a simulation of complexity, Gavetti and Levinthal (2000) suggest that even crude mental models can improve the quality of search, so using "forward looking intelligence" is valuable. Digital sciences can complement therapy sciences to anticipate possible resis tances and how to get around them. However, we find that the two ways of knowing are severely divided over projecting forward, and both look forward in a very myopic, short-term way. Digital scientists focus on eliminating uncertainties rather than on projecting ahead to surface possible resis tances or barriers and focus on how to get around them. Strategic managers expect immediate paybacks from the large investments needed to finance these sciences, rein forcing this very short horizon. For example, this R&amp;D manager explains how they want technologies to reduce uncertainties: What are the sources of uncertainty? In what way... using new technologies and insights can we reduce that uncer tainty sooner and can we pay less to resolve uncer tainty? ... The use of genomics, proteomics—all these</page><page sequence="12">Dougherty and Dunne: Digital Science and Knowledge Boundaries in Complex Innovation 1478 Organization Science 23(5), pp. 1467-1484, ©2012 INFORMS new "omics" technologies—in effect are driven to resolv ing the uncertainties sooner and answering the question, "Is it likely to work or not?" Digital scientists measure and watch the here and now, focusing on a defined problem, such as is the target really part of a disease process, or is this compound the right one? Digital scientists do early tests to iden tify problems to be avoided, as this technology director explains: I am a big believer in developing key information early. It is a debate. If you talk to the chemists, say it is bind ing to (a certain hormone), if it inhibits that, it has bad effects. But some say it is so early with the compound, we don't think that is an issue until we do it later, ver sus we know now and we can pay attention. We generate more information early, so decisions are made, maybe preventative decisions. [Therapy chemists] are like physi cians, they always think they can save a molecule, they want to fix it. It is difficult to stop projects. Another strategic manager describes the need for bet ter information to inform decisions in a rational fashion. She emphasizes the pipeline overall and its impacts on costs, which also reinforce digital scientists' tendency to emphasize precision, not forward-looking plausibility, for projects: We have to really inform our decisions. So we are try ing to get to a point where every decision is made with the best possible and most rigorous data in front of the decision makers, and that includes things like what is it going to cost, what does it do to the capacity, what are your lost opportunities if you pursue this drug rather than that drug,... are there areas in your pipeline where you really need to complement internal research with external licensing or purchasing a product? She implies that the information for choosing among projects is sensible and available, so the real challenge is to get all the data together. Managers generate pressure to get the right answers now and to eliminate uncertain ties rather than address them. Digital scientists do anticipate problems and do try to get a "heads up." A director of genomics said, "You need to know where your target is expressed in other human tissue to make sure you have a heads up if it is expressed somewhere it might cause a problem down the road." However, the digital sciences do not actively help rework project models to get around inevitable problems as they arise. Therapy scientists are frustrated by these efforts to pile up information and eliminate uncertainty, because they think eliminating uncertainty is not possible. They expect continuous resistances and thus focus on mud dling through these uncertainties, not on eliminating them. This biologist's view of how projects unfold con trasts with the straightforwardly described gathering of information above: We had a great example of our teams' biggest success last year. We delivered one of these (new drug possibilities) to enter early development, which was the major business objective that we had... for a target that had been on the team for many, many years. It was a path fraught with all kinds of significant obstacles, each one of which was overcome. We don't know yet if this is going to yield a drug that will benefit patients, but certainly we have come farther than we have before. If we had decided at any point on the line that this is just too hard or someone had said it is taking way too long, we would not have gotten here. He emphasizes the many unpredictable obstacles that crop up in discovery and the nonlinear unfolding of events over unpredictable lengths of time. He also emphasizes the need to persist to make progress. A director of biology at another firm also highlights the processes of muddling through: The issue for every program changes on almost a month by-month basis, and it is how well you can negotiate through those issues and solve them.... Even when you are identifying genes and validating them and looking for hits and molecules that perturb it... and developing ani mal models for diseases, each of those will have multiple issues. And with every program they never happen in the same place, so it is not as though you can anticipate them. Both these comments indicate that problems arise con tinually and must be dealt with as they arise. "How well you can negotiate through those issues and solve them" is key—muddling through uncertainties, not eliminating them. Therapy scientists project ahead by searching in their grounded, holistic way around the actual function ing of the living body. They try to use good scientific approaches, observe, and then choose next steps. How ever, they can move myopically because there is no way to break out of local search. Transforming the Innovation Activity of Projecting Forward The major difference at this knowledge boundary con cerns eliminating uncertainties versus muddling through them. Neither approach projects forward far enough into the problem space to spot small perturbations that may escalate into severe problems or recognizes patterns that suggest better possible solutions. The result is that risks are not addressed. We find that scientists can transform this innovation activity and look farther out in the prob lem space if they compare several models of drug pos sibilities to anticipate how interactions might play out. Comparing models of the partial architectures to see far ther down the development path breaks scientists out of local and narrow searching and pushes them to reframe what they are doing. Reframing involves stepping back from the daily minutia of work when things break down or parameters are in flux and redefining the problem space (Majchrzak et al. 2006).</page><page sequence="13">Dougherty and Dunne: Digital Science and Knowledge Boundaries in Complex Innovation Organization Science 23(5), pp. 1467-1484, ©2012 INFORMS 1479 For example, a director of digital sciences describes efforts that are just getting started to digitally integrate some of the many databases intelligently to help project forward: We spend millions and millions of dollars generating that information... [now we are developing] informat ics systems that are IT in steroids, information man agement with intelligence. The idea is to present that information, organize it properly, categorize it properly, and present it to our users, our scientists, in a way that would allow them to make decisions, what to do next and what molecules to design, what compounds to advance, et cetera... . We put together computational tools to look historically at all the information here and try to detect trends... to see what makes the active compounds active and what are their common characteristics. Rather than try to eliminate uncertainties, this digital scientist is trying to use his science to "detect trends" that suggest better alternatives for designing molecules. He and his group are exploring models of variations to anticipate patterns of molecular design that produce good activity against a disease process. This same director also explains how digital scientists enable therapy scientists' intuition with digital science: You take all the information and formulate models and hypotheses to guide your efforts. We can do this with varying levels of sophistication. We can do this in a com pletely automated way where computers basically try to learn for themselves, but that is not going to work. It is better if the computers provide hints or directions.... We are trying to put practicing chemists and biologists in the driver's seat. This is a game of intuition, unlike many other scientific disciplines.... We are trying to massage the information and present it in a way that will allow chemists to use their own intuition to make sense of it. Digital scientists cannot represent the living human body, but they can simulate possibilities that engage therapy scientists' intuition so that all the scientists can reframe their ideas, rethink their approaches, and muddle through the problem space more systematically. When the activity of projecting forward is transformed into anticipating what the drug and its interactions with the disease and biological systems might be like, the two groups of scientists have a common ground for mov ing forward. They can collectively anticipate critical resistances or obstacles among the interactions and also anticipate unexpected possibilities. Anticipation enables them to think ahead farther down the development path. Discussion When it comes to a complex product innovation such as drug development, we find that digitalization has another role to play in innovation. In addition to roles already articulated by research, such as providing tools and methods, facilitating communication, and expand ing work roles and relations (e.g., Boland et al. 2007), the digitalization of sciences also creates new kinds of knowledge about product design possibilities in complex domains such as drug discovery. However, we find that the digitization of sciences combines with complexity to produce three new knowledge boundaries that concern central innovation activities. The novel understandings from digitalization cannot be used effectively in complex product innovation unless these innovation activities are transformed—otherwise, each group of scientists will address different aspects of the complexity and go off in different directions. Our analysis suggests three sig nificant transformations in these core innovation activ ities. We summarize these findings for drug discovery and develop their implications for managing complex innovation more generally. Digitalization as a New Source of Knowledge Our first finding is that the digitalization of the sciences in drug discovery creates new knowledge about human diseases and how to treat them with drugs. This knowl edge enables product innovators in this complex domain to more effectively deal with the complexity. The idea that digitalization can produce new kinds of knowing is not new; this insight is reflected in studies of how pro fessions are transformed through computerization (e.g., Barley 1986, Boland et al. 2007). However, we highlight this new knowledge in its own right. Our grounded theory suggests that this new knowledge can enable innovators to more effectively grapple with the enormous risks and challenges of complex innovation and get beyond nar row knowledge traps to envision very new possibilities in value creation. Additional research can examine whether or not, and if so, how, digitalization creates new knowl edge for complex innovation in domains such as architec ture, engineering, and construction (Boland et al. 2007) or fire control and management (Dodgson et al. 2007). Transforming Innovation Activities to Leverage Digital Science and Incorporate Complexity We also find three knowledge boundaries that prevent digital sciences from being used well. We extend the ories of knowledge boundaries (Bechky 2003, Carlile 2004, Levina and Vaast 2005) to suggest that difficul ties with bridging boundaries can be addressed in part by transforming the collective activities of innovation themselves to form new common grounds. These new common grounds enable innovators in complex domains to define open but coherent problem spaces that frame their joint work, to build their products by develop ing partial models of possible product architectures that reflect critical interactions among subsystems, and to project forward by anticipating how their models will unfold. These transformed innovation activities provide new ways to frame possibilities for product conceptual ization and design and to examine these possibilities in a more open, rich, yet systematic way. We also expect</page><page sequence="14">Dougherty and Dunne: Digital Science and Knowledge Boundaries in Complex Innovation 1480 Organization Science 23(5), pp. 1467-1484, ©2012 INFORMS that digital and therapy scientists will need boundary spanning competencies (Levina and Vaast 2005) and tan gible boundary objects (Bechky 2003) to integrate their knowledge. Here, we emphasize transformations in inno vation activities that we argue are necessary before com petencies and boundary objects can work in complex innovation. Important new research concerns identify ing competencies and boundary objects that work with these transformed activities to enhance complex innova tion and concerns what other innovation activities need to be transformed. First, a new common ground for defining product con cepts is an open problem space of what we can know and can do for this disease. The open problem space reflects Simon's (1977) general discussion that problems often cannot be precisely defined, so people need to define a problem space that is based on initial goals, constraints, and processes for generating and evaluat ing alternatives. The scientists in our study collectively develop a problem space by integrating their global and local understandings into a rich, plausible theory about, how to address a disease with a drug. Their product concept is not a single configuration or precise specifi cation, but it is rather an open space that encompasses a variety of alternatives that have rich potential. Because the jointly developed problem space encompasses both knowledge systems, the scientists can work together. This new common ground helps overcome the chal lenges of complexity that arise when scientists cannot determine the feasibility up front and thus have no clear criteria. It generates a new way to frame the collective knowledge for innovation. Second, a common ground for building the product is to focus on crafting models of the drug that, like architec tures, encompass interactions among the product's sub systems. These models are inherently partial because the product architecture cannot be predefined. Building and exploring partial models of possible product architec tures enables the insights of digital sciences to comple ment those of therapy sciences, so innovators embrace the complexity rather than break it down. This new com mon ground resolves the complexity challenges of non linearity and unknown interactions by enabling the scien tists to do robust science together, because they can test models against what should be, learn about what parts might go together, and then create and test new models. Finally, a common ground for projecting forward is to anticipate problems and possibilities by reaching farther out into the problem space, reframing models and the problem space itself to accommodate new insights. By comparing several models of products, both groups of scientists can break out of local searching and look far ther along the development path, which opens them to recognizing emergent patterns of better alternatives or of major problems. They step back from the daily minutia of search and reframe alternatives. Once generated, new alternatives are tested scientifically, but widely, so that many aspects of the models such as theories embod ied in observation tools or ceteris paribus conditions can be tested and modified (Grandori 2010). This new com mon ground helps resolve the complexity challenges the absence of linear procedures and predictable time peri ods for activities. General Implications for Managing Complex Innovation These transformed innovation activities also suggest new possibilities for managing for innovation that involves more complexity. All three new activities embrace com plexity rather than avoid it or try to break it down, and they help innovators notice unexpected outcomes and recognize emerging patterns. First, by conceptualizing the product as an open problem space rather than as clearly defined blueprint or singular outcome, innova tors set themselves up for recognizing product possi bilities they could not know about ahead of time. We suggest that these problem spaces need to be richly informed by scientific theory, and that this knowledge needs to be articulated enough to be intersubjective, not only subjective. However, the openness means that there are no early "design freezes," so the innovation process can easily absorb enormous amounts of resources and not get anywhere. Existing research indicates that inno vating within an open problem space based on digital knowledge occurs in other domains, so these cases can be examined to develop new skills for innovation. For example, Boland et al. (2007) indicate that leading archi tects use digitalization to keep designs open to explore new possibilities as they emerge. Additional research can also examine the limits of an open product space by considering how long the designs for complex machines, such as aircraft or semiconductors, can stay open to allow important possibilities to emerge and how open the space can be before it no longer frames the work. Defining an open space is not enough to leverage the potential of complexity. Innovators also need to search this space productively, and we suggest that creating and exploring partial models of the product architec ture is one way to productively search an open space. Instead of trying to reduce the complexity by breaking the problem down into separate or local parts, complex innovators need to discover the underlying architecture of their product. The parts in complex products inter act in a heterarchical way, with many-to-many ties that may be entangled, so complex innovators need to both look for and recognize previously unknown interactions. Looking for connections and interactions, not only work ing on parts, also transforms the use of architectures in product innovation. Other product domains cannot rely on modular architectures either. Yoo et al. (2010a) argue that layered architectures of fluid and open to new</page><page sequence="15">Dougherty and Dunne: Digital Science and Knowledge Boundaries in Complex Innovation Organization Science 23(5), pp. 1467-1484, ©2012 INFORMS 1481 meanings. Studying how to build products with layered architectures should help develop procedures for build ing complex products more generally. Sennett's (2008) "craftsman" also emphasizes wholes by integrating the head (abstracted analytics and representations) with the hands (localized physical experiences) for a fuller com prehension of the work domain. Research can examine how to use partial models of interactions to explore open problem spaces more productively. Finally, innovators cannot work locally on complex products because they may overlook inevitable resis tances or miss emerging patterns of interactions that arise discontinuously. We propose that innovators in complex domains need to project farther out into the problem space and explore more of it systematically. These innovators cannot predict outcomes, but they can anticipate possibilities, we suggest, by contrasting mod els of possible product architectures that highlight differ ent patterns. By contrasting these models, innovators can reach farther out into the problem space and anticipate more resistances or obstacles (Pickering 1995). Antici pation also helps innovators to accommodate these resis tances by revising their strategies systematically rather than in an ad hoc manner. Projecting forward with anticipation therefore reflects both reframing (Majchrzak et al. 2006) and abduction (Boisot and McKelvey 2010). Reframing occurs when people note when things are not working, when parameters are in flux, or when things break down. Abduction, according to Peirce (1935), "consists of examining a mass of facts and in allow ing these facts to suggest a theory" (quoted in Boisot and McKelvey 2010, p. 425). An important research thrust is to study how innovators in complex domains can use reframing and abduction to address the risks of complexity. Limitations and Future Research This study is limited in a number of ways that bounds the applicability of our theory and opens up new ques tions. First, it is reasonable to assume that digital sci entists, on the whole, are younger and have a different education because they are working with new fields. We did not have enough variation in our data to explore whether or how demographic and background differ ences affect the knowledge boundaries and the transfor mation in innovation. These are new fields of science, and in our data, some people were trained in the digi tal sciences, some had traditional scientific training but moved into digital work, and others moved from ther apy to digital units. A large sample study should reveal whether such differences affect the integration of new sciences into the innovation process. Second, we iden tified one broad category of digital sciences, but there are likely to be important differences among the digi tal sciences, which should be examined. Third, the rapid evolution of the new digital sciences may also affect how and how well they can be folded into innovation. Research can explore this challenge by comparing the ongoing integration of relatively mature with very new digital sciences to see whether different kinds of bound aries exist or whether different approaches are needed to integrate them. Fourth, we did not observe the actual implementation of digital science. Ethnographies that trace how particular digital sciences over several years became integrated successfully (and not into complex product innovation processes) would extend or reframe our theory. Finally, studies that contrast implementation of digital knowledge into complex innovation processes across a variety of settings would highlight firm and pro cess properties that are also important. In conclusion, the digitalization of sciences generates enormous amounts of information about biological and chemical processes that can reveal new insights about the complex innovation of drug discovery. The tendency until now has been to use these digital sciences in a traditional way—by scaling up separate steps, measur ing innumerable aspects of human and other kinds of biology, and analyzing interactions among all of these aspects. Complexity makes the number of things to scale up, measure, and analyze virtually infinite, so innova tors in a complex domain cannot attempt to know every thing. We argue that the digitalization of drug discovery sciences can be used to know better about the com plex products, not just know more. Because the digital ization of the sciences enables people to map out new terrains of human biology, delve deeply into minute bio logical mechanisms, and pull together both of these fea tures, it can help people look over the next hills and valleys to see new kinds of product functionality. How ever, this new knowledge must work in tandem with other knowledge. Integration requires that the activi ties of innovation themselves be transformed to incor porate the new knowledge—otherwise, the digitalization of sciences may continue in its more limited role as just a tool and method. We have not explained how to enable all this collaboration, but we have developed a foundation for the further study of how this new role for digitalization—as a source of new knowledge for complexity—can play out in this and other complex innovation efforts.
