<plain_text><page sequence="1">Early Maceheads in the Southern Levant: A "Chalcolithic" Hallmark in Neolithic Context Danny Rosenberg University of Haifa, Haifa, Israel Maceheads have long been acknowledged as a characteristic feature of groundstone assemblages of the Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Age periods of the southern Levant, and as indicators of warfare and ritual activity, and symbols of rule. The data presented here suggest that maceheads made their first appearance within the social and economic context of the later parts of the Pre-Pottery Neolithic and early phases of the Pottery Neolithic (Yarmukian culture, ca. 6400-5800 cal b.c.) of the southern Levant; from there they found their way into sites of the Pottery Neolithic Jericho IX/Lodian (ca. 5900-5600 cal b.c.) and Wadi Rabah (ca. 5700-5200 cal b.c.) cultures, and subsequently into Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Age settlements. Keywords: Chalcolithic, Groundstone, Maceheads, Neolithic, Southern Levant Introduction of the macehead is still controversial (Rowan et al. Maceheads, apparently used in hand-to-hand com- 2006: 592; Sebbane 1998); some researchers have bat, were among the most common weapon types in pointed to Mesopotamia as the place of origin for the ancient Near East (Sebbane 1998: 1).

In contrast, and as 1995; Sebbane 1998: 1, 88). Groundstone (henceforth, part of ongoing systematic research on the stone stone) maceheads are perforated items, usually made assemblages of the prehistoric, protohistorical, and from small, shaped cobbles, which were placed at the historical periods of the southern Levant, maceheads tops of shafts (handles or hafts) that were generally were identified in assemblages dated to the Pottery made of perishable materials. These stone objects Neolithic period (fig. i). were affixed to their handles by ropes, strings, or in this paper, I present the earliest maceheads of adhesives (Sebbane 1998: 58).

Some scholars suggest that Chalcolithic maceheads display funda mentally new concepts of authority (Golden 2009; Rowan and Golden 2009). Nonetheless, the new data presented here indicate that maceheads appeared in the southern Levant in the Pottery Neolithic period or even a little earlier. stone, reached the sites as final products In terms of morphology, Chalcolithic stone mace heads have a variety of shapes, some resembling shapes characteristic of Pre-Dynastic Egypt. It has been claimed that stone macehead production was influenced by the introduction of copper and the use of the lost wax technique, which enabled a wide range of shapes to be produced (Sebbane 1998). Chalcolithic macehead forms include piriform, onion-shaped, flattened-spher oid, barrel-shaped, globular, disc-shaped, and carinated (Mallon et al. 1934: plate 35; Perrot and Ladiray 1980: fig. 77:4; Rowan and Golden 2009; Scheftelowitz 2004; Thus' if stone maceheads are to be considered Sebbane 1998).

If this is the case, The accumulated data suggest that maceheads and maceheads do signify the development of social similar to those commonly found in Chalcolithic hierarchies, some oi the social processes that char sites appeared for the first time in southern acterized the Chalcolithic period may have slowly Levantine contexts and may be a local innovation developed in the second half of the 8th, the 7th, and in the later parts of the Pre-Pottery Neolithic and the most of the 6th millennia cal b.c., corresponding to early stages of the Pottery Neolithic. Consequently, the later parts of the Pre-Pottery Neolithic period, these objects have a longer history than previously and in the social sphere of Pottery Neolithic village thought, and display many features that later communities. 214 Journal of Field Archaeology 2010 vol, 35 no. 2</page><page sequence="12">It has been claimed that exotic artifacts in fanning villages served to regulate social relations (Gilead 1988), and thus, one must consider maceheads in the Pottery Neolithic period as probable elements in a social and/or ritual system that regulated control over power and resources (whether directed internally or externally). Yet, using maceheads as sole indicators of complexity, social organization, or development of social hierarchies is unjustifiable; they must be considered as a constituent of wider material culture datasets. Pottery Neolithic maceheads known from the southern Levant are primarily made of local raw materials and are found in habitation sites, which may suggest that the importance ascribed to this item during the Pottery Neolithic lay less in its raw material and production (probably not by specia lists) than in the object itself and its social signi ficance. The role of maceheads seems to change with the onset of the Ghassulian Chalcolithic, when macehead production involved a wider set of raw materials (some reflecting long-distance trade) and technological developments, specifically the produc tion of copper maceheads and standards, which show a greater diversity of types. This evidence supports the suggestion that the later Chalcoli thic maceheads were part of wider and more complex social systems than their Pottery Neolithic forerunners.
