<plain_text><page sequence="1">Variations on the Female Referent in A thabaskan Cultures' RICHARD J. PERRY Practices and beliefs involving a reference to femaleness occur widely among A thabaskan- speaking peoples. It is suggested here that these phenomena share a convergent structural relationship in a common ideological basis, and that culture-specific versions may be seen as alternative transformations of the same pattern. A comparison of Western Apache and Northern A thabaskan versions indicates that environmental circumstances affecting the role of women in subsistence have contributed to diferences between the two. A NUMBER OF FEATURES are widely shared by Athabaskan societies. Among these are girls' puberty ceremonies, beliefs attributing negative or threatening aspects to menstruation, matrilocal residence, and in many cases, particularly in the Southwest, matrilineal social organization. None of these is unique to Athabaskan-speaking peoples, but occurring together they constitute a typically Athabaskan set of characteristics. One aspect common to all of these phenomena is a reference to femaleness, implicitly treated in many cases as an abstract quality with an existence independent of discrete persons, and capable of imbuing and affecting individuals to varying degrees. This theme is expressed in a variety of ways in the contexts of ideology and social organization. Provisionally taken as a set, practices containing a female referent (including expressions of belief as well as patterns of action) occur in different Athabaskan cultures as culture-specific versions or transforma- tions. A comparison will be drawn here between a number of aspects of Western Apache and Northern Athabaskan versions, and factors that may contribute to differences between the two will be explored. Comparison of a specific culture with a summary of a culture area requires justification. In the centuries since proto-Apacheans left the Subarctic, cultures in the North have undergone their own unique changes, in many cases involving influences from surrounding non- Athabaskan societies. To postulate any direct link between specific Northern and Southern Athabaskan groups would be incautious at best. However, glottochronological data on the percentage of shared cognates among these groups might be taken provisionally as an indicator of historic propinquity. 1 Field research on which much of this paper is based was made possible by a Public Health Service Fellowship 1 F01 MH43646-01Al from the National Institute of Mental Health. I would also like to thank Dr. Barbara Larson for her advice and comments on an earlier version of this paper. 99 VOL. 33, 1977</page><page sequence="2">100 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH The Apachean languages, with the exception of Kiowa Apache, share cognates in the 95% range. Using the Navajo dialect to represent the Apachean subdivision, Hoijer has shown that the Northern Atha- baskan languages sharing the highest percentage of cognates with the Apachean group are Chipewyan with 76%, Carrier and Galice with 73%, and Kutchin and Hare with 71% (presented in Dyen and Aberle 1974:12-13). Although each of these is below the provisional language limit set by the authors at 77%, at which level they distinguish dialects from languages, the percentages are higher than those shared with the other Northern Athabaskan groups. Consequently, although the overriding concern will be with the Northern Athabaskan region in general, emphasis will fall heavily on the Chipewyan in attempting to discern a generalized Athabaskan pattern, particularly when there are substantial differences among groups. It is by no means suggested that the historic Chipewyan represent any proto-Apachean or proto-Athabaskan culture. It must be assumed that these groups have undergone numerous changes since their separation. But bearing this in mind, features shared by historically related groups separated widely in both a geographic and a temporal sense are potentially significant; this significance is underscored when it can be shown that such features occur with high frequency among other Athabaskan groups as well. On this basis it seems modest enough to postulate what might be called general Athabaskan characteristics which were probably shared by these groups at a time before separation took place. In dealing with the Southern Athabaskans it would be preferable to give full attention to all historically known Apachean divisions, but any attempt to achieve this thoroughly would exceed the limits of this paper. Because of this and the locale of my own field research, the primary Southern Athabaskan focus will be the Western Apache. With the notable exception of the clan system, however, most aspects of Western Apache culture discussed here tend to be representative of the Apacheans in general. DIACHRONIC RELATIONSHIPS The common origins of Apachean cultures have been established through linguistic analysis, and Hoijer has shown that, excluding the Kiowa Apache, all Southern Athabaskan divisions share a single language with differences only at the level of dialect (1971:4). It seems reasonably certain, then, that ancestors of the historic Mescalero, Chiricahua, Western Apache, Navajo, Jicarilla, and Lipan once shared</page><page sequence="3">FEMALE REFERENT IN ATHABASKAN CULTURES 101 a common culture and constituted a single population. It has also been established that the North American origins of Southern Athabaskan speakers lie in the Western Subarctic, where Athabaskan languages are still spoken (see Dumond 1969:858; Driver 1961:578; Tweedie 1968). Vogt points out that some Northern Athabaskan words can still be understood by native Navajo speakers (1961:231). The specifics of migration are less certain. Archaeological evidence is sparse and ambiguous for the historic period, largely due to the simplicity of proto-Apachean technology and the small mobile popula- tion units in which the migration took place. Early French and Spanish references to Apaches or possible Apaches on the Plains have been dealt with at some length and related to archaeological sites (e.g. Gunnerson and Gunnerson 1971; Schlesier 1972), but these accounts postdate the accepted arrival of Apaches in the Southwest. Despite these problems, a general sequence of events can be reconstructed with some confidence. Proto-Apacheans departed from the Subarctic at some time around A.D. 600 (Hoijer 1956). The Kiowa Apache may not have been a part of this contingent or may have left it early to enter the Plains, never reaching the Southwest at all (Gunner- son and Gunnerson 1971:13; Hoijer 1971:5; Mooney 1898:241-48; Schlesier 1972). The split probably involved a separation of multiple small groups rather than a single exodus. Historic Athabaskan social organization in the North, with mobile extended families operating singly or in small clusters, suggests that the movement took place in trickles rather than a large wave. By A.D. 1400 they were at least on the periphery of the Southwest core area. In historic times, Apachean social organization has been fluid and unstable at virtually all levels, with units segmenting and rejoining on a situational basis (Basehart 1971:39-40; Perry 1972). Cultural differen- tiation continued in the Southwest as local groups occupied various niches throughout the region, and, by the mid nineteenth century, six Apachean divisions in addition to the Kiowa Apache were culturally as well as geographically discernible, although this does not amount to a complete inventory of Apachean groups. Some disappeared in historic times (Forbes 1959), and the process of flux continued even into the reservation period when Lipan survivors merged with the Mescalero. The Southern Athabaskans present a case of culture change that should constitute a rich area for research, since a major variable, the prior culture form, can be held constant against a number of alternative directions of change. The Apache situation could be seen in that sense as a single culture in multiple adaptations. Despite the fortuitous aspects of this, however, the number of variables involved and the</page><page sequence="4">102 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH paucity of data from the early period in the Southwest still render the situation almost hopelessly complex. Factors and influences acting on Apacheans in the centuries preceeding 1850 are unsalvageable in their entirety. But by focusing on what has persisted rather than on what has not, insights may be gained into some aspects of the transformations that have taken place. Features involving reference to a concept of femaleness shared by diverse Athabaskan groups are well documented, although the forms in which these features are manifest vary from group to group, and in many cases elements derived from non-Athabaskan cultures have been incorporated. The Jicarilla girls' puberty rite, for example, involves corn grinding and a ceremonial relay race, both of which are clearly a result of Puebloan influences (Opler 1936). The masked dancers associated with this ritual in most Apachean groups have similar origins. Whatever additions or elaborations, however, the girls' rite itself is a general Apachean feature. Since it also occurs among Northern Athabaskans its standing as an ancient Athabaskan practice seems certain. The only factor that the Apachean girls' rite, residence patterns, and beliefs surrounding menstruation would seem to have in common is their coincidental reference to a female principle, but their occurrence together in most Athabaskan cultures suggests that they may be divergent manifestations of a deeper ideological posture. Ortner's concept of "key symbols" seems pertinent in this regard, particularly the type she refers to as elaborating symbols (1973:1344). Elaborating symbols . . are symbols valued for their contribution to the ordering or "sorting out" of experience. Within this are symbols valued primarily for the ordering of conceptual experience, i.e., for providing culture "orientations," and those valued primarily for the ordering of action, i.e., for providing cultural "strategies." By examining cultural expressions that contain reference to some aspect of femaleness, it is possible to discern the attributes of this concept more clearly and to trace its modification in alternative cultural contexts. There is no attempt here to determine the place of this concept in the thought of individuals. For the purposes of this study such data are considered inaccessible. The intent is only to show that overt manifestations of this theme have varied together in a demonstr- able manner in two different Athabaskan cultural settings, thus sug- gesting an implicit relationship. It is assumed that any structural relationship, if it does exist, is liable to operate below the level of consciousness (Levi-Strauss 1967:273). Nor is there any search for ultimate origins of the Athabaskan symbolic emphasis on the female. It will be taken as a starting point that the phenomenon occurs widely</page><page sequence="5">FEMALE REFERENT IN ATHABASKAN CULTURES 103 among Athabaskan groups, and the focus of attention will be on its variant manifestations. THE SUBARCTIC PATTERN Historic social organization in the Northern Athabaskan region, probably typical of the region at the time of the proto-Apachean split as well, involved sparse populations distributed in small, unstable social units (Helm 1965; Spencer, Jennings et al. 1965:156). Early accounts of the Chipewyan reflect their nomadic, "unsettled disposition" (Jenness 1956:17). Among the Kaska, Nabesna, and others, more complex forms of social organization occurred involving moieties and explicit lineages (Honigmann 1949; McKennan 1959; Hippler 1973), but unilineal organization tended to be weak, if not absent, throughout most of the region and seems to have been stimulated in some cases through contact with non-Athabaskan groups (VanStone 1974:52-53). Even so, it seems significant that where it did occur it involved elaboration on a principle of relationship through females. Northern Athabaskan groups in general could be characterized as lacking explicit lineage organization, con- sistent with demographic dispersal, which in itself is suited to a reli- ance on wild foods in an extremely harsh environment. Considering the dearth of rigid, explicitly defined, overall sociopolit- ical organization, it is more accurate to refer to tendencies than to rules of organization. Helm's analysis of Dogrib social organization depicts a population that normally operated in terms of atomistic, minimal units of extended or joint families retaining the capacity to amass in progressively larger aggregations for specific, immediate, and usually temporary purposes. Her highest level of organization, the tribe, was based on cultural uniformity but had no overall political structure (Helm 1965). Criteria for affiliation among minimal population units included kinship, but here again a high degree of option precluded the operation of rigid rules. Coincident with the looseness of organization, however, some bias toward a matrilocal residence pattern has been noted (Spencer, Jennings et al. 1965:162; VanStone 1974:53; Curtis 1970). This is further suggested by the institution of bride service among the Chipewyan, Sekani, and other groups, requiring a man to hunt for his wife's parents for a specified length of time as a part of the marriage agreement (Jenness 1955; Spencer, Jennings et al. 1965:163). In the North, then, the female principle often functioned as a pivotal point in what little formal organization existed. This is especially significant in light of the more overt matrilocality and matrilineal organization of most Southern Athabaskan groups. As Spencer notes:</page><page sequence="6">104 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH It is true that the interior Athabascans were receptive to maternal organization by virtue of the special residence and marital patterns they possessed, unilineal organization being implicit in their particularized kinship system. (Spencer, Jennings et al. 1965:163). Girls' puberty ceremonies were lacking among the Chipewyan (Curtis 1970:23), but did occur among many Northern Athabaskan groups. Usually there were no corresponding rituals for boys, although in regions bordering on the Plains and the Eastern Subarctic, a vision quest had limited distribution as a prerequisite for male adulthood (Spencer, Jennings et al. 1965:164). This does not seem to have occurred as widely or consistently throughout the Athabaskan area as ritual recognition of girls' puberty. Belief in danger associated with menstruation was also widespread. Girls at the time of their first menses were secluded, considered offensive to game, dangerous to men, and of some danger even to themselves. They were forbidden to gaze over the countryside in the belief that this would cause game to leave. In some societies girls in this condition might be left behind if the groups were to move to another encamp- ment. In many cases they could not travel along regular trails but were forced to walk through the bush parallel to the path. Various food restrictions were placed on girls during menstruation, and scratching sticks were used in the belief that a girl who touched herself at this time would cause sores to break out on her skin (Spencer, Jennings et al. 1965:164). Threatening attributes of femaleness occur in other realms as well. Hippler discusses the prevalence of a toothed-vagina theme in the mythology of the area, analyzing anxieties in terms of the circumstances involved in childrearing (1973). Coincident with an emphatic concern with the female in this context, however, women as individuals did not enjoy particularly high status, whether defined in terms of economic and political rights (Sanday 1973:1682), or in terms of prestige and influence. Lowie refers to the Chipewyan as exceptional in North America with regard to the low status of their women (1961:203). Hearne discusses the "slavish life" of Chipewyan women, the low esteem and poor treatment that females received, and refers to those he had seen as "poor wretches" (quoted in Jenness 1956:22). Curtis suggests a causal relationship between this low status and a high rate of suicide among Chipewyan women (1970:23). According to Oswalt, Chipewyan women professed to be happy when their infant daughters died and were spared the misery of womanhood (1966:27), and Jenness reports that Kutchin mothers practiced female infanticide for the same reason (1955:404). A pervasive concept of threat associated with femaleness thus co-occurred with an innocuous social status for women.</page><page sequence="7">FEMALE REFERENT IN ATHABASKAN CULTURES 105 It is essential here to distinguish between levels of abstraction involved in the concept of femaleness on one hand and women as people on the other. Clearly they were not unrelated, but they appear to have occupied different levels of cultural reality. If the concept of femaleness as an abstract principle can be accepted, it seems to have been handled in the same manner as other Athabaskan concepts involving power. It was neither good nor bad inherently, but potentially dangerous when present in excessive degrees. The idea of an abstract quality distinct from the individuals invested with it is an important aspect of other Athabaskan belief systems and appears compatible with Douglas's hypothesis that where institutions exert a minimum of control over the individual, there will be a tendency toward a marked spirit/matter dichotomy (1969:72). In discussing Navajo concepts of disease, Lamphere states that: Objects which are simultaneously natural and supernatural are projected into or on the body rather than concepts derived from the body states being projected into the supernatural world. (1969:302) Opler's discussion of Mescalero thought suggests a similar as- sumption of external qualities capable of imbuing or leaving indivi- duals: The attachments of supernatural powers and their human agents ebbed and flowed. And with regard to disease, in the explanation for sickness certain dangerous and polluting agents loomed large: lightning, which could sicken by striking close; the bear, whose odor could cause a serious ailment; the snake, whose sloughed skin could be lethal. . . (1969:25) These expressions suggest an ideology in which the reification and independent existence of abstract qualities is an essential premise. Given this ideological posture, and a pervasive concern with femaleness, it seems consistent that a girl at the age of puberty would have been involved in a ceremonial acknowledgement of the fact that she was now imbued with femaleness. No longer a child, she had become a woman. Formerly only an individual with that potential, she now had fully attained femaleness. The idea of femaleness as an abstract quality external to the individual is an essential aspect of this interpretation. It was the acquisition, the arrival of femaleness, that was recognized both ceremonially and through seclusion. From this viewpoint it is not paradoxical that as an adult she may have had very low status, since the girl herself was never really the object of the ceremony: only her condition. It could be said that the girl functioned as a medium of a transpersonalized quality.</page><page sequence="8">106 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH The concept of a nonhuman essence being neither good nor bad, but merely powerful and hence dangerous in excess, is widespread among Athabaskan cultures. This principle, with the corollary that such power is transpersonalized and invested rather than inherent in individuals, can shed light on the complex of beliefs surrounding menstruation. At the time of menstruation the condition of femaleness is more obvious, and thus heightened. At no other time, with the exception of childbirth, is the difference between male and female so heavily underscored (and in fact childbirth also involved seclusion in many Athabaskan groups). The femaleness of the girl at this time was excessive, and this excessive state constituted a source of danger. It was believed that close contact with a menstruating female could weaken a man. For a woman in such a condition to lie across the body of a strong man could debilitate him (Spencer, Jennings et al. 1965), which again supports the impression of femaleness as a quality that can pass from one person to another, diluting or even neutralizing postu- lated male attributes. This idea is strengthened further by the belief that a girl was also dangerous to herself at this time, not being allowed to scratch her body and so forth. The danger here did not arise from the girl as a person, but from the condition that had been imposed on her. There is no contradiction, then, between the appearance of women being imbued with great powers in the context of menstruation and negligible powers in the social realm. Since they functioned only as involuntary media of a powerful essence they had little power in either case. This does not fully explain the negative association between menstruation and hunting, but it suggests a contributing factor. L6vi-Strauss points out that such a connection is extremely common in hunting societies (1966:15), and Driver indicates that this is one of the most widespread beliefs in North America (1961:80). In the Athabaskan case it seems to be the net result of several factors. Wild foods of any kind in the Western Subarctic are relatively scarce, but vegetable foods are particularly so, especially in the northern regions. Hunting, therefore, is especially important to any nonagricultu- ral peoples in the area, and as in most hunting-and-gathering societies the sexual division of labor entailed that hunting was the foremost male activity. In some northern groups women assisted peripherally in hunting activities, particularly in collective drives. Chipewyan women typically carried the game following a successful hunt and were responsible for its preparation (Jenness 1956:22). But hunting was the domain of males, and because of the overwhelming dependence on meat in most areas, a successful quest for food depended upon the success of males.</page><page sequence="9">FEMALE REFERENT IN ATHABASKAN CULTURES 107 The only obvious aspect that hunting shares in common with menstruation is the presence of blood. at a semantic level, pollution, at least in the thought of the North American Indians, consists in too close a conjunction between two things meant to remain in a state of "purity." In the hunt at close quarters menstrual periods always risk introducing excessive union which would lead to a saturation of the original relation and a neutralization of its dynamic force by redundancy. (LUvi-Strauss 1966:52) Blood in the context of hunting had male connotations, associated positively with subsistence and ultimately with the survival of the population. If menstrual bleeding was associated with an excessive state of femaleness, it presented a contradiction of maleness and, therefore, was incompatible with the realm of hunting. One effect of seclusion and other practices that emphasized the negative association of mens- truation and hunting, or in effect emphatically dissociated one from the other, may have been to reiterate their distinctness at a time when a superficial similarity threatened to blur this distinction. This bears somewhat on Douglas's suggestion that concepts of pollution tend to be generated by a need to protect social distinctions (1966). While the cognitive incompatibility of femaleness with hunting does underscore a marked sexual division of labor, however, it remains unclear why this subsistence dichotomy should require such rigorous safeguarding. It seems evident that concepts of pollution in this particular area reflect a more general pattern into which the work of Harper and of Meggitt, discussed below, provides some insight. As in other realms, the female referent suggested in the tendency toward matrilocal residence and bride service seems to have had little to do with the status of women in the society. The female principle was invoked in this case as a focus of postulated relationships, once again with females as the media rather than the principals. Relationships among these practices involve their basis in a common aspect of the conceptual repertoire. THE WESTERN APACHE PATTERN The complex of phenomena appears as an alternative but recogniza- ble transformation among the Western Apache. Basso has described and analyzed the girls' puberty rite as held at Cibecue (1966), and it continues to be the most important public ceremony held on the San Carlos Reservation. The Western Apache ceremony is predominatly celebrative (Opler 1972:1145) and more elaborate than among the northern groups, influenced and enriched through contacts with the Western Pueblos and other peoples in the area.</page><page sequence="10">108 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH In this case the girl personifies a benevolent female deity whom Basso and others translate as Changing Woman (1966). This deity does not seem to be present among Northern Athabaskans (see, for example, Jenness 1955), although there are references to Chipewyan concepts of a female deity indirectly involved in the creation of the world (Oswalt 1966:25). In her identity as Changing Woman during the ceremony, the girl has the capacity to confer blessings and bring good luck, particularly to children and those who are ill. She is believed to benefit personally from the ceremony as well, and it is thought that her deportment at this time will affect her future life, ensuring good health, strength, beauty, and long life. As Basso points out, the sight of the girl in ceremonial dress is a deeply moving experience to Apaches (1966:150). The ceremony is of great importance to the society, a public ritual whose meaning goes far beyond a single girl's initiation to adulthood, Despite its continued popularity in San Carlos, not all girls undergo the ceremony. It takes place when the girl is about fourteen shortly following the first evidence of sexual maturity, but again she is a medium of a more abstract essence, which in this case has come to be personified as an anthropomorphic female deity. Merely reaching puberty does not invest a girl with the power to bless and bring good luck. It is only during the ceremony, as personification of Changing Woman, that this capacity is acquired, and just as in the North, the power is externally derived rather than inherent in the girl herself. She is passive in that sense, acted through rather than active. As Basso asserts, "In a sense, a girl's puberty is merely an excuse to invoke Changing Woman's prophylactic benevol- ence and bring good fortune to Cibecue" (1966:169). Below the shifts in emphasis and alterations of detail, the Athabas- kan girls' ceremony is still recognizable. Again there is no comparable ritual for boys, although the novice complex of the nineteenth century involving a boy's first participation in a raid may have filled an analogous function (Goodwin and Basso 1971:288-98). A concept of the acquisition of femaleness was also implicit in the relations between the sexes throughout the life cycle. During early childhood up to puberty, boys and girls played together freely, although there was some role differentiation at this time with regard to pretended adult activities (Goodwin 1942:539). At puberty, however, young people were expected to become "shy" in the presence of the opposite sex and circumspect in their behavior. This pattern was still evident in San Carlos in 1963 and 1970. At this transitional phase of the life cycle when children were becoming more explicitly male and female, social conventions emphasized their separateness. With adulthood this general</page><page sequence="11">FEMALE REFERENT IN ATHABASKAN CULTURES 109 avoidance was submerged in the more intricate pattern of prescribed behavior toward specific kin, but by then the separateness of the sexes in the social realm had already been achieved. The connotations of menstruation seem much less threatening among the Western Apache than in the North. Seclusion, where it was practiced, generally lacked the rigor of Northern Athabaskan practices. Scratching sticks were used, however, as they were during the girls' puberty ceremony, and any contact with menstrual blood was con- sidered harmful to males (see also Dyk 1966:13-14 for similar Navajo attitudes and Opler 1969:26 for Mescalero association of contact with menstrual blood and rheumatism in males). Yet the entire complex seems much less emphatic, the negative aspects relatively underplayed compared with northern practices, just as positive aspects in the puberty ceremony were elaborated. An analogous transformation can be seen in the context of social organization. The matrilocal pattern of residence became explicit, with the minimal units consisting of matrilocal extended families. Bride service as a formal institution was less overt, but in effect a man's taking up residence with his wife's family entailed that he would share responsibility for the maintenance of the group as long as it existed. Beyond this the Western Apache, as well as the Navajo, developed an intricate system of matrilineal clans (Kaut 1956, 1957, 1974). In the southwestern context the principle of relatedness through females, implicit in the North, developed into a full-blown matrilineal system. The social status of women in Western Apache society corresponds to this shift toward more positive connotations in the ideology and a more explicit use of relationships through females as a principle of social organization. Goodwin quotes informants as stating that women were considered physically weaker than men and less able to withstand the possession of supernatural power, and they were sometimes said to be less intelligent than males (1942:535,538). But in practice these asser- tions appear to have been little more than conventional cliches. Women, in fact, did wield considerable influence in the matrilocal extended family unit, which often constituted the basic political unit as well, capable of functioning independently. This heightened female status was supported by the structure itself, since women remained surrounded by relatives while men, initially at least, were outsiders in the unit. There is little or no evidence to suggest that women held a substantially lower status than men in their daily lives. Goodwin states that parents valued female children at least as much as males. Women even accompanied raiding parties at times, although this was probably a rare occurrence (Goodwin 1942:537). While the sexes were not</page><page sequence="12">110 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH considered precisely equal, or at least not equivalent, the position of women among the Western Apache during the nineteenth century probably compared favorably with that of Euroamerican women during the same period. DISCUSSION This analysis touches on aspects of Athabaskan studies that are far from settled. It has been suggested elsewhere that the Apacheans entering the Southwest already possessed a girls' puberty ceremony but developed matrilocal residence after the adoption of agriculture (Driver 1969). The weight of evidence, however, shows that many Northern Athabaskan groups in historic times tended toward matrilocal residence and bride service. While this does not constitute proof that such a tendency existed among proto-Apacheans at the time they departed from the Western Subarctic, its occurrence among these historically related, geographically distant groups is certainly important evidence. The transformation of other social phenomena with female referents would seem to support this. Vogt, through a comparison of Northern and Southern Athabaskan cultures, has constructed a descriptive outline of proto-Apachean culture that specifies uxorilocal residence (1961), and Murdock and Opler support the presence of matrilocal residence among Apacheans prior to their arrival in the Southwest (Murdock 1955; Opler 1972:1140). Further, there has been some controversy as to whether any causal relationship exists between matrilocal residence and girls' puberty rites (Driver 1969; Kloos 1969; Brown 1963). Without making generaliza- tions beyond the Athabaskan case, it seems evident here that matrilocal residence, the girls' puberty ceremony, and attitudes and practices regarding menstruation all relate to one another only insofar as they share a basis in Athabaskan concepts of femaleness. This divergent relationship to a more fundamental factor seems more salient than any horizontal causal relationships among the three. Finally, it must be allowed that no automatic connection exists between matrilocal residence and matrilineal organization. Yet in the Apachean case it has been shown that the precedent of a female referent expressed in a variety of ways existed in the North. It seems reasonable to suggest that this precedent may have influenced the direction of further elaboration of the system of organization when conditions allowed or stimulated an increased complexity of the social structure, particularly since the female concept has been shown to underlie Athabaskan concepts far beyond the mechanics of social organization. Thus far, certain crucial phenomena undergoing transformations in altered cultural contexts can be seen to have a common relationship in</page><page sequence="13">FEMALE REFERENT IN ATHABASKAN CULTURES 111 deeper cultural precepts. These phenomena show a dynamic persist- ence, altered but recognizable in different cultural levels, the transfor- mation rather than replacement of a previously existing structure. To this point, however, there has been no analysis of possible causal factors involved. One notable difference between the Western Apache and Northern Athabaskan cases is the difference in the social status of women as individuals. It was argued above that in terms of overt social practices the concept of femaleness, being an abstract quality, did not necessarily directly influence the status of real women. Yet clearly the connection exists. The problem of why women, being socially innocuous in northern societies, are vested with threatening attributes may find a partial resolution in Harper's analysis of a similarly low position ascribed to a category of women among Havik Brahmins in South India. He suggests that where a category of persons are ascribed low status, guilt may cause the projection of malevolence to them (1969:95). as their power is drastically curtailed, there is little reason to realistically fear them; thus, if they are to be feared at all, they will be feared in unrealistic ways. It may be that in societies in which the majority of disadvantages accrue to women, where the status differential between sexes is extreme, women will be portrayed as agents of destruction, particularly in the religious or mystical belief systems. This analysis may be appropriate to the Northern Athabaskan case. The positive shift in the status of women in the Southwest co-occurs with a dilution of threat associated with the female and a positive emphasis in other respects. The element of threat may also be clarified through Meggitt's analysis of male-female relationships in Highland New Guinea (1964). The prevalence of intersexual tensions throughout this region, with some variance in its expression, has been generally recognized (Read 1954). Meggitt suggests that where affines are also longstanding enemies, the connotations of threat will be projected onto in-marrying females and consequently become an aspect of femaleness itself (1964:218). While there may be a tendency toward intersexual tensions throughout Highland New Guinea, the element of female threat with its related concepts of pollution tends to reflect the tone of political relations between intermarrying groups. It is tempting to apply this hypothesis to the Northern Athabaskan case, since hostilities did occur among neighboring groups (e.g., Gillespie 1970), including those which sometimes intermarried, since both phenomena were affected by geographic distance. From the perspective of individuals also, the relationship between a new husband</page><page sequence="14">112 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH and his wife's family probably entailed some built-in strains, particular- ly where bride service was expected. Ambivalence in affinal relation- ships may indeed have contributed to the concept of female threat, expressed in attitudes surrounding such overt manifestations of femaleness as menstruation and childbirth. These two phenomena also tend to be focal points of pollution in New Guinea (Langness 1967; Meggitt 1964), supporting the idea that they often represent the most evident or extreme manifestations of femaleness. Among the Western Apache where the female threat was somewhat muted, ideal marriage involved a direct exchange system, with marriage to a member of the father's clan. While hostilities occurred among Apachean groups, conflicts among affinal clans were relatively infre- quent. Matrilocal residence clearly had its tensions, but these, as well as the threat of femaleness itself, appear mild in comparison with the northern pattern. Harper's and Meggitt's hypotheses do not necessarily conflict. Harper's discussion of the form that expressions of the female threat may take where the concept of threat exists appears to complement Meggitt's suggestion of factors that may stimulate the development of such a concept in the first place. Meggitt's hypothesis, then, may help clarify the differential em- phasis on threat in the Northern Athabaskan and Western Apache cases associated with femaleness. The cognitive relationship between men- struation and hunting was discussed above. Differences in the status of women in each case, however, involving economic and political rights as well as prestige and influence, have yet to be accounted for. While they appear to vary together in this case and may be, as Harper suggests, interrelated to a limited extent, they clearly are not synonymous and need not inevitably correspond. To deal with the nature of the transformation in status, it will be helpful to break out of the internal sociocultural paradigm and examine external factors affecting the system. In the North as well as in the Southwest, a distinct division of labor existed between hunting, a totally male activity, and plant food gathering, carried out by females. Because of the nature of the environment, however, female activities contributed very little directly to subsistence. Plant food does not exist in any great quantity in the boreal conifer forests or tundra. Hence the reliance on animal food was far greater than in other regions. In the Southwest the same basic division of labor existed. The most salient difference is in the natural environment. Despite the general aridity of the region, a myriad of edible plants exist and were utilized by the Apache. Several types of cactus fruit, berries, agave, acorns, mesquite beans, and various other wild seeds were gathered by women</page><page sequence="15">FEMALE REFERENT IN ATHABASKAN CULTURES 113 and constituted a large proportion of the diet. Their collection also demanded intricate specialized knowledge. Hunting contributed substantially to the diet as well, with emphasis on deer, elk, and a variety of such small animals as wood rats, but the overwhelming predominance of hunting so typical of the northern groups no longer existed. The difference had less to do with the absolute amount of game taken than with its proportion in the diet relative to plant foods. The Western Apache also spurned some potential game. Peccaries, fairly common in the region, were not valued as food, and fish were considered disgusting, an aversion shared with groups already inhabiting the Southwest when the Apache arrived and possibly resulting from their influence. The importance of predatory raiding to subsistence in the Southwest should not be underestimated. Yet here again the role women played is of some interest. Beyond the rare cases when a woman might participate in a raiding party, women were ceremonially associated with raiding in the context of the victory dance. Also, a complex of personal rituals observed by women during the absence of their husbands and male relatives was thought to have an effect on the outcome of raids (Goodwin and Basso 1971:267). Although the division of labor was structurally the same as in the North, the effect of operating in the very different environmental context of the Southwest was a greater emphasis on the female contribution. Rather than adopting a new pattern, a different balance was placed on the old, which in turn resulted in a series of reactive shifts in the social organization and belief system. The conceptual focus on femaleness as a crucial principle remained, but the connotations of this quality had shifted toward the positive. It has been suggested elsewhere that the greater matrilocal and matrilineal emphasis in Western Apache social organization can be attributed to the introduction of agriculture, in which women supposed- ly played a greater role. As Opler points out, however, this seems invalid on two counts (1972). Men played virtually as great a part in agricultural activities as women, and agriculture was never the primary means of subsistence for the Western Apache. It was simply added to the yearly hunting and gathering round, a supplement rather than a replacement. The relative exemption of argiculture from the sexual division of labor seems to underscore its superficiality. But beyond discounting agriculture specifically as a primary causal factor, one aspect of the argument does seem valid. Women came to play a much greater direct part in subsistence, still in their traditional role as plant food gatherers. The change took place within the traditional structure rather than outside it. As Opler points out,</page><page sequence="16">114 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH matrilocal residence is compatible with the high degree of specialized knowledge and familiarity with the local terrain required by the womans role in food gathering (1972:1143). Beyond this, the high proportion of plant foods in the diet and the resultant increased dependency on such foods would have made the efficiency of matrilocal residence all the more vital (Brown 1963). The relationship between the status of women and their role in subsistence has been explored through a survey of cross-cultural data by Sanday, who concludes that a substantial contribution to subsistence by women appears to be a necessary but not a sufficient factor of high social status (1973). In the Athabaskan case the underlying concern with femaleness expressed in various ways provided a precedent for the increase in women's status when the nature of subsistence shifted, despite the dramatically low social position of women in the North. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The practices discussed have altered together in the transition from the Subarctic to the Southwest. Taking the underlying theme of a concern with femaleness as a constant, with its attributes of power and independent existence, values of the social connotations of this theme have shifted in a way that suggests a structural relationship. The threatening aspects of femaleness have shifted from a high degree of emphasis in the North to low in the Southwest. Its positive connota- tions, conversely, have gone from low to high. The social status of women has also gone from low to high. Finally, the contribution of women to subsistence, which is the only factor directly affected to any extent by considerations external to the sociocultural system, has gone from low to high. This seems compatible with the findings of Young and Bacdayan suggesting that the severity of "menstrual taboos" tends to correspond to the degree of distinctness between male and female roles, which they refer to as social rigidity (1965:231). In the Northern Athabaskan case this sharp distinction between the sexes was manifest in the low relative status of women, which in turn appears to have been greatly affected by an interplay between the sexual division of labor and the subsistence potential of the environment. Yet this correlation is less than adequate for the Athabaskan case. Referring again to Meggitt's hypothesis, female threat diminishes in the Southwest with an apparent diminution of affinal threat. This in turn seems a partial result of the more far-flung, cosmopolitan network of political relations in the Southwest, with major hostilities being most frequently directed at groups other than affinally-related clans. Thus,</page><page sequence="17">FEMALE REFERENT IN ATHABASKAN CULTURES 115 TABLE 1 Shifts in Factors Internal Factors Northern Athabaskan Western Apache Threatening connotations + Positive connotations + Status of women + External Factors Contribution of women + to subsistence while female status and female threat may be seen as discrete phenomena, with the particular expressions of threat nonetheless related to status, both have been transformed in the Apache case through response to environmental factors. Taken as a complex of social phenomena, the female referents implicit in Northern Athabaskan and Western Apache practices consti- tute alternative transformations or culture-specific versions of the same basic pattern. The differences between these two versions appear to be largely the result of transferring from one environmental setting to another.
