<plain_text><page sequence="1">BIBLIOGRAPHIA Carl Hentze, Tod, Auferstehung, Weltordnung. Origo Verlag, Ziirich, 1955. Ip pp., LXIIplates. Since Professor Hentze has been pursuing the ramifications of the same general complex of ideas for a quarter century or more, his publications have come to be like progress reports. No single study has shown more than a partial independence or novelty. A newcomer, faced for example with either of the last two volumes, would find himself plunged suddenly into a bewildering new world, where the paths are very well trodden but criss- cross so intricately and run in such unexpected directions that he might well despair of ever finding his way. A truly adequate review could be written only by someone who had read, and pondered over, and remembered everything that the author has published since the early I930's. Indeed, the task could perhaps be resolved with full justice only by the findings of a seminar at the post- doctoral level, attended by a group of art historians, archaeologists, and cultural anthropologists, with experts drawn in occasionally from still other disci- plines. The present review has been written by an art historian with no special competence except in the Far Eastern field, and something less than a complete knowledge of Hentze's numerous books. Under the circumstances, it cannot pretend to more than a hesitant and tentative assessment. As his readers well know, Hentze's interest is in what he considers the basic ideas of primitive or early societies (primarily in the circum-Pacific area), and their representation in art. His characteristic method of demonstration is a barrage of examples, drawn from any available source between eastern Europe and the Atlantic borders of the New World, and from any period in which the early traditions seem to have survived. In an earlier study, for example, by a happy chance he was able to climax one line of argument by a photograph of a chubby Chinese baby, wearing a brocaded cap representing a tiger's head; and so presumably testifying to the survival of ideas that had shown themselves in much the same way on Shang jades and bronzes. A necessary assumption has of course been the diffusion of basic beliefs and habits out of their original homeland, Northeast Asia or early China, in one direction across the straits into the Americas, in another southward across the islands into the South Pacific, and in a less important third over the steppes to European Russia. Many of Hentze's examples have proved useful enough to survive from one book to another, like the fictional characters, say, in the Hommes de bonne voionti; and the most specific signs of the evolution of his theories will often be found in the changing uses that he has made of certain recurring monu- ments like the two famous bronzes of the Sumitomo collection, the drum and the tiger with the manikin in its jaws. The title of the present volume shows the result of a gradual shift of emphasis over the years. The author has by no means forgotten his earlier preoccupations, the phases of the moon, the power of water, the opposition of male and female, and so on; but all these are now subsumed under I45</page><page sequence="2">larger headings, under the greatest themes ac- cessible to the minds of early men: death, rebirth, darkness, light, and the ordering of the world. The present exposition begins with what has sometimes been called a merely ornamental motif, often found on certain t'ao-t'ieh masks at the top of the nose axis and between or just below the horns. With the aid of Shang pictographs Hentze identifies the design as a pair of hands on left and right, holding and offering a diamond-shaped object. (A newcomer to this sort of argument may be troubled by the fact that the bronze motif, unlike the pictograph, seemingly always shows the dia- mond conspicuously below the hands. The initiate will recognize that such objections merely reveal the limitations of the modern, rationalizing mind.) Drawing support, as in his earlier books, from the monumental study of early Chinese writing by Takada Chushu, Hentze adduces a number of ap- parently related hand-and-offering pictographs. One kind of object held, of crucial importance for his theory, looks in some examples like a football and in others like a vertically elongated diamond, with a small, roughly triangular finial at top and bottom; on Takada's authority, and so without argument, Hentze accepts this as an elaborated equivalent for the simple diamond of the t'ao-t'ieh. Its most important feature, for the present purpose, is its symmetry about a horizontal axis. The top and bottom halves are identical, one upright, the other upside-down. Each half is a container, a mini- ature house or vessel in house form. The immedi- ately previous study, Bronzegerdt, Kuztbauten, Re- ligion (i95 ), had developed this last identification in extensive detail, with results which are here summed up in a pregnant sentence: ,,Die meisten Bronzekultgefasse sind eigentlich Hausurnen" (p. 28). What I have called a finial, for example, must be the element that reappears in three di- mensions as a roughly pyramidal or mushroom- shaped knob on the lid of certain sacrificial vessels, particularly the square i. Its ultimate source is archi- tectural, a sort of extra skylight or smokehole roof on the primitive house (which in its own evolution may take on the value and the conventionalized shape of a symbol, and so survive-Hentze ap- parently would have us believe-as late as the rounded finials on circular palace buildings or temples visible in Peking today). The special con- tribution of the present volume to this train of thought is the emphasis on the representation of two houses, drawn together in a bipolar opposition. The upright house stands for the world of the living, the reversed one for the world of the dead. Together they constitute a cosmic totality, and by their formalized rendering suggest the later- developed mandala. With his usual tireless ingenuity Hentze pursues the theme of topsyturviness through a wide variety of other examples. He remarks first on the fact that the hands-and-diamond motif is used only on the masks of tiger type, since the tiger demon is also an ambivalent symbol, both devourer and cre- ator; and with an altered emphasis, notes that the t'ao-t'ieh itself may be set in both positions, up- right and reversed, on a single vessel as another way of arriving at a Weltbild. Two other main strands are woven into the de- monstration as it proceeds. First is developed the contrast between two other kinds of postures, the closed and the open. The former is that of the embryo or the corpse disposed in embryonic guise, with the limbs drawn tightly against the body; standing by a natural association for life ended or not yet reawakened, the obscurity of the under- world, the disappearance of the sun, the periodic I46</page><page sequence="3">dark of the moon. The latter, with arms and legs extended -the attitude of the creature on the Sumitomo bronze drum--stands for revival, un- folding, the act of reaching out toward life and light (A related contrast of dark and light is seen in cer- tain bronze figurines found from Mongolia to South Russia, which possess either a single eye, or show a shut, blind eye beside an open one.) It is this wide-open pose, incidentally, that was chosen, in obvious defiance of everyday experience, for the extraordinary Mixtec sculpture of childbirth used as a jacket illustration: the baby emerging from a shockingly realistic mother is open-eyed, and pushes out his arms as if he were beginning a dive. (He is of course the Stammvater, and she the Ur- mutter.) Sometimes the theme of light in darkness is rendered in this way by a reference to the act of birth; a substitute symbol may be a figure over- shadowed by a miniature roof, or even by a hood, signifying at once the house of the dead and the womb. The covering element here, even on the hood, will often be topped by what looks like the same sort of finial or knob as that stressed earlier. To enrich this side of his argument, Hentze has quoted at length a discussion by Herman Lommel of the ancient Brahmanical rite called Diksa, under- taken to win a magical rebirth. There the sacrificer was shut away in a womb-hut, and wrapped in a garment signifying the placenta. At the same time his personal rebirth was linked with the process of cosmic renewal. He remained in his second womb while the sun accomplished its course (curiously enough, by day rather than by night). In the dark- ness of the hut he clutched his offering in clenched fists; and so, the ritual books insist, "held the sacri- fice and all the gods in his hands." At this point Hentze's method of comparison achieves the sort of explosive triumph that has startled, or infuriated, his readers for a quarter century. The Brahman initi- ate must have symbolically held the whole cosmos in his hands as an offering, precisely like the figure or the affronted hands in the Shang pictographs. The second strand, developed out of preliminary studies made by Carl Schuster on "joint marks," deals with the curious practise of supplementing a cult figure with small motifs like circles, faces, open eyes or mouths, birds, and occasionally criss-cross patterns, placed on or near the shoulder or knee joints, or outside the body in their vicinity. Some of these stand for light (e. g. the circle, which is a heavenly body); for the criss-cross Hentze draws from his earlier studies the meaning of water, and hence the underworld and femaleness. To strengthen his theoretical pattern he retells a Tlin- git myth of a raven hero who was able to liberate the sun and moon, locked up in a great chief's house, by carrying them out under his wings and then freeing them in the sky. The armpit is the seat of darkness and concealment, preserved by the closed-in pose of the embryo; the raised arms, or wings, may liberate the hidden light as well as seeming to reach toward it. So a reexamination of the Sumitomo drum figure shows that under its wide extended elbows are big-eyed birds. The creature itself is feathered; its horns are those of an owl. It is the bird of darkness, like the Tlingit raven, out of which the light must emerge to fulfil the cosmic cycle of renewal and rebirth. An associated and equally bizarre symbolic practice is the use of severed parts of bodies, usually arms ending in spread fingers, which may be traced all the way from the Neolithic pottery of Persepolis past Kansu to the Americas; and which in Hentze's interpretation signifies at once the fragmentary states of the moon, and the vollige Umkehrung of darkness and lifelessness. 147</page><page sequence="4">Two directions in which Hentze's argument is finally narrowed down are of particular interest. His re- mark that the pictographic offering is both in in- tention and in shape a proto-mandala is elaborated with the aid of Cammann's now classical analysis of the meaning of the Han "TLV" mirror type. Hentze sees in the central square with its four pro- truding T's a motif so strikingly similar to the ancient Shang ya pictograph that the relationship needs hardly to be argued. The circle often found at the center of the ya is the entrance to the under- world; the stylized flower that holds the same po- sition on the mirrors conveys the same idea, water and the depths of the earth. The L's were intended to convey a sense of rotation to the whole diagram; they are the Han equivalent of the ancient "whorl circle." The architectural terminology familiar on Tibetan mandalas, the system of walls and gates set four-square around divinity, not only recalls the Han mirrors but is prefigured in Shang pictographs that show a city in ground plan in essentially the same way, with a gate pavilion protruding on each axis. A related experiment, finally, must be the early Japanese mirror-back design that shows build- ings in each of the four quadrants, facing toward the four directions (and so also incorporating the the older theme of upright and reversed house forms). At the end Hentze places an iconographic analysis of the unique human-headed ho in the Freer Gallery. The essential elements are first the horn type, which is not phallic; here he both recalls an earlier argu- ment with Karlgren, and criticizes the sexual empha- sis brought out by Munsterberg in discussing the same vessel (in Oriental Art, III, 4, I95 ). Instead, the shape is that of the round hut in which the dark, unborn moon is concealed (a dictum argued in extenso in Bronzegerdt). Appropriately, its top surface is stamped with the "whorl circle" that stands for the cyclical alternation of light and dark. The creature on the ho is thus an anthropomorphic version of the Pilzhornddmon usually shown with wholly animal components, and standing ostensibly for the devouring dark; though all such major symbols are really ambivalent, since the cycle domi- nates them and no state can be independent of its opposite. The snake body of the ho demon relates it to a Pan Shan pottery object familiar to Hentze's readers, where a human head, snakes, and criss- cross patterns combine to stress water and the moon. What will a hesitant and tentative review say of all this, and of the method of research to which it has added several new chapters? The estimate will be necessarily a personal one, to begin with, and as such will record an experience vacillating be- tween wide extremes of fascination and mistrust. One cannot admire too greatly the persistence, the thoroughness, and the imaginative resourcefulness with which Hentze has pursued his grand theme. Much of the strange world that he has recreated has a look of eerie plausibility. His long icono- graphical analysis of the various types of kuang vessels in Bronzegerdt, for example, is remarkably well-knit and convincing. In other instances he shows himself temporarily off guard, the victim (like so many others) of enthusiasm and the momen- tum of his own hypotheses. One can understand, for example, how the armpit could be imagined as the seat of darkness, and in that sense interpret the Indian myths of the raven-hero who carried away the sun and moon under his wings, or of the Haida maiden who always held two robins (birds of light) hidden in her armpits. But when the symbolic pattern is extended to cover the birth of the Buddha from his mother's side, it loses all co- 148</page><page sequence="5">herence (p. 75). The side and the armpit are as unlike each other as any of Hentze's other polar contrasts. Again, a long look at the Japanese mirror-back will, I think, show good reasons why it should never have been included among ex- amples of the mandala theme. The essential feature of the mandala is symmetry, and that requirement is satisfied by all of the author's other examples, between Tibet and Shang China. But the four Japa- nese buildings are all different; in the opinion of Japanese architectural historians, they illustrate the main types of structure necessary for a well-to-do land-owner, from the two-storeyed residence with a balcony and a sunshade to the half-subterranean storehouse. They are not likely to have had any more symbolic meaning than the little figures of warriors who brandish their weapons around the periphery of another mirror of the same period (and who are certainly not in part members of the underworld because they are shown upside down). In both cases the mirror form, with its rigid spatial divisions, was borrowed from Han China; but the Japanese, in inventing a new decoration, seem to have abandoned all the symbolic pretensions of the original in favour of a naive illustration of what was important in their daily life: landed property and fighting. Perhaps it would be possible to scrape away a few aberrations like these (assuming, of course, that my criticism is warranted), and leave the body of Hentze's argument intact. The example of the Japa- nese mirror, on the other hand, suggests a more fundamental instability. The surface of Hentze's demonstration is interwoven to a bewildering com- plexity with myths, descriptions of rituals, picto- graphs, and works of art or handicraft, drawn to- gether because of certain noticeable similarities. It would be an incautious reader, however, who failed to wonder how deep and how continous a substratum of research existed, to give the surface patterns true validity. Underneath the Japanese example, where even the surface is flawed, there is, I think, nothing. The author provides no further comment; and it would, indeed, be virtually im- possible to justify linking the Han TLV mirror design with its Japanese cousin by any common background of beliefs, Early Japanese mythology is extraordinarily poor in cosmological lore. The myth of the august Sun-goddess is not tied to an east-west course, or to periodic disappearances or deaths, or to the annual swing between the solstices. The moon is hardly mentioned. There is no sense of a quartering of the cosmos; or even of a world in any other sense than the aggregate of lands accessible from the Japanese Inland Sea, and lying, somehow, underneath the Plain of High Heaven. A major development in Hentze's recent research has been his attempt to provide a common archi- tectural explanation for a wide variety of objects, ranging in China alone from the bottle horns of the Shang monster to the diamond shape on his forehead. The details of his argument might be debated interminably, for they offer at once the most remarkable and the most intensely contro- versial examples of his dialectical method. Since the case was presented fully in the earlier Bronze- gerat, however, and has not been significantly altered or expanded (except by the concept of the twin "houses"), it can hardly be discussed with the thoroughness that it deserves in the present review. I wish to end merely by registering the personal opinion that there, on a scale much broader than the isolated Japanese example, both the surface pattern and the underlying structure of the theory are much too fragile to support any handling except the author's own.
