<plain_text><page sequence="1">Personality and Immortality in Post-Kantian Thought. By E. G. Braham. London : George Allen and Unwin, 1926. Pp. 246, Price 7 s. 6d. net. In one sense this volume is intended as a sequel to an earlier work, Prob lem of the Self and Immortality, which traced the same subject from Descartes to Kant. The author feels that many books on Immortality pass by a basic initial problem, namely, the nature of the self. And while psychology may be a very fruitful angle of approach, the core of the problem is metaphysical. The conclusions of this study, which may be said to form the third and last division, are briefly as follows : First, human personality is a unified system of ex periences which begins at a very low level but reaches a high degree of com plexity and value; secondly, the rational, moral and religious nature of the self unites in a "demand" for its infinite duration in time ; thirdly, the unity and stability of the universe, with freedom, is more adequately met by Theism than in either a monism of the general Hegelian type or a pluralism as in James. "This theistic view saves human personality from absorption into an Absolute and also delivers it from the clashing elements of an unsatisfactory pluralism wherein is no belief in a dominant unifying principle or person in the universe." (page 227) Of the monistic type the author gives a concise analysis of McTaggert, Bradley, and Bosanquet. Pluralism is represented by James and Ward. The critical portions of the volume are based upon extensive studies and the results are stated in extremely compact form. The net result may be stated briefly: The self is a real unified system of experiences that develop in time but is not of time. It continues to develop in a trans-mundane world. Such are the point ings of moral and religious experience. But in the end, this conclusion rests back upon trust in a God of love. Plato: The Man And His Work. By A. E. Taylor. New York, Lincoln MacVeagh, 1927. Pp. ix+520. This work meets a real need. Coming as this does from the pen of one of the greatest living authorities on Plato's life and work, and a lifelong student and expositor, it will be hailed with delight by all lovers of philosophy. No work of equal scope and completeness has hitherto been available in the English language. Each of the dialogues is analysed in detail in the light of its historical background and its relation to the other dialogues. Taylor has admirably succeeded in accomplishing the aim he set himself, namely, "to tell the reader just what Plato says," and not force any "system" upon him. And this he has done not only with masterly scholarship and a sure knowledge of the questions involved, but also in such a clear and interesting style that the average reader with a taste for philosophy but no great technical erudition is certain to find the book a very readable one, and an excellent companion to the dialogues themselves.</page><page sequence="2">SOME RECENT BOOKS 479 La philosophie morale de Josiah Royce. By Moses Judah Aronson. Paris, Librairie Felix Alean, 1927. xv4rl85. 25 francs. This lucid monograph presents the moral philosophy of Royce as the fruit of a specific epoch and milieu. The central theme of Royce's ethics is said to be loyalty, conceived as the fulfillment of the potentialities of the individual through devotion to a universal community, a social and spiritual order inclu sive of all rational beings. Thus the thought of Royce acquires a deeply re ligious cast. Now, even the political organization of America is an e pluribus unum. Beginning with an account of the solidarity of the individualistic Puritans in the church of Leyden, the author carries his theme throughout the life of the colonial theocracy, and exhibits the same motif in the Constitution of 1788 and in the thought of Channing, Lincoln, Emerson and Whitman. All of this, and what is described as the resulting philosophy of Royce, is set forth in terms too single and too simple, but the work as a whole, while of little value to technical philosophers, should prove interesting to the general reader. Purposive Evolution. By Edmund Noble. New York, Henry Holt &amp; Co., 1926. Pp. xi+578. $4.50. This volume, which includes, in substance, a number of papers previously published in the Mondst and in the Open Court, is an extraordinarily careful analysis of the problem as to whether evolution is a process whose results are attributable to the haphazard clash of forces and materials or whether it exhibits a principle of direction. "Are we to assert, as in the conventional view, that purposiveness can show itself only as an outcome of and as asso ciated with consciousness, will and life, or is not purposiveness to be recog nized in advance of these as the pre-condition, the very sine qua non, of evo lution?" The book carries as its subtitle, "The Link Between Science and Religion." This link is found in cosmic purposiveness. Now hitherto science has failed to recognize this purposiveness because, as Mr. Noble contends, sci ence has simply taken for granted the organism and its life powers ; religion, on the other hand, has clung to psychomorphic, even to anthropomorphic, views of design in nature, thinking of the latter in terms of man's experience of the way in which he impresses his will upon objects. But the cosmic trend, the author urges, should be neither ignored nor humanized. Meanwhile, "sym pathy with the scientific attitude should help potently to unify the religious outlook, still broken up by differences of race and denomination, just as sym pathy with the religious point of view should aid science in realizing the limitations of knowledge and the impossibility of regarding it as a universal solvent." Problems of the Pacific. Edited by J. B. Condliffe. Chicago, The University of Chicago Press, 1928. Pp. xiii+630. $3.00. During July of 1927, one hundred and thirty-seven influential persons from the various countries that border upon or exercise power over the Pacific met in Honolulu as the Second Conference of the Institute of Pacific Relations. Though doubtless well informed regarding their governments' policies, the members of the Institute spoke for themselves alone and thus exhibited a frankness and a freedom scarcely possible to anyone in an official capacity. These consideratons were strengthened by the fact that the objective of the Institute was not the enactment of resolutions or the direct exercise of political influence but was mutual clarification and improved understanding. The pub lished proceedings thus form a document of prime social and, indirectly, po litical importance. Opening statements give the outlook on Pacific affairs of each of the various national groups; there are summaries of round table dis cussions and thirty-three essays dealing with the most vital and thorny issues touching the national and racial interests in connection with the problems of the Pacific.</page><page sequence="3">480 THE MONIST Speech: Its Function and Development. By Grace Andrus deLaguna. New Haven, Yale University Press, 1927. Pp. xii+363. $5.00. Speech is here treated not as an expression of ideas but, to an important extent, as a phase of the organized social life, having the function of co-or dinating the activities of the members of the group. As regards origin, it is argued that "the change from arboreal life to ground-dwelling must have made a more flexible type of group organization highly advantageous, if not indeed necessary, and it was probably in serving this end that speech devel oped." Utilizing a behavioristic psychology in discussing the function of speech in the life of the individual, the author sees in speech "a further exten sion of the indirectness in the attainment of individual ends which has marked the development of intelligent behavior from the beginning. The higher mental activities?conception and purpose, memory and imagination, belief and thought?so far as these are distinctively human, are found to be closely dependent on speech. They are fundamentally social in origin, being due indi rectly to the development of conversation, which, it is argued, has the primitive function of preparing for concerted group action, much as distance-perception prepares the immediate response of the individual. Conversation is shown to have a characteristic structure, adapted to its function, and it is this structure which makes possible the organized activity of thought, in which it is reflected." The Scientific Habit of Thought: An Informal Discussion of the Source and Character of Dependable Knowledge. By Frederick Barry. New York, Columbia University Press, 1927. Pp. xiii+358. $3.50. This book admirably reflects the mind of one holding the office which the author occupies?he is Assistant Professor of the History of Science in Colum bia University. Very lucidly there is set forth, essentially from the point of view of instrumentalism, the logic of science and the philosophy underlying scientific method. This discussion is followed by an account of "The Nature of Fact," and then by a third section on "The Elements of Theory," relating primarily to hypothesis and law, the fundamental importance of mathematics in scientific theory, and scientific synthesis. Section VI, entitled "Scientific Hu manism," sets forth the role of science in modern culture and advances sugges tions with reference to the proper place of science in general educational cur ricula. The Science of Religion: An Introduction. By Lewis Guy Rohrbaugh. New York, Henry Holt &amp; Co., 1927. Pp. xii+291. $3.00. This book, though not without elements of value, is in fact not true to its title. Not only does it fail to offer any contribution to our scientific knowledge but it introduces, without regard to scientific method or to an adequate discrim ination between the value of its sources, much material derived from sheer speculation or from the devotional and historical literature of religion. The author exhibits an obvious concern to defend, through arguments of various sorts and of differing degrees of scientific and logical cogency, conceptions and positions of an essentially traditional character. Current Christian Thinking. By Gerald Birney Smith. Chicago, The Uni versity of Chicago Press, 1928. ix + 209. This book contains a clear and fair account of the present day Christian thinking. It lays a foundation with an account of the Roman Catholic and early Protestant thinking and is followed by a discussion of modernism as it first appeared in the Catholic Church and how it was dealt with there in 1907 by the well known encyclical letter. There follows an account of modernism in the various Protestant churches and how it called up opposition in the form of fundamentalism. The rest of the book is devoted to an almost enthusiastic but well stated acount of evangelical Christianity.</page></plain_text>
