<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Construction and Reconstruction of Ritual Space at Tiwanaku, Bolivia (a.d. 500-1000) Alexei Vranich 121 University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Investigations carried out in 1996 and 2000-2002 at the Pumapunku Temple Complex at Tiwanaku, Bolivia (a.d. 500-950) combined historical research, data recovered from previ- ously unpublished excavations, strategically-placed small-scale trenches, and three dimen- sional architectural and stratigraphic recordings. The construction, use, and subsequent modifications, substantial and ephemeral, to the Temple Complex span 500 years. This peri- od, the apogee of the Tiwanaku phenomenon, provides a theoretical case study of the role monumentality can play in the development of an archaic state. The Pumapunku Temple Complex facilitated movement of large throngs of pilgrims; it served both as a ritual gate- way to the city and as a theater for projecting a redundant and widely comprehensible message to arriving visitors through the use of facades and intentional alignments of sacred features. Introduction Uniform orientations (Janusek 1994), alignments with natural and astronomical phenomena (Posnansky 1945), and precise ratios determining ritual form (Protzen and Nair 2000) suggest that the ritual architecture at the site of Tiwanaku, Bolivia (a.d. 500-950) was built according to beliefs that assumed a unity between cosmological and mythical space. Close and informed inspection of the grounds, however, reveals walls built of impeccably cut yet imprecisely bonded stone, huge rough blocks, and half fin- ished architecture (Bandelier 1911). The incomplete and often haphazard appearance of Tiwanaku's much-lauded architecture has generated theories that earthquakes, inva- sions, revolts, deluges, and other sudden catastrophes an- nihilated the populace before they were able to bring their divinely inspired plan to completion. One early Spanish chronicler succinctly expressed this enigma, describing Ti- wanaku as a place where they build their monuments "as if their intent was never to finish them" (de Polo Ondergar- do 1916 [1571]: 108). Recent excavations challenge this "high moment-sud- den collapse" theory by hinting at a less cataclysmic but more chaotic history. Current evidence suggests that even as some monuments were at their apex and new structures or renovations were being initiated, old buildings lan- guished in various degrees of decay and collapse (Couture and Sampeck 2003; Isbell and Vranich 2004; Janusek 1994). Our research is an effort to understand this chaotic and complicated history of construction and reconstruc- tion through one monument at the site, the Pumapunku Temple Complex. Though initially planned along strict symmetrical principles, the complex shows signs that later modifications and the use of less labor-intensive construc- tion methods during the apogee of the polity resulted in a loss of precise symmetry. To the trained archaeologist wan- dering around the complex, the temple appears incom- plete; to the ancient pilgrim arriving for a festival at the site, it would present a carefully choreographed sequence of facades and vistas, creating an awe-inspiring architectur- al experience that embodied the iconic symbolism of the Tiwanaku religion. What at first seems to us a design flaw is in fact a conscious decision made by the builders to cre- ate a more impressive setting as part of larger strategy to at- tract and convert visitors, and ultimately to incorporate a diversity of people into the hierarchy of the developing ar- chaic state. Setting Located at 3840 masl in Bolivia, the broad altiplano val- ley of Tiwanaku is defined on three sides by mountain ranges and on the fourth side by Lake Titicaca. In the ap- proximate center of the valley lie a series of pyramids and platforms that mark the center of the ancient city of Ti-</page><page sequence="2">122 Construction and Reconstruction of Ritual Space at Tiwanaku, Bolivia/Vranich Figure 1. Map of the principle monuments of Tiwanaku mentioned in the text. The Pumapunku Platform is in the lower left hand corner (redrawn from Posnansky 1945 and Janusek 2002). wanaku, occupied from ca. a.d. 500 to 1000 (fig. i). A dense scatter of pottery, ash, and other artifacts covering 4 to 6 sq km shows that the settlement extends far outside the boundaries of the present archaeological reserve (Par- sons 1968). The monuments at Tiwanaku must have pre- sented an overpowering experience for visitors; even in ru- ins they inspired Spanish chroniclers to exclaim their grandeur. Today, it is difficult to imagine and appreciate the ancient appearance of monumental Tiwanaku. After conquest, Tiwanaku sculptures were considered pagan and were targeted for destruction. Over centuries, thousands of spectacular blocks from Tiwanaku's facades were carted away as far as the capital of La Paz to build churches, civic buildings, and private houses. During the massive excava- tions of the latter half of the 20th century, entire sections of architecture were dismantled from around the great monuments because they were judged to be too modest to have been part of the supposed grand design. Now a ma- jor tourist attraction, the reconstructed core of Tiwanaku gives the impression of a coherent set of spectacular mon- uments, all seeming to conform to an overall structural ide- al fully expressed during the period of the site's apogee. Nearly a century of scientific observation and excavation allows us to construct a more complicated history in very broad chronological strokes. The evidence indicates that the 26 x 28 m Semi-subterranean Temple (also known as the Templete), dating to the final centuries B.C., was the rit- ual focus early on, when Tiwanaku was hardly more than a local center of assembly (Chavez 2004). Its low profile and small interior space were relics of the city's early pre-urban history. Apparently the temple remained sacred, albeit heavily modified and embellished by the Tiwanaku people (Ponce Sangines 1964). Radiocarbon dates from construc- tion fill indicate that during the 3rd to 5th centuries a.d., the Kalasasaya Platform (fig. i) probably replaced the Se- mi-subterranean Temple as the primary focus of the emerg- ing ritual city (Ponce Sangines 2001). Original standing ar- chitecture shows that alignments were intentionally made to correspond with the movement of the sun. Fully exca- vated and woefully underpublished, the 128 x 1 19 m plat- form now stands as a heavily reconstructed monument (Gasparini and Margolies 1980; Ponce Sangines 1971a). Around a.d. 600 Tiwanaku underwent another trans- formation that dramatically altered the city's residential and monumental quarters (Couture and Sampeck 2003; Janusek 1994). The Kalasasaya Platform and the Kerikala Complex were selectively dismantled and superseded by the Putuni and Kantatayita Complexes, and most promi- nently, by the towering Akapana Pyramid (fig. i) (Vranich 2003a). The Putuni Complex is the most monumental of a series of compounds that were built during this period. Scholars have interpreted this raised platform surrounding an interior courtyard as a reception area where elite visitors were hosted and as a necropolis where sacred ancestors were stored in compartments set along the interior walls. More modest but conceptually similar compounds appear throughout the urban core and may have served a similar hosting function for family or ethnic groups (Janusek 1994). These compounds surrounded the new monumen- tal focus of the site, the Akapana Pyramid. This monu- mental (18 m tall), tiered, revetted pyramid was never fin- ished but was clearly used (Manzanilla and Woodard 1990; Manzanilla 1992; Vranich 2003a). Nearly one km to the sw of the Akapana Pyramid is the Pumapunku Temple Complex (fig. i). Set on the western edge of the site, the platform is situated so that its center aligns perfectly with the sacred snowcapped Illimani Mountain located due east (Morrison and Hawkins 1978; Reinhard 1985; Vranich 2002). Nearly all the primary Spanish chroniclers of the 16th and 17th centuries provide us with descriptions of this wondrous, though unfinished, building that sat upon cyclopean stone slabs (Cieza de Leon 1939 [1553]; Cobo 1990 [1653]; Garcilaso 1987 [1604]). Judging from the studies and drawings by later scholars (Angrand 1866; Castelnau 1852; D'Orbigny 2002 [1844]; Pentland 1967 [1827]; Squier 1877; Wiener 1993 [1880]), the architecture gradually eroded until the mid- 1700s, when we find the last reference to ar- chitecture standing on the stone slabs in Parada's unpub-</page><page sequence="3">Journal of Field Archaeology /Vol. 31, 2006 123 lished manuscript of 1790. Bernabe Cobo, one of the ear- ly visitors to Tiwanaku, was perceptive enough to notice that these awesome stones must have been part of a larger structure that he described as a hill defined by two well- made stone "terraces" set on a solid foundation of large blocks (Cobo 1990 [1653]: 100). These terraces (referred to here as revetments) were systematically dismantled to build the nearby church (Castro 1906: 211). The first plan view of the temple complex, made in 1848 by Leonce An- grand, places fragmentary remains of four concentric revet- ments around a U-shaped structure (Prumers 1993: 451). Quarrying for stone must have proceeded quickly because a plan made soon after 1848 illustrates the platform as an unstructured U- or T-shaped earthen mound (Stiibel and Uhle 1892). Beginning in the mid 1970s, excavations exposed near- ly the entire perimeter of the platform, revealing remains of concentric revetments and a wide and worn set of stairs on the west side. These excavations were for the most part unpublished or buried in internal government reports, but in 1989 architect Javier Escalante directed extensive exca- vations, and developed an up-to-date reconstruction of the Pumapunku Platform (Escalante 1994). He detailed the form and internal composition of a four-stepped, revetted platform with a sunken court in the center and, most sig- nificantly, in contrast to previous interpretations, he placed the principal entrance on the west side. Methods The fieldwork in 1996 and 2000-2002 involved a flex- ible strategy to contend with social, architectural, and bud- getary constraints. The highly politicized nature of the site makes any excavation a subject of public scrutiny (Vranich 2003b), while conservation guidelines make dismantling of any in situ remains highly problematic. The people of Tiwanaku, under no such constraints, tended to dismantle and reuse stone rather than to encase retired architecture. Therefore, a strategy of digging long, deep, cross-cutting trenches and tunnels like those that have been successfully employed in excavating the sequentially- encased monu- ments of other sites, especially in Mesoamerica, was en- tirely unproductive at Tiwanaku. To minimize the amount of new excavation, our field method consisted of a detailed laser theodolite survey of the topography and exposed ar- chitecture; re-excavation of hundreds of square meters of previously excavated but undocumented and under-pub- lished trenches; and expansion of preexisting trenches or excavations and profiling of looters' holes (fig. 2). Features recorded with a laser transit were rendered on AutoCAD and extrapolated across both unexcavated and damaged ar- eas. We also gleaned additional architectural clues by in- vestigating original ethnohistorical sources and early scien- tific studies. The Western Ramps Rising at a steep angle 6 m above the flat plain are three natural-looking ledges. While this area has been deformed by continuous agricultural usage during the last several centuries, the central ledge still maintains roughly rectan- gular sides, measuring approximately 100 m in length and 50 m in width. Although unexcavated, these ledges have the location and form to suggest that they once served as ramp -like structures, connecting the flat plain (generously labeled the Western Plaza) to the western entrance of the platform (fig. 2). The central ledge certainly appears to have been a ramp since it is aligned with the wide, worn stairs on the west side of the platform, but it cannot be de- termined whether the side ledges also functioned as ramps or instead served some ancillary function. We will hence- forth refer to them all as ramps. The construction of the ramps appears to be a case of re- verse monumentality; that is, instead of being actually con- structed, the ramps emerged when the naturally sloping land was intentionally carved away, perhaps to provide fill for the platform. The large ditch to the east of the Akapana is thought to have been similarly dug out (Janusek 2002). The central ramp doubled the height and impressiveness of the temple complex at little cost, and was, according to lo- cal informants, originally revetted with stone. Due to cen- turies of farming, there is little evidence remaining of the surface of the central ramp, but at its approximate center, there is a concentration of green pebbles identical to those used to pave ritually important structures nearby (Kolata 1993). Of particular note are two pieces of sculpture asso- ciated with the ramp: a monolith 2 m tall that was discov- ered face down at the ramp's approximate center (Wiener 1993 [1880] : 460), and a second, fallen monolith that was found below the ramp (Stiibel and Uhle 1892). Both monoliths have since been moved into the site museum; there is no evidence that they had originally been located where they were later found. Eastern Plaza Along the se corner of the platform, the clearing and ex- pansion of trenches excavated in 1978 (re-labeled B-7) (fig. 2) revealed an alignment of evenly spaced upright stones. These deeply embedded, upright stones have been battered and damaged, yet they roughly define a 192 x 143 m boundary wall around a raised platform or plaza (Cobo 1990 [1653]; Mesa and Gisbert 1973). Based on surface observation and local information, there appears to be one additional revetment below the platform or plaza, so this</page><page sequence="4">124 Construction and Reconstruction of Ritual Space at Tiwanaku, Bolivia/Vranich Figure 2.

Contour values refer to depth (increasing negative values) below the datum marked on the sw corner of the platform.

In 2000, the workers constructing a paved road to the site museum un- covered a large sandstone slab in the approximate center of the east side of this plaza, and we surmise it marked an ac- cess point. The re- excavation of unpublished trenches directly east of the large stone slabs (re-labeled 30) uncovered upturned segments of a finely built stone conduit. The conduit was described by visitors as late as 1790 as leading from the center of the slabs out into the plaza (Cobo 1990 [1653]: 102; Parada 1790). Also noted were two heavily damaged structures that consisted of small ashlar blocks, set on stone slabs, held together by small rectangular stone clamps. These structures have become too damaged to permit us to speculate about their original form or purpose, but an ac- cumulation of calcium carbonate on one side of these blocks indicates that they may have held water. The Platform The footprint of the platform is T-shaped (fig. 2), mea- suring 167.36 m on the west side, and 116.7 m on the north and south sides. The wings of the T extend out 27.6 m and are estimated to be 20 m wide. The initial construc- tion of the platform began with the digging of the foun- dation pit, which ranged in depth from 1.6 m along the edges to 0.8 m in the center. Six layers of river cobbles were then wet-laid in a fill made of angular grains of sand mixed with clay, which will henceforth be referred to as compos- ite fill. Putting regularly spaced cobbles in load-bearing fills is a technique commonly used to prevent the kind of slip-</page><page sequence="5">Journal of 'Field Archaeology /Vol. 31, 2006 125 Figure 3. Drawing of a section through the sw corner of Pumapunku Platform, as seen though a fish-eye lens, showing the three primary fills.

In the final layer, evenly spaced stones with flat surfaces (pad stones) were embedded in the fill to serve as contact points for the basal course of the first revetment (fig. 3). This same type of composite fill was used as a foundation for the platform's upper revetments, with each lower revetment acting as a retainer for the de- posit of fill of the one directly above. This type of fill ex- tends 15.5m into the platform itself (Trench 7). The base of the platform is revetted by three courses of ashlar blocks of uniform height, precisely fitted front to back, three rows deep (fig. 4). A much broader block of sandstone, a capstone, covers the underlying rows. Into a rectangular notch or step in the capstone course were placed a row of polished green andesite blocks. Along the south side, these capstones are visibly unfinished, and the blocks along the face of the revetment jut in or out a few centimeters. The eastern extension of the southern revet- ment is buried by composite fill of increasing depth; in contrast, the bonds and faces along the north revetment are precise, and the entire revetment is visible. Closed con- duits, built into the nw and sw corners of the first revet- ment and extending deep into the platform, drained water from the colored surfaces, described below, that surround- ed the inner courtyard. Set back 4.5 m behind the first revetment is a wall of regular coursed masonry, three rows deep, and up to five courses high in some places (fig. 4). The wall face is un- even; the blocks jut in and out randomly. Buttress walls two stones wide are set perpendicularly at regular intervals of 2.95 m (center-to-center measurement), interdigitated with the ashlars of the revetment. A few blocks and the pad stones embedded in the composite fill are all that we were able to find and record of another revetment further up the platform. Similarly meager remains of revetments are also present on the west and north side of the platform, and there are enough ruins to indicate the existence of two ad- ditional revetments. A fine outer facade made of precisely bonded stone would have been set approximately a meter in front of these surviving walls. Nothing in situ remains of this fa- cade, but there are two clues to its former presence and ap- pearance. A description from 1827 speaks of a single "colonnade" at the base of the platform consisting of reg- ularly spaced upright pillars and a crowning "cornice" (Pentland 1967 [1827]). Similar vocabulary was used to describe the still-standing facades on the Akapana Pyramid. We surmise that this "colonnade" was in fact evenly spaced upright pillars of the facade topped with a capstone. The missing capstones must have been levered off by looters seeking the more desirable and portable ashlars under them. The perpendicular walls running between the retain- ing wall and the facade formed compartments for fill and for the insertion of ritual objects associated with the con- struction of the platform, as in the case of the Akapana Pyramid (Vranich 2003a). This pattern is repeated up the side of the platform, with the retaining walls of lower revetments serving as the bases for the subsequent con- struction of facade walls. The engineering intent is clear: each inner wall carries the weight of the fill so that the fine- ly fitted facade is spared the forces that could have dis- jointed its carefully bonded ashlars. This effect would be of particular concern to the Tiwanaku who, unlike the Inca, went to great lengths to disguise the joints between the stone coursings in order to create the impression of a sin- gle surface (Protzen and Nair 1997). Soon after the 1827 description was written, the pillars were also removed, leaving only the upturned, large sandstone capstones. The</page><page sequence="6">126 Construction and Reconstruction of Ritual Space at Tiwanaku, Bolivia/Vranich Figure 4. View of the south side of the platform looking west. The arrow points to the pad stones of the third revetment. ubiquity of capstones discarded along the platform's north and west side indicates that at least one facade must have been in place there. The near absence of such stones along the south side of the platform suggests that no facade was ever built along that side. The process of re-profiling and expanding a deep loot- er's hole in the approximate center of the south side of the platform (Trench 22, fig. 2) revealed an interior of nearly pure clay too fine and homogeneous for us to discern any internal stratigraphy. A break appears 2.84 m above the base. Here uneven layers of clay and sand begin to level out before the first summit of the platform. Along this break was a thin but continuous burned horizon that produced a radiocarbon date of 1510 ± 25 b.p. calibrated to a.d. 550 (one-sigma range of a.d. 535 to a.d. 600). Western Entrance Along the west side, the revetments slope down at about a 2° angle on both sides of a large entrance. This in- cline may have served to direct water off the platform, but as with the bases of ancient Greek temples, it may have al- so served an aesthetic purpose- to counteract the optical illusion that the corners were bending upwards. This west- ern entrance consists of two sets of stairs separated by a paved landing (fig. 5A-C, fig. 6a-c). The first set, built in front of and below the base of the first revetment, is made of large overlapping sandstone slabs each 6.10 m long and similar to the ones at the primary entrance of the Kalasasaya Platform (Posnansky 1945), and to Tiwanaku- period temples in the Titicaca Basin (Bennett 1934: 460). The cut andesite stones overlying the first step of the slabs heavily worn along the mid-line seem to have constituted a repair. Our re-excavation of this area, (re-labeled 13), revealed the impressions, in viscous white clay, of missing paving stones (fig. 5c, fig. 6c). A row of large sandstone tiles along the center line of the landing leads to a shallow, sunken shaft, though a large looters' hole destroyed the paving directly in front of the shaft (fig. 6e). On either side of the socket are pad stones, and slightly in front is a large sandstone slab with an inset molding that must have served as a base for some type of column or jamb (fig. 6f). Only small fragments remain of a similar base to the south of the centerline of the shaft. The evidence is tenuous, but I suspect this was a niche enclosing one of the many dis- placed monoliths found throughout the site. The high con- centration of displaced, elaborately carved architectural el- ements in this area, including stone carved to imitate roof</page><page sequence="7">Journal of Field Archaeology /Vol. 31, 2006 127 Figure 5.

In his description of the Pumapumku, Cieza de Leon says, "a little ways off there was a small en- closure where a big stone idol is placed for adoration, and moreover people say that near this idol some quantity of gold was found53 (Cieza de Leon 1939 [1553]: 92-93). The second flight of stairs, made of andesite blocks, is defined along the north and south sides by rows of cut stone. A narrow paved pathway leads to an opening north of this wall where there is an additional stairway made of imprecisely cut stone, placed directly on the fill of the plat- form (fig. 5D). These stairs could have served as a side or service passage to the summit, allowing for the secret movements of people such as the costumed elite (Bauer 1991), or for discrete removal of offerings made before crossing an important threshold (Calancha 1972 [1639]). Interior Spaces of the Platform Excavations in 1995 confirmed the presence of a defin- ing wall and paved surface along the west side of the sunken center of the platform, and in the following year, we located the nw corner of this wall in Trenches 27 and 28. This wall consists of regular ashlars with the bottom two courses projecting into a bench or ledge. Along the outer, west side of this wall, we noted that these stones faced a large block, one of the regularly spaced stones that had, until late last century, been interpreted as the perime- ter of the inner courtyard (Castelnau 1852; Pentland 1967 [1827]; Squier 1877: 282). Judging from the many stone blocks carved with miniature doorways that we found in the looters5 fill, we surmise that these blocks were the cor- nice of this wall, and it was decorated with a repeating pat- tern of iconic doorways. Assuming symmetry with the well-preserved first revet- ment, we reconstructed the width of the inner courtyard to be 50 m (n-s); a similar e-w length would place the east- ern side of the courtyard along the steep incline that rises to the level of the stone slabs described below. Molded around the base of the interior courtyard wall and extend- ing to the back of the third revetment is a surface 5 cm</page><page sequence="8">128 Construction and Reconstruction of Ritual Space at Tiwanaku, Bolivia/Vranich Figure 6.

It is so well-preserved that only an occasional fingerprint from the original application mars the smoothness of the pristine surface. The only exception to this perfect preservation, other than the destruction in the looters5 tunnels, was found in Trench 12, where the later addition of a conduit broke through the surface. The corridor connecting the western stairways to the inner courtyard divides this sur- face into two halves, each inclined towards the west and center of the platform. Each surface apparently directed rain water to the heads of the conduits built into the first revetment. The north and south inner courtyard walls diverge at the mid-point of the western side in a stepped pattern, form- ing an antechamber to a 3.5 m corridor that connects the inner courtyard to the western entrance (fig. 7A). Though this area is heavily damaged, the remains indicate that the threshold into the inner courtyard was elaborately marked. A number of elaborately carved stones- andesite and sand- stone-were found throughout the looters' fill, including stones carved to look like roof thatch. In the corner of one of the fret-steps (fig. 7D) of the antechamber there is a deeply embedded stone with an inset molding, possibly the base for a column or jamb that supported the nearby an- desite lintel, 3.9 m long, found half sunken in a looters' pit directly in front (fig. 7B). A nearly identical and complete lintel exists on the Kalasasaya Platform, where its orienta- tion indicates that the carved iconography would have faced downwards, visible only to those passing directly un- derneath (Conklin 1991). When this corridor was filled in during a later addition to the platform, a number of thin, flat slabs averaging 0.35 by 0.80 m were evenly placed throughout the fill layers. Their form suggests that they are the remains of a corbelled vault, which might have been dismantled and reused as a fill stabilizer when the corridor and antechamber were retired. In front of the corridor entrance were the damaged re- mains of a threshold made of precisely placed andesite</page><page sequence="10">130 Construction and Reconstruction of Ritual Space at Tiwanaku, Bolivia/Vranich Figure 8. View from the south of the stone slabs on the east side of the platform. A) Alignment of carved stones. paving. Beyond this threshold, there are areas paved with rows of stones of uniform width running e-w. Predictably, the center of the inner courtyard was found to have been heavily disturbed. An intact layer of white clay document- ed in Trench 23, however, suggests the presence of a small- er nested courtyard, approximately 10 m on each side, set nearly a meter below the inner courtyard. If our site is anal- ogous to other sites with sunken courts found in the Titi- caca basin, a monolith would have stood in this central lo- cation (Arriaga 1999 [1621]; Goldstein 1993; Gutierrez de Santa Clara 1904: 528). Quite possibly the platform was conceived as a Ti- wanaku gateway; the upper corners of the colored surfaces follow the step-fret pattern of the Tiwanaku ritual gateway, and the inner courtyard, with a second nested court, is the point of entry. While the gateway decorative motif is found in a variety of mediums and sizes, all conform to one of three length-to-width ratios. The meaning of the gateway symbol continues to elude us, but this regularity of di- mensions suggests proper expression of strict ideas of form (Protzen and Nair 2002). Misconstruing these dimensions would not have been taken lightly, and may even have been tantamount to heresy. The Stone Slabs Earlier studies have carefully measured, described, drawn, and photographed the pieces of elaborately carved stone on the east side of the platform (Stiibel and Uhle 1892; Priimers 1993; Posnansky 1945). Although nothing of it remains standing, early references make clear that the shattered carved andesite, now scattered, once formed an enclosed and roofless space sitting on the rectangular 6.75 by 38.72 m area of stone slabs (fig. 8). By the early 1600s, only one gateway and a "window" remained in place, and these may have remained standing until the mid- 1700s (Cobo 1990 [1653]: 101; Parada 1790). Architectural studies have confirmed the early observation that both the andesite architecture and sandstone slabs were unfinished (Cieza de Leon 1939 [1553]; Snibel and Uhle 1892; Protzen and Nair 2002; Cobo 1990 [1653]: 106-107; Lizarraga 1987 [1603]: 193; Mercado de Penalosa 1885: 56; Ocana 1987 [1608] : 233). Since the first drawings and photographs of the ruins, the remains have remained re- markably stable. The earliest plan drawing documenting the platform, however, shows that a wall (now lost) for- merly sat in the spaces between the stone slabs (Priimers 1993: 452), and one eyewitness account describes in detail finely built "subterranean cells" with human remains be- neath the stone slabs, uncovered by looters shortly before his visit (Pentland 1967 [1827]). Our excavations in the highly disturbed area directly east of the center of the slabs revealed several upturned</page><page sequence="11">Journal of Field Archaeology /Vol. 31, 2006 131 Figure 9.

Evenly spaced pad stones to the west of the stone slabs confirm historical descriptions that this paved area was originally much larger; apparently it was nearly twice as wide, but only slightly longer than it appears at present (Cobo 1990 [1653]: 101; D'Orbigny 2002 [1844]; Stii- bel and Uhle 1892). Further east and at the same level as these pad stones is a line of carved stones (fig. 8a) that would have formed a composite structure of miniature gateways. Since some of these elements are clearly unfin- ished, we can conclude that this composite structure was never fully assembled (Protzen and Nair 2002). Aligned at least since the mid-1800s (Priimers 1993: 452), these stones are shorter, wider, and far heavier than the usual loose stone field boundaries. The implication is that they represent a Precolumbian opportunistic re-use of architec- tural elements either dating to the Inca "refurbishment" of the temple (Cobo 1990 [1653]: 105) or to the Tiwanaku period, when they might have formed a wall dividing the inner courtyard from the stone slabs. Definitive opinions about the architectural particulars of the east side of the in- ner courtyard and its connection to the stone slabs will have to depend on future excavations. Several hypothetical reconstructions suggest that a dou- ble set of stairs was built into the spaces between the stone slabs (Ponce Sangines 1971b: 251; Gasparini and Mar- golies 1980); such an arrangement would essentially turn the entire building into single elaborate gateway (Kolata 1993: 97). A variant of this reconstruction posits that a double set of stairs was detached from the stone slabs, and that the stairs led to a surrounding paved area (Kiss 1937; Mesa and Gisbert 1973: 179). What little evidence we have suggests that only limited traffic crossed the stone slabs. Unlike the heavily worn sandstone stairs at the Kalasasaya Complex and on the west side of the Pumapunku Plat- form, these sandstone slabs show very little wear. The var- ious graffiti are typical of later ages- Pacajes, Aymara, and Spanish (Ponce Sangines 1971b). One historical account describes statues set within the building on the stone slabs (Espada 1881), and an earlier reference similarly mentions "idols" within the building- perhaps a reference to the sev- eral anthropomorphic feline statues (chachapumas) that lay in the immediate environs until relatively recently. The same reference also adds that this enclosure on the slabs was where the Inca emperor supposedly sat on a throne and drank from an elaborate stone conduit (Parada 1790). This reference is a piece of oral tradition, recorded nearly 250 years after the last Inca emperor visited Tiwanaku, and therefore is deeply suspect, but it nevertheless conveys strong local sentiment about the importance and exclusive nature of this part of the platform. First Addition to the Platform The first of two major modifications was the increase in height of the platform, effectively transforming the interi- or space from a walled courtyard to a sunken court. Figure 9 shows the general progression of the form of the plat- form, from its foundation (A), to the initial form (B), to the first addition (C), and final addition (D). To contend with the weight of the added fill, a secondary wall of irreg- ular and reused stones (including a stone table in perfect condition) was built directly against the back of the finely</page><page sequence="12">132 Construction and Reconstruction of Ritual Space at Tiwanaku, Bolivia/Vranich Figure 10. East profile of Trench 13. The major layers have been outlined in white. A) Green surface; B) Sand layers; C) Composite fill; D) Accumulation of refuse. bonded inner courtyard wall. Then the green surface was covered with a 5 cm layer of sand, followed by nine addi- tional strongly compacted layers averaging 15-20 cm each (totaling 1.8 m). Layering, leveling, and compacting the fill into thin layers must have been a laborious construction process, but the advantage of this technique was that the fill was divided into horizontal compartments. Such com- partments reduced the chance that the platform might slump. The excavation of Trench 13 showed that the layers of sand fill from the interior and the layers of composite fill from the exterior were added alternately (fig. io). This method of deposition allowed the exterior and interior fills to overlap each other along their borders, functionally grading the stress-prone contact points. For the purposes of dating the construction sequence, we are able to assert that the composite fill foundation for the fourth revetment and fourth revetment itself were built during the same pe- riod. A 2 cm thick mixture of fine clay and red ochre extends across the entire summit; it covers even the corridor be- tween the western entrance and the inner courtyard, indi- cating that this passageway must have been retired at this time. The red ochre and fine clay quickly cracks when ex- posed to direct sunlight, so the builders possibly intended this surface as only a temporary stage in construction. Also at this time, a wide (7.37 m) staircase was built over the previous entrance to the inner courtyard (fig. 7c). The treads of the new staircase are overlapping andesite blocks, but the sides of the staircase are made of a conglomerate of reused stone. None of the tile paving from the previous an- techamber remains; in fact, the tiles must have been care- fully removed because the impressions of the paving stones are still clearly visible in the viscous clay. So little loose stone is present in the fill underneath the stairs that we sur- mise that most of the previous entrance was simply hoist- ed up and reused during this modification. The stairway on the western entrance was lengthened to reach the newly raised platform. Few of the steps are still intact, but the underlying adobe base ends between the two different surfaces (green and red) of the platform. Sur-</page><page sequence="13">Journal of Field Archaeology /Vol. 31, 2006 133 prisingly, these stairs must have been built directly on the sand fill. Such a minor short-cut in the making of stairs, which normally are built with solid construction tech- niques, is just a symptom of how fundamentally the origi- nal building plan had changed. The fourth revetment ex- tends only along the north and west sides. Along the south side of the platform, the composite fill rises to less than half the height of the north and west sides of the platform. The sand layers from the internal fill lie exposed, and they form a hollow where hammerstones, crushed andesite, ceramics, bone, and ash accumulated (fig. iod). The edge of the red surface is recessed a few meters from this hollow, and a defining row of stones, probably the base for an adobe wall, rests directly on the sand fill. During this phase all the revetments on the south side were incomplete. All these deviations would probably have gone unnoticed by some- one approaching the platform from the west; that person would see a tall, complete, and monumental platform per- fectly aligned with Illimani Mountain. Second Addition to the Platform The second addition completely covered the red surface. It began with the careful compacting of numerous sand layers, just as with the first addition, but this time within the boundaries established by the fourth revetment and the inner courtyard wall. Five cobble-reinforced fill founda- tions, identical in composition and construction to the fill supporting the exterior revetments, were built into the sand layers, indicating that heavy structures must have been planned to surround the inner courtyard (fig. 9D). Centuries of agriculture and erosion have long since done away with the final surface, and, in places, with at least a meter of fill. Though there is precedent for structures sur- rounding a sunken court (Chavez 1988; Hastorf 2003), we have only a general ground plan, so the purpose of such structures on the Pumapunku Platform is unclear. One re- vealing clue is the heavy collection of ash, llama bones, and ceramics found along the south side in the above-men- tioned hollow, and in stratified deposits along the base of the first revetment. These are exactly the places one would expect garbage to collect after being tossed down from structures surrounding the sunken central court. Perhaps food and drink were prepared or stored, or sacrifices were made and burned, in these structures. The presence of crushed andesite and hammer-stones in the refuse layer suggests that at one time stone blocks were being finished on the summit. During this second phase, the conduits built into the first revetment were retired, and a second and much short- er set of conduits, only 12 m long, was built at the same lo- cation. The foundation trench for these conduits breaks through both the existing revetments and the red and green surfaces. Their egresses are located at the top of the first revetment and at the extreme sw and nw corners of the summit. Each conduit consists, for most of its length, of a stone base and side lateral walls held together by met- al clamps. The head of each conduit, however, as noted on the better-preserved south side in Trench 12, was made of portions of the cobble and stone lining of the foundation trench. Though these conduits were incomplete, the fact that the later Inca occupants added canals along the north side of the platform indicates that the unfinished conduits were effective in draining the platform's surface. Unlike the previous surfaces (green and red), which had been angled to the center line of the platform, this new surface would have by necessity been angled towards the sw and nw cor- ners. Conclusion Goldstein characterizes Tiwanaku architecture as a series of stone enclosures, pyramids, platforms, and gateways di- viding and leading to important ritual spaces (Goldstein 1993). Manzanilla and Woodard add plazas to this de- scription (1990). Both descriptions characterize the layout, mass, and volume of the Pumapunku Temple Complex. This research shows that the study of the facades furnishes a means to understand how the structures were meant to be viewed, approached, and experienced. The use of fa- cades, or "show faces" is a nearly universal aspect of archi- tectural design from the pyramids of central Mexico to the Greek revival porticos on modern suburban housing. There are, of course, exceptions to the rule of thumb that less elaboration suggests less importance. For instance, there are the plain exteriors of the Moorish houses that mask a garden paradise within, and there are Indonesian Hindu temples where the unelaborated, small entrance serves as a misleading foil for the surprisingly ornate inte- rior. Both cases postpone the visitor's sense of awe until he or she is inside. More often than not, though, the tenden- cy is to present one's best side while hiding imperfections. It is not surprising, then, that generations of amateur, fringe, and pseudo-archaeologists have interpreted the ap- parent geometric perfection of Tiwanaku architecture as evidence of an advanced, and even extraterrestrial, extraor- dinary civilization with no practical relationship with the populace of the basin. A more carefully considered interpretation of Tiwanaku leads to the conclusion that these facades address an in- tended audience of worshippers. We surmise that the site brought throngs of visitors at predictable times for major festivals. Located on the western edge of the site, detached from the rest of the monumental core, the Pumapunku</page><page sequence="14">134 Construction and Reconstruction of Ritual Space at Tiwanaku, Bolivia/Vranich Platform was effectively a large gateway to the site. The most monumental, elaborate, and successively modified side faced away from the center of the city. Snowcapped II- limani Mountain, visible across the southern basin, served as a guiding beacon, and the narrowing valley would lead visitors to the Pumapunku Platform, where an alignment of its central axis with the sacred peak would create an as- sociation between the sacred landscape and an architecture imbued with symbolism. The structuralist framework within which the site is viewed as an earthly manifestation of heavenly perfection needs to be adapted to a human perspective. A more apt in- terpretation of Tiwanaku ritual architecture would be to view it as "festival architecture," a form of grandiose archi- tecture guided by what a person standing on the ground and moving forward through space could be made to see or not see (Bonnemaison and Macy 1990). Viewed from the ground, in a particular sequence and order, the setting appears to be elaborate, monumental, and complete, even though behind the scenes there are flimsy facades, mainte- nance works, and "backstage" areas for the actors manag- ing and choreographing the event. An analogy for Ti- wanaku ritual architecture would be the modern amuse- ment park, where visitors are guided through areas with fantastic architecture and personalities without seeing the flimsy backings of plywood and plastic, the work and maintenance quarters, and the circus performers managing and choreographing the event. This analogy, however, is applicable only to the architectural forms; attendees at an amusement park voluntarily suspend belief for a brief peri- od of amusement and are not pressed by the managers for donations of labor, tribute, and oaths of loyalty as the pil- grim visitors to Tiwanaku would have been. The alignment to Illimani is quite real, and the combination of enthralling architecture, corn beer, hallucinogens, and all other ritual objects support the site handlers5 claim that Tiwanaku had a direct connection with the sacred and required homage. Every complex society engages in some degree of pomp and circumstance, especially when it comes to projecting a message about itself. In the competitive world of Andean ceremonial centers, the ability to expand the "ritual catch- ment zone" (Shimada 1986) and thus to accommodate ever increasing numbers of resource-bearing pilgrims (Sil- verman 1993: 303) was a primary factor in the survival of a site and the prosperity of its elite. In a sense, the Andean city of Tiwanaku could be viewed as an overdeveloped and highly complex festival site that was permanently available but simultaneously dependent on continuous renewal and construction made possible only by high-energy, popular events. The resident elites built increasingly elaborate ar- chitectural settings to impress, enthrall, convert, and ulti- mately incorporate lower hierarchies into an expanding system that they dominated from above (Stanish 2000). Setting the stage for increasingly impressive architectural experiences that would instill a sense of awe would have been of paramount importance to the elites, overruling the fundamental Tiwanaku religious concept that symmetry and precise ratios should express ritual and cosmological form (Kolata 1993; Protzen and Nair 1997). The superfi- cial and incomplete aspects of some of Tiwanaku's monu- ments are often taken as evidence that a sudden disaster froze the city in mid-effort. These very same aspects can, on the other hand, be taken as evidence of the strength and vi- tality of an astute elite class carrying out its extraordinary tasks of modifying monumental architecture in order to ac- commodate changing tastes and of solving the logistical problems created by the large crowds they strove to entice. The fortunes and dynamics of Tiwanaku would be quite analogous to religious revivals or millenarian move- ments-any events that suddenly erupt, breaking long pe- riods of apparent stability, and then abruptly collapse. The rituals and festivals allowed Tiwanaku to outdo rival cen- ters in the basin and to attract resource-bearing pilgrims from areas throughout the southern Andes, but festivals are expensive, and ultimately they became an exponential drain of resources. As the major ritual center of the south- ern Andes, Tiwanaku held rituals that were ever larger, more elaborate, and more expensive, eventually straining its own logistics and resources. Struggling to match rising expectation, the elite held festival events wherever more food and beer were consumed, more precious fuel was burned to prepare the food and drink, and monuments were expanded and altered to impress and awe the arriving pilgrims. Though apparently successful for nearly half a millennium, this ever-rising demand may have been a con- tributing factor to the demise of the site.
