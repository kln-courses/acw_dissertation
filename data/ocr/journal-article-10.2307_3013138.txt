<plain_text><page sequence="1">The era of empire is over for the US in the Gulf. The overseas Arabian oil resource frontier is closed because that state has secured overarching control inside this zone. In comparison to the past, Americans now have little direct impact on the landscape and daily lives of the inhabitants of the Dammam-Khobar-Dhahran metropolis and its hinterlands. In 1893, the University of Wisconsin historian Frederick Jackson Turner traveled to the Chicago world's fair to deliver the most famous paper in the annals of the US historical profession. "The Significance of the Frontier in American History" turned "the fact of conquest" into the myth of pioneers settling "free" lands that nurtured and sustained the nation's uniquely democratic character.1 We read it to? day as a brilliant defense of empire, arguing the case for continued expansion by showing how America's core values Robert Vitalis, an editor of this magazine, is working on a book, America's Kingdom, on the early history of the US in SaudiArabia. Middle East Report ? July-September 1997 were threatened by the "closing" of the western frontier. These ideas became part of the common sense of the era as the US extended its domain over a widening system of protector? ates and dependencies?the Philippines, Canal Zone, and Caribbean?in the early twentieth century and self-styled pioneers?missionaries, adventurers, concession hunters, prostitutes, teachers and engineers?settled in the hinter? lands of the world economy. I thought of Turner as I landed in Dhahran, a place founded in the 1930s by a massive firm that had ventured from California to search for oil on the coast of the Eastern 15</page><page sequence="2">Province in Saudi Arabia. Like the nineteenth century set? tlers who propelled the expansion westward, capital pushed the empire's boundaries forward and the American state fol? lowed. Where leaders of local states secured recognition of their sovereignty claims after World War I, empire rested politically, if more tenuously, on gunboat diplomacy, inter? vention and covert action. The record of American oilmen and CIA agents in Damascus jointly "buying" politicians and coup plotters in the 1940s is a prime example.2 The era of empire?when Western powers conquered ter? ritories, when companies transformed countries in the pro? cess of controlling raw materials and could call out the gunboats to protect imperial privilege?is over for the US in the Gulf. This lesson was driven home for me by studying the role American firms and foundations once played in build? ing the Saudi state. The overseas Arabian oil resource fron? tier is closed because that state has secured overarching control inside this zone. In comparison to the past, Ameri? cans now have little direct impact on the landscape and daily lives of the inhabitants of the Dammam-Khobar-Dhahran metropolis and its hinterlands. Oil rents insulate the society from the indignities of foreign exploitation and free Saudis to exploit others, often cruelly. This new reality in the Gulf and elsewhere in the old pe? ripheries of empire is reflected in the decade old or more conversation about the contours of a /?os?imperial world economy, after hegemony.3 The emphasis on the power of the American state and leading sectors to shape global produc? tion, finance, security and information "structures" in which all other people, states and firms must operate in effect re? vises long-standing notions about how one understands and where one looks to demonstrate and contest the nature of "dominance" and "control" in an unequal world order.4 The best thinkers in this tradition are careful to specify how and why hegemony is anything but a synonym for empire and, more crucially, omnipotence. The debate increasingly turns on the nature of the limits to this kind of global scale, insti? tution-shaping American power in the face of capitalist ri? vals, competing models of capitalism, countersystemic movements and domestic economic decline in core industrial sectors and regions.5 The relatively recent rise of these ideas inside the more privileged quarters of the Anglo-American academic left and the rapid diffusion of terms like hegemony into the vocabulary of dissent since the time of the 1990-1991 Gulf War makes a short tour of what for a brief moment was America's Kingdom worthwhile. During the teach-ins and demonstrations at the time of the Iraqi invasion of Ku? wait and US counterintervention, there was little attempt to explain the meaning of the term hegemony or distin? guish it from older and discredited propositions about neoimperialism, neocolonialism and dependency.6 Public dissent in the US in fact revealed the remarkable resil? ience of populist themes against "big oil" and "the inter? ests," conspiracy (the war was for George Bush's sons' profits), along with classic anti-imperialist positions. Within antiwar circles, it was possible to dismiss the fate 16 of "a bunch of rich Kuwaitis" given the overarching need to oppose "the objective interests of imperialism." Today, the assumption is often that America's military presence guarantees control or domination of Saudi Arabia, its oil, its rulers, and its intelligence services. Readers should not let the return of the US Air Force to Dhahran obscure the significant and enduring shift in the geography and culture of power in the Peninsula. There is little truth in construing this moment as a sign of Ameri? can ascendancy in the Gulf or harbinger of some new form of colonialism. Those days are long gone.7 A weak and vul? nerable King Sa'ud had little difficulty in closing down the US Strategic Air Command base in the 1960s. There will be little cost when the much stronger king-in-waiting Abdallah sends the US Central Command back to Florida. The general thrust of this argument is strengthened if we consider the kingdom's enduring security dilemma, shared with many states that gained independence after 1945: the al Sa'ud is manifestly unable to secure its kingdom's contin? ued existence within the existing state system.8 During World War I, the future King Abd al-Aziz sought absorption of his domains into the British empire as a protectorate by treaty. His sons have not yet escaped the dilemma that binds their fate to the vicissitudes of American power and the world economy. Yet, no analysis of "the special relationship" has demonstrated any particular way in which Saudi dependency on the US seriously constrains the regime, much less facili? tates control or domination of it.9 As I discuss below, the Sau? dis continue to invest in those regions of the US political economy such as the Gun Belt that have a great deal at stake in keeping alive the idea that security of access to the kingdom's oil is vital to US prosperity. The idea secured the Saudis support against Egyptian expansionism in the 1950s and gains them an added margin of protection today against the imperial dreams of Baghdad and Tehran. The power of this particular idea, in the hands of the Bush administration's opponents, was the threat at the heart of the political calcu? lations that led to the return of US forces in Dhahran in 1990 and a war against Iraq. The Ghosts of American Camp The Air Saudia flight approached Dhahran from the water, banking sharply above the causeway that links the Eastern Province to Bahrain. During the drive from the airport, I began to match the landscape before me to the one drawn from extant records of life and work on the early 1940s and '50s oil frontier, which centered on the fenced-in Aramco com? pany enclave then known as "American camp." Recent retir? ees and the handful of third generation Aramco-Americans ("Aramcons") still working in the Eastern Province continue to refer to the sprawling expatriate housing complex and administrative offices of the state-owned oil enterprise, Saudi Aramco, as "camp." Thus, unaware, they draw on a tradition going back more than a century to the mining communities founded on the trans-Colorado border lands, the original model for Dhahran. Middle East Report ? July-September 1997</page><page sequence="3">It is in the world oil frontier of the Eastern Province where the American empire was made manifest. Oilmen and managers exported a system of race and caste segrega? tion to its zone of operations in Dhahran and the satellite settlements and pipeline stations. These were institutions and norms of separate and unequal rights and privileges, of crude racism and progressive paternalism ("racial up? lift").10 In going to Dhahran I harbored the slim hope of adding to the archive I have been collecting of the migrant workers, Arab nationalists, communists and tribesmen who mounted the demonstrations and strikes that began the process of overturning Jim Crow in the Eastern Province. The keepers of the official history of the Saudi-Ameri? can partnership today appear zealous about preserving the myths of the oil frontier intact. The American embassy in Riyadh recently celebrated the golden anniversary of the special relationship, dating back to the 1945 meeting be? tween Abd al-Aziz and Franklin Roosevelt on a US de? stroyer in the middle of the Suez Canal. The Saudi embassy in Washington has mounted twin enlargements of the Life magazine photo of the meeting, lit from behind, on the wall of its in-house theater. Kneeling between the two frail but noble chiefs is Colonel William Eddy, the Sidon-born and Middle East Report ? July-September 1997 Princeton-bred missionaries' son who translated for the king and FDR. A dissident history, pieced together from other relics of the period, casts images of the old days in different light, beginning with Eddy, who is remembered as one of Saudi Arabia's best friends in America, and the "only official who actually resigned" from the Truman administration in pro? test of its Palestine policy.11 The reality is that Eddy joined the CIA using the cover of Aramco "advisor" in Dhahran and Beirut in the '40s and '50s. More important, his own secret reporting to Washington on the famous Saudi workers' strike of 1953 contrasted the "primitive land of low pay, slaves, eu? nuchs, and harems to the comfortable conditions of US resi? dents in Dhahran."12 Decades later, Saudi Aramco's public relations staff con? tinues to censor material that even hints at the racial dis? crimination and other forms of injustice that workers once faced in the Eastern Province. The reasons are clearly spelled out in the archives: the country's own labor policies are vul? nerable to similar criticisms.13 In private, officials with the firm recalled for me the period when they still had to drink from fountains in American camp, designated for Saudis only. Others complained that, given the way Americans once 17</page><page sequence="4">treated Saudis, the kingdom's labor policies receive far too much scrutiny. The transformations in the oil market in the 1970s asso? ciated with OPEC are well known. Western multinationals gave up their control of the producing companies like Aramco, which is now owned by the Saudi state, along with the phe? nomenal oil rents produced by the price rises of past decades. These changes in turn altered many dimensions of the US- Saudi relationship if not the global position of the US "hegemon." Even those dissenting theorists like Bromley, who caution against exaggerating the extent of decline of Ameri? can power in the world economy, recognize these shifts. Firms lost the capacity to call out the gunboats to protect them from expropriation, and geostrategists lost the means for direct control of the region's resources. From Nixon on, Ameri? can administrations have confronted the reality of sharply reduced leverage over Saudi rulers.14 The story of the dismantling of the Jim Crow system in Dhahran is part of the same era of momentous change in the world economy, the equivalent of decolonization in the Saudi case, which was effectively completed with the "transfer of (Aramco's) power" to the al Sa'ud and its agents.15 Nonethe? less, the story has no place in the kingdom's public history today. The many Saudis and migrant laborers who built the oil industry and transformed the landscape are invisible to visitors of Dhahran's new interactive "Saudi Aramco Exhibit." There are no photos of the king's visit to Aramco when he was besieged by protesting workers, or of the first Saudi oil minister, Abdallah Tariki, Aramco's greatest foe whose alli? ance with the Venezuelans paved the way for OPEC, or of the wild pro-Nasser demonstrations in Dammam, or of the posters of Abd al-Karim Qassim that circulated throughout the Shi'a community on the heels of the 1958 Iraqi revolu? tion. TJthman, a businessman and intellectual in his forties, knew of my interest in the social history of the Eastern Prov? ince. He worked for Aramco in the 1960s and '70s, and was, together with a large cohort of Saudi technocrats, the benefi? ciary of the labor struggles that led the Americans to begin serious education and training programs for Saudis, which is a key part of Jim Crow's end. His account of the contours of the post-frontier political economy echo Turner's influen? tial ideas about "sections" in America. The Eastern Province's oil resources continue to be drained by the rulers of the kingdom's dominant, central region, Najd. The east's large (40 percent) Shi'a minority, whom American officials describe as "second class citizens" in Saudi Arabia, pay the combined price of the weak oil market, tense relations with Iraq and Iran, and a dictator? ship that is brutally crude and direct about exacting com? pliance. Forthright about the opportunities accorded him by Aramco's late affirmative action policies ("Saudization") that made it relatively easy for his generation to tolerate waning American prejudices, 'Uthman saw corruption and parochialism on the rise in the oil sector, and a decline in the education system that the Americans had eventually built to protect their investment. A View From Riyadh The authority of Najd, underpinned by oil rents, is thus se? cure. Incorporation of the once independent state of Hijaz on the west coast came at the expense of the tribes and towns? people of the east. In marked contrast, however, to other ex- frontier zones and colonies, the landscape of the Eastern Province today has little in common with the Canal Zone, the Philippines and other places where Americans can still act like colonialists on the beaches and in the nightclubs, brothels and AID missions. In Riyadh, US representatives work in a fortress on the city's outskirts, in a quarter reserved for embassies. The arms dealers, bankers, brokers and ex-CIA agents turned consult? ants who represent US investors in the kingdom lease homes and live in compounds scattered across the sprawling me? tropolis. A handful have lived there long enough to be able to chart the capital's remarkable expansion, decade by decade, shopping mall by shopping mall. For most Americans, how? ever, a sense of history barely exists. "Saudi Arabia is a society in transition." This cliche was offered up by a senior embassy official to explain current opposition to the regime. "King Fahd is laying the founda? tions of a modern economy," he said, against the resistance of an "atavistic culture." Thus, a piece of vintage 1950s mod? ernization theory was dusted off once again by someone who seemed unaware that dozens of his predecessors had the same to say about kings Abd al-Aziz and Sa'ud in the '50s, Feisal in the '60s, and Khalid in the '70s, with the transition never complete. It might have been worse, with the nonsense about "eastern cultures" dragged out, as General Burford Peay III, head of the United States Central Command, did recently to explain the failure of security in Dhahran: "Saudis...have a different sense of time."16 American embassy analysts are, predictably, much bet? ter at deflating the ideological pretensions of the Fahd regime than at recognizing their own, as was clear in their accounts of rising unemployment among the kingdom's 20-something generation. This new cohort is growing resentful after 13 post oil-boom years of chronic budget deficits and the undiminished rapaciousness of the multitude of princes. The king's proposed solution is to turn Saudi Arabia's welfare state into a workfare economy. The government says it looks to private inves? tors to create jobs, following the old Aramco example, for the large numbers of unemployed graduates described by American officials as "products of a closed, rigid and torpid education system." As a result, no rational busi? ness enterprise will pay to hire them. The kingdom is far from the point where its subjects will be driven once more to accept work in the areas where jobs are plentiful and growing, as domestics, taxi drivers, and the like. The kingdom does subsidize jobs: in the US, through the $60 billion in US weapons and support services or? dered by the house of Sa'ud between 1990 and 1995.17 For the region known as the Gun Belt, the Persian Gulf represents a critical market at a time of crisis in the arms Middle East Report ? July-September 1997</page><page sequence="5">industry. These enormous orders mean more than just jobs and therefore votes for politicians or a way to cushion the pain while the Clinton administration over? sees the consolidation of the new weapons and aerospace megafirms such as Lockheed Martin and Boeing-McDonnell Douglas.18 Sales to Saudi Arabia and other foreign clients have kept whole production lines running?for example, the M- 1 tank?which lowers the price of equipment the Pentagon needs for its worldwide forces. American officials are candid about the weapons themselves be? ing useless for the kingdom's de? fense. The expatriates who sell Saudis planes and tanks by the shipload say the same thing. "The Saudis can't use and don't need what they buy," one executive in Riyadh said during dinner, deliv? ering the punchline with pinpoint accuracy; "Ours are the exception, of course." Defense industry people anchor the US business commu? nity in Riyadh today, flanked by the transnational banks and ser? vices and technology exporters such as AT&amp;T, General Electric and Bechtel. Princes and other entrepreneurs benefit as middlemen and brokers in these deals. Meanwhile the op? position grumbles and opposition watchers in Washing? ton wring their hands about the crisis looming on the horizon when the regime is forced to choose between guns and butter. Note: "Makkah" and "Ma Fighting the Next Oil War Led by Exxon and Chevron, the old owners of the Aramco oil concession remain fixtures of the Saudi oil and petrochemi? cals sectors, competing for licensing and management deals. It is a far cry, however, from the 1940s and '50s when Aramco was in effect the kingdom's public works agency and oil min? istry and America's private diplomatic and intelligence op? eration rolled into one. An American ambassador once described the firm as "an octopus whose tentacles have ex? tended into almost every domain and phase of the economic life of Saudi Arabia."19 Back then, it was also relatively easy to see through the private interests behind the sudden dis? covery of a strategic interest in Middle East oil, an idea that some US officials apparently came to believe in as they man? aged the transfer of millions in rents to Aramco's owners.20 Decades later, it is virtually impossible to find dissent from this common sense view that US security and prosperity are Middle East Report ? July-September 1997 inextricably bound up with access to the Gulf s oil resources. The Pentagon for one is deeply invested in defense of this interpretation of the national interest as part of its own post-cold war survival strategy. The proposition that markets can be relied on to supply the industrial sectors of the west with their energy needs at reasonable costs, without the need for troops, is a serious threat to its inter? ests. US forces instead remain in place in the Gulf to wage the continuing war against Iraq, deter other hypothetical invaders looming over the horizon, and not least, secure the defense budget. In the wake of the Riyadh and Khobar Towers bomb? ings, the instincts of the commanders in the Gulf is to draw in the wagons: lauding American commitments and sacrifices, grumbling about their Saudi partners, and blus? tering about what they will do when they finally find the enemy.21 Military officials reportedly want to dig in, "plan? ning for a 20-to-50-year deployment in the Gulf," accord? ing to a Senate delegation that traveled to the kingdom in January.22 But opposition to the hundreds of million dol? lars that the US military is spending on hundreds of daily sorties this year is not confined to groups inside the king? dom, as can be seen for instance in a recent Foreign Af? fairs article and in the mounting criticism inside Congress.23 19</page><page sequence="6">Trail of Tears Today's accounts of American dominance and hegemony of the Gulf and the wider Middle East, at best, leave to others the hard work of clarifying the meaning of these terms, dem? onstrating their consequences, testing these assumptions and specifying their limitations. At worst, in the zeal to advance the opposition project, they can distort reality as fully and as recklessly as any of the ideas of those intellectuals of state? craft who Chomsky exposes to withering criticism.24 Thus, Saudi arms purchases after the Gulf War may be miscast as proof of the continuing economic returns to American con? trol.25 Nonetheless, the royal family invests in military in? dustries from Baltimore to Seattle to shore up support for its interests and shape outcomes in Washington. The fissures that continue to divide sectors and regions in the US over how to define and pursue their conflicting regional and glo? bal interests create the space for the Saudis' leverage, but they also create problems for those who imagine the presence of the Americans in the Gulf today as the fulfillment of long pent up desires.26 The exercise of power and privilege, too, looks less formidable on the ground than we might imagine given a 20 recently achieved "total American hegemony over the Middle East."27 On my last day in Riyadh I met four bored and frustrated mechanics from Chicago wandering the halls of the Riyadh Sheraton. They service the armored cars that are now de rigueur in American diplomatic posts on a more or less per? manent world tour, from the White House on to Athens, Cairo, the Gulf, Manila. The new "borderless" world that excites New York Times editors, software companies and university presi? dents makes little sense to the armored car crew or to the US troops encamped in al-Kharj and Escon Village outside Riyadh. The military forces in the Gulf are a constant reminder that the Pax Americana remains open to continuous challenge and reversal. Behind the hyperbole of Desert Storm's technologi? cal wizardry are the exposes of billions paid for unreliable weapons systems, the rusting hulk of the Nixon Doctrine, and failed covert actions to overthrow Saddam Hussein.28 The beginnings of the special relationship with Saudi Arabia and America's late expansionist project in the Middle East date to the pre-World War II era. This was a time when oil had not yet become synonymous with national security and the White House worked overtime to finesse use of public funds to Middle East Report ? July-September 1997</page><page sequence="7">subsidize the US investors that held the vast concession in the eastern province of al-Hasa. Then it was conventional in? side American intellectual circles to argue?against the facts of territorial conquest, the naked brutalization of peoples, the control of local resources and the denial of nations' sovereign rights?that America did not have an empire. Decades later, the metaphors of dominion, dependency and imperialism no longer seem to make sense of the role played by American firms or state agencies in Saudi Arabia or in the world economy more generally. I may be wrong. "Globalization" may mean ordinary Saudis are misled about their real inter? ests while the ruling family serves its "master" in the North. Shopping malls in al-Khobar could possibly represent a new, more potent and insidious form of neocolonial domination and control. More likely, we will be left to deal with the power? ful exceptionalist myth at the heart of many radical ac? counts of America standing outside history: an empire that never ends.29 ? Author's Note I traveled to Saudi Arabia in December 1996 as a Malone Fellow, a program lavishly subsidized by the Saudi Chamber of Commerce in Riyadh and arranged by the National Council on US-Arab Relations. It is hardly necessary to stress that the views expressed here are generally not those of the sponsoring organizations. A condition of the Malone program is that all official meetings are off-the-record and so sources of all quotations must remain unidentified. But my long and instructive conversations with two friends and colleagues on the trip, Ibrahim Abu Rabi and Elizabeth Fernea, are freely and pleasurably acknowledged. In addition, Sheila Carapico, Eleanor Doumato, Greg Gause, Ellis Goldberg, lisa Hajjar, Gwenn Okruhlik, Roger Owen, Joe Stork, Peter Trubowitz and Lisa Wedeen have helped with some of the ideas, even when they disagreed with them.

Yemenis have seen a Saudi hand-though it is unclear whether it is the hand of the state, or private individuals-in every event in recent Yemeni history. The prospect of a populous, unified, republican Yemen has long been anathema to Saudi Arabia. Saudi dissidents applaud Yemen's republican model and parliamentary elections (including female participation) as a positive example for Saudi Arabia while Riyadh continues to press territorial claims in the now oil-producing eastern and southern re- gions of Marib, Shabwa and Hadramawt (see map on page 23). If, from the Potomac, the Peninsula looks like America's Arabia, in the bright sun of this subcontinent the giant casts a faint shadow. Much has happened before and since 1991 that warns us against assuming that political arrangements are either traditional or permanent. Boundaries and fun- damental questions of statehood and citizenship are unre- solved. Oil economies and especially the Yemeni labor reserve are in retrenchment, and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) regimes are in a paradoxical relationship with the West-open to its military, closed to its scrutiny. These contradictions intersect with underlying social, class, political, and generational forces in the cities, deserts and farm communities of Arabia in complex, multifaceted ways. In this issue of Middle East Report, we offer some insights into some of these dynamics. -Sheila Carapico POSITION OPENING Continued from Vitalis on page 21.

Lesser, "Persian Gulf Myths," Foreign Affairs 76, 3 (May/June 1997); Chattanooga Times, March 31, 1997. 24 On the importance of Chomsky's project and a trenchant critique of his ideas see Joshua Cohen and Joel Rogers, "Knowledge, Morality and Hope: The Social Thought of Noam Chomsky," New Left Review 187 (May, 1991), p. 5. Those who seek to emulate his style would do well to review the 30-year-old arguments about the tendency inside the then new left to critique official ideologies of the US state and then go on to construct a mirror image of its world order: one evil empire (allegedly more hypocritical than other states in history) and its clients against all those whose real preferences and interests at critical junctures like the Gulf War are transparent from, say, their speeches at the United Nations. 25 See for example Michel Moushabeck and Phyllis Bennis,"Looking North: The New Challenge to the South," p. xvii, in Altered States. 26 "Since 1973 the United States has wanted a physical presence in the Persian Gulf... Saddam Hussein became the perfect target and the best excuse to move in." Edward Said, "Thoughts on a War: Ignorant Armies Clash by Night," in Phyllis Bennis and Michel Moushabeck, Beyond the Storm:A Gulf Crisis Reader (New York: Olive Branch Press, 1991), p. 1. For the errors in these kinds of anthropomorphic reading through the most rigorous accounting to date of the sectional conflicts and interests behind what "the US" needs and desires, see Peter Trubowitz, Defining the National Interest (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1997). 27 Naseer Aruri, "On Beinin's Review," Middle East Report 203 (Spring 1997), p. 47, recapitulating the major claims of his book The Obstruction of Peace (original review and publication details in Middle East Report 201 (Fall 1996), pp. 45-47). 28 Theodore Draper, "Is the CIA Necessary," New York Review of Books 44, 13 (August 14, 1997). 29 "The sources of myth-making lie in our capacity to make and use metaphors, by which we attempt to interpret a new and surprising experience or phenomenon by noting its resemblance to some remembered thing or happening. If the metaphor proves apt, we will be inclined to treat the new phenomenon as a recurrence of the old...if the match is disappointing, we will be forced to choose between denying the importance of the new experience and revising our symbolic vocabulary," Richard Slotkin, Gunfighter Nation: The Myth of the Frontier in Twentieth- Century America (New York: Harper Collins, 1992), pp. 6-7.
