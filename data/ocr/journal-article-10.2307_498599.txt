<plain_text><page sequence="1">EXCAVATIONS AT TROY, 19371 PLATES XIX-XX THE excavations at Troy, conducted by the archaeological expedition of the Uni- versity of Cincinnati, were resumed during the spring and summer of 1937 in a sixth campaign, extending from April 1 to August 6. As noted in preceding reports 2 the expedition was organized through the initiative of Professor W. T. Semple, Head of the Department of Classics in the University of Cincinnati, and Mrs. Semple, who secured the original concession in 1931 and who have since that time made possible the annual continuation of the enterprise. In presenting this report on the results of our sixth season of labor we take pleasure in recalling our indebtedness to the Ger- man Archaeological Institute, which courteously gave up its rights to the site in our favor and which has uniformly supported and encouraged our work. Likewise we still bear in mind our especial obligation to Professor Dtirpfeld, whose cordial assist- ance has been constantly available from the inception of our undertaking and who has taught us much of what we know about Troy. To the particular gratification of all the members of the expedition, Dr. Dirpfeld was again able to spend a few days with us this year and to discuss with us on the spot some of the chief difficulties of the site; and, although our views are not identical on certain chronological details, we are happy to record our essential agreement on all major problems of stratifica- tion. The season of 1937 was devoted to intensive work in and about the acropolis, digging, trenching and soundings being carried out in more than 40 separate places. Everywhere a painstaking effort was made to observe the stratification; all the ma- terial brought to light was carefully collected -potsherds, bones, and all other ob- jects -and they were kept separate not only according to the place of finding, but according to their stratigraphic position in the deposit. I mention this in order to 1 The regular staff of the expedition comprised Professor and Mrs. Semple, John L. Caskey, Lewey T. Lands, Dorothy Rawson, Marion Rawson, Dr. Jerome Sperling, Cedric G. Boulter, and C. W. Blegen, Field Director. Mrs. C. W. Blegen and Mrs. B. H. Hill assisted during the greater part of May and early June; Professor G. Karo participated in our work from May 22 to June 4; and Dr. B. H. Hill collaborated with us from June 18 to July 10. From April 1 to May 7 we had the assistance of a zoSlo- gist, N. G. Gejvall, who made a study of the animal bones found in the course of our excavations of previous seasons. Our Commissioner, representing the Turkish Government, was Halil Alyanak, formerly Director of the Museum at Adana. Mr. Lands, our Architect, drew innumerable measured plans and sections in all areas investigated. The many tasks and labors in addition to the supervision of actual excavation were distributed among the members of the staff exactly as in previous years, save that Mr. Boulter took over the inventorying of the sculpture. We thus have the benefit of continuity in the keeping of our records as well as in the direction of digging in the various areas of work. Professor Karo rendered a signal service by drawing up a descriptive catalogue of the numerous figurines and other objects of terracotta of Hellenistic and Roman date, as well as a detailed inventory of the many Mycenaean potsherds found in 1934 in the cemetery of Troy VI and in 1936 in the "earthquake layer" between House VI E and the Sixth City fortification wall. Emin Khni of Erenk6y was our foreman during the season and much is owed to the capable, efficient manner in which he carried out his duties. The number of workmen employed reached a maximum of 103, the great majority being experienced diggers who had served us in many previous campaigns. 2 A.J.A. xxxvi, 1939, pp. 431 ff.; xxxviii, 1934, pp. 2LQ3 ff.; xxxix, 1935, pp. 6 ff.; 550 ff.; xli, 1937, pp. 17 ff. 553</page><page sequence="2">554 CARL W. BLEGEN give some idea of the complexity and the magnitude of the labor accomplished by the members of the staff of the expedition. In this preliminary report many of the minor activities will be passed over, and in summarizing the chief results of our ex- cavations we may deal with our operations in topographical order in eight principal areas. Mr. Sperling again had charge of our researches along the northern edge of the hill, and under his supervision explorations were carried out in some nine different sectors. In this brief summary it may suffice merely to mention a supplementary cutting in square C 3 (Plate XIX), 1 which permitted some further observations with regard to the western end of the great megaron-like house of Troy I, uncovered in previous campaigns; two small probings in J 3 and K 3, where some structures of Troy VI and later were brought to view; and the removal in H 2-3 of an immense mass of loose earth from Schliemann's excavations, a large task that ultimately exposed a broad area of undisturbed deposit of different periods, which we have not yet examined in detail. With the object of ascertaining the relation between Troy I and II Mr. Sperling made a careful investigation in the southwestern quarter of square E 3, where he found it possible to recognize a direct stratigraphic connection with the deeper layers of Troy I, which he had been able to differentiate in 1936 in the adjoining square D 3, and to trace in their continuity the succeeding strata. A layer with con- spicuous signs of burning, that seems to belong approximately to the end of I, is followed by two others, a very thick one and a thinner one, both of which Mr. Sper- ling calls "transitional, " since it is not yet clear whether they are to be assigned to I or II. Wheel-made pottery begins soon above them. Between this "transitional" deposit and some walls attributed by Professor Dirpfeld to period IIa there appears to be an intermediate layer, which should probably be ascribed to II. If this is cor- rect, the so-called "IIa" walls cannot have been built in the initial phase of II. Relatively little pottery was obtained, and the ceramic sequence of these layers is not yet adequately represented. A much more extensive excavation was undertaken somewhat farther eastward in F 3. Here our main purpose was to make a fresh test of the early strata of Troy I and to collect as much material and evidence as possible that might help to clarify the history of the site from the later phases of the First Settlement to the middle stages of the Second. Here, too, it was first necessary to remove a vast dump of earth heaped up by Schliemann. Much of the area was occupied by the surviving portion of a large building called II R on Ddrpfeld's plan and indicated as belonging to period IIa. In three places (in the southeastern part of the large room of the house; in an adjoining room on the southeast, beyond a cross-wall; and outside the northeastern wall of the building, beginning at a depth of ca. 6.50 m. below our datum), where undisturbed contem- porary deposit was found, the pottery recovered included small quantities of wheel- made ware, and fragments of the same kind occurred also in a thin underlying layer. 1 This and the following references are to the squares as numbered on Professor Dirpfeld's plan of Troy: Troja und Ilion, II, P1. III (reprinted at end of book in Leaf, Troy, A Study in Homeric Geography), which has been simplified in our plan, drawn by Mr. Lands, reproduced in Plate XIX.</page><page sequence="3">EXCAVATIONS AT TROY, 1937 555 Since evidence from other areas has shown that wheel-made pottery was apparently still unknown at the beginning of Troy II, Mr. Sperling concludes that we must re- vise the dating of House II R and refer it to phase b or c of the Second Settlement, making a corresponding readjustment in the dating of some other walls in the immediate vicinity. Below these levels lay a deposit, ca. 2 m. deep, composed mainly of clay, the disin- tegrated material fallen from heavy walls of crude brick. Mr. Sperling uncovered portions of several long rectangular rooms, lying side by side, with massive brick walls ca. 1.65 m. thick and still standing in some places to a height of 2 m. One room had a width of ca. 3.60 m., and it exceeded 7 m. in length, extending beyond the limit of our digging. In the clay walls arranged in two horizontal sets were many fairly large holes, filled with soft earth and remains of carbonized wood (Fig. 1), and similar vestiges of wood appeared here and there about the room. Mr. Sperling infers that the holes were made for the insertion of heavy, transverse beams to support a wooden floor, perhaps with a hollow space underneath for ventilation. A stone pave- ment came to light some 0.60 m. deeper, but its lack of habitation-debris implied that it was not long, if at all, used as a floor. Beneath the structure with its thick walls of crude brick were uncovered broad stone foundations of an earlier building of similar dimensions and plan. Like its suc- cessor it seems far too huge and massive to have been a private dwelling-house, and FIG. 1. - RooM WITH WALLS OF BRICK AND STONE PAVEMENT, TRANSITIONAL PHASE, TROY I-II it is more likely that both complexes, which Mr. Sperling assigns on ceramic evidence to two phases of the transitional age between Troy I and II, were connected with the fortification wall of the citadel, perhaps constituting a series of magazines for the storage of provisions. A late stage of Troy I was represented by some rooms of a building constructed with relatively thin stone walls, which came to light below the "magazines." It had been destroyed by a great conflagration and many remnants of charred wood, to- gether with hard-baked, reddened chunks of clay and other burnt debris were found lying on the rough cobblestone pavement of two rooms. Along the walls and covered by rubbish that fell during the fire, lay a heap of carbonized wheat, separated from the wall and from the floor by charred wood, possibly the remains of bins in which the grain had been stored. We have ventured to call the building a granary. Under the "granary" and to the south of it a pit, dug to native rock at 13.80 m. below our datum, yielded a series of potsherds for the many earlier layers of Troy I, very valuable for comparison with the material from other areas. Mr. Sperling's work in F 3 has revealed abundant fresh evidence for the essential</page><page sequence="4">556 CARL W. BLEGEN continuity between Troy I and II, marked by an unbroken ceramic tradition. The common types of pottery of late I are very difficult, and often impossible, to distin- guish from those of early II. Sometimes the layers can be differentiated only by means of architectural evidence; but sometimes we are helped by the appearance of an uncommon, rare kind of pottery, very thin, with highly polished and beautiful lustrous red surface, which we have not yet found in late I, but only in the transi- tional layers and in early II. In the northeast quarter of F 3 short sections of two fortification walls were dis- closed. Both must be attributed to early phases of Troy II, but their relation to other walls of that period cannot yet be determined. FIG. a. - FOUNDATIONS OF WALL OF TROY VI At the northern edge of the hill, mainly in squares G 2-3, and rising some 6 to 7 m. above the level of the Second Settlement just to the south of it, stands a small "island " of undisturbed deposit, which was left untouched by earlier excavators. After clearing the eastern scarp of the "island," against which Schliemann had dumped a great mass of earth from his excavations, Mr. Sperling was able to examine the stratified accumulation covering the northern slope of the hill. High up near the southeast corner of the area the remains of a much damaged, but massive wall were revealed and followed some distance westward across the "island." Built for the most part of irregular, unworked stones, it seems to have been a retaining wall in one of the older phases of the Sixth Settlement, for the deposit accumulated against its north face contained numerous potsherds of types we know to be characteristic of early VI. At the top of the "island" two later walls were discovered to overlie the more an- cient foundation. One is the wall of the great Roman edifice called by Diirpfeld IX W, the builders of which made free use of earlier material, which they must have</page><page sequence="5">EXCAVATIONS AT TROY, 1937 557 found close at hand. The other we think we may safely identify as a fragment of the substructure that supported the fortification wall belonging to the later stages of the Sixth Settlement. It is made of large, roughly squared blocks of hard limestone, simi- lar, though they are not quite so huge in size, to those which may still be seen in place in A 4-5 and along the south side of the citadel. The new section of the wall (Fig. 2), here laid directly upon the older retaining wall, which was itself bedded in a hard layer of Troy V, could be assigned to late VI from the character of the deposit still preserved in a few places along its south face. Although its identity was not recog- nized, a considerable piece of the wall was actually uncovered long ago and it is clearly shown on Dirpfeld's plan, marked by the elevation point 36.10. Whatever FIG. 3.- STRATIFIED LAYERS COVERING NORTH SLOPE OF CITADEL was left of it after Roman times eastward and westward of the "island" must have been demolished by Schliemann. The long-lacking evidence now recovered by Mr. Sperling, supplemented by that revealed through our explorations in A 3-4 (cf. p. 593), should thus settle once and for all a much disputed question, convincingly verifying Professor Dtirpfeld's logical and sound deduction that the fortification wall of Troy VI continued all the way around the north side of the acropolis. The successive layers making up the deposit on the north slope were clearly visible (Fig. 3) in the east scarp of the "island." Over a fairly large areamarkedoff tobetested the strata were carefully removed, one by one, the total thickness of the accumula- tion from early VI to Roman times being ca. 5.65 m. According to Mr. Sperling's analysis the superficial layer, 0.40 m. deep, contained numerous marble chips, prob- ably representing the debris from the construction of the Roman building IX W. Next followed a layer from 0.40 to 0.80 m. yielding Hellenistic potsherds. The ensu- ing deposit, from 0.80 to 1.55 m., was composed of three strata: the uppermost,</page><page sequence="6">558 CARL W. BLEGEN which yielded a bronze coin of Alexandria Troas, dating from the beginning of the 3rd century B.C., was full of marble chips; the lowest contained similar chips and fragments of limestone, together with early Hellenistic potsherds and many other fragments representing all periods from Troy II to VIII, while the thin intermediate stratum produced only Hellenistic potsherds. This threefold division gives ground for the suggestion that there may have been a slight interval between the laying of the limestone foundations in their deeply excavated sand-bedded trenches and the erection of the marble superstructure of the Hellenistic Temple of Athena. The next layer, from 1.55 m. to 1.85 m., produced a good many sherds of the fourth century B.C., a coin of Sigeion of the same period, and a bronze coin issued by Alexander; and some classical and archaic fragments also made their appearance. A thick layer of Troy VIII, rich in pottery, extended from 1.85 m. to 3.25 m. The un- derlying strata are listed by Mr. Sperling as follows: 3.25-4.00 m. = Troy VII and late VI 4.00-4.60 m. = Troy VI 4.60-5.10 m. = Early VI 5.10-5.65 m. = Transitional V-VI. In the deposit below 5.65 m. the layers no longer have a uniform slope, but seem to have been broken off and damaged by erosion. Along the dividing line between G and H in squares 3 and 4 the lower courses of the great fortification wall, partially exposed by Schliemann, were cleared. The un- disturbed deposit here, covering the outer face of the wall, contained numerous potsherds, but not a single fragment of wheel-made ware. This part of the wall thus appears to have been built in one of the earliest phases of the Second Settlement. At the conclusion of the campaign of 1936 the "island" in square E 6, in the cen- tral part of the acropolis, had been completely excavated: the top of the underlying fortification wall of IIa had been exposed and alongside it, toward the north, border- ing the court of the great Megaron, several successive layers belonging to late II had been examined, beneath which deeper soundings had revealed a stone ramp and two substantial walls in association with a deposit apparently dating from the time of Troy I. No proper habitation layers contemporary with the fortification walls of periods IIb and IIa had been recognized, however, and no undisturbed accumulation had yet been found to illustrate in stratified sequence the stages of development by which Troy I passed into Troy II. It was consequently with the hope of being able to fill this gap in our knowledge of the stratification of the site that Miss Marion Raw- son in the season of 1937 resumed her work in this central region, which speedily became the scene of widespread activity. For her search, beginning in the immediate neighborhood of E 6, in squares F 4-5 and F 6, soon led to unexpected discoveries that obliged her to extend her operations far to the northeast and the west; and by the end of the campaign she had conducted excavations and soundings in 14 places in a zone stretching from square C 4-5 on the southwest to square G 4 on the north- east, a distance of more than 100 m. In the course of these explorations she was not only able to investigate and study the early strata of Troy II in four different areas, but made a fresh test of the whole stratification in the middle of the site through</page><page sequence="7">EXCAVATIONS AT TROY, 1937 559 periods V, IV, III, II and I, and discovered and traced through almost one-half of its circuit a hitherto unknown imposing fortification wall of Troy I, with a gateway flanked by two massive towers. The following account of the results is abridged from Miss Rawson's comprehensive report. Within the citadel of Troy II, apart from three small "islands," which were pre- sumably left standing to show the layers of stratification marking his successive "cities," Schliemann had almost everywhere removed the superincumbent deposit and dug into or through the strata of the Second Settlement itself. Miss Rawson succeeded, however, in discovering one small place, where by some good fortune the whole surviving accumulation of Troy II was still preserved untouched, so that its component layers could be carefully examined. This area lay to the eastward of the small Propylaea called II C on Dirpfeld's plan, in squares F 5-6, where a low hum- mock of earth and stones, some 5 m. long by 3.50 m. broad, still supported the scanty remains of a wall, which, to judge from its level (5.61 m. below the datum we used in E 6), seemed to be a construction of Troy III. Digging below this mass of stones Miss Rawson found parts of two walls of an earlier building with a pivot stone at - 6.26 m., marking a door and a floor on which lay many fragments of pottery. A jar with an incised fern pattern and a small jug were recognized, and among other objects recovered may be mentioned a tiny fragment of gold leaf and a plain whorl of terracotta. Alongside the building ran a street in a northeasterly direction, possibly a continuation of the narrow street found in 1935 in square E 6; the d6bris filling it contained vast quantities of sherds and bones, coated with the greenish accretion, characteristic of street deposits. This layer at - 6.26 m. is evidently to be assigned to the final stage of Troy II. An antecedent phase was clearly represented in a deeper floor deposit, ranging from 7 or 7.10 m. to 7.20 m. below our datum, with which was also associated a short section of stone wall. The layer contained scattered fragments of slate, like those noted in E 6 in a period later than IIc, and on the floor, under burned earth, lay two large jugs or jars, a flaring bowl, one plain and two incised whorls, a bone idol, two bronze darts or javelin points, a flint knife, and a flake of obsidian. Underneath the layer characterized by fragments of slate was a thin and almost sterile stratum of earth showing some traces of burning and containing chunks of fallen clay brick and roofing, which rested on a pavement of small pebbles at 7.33 m. below our datum. This pavement was laid up to the walls of the Propylaea and the building north of it and was undoubtedly the floor belonging to these structures; it corresponds to the similar pavement noted by Ddirpfeld in the court before the Megaron, some remains of which were likewise found in our excavations in square E 6; and this is clearly the ground level of Dirpfeld's period IIc. Unfortunately the small area uncovered in F 5-6 yielded only a few small indeterminate potsherds, to- gether with a heavy bronze implement, perhaps a chisel. Beneath the pebble pavement an almost equally sterile stratum of decomposed bricks was encountered, resting on a thin layer of sand at ca.- 7.48 m. The latter was perhaps not a real floor, but the deposit seems to antedate the buildings of IIe and can no doubt safely be assigned to IIb. The yield of pottery was too scanty to throw much light on the ceramic history of the period.</page><page sequence="8">560 CARL W. BLEGEN Continuing on down through the sand, Miss Rawson next found a layer of sterile brown earth covering a massive cobblestone pavement, which apparently extended eastward and southward up to the IIa fortification wall, sloping downward from ca. 7.50 to 8.12 m. below our datum. Most of the pavement (Fig. 4) consisted of a course of stones laid on a soft filling of earth, but part of it, just to the east of the later Propylaea, proved to be the top of a monumental tower, solidly built in stone con- struction, flanking a gateway in a great fortification wall, clearly dating from some phase of Troy I. Between the period of use of the wall and the time of construction of the pavement, which may certainly be attributed to IIa, the ground toward the east had risen considerably, perhaps by gradual accumulation; and when the citadel was enlarged and refortified in IIa the top of the earlier tower coincided so nearly with the new ground-level that it could be conveniently utilized as part of the stone pavement. This pavement obviously marks the earliest level of Troy II, since the fill immediately beneath it had the unmistakable character of unmixed de- bris of the First Settlement. Unfortu- nately the IIa layer yielded virtually no remains of pottery or other objects; and thus, although the actual strata could be differentiated, as we have seen, our excavation in F 6 did not ade- quately fill the gap in our ceramic series for the early phases of Troy II. Before turning to the new fortification wall of Troy I we must refer briefly to the at- tempts made in three other areas to find these "missing links." FIG. 4--COBBLESTONE PAVEMENT OF TROY IhA IN SQUARE F 5-6 Within the forehall of the great megaron in square E 5 two trenches were dug in order to examine the stratification. Portions of the walls of a smaller megaron, as- signed by Ddrpfeld to period IIb, were exposed just beneath the IIc level, and to- ward the south was disclosed a piece of a slightly deeper wall, identified by Dtirpfeld as belonging to period IIa; but, though a mass of stones in loose earth might be inter- preted as a remnant of a pavement of IIa, proper floor deposits of these two phases were nowhere preserved and our series of pottery of early II could not be completed here. Immediately beneath the mass of stones, and partly interrupted by it, was a layer of light clayey earth containing sherds of fairly early I. The underlying deposit, which continued some 4 m. to bedrock at 12.17 m. below our datum (or 25.88 m. above sea level), showed at least three successive habitation-layers, rich in pottery, bones, and shells, and each with accompanying stone walls. From one trench alone 14 awls, 2 implements, and a pin of bone; the lower part of an idol, two whorls and many fragments of terracotta; one idol and an amulet of marble; five polishing stones and a flint knife; and two bronze or copper pins and a javelin point of the same metal were recovered. The fragments of pottery have not yet been fully studied,</page><page sequence="9">EXCAVATIONS AT TROY, 1937 561 but they appear to belong to early phases of I. It is thus clear that there was much "telescoping" in this central part of the citadel; in late I the deposit of middle I must have been removed; the d6bris of late I in turn was cleared away to make room for constructions of IIa; the layer of IIa was, for the most part, displaced by that of IIb; and the latter was badly disturbed when the great buildings of IIce were built. In the west central region of the acropolis, in squares C 4-5, Miss Rawson carried out another careful test of the stratification. In this area many walls had been ex- posed by Schliemann, among which Dierpfeld recognized the elements of a large building, which he assigned to his period IIb, since the eastern end of it, at least, had certainly been demolished when the great gateway F M of period IIc was erected. Built over the southwestern part of this building was a complex of walls (shown on Dirpfeld's plan as II C) which could also be attributed to a structure of IIc, and over this in turn was superposed the house called by Schliemann "the House of the City King," in which ten of the famous treasures were found. Schliemann originally ascribed this house to the "Third or Burnt City," but it was subsequently re-as- signed to the preceding period; and it is now clear from its similarity to the struc- tures of our final phase of II that it should be dated to the very end of the Second Settlement. A small space between the northeast corner of the IIb building and the northwest corner of the IIc building had not been disturbed below the IIb floor in previous excavations; our hopes of finding valuable ceramic material here were, however, disappointed, for, as elsewhere, the early layers of Troy II yielded only the scantiest remains. Beneath Dirpfeld's house of IIb, Miss Rawson found two earlier wall com- plexes. One consisted of a broad wall running from northwest to southeast, together with a piece of a cross wall, both built with large facing stones on each side and smaller stones in the middle. Only a single course was preserved, and it was not possible to recognize an associated floor deposit or even layer. Barely a few centi- metres deeper, running from north to south diagonally under the other, another broad wall came to light, with its top at ca. 8 m. below our datum. Consisting of one or two courses, it was built of large stones with a filling of smaller material and the flat top may have been intended to support a superstructure of crude brick. Associ- ated with the wall was a pavement made of small stones, pithos-fragments and potsherds; but the earth covering the pavement was almost sterile. These two wall complexes were clearly successive, not contemporary, and both certainly antedate Dierpfeld's building of period IIb. Since it seemed equally sure that the earlier of the two must be reckoned as belonging to Troy II, it follows that period IIa must have at least two chronological phases in this area. Directly beneath the earliest Second City wall was a fill of decomposed brick, rest- ing on a layer of curiously variegated earth of a kind characteristic in deposits of Troy I. Continuing still deeper Miss Rawson found ca. 3 m. of successive habitation layers consisting of black ashy earth, containing quantities of potsherds, shells, animal bones and carbonized matter, until at 11.29 m. below our datum further digging was blocked by masses of stones. Many objects of stone, bone, terracotta, bronze or copper, and several complete vases were recovered from these layers, and the numer- ous potsherds give a useful series for the study of the pottery of Troy I.</page><page sequence="10">562 CARL W. BLEGEN As a check on our whole study of the stratification of the central part of the acro- polis as represented in E 6, and at the same time with the hope of finding undisturbed deposits of the early phases of Troy II, Miss Rawson undertook this year a careful examination of the "island" left standing by Schliemann in squares F 4-5. It was much smaller than the "island" we have excavated in E 6, and the summit, at 1.53 m. below our E 6 datum, was barely large enough to afford standing room for one man; but since the sloping sides spread out considerably as they descended, the area increased rapidly as we progressed toward the bottom. Only the northerly half of the "island" was excavated, the southern part being allowed to remain as a FIG. 5. - STRATIFICAT1ON EXPOSED IN SCARP OF "ISLAND" IN F 4-5 permanent exhibit of the stratification (Fig. 5). The successive lay- ers of deposit were found to agree very closely with those ob- served and recorded by Miss Rawson in the adjacent area of E 6. The first metre of ac- cumulation, down to ca. 2.50 m. below our E 6 datum, comprised habitation-debris of Troy V, containing characteristic pottery, a millstone, a grinder and remains of a house wall. Below this level the earth changed, becom- ing very hard, with debris of fallen brick, which seemed to mark the end of Troy IV. The remains of the Fourth Settle- ment extended from ca. 2.50 m. to 4.35 m. below our datum, and two successive building-periods, or phases, could be distinguished. The later of the two was repre- sented by most of one room still enclosed by three stone walls, and small parts of two other rooms, with floors and floor deposits ranging from 3.25 to 3.55 m. below our datum. Considerable remains of burning indicated that this house had been de- stroyed by fire. Several pots were recovered, more or less nearly complete, together with whorls of terracotta, implements of bone and stone and a millstone. To the earlier phase of the period belonged a narrow street running from east to west and portions of two rooms of different houses, with their floor deposits at ca. 4.15 to 4.30 m. below our datum. The wall on the north side of the street had an interesting archi- tectural feature, its lowest course consisting of a row of orthostates. This layer</page><page sequence="11">EXCAVATIONS AT TROY, 1937 563 yielded a great quantity of pottery, which has not yet been thoroughly studied, four whorls of terracotta, four awls and a pin of bone, a flint knife and a celt. Troy III was represented by an accumulation ca. 1.85 m. deep, continuing from approximately 4.35 to 6.20 m. below our datum. The architectural remains included a house complex, in which the greater part of one room and corners of three others were preserved, and it was possible to distinguish three successive periods of occupa- tion. With the latest, which had its floor at ca. - 4.80 m. to - 5.20 m. and was marked by a thin burned layer, was associated an oven in a corner of two walls. A small coarse dish, a bone idol, and some other small objects were found at this level, to- gether with many sherds, bones and shells. The floor of the middle period, which lay at ca. -5.75 to -5.90 m., under a deposit of very hard earth, consisted of ashy earth with carbonized matter, some shells and many groups of sherds, some of which can perhaps be put together to form pots. Vases more or less nearly complete include a small jug, a red-washed bowl, a three-legged jar with incised decoration, a large "depas" and a small red-washed tankard; and there were furthermore three plain whorls, a bone awl, and a bronze or copper pin, the head of which is made of loops of fine wire. The earliest use of the house -presumably at the beginning of Troy III - was marked by a floor deposit at ca. - 5.90 to- 6.20 m. It yielded many sherds, but no whole pots, one incised and 6 plain whorls, and 3 bone implements. Directly below this house of the Third Settlement a new complex of walls came to light, comprising parts of four rooms apparently belonging to two houses, separated by a narrow street that ran from west to east for a distance of 3.50 m. and then turned sharply toward the south. The rooms were filled with burned debris and pieces of charred wood, the street with fallen stones, gray earth and carbonized matter; and it was clear that we had reached the level of the final phase of Troy II. The floor deposit was fairly thick, reaching a depth of 6.60 to 6.65 m. below our datum. A considerable number of pots, more or less nearly complete, vast quantities of potsherds, and many objects of bone, stone and terracotta were found in the street and in these rooms; and under a stone against the bottom of the east wall of Room 202 Miss Rawson discovered a small hoard of gold beads and pins (Fig. 6). One beautifully worked pin has a plain shaft surmounted by a disc, then a coil of wire above a hexagonal bead; on either side of the bead is a spiral supported on a flat piece which rests on the shaft.' With this were found the shaft of another pin, two pieces of thin gold wire perhaps from the head of a pin, and a curved bit of wire. There were also 252 flat beads of varying sizes, made of two thicknesses of gold leaf pressed together, with a tubular hole for the string,2 and 1029 tiny annular beads, formed likewise of two thicknesses or rings pressed together.I Along with the gold was found also a piece of lead, perhaps the head of a small figurine. It cannot be without significance that wherever we have examined a real deposit belonging to the final phase of Troy II, gold objects have come to light. From Schliemann's account of the finding of his "treasures" and from the fact that our beads and pin are duplicates of examples in his hoards, it seems fairly certain that most of his gold objects, too, can be dated to the last stage of the Second Settlement. But why so much gold should have been abandoned in the houses of this one period 1 See Schliemann, Ilios.

Perhaps the destruction of the settlement in the great conflagration, which has left such manifest traces, was brought about sud- denly and with violence, so that many of the inhabitants perished and could not return to recover their hoarded treasures. In F 4-5, as elsewhere, the earlier layers of the Second City proved very elusive, difficult to identify when found, and disappointingly bare of characteristic pottery and other objects. By patient study Miss Rawson was, however, able to differentiate a good many successive levels, although some lacked architectural elements, and where the latter were still present in others, associated floor-deposits could not be recognized. A change of earth at 7.00 m. below our datum, apparently marked a floor that -i :ll :-:-: .....--I ::::-:: ..--:_I:I: iii''iiiiaiiaiiii-iiij i--:::lZ a'!ik'; kiii-i_ :'-i-i:--- _::::i i :i:- -ii-ii-ai(;?!-!-isiiil - iiiii:iiiiiiiiiiiiii :-::------" :: : : :: i~ii iiii~iiiii~~i i ii~-iii-iiii ii~i:::. ::: , iiiiii~~~iiii~: :_i_:i-:lliii i-iiii ii::-ii:--: : :. - _ I i~::ici::: iiiiii iiiiiiiiii ii--: iiiii iiii iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii ii irii'~ii-ii'iioiii iii,:iiiiiii-~ ~i~~ii~~:-i:::iiliSiii-i'ii':_ ;i~iei~i--i-ii~iii-iii;iii---ii: :- FIG. 6.- GOLD OBJECTS RECOVERED IN LATEST LAYER OF TROY 11, IN F 4-5 can be referred to the penultimate stage of the Second Settlement. In this layer, underneath a wall of the subsequent phase, was found the skeleton of a child, some ten years of age, or younger, with very thin and fragile bones and a badly crushed skull. The child had been buried on its right side in a contracted position and there were no accompanying objects. The next layer, the third from the end of II in Area F 4-5, belongs to what may be called the "pit-period," for in this small area were revealed no fewer than four "bothroi," similar to those found in E 6 and elsewhere. The pits were irregular in shape and of various sizes, but each contained a filling of soft ashy earth, with great quantities of potsherds. The floor with which these holes seemed to be associated sloped downward to the north to ca. 7.e0 m. below our datum at the edge of the hill and was covered with a deposit of the same kind as that filling the pits. Only a single fragment of a wall had survived from this period. Pit 1 yielded a coarse basin, a flaring bowl, two bronze or copper pins, and a bone idol; Pit 2 a one-handled bowl and a bone idol; Pit 3 two flaring bowls; and Pit 4 five flaring bowls, a lid with high</page><page sequence="13">EXCAVATIONS AT TROY, 1937 565 handle, a face-pot lid (the only one we have yet found in a Second City layer), one incised and two plain whorls, a bone pin and a polishing stone. The sherds from the pits, which have not yet been worked over, may allow further pots to be put to- gether. Another change of earth at 7.45 m. below our datum presumably indicated the next floor-level. It seemed to be related to a broad, well-built wall, which ran parallel to, and was no doubt contemporary with, a similar wall uncovered by Schliemann somewhat farther westward, which Ddrpfeld has assigned to period IIc. Unfor- tunately there was no real floor-deposit. Running under these walls of IIc in a direction from northeast to southwest was a wall of period IIb, likewise shown on Ddrpfeld's plan, just north of our "island." The top of this wall is at 7.26 m. and the bottom at 7.91 m. below our datum; but the floor once associated with the structure has disappeared, perhaps having been destroyed by the builders of the IIc walls. On Dirpfeld's plan two walls of period IIa are projected so as to meet and form the corner of a building under our "island." We uncovered the actual corner and cleared the walls for some distance. They are solidly built and were coated with plaster, and one of them has its two lower courses projecting so as to form a bench or a shelf along the base of the wall. The well-marked floor of the building varies from 7.87 m. to ca. 8.20 m. below our datum; part of it still has a coating of plaster which is discolored, showing the marks of burning beams. Thin broad strips of charred wood lay on the floor, and above was a loose fill of burned earth, chunks of clay and charcoal, constituting clear evidence that the building was destroyed by fire. Al- though we excavated a fairly large area, the floor deposit produced only a few small indeterminate sherds and gave little information about the pottery of the period. The most remarkable feature of the building was a peculiar hole in the floor, fairly regular in shape and neatly cut. It had a diameter of 0.50 m. and a depth of 2.81 m. The hole was filled with the same loose deposit of burned earth, brick and charred matter, that lay on the floor, and near the bottom were great chunks of carbonized wood, some thick and heavy, like pieces of tree trunk, some thin and flat like fragments of board, while many unburned pieces of reddish bark were pressed against the side of the shaft. Throughout the entire depth of the hole the earthen sides were unmistakably burned and the effect of the fire had penetrated to a con- siderable depth. At the bottom of the pit, 11 m. below our datum, were large flat stones. The purpose of this shaft has not yet been ascertained, nor can we under- stand how in a hole so narrow and deep fire could be induced to burn sufficiently to bake the walls so thoroughly. One thing, at any rate, is clear, namely that the pit was used during the occupation of the building in period IIa. A trench was dug through the IIa floor, and the underlying deposit, as might be expected, proved to belong to Troy I. Various walls soon appeared, seriously restrict- ing our excavations, but in a small space, less than 9 m. square, we were able to reach a depth of 11 m. below our datum, where we were obviously already in an early layer of the First Settlement. The potsherds from this deposit are still awaiting study. In all four of our major areas of investigation in the central region of the citadel,</page><page sequence="14">566 CARL W. BLEGEN where we sought evidence to fill the gap in our knowledge of the stratification, the latest layers of Troy I and the early strata of the Second Settlement thus showed themselves stubbornly reluctant to yield the desired information. Only the most meagre collections of potsherds were obtained from the decisive layers, and the pieces themselves are usually small and indeterminate. However, the material, such as it is, will be studied as carefully as possible, and perhaps some conclusions may present themselves. It is an agreeable contrast to turn now to the great fortification wall of Troy I, discovered by Miss Rawson, for here there is no lack of evidence and the material is abundant. Although its character was not understood, Schliemann's excavations of long ago had already revealed a short piece of the wall in square F 5, and it was here FIG. 7.-EAST TOWER, FLANKING GATEWAY IN FORTIFICATION WALL OF TROY I that Miss Rawson began her exploration. Only the top edge and the beginning of the sloping face were visible and there was nothing to indicate in advance the monumen- tal nature of the structure. A trench opened to expose the outer face soon showed that the wall, continuing down to a great depth, stretched on both to the northeast and to the southwest and was evidently connected with a massive tower-like pro- jection, which had begun to emerge under the east antae of the later Propylaea, IIc (Fig. 7). Thus, it speedily became apparent that we were dealing with an imposing fortification wall, which could be dated, on the evidence of the contiguous deposit, to the time of Troy I; and Miss Rawson at once recognized that a further section of the circuit was to be identified in a similarly constructed substantial wall which she had uncovered far to the west, at a corresponding level, in the western edge of the scarp below and to the north of our "island" in E 6. From this time on until the sus- pension of work at the end of July a sustained effort was made to discover and expose the line of this wall and by the end of the campaign its course had been traced through almost one-half of the entire enceinte.</page><page sequence="15">EXCAVATIONS AT TROY, 1937 567 It was not possible to uncover the wall in its whole extent by a continuous excava- tion, for much of the ground is occupied by later structures which could not be destroyed. Consequently it was necessary to limit our investigation to a series of trenches, pits and probings, wherever they could safely be made. In spite of this handicap, Miss Rawson was able to accomplish her task. Beginning in square C 5, at the extreme southwest, the wall was followed through D 5, E 5, E 6, F 6, F 5, and G 5 to a point in G 4, where it became merged in the highest preserved portion of the fortification wall of Troy II and could no longer be distinguished. The northern half of the circuit remains unknown and it is doubtful if its line can ever be exactly deter- mined; for much of it is buried beneath and incorporated in the mass of the Second City wall and much of it was presumably destroyed by the activity of later builders and perhaps by Schliemann's excavations. The early wall noted by Diirpfeld, and re- exposed by Mr. Sperling, in square C 3, however, is almost surely part of this early defensive system. The new wall, which Miss Rawson has designated as I W, varies considerably in the different places in which it has been uncovered, both as regards its state of preservation and the details and style of its construction, though it is uniformly built of unshaped stones, many of which, especially near the bottom, are of large size. A proper inner face of the wall has nowhere been found, probably because this part of the citadel has suffered so much disturbance from the repeated telescoping of layers; but the structure seems not to have been uniform in thickness; in some places it may have been merely a heavy stone facing, laid up against an embankment of earth or crude brick; elsewhere it is backed by a solid filling of stones, as in E 5, where the stone fill has the immense thickness of 11.40 m., with no definite line of division or end. The outer face of the wall, except near the bottom, generally has a strong batter, sometimes, as in the east tower of the gateway, with a pronounced bulge, perhaps due to faulty construction; but in some places the successive courses were laid almost vertically. Everywhere the interstices were filled with a light-col- ored clay which served as a useful kind of mortar. The bottom of the wall, which is bedded on earth, not on native rock, is generally found at a depth of 11.00 m. to 11.50 m. below our datum (though in D 5 it goes much deeper), and the top ap- pears between - 7.55 and - 7.75 m. in the better preserved portions, which thus have a height of slightly more than 3.50 m. From square C 5 the wall proceeds, first in a southeasterly direction, then veering more to the east, through D 5 and E 5, where it is interrupted by a great gateway protected by two flanking towers, that on the west in squares E 5-6, that on the east extending into F 6. The gateway lies almost directly below the sunken passage of Dirpfeld's gate F N of period IIa. The actual entrance in our gateway of Troy I is relatively narrow, having a width of only 2 m.; unfortunately it was not possible to clear this opening through to the interior of the citadel. The tower on the west, which we were able to measure by tunnelling along the face from both sides, pro- jects 5.45 m. from the wall and has a breadth of 7.20 m. across its front, while the eastern tower (Fig. 7) is 9.10 m. broad and juts out 4.70 m. from the wall. The southeastern corner of this tower, owing to the uneven batter, seems to form an angle of considerably less than 90 and has a peculiarly sharp appearance. From the</page><page sequence="16">568 CARL W. BLEGEN tower the wall continues in a northeasterly direction (Fig. 8), through square F 5, well preserved for some 10 m., then in a much damaged state for some 8 m. farther, where a projecting buttress (which we examined by tunnelling) suggests that an ancient repair was effected, certainly before the First Settlement had come to its end. Following the line of the wall into square G 5 we came to another projecting tower; a tunnel along its southern side reached a corner at 6.20 m., beyond which the FIG. 8--FORTIFICATION WALL OF TROY I FROM SOUTH eastern front was followed ca. 1.20 m. Yet another tunnel along the face of the wall behind the tower ultimately encountered a solid wall, presumably the north side of the tower. It seems likely that the tower flanks an east gate, but this conjecture could not be tested by digging, as the site of the possible gateway is covered by too many later remains. The next section of our wall to be uncovered lay much farther northeastward, in G 5 be- tween the walls of the large build- ing marked II N on Dirpfeld's plan, where the space available for digging was not quite sufficient to permit us to reach the bottom of the wall. It was cleared to a depth of 14 courses, however, and its di- rection was seen to be almost from south to north. Some remains of a superstructure of crude brick were also found in place. The northern- most piece of the wall to be identi- fied was exposed in a trench just behind the fortification wall of Troy II in square G 4. Here, too, 14 irregular and strongly battered courses were found, covered by a thick deposit of fallen brick. Some evidence sur- vives to show that another tower once stood here, but the building of the Second City wall over the remains has made it impossible to learn the details of the earlier structures. The debris outside the wall, raising the ground to the level of the Second Settle- ment, was not of absolutely uniform character in all our trenches and pits; but it usually contained abundant potsherds of Troy I, and it generally lay in several suc- cessive layers sloping down away from the wall, seeming thus to be the result of gradual accumulation rather than a deliberate fill. The deeper strata, continuing down to hardpan or rock, 1 m. or more below the bottom of the wall, almost every-</page><page sequence="17">EXCAVATIONS AT TROY, 1937 569 where revealed at least two rich habitation-layers clearly antedating the building of the wall. The latter must consequently be ascribed to a middle stage of Troy I. A massive wall uncovered by Schliemann in his great North-South Trench, in square E 5, suggests, however, that the settlement was already previously fortified, even in its initial phases. In the earlier deposit outside the wall, in square F 5, Miss Rawson found a grave containing the skeleton of a child under ten years of age. The body had been buried on its left side in a contracted position, with one large stone set on each side of the head to support a smaller covering stone. Apparently no objects had been deposited with the burial. In square F 5, to the east of the tower flanking the gateway and beneath an un- mixed accumulation of Troy I, some 3.50 m. deep, three large stone slabs were brought to light, laid on edge, end to end, in line with the face of the tower. They extended from the corner of the tower into the scarp of the unexcavated pinnacle, or "island," which still stands in this part of the citadel, supporting a giant oak tree. The slabs rested in a slanting position against a sloping layer of whitish earth and stone chips, which may have been deposited at the time the tower was erected, or may represent a somewhat later fill. The alignment of the stones in any case indi- cates that they were placed with reference to the tower, and they must belong to the same general period of Troy I. All three proved to be worked limestone slabs, of un- expected interest and significance. The one at the west, apparently broken on two sides, now measures 0.77 m. by 0.89 m., and is ca. 0.19 m. thick. Both faces are flat and smooth; one bears in symmetrical arrangement two large and two small, well- worked, shallow, saucer-like depressions or hollows. The eastern slab, roughly pointed at either end, is now 1.27 m. long, with a maximum width of 0.50 m. and a thickness of ca. 0.19 m. On one face, irregularly spaced, are eight small hollows of differing sizes and depths, five being grouped together roughly in the form of a semicircle near one edge of the stone, which seems to have been squared. The cen- tral slab, now 0.79 m. high, 0.62 m. wide across the top, and varying from 0.172 m. to 0.192 m. in thickness, has a soft flaky surface which has suffered no little damage. But it still preserves, sculptured in low relief, a heart-shaped human face, portrayed in frontal view (P1. XX). The face is cut with a raised rounded outline to indicate the chin and jaw and a wider roll above for the hair, which is represented by a series of small bored holes as falling in locks on either side of the head. This arrangement of the hair accentuates the heart-shaped form of the face. The nose, carved in the same plane as the hair and the outline of the lower face, is comparatively long, broadening out somewhat at the lower end. The left eye and the mouth are well rendered, though worn, while the right eye has been almost obliterated. To the left of the face and rising obliquely in broad rounded relief is what seems to be the shaft of a staff, or a sceptre, with a spherical head. Below the face to the right are traces of further carving, perhaps an arm or a hand, but the stone is too much damaged to allow more than a conjecture. These three slabs had obviously been re-used in the low wall or barrier in which they were found. They are, of course, stelae, and they must once have stood in up- right position; but where they were originally erected and why and when they were</page><page sequence="18">570 CARL W. BLEGEN pulled down to serve as building material we cannot say. The meaning of the curious hollows cut in two of the stelae is likewise still an unsolved puzzle; but the appear- ance of monumental stone sculpture in a context that can be attributed to the middle phase of the First Settlement is a startling phenomenon that calls for more than passing attention. This is apparently the earliest example of sculpture in stone yet known in Western Anatolia, or, for that matter, in the Aegean. Exhibiting little if any resemblance to early stone-carving in Mesopotamia and Egypt, it is a piece of strikingly individual character and may presumably be regarded as a work of native Trojan, or West Anatolian, art. It shows an unmistakable and definite feeling for style, which stamps it at once as the product of an age that has behind it a long line of experiment and tradition. It is consequently clear that culture in Troy I had al- ready reached a stage far more advanced than has hitherto been realized. The discovery of the great fortification wall of the First Settlement and of the contemporary sculptured stele may be regarded as one of the major achievements of our six years of work at Troy. It has added a new chapter to the history of the site. Schliemann's famed royal citadel of Troy II is now seen to be no new creation of its period, but the successor of a stronghold of the same type and character, evolved in a far more ancient age. The institution of kingship, of centralized royal power and of a court that fostered art in the northeastern Mediterranean, may thus be traced back to a much earlier period than was heretofore possible, and the origin of civilization itself is seen to recede still farther into the remote and inscrutable past. Before going on to another area in our survey, we must mention one further struc- ture discovered by Miss Rawson, namely a later fortification wall of Troy I, which she has called I Z. First observed in 1936 under the "island" in E 6, it was this season traced, by means of soundings, both eastward and westward to a total length of some 50 m. Apparently it was built in connection with an enlargement southward of the western part of the citadel, perhaps at a time when wall I W had been dam- aged. The later wall appears only on the western side of the gateway, continuing through E 6, D 5, and C 5 the line of the front of the flanking tower. It is peculiar in construction, consisting of a facing, one course thick, of fairly large stones laid against a sloping embankment of clay or brick. In some places the batter is so great that the structure looks more like a ramp than a wall; but perhaps there was once a vertical superstructure in crude brick. The wall dates from the later, but not the latest, phases of Troy I, and forms the third in the series of fortification walls of the First Settlement. Under the direction of Mr. Caskey excavations were continued on the south side of the acropolis in squares F 8 (Fig. 9) and F 9 and the area of operations was ex- tended westward to include a strip some 6 m. wide, extending from north to south through the adjoining squares E 8-9. In the following statement of the results, Mr. Caskey's report has been in part summarized, in part quoted verbatim. In F 8 the remains of a house uncovered in 1935 and then recognized as belonging to an early phase of the Fifth Settlement, were first removed, a task which yielded some useful fresh ceramic material and a little new information about the sequence of sub-periods in Troy V. Immediately beneath the house a layer of Troy IV appeared; it proved to be</page><page sequence="19">EXCAVATIONS AT TROY, 1937 571 thick and complex, containing many architectural remains, together with a wealth of pottery and miscellaneous objects. As in all subsequent settlements, the ground on this side of the hill in the time of Troy IV rose in step-like terraces toward the center of the citadel, and contemporary deposits accordingly descended more and more deeply as they extended southward, a circumstance necessitating attentive observation in following and identifying a given stratum. Digging slowly and care- fully Mr. Caskey was, however, able to distinguish five successive sub-periods, repre- sented by walls and floors. They are not all of equal importance and some may represent merely local rebuildings in this area rather than general changes through- out the site. Some portions of each level have been left in situ as a permanent exhibit. "Of period IVe, the latest, we found only a few walls, all in ruinous state. They FIG. 9.--EXCAVATIONS IN F 8, SEEN FROM THE NORTH lay just below the earliest layers of V, and there was no sign of any interruption in sequence between the two. At the northern edge of our area a deposit of burnt mat- ter seemed to indicate that some of the last buildings of the Fourth Settlement had ended in a conflagration. To the south we found few signs of burning. Five pots were recovered that can be definitely assigned to the last phase of Troy IV; ten oth- ers may belong to that or the next earlier period. "Two walls and part of the floor of a room of IVd lay within our area of excava- tion. The walls were roughly built and irregular, as seems to have been customary in Troy IV, but they contained large solid blocks in their foundations and had been pre- served to a height of four to five courses. Three fragmentary pots, four spindle whorls, and a small flint saw were found in the floor deposit, which lay at 5 m. to 5.20 m. below our datum. Just east of the room, at the same depth, we recovered two other vessels, of which one is a small jar with plastic representation of human features. "A retaining wall that ran east and west across our area, evidently constructed to</page><page sequence="20">572 CARL W. BLEGEN support a terrace, was at the same time made to serve as a house wall. It was built in the second sub-period, IVb, and was thickened and re-used in IVc. We were able to distinguish corresponding floor levels running south from this wall at 5.40 m. and 5.65 m. below datum, each of which yielded plentiful sherds. Six pots, probably to be assigned to IVc, were found in the northern and eastern parts of F 8, in strata that appeared to correspond with the floor at -5.40 m. From the lower level, IVb, we also recovered a one-handled bowl and a fine reddish-brown tankard. "The layer representing the first phase of Troy IV was marked by signs of a vio- lent conflagration. It was thus clearly differentiated from the others, which had borne evidence of normal and gradual decay and rebuilding. We were able to exca- vate parts of three adjoining rooms of IVa, and to examine in section two others, the walls and floors of which were visible in the bank. The room numbered 116 on our FIG. 10.--LID OF PYxis, TROY IV FIG. 11.- LARGE JAR, TROY IV plans was roughly rectangular and measured ca. 2.50 m. by 5.50 m. The stone foun- dations of its walls averaged 0.50 m. in diameter and stood two to six courses high. Their superstructure of crude brick had fallen and formed a layer of clay that cov- ered the burnt debris on the packed earth floor. Against the west wall of the room we found a millstone and the remains of a hearth or oven. The lower parts of two pithoi stood in place under the north wall, and twenty-one other crushed and shattered vessels, of various shapes and sizes, lay scattered about the room (Figs. 10, 11). From the floor deposit we also recovered two plain and five decorated spindle- whorls, five terracotta brush handles, a fiddle-shaped idol in marble, and a whet- stone. One of the large jars contained a quantity of carbonized grain. "South of Room 116, and communicating with it by a doorway, lay a similar room (numbered 218 on our plans). Only a corner of it fell within our area, but from the six square metres of floor that we cleared we recovered five pots (two closely related to Early Helladic ware), a bone awl, a fine bronze needle, a stone idol, and a chipped flint saw. Built into the corner of the room was a structure of brick and stone, covered with a white clay wash, much like the "corner seat" found in a house of the Fifth Settlement two years ago. "To the west of Room 218 there appeared to be a third room of IVa, also covered</page><page sequence="21">EXCAVATIONS AT TROY, 1937 573 with burnt debris. The floor level, however, was not well marked, and the area had become too limited to allow thorough investigation. "Excavation below the level of Troy IV was limited by both the space and time at our disposal, but we were able to do some digging along the north edge of the area, and in one place to sink a pit, about 2 m. square, to hardpan. Wherever we dug be- low IVa floors we immediately found a change in the character of the pottery, frag- ments of flaring bowls now appearing in profusion. The layer of Troy III was not deep, and only two walls, ruined and unrelated, came to light. At a depth of ca. 7 m. below our datum we came upon the tops of some very wide stone and brick walls, belonging to a large building recorded by Dirpfeld in Troja und Ilion.' It had been destroyed in a tremendous conflagration and was covered with fallen matter. Small bits of the floor of two rooms were found undisturbed at -7.80 m., but they con- tained very few sherds to date the building. A gold pin and bead lay among the debris. It seems probable that the walls belong to the last period of Troy II. "From -7.80 m. to - 10.65 m., where hardpan was reached, we encountered no walls, but were able to collect a series of sherds from nine distinct strata, all to be as- signed apparently to periods of Troy II. Wheel-made pottery was present in the earliest layer." The extension of our excavations into E 8-9 was undertaken primarily with the object of discovering and exposing the western end of the "Pillar House," in order to reveal the complete plan of this long, rectangular building of Troy VI, which we have uncovered running eastward through F 8-9 to a terrace beside the roadway that leads to the upper citadel from the South Gate. After a mass of debris from Schliemann's excavations had been removed, we came upon an undisturbed layer, about 0.40 m. deep, containing sherds of Roman date. With it were associated a foundation wall of soft limestone (A on our plans, partly uncovered in 1932), that probably belonged to Dirpfeld's building IX B, and a plat- form made of large limestone blocks, apparently the substructure of a monument of some kind which had stood some 4 m. to the south of the wall. "About 5 m. south of the platform we came upon a handsomely built well, 1.18 m. in diameter and 21.40 m. deep. From it we recovered numerous miscellaneous objects dating from the Roman Imperial period, and at the bottom were thousands of fragments of plain water-jars. When the well fell into disuse, it was evidently em- ployed as a refuse-pit, for it contained an extraordinary quantity of animal bones: toward the bottom chiefly leg-bones and skulls of horned cattle; above, bones of smaller animals and birds." Toward the southern end of our area we brought to light some portions of "The- ater C," traces of which had been identified and recorded on his plan by Ddrpfeld. It was possible to recognize five rows of seats, built of rough limestone, and two narrow aisles, dividing the cavea into three sections. In the center at about the fifth row a single block of a marble structure, perhaps some sort of proedria, was still preserved in situ. The upper part of the theater has completely vanished. Below the Roman stratum in the northern part of our area, a layer some 0.50 m. deep yielded many good sherds of Troy VIII, mainly of local manufacture, but in- I. pp. 99-100, Fig. QN, p. 73.</page><page sequence="22">574 CARL W. BLEGEN cluding, with some other imported pieces, fragments of a small Protocorinthian lekythos. "Perhaps the most interesting layer found in E 8-9 was that of period VIIb. It lay at 1.50 to 2.50 m. below our datum, throughout the northern part of our area, and was clearly contemporary with the similar deposit found in the adjoining area (F 8) in 1932. Two periods of habitation could be distinguished in the remains of walls and in the stratification of the earth, but both belonged to the same cultural phase. Architecturally the layer is marked by the widespread use of rough ortho- states in the walls, ceramically by the appearance of hand-made Buckelkeramik. "We came first upon fragmentary walls of a series of rooms that had been largely destroyed by later builders. The floor levels had been at 1.50 to 2 m. below our zero- point, sloping slightly downward toward the south. At this depth we recovered, more or less nearly complete, two small one-handled jugs, a two-handled cup, and FIG. 12. - CUP IN Buckellceramilk two bowls, all in Buckelkeramik; and a small one-handled cup in gray ware, wheel- made but imitating a common bucchero shape. "One entire room and parts of others, belonging to the earlier period of VIIb, fell within our area of excavation. The walls, averaging 0.60 to 0.70 m. in thickness, were built chiefly of irregular stones of moderate size and contained numerous flat orthostate blocks in the lower courses. A few well-cut, rectangular blocks of the kind found in Troy VI had also been employed. The room was nearly rectangular, measuring about 5.50 m. from north to south by 4 m. from east to west. It had evi- dently been in use throughout a fairly long period, since the walls showed numerous repairs. A well made doorway, 0.95 m. wide, opened through the south wall on a street. A pivot-stone for the post of the door, which swung inward, was found in place. The opening had been walled up at some period and a new door made in the north wall of the room. The earth floor, sloping irregularly from - 2.20 m. at the north to -2.50 m. at the south, was covered with fallen stones, probably from the final collapse of the house. No built hearth was discovered, but a mass of burnt matter against the east wall may indicate where the cooking was done. A moderate number of animal bones was found scattered throughout the room. "Fourteen whole pots were recovered from the floor deposit. These comprise eleven vessels in Buckelkeramik, four jugs and four cups (Fig. 12) of various sizes,</page><page sequence="23">EXCAVATIONS AT TROY, 1937 575 two large two-handled jars with high necks, and a two-handled bowl; and three pots in Trojan gray ware, namely two jugs and a wide-mouthed jar, the last an interesting variation of a shape common in VI and VIIa. Miscellaneous objects from the floor include: three bone pins or awls and a fragment of ivory, a blue glass bead, a rec- tangular bit of thin gold leaf, a soapstone mould for casting metal objects, a stone pestle and celt (the latter found inside one of the bucchero jugs), and thirteen terra- cotta spindle-whorls and buttons. "Below the floor of the room we found some traces of earlier layers of Troy VII, though there was little of the easily recognizable tan ware of VIIa. One barrel- shaped jar of coarse ware, with two handles and two plastic bands with thumb im- pressions, was recovered complete at -3 m., and at about the same depth a flat marble figurine with the well known owl-face, a type generally supposed to belong to a period much earlier than VII. "South of the VIIb house there was a street about 3 m. wide, which ran westward from the South Gate and was apparently in constant use throughout VIIa and VIIb. Between this street and the inner face of the Sixth City Wall we found a deep accumulation of deposit representing two distinct periods. To the earlier belonged a typical house of VIIa: it was built, like many others, against the face of the city wall; it had a pithos, with a flat stone lid, set into the floor, and the building had been destroyed in a violent conflagration. From the floor deposit we recovered four whole pots of VIIa fabric, including a long-necked jug of rare shape (Schmidt, Katalog, No. 3012). Above the burnt debris of this room lay nearly two metres of stratified deposit from which we were able to collect a large and interesting series of sherds. Time did not allow a complete study of the material, but it appears that most of the deposit belonged to a period, which, while certainly later than VIIa, was yet earlier than the introduction of Buckelkeramik and the orthostate walls of VIIb. The char- acteristic pottery is gray ware in the Trojan tradition, but with shapes previously not well represented in our collection. Painted sherds are rare, but we found almost inta.ct an alabastron with straight vertical sides, decorated in Late Mycenaean style. " When the material of the later periods had been recorded and removed, we were able to lay bare the western end of the "Pillar House" and to expose to view most of the ground-plan of this imposing Sixth City building (Fig. 13). It is nearly 27 m. long from east to west (the east wall is in such ruinous condition as to make exact over-all measurement impossible), and slightly over 13 m. wide, including the great- est thickness of the south wall. The inside measurements of the great hall are ap- proximately 23.70 m. by 9.50 m. The western end of the hall was divided into three recesses by two projecting walls, 3.Q5 m. in length. At least two of these recesses had been shut off, to form small rooms ca. 1.80 m. by a m., by another wall running north and south. The latter was built in Troy VI, for a stone-lined, trough-like structure, containing no later sherds, was found set against its face, but the wall is of a style different from that of the rest of the building, and may not have belonged to the original plan. The three recesses are paved with small stones; the southernmost, which could be best examined, showing a layer of brick below the stones, and under that an earlier pavement made of larger slabs. "We have discovered no doorway other than the one that must have existed in</page><page sequence="24">576 CARL W. BLEGEN the north wall, above the three stone steps mentioned in last year's report. This seems hardly consistent with the monumental character of the building itself, and may well have been a later addition. It is probable that the main entrance was at the east, near the gate of the citadel, where the wall is now ruined. "The south wall of the building was 2.80 to ?.90 m. in thickness, and served inci- dentally as a sort of terrace wall, for the floor was some two metres higher than the ground outside. Its foundations were still wider, showing set-backs, characteristic of Sixth City masonry, at five-metre intervals. Only two of these have been seen, since the eastern end of the south wall could not be excavated. "Just outside the southwest corner of the building we discovered a large oval stone, 1.25 m. high, 0.65 m. wide, and 0.40 m. thick. We suppose that it originally FIG. 13.- GENERAL VIEW ACROSS PILLAR HOUSE FROM NORTHWEST stood upright, though it was found lying almost horizontal. Near the middle of one face there is a bored hole, about 3 cm. in diameter and 20 cm. deep. The significance of the stone is by no means clear, though it seems certainly to be related to the building, and may well have had some religious purpose. It is perhaps analogous to the four "baetyls" that stand outside the tower by the South Gate. " To complete our investigations in this area we dug a trench 1.25 m. wide and 5.25 m. long, in F 9, extending from the south wall of the "Pillar House " to the inner face of the Sixth City Wall. The former proved to have foundations resting on a step- like base at 6.60 m. below datum. The wall of the citadel went down to hardpan, which we found at - 10.55 m. The foundations of the wall receded sharply towards the bottom, and the line of the Baugrube was visible all along its inner face, showing how the builders had cut a sloping scarp in the hillside and set their blocks against it. Some of the layers that had been cut through at that time could be traced up to the wall of the "Pillar House, " a fact which seems to prove that that building was</page><page sequence="25">EXCAVATIONS AT TROY, 1937 577 standing when the wall of the citadel was constructed. We found, furthermore, that fully three metres of deposit, as excavated in our trench, belonged to a period earlier than the "Pillar House, " though it could all be assigned to Troy VI. Only in the low- est layer was there any notable amount of red ware, and even here gray sherds of early VI made up 20% of the total. Thus we find further evidence of the long dura- tion of the cultural period Troy VI and the comparative lateness of its great monu- ments." The season of 1937 saw the resumption of activity in the region of the South Gate of the Sixth Settlement under the supervision of Mrs. Semple, who completed the excavation of the gateway itself, cleared a long extent of the roadway leading from it toward the center of the citadel, uncovered a smaller branch road running westward inside the fortification walls, examined a terrace outside the eastern end of the "Pillar House," and in an area just to the north of that structure laid bare the walls of a house of many rooms, dating from the period of transition between Troy V and VI. In addition to all this work, Mrs. Semple also found time to re-open two deep ancient wells, one of Hellenistic and one of Roman date. In order to expose the gateway properly, it was necessary to remove first an enormous cornice block which had fallen, probably from the corner of the Bouleu- terion, and lay, bottom up, over the Sixth City wall to the east of the gate; and next a short piece of the foundation of a structure connected with the Bouleuterion and dated by its mortar to Roman times. Beneath the cornice block and above the Sixth City wall, which had suffered considerable damage, were found the remains of a small vaulted kiln, constructed of brick and mortar. The stone pavement of the gateway and the associated well-built drain, which has been mentioned in previous reports, were definitely proved to belong to period VIIa, although the roadway of Troy VI at that point must have lain at a level very little deeper. A much higher cobblestone pavement, ca. 0.80 m. above that of VIIa, can now safely be attributed to period VIIb. The street ascending from the gate to the upper part of the acropolis and curving slightly westward was followed some 30 m., its full extent as now preserved, up to the edge of Schliemann's great Southeast Trench. Just inside the gate is a small plaza, some 5.30 m. wide; this and the roadway farther northward, ca. 3.30 m. wide and bordered by high stone walls on either side in the time of the Sixth Settlement, obviously had a long history, indicated by many successive changes of level; and two layers of debris, due to severe damage and demolition, could easily be distin- guished. The upper, which comprised masses of fallen stones, charred wood, car- bonized matter and abundant other traces of fire, was dated by its potsherds to period VIIa, and must certainly represent the violent destruction of the earlier phase of the Seventh Settlement. The deeper layer, containing quantities of pot- sherds of Troy VI, consisted likewise of a tremendous mass of stones (Fig. 14), ap- parently fallen from buidings on either side of the street, but not marked by signs of burning. In this stratum we must recognize the ruins caused by the earthquake which we believe to have brought an end to the settlement of Troy VI. Both these layers of debris have now been removed and the roadway has been cleared down to a hard-packed earth pavement of early VI (Fig. 15).</page><page sequence="26">578 CARL W.

It was a thoroughfare ca. 2.30 m. wide, used in two periods, namely VIIa and VIIb, for the upper accumulation of deposit produced numerous sherds of Buckelkeramik, while the lower lay under a heap of partially calcined stones and burned debris (Fig. 16), such as we regularly find recording the end of VIIa in a general conflagra- tion. Some remains were observed of a gateway or a doorway, leading up northward from the street to the terrace on which the "Pillar House" had stood in the time of Troy VI, and evidence was noted that the ground level of VIIa here almost coin- cided with that of VI. But the "Pillar House" must have been completely demol- ished at this time, for the street passed high over the foundations of the southern supporting wall of that building. To the east of the "Pillar House" lay a platform, ca. 3 m. wide, separated from the main roadway by a well-built wall of VIIa. This latter was constructed over an earlier wall of heavy Cyclopean masonry, which presumably supported a similar but wider terrace in the time of Troy VI, when the "Pillar House" was occupied. Later disturbance has, however, caused so much damage in this region that neither the arrangement of the original platform nor the position of the door in the east wall of the "Pillar House," if there was one, could be determined; and the use of the area in period VIIa is almost equally unknown, though the discovery of a huge pithos, set among loose stones, suggests that part of the space, at any rate, may have been in- cluded within a dwelling house. In the period of the Sixth Settlement the ground immediately to the north of the "Pillar House" rose in a fairly high, step-like terrace, as has been mentioned in earlier reports. Much of the accumulated debris of Troy VI on this side, however, was disturbed and removed in post-Roman, perhaps Byzantine, times, when a broad trench was dug across the area, roughly from east to west. The purpose of this relatively ancient excavation could not be certainly determined, but we found that the loose earth filling the cut contained a great many blocks and fragments of marble taken from Roman buildings, and the original bottom of the trench was strewn with thousands of marble chips and splinters. We conjectured, therefore, that the disturbance was due to the work of mediaeval marauders, who were collecting marble, to be burned into lime. Whatever their object, it is clear that the floor of their trench reached the bottom of the earliest habitation debris of Troy VI. In the eastern part of this area, just to the west of the main street coming up from the South Gate (but high above its level), Mrs. Semple, after clearing away the last traces of the mediaeval intrusion, dug into the undisturbed, underlying deposit. The potsherds, which immediately began to appear, soon made it plain that she had found a transitional layer that must be assigned to an intervening chronological phase between pure V and pure VI. Extending her excavation northward beyond the edge of the "Byzantine" cut, where a superposed wall definitely belonging to Troy VI had to be removed, Mrs. Semple eventually laid bare the substantial walls of a house, which proved to be almost complete in plan. Only its extreme north- western corner is lacking, having been destroyed to make way for a Roman founda-</page><page sequence="28">580 CARL W. BLEGEN tion. It is a long rectangular building, oriented from northwest to southeast, di- vided by plaster-coated partitions, some of stone, some of crude brick, into five or more relatively small rooms (Fig. 17, p. 578). The position of the main doorway has not been definitely determined, but it probably lay at the southern end of the east side, opening into a small vestibule, from which the other rooms are accessible. The ceramic remains on the floors, though not excessively rich in whole pots, comprised a great many sherds, which illustrate well the character of the pottery in this transitional period. Much of it, closely related to fabrics of Troy V, is a red-wash ware (Fig. 18) including examples of strongly profiled rims and of characteristic deep bowls; much of it is of an early type of gray Minyan ware, in which ringed stems of goblets are common. We have not yet had time to study this material ade- quately, but we may reasonably hope that it will shed new light on some of the prob- lems of ceramic development in the transition from the Early to the Middle Bronze Age at Troy. With reference to the two wells excavated by Mrs. Semple not much need be said FIG. 18.- CuP IN RED-WASH WARE, TROY V-VI here. The huge rectangular Hellenistic well, found in 19351 to the north of House 700 and which had been cut through the Sixth City roadway leading into the acropolis from the South Gate, was filled with masses of debris and stones, many of great size, which were laboriously removed. When rock was reached the handsomely built lining of square stones stopped and the size of the shaft was much reduced. The bottom was found at a depth of ca. 14.15 m. below the level of the Sixth City street. The well yielded quantities of Hellenistic pottery and many fragments of broken water-jars, but no objects of great value or importance. The Roman well was dis- covered just to the south of the Byzantine cut, alongside the north wall of the "Pillar House." It was roughly but strongly lined, with unworked stones down to hardpan, then hewn in the rock to a total depth of ca. 20 m. Many fragments of plain water-jars and of tiles and quantities of animal bones were recovered; and from the very bottom of the shaft came a bronze handle of a jug, decorated with a human head in relief. The investigations begun in 1936 at the eastern end of the citadel in square J 7 were continued and completed in 1937. Mrs. Blegen again had charge of this work, with Mrs. Hill as her assistant. The object of the undertaking was to uncover the broad open space or passage which lay between House VI G and the fortification wall, and to examine carefully the various layers of debris, with which the area had become filled. In the preliminary work done in 1936 a somewhat disturbed, super- ficial deposit, associated with some fragmentary walls and assignable to VIIb, had been removed; a well marked floor of VIIa had been found to extend over two rooms, which were separated by a stone wall and each of which contained several 1 A.J.A. xxxix, 1935, pp. 571 f.</page><page sequence="29">EXCAVATIONS AT TROY, 1937 581 large pithoi; the floor itself, covered with burned debris and discolored by the fire which had obviously destroyed the house, was seen to have been laid over a great mass of fallen stones, evidently shaken down from the buildings on either side by the earthquake that fixes the end of the Sixth Settlement; and finally a wide trans- verse trench had revealed an underlying accumulation of Troy VI, the lower part of which was extremely rich in its yield of pottery. In the recent campaign the partition wall of VIIa was removed, together with the corresponding floors at 2.10 m. to 2.20 m. below our datum. The two pithoi still remaining in situ in the northern room proved to be virtually intact and of moderate size; one differs from all the others found in this region in having no raised horizontal bands about the body. A second pair of storage jars was taken out from the room beside House VI G, excavated in 1934; and a third pair was uncovered in the house called by Di*rpfeld VII L, a small portion of which at the south end of our area had been spared when Schliemann's South- east Trench was dug. The VIIa floor in this room, or house, lay some 0.50 m. deeper than the floor we have just mentioned, as the ground level both in Troy VI and VIIa apparently sloped downward toward the south from its highest point behind Tower VIh. Immediately beneath the VIIa floors, except where the deposit had been disturbed when pits were dug for the setting of the pithoi, fallen stones made their appearance in the debris in considerable numbers (Fig. 19), espe- cially in the northern part of our area FIG. 19.-FALLEN STONES BELOW FLOOR OF VIIA behind Tower VIh. Some clear signs of burning were associated with this "earth- quake layer," particularly toward the west alongside House VI G, and one might conclude that the seismic disturbance was followed in some places, at any rate, by a conflagration. The debris continued without much change down to ca. 3.20 m. be- low our datum, where it rested on a well-trodden floor or pavement. This latter corresponded admirably in level with the doorway, traces of which had been noted by Mrs. Blegen in 1936 in the east wall of House VI G, although later reconstruction had for the most part filled the opening. In a further examina- tion of the doorway, Mrs. Blegen was able to identify, still in place, one block of the north jamb and two or three of the south jamb, observing that the edge of the stone in each instance had been worn smooth and highly polished by the constant rubbing against it of those who passed in and out, a clear demonstration that the opening served as a door and not as a window. The threshold lay considerably higher than the floor with the great stone column-base inside House VI G; and two steps, perhaps of wood, must have been provided to make ingress and exit easy, unless indeed the doorway was constructed in a later phase of VI after the original floor of the house had been buried under an accumulation of debris some 0.50 im. to</page><page sequence="30">582 CARL W. BLEGEN 0.60 m. deep. In the period when the door in the middle of its long side was in use, House VI G was at all events certainly not a proper megaron. At this same time a high, narrow wall, with well-finished north end and west face, was built opposite the doorway against the back of the Sixth City wall, but its purpose is not clear, for we found no vestige of cross-walls to north and south, by which the area might have been enclosed and converted into a room. The isolated east wall had been erected across the top of a narrow, stone-lined shaft, exactly like the miniature "wells" described in our report for last year. Consequently we now have six of these peculiar pits close behind the Sixth City wall, and they seem to be grouped in three pairs, one pair in square J 7-8, one in J 6-7 and one in J 6. No satisfac- tory explanation of their use has yet come to light. The wall pass- ing over the new " well " must belong to the last phase of Troy VI, for its upper part was shaken down in the earthquake that indicates the end of the Sixth Settlement. Digging on down through the floor at 3.20 m. below our da- tum Mrs. Blegen came upon a deposit some 0.80 mn. deep, formed of several distinctly marked layers of de- bris, but apparently all laid down together FIG. 20. - LAYERS OF CRUSHED M\UREX SHELLS within a short space of time, for potsherds from the top, middle and bottom of the deposit were found to join together, belonging to one and the same vase. Several of the layers so clearly differentiated were composed almost wholly of crushed murex shells by the thousands (Fig. 20), and these strata can be traced continuously some 20 or 30 m. northward into square J 6. There can be little doubt that the pas- sage between the Sixth City wall and the large houses VI E, VI F, and VI G was treated as a repository for rubbish from a purple-factory. Indeed, the establish- ment may have occupied this open space itself, and it is possible that the diminu- tive "wells" had some function in connection with the purple industry. Numerous stone grinders and pounders and fragments of worn millstones recovered here were doubtless used to crush the shells. The deposit contained vast quantities of potsherds, mainly of local gray and</page><page sequence="31">EXCAVATIONS AT TROY, 1937 583 yellow Trojan wares, but including many fragments of imported Mycenaean vases. These latter are of a transitional character, ranging from a late stage of the "Palace Style" of L.H. II to an early phase of L.H. III. Our layer clearly corres- ponds to the early floor deposit found by Mr. Caskey inside and outside House VI F, and in a few instances fragments from one area proved actually to join pieces from the other. Much patient effort was devoted to the task of fitting our frag- mentary material together, and by the end of the season we had been able to re- construct 14 vases of various shapes and sizes (Figs. 21-22). Several are vessels that must have been imported from Mycenae, or some other Mycenaean center, about 1400 B.c., the most notable being a tall three-handled jar decorated with a design of large heart-shaped leaves, part of which was discovered in 1936.1 Some addi- tional pots may yet be recovered by further labor, but unfortunately the bulk of the material is hopelessly shattered. This rich deposit came to its end at ca. 4 m. to 4.10 m. below our datum, where the earth became extremely hard and firm and fragments of pottery far less FIG. 21.-JAR WITH BRIDGED SPOUT, TROY VI FIG. 9.--FOUR-LEGGED ASKOS, TROY VI abundant. We had no time to dig into this underlying layer, but it must certainly belong to a relatively early phase of Troy VI. Since its discovery and excavation by Professor Diirpfeld in 1894, the east fortification wall of Troy VI has justly been regarded, together with its contiguous Tower VIh, as constituting one of the most imposing and monumental architectural features of the site. The wall has, however, always been so closely hemmed in by the massive Roman foundation almost paralleling it on the east, that visitors have never been able to find a vantage point from which a comprehensive, unobstructed view of the whole great defensive system might be enjoyed. It was necessary either to mount a high embankment and look down on the wall as into a pit, or to descend into the deep cutting and look up at the wall without having adequate space to withdraw far enough to obtain a general view. During the season of 1937 we deter- mined, mainly in the interest of visitors, to expose the wall and the tower, so that they might be seen properly and in their entirety in a suitable setting, a large task involving not a little otherwise unrequited labor; but we hoped at the same time it might give us an opportunity to examine an addition to the fortification wall, appar- ently built in VIIa, and to study the strata of periods VII and VI outside the fortress. 1 A.J.A. xli, 1937, p. 35, fig. 15.</page><page sequence="32">584 CARL W. BLEGEN Work was accordingly begun at the southern end of square K 6, and under the direction of Professor Semple a broad cutting was carried southward through K 7 and K 8 until the whole of the space between the east and west foundation walls of the early Roman colonnade, called by Darpfeld IX M, had been cleared down to the ground-level of period VIIa. As the accumulation here was more than 6 m. deep, a vast amount of earth had to be removed, much of it clearly debris from previous excavations. The laying of the Roman foundations in deep wide trenches dug through the earlier deposit, the construction of a great stone drain under the colonnade, and some other intrusions had sadly disturbed the pre-Roman layers, and it was only when we reached a depth of ca. 5 m. or 5.50 m. that we began to find strata more or less nearly free from contamination. A good many sherds of Buckelkeramik and a portion of a wall built with a row of orthostates indicated that some of the overlying deposit had been laid down in period VIIb; but the first definitely marked floor - which also showed many signs of burning - was that belonging to VIIa. Several walls of this period were uncovered and it is clear that at this time houses were built outside the citadel. These buildings were oriented roughly from northeast to southwest, and in consequence they had been cut off and damaged by the deep Roman foundations, which were carried down to native rock. No complete house was brought to light, but part of one room still preserved a fairly rich floor- deposit: the pottery included two shallow plates, two shallow curving bowls (Fig. 23), one handsome jug and the greater portions of FIG. ,3. - SHALLOW BOWL, TROY VIIA two others, and almost the whole of a huge "pilgrim flask," all good examples of excellent VIIa ware. Under this floor a layer of Troy VI appeared, yielding quan- tities of potsherds and apparently including house-walls; but, to our regret, time did not permit a real examination of this stratum. The piece of fortification wall, assigned by Dirpfeld to period VIIa, probably once stretched all the way across from the east pier of the East Gate to the corner of Tower VIh, representing a small enlargement of the acropolis in the time of the Seventh Settlement. This was one of the questions we hoped to be able to settle, but unfortunately the southern part of the VIIa wall had been completely demol- ished when the west foundations of the Roman colonnade were laid, and we could not trace it beyond the point already reached by Dirpfeld. The purpose of this modification of the enceinte in VIIa has never been clearly understood. Perhaps when the damage caused by the earthquake that marks the end of Troy VI was being repaired at the beginning of the succeeding period, advantage was taken of the opportunity to enclose a little more ground within the citadel. In the debris that could not be certainly dated, well above the definite floor levels of VIIa, several interesting objects were recovered. One seems to be a crescent- shaped figurine, the head of which has been badly damaged. Made of rather coarse clay, it is coated apparently with a lead glaze, dark brown in color, on which details</page><page sequence="33">EXCAVATIONS AT TROY, 1937 585 are added in thick yellow pigment. The whole looks very much like a product of the old Canakkale potteries, but its place of finding would seem to preclude so late a date. A small mould of steatite or soapstone, for making ornaments and beads of glass paste, is notable for its delicate carving (Fig. 24). One of our finest pieces is a magnificently modelled horse's head in terracotta (Fig. 25), finished with a smoothly polished, black surface, which can be paralleled in the pottery of Troy VI, VII and VIII. When the excavation of the area was completed, the southern part of the west foundation of the colonnade IX M was taken down and moved away, together with the western portion of the stone drain already mentioned and a heavy adjacent substructure of hard limestone. This work required great care and attention to avoid accidents, since many of the blocks were very large and ponderous; but -ii~:iiiii:iiii:iii~ii~s:i?iii:~ii?iiii :-i---:i--;-:---:::-i-i:i?i:i-iii-:-:-il I:~:ii:ii:ic-i:i-i::-- :-:- _:-i_-li-:-::::i_--::::-:::-:::::?:::?-: :-:: -:-- :i-- :i-- --i: ::::::-: :.-. - :.- --- ------: -- i: ::: ii iii ii i:i ii- :- " '-' i::' -'i' -"'''''-- i:iii:i:i:iiii-;ici:iiiiiiii:iii:i-i:i:i :iiiiiii~iiiiiiiii iiiiii:i-ii:i:ii:i:~ili ii iiii:iiiiiiiiiii :: ::._ :;il--i::ii::----i_ i:::-:- -:-: -:-i iiii :- -:- -: ii i_ 1__ _il :_ _: -:::::i::::::: -::::::::: -:i:- ::::: :: :::::::::::::::::: ::::::::: i i-ii ii: i:::-- -- -: - - --- :- :i lii~i~iiiiiii~iiniiiisiiiiiiii~:-:-'::i 'i'i'i'iiiiiii~iii~iiiiiii-iiiiiiiiii-~i ..:... iiii-iiii_- '''-'':'-' "''''''''''''''''' ''''-':''''''' -:: -. -- _i_ ii ..: ii i, i: . -:- ::-:-:: - - -: ii:- i:iiii iiiiiiiiiiiiii iii i..;=;;;;;;;;;;;; :?:;;-:i.li;i i.,: I??i iilii - -iti:;.:i?; iiii iiiii?:-;:;. -6~rl~P ::::_-::_---:---_ :i:--i-i-i-i:-ii-i-i-i-i:ii:: :: :: iiiiiiiiii :.: iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii :: iiiiiii--i-i:i:i::_ i-i- .. .. .. ..: iiii iii :.: :.. ::. :: .. :. :: ... .. ii: iii .. :. -ii . :. i-i . i i-ii ii i:i :ii iiiiiiiiii~iii:i:i-i-i:ii~iiiriiiijiiii iii~ii,-i-i:i-i-ii-i-i- ::::::::::::_:-: -::: -: ::::-:i:-_-:--:::i:::i -i:-i:i--::::i::::::::-i-:iii:___-- ::::i:-::::-:::::: .:::.:_ :: :.: ... -- :-:- ::: -:-: :-:- :::::::::: :::: :::::::::: :::: ::::: ::: :::: :.. :...: :.:.. :. :-:- ::: :-- .. -:-: -:: ----- -i:- -:--- --- . -. ,iiiii~:i:iiiiieiii'iiiiiiiiEiiii- :: :::: -__::~_-- i-iiii:-_ii : :::::-:i:- -::: :::(: :::- :_::: ::- ::: :: : ::-:: _:-:_ . .. .. . : - : : ?::_:i_::_::_:-i-i-i:_i~::l---:i-,-::::: .::::. :::::::-:--i---iiiiiii-::-:i:i:iii-iiiii iiiiiiii iii . :iii:::-:i:(:-:-: :-:::::::::::::: ....... -:::-:::::::-: i-iiiiiiiiii:-:- : .:. ii - ::- .--- --:i--i-i-i:i- :::::::::::::::::: . i:I:-::::::i:-_::: :::::::::::::::::- ....... ..- _ ii ii i i_ . :::::-:- !:. :. :. ..:.:.. i:i- -i-i ::x::: ::::::::i:--::::-:ii::--:: ii_ : :ii-iiii :___ :: ::: ::: ::: :::: ..: :: :-: -(- : --,: :: -i:i i-i- _,,-ii .::. -i, -i :- :_ i- -- _ i' '-'i::'- i'- 1:- :- :: -: :-:-: _: -i . . .. .. .. . .:.. -- . :. - i_ ii , ..

The result of these labors has been to open up a broad space along the eastern side of the citadel. Tower VI h and the fortification wall now stand forth in their connection and continuity and may be seen in a manner more nearly worthy of their importance (Figs. 26-27). The eastern substructure of the colonnade IX M has been left untouched, to show the sturdy character of Roman foundations, and the eastern part of the drain may still be seen in place. Our excavations have also exposed the southern foundation wall of the colonnade, and between the latter and the line of the rear wall of the Bouleuterion we have cleared away a considerable mass of debris. The time available this season did not suffice for the completion of all the work we had planned in this region, but we feel that something worth while has been done to make the site more presentable and more easily comprehensible to those who come to see it. The excavations commenced in 1935 in squares A 7-8 on the southwestern flank of the acropolis were continued during the past season under the supervision of</page><page sequence="34">586 CARL W. BLEGEN Miss Dorothy Rawson, who has had charge of work in this area since its beginning. In the northern part of this sector, in A 7, digging was extended some 6.50 m. northwestward, where the discoveries of last year had given some hope that a good deposit of pottery belonging to the Eighth Settlement might come to light. A fairly extensive space was here available for investigation, lying between the fortification wall of Troy VI and the broad stepped foundation mentioned in our preceding report. A further study of this latter monument revealed that it was really the sub- structure of a long straight stand of seats, and scanty traces were observed of two of the aisles or stairways that had once divided it into sections. The northwestern end of this "theatral area" was recognized by Mr. Boulter in a well-built wall (Fig. Q8), which we unearthed in squares A 5-6, and the total length of the edifice was found to be ca. 38.76 m. Less than one-third of its extent has been exposed, but all the superstructure seems to have vanished; no seat has been found in place and no seat-block has been identified among the stones lying in the neighborhood. The foundation was apparently contemporary with the marble podium or altar, which represents the final stage in the use of the sanctuary discovered by Miss Rawson in square A 8, and the "grand-stand" was presumably erected to serve as a place of assembly, from which spectators could watch ceremonies that took place in the open space before the altar. At the top of the "theatre," behind the seats, there may have been a broad passage, or even a colonnade, for the lower courses of what seems to be the rear wall of the structure were found still standing some 4.50 m. beyond the topmost preserved step of the foundation. The extreme northwestern part of this wall was identified by Mr. Boulter in A 5-6, where it bonds with the end-wall of the "stand" in a well-built corner. A substantially constructed stone drain, partly coated with waterproof plaster, here runs along the rear of the building, no doubt intended to carry off rain-water and prevent the seats from being flooded. In the area, 6.50 m. long, chosen for exploration in A 7, Miss Rawson, after removing a heap of loose earth from former excavations, first examined a late Hellenistic layer, exposing the remains of the rear wall of the "grand-stand," which was still preserved to a height of four courses. When this had been studied and recorded, it was taken out, together with an adjacent stone platform, probably of contemporary date, and the accompanying fill. About 0.50 m. below the bottom of the wall we reached an undisturbed level of Troy VIII, signalled by the appearance of a small stone-paved circle, exactly like those found farther southward in 1936. The next metre of deposit proved to be the product of gradual accumulation during the life of the Eighth Settlement, in which six successive layers of these puzzling circular stone pavements were laid down one after the other. Some layers had one or two, others three or four circles (Fig. 929), and the total number uncovered was 16, two of which had already been partially disclosed in 1936. The aggregate for the two seasons is thus 23 in this small area, hardly more than 1R m. long. Some of the circles were complete and well preserved, others badly damaged; they varied considerably in size, the diameters ranging from 1.50 m. to 2.S5 m. Several were neatly edged with small orthostates, while others had one or two bordering courses of fairly regularly cut stones. The</page><page sequence="35">IG 6.

BLEGEN surface in most instances sloped downward toward the center, and the stones were generally set in sand, in one example, coated with clay plaster. No new evidence was observed to establish the purpose of these stone circles, and we have no explana- tion to offer beyond the conjectures submitted last year. Immediately below the deepest of the circles, Miss Rawson came upon the walls and floor of a small building, shown by the accompanying potsherds to belong to an early phase of Troy VIII. The house (Fig. 30) was oriented from northwest to southeast, lying roughly parallel to the Sixth City wall, but the original length could not be determined, as the southeastern end wall had completely vanished. The portion preserved had a length of ca. 3.60 m. and a width of 3.20 m. An opening, probably for a door, appeared in the northwestern end just beside the southwestern lateral wall. The walls were well built, relatively narrow, two of them constructed with an outer and inner base course of small slabs set on edge, in the fashion of orthostates, with rubble filling; and the more or less nearly level top indicated that they were intended to bear a superstructure of crude brick. In the axis of the room was a large circular bothros, 1.27 m. in diameter, 0.50 m. deep, filled with soft earth and stones. The sherds recovered from the floor were relatively scanty, but to the west of the house Miss Rawson found a much richer ceramic deposit, which provided sufficient material for the restoration of several vases and gave us the beginning of the pottery-sequence of Troy VIII, represented by the fragments collected in the many layers of the stone circles. Directly underneath the building of Troy VIII a complex of walls appeared, and ultimately five small rooms were laid bare (Fig. 31), all belonging to a house of the Seventh Settlement, the greater part of which had been uncovered just to the south of this area in 1936. Apart from a stone pavement in one room, the floors are not well marked, and the character of this peculiar building with its many tiny rooms is not clearly understood. The walls are for the most part carefully built, with the regular use of small orthostates in the lowest course. A few sherds of Buckelkeramik were found this year, but most of the potsherds are of the traditional gray and yellow local wares, and if the house is to be assigned to VIIb, it must be to an early phase of that period. In the lower part of her sector, in A 8, Miss Rawson undertook, with the collabo- ration of Dr. B. H. Hill from June 18 to July 10, an intensive examination and study of the sanctuary she had previously brought to light. This task, which involved much careful digging in many different places throughout the precinct and a wide expansion of the excavation toward the south and southwest, has not yet been completed; but already a great deal has been learned about the long and complicated history of this interesting shrine. The oldest structure yet recognized in it still seems to be the curious apsidal altar (Fig. 32), described in our report of last year; and remnants of an enclosing wall, apparently belonging to the same early phase of Troy VIII, have been identified just to the south. Corresponding probably to a repair or remodelling of the altar, the precinct was enlarged southward, a new and higher wall being built to enclose it. The new wall, partly curving and partly straight, is pierced by a rectangular opening for drainage, and its well-finished outer face shows that the ground level here lay much below that inside. The wall has been</page><page sequence="37">FIG. 30.--HouSE OF TROY VIII FIG. 31.--SMALL ROOMS OF HOUSE OF SEVENTH SETTLE- MENT FIG. 32. --APSIDAL ALTAR OF TROY VIII FIG. 33.--TERRACE WALL IN PRECINCT FIG. 34. - FOUNDATIONS OF TWO SMALL ALTARS FIG. 35.--WALL OF TROY VI IN A 4-5</page><page sequence="38">590 CARL W. BEEGEN followed westward to a corner, where it turns sharply toward the north. Along with local Trojan ware of Troy VIII, fragments of imported vases in early Corinthian style were found to help date this phase. The entrance into the precinct was probably always at the southwestern corner, but owing to the frequent rebuilding of the enclosure, with only slight changes of level, the remains of the early gateways have been almost completely destroyed. However, four separate walls may be traced extending northward from the corner: one, in which there is an opening with three steps (Fig. 33), may have been built to support a low terrace, but the others are certainly successive precinct-walls, and there can be little doubt that the latest in the series (wall "B " on our plan) was also continued along the northerly side of the sanctuary, where a piece in the same style of masonry may still be seen, passing obliquely under the massive Hellenistic retaining wall. What modification the altar had suffered during these successive periods we cannot yet say with certainty, but the ground-level had been steadily rising, and the old apsidal structure must at length have been completely buried. The continuity of the sacrificial cult was maintained, however, by the construction of a pit lined with stone slabs which led down to the original altar. This pit, filled with gray ashy earth of the same character as that filling the apsidal altar itself, and presumably contemporary with the latest in the series of the enclosing walls we have just mentioned (possibly to be assigned to the fifth century), was later incorporated in the rectangular limestone foundation of the first Hellenistic "podium. " With this structure it is clear that we come, early in the Hellenistic Age, to a new era in the history of the sanctuary. The whole precinct was rebuilt on a larger scale than before. It was now laid out as a square, measuring 14.30 m. on a side. Although the easterly portion is still unexcavated and the southerly wall has been almost totally demolished, it was possible to determine the position of all four corners. The surrounding wall was constructed of well-cut blocks, laid in an alter- nating series with three courses of paired orthostates set back to back above the euthynteria, then a low binding course, then orthostates again. Both faces of the wall were meant to be visible. A small gateway, projecting southward at the south- west corner, provided access. A new altar was erected at the center of the precinct (but not aligned with the latter) in the form of a stepped podium of limestone blocks (Fig. 32), care being taken to preserve the old sacrificial pit which main- tained the connection with the more ancient altar. The superstructure was probably of poros, though none of it has been found. Against the precinct-wall at the south a deep well was dug to provide water; lined with shaped stones to hardpan, then hewn in the rock to a total depth of 0.30 m., it had a crowning curb formed of four well-fitting rounded blocks. Exactly how long the sanctuary continued to stand in this state we are yet unable to say, but still in the Hellenistic period changes began to be made. The north wall was transformed into a monumental retaining wall, its face being recon- structed with larger and heavier blocks of hard limestone, reinforced behind by massive blocks of soft limestone, not meant to be seen. Only the euthynteria and some original courses spared at the northwest corner have survived to betray the</page><page sequence="39">EXCAVATIONS AT TROY, 1937 591 character of the earlier wall. Perhaps it was at the time these changes were effected that the altar was also remodelled, its superstructure being replaced in marble. That the marble blocks were dressed and that their mouldings were carved here on the spot seems to be indicated by a layer of fine marble chips noted in the fill just below the new ground-level. It is also possible that we should assign to this period a new well, dug a few metres to the southeast of the other; the shaft is actually just outside the south precinct-wall, but the stone platform surrounding it rests in part on the wall, and rises almost like a tower, high above the ground outside, while it was clearly accessible from inside the sanctuary. This well had a depth of 21.60 m. and, owing to the protection afforded by a covering slab, it was only half full of earth, stones and other debris. The well yielded vast quantities of animal bones, numerous fragments of plain water-jars, six jugs being more or less nearly intact, and some further potsherds, all apparently of Hellenistic date. Another turning point in the history of the sanctuary was marked by the partial destruction of the northern retaining wall. It seems to have been chiefly the upper part of the wall that was affected, probably a parapet-like construction in which much of the material of the earlier precinct-wall had been re-employed. As men- tioned in our report for 1936, the stones had fallen into the precinct, where they lay roughly in rows presumably corresponding to their courses. What physical effect this accident had on the altar itself is not clear, but it appears to have been followed at once by a complete reconstruction of the sanctuary. The ground-level was now raised ca. 1.50 m. by a fill of debris; a new rectangular foundation of soft limestone was built farther to the west, being laid directly over the earlier precinct wall, and to it was transferred the marble superstructure of the altar, some of the blocks of which probably required slight reworking to be fitted into their new places. The well in the precinct was built up in three courses of roughly joined stone blocks to the new level, to which the other well with its high platform was conveniently adjusted. And at the same time, as we have already mentioned, a great theatral stand of seats was erected to the northwest, looking down on the open space before the altar. For this period, representing the last phase in the long history of the sanctuary, no precinct-wall has been found. The exact date of the final reconstruction is still to be determined, although we were led by the evidence available last year to assign it provisionally to the end of the first century B.C. Some time after the destruction of the first Hellenistic precinct a huge stone drain was built, utilizing as its floor the top of the foundation of the eastern precinct-wall. What specific purpose was served by this drain we have still no means of knowing, and it has not yet become clear to what exact period its construction must be assigned. No fresh evidence has come to light to identify more closely the cult which had its seat through so many centuries on the southwestern slope of the citadel, but that the whole region was one of traditional sanctity is indicated by the discovery on a lower terrace just to the south of our sanctuary of another nameless temenos, which likewise seems to have subsisted through several periods. The remains uncovered comprise the foundations of two small altars of early Hellenistic date (Fig. 34, p: 589), and portions of the eastern and western enclosing walls, which appear</page><page sequence="40">592 CARL W. BLEGEN to have been built in Roman times. It was here that a mass of terracotta figurines, mentioned in our report for 1936, was found; we have still to determine whether they are to be associated with the upper or the lower shrine. This and many other problems can only be solved by further careful study and investigation, but the foregoing summary of the history of the shrine may serve to show how much knowl- edge has already been won by the patient labor of Miss Rawson and Mr. Hill. During our campaigns of 1934 and 1935 Dr. F. W. Goethert undertook an ex- tensive exploration at the northwestern angle of the acropolis in squares A 4-5, with the primary object of finding and tracing the fortification wall of Troy VI (if it existed) beyond the point to which Dirpfeld had exposed it. In his first season he speedily discovered that the wall already known ended, in square A 5, with a finished face, which had been concealed by a buttress-like addition of later date. Dr. Goethert, concluding that the finished end of the wall had probably formed one side of a gateway, opened up a wide area toward the north, in the hope of revealing the other side of the gate and the continuation of the wall. After removing an enormous superficial accumulation of dump from Schliemann's excavations, however, he encountered an immense fill of Hellenistic debris, which spread over the greater part of A 4-5 to a tremendous depth. Most of the labor of two cam- paigns was devoted to the task of carrying away this unproductive earth, and Dr. Goethert's meagre recompense was to find, at the extreme north, an undisturbed terrace, occupied by the remains of a habitation of Troy V, beside which stood an isolated section of a massive wall built in the style of Troy VI; and, almost at the extreme south, the walls of a house of the Sixth Settlement, supported, as it were, on a small pinnacle of untouched early deposit, in the midst of the Hellenistic fill. The bottom of this fill had not yet been reached at the conclusion of the season of 1935. Dr. Goethert was unable to return in 1936, and it was not until the present year that we found it again possible to resume work in A 4-5, with Mr. Boulter in charge of operations. He, too, was obliged to spend the major part of the campaign in superintending the removal of dump, but ultimately our efforts were rewarded and, to our gratification, we found that the intrusive deposit rested on the substantial remains of the great fortification wall of Troy VI, which we had so long been seeking. The portion of the wall preserved (Fig. 35, p. 589), still standing to a height of seven courses, is only the substructure. Having a thickness of 5.50 m. to 6.00 m., and founded on a bed cut in native rock, it is built of large, roughly squared blocks of hard limestone, with smaller stones used to fill the interstices. A gap 1.50 m. wide separates the newly found section of the wall from the old, and it is clear that there was a gateway here; but, as the foundations projected somewhat from the face of the wall, the gate-opening must have been considerably wider than the gap. From its southern end, where the bed-cutting lies at ?1.30 m. above sea-level, the new wall runs in a north-northwest direction some 8 m., then, after an angle, it proceeds 10 m. farther in a north-northeasterly line, this whole section being founded on native rock. From this point it mounted steeply, its footing being adjusted not on rock, but on step-like cuttings in a hard-packed stratum of Troy V. A short piece, some 2.50 m. long, has been completely destroyed before we come to the section</page><page sequence="41">EXCAVATIONS AT TROY, 1937 593 discovered by Dr. Goethert, rising against the terrace of Troy V. Bed-cuttings may be traced eastward across this terrace, 6.50 m. wide, and one large, characteristic block still lies in the place prepared for it, at 27.65 m. above sea-level. Still farther eastward, in square A 4, yet another section was found, with four courses still preserved in situ, the lowest resting at 28.90 m. above the sea; and beyond it massive blocks hewn in the style of Troy VI are seen to continue eastward as far as the edge of Schliemann's Northwest Trench, although they have been for the most part so disturbed that the exact line of the wall can no longer be determined. Our long labor in this quarter had thus restored to us some 35 m. of the fortified circuit of the Sixth Settlement. The new piece is of no little importance, for we can follow the wall as it rises from the northwestern corner of the enceinte high up to the top of the plateau and begins its eastward course across the northern side of the citadel. There can be no doubt that it once continued all the way across to the Northeast Tower, but, apart from the short section of foundation uncovered this season by Mr. Sperling in square G 3, such remains of it as were not destroyed in the multitudinous disasters and reconstructions of the acropolis in ancient times were doubtless demolished by Schliemann, when he relentlessly carried his excava- tion down to the level of the "Second City". The level of the road passing through the newly found gate must have been at ca. 27.00 m. above sea-level. Like the Northeast Tower, the northwestern corner of the wall thus had tremendously deep foundations. It was built in the best traditions of Sixth City architecture, in the magnificent manner of the South Wall, in striking contrast to the inferior style and workmanship of the section running through squares A 6 and 7 between our new gateway and Gate VI U. Why two adjacent parts of the wall should differ so greatly in character has not yet been satisfactorily explained. At any rate it is clear that the northwestern corner of the fortification, if not meant to be an exact counterpart of the great Northeast Tower, balanced it worthily, and with its lofty, sloping face, and its angular shape, it must itself have presented a massive, tower-like appearance when viewed from the outside. Its outer face projects considerably westward from the line of the wall to the south of the gate (Fig. 36), and there is some evidence to suggest that the projection was designed to command the approach to the entrance, for a roadway seems to have ascended from the south along the wall, to turn sharply at right angles into the gateway. A sturdy wall, which may have supported the western side of this ramp, was uncovered by Mr. Boulter, but superposed house-walls, containing orthostates in the style of VIIb, and a later construction, apparently dating from the time of the Eighth Settlement, have so badly disturbed the earlier remains that we cannot be certain of details. Apparently in its original position, at the north end of the presumable retaining wall, where it must have been backed against the projecting angle we have mentioned, stands a huge block of limestone (Fig. 36), almost exactly like the well-known pillars set along the face of Tower VI i, beside the South Gate. Its significance could not be more closely determined, but it seems likely that we have here, too, a religious monument of some kind belonging to the time of the Sixth Settlement. Mr. Boulter's researches made it clear that the immense deposit of Hellenistic</page><page sequence="42">594 CARL W. BLEGEN debris had been brought to fill a huge cavity which had been formed by ruthless quarrying into the Sixth City wall, in quest of building material. He was also able to determine with reasonable certainty the date of the depredation, for he observed that a neighboring section of the city wall of the Hellenistic Age was built to a great extent of large limestone blocks of the same character and of the same general dimensions as those still remaining in the foundations of the Sixth City wall. When the Hellenistic debris had been completely removed, it became possible, although much of the evidence was lacking, to study the newly found wall in relation to the stratified deposit beside it. A sharply defined Baugrube to the west and the south showed that the wall had been laid in a broad trench, cut through an already existing accumulation. Mr. Boulter examined it and found that it com- prised layers representing an early stage of Troy VI, as well as of Troy V and IV. After the construction of the wall and the filling of the Baugrube, a large pit had apparently been dug against the foundations. Considerable matter was burned in this hollow, leav- ing a thick, black carbonized layer, with charred bits of wood. The pit, filled again before the Sixth Settlement came to its end, contained quantities of sherds and animal bones, including a complete skeleton, probably of a dog. The house of Troy VI, discovered by Dr. Goethert, lay in part over the Baugrube outside the wall. We thus see that on the west slope, as well as else- where, habitations of the Sixth Settle- ment were built outside the citadel. FIG. 36.-WALL OF TROY VI FROM NORTH, SHOW- ING SIDE OF GATEWAY AND UPRIGHT PILLAR In the northern part of the area were found remains of a thick wall, constructed of stone, with a superstructure of crude brick, and assignable to Troy V. It might be part of a fortification wall of that period, destroyed when the enceinte of the Sixth Settlement was built. Still farther north lay a massive circular pavement of large stone slabs, beside which was a deep narrow pit, dated by accompanying potsherds to an early phase of Troy VI. And, in conclusion, omitting some further items not without interest, it may suffice merely to mention some house-walls and an undis- turbed floor-deposit containing much pottery, apparently of Troy IV or V, which Mr. Boulter discovered directly beneath the easternmost preserved section of the newly found Sixth City wall. As in former years, much labor was devoted to the pottery, but although nine washers and menders were continuously employed throughout the season and the members of the staff participated in the task as much as their other duties permitted, we were not able to work over all the abundant material recovered. Many important series of sherds from the central part of the acropolis, from the excavation outside</page><page sequence="43">EXCAVATIONS AT TROY, 1937 595 the eastern walls in K 7-8, from the region of the South Gate and from F 8-9 are still awaiting examination, and some accumulations from 1936 have not yet been adequately scrutinized. We hope it may be possible in 1938 to do justice to all this material and to complete our detailed study of the ceramic history of the site, which is now so richly documented. In 1937, some 20 vases were entered by Miss Marion Rawson in our inventory of pottery, and our total collection of pots, more or less nearly complete, now exceeds 1000. The catalogue of Mycenaean potsherds drawn up by Professor Karo has already been mentioned. The fragments from the cemetery of the Sixth Settlement, dis- covered by Miss Dorothy Rawson in 1934, number 133, and among them Dr. Karo has found no piece that he is willing to assign to a date later than about the middle of the 14th century B.C. From the "earthquake-layer," between House VI E and FIG. 37. - SHERD OF EARLY HELLADIC WARE, TROY IV the Sixth City fortification wall, 112 sherds have been recorded; and here, too, there is not one example that can be dated appreciably after 1350 B.c. Dr. Karo's study thus gives an independent and authoritative confirmation of our own conclusion that the Sixth Settlement came to its end before the close of the 14th century. These sherds are not all of uniform quality, nor are they of the same provenance: many of the pots represented were doubtless made at Mycenae, or at one of the neighboring centers; others may be of provincial manufacture; and a fairly large group obviously comprises local Trojan imitations. An inventory was also begun of fragments belonging to imported vessels of earlier periods. Middle Helladic Matt-painted ware is exemplified by only 4 sherds, all found in the deeper layers of Troy VI. Early Helladic pottery (Fig. 37) is much more richly represented, including remains of many imported pieces as well as of much that can be regarded as a local imitation or adaptation. We have already catalogued 477 Early Helladic items. This material occurs fairly regularly in all the layers from the latest phases of Troy I to Troy V; and it thus offers a strong corrobo- ration of our view that the Early Bronze Age at Troy comes to its end with the</page><page sequence="44">596 CARL W. BLEGEN Fifth Settlement. A transitional phase between Troy V and VI and the early stages of the Sixth Settlement correspond to the Middle Bronze Age; and to the Late Bronze Age we must attribute the later part of Troy VI along with VIIa and VIIb. Miscellaneous objects of gold, silver, copper, bronze, lead, stone, bone, vitreous paste and terracotta, found in the excavations of 1937, were catalogued by Miss FIG. 38. - THREE GOLD PINS FIG. 39. -ANTHROPOMORPHIC FIGURE OF TERRA- COTTA, TROY VIIB. Dorothy Rawson to the number of 784. Among the pieces of outstanding interest may be mentioned 3 gold pins (Fig. 38), many fiddle shaped idols of stone, bone and terracotta, a crude anthropomor- phic terracotta figure of Troy VII b (Fig. 39), some good "brush-handles" of clay, several stone moulds for the making of paste ornaments, and a smooth disc of white marble; but for artistic merit chief place is probably taken by the handsome horse's head in terracotta discovered by Mr. Semple in area K 7-8 (Fig. 25). The numerous terracotta figurines, found by Miss Dorothy Rawson in 1936 out- side the sanctuary in A 8, were studied and inventoried by Professor Karo, who judged some 102 pieces worthy of cataloguing. They form an unusually homogeneous group, comprising mainly figures of draped standing or dancing girls of several differ- ent types, with only a few examples that might represent goddesses or cult images. The date of the deposit can be fixed to the 3rd or 2nd century B.C., but no evidence was obtained to identify definitely the cult itself: Athena and Artemis can be excluded, but Hera, Demeter, Eileithyia or Aphrodite is possible. The work accomplished by Mr. Gejvall deserves more than the passing reference given it at the beginning of this report. The animal bones and shells we have methodically collected from the outset of our excavations filled innumerable boxes, baskets and other containers, and every layer at Troy was represented more or less fully. Mr. Gejvall systematically examined this vast quantity of material, handling</page><page sequence="45">EXCAVATIONS AT TROY, 1937 597 more than 150,000 bones; most of them were discarded after the relative frequencies had been recorded, but typical specimens and the better preserved significant pieces were kept, inventoried and numbered to a total of 5973. More than 20 species of quadrupeds were recognized, and Mr. Gejvall's study will give us a fairly com- plete record of the domestic and wild animals which were mainly utilized for food during all the successive periods of occupation of the site. A detailed discussion of this important evidence will find its place in the definitive publication we plan to devote to the results of our excavations at Troy. Here it may suffice merely to mention a few of the general conclusions. Sheep, goats and swine provided the bulk of the meat-supply from earliest times down to the latest. Wild deer were always eaten, in abundance from the time of the Second Settlement, but especially in the Third and Fourth. The horse makes its first appearance in Troy VI and is common in the following periods. In Troy VII large carnivora of the leopard family may be recognized, and the bear is represented. Throughout the whole of its history, but more particularly in the earlier epochs, the settlement seems to have depended greatly on sea-food, as we may conclude from countless shells of many species, bones of fish, and even claws of lobsters. Fowl likewise formed a considerable part of the diet in all ages, and many kinds of birds can be distinguished. A rich supplementary collection of material made during the season of 1937 has provided another complete sequence of animal bones and shells which we have kept for future study as a check on the results already obtained. In concluding this report I desire on behalf of the expedition to thank all the members of the staff for their unremitting, loyal, and understanding collaboration; our friends Mr. and Mrs. F. H. Bacon and Mr. and Mrs. Godfrey Whittall of Canakkale, for much good counsel and aid; and Dr. Lee Foshay of Cincinnati, who has again contributed much to ensure our physical welfare. We are particularly grateful to the Government of the Turkish Republic which has generously per- mitted us to continue our excavations at the site of Troy; and we take pleasure in acknowledging our especial obligation to H. E. Saffet Arikan, Minister of Education; Dr. Hamit Kosay, Director of the Department of Antiquities in the Ministry; Mr. Aziz Ogan, Director of the Museum in Istanbul; and Halil Alyanak, our Commissioner.
