<plain_text><page sequence="1">Joseph W. Zdenek, ed., The World of Nature in the Works of Federico Garcia Lorca. Rock Hill, S. C: Winthrop Studies on Major Modern Writers, 1980, 150 pp. Winthrop College of South Carolina initiated in 1978 the admirable practice of holding an annual symposium on a major modern writer, then publishing a selection of the papers presented at that conference. The theme of the Proustian novel was followed a year later by a symposium on Nature in Lorca, which in turn produced this volume of thirteen essays, seven of them on Lorca's poetry, five on his theatre, and one bridging the two genres. As one would expect, the quality of the collection is uneven, which may or may not be related to the predisposition, however laudable in theory, to include ?contributions of young scholars...as well as established ones,?</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 357 since the application of any norms other than qualitative ones for contributions to a symposium or collection of essays runs an immediate risk of mediocrity. Be the lat ter as it may, the good and the bad in this case run the gamut from long experience to a sheer lack of it, so that there is no discernible correlation, except perhaps in matters of style. Two long-time lor quistas?Gustavo Correa and Maria Teresa Babin?give stature to the volume with the penetrating vision of Lorca and deftness of style one has come to expect of them, while a third?Michael Flys?is, paradox ically, responsible for the poorest essay in the collection. Correa's study is concerned with the ?Mythification of Nature? in Lorca's poetry and takes the reader through an elaboration of three ?spectacles of nature?: one ?in an anthropomorphic context of mutually interrelated movements,? a second ?woven into an integrated story, in which man is an active participant,? and a third which ?is seen objectively as a mythical story? but which ?has an avowed direct relationship to the inner life of the poet? (p. 3). Like Correa, Babin draws examples from all facets of Lorquian poetry in her essay ?The Voice of Nature in the Life of the Water.? Hers, however, is less dense than Correa's; there is a greater presence of Federico the person, and more dependence on personal sensibility than on the kind of analytical intensity that marks the Correa piece. The two studies complement each other well. The Flys essay, which is called ?The Changing View of Nature...,? is a misguided and highly specious attempt to apply to Lorca's poetic trajectory Valle-Incl?n's famous dictum on the three postures a writer may adopt in viewing the world. The result does a serious disservice to both writers, not to mention the reader. Of the other four articles on Lorca's poetry, the most impressive is Bonnie Shannon McSorley's analysis of three poems of the Romancero gitano called ?Nature's Sensual and Sexual Aspects in Three Gypsy Ballads...,? the three being ?Preciosa y el aire,? ?Romance de la luna, luna,? and ?Romance son?mbulo.? The basis of the article is that through a ?wealth of metaphors of sensuality and sexuali ty... nature interacts directly with the human psyche or stands aside to observe the human condition with an attitude ranging from sympathetic, to indifferent, to open ly antagonistic? (p. 81). Despite a minor contradiction here and there, and one or two strange interpretative statements, the McSorley essay is intelligent, well pondered, and well written. ?The Yes and No of Lorca's Ocean? by Florence Yuden addresses a ?poetics of fusion? to ?examine how the poet creates a vision of man and nature based on ambivalence and paradox.? She proposes in her paper ?a con textual analysis of the motif of the sea in Lorca's poetry, for which more than eighty references attest a phenomenon highly charged with conflictive properties? (p. 117). As the quote suggests, the article is rife with fashionable jargon rising out of a dark night of the computerized soul (actually there are 83 references to mar, 12 to mares in all of Lorca). In contrast, the article called ?Two Aspects of Nature in Libro de poemas...? by Candelas Newton is a trivialization of that early collection of the poet, which is heightened by a style often as juvenile as the Yuden style is obscure. In</page><page sequence="3">358 ALEC, 6 (1981) both cases the stylistic shortcomings handicap a grasp of Lorca which more often than not is quite good. Lastly, there is ?The Mythical Aspect of Death in the Natural World of the Romancero gitano? by James Larkins, which tells the reader much more about the author's preoccupation with the history of myths than it does about Lorca. One mention of dogs in ?Muerto de amor? prompts some two pages on the history of the symbolism of that animal in various cultures. Interesting, but not especially relevant. Even more subversive vis-?-vis the article's usefulness are naive pronouncements like the lead sentence, which maintains that one of Lorca's pur poses in writing his Romancero ?was to create and perpetuate the myth of the An dalusian gypsy? (p. 91). The essays on Lorca's theatre are perhaps even more disparate qualitatively than those on his poetry. One is an uninspired gloss of El maleficio de la mariposa (?Imagery and Theme...? by Ruth Ay?ndez-Alder); another belabors the more ob vious uses of doors and windows in the plays to transmit a ?Luring Call of Nature,? apparently without the author (Marie-Lise Gazarian-Gautier) having read Eric Bentley, or anyone else for that matter, who might have contributed some substance to the theme; a third is a reasonable study of Bernarda Alba (?Nature as Unnatural? by Barry Weingarten) but offers no new insights; a fourth (?Imagery of Nature and its Function...? by David Loughran) would deny the implications of tragedy in ?Reyerta? and Bodas de sangre and have us take Lorca's view of death to be that of ?one more performance of an ongoing natural show, a show to be enacted with the same regularity as that of sunset or the harvesting of wheat? (p. 60), with man sim ply another victim of the meaninglessness and inevitability of uncontrollable natural forces. (Loughran's perception of Lorca's attitude toward nature reminds one of the indifference of Joyce's artist who manipulated his characters with God-like in visibility while casually trimming his fingernails.) The other two essays on Lorca's theatre fall, ironically enough, at the other end of the qualitative spectrum, since they are probably the most original contributions to be found in the collection. Harriet Turner's is one of the few penetrating views available anywhere on the unity of the three tragedies. Called ?Circularity and Closure in Lorca's Trilogy,? the article approaches the plays both poetically and thematically, through a series of metaphors and ?radii of action? which promote, among other things, linkage, interlocking antithetical pairs, and ?reductive cir cularity? and eventually lead to the definitive entrapment of the characters and closure of the tragic circle. As perceptive as this piece is, however, it suffers severely from an overwrought verbal density which obscures the argumentation and sabotages its cogency. In contrast, Robert ter Horst's article on Yerma (?Nature against Nature...?) is a model of stylistic sophistication achieved without sacrificing clarity. The argument here is based on a view of the play as a ?cruel inverse conjuga tion? (p. 47) of Juan's abundant fertility as a husbandman and his obstinate refusal to alleviate Yerma's ?famine.? To explain it, ter Horst offers two explanations; one</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 359 is ritualistic: Yerma is a sacrifice made to assure the fertility of Juan's natural world; the other is artistic: Juan is an artist ?who, to be able to create in breadth and depth, only grudgingly expends sexually a vital substance? (p. 50). While the reader (like myself) may have trouble accepting this view of a dreadfully prosaic man as a ?magical? (ter Horst's word) creative artist, the substance of the article is such that it cannot be ignored. In fact, it is precisely this kind of originality which makes the Winthrop volume as a whole, despite its unevenness, a worthwhile addition to the Lorca shelf. SUMNER M.
