Marsh Art Gallery, University of Richmond Museums, Richmond, Virgin ia, 2001. 96 pp. 78 illustrations. $15 At the core of I. Webb Surratt, Jr.'s print collection, donated to the Marsh Art Gallery at the University of Richmond Museums by his fam ily in 1996, is a remarkable group of prints by the baroque master Stefano della Bella (1610—64). While Phyllis Massar's work on the artist remains preeminent, this catalogue of a spring show organized at the Marsh provides a thoughtful summary of his career and oeuvre by guest cura tor Charles Johnson, as well as fur ther evidence of the riches to be found in some of this country's smaller public collections. And it allows a tantalizing glimpse into Della Bellas rather rarified world; for in his capacity as designer-print maker to the Medici court, and later to the court of Louis XIV in Paris, he almost obsessively recorded con temporary events and scenes ranging from public and court festivals to battles, landscapes, and animals. Most of these works were sold by his pub lishers to collectors of both mercan tile and noble rank. But although often couched within traditional iconographie formulae, his etchings reveal a vitality that points to his habit of mining elements from sketches made mostly out of doors or in situ. Della Bellas famous ani mal prints, for example, although based on ancient sources showing animal hunts and symbolism that had been revived during the Ren aissance, are also unusually realistic— and some, like the defiant ostrich from the series Hunts of Different Animals of 1654, also embody a cer tain anthropomorphic charm. View of the Pont Neuf in Paris (ca. 1646) promoted Henri IV s modernization of the city, yet also presents a vivid picture of its swarms of ordinary in habitants (among them a tooth puller, duelists, sellers of sweetmeats, three donkeys, and a lamb). He also produced some 50 drawings on the manufacture and uses of fireworks, a Book for the Study of Drawing (1641— 49), designed as a visual aid for drafts men, and printed rebuses intended to be fixed to hand-held fans.
