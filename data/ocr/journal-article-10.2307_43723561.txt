Pp. viii + 175. DM 67. This monograph about a stela found at Bethsaida is notable for several reasons: the interval between the discovery of the artifact and its publication was only a matter of months, the research ranges widely and is virtually exhaustive, the presentation (which includes 121 well-chosen plates) is clear and persuasive, and the relevance to OT interpretation is made abundantly clear.</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 325 A team from the University of Nebraska set out to excavate what seemed a purely Hellenistic-Roman site on the north side of the Sea of Galilee, but in 1991 they reached a level of Iron II (ca. 1000-600 b.c.), and in June 1997, in a stratum datable to the eighth century b.c., they uncovered immediately outside the city gate a meter- high podium with two steps leading up to it, and with a stone basin set into it. Within the basin were the pieces of a typical Iron II incense cup. On or near the podium were three aniconic stelae and one iconic or sculptured stela. The sculptured stela, made of dark basalt, is roughly four feet high, two feet wide, and one foot thick. It is generally rectangular but is rounded at the top. Set within a band framing the obverse composition is a figure which looks like a bull standing on its hind legs, facing whoever looks at the stela. The structure is simple: an upright post forming the animaTs torso and tail (phallus? throne?), two upside-down Us crossing the post to form what seem to be pairs of legs, and a head with horns atop the whole. At the center of the post (the "waist") is a sword in a scabbard, and to the right, beneath the front "leg," is a four-lobed rosette. The first commentators, looking southward into Israel-Palestine for parallels, found little that was helpful, but the present authors point out that in the Iron Age Bethsaida (et-Tell) was rather within the cultural domain of Aramaic Syria to the north. A somewhat smaller stela from the Hauran exhibits virtually the same iconog- raphy with two additions: trilobal ornaments hanging from the bull's ears, and a disk divided by lines into eight wedges between the bull's horns. On this stela from the Hauran are a sword at the waist and a four-lobed rosette to the right, as on the Bethsaida stela. Another stela, also from the Hauran, has the eight-wedged disk between the horns but lacks the ear pendants. A more stylized stela was found near Gaziantep in Turkey. Because the style of these monuments seemed peripheral, some- what akin to that of Palmyra or of Nabataean sites, previous commentators dated them to the Greco-Roman period, but close parallels now support the earlier date. The anthropomorphic upright bull figure has been found not only on these larger objects but also on a large number of seals, a few small stelae, a bronze box, and still other small objects. Many of these are datable with certainty to the eighth century, b.c. Fragments of the depiction (e.g., the central vertical post, some indication of horns or legs, the rosette, and the ear pendants) appear for the next several centuries in other contexts. Sometimes there is a conflation of the horns with the lunar crescent. In the comparative material, especially from Mesopotamia and Syria, all of these elements - the bullhead, the rosette, the sword - are associated with the moon god, specifically Sin. In addition, there is ample evidence of cultic arrangements at city gates in the Levant of the Iron Age. Tel Dan, with its several cultic installations of Iron II, is a striking example. Do 2 Kgs 23:8 (unemended) and Ezek 8:3-5 refer to such a place of worship, private or official? In the first passage cultic sites ( bāmot ) at the entrance to the city gates are clearly mentioned, and Ezekiel, in his famous catalog of abominations, mentions an uimage of jealousy" at the entrance of the gateway of the temple's inner court that faces north. It is possible that the author of Psalm 121 had such cultic installations in mind, especially if they were intended to assure good fortune and</page><page sequence="3">326 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY I 61, 1999 protection.
