Price DM 74 The release of this handsome volume makes avail- able to anthropologists the first instalment of important information on the Tacana tribe in Northwestern Bolivia, gathered in the years 1952-54 by Dr. Karin Hissink and Albert Hahn under the auspices of the Frobenius Institute. Research work among the Tacana centred mainly on the settlements of Ixiamas, Tumupasa and San Jose de Uchupiamonas in the province of Iturralde between the Rio Madre de Dios and the Rio Beni. In reviewing the collected material the authors maintain that, notwithstanding the infiltration of foreign elements after the Conquista, it may be said that on the whole the old Tacana traditions have survived to this day. Never- theless, as a result of missionary activities, Christian legends have become a part of Tacana folklore. Themes involved are the flood and the creation of the earth, and legends of God, Christ and the Virgin Mary. These have been accepted but with evident Tacana elements. Besides, there are stories of undoubted Tacana origin into which Christian elements have been introduced. Living in their tropical forests, hunting and collecting have for centuries been the main occupations of the Tacana. Quite naturally, legends concerning the principal animals in the bush and the indis- pensable wild plants have played an important part in the life of the Tacana. Animals are seen in their relations to one another and to man and the cosmos. Animals and plants are thought of as being in the custody of anthropomorphic spirits, such as Deavoavai, Chibute and Einidu. Deavoavai and Chibute are being regarded as the Culture heroes of the Tacana and are said to be the creators of the world. The group of legends around Deavoavai and Chibute is one of the oldest, dating from a period of most intensive hunting. Hence the importance of these spirits. Far less old is the group of legends connected with the Edutzi and the cultivation of plants. The Edutzi are considered to be the assistants of Caquiahuaca, the Supreme Go&amp;Creator, and are thought of as appearing in different shapes, such as that of man or bird. In many legends the Edutzi are figuring as the personification of natural phenomena, for instance the lightning or the thunder- storm. The abundant Tacana material to hand might induce Dr. Karin Hissink, who was the scientific leader of the expedition, to start an extensive comparative study, which might ultimately result in establishing important connexions between the traditions of the Tacana and those of peoples in surrounding countries. All students of South American culture-history will surely benefit from reading this first volume on the Tacana. There is a very short summary in Spanish (3 pages) and an equally short one in English. The full-page drawings by that well-known artist Albert Hahn are said to have been intentionally chosen to give the reader a clear impression of the distinctive features of those men and women who are in some way connected with the activities of the expedition. Fieldwork among the Tacana was made possible by grants from the German Government, the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft and the Wenner-Gren Foundation. J. VICTOR JANSEN</page></plain_text>
