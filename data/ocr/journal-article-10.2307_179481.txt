The identification of the Sapes provides little difficulty. All the records testify that they were not a single tribe, but rather a loose community sharing a common culture. It comprised the Bulloms, Temnes, Limbas, Bagas, Nalus and an ethnic group variously known as the Cocolis, Landu- mas or Tyapis. One Portuguese observer drew a meaningful parallel when he commented that 'all these nations are called in general "Sapes", in the same way that in Spain several nations are called "Spaniards" '. Cultural homogeneity among the Sapes was particularly noticeable with respect to language, dress, social structure and systems of justice. By the beginning of the sixteenth century all the inhabitants between Cape Verga and Cape Mount could speak either Temne or Bullom, and apparently no Sape had difficulty in communicating with any other Sape. One strong bond was provided by the fact that they shared the institution of the 'secret society'. Equally important, however, was their lack of political integration. The Sapes in no sense constituted a unitary state, and this was of crucial importance when they faced the Mane invaders. In spite of a lengthy historiography, there is little agreement on the origins of the Manes or on the date of their arrival on the Upper Guinea Coast. In 1884 the botanist Conde de Ficalho, in the context of the spread of food crops, considered it possible that there may have been a region of instability north of the Congo from which peoples dispersed in various directions, the Manes being one of the breakaway groups.2 Some years later Captain Avelot, in a discussion concerned primarily with Bantu Africa, equated the Manes with the Temnes, and suggested that the invaders must have arrived in Sierra Leone around I55o.3 In 1919 the anthropologist Northcote Thomas, addressing himself specifically to the question 'Who were the Manes?', dismissed the identification of Manes with Temnes, and also advanced the theory that the Mane migration took 1 Andre Dornelas: 'Relaao sobre a Serra Leoa', 1625; MS. 5I-VIII-25 of the Biblioteca de Ajuda, Lisboa. 2 Conde de Ficalho, Plantas Uteis de Africa Portuguesa (Lisboa, I884). 3 R.

But the hesitancy and errors of modern scholarship on the subject are also products of the failure to utilize the extant documentation with due care.7 By remedying this, and with the help of material which has recently come to the attention of researchers, it is possible to re- construct an important facet of the history of the Upper Guinea Coast. The earliest contemporary European observer of the Mane invasions who has gone on record was John Hawkins. The people whom he called the 'Sumboses' had arrived on the River Sherbro in i561, according to Hawkins, but he did not throw any light on the problem of their origins.8 The next source which can be consulted is the work of Alvares de Almada. Christopher Fyfe, in a short contribution to the discussion of this issue, wrote that 'Alvares d'Almada's book was published in i594, thirty years after the events took place. His account is confusing and full of inconsistencies: some passages it is hard to make sense of'.9 While it is true that his book was written in 1594, it is more apposite to point out that De Almada, a Cape Verde mulatto, had been an eye-witness to events on the Upper Guinea Coast since the i560s, and in I580 he was sent to Lisbon to advise the Portuguese crown on the colonization of Sierra Leone.10 Apparently, he had begun the systematic collection of information about the 'Rivers of Guinea' to aid in the mission. In the prologue of his book, De Almada expressed himself as follows: 'I wish to write something about the Rivers of Guinea and Cape Verde... because I have seen the greater part of it, and traded on many rivers, proceeding many leagues inland, and above all I have taken great pains to resolve doubtful issues, by consulting both our men (the local Portuguese) and the Negroes themselves.'l Neither this statement nor De Almada's un- deniable accuracy in other contexts absolves his pronouncements on the Manes from critical assessment, but his awareness of the need to clear up 4 N.

De Almada gathered from the old Sapes that the Manes had been coming for hundreds of years to make war. This statement probably 10 6 14 12 10 8 Fig. I.

Scale : 4,000,000. reflects the fact that Sierra Leone had received attacks and migratory currents from that direction for a very long time, although the specific wave of invasion which brought the Manes was dated about the middle of the sixteenth century. De Almada advanced his own conjecture that the Manes were a Mande people, giving detailed reasons for his opinion. Drawing upon his knowledge of the Mandingas and the Mande empire, which, he affirmed, lay in a vast belt above all the coastal peoples, he noted that the Manes spoke the same or nearly the same language as the Mande 221</page><page sequence="4">he had encountered trading on the Upper Gambia, and they had exactly the same arms and clothing. The Manes carried small bows and arrows, which they claimed were useless to their enemies, while the small Mane bow could discharge the large arrows of their opponents. The rest of their arms consisted of large shields made of reeds, large enough to give complete cover to the user, two knives, one of which was tied to the left arm, and two quivers for their arrows. Their clothes consisted of loose cotton shirts with wide necks and ample sleeves reaching down to the knees to become tights. One striking feature about their appearance was the abundance of feathers stuck in their shirts and their red caps.12 The full significance of this description can be gained by comparing it with a description given earlier by De Almada, when he was dealing with the Mande trading caravans which arrived on the Gambia. All the members of the trading party spoke the Mande language, and the majority were dressed exactly like the Mandingas, in short breeches which did not reach their knees; but the guards on the caravan, which sometimes numbered I,ooo and more, were dressed rather differently. They wore the same type of trousers as the Manes; they carried the same weapons, giving the same explanation about the efficiency of their enemies' arrows on their bows and vice versa; and they had the same profusion of feathers about their person.13 It is clearly these people with whom De Almada equated the Manes. The caravans arriving at the Gambia were supposed to have made their way along a highway which passed above the nations of Guinea. De Almada elicited from the traders that the copper which they purchased would be sold to non-Islamicized peoples (cafres), and, though it is perhaps a co- incidence that he added at this point that the emperor of Mandimanfa, under whose orders the caravans travelled, was known as the Great Elephant by the Africans near Mina, it is feasible that the six-month journey of these Mande traders originated in the hinterland of the Gold Coast. At the beginning of the sixteenth century Pacheco Pereira had described the Mande trade on the Upper Gambia, stating that the gold which they brought came from a country called 'Toom', which was some zoo leagues away from the Mandinga kingdom.14 Delafosse identified 'Toom' with Ashanti, which the Mandingas call 'Ton', and this agrees roughly with Pacheco Pereira's estimated distance.15 Assuming that the caravan guards were the same people as the Manes, then this provides the first slim clue that the Manes were a southern Mande people who may have lived in the hinterland of the Ivory or Gold Coasts. Christopher Fyfe cited as an example of De Almada's confusion and inconsistency the fact that 'he conjectured that the invaders came from 12 Ibid. 360, 361. 13 Ibid. 279. 14 Pacheo Pereira, Esmeraldo de Situ Orbis, ed. R. Mauny, 64. 15 Ibid., editor's note 130. 222 WALTER RODNEY</page><page sequence="5">A RECONSIDERATION OF THE MANE INVASIONS an inland realm, Mandimansa-but also suggested elsewhere that they came from further down the Coast'. Since the Mande world stretched across parts of the modern Ivory Coast and Ghana, there is no reason why De Almada's statements that the Manes came from Mande country and that they reached Sierra Leone via the Malaguetta Coast should be regarded as inconsistent.16 De Almada for once seems to have relinquished his judiciousness when he asserted that the Manes reached Sierra Leone after passing across the Congo. This idea enjoyed great currency in Sierra Leone, nor did it deter the counter-assertion that the Jagas of Angola came from Sierra Leone. Even those who are familar with the great Bantu migrations would marvel at the fact that the Bagas of the Pongo were supposed to have dispatched a regiment to Benguela in Angola.17 But not only the sources are to be blamed. Peter Kup cited the Jesuit, Barreira, as follows: 'These people are called Jacas in the Congo, in Angola Grindas... and here they called them Cumbas, a nick-name for Manes.' Taking this statement literally, he went on to date the arrival of the Manes in Sierra Leone by events in the Congo.18 If he had taken due note of the complete passage, which reads 'These people are called in the Congo Jacas, in Angola Gindas, in India Zimbas, and in the Ethiopia of Prester John Galas',19 he would at least have harboured some slight doubt of the physical possibility of one and the same people appearing simultaneously in such widely dispersed parts of the continent as Ethiopia, Angola, Sierra Leone and Mo9ambique. The apparent link with these diverse regions seems to lie not so much in the Manes themselves as in their cohorts, the Sumbas. Most of the early writers on the subject distinguished between the Manes proper and the forces which they drafted into their army on their way to Sierra Leone. Those forces were said to be cannibals, the word 'Sumba' meaning precisely 'an eater of human flesh', and it was applied firstly to the anthropophagi and more generally to the whole attacking force.20 Since the Jagas of Angola and the Zimbas of Mozambique were both said to be anthropophagi, it must be the simultaneous appearance of the same phenomenon which led Portuguese observers to make the identification. It is noteworthy, for example, that Father Barreira, who was the chief exponent of this view, was himself in the Congo for a period of fourteen years before he started his missionary activity in Sierra Leone,21 and he would have been very familiar with the Jagas, who were at one time employed by the Portuguese as auxiliaries. A far more coherent account than Barreira's was that of Andre Dornelas, whose work has recently been rediscovered. Like De Almada, Dornelas 16 Christopher Fyfe, op. cit. 43. 17 F. W.

It was only in 1625, after he had retired to Santiago, that Dornelas decided to record his fifty years of experience on the Upper Guinea Coast. His father, also a Cape Verde trader, purchased three Manes in Sierra Leone in I560, naming them Belthior, Baltezar and Gaspar; and from these Andre Dornelas had obtained information even before he first visited Sierra Leone in 1574. Dornelas was an eye-witness not so much to the struggles between the Sapes and the Manes as to the internecine fighting between the Manes themselves, since by the time of his arrival the conquest of the Sapes had been effected and the early history of the Manes was receding into the background, guarded only by a few elders. 'The origin of the Manes is reported by their elders as tradition handed down from their grandparents, and what they say is that...' Such is the auspicious beginning of Dornelas's account of the origins of the Manes. In essentials, the tradition stated that the original chief of the Manes was a leading lady in Mandimansa, Macarico by name, who offended the emperor and had to leave the city. She took with her large numbers of friends, relatives and dependants, who were transformed into a conquering army. This army overran vast territories and many nations, and its ranks were swelled with recruits to such an extent that for sustenance it was necessary to eat some of the defeated peoples. When she reached the Atlantic, Macarico divided the army into three parts: one of these marched along the sea coast, a second proceeded parallel to the first, some forty-five miles away, while the third was equidistant on the right flank. Each section comprised a vanguard, a rearguard, and the main force in the middle, and in this order they marched slowly until they reached the Portuguese fortress of Mina. The Manes engaged in a few skirmishes with the Portuguese at the fortress, but they were discouraged by the artillery and thought better of tarrying there. Instead, they regrouped, creating a fourth army and sending it eastwards while the bulk of the forces continued westwards along the Malaguetta Coast. In the vicinity of Cape Mount they had a serious battle against the Bulloms, in which Macarico's son was killed, and she herself died shortly afterwards from grief and old age. The date was then I545, and it was forty years since Macarico had set out from Mali. It took another fifteen years before the conquest of the Sapes was effected. The tradition, as recorded by Dornelas, finds support on several details. Both De Almada and Manuel Alvares were informed that the original leader of the Mane forces was a woman, whom Alvares referred to as 'Mabete'-'Queen of Guinea'. Their reports also agree that Macarico died just before reaching Sierra Leone.22 With regard to the identification 22 De Almada, 'Rios de Guin6', 361, 366. (He had heard that the original leader was a woman, but his account is that the general of the army was called Macarico and it was his sister who was grief-striken at his death.)

Two members of the crew of a Portuguese ship which was wrecked off the Malaguetta Coast confirmed the direction of the invasion. One of these seamen, Paulo Palha, was black, while the other, Francisco Vaz of the Portuguese province of the Alentejo, was white. These two served the Manes in the capacity of soldiers until they reached Sierra Leone.24 While there is no indication as to exactly where the shipwrecked sailors joined the Manes, one gathers from the activities of Hawkins that the Manes were at least as far south along the coast as the river Cess, since a Mane king, fighting in Sierra Leone, was able to promise Hawkins that if he sailed down the coast to the river Cess he would be provided with slaves.25 As the traditional account, drawn up by Dornelas and supplemented by the writings of other Portuguese contemporaries, moves into Sierra Leone itself, it becomes clearer and more precise. The Manes advanced slowly northwards across the Sherbro, Rockelle, Port Loko and Scarcies, casting their dominion over most of the Sapes. When the Manes appeared before a given village, they would send an embassy bearing cloth and arms. To accept was to recognize Mane suzerainty; to reject was not only to risk defeat in battle, but there was the further threat that failure to submit would mean for the recalcitrants that their final resting place would be the stomachs of the Sumbas.26 As it was, the reputation of the Sumbas, enhanced by rumour, was enough to spread terror and a disinclination to resist. It was in this context that the political weakness of the Sape confederacy was most obvious. Before a disciplined military force, the Sapes could only present a spectacle of political disunity and indecision. The principle of action seemed to be that one should fight only when it was absolutely necessary; namely when one's turn came, and the Manes were exactly on the doorstep. So each tribe, each village, submitted or fought its own battle, as it thought fit.27 In the purely military sphere, the Manes suffered reverses in two ways. Firstly, they had little success against the Limbas and Djalonkes, who adopted the policy of burning their own homes and retiring to underground caves. From these they sallied forth to conduct a species of deadly guerrilla warfare.28 Secondly, the attempt to subjugate the Susus backfired. When the usual Mane arms were sent to the Susus, the latter returned them saying that those arms were no different from theirs. The Susus expressed a willingness to establish peaceful relations with the Manes, on the terms 23 Guerreiro, Relafao Anual, III, 255. 24 De Almada, 'Rios de Guin6', 361. 25 Cited in Kup, op. cit. 129. 26 De Almada, 'Rios de Guine', 362. 27 Ibid. 362. 28 Ibid. 363. 225</page><page sequence="8">of equity and mutual benefit which they had previously maintained with the Sapes, but the Manes would not be dissuaded from the attempted conquest. The decisive encounter between the Manes and the Susus was long after spoken of with awe by the people of Sierra Leone. The Mane army was the largest ever assembled in those parts, comprising mainly Bulloms and Temnes in the service of their new masters. The Susus, too, boasted large numbers, their ranks being buttressed by Fula allies who contributed seven horses, a novelty in Sierra Leone. The story goes that the Susus prepared large supplies of poisoned food and fell back in apparent disorder. The ruse worked, because the Manes partook of the food with resultant mortality. At this juncture the Manes, contrary to their usual practice, decided to go on the defensive, and entrenched themselves. The Susus took the initiative, and, led by the Fula horsemen, they stormed the Mane position so furiously and gained entrance so quickly that Salvador da Costa, a Portuguese who had been enlisted by the Manes because of his skill as a musketeer, was unable to reload after firing his first round. The Mane forces fled in disorder, but the Susus were familar with the terrain because of their earlier intercourse with the Sapes, so they pursued the fleeing Mane forces and decimated large numbers.29 The dating of the military conquest can be ascertained with exactitude. Barreira, writing in I607, said that the Manes had arrived about sixty years previously,30 and De Almada says that the invasion began around I550.31 On the latter's evidence, Yves Person was able to date the arrival of the Manes between I540 and I550.32 This is confirmed by Dornelas, who stated categorically that the subjugation of the Sapes was effected in the fifteen years between I545 and I560. Quite unintentionally, Dornelas substantiated his claim that the Mane conquest was over by I560, by pointing out that the original Sape kings had borne the title 'Beca'. Two of the Sape kings, who had escaped on Portuguese ships to Cape Verde and later Cacheu, were known as Beca Caja and Beca Boure. But this title had completely disappeared in Sierra Leone during the i56os and i570s, and instead the participants in various struggles bore titles such as 'Farma' and 'Shere'. 'Farma' was obviously a Mande word, while 'Shere' (or 'Sere') is an alternative for 'Kamara', traditionally the earliest Mande clan in the Western Sudan.33 Thus, Avelot's view that I550 was the date of the Mane invasion is much closer to the truth than that of Northcote Thomas, who had established his chronology by accrediting the evidence of Valentim Fer- nandes (I506) to Pedro da Sintra (I462). Peter Kup fixed the beginning of the Mane invasion in the early I560s, at a time when the conquest of the Sapes was already over. He cited the 29 Ibid. 369-73. 30 Guerreiro, Relafao Anual, vol.

Where Kup is right is in pointing out that new forces were advancing from the Malaguetta Coast. De Almada stated that, when one set of Mane rulers of Sierra Leone forgot their obligations to pay tribute to the kings and captains who remained behind, a new invasion was launched against the defectors.35 The Mane generals and captains, on the basis of a clan system, had apportioned Sierra Leone among themselves, and proclaimed themselves 'kings'.36 There were four principal kingdoms: first, the kingdom of the Bulloms, which extended from Tagrin Point northwards, and included the Idolos islands; secondly, the kingdom of Logos or Mitombo, centred about Port Loko; thirdly, the kingdom of Sierra Leone or Boure, which stretched south from the Sierra Leone channel until it came up against the fourth kingdom, that of Sherbro.37 Within each of these kingdoms there were subdivisions, whose rulers sometimes wielded great power, as in the case of Tora, who commanded only the islands of the Sierra Leone channel but who by I605 was the eldest survivor of the Manes. This gave him the status and authority of a king,38 though he was subject to Fatima, the king of the northern Bulloms.39 Strictly speaking, a number of the petty rulers called 'kings' by the Europeans should really be regarded as 'chiefs'. It was a pyramidical structure of government: the chiefs owed allegiance to the local kings, who themselves supposedly paid deference to the kings of the 'metropolis' at Cape Mount,40 who in turn paid tribute to an overlord who remained behind. What is needed to clarify the issue is information as to what transpired in the adjacent region that is now Liberia. No first-hand sixteenth-century accounts seem to be available for the Malaguetta Coast, but information has survived in late-seventeenth-century compilations by Barbot, Dapper and Ogilby.41 Their work was mainly based on the observations of Dutch traders resident at Cape Mount at the beginning of the seventeenth century, and, indeed, those traders, like Dornelas, must have recorded 34 Kup, op. cit.

Barbot repeated old lore which seems questionable, along with new information which appears to be highly credible. Of the Manes, he wrote: 'The Portuguese at Congo and Angola reckon these to be of the same race as the barbarous Jagos and Galas... and all of them generally supposed to proceed from the nations of the Galas Monou, living far up the inland of the river Sestro.' The Monou or Manoe were responsible for the conquest of the Malaguetta Coast, and all authority was held by the emperor of Monou, to whom tribute had to be paid.43 The Monou, though a small group, succeeded in imposing their will on far more numerous tribes, by using different ethnic groups at different times as their agents. The three groups mentioned in the seventeenth- century sources are the Quojas, the Karos (Krus) and the Folgias. The Folgias, apparently a Mande people, attacked the Krus, who lived in the hinterland of the river Junk. Flansire, the king of the Folgias, desired reconciliation after defeating the Krus, so he married the sister of Floni- kerri, king of the Krus, and appointed Flonikerri as his general in a battle against the king of the river Cess. Flonikerri distinguished himself in this and other battles and as a reward he was allowed to attempt the conquest of Cape Mount. The Cape Mount region was at that time inhabited by the Vais and the Quojas. The Vais in particular fought bitterly against the Kru armies, which represented the interests of the Folgias and the Monou, but, after a series of struggles, the conquest was carried to completion by Zyllymanque, the brother of Flonikerri. After the kingdom of Cape Mount had been won, the conquest of Sierra Leone was said to have been undertaken by 'the young monarch Flansire', possibly not the original Flansire of the Folgias, but a successor. The country was divided up among his generals. The area around the Sierra Leone channel went to Kandaqualle, the Sherbro was granted to Selboele, while the Gallinas (Moa) was ruled by Sytre-all viceroys of the Krus and Folgias, and thus ultimately subjects of the Manimassa, emperor of Monou. But this arrangement was challenged by one Falma, who expelled Kandaqualle from his government. Flansire proceeded down the Moa and up along the coast, crossing to the Bananas to take under his protection those of his subjects who had fled there from Falma. With the aid of some Europeans, Flansire besieged Falma in a village to which he had retired, cutting through the palisades and the double row of trees which surrounded it, and setting the place afire. Falma escaped with great difficulty, and Kandaqualle was re-established. In the meanwhile, the 42 Ogilby's work is virtually a translation of Dapper's. Barbot and Ogilby are the two sources which will be utilized here. 43 Barbot, Description of the Coasts of North and South Guinea, 96. 228 WALTER RODNEY</page><page sequence="11">A RECONSIDERATION OF THE MANE INVASIONS viceroys of Sherbro and Gallinas had conspired with Gammina, Flansire's brother, to usurp the kingdom of Cape Mount. Hastening to return south, Flansire fought and defeated his brother at the river Moa.44 It is obviously necessary that the account of the events viewed from the Malaguetta Coast should be complemented and correlated with the account of events viewed from Sierra Leone. In the first place, it is to be observed that the identification of the Manes with the Monou in no way contradicts the substance of earlier Portuguese assertions. Indeed, it accords well with the Portuguese claims that only the vanguard of the attacking forces had reached Sierra Leone, and that tribute was owing to an overlord, who remained behind. The name 'Manow' still exists as that of a small Mande group in the hinterland of Liberia. On the other hand, there is again a definite gap between the river Cess and the fortress of Mina, so that that aspect of the Portuguese reports remains unconfirmed. The second major issue relates to those peoples who had a great part to play as agents of the Manes in the conquest of Sierra Leone. It has been suggested that the cohorts of the Manes were drawn from around Zaria and other parts of the Western Sudan, from cannibal tribes known to the Arabs as 'Dem Dem'.45 However, if the Manes are to be identified with the Monou of Liberia in the first instance, then one must seek the Sumbas along the Malaguetta Coast, en route to Sierra Leone, concentrating in particular on the Quojas and the Krus. When the Krus appear in the literature of Sierra Leone, it was because of their skill as sailors, which earned them frequent mention in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. No writer on Sierra Leone or the Malaguetta Coast in the sixteenth or early seventeenth century appears to have heard of the tribe under that name. But, even today, the Krus are considered as a heterogeneous group comprising, among others, the Quojas and the Queas.46 The latter also played a prominent role in the Mane conquest of Sierra Leone, assuming leadership in the kingdom of Boure, according to Manuel Alvares. The 'Queis', as he calls them, were closely associated with the Cubales. This latter name seems to have disappeared, but in the early sixteenth century it was given to the inhabitants of the area on the coast between the Gallinas and Cape Mount.47 Groups such as the Queas, Quojas and Cobales were clearly not tribes in their own right. Indeed, the probability is that they were all Vai-speakers. The list of supposedly Quoja words provided by Dapper has been shown to be a Vai vocabulary.48 The important point is that the Mane forces contained a high percentage of coastal peoples immediately to the south and west of the Sherbro. European reports are vaguest when they refer to peoples who were not 44 John Ogilby, Africa (London, 1670), 407-I2. 45 Kup, op. cit. I39. 46 Ibid.

Mention was made of the 'Galas' as a group in the hinterland west of the Monou. They descended to the coast to play a role in the struggle of the Krus and the Quojas. From their location, the 'Galas' were likely to have been a group of Kpelle or Toma. Because the elite who gave leadership to the Mane invasions had their home in the interior, they too were given inadequate treatment in the records of the Europeans on the coast. They were referred to as Mendi-Ko, temptingly inviting an identification with the Mende of today. Reservations have been expressed concerning such a conclusion based on the limited and sometimes confused testimony of Dapper;49 but the Mende are the only tribe who at present inhabit Sierra Leone and Liberia who were given no mention whatever in the sixteenth century, implying arrival after that date, and their location in the late eighteenth century corresponded with the general direction suggested by the Dutch sources. On linguistic grounds, Northcote Thomas linked the Mende with the Gbande and Toma; and he suggested that 'in the Mende we have the portion of the Manes who drove out the aborigines or completely dominated them; in the Loko, a tribe originally of the aboriginal stock but brought so completely under the influence of the Manes as to adopt their language instead of their own; and that the Temnes are also aborigines who were forced to take alien chiefs, but maintained in large measure their own culture, and in places won back from the invaders a portion of the territory the latter had subjugated'.50 Apart from inaccurately ascribing these events to the late fifteenth or early sixteenth century, Thomas made a convincing assessment of the Manes, which is largely corroborated by the recent researches of Yves Person. The latter, however, went much farther afield in attempting to trace the origins of the Manes, and reconstructed their travels from the oral traditions of the Kamara or Dyomande. The Kamara had begun their descent from the Niger to the sea in the hinterland of Sierra Leone, making their first halt at Kourousa. From there they moved south-east into the Konian, and then down to the Liberian coast. The expansion from the Konian (the region around Beyla) involved an attack on Sierra Leone in the middle of the sixteenth century, with the Kamara aristocracy leading Mande-Fou elements, such as the Gbande and Toma, in a westerly direction.51 The prevalence among the Mane ruling class of the name 'Shere' or 'Sere', which, as mentioned before, is an alternative to 'Kamara', leaves little doubt that this identification is correct. Serious doubt attaches to Person's conclusions, however, on the issue of the 'Kru-Quoja invasion', which he separates from the earlier Mane or Sumba invasion, and places in the third decade of the seventeenth century. This date is established from the fact that the Kamara traditions 49 P. E. H.

Person partially established the date of his second Mane invasion by calculations which assumed that certain key personalities were alive when Dapper was writing in the late I66os; and Kup very clearly arrived at his chronology by dating certain events from 1670, when Ogilby put his compilation together. Thus, Kup says of Flamburre: 'By i670, christened Philip by the Portuguese missionaries, he had settled his four brothers as rulers along the river Sierra Leone.'54 In reality, Ogilby (and Dapper, whom Ogilby translates) is at this point relying on the reports of the Jesuit, Father Baltezar Barreira, as collected by Fernao Guerreiro and translated into French by Jarric. The Flamboere of Jarric and Ogilby, who was Flansire's eldest son, and who was christened Philip by the Portuguese missionaries, was Fattema Boure, who was baptized D. Filipe by Barreira in i6o7.55 Ogilby is quite explicit on this point. He mentions that the supreme king of Sierra Leone was a Quoia, who had 'left his old title Flamboere, and from the Portugals, by whom converted to Christianity, received the name of Don Philip... The people, before the coming of the Jesuit Barreira, lay wholly drencht in idolatry, but he converted many to the Christian faith; and in the year sixteen hundred and seven baptized the king, his children, and many others, giving to the king at his baptism the name of Philip, as we said before, to which the Portugals flatteringly added Don, and because he was king of Serre-Lions, called him Don Philip the Lyon.'56 Such an understanding of Ogilby leaves unaltered the sixteenth-century chronology which can be built up from Portuguese sources. Ogilby does indeed mention a number of Mane kings who were alive in 1670, but they were all born in Sierra Leone. No further invasions had occurred since Dornelas wrote-to the best knowledge of later seventeenth-century writers. The years 1620-30 in the history of Sierra Leone are by no means well documented,57 but there were Capuchin missionaries in Sierra Leone about the middle of the century who never hinted at an invasion only twenty years ealier, while the Jesuits had been informed of the first Mane arrivals fifty to sixty years previously. Besides, there is one detailed 52 The second article cited above slightly modifies the first, one particular being that the date of the second invasion is shifted from I6oo-io to I620-30. 53 Kup, A History of Sierra Leone, I44-8. 54 Ibid.

This was a description of the Upper Guinea Coast by Lemos Coelho, a Guinea-born trader who had visited Sierra Leone regularly between 1646 and 1658. He, too, referred to the Mane invasions as something long past--'ninety years ago' was his estimate. Coelho was very unlikely to have overlooked new developments of magni- tude in the decade I620-30. Not only did he gather information from Afro-Portuguese traders who were born in Sierra Leone, but he was personally acquainted with a Mane ruler named Sherabola, who resided on Sherbro Island. Coelho knew him as a very old man, reputedly more than i oo years old, and understandably so, because Captain Fenton had met him fighting there in i584.58 It is almost certain that Sherabola is the same 'Selboele' of Barbot and Ogilby who was said to have given his name to the Sherbro, because the same claim is advanced for Sherabola.59 A further inquiry into the way that certain source materials were generated, though seemingly pedantic, is essential to establish clearly that the Mane or Sumba or 'Kru-Quoja' invasions all occurred in one spate in about twenty years after 1545. Once Ogilby moved south of the Sherbro, his sources changed. He could no longer use Jarric, since the Jesuits did not know the area south of the Sherbro. He then utilized records provided by Dutch traders. Possibly, these were acquired at the very beginning of the seventeenth century, when the Dutch had a fort at Cape Mount;60 possibly, they were acquired later; but they certainly were not eye-witness accounts of sixteenth-century events. The Dutch traders, therefore, when they gave a chronicle beginning in the first half of the sixteenth century and stretching across several reigns, were, like Dornelas, recording African tradition. Treating their material as traditional history, one can seek to establish a link with a precisely datable occurrence, involving the Euro- peans on the coast. It will be recalled that Flansire had subdued the region between the Sierra Leone estuary and the Gallinas, leaving Kandaqualle as viceroy of the provinces of Sierra Leone. That arrangement was disturbed by an attack by Falma on Kandaqualle, forcing Flansire to return to Sierra Leone to re-establish the latter. Flansire sought the aid of the Europeans to besiege Falma in a heavily fortified town, which was eventually taken, though Falma himself escaped. None of the names were the same, but the struggle between Sasena and Shere in 1567-8, in which John Hawkins played a part, fits the circumstances in all essentials, if for Sasena one reads Falma and for Shere one reads Kandaqualle. Hawkins calls Shere 'king of Sierra Leone', and he was asked by 58 Hakluyt Society, 2nd. ser., no. cxIII, The Troublesome Voyage of Captain Edward Fenton. 59 Lemos Coelho, Duas Descrifoes da Guine, ed.

Hawkins lent his assistance to Shere in January 1568, on condition that 'as many negroes as by these wars might be obtained, as well of his part, as of ours, should be at our pleasure'. After considerable casualties, including several of the I20 men whom Hawkins had contributed, the town was eventually taken, though Sasena escaped-as Falma is said to have escaped. Hawkins ends his account by castigating Shere for not handing over those captives which the latter had taken, and the English ships sailed away with the 250 that they themselves had seized.62 According to the narrative of another crew member, Hawkins was told by his former allies, as the latter departed, that he should send to the Cess and captives would be made ready for him.63 Again, there is an exact correspondence between the Hawkins episode and the tradition. Shere was helped to re-establish his authority in Sierra Leone in precisely the same manner as Kandaqualle had been: namely by troops moved up from the Malaguetta Coast. Furthermore, the traditions (via Dapper and others) relate that Flansire returned to the Cess to discipline other dissidents, so that he would have been in a position to make a promise to Hawkins to provide further captives from that area. Years later, De Almada recalled the incident of the siege of Bonga, pointing out that some Portuguese had fought on the side of Sasena,64 a fact to which Job Hartop, a member of Hawkins's crew, had drawn attention.65 There is no recorded incident even vaguely resembling this one, and direct European intervention of this sort was unlikely to have passed unnoticed. Given that it was Kandaqualle whom Hawkins had helped to place once more in power, then the 'Kru-Quoja invasion' must have taken place prior to 1568. The two Jesuit missionaries, Baltezar Barreira and Manuel Alvares, both testified to the presence of the Quojas (Coyas) in Sierra Leone, during their stay on that part of the coast between i606 and I6i6.66 The Quojas and Queas, who are part of the heterogeneous Kru people, must indeed 61 B.M., Cotton MS., Otho E viii, fo. 27 ff.

By i594 all the invaders were held to be naturaes ('locally born') and in many instances indistinguishable from the Sapes.67 By I616 nothing had intervened to change this. Alvares commented: 'It is difficult to speak of the Manes of Sierra Leone because of their assimilation into the life there. Such genuine Manes about whom one could speak are few and fast disappearing.' The authentic Manes who were still to be found were the Queas, Quojas and Cubales. These formed the elite which ruled the province of Sierra Leone and Boure. They claimed to have fought alongside the father of 'Filamanqua'; and, even allowing for the fact that similarity of names can be notorously misleading, this 'Filamanqua' seems to be the 'Zylly- manque' of Ogilby. Reverting again to the traditions contained in the European chronicles, one finds that the father of Zyllymanque was the Kru king who put up a desperate resistance to the Folgia invasion. He was succeeded by his son, Filonikerri, who in turn was succeeded by his brother, Zyllymanque. 'Flamanqua' was mentioned by Alvares in the context of the pedigree claims put forward by the Queas, who considered themselves superior to the Aperme, who were 'half-slave and half-free'-, the offspring on one side of conquered peoples. By inference, therefore, Filamanqua or Zyllymanque lived at least a generation earlier; and since he proceded Flansire, he would in fact have died before 1568, the date which is advanced here for the reconquest of Sierra Leone by Flansire. It is possible that personalities like Zyllymanque and Flansire go back well before I568-to the original invasion of Sierra Leone by the Manes in 1545. This would mean that the invasion of the Toma-Gbande directly westwards across the Bullom-Kissi hinterland to the Rokelle and Port Loko was contemporaneous with and part of the 'Kru-Quoja invasion'. After all, this is what the weight of evidence suggests: namely, parallel fronts approaching Sierra Leone along the coast and in the sertao. But, whether or not the Krus were part of the I545 invasion, their political control of Sierra Leone antedated the end of the sixteenth century by some forty years at least. It is necessary to stress once again that the forces that mattered numeri- cally as far as the Mane invasion of Sierra Leone was concerned came from close by. When the Manes fought the Susus, Limbas and Fulas (in what appears to have been the upper Scarcies region), they did so using primarily Bulloms and Temnes.68 Similarly, it is to be expected that, when they attacked the Bulloms and Kissis of the Sherbro and Gallinas, their main troops were drawn from the neighbouring Malaguetta Coast. The supposed cannibalism of some of the invading forces has 67 De Almada, 'Rios de Guine', 373. 68 De Almada, 'Rios de Guine', 373. 234 WALTER RODNEY</page><page sequence="17">A RECONSIDERATION OF THE MANE INVASIONS 235 provided a false trail, leading to the Dem Dem of Northern Nigeria.69 'Dem Dem' or 'Demdemeh' is a generic Arab term meaning 'cannibals', the existence and location of whom are extremely vague, and the whole idea is established mainly on rumour and myth.70 Both among the Sapes and the Europeans, the notoriety of the Sumbas probably far outstripped their performance. It was said that they would sometimes appear brandish- ing a human joint for effect-and the effect was terrifying.71 They were also said to have eaten of the flesh of their enemies 'for courage and ferocity', and for the psychological effect it would have on their future opponents-being deliberately encouraged by the Mane elite, although the latter themselves refrained from any such practice.72 These comments suggest more a ritual than a way of life. Whatever the origin of the various strands of the invasion, the importance of the overlying Mande influence must be recognized. It was said that all new soldiers who were enlisted were not only trained in the use of Mane arms but were also inculcated with a new sense of loyalty. The recruits were chosen as young men, who, after training and indoctrination, were said to have been puffed up with pride at being among the Mane ranks.73 The arms and clothing were clearly Mande, and the language, too, showed pronounced Mande characteristics, which today set the Mandes and the Lokos apart from the Temnes, Bulloms and Kissis. All of the Mande leaders of the Manes could have descended on to the Malaguetta Coast directly from the interior, along the routes suggested by Yves Person. Geography and verisimilitude are on the side of such an interpretation. Yet one must take some cognizance of the insistence of sixteenth- and seventeenth-century reports that the origins of the Manes can be traced as far away as the hinterland of the Gold Coast. As late as 1669, Lemos Coelho mentioned that the Manes had attacked the Portuguese fortress of Mina, after which they took ten years to reach Sierra Leone.74 In part, the Portuguese must have deduced from the information that they received that the Manes had attacked the fort of Sao Jorge de Mina, but, unless there was a deliberate invention on the part of the Portuguese traders and missionaries, the Mane traditions themselves mentioned contact with a European fort. Barreira elicited this information in person from Tora, a Mane king: 'He told me that they were ten years on the march, because of the wars which they waged wherever they passed, and he still remembered the castle of Mina, and the shots with which they were met.'75 On the whole stretch of coast between Sierra Leone and the Gold Coast there were no forts in the sixteenth century, so that, once the Manes did come into contact with a European fort, this suggests that they had 69 Kup, op. cit.

At any rate, there could have been among the Manes individuals who had arrived on the Malaguetta Coast after a circuitous journey from the hinterland of the Gold Coast, merging with those who descended to the Atlantic from the region around Beyla. This would not be contradicted by the general picture of population shifts on the Gold Coast and its hinterland during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.76 Above all, to construct a theory of the origins of the Manes without a single reference to evidence of this sort (if only to reject it) is a serious historiographical omission. Northcote Thomas was particularly judicious in his conclusions on this issue. Of Tora's evidence, he had this to say: 'We can hardly suppose that the chief was aware of the Portuguese name of the place; and it is unfortunate that his exact words are not available.' Then, having drawn attention to the possibility of the Manes having travelled from the Niger to Mina and then on to Sierra Leone, he added: 'I must not be understood to argue that the Manes actually came by this route, or by any other, from beyond the Niger; I am merely exploring possibilities. Certain data have to be accounted for.'77 In the final analysis, the most relevant aspects of the Mane invasions are not the origin of these people but their impact upon the situation in Sierra Leone itself. This aspect has already been touched on in the suggestion that the Mendes and the Lokos were products of the Mane invasions-a suggestion that seems well founded. Today the Mendes are one of the largest tribal groups in Sierra Leone. They are clearly the product of an intermixture on a Bullom base, and with an upper stratum showing distinct Mande traits. Anthropometric measurements of some 700 subjects suggested that there were among the Mendes both a Mande type and a type indigenous to the forest region.78 Certain cultural divergencies, such as the presence of both matrilineal and patrilineal patterns of inheritance, support the idea of cultural fusion. Mende tradition distinguishes between the earliest settlers and invaders who came from the north. The leaders of the invasions set themselves up as chiefs, but difficulties over boundaries brought them into constant conflict with each other, as well as with any of the original rulers who were able to withstand them.79 All this sounds remarkably similar to the comments of the Portuguese on the Mane invasions. It was only late in the eighteenth century that the Mendes were recorded as making attacks on the Sherbro Bulloms, and they are in fact relatively recent arrivals in the modern state of Sierra Leone as far as numbers and influence are concerned.80 In this situation one must draw a careful distinction between the arrival of the conquering forces and the formation 76 J.

The Manes overran all of the Sherbro Bulloms, but their greatest impact was made around the Gallinas and Cape Mount, and at some distance inland following the line of the Toma invasion. Here, therefore, the Mende 'tribe' can be said to have emerged, moving deeper into Sierra Leone proper during the eighteenth century. It can similarly be maintained that the Lokos were a product of the Mane invasions. Person argues that they stem from the section of the Toma-Gbande force which took an inland route across the hinterland of the Sherbro Bulloms. In reality, the Portuguese spoke not only of coastal movements but of roughly parallel fronts in the sertdo or hinterland.81 They also made it clear that the region around Port Loko (or Logos, as it was then called) was one of the most important centres of Mane power within Sierra Leone. Farma, the first Mane king of the area, was also addressed as 'Emperor of the Sapes', a title retained by his successors.82 As far as the Portuguese were concerned, Farma's subjects were Temnes, and today the Temnes retain traditions concerning their great king, Bai Farma, who came from the east.83 As would be expected if the Lokos were part of the Mane invasion, the Lokos and Mendes are regarded as being divisions of the same people,84 though the Lokos display marked Temne characteristics in their speech, setting it apart from 'pure' Mende. These characteristics are held to have been acquired when the Lokos traded with the Temnes,85 but it seems far more likely that the situation is to be explained by the fact that the Mendes represent the Mane fusion with the Bulloms and Kissis, while the Lokos represent the same Mane elements fused with Temne. Today, the Limbas still call the Lokos Gbande, while the Gbande themselves say that their brothers left them at an early date to fight a war in the west.86 The name 'Mane' itself fell rapidly into disuse, except in the Scarcies. By some curious chance it was this section of the invaders farthest removed from their origins on the Malaguetta Coast who were still being called Manes later in the seventeenth century, while to the south there was a reversion to the name 'Bullom'.87 The Mane or Mani people of the Sherbro are almost certainly products of these sixteenth-century occur- rences. While the creation of new tribal entities was essentially a long-term process, there were a number of ways in which the Manes made their presence felt immediately. The state-building Mande element was in a minority, but the forces were numerous, providing an example of an 81 Andre Dornelas, 'Relacao sobre a Serra Leoa'; de Almada, 'Rios de Guine', 365. 82 Archives of the Propaganda Fide (Rome)-Lettre Antichi, vol. 248, fo. 57,' Declaration of king Farma, emperor of the Sapes, in favour of Fr.

From the accounts of the Jesuits, the direct consequences were felt until i606, when the death of Farma, king of Port Loko, marked the end of an era. The defeat of the Sapes at the hands of the Manes was explicitly attributed to the lack of fighting spirit among the former, and their virtual ignorance of the arts of war, in contrast to the Manes. Mane methods of warfare won the admiration of Dornelas, who rated them as better warriors than the Senegal Wolofs, for whom he had the highest respect. Barreira praised the Sapes for their intelligence and their ability to learn, but he conceded that they had 'weak and effeminate minds'.88 Before him, De Almada had said much the same things. He claimed that the Sapes were 'given to feasts and pleasures, which they continually have, because the land gives everything in abundance, and they do not use arms like other nations'.89 This last statement is obviously exaggerated, because early in the sixteenth century the Sapes were said to have had their war captains, and to have organized war by sea and by land.90 The traders and missionaries who had knowledge of both peoples stressed the change which came over the Sapes by the end of the sixteenth century.'These Sapes who inhabit Sierra Leone and its vicinity were a weak and cowardly people; now with the discipline of the Manes they have become excellent soldiers and are good captains' was one assessment ;91 'the continuation of the war with the Manes has made them soldiers' was another.92 The Bulloms, who had previously been regarded as the most aggressive of the Sapes, came into closest contact with the Manes, and were subsequently considered as the most expert in the use of Mane arms and Mane methods of warfare.93 Throughout Sierra Leone, the arms, military strategy and fortifications had been profoundly influenced by the Manes. The bows, shields and knives described as being in the possession of most of the inhabitants of Sierra Leone in the early seven- teenth century were exactly the same as those which distinguished the Manes on their arrival. After service, both for and against the Manes, the people of Sierra Leone had learnt to fight in formation, using squadrons of archers and bowmen carrying the large Mane shields. The Mane entrenchments known as atabanka were in general use. These consisted of three or four fences of stout palisades, with a ditch on the outside. Tall towers and garrison posts were built on the walls, within which the older and less energetic archers remained.94 Planning encirclements and breaking out of sieges had become commonplace in Sierra Leone before the end of the sixteenth century.95 As far as military matters were concerned, the Sapes emerged the 88 Guerreiro, Relafao Anual, I, 409. 89 De Almada, 'Rios de Guine', 356. 90 Fernandes, La cote occidentale d'Afrique, 94. 91 De Almada, loc. cit. 374. 92 Guerreiro, op. cit.

The Sapes were sold to the Europeans in thousands, they were forced to labour for the new ruling class, their trade with the interior was interrupted, and their very creativity was severely impaired. When John Hawkins made his second slaving expedition to Sierra Leone in 1564 he found that the island of Sherbro had been transformed into a veritable granary. The Manes were using Sape labour to produce an abundance of millet, rice, root crops and palm wine.96 The Sapes were harshly used, and in some cases they made efforts to throw off the yoke, if only by flight. In 1572 some Sherbro Bulloms staged a revolt which their Mane chief, Shere Mambea, was unable to quell single-handed, and he left to seek the help of his confreres. In the meantime his Bullom subjects, who were grouped in one large village, withdrew in a body to the bush. When Dornelas saw the site in 1574 everything was still intact-houses, agricultural implements, pottery, pestles, etc. The number of people involved in this escape was I,ooo adult males, apart from women and children. Many other Sapes were successful in making their escape. With the help of the Portuguese, some made their way to the Cape Verde Islands and to Cacheu. Frequent mention was also made of a 'tribe' called Tagunchos or Dagunchos. They had fled from the Manes, and had settled down in a hilly and relatively inaccessible section near to the Great Scarcies.97 Mainly on the basis of their salt manufacture, the Sapes had been able to attract trade from the Futa Djalon. At one end of the trade routes the Fulas and Djalonkes supplied white cloth, cattle and gold. This was passed on through the Susus, who added iron and dyes. The caravans had usually followed the Pongo to the coast, and the Portuguese lanfados had entered the transit coastal trade which allowed the goods from the interior to reach the Sherbro and Gallinas. The Mane invasion forced the interior trade to find an outlet farther north (on the Nunez) and the coastal distribution southwards had to stop. Fortunately, by the end of the sixteenth century, conditions had become settled enough to permit a re- sumption of commerce on the Pongo.98 One of the most disastrous results of the Mane invasion was the destruction of the skills of the Sapes. In the early sixteenth century the Sapes had great reputations as artists and craftsmen, working in ivory and raffia. Both Pacheco Pereira and Valentim Fernandes praise them in the highest terms. What they found most striking was the ability of the Sapes to carve to European specification items such as spoons, salt-cellars, and dagger hilts. Valentim Fernandes wrote: 'the men in this country are the cleverest Negroes where manual art is concerned; they make salt- 96 Hakluyt Society, no.

And also it does not matter what work one sketches, they will carve it in ivory.'99 In his book Afro-Portuguese Ivories William Fagg established the identity of a number of ivory objects-spoons, forks, salt-cellars and horns-carved for European use and to European design, but fashioned by African artists in a style of their own. He was unable to identify the area of provenance, but considered the Slave Coast very probable. A. F. C. Ryder, basing his conclusions mainly on an account book of the Portuguese Casa de Guine for the year I504-5, and on the remarks of Pacheco Pereira, pointed out that Sierra Leone was the area from which the majority of these hybrid art specimens must have originated. He also warned that one could easily be misled by 'negative tradition', since Fagg had considered Sierra Leone an unlikely region on the grounds that no tradition of carving in ivory survived there.100 That neither skills nor tradition survived is due to the Mane invasions. After the Manes had arrived and settled in Sierra Leone, objects of high artistic merit were still to be seen. In the same vein as the early sixteenth-century writers, Manuel Alvares commented on the ivory spoons, the handles of which had carved on them various adornments such as the heads of animals, birds, and krifi,101 'with such perfection that when one has viewed them one has seen everything'. Unfortunately, many of the items he observed must have been carved at an earlier date and were no longer being produced. The Mane destruction of the Sape skills was made explicit-' It is the fault of these foreign kings that the country is so poor, because they have captured so many master craftsmen, and.. .have com- mitted so many vexations on the indigenous people that these latter have become less and less concerned and have given up the exercise of their arts.'102 It is also clear that a number of stone figures found in modern Mende country were associated with a pre-Mane culture. These anthropomorphic carvings, called Nomoli by the Mendes and Pomta by the Kissis, are not integral parts of the culture of the people who live there today, and have often been turned up accidentally in agricultural operations.103 They exist all over a region which would have been the original home of the Kissis, and the art of carving them was obviously lost in the face of a substantial invasion which entirely overran the area-almost certainly that of the Manes. Objects fashioned to European specification were but an insig- nificant part of the artistic output of the peoples of Sierra Leone. Art was functional-expressed in articles of domestic use, such as wooden bowls, pottery, stools and mats, and, above all, in the creation of ancestor images. 99 Fernandes, La cote occidentale d'Afrique, I04 (also pp. 76, 96); Pereira, Esmeraldo de Situ Orbis, 80, 84. 100 A.

For the coastal peoples the encounter with the Manes must indeed have been a traumatic experience. In at least one respect the Manes made a positive contribution to the domestic skills of the Sapes; and that was in the working of iron. Again, Manuel Alvares furnished precise information: 'Of the mechanic arts they have not a single office, with the exception of ironsmiths; and in the understanding of this they far surpass the naturals of Sierra Leone.' Turning to the records before the Mane invasions, one finds confirmation of the Sape limitations in the working of iron. In the early sixteenth century they were reported to have manufactured their own weapons, but they could not temper the iron properly and the product was brittle.106 Techniques of weaving cotton could possibly also have been brought by the Manes. Most of the cloth on the Sierra Leone littoral before the era of the Manes arrived by way of the Fulas and Susus, and the art of weaving was also introduced from the east and north. In the early nineteenth century, Major Laing noted that the manufacture of cloth among the Temnes was very limited, and that the techniques had been acquired from the Korankos to the east. He added that 'as the traveller advances eastward, he finds the natives improve both in the texture of the cloth and size of loom. In the country of Sangara very handsome and large cloths are manufactured... and form an important article of trade among the interior nations. I have seen cloths similar to those of Sangara on the Ivory and Gold Coast.'107 Obviously, therefore, the Manes could have made their contribution from the south-east. Today, the Mendes use a smaller loom than the Mandinga model originating in the north,108 and it is probably significant that the section of Temne country where weaving is practised is called Ro Mende.109 Both cotton and iron working further emphasize the Mande character- istics of the Manes. As far as craftsmanship in iron was concerned, the Manes were displaying the superiority of all the Mande peoples over the littoral tribes. Iron mining, smelting and refining were associated with the Susus and Mandingas, who had special clans or castes specializing in this craft. Such clans, like the Kante, often held positions of the highest authority within the tribal polity. On all these details the Manes conformed 104 Fernandes, op. cit. 88. 105 Person, 'Les Kissi et leurs statuettes de pierre'. 106 Fernandes, op. cit. 76. 107 G.

One of the principal Xinaslll or spirits of Sierra Leone in the early seventeenth century went under the name of Mane Mane. Physically, this comprised a pile of rocks with a sheaf of leaves placed in the centre. To this site the usual food offerings were made, but iron was the favourite item of oblation because the spirit which resided there was one to whom appeals were made on matters of honour and revenge, and iron was the instrument for this purpose.112 Besides this particular spirit, a whole range of 'medicines' for war seemed to have been brought by the Manes and accepted by the Sapes; no doubt because the success of the Manes would have been attributed in part to the efficacy of the means which they had at their disposal for ensuring the intervention of superior forces on their behalf. Among the Manes, women played a special role in the preparation of war 'medicines', and as a result the Mane invasions may well have strengthened existing female secret societies among the Sapes, and may perhaps have led to the formation of new ones. In the early sixteenth century, both male and female secret societies were known to the Portuguese as existing in Sierra Leone.13 By the end of that century it was made clear that the female societies were concerned mainly with the training of young girls who had reached the age of puberty. All the young girls of a given area who were to be initiated were placed in a large house isolated from other residences, remaining there for a year or more under the guardianship of an old man with the reputation of having led a virtuous life. During the period of seclusion, the girls were given new names, were sustained by food supplied by their parents, and underwent training which prompted the Portuguese to regard the institution in which they were housed as a convent. On graduating, they dressed in their best garments and attended feasts and dances, where the nobles and the young men had the opportunity of selecting their wives. These initiates were called Mendas.114 Almost in every detail, this description fits the Sande and Bundu female secret societies as they have survived into the twentieth century. It is unlikely that the Manes brought about any fundamental change in the pattern of female education and initiation, but they seemed to have added to the power of women. For instance, the Manes established a large village exclusively for women, who could only be visited by men under certain circumstances. Their main function was the manufacture of 'medi- 110 Alvares, op. cit. 11 Xinas were represented by many Europeans as fetishes, but in fact the term usually referred to a locality or an object in which a spirit resided. 112 Alvares, op. cit. 113 Ferandes op. cit. 88. 114 De Almada, loc. cit. 352. 242 WALTER RODNEY</page><page sequence="25">A RECONSIDERATION OF THE MANE INVASIONS cines', especially for war, and every king had one of these 'priestesses' in his service, allowing her wide privileges.115 Another contributory factor in this context was the political power which a woman of high birth could wield in Mane political circles. Mobora, the sister of Farma Boure, was one of the most outstanding political figures in Sierra Leone during the early seventeenth century. Her authority was attributed partly to the fact that, had she been a man, she would have been king, and partly to her own personal qualities.16 Recalling that the Mane movement was at the outset supposedly led by a woman, it could be that behind the Mane kings there was a female figure in the capacity of 'queen mother', but, whether there was any such institution or not, very high status was obviously accorded to some Mane women, which would have strengthened the female secret societies, as well as allowing them to play some role in the preponderantly male societies. Today, the office of Mabole in the Poro society, which is held by a woman, commands the highest respect, and has an integral role in the ceremonial life and purpose of that organization.ll7 In one case of the male secret societies, the evidence also suggests that the Manes gave a great impetus to institutions that were already established. Only the most obvious externals were described in the sixteenth century. Women could not enter the lodge of the male societies, nor were they permitted to pass nearby when the deliberations or prayers were going on.118 The plebeians were told that on certain days a powerful spirit walked abroad, requiring that they should shut their doors and keep off the streets. What happened at this time was that the king and the nobles ran naked in the streets, making a great commotion. If any outsider came across their path, he was either killed or made a member.119 By the beginning of the seventeenth century the situation described was recognizably the same as that which exists today. There were three important societies, called the Pero, the Benle and the Cymo-which must clearly have been the Poro, the Ragbenle and the Simo, not only because of the close similarity of names, but also because the details which are supplied make the identifications possible. The Cymo, for instance, was said to have operated among the most northerly of the Sapes-Manes, and today it is indeed confined to the Nalus and Bagas. In the case of the Benle, it is striking that Manuel Alvares should have considered it as a very exclusive association, because the restricted nature of the Ragbenle is one of the characteristics to which modern scholars have drawn atten- tion.120 As far as the Poro is concerned, mention was made by Valentim Fernandes of a secret society with a female mascot called Pere, which 115 Alvares, op. cit.

The question of the spread of the secret societies of Sierra Leone has long been of interest. Butt-Thompson suggested that the Poro was intro- duced by the Temnes as an adaptation of the Simo, which they had known in the area that is now the Republic of Guinea, but the Temne traditions say that the Poro was borrowed by them from the Sherbro Bulloms, while the Mendes claim to be its originators.l22 This latter claim is interesting in the light of Alvares's opinion that the Poro was a Mane introduction, but, if anything, it would have belonged to the Bullom-Kissi peoples who were overrun in the south of Sierra Leone and who were incorporated into what is now the Mende tribe. The female organization, the Bundu, which is widespread in Temne country, is also felt to have been derived from the Sande of the Mendes.l23 When the strength of the secret societies is viewed in relation to the geography of the Upper Guinea Coast, a certain pattern emerges. From the Gambia southwards to Cape Verga there are to be found associations for circumcision and initiation, but no all-powerful secret societies comparable to the Poro. Powerful secret societies were part of the cultural make-up of all the Sapes; and moving from north to south among the latter the strength of the institution grows. It is well entrenched among the Sherbro Bulloms, and even more so in Liberia. The Vais in Liberia have the most elaborate form of the Poro,124 and it seems feasible that they and other early inhabitants of Cape Mount playing an important role in the Mane conquest would have contributed to the increased authority of the Poro, Sande and the like, as they moved northwards. Another issue of importance hinges on the political power of the secret societies, in relationship both to the local tribal authorities and to the rulers over large areas of country. In a comprehensive review of the Poro, Little concluded from historical data and from the results of field inquiries, that there were 'inner councils' of the Poro, who were the effective government in the chiefdoms, but it is doubtful whether there was a centralized supreme council.125 On both these points, sixteenth- and seventeenth-century contemporary authorities yield some information. The secret societies are all hierarchically organized in grades, and the highest grade or inner circle was obviously the seat of power within the tribe. This 'inner council' was described by the Portuguese as the 'old men's Cymo', its members making public appearances only at important functions such as the death of a king.126 These old men or nobles or solategis, as they were called, met in the Funco or 'Palaver House' in the 121 Fernandes, op. cit. 84. 122 McCulloch, op. cit. 30. 123 McCulloch, op. cit. 69. 124 Ibid. 93. 125 K.

When Hawkins was in Sierra Leone he learnt from the resident Portuguese traders that in the Funco the nobles made their decisions concerning peace and war, about the harvesting of the grain, and about the time for tapping the palm wine.127 At a later date these were all known to be decisions within the province of the Poro, and in the sixteenth century De Almada considered the nobles or solategis as being identical with those members of the secret society who had the right of parading in company with the guardian spirit at times when the 'plebeians' (sic) had to be indoors. Furthermore, these solategi wore masks and costumes when they appeared in the Funco. It was speculated that they were disguised when defending clients so as to be able to speak their minds frankly before the king, but the masks were the distinguishing mark of the secret societies. In the sixteenth century the masks were called arons,128 which is the name retained within the Ragbenle society.129 More pertinent to the coming of the Manes is the debatable point about the extent to which the activities of all the local lodges were centrally controlled and directed. In recent times this facet of the organization of the secret societies seems to have declined, but there have been hints of a 'Grand Poro' with wide cross-chiefdom powers for making wars and settling disputes.130 Such powers were wielded in the early seventeenth century, and they emanated from a centralized institution. The Poro 'University' (sic) was said to have been situated just beyond Cape Mount. Students spent four years there, during which time they were equipped to conserve the peace and deal with homicides and revolts.131 One cannot be certain that the 'University' was founded by the Manes, but if it had existed before their arrival they had good reason to strengthen it. It was a logical solution to the difficulties which the dispersed Mane ruling class would have faced in trying to govern so wide an area. Apart from common training at Cape Mount, the Mane kings met from time to time in what were very likely to have been Poro councils. For instance, when Farma, the first Mane king of Port Loko, died in i606, his funeral was attended by important persons from 'beyond Cape Ledo on the Mala- guetta Coast'.132 Those persons would have been members of the inner circles of the secret organizations, since Farma was important enough to warrant their presence at his 'cry' or funeral ceremony. Besides, a 'cry' could be held at certain intervals after burial had taken place, and this was sometimes used as a pretext for a political convention. On one occasion a Mane king was anxious to hold a 'cry', ostensibly on behalf of an ancestor, but the gathering was regarded primarily as an important political con- ference, where a subject of importance to the Manes as a whole was to be 127 Hakluyt Society, no.

Rulers from all over Sierra Leone were ready to attend, though the success of the venture was jeopardized by the intransigence of Tora, the oldest of the Mane kings, then ruling over Temne subjects.133 Such a gathering could hardly have been contemplated outside of the councils of the secret societies or of 'the cult of the masks' ;134 and it is to be reiterated that the intertribal feature was a logical concomitant to the superimposition of the Mane ruling class. By I623 the phrase 'Sapes Manes' was used to describe the ethnic situation in Sierra Leone.135 There were areas where the Mane element was more pronounced, as in the former Bullom-Kissi country in the Gallinas and the former Temne country on Port Loko Creek, giving rise to the Mendes and Lokos, respectively. Elsewhere, the Manes were com- pletely assimilated, and, even though there were references to wars between the Manes and the Sapes in the third quarter of the seventeenth century, the distinction between the two people had long worn thin. The Mane invasions constitute a typical episode in the spread of the influence of the Mande in West Africa, which is recognized as one of the most important themes in the history of West Africa.136 And, to generalize even further, as J. D. Fage has done with reference to similar occurrences in Ghana, 'this process of the eventual mergence of small groups of state-forming conquerors with the more numerous populations of the conquered would seem to be the key to a great deal of African history'.137 SUMMARY As a contribution to an already considerable historiography, it is suggested here that the Mane invaders of Sierra Leone comprised two principal elements -a ruling elite originating in the southern section of the Mande world of the Western Sudan, and numerical forces drawn from the area around Cape Mount. The first stage of movement took place in the first half of the sixteenth century, carrying Mande clans to the Liberian coast from the region around Beyla and perhaps even from the hinterland of modern Ghana. There then followed a number of incursions into Sierra Leone during the third quarter of the sixteenth century. A new ruling class was established in Sierra Leone and adjacent regions, bringing increased exploitation and causing the destruction of the indigenous ivory-carving skills. On the other hand, the Manes brought improved military techniques and advances in the manufacture of iron and cloth. They also profoundly influenced religious and social patterns, particularly with respect to the secret societies of the area. 133 Ibid. 250. 134 Little, 'The political function of the Poro'. He cites Harley to the effect that the pinnacle of power may not have lain within the Poro, but rather within the cult of the masks, of which the Poro was the most highly developed form for manifesting the power of the ancestors towards the people. 135 Alonso de Sanderval, Natureleza de Todos Etiopes, 40. 136 Jan Vansina, R.
