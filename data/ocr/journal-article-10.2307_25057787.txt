<plain_text><page sequence="1">GEORGE'S HIVE AND THE GEORGIAN HINGE By Robert L. Patten Victorian political and social thought was shaped to some extent in response to the French Revolution and the Regency. One widely circulated mid-nineteenth-century emblem of the State is George Cruikshank's The British Bee Hive, which he designed in 1840 during a second wave of Chartist agitation whose origins and program extend backward into the first decades of the century (Fig. 1). The Bee Hive was not published, however, until twenty-seven years later, on the eve of the second Reform Bill, when Cruik shank's "Penny Political Picture for the People" gave him an oppor tunity to address his public one more time "with a few words upon Parliamentary Reform" and the constitutional subjects that had preoccupied him "for upwards of fifty years."1 As an expression of populous enterprise and the stable class hierarchies of the British bourgeois monarchy, George Cruikshank's beehive embodies in its design and accompanying letterpress not only his notions about the second Reform Bill, but also ideas growing out of earlier polit ical, social, and graphic controversies. Though Cruikshank's image expresses some of his own idiosyn cratic hobbyhorses, The British Bee Hive has been taken in the twentieth century as a characteristic sign of the Victorian age: it was reproduced on the cover of a Winter 1981-82 book dealer's catalogue offering a large selection of Dickens items (Jarndyce 26) and in the program of the Royal Shakespeare Company's original production of Nicholas Nickleby, vastly enlarged, it appeared on the drop curtain of the New York and London productions of Sweeney Todd. By tracing the origins of George's hive in the propaganda wars of the Georgian period we can learn how popular art images 37</page><page sequence="2">i George Cruikshank, The British Bee Hive.

Let me start my investigation of the sources of George's hive with a brief recapitulation of what I have called the Georgian hinge - more specifically, the troubled period 1818-21 when, after the defeat of the French, England came close to revolution from a restive population and experienced recurring crises in government caused by periodic recessions, the supersession of George III, the repressive legislation of the Six Acts (1819), the Cato Street con spiracy, and the Queen Caroline affair. Prosecuting a long and expensive war had forced the government to make repeated efforts to enlist the support of all segments of society. An enormous propaganda campaign mounted by both the Ministry and the Opposition had shaped an image of the true Briton as John Bull - sturdy, bluff, shrewd in his own native way, honest, pugnacious, slow to anger but resolute in defense of his liberties.2 This figure gave the people someone to identify with and helped to deflect the most dangerous of all the French threats: as the Czar put it in 1804, "the general opinion which France has managed to promulgate, that her cause is the cause of national liberty and prosperity."3 The Radical Opposition, through its liberal MPs and such publi cists as William Cobbett, Richard Carlile, and Orator Hunt, con tinually urged the adoption of certain parts of the revolutionary political program: reform of Parliament, universal male suffrage, secret ballots, freedom of the press, and a minimum wage to guarantee individual liberty and prosperity. The Radicals, Dorothy George points out, "maintained that all the sufferings of the people were due to a corrupt Parliament which taxed the country for the benefit of placemen and pensioners and that the sole and complete cure was universal suffrage and annual parliaments - ancient rights of the people of Britain" (2:179). But Liverpool's postwar policies were directed by what Asa Briggs terms a "patronizing paternalism" that rested on assump tions about hierarchical and oligarchical government fundamen tally challenged by the Radicals (215). Liverpool and his Home Secretary, Lord Sidmouth, believed that secular and religious authority belonged solely to the top echelons of the class pyra mids and that those echelons bore the responsibility for exercising</page><page sequence="4">40 BROWNING INSTITUTE STUDIES authority on behalf of the country. The country was thought to consist of those who owned land, and to a lesser extent those who produced wealth by other means, along with those who maintained order - the armed forces, legal officers, and clerics, who sometimes doubled as magistrates. Under this Tory theory of representative government, the majority of the people, who had no ownership stake in the country, existed only to serve and to be governed. Granting them universal male suffrage and secret ballots would be turning government upside down, handing over responsibility to those who - ignorant, emotional, and with nothing to lose - could easily be deluded, bribed, and used by demagogues. Hence Liverpool's (and Lord Grey's) detestation of those Westminster MPs and City Radicals who toured the provinces haranguing large audiences on behalf of Reform; hence also the Government's unavailing efforts through legislation and prosecution to silence the radical press, which, it was contended, campaigned for a wholesale inversion of authority and power. Since no one document comprised the British Constitution, Whigs, Tories, Liberals, and Radicals ransacked competing tradi tions for historical and ideological precedent. Greek and Roman theories of government were absorbed as part of the classical educa tion acquired by all who went to establishment schools. The medieval heritage of Magna Charta, the Common Law, and prece dent, all of which privileged property, was appealed to by the great landowners and the most influential part of the legal profession. This was the heritage Burke reformulated; though interpreted dif ferently it was also a source for Radicals (Beales 51). Some deplored the Norman Conquest, believing that it supplanted ancient Anglo Saxon liberties with Gallic authoritarianism and the argument of divine right, while others grounded their beliefs in the Bible and England's Protestant tradition. Whigs often traced their political principles to the Glorious Revolution and the supremacy of Parlia ment; this was the view Macaulay enshrined in his History. And all positions on the political spectrum appealed to certain abstract principles - preeminently justice and truth - as sanction for their policies. As the country's leading postwar caricaturist, George Cruikshank was aware of these constitutional controversies, and though his</page><page sequence="5">George's hive 41 etching needle was available for hire by both sides, most of his work supported the Opposition. A fierce nationalist and patriot, he campaigned for freedom of the press and the liberties of the people, but not universal suffrage, which in "An Allegory" for the conser vative dealer George Humphrey he condemned as "the Scum Up permost" (17 July 1819, BM 13248). In that savage attack Cruik shank terms '"Radical Reform' in plain English Revolution." He depicts the hydra-headed monster of Revolution crushing the Bible, the scales of Justice, Magna Charta, the Bill of Rights, and emblems of industry and commerce arranged in an inverted pyramid resting on its point, the crown and scepter. Cruikshank also abhorred atheism and regicidal republicanism; he depicted Richard Carlile and the Radicals as English Jacobins in league with the devil and infidels to turn the Erastian monarchy "Topsyturvy" (16 October 1819, bm 13274; see also 13 November 1819, BM 13275). The "World Upside Down" is a topos with a lengthy broadsheet history stretching from the mid-sixteenth to the mid nineteenth century; here and in many other instances Cruikshank applies it to politics (Kunzle "Bruegel," "World Upside Down"). Events between 1818 and 1821 caused Cruikshank to clarify his ideas and to fashion an iconography for the moderate left. In December 1818 his publisher and collaborator, William Hone, successfully defended himself on three consecutive days against Government prosecutions for blasphemy, sedition, and libel. Cruikshank celebrated the victories with a number of etchings and woodcuts extolling freedom of the press, gradually turning an anthropomorphic printing press into a symbol of vigilant, quasi divine illumination (Fig. 2).4 Soon after, the so-called Peterloo massacre of 16 August 1819 provoked the Government into passing the notorious Six Acts, one of which was the Blasphemous and Seditious Libels Act, or "Gag ging Bill," an effort to control and restrict anti-Ministerial prop aganda. Cruikshank responded by adapting earlier images of John Bull crushed by a pyramid of armies, taxes, and expensive monar chies. These models included a 1797 print by his father, showing a muzzled and overburdened bull.5 In George's Poor Bull &amp; His Burden (15 December 1819, bm 13288), an enormous (John) Bull lies chained to the ground, muzzled by the Gagging Bill (Fig. 3). On his back rises a huge pyramid of men, topped by a weighted crown.

Wellington had recently been added to the Cabinet as Master of the Ordnance in a move the Radicals interpreted as auguring further military repression. Wearing a butcher's apron and brandishing his executioner's axe, he is depicted facing the beast. Below the title is a vague intimation of revolution, adapted from William Cowper's account in The Task (2:832) of the Egyptian plague of frogs, which Hone was then applying to the current political situation: "'And the land stank - so num'rous was the fry.' ?What will become of these Vermin, if the Bull should Rise -?!!!!!!!!!!!" In Cruikshank's satire Liverpool's pyramidal Government, though grounded and based on John Bull, threatens to destroy him, and the response of the sorely tried animal, foreshadowed by the letterpress, might be an uprising that would shake the foundation of the kingdom and topple the crown. An even more savage attack on the pyramidal theory of govern ment appeared two years later when in August 1821 Hone and Cruikshank collaborated on a mock newspaper called A Slap at Slop and the Bridge Street Gang.6 The Constitutional Association, which Hone renames the "Bridge Street Gang," had been founded in December 1820, shortly after the accession of George iv. Its objec tive was to suppress libel, on the grounds that radical squibs aimed at dethroning the new King and overturning the Constitution. By the summer of 1821 Hone among others had been cited in informa tions covertly sponsored by the Constitutional Association, but Parliament rebelled against what the Liberal brewer Samuel Whit bread compared to "the inquisition of Spain," and Grand Juries threw out the indictments. To celebrate that victory, Hone and Cruikshank once again employed the image of the pyramid to condemn authoritarianism. In a plate entitled "the magnificent pyramid," which has been "completely reversed," Cruikshank depicts the emblem of the State turned upside down and resting on its apex, the crown (bm 14215, Fig. 4). This teetering edifice is "shored up" by swords, cannons, and bayonets - all the might of a repressive military force - and comprises the Commons at its broad base, the Lords in the middle, and the King at its apex. Not John Bull but his representatives in the Commons now constitute the base or ground of society; and stability is not merely threatened</page><page sequence="8">44 BROWNING INSTITUTE STUDIES should the long-suffering bull choose to throw off his tormentors; it is now radically and permanently impaired. Wellington as poten tial executioner has been replaced by the spikes and cannon of the armed forces, all that prevents this "inverted state" from top pling over. In part, "the magnificent pyramid" responds to preceding pamphlets that, in turn, parodied earlier efforts by Hone and Cruik shank. In The Palace offohn Bull, a conservative reply to Hone and Cruikshank's House that Jack Built, "England's firm pyramid" of King, Lords, and Commons, exemplifying "The Numerous and Diversified Blessings of the British Constitution, " is inverted and turned "topsy-turvey" by Radicals in the two following plates (January 1820, bm 13555-62, bm 13558-60). The accompanying verses employ the familiar image of a crushing weight destroying the Constitution: The Cone inverted shews a wide extended plain, Where rampant Radicals, may rage &amp; roar &amp; reign, But lo! the foundation now placed on the top, Too heavy the pressure! the whole must soon drop. But it was Hone's and Cruikshank's image that more effectively captured the public's imagination. As the popular Irish novelist Lady Morgan observed: Ridicule derives its efficacy from the responsive sympathies of the audience addressed. . . . When Hone represented the British Constitution by an inverted pyramid, resting on the crown at its apex, and supported by bayonets, the sensible image of instability he presented found a prompt reflection in the public mind. He advanced, however, no novel statement. If a conviction had not pre-existed in public opinion of "something rotten in the state of Denmark, " his humour would not have told. Had he supported the tottering edifice with a printing press, instead of a bayonet, the misrepresentation would have been rejected with scorn (Qtd. in Hackwood 105). Lady Morgan, with a writer's instinctive bias for the verbal over the visual, neglects Cruikshank's contribution to this image, though in fact the pyramid as an emblem of an oligarchical state had figured in his previous graphic satires and would continue to figure for many years. As late as 1841, in proposing a "monument to napoleon!" Cruikshank inventively combines the hill of Golgotha with a ceremonial statue's plinth and the pyramid of tyranny (Om nibus 26), and in 1853 he tops a pyramid of dead Turks massacred at</page><page sequence="9">i?

If the "patronizing paternalism" of Liverpool's conception of the state presaged revolution, what alternative conception might guarantee stability, order, liberty, and prosperity? Hone and Cruikshank addressed this question in another of their inexpensive pamphlets combining inventive letterpress with telling woodblock engravings: "Gunpowder in Boxwood," Robert Cruikshank called them (June-July 1821, bm 14194). In December 1819 they issued their most famous collaboration, The Political House that Jack Built, (bm 13292-304, Fig. 5). Adaptations of the child's nursery rhyme were a staple of the caricature tradition: Rowlandson (27 October 1809, bm 11414), Williams (September 1809, bm 11417), and Isaac and George Cruikshank (September 1809, bm 11415, 11416) had all previously applied the verses to Jack Kemble's Covent Garden g?rtmttsenunt?, ?\ 4 George Cruikshank, "the magnificent pyramid."

In the Hone-Cruikshank version, Jack becomes John Bull - in other words, the British public - and his House becomes the British Constitution, under attack from "The Vermin" of Liverpool's government. These depredators in clude those who tormented the Bull in Cruikshank's earlier plate, along with the Public Informer, who would silence the Press, and a Janus-faced Clerical Magistrate, who though vowing "from all worldly studies to cease," Breaks the Peace of the Church, to be Justice of Peace. The Political House is preeminently a defense of freedom of the press in the wake of the Gagging Bill, as Cruikshank's title page vignette illustrates. A uniformed Wellington tosses his sword, a metonym for the armed might of the State, onto one pan of the scales of Justice that already contains three scrolls inscribed "Bank Restriction," "Bill of Indemn[it]y," and "Ex-Officio" - that is, informations of the sort lodged against Hone in 1817. The feather pen that lies in the other pan, however, outweighs all these, for as the motto implies, the pen is once again mightier than the sword. Here Cruikshank uninsistently recalls not only Wellington as butcher who threatens John Bull in Poor Bull &amp; His Burden, but also a long series of caricatures that employed the scales of Justice to correct, at least figuratively, governmental abuses. Freedom of the press, the pamphlet argues, insures the defense of the people's ancient liberties and the British Constitution. Govern ment repression and hierarchical paternalism had brought the pyramid as emblem of the State into disrepute. To image Jack's ideal political House, Cruikshank devises a neo-Classical temple derived from mid-eighteenth-century emblematic prints, which in its very architectural style adverts to Britain's Greek and Roman political heritage (Fig. 6). Set in a garden, the temple's dome is supported on three columns labeled "King," "Commons," and "Lords" - it is surmounted by a statue of Liberty holding a staff topped by the Phrygian cap of Liberty. Cruikshank's icon, though still essentially conservative, is more Whig than Tory in theory: it expresses a concept of representative government, a House that Jack, not landlords, built, where the people act through Parliament in conjunction with a constitutional monarch (Hanham).

In ways that are both economical and richly associative every element of the design bespeaks the harmony of diverse ele ments: Nature and artifact, Parliament and Ruler, liberty and law. Though the people are not present either directly or through per sonification (John Bull), they are source, creator, and beneficiary of this Constitution: source, since Liberty is the apex and true crown of the edifice; creator, since this is the House that Jack built; and beneficiary, since the temple is open and accessible to all. But the motto, again taken from Cowper's The Task (5:535), implies that this House may not endure much longer: "A distant age asks where the fabric stood." On the page facing the Greek temple symbolizing Jack's Con stitutional House is a plate showing a Gothic treasure chest, emblematic of England's medieval heritage (Fig. 7). This constitu tional source was emphasized by "Chartist, radical and country politicians for most of the nineteenth century" (Hanham 2). The chest is stuffed with scrolls marked "Magna Charta," "Bill of Rights," and "Habeas Corpus"; books, coins, and bags of money lie alongside. "This is the Wealth that lay In the House that Jack built," the legend explains; it is in contrast to the scrolls of repres sion overbalanced by the pen of a free press in the vignette title. The Political House attracted the public's attention and shillings. On the other hand, Carlton House tried to ignore it. The Prince Regent, attending a meeting of the Privy Council, "laid it on the table without saying a word," Hone reported, and "after he was gone, some one present said, 'We have had enough of William Hone' - and no notice was taken of it" (Hackwood 220). But rival publishers, noting that Hone was printing new editions almost daily, quickly got up their own versions. Some were weak and pallid imitations while others attempted to refute the pamphlet point by point, altering Hone's rhymes and Cruikshank's cuts to conform to alternative positions along the political spectrum. The Palace of John Bull, for example, scoffs at Radicals trying to overturn "England's firm pyramid" and substitutes the aristocratic values implicit in "Palace" for the bourgeois ones implicit in "House." The publishers Dean and Munday brought out a parody sympathe tic to the Radicals, called The Dorchester Guide; or, A House that Jack</page><page sequence="15">?

It adapts Hone's verses and Cruikshank's wood engravings to praise of Richard Carlile, "a chief, of Deistical Fame," who had been imprisoned for three years in Dorchester Gaol for publishing Thomas Paine's Age of Reason. In this pamphlet Jack's House is represented by the facade of that jail, decorated with shackles. A more substantial refutation of The Political House, expressing conservative theories of government, was issued by a consortium of City and West End publishers (1819: bm 13306-17; Fig. 8). Its very title - The Real or Constitutional House that Jack Built - asserts the fictiveness of its rival Political House, and the epigraph, "Look on this Picture, and on that, " enlists Hamlet to stigmatize the Hone Cruikshank publication as a kind of Claudian usurpation of legiti mate authority.7 As with so much other conservative propaganda, here too the Bible is identified as the sole source both of law and of hierarchical authority. In the background of the vignette title Cruikshank's Constitutional temple is crumbling. Resting on an Ionic capital in the foreground are the emblems of the dawn of a new era: a map of the solar system, inscribed "Order is heaven's first law" (thus invoking Pope's Essay on Man as a counterblast to Cowper's The Task), the Bible enclosing an anchor, an abstract of English laws, and a volume entitled Principles of the British Constitu tion. On this foundation are piled a cushion, palm branches, the crown, and a lyre; the whole pyramidal structure is flanked and formally reinforced by a scepter, a sword, and oak leaves. The base or ground of this theory is not popular consent but Augustan natural law, itself a manifestation of divine order, which sanctions hierarchy, rule, enforced order, and the lyric harmony celebrated in Dryden's "Song for St. Cecilia's Day." The subsequent illustrations of the "Constitutional House" and the "Treasures" amplify and extend the point-by-point refutation of The Political House. Cruikshank's temple of the Constitution, whose collapse is imaged in the vignette title, is here refabricated (Fig. 9). The dome and statue of Liberty are cropped, however, and the temple is changed to a combination of royal audience chamber and religious enclosure. The pillars of Lords and Commons guard access to the throne (backed by the pillar of King), which sits on a dais surrounded by female personifications of justice, truth, war, and peace. The throne is empty, signifying George Hi's superses sion. In the background an altar and the tablets of the Ten Com</page><page sequence="17">THE REAL OB CONSTITUTIONAL HOUSE THAT JACK BUILT. ?

Everything in this revision of Cruikshank's emblem speaks to authoritarianism: religious and secular laws are handed down from on high, and legitimacy ultimately issues from God and certain abstract principles, rather than deriving from the consent of the governed. Not only scripture but also Hone's favor ite secular text is quoted in support of these conservative principles; the Constitutional House appropriates a different passage from Cowper's The Task (2:206?09) in its epigraph: "England, with all thy faults, I love thee still - . . . " The Constitutional House's "Treasures" are likewise based on religious principles (Fig. 10). Emblems of national prosperity - agricultural produce, commerce, medicine, and the arts - are ar ranged like votive offerings around the Bible and altar, while the epigraph urges "patriots" to guard this treasure "with a miser's care. To put the matter crudely, these antithetical political pamphlets set authoritarian forms of government, represented by column and pyramid, against forms, such as the temple, that imply a more broadly based and consensual Constitution. Variants of the pyramid and column as both true and false ideal appear in the enormously inventive pamphlets and toys issued during the heated propaganda campaign on behalf of Caroline of Brunswick, es tranged wife of the Prince Regent, who returned to England after her husband's accession and tried to claim her rightful prerogatives as Queen Consort, among which was inclusion in the Anglican liturgy. The furious King forced Liverpool to introduce a bill of divorce, which passed in the Lords by such a small margin on the third reading that the Government thankfully dropped the matter. Hone and Cruikshank, churning out squibs on behalf of "Eng land's royal darling," invented an A-frame stepladder as a variant both on the pyramidal theory of hierarchical government and on the familiar topos of the rise and fall of princes (Fig. 11). In The Queen's Matrimonial Ladder Hone's verses and Cruikshank's wood engravings trace each step in the royal couple's marital progress, from "Qualification" - the Prince Regent's tipsy and bankrupt condition prior to his betrothal - to "Degradation" when, as King, George iv is imagined in church doing penance wrapped in a sheet, in front of the tables of the Ten Commandments ([August] 1820, bm 13790-805).

Hone and Cruikshank also produced a separate "toy," a folding pasteboard stepladder with the same names on the rungs but with different pictures, illustrating the King's cowardly and unchivalrous conduct and the Queen's nobility, her association with the printing press, Truth, and Liberty ([August] 1820, bvm 13808; Fig. 12). But Queen Caroline was not spotless. And some of her radical supporters were tainted by association with the Cato Street con spirators - caught in a loft in Cato Street planning to blow up the Cabinet - and by association with the Peterloo Massacre. The Loyal Association, pro-King, persuaded Cruikshank to adapt the Matrimonial Ladder to the King's cause for a plate in the Loyalist's Magazine ([October] 1820, bm 13895, 13895A). "The Radical Lad der," which parodies both the Constitutional House and the Matrimo nial Ladder, became such a popular image on the conservative side that it was reissued as a frontispiece to a pamphlet, enlarged into a separate plate for George Humphrey, and quoted in a later carica ture drawn by Theodore Lane (Fig. 13). It depicts a greedy and ambitious Queen, clambering to the top of a flimsy stepladder. She is followed by a train of gnomelike Jacobins, sheltered under her long cloak. They carry a banner inscribed "Democracy republic" and wear Liberty caps with tricolor cockades. The steps of this ladder are denominated "spa fields riot," "smithfield," "hunts PROCESSION," UPETER[lOO]," "CATO STRE[et]," "QUEENS ARRI VAL," "radical addresses," and "mob government." The de scending rungs, much further apart and affording a precipitous decline, are "revolution," "anarchy," and "ruin." The Queen, holding a firebrand that produces as much obscuring smoke as it does light, reaches toward the emblem of Jack's Constitutional House, a pillar based on a plinth signed with the balanced scales of Justice. The miter and crosier carved on the pillar signify the Angli can Church, and by extension its liturgy, while a banner spiraling around the column conflates the three pillars of the earlier temple, King, Lords, and Commons. For Cruikshank the Commons is still the broad base of the tapering structure; he uses entasis to express political theory. On top of the column's capital is a cushion on which rest the Bible and a crown, irradiated in the way the printing press usually is lit as a symbol of light and truth in Cruikshank's plates; the crown gives off a clear illumination in contrast to the the Queen's smoky torch.</page><page sequence="22">THE QUEEN'S MATRIMONIAL LADDER, a f?attonal Caj, WiTH FOURTEEN STEP SCENES; AH? t ILLUSTRATIONS IN VERSE, WITH EIGHTEEN OTHER CUiS.

The same pyramidal shape that elsewhere signifies oligarchy and repression here imports the opposite but equivalent danger of mob government. Moderate reformers must find some middle way between the two instabilities of the inverted pyramid and the rickety ladder, must articulate some composition of political and social constituencies that is broadly based in history, traditional institutions, religious sanction, law, and popular consent. In a small wood engraving for Hone's Slap at Slop Cruikshank anticipates aspects of the composition he will bring to fruition in the British Bee Hive (bm 14228; Fig. 14). It illustrates a mock peti tion from the Corporation of London Bridge to the "Corporation of Boroughmongers in Palaverment" assembled, protesting against the erection of a new bridge with broad "arches calculated to give free course to the whole tide, and a safe and uninterrupted public communication. " (A real committee on the State of London Bridge had recommended in May the building of a new bridge of not more than five arches.) This London Bridge Corporation extols its de crepit arches as "exactly as numerous, as narrow, and as decayed as they ought to be"; cites the Emperor of Austria who declared "that what is ancient is good"; and entreats Palaverment to stop the enlargement. For such a simple squib the references are surprisingly complex. The Bridge Street Gang stands for the Constitutional Association, loyalists working to suppress the Radical press, and according to Dorothy George, Boroughbridge was "par-excellence the abhorred and symbolic nomination borough," much in the news a decade later during the debates on the Reform Bill of 18 3 2.8 For present purposes it is less important to understand the source of Hone's and Cruikshank's imagery than to interpret its signifi cance. The broad arches of the new bridge facilitate commerce over and on the Thames. They replace barriers to access with opportu nity for access, and they save "unnecessary annual expense, and loss of lives." The broadest and highest arch, labeled "commons," bridges the central channel down which a ship sails; the flanking arches are "king" and "lords." Cruikshank's image and Hone's letterpress suggest that an enlarged Commons would facilitate</page><page sequence="25">''vitW?f?tAL.lAbBBiL 13 George Cruikshank, "The Radical Ladder," The Loyalist's Magazine.

The right kind of Constitutional Association, those interested in bridge Reform rather than the Bridge Street Gang's repression, could construct a bridge between the people and their government, between a free press and an unfettered commerce, to the destruction of boroughmongers, place seekers, and outmoded ancient privileges. The association between commerce and reform of the Commons answers the Conservative argument about the divine source of England's treasure and antici pates some fifty years of reform movements aiming to incorporate commercial, industrial, and urban constituencies into the British constitution.9 Unfortunately for graphic satire, the attention paid by both sides to the Queen Caroline affair deflected national energies from the re volutionary impulses of 1819-20 into the "transitory fever" of a royal squabble (George, Caricature 2:188).10 A Slap at Slop was one of the last of the Hone-Cruikshank collaborations; Hone turned to antiquarian research and Cruikshank to book illustration. As early as October 1820, in the frontispiece to the first installment of Pierce Egan's Life in London, Cruikshank converted the Constitutional pillar into a Corinthian column where the enthroned King gives audience to the "Roses, Pinks, and Tulips, the Flowers of Society" - that is, the nobility and the swells of fashion. Instead of an emblematic exegesis on political legitimacy, he supplies a picture, hierarchically organized, of the ups and downs - the "Ins &amp; Outs," in short - of "the varieties of Life in London" ([October 1820], bm 14330). Interest in politics gave way to explorations of the pleasures of urban life until agitation over Reform rose at the end of the 1820s. By then the satirical print was being replaced by carica ture magazines that were more social and conservative than their predecessors; the final campaign for the first Reform Bill was therefore not marked by a significant revival of independent politi cal satires and pamphlets. But Cruikshank neither forgot nor recanted the political philosophy born in these troubled years. That vision of the British Constitution as consensual, cooperative, and representative-rather than hierarchical, authoritarian, and abstract - was reiterated in</page><page sequence="28">64 BROWNING INSTITUTE STUDIES 1840, at the height of the Chartist movement, when he first de signed The British Bee Hive. As Farrell has noted, the analogy between a hive and a polity goes back to Aristotle, Pliny, and Cicero. It can be found in the Bible and in medieval commentaries. It was revitalized during the Renaissance by Erasmus and Elyot, who applied it to ideal kingly behavior, to "iuste gouvernaunce or rule." And it became a point of debate both for Hobbes, who maintained that human beings, competitive and self-interested creatures, could not live in a state of natural cooperation like bees, and for Mandeville, who satirized the notion of man's "private vices" ever attaining the hive's "public benefits" (Farrellpassim). If Cruikshank was aware of these sources, they had come to him filtered through popular and graphic intermediaries; he takes the hive as a metaphor for self-interest serving social ends and as an illustration of appropriate hierarchy, a standard symbol of "de gree, " as Ulysses characterizes it in Troilus and Cressida (Farrell 520). The hive had other connotations that Cruikshank absorbed from graphic and literary traditions. It was a metaphor for British indus try: Macaulay, describing the aftermath of the Glorious Revolu tion, called England "A busy and populous hive, in which new wealth was every day created" (Qtd. in "Hive," oed). Caricature prints, including one by Cruikshank where the iconography is "unexplained," represent John Bull's treasure as honey-laden hives worked by "industrious Bees."11 Bees were also notable in graphic satire for their ability to defend their hives. When in one print Napoleon threatens to steal "Threadneedle Street Honey" and "Country Honey" from hives resting on a bench inscribed "English Constitution," Farmer George (George in) says; "Sting Sting the Viper to the Heart my good Bees let Buz Buz be the word in the Island." And Napoleon exclaims, "Curse those Bees they sting like Scorpions I did not think this Nation of Shopkeepers could have stung so sharp" (bm 10079). Cruikshank, writing in i860 about the invasion threat of 1803, recalls the same image. "Great Britain at this time might well be compared to the state of a beehive when its inmates have been disturbed by accident or an intruder" (Pop-Gun). The British Bee Hive (Fig. 1) merges all these images of a moderate industrious polity into a whole at once hierarchical and consensual, abstract and organic, constitutional and commercial. Its foundation is now not the Commons, and not the bayonets and swords of a repressive military, but rather the Army, the Royal Navy, the</page><page sequence="29">George's hive 65 Mercantile Marine, and the Volunteers, of which Cruikshank was a proud Lieutenant Colonel in the 1850s and 1860s, when the design was altered and etched. Their cannons are turned, not inward to prop a teetering pyramid, but outward, to defend "Threadneedle Street Honey" against "any wasps that might attempt to take possession of our Hive (Bee Hive 1). The Bank of England, once pilloried by Hone and Cruikshank for cruelly punitive laws against even inadvertent fraud, is now celebrated as the "Bank of the Richest Country in the World." In the conjunction of the military and the Bank, Cruikshank perhaps unwittingly, though with Marxist prescience, figures the market imperialism of Victorian and Edwardian England. The bottom three rows of honeycomb cells, arched and colon naded like a cast-iron frame warehouse, illustrate individual trades, rising from lower-class laborers (cabman, ostler, pavior, and the like) to artisans (such as tailor, bootmaker, hatter) on to citizens of the "Nation of Shopkeepers" (butcher, baker, greengrocer, and so on). Significantly, though Cruikshank does not call attention to this hobbyhorse in his accompanying letterpress, no pubkeepers or pawnbrokers, brewers or distillers, are represented in this temper ance hive, distributed by the most prominent of temperance pub lishers, W. Tweedie. This cellular division of labor into trades retains the favorabale connotations of the hive analogy, and includes something of the fascination with vocational variety shown in Cruikshank's frequent studies of coalheavers, dustmen, chimney sweeps, watchmen, and servants?subjects Henry Mayhew investigated in his pioneering sociological study, London Labour and the London Poor. The colon naded cells, using an image both organic and industrial, also illus trate the division of labor Marx, Ruskin, and Durkheim deplored as a primary feature of industrial capitalism. The next two rows of cells figure labor in Carlylean terms, as that characteristic physical, mental, and spiritual activity portrayed by Ford Madox Brown in his famous painting Work (1850). Indus try is depicted by work for men and boys, girls and women; it is associated with inventions and mechanics (which make more, rather than less, work in this anti-Luddite interpretation of indus trialism), and with agriculture, which prospers under free trade- a more pointed reference in 1840, perhaps, than in 1867. Brain work occupies the next row: schools and colleges, literature and art,</page><page sequence="30">66 BROWNING INSTITUTE STUDIES medicine and chemistry. In the center is an "Honest and Independ ent Free Press" ; its location allows the inference that it supports and is reciprocally illuminated by religious tolerance and in turn fosters "Agriculture and Free Trade." Above the press, a row of cells depicts legal and religious princi ples that both undergird the British Constitution immediately overhead and guarantee the liberties of the institutions and people below: "Trial by Jury," "Law &amp; Equity," "Freedom to All Religi ous Denominations." The Constitution is still emblemized by a column, the "Pillar of the State," bannered Lords, Queen, and Commons, but the essence of Parliament now seems to be debate, as a peer addresses the Lords and an mp orates in the Commons, while the Lord Chancellor and the Speaker preside over their re spective Houses, insuring order. For Cruikshank, warning his "Fellow Countrymen" against further Parliamentary Reform, the essence of all government is hivelike "co-operation" whether be tween labor and capital or between Ministers and people. He argues that "the people, in one sense, govern the country; for the mem bers of the commons are returned by a portion of the people, representing the nation, and acting, as it were, for the interests of the whole." Writing in 1867 as a "tory-whig-liberal-conser vative," Cruikshank does not endorse "the extreme measures of Reform" then being proposed, on the grounds that universal suf frage would lead to widespread electoral bribery and "Mob Law" (Bee Hive 1-2). The essentially conservative nature of Cruikshank's policies by the 1860s, which in effect have not changed since they were moderately liberal ideas in the 1820s, is both concealed and revealed by a cellular and hierarchical structure of class and function that emblemizes representative rather than fully participatory democracy. The harmony of this hive derives from each worker's knowing his or her place in the system: no turning government upside down and topsy-turvy here. The crown of this hive is the Queen. The sex of the reigning monarch consorts happily with Cruikshank's metaphor, which replaces the phallic paternalism of pyramid and pillar with the female fecundity of a many-celled hive. But it is not simply the Widow at Windsor, nor a monarch as God's vicar dispensing His laws, who presides over the State; nor is it the statue of Liberty atop Jack's Political House.12 Rather, it has become the principle of "Royal Family by Lineal Descent," so that - "fortunately," as</page><page sequence="31">George's hive 67 Cruikshank thinks - "there is no election needed, " since campaign ing for a crown might throw the country into great confusion and engender serious animosity. A hereditary, unelected sovereign stands against regicidal republicanism and universal suffrage; it legitimizes and stabilizes a constitutional monarchy. Above the hive the Royal Standard and the Union Jack wave bravely, while foliage that may signify the three kingdoms ? Scots thistles, English roses, and Irish bog oaks? - bedecks the whole. With its cap of flags and foliage and crown (so different from that earlier foreign - and, even worse, French - Phrygian bonnet) the hive may even suggest that quintessential English ideal, a rose covered cottage, the castle that is every Englishman's constitution ally protected home. Pyramid, column, temple, arch, and hive-none of these expres ses very complex or sophisticated theories of government, and Cruikshank's letterpress accompanying The British Bee Hive reveals how simplistic his political notions are. Nevertheless, the images he employs in his graphic satires are among the most widely recog nized emblems for the British Constitution in the nineteenth cen tury. They bounce back and forth among the prints and pamphlets of the period, as artists and writers pile figure upon figure, rearrang ing symbols to express different conceptions of hierarchy and au thority, and substituting, subverting, and transposing the signifi cance of these emblems. The vocabulary of caricature has no stable center even though an emblem such as The British Bee Hive seems to twentieth-century eyes to capture the essence of the Victorian social contract. Cruik shank's picture masses a heterogeneous collection of formal (arch, column, layer), sociological (occupation and class), and symbolic (Royal Standard, Union Jack, botanical emblems) images, making them stand for a rather heterogeneous collection of ideas about the State. This massing of potentially incompatible topoi often charac terizes demotic patriotism. Mr. Bounderby, the fraudulently self made banker in Dickens's Hard Times, projects his "moral infection of clap-trap" in a similar way upon his supporters: "They made him out to be the Royal Arms, the Union-Jack, Magna Charta, John Bull, Habeas Corpus, the Bill of Rights, An Englishman's house is his castle, Church and State, and God save the Queen, all put together" (43). The very absence of any one object or document containing</page><page sequence="32">68 BROWNING institute studies England's unwritten Constitution provided an opportunity for political propagandists and artists to devise their own emblems of the State. These emblems were palimpsests inventively superim posing new conceptions on old forms and raiding the past to define and shape the present. Thus Cruikshank's Bee Hive incompletely erases the lines of Georgian pyramid, column, temple, and arch, providing an image whose underthemes inconsistently and even contradictorily express Augustan, Georgian, and Victorian ideas. Embodied in the representations as well as in the organizations and rituals of Victorian England are the messy - and, because messy, "socially binding" - narratives that call on "a vast cultural reser voir," as Thomas Laqueur puts it, to subvert radicalism and stabilize the kingdom (Laqueur 466; Cannadine). Popular art does not provide simple, unambiguous statements. Indeed, the simpler the images (pyramid, arch, hive), the more complex may be the significations imposed upon them. Their very popularity depends on the multiplicity and ambivalence of their resonances, their supplementation, rather than erasure, of previous emblems. The Georgian hinge in some ways marks a fulcrum for English radicalism and constitutional debate, and its teetering pyramids can still be found subliminally unbalancing George's hive, that characteristic figure of Victorian stability.
