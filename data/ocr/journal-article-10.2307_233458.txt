DM 128. In 1488 Johann Lichtenberger, astrologer to Emperor Frederick III, predicted that the "stiff-necked people without a head" (i.e., the Swiss) would be subjected to the Empire and that a terrible flood would waste the land. Lichtenberger's Prognosti- cation went through more than fifty full editions, its claims supported by a bumper harvest of authorities ranging from the Bible, the church fathers, ancient Greek</page><page sequence="2">570 BOOK REVIEWS-ISIS, 81: 3: 308 (1990) philosophers and astrologers, and the Sib- ylline prophecies to the influential medieval prophecies of Joachim of Fiore. The peas- ants in his parish kept a respectable dis- tance, fearing that the black raven seated on his desk was an evil demon. The simple folk, however, were not alone in bestow- ing authority upon prognosticators. The learned also took forecasts seriously, al- though, as befit their social station, they spent as much time disputing about the au- thority to make predictions (see, e.g., Au- gustus Pighius, A Defense of Astrology against the Prognosticators, 1519) as they spent generating formal arguments about the status of celestial causality. The Wit- tenberg reformer Martin Luther attributed startling events and universal catastrophes directly to God's will rather than to the stars, and in March 1524 he wrote to the Elector Frederick's secretary Georg Spala- tin of "astrologers who had been deluded (hallucinati) that year into announcing or denying the imminent end of the world due to a flood brought on by the conjunction of the three upper planets in the sign of Pi- sces." What to make of such dire forecasts, intrepid forecasters, and their critics? In May 1984 the distinguished Renais- sance cultural historian Paola Zambelli gathered together a group of eminent scholars at the Berlin Wissenschaftskolleg to probe the vast outpouring of pamphlets that had predicted a great flood in 1524 and signaled the end of the world. This was not a gathering of historians of science, strictly speaking, although I think that many readers of Isis will appreciate John North's lengthy and valuable history of the concep- tual links forged by medievals between ter- restrial effects and celestial "in-flowing" or influentia (he notes, by the way, that he will have nothing to say about influenza!). Zambelli provides a suggestive and wide- ranging introduction in which she dissoci- ates herself from an approach that would excise the "scientific" kernel from an es- sentially political-religious debate. Inter- nalist-conceptualist surgery, in her view, confuses ends and means. Heavenly fore- casting was not an end in itself. The pam- phleteers often manipulated respectable naturalist theories of astral influence and planetary prediction for propagandistic purposes, regarding the heavens much as we would a "giant computer deaf to human prayers and quite distinct from the personal or anthropomorphic Deity of the Old and New Testaments" (p. 21). This uneven but important collection of studies, then, not only concerns the background and circum- stances of a predicted catastrophe but also aims to contribute to an understanding of Reformation propaganda strategies and technologies. The contributors pursue their assign- ments with quite different methods and in varied genres. Some write in the "[Great Thinker] and Astrology" mode, exploring the views of particular individuals on the status of astral divination. With patience, the reader can dig up bits of useful insight in the articles on such figures as Philipp Melanchthon (Stefano Caroti), Luther (Ingetraut Ludolphy), Spalatin (Irmgard H6ss), Lichtenberger (Dietrich Kurze), Jo- hann Virdung of Hassfurt (Max Steinmetz), and the little-known Abb6 Jean Th6naud, author of a French treatise on the Cabala written at the request of Francis I (Anne- Marie Lecoq). Caroti, for example, shows clearly how Melanchthon (unlike Luther) regarded the stars as signifying mediators of divine will, astral forewarnings as a means of strengthening piety and faith, and astrology as part of physics. Other articles are more broadly ambitious. In her reward- ing study, Zambelli brings together an abundance of new and old archival mate- rials to establish the role of Luca Guarico as initiator of the flood propaganda in Italy and Germany. Krzystof Pomian argues that astrology, like Christian theology, provided an intelligibility to history outside the human realm; yet, unlike theology, it sought this understanding in the visible mo- tions of the celestial bodies. While sugges- tive, Pomian's analysis suffers from the ab- sence of actor's categories. Hans-Joachim Kohler derives some very interesting con- clusions from a quantitative approach to the pamphlet literature. He graphs vari- ables such as the chronology and geogra- phy (by city) of pamphlet production, sub- ject areas treated, and the incidence of spe- cific themes (e.g., religious instruction, reproach of heresy, papal primacy). While he does not always explain his categories carefully (e.g., how should we understand the claim that 48 percent of the pamphlet texts are written in "discursive lan- guage"?), his study shows both the assets and liabilities of applying computers and recent communication theory to the era of</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS-ISIS, 81: 3: 308 (1990) 571 early typography. Helga Robinson Ham- merstein offers a very thoughtful analysis of the practica literature. Practicae were short astrological productions that com- bined woodcut (usually anthropomorphic representations of the planets) with text (usually long-term weather prospects, epi- demics) and claimed by virtue of their rule- bound procedures a kind of scientific au- thenticity for their predictions. When combined with Lichtenberger's Joachimist prophecies, the practicae became instru- ments of political agitation, platforms for Empire reform, resources of consolation (e.g., "crosses that recently fell from heaven" into people's clothing signify God's intention to save men from all "af- fliction, anxiety and desolation" [p. 135]). I would suggest that the practicae, with their mix of authorities-mathematical and judi- cial astrology, scriptural and Joachimist prophecy, together with the "new" re- formed preachers of the Word-already in some measure prefigured later negotiations between a "new" science and various forms of orthodox and heterodox religious authority. Some useful moves in this direc- tion can be found in Germana Ernst's inter- esting essay, "From the Watery Trigon to the Fiery Trigon: Celestial Signs, Prophe- cies, and History." For all that has been said, however, this is not a book for the faint of heart. The edi- tor characterizes her role toward her con- tributors as "most respectful"; one wishes that she had been as respectful toward her readers. Many of these essays are unneces- sarily difficult to read. Authors frequently cite sources in the original Latin, German, French, or Italian; on almost every page spelling and typographical errors abound; with the exception of North's essay, the writing is often cumbersome and presumes considerable background knowledge; for reasons unexplained, two essays appear in German (Ludolphy, Steinmetz) and one in French (Lecoq). Nonspecialists would be well advised to prepare by reading Lynn Thorndike's "The Conjunction of 1524" (A History of Magic and Experimental Sci- ence, Vol. V [New York: Columbia, 1941], pp. 178-233) and Eugenio Garin's Astrol- ogy in the Renaissance (trans. Carolyn Jackson, June Allen, and Clare Robinson [London/Boston: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1983]). ROBERT S. WESTMAN</page></plain_text>
