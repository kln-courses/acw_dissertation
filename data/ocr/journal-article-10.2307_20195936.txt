Chi cago: American Library Associa tion, 1966. Pp. 119. $2.00. Books For Children, is a compre hensive, annotated listing of selected books published September through August of the year 1965-1966. It is the first of what will apparently be come an annual issue of the reviews of children's books appearing in the ALA semi-monthly book reviewing periodical, The Booklist and Sub scription Books Bulletin. It supple ments a five-year compilation appear ing under the same title for the years 1960-1965. Entries are arranged by subject according to a modified Dewey Deci mal classification. An index by sub ject, title, and author is cross-refer enced to the annotated entries. Each entry includes needed ordering in formation including price. Book selection and annotations were done by Helen E. Kinsey and other members of the Booklist staff. Children's librarians in schools and public libraries throughout the coun try recommended books for review. The basis for selection, in addition to the usual criteria of literary quality, accuracy, appropriate design and for mat, included appeal to children and usefulness in libraries. Approximate ly half of the 770 entries fall in the fiction, biography, and easy books categories. The balance are informa tional and cover an exceedingly wide range of topics as befits a buying guide for teachers and librarians. The annotations present capsule summaries of the plots or content. Unique features and outstanding qualities are noted. Comparisons with other books on the same subject or by the same author are of very prac tical assistance to the well-read shopper. EAKiN, Mary K. (Ed.) Good books for children. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1966. Pp. 407. $7.95 (Paper, $2.95). Fifteen years of publication are covered in these reviews of approxi mately 1,400 children's books se lected as outstanding for the years 1950-1965. The selections and anno tations have been culled from the Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books, a monthly publication of the Graduate Library School of the Uni versity of Chicago. Selection of titles for inclusion in the Bulletin gives consideration to literary quality, quality of content, suitability of style and subject matter for the age reader for whom the book is intended and physical format. Good Books for Chil dren is a compilation of the annual listing of the one hundred best books reviewed in the Bulletin. This is the third edition. Of value to anyone faced with the task of selecting books for children in general or one child in particular are the highly readable and very in formative annotations. They are of sufficient length to give the reader an adequate sense of the content, which is in itself a quality some what unusual in reviews of children's books. In addition, those character istics which make the selected book noteworthy are described. Weak nesses are noted as well as factors making for limited appeal to a spe cific audience. Entries in the main body are in alphabetical order by author. A sub ject and title index cross-referenced in the main body enhances the value of this book as an aid in locating quality material on particular topics. Suggested age-grade reader lev els are shown. The editor defines these as maturity levels, a combina tion of difficulty level and subject interest. The editor presents strong argu ments for careful selection of books to be made available to children. Left to their own devices, children 377</page><page sequence="2">Interesting books 379 do not select only the best in a col lection that ranges from poor and mediocre to best. Adult time and the personnel to assist children in mak ing selections is severely limited in most schools and libraries. In addi tion, the demands on children's time is such that the precious little time which is left for reading must be limited to books of good quality if these books are to be encountered at all. Her contention that teachers and librarians are encouraging the mass production and consumption of in ferior books each time that they stock shelves with anything less than the best is valid. Research indicates that children and adults tend to read what is available. Good Books For Children simplifies the task of mak ing the best available. FENWiCK, Sara iNNis (Ed.) A critical approach to children's literature. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1967. Pp. 129. The quality and diversity of pro fessional views presented at the 31st Annual Conference of the University of Chicago Graduate Library School is immediately evident in this com pilation of papers. The conference focus on the critical evaluation and interpretation of children's literature brought together outstanding schol ars, researchers, and authors from several fields. Edward W. Rosenheim, Jr., Pro fessor at the University of Chicago and author of What Happens in Lit erature, examines the characteristics of literary criticism and their appli cation to books for children. Eliza beth Nesbitt, co-author of A Critical History of Children's Literature, ar gues for the development of the fine art of literary criticism and practi tioners of this fine art as it applies to materials for children. Zena Suther land, editor of The Bulletin of The Center for Children's Books, surveys current practices and publications in book reviewing with an eye to the need of the consumer for ready ac cess to critical reviews. An occupa tional therapist, Katherine H. Kap pas, presents a developmental theory of the formation of a sense of humor and then applies this theory in the critical evaluation of books. Millicent Selsam, herself the au thor of thirty-seven science books, describes the qualities essential for the production of good science books for children. Luitgard Wundheiler, German-born teacher, therapist, and essayist, looks at the literature deal ing with nature and science in terms of its psychological basis. Jacquelyn Sanders, graduate fel low at U.C.L.A., explores the psycho logical significance of children's lit erature. The sociological aspects of literature for "children without" is investigated by Marion Edman, Pro fessor at Wayne State University with wide experience as librarian and lecturer. Emily Neville, author of the Newberry Award winner, It's Like This, Cat, starting with a defini tion of social values as the "strug gles, for good or evil, of peoples in groups" outlines the difficulties which an author faces in writing with in tegrity and effectiveness of today's social issues. Doris Young, educator and author, raises numerous ques tions relative to a current study and evaluation of children's responses to their reading materials. Two of the most provocative arti cles are by David McCord and H. Joseph Schwartz. David McCord, as befits the author of Take Sky, Far and Few, and All Day Long, never describes with prose what verse will do more pungently. His paper on poetry for children confirms any prejudices one may have in this direction. Schwartz, of Teachers College in Oranim, Israel, analyzes what he sees as a major trend, the personified anthropomorphic machine as the hero of stories. His viewpoint as to the values to the child of this kind of reading is evident in his conclud ing statement: "What the child needs to be taught by his books ... is re spect for life and meaningful rela tionships with living human beings, of whom he is one." MARSHALL, SHIRLEY E. (Ed.) A young American's treasury of English poetry. New York: Washington Square Press, 1967. Pp. 264. $4.95. Selected works of major English poets have been arranged in seven (Continued on Page 385)</page><page sequence="3">Interesting books (Continued from Page 379) chronological categories, ranging from the early middle ages to the 20th century. The selections range from the "Charm: Against a Swarm of Bees" as translated from Old Eng lish by Richard Hoffman to Yeats "Song of Wandering Aengus." The editors selection of poetry as well as her decision to leave intact the Middle English of the later Me dieval verse and the archaic spellings and punctuation of later poets serve well her intent to present the au thentic flavor of each period. The historical background of each era is summarized in a chart which lists personages, events, major social and intellectual advances. Unfortunately the entire chart is presented in one section at the back of the book which necessitates much flipping of pages back and forth if the reader is to place specific poems in their proper historical framework. This anthology was prepared with the junior high and secondary stu dent in mind. The range, variety, and sophistication of the selections plus an attractive and very readable format all contributed to its appeal.</page></plain_text>
