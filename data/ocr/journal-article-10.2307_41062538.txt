La parafrasi biblica come forma di espressione teologica (Studia Ephemeridis Augustinianum 113). Rome: Institutum Patristicum Augustinianum 2009, 260 pp, ISBN 88-7961-122-4. Between 435 and 450 Claudius Marius Victorius wrote his biblical epic Alethia, which paraphrases Genesis from the beginning ad obitum patri- ar xhae Abrahae, as Gennadius states in his De viris illustribus 60. However, the extant text stops at the destruction of Sodom (19.26) and not at 25.8. This gives rise to the assumption that the last part has gone lost. In 1886 Schenkl edited the text in CSEL 16. An improved edition was published in 1960 by RE Hovingh in CCSL 128. Recently Simona Papini published a helpful Italian translation with introduction and notes in the series 'Collana di testi patristici' (Rome 2006). Although the Alethia has not been neglected by scholars, a new thorough analysis was a desideratum. Such an exercise requires a multifarious competence: for instance familiar- ity with the traditions of Latin hexametric poetry in general and its Chris- tian specimens in particular, knowledge of the various strategies of biblical hermeneutics, feeling for the underlying doctrinal position of a particular author. Cutino first deals extensively with the long introductory Precatio of 1 26 verses, comparing it with Carmen IV of Tiberianus and Ausonius' Oratio matutina (II 3 in Green's edition), and delineating its theological position and above all its Valore programmatico' (25) for the entire work. Its title characterizes the epic as anti-pagan, 'quasi come un contraltare dell' 'AÀr|0r|ç Aoyoç di Celso' (54), and also as imitating Prudentius' use of Greek titles. This was, of course, not a novelty in Latin literature; see K.-E. Henriksson, Griechische Büchertitel in der römischen Literatur. Helsinki 1956. As to the poet's theological position, C. defends the view that he aimed to reconcile the Provençale and the Augustinian theological positions in the post-Pelagian era. This might well be an interesting contri- bution to the renewed scholarly discussions about this matter. © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 201 1 DOI: 10.1 163/157007210X530261</page><page sequence="2">100 Reviews I Vigiliae Christianae 65 (2011) 99-109 C. devotes the second and third part of his study to the three books of the Alethia. His analyses often have the character of a running commen- tary on the text, with full quotations and translations of the relevant pas- sages, a strategy which is quite helpful. A handful of examples may give an impression of his expert comments. The poets paraphrase is 'rispettosa dell' ipotesto biblico' (107), but he has to quaedam praestringere, quaedam penitus transmitiere, 'to abbreviate some elements, to entirely leave out others' (I 144-145); see Quint. Inst. I 9.2. A remarkable omission is Gen. 3.8, 'God walking in the garden', as perhaps too anthropomorphic (124). The cultural and technical progress of humanity is not the result of human experience or skill; ego nosse creatis I quae bona sunt cum luce dedi (2.181-182), says God. Man is inclined to ascribe his increasing knowl- edge to his own application artisque putatur I quod manet ingenitum, 'and to human skill (artis) is ascribed what in fact is inborn (ingenitum ([2.192- 193])'. As C. notes, this 'teoria della conoscenza innata (154) is the polem- ical opposite of Book 5 of Lucretius' De rerum natura. One is also reminded of Augustine's De doctrina christiana 2.41 and 50. As could be expected, the Aeneid is an important model for the poet. A small example is the imitation of Aen. 8.18-25 in 2.257-269, rightly inter- preted as a case of aemulatio by C. More spectacular is 3.326-762, the 'aristia del pio Abramo' (185), a most instructive case of the 'epicizzazione della materia biblica (185), in which the biblical hero is modelled on Vergil's pius Aeneas. This has something to do with the poet's announce- ment in the prooemium of Book 2: Nunc hominum mores et iam mortalia versu I ingressum fas sit veris miscere poetam (2.4-5). C. deals more than once with these verses, emphasizing that the poet does not aim at mixing truth and lies, but wants to 'ravvivare l'esposizione poetica (143). C. interprets poetam in vs 5 as an metonymy ('l'attitudine propria del poeta), which is the grammatical object of miscere. Pasini's rendering, in which poetam is regarded as subject of miscere ('a poet' or 'I as a poet') seems more natural and forms no obstacle for C.'s persuasive explanations. All those who take a serious interest in late antique biblical epic poetry should study this book with great care, in order to benefit from Michele Cutino's all-round expertise and didactic skill.
