<plain_text><page sequence="1">Georg Uschmann* HAECKEL'S BIOLOGICAL MATERIALISM In June 1859, Ernst Haeckel spent a week in Ischia. He made this excursion together with the poet Hermann Allmers. In their letters both praised the beauties of the island, and Allmers has recorded the first impressions in a poem: « But sunrise came and beaming from the rays Mount Epomeo's summit stood in glare, and we beheld the island bright and fair and saw that Ischia exceeds its praise ». Haeckel's main occupation on the island was botanizing, although by this time the actual purpose of the travelling had a little receded into the background. On the advice of the anatomist Carl Gegenbaur, Haeckel had gone to Italy for studies in oceanic zoology. He stayed in Naples for about five months, but without attaining any notable success. Haeckel's enthusiasm for marine zoology was aroused when he was in Helgoland with Johannes M uller in 1854 and in Nice in the company of Muller and Kolliker in 1857 and he learned much from the two scholars. Now, in Naples, obliged to rely upon himself he confessed: «The scope of our work is so immensely large, the bulk of matter so overwhelming that even an expert would find it hard to orientate himself. And although I have, then, learned exceedingly much from those excellent teachers, many large gaps have remained, and I often find myself standing rather helpless before * Archiv fur Geschicthe der Naturforschung und Medizin, August-Bebel-Strasse 50a, DDR-401 Halle.</page><page sequence="2">102 G. USCHMANN an object I do not sufficiently know, thus being forced to make lengthy, toilsome investigations by indirection in order to get an answer about what formerly had been clarified by simply asking the teachers». Considering these failures and, last but not least, under the influence of Allmers, Haeckel at that time dallied transiently with the idea of abandoning the career of a scientist and becoming a landscape painter. Not until the winter of 1859/60 did he fall upon radiolaria as a rewarding subject of research, with which he referred to the last great work of Johannes MiiiiER, dating from 1858. The discovery of 144 unknown species of radiolaria became his first persistently stimulating success. At the same time, subjects and methods of all Haeckel's future zoological research were found. The subjects were oceanic invertebrates confined to radiolaria, medusae, echino derms, and sponges. The methods consisted in micro- or macro scopical investigations, the results of which conduced to morphological and taxonomic conclusions. It was only on occasion that Haeckel attempted to proceed experimentally, and he got stuck at the very outset. Thus, it is quite understandable that his more comprehensive inferences concerning biological theory - also in the field of the Theory of Evolution - as well as his philosophical excursions often have a speculative character. But it is to be noted that, in spite of an often only narrow or even missing empirical basis, in principle he succeeded in grasping, intuitively, the essential of matters. In order to understand the work of Haeckel it is necessary to trace his scientific background. Determinant influences upon his later career as a naturalist can already be found in his school-days (1840-52). During these years the young Haeckel spent much time on drawing and painting. In addition, he occupied himself in his spare time with the gathering and classifying of plants. For this he had without doubt a special talent and inclination, which also in later years showed up time after time. Along with that he was an enthu siastic reader of travels as well as of works delineating comprehensive subjects in an impressive manner, as is the case with Schleiden («Die Pflanze und ihr Leben») and Alexander von Humboldt («Kosmos»). But, during his school-days he also took a certain interest in the animal world. Haeckel attentively studied Poeppig's «Illustrirte Naturgeschichte des Thierreichs» (1847), coloured the</page><page sequence="3">Haeckel's biological materialism 103 illustrations, and used the pictures to compose, in 1850, a «National Assembly of the Birds » (« Nationalversammlung der Vogel»), which showed, in a picturesque grouping, a representative of each family. It was then that Haeckel's vocational aspiration emerged. He wanted to study botany in order to become successful as an explorer by making discoveries and writing travels as did his great predecessors. That, at his parents' desire, he studied medicine has, in principle, changed nothing in what he had hoped to achieve, except the field of research: the place of botany was taken by zoology. There are certain striking parallels with the scientific background of Lamarck. Also Lamarck first occupied himself with systematic botany and then passed, after the « Musee d'histoire naturelle » had been founded, over to zoology, working, however, also in this field as a systematist. Haeckel as well as Lamarck was able to realize forms quickly and truly, a faculty which might be called the " morphological eye As zoologists they expounded, in huge volumes, systematics in the area of the invertebrates. Lamarck's « Histoire naturelle des animaux sans vertebres» may be compared with the voluminous monographs of Haeckel. Both of them had an inclination to artistic activities, Haeckel as a painter, Lamarck as a musician. They both, within a relatively short space of time, settled upon the idea of evolution, applying it to the whole realm of organisms including man, and being forced, for want of research findings, to explain evolutionary factors by speculation. This relates, e.g., to the problem of the so called spontaneous generation, through which both explain the evolution of certain recent lower organisms, and which Haeckel, as late as 1866, considers to be « possible and probable ». He regarded the experiments of « Pasteur and his companions » to be inconclusive for a refutation because they had been made « on artificial and therefore unnatural conditions ». Both of them take as a basis for their genea logical tables the system of the recent organisms. General conformities also become apparent in the fact that Lamarck as well as Haeckel discussed the problem of evolution under religious and philosophical aspects. According to Lamarck, God created only matter and the natural laws, and thereafter no longer interfered with them. Haeckel rejects the anthropomorphic concept of God, opposing it with his " monism At an advanced age both scholars published the principle</page><page sequence="4">104 G. USCHMANN features of their respective philosophies of life. Lamarck wrote a « Systeme analytique des connaissances positives de l'homme » (1820), and Haeckel « Die Weltrathsel» (1899). The difference between these and the conception of Darwin is evident. Whereas Haeckel was an ardent admirer of Lamarck and, in particular, adopted his thesis of the acquisition of acquired qualities, Darwin wrote to Hooker, in 1844: «Heaven forfend me from Lamarck's nonsense of a ' tendency of progression ', ' adaptations from the slow willing of animals, etc.! '». This critical attitude of Darwin towards Lamarck is obvious also in other passages. Haeckel received his training as a botanist and zoologist prior to 1859, i.e. in the pre-phylogenetic epoch. His own investigations in oceanic zoology were carried out chiefly with the method of MtiLLER. He considered stations for oceanic zoology to be superfluous, and after the rupture with Anton Dohrn he repeatedly polemized against the Zoological Station in Naples, even when its importance was long recognized. Only in old age (in 1916) did he call the Station, surprisingly, « one of the primary model institutions of this kind » and Dohrn his « most respectable and successful disciple ». The role of Haeckel in the formation of biological theory did not take shape prior to being influenced by Darwin, to whom he pro fessed himself loyal in 1860, spontaneously, after having read « On the Origin of Species». He repeated this profession in his monograph on radiolaria, in 1862, and in greater detail in 1863, in a paper read to a conference of the Society of German Scientists and Physicians held in Stettin. Even at that time Haeckel was endeavouring to com plete the theory of Darwin in its essential points. At the very outset of the Stettin paper he characterizes Darwinism as a «knowledge modifying the whole outlook on hfe », concerning also man, whose ancestors, consequently, should be sought «among ape-like mam malia, further among kangaroo-like marsupials» down to fish of low organization. The whole natural system of plants and animals is defined by Haeckel as a family-tree, and with the conclusion that « no species, not even excepting the first one » has been created inde pendent, he exceeds Darwin, who even in the later editions of his « Origin of Species», sticks to the conception that the creator has breathed the germ of all hfe « only into a few forms or into a single</page><page sequence="5">Haeckel's biological materialism 105 one». In the same year Haeckel pointed out the importance of Lamarck who, as early as 1809, with his excellent «Zoologie philoso phique » published a « well-thought out theory of the origination of the species of plants and animals through the gradual modification of some few, spontaneously originated, primitive forms». This theory, however, could not prevail against the «thought of Cuvier ». Lastly Haeckel stressed the importance of inheritance, which is subject to the general law of variability: the characteristics of an individual are handed down to the offspring only in part unchanged, in part more or less changed, and «to some extent the particular characteristics are acquired by the individuals only during their life, through adaptation to the external conditions, and especially through the reciprocal relation of every organism to all the other organisms surrounding it». Virtually, these sentences already imply the essential of what Haeckel, in his later comments on problems of the theory of evolution, expounds in detail. This is the case of the « Generelle Morphologie » of 1866, which already comprised (rudimentarily at least) all the characteristics of numerous other relevant treatises of Haeckel. In 1866 Haeckel coined a number of terms among which,' Onto genie' and ' Phylogenie'. At that time, he understood ontogenesis to be «no more than a short recapitulation of phylogenesis», a causality for which he coins, in 1872, the term ' Biogenetisches Grundgesetz' (the basic law of biogeny). According to this, onto genesis and phylogenesis condition morphogenesis. Ontogenesis, he says, must not be qualified as embryology because, strictly speaking, an embryo is only the « organism within the cauls». Therefore, the term embryology has to be restricted to the « science of the embryonal evolution», whereas the post-embryonal evolution is a meta morphology. The problem of the generatio spontanea is discussed in detail. For Haeckel the parentless generation in an «inorganic» formative liquid is an autogony or that mode of the generatio spontanea « with which, at any a time, organic life on the formerly inanimate crust of the earth must have necessarily begun ». But according to Haeckel there is yet another kind of parentless generation, the plasmogony, or plasmatic generation, through which the most simple organic beings originate in an « organic » formative liquid. This process which rep</page><page sequence="6">106 G. USCHMANN resents another mode of the generatio spontanea has, of course, not yet been observed with certainty,« but it is possible, and even probable, that it is, even now, still existing ». The difference between the various eventualities of inheritance, which Haeckel had already stated in 1863, was at that point examined in detail. He formulates a number of «laws» for conservative and progressive inheritance. Ultimately, the infinitely multivarious dif ferences of all organisms are conditioned by the physiological functions of inheritance and adaptation in their continuous antagonism. Basically, Haeckel considered the inheritable characters to be effects of the material composition of the albuminous compounds, whereas the adapted characters, according to him, are the result of the interaction between the albuminous compounds of the plastic of the organism and the matters of the environment coming into contact with them. Haeckel also attempted to localize the process of inhe ritance. In organisms without a nucleus the functions of heritability and adaptation did not at that time seem to be apportioned to different substances but inhered in the entire homogeneous matter of the plasm. However in nucleated cells they are allotted in such a way «that the internal nucleus has to perform the transmission of the in heritable characters, the external plasm, on the other hand, to the accomodation or adaptation of the organism to the conditions of the outer world». This conception is particularly supported by the important part the nucleus plays in cellular reproduction. According to Haeckel, the laws of inheritance and adaptation determine also the duration of the phylogenetic evolution of every group in the system, this duration being merely the result of the antagonism of these two physiological factors. As in earlier writings, man is represented in the «Generelle Morphologie» as the product of an evolutionary process. He is distinguished from the other animals only by quantitative, not by qualitative differences. Anthropology is nothing but a particular branch of zoology. In the last chapter of the « Generelle Morphologie » Haeckel speaks of the « unity of nature and the unity of science » and explains his «system of monism ». According to this matter and that which is inseparable from it, the aggregate powers of the world, are unlimited, eternal, and infinite in time and space. Their form,</page><page sequence="7">Haeckel's biological materialism 107 however, is in a state of eternal and infinite change (motion). The idea of the « absolute unity of nature » is to be regarded as the fun damental idea of a « general morphology of the organisms »: there is only one and the same almighty and unalterable law of causa tion ruling the world of nature without exception, the inorganic as well as the organic world. «All human science is knowledge founded on experience, it is empirical philosophy or ... philosophical empiricism». Haeckel concludes this chapter with the proposition: « Every real natural science is philosophy and every real philosophy is natural science. Every real science, however, is natural philosophy ». The monistic view of nature categorically rejects the prevailing dualistic idea of a personal creator and of «creation». This monism, says Haeckel, has been decried from many sides as atheism and mate rialism. But the reproach of materialism is, as already noted by Schleicher, «likewise unfounded as to accuse him of spiritualism », because monism knows neither matter without spirit, which is spoken of as materialism, nor spirit without matter, which is assumed by spiritualism. To monism there is neither spirit nor matter in che usual acceptance of the words, but only a something which is the one and the other at the same time. Haeckel's reference to the linguist August Schleicher (1821-68) is important. It was Haeckel who drew Schleicher's attention to the theory of Darwin. The response of Schleicher ensued in 1863, in a small book with the title « Die Darwinische Theorie und die Sprachwissenschaft», published as an «open missive» to Haeckel. In this book Schleicher pointed out that, independently of Darwin, already in 1860 he had expressed, in his work « Die deutsche Sprache », opinions of the « organism of language » similar to those of Darwin concerning the evolution of animals. The reference, in general, to the importance of biogenesis he owed to the book of Schleiden, «Die Botanik als induktive Wissenschaft», and to the «Physiolo gische Briefe » of Carl Vogt. Schleicher holds that languages are natural organisms evolving like plants and animals and this difference can be taken to form the basis of a natural system of the genus homo. Independently of Haeckel and other scientists, also Schleicher in 1863 pointed out that Darwin's assumption of an act of creation for the first primordial organisms was the rather inconsequential</page><page sequence="8">108 G. USCHMANN concession to the known «narrow-mindedness of his fellowcoun trymen in matters of faith». The judgement of Schleicher on Darwin's « Origin of Species» is interesting: «... it appears to me, (that it) is in perfect harmony with those fundamental notions of philosophy which we find more or less consciously or deliberately expressed by the greater part of those who have written on natural science. I will enter into some particulars. The tendency of modern thought is undeniably towards monism. Dualism, whether you are pleased to define it as the contrast of spirit and nature, of contents and form, of appearance and reality, is no longer a firm ground to stand upon, if we wish to survey the field of modern science. To the latter there is no matter without spirit (without the unavoidable force that governs it), nor, on the other hand, any spirit without matter. We might say, perhaps, that there is neither matter nor spirit in the usual acceptation of the words, but only a something which is the one and the other at the same time. It is true we are still without a philosophical system of monism, but the history of the development of modern philosophy is clearly indicative of a struggling for it ... ». This conception of Schleicher was worked out by Haeckel, more or less in detail, in all relevant later treatises, the first of which was «The History of Creation», of 1868. There he distinguishes between the inorganic sciences and biology. Whereas in the case of the inorganic sciences it is, according to him, quite possible to speak of a scientific materialism being in a sense identical to monism, in biology the notion of a living force or even theological dogmas are still in use. Yet, as the whole of the cognizable nature forms a unity, it can be said: «In such a sense all exact science, and the law of cause and effect at its head, is purely materialistic ». In Haeckel's « Anthropogenie » (1874) we read: « Thus, according to one-sided materialism, the matter is antecedent to the living force; according to the equally one-sided view of the spiritist, it is the reverse. Both views are dualistic, and, in my opinion, both are false. For us the antithesis disappears in the monistic philosophy, which knows neither matter without force nor force without matter...». As against that, the separate treatise «Der Monismus als Band zwischen Religion und Wissenschaft» (1892) adduces no new argu</page><page sequence="9">Haeckel's biological materialism 109 ments. Haeckel insists that «animated atoms» can be assumed as an essential part of pure monism, if they are conceived of not as inanimate mass particles but as living elementary particles equipped with the force of attraction and repulsion. He gives liking and dislike or loving and hating as alternative expressions for attraction and repulsion. Referring to Heinrich Hertz (1888) who characterized light and heat, electricity and magnetism to be closely related phe nomena of a single section of forces, and traced them back to trans versal vibration of the ether, Haeckel calls these advances in the knowledge of ether «an immense benefit of monistic philosophy». Repeatedly Haeckel strives to trace the phenomena of life back to physico-chemical processes. This applies also to inheritance, which he treats in detail in the « Generelle Morphologie » (1866), professing himself loyal to Lamarckism, but still not commenting on the mechan ism of the genetic process. Only in 1876 did he set up, like Darwin with his hypothesis of pangenesis, his own theory of heredity. This appeared in « Die Perigenesis der Plastidule », which is an « attempt to explain the elementary processes of evolution in terms of mech anics ». In this book Haeckel distinguishes «cytodes» without a nucleus of the genuine nucleated cells. The cytode is the first and lower form, and the cell the second and higher form of the living unity. Both forms Haeckel subsumes under the notion of « plastids». In the cytodes a homogeneous protein-like substance, the plasson (living matter or formative substance), assumes the task of, what are in genuine cells, protoplasm and nucleus. He regrets that chemistry has not up to that time been able to give information about the quan titative composition and the chemical qualities of the plasson. The immense variability of the plasson, together with its high degree of dissolubility and with the mobility of the atoms is, according to Haeckel, of the greatest importance for the theory of evolution. That is to say, this explains «how the plasson, under the manifold physical and chemical influence of the external world which take place in the process of nutrition, can undergo an infinite number of slight modifications and so produce the most different organic forms». The sum of physical and chemical processes which, in a word we call «life », is apparently in the last resort conditioned by the molecular structure of the plasson. This structure in its turn must be traced,</page><page sequence="10">110 G. USCHMANN after the carbon theory, to the capacity of carbon to form, with the other mentioned elements, the most complicated and decomposable compounds. Modern chemistry, therefore, rightly speaks of a « che mistry of the carbon compounds». Following the example of Elsberg, Haeckel calls the plasson molecules plastidules. Every plastidule consists of atoms of carbon (52-55 %), oxygen (21-23 %), nitrogen (15-17 %), hydrogen (6-7 %), and sulphur (1-2 %). Again Haeckel insists in his view the atoms have a kind of « soul»: « Liking and dislike, appetency and aversion, attraction and repulsion must be common to all mass atoms». The movements of the atoms are explainable only if they are ascribed « sensibility and will», says Haeckel, referring to Goethe's novel« Die Wahlverwandt schaften ». Furthermore, Haeckel says that the assumption of an «atom soul » is consistent with the monistic point of view and is « as far from one-sided materialism as from vain spiritualism ». The distinction between organisms and the inorganic realm or between the plastidules and the other molecules derives from the capacity of reproduction or memory: «All plastidules have a memory, which is lacking in all other molecules ». According to Haeckel, this was proved in 1870 by Ewald Hering, who characterized memory « as a general function of organized matter». The conception of memory, however, does not refer to all organized matter, but is only a function of the actual living one, that is to say, of the plasson, not of its products. Conse quently, only the plastidule is reproductive, and its unconscious memory conditions its characteristic molecular motion. Whereas inorganic bodies grow by external accretion of molecules, growth in organisms is by intussusception or internal deposit of molecules. Coincidentally with the formation of daughter cells out of a mother cell, the molecular motion of the plastidule is transmitted. Therewith, also inheritance appears to be explainable as a consequence of the division. It is the transmission of the plastidule motion, or the propa gation of the individual molecular motion of the plastidule, to the daughter cells. The original plastidule motion in the daughter cells is partly modified by the influence of the conditions of existence, and this variation is called, by Haeckel, adaptation. Therefore, the life of every later plastid is composed, in his view, of the preponderant</page><page sequence="11">Haeckel's biological materialism 111 series of former plastidule motions which have been transmitted, and, to a lesser degree, of new motions which were acquired by adaptation. Haeckel is of the opinion that he has, in this way, transferred Lamarck's theory of the inheritance of modifications, as being a presupposition of Darwin's theory of selection, to the plastids and, from these, to their plastidules. With that he completely ignores that Darwin does not trace back the variability postulated by him as a presupposition of selection to any factors of Lamarck. As a supplementary volume to « The Riddle of the Universe » (1899), « The Wonders of Life » appeared in 1904. Also in this work Haeckel says nothing new in principle. It is interesting that he once again goes into his hypothesis on inheritance framed in «Die Peri genesis der Plastidule» (1876). He remarks: «I cannot yet see how heredity can be explained without this assumption! The very word ' reproduction', which is common to both processes, expressed the common character of psychic memory (as a function of the brain). By plastidules I understand simple molecules; the homogeneous nature of the plasm in the monera (both chromacea and bacteria and rhizomonera) and the primitive simplicity of their life-functions do not dispose us to think that special groups of molecules are to be distinguished in these cases». In the same volume Haeckel, as elsewhere, adverts to the crystals, which, in his view, morphologically correspond to the most elemen tary forms, or monera, of the organic cells. «If we do not restrict the term " life " to organisms properly so-called, and take it only as a function of plasm, we may speak in a broader sense of the life of crystals. This is seen especially in their growth, the phenomenon which Baer regarded as the chief character of all individual devel opment ...». Such views are stated by Haeckel, in a more detailed manner, in his last published work «Die Kristallseelen» (1917). He harks back to Otto Lehmann, who discovered the so-called «liquid crystals», which at first he called « seemingly living crystals ». Haeckel, drop ping the qualification «seemingly», interprets the discovery of Lehmann fully in accordance with his monistic doctrine: «All sub stance, inorganic as well as organic, has life; all things are animate, crystals as well as organisms». From this point of view there is,</page><page sequence="12">112 G. USCHMANN according to Haeckel, not only a « descriptive crystallography » but also a « physiology » and a « psychomatic » of crystals. So «the mole cular motions and, linked with them, the sensations (Fuhlungen) of the crystallizing substance are not different from the corresponding phenomena of life in lowest organism, which were formerly attributed to a teleological ' vital forceThe unprejudice critical comparison of the ' most elementary forms of life ' leads us to a coherent physical understanding of the whole of nature and at the same time solves the great riddle of the natural origination of the most elementary organ isms from inorganic substance; that is to say, the vexing problem of spontaneous generation or archigony ». Following these ideas Haeckel, in a purely speculative way, interprets his studies on radiolaria on which his renown as a zoologist in 1862, was founded. In his opinion the importance of the radiolaria was not fully appreciated. This applies especially to the « cell-soul» of the radiolaria, to their primitive « feeling and will». The activity of the « radiolaria soul» forms the tiny skeletons of these animals, the so-called «biocrystals». Accordingly, a «progressive scale of the soul's activities » or « psychomatic scale » can be established. It leads from the atom-soul to the molecular and crystal-soul, to the souls of the prebionts, (unicellular) protista, thallophytes, cormophytes, sponges etc., to the «souls of man in the state of nature, and of the higher animals» and finally, up to the « Geisteskulturmensch » charac terized by a developed intellect and consciousness of the world, as well as by science and art. This scale is on the whole conformable to the old scale systems of the pre-phylogenetic epoch. Of course Haeckel's attempt to defi nitely do away with «the traditional partition between inorganic and organic nature » miscarried. Nevertheless, the ideas of Haeckel have had a lasting effect. Also Otto Lehmann, the discoverer of liquid crystals, held the view that all matter is living and that the electrons are the most elementary animals. As late as 1930 F. Rinne maintained, subsequent to W. J. Schmidt's investigations into the sperm of sepia, that « sperms are to be included among the liquid crystals» and form a connecting link between organic and inorganic matter. According to him, sperms are «doubtlessly organic-living matter» and have « at the same time the nature of liquid crystals». In 1935, E. Brauns</page><page sequence="13">Haeckel's biological materialism 113 rightly judges that«in the field of liquid crystals there are two outlooks opposing each other: that of exact science and that of a monistic natural philosophy ». This short characterization of Haeckel's, « monism » was intended to make it clear on how narrow a base of experimental biology his building of very far-reaching philosophical conclusions is erected. In addition, Haeckel drew upon the results of other scientific bran ches, often expounding them in terms of monism, after his own wishful thinking. Constantly, Haeckel tended to premature generalizations, which were very harmful to his renown among the experts. A well-known example is the dispute on certain drawings he had made of embryos. Repeatedly, especially about 1900, after the success of the « Weltrath sel», this dispute led to bitter polemics against Haeckel. It began in 1868 with the first edition of the « Natiirliche Schop fungsgeschichte ». In this book on page 248, in the 12th lecture con cerning the « Evolutional Laws of Organic Families and Individuals. Phylogenesis and Ontogenesis», he showed, side by side, three embryos, viz. of the dog, the hen, and the turtle. The caption reads, « each one of the three embryos was taken from exactly the same stage of development, in which the five brain vesicles are just shaping ». In the text (p. 249) Haeckel writes that comparing the young embryos it is not possible to observe a difference. In fact it is not, because he used the same cliche for each of the three figures. This of course did not remain unnoticed and in the second edition of 1870 we find the same picture only once, now being designated in the caption as an embryo « of a mammal or a bird ». The text reads that in the representative early stage of development it is quite impossible «to discern the embryos of the various mammals, birds, and reptiles from each other». Possibly Haeckel made this correction only because in 1868 the Swiss naturalist Ludwig RUtimeyer (1825-95) in a review of the «Natiirliche Schopfungsgeschichte», called such a policy «a sin against scientific truth which does great harm to the scholar's public credit». In 1874 also the anatomist Wilhelm His (1831-1904), in his book « Unsere Korperform», pronounced sharply against Haeckel</page><page sequence="14">114 G. USCHMANN and cited further examples of inadmissible schematizing of certain embryo pictures. These and further assaults, Haeckel faced in the «apologetic ephilogue» of the 4th edition of his « Anthropogenie » (1891). There we read, «this much discussed ' story of the three cliches', which in the opinion of the ' exact' school has dealt the death-blow to my credit as a scientist, bears a certain resemblance to Lessing's ' story of the three rings'. The expert colleagues know that the matter in question was a highly thoughtless piece of folly ... ». In the same place Haeckel continues that he had illustrated by the «three identical figures three highly similar objects» and that in the second edition he has corrected this «formal mistake ». Haeckel has not had this passage reprinted, not even in his polemic treatise «Sandalion», which was published in 1910, at a time when his ideological adver saries in particular referred to the schematized embryo pictures to prove his scientific untrustworthiness. In all his popular writings Haeckel was at pains to draw philoso phical conclusions from biological findings, being well aware that in doing so he would not only create himself ideological adversaries, but that also the speciahsts could take umbrage due to his often superficial method which led to premature generalization, and also because of the philosophical and ideological excursuses. This is apparent from the letters of colleagues with whom he was on friendly terms. In particular the anatomist Carl Gegenbaur (1826-1903), who greatly supported him and enable him to embark on an academic career as a zoologist in Jena. Time and again he exhorted Haeckel in his letters to content himself with exact specialized investigations. It is interesting that also the famous English Darwinist Thomas Henry Huxley (1825-95) chided Haeckel. From the correspondence between Haeckel and Huxley it is apparent that an English translation of the « Generelle Morphologie » was planned. Huxley demanded energe tically that the philosophical chapters be cancelled, although he did show appreciation of the polemics of Haeckel. He writes in 1867 (May 20): «I have done 1 oo much of the same sort of thing not to sympathise entirely with you; and I am much inclined to think that it is a good thing for a man, once at any rate in his life, to perform a public war-dance against all sorts of humbug and imposture.</page><page sequence="15">Haeckel's biological materialism 115 But having satisfied one's love of freedom in this way, perhaps the sooner the war-paint is off again the better. It has no virtue except as a sign of one's own frame of mind and determination, and when that is once known, is little better than a distraction. I think there are a few patches of this kind, my dear friend, which may as well come out in the next edition, e.g. that wonderful note about the relation of God to gas, the gravity of which greatly ticked my fancy. I pictured to myself the effect which a translation of this would have upon the minds of my respectable countrymen! ». In a similar manner Huxley writes 13th November, 1868: «Fur thermore, English propriety had taken fright at rumours touching the aggressive heterodoxy of some passages - (We do not much mind heterodoxy here, if it does not openly proclaim itself as such)». In the same letter Huxley insists on cancelling chapter IV of the first book of the « Generelle Morphologie », in which, among other things, the problems of «teleology and causality » and « dualism and monism » are discussed. With regard to chapter VI (Generatio spontanea) Huxley asks for an amended version: «I think Chapter IV of the first book of the first volume might be omitted. Anyone who is likely to apprehend such considerations on these branches will have read J. S. Mill's logic and as to the second half of the chapter it would be an awful ' Stein des Anstosses ' and is not essential to ' Morpho logie '. Again I would suggest that Chapter VI (Book II) should be rewritten and the aggressions taken out of it. These are some notes which would make shipwreck of us at once. It is in Book IV however that I think condensation and excision might well go furthest. It is at once very difficult to follow and very specu lative ». Interesting is the reaction of Haeckel who is known for his pugna cious attitude and for the tenacity with which he, again and again, pushed his views, even when sufficient arguments for certain assertions were lacking. Just 7 days after Huxley's proposals had reached him (18.11.1868), Haeckel yielded to all the demands. In particular, he agreed to cut down the manuscript by one-half and to omit every personal polemic, « every heterodoxy and, in general, every remark</page><page sequence="16">116 G. USCHMANN which would not be strictly pertinent». Furthermore, he agreed to cancel Books VII and VIII completely, the titles of which were: « The biogeny of the organisms in its meaning for anthropology » (Book VII) and « The biogeny of the organisms in its meaning for cosmology » (Book VIII). This meant that the English edition would not contain any of the arguments on the descent of man or the general conclusions which were so important for Haeckel, i.e., his «system of monism ». Thus, the English reader would not know anything of what Haeckel regarded to be his most peculiar task (as can also be learned from all his later popular writings). Time and again he mocked at the «exact» naturalists, who, in his opinion, contented themselves with research on bare facts but were unable to draw philosophical conclusions from their investigations. This correspondence between Huxley and Haeckel is very important in understanding Haeckel's ideas and at the same time it gives an insight into how these ideas were born. In particular it illustrates the gap existing between personal or adopted results of research and the consequences drawn from them. Huxley felt this very distinctly and therefore demanded that the philosophical excursuses and the sharp polemics be cancelled from the planned Enghsh trans lation of the « Generelle Morphologie ». Though being himself an enthusiastic adherent and fervent defender of Darwinism, regarding ideological problems he remained an adherent of agnosticism. The fact that Haeckel yielded to the demands of Huxley shows that he himself was not entirely convinced of the « doctrine of unity », i.e. the monism, proclaimed by him. Haeckel had at least perceived the gap between the results of research and his monism. From the study of the relevant literature it appears that these relations were often overlooked and are, in part, not recognized even today. Haeckel has often tried, in a highly impressive manner and with all his literary dexterity to prove that all his far-reaching conclusions follow stringently from well-grounded scientific findings. When we judge these philosophical and ideological conclusions, different versions are discernable, the interpretation often being impeded by contradictory statements. Notwithstanding, it can be said that, from 1866 onward, Haeckel did not produce anything that was in principle new. To sum up we can state:</page><page sequence="17">Haeckel's biological materialism 117 (1) From Haeckel's occupation with biological objects grew his tendency to morphology and comparative anatomy as well as to systematics, which were pursued in pre-phylogenetic terms. Until he read Darwin's «On the Origin of Species» (1860) Haeckel assumed an indifferent or negative attitude towards the idea of evolu tion, which at that time had already been treated by a great number of writers. When during the studentship, in 1857, Wilhelm Olbers Focke (1834-1922), who later was a natural scientist in Bremen, declared that there were proofs for the variability of the organic species, Haeckel rephed that he considered such a view to be wrong. He passed the same judgement on Focke's opinion of the varieties as the starting point of new species. (2) Under the influence of the theory of evolution Haeckel conceives a kind of « biological materialism », which more than once he clearly distinguishes from the so-called «moral materialism». This would appear quite understandable with regard to that time, which was characterized by the strong influence of the dogmas of the church. For that reason, Haeckel repeatedly uses the term «theo retical materialism ». (3) It was the linguist August Schleicher, whose « compara tive linguistics» is now again of topical interest, who drew Haeckel's attention to «monism». From him he also adopts the family-tree model. (4) Integrating the results of other scientific branches and interpreting them in his terms, Haeckel proclaims the hypothesis of an «animation of all matter» (Allbeseelung der Materie), which means that there is no difference between inorganic and organic matter. Thus he rejects the «materialism» (vulgar materialism) as well as the « spiritualism » (idealistic philosophy) of his time, both of them, according to him, duahstic. (5) Mistakes, premature generalizations, persistance in error, polemics against colleagues, and insistence on his own achievements become explainable if Haeckel is understood as an artistic character. This may also explain the romantic and in travels, partly poetic, descriptions, as well as the fact that Haeckel was often swayed, not by clear scientific reasons, but by emotions. Also here the comparison with Lamarck is obvious. When they were nearly the same age</page><page sequence="18">118 G. USCHMANN (about 25 years), Lamarck dallied with the idea of becoming a musi cian, whereas Haeckel felt inclined become a landscape-painter. (6) In general it is apparent that Haeckel, as a scientist and philosopher, can hardly boast of original achievements. This holds good also for scientific zoology, in which he owed much to Kol liker and Johannes MtiiXER. Johannes MiiiXER did more than merely interest him in the study of the lower oceanic animals. Haeckel did not only take over from him a field of research but also, especially with regard to the radiolaria, the method of representation. Of new methods and findings he remained, in general, unsusceptible. This is also true of the microscopical technics. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the interest in Haeckel is valid also at the present time. With all his imperfections he has exerted an enormous influence, particularly through his popular writings. This is to be understood from the conditions existing in the 19th century. At that time man witnessed, on one hand, great advances in science, in general enlightenment and in technics, and on the other he had the representatives of superannuated ecclesiastical and ideo logical dogmas, who wished to maintain their influence. Though being difficult to understand at the present time, this must not be underestimated. A case in point is given by the clever editor, Emil Strauss in Bonn. In April 1893 he wrote a letter to Haeckel in which he says it seemed necessary to him that« now again an authority speaks ... before the reaction will have done too great a mischief». It was in this context that the most successful work of Haeckel, «Die Weltrathsel» (1899), was written, and hence we should understand the immense impression created by this book, of which within a few years 400,000 copies were published. To sum up it can be said that the work of Haeckel corresponds to a genuine need of his time. We may add that the «biological materialism », which originated from a morphological and systematic branch of biology, and from which the « monism » developed, was, in spite of its temporariness, exceedingly influential in its time.1 1 References may be obtained upon request from the author.</page></plain_text>
