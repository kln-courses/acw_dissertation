<plain_text><page sequence="1">INTRODUCTION 411 INTRODUCTION TO SYMPOSIUM The following five papers originally were presented at the annual meeting of the American Anthropological Association in November 1994 in Washington, D.C., as part of a session on current theory of religion in anthropology. They represent the contemporary range of approaches to such theory, which now is enjoying renewed vigor after several decades of dormancy. The first paper discusses a general theory of religion based on ostensibly universal human mental processes. After reviewing several recent theorists, Stewart Guthrie presents a cognitive theory. Guthrie argues that deities, which he sees as characteristic of religion, are instances of a broader phenomenon, anthropomorphism. Further, anthropornorphism is not motivated by familiarity or comfort, as usually supposed, but results from a perceptual strategy: to interpret an ambiguous world, first, as whatever matters to us most. That usually is other humans and their actions. Thus we are primed to hear voices in the wind, see design in nature, and interpret disasters as punishments. The second paper critically examines propositions about religion, long virtually canonical in the social sciences. Comte, Weber, Tylor, and Durkheim all predicted that in modern society, rationalization and individualization would shift popular loyalties from religion to science as a means of explaining and controlling the world. Scandinavia often is cited as a type case of this process. Yet Andrew Buckser's work in Denmark indicates that religious traditions there remain influential and that where religious groups have declined, this has not resulted from any triumph of a scientific worldview. Thus secularization theory and the Tylorian rationalism on which it largely rests, Buckser concludes, are inadequate. A third pair of papers applies theoretical constructs to Afro-Caribbean religions, illuminating debates about authenticity and change among both scholars and adherents of these traditions. Stephen Glazier holds that Edward Sapir's distinction between cultures that are "genuine" and those that are "spurious" points out an important difference between Afro-Caribbean religions (most specifically Spiritual Baptism) as self-consistent and hence authentic, and the Christianity of former plantation owners, as contradictory, nominal and insincere. Glazier thus clarifies an issue about Afro-Caribbean traditions that is not only of continuing academic interest but also of intense current interest to the adherents themselves. James Houk tests theory against issues of change and stability within these same religious traditions. Centrally, Houk notes that whereas many anthropologists think of religion as culturally conservative, many folk religions (including contemporary Trinidadian Orisha) are highly mutable. Houk attributes their mutability to their decentralized organizations and their unwritten liturgies. He finds that the resulting instability and heterodoxy have led some Orisha worshippers to work for institutionalization by consolidating shrines, expurgating non-African elements, and standardizing liturgies.
