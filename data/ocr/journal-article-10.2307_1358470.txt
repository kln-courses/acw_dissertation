<plain_text><page sequence="1">Louise Bourgeois by Paul Gardner Universe, 1994 Louise Bourgeois: The Locus of Memory, Works 1982-1993 essays by Charlotta Kotik, Terrie Sultan, and Christian Leigh AbranZs, 1994 Reviewed by Julie Nicoletta aul Gardner's Louise Bourgeois (part of the Universe Series on Women Artists) presents an intimate view of the artist and her art, while Louise Bourgeois: The Locus of iMemory, Works 1982-1993, an exhibition catalogue produced by the Brooklyn Muse- um of Art, attempts to place the artist's re- cent work in the context of her long career. Both volumes add to the growing body of lit- erature on Bourgeois, one of the most signif- icant and enigmatic of 20th-century artists. Born in France in 1911, Bourgeois began working as an artist in the 1930s. She first fo- cused on painting but by the 1940s had turned to sculpture. Her exhibition of wood- en figures at the Peridot Gallery in New York City in 1949 marked her official entry into the art world as a sculptor. Although she ex- hibited sporadically in New York galleries over the years, Bourgeois remained on the fringes of the art scene, watching as the male artists of Surrealism, Abstract Expressionism, and Pop Art gained celebrity as cultural he- roes. Not until 1982, when the Museum of Modern Art mounted a major retrospective of her work, did she gain national recogni- tion. Since then the artist has received nu- merous awards and international acclaim, cul- minating in the 1993 Venice Biennale, where her art alone constituted the United States's contribution to the official exhibition. Despite her late arrival on the art world's center stage, Bourgeois has fascinated her followers for decades. Her work exhibits a mastery of materials ranging from found ob- jects to wvood, from latex to marble. By com- bining figuration and abstraction, seen most strongly through anthropomorphic male/fe- male forms, she has created works of intense personal emotion. Furthermore, her proclivi- ty for telling stories has for many observers illuminated her artistic motivations while si- multaneously conjuring more riddles. Paul Gardner, who has known the artist for more than 15 years, presents the most in- timate view of Bourgeois published to date. His slim volume is packed with vignettes of Bourgeois's creative process as well as an analysis of her work. The text, aimed at a 0 popular audience and an excellent introduc- tion to the artist, is divided into two parts, "Through the Looking Glass" and "Intima- cy." The illustrations are numerous, many in color. "Through the Looking Glass" brings the reader into the daily life of the artist, follow- ing her from her home in the Chelsea sec- tion of Manhattan to her studio in Brooklyn. Her struggle for recognition in the art world is recounted, as are some of the significant, and often-told, elements of her childhood- her parents' tapestry restoration workshop in Choisy-le-Roi, where Bourgeois learned to draw, and her father's various affairs, includ- ing a ten-year liaison with the family gov- erness. Gardner provides new insight into the artist's personality, and interspersed throughout the text are accounts of Bour- geois's encounters with other artists, gallery owners, and collectors. Bourgeois herself re- counts tales of her childhood, an actixity that Gardner says she enjoys. For some years she also has been inviting people to her house to videotape them, sometimes over lunch. Like her art, these videos, which she makes for her own amusement rather than for exhibi- tion, allow her to look behind public masks to the inner psyches of individuals. Bour- geois's interest in this medium may surprise readers who only know her work as a sculp- tor, but it exposes a new facet of the artist's complex personality. "Intimacy," the second part of Gardner's book, shifts to Bourgeois's art itself, focusing on how her emotions and experiences inform her creations. Gardner does not follow the artist's work chronologically but rather con- centrates on unifying themes, like fear, anger, betrayal, and the sexual merging of male and female. By doing so, he jumps back and forth between the past and present; for ex- ample, comparing Bour- geois's Femmnes Maison paintings of the 1940s to her marble sculptures of the 1980s, which return to the theme of the "WVoman House" or "housewife," as Gardner translates the term. (50) The text is peppered with references to Bour- geois's independence from the mainstream. Gardner notes that .- Bourgeois willfully re- i fuses to belong to any school, describing her- self as "a lone wolf." Fig. 1. Louise Bou (41) Indeed, he asserts marble, cerar her work does not fit in- Photo: Peter B to any of the major art movements of the 20th century. Yet it would be wrong to say that Bourgeois was completely removed from the New York art world. She knew many artists, including Marcel Duchamp, Andr6 Breton, and Max Ernst, though she considered them "lordly and pontifical," (26) and her marriage to art historian Robert Goldwater helped put her at the center of the art scene, if not of art movements. Al- though Gardner provides a fascinating view of Bourgeois's personal relationship to her art, the reader is left wondering where she stands in the spectrum of 20th-century art. L outise Bourgeois: The Locus of lMemory, VWorks 1982-1993, the handsome com- panion volume to the first major museum ex- hibition of Bourgeois's work since 1982, is filled with numerous full-page, color pho- tographs. Three curators of contemporary art offer assessments of the artist's work. Char- lotta Kotik's "The Locus of Memory: An In- troduction to the Work of Louise Bourgeois" presents a brief overview of the artist's life and career. Little new information is provid- ed here, except in Kotik's short introduction to Bourgeois's latest and most significant works, including, her Cells Series from 1992 and 1993. The next two essays provide a bet- ter understanding of Bourgeois's art. Terrie Sultan's "Redefining the Terms of Engage- ment: The Art of Louise Bourgeois" discuss- es the artist's intensely personal relationship with her creations. According to Sultan, Bourgeois invites the viewer to enter into this relationship yet controls access, both physically and psychologically. This ambigui- ty is seen most clearly in the Cells installa- tions, which expand "many of the repeated motifs and concerns outlined throughout the rgeois, Cell (You Better Grow Up) (1993), steel, glass, mic, wood, 83" x 82" x 83/2".

(41) These works, theatrical settings for Bourgeois's sculptures of body fragments, deal with themes of fear, memo- ry, and voyeurism. Christian Leigh, in "The Earrings of Madame B... : Louise Bourgeois and the Reciprocal Terrain of the Uncanny," analyzes these themes in the context of Bourgeois's art of the psyche. Leigh attribut- es the supremacy of her work to her refusal to be part of any movement: "Rather, Bour- geois is a movement unto herself." (52) By working within the realm of the uncanny, Bourgeois achieves universal themes, ad- dressing not only her own memories but also those of viewers of her work. Although these essays provide insights in- to Bourgeois's work, as with Gardner, they fo- cus almost exclusively on a psychoanalytical view of the artist. Bourgeois encourages this perception through her own accounts of her past and the intense emotional content of her works. However useful, this approach to ana- lyzing art is limited by its complete depen- dence on the artist and its exclusion of out- side forces. Perhaps as scholarly interest in Bourgeois's work increases, the broader im- plications of her art eventually will be probed. More revealing than the essays in the Brooklyn catalogue is the section entitled "Statements." Included here are eleven testi- monies made by artists, critics, and scholars. These brief, personal comments on Bour- geois's work contain a range of impressions that say a great deal about the artist and her impact on 20th-century art. Adrian Piper finds her work sensuous and disturbing: When Ifirst saw a sculpture by Louise Bourgeois Ifelt myself in the presence of something alive, organic, and erotic that would continue to transmute into yetfur- therforms and essences as I looked at it; something that bespoke an intimacy so deep it made me physically and psychologi- cally uncomfortable, as though my moth- er's breast and belly were beckoning me back to infancy .... I become immediately aware of throwing up resistance to seeing it too clearly. (79) Jenny Holzer lists her reactions to recur- ring themes in Bourgeois's work: "Her work seems neither male nor female, but both with a vengeance; the meat breeds itself. .. I imagine Bourgeois knows that everything is possible between people, and that the un- thinkable occurs routinely." (76) Richard Serra attempts to discern the source of Bourgeois's powerful forms: "I am told of childhood traumas, but that seems to be only part of the story. .... The source of pain, the core of the anxiety remains indeci- FALL 1996 / WINTER 1997 pherable, and yet these sculptures trigger in me the memory of personal experiences I'd rather forget." (80) These and other com- ments illustrate the depth and force with which Bourgeois's work has touched her younger colleagues. Bourgeois's own statement concerning Cell (You Better Grow Up) (1993; Fig. 1) is revealing. The piece is an installation en- closed by chain-link fencing and glass win- dows. Two round mirrors attached to the window frames reflect the central elements of the work-a block of marble with three hands carved in stone, a ceramic container with three openings, four round glass vessels stacked on top of one another, and three small perfume bottles. Bourgeois talks about how the senses trigger memories and the strong emotions associated with them: The perfume bottles put us in a nostalgic mood with the powerful recall of smell. In our refusal to confront our fear, we retreat into nostalgia. The tiny figure inside the stacked glass shapes is cut offfrom the world. That's me. The little hands are mine. They are self- portraits. I identify with the dependent one. The world that is described and realized is the frightening world of a child who doesn't like being dependent and who suffers from it. So the moral of this Cell is, you better grow up. (70-71) Bourgeois once again reinforces the notion that her childhood shaped her adult life and constantly influences her art. One of the most revealing and perhaps significant aspects of Bourgeois is not dis- cussed in either book-the extent to which the artist controls the perceptions of her life and art. It is evident in both texts that Bour- geois's stories of her childhood, her fears, her domineering father and long-suffering moth- er, are accepted by the authors at face value. These stories not only have informed the artist's work, but they have also helped cre- ate her public persona. In addition, the charismatic Bourgeois has played a decisive role in many exhibitions of her art, selecting both curators and authors in an attempt to shape perceptions of her art. Richard Serra, in his catalogue statement, questions the dominance of childhood traumas as the source of Bourgeois's work. Indeed, a study of Bourgeois should go beyond her child- hood to her experiences as an artist in Paris and New York, where, over her long career, she has been a part, however tangentially, of major moder art movements. How has her presence on the fringes of the art world af- fected her and her creations? How and why does an artist reshape her biography? These and other questions remain to be answered in a definitive book on Bourgeois. Together, Gardner's book and the Brook- lyn Museum of Art's catalogue provide com- plementary views of Louise Bourgeois. Gard- ner presents the more engaging and insight- ful perspective on the artist herself, while the Brooklyn Museum's catalogue offers the most thorough collection of Bourgeois's re- cent works in a beautifully produced volume. Although neither book goes beyond previous methodological approaches to understanding Bourgeois's oeuvre and her place in 20th- century art, both contain up-to-date informa- tion on the artist's most recent work. Despite their few shortcomings, these books make significant contributions to the body of knowledge on Bourgeois.

Picasso and the Weeping Women: The Years of Marie- Therese Walter and Dora Maar by Judi Freeman Los Angeles County Museum of Art, 1994 Reviewed by Julie Springer icasso's images of weeping women were the thematic tools of this exhibition of oil paintings, drawings, prints, and sculpture produced between 1927 and 1943. Orga- nized by the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and shown as well at New York's Metro- politan Museum and the Art Institute of Chicago, the more than 80 works exhibited in "Picasso and the Weeping Women" traced the visual variations of this imagery and at- tempted to decipher the multiple meanings it had for the artist. Although the female figure is a staple subject throughout Picasso's career, the spe- cific motif of the weeping woman, which vir- tually obsessed the artist for a period in the late 1930s, is one that has never before been examined by Picasso scholars, according to Judi Freeman, formerly associate curator of 20th-century art at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and now at the Portland Mu- seum of Art in Maine. Freeman argues that Picasso's grief-stricken or traumatized wom- en possess two levels of meaning: the univer- sal and autobiographical. The weeping woman served simultaneously as a generic symbol of human misery and, more ambigu- ously, as a barometer of Picasso's turbulent, 0</page></plain_text>
