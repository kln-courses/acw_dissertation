Well into the Byzantine period, probably in the tenth century, a certain Leo compiled a little handbook on the nature of man in which he poses the question "What is man?" Man is, he goes on to reply, a "rational mortal animal, capable of thought and knowledge," ( ov AoyLKOV V0Vr7dV, voi3 Ka E7rr L7r7/l)s 8EK8K dKV. Leo has borrowed this definition verbatim from the ninth-century(?) treatise of Meletius the Monk On the Constitution of Man. Meletius in his turn took the defini- tion directly from the bishop Nemesius (early fifth century?), who, in his work On the Nature of Man, prefaces this formulation with the general statement rdV vOpwrov cptLov7ra, "people define man." Gregory of Nyssa similarly attests the tralatitious character of the words: rT AoyLKOV TOOTO OOV d aV0W YOc VOU TE Kal f'7t&amp;0ET0 6KTLKOV ELVaL Kal, iap~ 70'v W 0 AyO Adyov TO a70 O a' js p Taprv'pr a.1 The definition is by no means exclusively Byzantine or Christian, scholastic though it sounds. It is to be found in the pseudo-Galenic Definitiones Medicae,2 and Sextus Empiricus quotes it more than once.3 The earliest traces of it seem to be in the pseudo-Platonic "OpoL (4i5A: :vOpwiros ov...

The patristic tradition furnishes further examples of this definition, e.g. [Basilius Caesariensis] Contra Eunomium, PG 29.688 B; [Athanasius] Liber de definitionibus PG 28.534 C.

Two fundamental pieces of information emerge from all this. First, this definition of man, which was to become orthodox in Greek thought, was a creation of formal Greek philosophy; its earlier distribution and the language itself, which is technical, establish this. Second, the specific difference which sets apart man from all other mortal animals in this definition is his Aodyo, his capacity for intellectual activity.5 This attitude, that man is a rational animal, has been for so long an accepted commonplace in Western culture that its specifically Greek origin is seldom a matter of conscious reflection. In reality, that man differs from animals because of his intelligence, so far from being a natural way of looking at things, is an exceptional mode of thought in the history of man (infra). Consider the very phrase "rational animal," animal rationale; it is nothing but a literal translation of ?c-ov AoyLKdV. This phrase, a stock definition which is found far more frequently than the fuller one illustrated above, succinctly segregates man from all other animals in a telling way. Man has the use of Aodyo while the rest are dAoya (ca. The pronounced dichotomy, whereby man is rigidly opposed to other animals, has scarcely any rival as a characteristically Greek concept. Its significance can be appreciated if one reflects that only in the present century, with its increased interest in the scientific study of animal intelligence and communication, has a different attitude toward animals really begun to impose itself upon the consciousness of educated men. It would serve no practical purpose to attempt a systematic collection of the numerous passages where ?c-ov AoyLKOV occurs, but some historical comments may not be out of place. The tendency of early Greek thought 4 132"19 ff; cf. I33a2O ff, 134a14 ff. 5 The point of Ovqrdov in the definition is to distinguish man from dOdvaira (a; the particular reference(s) varied with philosophical school and period.

One or two representa- tive, if random, passages must suffice to illustrate the man ~ other animals dichotomy in Plato. In the Politicus the Stranger remarks ETESr pL&amp;aa 7rpoOJLows3 8Jtvat E dcL owv ye'qv, T' fLev dvOpC6rLvov, ETEpov 8S eZv 2AACwv av1ndv-rwv OVqplwv v (263C) and again, a little later in the dia- logue, d6vO6pwrot, pov Sv rEepOV OELOdepOV, cAAca ydewl v avAdVOEpa adr&amp;vv voPLEdov1a (2z7E). In the myth in the Protagoras (32IB) 6 avOepdnrwv yevor is contrasted with rd 'Aoya. Of particular interest is Plato's attitude toward young children. In the Republic (44iA-B), that part of the soul called r~ AoyLrTLKd'V is found to be absent from animals (O-qpla) - and from children (7raL&amp;a). The Timaeus contains a passage (44A-C) which teaches that the soul of an infant is avovg at birth, the consequence of disordered revolutions (rreplo6So, repLbopal) in the soul. Only gradually does one become E1 pwv, as these revolutions become more orderly, especially with the help of proper education (TLi 'pOO7 rpoof7r raLSv4ewsj). In the Laws (8o8D) Plato actually writes that the child is the "hardest to manage of all beasts" (irraTcrov Olptw... iUTLEreaXEpL- codTraov). A deficiency in AoyLaupds suffices to place young humans in the category of animals. Naturally, the literalness of this must not be pressed; the language remains indicative. This Platonic viewpoint reappears in Aristotle, HA 588a i ff: S La epeL S' oS3v E , se ELvT V X [sc. 7~V Italsolv] (iA) g v OV ploWv bvxy Ka7d 7i-v XpdVOV oOToov. The actual word AoyLKOr never occurs in Plato's works, nor is it attested for any earlier writer.6 Aristotle has it, but not the phrase (cov AoyLKdv.7 Who first coined this expression is no longer discoverable; it seems to have been especially popular with the Stoics.8 The important point is that ojov AoyLKdV, whatever its origins, was the private property of no particular philosophical school; rather, it became common coin in the 6 But see n.7. 7 There is one possible exception; lamblichus VP 31 [= D.-K.

Whether rT' Aoy&amp;KbV ov occurred in Aristotle's Pythagorean source or lamblichus has a "modernized" version is not certain. (Much more probably the latter. Walter Burkert, Lore and Science in Ancient Pythagoreanism (Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1972), p. 144, is confident: "a phrase like Aoy&amp;KbV ,ov [sc. in this very passage] betrays later terminology.") The main point is that Aristotle himself does not use (Zov AoyLKdv as part of his own philosophical vocabulary. 8 According to Aetius, Placita 1.3 [= Diels Dox.

By contrast, in LSJ s.v. AoytLK'S this sense of the word is found in fourth place. It can be taken for granted that by the early Christian period ?W-ov AoyLKdV had long been as familiar an expression in Greek as "rational animal" is in English. Before proceeding it is necessary to say something about the meaning of (Cov. For rd ca in general, as well as man, rd AoytK3V 4Wov, in parti- cular, were the object of philosophical theorizing which resulted in various formal distinctions and definitions.

The famous fragment (I17 D.-K.) in which Empe- docles proclaims that he has been a boy and a girl and a bush (Odpvos) and a bird and a fish may imply the same belief.

Just as Greeks sharply discriminated be- tween men and animals, so they had a similar inclination to separate animals and plants more rigidly than is usual among many early peoples (or present-day "primitives").13 The very word ?cov reveals how pronounced this tendency was. Etymologically, the term means simply "living thing" and should include plant as well as animal life. That Plato in the Timaeus, 77B, was quite conscious of this is shown by Ae'yoo pOd'-rara, for that is technical language with specific reference to the CpObrrq dvdoaroS, the true sense of the word. 4 Greek modes of thought imposed a narrower meaning upon C-ov than it otherwise would have had. This is neatly illustrated by a sentence in Aristotle, GA 73Ib4-5: S&amp;aQE'pE~ 8' aTEL 7Oqa r a 7ray -v vrwv j~dvov. (See also PA 68I'I3 ff; De Anima 413b4.) According to the normal rules of Greek 7d a a and 7r ~5v-ra should have been synonymous; in practice COov, often, is interchangeable rather with O-~plov. Latin animal and English "animal" acquire their usual meanings, again against the etymology, directly from Greek (-ov. Our phrase "animal, vegetable, 11 Tim. 9oA... .7~L~a ... gO vraS v)vOuv oK' EyyELOV d~M O3pdivLov is a different matter. 12 Cf. A. E. Taylor on P1. Tim. 77A 5.

The only other philosopher adduced for such a view is Empedocles. 13 This, as a statement of the usual Greek outlook, is true enough, but like all generalities, it runs a risk of oversimplification. The Greeks were on occasion capable of more flexibility in this regard.

As was remarked above, this way of looking at things, common to the Greeks and to many even now,16 is not nearly so natural as it may seem to us. Frazer has observed "the sharp line of demarcation which we draw between mankind and the lower animals does not exist for the savage. To him many of the other animals appear as his equals or even his superiors, not merely in brute force but in intelligence."17 These days one may smile at the facile use of the condescending term "savage," but nevertheless Frazer's basic point is well taken. In another passage he pertinently remarks of the "savage" that he "is more liberal and perhaps more logical than the civilized man ... he commonly believes that animals are endowed with feelings and intelligence like those of men."18 In fact, before the develop- ment of some technology in the ancient world, it was by no means apparent that man had the advantage over animals. In obtaining food and shelter, in defending themselves against natural enemies, in, that is, what the Greeks called rd &amp;vayKata, animals were often clearly superior. Early human dwellings were not to be compared in intricacy or technical skill with, say, a spider's web, a beehive, or the nests of certain birds. No human hunter could provide food with the expertise and dependability of the eagle or the fox. What reason had man to deny intelligence to animals, to feel superior to them? But there came a day when the Greeks, whatever the causes, thought otherwise. The difference appears very subtly in a sentence which Seneca wrote under the influence of Greek philosophy: Tacitis quoque et brutis, quamquam in cetera torpeant, ad vivendum sollertia est.19 That animals possessed sollertia had never been doubted; that they were dumb beasts with no language of their own (tacitis ... et brutis) is a Greek innovation. Fifth- century pride in technological progress, a pride which found its most famous expression in the great rrohAAa 7-d SELV chorus of Sophocles, was doubtless one factor, but it cannot be the whole explanation of this. 15 Here too a change from the Greek attitude is discernible in our times. In particular, the problem of "plant sensitivity" is attracting considerable interest. Whether music and soft speech are conducive to plant growth I must leave to others to decide. 16 At least in Western societies; I do not feel competent to comment on the Orient. 17 Sir James George Frazer, The Golden Bough3 (1935), pt.

This is not to say that the problem of animal intelligence was simply ignored. Quite the contrary. Apparently purposive behavior on the part of animals had to be explained somehow, and the Greeks faced up to the problem resolutely. One approach was provided by the fertile new concept of v'ts which, among its other meanings, came to be used in the sense of animal instinct, as in Democritus Fr. 278 D.-K. 89i-Aov 8E'c Kal ro Z aAAoLst 4*oLUL -7Tcvra yap iyova Kca-aL tcKa-r oqLV E~rCw EEhlr/s 7yE otMEJELL9 EVcKa.

Not all thinkers were prepared to leave it at that. Aristotle recognized intelligence (OpdoviuLs, not voi!) in certain animals, such as the bee. This was, however, qualitatively different from human reason; man still remained an entity set apart. As Ross has observed, "" pdoviqus as it exists in animals involves no Ao'yos. But its existence in animals, in this wider sense, is pointed out even in the Ethics (1141z26; cf. De Gen. An. 753alrI)." And again "in man a new activity sometimes occurs, which never occurs in the lower animals. A man may grasp the universal."20 Even the possibility that animals actually possessed Adyo9 was maintained by some, especially by the Skeptics and certain Academics. Plutarch's treatises De sollertia animalium and Bruta animalia ratione uti are popular specimens of this viewpoint. Those who adopted such a stance were, however, consciously departing anew from the formal Greek view that man alone of OvqYi&amp; 'ca was a AoyKWV Vcgov; that is, they do not represent a continuous tradition, the vestigial remains of an earlier outlook. (Doubtless, in Greece as elsewhere, older ways of thought long survived among the uneducated, especially in country districts. This does not affect the significance of what was new and original.)

(That this attitude was deeply engrained in the Greek mentality has of course long been a truism, but one more often glibly parroted than rigorously documented.) A few such technical definitions and formulas are hardly, in themselves, adequate documentation for the Anschauung of an entire people.24 Far more impressive evidence is furnished by a widespread group of commonplaces which do not seem to have been the subject of special study. These constitute a distinct topos, which one might describe as the "pdvov ' nov 4wv dvOpwTros" topos. Again and again Greek writers point out that man is unique in some respect. These special characteristics are of the most varied sort, ranging from pecu- liarities of hair and smells to a participation in the Divine. A very common way of signalizing such distinct properties of man is to say "man alone of animals is / has . . ." or, alternately, to remark "it is a 23 Outlines of Pyrrhonism 2.26. In another passage Sextus has an amusing encomium canis in which he attempts to demonstrate against the Stoics that, on their own premises, this poor creature possesses all the intellectual qualities of humans (I.62 ff).

The "hymn" in praise thereof which Isocrates inserts in the Nicocles (3.5-9, repeated in the Antidosis 15.253-257), though too long to be reproduced here, may be taken as emblematic. It is by virtue of speech, he there states explicit- ly, that we stand apart from animals (rd ,a).

"And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth." Be it noted that this early Hebraic "anthro- pocentricity" is actually on quite a different level from that of the Greeks. God is conceived anthropomorphically - the "image" and "likeness" is a literal one - and man's "dominion" is not explicitly justified by his unique possession of a rational intellect. Indeed, in chapter three of Genesis the serpent outwits and deceives homo sapiens. 28 Cf.

Genesis I:2639 made ready a welcome reception, first on the part of Philo and then of the Christians, for the Greek philosophic idea that man was an "image and likeness" of God. The long history of that concept in Christian theology cannot be traced here, but one passage, from the "renegade" Tatian, may be adduced. It shows that man's uniqueness in this regard could be maintained even by those who did not accept Adyos - the usual touchstone of the divine in man - as a peculiar prerogative of men. Oratio ad Graecos, c. 15: uare yap XvOpwTosro oi x, 35 For a brief discussion, with references, of this latter concept see HSCP 68.1964.383-384. 36 Cf. also EN 1I77b26-31; 1153b32 is different: rr'v-ra yap bUUoe EiXE 7 OELOV. 37 Verse 5 is modeled on II. 17.447 = Od. 18.131, 7rw?vrwv Jaa a E yatav brt irvelEL TE Ka K EprL.

The contrast between men and other (6a could hardly be expressed more emphatically than it is in these (and similar) passages. There is no question of other animals sharing in the divine. This is well brought out by Galen, who takes the pi-q tpa motif one step further, De Usu Partium 1.22 [= 3.80 Kilhn] ai-rc [sc. 7r 7TL6jCKp] 7 I ULloTavtraV uatta tutqta yEAotov EaUTV dvOpWrOv.

This analogy, which sharply contrasts even the most anthropoid of animals with man, is old, as can be seen from Heraclitus, Fr. 82 D.-K., OTLCOIKOV 0 KdAALtaogS alaX(pos dvavOpowv o vEt aV/fldwAAv.40? Thus we conclude this sampling of the "t'dvov i-ycv Awv davOpworo," topos. It would not be difficult to quadruple these specimens, so thoroughly and rigorously anthropocentric had the Greek mind become.41 If a change were to be effected, perhaps the most promising approach lay in taxonomy, the scientific study of the classificati6n of animals (and plants). For such a study, by assigning man a definite place in a larger order of animals, might lead to the conclusion that he was but one (Wov among many. It is known from the accurate represen- tation of animals in the art of earlier peoples that the Greeks were not the first to engage in the careful observation of animal anatomy. But taxonomy as such begins with them.42 Even in Greece the earliest known divisions are casual and rough-hewn. The so-called "koisches Tiersystem," which has been reconstructed from the Hippocratic work Regimen 2.46 ff, is exaggerated. There different varieties of flesh and meat (animals, birds, fish) are listed in order to describe their effect as food upon humans; then the effect of such items as birds' eggs, cheese, water, wine, etc., is described. Such a pragmatic account hardly constitutes, or implies, a formal taxonomy undertaken for its own 40 Pindar, Pyth. 2.72-73 perhaps belongs here: KaAo'S ro TL'wv 7Tapa lTaLalv, EL't KaAo'. 41 Numerous examples could also be adduced from Latin sources directly influenced by the Greek. Suffice to mention, exempli gratia, Pliny's Natural History, preface to Book VII (.. . ante omnia unum animantium . .. uni animan- tium ... uni... uni... uni... uni... uni ... uni...). 42 At least so far as is known at present. If earlier foreign systems existed, they hardly influenced Aristotle's original researches.</page><page sequence="15">The Greek Anthropocentric View of Man 253 sake. For that one must go to Aristotle.43 His zoological works cannot, on the whole, be described as anthropocentric. Solmsen has recently written: "While the Timaeus is anthropocentric, Plato contenting him- self with some very few and very brief glances at other living creatures, Aristotle's biology has the entire variety of animals for its subject. Man, with whom Aristotle is preoccupied in his ethical and political writings, is in the biology just one of the large variety of beings."44 This "new biology" had within itself a potential for diminishing the Greek proclivity towards anthropocentricity. In actuality, nothing of the sort happened. Aristotle himself, apart from the zoological works, reveals a quite anthropocentric outlook, which is concisely summed up in the Politics, 1253"3i-32: I EAEwE01s f1lE'A'clr-ov TWv poWV avOpWTOdS cr-Lv.

In these treatises, as we have seen, man is singled out as a "divine" animal; above all, it is in them that the "man alone of animals" motif occurs so often. Accuse Aristotle of some inconsistency, if you will; there is no doubt of man's special status in all Aristotle's thought. Moreover, he taught explicitly that plants and animals existed for man's benefit, Politics i256bi5 ff: qTEoV T 7aT TE )VTa% Tw^V &amp;WWV EVEKEY EtVatL KCl r CLA a 56ia r6aTV w PJ;TVWV XapLv ... cLvayKacov Twv aVOp(roTWV EVEKEv avTa TaTVa rTETOL7)qKVaL 7)V 4wcnv.

Such dogma was gladly adopted by the Christians who could read in Genesis that God had given man dominion over the rest of creation. It is no accident that the Stoic fragment just cited has been preserved by Origen. Of considerable interest is the fact that the tendency to regard man, 43 Cf. W. D. Ross, Aristotle- (1959), p. I14: "Not only was Aristotle the first person to whom it occurred to collect the available information about the animal species, but he was also the first to undertake the problem of their classification." Ross gives a good summary of Aristotle's views. The difficult question of the Aristotelian classification of animals, which has a literature of its own, does not concern us here. To what extent, indeed whether, Aristotle constructed one consistent taxonomic system is not the point. It is rather that the main outlines of a general division of animals into certain basic orders is discernible in his writings, and that man can be placed into one of these orders. 44 Hermes Io6.1978.479-480.</page><page sequence="16">254 Robert Renehan especially because of his intellect, as quite discrete from animals appears already in the oldest extant works of Greek literature. The anthropocentric attitude is not a creation of Greek philosophy. Here, as often, the professional philosophers merely developed into coherent theory old, half-expressed beliefs deeply rooted in the Greek conscious- ness. In the Odyssey, when Odysseus' men are turned into swine by Circe, the poet describes them as follows: o SE aoviawv Lv 'XOv KE~aAa V TE TPtXGS TE / K - SE/LaS , ctcrlp voVN jv E(LgTdOS -qS"T 7VETc POS -TEp.45 It is not a question of two (or more) different types of vov^, those of men and of animals ;46 clearly the poet sees vo?s, "mind," as something which men have and animals do not.47 A later age might talk, for in- stance, of vois as a distinguishing property of human, as opposed to animal, nature; presumably Greeks of the Homeric period did not yet possess the linguistic equipment for that. Nonetheless they felt it at some level. And if voLs separated men from animals in Homer, it also linked them with the gods. Zeus has a vdos.48 Another subtle distinction of epic usage points up the fact that a real difference was sensed be- tween men and animals. In Homer the (eschatological) vyx74 flies off at death. It has been remarked that in four passages the Ov6~d is described, untypically, as flying away upon death; in each instance the Ovtds- belongs to an animal.49 Snell explains this usage as follows: "people were averse to ascribing the psyche, which a human being loses when he dies, also to an animal. They therefore invented the idea of a thymos which leaves the animal when it expires."50 The Homeric poets, there- fore, tended to think of men as set apart from animals by virtue of their possession of voiVs and .vX". Those are not insignificant differences. Hesiod introduces yet another important difference, Erga 276-279: roi&amp; yalp dv~pu~otcna vo4Lov SLETacE Kpoid'wv, / 1X0Vcn tkEV Kal 77paUl KcL OUUVOL9 7TETE7JVOLS / E(TELV aAA7qAovN, E6TEL OOV 0LK7) caUt /LET aV-Sr / 45 10.239-240. 46 Even if it were, the contrast therein implied would set men off from animals. 4 It is in keeping with Homeric beliefs that man loses vo^is upon death.

Man has &amp;1K9 as a gift from the gods; fish and beasts and birds do not. Centuries later Plato wrote that man had a kinship with the gods51 and that accordingly man alone of animals practiced 81Kqr (supra). In the Protagoras myth it is even stated that Zeus gave justice to men; the words are the same as in Hesiod (322 C Sol0 1q81KiV). The continuity of the tradition is particularly clear here. Examination of Hesiod's standard for the presence or absence of 8tKrq proves revealing. Because they have no &amp;81Kq, other living things, unlike man, eat one another; they are, in a word, cannibals. The Greeks regarded cannibalism with abhorrence; one tends to forget that not all societies do. Herodotus mentions several times a northern race of "man-eaters"; the language which he uses to describe them is reminis- cent of Hesiod, 4.Io6: 'Av"po bdyoL 84 dypud;ara rrcxvrwv dcvOpdrrwv Xovea 0Ea, o"' E  1K-qV VO3 ?OV7oro 7E vc~wo OU8 EV XpEwpLEvoL. Aristotle in the Nicomachean Ethics explicitly describes cannibalistic dispositions as "beastlike" (OpPEL~S , I 148b19).52 Whether Hesiod considered fish, beasts, and birds here as three separate "orders" of animals (to employ a later terminology) or whether the three nouns are used collectively as a poetic periphrasis for ?5a is not apparent.53 Probably he had not reflected one way or the other. The important point is that fishes, beasts, birds, whether one group or three, all go together in opposition to man. From this it follows that for Hesiod the cannibalism consisted either in any animal eating any other (if one group) or in any fish, beast, or bird eating, respectively, any other fish, beast or bird (if three groups). That Hesiod is thinking only of species which are cannibalistic in the strict sense, whereby one member of the species eats another member of the same species, is out of the question. The general, or rather universal, mode of expression in Erga 276 ff excludes that. Any lingering doubts can be removed by reference to the fable of the hawk and the nightingale in Erga 202 ff (two different species of birds). But if this is so, then Hesiod has a point of view toward animals drastically different from ours. For a fox to eat a hare, an eagle to eat a 51 That men were actually related to the gods is an old Greek belief; see Hes. Erg. io8; h. Apoll. 335-336; Pindar Nem. 6.1 ff. Philosophical teaching about the kinship of man with the divine had its ancestors. 52 That cannibalism was thoroughly abhorrent to the Greeks from early times is clear from II. 4.34-36, 22.346-347, 24.212-213 (to say nothing of the Laestry- gonians and the Cyclops); see also Xen. Anab. 4.8.14. For cannibalism as a feature of primitive life in the theories of the classical period see W. K. C. Guthrie, In the Beginning (Ithaca, 1957) p. 95 with n.i. 59 One cannot be sure whether Hesiod knew the word ?W-ov; most likely he did. It is first attested in Semonides (Fr. 13 W.), from whom Hesiod is not that far removed in time. The argument from silence would be worthless here.</page><page sequence="18">256 Robert Renehan chicken, a shark a tuna - these are to us no more examples of cannibal- ism than for a man to eat the same items. And if an eagle is a cannibal for eating a rabbit, a man is more so, for he is more closely related to the rabbit. Hesiod can escape the charge of illogicality only if we recognize what his premise was, that all animals (or all fishes, beasts, birds) constitute one broad class (or three) on a par with man, so that mutual conduct within the group is equivalent to mutual conduct among men. Presumably when a lion eats a deer, it is comparable, say, to a Greek eating a Trojan. This is not to say that Hesiod had thought all this out. Quite the contrary. His unconscious, doubtless inherited, inclination toward animals was to lump them all together when brought into explicit connection with man. Plato was to do the same thing; see especially Polit. 263 C (supra, p. 241). This is the real significance of the passage. It demonstrates a rigid polarity, one in which man clearly appears superior. He has &amp;K-7.

This is the only place in early Greek literature where 38K is attributed to animals. The testimonium counts for nothing, not because it is unique, but because it occurs in afable, that of the fox and the eagle. It is normal practice in fables to represent animals behaving like humans, with human values, usually to inculcate some moral lesson. Nothing whatsoever about the actual attitudes of a people toward animals can be inferred from their use of such fables. For the present question the most significant thing about fables is that they are rare in the remains of early Greek and never seem to have been fully accepted into the corpus of serious literature. The simplest explanation of this is that the con- descending attitude of the Greeks toward animals prevented them from elevating the genre. It seemed too homely to them. Man had to remain on center stage. We have made a long journey backward, from late Byzantine scrib- blers to Homer and Hesiod. The results of this survey may perhaps throw a little light on some of the directions which Greek religion and philo- sophy took. First, there is the widespread sociological phenomenon known as totemism. Central to this is a belief that a given clan or tribe is descended from, and is akin to, a particular animal or plant, which accordingly enjoys special treatment from the group in question.</page><page sequence="19">The Greek Anthropocentric View of Man 257 Strenuous efforts have been directed toward the discovery of totemism in Greece.54 Nilsson, for one, has opposed this vigorously: "It is unproved and doubtful whether totemism ever existed among the forefathers of the Greeks, and, if it did exist, the totemistic ideas and rites were transformed under the influence of a new world of ideas, in particular agrarian ideas, so that they can no longer with certainty be pointed to as totemistic."55 The great historian of ancient religion has put his finger on it. If ever the ancestors of the Greeks practiced tote- mism, their beliefs have changed so drastically as to make the original concepts no longer recognizable. Nilsson mentions the influence of agrarian ideas, and rightly so. But whether the Greeks never had totemism at all or rather suppressed it, in either case a fundamental factor surely was their "elitist" attitude vis-a-vis animals. In sharp contrast to numerous peoples all over the world, they objected to having animals as relatives. With theriomorphism, the representation of deities in animal form, the situation is even clearer. Not that therio- morphic gods did not exist in Greece; old ways die hard. But there would be little point in tallying up the animal gods found there. Place theriomorphism and anthropomorphism in the scales and there is no doubt which would tip the beam. The contrast with Greece's neighbor Egypt, to go no further, is obvious. The Greek view of man as an intelligent being, set apart from the animals and even, in one or other sense, akin to the gods, created a climate most favorable for the develop- ment of anthropomorphism. And develop it did, more fully and consis- tently than anywhere else. There is a bon mot to the effect that in the Homeric poems three categories of human beings appear --the commoners, the nobles, and the gods. Aristotle recognized the pheno- menon long before: wITrrp 4 Se Kl&amp; t r Ea'7 LVTOq J 9vOFlOLOVUltV OL  Op7TrrOL, OVTW Kai TOV9S LOUS 7TCV e OE.56 The Greeks could conceive of none better in whose image to fashion the gods than man himself. The chief anthropomorphic gods of the Greeks were not characterized by the grotesque or exaggerated features found so commonly in the gods of other peoples;57 they were rather paragons of physical human beauty. In their conduct they were, alas, all too human. In short, anthropo- morphism was brought to perfection by the Greeks and therein, para- doxically, lay the seeds of its destruction. Their gods had become too much like men to be accepted as gods. The attacks of Xenophanes and 54 For an amusing sketch of a typical attempt see W. K. C. Guthrie, The Greeks and Their Gods, p. 22. 55 A History of Greek Religion, p. 78. 56 Pol. I252b26--27. 57 Such representations of course are not unknown in Greece.</page><page sequence="20">258 Robert Renehan others on the anthropomorphic deities are well known and need not be rehearsed here. At the obvious risk of oversimplification I shall set out the historical sequence quite baldly. Had not the Greeks held the severely anthropocentric view of the world which they did, with its unequivocal and untypical elevation of man over animals, anthro- pomorphism in Greece would never have reached such a perfectly developed state. And had not anthropomorphism so evolved, traditional Greek religion would not have been vulnerable to the devastating attacks made upon it by reflective men, who now found themselves confronted with a momentous choice to make. They could either abandon all belief in the gods, or they could assume the difficult task of creating new theologies. Almost without exception they chose the latter. Vlastos has observed, "When one reads the Presocratics with open mind and sensitive ear one cannot help being struck by the religious note in much of what they say. Few words occur more fre- quently in their fragments than the term 'god.' "58 In a remarkably short period of time Plato and Aristotle, building upon - and departing from - the foundations of their predecessors, were to work out the concept of an incorporeal deity, a concept which remained fundamental in Western theology for over two thousand years. But that is a different story59 and it is time to conclude this one. I can think of no better conclusion than the words of a Stoic fragment: oirK oi'v vaOp7roELw&amp;s d' 0Eds.60 All things considered, that is a surprise ending.61 UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SANTA BARBARA 58 Philosophical Quarterly 2.1952.97 = Studies in Presocratic Philosophy, ed.

The problem is of course far more complex than that and the emphatic, not to say curt, language of my concluding paragraph is intended merely as a corrective to certain failures to take adequate cognizance of this important factor. For detailed treatments of the whole question see W. Jaeger, The Theology of the Early Greek Philosophers (Oxford, 1947), and G. Vlastos' valuable commentary on that work, "Theology and Philo- sophy in Early Greek Thought" (Philosophical Quarterly 2.1952.97-123-- Studies in Presocratic Philosophy, ed. Furley and Allen (New York, 1970),</page><page sequence="21">The Greek Anthropocentric View of Man 259 pp. 92-129.) Vlastos finely observes "the unique achievement of the Presocratics as religious thinkers . . . in a word, lies in the fact that they, and they alone, not only among the Greeks but among all the people of the Mediterranean world, Semitic or Indo-European, dared transpose the name and function of divinity into a realm conceived as a rigorously natural order and, therefore, completely purged of miracle and magic." (PQ p. i 16 = Studies p. ix 9.) But such an achieve- ment was inconceivable so long as thinkers (such as Hesiod) could still accept anthropomorphic deities. Their philosophical teachings prove that even the earliest Presocratics no longer found anthropomorphism adequate. Xenophanes is not the first thinker to reject it; he is rather the first (of whom we know) to undertake a positive attack upon the anthropomorphic gods. That is, the argu- ment in the text that fully developed anthropomorphism was one direct cause of the first philosophical "theologizing" is not open to chronological objections. (Vlastos' criticism of Jaeger's use of the term "theology" [PQ pp. Io-Ilo3 = Studies pp. 98-99] seems a bit over-subtle to me; whatever the historical origins and connotations of the Greek word 0QoAoy a, the English word "theology" (and German Theologie) is not at all misleading in such a study. For the history of the Greek word see the references in The Cambridge History of Later Greek and Early Medieval Philosophy, ed. A. H. Armstrong (Cambridge, 1970), p. 429 n.4).</page></plain_text>
