MITROFF University of Southern California This paper extends the concept and method of stakeholder analysis, show- ing that the deeper symbolic aspects of human systems can be understood in terms of a special set of stakeholder entities known as archetypes. Arche- types are the most basic symbolic images that the human mind is capable of having and of experiencing. Archetypes and their associated properties are radically different from the kinds of stakeholders that are discussed in the typical analyses of social systems. It is both a truism and a commonplace to say that human systems are inordinately complex. It is far less of a truism and a commonplace to attempt to say more precisely of what this complexity consists (Dewey, 1960). The recent works of Burrell and Morgan (1979) and Morgan and Smircich (1980) shed valuable light on the more precise nature of the com- plexity that researchers face in studying human systems. These works argue that the "reality" of human systems may be studied from a number of radically distinct research perspectives. Each perspec- tive is valid within its own tradition of social science and from its own set of assumptions. The complex- ity of human systems thus not only derives from the complexity of human phenomena itself but also from the complexity of reconciling and/or integrating very different and diverse research perspectives. The very existence of sharp differences among research per- spectives is itself evidence for the complexity of human systems! The research community itself can be considered as a human system that exhibits many of the complexities of the very systems it purports to study! This paper attempts both a partial synthesis and a further development of three perspectives in par- ticular considered by Burrell and Morgan (1979) and Morgan and Smircich (1980). These are: the pheno- menological, the ethnomethodological, and social ac- tion theory research traditions. The central or uniting concern of the paper is a deeper elaboration of the complex ways in which humans construct symbolic meanings (images) of themselves, their institutions, and their environment. Of necessity, a significant part of the approach is psychoanalytically "based" or "derived." The words "based" or "derived" are stressed. The concern of this paper is not with traditional psychoanalytic theory per se, nor is it based solely on it. Rather, psychoanalytic theory is merely a jumping off point, as it were, to analyze the deeper sets of symbolic meanings of complex social systems that humans develop of themselves in relationship to such systems. The author's approach also is based on consid- erable philosophical analyses. As Burrell and Morgan (1979) and Morgan and Smircich (1980) show, the more one is concerned with the symbolic meanings and foundations of human life, the more one is driven inevitably to discuss philosophical matters. The sphere of symbolic action is fundamentally con- cerned with the determination of the appropriate assumptions to make in explaining social life. Hence recourse to philosophy is necessary at some point. Because the primary concern of this paper, however, is not with philosophy per se, an endeavor has been made to hold the philosophical analysis to an ab- solute minimum. An attempt has been made to give some brief but concrete examples throughout to demonstrate the insights to be gained from this type of analysis. The type of analysis is known as arche- typal (social) systems analysis, or ASA for short. 387</page><page sequence="2">Towards A Theory of Organizational Emotionality ASA is fundamentally a concept of human emo- tionality as it manifests itself at the level of the in- dividual, the group, the organization, and alternately at the level of society or institutions (Berg, 1979). Above all, it also is a perspective regarding how these different levels of human emotionality relate to and influence one another. For this reason, the basic "elements" that ASA treats are highly personalized stakeholders or human characters. They are unlike the elements that alternate traditions of social science treat (e.g., cybernetics, open systems theory, behav- iorism), which typically are abstract states or deper- sonalized entities, whether they be individuals, groups, or institutions (Burrell &amp; Morgan, 1979; Morgan &amp; Smircich, 1980). The entities of ASA are highly charged, affective-ridden, intensely human personages. There exists an extensive variety and wide array of psychological and psychoanalytic evidence that affirms that the deepest layers of the human psyche, experience in groups and organizations, are both experienced and consitituted (i.e., given sym- bolic meaning) in terms of intensely human, if not anthropomorphic, characters (Berg, 1979; Bet- tleheim, 1977; Bramson, 1981; Corsini, 1979, 1981; Frye, 1973; Gibbard, Hartman, &amp; Mann, 1978; Hill- man, 1975; Jacobi, 1959; Jung, 1973; Maccoby, 1976; Nichols, 1980; Neumann, 1954, 1963; Ogilvy, 1977; Parsons, 1970; Slater, 1966, 1970; Thompson, 1971). These characters assume a staggering, if not bewildering, variety of shapes and forms-from ac- tual historical personages (i.e., concretely existing "real" people) to such theoretical abstractions as social and institutional roles, archetypal images, and symbolic figures. No matter what their particular form and shape, the reason they are personified and anthropomorphized is that they help people to cope with and, in a sense that is meaningful to them, to relate to the intense fears, frustrations, hopes, humiliations, and joys that humans, because they are human, experience. The Rorschach responses of executives suggested that one of their most repressed feelings is humiliation at having to perform for others-from parents and teachers in childhood to the admired superiors at work-to be vulnerable and judged by them no mat- ter how much the corporate policy emphasizes "respect for the individual." For example, on [Rorschach] Card II, a corporate [VP] first saw two performing elements, symbolizing strong and proud animals that had been trained and humbled. His next response was running tears of blood, symbolizing sadness, impotence, powerlessness, followed by rocket exhaust and flames, symbolizing phallic resistance, anger, hardening. He agreed with me that they represented the experience of castration and that it had led to compensatory toughness. Unlike the farmer or craftsman, the manager always remains in some way the school boy who is being judged on his perfor- mance. (Maccoby, 1976, p. 117). Even though humans may distance themselves in their waking (i.e., conscious) life from their problems by forming depersonalized abstractions of them, their unconscious (e.g., dream) life shows a profound tendency to compensate for and counterbalance this tendency. What has been dealt with by day in deper- sonalized terms is dealt with or related to at night in highly personalized if not anthropomorphic terms. In a word, the things that people must cope with are so intense that they cannot be kept at bay or hand- led by cold abstractions alone. Although such ab- stractions may be necessary for theoretical under- standing in the sense of the cybernetic and open system traditions, they are not sufficient for day-to- day coping in human terms. They do not provide the degree of emotional comfort that is needed in cop- ing with a precarious and often terrifying world (Jaynes, 1976). A set of important questions arises: Is there a single set or type of characters that pertain to the different levels and kinds of human systems, or are there many different types? What are the ordering principles, if any, between and among the various levels? Is there a basic ordering between levels? That is, can the dif- ferent levels of society be arrayed along some con- tinuum? Do different laws or principles of human behavior operate at different levels? Figure 1 shows a "first order" ordering of the various types of human characters and the levels of the human systems to which they roughly pertain. The phrase "first order" is vitally important. The linear ordering-separation and relegation of dis- tinctly different types to different distinct levels-is itself a characteristic feature of those traditions of social science that Burrell and Morgan (1979) and Morgan and Smircich (1980) refer to as cybernetics, open systems theory, and behaviorism or social learn- ing theory. As will be seen, ASA exhibits the feature of the complete, if not radical, simultaneous in- terpenetration of all levels. An understanding of this demands an explication of the different senses and 388</page><page sequence="3">Figure 1 A "First-Order" Ordering of Characters and Human System Levels CHARACTER TYPES( V Archetypes LEVELS OF OPERATION OF TYPES / Group I meanings of the term "interpenetration." First, how- ever consider Figure 1. Character types I, II, and III are the ones most typically dealt with in the traditions of cybernetics, open systems theory, and social learning theory. At the societal level, a society can be construed as the literal sum of its interactions among different broad stakeholder groups and institutions. Different char- acteristic types of institutions can be identified, without which the concept of a modern society would collapse, if not be rendered untenable or meaningless (e.g., law, politics, technology, education, religion, the family) (Bates &amp; Harvey, 1975; Giddens, 1979; Parsons &amp; Shils, 1951). In addition, a host of typical stakeholder groups can be identified that impact on the modern corporation. Examples are one's compe- tition, allies, suppliers, sales force, middle manage- ment, governmental regulatory bodies, professional societies, universities and training institutes, finan- cial institutions, news media, and environmental groups. All of these stakeholders either influence or are influenced by the modern corporation and its policies. That is, they have a "stake" in the organiza- tion because they influence it and help to set the direc- tion of its policies. As such, these and other stake- holders influence the internal properties of the or- ganization, and vice versa. The modern organization also can be said to influence the properties of those stakeholders in its environment. A book by the author and Richard O. Mason (Mason &amp; Mitroff, 1981) argues that a corporation's policies are its at- tempts to cope with an ever broadening array of forces and interest groups with which it must con- sider systematically and deal with successfully or else it will fall prey to them. See Porter (1980) for a com- plementary view. In the traditions of cybernetics or open systems theory, whether at the societal or organizational level, the relationship between the characters (stakeholders) and their properties most often are dealt with in terms of norms, formally prescribed relationships (e.g., legally specified lines of authority, responsibility), or economic transactions. Hence societal, institutional, and organizational behavior tends to be explained, or explanations are sought, in terms of norms of reciprocity, exchange relationships, legal, moral, and ethical codes, and the like. A more sophisticated and interesting variant of this approach at the organizational level is that of Miles, Snow, Meyer, and Coleman (1978). A typology of different organizational forms is constructed, and the behavior of each is explained in terms of its charac- teristic properties. The starting point for an ASA is the type of char- acter as represented by point or region IV in Figure 1. (This is not to say that there is one and only one way to construct an ASA. This paper is suggestive of only one approach. Its purpose is to stimulate other efforts.) One of the major discoveries of modern psychoanalysis is the notion that the human psyche is both literally and figuratively "known through" the various ego-states or internalized characters that "compose" it. That is, the basics, the elements of which the psyche is constituted (on- tology), are known through (epistemology) the man- ner by which the characters reveal themselves. In this sense, the ontology or the structure of the psyche and the method of knowing it, epistemology, are in- timately linked together (Churchman, 1971; Mitroff &amp; Kilmann, 1978). The most familiar form of this notion is Freud's triumvirate, id, ego, and superego. A more easily ac- cessible form, which reveals not only the intensely personified nature of each ego-state but, stronger still, that each is capable of functioning as a nearly autonomous character in its own right, is that of tran- 389 IV Ego-States III Roles II Organizations I Institutions / Organizational nstitutional Institutional</page><page sequence="4">sactional analysis or TA. TA postulates that the three main characters, the parent, adult, and child, can be identified in the functioning and the makeup of the human personality (Corsini, 1979). Each represents a distinct ego-state or character with a distinct set of recognizable properties. These have been described elsewhere in a form that is relevant to organization design and hence to management (Mitroff, 1981). The point here is that, in the language of Hillman (1975) and Ogilvy (1977), the psyche can be construed as a "miniature society, a plurality of selves, each with a significant if somewhat partial existence and life of its own" (Ogilvy, 1977, p. 118). Of all the character types portrayed in Figure 1, those that are signified by the symbol V, archetypes, are the strangest and the most difficult to grasp. It is for precisely this reason that they are the characters that are most centrally at the heart of the construc- tion of an ASA. A simple example may help. Every- one has a concrete, literal set of parents. As part of the process of growing up, as a result of the deep and prolonged emotional and physical dependency of the child on the parents (Brown, 1959), as a fundamen- tal by-product of becoming socialized and thereby "human," the child at first merges and identifies so strongly with the parents or their substitutes that the child literally introjects or takes into the child's own personality parts of the parents' personalities (Wickes, 1966). The child takes in characters from the parents' own psyche or character structure and thereby forms his/her own unique character struc- ture. One's acutal parents contribute to the forma- tion of the parent character within one's own char- acter structure (Klein, 1980). The archetypes lie deeper still within the forma- tion and operation of the psyche. In addition to the parent (or superego) aspect of one's psyche and one's own actual parents, there exists an archetypal, a general symbolic concept of the parents. This aspect or concept is almost totally unknown to most peo- ple. As a result, its profound influence on human af- fairs is almost totally unseen or acknowledged (Jung, 1973). The archetypal concept of the parents is the one that is discussed and revealed in all the great myths, legends, fairy tales, and religions of the world (Frye, 1973). As a result, however, it is the most symbolic, the most difficult to fathom and to understand. In brief, an archetype is the most symbolic, universal psychological image of a character type known to man. Although it can be observed in dreams in the form of mythological characters, it is seen most read- ily through an analysis of comparative world myth- ology, legends, fairy tales, religion, and the like (Bet- tleheim, 1977; Campbell, 1979; Frye, 1973; Girard, 1972; Hillman, 1975; Jacobi, 1959; Jung, 1973; Nichols, 1980; Neumann, 1954, 1963; Ogilvy, 1977; Propp, 1968; Slater, 1966). The more that one ex- amines the great diversity of world cultures, the more one finds that at a symbolic level there is an incredi- ble, if not astounding, amount of agreement among various archetypal images (Neumann, 1954, 1963). The agreement is too profound to be produced by chance alone. It therefore is attributed to a similar- ity of psyche at the unconscious level. These similar appearing symbolic images are termed archetypes. Why does the mind produce these images? What is their purpose, their function? As mentioned, at the most basic level they exist to help man give an emo- tionally satisfying picture of the world. The world is so terrifying to the primitive person and to the child that they need some way of coping with it, of organiz- ing it (Jaynes, 1976). They cannot use the techniques available to the adult. They cannot psychologically distance themselves enough to give a disinterested ra- tional or scientific picture of it. Because they pro- ject their inner fears out onto the world, it is little wonder that some of the most universal and potent archetypal images are those of strange looking demons or animals. They represent mankind's own terrifying internal nature concretized and projected out on to external reality. Literally every aspect of mankind's existence is capable of being turned into an archetypal symbol, image, or character (McCully, 1971). Thus, there ex- ists an archetypal mythological character for every part of man's psyche and social structure. As Ogilvy observes: We modern would do well to reflect on the transfor- mation of the Trinity of Zeus, Apollo, and Dionysus into their more recent mythological counterparts, the superego, ego, and id (1977, p. 141). The key word in the preceding passage is "counter- part." There exists a counterpart or corresponding archetype for every condition, experience, and aspect of man. As McCully expressed it: We posit that the structure of the psyche itself may be something like inkblot structure. Both the substance in Rorschach's inkblots and the substance of the psyche itself provide the conditions which allow im- ages to form around stimuli that are potent enough 390</page><page sequence="5">to precipitate them. Inkblots are as potent as their stimulus power.... We [call] that power arche- typal .... An archetype, or image that represents it... contains the essence of a particular human experience that has been repeated enough to make a permanent but not necessarily inalterable print on neural structure... it does not appear that archetypal patterns are necessarily fixed. Inherent capacities for flexibility may be the chief difference between neural structure in man and other animals. Nevertheless, some of our experiences are so fundamental in existence that one cannot ex- pect the human condition without them.... Archtypes include such prototypal experiences as food gathering, elimination, fertility, father, mother, authority, self, femininity, goddess, eternity, childhood, circle, square, devil (evil), god (good), maleness, and sleep. If we look at the core or essence of a symbol, according to laws pertaining to subjec- tive processes, we will find evidence for archetypal influences. Since all men have created some form of religion no matter where they sprang up, religion should provide us with residues of concrete deposits of archetypal ac- tion. Christ and The Buddha symbolize some essence of archetypal deposit for us, since they are the religious representatives of our era (1971, p. 51). Thus, there are archetypes corresponding to every kind of authority figure, conditions of chance or uncertainty, war, death, occupation, and so on. Each one is an idealized image more pure, more extreme, and bigger than life, as it were, to help one cope with and understand the complexities of life. As Bet- tleheim puts it in explaining the hold that fairy tales have on the mind of a child: Contrary to what takes place in many modern child- ren's stories, in fairy tales evil is as omnipresent as virtue. In practically every fairy tale good and evil are given body in the form of some figures and their ac- tions, as good and evil, are omnipresent in life and the properties for both are present in every man. It is this duality which poses the moral problem, and re- quires the struggle to solve it.... The figures in fairy tales are not ambivalent-not good and bad at the same time, as we all are in reality. But since polarization dominates the child's mind, it also dominates fairy tales. A person [i.e., stakeholder character] is either good or bad, nothing in be- tween.... One parent is all good, the other evil.... Presenting the polarities of character permits the child to comprehend easily the differences between the two, which he could not do as readily were the figures drawn more true to life, with all the complexities that characterize real people. Ambiguities must wait until a relatively firm personality has been established on the basis of positive identifications. Then the child has a basis for understanding that there are great dif- ferences between people, and that therefore one has to make choices about who one wants to be. This basic decision, on which all later personality developments will build, is facilitated by the polarizations of the fairy tale (1977, pp. 8-9). It would be a grave and serious mistake to think that such raw images and projections are absent from the thought of adults. It undoubtedly is true that the historical context of the vast majority of archetypes by now is so far removed from direct experience and daily lives that the traditional images have little if any meaning (Nichols, 1980). At best, they appear biz- arre, as from another planet. At worst, they seem to degenerate into hopeless mysticism. Yet, this is precisely what one must avoid thinking. In order to take advantage of the usefulness, one need not regard archetypes as literally "real" (i.e., actual existing stakeholders). The proper stance towards them is to understand that they serve as pro- jective tests written large and natural in terms of which one can understand himself/herself. Maccoby (1976) points out that such images naturally and automatically crop up in organizational life; as such, they afford a unique, if not novel, way of under- standing organizations and their impact on in- dividuals and vice versa: One of Goodwin's [a "company man"] Rorschach responses expressed the contradition and the lack of grounding for his goals. He saw fish, which he associated with the Christian faith, tied to a couple of court jesters teetering on the top of two docking spaceships. This symbolized his approach to corporate policy, an unstable combination of Christianity and the politics of the impotent courtier resting on technology in outer space. (The court fool tells the truth, but he is powerless.) He also expressed the con- traction between the principles of religion and power in the two historical figures he most admired: "Alex- ander the Great, he affected the future and was a great leader, but understood people and how to bring them together. And Jesus, he changed man without force, showed the power of working with people" (Maccoby, 1976, p. 96). Archetypal Properties Of all the aspects of archetypes, none is more puzzling or strange than its detailed properties. It is these more than any other that promise to shed in- sight on the prospects and difficulties in creating an ASA. Among the questions are: Is the number of archetypes limited or not? That is, can they be organ- 391</page><page sequence="6">ized in closed form in a table or typology? How do they operate? What is the relationship between them? Are they separate entities or are some contained in others? A consideration of these questions will allow an answer to the most important question of all, What is a truer picture than that of Figure 1 of the interrelationship among the character types in terms of which the different levels of human reality are experienced? As mentioned earlier, archetypal images are cap- able of forming around literally every aspect of man's external physical and social existence as well as one's internal psyche experiences. That is, the internal structure of man's psyche is organized in terms of archetypes, and an archetype can be found that cor- responds to each aspect of the psyche. Two of the most systematic and extensive treat- ments of archetypal images can be found in the works of Nichols (1980), and Neumann (1954, 1963). Nichols analyzes in painstaking detail the 22 major symbols that compose the deck of tarot cards. She shows that they can be organized in a format that comes tantalizingly close to a "periodic table of human elements." The "elements" parallel and elaborate on the archetypes mentioned by McCully. One of the most extensive in-depth analyses of a single archetype, the feminine, is that by Neumann (1963). Neumann shows that there is not a single sym- bol or single symbolic expression that stands for the feminine, but that there are many. Even more im- portant, there is not a single feminine archetype, but there are many feminine archetypes, each one stand- ing for the various aspects of the feminine. Thus there are archetypes that stand for the creative and nour- ishing (i.e., nurturing) aspects of the female. There also are archetypes that stand for the destructive and devouring aspects of the female. One of the most in- credible accomplishments of Neumann is his dis- covery that there is a kind of "typology" around which the various archetypes, at least for the femi- nine, can be organized. However, it is a radically dif- ferent kind of typology than those that typically undergird cybernetics and open systems theory. Unlike the typologies of systems states that operate in cybernetics and open systems theory, there is nothing corresponding to a closed set of mutually ex- clusive and exhaustive elements in ASA. The number of archetypes in not fixed, constant, or static. The reason is that the archetypal images themselves are not fixed, constant, or static. "New" archetypes are continually in the making and alteration as man shapes and remakes himself. One can "fix" some of the basic experiences around which archetypes form, but one cannot fix the number or their shape. Indeed, one of the archetypes that always seems to form just when one thinks he/she has captured the "complete set of archetypes" is an archetype having to do with precariousness, randomness, danger, and/or incom- pleteness. This archetype seems to function to alert one that the psyche may never fully succeed in fathoming itself in fixed, static form. Another closely accompanying kind of archetype that also always seems to form is that of the trickster (Jung, 1973). The trickster tries to deceive in any way he can, for example, he can be that part of the psyche that lulls one into believing that he/she knows all about him/herself (knows the full set of archetypes) and then relishes suddenly bringing one up short to ex- pose one's arrogance. In short, although considerable insight can be gained into the broad outlines of the full range of archetypes, complete and definitive knowledge of the full set seems unopen to mortals. Indeed, such knowl- edge is open only to the gods, one of mankind's earliest and most enduring of archetypes (Jaynes, 1976). Complete knowledge, like perfection itself, is an attribute of an archetype. It is not a property of man. The further one delves into the nature of arche- types, the stranger their properties become. In cybernetics or open systems theory, the cells of an explanatory or analytical matrix or typology usually do not contain contradictory properties. This pro- perty generally is not characteristic of archetypes. Although there is a tendency for archetypal images to split into good versus bad, strong versus weak, nurturing versus devouring aspects, as the earlier quote from Bettleheim shows, the split is never com- plete. Thus, archetypes follow a logic that is very dif- ferent from that which typifies the elements of the cybernetic and open systems approaches. Ogilvy has perceived this best of all. He writes: Anaxagoras saw the next step more clearly than most do today. Eleatic philosophy illicitly [emphasis added] extends the logic of visual-tactile percepts [e.g., the law of contradiction] to the logic of concepts. Conse- quently the contingencies of spatial phenomena become the paradigms for all behavior: the fact that two physical bodies cannot be in the same place at the same time is carried over into a much broader princi- ple of noncontradiction. A and a non-A cannot be the 392</page><page sequence="7">case at the same time-which is true enough for predicates [i.e., attributes or properties of things] whose meaning is genuinely founded in the logic of the visual-tactile senses, but false otherwise: a physical object cannot be both round and square in the same dimension at the same time, but it is perfectly possi- ble [for a person and, certainly, an archetype] to be both generous and stingy, both loving and hating, both downcast and elated in quite the same respects at the same time, viz., the experience of dramatic tragedy. Just because perceptual space knows no ambivalence it does not follow that all ambivalence is a sign of con- tradictions to be eradicated in the lucidity of clear vi- sion (1977, pp. 205-206). In short, dealing with a phenomenon as complex as man is not dealing with an entity that is free from contradiction. Contradictoriness is one of the essen- tial characteristic properties of man, groups, organizations, and institutions. An organization can be both big and small, weak and strong, beautiful and ugly, and so on all at the same time (Churchman, 1971; Mitroff &amp; Kilmann, 1978; Mitroff &amp; Mason, 1981). Finally, there is what may be the strangest property of all. In principle, each archetype is contained within all the other archetypes. If the psychic structure of a human being is one that is made up of archetypes, then the psyche of each archetype is made up of all the other archetypes. This is why if an archetype has a dominant set of somewhat seemingly consistent properties, it also has a set of contradictory proper- ties that "intrude" from the other parts of its psyche makeup. The principle is Leibnizian (i.e., philosophical) and goes back all the way to the Greeks: each slice of nature is contained in every slice of nature. Although such a principle may be open to challenge in the physical realm, it seems to be the fundamental grounding and organizing principle for archetypes in the symbolic realm. As Jung put it: "In the unconscious the individual archetypes are not insulated from one another, but are in a state of con- tamination, of complete mutual interpenetration and fusion." Often it is "a well-nigh hopeless undertak- ing to tear a single archetype out of the living tissue of the psyche; but despite their interwovenness they do form units of meaning that can be apprehended intuitively" (Jung, quoted in Jacobi, 1959, pp. 65-66). There are other aspects of the relationship of archetypes to one another that may prove to be the most important from the standpoint of an ASA. This aspect has to do with how the ego-states or archetypes of one indiyidual can link up or affect the ego-states or archetypes of another individual. The mechanisms by which one individual can affect the psyche states of another are well-known from psychoanalytic theory (Corsini, 1979, 1981). They include, among many: (a) compensation, (b) contamination, (c) identification, (d) introjection, and (e) projection. Introjection is an extreme form of identification. Compensation refers to the archetypes that often arise to counter the one-sidedness or extremeness of an individual's conscious cognitive, decision style, or personality. Thus, if one is an extreme thinking type who tends to intellectualize everything, then that per- son may be more susceptible to those archetypes that express neglected or underdeveloped feeling or emo- tional aspects of the person's personality (Jung, 1973). Projection is the process whereby a person projects inner psyche states onto another person, object, or animal. Thus, if one's decision-style or personality is so different from another person's, then the se- cond person may be likely to project unacknowl- edged, and undesired aspects of himself on to the first person. Contamination or containment signifies that, al- though in principle all archetypes are contained in all others, this does not mean that they operate equal- ly powerfully at any given moment for all individuals. Some archetypes literally overwhelm or, better yet, "overshadow" others. Thus, for example, at the ego- state level of transactional analysis, if a person's parent dominates both his child and adult, then the person will tend to be all critic, all work and no play, all serious. Because the child is in an "inferior" posi- tion, the person will appear to have no spontaneity, literally no life. The creativity, fun, exuberance due to the child will literally seem not to exist. The same obviously can accrue to organizations if they are all parent-like and strive to extinguish the child. The unintended result may be the near absence of orga- nizational creativity and innovation. By the same token a person or an organization that is all child and little or no parent and adult is one that has, literally, never "grown up." Two of the most interesting mechanisms by which individuals influence one another are those of iden- tification and introjection. If the introjection is so enveloping and so strong, then one may speak of a symbiotic relationship. This occurs when an ego-state of one person substitutes or functions for an ego-state of another. An example is when the parent of one 393</page><page sequence="8">person functions as the parent for another person whose own parent is either nonexistent or underde- veloped. Now one of the critical challenges and major con- cerns of an ASA finally can be stated. It also is possi- ble to give a concrete example illustrating how ar- chetypes manifest themselves in action. One of the most critical phenomena that cuts across both the fields of organizational behavior and business policy is that of mergers and acquisitions. What does it mean from a behavioral standpoint, especially from the perspective with which it is viewed here, for one organization to merge with another? (The flip side of this question is that of divesture.) When two organizations merge, which "aspects" of the one organization's "psyche" are merged with what other "aspects" of the other organization's "psyche"? In other words, what particular combination of social system stakesholders and individual ego-states must be linked in order for a successful "marriage" to oc- cur? Conversely, what psyche links are broken dur- ing organizational divorce? What archetypal images, however dimly perceived, must be invoked to allow two distinct systems to merge, with or without crucial loss of identity? Unfortunately there are no definitive answers to these questions at this time. However, a paper by Hirsch (in press), "Ambushes, Shootouts, and Knights of the Roundtable: The Language of Cor- porate Takeovers," sheds interesting and needed light on the phenomenon. Hirsch demonstrates that when one large business attempts to take over another, the language in which this is conducted is anything but subdued and impersonal. It reflects all the emotions, fears, and joys that one should expect to find when the spoils of winning and of losing are so big. In the terms of this paper, when one is in a situation that is so rife with potential uncertainty, exhilaration, con- flict, and hard feelings, one should expect to see archetypal imagery used to cope with the intensity of the feelings expressed and to attempt to contain them. Indeed, as Hirsch himself points out, this is one of the fundamental purposes of the language that is used. It helps to insulate both parties, taker and takee, from the intensity of their feelings. The gist of Hirsch's findings is best presented in a brief, summary paragraph: The takeover event in itself clearly conforms to a predictable set of scenarios or scripts. In the most neutral terms, this boils down to offer -decisions/ac- tions taken-outcome [that is, if takeovers were ex- pressed solely in the language of cybernetics or open systems theory]. In the business world, this relatively simple diagram has taken on the far more colorful forms available from such well known popular genres as the western (ambush and shootout replace [the more bland terms] offer and actions taken), the love affair and/or marriage, warfare (replete with sieges, bar- ricades, flak, and soldierly honor), mystery, and piracy on the high seas (with raiders and safe harbors). Generic formulations also entail the frequent ap- pearance of mercenaries or hired guns (investment houses to whom most of the negotiating is delegated), and black and white knights (culled from tales of chivalry in which the distressed damsel is either un- done or rescued). In virtually all formulations, the ac- quiring executive is macho and the target [i.e., the sought to be acquired] company is accorded the female gender ("Sleeping beauty" or a bride brought to the alter; reference to rape also is not uncommon (1983, p. 236). Hirsch further writes: For example, the efforts of American Express to ac- quire McGraw Hill were said by many to test the limits of the normative boundaries for legitimate acquisition tactics: The appropriate genre here, for coding pur- poses, became all-out warfare (1983, p. 237). To take another example, consider the particular but most important social system stakeholder, that of competition. Every organization has some form of competition. This much all might agree with. However, the farther one goes, the more quickly agreement tails off. The nature of one's competition is not the same for all parties (stakeholders) either internal or external to the organization. This is for the basic reason that stakeholders differ greatly in their emotional makeup, cognitive style, or general personality. The most seemingly "objective" observ- er-indeed all the more that a person thinks that he/she is truly objective and hence is unaware as to how his/her psyche actually operates-projects an aspect of his/her internal psyche on to his/her com- petition. The concept of the competition becomes col- ored and tainted by one's own projections, as it were. Unless one has some minimal awareness of how such projections occur and why, one is in danger of con- ceiving one's competition as either worse (more evil, stronger, etc.) or better than it actually is. One's con- cept of one's competition will be psychologically in- fected or contaminated. The study of such issues and questions seems cri- tical to the founding of an ASA. Up to this time the various brands of depth psychology and psychoana- lytic theories have been able to examine only a very 394</page><page sequence="9">limited set of interactions between a very few ego- states. The approach called for is a plea for study of a much wider set of interactions in an attempt to broaden and to deepen knowledge of psychosocial system behavior. A second consideration of Figure 1 further helps to make the point. As a result of this discussion, it is highly tempting and thereby all the more danger- ously false to consider one level of Figure 1. That is, one characteristic kind of stakeholders, as somehow "more real" than all the others. For in- stance, it is natural to infer that the author feels that archetypes are somehow more real or more funda- mental than social system actors. This impression, however understandable, is mistaken. The author has repeatedly emphasized the role of archetypal char- acters in seeking explanations of complex human be- havior only because he feels that a serious and systematic examination of the influence of archtypes has not been seriously attempted before in the field of organizational studies. The author, however, does not regard one level as more fundamental or more real than another. Indeed it is the very failure to regard all levels as equally real and important that, in the author's opinion, has hampered the field from developing more comprehensive, integrated theories of human behavior. A truer picture than Figure 1 would be a circle showing the mutual interpenetration and interaction of stakeholders at all levels simultaneously. If arche- types and ego-states are capable of infusing organiza- tional and institutional structures, of "causing" ar- chaic impulses to break through the most rationally conceived systems, then it also is true that organiza- tional and institutional structures are capable of in- fluencing the development of ego-states and "caus- ing" new archetypal shapes to form. Neither the psychological nor the sociological is more real or more fundamental than the other. (It would be analogous in physics to saying that the world of everyday objects is somehow more real than phe- nomena at the subatomic level or vice versa.) Each is merely the environment and the precondition for the other. A number of major social thinkers, among them Parsons (1970), Slater (1970), and Wrong (1970), have made the point about the mutual interac- tion and interpenetration between the psychological and sociological. The reader is referred to them for more extensive treatments. Concluding Remarks One of the major figures of the field clearly is James Thompson (1967). His work is an outstanding example of the social systems approach. However, there is another Thompson, William (1971), whose work, though generally unknown to organization theorists, has special meaning and significance for ASA. In his immensely provocative and stimulating book, At the Edge of History, Thompson (1971) shows how four archetypal characters, the Hunter or Warrior, the Shaman or Medicine Man, the Clown or Fool, and the Chief, can be construed as the basic building blocks of society and all institutions. Thus, when they are institutionalized and developed fur- ther, as they have been in modern society, the Hunter becomes the Military; the Shaman, the Medical pro- fession; the Fool, the Artist and Entertainment; and the Chief, the Manager and Managerial Class. Thompson shows how over time these four basic archetypal characters have become progressively refined and elaborated into the impersonal, institu- tionalized forms as they now are known. What he does not do is complete the circle, as has been at- tempted in this paper. That is, do institutions exert influence on the inner personalities of men such as to "cause" new archetypes to emerge, to form, as it were, around the symbols that are in tune with the images of an age? This paper has argued, in effect, that the answer is "yes." If this answer is correct, then it promises to shed deeper insight and meaning on the concepts of organizational culture and orga- nizational symbolism. The critical question that an ASA promises to shed light on is: "Precisely what are organizational symbols symbolic of?" The re- sponse developed here has been that symbols are sym- bolic (i.e., expressive) of the archetypes that signify an organization. Thompson's book also causes the present author to raise the following question. If, as has been seen, archetypes are structured such that each is "con- tained" in the other in the sense that each archetype is capable in principle of stimulating the operation of all other archetypes, is the same true of all system stakeholders at all levels? That is, are all system stakeholders somehow (i.e., in some fashion) con- tained in all others? Or, like physics, do stakeholders follow different "laws" at different levels of real- ity? Note that it is not the case that stakeholders at each level do not interpenetrate on another at all 395</page><page sequence="10">other levels. The question is, how far, how deeply do they interpenetrate, influence, and contain one another? It is beyond the purpose and the scope of this paper to address these questions. One thing however is clear. A different methodology is outlined in the works of Burrell and Morgan (1979), Morgan and Smircich (1980), and Mitroff and Kilmann (1978). In a word, the methodology for studying archetypes must be as transdisciplinary as the nature of arche- types themselves (Churchman, 1971). The study of the characters and the forces that so profoundly shape the many and diverse "selves" has just begun (Harrison &amp; Lubin, 1970; Smelser &amp; Smelser, 1970; Swanson, 1974; Turner, 1974).
