<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ramnanuja: Social Influence of His Life and Teaching Kandadai Seshadri Ramanuja, Sankara who lived two centutries before hinm and Madhvacharya, six decades after, form the medieval triumizvirate acharvas of the Vedanta school. Wlhile considerable literature is available on the philosophical content of their teachings, less attention has beetn paid to their social inmpact. This article exanmines the influetce of Ramtanuja 's precept and practice in the masses, focuising on the humanist content of his philosophy. IN Hindu thought, philosophy and theology are not clearly separated as in western thought. The distinction between what we term as 'secular' and 'temporal' is very thin. We do have in the west the philosophies of the Church Fathers, like St Augustine and St Ambrose, which also have both these aspects merging into each other. Religious rituals form the integral components of theology- oriented philosophical thought of Hindu seers. During the very early period of Indian history we have the philosophies of Carvakas and Sankhyas, which did show remarkable indifference to religious discourse and even showed contempt towards them. But they were subjected to suppression by orthodoxy and by the superior logic employed by the later thinkers and thus were rendered almost extinct. Polemic has characterised Hindu thinking, though the universe of discourse of all these polemicists was the same. The same concepts having the same identity of meaning were employed and none tried to repudiate the established frame of reference. Even such revolutionary thinkers, like Buddha or Mahavira, used the same idiom and thus could not go outside their social milieu. Civil law, regarding rights to property, marriage and adoption was highly developed, in contrast to criminal law which was not thus clearly laid down. Social and economic factors did not worry them, since their concerns were with fundamental and universal truths. Questions of a social nature were too trivial for the philosophers, as they appeared too transitory in the context of cosmic questions, to be dealt with seriously. The paucity of writing material also was an inhibiting factor and this may have induced these thinkers to put their ideas in very succinct and terse poetic form, called the 'sutras', which lent themselves to many interpretations adding colour and fascination to the subject. Unlike the Semetic religions, the ancient Hindus did not prescribe only one way but accepted many ways for attaining the truth, which has many facets. Owing to the lack of social commitment, they did not think of remedying social disabilities which stared them in their face, like untouchability or sexual inequality. It would be a truism to say that a historic personage has to be judged against the background of his social milieu and not with the wisdom of hindsight. He would naturally be a victim of the beliefs, customs and ethical norms of the times and to the extent that he is able to transcend them to take his flight into higher levels of thought and action, to that extent he becomes a leadler of his times in the field in which he functions (this is not an alibi for justifying every historic personage!). One who goes ahead of his time will face the risk of being treated as eccentric, or become a martyr, though under the conditions in ancient India, such intolerance was rarely witnessed, as otherwise a Buddha or a Mahavira who went against the established religions and practices, were not only not crucified, on the contrary, were deified. In a way, Hegel's idea about religions "not true in themselves but were ideologies which arose out of particular historical needs of the people, who believed in them", is to be seriously considered. Christianity grew out of slavery, and its proclamations of universal equality served the interests of the slaves in their struggle for liberation. In India of the medieval days, human misery became highly unbearable, inequality of human beings as manifested by untouchability and the caste systems became an insurmountable social barrier, leading religious thought to offer solace, incremental change and promise of a better life in the other world as a reward for being virtuous in the present one. The Bhakti movement, I would suggest, satisfied this historical predicament. There are many works by Indian, western and Japanese scholars on Ramanuja's philosophy.' The social influence he seems to have exercised through his philosophy on the intellectuals on the one hand and the lifestyle that he practised to serve as example to the common masses on the other, I think, have not been sufficiently brought out. There are adulations by devotees and scholastic criticism by those who belonged to the other schools ot thought among the Hindus, both of which miss the essential element in his work, teaching and life. As is well known, Ramanuja lived some time between 1017 and 1137, thus coming about two centuries after Sankara and six(?) decades before Madhvacharya-the three forming the medieval triumvirate acharyas of the Vedanta school, championing the three branches of it - advaita. visistadwaita and dwaita (monism, qualified monism and dualism). All the three were ascetics, having renounced not only the worldly life but also any desire for immortality or worldly fame. They rejected royal patronage and were not influenced by any western philosophy (as some attribute to Madhvacharya: that he was intluenced by Christianity since he spoke of perdition, dualism and realism). Hindu orthodoxy would not contemplate any acceptance of alien thought and whatever was deemed to be worthy of discussion was all indigenous thouglht; whether it be Buddhism, Jainism or atheism. That may have been a defect, since the cross- fertilisation of ideas could have enriched the intellectual content. While they dealt with abstract thought for the benefit of the intellectual discussions, they dealt with more popular ways of worship and rituals for the benefit of the masses, for whom they approved of the worship of images of anthropomorphic forms of gods and goddesses. Sankara' s hymn to Hari-Sankara, 'Soundaara Lahari', and Ramanuja's 'Sri Ranga Gadya'. are examples of the firm belief of these philosophers in idol worship and other rituals approved by the Upanishads and described in the Puranas. MEDIEVAL PERIOD As in every Century, the medieval days in India were dark and exploitation by the feudal elements was unchecked. Religious intolerance reigned supreme as handmaiden of the tyrannical rulers and the feudal edifice on which their power stood. The great kings like Harsha and Kanishka and theirdynasties were extinct, and Buddhism, which they patronised had also decayed. The country was ravaged by barbarians like the Ephthalites among whom was the notorious and much feared Mihiragula, whose fancy was to push elephants down the cliffs. As mentioned earlier, Buddhism decayed inheriting many of the superstitions and practices of the Hindu faith. As H G Wells put it "The faith of the Buddha, which in 292 Economic and Political Weekly February 3, 1996</page><page sequence="2">the days of Asoka, and even so late as Kanishka, was still pure enough to be a noble inspiration, we now discover absolutely lost in a wilderness of preposterous rubbish, a philosophy of endless Buddhas, tales of manifestations and marvels like a Christian pantomime, miraculous conceptions by six- tusked elephants, charitable princes giving themselves up to be eaten by starving tigresses, temples built over nail-paring and the like... And in competition with this Buddhism. intellectually undermined as it nlow was and smothered in gilded decoration, brahminism was everywhere gainihg ground again, as Yuan Chwang notes with regret."2 The decadence of Buddhism was felt not only among the intellectuals but also among the upholders of morality in the society. Apart from this, the Buddhist monks lived in cloistered aloofness in their viharas or monasteries CUt off trom the day-to-day life of the people, while the brahmin lived ubiquitously with the communities making himself ,Available for religious and social occasions which needed sanctification, or for consultation by the common ignorant masses distressed cither due to natural calamities or feudal oppression. This should not be interpreted as Hinduism being vigorous and triumphant, it only means that people were rudderless. This was when Sankara, one of the greatest thinkers of medieval India appeared on the scene (as is the case with everytlhing in India, thle date of his birth is shrouded in mystery and superstition. He was born after the Chinese pilgrim. Yuan Chwang's visit, since Yuan Chwang refers to one Purnavarnian. who was the ruler in 590 AD. who is also referred to by Sankara. On that basis, some sclholars have opined that Sankara must have lived between the 5th and 6th centuries, this itself being very vagUe.)' He had to confront the Budcllhist philosophers andl other schools of thoughlt in an atmnosphere not yet so intolerant of opposition. It is gencrally accepted that Sankara was a prodigy. with indefatigable energy and dynamism coupled with terse logical acumen. He brought the inonistic thought back to the original rigour by condemning all sophistry at the higher realms of philosophy. He is said to have travelled all over Inidia, establishing tour monasteries in the four corners of the country, thus becoiming one of the earliest men to spiritually integrate the country. He acconmplished all this witllin a short lite span. havingc died at the age of 30 or so. While he did bring about some sort of a renaissance to the decaying Hinduism as a religious plhilosophly, much doubt has to be cast on hlis contrlbuition at the social level. He revivecd the caste system. which Buddhism had condemned. He maintained that women were not to be deemed eqIual to men and that the gate to hell was woman, and that the untouchables were not to be taught the holy scriptures. (In fact, he felt that they were unfit for any knowledge.) But, there is an apocryphal story one day seeing an untouchable coming his way he ordered him to step aside maintaining a distance. The untouchable using Sankara's logic, asked whether he should step aside or his 'atman', which is also the supreme atman, should step aside. (Sankara's monism being-the identity of the atman with 'paramatman'-individual soul is but a reflection of the supreme, as interpreted by the axiom 'aham Brahmasmi'. Sankara, then, realising his mistake, fell at the untouchable's feet, acknowledging him to be the incarnation of Lord Siva himself, who had come down to mortify him ol his pride. This indicates that the problem of untouchability was troubling the minds of people. Sankara was catholic in his approach, since he gave equal importance to Vishnu and Siva, who were considered as two manifestations of the same supreme being. He is more famous among the philosophers although others of equal eminence were present. Jawaharlal Nehru in his book entitled, Discover lofIndia, praises Sankara, but makes no mention of Ramanuja (this may be due to the tact that he did not know of Ramanuja; it being improbable that he could have deliberately excluded mentioning Ramanuja). Max Weber has shown a great deal of knowledgeability about Hinduism and its various philosophers and schools of thought in his book entitled Thle Religioni of hidia: The Sociolog)y of Hinduism anid Buddhism.4 (This is in contrast to Marx, who dismissed Hinduism as a worship of the monkey god Hanuman and cow Sabbala and the blood- drinking Kali." His theme was not religion and hence it is not relevant here.) After the passage of the great Hindu kings like Harsha and Kanishka, the country tell on evil days, being victim to every vanldal and aidventurer who plundered its wealth leaving a trail of chaos and destruction. TIhe lslamic incursions which were taking place at the borders of the country spread terror with iconoclastic zeal. The local rulers were either weak or tyrannical or both. since the country had no tradition of resisting a tyrant. The charge of Oriental despotism is true, thoug7h soenetimes, somewhat benevolent. During the earlier period, intellectual pursuits tlourished under the characteristic tolerance shown by the rulers, and Sankara was a product of these times. The social conditions later on were not conducive to these pursuits. It is against this background that the Bhakti movement in India has to be understood. Since suffering could not be overcome, it had to be endured with as much fortitude as possible, placing immense faith in the intervention of the Almighty. The famous verse of the Bhagavad Gita, says that "God will descend to the earth whenever evil triumphs, to punish the wicked and save the humble" (that it also admonishes weakness and exhorts people to resist evil, is beside the point). Abject obedience to destiny sapped the spirit of resistance. Suffering itself becomes endurable when the mind is engaged in the thiought of god and man lives in the state of divine ecstasy, experiencing the beatitude of his communion with god. Suffering, to this state of mind, is illusory and ephemeral in the context of the illimitable vastness of creation. COMING OF RAMANUJA Twelve great savants called 'alwars' preceded Ramanuja. These were great devotees who sang in praise of the Almighty in total surrender unto Him. They wrote not in Sanskrit, the language of the elite, but in Tamil. These writings are considered to be exquisite works of poetic beauty. Not all of the alwars were brahmins. One was a woman, another an untouchable, and yet another whose origi ns were n-ot known. Thirumangai Alwar robbed the rich and fed the poor, and built the famous temple in Srirangam on the banks of the river Kaveri. One of the alwars was a king-philosopher who composed his verses in Sanskrit. The most important alwar was called Nam-malwar whose four works in Tamil were considered equivalent to the four Vedas in Sanskr-it. The lyrical quality enriched the Tamil language, apart from their devotional content. In the days when only Sanskrit was the recognised elitist language, like Latin in Europe of the Middle Ages, Ramanuja departed from this established practice and accorded importance to these works of the alwars. They were called the four thousand 'prabandhas', which were made official hymns in the Vaishnavite temples along with the Vedic prabandhas. In temples that did not belong to the Vaishnavite tradition, Sanskrit was the only language of prayer. Therefore this recognition to Tamil was a sort of unostentatious protestantism of the Hindu religion. It is comparable to the use ot the Bible in the local laniguages instead ol the Latin version. Prayershlould be brought to the popular level and not be confined to the elite, namely, the brahmin literati. Ramanuja was brouiglht up in the orthodox brahmin traditions. He mastered all the classics in Sanskrit at an early age. When he was studying tinder a famous guru called Yadava Prakasa. who was running a school in Kanchipuram, he differed with his guru over the meaning of a line in one of the Ecoinomic and Political Weekly February 3, 1996 293</page><page sequence="3">U'Panishad.s. This angered his guru who ignored the correction Ramanuja made of tlhe interpretation.' He differ-ed from his guru again on a line in Taittr-eva Uamnishad, which reads - 'satyam, gnanam, anantham Bralima' (truth, knowledge, eternity). Yadava Prakasa, according to the adwaita line of Sankara, identif'ied these as god himself. RaimanuLja maintained that these were the necessary attributes of god, not god himself, as inseparable qualities of an object do not become the object itself: the rays of the sun are an inseparable part of the sun, but not the sun itself. The story goes that the guru became so jealous and fearing his authority might be questioned, schemed to kill Ramanuja. The plot was revealed to Ramanuja, wilo escaped, leaving his guru for good. Ramanuja, without showing any disrespect to his gLuru, Yadaiva Prakasa, sought anothier guru called Kanchipurna, who was a non- brahhmin. For a brahmin to pay respect to a non-brahmin and Adopt him as his guru was again a very revolutionary act in those days. Kanchipurna was hesitant to accept him, but Ramanuja insisteIt. as even at that early age he felt that tor true knowledge, caste was no bar. Formal Icaining was like the donkey carrying valuable things without knowing their worth. While with Kanlchipurtna. it so happenied that whille Riamanuja was away. Kanchipurna was served food by Ramanuja' s wife, who discarded the remainina food and cooked separately tor her husband, as a non-brahmin was permitted to eat only alter the brahmin. This act infuriated Ramianuja. On another occasion. Ramanuja brought a poor starvingJ sudra to thle house and I.asked his wife to serve himi lood. She lied sayintg tllat there was no tood lelt hut Ramanujja went into the kitchen himielf and toudlll food, which he then gave the poor starving man, showing nio anger towarcls his wife. In Srirangam, a tamous saint called Yamunaicharya, who was on his deathi-bed. heard ot Ramanuja and wanted very nIuch to see him. One Mahapurnia, who was also a non-brahmin, was sent to fetch Ranmanuja to Srirangam. But beflore RamanuIja could arrive at Srirangam Yamunnachar-va passed away leaving his disciples withouti aleader. It was then decided at the mlnilastery at Srirangarm to initiate Ramalnuja as the future guru. Mahapurna set out to Kanchipuram to tetclh Ramianuja: meanwhile Ramanluja hiimselt'was travelling, towards Srirangain and they met accidentally in a place called Mathuranthakami. Ramanuja insisted thait Malhapurna should initiate him into the vaishinava fold immediately, in spite of protests ronm Mahapurna that he was a i1on-braminili and as suchl not tit for the honour ol initiating a great scholar and brahiminl. The initiation waws thlen performed in the temple complex - branding of the shoulders with Vishnu's symbols of discus and conch. Ramanuja was to learn the Tamil 'prabandhas' of the great alwars from Mahapurna. RAMANUJA'S HUMANISM A striking quality of Ramanuja's was his intense humanism-compassion, charity and utter contempt forcaste superiority. Suffering of any sort moved him. To him, god was the personification of kindness to both saint and sinner. This is similar to the Christian virtue, but it should not be concluded that Christianity had influenced him, since no Hindu phi losopher looked to other countries for inspiration. The true ornaments of a vaishnava, according to Ramanuja, are the qualities of mercy and kindness. His old guru Yadava Prakasa himself sought his kindness which was given in full measure, though he had suffered a great deal as his disciple. It was the custom in India for the monks to be celibate, like the Roman Catholics. But Ramanuja did not prescribe celibacy as mandatory for being a guru. He believed a person should live as a householder, attaining intellectual maturity and scholarship before taking to orders as this enables him to understand the diftficulties of f;amily life, making him abettercounsellor. He did not discriminate on the basis of sex, caste or position, to bestow his benediction upon any seeker of knowledge. This is where he dif fers f'rom Sankara, who instittited rigorous behaviour in conformity with orthodoxy. Sankara did not concede that non-brahmnins could attain salvation. The non-brahmin was not worthy of learning about the ultimate Brahman. In his 'bhashya' (commentary) of the 3ra/inma Sittra. Sankara says that the 'sruti' prohibits a sudra from learning or knowing about the Vedas or even performing the rituals (111-38). But, he concedes that the other castes canl aittain salvation through easier means of learniing the 'itihasas' and 'puranas'. Commentingon this line, Ramarnuja says that this position should be rejected. He subtly suggests that sudras are equally qual i fied for the knowledge of the Brahman, his initiators Kanchipurna an(d Mahapurna being nonl-brahmins. He mentions, as conduciveto the attainment of knowledge, certain practices not exclusively connected with 'asrama', such as quiet recitation of prayer ('japa'), f astirng ('upavasa'), charity ('daana') and propitiation ofdivinities ( 'devata aradhana' ).7 One of the most spectacular actions of Ramanuja maty be mentioned in detail. There was an old saintly person much respected by the people for his scholarship and simplicity called Goslhtipurna. Ramanuja heard about his greatness and wanting to be initiatled into further knowledge of the sacred texts, he sought discipleship under Goshtipurna. When Ramanuja approached him for the first time, the old man was unhelpful and refused to take him as his disciple to teach the mantra he wanted. Ramanuja was disappointed, but after some time, he approached Goshtipurna once again only to be rebuffed. But Ramanuja did not give up and he persisted, visiting him 18 times. The old sage relented, convinced of Ramanuja's sincerity and taught him the mantra, warning him very strictly not to reveal it to all and sundry as violation of this oath would entail Ramanuja being thrown into hell permanently and his head broken to pieces. Ramanuja accepted the oath, but after leaving the old sage's dwelling, he came to a place called Tirugoshtipuram, and announced that he would be giving the most sacred mantra to everyone the next day. Ramanuja felt his oath was against the principles of Vaishnavism, which did not prohibit anyone from enjoying thle bliss of heaven, whatever the caste or sex or community. This news reached the people in the surrounding places and the next day thousands of people gathered at a temple since they all wanted to be blessed and attain salvation. Ramanuja, from the top of the temple tower, addressed the huge gathering, making them repeat the hloly mantra with him. This action of Ramanuja was in open defiance of all orthodox brahminical injunctions in general, and an insult to the old scholarGoshtipurna. Ramanuja was then summoned by Gosshtipurna and berated for this act of blasphemy and betrayal of trust and was cursed to go to hell. Ramanuja did not flinch. He calmly and gently replied that if his going to hell meant salvation tor the thouLsands upoil thousands who had heard the exposition of the mantra, it waIs hut a small sacrifice on his part which he was willing to make gladly. This answer moved the old saint so deeply that he emnbraced him for showing such kindness to fellow humanis and called him 'emperumanar' (our god). No brahmin guru, before Ramnanuja's time, had ever done anythinig so unorthodox. From the contemporary point of view, this may not be very significant. But given the times and the strong faith people had in salvation or moksha and the fear of punishment in hell this simple act ot sharing the joy of chanting a mantra is of great significance. It demonstrates the depth of human concern that Ramanuja had. It is an act of defiance against the prevailing orthodoxy. There were tlle other guruis belonging to the adwaita school of thought who must have been outraged. This act also has another significance: like the Buddha or Jesus, Ramanuja was involving the masses in action. Divine mysteries were no more the exclusive posses.sion of the elite. 294 Economic and Political Weekly February 3. 1996</page><page sequence="4">One of the important disciples was a sudra called Urangavalli. Ramanuja observed tJrangavalli admiring his wife's beauty, and asked him why he was so madly in love with her. Uraangavalli replied that her eyes were so bewitching that he could not turn away from her. Ramanuja then said that he would show him more beautiful eyes - the eyes of Lord Ranganatha, which were eternally beautiftul unlike hiis wife's eyes which would wither with age. Divinity is beauty and is eternal. Some of Ramanuja's disciples were jealous ot Urangavalli, who in spite of being a sudra, was shown so much consideration. Getting to know this pettiness of his disciples, Ramanuja one day told them to steal Urangavalli's wite's jewellery while she slept. As they were doing so she moved and fearing that she would wake up, they ran away to report to Ramaniuja. At that moment, Urangavalli aind his wile came to give Ramanuj a tha remaining ornanents, begging hiim to give them to his disciples, who had not been able to take them though she had moved to enable them to take everything away. Ramanuja then chided his disciples, to whom it was mnade clear why he was so fond of' Urangavalli. (This incident bears similaritv to the episocde in Victor Hugo's L's Miseubles. w where the priest runs with the other candle stick to give to the fleeing Jean val Jean. A case of turiniilg the other cheek.) Ramanuja said that Urangavalli was a real vaishnava, not those who were born brahmins. calling, themselves vaishnavas. Another attempt on his life was made by one of the jealous brahmins. Ramanuja, like all Hindu saints, ate wlat was offered by his disciples. Tli.s particular brahmin mixed poison in thle food and asked his wife to give it to Ramanuja ftr his 'bikshai' (mendicant's lood offering). As Ramranuja was about to take it, the woman feelineL reinorse fell at his feet begging pardon. Ramanuja did not exprcss any anger, but smilinigly blessed them. There are a number of such incidents where in one can tind acts of supreme kindness similar to tilose of Jesus. Raina-inlija' S attitude towards untouch- ability is the aspect more thlan any other that has great siginificanice today. Raimanuja is unique anmong the hraihinin saints in this respect. Kulothunga Chola. the king ot southern India at the time ol Ramnanuja, was a fanattic and a tyrant who did not tolerate any worship of Vishnu. (K A Nilakanta Sastri, an eminent historian of south-India, does not think that Kulotlhunga Chola persecuted the vaisshnavites. But ancient vaishnavite tradition maintainis that, Kuresa. who pI-etcinded to be RamnanUija. had his eyes gouIged and w1as mneted out a terrible piunishinitit. Thle valishnavites called Kulotlihunc Ch(ola, 'Krimikaniltai Chola' (man Withl worms in his thlroalt). If Nilalkantal Sastri is correct, one cannot explain Ramanuja's flight to Mysore and other chain of events.) He wanted to imprison Ramanuja and kill him if he did not change his belief in Vishnu. The vaishnavites fearing the worst tried to escape from the kingdom. They were given refuge and protection and shown hospitality by some of the untouchables. Ramanuja, moved by their kindness called them the 'thirukulathar' which loosely translated from Tamil would mean "the men of the holy caste". As a further reward for their act of kindness, he threw open the doors of the Melkote temple to the untouchables, centuries before India did this under the inspiration of Gandhi. Gandhi called them harijans (which bears more or less the same meaning as thirukulathar). On the day of the important chariot festival in Melkote, it is still the right of the untouchables to pull the chariot first. These acts have to be viewed in the context of the times and not dismissed as of no consequence from the modern point of view. Ramanuja was said to be fond of one of the alwars, who was an untouchable, called Tiruppan Alwar. He was also known to visit a poor untouchable in his hut since he was a great devotee of god. For Ramanuja caste and other disabilities did not matter if the person was a genuine bhakta. On one occasion, Ramanuja happened to pass by some children playing in an imaginary temple, conducting its festivities. The children stopped him and asked him to pray before their toy image. Ramanuja, to the astonishment of his followers, prostrated before their image, took the offerings that the children gave him with all seriousniess aind devotion. When questioned as to why he took child-play so seriously, he replied that childen should be taken seriously since god lives in them. D[iFERENCES WITH-{ THlE ADVAITA PHILOSOPHERS Ramanuja maintains that the material world is real and not illusory, 'maya', as Sankara argued. Ramanuja does not accept the concepts of 'avidya'. identity of cause and effect an(l the theory of unqualilied monism, that atman a and paramatman are identical, expressed in the maxim 'tat twam asi'. which translated would mean 'that thou art'. This idenitification of the divinity with its attributes is rejected. Sotme have likened Shel ly's stanza in 'Adonais' as suipporting this unity of the soul with the supreme. It reads: Life like the dome of a many coloured glass stains the white radiance of Eternity In fact this passage seems to support the philosophy ot Ramanuja, which says that the reflection on the coloured dome is not the white brilliance but only a reflection, an attribute ofa ny brilliant light. Alfter Sankara's death many began to pervert this maxim aInd sought to justify their actions on the basis ofpre-determination. taking no responsibility for their acts. As Homer said Oh cursed mankind, whose wills created free Charge all thy woes on divine decree Only when you realise your 'self' you can claimn identity with the eternal. This requires a great deal of penance. Oneness is not an unqualified oneness, but has to be achieved by a being who has autonomy for his acts and to that extent has to bear the consequences of his acts. Thus he denies illusion and in the western parlance he may be called a materialistic theist or a spiritualist. Since everyone is to a great extent responsible for his acts, there is an opportunity given to human beings to better themselves whether he be a brahmin or an untouchable. Thus an untouchable can become a brahmin and vice versa by his own actions and not merely by birth, though initially this cannot be avoided. Hence Ramanuja's emphasis is on bhakti and not knowledge or 'gnana', though gnana is not unimportant. There is thus not just a subtle difference between Sankara and Ramanuja, as many Indian philosophers go out of the way to state.' Ramanuja directly repudiates Sankara, and these attempts are merely syrupy. The ancient Hindu philosophers did not mince matters, since polemic formed the essence of attaining the truth. The essenice of the bhakti that Ramanuja emphasised enabled even the humblest to rise above his station and this lorms the revolutionary character of the Bhakti movement in the medieval days. Vedanta Desika, a later follower of Ramanuja, who was a great scholar and logician criticised the advaitins and their 'maya vada in his celebrated critique called Sata Du,slhini (tr Hundrl&gt;etd Criticisms). In the f;ace of these clear enunciations reconiciling the two philosophers is mere eclecticism.' Ramaniuja emphasised the stuLdy of ritual that is part of the 'karma kanda'. Atter that aind only after that. the study of brahman should follow unlike in the case of Sankara for whom gnana not karma kanda is necessary for salvation. Karma and bhakti are closely interlinked, hence the rituals as prescribed have to be perforned as per one's caste and position. This led to too many rituals in the c?reed. In fact, Ramanuja meticulously prepared the manuals of worship in the important temples, detailing the rituals forevery ceremony. As observed earlier, there were always two planes on which he was devoting his works - one was for the intellectuals or the educated elite and another purely devotional, for the masses who could also attain salvation without concerning themselves with the intricacies of abstriact philosophy. As Yoshitsugu Sawai says;: Econominc alnd Political Weekly February 3, 1996 295</page><page sequence="5">Ramanuja's view of Karman must be understood in the light of the theory of qualification of sudras for the knowledge of Brahmaln. Sankara clearly denies the qualification of sudras for this knowledge through the Veda, for sudras are forbidden to study knowledge of the Veda. As Sankara polnts out in his Br ihmasuatrb hhsh va (Liii- 38) siuti prohibits a sLidra fiom learning or studying the Veda and even knowing from its contents or performing vedic rituals. Only the three upper castes can attain mnoksha through a knowledge of the Veda. Sankara however. accepts that all four varnas are qualified ftor attaining the minoksha through the knowledge of the ithihasa and purana liter-atures."' With regard to worship Ramanuja acknowledges only Vishnu as the purushottama and he and only he has to be always meditated upon for moksha. In the temple ritual,he followed the 'pancharatra' system which was not considered authentic by some vedic scholars. Ramanuja, when in Puri, known as the 'purush6ttama kshetra' (The abode of the Lord), wanted to introduce the pancharatra system and in pursuance of it challenged the local scholars for a debate. But they avoided it ancd he seems to have been pllysically removed from the place, which act hie attributed to the displeasure of the lord for disturbing the cuistom in Puri. Yamunacharya. the preceptor of Ramanuja apprtved of the pancharatra system and argued that it was the approved vedic ritual. It deals with the construction 'of temples. rituals in temples, idols, initiation of vaishniavites. their religious marks, etc. It also approves of admission of sudras and women into the scct, which was why the purblind orthodoxy of the Puri brahminism COuld not tolerate Ramanuja. Ramnanuja travelled all the way to Kaishmir to obtain an old text called Bodhavfanta Vi-ili, which was not available elsewhere. This text was mentioned witlh great veneration by Sankara also. It is fromi this document that Ramanuja derives his argument f'or the iimportance of' ritual. As mentioned earlier. Ramianuja's insistence on tie worsilip of only one supreme being, that is. Vishnu. whlo is inicarniate with all the great qualities of divinity ailnd beauty and non-approval of any other god including Siva whom the followers ol Sankara deemn to be Vishnu in a different aspect, is considered to be uncatholic and even sectarianl. He disapproved of the worship of the grotesque forms of gods and the sakti' worship. While Sankara com-nposed many devotionals in praise of both Shiva and his consort Parvati or Sakti and also Vishnu, Ramanuja's compositi)lns wereonly in praise ofVishnu andA his consort Lakshmi. In fact, h1e considlered the grace of Lakshmi to be more important than even the lord's. Hence the followers of Ramanuja call themselves sri vaishnavas - 'Sri' being Lakshmi, occupying the first position, (It may be of interest that only the Hindu religion thought of goddesses. Einstein said that god does not play dice. But Vishnu did, literally, with Lakshmi, since he had a companion in her to play while the Semetic god was single. RAMANUJA IN EXILE Ramanuja was made to flee to Karnataka. Bittideva, a Jaim was ruler of Belur in Karnataka. Ramanuj! converted Bittideva into vaishnavism and christened him Vishnu Vardhana. He built a very ornate and sculpturally magnificent temple dedicated to Lord Vishnu, Adi Kesava, in Belur, which today is a great tourist attraction. In the same state, it was reported to him that a Muslim ruler plundered all the temples and took away the idol of Lord Krishna in Melkote. The story goes that Ramanuja approached him and was allowed to take away any of the many idols lying in his palace. But the young daughter of the king was in love with the one idol of Kishna which was from Melkote and she would not part with it. Later she was canonised as Bibi Nanchar and her idol is also worshipped in vaisnavite temples of the south since she was a great devotee of the lord. The story may be apocryphal but it denotes that even Muslims wcre welcome to the fold of vaishnavas.i Ramanuja wrote the commentary on Brahmasuitra and the Bliagavad Gita just as Sankara did and completed his 'digvijaya', that is holding successful debates with scholars all over India as Sankara did. In fAct, it was the custom ofal I southem scholars to go to Kasi to challenge the scholars there for a discussion, since most scholars in those days were centred there. He wrote the commenitary on the Bodayani Vritli, after having studied it. On Kulothunga Chola death, the new ruler not being intolerant, Ramanuja once again returned to Srirangam where hie lived as the officiatinig high priest of the temple. RamanuLja. as we mentionied, attached a great- deal of importance to varimus rituals as the steppinig stones to later spiritual development. Karma mimamsa antd Brahmna mimamsa are an integrated whole. In his Vedlarha San graha, he mentions that the attainment of the lotus teet of the supremiie being, by means of total surrender, 'I)aralnalnltrusll clar an-1aravindalt ' saranagati and perfoninance of the daily rituals constitute the most inmportant aspects of goal attainment. Hence rituals in vaishnava temples are qulite complex. The idol also occupies an important position, since unlike the Siva linga of the saivites, which is considered as a phallic symbol, the idol of Vishnu has to be beautiful with full ornamentation and floral decoration, so that the worshipper, without stretching his imagination, feels the nearness to the beauty and ecstasy ol the promixity to god, 'snnidhyam'. The lord's kindness is unlimited and to him total devotion has to be bestowed. That is the bhakti aspect, and this was true of Sankara's teaching as well. Though the semetic religions viewed idol worship as heretic, it is interesting to note how Christianity later viewed icons. After the initial fanaticism of the iconoclacist zeal began to fade and in the 6th century, miraculous powers were attributed to the iimiages of Christ. Since god made men in his own image, people saw divine quality in an image and it was argued that in worshipping the images of the saints they were glorifying the Holuse of the Holy Ghost. After the birth of Jesus Christ on earth, in the form of man, the old Mosaic law did not hold good since it was outdated. "If the god- made image of man is divine, then may not a man-made image of god also have an odour of divinity?' Also images of Christ were paraded around the city as protection against fire or an attack by the enemy.'2 Saint John of Damascus argued that god's incarnation as Jesus is itsel fa recognition of the weakness of flesh, of man's need for images. The Christian use of idols was not pagan but simply human." Ramanuja wanted the idols to look brilliant, so that meni can ima-ine the indescribable beauty of divine brilliance. To him, gTod was niot a 'nirguna brahma', an attributeless power. He was not to be like Siva, with necklaces of human skulls, snakes curling round the neck, tiger skin covering the body, with a terrible visage as thle destroyer of the universe. Vishnu looks mischievously with a smiiling face l'manda haasa'), never roused to anger, always forgiving those who repent and seek his lotus feet. Einstein's saying that "god is subtle but mlalicious he is not", would be an appropriate description of the Hindu god, whether it is Siva or Vishnu (or as the popular belief goes Siva in the shape of Vishnu and vice versa. A sloka says, Siva is Vishnu's manifestation and vice versa, which is not accepted by the vaishnavas, who do not believe in dual gods.) Thus we find in the south Indian temples whether dedicated to Siva or Vishnu, festivities when the images are taken out in processions with a variety of decorations and mounts. There are images which are permanently fixed in the sanctum sanctorum and there are the smaller bronze idols, which are for decoration and processions. This is not found in the north Indian Hindu festivities, which makes us think that this could be Ramanuja's contribution. Also, 296 Economic and Political Weekly February 3, 1996</page><page sequence="6">there are famnous temples wlwich possess manuals that have clear descriptions of these rituals written by Ramanuja, in full detail. Divinity, beauty and trutlh are one inseparable whole to the Hindu, as expressed in satyam, sivam, sundaram. Even Hanuman, the monkey god is described as a beautiful personaility ( kamaniya vigraham'). The temple forms the central point of the south Indian village, where village disputes to panchayat elections used to be decided. It must be remembered, unlike Sankara Ramanuja spent most of his life in the south and hence he is relatively unknown to the masses in the north. Ramanuj'a is credited with the initiation of a systematised movement, called by historians as the Bhakti movement. Ramananda. in the north, was under his influence and he followed his mentor in preaching to all castes, high and low, without distinction. Ramananda's disciple, the more well known Muslim suti saint Kabir, spread the message of universal brotherhood of all creations of god, whatever their religion, caste or sex. Kabir was not highly educated, but he could influence society because of his devotion andc message ot love. The Bhakti movement spread from Tamil country to Karnataka. Telugu country, Maharashtra and Gujarat, then to Rajasthan and the Gangetic plains. Maharashtra produced many devotees, who wrote their 'abhangas'; Narsi Bhagat, in Gujarat, wrote the famous Vaishnava Janato', which was the morning prayer song of Gandhi. Mira Bhai of Rajasthan sang many bhajans in praise of Lord Krislhna. Chaitanya, the tounder ot the cult of vaishnavites in Bengal and Manipur, was not influenced so much by Ramanuja (Mladhvacharya's influence is seen in Chaitanya). In the modem age,justice MahadevGovind Ranade, who was one of the great social refornmers from Maharashtra was profoundly influenced by Ramanuja's teaching.'4 Bal GangadharTilak. the first leaderofthe Indian mass movement for independence, whom Sir Valentine Chirol called the 'father of Indian unrest', though not a follower of Ramanuja's visistadwaita but an advaitin, was influenced by Ramanuja in his involving the masses in action and giving importance to the mother tongue, even as Ramanuja gave to his native Tamil. '5 It need hardly be said that Gandhi was indirectly influenced, as he himself was a vaishnava by birth. In opening the temples to untouchables and calling them by a more honourable name, he emulated Ramanuja. "Sankara was only one of the many teachers nearly as great as he, such as Ramanuja (died 1137) and Madhva (? 1197-1276), who founded sub- sects oft the Vedanta philosophical school". '6 Ramanuja claimed that human suffering was not an illusion, as he did not accept the concept of maya. His appeal is to the heart as well. As S Radhakrishnan said, "Ramanluja tried his best to reconcile the demands of religious feelings with the claims of logical thinking". 17 Community participation in the food offerings to god, irrespective of caste, is another aspect of vaishnavism. Whiile among the semetic religious, as Max Weber said, these congregational prayers gave them the strength due to a sense of unity as against pagan religions; in vaishnavism, it did not give that strength, though it did help in creating a sense of togetherness. Congre- gations by themselves do not give strength and unity. There has to be a cementing force of an ideology that preaches unity among people. Social equality was lacking in the Hindu society. The various festivities that Ramanujaorganisedin thetemplesdidindeed serve a social purpose, in the sense that they gave the people an opportunity to vent their teelings and forget their miseries for some time. They were also occasions for matrimonial and other social transactions, since people from far and wide came to these pilgrim places. As in Christianity, the poor are considered to be the rightful inheritors of heavenly bliss, but what about the life on earth? Feudal exploitation, social oppression and political anarchiy caused any amount of misery to which there was no remedy in the hands of the people. It was attempted to mitigate tllis misery by sublimating it into some sort of chiliasm, which can be seen in the later version of the Chaitanya cult of Bengali vaishnavism in the extreme form. Sankara tried to bring about a renaissance in Hindu thinking and reinforce the intellectual content of the vedantic thought. Politically, there does not seem to have been a great deal of degeneration, as in the later days, which became an invitation to the foreign hordes to ravish the country. It is just at this time that Ramanuja came on the scene and preached his bhakti. The stress was on 'prapatti' or complete surrender unto god in total abandonment of ego, as preached in the Blhagavad Gita. "Sarva dharmnan parityajva inamekam sarntaan vraja" (abandon all dharmas and take refuge in me alone), as is thought by many, there may be contradictions, as evidenced in this and the previous inijunction, in the same book asking the devotee to do his duty and "take up arms against outrageous fortune". Incidentally, it is this invocation that inspired leaders like Bal GangadharTilak, to tight against British imperialism. But the Bhakti movement took the total surrender or prapatti as the main principle and people derived the consolation it could give to the irremediable suffering they endured in the days when the movement took its roots. The lndian philosophic tradition also was rooted in the final search towards treedom from the cycle of birth and death and the attainment of a merger with the ultimate; hence doing one's duty was considered as one's avocation, whatever that may be, irrespective of the fruit of labour. Fighting against tyranny was not the exhortation of the vaishnavite saints. Hence they did not abdicate the teaching of ethical behaviour and various rituals that have to be performed during ceremonies like weddings or funerals. In fact, the vaishnavite ritual is more elaborate and cumbersome than of the other sects. The emphasis on rituals by Ramanuja resulted in this cumbersome procedure, which with time overtook the substantial teaching. It would be a truism to say that thought does not spring from a social vacuum and it represents the mores, values, social and physical limitations of the time and place. Hence any comparison with the religious and secular philosophies of the west may be out of place. Moreover, there was never any confrontation of religious institutions, like the Church, with the secular power like the state, in India, which was responsible for a comparatively greater liberty of action enjoyed by an individual in some of the western countries. Inquisitions may not have been there in India, but revolt against political authority was also not known for reasons already given when discussing the role of religion. Hence, to expect Ramanuja or any of the religious thinkers in India to fight social injustice would be out of place. But social injustice was staring them in the face. Ramanuja, to a limited extent, in individual capacity tried to make amends for it as when he opened the Melkote temple for the untouchables, etc. He also did not approve of the ugly practice of tonsuring brahmin widows, as evidenced by the absence of this only among the tengalai sect of vaishnavas. According to Marxist historians, the Bhakti movement was a progressive movement, as it propagated revolutionary thought in those days - that everyone was entitled to the beniefits of knowledge and benediction of the Supreme - in defiance of prevailing orthodoxy. In this respect, Ramanuja was many steps in advance of Sankara. Our purpose is not to compare the relative merits of the theological positions taken by these philosophers but thleir preaching which influenced the n-iases. As Damodaran says, Ramanuja too formulated his doctrines within the bounds of feudalism, yet, his attitude towards the caste system was not so rigid and dogmatic as that of Sankara. He proclaimed that bhakti transcended all caste distinctions, and he stood for equality in the Economic and Political Weekly February 3. 1996 297</page><page sequence="7">worship iof god. Accordling to him all worshippers of Vishnu were equal because all people - highi or low were manifestations of l3rahman.'s Another mnarxist writer from the tormer Soviet Union goes a step lurther. He says tlhat under conditions prevailing in India at the time. this idea had a profound democratic meanling. as it sanctified the struggle against teudal and caste divisions"."' This perhaps is reading too far into marxism. since there was 11o revolt against feuclalism. One must not stretclh Ramanuja's general attitudetowards suffering and caste iinequality too tar. He was not completly for abolition of the caste system or untouchability. That would have been too much to expect given the times in whichi he lived. In fact, even today these evils peersist and have taken firm political roots for greater bargaining power by the socially oppressed. Even Christianity in India has not been able to fight the blight of untouclhability. since the converted Hindus observe it in their social life. A small Jewish communnity in Kerala is also subject to caste distinction. As a new falith. vaishnavism, irn the south, tried to maintiain superiority by observing rigidity in orthodoxy and restriction of food, since in Hinduism, food hierarchy goes with caste hierarchy. The higher the caste the areater the restriction and taboos on food. As the strUggle for superiority asserted itself. saniskritisation beran to assert itself and the vaishnavites split into two branches - the vadagalais, tlhe northern culture favouring m)ore sanskrit, and the tengalais f:avouring more Tamil. The fight tor capture of temple administrationi became fierce. The litigation over the management of'a temple in Madras, dedicated to Parthsarathi Swami, became so tangled in legal quLestions that the British administration could not settle it and handed it over to an Indian judge.2 Many of these disputes went tothe PrivyCouncil in England for decisioin. The discussions instead of being intellectually stimulating became as in the case of medieval scholastics, questions as to hlow many angels can dance on the head ol a needle. Just as in the case of the church, there was a schism reoarding the interpretation of Ramanluja's philosophy. Conversions, which were very liberal during Ramanuja's time, became rigid and the vaishnava community beciame as it were a reactionary community in the south. Ramanu ja did not even initiate any struggle against caste oppression nor did he preach about defence of the dharma against oppressors. Not only he, but every other thinker in India, did not teach delence of religion, the gods and the community against vandals, hence when the Islamic hordes came to India, wave after wave, destroying their temples, laying their land to waste, converting thousands by lorce into Islam, ther e was no resistance, but flight and abject surrenderto the tierceattack. (Sikhism, whichl is considered an off shoot of the Bhakti movement, alone took to resistance after Guru Govind Singh initiated a militant movement and coined the concept of 'saiut- sipahi' (saint-soldier).) But this attitude also was responsible for the Islamic kings to be tolerant later on, after their initial zeal was satistied, and they found people submitting to any ruler who establislhed himselt on the throne. Even in contemporary India, struggling against social oppression, the invocation to the Bhakti movement is conspicuously absent. As a recent writer says, "Througlhout history the strength of the movement has li n in the exceptional calibre of its leaders; its weakness has been the total trust which its followers placed in these men, elevating them to the status of quasi-divine prophets who would answer their every need. Bhakti is an accurate retlection of the chronic helplessness of the Indian masses and their burning zeal to recognise in supreme authority a force transcending the strictures of the social system."

Ramlanuja did not approve of a crude interpretation. Rainanuja showed by his exegesis that it means that the brahinan had eyes that resembled a lotus blossoming as the sun rose. 7 Sawai, Yoshitsugu, 'Ramanuja's Theory of Karman', Journal f Indian Philosoj)hy 1 993, 21: p 62. 8 S Radhakrishnan in a laboured fashion, justifies Sankara's view on caste and also tries to reconcile Sankara with Ramnanuja. Vedanta Desika in his Stta Dushini criticises advaitin's views on the disquialification of sudras to learn Vedas. He also makes fun of the maya theory of San!'ara satying that these advaitins while proclaimning everything as maya rush to the first rank when 'laddoos' and 'modakain' are being distributed.
