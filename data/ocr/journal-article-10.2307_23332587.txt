Conscious Networks in Brains and Computers, Cambridge / New York: Cambridge University Press, 1998, xiv + 508 pp., illus., $24.95. Inspired by Sherringtons physiological approach to the brain, the author tries to present an account of the physiological background of cognitive activities. He is following an approach he described as rational as he tries to replace anthropomorphic images of brain activities by models describing technical devices that perform something similar to human cognitive activities. Thereby he attempts - like the Viennese physiologist Sigmund Exner more than 100 years ago - to present a physiological explanation of psychological phenomena. The brain is described as a machinery, in which the game of neurons produces a complex internal reaction. This interplay of neurons is understood as the representation of reality by the human mind. Accordingly, to describe what the mind is and how it works, one has to go back to the physiology of brain activities. In doing so, Cotterill is far from original, but he added on some ideas about neuronal networks and their impact on cognitive sciences. The book gives a nicely written narrative of basic neurophysiology and some basic neuronal network technology. Thereby, Cotterill tried to outline a technical framework that would allow to describe conscious activity as the outcome of physiological reactions. Subjects of his account are attention, memory formation, some basic associative activities, phantom sensation, emotion and the internal information flow within the human brain. The depth of reason are described as the plain outcome of the neuronal interaction modelled in a neuronal network. The author refrains from commenting the new developments in neurophilosophy, the philosophy of mind or the philosophical discussions about representations.</page></plain_text>
