After briefly relating the narrative, I discuss its aetiological implications. Various interpretations of the story are then offered and critiqued. The article proceeds to consider the story in terms of power and agency and to investigate its discursive features: its chain of speaking, the nature of the laughter it presents and its mode of interpellation. This is followed by an examination of identity in the context of the narrative and an investigation into how a /Xam mythic framework plays itself out in the story. The article concludes with a consideration of the story's narrative voice. My discussion of the story aims primarily to show that the structuralist, comparative and functionalist ways in which the /Xam narratives have previously been read have missed much of the play of difference that becomes apparent when the discursive character of the /Xam materials is foregrounded. Introduction The Bleek and Lloyd archive comprises about 12,000 handwritten notebook pages of narrative, history, autobiography and cultural information. It was assembled in the 1870s by the linguist Wilhelm Bleek and his sister-in-law Lucy Lloyd. Bleek and Lloyd's chief informants were all /Xam men from the area of the present-day Northern Cape who had been held in the Breakwater prison in Cape Town before being released into Bleek' s custody. They spent considerable periods of time in the Bleek household. Despite the unique status of the collection as probably the largest body of oral literature in the world in a language that is no longer extant,1 very few of the materials have been the subject of close textual treatment. This is as true now as it was ten years ago, when David Lewis- Williams began his close reading of the /Xam story, 'The Mantis, the Eland and the Meerkats', with the observation that 'Given the rich heritage of indigenous southern African folklore, it is surprising that so few scholars have attempted detailed exegeses of specific myths' ? 1 S.

The stories of the informants and the collectors, and of their interrelationships, provided another focus of attention. In addition, the scholars who have analysed the materials have often been influenced by theoretical traditions in the analysis of oral literature that downplay the significance of textual detail. Roger Hewitt, the first and most thorough of the interpreters of the materials, 'tends to emphasise the creation of structural typologies over the analysis of texts in terms of their symbolic resonance within their society and beyond'.4 His work also exhibits the influence of the functionalist position that narratives work to reinforce the social order. In Bushman Folktales, Mathias Guenther seeks to correlate /Xam and Nharo stories. His comparatist's approach emphasises broad patterns rather than discursive detail. In Tricksters and Trancers, Guenther seeks chiefly to link the narratives with a /Xam foraging ideology and to posit a relationship between /Kaggen, the /Xam Mantis character who features in many of the stories, and various tricksters from both the region and the world at large. He also links /Kaggen with the Kalahari trance practitioner. While Hewitt and Guenther have contributed significantly to scholars' understanding of the texts, I agree with Brown that it is also important to develop an approach to reading the texts that attempts to locate them 'within the signifying practices of their society'.5 The /Xam texts, in my opinion, owe their ability to generate meaning to their place within /Xam discourse rather than to their susceptibility to being incorporated within universal narrative typologies. While their resemblance to other stories from the region is noteworthy, so too are their differences. Their textual details are not simply an aesthetic embellishment; the individual stories do not merely reinforce social codes and values. As this discussion of a single story argues, the narratives are ideological and discursive sites that produce a range of meanings, many of them contradictory. I begin with a summary of 'The Story in which the Children are Sent to Throw the Sleeping Sun into the Sky'. The summary is based on two similar versions of the narrative that occur in the Bleek and Lloyd materials. Both versions were related by //Kabbo, the oldest and, in the opinion of several commentators, the best of the /Xam informants. The first was told to Wilhelm Bleek and was published in Specimens of Bushman Folklore.6 The second and longer version, on which I have mostly relied, was narrated to Lucy Lloyd and is to be found in the unpublished notebooks.7 It should be remembered that there is no original, authorised version of a /Xam story. 3 See Bank, Bushmen in a Victorian World, p. 190, for an account of how Roger Hewitt rediscovered the Bleek and Lloyd notebooks, which had lain unnoticed in the Archives and Manuscript Department at the University of Cape Town library for several decades. 4 D. Brown, 'The Society of the Text: The Oral Literature of the /Xam Bushmen', Critical Arts, 9, 2 (1995), p. 79. Hewitt's typologies are based on those of Vladimir Propp. See V. Propp, Morphology of the Folktale (Austin, University of Texas Press, 1968). Hewitt, it should be pointed out, is concerned not only with typological classification, but also provides detailed discussion of the ethnographic context, the role of the narrators and the social function of the narratives. 5 Brown, 'Society of the Text', p. 80. 6 W.H.I. Bleek and L.C. Lloyd, Specimens of Bushman Folklore (London, George Allen, 1911), pp. 44-55. This version occurs in L.II.15, 487-99 in the notebooks. I have followed generally accepted practice when quoting from the unpublished notebooks of the Bleek and Lloyd collection. The letter L or B is used to indicate whether the notebook was compiled by Wilhelm Bleek or Lucy Lloyd. The system used to reference Lloyd's notebooks differs somewhat from the system used for Bleek' s. The Roman numeral indicates the informant in the case of Lloyd's notebooks. //Kabbo, for example, is consistently accorded the numeral II, Dialkwain is indicated by the numeral V, and /Han#kass'o by VIII. In Bleek' s case, the Roman numeral refers to a notebook number. The page numbers span all the notebooks collected by one of the collectors. When a reference is followed by the letters rev, as in L.II.6, 669 rev, a reverse page of the notebooks is indicated. These mostly contain notes and explanations, although sometimes narratives occur in them as well. 7 L.II.35, 3,150-9 and 3,165-3,236 rev.</page><page sequence="3">Power, Identity and Difference in a /Xam Narrative 481 Much of the story consists of the recounting of the same events by different actors. The plot is thus quite easily summarised if these repetitive elements are left out, although the result appears scanty. Roger Hewitt has observed that the plots of such stories are undeveloped.8 The story's real interest, in my opinion, though, resides in its textual details rather than in its plot. Although the narrative's repetitive features can be omitted from a summary, repetition is a technique that is integral to the discursive effect of the narrative. A Story Two women of the early race instruct the sons of the younger woman (the older woman is childless) to creep up on the old man who has the warmth and light of the sun under his armpit.9 The boys should toss him into the sky and instruct him to follow the path designated as his. 'Ye shall say to the old man, that, his path must truly be yonder.10 Oh children! Ye must give directions (orders) strongly to the old man, that the old man may not forget; for the old man alone is the one who is warm' . l * The boys are to creep up on him quietly, Tor a man who (is) very cunning, he (therefore) also is . . . \12 Not only should they caution the younger children not to laugh while the old man is sleeping, lest he awakens, but when they 'presently go stealthily to lift him up ... ye shall not go laughing'.13 If they manage to contain their laughter, he will only be 'startled awake' while he is ascending. The women instruct the boys as to what they should say. 'The old woman said to the children, "O children going yonder! Ye must speak to him, when ye throw him up .... ye must tell him, that, he must altogether become the sun, that he may go forward, while he feels that he is altogether the sun, which is hot; therefore, the Bushman rice becomes dry The children faithfully carry out these instructions. They then eagerly await the first dawn. 'They sleep; the day breaks, the children first, they awake, they look at the darkness, they say, "The darkness does yonder go darkness goes out from the daybreak's side; the darkness goes towards the evening's side'".15 They are praised by the women for having listened well and for having acted with resolution. The boys' grandmother, an older woman who is not necessarily their biological grandmother, especially congratulates them. '"Yes, my grandsons, I wished that ye should do thus for me, to the old man, that I might be able to be warm'"16 The acclaim earned through this action is extended to all the First Bushmen. 'For, we are the earliest Bushmen, we are those who work well'.17 The story does not end there. On the morning after his unexpected elevation into the sky, the sun discovers that he is not alone. Just as he is setting at dusk, the moon comes out. This angers the sun, who attacks the moon with a knife. He does not completely destroy the moon, however, but leaves the moon's backbone behind for the sake of the moon's children. This enables the moon gradually to recover his full size, at which point the sun attacks him again and the cycle is repeated.18 8 Hewitt, Structure, Meaning and Ritual, p. 91. 9 The old man is generally reterred to as the sun in mis story. 10 L.II.35, 3,168. 11 L.II.35, 3,169. 12 L.II.35, 3,157. 13 L.II.35, 3,166. 14 Bleek and Lloyd, Specimens, p. 47.

More otten than not, the narrators do not represent the first Bushmen as 'working well'. 18 Bleek and Lloyd, Specimens, pp. 51-5.</page><page sequence="4">482 Journal of Southern African Studies Interpretation and the Question of Origins All stories invite several possible interpretative strategies; this particular story is no exception. A structuralist reading might gloss over the details and seek the underlying pattern in the narrative that links it to others of its type. Hewitt, however, finds the sidereal narratives generally unsuitable for the kind of structuralist analysis he applies to the /Kaggen stories. Mostly, he asserts, the stories do not * warrant much attention as verbal art'. They 'are very undeveloped as narratives' because 'there is little attempt to build the narrative in any way, and no plotting of events' , making them structurally uninteresting.19 Despite this contention, 'the story of the sun's armpit' could well invite the sort of structuralist interpretation, pivoting on the nature/culture binary, that Hewitt regularly employs in his readings. The story could, for instance, be read as one in which the sun (nature) is separated from and subordinated to culture (the economic practices of the Bushmen). The sun is forcibly placed in its proper sphere within nature, ejected from, and repositioned in relation to, the cultural field. The story could also, in this sort of analysis, be located within the liminal zone between nature and culture. Bushman rice is a natural product, the larvae of ants, that is cooked by nature in the form of the sun rather than on the cooking fire (a part of culture), but which is transformed, nevertheless, into a cultural product, cooked larvae. But the nature/culture binary in such stories could as easily posit a contrary logic: the recognition of the interpénétration of nature and culture. Both formulations - the separation of culture from nature, and the interdependence of nature and culture - presuppose a 'nature/culture' binary that is universal rather than the product of a specific intellectual history. Neither, however, forms part of the enunciating strategy of the text itself. Different ideological interpretations also offer themselves. The very fact that the story is capable of mobilising different perspectives supports Karin Barber's observations about the ideological nature of oral texts.20 This ideological multivocality stems not only from differences in interpretation but also from the ideological and dialogical nature of the texts themselves. The sun' s ejection into heaven could reflect either power differentials in Bushman social systems, or a non-hierarchical ecological interdependence. The manner in which women and children together determine the position of the sun could be cited as evidence of an egalitarian ethos that is blind to age and gender. Conversely, it could be read as a compensatory mechanism whereby old women and children are granted a role in stories that they lack in ordinary daily life. Most commentators read the /Xam narratives as origin stories about a creation time when things were still coming into being.21 This particular story lends itself more readily to this designation than many of the others since it obviously deals with an inaugural event. Its aetiological import is explicit. The story explains how the sun came to be in the sky, which is convenient and practical for the /Xam: the rice is dried and the woinen can leave the warmth of the fire and go out and collect food. Humans have taken the chance to adjust the cosmos to their satisfaction. Even if the narrative is read as a myth of origin in this way, however, it must be conceded that it is not an account, along the lines of the first book of Genesis, of the beginning of everything. The sun already exists as an old man living in a Bushman band. The story concerns not his creation, but his elevation into the sky. The focus is as much on the activity of the boys and the initiatory role of the women as it is on the sun. Nowhere in the stories related by the /Xam informants is an attempt made to explicate ultimate origins. 19 Hewitt, Structure, Meaning and Ritual, pp. 91, 94. /Kaggen, or the Mantis, is the protagonist of a whole cycle of stories that are set in the First Times, the period in the /Xam narratives in which animals and people have not yet been properly separated. Critics generally describe /Kaggen as the /Xam trickster figure. 20 See, for example, K. Barber, / Could Speak Until Tomorrow: Oriki, Women and the Past in a Yoruba Town (Edinburgh, Edinburgh University Press, 1991), p. 5. 21 See, for example, Hewitt, Structure, Meaning and Ritual, pp. 47, 93; and James, First Bushman's Path, p. 149.</page><page sequence="5">Power, Identity and Difference in a /Xam Narrative 483 Alan Barnard ascribes the absence of an account of ultimate origins in Khoisan stories to a double-creation framework in which a deity brings a world into being and then leaves other agents to finish off the details.22 Be this as it may, in this story the sun exists in the armpit of the old man. How this state of affairs arose in the first place is a question the story does not attempt to explore. Even if the story is considered to be primarily aetiological, it is important to examine both the particular anatomy of the aetiological explanations it offers and the ordering of the discursive elements within it. The sun is depicted as selfish, jealous, violent and bad- tempered. He is expelled from human society. A dualistic identity politics is enacted in which his difference and distance from the human community is asserted. By the end of the story, however, the sun is praised for 'having worked well' and is seen to possess a sense of service, invoked when he is celebrated for shining so that the people may be warm and the rice may dry. His sense of compassion and 'humanity' are appealed to when he is asked, for the sake of the children, not to completely destroy the moon after he attacks it with a knife. The sun is not given a one-dimensional, archetypal nature. Does it follow, then, that the story provides evidence of a non-dualistic ideology in which good and evil are not essentialised? The one figure in the /Xam stories who seems to lack mitigating qualities and who thus might be interpreted in terms of essential evil, the all-devourer, is said to have been borrowed from African sources.23 Solomon also, though, associates IKhwa, a /Xam figure who is closely identified with the rain, with 'a death-giving or evil being' ,24 Whether or not the danger posed by this figure is a function of a particular relational or temporal structure, or the result of his essentially evil nature, is a question that requires further investigation. To what extent, one might ask, is a secularised form of the Manichaeism that runs through western thought responsible for the detection in materials such as the /Xam narratives of dualistic categories like good and evil, raw and cooked, nature and culture? Conversely, does the attribution of an absence of categories of good and evil among people such as the /Xam rest on a Utopian desire to recover a sense of unalienated wholeness? The sun is represented as an old man who can speak and be addressed as a person.25 In the time of the stories, human and non-human are not clearly differentiated. The attribution of human form or personality to animals, gods and cosmic entities like the sun is a form of anthropomorphism, as Guenther points out.26 The sun, moon and animals mostly speak as humans do only during the time of the First Order. Guenther reads this phenomenon as integrating the orders of the imaginary and the 'real': 'symbolic acts of anthropomorphisation 22 A. Barnard, Hunters and Herders of Southern Africa: A Comparative Ethnography of the Khoisan Peoples (Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1992). 23 Hewitt, Structure, Meaning and Ritual, p. 225. 24 A. Solomon, 'The Myth of Ritual Origins? Ethnography, Mythology and Interpretation of San Rock Art', South African Archaeological Bulletin, 52, 165 (June 1997), p. 5. 25 The Bleek and Lloyd notebooks contain valuable indigenous commentary, often on the reverse sides of the pages of the notebooks on the stories. //Kabbo delivers such a commentary on this story: 'the Sun was a man; but, not one of the early race of people who preceded the Flat Bushmen in their country. He only gave forth brightness for a space around his own dwelling. Before the children threw him up, he had not been in the sky, but had lived at his own house, on Earth. As his shining had been confined to a certain space at, and round his own dwelling, the rest of the country seemed as if the sky were very cloudy; as it looks now, when the Sun is behind thick clouds. The sky was black (dark?). The shining came from one of the Sun's armpits, as he lay with one arm lifted up. When he put down his arm, darkness fell everywhere; when he lifted it up again, it was as if day came. In the day, the Sun's light used to be white; but, at night, it was red, like a fire. When the Sun was thrown up into the sky it became round, and never was a man afterwards'. Bleek and Lloyd, Specimens, pp. 54-55. It should be noted, in addition, that the narrative which appears in Specimens includes a section that was recorded on the reverse side of Bleek' s notebook pages (Ibid, pp. 45-51). This piece is a narrative in itself, which also augments and helps interpret the wider narrative within which Lloyd has embedded it in Specimens. 26 Guenther, Tricksters and Trancers, pp. 73, 161.</page><page sequence="6">484 Journal of Southern African Studies link the wild animals of today more closely to the human-animals of the first order; thus, echoes from the mythological past resound through the world of animals of the present'.27 This is surely true, too, of the sun, moon and the stars, which continue to be present as emissaries of other realms, including those of the narratives of the First Times and of the spirits of the dead. In terms of the /Xam discursive order, cosmic entities are crucial signifiers in the intertextual field that encompasses not only discourse and the body but also the wider physical world. They operate at the threshold of two or three /Xam sign-systems, marking the cross-pollination and interpénétration of, as well as the difference between, these systems. Their territory is the 'passage from one sign-system to another' ?* Some kinds of theory offer a critique of language itself as a form of anthropomorphism, a projection of human categories onto the always elusive other. Derrida writes of language as though it is the medium through which the always deferred human subject hails the haunting absence of the extra-human world and takes the echo of its own address as an object, which always remains a source of desire since it is never attained. '[T]he order of the signified is never contemporary'.29 This narrative, in which the sun is invested with human attributes, as well as the many others that employ this technique, could be said to be making visible this language of desire. It is also possible that the anthropomorphism that operates in regard to the sun and other mixed beings of the narratives demonstrates a /Xam understanding of the phenomenon of the Buddhist term sunatta, or emptiness, in which there is no independent arising and nothing exists apart from its interrelatedness with other things and beings. The sun's separation from the human world in the story is, paradoxically, the necessary condition for the proper expression of this interrelatedness. But whatever the precise anatomy of this complex in the /Xam materials, it has always to be borne in mind that the identification of anthropomorphism in them, as well as the delineation of a temporality in which mythological time is divided from the present, might say more in the end about modern rationalism's erasure of certain forms of experience and signification than it does about the narratives themselves. 'Myth', it is often maintained, shapes, reinforces or reflects in some way, the ethos of a community by referring to the possibility of infraction and imaginatively previewing the consequences of selfishness or disobedience. This lends 'myth' a moral ambiguity that undermines the ethical thrust imputed to it. In the /Kaggen stories, for example, the attractiveness of the protagonist outweighs the moral force of his family's reproofs following his escapades. His 'bad' motives, after all, usually have beneficial consequences. On one level, this story of the sun sanctions the sharing ethos and condemns the withholding of the individual's power from the communal energy grid. One suspects, however, that the moral message is incidental - that it is less about the sun's not sharing than about how others have to devise a strategy to acquire his warmth. It is at least as much, then, about being successful as it is about being 'good'. The narrative, in my view, is not primarily ethical or didactic; just as it is not chiefly aetiological. Nor is its meaning likely to be inferred from the consideration of a combination of ethical, aetiological and other factors. The story's nature also refuses to emerge through a process of the elimination of possible readings, a kind of negative theology of criticism. What, then, is its nature? How does it speak to us, its untutored listeners? It does not hide beneath its surface: it possesses no mystery; anyone can understand it. And yet it does not easily allow an unexamined meta- statement to adhere to it. 27 Ibid., p. 73. 28 J. Kristeva, The Kristeva Reader (Oxford, Blackwell, 1986), p. Ill, italics in the original. zy Derrida, Of Grammatology, p. 18.</page><page sequence="7">Power, Identity and Difference in a /Xam Narrative 485 The Chain of Speaking The Story of the Sun's Armpit' starts with a chain of speaking. We are placed immediately within discourse and its materiality. Barnard, as we have seen, ascribes the absence of an ultimate origin in Khoisan stories to a double-creation framework in which a deity, like a Florentine master, leaves the details of his incomplete canvas to the apprentices to complete.30 The apprentices here are the old women and their boys. Their chief instrument of artifice is speaking. A chain of speaking is established in which the speakers change but the speaking itself never ceases. This chain involves the old women telling the older children to tell the younger children not to laugh. The old women then tell the older boys what to tell the sun. The older children in turn tell the women what they have told the sun and then the women tell (themselves, the world?) what the older children have told them, and so on. At a point in the story, when the children report back to the women, the narrative voice switches from the women to the boys, who continue to articulate their experience until the women join them in watching the first sunrise.31 In between, the narrator himself either directly describes the action or reports on what the women or boys are saying in the third person.32 Switching of narrative voice characterises the /Xam stories in general. It is a technique that affords obvious opportunities for dramatisation and characterisation.33 In many of the stories the technique of shifting narrative voice allows for multiple perspectives.34 This is particularly noticeable in a lengthy story, included in Lewis- Williams' s Stories that Float from Afar, concerning a death on the hunting-ground.35 The narrative is built up almost entirely of different perspectives of the same event. In the story of the sun, however, the boys' voices are an extension of the women's voices. The presence of different narrative voices does not, in this instance, betoken a multiplicity of contending perspectives but an aggregation of discursive power. There is a unity of forces, a balance between old and young, male and female, as the human community directs its energies towards procuring a reliable source of energy. 30 Barnard, Hunters and Herders, p. 83. 31 'The children returned. Then, the children came (and) said: "(Our) companion who is here, he took hold of him, I also was taking hold of him; my younger brother was taking hold of him, my other younger brother was also taking hold of him; (our) companion who is here, his other younger brother was also taking hold of him. I said: 'Ye must grasp him firmly.' I, in this manner, spoke; I said: 'Throw ye him up!' Then, the children threw him up. I said to the children: 'Grasp ye the old man firmly!' I said to the children: 'Throw ye up the old man!' Then, the children threw up the old man; that old man, the Sun; while they felt that the old woman was the one who spoke'" . Bleek and Lloyd, Specimens, p. 49. 32 The narrator presents the action directly: 'They arose, going on, they stealthily approached him, they stood still, they looked at him, they went forward; they stealthily reached him, they took hold of him[;] they all took hold of him together, lifted him up, they raised him, while he felt hot' (Ibid, p. 49). The narrator also presents the action through reported speech: 'The other old woman said to the other, that, the other one's children should approach gently to lift up the Sun-armpit, that they should throw up the Sun-armpit, that the Bushman rice might become dry for them, that the Sun might make bright the whole place ...' (Ibid., p. 45). The action is sometimes presented directly through the speaking of the women; usually this takes the form of their addressing the boys: '"Ye must go to sit down, when ye have looked at him, (to see) whether he lies looking; ye must go to sit down, while ye wait for him'" (Ibid., p. 47). Finally, the action is presented through the voices of the boys: 'They came to speak, the youth spoke, the youth talked to his grandmother: "O my grandmother! We threw him up, we told him, that, he should altogether become the Sun, which is hot; for, we are cold. We said: 'O my grandfather, Sun-armpit! Remain (at that) place; become thou the Sun which is hot . . . "" Ibid., p. 51). To this chain of speaking could be added //Kabbo's commentary on the story (Ibid, pp. 45, 54-7). 33 It was but one of the rhetorical devices that storytellers had at hand. Others included accents and registers and a wide repertoire of expression and gesture. Storytellers employed a specialised vocabulary for different animal characters as well as specialised forms of enunciation based on the shape of the animal's mouth.

Here, the chain of signification begins with an injunction to the boys to tell the young children not to laugh at the old man sleeping. In order for an even greater state of plenitude to ensue, laughter must be suspended. A completely contrary state of affairs does not prevail prior to the events related in the story: there is no formless void waiting to be filled, only an unsatisfactory situation requiring improvement. The story occurs in a setting of domestic congeniality characterised by the excessive gaiety of children. The sun himself is represented as a grumpy, selfish old man rather than as a figure who engenders fear, even in small children. It is not only the young children who have to still their laughter; the older boys, too, are cautioned to go stealthily. What is the nature of this laughter? Is it a nervous laughter, 'a laughter that does not laugh'?37 The children do not appear to fear the old man unduly. Is it ribaldry? A mode of speaking or a mode of forgetting? Is it a type of hilarity peculiar to the nature of children? Does it participate in the 'undestroyable . . . eternal laughter of the gods'?38 The women make no appeal to the boys' courage and masculinity. They impress upon the boys, rather, the requirement for success of temporarily repressing their hilarity. We enter a comic modality. Why does this old man, who does not himself laugh, elicit this laughter? Is it merely a response to his isolation and anti-social nature, or does the laughter derive from some other source? Ironically, the old man's social alienation leads to his performance of a benign social function. His self-assumed isolation precipitates his ejection from the community, the necessary prelude to his provision of the required solar services. Ironically, too, he follows his own path by a decree of others, a victim of the women' s power speaking through the boys. His presence in the skies will be an enduring testimony to the force of the integration of the energies of old females and young males, of anima and animus, if one wishes to accede to the unfashionable inducement, but only in passing, of a Jungian interpretation. The process could also be described in terms of interpellation. The sun knows himself and his function as 'natural' when hailed by the authoritative speaking of the boys. Interpellation in its Althusserian usage, however, generally refers to the reinforcement of a socially constructed ideology.39 Here we have, rather, a summoning of the sun's knowledge of self or identity, which is coeval with his social function. This identity has been there all along. It only has to be activated, acknowledged, the call answered again and again. The use of the imperative by the boys has less of the force of a command than a revelation. The sun should assent to their talking not because they tell him to but because the order of things requires it. This order of things is already known to the women. In this, the women are unlike many of the other first Bushmen in the stories, who are often ignorant of even the most basic sorts of readily acquired empirical knowledge. A man, for instance, cuts his pregnant wife's stomach open in order to gain access to a share of the meat he believes her to have eaten. The man does not know that cutting her open will kill her. Poignantly, he holds the corpse up on a stick, hoping that his wife will live again and lamenting, 'My wife! My wife! My wife!' He has to be told by the other people 'that a woman is one who always used to seem as if filled with food when she 36 James writes: 'The people of the early race were, it is suggested, able to intervene to re-order their world partly because they were in command of a powerful "First Bushmen's language". This could be used like a potent, perhaps magical, formula to bring about a desired result: so that "the thing should assent to their talking (discourse)", //Kabbo explained: the word as creative word'.

The boys must faithfully follow the steps laid out by the women if humans intentionally participating in the correct ordering of things are to succeed in their objectives. They must go stealthily, matching the old man's cunning. They must speak strongly if their use of language as an instrument of power is to be effective. The old man has to be brought within the compass of their discourse and become part of their knowledge system. In this way, a correlation between knowledge and practice is established. The man becomes subject to culture and the linguistic field, the verbal !xoe.41 But he is also ejected from culture, the community and the Ixoe. This results partly from his lack of culture (attending to his own needs only). In the process, two possibilities of venerability are contrasted: the wise women closely connected to the children and the frozen solipsism of the old man who has severed his ties with the life-giving forces that make fructifying relations possible. The old man is thrown into nature, the sky, where he again becomes part of culture when he turns the raw (the ant larvae) into the cooked (by drying the eggs). But even as a division is being instituted between nature and culture, it is being collapsed since the process of bringing the sun into human economic activity is as much a movement of locating the natural within culture as it is of accepting the limits of culture and recognising its dependence on nature. Once again, a dichotomy between nature and culture is, in all likelihood, being projected onto the stories from a critical tradition that is premised directly or indirectly on a conception of man as fallen from grace and alienated from nature. The boys should speak strongly to the old man so that he does not forget. Speech has the power to resist the extinction that follows forgetting. Or rather, it has the power to replace a certain type of remembering with another. The old man should forget his self-containment, his state outside memory, and begin with a recollection from which the coercive origin of his social role has been replaced by the knowledge of his identity as the sun. In this way, the agenda and values of the society become naturalised in him. Memory acquiesces in this process. It is domesticated, perhaps the condition of all remembrance. The power of one sort of forgetting, which is simultaneously a remembering of another sort, will keep the sun in his revolutions. His new knowledge must become habitual and embodied. This involves a constant retracing of the beaten path rather than a quest across new horizons. Through the old women and the boys, the sun is produced by the social world; he is removed from his state of static self-sufficiency and inducted into social categories of thought. His role in the world will now appear self-evident to him since his self has become an artefact of the world. It is not the contents of the boys' speech alone but the materiality of words strongly asserted, words as objects rather than signifieds, which will inscribe upon the mind of the sun the course he will subsequently tread through the sky, a path that is both physically and psychologically located. The sun's assumption of his self, which is also his role, is his path. The sun assents to his position in the new geopolitical order that the boys establish through their practice and naming. The boys, then, engage in self-panegyrics, a mode of speaking in which signifier and signified are conjoined. The women extend the praise to all the doings of the First Bushmen. This, in the mouths of the storytellers, might be read as ancestral praise. More often than not, however, the First Bushmen are figures of ridicule rather than eulogy.42 Their actions do not always have salubrious results. Nor are the First Bushmen the direct ancestors of the /Xam.43 40 L.VI.2, 4,064-68. 41 The Ixoe constitutes the territory of a /Xam band.

The boys do not immediately see the fruits of their exertions. They have to wait until the next day: They sleep; the day breaks, the children first, they awake, they look at the darkness, they say, "The darkness does yonder go ... darkness goes out from the daybreak's side, the darkness goes towards the evening's side'".44 The awe with which the children witness the first light of dawn is dramatically expressed. The women then awake and deliver a commentary, one that affirms their foreknowledge: look there and you will see the old man's rays that come up first to give some light to that part of the sky, and the sun will follow as he comes from behind the hill, and he will soon become white, and he will stand above the head of the hill45 This commentary is repeated by the children and the women, in turn, several times. The chain of signification continues. The children remark on what they witness. The women discursively pre-empt the next event in the sequence. The children then validate the women's predictions with their observations as events unfold in the manner the women have foreseen they will. The children have praised their own actions. The women have praised the cleverness of the First Bushmen. Now, in the course of their witnessing, the children praise the sun and invest him with agency: 'the sun is now coming to stand above the hill's head: it seems he has really worked well since yesterday when he started travelling along his road in the sky' ; 'the sun has worked well for he is white and will travel above us' .46 Identity The boys are told to throw the old man into the sky and instruct him to follow the path designated as his: 'Ye shall say to the old man, that, his path must truly be yonder'.47 By the end of the story, the sun travels this path day after day. The connection between journeying and ontology occurs regularly in the Bleek and Lloyd materials. Being and movement are inseparable. Death is seen as the erasure of a person's footprints by the wind and rain that attend her death, the effacement of the inscription of her movement.48 The sun's path and his journeys along it are not merely metaphors. A path is matter made social. The enactment of the self involves 'going along in one's way' . The sun cannot be the sun while he remains still. Identity requires fluidity, movement, action, praxis, discourse. It is not a static state of being but a mode of acting in the world. The force with which the children imprint upon the old man's memory the path he is to follow mobilises another critical aspect of identity. Memory and identity are closely linked. Footnote 43 continued springbucks, and the Mantis shot us, and we really cried (like a little child). Then the Mantis said, we should become a person, become people, because we really cried' (L.VIIL4, 6,365 rev). Such a momentous event, from an anthropocentric perspective, is recorded in the Bleek and Lloyd collection only as a brief explanatory aside in a long story about elephants stealing a child. 'When the first Bushmen had passed away, the Flat Bushmen inhabited their ground. Therefore, the Flat Bushmen taught their children about the stories of the First Bushmen' (note to the story in Bleek and Lloyd, Specimens, p. 55). 44 L.II.35, 3,213-14. 45 James, First Bushman's Path, p. 33. 46 Ibid., pp. 33-4. 47 L.II.35, 3,168. 48 See L.V.15, 5,147 and L.VIII.28, 8,465.</page><page sequence="11">Power, Identity and Difference in a /Xam Narrative 489 The ego discovers itself, who it really is, through the activation of 'correct memory'. The self can now proceed along its path. The social participates in the individual: it is the necessary factor in the potentiation of individuality. But the individual also participates in the social. The properties of the individual illuminate the world of the social, facilitating its activities. The individual, thus, forms part of a social ecology that embraces nature and culture. Difference is necessary in the larger scheme of things. The sun is in the sky so that the rice may be dried and the women may be warm when they set about food gathering. This social and economic ecology is embedded in discursive practice. It is also installed in the sun's memory in the form of a knowledge of the path he is to follow. The social, economic and ecological purchase of identity is proclaimed: '"0 children going yonder! Ye must speak to him, when ye throw him up ... ye must tell him, that, he must altogether become the Sun, that he may go forward, while he feels that he is altogether the Sun, which is hot; therefore, the Bushman rice becomes dry . . . "\49 More than an inscription of the women's will upon the sun's memory occurs, however. The activation of the circuits that the sun must describe each day also goes beyond learned behaviour. Particular values, norms and codes become such an integral part of individual being that their practice is unthinking and embodied. They become part of the individual's structure of feeling and constitute his body. Bourdieu's notion of 'habitus' comes to mind.50 The sun's new behaviour will be embedded in his new body. He possesses a man's body before the boys throw him up. Once he is in the sky, he loses this body; he becomes round and shines. This is, of course, to read the story from a position in which identity is understood as the confluence of the social and self-consciousness - the mechanism whereby the social order (and its truth regime) is naturalised within the site of the individual. The story of the sun does concern one especially unique individual: there is only one sun. In most of the stories of the First Order, however, identity is located rather in individuals who typify groups (the different species) and is represented either as a process of becoming or as a sudden initiation through crisis into an individuation that embraces the species and goes beyond the individual - part of the emergence of the natural order of things from the creative disjunctions of the First Order. The story can be enlisted as an illustration of the social manufacture and incorporation of self-identity. A particular identity of self is asserted in relation to a group identity. The manner in which the sun is discursively practised upon, the meeting of power and knowledge in discourse, the naturalisation of learned behaviour, the acknowledgement of the instrumentality of identity and the recognition of its economic utility (the sun in the sky can dry the rice and enable the women to gather plant foods) all point to the constructed nature of identity. But it is equally possible to discover in the story support for a different notion of identity, one in which identity becomes something waiting to be uncovered. Although there is indeed a false identity which results from conditioning, there is somewhere a true identity that is not a construct or the result of a positioning within discourse. The discovery of this authentic self becomes a matter of stripping away or of a sudden conversion, such as occurs when the sun is tossed into sky. 49 Bleek and Lloyd, Specimens, p. 47. 50 For Bourdieu, social practices and structures do not exist, other than as intellectual abstractions, unless they are 'embodied, absorbed into the sense making apparatus of the individual in order to constitute the practical reason of the habitus': J. Webb., T. Schirato and G. Danaher, Understanding Bourdieu (London, Sage, 2002), p. 116.</page><page sequence="12">490 Journal of Southern African Studies Two Myths of Origin Jacques Derrida contends that western thought is based on a myth of origin that involves a fall away from presence.51 Although I have argued that the /Xam narratives are far from simple aetiology, I shall presuppose, for the purposes of discussion and comparison in this section, that both traditions (western and /Xam) are grounded in myths of origin, and shall take the story of Genesis as the representative western myth of origin. One evident starting point for comparison is the contrast between the depiction of woman as responsible for the fall in Genesis and the depiction of women as the source of creative activity in the story of the sleeping sun. Women, in the /Xam materials, appear unquestioningly to accept the division of labour in which their role is collecting plants. There is no suggestion anywhere that women feel that there is an unequal division of labour in a /Xam band. They will not, however, accept a man's not fulfilling his role as hunter. A man who does not provide meat is scorned. Similarly, the sun's failure to provide light and warmth is unacceptable. A strong picture of female agency and initiative is presented in the story; unlike Eve's agency, which results in the expulsion of humankind from paradise, theirs has beneficial consequences. There is, in the /Xam narrative, a congruence between discourse and event and a correspondence between power and knowledge. The sun is inserted into discourse, an insertion that is conditional on the women's foreknowledge of the sun's path. The result is a particular relationship of power between people and the sun. It is not a question, however, of a pyramid of hierarchically structured relationships so much as a creative tension of forces. People eject the sun into the sky, but subsequently ask it for favours.52 In the period of becoming, people enjoy some influence with natural forces. Through their relationship with spirits who control the rain and movement of game, for example, they continue to do so in the world of everyday living.53 But people are also subject to power exerted the other way. The moon, for instance, introduces death. Spirits of illness harm people. The biblical myth of origin establishes man's dominion over nature. In the /Xam narratives, we seem to be in the presence of another sort of complex altogether, one that includes interdependent and ecological features and one in which power flows in different directions simultaneously. Identity in the stories usually concerns categories, but the sun, moon and certain stars are unusual in that their categories consist of only one member. It is in the interests of the overall order of things that each category should discover its identity and incorporate all its members. Each species, for example, should behave in accordance with its latent identity. One could, then, ask the theological question of the /Xam narratives that is asked of Genesis about determinism and free will. Here, however, one would not be interrogating the story in order to problematise the origin of evil but to explore the strange dynamics of a space of becoming. In this space, identity appears to be fluid and plastic, with species cross-dressing and coexisting in a problematic but common humanity/animality, while simultaneously it is subject to a design that will inevitably be realised. Genesis concerns a fall away from perfection while the /Xam story represents a movement towards the way things ought to be (even if this state is imperfect), an unfolding revelation in the comic rather than the portentous mode of the first myth. One mythical complex results in a teleology and the other does not. The /Xam stories, instead, celebrate a process of becoming that is open-ended.54 In the story 51 J. Derrida, Of Grammatology (Baltimore, MA, Johns Hopkins University Press, 1976). 52 Hewitt, Structure, Meaning and Ritual, p. 92. 53 Solomon, 'Myth of Ritual Origins', p. 7. 54 'Because the Second Order is both a continuation and an inversion of the First Order, the mythological past and primal time pervade the historical present and contemporary reality. This confounding of past and present, and myth and reality confers on the present order an abiding aura of ambiguity' (Guenther, Tricksters and Trancers, p. 66).</page><page sequence="13">Power, Identity and Difference in a /Xam Narrative 491 of the sun, it is in the interests of the general community that the sun follow his path in the skies. The women help to precipitate this event. There is a sense of creation unfurling through the medium of a tapestry of agents rather than through the brute commands of a dictatorial creator. The biblical story, by contrast, is centred on a single transcendental agent; it continually plays itself out in history and turns on an experience of lack and desire. At the beginning of the narrative, the women describe how 'the sun lies (in his own sun)'.55 The sun sleeps in himself, complete, an unsatisfactory situation. Here again the western and /Xam mythical structures diverge. In the Gnostic tradition, the loss of unity results in the descent into matter and the confusion of dualism, while in Genesis the creation leads directly to division and the introduction of good and evil. However, in the /Xam story, the movement towards emanation is encouraged and the condition of unity condemned. Narcissistic, self-contained withdrawal is rejected. Attributes should not remain locked within ideal substance, but should reach out and nourish life. Only when the sun's rays radiate into the world can the women leave the space confined to the reach of the fire's warmth and go out and collect food, the life-giving principle that in turn generates fresh life. The Sun and the Moon Soon after the sun has been thrown into the sky, he discovers that he is not alone in his circuits. Already jealous of his unsolicited position, the sight of the moon on the opposite horizon, red and round, enrages him. He attacks the moon: 'He resembles fire which blazes (burns) up, as he comes out, he does resemble which burns up a great tree, as he comes from behind the mountain top, he red above standing comes. Therefore the sun is angry with him. Therefore the sun says that the sun soon shall pierce/break him with the sun's assegai/spear ...\56 Whenever the sun and moon are both in the sky, the moon is red and full. The moon most resembles the sun at this time, which the sun considers a provocation. The sun is also angered by the moon's ability to resurrect itself: "'I was angry with him because he living did come again. Therefore, I piercing broke him, when he did not know that I should piercing break him. Therefore, he was startled, as his body stood streaming with blood'".57 'All societies', Zygmunt Bauman asserts, 'produce strangers; but each kind of society produces its own kind of strangers, and produces them in its own inimitable way'.58 The sun is made strange when he is ejected into the sky from the band of the familiar.59 This movement, however, is simultaneously, and paradoxically, a movement towards domesticity and socialisation since it is the mechanism whereby the sun's labour becomes part of culture. His solipsistic state of self-completion is forcibly rendered social. Yet in his first voluntary act in his new position he asserts his isolation. The sun discovers another man, like himself, red and bright (it would take more science than he possesses to realise that these lunar attributes are his own reflection) on the opposite horizon, in his new domain and directly in his path. He could perhaps embrace his double as himself. But the double, by its proximity and its bearing of a likeness that threatens to nullify the markers of identity, elicits his rage.60 55 '[F]or we always are warming ourselves here, while we do not go seeking food; that we might eat; while we do frightened sit, on account of the cold, while the sun is the one who afar lies in the sun (his own sun)' (L.II.35, 3,170). 56 B.IV, 559-61. 57 B.IV, 569-570. 58 Z.

He thus becomes doubly a stranger. 60 In a similar way, baboons have especially to be marked off from humans because or their resemblance to them. They are shown to make the most undesirable in-laws in the narratives. Hewitt, Structure, Meaning and Ritual, pp. 109- 10.</page><page sequence="14">492 Journal of Southern African Studies Complete in himself, the old man cannot embrace an equal. The similar must be attacked, almost destroyed, and then only allowed continued existence if it signifies in a key of otherness, as a stranger. Difference here oscillates between the poles of the same and the other. Although the sun allows the moon to live in a reduced form, he is incensed that even 'the putrid can emit light'. His alternation between anger and mercy is continually replayed: the inevitable cycle provoked by the stranger who is the same but other, or other but the same. In the process of making strange, of differentiation, the sun and moon are relegated to their own spheres: the sun to the day and the moon to the night.61 At the same time, their difference can only be invoked through bringing them together, forcing them into the tension of the proximate and the similar. In the First Times, all beings, including the sun and moon, are people who become separated into various categories in the course of the stories. This history, in the case of the sun and moon, extends to the present.62 These cosmic bodies can be addressed now in the language of people although they can no longer reply in this language.63 They remain partly things of the First Times, carried over into the present, because they are not subject to mortality (although the moon is and is not). The sun is always alone. In the days of his association with the band, he keeps to himself. Now, he will not countenance company in the sky. He behaves like a lone male animal, jealous of its territory. The moon, on the other hand, is figured as a family person. S(he) directly involves himself/herself in domestic affairs and intervenes in the communities. But his/her role is ambiguous as he/she both gives and takes away. The moon brings light and betokens regeneration but is also, in other stories in the collection, responsible for the presence of death. This ambiguity is replicated in the moon's ambiguous gender identity. In //Kabbo's version of the story narrated to Lloyd, the moon (specifically the full moon) is sometimes referred to as female: '[T]he moon mounts the sky yes, for the moon is the great moon, the moon with her stomach [T]he day breaks, while the moon stands there! (in the west), the sun he comes out, while the moon stands, the sun pierces her, with the sun's knife'.64 The moon ('she is a moon which talks') asks the sun to spare her life for the sake of her children. The moon wants the children to see him (note the gender switch) returning home. The sun relents and puts his knife back in his bag. The state of fullness, repletion and being fat belong to a complex related to femaleness. The moon only becomes a man (here, less than a woman) as a result of the sun's attacks. In a version of this first encounter between the sun and the moon recounted by //Kabbo, the moon is pictured as a family man who returns home putrid and wounded: 'his wife said to the children, "Father does slowly come, the sun did cut him, therefore he there slowly comes'" ,65 The moon's sudden sex change in //Kabbo's version appears to produce, by way of the moon's own substitution of reflexive pronouns, an instantly gendered domestic role transformation. The moon changes from mother to husband and father. The moment she becomes a man, the moon is supplied with a wife. Although the sun is also imbued with the power of speaking and first-person consciousness, the moon's ability to speak is especially emphasised by the narrator, for the 61 The moon's origin is as a thing in the dark, something that lights the dark, as when the Mantis' s shoe is thrown up to become the moon and light the darkness caused by the burst gall bladder of the baby eland. See D.F. Bleek (éd.), The Mantis and His Friends: Bushman Folklore Collected by the Late Dr. W.H.L Bleek and the Late Dr. Lucy C. Lloyd (Cape Town, T.M. Miller, 1923), pp. 1-5. 62 In a sense, this is true of all the beings of the First Times. After they died they continued to live in the spirit world and interact with this world. The sun and moon, however, have never died and gone away. In this sense they are supernatural. 63 According to //Kabbo, the sun and moon can no longer speak as they could in the First Times: 'The Sun had been a man, he talked; they all talked, also the other one, the Moon. Therefore, they used to live upon the earth; while they felt that they spoke. They do not talk, now that they live in the sky' (Bleek and Lloyd, Specimens, p. 57). 64 L.II.1, 285-7. 65 B. IV, 535.</page><page sequence="15">Power, Identity and Difference in a /Xam Narrative 493 moon was created from /Kaggen's shoe, and the things of /Kaggen speak.66 The moon uses this facility to plead with the sun to spare its backbone, for the sake of the children. In the well-known story of the moon and the hare, the moon decrees that there shall be death in the world in order to punish a baby hare who will not believe the moon's assurances that the hare's mother will awaken. In the story under consideration here, the moon is only rescued from his own institution, death, by the sun's tempering his aggression and acceding to the moon's request to leave him his backbone: 'Therefore, the sun says that the sun will leave the backbone for the children . . . Therefore, he becomes a new moon'.67 The sun's mercy is only temporary; his aggressive territoriality is endlessly reiterated. On the moon's return, The sun shall perceive him, this night, for he did come in the dark. The sun shall perceive him, as he stands there' . Once again, the round moon is attacked and survives only as a rotten remnant of meat clinging to his backbone. The new moon is a wounded man with an empty net, a rotten thing.68 In this form, the moon is an unlikely figure of hope or new life, as a more familiar juxtaposition of discursive objects might lead one to expect. With the sun's permission and for the sake of the children, however, the moon still emits light, the sign that it will return to full life. Bleek's translation conveys this message with a biblical resonance, although the actual words undermine the biblical deity's claim to a monopoly of power and glory: 'the putrid shall make light'.69 The vestige of light that the sun, out of consideration for the children, allows the moon to retain enables it to grow to full size again. In another text, the moon's capacity to regenerate is directly linked to the dead: 'the cavity in any new moon which had the appearance of horns was the "catching place" for people who had recently died. As the moon grew full by this means, the corpses inside were revived by the "moon water". When no more room was left, the people were tipped out onto the earth and lived again until they died again when the whole process was repeated'.70 The belief in reincarnation evinced here is not repeated in other accounts of death in the notebooks. In this extract the moon resurrects people, but in several versions of the story of the moon and the hare he is responsible for their deaths. There is only a contradiction, however, if the materials are seen as transparent windows onto a unified /Xam belief system rather than as multivocal discourse. Conclusion In an essay on postmodern religion, Bauman claims that identity is a new phenomenon, a response to postmodern man' s unprecedented loss of socially sanctioned certainty.71 Individuals are now condemned to find/make their own way in the world. One of the consequences is that people no longer have time for the 'fundamental' questions that, Bauman maintains, religions once produced in order to monopolise the answers that people then required. Did the /Xam have time for these big questions? This story of the sun and the moon is generally interpreted as an explanation of the big question about why the moon waxes and wanes, just as 'The Story of the Moon and Hare' is generally understood as an answer to the even bigger question about 66 See Hewitt, Structure, Meaning and Ritual, p. 239. /Aîkunta elaborates on the moon's speech in a discourse delivered to Bleek. He explains why the moon speaks like a shoe: 'He is the Mantis' s foot's shoe, and he feels that it was the Mantis who called his name, he will act like a shoe'. J. Hollmann (éd.), Customs and Beliefs of the /Xam Bushmen (Johannesburg, Witwatersrand University Press, 2004), p. 368. 67 Bleek and Lloyd, Specimens, p. 53. 68 Elsewhere, the full moon is described as looking like a man carrying food in a net. This is a good moon (L. V. 16, 5,206-57). 69 B.IV, 518. 70 Hewitt, Structure, Meaning and Ritual, p. 52. 71 Bauman, Postmodernity and its Discontents, pp. 165-85.</page><page sequence="16">494 Journal of Southern African Studies the origin of death.72 The presence of different and often contradictory versions of the same story, as well as conflicting explanations of natural events, already suggests, however, that the narratives are not simply explanations of puzzling phenomena or primarily answers to the big questions. But let us accept for the moment that this story provides an explanation of how the moon's cycles originated. The question still arises of what is to be made of the particular anatomy of this particular aetiological explanation. Why does this explanation assume this form and consist of precisely these details? What is the significance of the display of violence from a protagonist whose presence is so necessary to the perpetuation and pursuit of life? Andrew Bank observes that the ' [t]he language, often visceral and violent, as in many of //Kabbo' s stories, is of hunter and prey' P What is the link between power and origin? Would it not be more productive to think of the solar and lunar narratives in terms of power rather than of origin? The boys throw the sun into the sky (exerting a form of power over him), the sun wounds the moon (asserting his power over him/her), the moon institutes death in 'The Story of the Moon and the Hare' (displaying power over the living), and so on. Power is circular, diffuse. In the story of the sleeping sun, meaning results from the relationships between the different elements that occur within it, including relationships between thinness and maleness, fullness and femininity, moon and death/immortality. But the story is only one instance of the ordering of these elements, which assume their signifying power not within the compass of a single narrative but in relation to a far wider web of elements, the archive of possible statements available to /Xam narrative at a particular time in history.74 I have argued here for a criticism that emphasises both the capacity of the /Xam texts to generate multiple meanings, and the multivocality that the narratives would have contained for /Xam participants themselves. The precise anatomy of the structure of meaning and feeling generated for historically-situated /Xam auditors by such narratives, however, will ultimately always elude a contemporary reader. But even for a /Xam auditor, a story's meaning would never have been fixed and transparent. Rather, its telling would have provided an opportunity for the experience and processing of a variety of ideas and feelings. The story would always have been an invitation to exegesis.
