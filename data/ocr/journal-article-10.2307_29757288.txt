<plain_text><page sequence="1">Bhiks?tanam?rti or Harihara? by Maurizio Taddei In a lecture delivered at St.-Petersburg in 1994 and recently published by the Hermitage, Evgenji V. Zejmal' (1995) has reconsidered a Gandharan image in the Museo Nazionale d'Arte Orientale, Rome which was first published by myself (Taddei 1985) when it still was in a private collection (x). Professor Zejmar ? rightly, in my opinion, ? rejects the hypothesis put forth by H. Humbach according to which Visa (Oeso) on Kushan coins is to be connected with the Iranian wind-god Vayu. There are no grounds ? Zejmar says ? for attributing an Iranian origin to the name Visa, the old Indian-based etymology (from Prakrit visa = vrsa 'bull') being in good agreement with the iconography of Siva; moreover, no representations of Kushan Visa convey the idea of a wind-god, which was instead represented on coins by Vad (Oad) or Anemos. Professor Zejmal' goes on to write, The iconography of Kushan Visa (his complete image, his various incarnations, the shape of his attributes, etc.) can only be understood and interpreted through a comparison (though, unfortunately, not always a straight one) with later representations of Siva; fundamentally this is the earliest series of mature anthropomorphic representations of Hindu Siva, thanks to which we can have an idea of the sources and initial phases of his iconography. (2) This gives Zejmal' the opportunity of discussing the Rome relief in a fresh perspective. His analysis of the image does not differ all that much from mine ? he sees without any doubt an antelope in one of the side heads, whereas I had suggested that it was probably 'a bovine', and prefer to label as cakra the attribute I had styled 'a beamed disk'. I was prone to consider the relief as substantially Saivite, though I did not actually recognize an image of Siva in it, as Professor Zejmal' says (3). In any case, I think that the suggestions he draws from the characteristics of the image are quite interesting and stimulating. He rightly (*) Professor Zejmal' was kind enough to provide me with a print-out of his text before it was published. I am very grateful to him for this and many other tokens of friendship he bestowed upon me. My most heartfelt thanks are also due to Dr G. Garritano, who kindly translated the paper by Professor Zejmar for me.

(3) 'M. Taddej, izdavsij etot rel'ef, uverenno opredelil ego kak izobrafcenie Sivy [...]' (ibid.). [1] 453</page><page sequence="2">points out that a rare coin of Huviska (Gobi 1984: emiss. 235, pi. 18; pi. 169, Oeso 7) shows Oeso in a similar way: the god is three-headed (one of the heads being that of a boar), four-armed, and ithyphallic; he also holds a mrga, a trident, and a cakra ? all elements appearing in the Rome relief, though in different positions. It is true ? ZejmaP says ? that 'in "orthodox" mediaeval Hindu iconography, the cakra is usually understood as characteristic of Visnu, but there is also the representation of Cakra d?nam?rti in which Siva hands over the cakra to Visnu, a clear indication that originally ? even in non-Saivite representations ? the cakra was the property of Siva' (p. 231). According to one of the versions of this myth, Siva severed the fifth head of Brahma and was therefore condemned to wander as a penitent (Bhiks?tanam?rti). ZejmaP concludes by saying that a straight identification of the image kept in the Rome Museum with the mediaeval representations of Siva is impossible, as both iconography and interpretation of the various subjects underwent deep changes in the course of time. Nevertheless, availing ourselves conventionally of the nomenclature of mediaeval incarnations, we might surmise that in the relief and the coin there is not represented the all-mighty Siva, the creator of the universe as he was, and is, worshipped by the Saivites, but the god in a form closer to the representations of 'orthodox' Hinduism, Visa-'Kank?la' (or Visa-'Bhiks?tana'), who was guilty of fighting against Brahma and condemned by the gods. In the [Rome] relief his 'fierce' principle (the boar's head) is clearly balanced by the 'mild' one (the antelope's head); the rosary and the water-flask he needs for his penitential wandering under the appearance of an ascetic, and the cakra is shown as a reminder of the offence he had committed in front of the gods. (4) I am afraid I cannot share this opinion, though it is a very attractive one, not so much because of the great distance in time, as ZejmaP himself is ready to acknowledge, and in space, since most of the depictions of Bhiks?tana are from South India, nor on account of the great differences in many a detail. These are perhaps surmountable difficulties (though they are difficulties) ? the reason that induces me to stick to my old interpretation (i.e., a composite deity sporting the cognizances of both Siva and Visnu) lies in an apparently minor detail which appears to have been disregarded by ZejmaP. This is the 'third eye', which 'is not placed vertically in the middle of the forehead as one would expect it to be', but 'is inclined towards the god's right in a very conspicuous way' (Taddei 1985: 624). As I wrote in my old paper, 'I dare not call it "Harihara" '; nevertheless Professor ZejmaP will agree with me that that minor detail is the only iconographic unit in our image whose meaning cannot be doubted ? it clearly and unequivocally characterizes a composite deity. I still dare not call it 'Harihara', though conventionally ? uslovno ? that name might well fit its ultimate meaning. (4) 'No, pol'zujas' nomenklaturoj srednevekovyh inkarnacii uslovno, mozno polagat', cto i na rel'efe, i na monete izobrazen ne vsemoguscij Siva ? tvorec mira, kakim ego pocitali (i pocitajut) sivaisty, a bolee blizkij k predstavlenijam "ortodoksal'nogo" induizma Visa-"Kankala" (ili Visa-"Bhiksatana''), provinisijsja v spore s Brahmoj i osuzdennyj bogami. Na rel'efe ego "svirepoe" nacalo (kaban'ja golova) javno uravnovesivaetsja "krotkim" (golova antilopy), cetki i sosud dlja vody neobhodimy emu dlja pokajannogo stranstvija v oblike monaha, a cakra izobrazena kak napominanie o ego prostupke pered bogami' (Zejmal' 1995: 231-32). 454 [2]</page><page sequence="3">Fig. 1 - Gandharan composite image.
