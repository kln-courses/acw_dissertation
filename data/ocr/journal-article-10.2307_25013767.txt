<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTES AND COMMENTS The nineteenth annual meeting of the American Catholic Historical Association was held under the patronage of the Catholic colleges and universities of the Chicago area at the Stevens Hotel, Chicago, December 28-30, 1938. The Secretary's annual account of the meeting will appear as usual in the April number of the Review. This year's meeting, to be held in the Hotel Mayflower, Washington, D.C., will be devoted to the general topic of the cultural influences of the Catholic Church in South America in recent years. Mr. Richard F. Pattee of the Division of Ameri? can Republics, Department of State, has been appointed vice-chairman of the programme committee. The fifty-third annual meeting of the American Historical Association, Chicago, Dec. 28-30, offered a variety of papers and discussions, many of which were of interest to Catholic scholars. Richard F. Pattee, Dr. Elio Gianturco, Dr. Sherbowitz-Wetzor, Father Wilfrid Parsons, S.J., and Prof. H. C. F. Bell, former pre?dent of the American Catholic Historical Association, all of whom have contributed to the Review and who are members of the Association, appeared on the programme of the parent organization. The Catholic Library Association will hold its next annual meeting at the Catholic University of America, April 12-14, concurrently with the meeting of the National Catholic Educational Association. The general subject of the conference will be the 400th anniversary of the introduction of printing into America. The Catholic Biblical Association of America, with headquarters at the Catholic University of America, announces the founding of a new periodical ?The Catholic Biblical Quarterly. The editor-in-chief is Rev. Wendell Reilly, S.S., S.T.D., S.S.D., professor of Sacred Scripture in St. Mary's Seminary, Baltimore, Maryland. The subscription price is $5.00 a year. The Dominican Fathers of St. Joseph's Province announce the publica? tion, possibly this spring, of a new quarterly to be known as the Thomist. It is planned to print four or five original articles of a speculative nature which will embody the solution of some philosophical or theological problem in the light of Thomistic principles, together with reviews, and editorial comment. The editorial office will be at the Dominican House of Studies, Catholic University of America; the publishers will be Sheed and Ward, and the price will be $4.00 a year. 490</page><page sequence="2">NOTES AND COMMENTS 491 Beginning with the January (1939) number, the University of Notre Dame will issue a quarterly Review of Politics, under the editorship of Dr. Waldemar Gurian. The Catholic Press Association is again offering prizes, ranging from $100 to $300, for the best theses submitted on subjects in the field of the Catholic press in partial fulfillment of scholastic requirements for a gradu? ate degree. Details of the contest may be obtained from the Rev. Theo phane Maguire, C.P., editor of the Sign, Union City, N. J., who is chair? man of the committee of awards. The Rev. Ralph Bayard, CM., St. Thomas Seminary, Denver, Col., is writing a biography of the Most Rev. John Timon (1797-1867), and is seeking copies of his correspondence. Information respecting Bishop Timon's residence in Baltimore and Louisville will be particularly welcome. For the purpose of issuing in book form the unique records in the posses? sion of the Hudson's Bay Company, a society with limited membership, to be known as the Hudson's Bay Record Society, has been constituted. Members, on payment of the annual subscription of one guinea or five dollars per annum, will be entitled to receive one volume of the records each year, publication of which will be made about October. Religion?A Digest. Protestant, Catholic and Jewish Thought is a new monthly digest of articles the purpose of which " is simply to have us all speak to each other and have us all listen to each other and so promote good-will and tolerance and understanding upon which great things America is built." The price is $3.00 a year. The Editor's address is Jerome T. Gaspard, 2401 Military Road, Arlington, Va. A. Lucas has attempted to fix the Route of the Exodus of the Israelites from Egypt (Edward Arnold). The History of the Gospel, by C. H. Dodd, gives proofs to show that Christianity is an historical religion and that the New Testament is a series of authentic documents (Nisbet). A History of Roman Religion, by Franz Altheim, has been translated from the German by Harold Mattingly (Methuen). Dr. James Moffatt is the author of The First Five Centuries of the Church (Nashville, Cokesbury Press). The Lexikon f?r Theologie und Kirche (Herder) has been completed with the recent publication of volume X.</page><page sequence="3">492 NOTES AND COMMENTS Dr. C. Van Beek's Passio Sanctarum Perpetuae et Felicitatis (Dekker and Van de Vegt, Nymwegen) is a model of hagiographical editing. He publishes the longer Passio in both Latin and Greek, and the two Latin texts of the shorter Acta. The introductory material is elaborate and there are various indices. Van Beek has discovered Latin manuscripts unknown to previous editors, but the manuscript of the Greek version of the Passio remains unique. Specimen pages of a number of manuscripts are reproduced in facsimile. Fascicle VIII of the Dictionnaire de Spiritualit? (Cassien-Chappuis) has just been issued by Beauchesne. It contains a wealth of informative articles. Father M. Olphe-Galliard concludes his thorough study on Cassian. One would wish that he had written at greater length in his treatment of Cassiodorus, " the first to proclaim the sanctifying value of intellectual work ". Dom Gougaud has a brief but valuable article on " Cellule ". Monsignor Vernet writes on celibacy. It is gratifying to note that a fourth volume of Geschichte der latein? ischen Literatur des Mittelalters is being prepared by Professors M. Grab? mann and Paul Lehman. A Byzantinisches Handbuch, to consist of three volumes by various authors, is also announced by the C. H. Beek'sche Verlagsbuchhandlung. It will replace Krumbacher. Another interesting volume in preparation for the same series is Das Fortleben der antiken Literatur im Mittelalter, by Professor P. Lehmann. In A Catalogue of the Renaissance, Part I : Italy, compiled by E. Bryne Hackett, M.A. (New York, the Brick Row Shop, 55 Fifth Avenue, 1939, pp. 171), there are many rare and scarce offerings. An edition of Vesalius' Scholae medicorum Patauinae etc., is listed at $550.00, and A Unique and Truly Magnificent Collection of 80 Letters, Documents and Bullae, From Innocent IV (1234) to Pius X, at $1,250.00. An Aldine Aristotelis Opera of 1495 is listed at $800.00. In the Steps of St. Francis, by Ernest Raymond gives a new interpreta? tion of that saint's life in connection with subsequent history (Rich and Cowan). The Rev. E. A. Foran has written the story of the Augustinians, from St. Augustine to the Union, 1256 (Burns, Oates). Professor F. L. Ganshof, in Revue historique (July-September) shows that despite the Saracen invasions commercial navigation did not cease in the western Mediterranean during the eighth, ninth, and tenth centuries to the extent that the late Henri Pirenne maintained.</page><page sequence="4">NOTES AND COMMENTS 493 Vol. II of J. Guiraud's Histoire de l'Inquisition au Moyen Age is en? titled, U Inquisition au xiiie Si?cle en France, en Espagne, et en Italie (Paris, Picard). Among the recent biographies published by Messrs Longmans, Green and Company, are Johannes Jorgensen, St. Catherine of Siena, and Margaret Yeo, A Prince of Pastors, a biography of St. Charles Borromeo by one of the best known of modern hagiographers. The same firm announced in its fall list: The Vatican as a World Power, translated by George N. Shuster from the original of Joseph Bernhart; the Jacobean Age, by David Mathew, with consideration of the Catholic life of England; Marie Ward, by Ida F. Gorres-Coudenhove ; Julie Billiart and Her Institutes, by Sister F. de Chantal. Macmillan's list for autumn contains the following titles: Medieval Panorama, by G. G. Coulton; The Protestant Crusade, the story of the development of the anti-Catholic and anti-foreign feeling in the United States, by Ray A. Billington; The Marian Exiles, by Christina H. Garrett; God in History, a study of the contribution which Christianity has to make to the interpretation of history, by Otto Piper; Pre-Reformation England, by Canon H. Maynard-Smith ; and Liberty, Equality and Fraternity, a consideration of the economic problems of to-day in the light of the Catholic faith, by Monsignor Fulton Sheen. In the October issue of the Harvard Theological Review, Giuseppe Fur lani writes on the Basic Aspect of Hittite Religion; M. L. W. Laistner dis? cusses the question, "Was Bede the Author of a Penitential? "; Reinhold A. Dorwart treats of Church Organization in Brandenburg-Prussia from the Reformation to 1740; and Louis Finkelstein describes the Oldest Midrash: Pre-Rabbinic Ideals and Teachings in the Passover Haggadah. J. T. McNeill, in the recent Medieval Handbooks of Penance, is inclined to regard Bede as the author of the penitential attributed to him, but Dr. Laistner, in the article mentioned above, rejects his authorship and holds that the document was of continental origin. From the monastery of Silos come three articles, published in the October number of the Revue d'histoire eccl?siastique. Two are by J. P?rez de Urbel and the third by M. Alamo. They deal with the anonymous Regula Magistri (Migne, P. L. 88, 943-1052). It was believed that the rule originated in Merovingian France. P?rez de Urbel believes that it is the Spanish rule of Joannes Biclarensis, which is considered to be lost. He maintains that it shows the influence of St. Benedict's Rule. Alamo, on the other hand, holds for an earlier Spanish origin and considers it to have been one of St. Benedict's sources. Presumably they have opened up a</page><page sequence="5">494 NOTES AND COMMENTS subject that will give rise to considerable controversy. In the same number appears an article by Augustin Fliehe on " Les origines de Faction de la papaut? en vue de la croisade ". The topics of the notes in this issue are : " Le cartulaire et le classement ancien des archives de l'abbaye de Chis lenghien ", by Armand Louant ; and " A propos des registres de marguil? liers ", by C. R. Cheney. J. Lewis May has written a brief biography of F?nelon, Catholic and Mystic (Burns, Oates). J. Cal vet has prepared La Litt?rature de Fran?ois de Sales ? F?nelon (Paris, J. de Gigord). The numbers of Raz?n y Fe come regularly from Burgos, and those of Universidad from the University of Saragossa. Dr. Goetz Briefs has written an evaluation of Donoso Cort?s, a Christian Statesman and Political Philosopher, which appears in the Central Bureau Publications as Timely Topics Brochure XXXII. In his "The Consolation of History" (Month, August, 1938), Father James Brodrick, S.J., makes striking use of the reaction to the imprison? ment of Archbishop Clemens Augustus von Droste-Viehering by the Prus? sian Government in 1837, as an example of the "Church's inexhaustible vitality and power of recuperation". An interesting footnote to the article might have been given. At the Fourth Provincial Council of the American bishops, held in Baltimore in 1840, the prelates penned one of the most remarkable letters in our history?that of sympathy and en? couragement to the two Archbishops of Cologne and Gnesen-Posen which ends with these words: "Eia! Confessores, Martyres, Athletae Christi! Eia! qui pro vobis, qui vobiscum legitime certavit, ipse vos coronabit." (Cone. Prov. Baltimori habita, Balto., 1851, p. 181). The most recent issue of Bogoslovia, a theological quarterly in the Ruthenian language, published in Lwow, Poland, is a double number con? sisting of numbers 2 and 3 of volume XVI. The first article is that of Dr. Leo Hlynka on the codification of Oriental Church law, a paper read at a session of the Theological Society of the Greek Catholic Church in Lwow. A continuation of a monograph in Latin on the work, Petra Fidei, of Archbishop Stephen Jaworski is a contribution of Demetrius Mich alyshchuk. Dr. Stephen Sampara's article on primitive revelation and the first man follows. The next contribution is an historical paper by Dr. Volodimir Figol on ecclesiastical confraternities of the Greek Catholic Church in Galicia in the eighteenth century. One must also mention that</page><page sequence="6">NOTES AND COMMENTS 495 Dr. Jaroslaw Pasternak describes the crypt found below the chapel of the Greek Catholic Theological Academy in Lwow. One also finds signed reviews of Latin, French, German, Polish, and Czech books. These are followed by the usual Chronicle. The Royal Historical Society, London, has issued Writings on British History, 1935, the second volume of this annual bibliography (Jonathan Cape). After an absence of 400 years the Franciscans are back at Cambridge University, where St. Bonaventure's Friary has been opened as a house of studies for priests of the English province who are studying at the university. Father Claude Williamson is the editor of Great Catholics, a series of essays by a group of distinguished writers (Nicholson and Watson). Pre-Reformation England, by Canon H. Maynard-Smith, attempts to show the changes which were affecting the Church, apart from the divorce of Henry VIII (Macmillan). The thesis of Brian Magee's English Recusants is based upon the theory of Hilaire Belloc (who writes the introduction) that the process of turning England into a Protestant country was not so rapid as has been pictured (Burns, Oates). Shane Leslie's autobiography has appeared under the title, The Film of Memory (Michael Joseph). Another book of the same nature is Theodore Maynard's The World I Saw (Bruce). Dr. Curtis's new edition of his History of Medieval Ireland from 1086 to 1513 incorporates much of the researches of scholars which have appeared since the first edition fifteen years ago (Methuen). The articles in the Irish Historical Studies for September concern Anglo Norman Relations with Connacht, 1169-1224, by R. D. Edwards; and Research on Irish History in Irish, British, and American Universities, 1937-8. A careful and well-written biography, in two volumes, Marie Stuart, by Paule Henry-Bordeaux, emphasizes the religious struggle of the times, rather than the political, as the cause of Mary's destruction (Paris, Plon). The fifth annual meeting of the Canadian Catholic Historical Association was held at L?vis, October 5 and 6. The formal papers read concerned</page><page sequence="7">496 NOTES AND COMMENTS Some Non-Catholic Contributions to the Study of the Canadian and American Missions, by Thomas F. O'Connor; Some Aspects of the Re? ligious Policy of Great Britain in the Province of Quebec, 1760-1774, by George Buxton; the Parish of St. Columban, Lower Canada, by the Rev. Lawrence P. Whelan; the Parish of Richmond, Upper Canada, by the Rev. J. R. Murray; and the True Witness, by Miss Agnes Coffey. Three paper on the Church and Revolution, read at the 1937 meeting, have been reprinted from the Revue de l'Universit? d'Ottawa. These concerned the Political Revolution in the Sixteenth Century, by D. J. McDougall; "La r?volution rationaliste au dix-huiti?me si?cle ", by Henri Saint-Denis, O.M.I.; and Modem Revolution, by Henry Somerville. The Report of the annual meeting of the Canadian Historical Association (May 23-24, 1938) which has recently appeared, contains a paper by Monsignor Olivier Maurault, S.J., Rector of the University of Montreal, on the life and writings of Abb? Lionel-Adolphe Groulx, the well-known Canadian historian. Vols. II and III of Frank L. Mott's History of American Magazines have been issued by the Harvard University Press. Church History for September prints articles on the Swedish Church on the Delaware, by Conrad J. L. Bergendoff; Henry M. Turner, Negro Bishop Extraordinary, by J. Minton Batten; Anglicans and Dissenters in Georgia, 1758-1777, by Marjorie Daniel; and the Anthropomorphic Controversy in the Time of Theophilus of Alexandria, by Massey H. Shepherd, Jr. It is gratifying to see that the St. Meinrad Historical Essays (St. Meinrad Seminary, St. Meinrad, Indiana, November, 1938) continues to hold its worthy scholarly level. This present issue is devoted to St. Charles Borromeo and his great work of reform. The Bulletin of the National Catholic Educational Association for August is devoted to a Report of the Proceedings and Addresses of the 34th annual meeting of the association, March 31, April 1, 2, 1938. Articles in the June issue of the Records of the American Catholic Historical Society concern Bishop Martin Marty, O.S.B., 1834-1896, the Apostle of the Sioux Indians, by Ildefons Betschart, O.S.B. (translated by the Rev. Joseph Eisenbath, O.S.F.S.) ; and Catholic Exploration of the Far West, 1794-1835 (continued), by Ara Timourian.</page><page sequence="8">NOTES AND COMMENTS 497 The October issue of Mid-America has articles on Father Pfefferkorn and His Description of Sonora, by Theodore E. Treutlein; Samuel Charles Mazzuchelli, Dominican of the Frontier, by Gilbert J. Garraghan; and Jesuit Annual Letters in the Bancroft Library, by Peter M. Dunne. The November issue of the Historical Bulletin, a Catholic quarterly for teachers and students of history, contains a summary of the career of Emperor Charles the Fifth, by Laurence K. Patterson, S.J.; a critique of Mommsen's History of Rome, by William E. Dooley; and a contribution by W, Barby Faherty on Leo XIII and Historical Studies, a useful r?sum?. In the April (1938) number of the Annals of the Franciscan Province of the Sacred Heart appear accounts of the Catholic Chaplains of the Joliet Prison, XIII, by Leo Kalmer; the First American Bishop in China: Most Rev. Athanasius Goette, O.F.M. (1857-1908), by Marion Habig; and the Vicariate Apostolic of Chowtsun, by " Missionarius ". At the 54th annual meeting of the United States Catholic Historical Society, the paper was read by Dr. Francis M. Crowley, dean of the School of Education at Fordham University. The subject, "American Catholic Universities ", was chosen because of the golden jubilee now being com? memorated by the Catholic University of America, and because Georgetown University will, in 1939, observe its sesqui-centennial. At the meeting especial honor was paid to Thomas F. Meehan, the able and energetic editor of the society. Dr. Meehan, in America, November 12, evaluates the work of the society which began the United States Catholic Historical Magazine (1887-1891), has published 28 volumes of Records, and 17 volumes in its Monograph Series. The Puritans, by Perry Miller and Thomas H. Johnson, is devoted to New England Puritanism in the first 100 years of colonial life, and is largely made up of selections from the works of the representative writers of the age (American Book Co., pp. 866, $4.00). In the Proceedings of the American Antiquarian Society, vol. 47, N. S., part 2, will be found, in addition to the usual reports, etc., an important contribution by Randolph G. Adams who presents several documents which throw New Light on the Boston Massacre (pp. 259-354). A souvenir volume of the ceremonies held in Maryland in 1937, in celebration of the bicentenary of the birth of Charles Carroll of Carrollton, has been issued by the Charles Carroll of Carrollton Commission. The book prints in full the sermon delivered by Monsignor Guilday at the field Mass celebrated at Doughoregan Manor.</page><page sequence="9">498 NOTES AND COMMENTS With Dr. William F. Obering's research monograph on The Philosophy of Law of James Wilson, Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, 1789-1798, the American Catholic Philosophical Association inaugurates a series of Philosophical Studies which is expected to appear annually. This new venture is the association's third publication, the other two being the New Scholasticism, a quarterly journal, and the Proceedings, containing the papers read at the annual meetings. The American Constitutions and Religion (pp. 142), compiled by Pro? fessor C. H. Moehlman of the Colgate-Rochester Divinity School, is a handy volume containing the pertinent excerpts on the status of religious freedom in the colonial and federal charters and constitutions. The book needs a concluding summary. Two Catholic heroes have been approved as topics for " creative writing " in the English department of the University of Iowa. A doctoral disserta? tion is being prepared on Father Jean Pierre De Smet, S.J., and a master's thesis on Father Samuel C. G. Mazzuchelli, O.P. Father Thomas J. Stanton of Catonsville, Maryland, has written The Souvenir History: Centenary of St. Paul's Church, EUicott City, Maryland, 1838-1939. Out of the first ten pastors, three were called to the episcopate ?Bishop-elect Henry B. Coskery, who declined the See of Portland, Maine; Bishop Augustine Verot, S.S., of Savannah, Georgia, and later of St. Augustine, Florida; and Bishop John S. Foley, of Detroit, Michigan. The Aurora und Christliche Woche of Buffalo for October 28, 1938, con? tains a valuable historical sketch of Father Peter Helbron, O.M.Cap., and his ministry in Buffalo, by Rev. George Timpe, PJ3.M. Der Wanderer, a Catholic weekly edited by Joseph Matt, St. Paul, Minn., recently published a timely contribution on Race and Blood, by Dr. Charles P. Bruehl, St. Charles Seminary, Overbrook, Pa. In 1940, the Society of Jesus will celebrate the fourth centenary of its confirmation by Paul III. The occasion will call forth a number of historical studies. The greater number of these will deal with the history of parishes and schools. Several biographical sketches are also in prepara? tion. Most important among these publications is Father Gilbert J. Garraghan's three-volume work, devoted to Jesuit activities in the old Missouri Province, which embraced practically the whole Mississippi Valley. The Kansas Catholic Historical Society has been revived after a period of lethargy, the impetus coming, it seems, from a Benedictine teacher of mathematics at Atchison. Membership dues are in abeyance "until the Society has something to offer ". During the current year a sizable money</page><page sequence="10">NOTES AND COMMENTS 499 prize will be awarded to the high school student who contributes " the best historical document for the archives ". On the advisory committee are three historians from the three women's colleges of Kansas: Sister Mary Paul of St. Mary's, Sister M. Evangeline of Marymount, and Sister M. Regina of St. Scholastica's. Mr. W. W. Graves, editor of The Journal Press, of St. Paul, Kansas, is doing commendable work in the Catholic history of Kansas. The Graves Historical Series now embraces seven publications, including two novels. Several additional studies are in preparation, of which the first to appear will be a Life of Mother Bridget, of the Sisters of Loretto. Mr. Graves is an amateur, free lance historian who grew up in the historic Osage Mission, does his research and writes his monographs in such odd moments as can be spared from his journalistic duties, superintends his own printing and directs the distribution of his publications. This is an excellent example of local history written on the ground where it was enacted, by one who has known the people and the events he portrays. Mr. Graves is also prominent in Knights of Columbus activities, and is one of the organizers of the Kansas Catholic Historical Society. Regis College, Denver, has begun its golden jubilee celebration. An historical sketch of the growth of the college will throw considerable light upon Catholic education in Colorado. Pioneer Black Robes on the West Coast, by Peter M. Dunne, is now in press. This volume is the second of the series sponsored by Herbert E. Bolton of the University of California. The series was introduced by Father Jerome V. Jacobson's Educational Foundations of the Jesuits in Sixteenth-Century New Spain. An earlier volume, Gonzalo de Tapia, by Father W. Eugene Shiels of the Jesuit Institute in Chicago, was published in the Records and Studies series. Other students of Professor Bolton will continue to expand the Jesu?tica of the Pacific area. The California Historical Society has recently placed at the Mission Dolores, San Francisco, a plaque in honor of Padre Francisco Palou. The Rev. Dr. Gerald J. Geary made the dedicatory address; and at a luncheon meeting following the exercises Dr. Herbert E. Bolton spoke on the career of Palou. The approaching jubilee of the Church in Montana has awakened a new interest in the Catholic history of the Northwest. Msgr. Victor Day's recent volume, The Cathedral of St. Helena, is a very presentable monu? ment to the courage and generosity that built the magnificent cathedral. Several research projects are under way. There is a movement to place Father De Smet in the Hall of Statuary at Washington.</page><page sequence="11">500 NOTES AND COMMENTS The Journal of Father Jean-Baptiste Bolduc, member of the Hudson's Bay Company's expedition which founded Victoria, B.C., has been trans? lated into English for the University of Washington's Library, which owns the original and a copy of Father Bolduc's second journal. Extensive repairs on the Cabildo and other historical buildings of Louisiana have been made possible through WPA funds. The Government outlay amounted to $300,000. With due regard for historical features, the buildings have been modernized, and rendered more serviceable. Another WPA project of interest to historians is the Osage Museum at Pawhuska, Oklahoma. The Government has spent $25,000. But the Osages, led by several historical-minded members of the fast dwindling tribe, are mani? festing an active interest in their own monumenta. They are scouring the country for relics of various kinds which enable them to trace their history back to the Marquette expedition of 1673. With an eye on the future, they are gathering photographic and phonographic records of the Osages as they are at present. All this will be a contribution to the history of our Indian Missions. An interesting project now under advisement by WPA officials in Illinois is the restoration of the old village of Cahokia as it was in French colonial days. Cahokia, founded in 1699 by priests of the Society of the Foreign Missions, is the oldest existing settlement in Illinois with the possible exception of Peoria. Its log church of the Holy Family, first used in 1799, is the most ancient house of worship in the state. The area to be restored will embrace this venerable shrine, the old Cahokia Court House, and a number of century-old dwelling houses of French architectural style. The University of Texas has announced the acquisition of the Garcia Icazbalceta collection of Mexican historical documents and books?160 volumes and 50,000 pages of manuscripts. Documents.
