While they bake mud pies or construct worm playgrounds, you may catch them conducting playful experi- ments. Listen to them. Amidst giggling you may hear an exchange of observations or well thought- out theories. Playfully explore with children, and you may be astonished how their attention far outlasts yours. Children use many of the same sci- ence process skills as adult scien- tists do. Similarly they develop ideas about our world based on ex- periences with real things. Though kids' naive notions may often seem silly, they are the offspring of seri- ous thought. Children usually don't need mo- tivation to stick their noses into nature, but they do need patron- age.

Science, like walking, talking, and breathing, doesn't require direct instruction, but it does take practice to perfect. As a science patron your role is to facilitate, rather than direct, chil- dren's explorations. Support open-ended inquiry Prescriptive science ac- tivities confine the breadth and intensity of a child's in- quiry. In fact, many young children actively rebel when placed in a situation in which there is only one option. The open-ended, free-choice activities of- fered in early childhood classrooms allow children to follow their own paths of inquiry. When we allow children choices in how they practice science, we are treated to a kaleido- scope of unique and mean- ingful explorations. One boy I frequently ob- served had been diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. It was a struggle for him to remain attentive to directed ac- tivities, but his attention was boundless when given freedom to experiment and explore. When we played with flying things, this boy experimented through recess.

We all learn at dif- ferent levels of attention; kids learn best when given choice and the time to explore. Supply instruments of play When supplied with a wide array of equipment, children can readily pursue divergent investigations. Watch children exploring, and you may observe them pausing during an investigation to search for the right tool, be it a magnifying lens or a stethoscope. Since children's play reaches both into the world of reality and the realm of fantasy, tools may be used in a wide variety of ways. For example, a stethoscope may be used as a prop for medical role- playing, become a listening tool, or turn into something totally unre- lated to its function. By itself each tool helps a child fo- cus on a particular avenue of explo- ration. For example, a child with a magnifying lens is bound to look closely at things, while a child with a mirror may end up playing with light. Tools can be assembled as ex- plorer kits. These kits are arrays of tools and materials that send kids off on various paths of playful investiga- tion. Each focuses on a general realm of discovery, but, as you will see, children will choose their own routes. Kits can and should be modi- fied to fit children's investigative re- actions and the materials at hand. Allow children to add to and modify the kits. Let them become theirs! Store kit materials in plastic tubs and label each item with a colorful sticker so that children can easily identify the proper tub to which to return each tool. Tubs store easily on shelves or carts. With funds from a California Kindergarten As- sociation grant, my fellow re- searcher Allison Bown and I had a prototype science cart constructed by a local cabinetmaker. This cart has space for all the kits and is eas- ily moved to other classrooms. Lightworks You will need • small Plexiglas or metal mirrors • a marblescope or kaleidoscope • Mylar or chrome tubes • convex/concave mirrors • Lucite or glass prisms • prism viewers • tinfoil • spectroscopes • quartz and calcite crystals • small blocks for propping mirrors • Fresnel lenses The setup Discuss the care of fragile items, such as prisms, before letting chil- dren explore. Outdoor exploration is ideal if you can monitor equip- ment use to prevent items from becoming lost. The science The physics of light is not lightweight, but children will playfully in- vestigate reflection (the bouncing of light rays) and refraction (the change in directions of light rays). Kids may also tumble into the color spectrum and stumble upon symmetry. Light talk "Everybody is a rainbow," Rico announced from behind a large prism. "If you put tinfoil under the prism, it looks like the tinfoil is inside of it," instructed Nick. "It's like a crystal," stated Ali. Ideas and observations bounced at the speed of light from one child to another. Following Alex's lead, Katelyn created a mirror by molding a piece of tinfoil around one side of her prism. "I can see my eye," she announced. Nick showed Alex how to use a mirror to reflect light onto the wall of the school. Rico watched and soon was shining light into the faces of people who quickly asked him to stop. Within a few minutes most of the kids were making light patterns on the wall. Lea watched and asked, "How do you do that?" Then she filled a small plastic container with grass and examined it through a prism. She told Katie, "Look, the grass is a rainbow." Nick and Alex lined up several mirrors to make a solar mousetrap. They announced to others, "See, when the mouse walks here, the prism reflects light in its eyes and then the mirror will fall on the mouse when it goes back in the hole." Safely supervise When a variety of tools is made available, children embark on unique explorations. By keeping an eye on their activities, you can anticipate their needs and steer them away from danger or damaging equip- ment. As children develop an inter- est in certain types of explorations, such as taking things apart, you can designate areas where that activity is appropriate.

When the wind comes up, it's time for wind play. During a snowstorm bundling up to explore crystals is a timely choice. One kindergarten class, after several days of rain, chose to make use of the vast play- ground puddles by building boats. The room was transformed into a shipyard as unique vessels were shaped from foam, paper, straws, and a whole host of other materials. As their boats navigated the muddy waters, children made discoveries about porosity, density, imperme- ability, and general seaworthiness.

A quick demonstration of tool use provides children with the ba- sics on using the tools. Let children know that nothing should be used like a hammer or a pick. Be ready to in- tervene when you ob- serve unsafe tool use. Cut off the plugs of cords so that kids can't plug them into out- lets. Tell children that they should not take apart anything at home unless an adult says they can. The science Dismantling appliances is a true investigation of the science behind technology. Kids wonder how things work and what different parts are for. The exploration is a great introduction to electrical cir- cuits, pulleys, springs, levers, magnets, and other components used in daily life. Kids learn to use a variety of tools and gain much practice in sharing scientific equipment. Take-apart talk A VCR is a treasure chest of colorful wires, pre- cious circuit boards, pulleys, magnets, gears, and other intriguing gizmos. There were enough screws to remove to give all the kids ample practice. After an hour the children were impressed by their ini- tial booty. After three days there was a mass of won- derful parts with which to play. What looked like serious destruction was also se- rious exploration. Kids fiddled with gears, buttons, and springs to discover how stuff worked. One child discovered the spring that made the door to the cassette player swing open. Another child ran about display- ing a magnet he had discovered. A girl excitedly showed her co- workers the little "points," as she called them, (transistors) on the circuit board. Some children were trouble- shooters par excellence: "This is why it didn't work - the battery wasn't charged," ex- plained Amanda as she held up a capacitor. "1 know why it didn't work," an- nounced Ricky as he pointed to a resistor, "It's burnt." "We cut all these [wires] so we wouldn't get shocked." Leann pointed to a pile of screws she had unscrewed and exclaimed, "Look at all these nails here." Other kids knew what circuit boards were. They all learned new terms by listening to each other. Nick exclaimed, "Alex, let's pretend we are wire guys, 'rr- boing-rrr.'" Rico informed us as he pointed to the let- ters on the VCR controls, "I'll take off the ABCs" They continued to take apart more ABCs and ev- erything else for months. schoolyard, or classroom can be- come equally alluring. All that is needed are diversity and surprises. A walk in the park may reveal hid- den caterpillars or sparkling rocks. The discoveries are unpredictable. When we supply our kids with a variety of materials and tools, when we grow gardens or take in small critters as visitors, we are sowing adventures. It doesn't cost much in time or money. It needn't be dan- gerous or messy. You merely need the time and place. Without much effort you can trans- form your backyard or schoolyard into a real kindergarten. Truck tires filled with soil make great planter boxes. Cucumbers, peas, and beans can easily climb up and cover chain-link fences.

When one class of kindergarten kids found a book about worms af- ter having played with worms for several days, it was an absolute bonanza. Their teacher was at- tacked by voracious learners, with "What does this say?" and "Read it to me." As you see children explor- ing new things, make both fiction and nonfiction books on those top- ics available. Literature can also set the stage for discovery. If you read a book about spiders and then see a spi- der, you are ready to face it with a curiosity that is already primed. Does it have eight legs? Is it a black widow? Does it have a web? Much of children's literature deals with nature in a mixture of fantasy and reality.

These tools can alert children to the intensity of air movements and may set air explorations into motion.

As kids play with wind toys, they build con- cepts and apply them to using the wind. Who knows, perhaps these discoveries will lead to careers as sailors, kite fly- ers, or even weather forecasters. Party talk The breezy fall afternoon at the play park was a perfect time for the Windy Day Party. Matteo set the wind wands upright in a go- pher mound and watched the dancing ribbons. Nick raced up and down the field catching air in a plastic bag that was attached to a dried sunflower stalk. Three-year-old Nikita held three pinwheels firmly in her hand. Occasionally she shook them or blew on them. Claire held a larger one and blew into it. It moved slowly until she turned it into the wind. As it whirled, Claire exclaimed, "The wind blowed it for me. It did!" Later she went inside and returned with paper and pens. With a delighted grin she explained, "I know a wind thing. We can make airplanes." Airplane construction began immediately as Claire and Nick fashioned simple models from the paper. Once launched, they flew - due more to the breeze than to engineering. With the flare of circus performers, Brooks and Matteo dashed about waving fluttering wind wands. Like rippling flags the ribbons gave voice to the wind. Leaves fluttered. Paper blew across the grass. Kids whirled and swirled with the frisky breeze. 10 Young Children • March 2000</page><page sequence="6">A kinder garden needn't be manicured or tamed .

It is an anthropomorphic tale like the traditional tales of cultures from around the world. These tales, which bridge the gap between what we know and don't know, are a chal- lenge for the child. Share respect for life Animals capture the hearts and souls of young people. Whether in fear or friendship, strong emotions develop for the other creatures that share our planet. By a young age many children have had extensive experience with small backyard critters, while others have been isolated by lack of opportunity or, worse yet, by reluctance. A child frightened by a dog may avoid other mammals. A child warned about spiders and other bugs may shy away from all crawly crit- ters. When kids can watch other chil- dren joyfully and safely explore small critters, they are apt to abandon fears and get swept away by fascination. Along with learning how to treat their peers, kids can learn to re- spect other living things. Through positive role-modeling, stories, and extensive play, children can de- velop empathy for fellow animals. In a violent society, learning to love living things in general is a first step in evolving a greater life ethic. Share your love of living things and rescue those little creatures from intentional or unintentional harm whenever it's necessary. As kids emulate your respectful attitude they'll guide their younger colleagues. Seek community involvement You can help children learn from experts in the community. For in- stance, if children show an interest in exploring birds, you can contact the local bird club. Invite parents and other adult helpers to watch chil- dren while they explore. To educate Digging You will need • food containers of various sizes • cookie cutters and molds • a large horseshoe magnet • kitchen strainers • trowels or small sand shovels • spoons or forks The setup Set aside an area in part of your garden, backyard, or schoolyard where children can dig without getting into trouble. This could be a fallow bed, a designated dig site, or just an unused corner. Tie a long piece of bright yarn to tools to make them easy to find. The science Soil is more than a substance. It is a rich ecosystem composed of interacting plants and animals. As children play in soil, more accu- mulates than the obvious dirt on their hands and clothes. Poking about in the earth uncovers questions and experiences that lead to a greater understanding of the complexity of the ground beneath our feet. Dirt discoveries "Hey, this isn't rock," Rhyen exclaimed as he broke a dirt clod. "It has rock in it," countered Pearl. "Yeah, here's rocks," said Rhyen, holding up some pebbles in his palm. As Krista and Dana dug in some dry, dusty soil, they discovered a gaping gopher hole. Krista declared that the hole "itched" and con- tinued to excavate. Children often had spent recess exploring the soil in a fallow sec- tion of the school garden. Once, for several days a group unearthed the interlinking tun- nels of resident gophers with as much care as a team of archaeologists. At other times kids pre- tended to mine and washed off their "gem" discoveries in the drink- ing fountain. Sifting led to discoveries of roots, which several children called "hair," and "spe- cial" rocks. And of course when water was brought onto the scene, dirt piles transformed into dirt soup, mud pies, or hot chocolate.

Roly-polies may accidently be crushed by kids who still grasp things with a strong pincer grasp. Encourage these children to pick up roly-polies with a stick or brush. Setup is best at an indoor or outdoor table. Children can keep track of roly-polies if they are provided with cups or tubs to keep them in. Keep an eye on roly- polies to make sure none are ending up on the floor where they can be crushed by giant kid feet. The science Children may be particularly attentive to the way in which roly-polies move and how they curl up in a ball. Roly-poly reactions to light and water may also be subjects of study. Other children may won- der what roly-polies eat and even investigate their food preferences. Care and feeding Roly-polies are common residents of gardens and yards. Look for them under rocks, boards, or com- post piles. In cold climates they may be difficult to find in winter. Roly-polies survive comfortably in a plastic tub if provided with a layer of moist soil covered with moist dead leaves. Feed them fruit scraps and keep the soil moist, not soggy. Roly-poly reactions Rhea weis excited. "It's hiding. This is cool." Her roly-poly was crawling on a stem and she predicted to Nathan, "It's on the stick, and it's gonna fall off." Meanwhile Nathan was peering through the lens, look- ing at rainbows. Nearby Nalani was carefully examining a roly-poly through the lens. She peered at it from different angles and distances. Emma and Nick were busy making a roly-poly house with a tub and a plastic bag. Emily made a house with a yogurt container and an ivy leaf for the roof. She placed her roly-polies inside and covered them with dirt. Along with homes, other great discoveries arose from the play. Nalani and Rhea found out they could pick up the pill bugs by placing a stick in front of them to climb aboard. Nick spied "eggs" on the un- derside of one roly-poly. As Emily dropped bits of leaves into the tub, she said to the roly-polies, "Do you want to eat a leaf? Do you want to eat a stick? He's eating. They like sticks. They like leaves!" Another day when we had the roly-polies set up at an outside table, all of the children abandoned the roly-polies after about 15 minutes, except two-year- old Sean. He stayed and played with the roly-polies for over 50 minutes while other children stopped by to see what he was doing.
