By examining the rhetorical strategies  that drive kabbalistic image production and the processes by which images  transform mindful readers, this work demonstrates that Kabbalah’s images  function within elaborate symbolic networks whose purpose is to produce a  contemplative, and ultimately transformative, spirituality. The essay elaborates  this claim with insights from anthropology and psychoanalytic performance theory,  and defends it with readings of passages from Sefer hazohar that demonstrate two  specific rhetorical strategies: the image series and the kabbalistic “mixed metaphor.” I N T R o d u C T I o N :  K A B B A L I S T I C  I M A g E R y  A N d  T H E   P R o d u C T I o N  o f  K A B B A L I S T S One of theosophical Kabbalah’s most distinctive features is its attempt to convey  the otherness of God by using vivid, shifting divine imagery. This essay addresses  two topics: the rhetorical strategy that drives kabbalistic image production and  the anthropology by which the images’ movements transform the mindful reader.  These two functions, rhetoric and anthropology, are bound inextricably together  in kabbalistic text because Kabbalah’s literary images seek not only to communic cate ideas and delight through poetical hermeneutics, but also to demand anthroc PROOFTEXTS 28 (2008): 335–362.

This is particularly true of Sefer  hazohar, the quintessential text of classical thirteenthccentury Kabbalah. According to theosophical Kabbalah, divinity, whose concealed and unknowc able being is referred to as Ein Sof (Without End), reveals itself to humanity in ten  stages of divine life known as sefirot.1 Each of these sefirot can be understood as a  complex symbol encompassing a broad variety of related metaphoric images that  convey information regarding gender, emotional content, role in transmission of  divine energy, and more. In such a system, the role of kabbalistic imagery not just in  reflecting, but also in actively shaping religious experience, should be of central  concern. By focusing on anthropological effects of kabbalistic images, the study of  Jewish mysticism can address the ways in which religious imagery transforms  culture, theology, and self. In this essay, I suggest that far from being relegated to  aesthetic appreciation or communication of ideas, literary symbolism plays a more  active role in shaping the kabbalist’s understanding of himself, his relationship with  God, and his experience of this connection. Central to this argument is the idea that  rather than serving purely as interpretive tools, kabbalistic literary images instead  function within elaborate symbolic networks whose purpose is to produce a contemc plative, and ultimately transformative, spirituality on the part of the mindful reader.  This essay suggests that the literary images of kabbalistic texts in general,  and of the Zohar in particular, have a material goal: the production of kabbalists.  The mechanism driving this production is the movement of the text’s powerful  images. In the Zohar, a strong symbolic image both simplifies and complicates a  concept, reducing it to a coherent experiential impression while opening it to a  network of associations and connotations that stimulate thought. This stimulac tion allows the image to renew and inspire the contemplative reader’s engagement  with the world. It is this profound interpenetration of theology and its anthropoc logical realization that transforms a man into a mystic. Indeed, the beauty of  metaphoric and symbolic representation is that in these figures thought and action  become intertwined, reshaping the internal world of the mind, and thus the  person’s relationship with the external world.2  The thesis I am suggesting here, that kabbalistic literary imagery strategic cally encourages the production of kabbalists through its unusual presentation  and organization, intervenes in an existing conversation among scholars of  PROOFTEXTS 28: 3 </page> <page sequence="3"> Metaphor, Transformation, and Transcendence    y  337 Kabbalah. I will explain the nature of this intervention, elaborate it with insights  from anthropology and psychoanalytic performance theory, and defend it with  readings of Zoharic passages that demonstrate two specific kabbalistic literary  strategies: the image series and the kabbalistic “mixed metaphor.” R E A d I N g  C o M P L E x  I M A g E S :  T H E  R o L E  o f  S y M B o L  I N  K A B B A L A H Understanding the role of literary symbols in Kabbalah is far from simple. The  shifting, multivocal nature of kabbalistic imagery combined with its undeniable  fondness for mixed metaphors introduces a series of questions with which  contemporary scholars of Kabbalah must struggle. For example, if a single sefirah  (in this case, the tenth) is described using a variety of metaphors, such as the  anthropomorphic images of mother and bride, the natural metaphors of lake and  lily, and the material images of gateway and well (to name only a few of the  images associated with the tenth sefirah), are all of the images mutually undifferc entiated, or do they bear individual connotations of nurture, eroticism, abunc dance, and liminality? Furthermore, do textual passages that blend these varied  images serve a contemplative purpose, structuring kabbalistic concepts of God  and self, or are they merely exercises in literary fantasy? What is the connection  between aesthetics, hermeneutics, and functionality in these writings? Despite the extreme complexity and interpenetration of images associated with  each sefirah, one dominant scholarly trend suggests that kabbalistic images serve  mainly as an interpretive code for reading scripture. In this understanding, indic vidual images blur into a symbolic complex in which they become relativized and  undifferentiated, with each pointing equally to the same scriptural reference or  sefirotic gradation. Arthur Green, for example, suggests that individual kabbalistic  symbols are incorporated “into a single associative cluster, the members of which  become interchangeable with one another.”3 He also asserts, “The individual  symbolcterm loses a good deal of its identity by belonging to the cluster.”4 Green  sees this as a positive development that allows for “a freedom of imagecplay previc ously unimagined.”5 However, he also notes that the sefirot can be read as “a fixed  system of allegorical equivalences,”—in other words, as a code.6  Fall 2008 </page> <page sequence="4"> 338  y    ELLEN HASKELL Moshe Idel, in a similar move, understands the sefirotic system as “imposing  a code on the Jewish canonical writings.”7 He writes, “My basic assumption is that  in many sources, the ten sefirot function as a code by means of which the Kabbalc ists interpreted canonical texts.”8 Idel defines symbolism as “a way of reflecting the  divine attributes or worlds by means of a sustained exegesis of scripture.”9 For  him, an imagecterm such as bride, which is commonly used for the tenth sefirah,  signifies a position on a “map” of divinity and divine dynamics, allowing a kabbalc istic textual interpretation. In this understanding, the imagecterm serves purely as  an interpretive tool, rather than as a specific image within a network whose relac tionships give rise to contemplation. On a practical level, the “code” reading of  kabbalistic images indicates that whether a text uses the figure of bride, lake,  well, moon, or gateway makes very little difference to the reader, since that reader  understands all of these terms as referring equally to the same sefirah. This underc standing in turn points to a particular scriptural interpretation, in which biblical  literature serves as a forum for engaging the dynamics of the sefirot.  According to Idel’s reading, one of the most important results of this system  is its enhancement of performative kabbalistic ritual, rather than of Kabbalah’s  contemplative value.10 He writes, “A Kabbalistic symbol invited one to act rather  than to think.”11 Idel identifies Sefer hazohar as a unique text among kabbalistic  writings, identifying it as “both the first major outpouring and the climax of  Kabbalistic symbolic creation.”12 Nonetheless, he emphasizes what he sees as the  Zohar’s focus on action rather than on contemplation, commenting, “Although its  symbolism may indeed invite someone to contemplation, his awareness of certain  theosophical and anthropological ideas does not change man.”13 For Idel, contemc plation of the Zoharic text is not an internally transformative experience, but  rather a guide to performative action. This reading is particularly interesting  when one considers that great portions of the Zohar are engaged in scriptural  interpretation and imagecrich presentations of divine dynamics, the reading of  which do not immediately call for kabbalistic action.  Idel and Green’s thoughts on the nature of kabbalistic imagery moderate the  writings of Gershom Scholem, who claims a transcendent power for kabbalistic  symbol that approaches the ontological. Readings such as those of Green and Idel  help to discipline Scholem’s ontological excesses, and demonstrate a clear relac PROOFTEXTS 28: 3 </page> <page sequence="5"> Metaphor, Transformation, and Transcendence    y  339 tionship between kabbalistic thought and Jewish hermeneutics. For example,  Scholem writes, “In the mystical symbol a reality which in itself has, for us, no  form or shape becomes transparent and, as it were, visible, through the medium  of another reality which clothes its content with visible and expressible meaning.”14  Idel has justifiably criticized Scholem’s reading, demonstrating its link to the  German Romantic idea of symbolism and questioning its emphasis on the ineffac bility of the divine realm. In his view, excessive focus on kabbalistic symbolism  and its role in mystical contemplation introduces a disconnect between mystical  concepts and their function within meaningful systems that integrate the  kabbalist, his worldview, and his actions.15 He sees the legacy of Scholem’s  approach to Kabbalah as a “tendency to conceive this mystical lore in more theoc logical rather than experiential terms.”16 Thus, Idel implies that the necessary  corrective to an historical academic focus on contemplation involves shifting  scholarly emphasis to the sphere of human action, highlighting kabbalistic perforc mance rather than contemplation of what he considers a symbolic coding system.  Further perspective on reading symbols in Jewish mysticism can be found in  the works of Elliot Wolfson and Michael Fishbane, both of whom see kabbalistic  imagery as having a role beyond that of an interpretive code. While Wolfson does  not ascribe ontological function to kabbalistic symbols in the manner of Scholem,  he mediates the perspectives of Scholem and that of Idel and Green. For Wolfson,  the virtue of kabbalistic symbol is that it “articulates experience but in such a  manner that casts doubt upon the virtue of differentiating truth from appearc ance.”17 In this reading, the virtue of symbol is precisely that it confuses internal  and external interpretations of a person’s surroundings, creating a movement that  can certainly lead to transformative religious experience and an altered perception  of reality.18 A similar reading of Jewish literary imagery appears in Michael Fishc bane, who writes about myth’s ability to “comprise and condition a mystical  mentality,” allowing an interpenetration of internal and external worldviews.19  These presentations of Jewish mystical imagery rely neither upon ontological  explanations, nor upon a denial of ontological explanations, but rather embrace a  perspective grounded in the transformative capabilities of symbol itself. The writings of Wolfson and Fishbane seem to call for an exploration of  precisely how kabbalistic imagery creates meaningful religious experience, while  Fall 2008 </page> <page sequence="6"> 340  y    ELLEN HASKELL the ideas of Idel and Green imply the need for further discussion of the relationc ship between symbol, contemplation, and action. Drawing on these views, I  would like to approach the questions of how understanding kabbalistic symbol as  an interpretive code may place excessive constraint upon understanding kabbalc istic production and how kabbalistic production engages with mindful reading of  kabbalistic literature.20 Although it is certainly true that mere awareness of ideas  does not create a transformative experience, it seems reasonable to question  whether the goal of kabbalistic literature is simply to bring ideas to a reader’s  awareness, or to provoke a particular series of actions. I would suggest that for a  truly transformative religious experience, there must be a combination of awarec ness, contemplation, and performance working in concert, mutually reinforcing  each other in a way that fundamentally alters a person’s engagement with the  world.21 In addition, I would argue that the interpenetration of understanding,  thought, and action distinguishes the lay Jew from the kabbalist who practices  many of the same rituals, but with different understandings and motivations.  This position on figurative imagery’s ability to act upon the person in transforc mative ways is reinforced by the psychological insights of Jacques Lacan and Judith  Butler, who emphasize language’s important role in the construction and transforc mation of selfcunderstanding. Lacan, in his psychoanalytic writings, explains that  language does not simply describe the world to the person, but instead acts in a  multidirectional fashion, reciprocally shaping the person through the norms it  describes. He writes, “This passion of the signifier then becomes a new dimension  of the human condition, in that it is not only man who speaks, but in man and  through man that it speaks, that his nature is woven by effects in which we can find  the structure of language, whose material he becomes.”22 A similar theme has also  been developed by Judith Butler, who writes, “The mimetic or representational  status of language, which claims that signs follow bodies as their necessary mirrors,  is not mimetic at all. On the contrary, it is productive, constitutive, one might even  argue performative, inasmuch as this signifying act delimits and contours the body  that it then claims to find prior to any and all signification.”23 Lacan and Butler  identify a reciprocal interaction between a person and the language with which the  person engages.24 According to their perspective, literary images do not serve simply  as descriptions for things tangible or otherwise, but also are models that construct  PROOFTEXTS 28: 3 </page> <page sequence="7"> Metaphor, Transformation, and Transcendence    y  341 and transform cultural selfcunderstanding. This understanding may ultimately lead  to performance, but developing selfcperception through the medium of language  (and in our case, through the medium of kabbalistic literary imagery) intervenes as  a necessary step in the process. That complex literary imagery can provide models for selfctransformation is  noteworthy because one of Kabbalah’s most important teachings is a profoundly  active acceptance of imitatio dei. In this system, the human being not only reflects  the divine being in microcosm, but through this reflection is able to affect and  transform the qualities of divinity, with the person acting upon God even as God  acts upon the person. The Lacanian idea that engagement with language affects  the human being is critical to kabbalistic theology, in which it is intended that  words, images, and ideas will indeed have profound effects upon self, God, and  world. Contemplating kabbalistic imagery is a necessary phase in the journey  toward divine imitation. Lacan and Butler’s work suggests how Kabbalah’s  powerful and unusual linguistic images can lead to mystical selfctransformation  through intensive and deliberate textual engagement. This focus on mindful, deliberate textual engagement helps to complicate  the idea of reading kabbalistic symbols as a code. While kabbalistic image terms  can be mutually identified within a mystical code (i.e., the moon, the queen, and  the well all indicate the tenth sefirah), these images need not lose the power of  their individual natures. Individual sefirot are represented through striking, diverse  images whose connotations interact with each other in complex ways, structuring  and reorganizing the kabbalist’s perceptions of himself, his God, and the relac tionship between the two. For example, a person who relates to divinity primarily  through royal imagery will have a differently organized concept of his relationc ship to God than someone who draws primarily on natural imagery. A person  who combines these two types of images will have a still different and perhaps  even more complex understanding of his relationship to the transcendent, and the  implications of that relationship for his own engagement with the world.  These reorganized perceptions ultimately function to transform a man into a  mystic by altering his basic concepts of God and self, as well as the expression of  these concepts in his daily actions.25 Each symbolic or metaphoric image a person  encounters makes a movement in the mind, leading to a different series of connoc Fall 2008 </page> <page sequence="8"> 342  y    ELLEN HASKELL tative nuances, and restructuring perceptions of experiential reality. While  sefirotic symbolcclusters are indeed mutually associated, the individual images of  which they are comprised must still bear distinct connotations and make unique  contributions to kabbalistic thought, effecting a transformation upon the reader  through contemplation of complex theological imagery and its elements. This process is possible because symbol, along with its associated images and  metaphors, is essentially a cognitive tool used for complex communication.26  Symbolic and metaphoric images serve as cognitive mechanisms that provide  experiential understanding of the subjects they signify. Far from being poetic  conceits, they represent an essential means of communicating ideas and ideologies  at a holistic level. They do this by endowing their readers with nuanced concepc tual experiences, textured by both structural and affective import. In approaching  a kabbalistic text such as the Zohar, it is important to understand a kabbalistic  symbol, or theological image, as possessing the full potential of a nonkabbalistic  symbol. Furthermore, if we are willing to take these kabbalistic images as fully  realized mediators of religious cognition, it is possible to open them up and  observe the ways that they complicate, structure, and define reality for their  readers. Awareness of theological ideas may not change an individual, but full  acceptance of ideas that provide new understandings of the self’s role within a  restructured worldview can transform the human being.

This late thirteenthccentury work  from northern Spain occupies a position of authority and popularity unparalleled  in kabbalistic literature, and its tremendous influence is due in no small part to its  vivid use of complex theological images and the networks of meaning that these  images produce. The specific Zoharic symbol strategies I would like to address  here are the image series and the kabbalistic “mixed metaphor.” In the image  PROOFTEXTS 28: 3 </page> <page sequence="9"> Metaphor, Transformation, and Transcendence    y  343 series, several symbols are connected sequentially to create movement in the readc er’s mind that leads to a transformative perception of the human being’s place  within the kabbalistic cosmology. In the kabbalistic “mixed metaphor,” images  are blended together during the description of a divine attribute or action. This  blending provides a complex contemplative model for the reader who must situate  himself or herself psychologically in relation to the connotations of each distinct  metaphor as well as in relation to these images’ interactions. The latter technique  in particular produces a radically different reading of kabbalistic symbol than  does the “code” reading mentioned above in the discussion of Green and Idel,  because it considers individual images as deliberate choices that induce particular  effects, rather than as reassertions of the same idea expressed in different ways.  In the interest of keeping this essay confined to an acceptable length, I will only  present one example for each of the two rhetorical techniques. However, these  two symbolic strategies are applicable not only in the specific contexts presented  here, but also in other sections of the Zohar that contain similar symbol usages  (and, for that matter, in other imagecinfused kabbalistic texts as well).27 It is not  my intent to imply that these two methods alone can serve as keys for explicating  the Zohar in its entirety, or that these methods can always be neatly identified  and separated out from the fabric of the lengthy Zoharic text. Rather, I have  selected two relatively clear examples of these methods in an attempt to illumic nate how kabbalistic imagecuse encourages the production of kabbalists. Zohar 1:1a Rabbi Hizqiyah opened: It is written, “As a rose among thorns.”  (Song of Songs 2:2)28 Who is a rose? It is the Assembly of Israel. Just as  the rose that is among thorns has in it red and white, so the Assembly of  Israel has in it Judgment and Compassion. Just as the rose has in it  thirteen leaves, so the Assembly of Israel has in it thirteen attributes of  Compassion that surround it on every side.29 So, from the time that  Elohim30 is mentioned here, it brought forth thirteen words to surround  the Assembly of Israel,31 and to guard her, and afterwards it is  mentioned another time. Why is it mentioned another time? In order to  bring forth five strong leaves that surround the rose. And these five are  Fall 2008 </page> <page sequence="10"> 344  y    ELLEN HASKELL called Salvations, and they are five gates.32 And of this mystery, it is  written, “I will raise the cup of salvations.” (Ps. 116:13) This is the cup  of blessing. The cup of blessing must be on five fingers, and no more,33  in the manner of the rose that sits on five strong leaves, an illustration of  five fingers. And this rose is the cup of blessing.34 This famous passage begins Sefer hazohar, and in it the Zohar’s complex  symbol use comes dramatically into play through the image series. The progresc sion of images in this text includes a rose, a cup of salvation, and a cup of blessing,  all associated with the tenth sefirah. Rather than creating a redundant message  about the role of this divine gradation, these images operate simultaneously at  theological, exegetical, and contemplative levels. The three levels offer a dramatic  presentation of kabbalistic theology, invest this theology with exegetical authority,  and provide a model for transformative contemplation. Combined, the levels work  together to open the unique combination of traditional wisdom and theological  innovation characteristic of this renowned Jewish mystical text. I will address the  theological and exegetical aspects of the passage before moving to the image  series and its transformative impact. At the theological level, the passage introduces several critical components of  kabbalistic thought that center around the tenth sefirah, here referred to as the  Assembly of Israel. This sefirah occupies a unique point within the sefirotic strucc ture that is closest to humanity, and is traditionally understood as the gateway to  the sefirotic realm. By beginning here, the text presents the first step on a  profound spiritual journey and offers insight into the mediating point between  divinity and humanity, both of which are engaged within the passage. The text  describes this liminal sefirah using color imagery associated with a rose to illusc trate the key kabbalistic idea of a dynamic balance between Judgment and  Compassion within God, as well as the role of the tenth sefirah in mediating and  transmitting these divine attributes. In addition, the text locates the tenth sefirah  within the greater context of the sefirotic structure, describing both the Assembly  of Israel’s close relation to the other sefirot (using the image of “five strong leaves”  that represent Ÿesed, Din, Raÿamim, and Yesod counted together, Netsaÿ, and Hod)  and to the Sitra’ Aÿra’ (The Other Side), the forces of evil with which the kabbalist  PROOFTEXTS 28: 3 </page> <page sequence="11"> Metaphor, Transformation, and Transcendence    y  345 must contend (represented by the thorns). Furthermore, the Assembly of Israel is  shown granting access to salvation through its mediating position between  divinity and humanity. All of this information, which comprises an introduction  to the basics of kabbalistic theology, is conveyed through the image of the rose by  drawing out that image’s characteristics and connotations in detail. At the exegetical level, the passage incorporates three scriptural elements: a  quotation from the Song of Songs, a citation from Psalms, and a series of allusions  to Genesis 1 that do not rely on quotation. The Song of Songs, used extensively in  early kabbalistic texts, provides an image that is at once sacred and sensual.35 In  addition, the Song of Songs is traditionally considered one of the most sacred of  texts within the Tanakh. In Mishnah Yadayim 3:5, Rabbi ’Aqiva’ makes the famous  assertion, “All of the Writings are holy, but the Song of Songs is the Holy of  Holies.” Opening the Zohar with a reference to this most sacred of biblical writings  alerts the reader to prepare for the reception of holy secrets. In a similar manner,  approaching the topic of creation at the Zohar’s beginning signifies that the reader  should be prepared for serious and respectful study. Understanding the process of  creation is a central preoccupation of medieval Jewish thought in the context both  of mystical and philosophical literature. In combining the Song of Songs with  speculation on God’s creative process, the Zohar indicates that the reader must be  prepared to encounter an especially high level of sacrality.  The text integrates the floral structure of the rose from Song of Songs 2:2  with the textual structure of Genesis 1, and associates the rose (and the sefirah it  represents) with the emergence of the world itself. The thirteen leaves of the rose  are linked to the thirteen words that separate the first two occurrences of the  divine name Elohim in Genesis 1:1–2, while the five leaves that cup the rose  blossom are associated with five words that separate the second and third occurc rences of this divine name in Genesis 1:2–3. In addition, these numbers are linked  to the traditional formulation of God’s thirteen attributes of Mercy from Exodus  34:6–7, and to the sefirotic structure, which forms a series of five salvific gateways  to God in the form of the lower sefirot (counted in the manner described above).36  The cup of salvation image from Psalm 116 provides a transition point and reinc forces the mystical endeavor’s salvific nature. All of these exegetical contexts are  brought to bear upon the image of the rose, texturing it with a series of sacred  Fall 2008 </page> <page sequence="12"> 346  y    ELLEN HASKELL connotations and investing it with exegetical authority in the grand tradition of  Jewish theological innovation.  As a contemplative model for shaping religious experience, the opening  passage of Sefer hazohar draws on all of these theological and exegetical implicac tions, integrating them into the image series of the divine Assembly of Israel (or  tenth sefirah), the rose, the psalmist’s cup, and the kabbalist’s cup of blessings for  the ritual grace after meals. These images lead the reader on a contemplative  journey that expands his perceptual horizons and enables him to cleave to divinity,  while also drawing on experiential knowledge that brings the presence of God  into his home and (more directly) into his own hand. Through this image series,  the universal is transformed into the personal, and vice versa, allowing the reader  to arrive at a new and intimate understanding of his relationship with God. Zohar  1:1a accomplishes this shift in perception by guiding the reader on a stepcbycstep  journey of images that both echo and explicate the tenth sefirah ’s liminal role in  connecting divinity and humanity. The passage begins with a metaphor: the “rose among thorns” of Song of  Songs 2:2 “is the Assembly of Israel.” This metaphor uses the rose’s image as a  model for its reader to understand and experience an aspect of God. As George  Lakoff and Mark Johnson note, “The essence of metaphor is understanding and  experiencing one kind of thing in terms of another.”37 In addition to the rose’s  theological and exegetical associations, it has yet another quality: unlike an  abstraction of God, it is a familiar object that the reader might encounter in a  garden. Its color, structure and fragrance are accessible to the reader’s underc standing. The rose metaphor allows its reader to solidify his understanding of the  tenth sefirah and its role within kabbalistic theology through direct and concrete  experience, while maintaining the distinction between the image itself and the  profound mystery of divinity.  One of metaphor’s greatest cognitive capabilities is its power to help conceptuc alize abstractions, and this function is critical enough to be incorporated into defic nitions of the term. For example, anthropologist James Fernandez defines a  metaphoric image as “a strategic predication upon an inchoate pronoun . . . which  makes a movement and leads to performance.”38 Divinity is one of the most abstract  and inchoate entities in the human conceptual field, and unless a religious thinker  PROOFTEXTS 28: 3 </page> <page sequence="13"> Metaphor, Transformation, and Transcendence    y  347 chooses to embrace negative theology, one of the best alternatives is metaphor, since  it provides a means of paradoxically describing the indescribable. In Fernandez’s  definition, awareness and contemplation of deliberately presented images combine  in a call to action that implies a transformative personal experience. Fernandez’s work is particularly relevant for kabbalistic studies because he is  deeply interested in metaphor’s potential for resituating humanity in relation to  divinity, a cosmological development that fundamentally alters the experience of  the world for religious participants. As he explains, a theology comprised of several  metaphors interacting in dynamic ways gives its adherents a sensation of cosmoc logical coherence and effects a “return to the whole,” a restoration of humanity’s  relative place within the ordering of the universe.39 This view is similar to that of  Michael Fishbane, who writes, “The language of myth thus gives shape to spiric tual consciousness and provides the armature and forms of imagination through  which one may conceptualize ‘the Whole’ and bear it in mind at all times. Myth  may therefore comprise and condition a mystical mentality—not by being tranc scended so much as by being fully subjectivized and lived.”40 In the work of these  scholars, myth and metaphor function as constructive conceptual tools that use  creative imagery to structure thought and establish experiential associations. Zohar 1:1a employs the rose image to allow an aspect of God to be experic enced directly by the reader, while simultaneously infusing lived reality with a  reminder of divinity. As the metaphoric image of the rose becomes a means of  understanding an aspect of God, the rose in turn becomes a means by which to  contemplate God in the visible world. The person’s encounter with the actual  blossom is transformed into a vehicle for divine contemplation, and the experic ences of God and world are integrated into a coherent Whole: a reality transc formed by the lived and experienced presence of divinity.  The latter part of this passage brings the tenth sefirah still further into the  realm of human experience, expanding to allow a contemplative awareness of the  relationship between humanity and divinity. The rose, in all its complexity as a  religious image, is capable of resting in a man’s open hand, and the passage draws  on this aspect of the image to truly bridge the gap between God and man,  emphasizing the kabbalistic theology of divine and human interaction. Bringing  in a textual citation from Psalm 116, the next image in the passage’s series is the  Fall 2008 </page> <page sequence="14"> 348  y    ELLEN HASKELL “cup of salvations” that lies in the hand of the Psalmist. This image, derived from  a specific textual reference, remains general and somewhat abstract, while  performing the shift from the rose to the cup. The final image of the series, the  cup used for the blessing in the grace after meals, personalizes the entire passage.  The Zohar depicts the cup resting, as prescribed in Babylonian Talmud  Berakhot 51a, upon the five fingers of the right hand, mirroring the image of the  rose on its base of five leaves. Through the image of the rose, the full mystery of  divinity is brought to bear upon a simple and routine performance of blessing.  The textual image series has progressed from divinity to humanity, and may be  followed in reverse as a contemplative model, illustrating the connection between  God and man. The cup of blessing becomes the Psalmist’s cup of salvation, which  in turn becomes the rose, an image that ultimately represents the tenth sefirah.  Understanding this progression and the interrelation of the Assembly of Israel,  the rose and the cup transforms the grace after meals into a means of acknowlc edging and interacting with the divine presence. The mystic’s own hand, during  the blessing, forms the beginning of a pathway to God.  All of the images used in this passage refer to the tenth sefirah. And yet, the  textual choice of these distinct images and their placement in this pattern transc form them into a model that concretely demonstrates how this sefirah functions as  a gateway to the divine realm. Furthermore, the act of blessing that stimulates  this progression begins after the most basic of human actions: eating. As a  theology, Kabbalah generally rejects antinomian strategies, working instead to  infuse the daily rituals of Judaism, and the processes of life itself, with added  significance and holiness. Zohar 1:1a provides an extremely compelling example  of this strategy, transforming the reader’s consciousness of an action that is part  of his daily life, and thus changing his relationship to God, self, and world. By  understanding these shifting images and their interrelationships in a complex  way, he places himself in profound contact with God, holding access to the infic nite within his cupped hand.  The sense of interrelation and connection between the kabbalist and God is  beautifully expressed in this image series, making a movement in the reader’s  mind that leads to an enhanced awareness of the holiness present in daily reality.  This transformative quality of the image series conforms to James Fernandez’s  PROOFTEXTS 28: 3 </page> <page sequence="15"> Metaphor, Transformation, and Transcendence    y  349 observation that the universal wholeness and coherence desired by religious movec ments is achieved through elaborate “symbolic symphonies.”41 The images used in  Zohar 1:1a enable their reader to intimately pattern the unknown in ways to  which he has immediate and accessible understanding, simultaneously inscribing  the metaphorical meaning back onto his own body, which is sociocreligiously  transfigured by the experience. The anthropologist Roy Rappaport nicely sums  up this process when he writes, “The actors themselves become terms in their own  logic of the concrete.”42 Although Zohar 1:1a serves as a complex guide to kabbalistic selfctransformac tion, it does not fully illustrate this work’s remarkable use of imagery and its  contemplative potential. Zohar 1:1a presents a series of images that remain distinct,  even as they blend smoothly from one into another. The smooth transition between  distinctive, yet interrelated, images creates the contemplative model. However, the  Zohar contains another complex form of imagery that combines strongly disparate  images without placing them in a series, using theological “mixed metaphors” to  create a satisfying and unified contemplative experience of the divine.  Zohar 3:65a–b He [Rabbi Shim’on] said to him: El’azar, my son, behold: the  companions have established it. And now all is bound in one matter, and  the secret of the matter is this: Ehyeh.43 This is the sum of all. For when  the paths are concealed, and are not separated and are included in one  place, then it is called Ehyeh: the sum. All is concealed and not revealed.  After the beginning went forth from it, and that river became pregnant  to produce all, then it was called Asher Ehyeh. That is to say, “Therefore  I will be.” I will be prepared to produce and to beget all. Ehyeh: That is  to say, “Now I include all, the generality of every particular.” Asher  Ehyeh: The mother that became pregnant and prepared to bring forth all  of the particulars, and to reveal the upper name44 . . . Come and see: Yud  in the beginning is the sum of all, concealed from all sides. The paths  are not open: the sum of male and female. The stroke of the Yud that is  above hints toward Nothing.45 Afterwards, Yud: that brought forth that  river that flows and goes forth from it and became pregnant by it: He’.

And therefore it is written, “My love.” (Song of Songs  1:9, etc.) And if you will say “river” is written, meaning one, but behold,  here are three49 —this is actually so. Yud brought forth three, and in the  three, all is included. Yud brought forth before itself that river, and two  children whom the Mother suckles, and she became pregnant with  them, and brought them forth.50 Afterwards: He’, in this manner: He’  and those children below the Father and the Mother. This passage is part of a lengthy discussion between the Zohar’s Rabbi  El’azar and his father Rabbi Shim’on bar Yoÿ’ai, concerning the various divine  names and their attributes. At this point in the discussion, R. El’azar has asked a  question about an interpretation of Exodus 3:14 he has difficulty understanding.  This famous biblical verse is often rendered, “I am what I am.” Here, however, R.  Shim’on reads it more literally as: “I will be what I will be.” The phrase is, of  course, God’s response when Moses asks His name at the burning bush. The  discussion directly prior to this passage describes unity among the sefirotic strucc ture in terms of the third sefirah (often called Binah), here understood as a river  that is also a mother who is included in everything and the summation of all.51  The imagery occurs during R. Shim’on’s explanation of Exodus 3:14, which  becomes an explanation of sefirotic emanation, interdependence, and unity. Binah  is often described as the womb in which the rest of the sefirot are formed. The  letter yud, the first letter of the Tetragrammaton, points to the first sefirah, Keter,  and beyond it to God’s unknowable aspect of Ein Sof.52 As a masculine gradation,  it impregnates Binah, the Upper Mother, represented by the first he’ of the Tetrac grammaton. The six masculine sefirot from Ÿesed to Yesod are associated with the  letter vav, while the Shekhinah, the Lower Mother, is associated with the Tetrac grammaton’s final he’. These last two letters, or sefirotic configurations, are the  children who suckle from Binah. The kabbalistic concept of the divine overflow’s continuous transmission  through the sefirotic system is conveyed by an interpretation of Genesis 2:10,  which uses the present tense: “goes forth.” The Zohar understands this to indicate  PROOFTEXTS 28: 3 </page> <page sequence="17"> Metaphor, Transformation, and Transcendence    y  351 ongoing action. The ongoing process of divine overflow and the continuous interc dependence of the sefirotic system is further indicated by the rather confused  chronological imagery at the end of the passage, in which the two children suckle  from the Mother before her impregnation by the supernal yud is recapitulated. It is this group of divine lifecprocesses that Rabbi Shim’on explains to his son,  correlating sefirotic emanation with the revelation of the divine name. Rabbi  Shim’on speaks of potentiality and the starting point of existence by interpreting  the future tense of the verb “to be” (Ehyeh) in the divine name as the source of  divine becoming. At the beginning of emanation, the paths that represent the  sefirotic potencies are concealed. It is only when Binah becomes pregnant that the  sefirot and the divine name are revealed. In this way, Binah represents a point of  mediation between concealment and revealment, birthing revelation into the world.  This is a complex passage, using a variety of metaphoric images to depict  critical theological points of divine unity and interdependence. Understanding  these concepts is central to the interpretation of this Zoharic passage, and the  theology of Zohar 3:65a–b is far more complex than that presented in Zohar 1:1a.  However, in the course of presenting this theology of divine revelation, the text  uses a number of unusual images to describe the third sefirah. These images fall  into two distinct groups: one containing anthropomorphic familial imagery, and  the other containing natural aquatic imagery. For example, the third sefirah is  described both as the “river that became pregnant” and “the mother that became  pregnant.” These mixed images, seemingly commingled past the point of  meaning, provide a contemplative opportunity for the kabbalistic reader similar  to the one produced in the image series of the previous example. Using a Zoharic passage for contemplative purposes is possible because  literary images encourage speculation based on networks of connotations underc stood to structure the image. Each literary figure encountered forms a complex  statement that exists not in a conceptual void, but rather in a structure composed  by an underlying network of connotations that give the image a fullness and  complexity beyond its face value. Many of these underlying connotations are not  explicitly stated; rather, they are implicit in the multilayered texture of the image  itself. This process provides the thick perceptual reality of religious imagery. For  example, much of this passage invokes familial imagery. The seven lower sefirot  Fall 2008 </page> <page sequence="18"> 352  y    ELLEN HASKELL are represented as the children of Binah, suckling a continuous transmission of  divine energy from their heavenly mother. This imagery reinforces the kabbalistic  principle that although the sefirot may seem separate, they do in fact exist in a  relationship of profound, unitive intimacy. The passage foregrounds the connotac tions surrounding a child’s relationship to its mother, which is both separate and  unified, because the child derives from the same substance as its mother and even  when separate remains joined to her interior essence through the act of suckling  milk. Zohar 3:65a–b alludes to this group of connotations by stating that the two  children suckle from their supernal Mother.  Another important connotation of familial imagery is its affective resonance.  The loving relationship between the supernal Mother and the supernal yud,  written in the Song of Song’s language of desire, implies that the relationships  among the sefirot are structured by a similar love and desire; the supernal river  that is also the Mother desires to remain with her beloved. Zohar 3:65a–b illusc trates this point by applying the role of the female beloved from the Song of  Songs to Binah, rather than to Shekhinah, as in the previous passage. Furthermore,  the relationship between a mother and her children is understood to be one of  love, nurture, and dependence. In this passage the parent–child relationship is  employed as a metaphor both for the relationship between Binah and the lower  sefirot and for the relationship of the final three letters of the Tetragrammaton to  each other. By freely using images of motherhood, desire, pregnancy, childbirth,  and suckling, the text gives affective texture, as well as cognitive structure, to the  kabbalist’s understanding of God.  There is, however, another aspect of this passage that merits discussion: the  convergence of human pregnancy and motherhood imagery with imagery derived  from the nonhuman natural world. This fusion of seemingly unrelated imagery  and its effect on the kabbalist’s perception of divinity moves this passage far  beyond a simple or codified explanation of sefirotic dynamics. It is not simply a  singular image we have here, of an anthropomorphic mother bearing children,  but also that of a river becoming pregnant and bearing children. Natural images,  like that of the river, bear connotations of powerful forces that are beyond human  understanding or ability to control. Although a river can give life, as in this  textual example, rivers can also flood their banks and become destructive forces.  PROOFTEXTS 28: 3 </page> <page sequence="19"> Metaphor, Transformation, and Transcendence    y  353 These functions of the river are not much affected by humanity’s actions and  intentions. Natural images may evoke awe, but they do not bear connotations of  emotional response. This imagery is beautiful, but impersonal, indicating the vast  and awecinspiring power of divinity. More specifically, in this context the river’s  emanation recalls the primordial Edenic river of Genesis 2. On the other hand,  by combining this natural imagery with culturally based mother imagery, anthroc pomorphic implications are drawn into play. The passage shifts freely between  the two types of images, applying the language of pregnancy to river and mother  alike. The term “suckles” (yanka’), used in the passage to describe the relation of  the mother to the children, the river to its tributaries, or Binah to the lower sefirot,  can be applied either to young plants drawing water from the earth or to the  action of a human child taking milk from its mother. Such ambiguity further  highlights the passage’s mingled imagery of nature and nurture. This juxtaposition of natural and cultural images is representative of the  Zohar’s symbolic complexity, and should not be understood a random poetic  choice or as a repetitive coded message about divine overflow in which every term  describing Binah is mutually equivalent. Instead, I would argue that in this  passage tension between the natural imagery and the cultural, anthropomorphic  imagery creates a complex whole. This kabbalistic “mixed metaphor” produces a  far more deeply textured concept of divinity than either image could establish  alone. Furthermore, the fact that this mixture of images occurs in a passage  concerned with revealing the Tetragrammaton implies that the idea of nature’s  unconquerable power combined with the culturally nurturing role of a parent is  central to the revelation of God. Commingling nature and nurture demonstrates  that God represents both of these together, manifesting as a force beyond human  comprehension and as a culturally structured being with whom humanity can  interact. Read in this way, the passage offers a comment on divine universality  and the mystery of this universality’s relation to humanity.  This reading is suggested and reinforced by the work of several scholars. Sarah  Kofman explains that when a single metaphor is isolated, it can become conceptuc ally privileged, whereas using multiple metaphors for a single subject allows the  images to operate as correctives for one another, refining the concept being  expressed.53 According to her perspective, mixing images can extend the conceptual  Fall 2008 </page> <page sequence="20"> 354  y    ELLEN HASKELL range of a described entity over broad areas of experience and significance. In a  similar vein, anthropologist Victor Turner notes that exaggerated figures, or ones  juxtaposed in strange ways (in other words, images that are in and of themselves  mixed metaphors) stimulate contemplation of these unique configurations’ compoc nents.54 James Fernandez writes that elaborately mixed image compositions are  “polyvectoral—they move in several directions and often in such a counterposing  manner as to result not in movement but in contemplation.”55 As demonstrated by  this passage, some of the most vivid kabbalistic writings combine anthropomorc phism with natural images, dramatically joining them in order to avoid a simplistic  vision of God.56  In this way, the Zohar encourages its reader to contemplate the fullness and  power of divinity, which exists simultaneously beyond the scope of human comprec hension and in a close, nurturing relationship with the people of Israel, those who  know the divine name. Juxtaposing divine concepts within such a passage gives rise  to a theological system in which the kabbalistic reader is encouraged to organize his  own interiority to complement the idea put forth in the text—namely that he stands  in a relationship with an overwhelming power that is both awecinspiring and  capable of profound gestures of nurture. This complex process is encouraged in a  holistic way through the relational quality of symbols and metaphors, whose  primary function is to carry meaning between seemingly separate areas of experic ence. As meaning is carried along the lines of an image’s connotations, the mindful  reader becomes integrated into this vast system of relationships, and this process is  further encouraged by Kabbalah’s presentation both of anthropomorphic imagery  and of other images drawn from the reader’s daily experience.   It is possible to imagine this process as beginning in an engagement with quesc tions raised by the text and ending with personal transformation arising from the  attempt to answer them. For example, Zohar 3:65a–b raises a question about what it  means to relate to God as a mother who suckles children and implies a parent–child  relationship not only among the sefirot, but also with the human kabbalist who in  turn receives the divine overflow that enlivens creation. The passage also raises a  question about how a divine “mother” is modified by also being a lifecgiving “river,”  implying an elemental power that elevates divinity beyond feminine sociocultural  roles. This aspect of the imagery prevents the Zohar’s anthropomorphism from  PROOFTEXTS 28: 3 </page> <page sequence="21"> Metaphor, Transformation, and Transcendence    y  355 leading toward thoughts of divine limitation. To summarize in a manner that is (I  hope) not too reductive: the passage can be read as encouraging the kabbalist to  perceive himself as connected with a divine “family,” while ensuring that this  awareness does not elevate his selfcregard beyond what is appropriate for a human  being, who is admittedly a rather junior member of the family. The familial metac phor emphasizes the kabbalistic doctrine of imitatio dei by engaging in a direct  carryingcover of human traits between God and the kabbalist, highlighting the  kabbalist’s participation in the sefirotic system’s divine dynamics because of his  similarity to the divine structure. The natural imagery nuances this understanding  by creating a clear distinction between divine power and human limitation.  Furthermore, each individual kabbalist will further nuance his reading by bringing  in his own associations with these images and their connotations, providing for a  personal element in the theology. Understood in this way, Zohar 3:65a–b presents a  kabbalistic cosmology in which the mindful reader is situated in a particular relac tionship with God and is encouraged to contemplate his role in this relationship. Kabbalistic texts, by attributing anthropomorphic imagery to divinity (for  which they are somewhat notorious) and mixing it with images of light, water,  vegetation, and so forth, guide their readers to contemplate the nature of each of  these things, and their interrelations. In this way, the Zohar’s intricate web of  images and words transforms its reader’s consciousness and his perception of all  the possible forms of relationship between himself and God. When the kabbalc istic reader confronts a passage of text that uses vivid images in unusual juxtapoc sitions, he is drawn to think about each component of the image, and all of its  connotations. He is encouraged to speculate on the ways in which the disjunctive  images blend together to form a coherent, complex idea, as well as the ways in  which the images play upon each other. Finally, he is encouraged to contemplate  his own relationship to the qualities conveyed in these images. The kabbalistic reader must come to understand how God comprises the qualic ties and connotations of each image, and by comprising each one, exceeds the limic tations of all. In addition, he must find a way to situate himself in relation to the  understanding of God developed by these images, particularly if he is concerned  with the kabbalistic pursuit of imitatio dei. By contemplating his own relationship to  the divine complexity, the reader himself is transformed. As Roy Rappaport writes,  Fall 2008 </page> <page sequence="22"> 356  y    ELLEN HASKELL “Every term that participates in a metaphor is transformed into more than itself.”57  For this reason, kabbalistic “mixed metaphors” can be understood to represent a  contemplative approach to divine universality, correcting simple, limited metaphors  by supplementing them with disjunctive imagery that stimulates understanding of  the complex and ultimately unknowable nature of God. C o N C L u d I N g  T H o u g H T S Through the image series and the kabbalistic “mixed metaphor,” Jewish mystical  texts provide their readers with complex models for understanding God, the  world, and themselves. This understanding of kabbalistic imagery’s methods of  evoking and defining religious experience parallels Mary Carruthers’s suggestion  that medieval Christian monastics used images as models for thinking.58 In  writing of imagecbased monastic meditative practices, she notes, “A cognitive  image is designedly functional (though its author may have some epistemological  aspirations for it as well). . . . The image is used by its fashioner and, if it finds  artistic form, by its audience as a cognitive tool.”59 It would be uncharitable to  assume any less complexity of medieval Jewish theologians and their imagery. The theosophical kabbalists did not leave personal accounts of mystical experic ence, particularly during the late thirteenth century when their theology was underc going its first largecscale codification in the Zohar. Therefore, we must rely upon  their theological texts to acquire information about them. Given the complexity of  the texts’ images, these men sought to create innovative and compelling models of  relationship between themselves and divinity, rather than simply writing a code  from which to derive esoteric exegesis or endlessly reiterating a pattern of sefirotic  and human interaction. Kabbalistic literature, such as the Zohar, reveals theoloc gians working to develop comprehensible images with which human beings are  capable of standing in profound relationships. Through literary integration of the  human domain of selfcunderstanding and the divine domain of infinite potential,  the kabbalists reccreate themselves through the medium of their own discourse.

In this view, metaphor structurally develops a relation of  semantic identity between elements of semantic categories not recognized in other  contexts as belonging to the same domain. This interaction of different domains  involves a shift in recognition that can be either “in the structural vantage point or  epistemological perspective of the subject.” Turner’s ideas build on the work of  Fernandez, whom he identifies as having a very “interactionist” perspective.

Much, though certainly not all, of the Zohar can be analyzed in this  way. Of course, the image series and the kabbalistic “mixed metaphor” are often  intermingled in the Zohar. I have tried to select two fairly clear examples for this  essay, as a starting point for further analysis. 28 Although the more correct literal translation of the shoshanah from Song of Songs is  “lily,” the image built by the Zoharic passage more closely describes a rose.

Roses sit on five strong leaves that cup their petals much as a hand cups  a wine glass, while lilies do not. 29 See Exodus 34:6–7 for the thirteen divine attributes of Mercy. 30 This divine name represents the third sefirah, Binah, in this passage. 31 There are thirteen words between the first and second mention of the divine name  Elohim in Gen. 1:1–2. 32 There are five words between the second and third mention of Elohim in Gen. 1:2–3,  representing the five sefirot Ÿesed, Din, Raÿamim, and Yesod counted together,  Netsaÿ, and Hod.

The Zohar understands each unit as a divine name representing a stage in  the revelation of concealed divinity through the sefirot. Here, Ehyeh seems to refer  to Keter, the first, highest and most concealed of the sefirot. 44 At this point, the explanation of divine names and their relationships with the sefirot  continues at length. 45 The Nothing (Ayin) being hinted at is an allusion to Ein Sof (Without End), a  kabbalistic way of referring to divinity as infinite, indescribable, and unknowable. 46 Genesis 2:10 continues with a description of the division of this primordial river into  four channels, in a manner similar to the sefirotic dynamics presented in this  Zohar passage. 47 The word is in the present tense. 48 The word is in the past tense.

In this passage, the sefirotic  structure’s unfolding represents the revelation of the fourcletter name of God. 50 Although it would be most technically correct to translate the phrase “two children  whom the Mother suckles” as “two children to whom the Mother gives suck,” this  phrase sounds awkward to me, and I believe that the meaning is clear enough  from context. I also chose to avoid the term “nurse” here, because I feel that its  connotations soften the physicality of the suckling act. 51 This discussion is located in Zohar 3:65a. 52 A parallel to this text, which can help to clarify the ambiguous role of the letter yud  in this passage, can be found in the kabbalistic text Sha’arei orah (Gates of Light)  by Joseph ben Abraham Gikatilla. In this work’s chapter on the sixth sefirah,  Gikatilla explains that yud alludes to the second sefirah, Ÿokhmah, while only the  crown (the upstroke) of yud alludes to the first sefirah, Keter, and beyond it to the  secret of Ein Sof. As in our Zoharic passage, Binah is represented by the letter he’  and is the source from which all the sefirot draw supernal life. However, Gikatilc la’s passage lacks the feminine imagery of mothering and pregnancy found in the  Zoharic text. See Joseph ben Abraham Gikatilla, Sha’arei orah (Jerusalem: Mosad  Bialik, 1980), 1:188.
