<plain_text><page sequence="1">IX.-NEW BOOKS The Theological Frontier of Ethics. By W. G. MNIACLAGAN. Allen &amp; Unwin, 1961. Pp. 199. 28s. IN an endeavour to clarify the relations between ethics and theology, Professor Maclagan explores the frontier strains and overlaps which occur between them at certain points. This being his aim, he rightly excuses himself from any direct concern with the positions in ethics and theology whose relations he is examining. Suffice it to say that the ethical position is very reminiscent of, though not identical with, that of Kant, and it is one which Maclagan himself happens to hold. The theological positions have (he would say) " wide currency " amongf Christians and with some, but by no means all, Maclagan has strong sympathies. But this degree of personal involvement makes for no special pleading. On the contrary, the book (and especially in its early chapters) is a most painstaking essay in critical clarification. In fact in parts it is so meticulous and intricate that the reader may well be tempted to skip a few pages, in which case (as I shall try to show) he will certainly miss some of the subtleties and novelties of the argument whose broader positive implications I wish the author himself had developed further. Maclagan considers that at least at three points, theologians have appro- priated the moralists' territory and the three frontier incidents he is con- cerned to sort out are to be found in (i) the doctrine of sola gratia; (ii) the religious tendency to talk of duty in terms of God's will; (iii) the claim of some Christians that grace (sought in prayer) is needed to enable a man to do his duty, and that " mere dutifulness " is inadequate as an ideal. That views (ii) and (iii) have wide currency among Christians there can be no doubt; for my own part I am glad to say that (i) is more popular north of the Tweed than south of it. (i) Maclagan has no difficulty in showingf the insuperable problems which -arise (a) when theologians talk over-easily of " natural man " being " alto- gether corrupt"; for who is this 'natural man' and on what evidence is the assertion based?; and (b) when havingf virtually assimilated " sin " and "moral wrong-doing ", corruption and moral corruption, they talk also of a " solidarity in sin ", where sin is now a universal inherited condition, and then, to preserve responsibility for sin in this second sense they divorce responsibility from choice, while urging that responsibility implies choice from sin in the first sense. In all this Maclagan takes Professor N. H. G. Robinson's views as representative not least because, while critical of theologians like Barth, Brunner and Niebuhr, Robinson still " shows traces of the defects he censures ". Here is a logical tangle indeed, and Maclagan's admission that while we may never disjoin the concepts of choice and re- sponsibility, we may nevertheless have " non-episodic " notions of both choice and responsibility, might seem to some only to pour oil on already burning waters, though on a more sympathetic view it might be claimed that here is a point where Maclagan, in contrast to the defenders of the sola gratia doctrine, begins to discern that to grapple effectively with the puzzles, nothing less than a bold metaphysical venture will be needed. In short, we begin to suspect that the difficulty is not so much with sin as such, as with the general difficulty of elucidating metaphysical words and relating them (in this particular case) to moral discourse. Maclagan is right to dislike and to condemn the morally offensive ways in which the doctrine 294</page><page sequence="2">NEW BOOKS 295 of sola gratia is often explicated, and he certainly shows the slipshod char- acter of much that has passed for orthodox, impressive and influential theology. As far as it goes, his concluding summary affirmation of his " own attitude as a moralist towards assertions of man's natural sinfulness " (p. 48) is a most persuasive alternative to show how far the language of morals may reliably illuminate theological talking. But might it not be possible that there is some sort of point in the traditional discussions which is not wholly given in any moral language, however carefully that lan- guage is used? This is a possibility which would certainly conflict with Maclagan's views about the autonomy of ethics and the inevitably binding character of duty-a reflection which brings us conveniently to our next section. (ii) When he comes to examine talk about duty in terms of God's will, Maclagan's moves are very different. Duty, he would say, is intrinsically binding. But if whatever is morally binding is only made so by God's commanding it, there is a collision between the contingency of this existen- tial fact about a will and the intrinsic necessity (as he would put it) of some specific obligation. Clearly Maclagan wants no sort of " subordination " of duty. Duty cannot be derived from somebody's will (not even God's will) as its source. If any religious man counters that this is making God too much like an ordinary person, or (more intricately) that God's existence is necessary, so that there is no conflict here between necessity and con- tingency, Maclagan would say, with some plausibility, that the command theory is then emptied of all significance. Unless we speak of God as a Lord Chief Justice, a Lord Raglan, or a Viscount Montgomery, the theory cannot even be formulated. But if we do so speak of God, duty ceases to have the intrinsic necessity it must possess. So Maclagan's overall comment is (pp. 68-69) " if we are not to use anthropomorphic concepts the theory cannot be stated, and if we are to use them it cannot be defended ;- and one or other we must do. There seems no escape from this dilemma." The only possibility is to make the word " God " a synonym for " Moral Demand ", a move with no other merit (if that) save typographical economy. It might be thought that Maclagan had now put the shutters up on the theological shop. But when he comes to discuss the moral response, it begins to look as if the moralists' take-over bid has not entirely succeeded, and that something like a Co-operative Society with a restricted sales policy has emerged. The book indeed takes a rather surprising turn when it moves from theological talk about the moral demand to theological talk about the moral response. (iii) True, Maclagan will have nothing of " constitutive grace ", as being an infringement of a man's freedom and personality. But he is prepared to allow grace as " environmental succour ", when, for example, it is talked of on the model of the aid given to a child entering for an essay or a painting competition, which is still " all his own work " (p. 114). Further, experience of prayer (Maclagan would say) can justify some sort of per- sonal talk about God: " If there is to be any empirical warrant for the thought of God as personal and graciously operative it must be found ultimately in the experience of prayer, and it is reasonable to believe that there in fact it is found " (p. 156). Likewise, when he considers the cul- mination of duty in a religious ideal, he does not deny this possibility and can even quote a bishop (K. E. Kirk) with approval. His main concern (and rightly) is that we should never let religious enthusiasm forget the essential moral features of the ideal (pp. 167-169). Obviously the languages</page><page sequence="3">296 NEW BOOKS of theology and ethics are here much more mutually accommodating. But we may still ask whether Maclagan, in his concept of environ- mental succour, has given us all that can reputably be meant by phrases like 'I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me ". Again, in criticising C. H. Dodd's expression of the old point that the Christian rightly thanks God for his successes but will not blame God for his failures, preferring " conscience " to c" logic ", Maclagan very properly reminds us of McTaggart's warning that "none ever went about to break logic, but in the end logic broke him ". But does not this sledge-hammer approach overlook the more subtle possibility that Dodd may be confronted by an ostensible conflict between two logics-the logic of prayer and the logic of conscience-and that the task of theology is to elucidate, if it can, a logic odd enough to combine both. Once again we are confronted by the com- plexity of theological utterance. Maclagan's moral parallels are certainly illuminating, but need they, must they, be exact fits? At this point the argument of the book takes yet another surprising turn, and by contrast with the inexorable analysis of the earlier pages pounding relentlessly at its opponents, the criticism now breaks into rather exhilarating broadsides. Maclagan has argued that the moral response affords some justification for talking of God as personal; but if " moral demand" and " God " are synonymous God (says Maclagan) cannot be personal. It now looks as if theology gains frontier peace with ethics at the cost of civil war within its own borders. What can be done about this theological puzzle? How can a theologian reasonably " think of God as both personal and impersonal " (p. 179)? Maclagan's first suggestion is that we should be content with a final inconsistency so that natural theology would consist " merely in two ' bracketing' shots followed by a 'Cease fire'" (p. 180). But (we may ask) what now of McTaggart's awful warning? Another view is that the personal concept might carry " overtones " which point to its own transcendence. In any case, as Maclagan contents himself, ordinary religious discourse fortunately does have both personal and impersonal emphases. It is only an articulate theology which is at fault. The moral is that theologians should be " more reticent, less seeming-informative . . . than in general they are" (p. 181). There, it might be thought, with that lively thrust at theologians from one of the most patient of philosophers, the book (and this review) would end. But we have not finished with surprises, even yet. For throughout the book there can be found traces of another approach altogether to the whole subject, an approach which suggests the possibility of a logical re- mapping of the whole frontier between theology and ethics. Let me develop this point by reference to four passages scattered throughout the book. On page 64 Maclagan says that "moral experience ", once it has been " left to stand on its own and to make sense of itself " "may then reveal itself as more than it is ordinarily acknowledged to be ". Again, on pages 81-82 he acknowledges that "the term ' God' may well mean a great deal more than is meant by ' moral law' and the more may be of the utmost significance to our lives . . .". It is only " in so far as the con- sciousness of moral demand is considered in and by itself [that] ' God ' can mean nothing different from 'moral law'" and that " the theological term renames without elucidating ". So he can say (somewhat surprisingly in view of other statements) that there may be " a legitimate overplus of meaning attaching to the term ' God', additional to what is signified by ' moral demand ' "; an overplus which " will derive from elements or</page><page sequence="4">NEW BOOKS 297 'moments' in experience other than that of confrontation by the moral demand itself . . . ". Whereupon " a theologian might . . . say that illumination in this sense, by lateral enrichment, so to call it, and not by vertical grounding, is all that he ever looked for ". The same distinction recurs a little later when, on page 89, Maclagan, rejecting another quasi- theological crudity which would suppose that values can be providjed by theology with a sort of " solidity " which keeps them from being " flimsy" (whatever all that means), nevertheless allows that " theistic beliefs -other- wise acquired might throw . . light on the concept of an order of values " by " a sort of lateral, not a vertical illumination ". Last of all we may quote page 171. Speaking of the possibility after all of using the concept of personality of God, he says that " we may certainly apply the concept of' person' to God, meaning by it just what we ordinarily mean, as a sort of final, and so to say despairing ' gesture of affirmation ' regarding a being that we do not think it really fits, but in the conviction that to deny what is thus affirmed could be even less appropriate . . ." and he continues (p. 172 and despite the whole of chapter iii) ". . . so far as there is propriety at all in using of God the language of personality it will be natural and even proper to describe the ' moral law ' or ' order of values ' as being or expressing the will of God ". " But " (he continues) " it will be vitally important to remember . . . that this is no more than a manner of speaking; a permissible description indeed (and even as description no more than permissible, rather as one might be permitted to speak of Scott as ' the author of Waverley ' even in talking of his work not as novelist but as sheriff), but still in no sense an explanation of the moral facts. Ex- planation, however, is just what has been pretended ", i.e. Maclagan would say, in traditional theology. In such ways as these, then, and despite what the casual reader might suppose, Maclagan allows the possibility of theological concepts affording a wider interpretation of moral experience though he would make two important qualifications: (a) The links in this wider interpretation are not causal. God must not be supposed to be a source of morality if this means providing a causal explanation of it. Duty is not binding because (in a causal " sense of " because ") it is God's will; (b) no one, neither religious believers nor (say) Professor Nowell Smith, must suppose that God, pictured as a person, is anything more than " a manner of speaking ", what some would call a model. But providing we remember this, we may (despite chapter iii) approximate to the logic of God by using the model of a personal will, so that even duty can be talked of as " a kind of' hearing God addressing and commanding us ' " (p. 56, italics mine). We seem to be arriving at very different possibilities from those contemplated in the main argument of the text. Finaly, against this background it is perhaps possible to make a little more inroad into the theological puzzle with which Maclagan concludes his book. Admittedly the logic of religious discourse is bafflingly tortuous, with the logic of personality illuminating some parts of the discourse, and the logic of impersonal phrases like 'moral demand' illuminating other parts. But let us be sure that we do not make the problem even more baffling by posing it in the material mode, and I am not sure that Maclagan does not do this. I rather think that part of Maclagan's puzzle arises from a presupposition that metaphysical language is descriptive and picture-like, when we would vainly ask: how can God be both a person and not a person? It is rather as if a scientist of an older day asked: " How can something- light-be both a wave and a particle? instead of asking the much more</page><page sequence="5">298 NEW BOOKS tractable question: 'What is the logic of discourse about light when wave mechanics model part of the discourse, and particle mechanics the rest? ' What theologians have to do, if they are to avoid mere double-talk, is some- thing like what Bohm has done (so I am told) in the wave-particle case by giving a harmonious mathematical treatment to what seem to be two dis- parate approaches. What theologians must do is to give such an account of the word " God " as makes it possible to model it in both personal and -impersonal terms, a task which at least in principle is only like discovering (say) that discourse both about straight lines and ellipses can be harmonised within discourse about a cone. In practice, however, it may be baffling enough and what Maclagan undoubtedly shows is that on this frontier with ethics, theology for the most part has not even begun to realise its complex logic. He is right to protest that theology has too often been excessively articulate. But Maclagan's frontier incidents will only end when theology has a better understanding of its metaphysical language, and also a better grip on and criterion for the use of its models, whether crude models which picture God as a Lord Raglan, or closer approximations like Maclagan's use of the language of morals. Perhaps in the end we shall discover that there are after all no frontiers, but only one territory where the problem is the problem of sorting the different languages which endeavour to map it in whole or part. I. T. RAMSEY Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus. The German Text of Ludwig Wittgen- stein's Logische-philosophische Abhandlung with a new translation by D. F. PEARs and B. F. MCGUINNEss and with the Introduction by BERTRAND RUSSELL, F.R.S. Routledge and Kegan Paul Ltd., 1961. Pp. xxii + 166. 21s. IT is still, even after the publication of other writings of Wittgenstein and much elucidatory comment by other writers, very hard to understand the Tractatus. For Ogden, with the help of Ramsey, to undertake a transla- tion of it published in 1922 was a courageous act for which all philosophers who are unable to read the original with confidence can properly be grate- ful. It would have been miraculous if they had avoided all mistranslation and if their translation had not been (as they acknowledged) over-literal to a degree that leaves their syntax teutonic rather than English. Though they received, to an extent about which the authorities disagree, the help of Wittgenstein himself in revising their translation, it would be absurd to regard the Wittgenstein of the early twenties as an authority on the niceties of English expression; his English never became wholly idiomatic and then he had been absent from England for the whole period of the war. It would therefore be a black mark for present-day philosophical scholar- ship if a better translation could not be produced now; Pears and McGuin- ness can claim our gratitude not for doing merely this but for doing it with such a near approach to perfection. The present reviewer can find little or nothing of consequence wrong with their work, though like every- one else he would have preferred something slightly different from time to time. A few of the many improvements they have made can be indicated by quoting first the German, then the Ogden translation, then the new translation, of a few passages:</page><page sequence="6">NEW BOOKS 299 2.0121 Es erscheine gleichsam als Zufall, Wenn dem Ding, das allein fuer sich bestehen koennte, nachtraeglich eine Sachlage passen wuerde. It would, so to speak, appear as an accident, when to a thing that could exist alone on its own account, subsequently a state of affairs could be made to fit. It would seem to be a sort of accident, if it turned out that a situation would fit a thing that could already exist entirely on its own. 3.141 Der Satz ist kein Woertergemisch.-(wie das musikalische Thema kein Gemisch von Toenen.) Der Satz ist artikuliert. The proposition is not a mixture of words (just as the musical theme is not a mixture of tones). The proposition is articulate. A proposition is not a medley of words.-(Just as a theme in music is not a medley of notes.) A proposition is articulated. 5.1361 Der Glaube an den Kausalnexus ist der Aberglaube. Superstition is the belief in the causal nexus. Belief in the causal nexus is superstition. Equally revealing are 2.03, 4.002, 4.016, 6.125, 6.422, to give a sample only of the kinds of improvement that can be found in the new translation. In addition to the carefully made and felicitous translation this volume contains a full index. Primarily it is an index of the English translation; but where it can be of value the German word is also given; and if the German word has been elsewhere translated otherwise these other trans- lations are also given. This will be a very valuable tool for anyone working seriously on the Tractatus, whether he prefers to work from the English or from the German text. The following queries on detailed points are put forward very tentatively for the consideration of the translators and others and not as magisterial corrections: 2.0131 Since the teutonism (in British English) ' tone ' has been re- placed by ' note ' in 3.141, would it not be consistent to do the same here? ' Ton ' should be translated as ' tone ' only when a quality of sound or an interval is in question, whereas here it is a question of pitch. 2.0272 Would not it be better to say that the configuration of objects constitutes rather than produces states of affairs? 'Produces' might suggest a causal relationship. Further, in the index should not ' produce ' follow ' bilden ' in the brackets s.v. 'construct' according to editorial principle? 2.1 Does not 'We picture&amp;facts to ourselves' have too psychological a ring for what is intended by' Wir machen uns Bilder der Tatsachen '? Why not 'We make for ourselves pictures of facts '? 3.33. Would it not be preferable to translate ' darf ' by ' may ' on both occasions of its occurrence in this paragraph? The translation ' In logical 20</page><page sequence="7">300 NEW BOOKS syntax the meaning of a sign should never play a role' might read as methodological advice rather than as a logical observation. 5.154 It is not hard to guess why the translators preferred to translate 'Faktum' by 'truth'. But it is not obvious, and surely 'Faktum' should appear s.v. ' tru/e ' in the index as well as ' wahr '? 5.64 ff. In translating 'das Ich ' might it not be better to write ' the Self ' or even ' the Ego ' rather than ' the self '? 6.41 ' It ' occurs frequently in ' In the world everything is as it is, and everything happens as it does happen: in it no value exists-and if it did, it would have no value'. An unwary reader might think that the last ' it ' refers to the world, whereas the German genders make it clear that the meaning is ' the value would have no value '. 6.42 The translation of ' Saetze koennen nichts Hoeheres ausdruecken' by 'Propositions can express nothing of what is higher' (reviewer's italics) surely makes too prominent the suggestion that there is something higher right enough, though we cannot say so. 6.422 There seems to be a slight non sequitur in Wittgenstein's language (though not in his thought) in this paragraph. He says that it is natural to raise the question 'And what if I do not do it?' when faced with an ethical law of the form 'Thou shalt . . .', and then proceeds to raise a difficulty about raising the question of consequences in ethics, saying finally: 'At least these consequences should not be events '. The next sentence is 'Denn etwas muss doch an jener Fragestellung richtig sein ', which I would translate: 'For something at any rate must be right about asking that question '. Here the ' denn' should surely be ' aber'; we must suppose that some such thought as 'And we must be content with this lesser criticism of the question' is to be supplied. It seems that in translating ' For there must be something right about the question we posed ' our translators disregard the ' doch ' and make the transition even more abrupt than it need be. J. 0. URMSON A Critical Examination of the Belief in a Life After Death. By C. J. DUCAssE. Charles C. Thomas, Springfield, Illinois; Blackwell Scientific Publications Ltd., Oxford, 1961. 70s. Tis book is a vigorous and wide-ranging discussion of a subject which usually generates confusion and prejudice, and which it takes some courage, as well as clear-headedness and empirical knowledge, to handle effectively. In Part I Professor Ducasse lists the causes of belief in survival, pours some very cold water on religious and other arguments designed to show that survival must be a fact, and then lists common arguments designed to show that it cannot be. In Part II he offers an analysis of some of the concepts central to discussion of the question. That is " material " which is, or can be made, perceptually public; that is " mental " which can be introspectively observed; that is " a mind " of which the history contains events (presumably of the mental kind), and of which the nature consists of certain capacities or powers (which can be psycho-physical, psycho- psychical, or physico-psychical). With the terms defined in this manner it is predictable that Part III should consist of a traditional discussion of the relation between the mind, so understood, and the body: there are chapters on materialism and idealism, parallelism, epiphenomenalism, and</page><page sequence="8">NEW BOOKS 301 hypophenomenalism (the doctrine that the body is an ontological by- product of the soul in the way in which epiphenomenalism asserts that the soul is a by-product of the body). Each is rejected in favour of inter- actionism. Part IV is devoted to discarnate life after death. Ducasse declares the problem of survival to be that of deciding what evidence there is of the post-mortem persistence of some or all of the capacities which he declares to make up the mind. In order to decide this question he turns to a consideration of paranormal phenomena, on which he is a well-known expert. He begins with a well-merited and scathing denunciation of those in scientific circles who refuse to attend to the evidence for such pheno- mena, and then describes, in two chapters, some selected cases which are prima facie indicative of survival, among them the Piper communications and the Cross-correspondences. He rejects the argument of E. R. Dodds that recourse to unorthodox but more economical notions of telepathy or clairvoyance would suffice to account for them, and concludes that " the balance of the evidence so far obtained is on the side of the reality of sur- vival, and, in the best cases, of survival not merely of memories of the life on earth, but of survival also of the most significant capacities of the human mind, and of continuing exercise of these " (p. 203). Part V, the longest section of the book, is a discussion of reincarnation. The bulk of it consists of case-histories which it is tempting to interpret in this way. (It includes a vigorous and, I think, successful defence of the famous Bridey Murphy case, which Ducasse argues to be a genuine piece of serious evidence that nevertheless does not need a reincarnation doctrine to explain it.) The conclusion of this Part, if I read it correctly, is that some of the recorded cases are of the sort which we would have to interpret in this way if we accepted the happenings in them as genuine, but that there is at least a little room for doubt about their genuineness. Where a book ranges thus widely there is bound to be disagreement about inclusions and exclusions. Philosophical readers could no doubt dispense with Chapter xiii on Lamont's Illusion of Immortality, and with Chapter xx, which is a list of great thinkers who have happened for one Preason or another to believe in reincarnation. I suppose the inclusion of these could be defended on the ground that the book is written, at least according to the jacket blurb, for EVERYMAN (whom the publishers must, from the price, judge to be a much wealthier person than most philo- sophers). More would have been done to loosen prejudices by amplifying the accounts of paranormal phenomena, good though these are as they stand. Further, Ducasse is clearly impatient to pass from religious con- siderations to empirical ones, partly no doubt, because he has dealt with the former elsewhere. But in view of this I think it would have been better to omit them from the present book altogether. As it is we get a very brusque treatment of the relation between religion and survival doctrines which obscures the actual connections between them. It is a mistaken procedure to suggest that Christians base their belief in an after- life on an inference from the resurrection-stories, and then to try to under- mine this supposed inference by an S.P.R. examination of the gospel narratives. Certainly these are supposed by the majority of Christians to record actual happenings; and certainly these supposed happenings are thought by them to be the warrant for proclaiming future resurrection for men. But they do not accept the records except in the context of a broader acceptance of the gospel portrayal of Jesus and the religious scheme underlying it, as a whole. This may be " irresponsibility ", but it could only be shown to be by reference to far wider considerations than</page><page sequence="9">302 NEW BOOKS can be handled in an isolated scrutiny of the Easter stories. It is only by remembering this that we can understand the lack of interest shown by most Christians towards the findings of psychical researchers. As far as the book's main argument from paranormal phenomena is con- cerned, there is little doubt that scientifically orthodox explanations are out of tne question in many of these cases, and no doubt at all that a doctrine of disembodied survival is a natural response to them. But its being natural does not make it satisfactory, for the doctrine may turn out on examination to be incoherent. An incoherent doctrine is not an open option among competing explanations, however strained or unpalatable the others are. It is not even an open possibility when we are unable to think of any others at all. In his discussion of the mind-body theories Ducasse tries to show the doctrine of disembodied survival to be fit for use by stressing the distinction between states of consciousness and behaviour, and by arguing that they are causally interrelated. While some such view may indeed be necessary to our understanding of flesh-and-blood persons, it is not enough to appeal to it here. For one thing, it is still true that the sphere of application of very many mental predicates cuts across, and is not identical with one half of, the division of private states and behaviour-a post-Rylean commonplace which entails that the concept of a disembodied person, even if coherent, is bound to be much more impoverished than a dualist view of human personality could allow it to be. For another, it is also (and importantly) true that it is because the person who has a given conscious state also has a body that we can form some idea of the individual who has the state, and refer to him (and it). It is the idea of a distinct bodiless individual that an argument for survival needs, and we are a long way from having it. We have no way of spelling out the difference between a particular mental state's belonging to one such being and its belonging to another. We have no way of spelling out what it is for one mental state to belong to the same discarnate being as another mental state. And we have no way of spelling out what it is for such a being to continue between the occurrence of one mental state and the occurrence of another. Consider, for example, Professor Ducasse's suggestion on page 126 that discarnate survival might be in a " wholly latent " form, analogous to the condition of a comatose body. The analogy does not work, for it is not clear in the case of the discarnate person what the difference is between mere " dormant " possession of unexercised faculties and outright non-existence. It is only by incon- sistently supplying a body-surrogate that we can consider ourselves to be entertaining a positive notion, or to be able to answer any of the above difficulties. The doctrine of reincarnation might look as though it avoids some of these problems, since the allegedly reincarnate person is after all said to have a body. But in practice the problems reappear. Let us suppose we are trying to explain Bridey-Murphy-like behaviour in Ruth Simmons, and that to do this we say that Ruth is the reincarnation of Bridey. This might, perhaps, mean that Bridey and Ruth (both embodied persons) are to be identified as an earlier and later phase of one being which is not thought to have any bodiless sort of existence in between the two stages. Whatever we could say about the enormous problems of identity this would involve, it is obvious that this is not the usual notion of reincarna- tion, which Ducasse uses. For this involves, and surely derives its ex- planatory appearance from, the notion of an independently conceivable spiritual entity which leaves one body at its death and subsequently enters</page><page sequence="10">NEW BOOKS 303 another, at its birth or later. (It is especially obvious that this is the notion appealed to when the " reincarnation " is said to be temporary.) When this notion makes its appearance, the same difficulties come up as before. But when all this is said, the case-histories still stare us in the face, and philosophers should play their part in the very speculative task of providing some sort of explanatory framework for them. They will be much helped by reading this book. TERENCE PENELHUM An Introduction to the Pythagorean Writings of the Hellenistic Period. By HOLGER THESLEFF. (Acta Academiae Aboensis. Humaniora XXIV 3), Abo 1961. Pp. 140. THE main results of this book concern (1) the locating and dating of post- Academic Pythagorean pseudepigrapha and anonyma, and (2) the reasons for producing these pseudepigrapha. As to (1) Thesleff considerably 'backdates' in comparison with still widely accepted estimates. He tentatively dates such Ps. Archytea as Peri arch6n and Peri tou ontos, together with the Anonymus Diodori, in the second half of the fourth century; the Anonymus of Alexander Polyhistor (in Diog. L. VIII) in the fourth/third century; other Pseudoarchytea, notably Peri antikei- men6n and Peri t6n katholou log6n, together with fragments by Onatas and Sthenidas, in the third century; Ps. Philolaos' Peri psyches, Ps. Timaeus Locrus' De anima mundi, Ps. Brotinus' Peri nou kai dianoias, Ps. Ocellus' Peri tgs tou pantos physe6s, together with the Anonymus Photii, in the third/ second century. And he places the origin of these writings in widely separated areas of the West and the East. Not so long ago most scholars would have dated virtually all of these writings in the first century B.C. or even later, some, hesitatingly, in the second century B.C., and designated Alexandria as the geographic and intellectual place of their origin. They would also have assumed Posidonian influence on many of them, which Thesleff rules out. As to (2), Thesleff contradicts the communis opinio that all Pythagorean pseudepigrapha are forgeries. Many of their authors simply followed Greek literary convention to attribute their opinions to some famous member of their school, just as did the authors of Pseudohippocratica. Even the works of Ps. Timaeus and Ps. Ocellus became forgeries only after introductory clauses have become attached to them (but I am not quite sure that I understand what Thesleff takes them to have originally been). A re-evaluation of the chronology of all post-Academic Pythagorica in an overall investigation was clearly overdue (see Immisch, Philologische Wochenschrift, 43, 1923, pp. 25-34). By and large Thesleff's 'backdating' seems to be justified. But one wonders whether Thesleff did not dismiss too lightly some of the arguments in favour of much later dates. I think that Pohlenz' arguments (GGN 1942, p. 485, n. 2) for dating Onatas after Ps. Aristoteles' De mundo are very strong and unless Thesleff is prepared to ' backdate 'De mundo, his cSase would here be very weak indeed. Praech- ter's arguments for the post-Posidonian character of the Anonymus Photii (Ueberweg-Praechter, p. 65 n.; p. 157*) are not even registered; those of Reinhardt (art. Posidonius in RE) barely mentioned. Furthermore, Thesleff pays no attention to the observation by Philippson (Philologische Wochenschrift 58, 1938, p. 1040, n. 3) that Plutarch in De Stoic. rep. 23</page><page sequence="11">304 NEW BOOKS reviews a controversy between some Pythagoreans and Chrysippus. Not, only should these Anonymi Plutarchi have been included in Thesleff's investigation but also the question discussed whether the passage in Plutarch does not entirely contradict the assumption (shared by Thesleff: see p. 51) that Pythagorism as a philosophic school became extinct in the third century. Finally, one wonders whether Thesleff would not have strengthened his cause by including instead of excluding (for reasons on p. 24 which remained unclear to me) the Pythagoreans of Sextus Empiricus (Adv. math. X) who, together with the Anonymus of Alexander Polyhistor, Hermodorus, the so-called Divisiones Aristoteleae, and Ps. (?) Aristotle's Categories represent a characteristic blend of doctrines attributed to Plato by Aristotle (the One and the Indeterminate Dyad as supreme principles) with a kind of doctrine of categories, the concepts of more-and-less and of opposition playing an important role in this blend. Such an inclusion would have helped to evaluate a fragment by Kallikratidas and Ps. Archytas' Peri t6n katholou log6n and his Katholikoi logoi deka. Also Mutschmann's introduction in his edition of the Div. Arist., Teubneriana, 1906, could have profitably been used. However, much as further discussion seems desirable, it will in all likeli- hood confirm most of Thesleff's conclusions. PHILIP MERLAN Received also G. W. R.
