When the law of Social Economy—of the duties relating to man as an individual, or rather, the principle of the utilization of all human powers, great and small—comes to be respected by nations as an integral part of Religious Education, it will be embodied in the statutes of every realm ; the right situation will be found for every inhabitant, and. all will be equally qualified by educational training to do work for which they are naturally fitted, in the very best way. Every man will be compelled to contribute his quota of service or labour to the common weal, and will be adequately supported and honoured in whatever position he may be called to fill. Then, but not till then, will Science, Art, Literature, Educa¬ tion, and True Religion, flourish; for the division and faithful consecration of labour will ensure unceasing and intelligent in¬ dustry everywhere. Idleness will be put to shame by law, and by the force of public opinion expressed through law ; and with the disappearance of idleness want will be comparatively rare. Sen¬ suality, intemperance, and crime will no longer be dealt with by the unphilosophical and barbarous arrangements of the prison and the gibbet. We are largely indebted for the long continuance of these absurd forms of punishment among the Bible-reading com¬ munity, to the stern oriental criminal codes which characterize the Old and New Testaments. The enthralling doctrine that the Bible was sent as an infallible and a miraculous authority, has greatly tended to perpetuate this foolish and useless penal severity, and keep us from looking into the subject rationally. But signs are not wanting that reason will soon assert her i ightful autho¬ rity in the adjustment of these questions. All natures disposed to vice or crime will by and by be treated medically. Any man or woman in that good time coming, who lives at variance with the laws of nature and of intelligent society, will be looked upon as in some way the subject of cerebral derangement or defective edu¬ cation, and dealt with as one insane, idiotic, or ignorant, and requiring to be placed under the control of doctors, keepers, or teachers. The accident of birth, fortune, or social status, will then no longer determine, as it now does, the range within which friendships may be formed. When a high education becomes universal, and braces and refines all the powers of the mind in every section of society, the dignity of all honourable and useful labour will be duly respected. The degree of a man's intellectual and moral force may then—though not now—be safely judged by the work to which he is chosen; for the right man will always, under the universal reign of law, fill the right place; the intelli¬ gence of all will be so broad, their feelings so pure, their hearts so generous, and their characters so correct, as to make them com¬ panionable to each other, let their outward circumstances be what they may. The wise will walk with the wise, and the good with the good, irresjjective of the accidents of birth, and wealth. The</page><page sequence="4">PRELIMINARY REMARKS. laws of mind, and of morals too, will then coincide with the laws of the state; and proved vices of the mind, such as selfishness, dishonesty, envy, ingratitude, and conceit, will be dealt with by the enlightened authorities of that day, with full public consent, as prejudicial to the whole nature of the individual, and, in so far, as dangeious to the interests of the entire body politic. The tastes and habits of the masses of the people may not be so openly barbarous now as in ages gone by, but still society is ill at ease with itself. Whether we look in the walks of commerce, the sphere of politics, the family, or the social circle, we find that the mass of th.e people continue under the sway of mad passion or •foolish prejudice. We are over-ridden by priestcraft, social enmi¬ ties, and class inequalities ; capital and labour bidding each other defiance ; pauperism draining the resources of the honest and the thrifty by its hungry and oppressive demands, and crushing the higher possibilities of the pauper's nature ; crime sparing neither age nor sex in the havoc it is continually making with human life and property; hard and fast lines, ridiculously capricious, drawn "between class and class ; vice sitting without a blush in high pilaces, and making its contagion to be felt, more or less, through¬ out all grades of society; ignorance holding its carnival in the lanes, bye-ways, and alleys of our great towns; and all for the want of educational enlightenment. But to meet it, the age of thought is full of promise. Igno- lance must vanish, and with it its viper brood—crime, error, evil, jniseiy, and suffering. A century or two may intervene ; but suiely as mind progresses the future shall yield this fruit, and the v, hole earth shall partake of it in harmony. Tell me not of the past. I respect it for its truths; but the world's genii have elevated us far, far above the bravest thoughts of our forefathers. We have actualized their wildest idealities. Our own ideal is for the future. Men, one and all, feel, deeply feel, that great wrongs are to be righted, great errors are to be overcome, and anxiously wait the blast the trump of their leader shall send, down the gale. They expect a higher, purer morality; ihey feel that the age of thought is in store for the future, dimly seen through the long vista of events by the Hebrew seers and prophets of past ages, shadowed forth in tho constitution of mind ; f,n age of thought whose brilliant morning lights up the mental world, let us hope, by its rapid coming. For as long as a slave tends up a petition to sympathizing heaven ; as long as the chains of despotism canker the limbs of the down-trodden masses; as long as ignorance and attendant crimes encompass us, there will be no content; and so long will the world, lost in darkness, cry loudly, wildly, from its bed of torture, "Light! light! more light " WILLIAM SKINNER RHILLIPPO, Wood Xoiuo c, Theipji.d, Nortolk, September, 1872.</page><page sequence="5">ON EDUCATION. f"FHE subject I have here written upon is one the importance of which it is scarce possible to estimate too highly ; its interests are not simply of a speculative character, but are connected with the destinies of a very large portion of the human race. Mankind, in this our day, are agitating questions respecting human advancement; and there are none more exciting in their immediate interest, more momentous in their ultimate results, in short, more imperative in their demand on our deepest attention, than those which have for their solution the complicated pheno¬ mena of social science. Of these the subject of education, it will be conceded on all hands, must ever stand out prominently as the question of questions. In former ages education was denominated " inspiration," and the ancients held all educated men as inspired ; and they wore called seers, prophets, priests, levites, patriarchs, divines, sooth¬ sayers, astrologers, magicians, sorcerers, enchanters, wizards, ne¬ cromancers, exorcists, witches, gipsies, conjurors, interpreters of dreams, fortune tellers, casters of nativities, and the liko. The word •'inspiration," in its primary meaning, relates to the atmosphere. It was an ancient supposition (or rather, I should say, superstition) that ideas were inhaled with the breath. A man found himself possessed of an idea or thought which the moment before he had not; whence the ancients considered it in-breathed or inspired with the air. In the mediseval ages mathematics and theology absorbed the work of teaching, under the notion that they possessed a special power of accomplishing that object; results, however, have proved that their educational influence is very limited. Their technical and abstract characters unfit them for the office of awakening, in immature or unripe minds, an interest for intellectual pursuits. Persons who are naturally inclined towards abstract studies, need the least to be urged upon them by extraneous means, because facilities which are inherently active are sure to become fairly trained by the usual incidents of life. It is those powers which 1</page><page sequence="6">A ON EDUCATION. are inherently lethargic and inactive that require to be led forth and exercised by external aid. Mathematics and theology, there¬ fore, in ordinary school and college practice, furnish what is super¬ fluous, but fail to supply what is requisite and necessary. The applied sciences, on the other hand, are no less remarkably fitted for the business of education, because they lead to abstract generalization, through illustration. They excite interest by awakening the sense of wonder, and so convert details, otherwise dry and wearying, into pleasurable and gratifying objects of study or curiosity. Nature herself operates by first arousing in the child's mind powers of observation, and then developing habits of reflection. Education should steadily follow the example set by nature. This, then, is one strong argument for the employment of the physical sciences in the work of teaching ; but another, no less important ground for their employment in this service, is found in the fact that they educate the mental powers by useful instruction. They furnish valuablo information, while they train the perceptive and reflective faculties. By education we want to unfold or draw out these faculties that are inherent in the mind, to unravel the vigour of judgment and reason, and bring into sub¬ jection the irrational impulse and passion to moral purpose and intelligent will. Let us bear in mind the immense disadvantages which a want of such scientific education entails upon a nation. It is enough to recollect that every step forward in civilization has been due to some advance in science. In the world in which we live we are surrounded by powers i onservative as well as destruc¬ tive ; a knowledge of which., to sorne oxtent at least, is necessary for our continued existence ; whil e life, with any degree of comfort and success, is possible only when we have mastered them to con¬ siderable detail, and can utilize them for our own purposes. Further, Nature is an inexorable mistress; the slightest infringe¬ ment of her laws, whether through ignorance or perversity, is alike avenged with the severest penalties. In the reign of natural law reparation is impossible. It is a deduction from the persist¬ ence of force, that if we make a -inale falso step we must be con¬ tent to carry its consequences" 'i us to the grave; hence the inadequacy, the disadvantage o' uy system of education which does not include a knowledge "-.. nature. Again, viewing it in another light, as to the rapid L &gt;ose of children, or population, in civilized countries; whose pe* " p energies, under accumulating pressure, must, in longer or sh -• r periods, find a vent, as they have already done, in migratior igration, aggression, or bloody wars against one another. Ho^ 'ploss must be the condition of a people, then, who from want of jquisite education and culture, are unable either to avert or wi^1 nd these destructive eruptions! You will not find the word " nation " in either the Bible or Testament; its meaning in thi&gt;-&gt; rrly days was cunning, craft, fraud, dexterity, and bravery ; t when men practised and ex¬ celled in these, whether they v &gt;. ings, captains, priests, or pro¬ phets, they were reckoned wise &gt;n. Again, you will not find the</page><page sequence="7">ON EDUCATION. 3 "word "religion" anywhere mentioned in the Bible, for this reason, "because the history of Christ had not appeared, with his miracles and supernatural wonders, to bind all the scripts, letters, or parch¬ ments together, to form the Scriptures. The word " religion " means "binding together," and not the pure knowledge of the Creator, as is mostly represented ; and therefore, if education is to have religion for its base, or the binding together of the untrue, filthy, indecent, immoral, contradictory, and unwise tales and statements,'—such as a snake and a donkey talking, Cain's murder¬ ous jealousy, Noah's drunkenness, Ham's irreverence, Abraham's cowardice, Moses's butcheries, Aaron's idolatries, Onan's self pollu¬ tion, Sarah's untruthfulness, Jacob's lying, Rebekah's deceitful- ness, Ishmael's petulence, Hagar's insolence, Esau's hatred, La- ban's subtlety, Simeon's ferocity, Judah's sexual intercourse, Lot's incest, David's adulteries, Solomon's debaucheries, Jael's murder, Rahab's lies, Hosea's whoredoms, Jonah's whale, Saul's witch, the eun and moon standing still, the sun-dial going back, the coition of the Great Creator of the universe with a woman, the resurrection frora the grave, and the ascension through the boundless regions of space up to the sky of such supposed Son, and also his miracles and supernatural doings ;—it will be useless in scientific England in this our day, and henceforth. But, as I said in my " Medita¬ tions," I hope the time is not far distant when the lovers of pure- minded truth will welcome the day in which theology shall be allowed to throw off the absurd and repulsive dress by which priests and preachers have disfigured her, and to take her place everywhere, in her own beauty and dignity, at the head of all the sciences ; when the dragon of priestcraft, and the griffin of sec¬ tarianism, shall be routed by a real and effective national systorn of education. It is seldom that a layman like myself is willing to speak out on such important subjects, because of that respect and reverence which I think too many of us are accustomed to pay to the shibboleths and war-cries of the clergy of these most priest- ridden British Isles. I wish you to bear in mind that there is a pure and true theo¬ logy, which is rich in the most attractive questions that can engage the human intellect, and within the reach of all classes, even of those who know no language but their own; a theology which presents fields of enquiry as open, as free from acrimony, and, to a great number of you, many times as interesting and accessible as those of other sciences, if you love truth, and really esteem each other. This true theology disdains the sarcastic compliment wherewith she is bowed out of the circles in which other portions of divine truth are studied—that her topics are too sacred to be freely handled. There is no science really more sacred than an¬ other ; for there is nothing more sacred than truth. All the jewels which science treasures up and compares are holy of the holiest, ineffably holy ; for all truth is God's truth, all truth is God's eternal thought. Now, parents, you send your children to the primary Stato</page><page sequence="8">4 ON EDUCATION. Church schools, and what for So that when they are old enough to take a higher position in the scale of learning, they may be prepared to take all their rudiments of thought up into a more practical mental development. For this end the primary schools are established, and that is why you consent to send your children to them. Now, what is this earth It is a primary school. It is primary in the physical as in the spiritual; just as much in the social as in the intellectual. No doubt you naturally wish and want your children to be educated so that they may climb and reach the summits of the great trees of truth thereon. Otherwise you have no philosophy and no science in your religion ; it is only a dumb, shallow, idiotic heathenism, blundering and stumbling- head foremost into all the absurdities of supernaturalisrn. Mystery and fear are what the old clergymen and schoolmasters consider the best stock-material in their stupendous trade. The high call¬ ing of every Reformer is to make truth a simple unity and a sub¬ lime reality. We, the Reformers have science and philosophy beneath our feet, truth in our principles, and reason in our propo¬ sitions ; and nothing is true to our minds because any particular individual has " said" it ; no authority to us in a "Thus saith the Lord." According to our definition, education consists in the culti¬ vation of the intelligence and the moral sense. Thus using the term education in its broad sense, and without reference to tech¬ nical instruction in special subjects, we can only answer, that its purpose is to make children into good and capable men and women, by cultivating their intelligence and their moral sense, or conscience. It follows, then, that if we agree to this definition, we are bound to reject, as worse than useless, any instruction which is calculated to repress or pervert either of those faculties from their proper healthy development. Agreeing, then, that the object of education is the development of the intellect and moral sense, we shall no doubt further agree, that the best chance of successful^ cultivating those desirable qualities which wo desig¬ nate " virtues," lies in impressing the mind while young with the most elevated and winning examples of them, and guarding it from any familiarity with their opposite? ; and that it is because we deem such qualities to be best, when we regard the Deity as possessing them in the infinite, and hold up as a pattern of life the most perfect examplo of them in the finite. Yet, though agreeing both in the object and method of education, when thus plainly put before us, so ingeniously perverse and inconsistent are we, that we first refuse to agree upon any common svstem of in¬ struction whatever, and then we insist upon neutralizing or ^ iti- ating such instructing as we do agree upon, by mingling it with teaching which is at once repressive of the intellect, and injurious to the moral sense. The sole impediment to the success of our efforts, tho rock upon which all our hopes of rescuing the mass of our countrymen from ignorance and barbarism are in danger of being dashed, consists in the unreasoning and indiscriminate vene¬ ration in which the Bible is popularly hold amongst us. Impelled</page><page sequence="9">ON EDUCATION. 0 "by that veneration, we hesitate not to degrade our children's view of the Deity, by familiarising them with a literature in which He is represented as feeble, treacherous, implacable, and unjust; and confound at once their intelligence and moral sense, by compelling them to regard that literature as altogether divine and infallible. Strange infatuation and inconsistency, that, after toiling for years to obtain an effective system of national education, we either abandon the task as hopeless, or insist upon accompanying it by teaching which involves a fatal outrage upon the very intellect and conscience which it is the express purpose of that education to foster and develop There is in society a supercilious class, or, rather, I ought say, a super-siUy class, who fancy and profess that they know all—a band of intellectual finishers—persons who have an unhappy con¬ ceit in the perceptive powers, that they are thoroughly "posted." These persons are not at all accustomed to think upon the spi¬ ritual, practical, and progressive questions discussed in this our age. And yet these same persons have a conceit that they cannot be further informed. Every such mind has a social centre, and will exert his or her magnetic influence upon others. It does not as yet seem to be a part of human belief that our race should make progress as rapidly, as broadly, and as completely in spi¬ ritual realities as in science, arts, philosophy, and the common concerns of the world. The idea which prevails is, that our race must repose on "faith," and stand eternally still in all matters pertaining to the mysteries of God, while it is esteemed right to grow and improve in all things else, and in all other directions. This subtile absurdity has crawled its way through all our reli¬ gious creeds. As regards "faith," as a writer says, "it is a belief in some one or other of the many codes of religion offered for our acceptance, as something required by the Supreme Being;" in fact, a kind of passport needful to carry us through the gates of death, and land us safely in some future existence, So long as men hold such views, faith is cherished by them as a thing in itself meritorious, and in proportion to the strength and reality of these convictions will they seek after and prize faith in the articles of the church or sect, whatever it may be, to which they belong. When, however, another stage of development is reached, and, instead of taking opinions upon authority, men begin to think seriously for themselves, to examine into these views, to enquire upon what ground faith is supposed te be meritorious and accept¬ able to the Supreme, and, further, to examine into the foundation of many current opinions, they may be led to other and widely- different conclusions. Many have, upon examination, found them¬ selves unable to receive any of the different creeds; the proofs adduced in support of the doctrines advanced not appearing to their minds sufficient to warrant their acceptance, they find them¬ selves compelled at last to work out, bit by bit, all the truth that is to be the daily bread of their mental existence. Such is the attitude of thousands of men and women at the present day. 1—3</page><page sequence="10">b ' ON EDUCATION. They have examined the old foundations that seemed so strong and solid, they have examined so-called infallible truth, and it has crumbled away piecemeal in their grasp; one point after another has been abandoned as neither proved nor provable, till at last they stand surrounded by the wrecks of former creeds, with life before them, and the question on their lips, " What am I to believe. Is there anything upon which I may ground a reason¬ able hope in life and in death ?" Knowlodge opens to them her wondrous stores; science discloses her thousand times ten thou¬ sand realms of wonder and of beauty, unfolding a universe of life in a few drops of muddy water, pointing to her countless suns and systems, and suggesting that all analogy and probability tend to tho inference that our earth, with its inhabitants, is but as a grain of sand upon the shore, amidst these million worlds, with their myriads of inhabitants. It destroys our superstition, it removes the miserable fears that invade men's peace—for none can deeply gaze into the wonders of nature and fail to read in the order which rules each grain of dust in its gravitation, that each being has his appointed place, safe under the stupendous laws which govern all known existence. But, again, true faith is a needful part of human nature, as much so as are hope and love ; we can no more live without faith than without these. Eaith is not cre¬ dulity, nor belief in dogma, nor is it knowledge. It is a rational trust beyond the limits of knowledge, yet founded upon it; it is the hand by which we grope in the darkness for that which we have reason to believe is at hand, although our vision discerns it not. By faith the child reposes upon the love and judgment of the parent who has been true to it; by faith we trust the friend who has been loyal to us, even where his conduct may appear strange, his motives be unknown. In a word, faith would seem to be the quality by which we reason from the known to the un¬ known, by which we gather, from experience, confidence in that which is yet untried. If it be, then, a needful part of our nature, we should be mistaken in endeavouring to banish it from our highest and deepest thoughts, refusing all comfort beyond the regions of absolute certitude; but we must be careful that what we take to our bosom is Eaith, and not her foes, Credulity and Superstition, who wear her semblance - and destroy her work. Eaith, the twin sister of Hope, is the offspring of Knowledge and Reason. The purpose of existence is hidden from us; but we mark the unbroken order, the bent towards good, the progress which runs through the ages. Erom science, in her minutest details, we learn that the very spot of mould clinging to the wall follows its appointed development, that the wisp of hay floating on the puddle evolves a world of life according to unswerving- laws. All progress in science and general education, within the last century, points toward the discovery and disclosures of real reli¬ gion. All the important and refining sciences, which verge on the spiritual, have come up within that space of time. Our navi-</page><page sequence="11">ON EDUCATION. 7 gators have, within the last hundred years, ploughed through all the seas of the globe, have sought knowledge of the most obscure and sequestered lakes, rivers, and lands, in the most remote countries in the earth, and have returned to tell us faithfully of their scenes, explorations, and experiences. The interiors of the earth have been evoked. In answer to practical prayers, they have divulged their arcana, and their inmost secrets have become our every-day facts—"familiar as household words," Great mountains have "been scaled, and distant heavenly planets have been measured; the expansiveness and perfections of the universe, above us and around, have been searched and mapped by our astronomers ; and the familiar " sun " has been induced to become party to the finest pencillings, so that when we stand before the photographic magi¬ cian, coming within-the field of his camera, and at the focus of his mystic glass, we seem to be facing a supernatural realm. The light instantly projects a shadow, paints your picture on the susceptible surface of an insensate plate. Thus all human pro¬ gress in the imitative, in the speculative, and in the absolute, demonstrate further discoveries with reference to the great future home. We find, in searching history, that human nature has "been blessed ever and anon with inspirations that convey the ele¬ ments and rudimonts of truths. We must have education based on such truths, derived from science, sense, and reason; so, as if children ask, as I did when a child, why are salt and snow white, leaves green, roses red, violets purple, the sky blue, smoke black, fire hot, ice cold, &amp;c, they may not receive such an answer as myself; namely—"You are a silly boy; you ask very foolish questions. Sit down, and hold your tongue." It is no wonder that the orthodox should have a horror of secular education. Their misgivings are quite natural. It may be safely assumed that when human minds are reared under the simple light of knowledge, the results will not be what they have been under the manipulation of the clergy. When the working man has learned to cast an eye of intelligence into nature, it will "be unlikely enough that he will find in sun, moon, stars, sky, air, earth, and nature, the god of any sect or creed. It has required a great deal of special instruction to lead mankind to believe the popular theology, and it is not without a certain satisfaction that the freethinker welcomes the admission, that minds may be trained to explore all actual knowledge without finding any basis for the Thirty-nine Articles or the Westminster Catechism. Nor need the freethinker conceal his consent that the fears of the orthodox are founded on truth. He knows that the cry for education, which is tho arch of light spanning the cloud of misery and vice around us, will not vanish before its promise is fulfilled. Its meaning is, that superstition is to be lifted from the hearts and minds of the people; and its end may be secured by the devious, no less surely thau by the direct, path. It is not his cause that need fear the turning of town councils and parish meetings into reli¬ gious debating clubs, the struggle in every village over the</page><page sequence="12">8 ' ON EDUCATION. religion to be taught in schools, the boring of children by Bible- readings and catechisms. It is the season that is in the sky which decides whether the falling rain shall do good or harm. The spirit and tendency of the age will determine the effect of the application of a permissive Act of Uniformity to compulsory edu¬ cation. The reading of the Scriptures of a particular religion, in schools supported by taxation of those who disbelieve that reli¬ gion, can only be regarded as an oppression. It is not contended that there are not Bibles enough for all who desire them, and opportunities to have the same read to the children of those who look upon the English Bible as the Word of God. To bring it, therefore, in the common schools, is to clothe the teacher so far with the functions of a priest, and to raise a sectarian flag, and with it all the jealousies and suspicions of opposing creeds, over the school which should be dear to all as their own home. I have heard appended to the maxim that " parents have no more right to starvo their children's minds than to starve their bodies," the declaration, that they had just as little right to starve their children's souls as to starve their minds or bodies: in sublime oblivion of the fact, that while we agree about the nature of bread, and the nature of reading and writing, what one ^ thinks food for the soul another believes to be poison. We Eng¬ lish people have compared the statistics of every crime with the statistics of ignorance, and have been brought face to face with the fact, that the training of children in ignorance is really the crippling- of their energies, the corruption of their morals; and that, in the presence of facts that amount to national disgrace, right and duty compel the State to see that every child is edu¬ cated. The children being those of Catholics, Jews, Rationalists, Dissenters, and Protestant Christians, it follows plainly that com¬ pulsory schools, which they are all taxed to support, cannot in justice teach what either regards as harmful. England has not the right to compel the Catholic child to listen to the reading of /*,. the Protestant Bible, nor the Jewish child to learn of the New Testament; nor to insist that the child of the Rationalist shall be taught that God over talked and conversed in human voice and language with man. This simple position is met by an outcry against "godless schools ;" but, to some among us, every school must be godless. The denominational schools are godless to all who do not believe in the god they have set up. Trinitarian, Unitarian, Calvinist, and Jew, worship deities as different as Brahim, Allah, and Jesus. But they all agree that man should know how to read, write, count, and comprehend the principles of honesty, justice, veracity, and benevolence. The teaching of any special form of religion is technical; and one man has the same right to tax me to turn his son out an accomplished Freethinker, that another has to tax me to make his son a Christian. The question is, can we by co¬ operation extend our means so as to secure to every child the education that each finds good for his own, whatever be the pro-</page><page sequence="13">ON EDUCATION. Ik fession, trade, or religion to which he desires him to belong If we cannot separate the general education which all require, from the special religious teaching which some desire, it only proves that such co-operation is impossible; but it is no solution to say that we must pay to have our neighbour's children taught what we are unwilling to have our own taught. It is to add meanness to injustice, to invite us to be satisfied with keeping our children from school while the Bible is being read, or the religion we believe false is taught; as would be felt even by orthodox obtuse- ness, if every Christian in England were taxed for the propagation of Brahminism in India, or Mahometanism in Arabia. A man can partly counteract an error taught his own child ; but he is gravely asked to consent to aid in propagating what he holds to be falsehood, beyond his power of control or remedy. Look at our traditional Creeds as taught by the orthodoxy, are they not a mass of absurdities, in which children are forced to say they believe in; while at their years, at any rate, to believe it is not possible. Thus it is that the duty and practice of lying forms part of every Church of England Child's first lesson. I will here give the four Christian Creeds as repeated and taught in all Christian Churches and Schools throughout the kingdom, and forced into the mouths of children as soon as they can begin to lisp or speak. First, THE APOSTLES' CREED. I believe in God the Father Almighty, Maker of Heaven and earth; And in Jesus Christ his only Son our Lord ; who was conceived by the Holy Ghost, Born of the Virgin Mary, Suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, dead, and buried; He descended into hell; The third day he rose again from the dead; He ascended into Heaven, and sitteth on the right hand of God the Father Almighty; From thence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead. I believe in the Holy Ghost; The holy Catholick Church; The Communion of Saints; The Forgiveness of Sins; The Resurection of the Body; And the Life everlasting. Amen. Second, THE NICENE CREED. I believe in one God the Father Almighty, Maker of Heaven and Earth. And of all things visible and invisible : And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son. of God Begotten of his Father before all worlds; God of God, Light, of Light, very God of very God, Begotten, not made, Being of one substance with the Father, By whom all things were made; Who for us men, and for our salvation, came down from Heaven, And was incarnate by the Holy Ghost, of the Virgin Mary, And was made man, And was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate. He suffered, and was buried, And the third day he rose again according to the Scriptures, And ascended into Heaven, And sitteth on the right hand of the Father. And ho shall come again 1—3</page><page sequence="14">10 ON EDUCATION. with glory to judge both the quick and the dead; Whose kingdom shall have no end. And I believe in the Holy Ghost, The Lord and giver of Life, Who proceedeth from the Father and Son; Who with the Father and Son together is worshipped and glorified, Who spake by the prophets. And I believe one Catholick and Apostolick Church ; I acknowledge one Baptism for the remission of sins ; And I look for the Resurrection of the dead, And the life of the world to come. Amen. Third, st. athanasius's creed. Whosoever will be saved; before all things it is necessary that he hold the catholick Faith. Which Faith, except every one do keep whole and undefiled; without doubt he shall perish everlastingly. And the catholick Faith is this : That we worship one God in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity; Neither confounding the Persons: nor dividing the substance. For there is one Person of the Father, another of the Son: and another of the Holy Ghost. But the Godhead of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy ©host is all one: the Glory equal, the Majesty co-eternal. Such as the Father is, such is the Son: and such is the Holy Ghost. The Father uncreate, the Son uncreate: and the Holy Ghost uncreate. The Father incomprehensible, the Son incomprehensible: and the Holy Ghost incomprehensible. The Father eternal, the Son eternal: and the Holy Ghost eternal; And yet there are not three eternals but one eternal. As also there are not three incomprehensibles, not three uncreated: but one uncreated, and one incomprehensible. So likewise the Father is Almighty, the Son Almighty : and the Holy Ghost Almighty; And yet they are not three Almighties: but one Almighty. So the Father is God, the Son is God: and the Holy Ghost is God. And yet they are not three Gods : but one God. So likewise the Father is Lord, the Son Lord: and the Holy Ghost Lord; And yet not three Lords : but one Lord. For like as we are compelled by the Christian verity: to acknowledge every Person by himself to be God and Lord; So are we forbidden by the Catholick Religion : to say, There be three Gods, or three Lords. The Father is made of none : neither created nor begotten. The Son is of the Father alone: not made, nor created, but "begotten. The Holy Ghost is of the Father, and of the Son : neither made, .nor created, nor begotten, but proceeding.</page><page sequence="15">ON EDUCATION. ] 1 So there is one Father, not three Fathers : one Son, not three Sons: one Holy Ghost, not three Holy Ghosts. And in this Trinity none is afore, or after other: none is greater or less than another ; But the whole three Persons are co-eternal together and co-equal. So that in all things as is aforesaid: The Unity in Trinity, and the Trinity in Unity is to be worshipped. He therefore that will be saved: must thus think of the Trinity. Furthermore, it is necessary to everlasting salvation : that he also believe rightly the Incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ. For the right Faith is, That we believe and confess: that our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is God and Man; God of the substance-of the Father, begotten before the worlds; and Man of the Substance of his Mother, born in the world; Perfect God, and perfect Man; of a reasonable soul and human flesh subsisting; Equal to the Father, as touching his Godhead : and inferior to the Father, as touching his Manhood. Who although he be God, and Man : yet he is not two but one Christ. One; not by conversion of the Godhead into flesh : but by taking of the Manhood into God; One altogether ; not by confusion of Substance : but by unity of Person. For as the reasonable soul and flesh is one man: so God and Man is one Christ; Who suffered for our salvation: descended into hell, rose again the third day from the dead; He ascended into heaven, he sitteth on the right hand of the Father, God Almighty: from whence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead. At whose coming all men shall rise again with their bodies : and shall give account for their own works. And they that have done good, shall go into life everlasting: and they that have done evil, into everlasting fire. This is the Oatholick Faith: which except a man believe faithfully he cannot be saved. Fourth, the catholic creed. "I.—I most stedfastly admit and embrace Apostolical and Ecclesiastical tradition, and all other observances and constitutions of the same Church. "II.—I also admit the holy Scriptures, according to that sense which our Holy Mother, the Church, has held and does hold, to which it belongs to judge of the true sense and interpretation of the Scriptures; nor will I ever take and interpret them otherwise than according to the unanimous consent of the fathers. "III.—I also profess that there are truly and properly seven Sacraments of the new law, instituted by Jesus Christ our Lord, and necessary for the salvation of mankind, though not all for</page><page sequence="16">12 ON EDUCATION. every one ; to wit, Baptism, Confirmation, Eucharist, Penance, Extreme Unction, Orders, and Matrimony; and that they confer grace ; and that of these, Baptism, Confirmation, and Orders, cannot be reiterated without sacrilege; and I also receive and admit the received and approved ceremonies of the Catholic Church, used in the solemn administration of all the aforesaid Sacraments. " IV.—I embrace and receive all and every one of the things which have been defined and declared in the holy Council of Trent, concerning original sin and justification. " V.—I profess, likewise, that in the mass there is offered to God a true, proper, and propitiatory sacrifice for the living and the dead ; and that in the most holy Sacrament of the Eucharist, there are truly, really, and substantially the body and blood, together with the soul and divinity of our Lord Jesus Christ; and that there is made a conversion of the whole substance of the bread into the body, and of the whole substance of the wine into the blood; which conversion the Catholic Church calls transubstantiation. I also confess, that under either kind alone, Christ is received whole and entire, and a true Sacrament. " VI.-—I constantly hold that there is a Purgatory, and that the souls therein detained are helped by the suffrages of the faithful. "VII.—Likewise, that the saints, reigning together with Christ, are to be honoured and invocated; and that they offer prayers to God for us, and that their relics are to be held in veneration. " VIII.—I most firmly assert that the images of Christ, of the Mother of God, ever virgin, and also of other saints, may be had and retained: and that due honour and veneration are to be given them. " IX.—I also affirm that the power of Indulgences was left by •Christ in the Church, and that the use of thorn is most wholesome to Christian people. "X.—I acknowledge the Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Roman Church for the Mother and mistress of all Churches; and I promise true obedience to the Bishop of Rome, Successor to St. Peter, Prince of the Apostles, and Vicar of Jesus Christ. XI.—I likewise undoubtingly receive and profess all other things delivered, defined, and declared by the Sacred Canons and General Councils, and particularly by the holy Council of Trent; and I condemn, reject, and anathematize all things contrary thereto, and all heresies which the Church has condemned, rejected, and anathematized. "XII.-—-This true Catholic faith, out of which none can be saved, which I now freely profess, and truly hold, I, iV", promise, vow, and swear most constantly to hold and profess the same whole and ontire, with God's assistance, to the end of my life ; and to procure, as far as it lies in my power, that the same shall be held, taught, and preached by all who are under me, or are entrusted to my care, by and in virtue of my office. So help me God, and these holy Gospels of God." I will here make a few observations in reference to the first, or</page><page sequence="17">ON EDUCATION. 13 '" The Apostle's Creed," as it is called, and from which the others are derived. I would here observe that this name, thus formally and universally applied—applied to this formulary) or creed, which, of those by whom in that character it is forced into the mouths of children, there is not one by whom any such notion is entertained, as that any one of those immediate disciples or apostles of Jesus had any, the smallest share in the for¬ mation of it! Applied ?—and by whom By the rulers of the Fniglish Church—Church of England past and present—by that bench of Archbishops and Bishops whose names stand at the head of an association, instituted for a set of purposes, of which the first in the order of time, as well as importance, is the causing the whole population to receive the formulary or creed in that character. " An association," as Jeremy Bentham says, " of which one main object is, to give currency to a forgery! -To continue—and that for ever—to palrn upon the rising generation as genuine, an already exposed imposture. On the whole bench sits there so much as a single individual who will venture to declare that he believes it not to have been a forgery That he believes any of those to have had a hand in it in whose name it is thus putji/pon the whole people To all those who do not, with a critical eye pointed to the questions of verity and authenticity, occupy themselves in the searching of the Scriptures, the immediate and sole looked-to evidence of that verity and authen¬ ticity, consists in the implied evidence supposed to be bestowed upon it by those Right Reverend and well-paid witnesses. But here are these same witnesses, continually occupied in giving an attestation of authenticity to a document, of the seriousness of which they cannot but be, every one of them, fully conscious." In relation to this document, thus placed and employed, a few questions naturally present themselves, as to the right use of taking the whole instrument as it stands; and thus at the ten- derest age forcing it into the mouths of children. I will here make a few observations thereon. (1) " Who was conceived by the Holy Ghost."—-Not to dispute the matter of fact—the child,—is it in the nature of the case that the idea of this conception, or of any conception at all, should be entertained by such children at such an early age, by whom the answer is lisped (2) " Born of the Virgin Mary."'—The like question to this clause. Born of a Virgin Yes ; viz. of a woman who was once a virgin; but if that be what is here to be understood, so was every woman's first child that was ever born. But, born without injuring her virginity ?—she remaining after the birth as entirely a virgin as she was before Is this a matter, the conception of which is, to children at such early ages, in the number of things possible But even admitting the possibility,—the attempt to convey an idea such as this, can it in any way be of use (3) " Suffered under Pontius Pilate."-—To children at such early ages, the name of the Roman governor under whose government</page><page sequence="18">14 'ON EDUCATION. the suffering took place—his vileness in acting contrary to the dictates of his conscience, and the advice of his wife through her dreams,—the remembrance of such can be of no particular use to such infants. (4) " Was crucified, dead, and buried."—Remember, this was God's Son. Now, if God's Son was thus mortal, what should jDi-e- serve his Father from being mortal too If it was the Son's turn to die at that time, may it not one of these days be the Father's turn And then what is to become of the world and all that live in it The children are likewise taught to believe that God the Father and God the Son are not two persons, and that one and one do not make two; and they'll chide the poor children for their ignorance. Now, to any practical purpose, whether this or any part of it be true or no, is not, to child or man, worth enquiry. How should it be For to human conduct, take it in any of these ways, what difference does it make But in regard to all this, or any part of this, to force a child to declare—to declare most solemnly and seriously—that he or she believes it—believes it just as he or she believes in the existence of the person by whose words and gestures the words are forced into their mouths, and this in a case in which any such belief is as plainly impossible In this lies the mischief; and so long as, in a habit of falsehood and in¬ sincerity, and that a universal one, there is any thing mischievous, this mischief will be as real as the pretended belief is false. (5) " He descended into hell."—Of the matter of fact here asserted, the truth being admitted, (though for the admitting it, no warrant was ever so much as attempted to be found in any part of Scripture that bears any relation to Jesus, and though as well might it have been asserted that, while a visit was then paid to hell by Jesus, a visit was at the same time paid to heaven by tho Devil); still on this, as on so many preceding and succeeding occasions, comes the question—supposing the fact ever so well established—to what possible good use, force a child, as soon ss it can speak, to say that it believes this, or so much as use any endea¬ vours to cause it actually to believe any such thing (6) " He rose again from the dead."-—A tale founded on hearsay and untrue evidence of the grossest kind, because every one knows it is contrary to the decrees of Almighty God, and utterly impossible to have taken place. Why, if such an event was to take place in this our day, the churches would be filled to overflowing every Sunday, and the children need not be taught it. (7) " He ascended into heaven, and sitteth at the right hand of God."— Two more falsehoods to instruct children in, and. the latter contra¬ dicted bv their own teaching; as they have commanded them to be taught that God is a Spirit, without hands or feet, and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth ; consequently, no one can sit at his right hand. (8) "From thence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead."— This, a prophetic inspiration. It is a pity the Apostles did not 2H'X&gt;heKy that men would rise into the air by means of a few</page><page sequence="19">ON EDUCATION. 15 sheets of paper; that bridges without arches would be thrown across rivers; that locomotives drawn by steam would far surpass carriages drawn by horses ; that the electric spark would literally "put a girdle round the earth in forty minutes ;" that hydrogen gas would light up cities and towns. Then it would be right to teach the rising generation such truthful facts ; but to teach young children the palpable falsehoods in their creed must be very wrong. (9) " Ibelieve in the Holy Ghost."—More sounds without sense! mere words without meaning! Not only void of all meaning, which to any such young children can be of any use, but without any thing attached that can be called meaning. The Holy Ghost being something which is the same as God, and at the same time distinct from God ; and being something in which, clay by day, the children are obliged to say that they believe. Its symbol is a-dove, or pigeon, and God the Father is represented as an old man, and God the Son a young man; these three Gods, i.e. the two men and the pigeon, make, after all, but one and the same object of belief, and that object a God. These, when this system of instruction has been read, marked, learnt, and inwardly digested, comprise and constitute the subject of all this science—the object of the young child's belief; of that belief of which he, or she, is forced to say that they entertain it. (10) " I believe in—the Holy Cdtholic Church"—What can children understand themselves to have spoken of themselves as doing, when they are forced to declare that they believe in the Holy Catholic Church, of which they never before heard spoken of as being in existence. Now, as the Holy Ghost, in whom the chil¬ dren have just been declaring themselves to believe in—whatso¬ ever is or is not meant by "holiness "—that " Ghost," without any difficulty, might be reckoned "holy," as it is supposed to emanate from God.. But this Church, composed as it is of the barbarous men called Papists, is this, too, "holy! "—holy even as the Holy Ghost is holy On the part of the poor children,'—supposing any particle of thought to be bestowed upon the subject,—how dis¬ tressing must be the perplexity into which they find themselves plunged But no ; before it has arrived thus far, the plain truth of the case is, that whether in the breast of a child, or in the breast of an adult, the faculty of thought, having found itself baffled and wearied out, has in despair withdrawn itself from the subject, leaving in the grasp of the conception and the memory, nothing but a string of sounds and characters, void of all sense. (11) " The Communion of Saints."—One more riddle. What can such young children know of Saints What, in relation to this matter, can be the little creature's belief? Something, perhaps, to this effect,—that among the Apostles there were men who used to be called "Saints." 12) " The forgiveness of sins ; the resurrection of the body; and the life everlasting."-—On these several points, to the present purpose, it seems scarcely necessary to bestow any very particular observations.</page><page sequence="20">16 ON EDUCATION. Thus briefly and elliptically conceived, containing nothing but a mere indication of certain topics, as if touched upon in some other work, the phrases amount of themselves to nothing. The demand they present for explanation is obvious and undeniable; and in the whole body of that Creed, by not so much as a syllable in the way of explanation are they accompanied. Nothing of that sort is there in the Creed itself; as little in the Westminster or Church Catochism, into which, for the instruction of such young childien, it is engrafted. As such they add to the number of propositions or subject-matters, in relation to which, while it is impossible the children should entertain any belief concerning them, they are thus forced to stand up with all solemnity and say, " As I do believe." As to these three last-mentioned subjects, what in each instance you have, and all that you hav e, is composed of so many illusions—mere illusions. In the minds of them, whoever they were by whom this formulary or creed was penned, they had doubtless, every one- of them, a subject-matter or object, more or less determinate—every one of them accordingly a meaning. But in the minds of the yormg children—in those minds in which it is, generally speaking, impossible that the indeterminate portion of matter thus alluded to should have any place—what meaning can they, any of them, have? What but thi«, viz., that they believe in whatever is forced into their mouths, without knowing so much as who it is that put it where it is, much less what it is Again, what are the children taught to say that they have learnt in these Articles of Belief. " First, I learn to believe in God the Father, who hath made me and all the world. Secondly, in God the Son, who hath re¬ deemed me and all mankind. Thirdly, in God the Holy Ghost, who sanctifieth me and all the elect people of God." To these three things may be added three others, which, with a degree of correctness proportioned to the degree of impregnation each child has received from them, may make sure of learning, viz., first, the art of gratuitous assertion ; second, the art of speak¬ ing and writing without thinking ; and, third, the art of making groundless inferences. Then, again, as to the Catechism; are not the questions and answers downright absurdities and sheer nonsense, namely— "0,. 1 &amp; 2. What is your name?" and "Who gave you that name?" "A. My godfathers and godmothers, in my baptism; wherein I was made a member of Christ, a child of God, and an inheritor of the kingdom of heaven." Now, thousands and tens of thousands of such children are not baptized at all; and in those that are you see already the con¬ tempt of truth, pregnant with those incongruities of which that corrupt affection is so naturally productive, begins to manifest itself. "Q. 3. What did your godfathers and godmothers then for you?"</page><page sequence="21">ON EDUCATION. 17 "A. They did promise and vow three things in my name: First, that I should renounce the devil and all his works, the pomps and vanities of this wicked world, and all the sinful lusts of the flesh; secondly, that I should believe all the articles of the Christian faith; and, thirdly, that I should keep God's holy will and commandments, and walk in the same all the dnvs of my life." Here is an engagement entered into—an engagement taken in the solemn and awful form of a vow, or oath, by the sponsors— that the child shall do so-and-so; a vow made by the godfather, not that he himself, but that the godson, shall do so-and-so. The godson, in process of time, breaks the vow ; for this transgression —for this breach of a vow—of a promissory oath—for this species of perjury, who is it that is to be punished?—godfather or god¬ son? And, if punished, in what mode, and to what amount? By everlasting flames in hell, or by any other milder punishment? Again, the godfather has promised also that the godson shall re¬ nounce "the pomps and vanities of this wicked world." Aye, and they are to be renounced by every child without exception, and that with almost their earliest articulate breath. Now, under the words "pomps and vanities" are comprised all those factitious appendages by which factitious dignity—when combined with the visible and tangible fruits and marks of opulence—is, in the hands of the ruling few, employed to distinguish them from the subject many. The sovereign, in the first place; is it not by "pomp" that she is intended and enabled to display and preserve her dignity, and therewith and thereby to maintain her power The robes, the sceptre, the crown, the train of attendants, in so many forms and colours, armed and unarmed; if these be not the ele¬ ments of pomp, what others are Not to speak of lords temporal, with their titles, their coronets, and their armorial ensigns, behold the lords spiritual, with the "fine linen" on their shoulders, the "purple" on their liveries, the pin pie and the mitre on their equipages. If not of these things, of what things is "pomp" made Of all these holy per¬ sonages—these sitting and walking pageants—what one has there ever been by whom all these things have not thus been solemnly renounced all these things, to which, disguised under the name of decency, they now cling with such fond and undisguised affection ; these things, of which the very essence of their order is, according to them, composed ; and by the taking away of which the Church would, according to them, be laid in ruins, and along with it the State. Is not such theatrical piety a farce; is it either more or less than sound without sense ; is not this the comment which in the highest of high places this text receives from practice And this instruction is to be learned of every child, or person, before he, or she, be brought to be confirmed by the "bishop." By the bishop and by what bishop By the self-same bishop who, by the "pomps and vanities" by which he is surrounded, manifests the 2</page><page sequence="22">18 ON EDUCATION. contempt with which, by himself, this same instruction is re¬ garded; and-who,—at the very time when the youthful votaries whom he beholds at his feet are passing examination under his eye, under his authority, in and by the words thus forced into their mouths, made to declare the knowledge which they have of its contents, and the sentiments of veneration with which, by these same contents, they have been impregnated,—is all the while, in relation to these same contents, making manifest, if not his deliberate contempt of them, at least his ignorance or negligence. Again, " Q. 6. You said that your godfathers and godmothers did promise for you, that you should keep God's commandments. Tell me how many there be " "A. Ten." "Q. 7. Which be they?" "A. The same which God spake in the twentieth chapter of Exodus, saying, I am the Lord thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage." Upon the face of this introduction, an appearance rather unfor¬ tunate presents itself. The child in question is not a Jew ; neither he nor any of his forefathers wero ever, in the manner thus al¬ luded to, " brought out of the land of Egypt." But it is to the Jews, and to that race alone,—to those, and the progeny of those, who were thus brought out of the land of Egypt,—that these com¬ mandments are any where in the Bible represented as having been delivered. Again, in the second commandment, it says, " Thou shalt not make to thyself any graven image, nor the likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or in the earth beneath, or in the waters under the earth. Thou shalt not bow down to them, nor worship them" (Exod. xxii. 4), and other repeated denunciations of idolatry. Yet Moses was commanded to "make two cherubims of gold" (xxv. 18). Also, "The Lord said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, -and set it upon a pole, and it shall come to pass that every one that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live " (Num. xxi. 8); a direct act of idolatry commanded by God himself. And again, upon the face of this commandment, there are two branches of art and science stand condemned and prohibited, viz., the graphic art in all its various modifications, and the science of natural history—two -branches of art and science ; to which may be added sculpture and painting; all very much honoured, prac¬ tised, and cultivated. And then, again, where are "the waters under the earth " As to the Sacraments and their cannibalistic virtues and efficacy, the reader will find them fully explained in my " Religious Medi¬ tations," at p. 105. Secondly, as to the Nicene Creed; it takes its name from Nice, a city and seaport in France, where a few illiterate men held a meeting to draw it up, a.d. 825, and disputed very seriously, and sometimes fiercely, about how many persons should form the God¬ head—one or three.</page><page sequence="23">ON EDUCATION. 19 Thirdly, as to the Athanasian Creed ; it was published in a.d. 405, by Athanasius, its author, and it would be as well to inform you of the true character of the man. He was a young, forward, petulant deacon, in the Church of Alexandria, of an ambitious spirit, with a talent fitted for disputation. And as he could have no hopes of getting into that bishopric unless he could drive Arius out of Alexandria, who was the principal presbyter in that Church, next to the bishop, this he effected by fomenting a dispute about the Trinity, between Arius and the bishop; on which account, having got Arius excommunicated, he had him then banished out of Alexandria. Which, when done, no sooner was the old bishop Alexander dead, but Athanasius, though then only a young man of about twenty-seven years of age, by the assistance of a set of murdering ascetics, forced himself at once into that high arch- "bishopric, without ever passing through any of the intermediate degrees. And having gotten himself illegally consecrated, con¬ trary to all the rules and canons of the Church, he prevailed on the Emperor Constantino to confirm him therein, by the power of "bribes that were given to one of the emperor's favourites. And no sooner was he thoroughly established in it, but he immediately flew in the emperor's face; and when the Emperor Constantino the Great was dead, treated his son and successor, Constantius. with more contempt and insolence than could have been borne from an equal. And when he was dispossessed of his bishopric for other irregularities, by a numerous council of bishops regularly sum¬ moned and assembled, he forced his way into that see again, more than once or twice, over the murdered corpses of his antagonists, and waded into his cathedral through seas of blood. But it may, perhaps, be further asked, why should this recommend him to the see of Rome The reason of which is, because this was all done "by the connivance and with the concurrence of that see. Athana¬ sius, while he treated all the rest of mankind, and even his own royal master, with the utmost insolence, having paid a servile court to th e papal chair; insomuch, that in the books of the canon law, the first precedent that is or can be produced in support of the papal supremacy, is this instance of the servile submission that was paid by Athanasius to Pope Julius. The best purpose to which such a document could be applied, would be to transform it into " A Matrimonial Creed," viz.— " Whoever will be Marriod, before all things it is necessary that he hold the Conjugal Faith, which faith is this, That there were two rational beings created, both equal, and yet one superior to the other; and the inferior shall bear rule over the superior: which faith, except evory one do keep whole and undefiled, without doubt he shall be scolded at everlastingly. " The Man is superior to the Woman, and the Woman is inferior to the Man; yet both are equal, and the Woman shall govern the Man. "The Woman is commanded to obey tho Man, and tho Man ought to obey the Woman. 2—2</page><page sequence="24">20 _ ON EDUCATION. " And yet they are not two obedients, but oue obedient. " For there is one dominion nominal of the Husband, and another dominion real of the Wife ; " And yet there are not two dominions, but one dominion. " For, like as we are compelled by the Christian verity to acknowledge that Wives must submit themselves to their Hus¬ bands, and be subject to them in all things : " So are we forbidden by the Conjugal Faith to say, that they should be at all influenced by their wills, or pay any regard to their commands. " The Man was not created for the Woman, but the Woman for the Man " Yet the Man shall be the slave of the Woman, and the Woman, the tyrant of the Man : "So that in all things, as is aforesaid, the subjection of the superior to the inferior is to be believed. " He, therefore, that will be Married, must thus think of the Woman and the Man. " Furthermore, it is necessary to submissive Matrimony, that he also believe in the infallibility of the Wife. "For the right faith is, that we believe and confess that the Wife is fallible and infallible : " Perfectly falliblo, and perfectly infallible; of an erring soul, and unerring mind subsisting: fallible as touching her human nature, and infallible as touching her female sex. " Who, although she be fallible and infallible, yet she is not two, but one Woman: ' who submitted to lawf id Matrimony, to acquire unlawful dominion : promised religiously to obey, that she might rule the more absolutely. " This is the Conjugal Faith ; which, except a man believe faith¬ fully, he cannot enter the state of Matrimony." Fourthly, as to the Catholic Creed; it was first publised in a.d. 156 i, under the name of Pope Pius's Creed. Now, it appears to me the day is not far distant when we shall have "free thought" and "free trade " in religions, creeds, prayers, and labour, as we have in corn, commerce, and manufactures. " Does any one believe the present relations between Capital and Labour can endure They will endure just as long as the labourer is imbruted, and does not know his own worth. " Think what Capital is. It is smews and nerves in metallic forms; it is accumulated head-aches and heart-aches of drudges, labourers, and servants ; it is a catacomb of human bones. Your pound sterling represents so much labour—that is its only value. " Think what labour is. It is the one thing valuable ; without it your bread is field-dust; your butter, grass. Take it away from your ship, and lo you are a savage swimming on a log; from your fine dwelling, and you burrow like a mole for every stone in it. " So long as Labour holds in unconsciousness the keys of the gateways to all good, it will be cheated as were the Red Indians,</page><page sequence="25">ON EDUCATION. 21 "who were easily enticed to sell states for glass-beads. But, re¬ member, the poor school and the penny press have not been so unproductive as some suspect. " In the Laws of Menu it is written, ' Justice, being destroyed, will destroy; being preserved, will preserve : it must, therefore, never be violated.' The Hebrew prophet cried, ' I will come near to you in judgment: I will be a swift witness against those that oppress the hireling in his wages.' The queen hears that three persons have been starved to death in one week, and writes to her minister that she feels that thereby her reign has been sullied." But, to resume, " Let us imagine, for a moment, an England which has never heard of the Bible or of Christianity. A traveller comes from some distant land, and describes the religious creeds, or beliefs, of its inhabitants. He represents them as maintaining that, many centuries ago, Almighty God came down out of heaven and was born as a human iniant; that the reason for his doing so was, that the human race had sprung from a man and woman who, by eating an apple he had forbidden them to eat, had brought down a curse upon the whole world, under which every human being is, to the end of time, born utterly depraved, and, unless his, or her, nature be miraculously changed, must burn in everlasting fire alter death. The Creator, unable to mitigate this penalty accruing to mankind for the misdeed of their first parents, was, nevertheless, moved with pity for humanity thus going on to endless torments, and conceived a scheme for saving them. That scheme was to be himself born on earth, a member of the accursed human family; to prove himself to be God by working wonders which no mortal could work; to take upon himself the sins and curse of the earth and of all its inhabitants ; to suffer himself all the pains and penalties which had awaited the whole race of men ; and, having thus satisfied the unalterable law, to offer man¬ kind, as the conditions of their salvation, that each one who should, by faith in this plan, believe that his sins, which deserved eternal torture by fire, had been already suffered for,—who should pray to have the divine suffering vicariously imputed to his parti¬ cular case, and also glorify God sufficiently for so acting,—should "be granted a free pardon for the ancestral sin; while all those who should not personally fulfil these conditions should proceed as before, into eternal misery, as the just punishment for the eating of the forbidden apple by the first human pair, whatever might be their own moral character. " What would be the comments of the supposed unchristianised England upon such a narrative as this? and what would be its inferences concerning the government, customs, and physical fea¬ tures of the country in which such a religion prevailed Not in a fruitful and pleasant land, we should say, could such beliefs spring up, but amid rock and desert, whore nature seemed resting under a curse. It is the faith, v; e should say, of a people who Tegard all human suffering, disease, and death, as evidences of divine anger; who, being without science, regard all unusual</page><page sequence="26">22 ON EDUCATION. phenomena as expressions of an arbitrary power, and would thus look for miracles to attend any revelation from their deity. They would conceive of the deity as like unto themselves,—likely, therefore, to be born of woman. They must imagine their god something like their barbaric king, whose mere word was law; disobedience to which, because of his grandeur, would make a heinous crime out of a piccadillo, such as the eating of a pro¬ hibited apple. They would believe in certain infernal powers whose business it is to keep a furnace of fire always burning for the punishment of offenders against the majesty of this more powerful king, which would also suggest that this tribe dwelt in a disagreeably-hot climate. They would believe that their deity, like their monarch, could only be approached on bended knees, and that he is fond of flattery and glorification. It would be no anomaly in their government that one man should be punished for the crime of another. But what should we say—-assuming as yet that there is no authority for the creed described'—did we learn that the people who built great temples and maintained a vast priesthood in devotion to those beliefs were dwelling in a country and amid goneral ideas and customs the reverte of those inferred —that they inhabited a green and beautiful land, while believing all nature to be under the blighting curse of God; that when ill they call in a physician, though believing disease and death to be visitations of the divine will; that they will imprison as an im¬ postor one who professes to work miracles, and would not permit the testimony to a miracle of a thousand witnesses to determine the distribution to an estate, while they maintain that one in the form of a man did, within historic times, repeatedly raise the dead to life and violate the order of nature ; that they would unseat a judge who should order the death-penalty for the worst theft, while worshipping a God who punishes millions with eternal tor¬ tures for ail apple eaten thousands of years before they were born ; that, -fifth courts of law in which no man can be prosecuted for the sin of another, they believe that all men merit, and many receive, endless agonies at the hands of God for an offence they never committed, and that the only exculpation for any is derived from the tortures of an innocent person in thoir place; that they would despise an earthly sovereign who should be fond of adula¬ tion, and would regard the glorification of such an one to obtain favours as disgusting sycophancy, while they believe that their God can be pacified and coaxed by such appeals to his vanity, and teach every child that the chief end of man is to glorify God and enjoy him for ever ; that, with a language which calls various crimes inhuman, unnatural, unmanly, they proclaim their belief that humanity is desperately wicked, and the natural man a child of the devil; that, while thus believing human nature totally depraved, thoir politicians seek popular favour by promising to do right instead of wrong, and their tradesmen trust daily to the com¬ mon integrity ; and, lastly, that these people believing that millions of those around them—including some of their own children, parents,</page><page sequence="27">ON EDUCATION. 23 relatives, and intimate friends—-are in imminent danger of suffer¬ ing all the intensified agonies that the wrath of God can inflict, and that vast numbers are now so suffering, or doomed to suffer, do, nevertheless, go quietly about their business, enjoy themselves in society, and in every way act as if all were going on pleasantly. This people, I should say, have somehow got dressed in a religion that does not belong to them—a borrowed religion, transferred from some desolate land and barbarian age, which, contradicted as it is, point for point, by its whole environment, is essentially in¬ credible to those professing it—a creed which could exist amid such conditions only as the flowers of the Tropics exist in an English garden, that is, by the help of an artificial habitat." Now, I would humbly ask, how much wiser and better would it "be to train up such children in the path of progress, to instruct them in the knowledge of every-day life, to lead them to study nature and nature's laws, and the moral virtues, to guide them to science and the starry heavens, to learn them the great, grand, and fundamental truths of providence, and the sublime manner in which the Great Creator vouchsafes to us these noble gifts, day by day and every day of our lifes, instead of cramming their infant minds with such antiquated and obsolete fables as the foregoing, and other wicked and obscene tales of Cain, Larnech, Noah, Han;, Abraham, Lot, Hagar, Sarai, Lot's wife and daughters, Ishmael, Isaac, Rebecca, Jacob, Esau, Laban, Rachel, Dinah, Simeon, Levi, Eeuben, Er, Oran, Tamar, Judah, Potiphar's wife, Moses, Aaron, Rahab, Jael, Samson, Jephthah, Saul, Saul's witch, Ruth, Boaz, Solomon, David, Hophni, Phineas, and Hosea, all of whom, if they now lived in England in this our day, our laws would punish severely, for such crimes as they then committed, and yet, strange to say, these young children are taught by our schoolmasters, clergymen, bishop's, and archbishops, to believe that one of the aforesaid was "the man after God's own heart," another "the wisest man that ever lived," and a third "'the meekest man that ever was born," and the majority of the others, as patriarchs, priests, prophets, and wise men ; while, at the same time, it can "be proved out of the samo book, by any intelligent mind gifted with sense and reckon, and divested of prejudice and dogma, that they were the biggest set of scoundrels and villains that ever lived. Then, ag-un, storing- such children's memories at that early age with such old Arabian tales and legends—of God's forming man of dust from the ground—breathing into the dusty nostrils to ..make the image live—of his planting a garden—of his taking this newly-formed man of dust, whom he called Adam (or "dusty"), and leaving him in the garden—reasoning within himself,—bring¬ ing the birds and beasts to dusty Adam, desiring to see what he -would call them—taking out one of the newly-formed Adam's ribs —closing up the flesh again—making the rib into a woman— "bringing the woman unto the man—walking in tho breeze of the day—making a sound as he walks—missing the man and calling</page><page sequence="28">mmmmmmmmmm 24 ON EDUCATION. for him—questioning him as to what he had done—making coats of skins—clothing the man and woman—grudging the man being like himself—.refusing to let him eat of the tree of life—driving the man and woman out of the garden—taking precaution to pre¬ vent their return to it—showing respect to Abel, and not to Cain —expostulating with Cain—questioning Cain—setting a mark on Cain—repenting and being grieved at his heart—shutting up the ark after Noah—.smelling a sweet savour—coming down to see the city and tower of Babel—eating bread and meat—rebuking Sarah's laughter—expostulating with Sarah—going down to see how mat¬ ters were in Sodom—allowing Abraham to expostulate with Him —going his way—tempting Abraham, and talking and communing with him. Now, how much more judicious and rational would it be to teach them first, the language of their country, its laws, manners, and customs, good behaviour, the social and moral virtues, a know¬ ledge of the starry heavens; and secondly, that this world they have just entered into is a star, or planet, placed in the infinite regions of space, composed of mould and water, and suspended in the air by the invisible agency of the Great Creator, amidst mil¬ lions, billions, and trillions of other worlds ; for only in that small streak of light called the Milky Way, and which may be seen by such children every clear night, more than 18,000,000 of such worlds have been counted by the aid of magnifying glasses, or telescopes. Thirdly, the formation of man, with his 248 bones, 500 muscles, 1000 arteries, 30 lbs. of blood, and a heart only 5 in. in length and 3 in. in diameter, which boats 70 times in a minute, 4200 per hour, 100,800 per day, and 36,722,200 times per year, and at each beat a little over two ounces of blood is thrown out of it, and each day it receives and discharges about seven tons of that wonderful fluid; his lungs will contain a gallon of air, and he inhales 24,000 gallons per day; the aggregate surface of the air- cells of his lungs, supposing them to be spread out, exceeds 20,000 square inches ; his nerves exceod 10,000,000 in number ; his skin is composed of three layers, about one-eigth of an inch in thick¬ ness ; the area of his skin is about 1700 square inches ; each square inch contains 8500 sweating tubes, or pores, each of which may be likened to a little drain-tile, one-eighth of an inch long, making an aggregate length of the entire surface of his body of 100,583 feet, or a tile-drain for draining his body 20 miles long. And that every human being, animal, bird, beast, fish, insect, tree, shrub, &amp;c, and all things which grow, move, or live thereon, are the natural mould or earth of this planet or star. And after each have lived their respective series of years, destined by their Creator that they should exist thereon, they then return to the same mould or earth again, to enrich it, and make more fuel and food for future generations, thus, to use an old adage, " it muck its own chaps ;" and thus it will continue to do while it exists, just in the same way as man does while he lives on it; for he comes into the world naked, and he returns to it naked; and the air which encircles the</page><page sequence="29">ON EDUCATION. 25 outside of the world, or in which it is suspended as aforesaid, sup¬ ports it, as it does also every thing thereon; for without it we could not live, nor the fruits of the earth be supported. The.i, again, the earth is not only a self-supporting body, but it is also attractive, and has the power of drawing every thing that comes out of it, again to its surface, so that man walks feet to feet to his fellow man at the antipodes, in the same manner as flies, spiders, and other insects walk on the ceilings of rooms ; or again, as the loadstone attracts steel and other metals; and as birds of prey, reptiles, and other animals, attract much swifter animals, and cause them to stay to be devoured by them ; and so attractive is it, that man cannot live far from its surface, either in the air above it, or in the waters beneath it; for if conveyed thither in either balloons or diving-bells, he is soon glad to return to it again, as he could not exist or live in either. And lastly, so attractive is it, that it draws man to death to enter its bowels, even against his wish and inclination, as few of us wish to die; exactly in the same way and manner as the serpent draws animals and birds to enter its bowels against their wish, as I have heard them make a terrible noise in endeavouring to escape from such attraction ; for, like man, they do not appear tired of life. Now, surely it would be much better to teach such children such truths as the foregoing, which occur to our view in every¬ day life, and thousands of similar ones, which science has unfolded to us, than such antiquated and obsolete tales which are without any proof, and which does not at all interest them, and only serve to frighten and terrify them, such as the "resurrection" tale and others. Now, science will disclose to them that the number of human beings living at the end of the hundredth generation only, com¬ mencing from a single pair, and doubling at each generation, say in thirty years, and allowing for each man, woman, and child, an average space of four feet in heighth, and one foot square, would form a vertical column, having for its base the whole surface of the earth and sea spread out into a plain, and for its height 3764 time's the sun's distance from the earth. The number of human beings thus piled one on the other, would amount to 460,790,000 000,000 (see Sir John Herschel on Atoms, vol. i. p. 83); conse¬ quently, how many persons will there be at the end of the thou¬ sandth generation, and where are they all to stand or be placed Now, how much wiser and better would it be to teach such young children a common sense view of things, and to teach them a Creed, or formula, composed in accordance with the civilization of the period,—the spirit of the age,—the aids of science, reason, and common sense, and the march of progress; than in teaching them from an old worn out, fixed, and prescribed form of a superstitious and illiterate by-gone age. I herewith humbly submit, for approval, such Creed, Prayer, Commandments, and Acts, as are suitable for all sorts and conditions of men of every nation inhabiting the earth, and which every, person can understand. They are as follow ;—</page><page sequence="30">26 ON EDUCATION. CREED. " I believe in One Self-existing, Intellectual, Eternal and Infinite God; All-Good and All-Wise, Omniscient, Omnipotent, and Omni¬ present ; the Supreme, Originator, Creator, Preserver, and Governor of all things; I believe in the solemn mystery of Life, and the no less tremendous mjsteiy of Death; I believe that God can give or take away Life; or can form, trans-foim, and oiganize, and give or deny Intellect and Life to any Being or Creature formed by Him; and I believe the Infinite Universe is governed by Laws conceived and made by Him, in their nature perfect and that such Laws were made with this Planetary Earth on which we are now, and with its inhabitants, for the spiritual, physical, and moral govern¬ ment thereof, so long as they endure; and lhat such Laws have always continued, and are now uncharged, and never will change ; I believe that all Life proceeds from God, and that every Soul of Man is a Life with Intellect, Conscience, Passions, and Free-Will incarnated in Man; I believe Life prevents the body from decaying, and therefore Life is a superior Power to Matter, and must proceed from the Infinite Life of God ; I believe Death is an Act of God, by which he takes Life from Matter, and I believe Death, like other apparent Evils, is necessary to cany out the purposes and intentions of the Great Creator of the Universe; I believe God has caused every Soul of Man to be born with a Conscience for Right and for Wrong, and that God permits Man, for that purpose, whilst Man lives, to do Right or to do Wrong, as he pleases, in accordance with the conditions in which each Soul is placed; I believe in the efficacy on Man's Soul of Spiritual Prayer to God, and in his Forgiveness of wrong deeds to the contrite Soul of Man; I believe that whilst on this Earth, the Human Race always has been, is, and will be, in a state of Probation ; I believe God has neither Form nor Substance, and consequently not fashioned in the shape of Man, but may be heard, felt, and known, like his invisible Agents—Wind and Air; "but they cannot be seen, only through the Causes and Effects pro¬ duced by the said Triune in this our Earthly Atmosphere of Ether and Electricity; I believe Heaven to be a state or possession of Mind and Sentiment, and not a Kingdom or Locality; I believe in the progress of Mankind, and in the perfectibility of the Human Race; I believe also, in the Sublime Idea of Eternal Progress : I believe in the perpetual improvement of everything, whether that thing is natural or spiritual, scientific or religious ; I believe in the law of Eternal developement as my guide to duty and action; for when I see a germ I know it contains an undeveloped flower; when I see a child I know it contains the qualities and essences of an un¬ developed Man: I believe in the Creator's Laws, because I find it easy and natural to obey them; and I revere the living Mind of Universal Nature—the Vitalizing Spirit of all existencies I believe I ought to combine within myself the qualities of the Patriot, or the Love of Life and Country.—the Poet, or the Love of singing the beauties of Nature—the Philosopher, or the Love of Reason-</page><page sequence="31">ON EDUCATION. 27 ing—and the Theologian, or the Love of Divinity ; I believe I ought to comprehend, by the exercise of my intuition and reason, tho Truths of Science as revealed by Progress, and the course of Nature; I believe that Science and Progress disclose to the Human Intellect laws so perfect, and so adorable both in their conception and operation, as to lead to the conviction that the Originator of those Laws must be a Being of Infinite Goodness, Wisdom, and Power; and I believe my mission to be determined by the measure of my inward capacity to understand and obey those Laws, and my usefulness to the world by the real consistency of my words and actions arising therefrom ; and I believe that the Age in which I live has a sure and certain test by which to ascertain the genuine¬ ness and stability of any individual who comes forth, or is born in it; and lastly, I believe that man to be a True and Perfect Man whose Temple is the Experience and Wisdom of every Age and Nation; whose Book is Nature ; whose Master is Reason ; whose Law is Love ; whose Religion is Justice ; whose Light is Truth; wlnse Structure is Association ; whose Path is Progression ; whose Works are Development; whose Home is Heaven; whose Heaven is Har¬ mony ; and whose God is the Universal Father. Amen." PRAYER. " Our Father who art and art Infinite, Hallowed be thy Name ; May it please Thee to infuse Thy Divine Essence within us, may it penetrate, enlighten, and exalt our Souls; May we, at all times, Thy grace assisting us, exercise our Free-Will rightly, so that after death our Souls may be found porfeoted before Thee, and may receive the Eternal Benediction of Thee, our Creator and Preserver. Amen." TEN COMMANDMENTS. " 1. Thou shalt search for truth in every department of being; test, prove, and try if what thou deemest is truth, and then accept it as the Word of God. "2. Thou shalt continue the search for truth all thy life, and never cease to test, prove, and try all that thou deemest to be truth. " 3. Thou shalt search by every attainable means for the laws that underlie all life and being ; thou shall strive to comprehend these laws, live in harmony with them, and make them the laws of thine own life, thy rule and guide in all thine actions. " 4. Thou shalt not follow the example of any man, or set of men, nor obey any teaching or accept of any theory as thy rule of life, that is not in strict accordance with thy highest sense of right. " 5. Thou shalt remember that a wrong done to the least of thy fellow-creatures is a wrong done to all; and thou shalt never commit a wrong wilfully and consciously to any of thy fellow- creatures, nor connive at wrong done by others, without striving to prevent or protesting against it. " 6. Thou shalt acknowledge all men's rights to do, think, or</page><page sequence="32">23 ON EDUCATION. speak, to be exactly equal to thine own; and all rights whatsoever that thou dost demand, thou shalt ever accord to others. " 7. Thou shalt not hold thyself bound to love or associate with those that are distasteful or repulsive to thee; but thou shalt be held bound to treat such objects of dislike with gentleness, courtesy, and justice. " 8. Thou shalt ever regard the rights, interests, and welfare of the many as superior to those of the one or the few ; and in cases where thy welfare is to be balanced against that of society, thou shalt sacrifice thyself to the welfare of society. "9. Thou shall be obedient to the laws of the land in which thou dost reside, in all things which do not conflict with thy highest sense of right. "10. Thy first and last duty upon earth, and all through thy life, is to get Wisdom, to get Understanding, to get Knowledge, for remember Knowledge is Power. Know thyself. Be the simple-minded devotee of Nature's laws. Have a good and "benevolent Reason for every thing you do. Never act from a narrow, selfish impulse. Be loving and tender hearted. Always remember that happiness depends upon physical and mental tranquillity.—upon individual and social harmony. Never do wrong, but seek for the principles of right, and live them out to the utmost of thy power; and whatever creed, precept, or example conflicts with those principles, thou shalt shun and reject, ever remember¬ ing that the laws of right are in morals, Justice ; in science, Harmony ; in religion, the Fatherhood op God, and the Brotherhood oe Man." ACTS OF APOSTLES. "1. To practise Temperance in all things, whether physical* mental, moral, affeetional, or religious. "2. To practise Justice to all creatures that be; justice being the exercise of precisely the same rules of life, conduct, thought, or speech, that you would desire to receive from others. "3. To practise Gentleness in speech and act, never needlessly wounding the feelings of others by harsh words or deeds, but, as far as is possible, live peaceably with all men. " 4. To practise Truth in every word or thought spoken or acted. "5. To practise Charity—charity in thought, striving to excuse the natural failings in others; charity in deeds, wherever, when¬ ever, and to whomsoever the opportunity offers. "6. To practise Almsgiving, visiting the sick, and comforting the afflicted in every shape that our means admit of, and the necessities of our fellow-creatures demand. " 7. To practise Sele-sacrieice wherever the interest of others are to be benefitted by our endurance. "8. To practise Temperate yet jtrm Defences of Right Views, and strong protests against wrong, never forgetting that right is</page><page sequence="33">ON EDUCATION. 20 stronger than might, according to the progressive laws of nature's unchangeable God. " 9. To practise Industry in following any calling we may be engaged in, or in devoting some portion of our time, when other¬ wise not obliged to do so, to the service and benefit of others. " 10. To practise Love, the very essence of the life of the body and mind ; seek to cultivate it in your own families and amongst all mankind generally, as far as possible; yea, the spirit of that true and tender love which can think, speak, and act no wrong to any creature living; remembering always, that where love is, all the other principles of right are fulfilled beneath its influence, and embodied in its monitions." Now, in a kingdom like ours, where our population—or, to use a Christian phrase—"our brethren" are to be found in every quarter of the world, and in every nation under the sun, would not a repetition of the foregoing tend to spread universal love amongst all peoples, nations, and languages, throughout all the earth, if children were taught such at an early age. But instead of such universal love being taught and practised among us, are we not split into numerous sects, and the children of each secta¬ rian educated and brought up as pupils or sectators of their parents' creeds. Whatever God is in Himself, whatever be the mode of His own. existence, we have no possibility of discovering, except through the reflections of our nature. All our knowledge of Him must be limited to our own actual experience as men. Whatever lies beyond that is only in the region of pure fancy, and its truth or falsehood cannot be proved. The Bible itself, however true, noble, and divine a revelation of God it may unfold, does not and cannot surpass these limits. The very best which it says of God is still only a reflection of the best thoughts and aspirations of men ; not on that account less true or less inspired by God; but we do not admit that it contains anything that transcends human thoughts and human understanding. As to revelation and in¬ spiration, you must bear in mind that revelation should open and enlighten our judgment; whilst inspiration should excite, vivify, and warm our spirits to action. It appears many persons were inspired who had not common sense. In fact, those who appear to have been highly inspired were very unwise in their externals. It appears that many Christians in this our day conceive the kingdom of heaven to be a perpetual singing school—a long pro¬ tracted Methodist meeting—continuing years and centuries, during which time their departed spirits adore God with hymns of praise, gratitude, and thanksgiving ; in this manner occupying their time throughout the infinite periods of eternity! And this is the orthodox Christian's conception of heaven Human nature must be entirely changed at death to make it possible to realize such a conception. Nay; it is a philosophic, scientific, phrenological, affeetional, logical, spiritual, and religious absurdity. It appears the very foundations of all beliefs or creeds is that</page><page sequence="34">VO ON EDUCATION. there is but one living and true God, everlasting, without body, parts, or passions; of infinite power, wisdom, and goodness ; the maker and preserver of all things, visible and invisible." One- cannot even repeat these words without a sense of mingled awe and delight—without emotions of the deepest reverence. Every word tells; it is perfectly intelligible throughout; and, so far as man is at all able to predicate anything truly of the mysterious Being of God, these words accord entirely with his reason, his conscience, and his heart. The same doctrine we find repeated, in briefer form, at the very beginning of the "Apostles' Creed," " I believe in God, the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth;" the word "God" being, in this creed, applied only to the Father. In the Nieene Creed the opening clause is nearly the same ; only it is intensified by the addition of the word " one " before " God." " I believe in one God, the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth, and of all things, visible and in¬ visible." One can only understand from the foregoing that theie is absolutely only one true God, without a body, without any earjacity for human suffering, perfectly undivided and indivisible, and that this one true God is the Father Almighty. Then, again, as to the Athanasian Creed, all its statements are intelligible, each by itself, except those which attempt to do in words what cannot be done by the intellect. No one professes to understand or explain this passage, " That we worship one God in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity, neither confounding the Persons nor dividing the substance." Or this, "In all things the Unity in Trinity and the Trinity in Unity is to be worshipped;" t\ liile overy one can understand this, "Yetthoyare not three Gods, but one God." These doctrines must take one of two shapes in the human mind; either that tho three Persons are three parts or divisions of one substance called " Godhead,"—which contradicts all religion, which says that there is but one true God, without parts, i.e. indi¬ visible ;—or that there are three God's all alike, which contradicts it also, and contradicts, at the same time, the Nicene and Arjostles' Creeds. On the other hand, if the human mind apprehends and believes that there is only one living and true God, indivisible, it cannot, at the same time, believe in three somethings, each of which is declared to be by himself Lord and God. It may be intelligible by itself, just as a man might say, " Here are three things all made of one substance, all equal in strength, and all made at one time, and are distinguished from each by the names A, B, C." To say this of three iron bars, or three bricks, would be to say something grammatically analogous to the passage in question. But there is a difficulty to the human intellect in the names given, " Father, Son, and Holy Ghost," which cannot easily be overcome. The three somethings are all equal in eternity, i.e. in length of life; and yet two of them are designated by relative terms which, to the human reason, imply that one is older than the other ; the one a cause, and the other the effect of that cause. It may be said that these names do not carry doctrines so much as</page><page sequence="35">ON EDUCATION. 31 the other statement—" of one substance, power, and eternity "— does; but it leaves us still perplexed. It is quite certain that in all creeds mention is made that there is absolutely only one living and true God; and that He has no parts, and cannot be divided into three or any number of Beings. Reason ought and must bo our judge, for, as Jaremy Taylor says, " we being the persons that are to be persuaded, we must see that we be persuaded reason¬ ably." And Bishop Ohillingworth declares, " For my part, I am certain that God hath given us our reason to discern between truth and falsehood; and he that makes not this use of it, but believes things he knows not why, I say it is by chance that he believes the truth, and not by choice; and I cannot but fear that God will not accept the sacrifice of fools." Dean Prideaux says, "Let what is written in all the books of the New Testament be tried by that which is the touchstone of all religions. I mean that religion of nature that God has written in the hearts of every one of us, from the first creation; and if it varies from it in any one particular, if it prescribes any one thing which may in the minutest circumstance thereof be contrary to its righteousness, I will then acknowledge this to be an argument against us, strong enough to overthrow the whole cause, and make all things else that can be said for it, totally ineffectual for its support." As to the Creeds, Bishop Watson says with great incisiveness, " I cer¬ tainly dislike the imposition of all creeds by human authority; though I do not dislike them as useful summaries of what their compilers believe to be true, either in natural or revealed religion. As to revealed religion, though all its doctorins are expressed in one book, yet such a diversity of interpretations have been given to the same passages of Scripture, that not only individuals, but whole churches, have formed to themselves different creeds, and introduced them into their forms of Worship — the Apostles', Nicene, Athanasian, Catholic, and other creeds, which might be mentioned, are all of human fabrication. They oblige conscience as far as they are conformable to Scripture, and of that conformity every man must judge for himself," Archbishop Tillotson says, " The account given of Athanasius's Creed appears to me nowise satisfactory. I wish we were well rid of it." The Dean of West¬ minster says, " The elaborate anathemas which were once ap¬ pended to the Nicene Creed, even the fierce denunciations which are the very bone and marrow of the Athanasian Creed, are, indeed, interesting only as the dreary records of a sulphureous flame, which has long ceased, to burn in the better heart of Christendom." Dean Stanley says, " There is poetic fire in the vitals ; there are elements of strophe and anti-strophe, chorus and countor-chorus; but in that case we must forego its claims to be considered as a rigid rule of faith, a literal and formal statement of dogmatic propositions* which appear like tho designed statement of an inextricabla enigma. It is a Creed without authority, constantly and necessarily misunderstood, and involving the Church in endless anomalies and contradictions." It is unquestionable, therefore, that with all</page><page sequence="36">32 ON EDUCATION. the advantages which this Creed may possess, it has been a burden and a scandal, far beyond any use which even its most devoted admires may have claimed for it. Now, if the Creeds are so vague and unsatisfactory, and one of them condemned by clergymen of all ranks; on what principle, I ask, could the House of Lords condemn the Vicar of Healaugh If the Archbishop of Canter¬ bury, and his predecessor Archbishop Tillotson, the Bishop of St. David's, the Dean of Westminster, Dean Stanley, and very many others, may thus speak of such documents, and yet continue loyal Members and Ministers of the Church of England, why should he (the Vicar) be deprived of his living, if he calls into question certain statements contained therein There are thou¬ sands, aye, millions, who think as the Vicar thinks :— " 1. That revelation of the knowledge of God by means of any "book is impossible. " 2. That all true knowlege of God comes directly from the law of God, written in men's hearts. "3. That all knowledge of God comes only from men's own sense of what He requires them to do. " 4. That the only true revelation possible by God to man is through the senpe of God's presence. "5. And is originated in the heart of man independently of God's written word. " 6. That mankind are not, by nature, born in sin. " 7. That mankind are not, by nature, the children of God's wrath. " 8. That mankind are not sepaiated from God by sin. " 9. That mankind aie not under God's wrath. " 10. That mankind are not under a curse. "11. That mankind are not in danger of endless suffering. " 12. That there is no cuise to remove by the shedding of any¬ one's blood." We need not hesitate at the repetition of any creed which makes us say, as its first words, " I believe in one God, the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth, and of all things, visible and invisible." Now, as to the creation of man, we know of no other creation only by birth.—and that is the only kind of creation we have ever seen, and from this kind of creation we have never seen a new species—save and except in the Jewish history of Christ's birth, which represents Him as a born God; and then, again, from Him and His Father, or two males, and not from a woman, emanate a third God, neither man nor woman, called the Holy Ghost; and- a great part of mankind actually repeat every Sunday, in their creeds or beliefs, that there are these three spe¬ cies of Gods, although there is only one of men It appears this learned divine believes, as very many others believe ; namely :•— " 1. That the worship of Christ is idolatry. ' " 2. That the worship of Christ is inconsistent with the worship of the true God.</page><page sequence="37">ON EDUCATION. 33 "3. That the worship of Christ is an instance of holding up our hands to a strange God. " 4. That the worship of Christ outrivals the worship of the one true God. "5. That the worship of Christ draws away our highest homage and affection from God to another. " 6. The very idea of incarnation itself implies a belief that God does not, nor ever did, dwell in the hearts of all men. "7. That the expected return of Christ to judge the world is calculated to overthrow the moral government of God. " 8. That such expectation is unreasonable. "9. That such expectation is opposed to the simplicity of the love of God as a Father. " 10. The notion of God coming to dwell amongst men in human form, after thousands of years' absence from them, then departing, after a short life on earth, and not returning for thou¬ sands of years more, turns entirely upon the belief in an absent God. "11. That the worship of the Son and Holy Ghost is idolatry. "12. That the belief in the Godhead of the Son and of the Holy Ghost, as expressed in the Nicene Creed, weakens and dis¬ guises the belief in one God the Father Almighty." Now, there are archbishops, bishops, rectors, vicars, curates, schoolmasters, and thousands and tens of thousands of the laity think thus; and I would ask, why should the children of such parents be compelled to attend a school where contrary creeds, prin¬ ciples, opinions, tenets, and doctrines are taught Again, listen to this, mothers! Such teachers as the foregoing are bound to teach in such schools the Church Catechism and its doctrines, and to give instructions to you, that unless each of your children are "baptized, confirmed, regenerated, and converted (mind you, at that early age), they will be cast, at death, into a pit, or lake, of fire and brimstone, and there remain to be fried and grilled alive to all eternity! Now, then, I ask, is any parent, holding such views of eternal punishment, justified in begetting or bringing a child into the world Why, such an act becomes a monstrous crime, perpetrated for the gratification of one's own selfishness and lust. If we were to witness the ruin, not of one kingdom or continent, but the slow and agonising death of all the rational and irrational creatures throughout all the suns and satellites of the wide universe, our hearts would burst, we should perish at the sight. Yet this universal havoc would be but as a drop in the ocean compared with the anguish of one single individual in an eternity of woe. Were those who talk so glibly of hell-fire and of every little sin deserving an infinite punishment, but for once to picture to their minds the horrible character of their doctrine, they would either cast it from them with disgust, or sink under it with madness. What, then, are we to think of those men who amuse themselves with it as if it were a pyrotechnic display at the Crystal Palace, and who roll under their tongues with an 3</page><page sequence="38">34 ON EDUCATION. unctious relish, words that, if uttered sincerely, would blanch their cheeks like marble and turn their blood into ice I have been called a " Sceptic," and many time-serving journal¬ ists and writers have ridiculed, scoffed, and. abused me ; but such authors have never considered the profound significance of that word " Sceptic." I will give you the meaning of it, so well and ably explained by an eminent Unitarian clergyman. He says, "the word means 'to consider;' it signifies, strictly, to shade the eyes for better vision." A sceptic, then, is one who shades his eyes in order to look steadfastly at a thing. He will shade his eyes of all but the light necessary for seeing, will protect himself from garish public opinion, will dismiss prejudice and self-interest, and steadily examine each thing that claims his acquiescence.- There are many words of a similar character, which you may be accustomed to pronounce only as if you touched a serpent, which, however, have their fair origin. What is a " Latitudinarian" but one whose views have breadth What is a " Freethinker " but one who refuses to think as a slave And what is the "Sceptic" but one who is resolved to choose the faith he will hold, instead of employing a parson to do his thinking and his behoving for him? The dishonour which the Churches have brought upon these words is a confession that they have found that the " considerer " of their faith rarely ends in accepting it; that the man of broad opinions is never content with their pin¬ hole outlook on the universe; that free thought is fatal to their fetters ; that the " chooser " of his own faith is not often found choosing theirs. The time will come when everybody will be amazed that intel¬ ligent men should feel wounded at a defence of the duty of man¬ kind to inquire, to consider, to doubt, before building faith and life on any proposition. Divinity, in desiring an unthinking adhesion, claims that we should give up the well-tried rule of every-day life, where it is only by testing things by doubts that we come to correct conclusions. One man will weep in secret that he cannot believe the incarnation or the miracles; another will swallow all mysteries, and only regret he hasn't more to swallow. One poor saint will grope through the world melan¬ choly, doubting if he is regenerate, or whether he pleases God; another is perfectly assured that he is of the elect, that he is God's darling, and gives himself no more trouble about it. Which of these is learning the lesson of this universe Which is the really humble and surrendered soul Let that be answered by our first deeper glance at this our mysterious life, where we find ourselves, as in mid-ocean, with neither shore in sight. While man is but a bundle of senses, he never doubts; nature will first wean him, and that by causing him to doubt his senses. The child, putting a stick in the water, sees it as if it was broken ; taking it out again, he sees it unbroken : his senses have deceived him. He will get astride a stick-horse, beguiling himself with the pretence that he is carried by that which he carries: his</page><page sequence="39">ON EDUCATION. 35 senses have deceived him. He will see stars nearly touching- each other, and aftei wards learn that they are billions of miles apart. He will hear an echo, or reply, to his voice in the ravine, and discover no one there but himself. He will see a flat earth, and be compelled to believe it round. He will next discover that every piece of real knowledge began by a doubt cast on tho senses, and discover that doubt is the method of knowledge. I, for one, should call the sceptic the ideal man, with nature's finest clay and clearest flame in the make of him. He stands for justice against autocracy in the sphere of thought, holding the balances with unflinching, though human, hand. He will press established positions hard ; their fallacies will appear, if they have them; or, if they have none, they will be made firmer. The young dis¬ coverer knows that the current opinion was only the conclusion of some previous young discoverer. Blind, indeed, must he be who does not see that such scepticism is the garment of a real faith ; that unbelief expresses itself by the sloth or indifference which sits down to the comfortable conventional creed, and cries out with alarm lest the sceptic should topple over God's throne; while the great believer is he that calmly trusts the solidity of the universe, has no misgiving that an honest thought can mar its destiny, and ever follows the truth (however thorny priests make the path), though it make him a wanderer past the warm and inviting temples of superstition. Once the spirit of scepticism is roused in a man, he knows no moderation. In his eyes authority becomes mockery; faith, impotence. Free from the magic of superstition, he becomes conscious of his own strength. No dogma is too sacred—no explanation too plausible, to escape his rude challenge. Honce, it is easy to conceive what treatment the Bible, with its manifold, defects, has to expect from his tender mercies. He pounces upon the thousand metaphysical difficulties which surrounds its doctrines, and which have puzzled the inge¬ nuity of its highest philosophers, without being brought one step nearer to a satisfactory solution. Nay, he rips open its very fun¬ damental conceptions, dragging to light every inconsistency, incon¬ sequence, and self-contradiction lurking or enshrined therein; while his hopeless champions, trembling with horror, but unable to stop this work of vandalism, wonder if heaven's wrath had spent its lightnings. Meantime, the havoc proceeds. The shat¬ tered images crowd on every side ; the different attributes of the Godhead, so necessary to orthodoxy, but so irreconcilable with one another, and, therefore, incapable of predication together ; the strange doctrine of prayer, so useless if God be just, so impious, so blasphemous, if it implies his openness to flattery or adulation ; the enjoined duty of a simultaneous belief in predestination and free-will, an impossibility both of thought and fact; the necessity of inherited sin, and salvation through the sufferings of an inno¬ cent God, a conception more allied to wild caprice or wanton blood-thirstinoss, than any notion of justice or equity possible to human intelligence, and yet a conception constituting the essence 3—2</page><page sequence="40">36 ON EDUCATION. of a Bible-believer's speciality as respects the other believers in the unknown and unknowable ; and, to crown all, this very salva¬ tion, worked through centuries of human suffering, and crowned with the suffering of a God, proving no salvation to the greater part of mankind, who could scarce help wondering if it might not be a deception of the unholy spirit, working in the dark for our ruin; a scheme, in short, so clumsy and unavailing, though brought out in such wanton defiance of every law, natural and moral, and worked with all the tentative skill of supreme wisdom, improving upon itself through experience of nearly two thousand years, that it leaves as much sin, suffering, and ignorance now in the world as when it found them; a scheme, in fine, which even human pride might blush to own. Attempts have sometimes been made by clergymen to put down sceptical writings, by asserting that their arguments are only a repetition of old ones that have been effectively replied to over and over again; but this must be of little avail, without stating where the replies are to be found—and this they fail to do. Other clergymen dispose of the matter shortly, by declaring that they never read such works, of course, from fear of their contaminating influence. But can one, who ought to be fortified by the fullest theological knowledge, be justified in allowing it to be supposed that he can be thus affected And is he not, above all men, bound to be aware of, and ready to meet, all sceptical attacks Let me put this case to a clergyman who would so evade this important subject. One of his flock—say, an intelligent person— having read mine, or Colenso's, or some similar work, and having had his, or her, previous faith in inspiration thereby shaken, and peace of mind disturbed, and attributing this to inability to dis¬ cover the fallibility of the writer's arguments, goes to his, or her, minister for help. Is the latter justified in replying to such applicants, that he does not read works of the kind, because of their evil tendency, and simply advising their being eschewed Surely he cannot, in this easy way, expect to remove the diffi¬ culties of reflecting persons who seek his aid, and who thus must leave him with all the facts and information they have acquired still oppressing their minds. The clergyman is the religious teacher and helper to whom any one of his flock has as much right to apply for assistance as he, or she, would, in a case of illness or legal difficulty, to apply to a doctor or lawyer; and would either of the latter be justified in replying, that " Your's is a case with which I do not feel called on to make myself acquainted?" Thus it is how matters stand between the two parties, one believing and the other disbelieving in the inspiration of the Bible; and assuming that both have arrived at their opinions by honest investigation, there remains to be considered the question, whether the former are justified in assuming their opinions to be so indisputably right, as to warrant them in pronouncing the latter to be not only wrong, but sinful, for the opinions which they hold, and</page><page sequence="41">ON EDUCATION. - 37 therefore not entitled to the full enjoyment of the same rights, privileges, and advantages, as themselves. Are there any grounds for the assumption of such an arbitraly authority to bo found in the notion tfat it is not permissible to apply intelligence and reason to the consideration of matters of religious faith If this position be allowed, then what are the means by which we can nnderstand what is written in the Bible, and ascertain in what to have faith, since it is only through our intellectual powers that we can know anything at all of the meaning of its words If it "be asserted that religious faith can be arrived at without using these powers, it may as well be said that it is possible to make a religious being of an idiot, or even of a cow or an oyster. No, no ; God gave us our intelligent and discerning powers to enable us, when facts and information are presented to our minds, to distinguish right from wrong, and thereby to learn our duties, and how properly to conduct ourselves in all the relations of life. Besides, people cannot choose their opinions, and be of this or that opinion in obedience to will; for according as facts and data are presented to the mind, so must inevitably be tho conclusion, and consequent opinions, which it is as impossible to avoid coming to, as it is to keep back the tide with a mop. Ignorance may havo an opinion, but knowledge dictates opinion. Let us recall the death-bed of the greatest sceptic, free-thinker, ranter, radical, and republican who ever trod the earth. A young- carpenter appeared preaching in the streets of Jerusalem, and with him the spirit of doubt was let loose as never before on this earth. His doubts led him when only a child, it is said, to the learned divinity doctoi s' feet, where he was found inquiring in the temple ; they led him to the wilderness, to the cold mountain and the midnight air. He brought the then existing order of re¬ ligion into doubt. Pharisee and Scribe, temple service and palace, church and state, bear witness by their wrath that a for¬ midable question of all things is at hand. So his death-bed is a gibbet; his death-cry, " My God, why hast thou forsaken me! " A terrible freo-thinker's end! Yes, every drop of his blood was paid for free-thought. Every wound in his body, as we see it there, pleads that men should be large and free, unbelievers of alluntiuth; that the soul should plant itself firmly on its instincts, and hesitate for ever ere it sanction what it suspects to he false, knowing that every falsehood is a seed of injury. Around that free-thinker's death-bed the voices of darkness, agony, and death, cry out to us all, " be free-thinkers " If you must be so with a crown of thorns as your only reward, a cross your last bed, a mothei's powerless tears at your feet your only sympathy, still "be thinkers, and be free. What love of such a being as that is woithy of him, or of the grandeur of your own soul Is it the love of a trembling slave Is a blind, unreasoning, therefore nndoubting, acceptance a fit homage to him who died for spiritual liberation Remember he was hung on that gibbet for exhorting, preaching, and persuading, people to be dissenters, or ranters; to</page><page sequence="42">38 ON EDUCATION. dissent from the National Church, or the religion of the State, as by law established; for allowing himself to be called "King;" for calling their parsons " fools, blind guides, hypocrites, serpents, a generation of vipers, blind leaders of the blind; " and their Churches he called " whited sepulchres, full of dead men's bones and all uncleanness ;" and for all this seditious and inflammatory preaching and speechifying they hung him ; thinking it, no doubt, an effectual way of stopping the promulgation of such language and ideas. But mark the sequel! In less than a century after his thoughts and ideas prevailed with the public, and the people honoured him as a God, and have continued to do so ever since. Oh! young thinking people, to whom faculties are given to be the germs of other faculties, that shall for ever aspire to the In¬ finite Light, cherish every doubt that comes of simplicity and truth. As the little polyp shows on itself a dot, which draws to itself strength until it expands into another organized animal, so the doubt that arises is the germ of some higher truth to be unfolded. Cherish every doubt. To quarrel with these throes of the mind, whereby new truths are born, were to quarrel with the fire—seethings at the heart of the world, which shall presently cast up, through boiling seas, some fair island for the habitation of man. Scepticism is the only path to a noble certainty ; As Lord Bacon says, "he who will commence with certainties shall end with doubts; but he who is content to commence with doubts may arrive at certainties." This invites you, I know, to unrest of mind and sleepless nights ; but who would evade the eternal laws, and say to the Spirit of Life, " Pass on! Animate the world ; kindle every star'; let the great heart beat from ocean to ocean; let the power fill full every trunk, branch, leaf, and vein of nature ; but leave me alone to sleep. Let none of the divine currents fill or thrill me." For you can write the history of this Universe on the smallest leaf of the forest; it is motion and rest; rest the sleep, motion the dream; rest the prose, motion the poetry; rest the sleeping princess, motion the prince whose kiss unchains her spell. These enter the inward world as the twin sisters, Doubt and Certainty. There is nothing certain save through doubt of its contrary, nothing doubtful save by the greater certainty of that which brings it into doubt. This conflict means a more stable peace, "the wisdom that cometh from above is first pure, then peaceable." In regions too cold for life the traveller desires to sleep; his sleep were not more fatal than, to the mind, the certainty which is content to slumber amid the evil and ignorance in this world. We want no mythological and mysterious doubts to enslave our minds; no legends of magic music to whose measure all must keep step. From the falling of the walls of Jericho before the ram's horns of Joshua; or the rising of tho men of Thebes to the lyre of Orpheus; or the old story of the flute with which Roland at Roncesvalles called his warriors from afar ; or the magic pipes of the Jews, making them dance among thorns until their</page><page sequence="43">ON EDUCATION. 39 wickedness was punished; or the bugle of Cromwell, causing "bishops and parsons to dance out of their copes and scapularies. In England recently the same protean pipes have been played by the clergy of the established church, sounding aloud the notes of Protestantism. But we, in this our day, know full well what represents the magic pipe to whose sound all must move, and even mountains open, as they did before the Pied Piper of Hamilton. It is the steam-whistle. This it is to whose shrill remorseless note the age goes burrowing, tunnelling, bridging oceans, and ex¬ cavating rocky mountains. The great steam-shuttles mutt weave races and nations together. Can a people who travel by steam¬ ships fall back to swimming on a log in their religion? Men cannot, for any gieat length of time, be content to pass six days of the week in the nineteenth century, and recur to the means and methods of the year One, on the seventh. Sharp, startling, "by no means pleasant to the ear, is this steam-whistle, piercing- through our quietest hour, invading our religious repose, and dis¬ pelling slumber; it is at present too close to us ; only in its far echoes can we hear its softened tones; there its notes are spiritualized to the sounds they must bear to the ear of the future, when it shall be said, Happy were they who dwelt near the fountains of those strains that built our hundred-gated civiliza¬ tion Noises reach not so far as music. The horns, lyres, flutes, pipes, bugles, and whistles bring on gentle and prophetic strains. So pipe on, pitiless engineer! Assiduous thou only to clear thy track, to bring passengers, bales, and freights safe to yonder market; but even now, to the wild echoes thou hast set flying, the very dust, smoke, and steam marches into shades of beauty. Above the base of commerce is the clear tenor of fraternity. Lo! there is music on the air, as of the breaking of millions of chains! From all nations of the earth the echoes return in the happy voices of liberated hearts and homes. This one generation with its vulgar steam-whistle, has witnessed the vanishing of more shadows from the earth, has seen more men and women disenthralled, more rays of intellectual light shed abroad upon mankind, than any ten generations which have preceded it; and ere it ceases, that shrill signal shall swell to the trump of the last judgment, "bringing to the bar of humanity every creed or institution of the earth. The State Church must undergo many repairs in order to last, and with every repair something must perish. The materials of the old one cannot be used for substantial repairs, any more than the priestly horrors of any education but that which trains the youthful neck for the priestly yoke, can be dealt with, who from their very cradle-side, have hitherto been taught that everlasting tortures, by fire, await all who doubt or deny. These lessons "being also continually impressed by a practical anticipation of such fires for notorious sceptics. These old materials and weapons of the Church are of no use for repairs ; earthly govern¬ ment has already found it necessary to mitigate some of the</page><page sequence="44">40 ON EDUCATION. rigours of divine law; hell-fires can no more be anticipated at Smithfield, nor the earthly heaven be secured to believers, so absolutely as before. Nevertheless, there remains the power to urge all the more the terrors and rewards of the future, and— for these must grow weak—society may still wield its ostracisms and distribute its advantages for the coercion of opinion. The thirty-nine Articles shall mean many things, but one thing definite shall they mean; thirty-nine pieces of money to him who shall betray reason for them. To them shall be given the keys of knowledge, and only he shall enter the University who will lay down his independence at the threshold. Every sceptic shall see the difference between his own and his orthodox neighbour's coffers. As for the clever young scholars, if they be¬ come restless under the task of believing the incredible, there shall be provided the chloroform of promotion and luxury, under which surgeries can be easily performed on the mind, Has any young theologian a tendency to doubt, or to write radical books Make him a head master, a canon, a dean, a professor, or a bishop. " Thus it came to pass, that on the 4th day of February, 1869, a great crowd of cultivated people sat together in Canterbury Cathedral, to witness the consecration of a plain old Scotch gentleman to the task of presiding over the work of maintaining, in Great Britain, the worship of a dead Jew. A buzz of gay con¬ versation filled the building. Each clergyman who entered was discussed ; the poor clergymen in seedy coats, their wives in old- fashioned bonnets, were greeted with titters. Bonnets, in propor¬ tion to their antiquity, retain their ancient power to render their wearers invisible to many. Some of these country faces were fresh as roses climbing on cottage doors; about others hovered the faces of children whose love they had gained ; now and then, some appeared on which were reflected the sad smiles of invalids over whom they had bent. There were signs that these and their husbands—they of the seedy coats—came from regions where the ministry of Christ still retains a meaning; these had not come for a pic-nie, like those whose mirth they excited. Gradually all became still; the solemnity of the occasion wrought its effect, and quiet thoughts returned. When the ceremony was over I went back to St. Martin's. The two most eminent deans that Canterbury ever knew were there. They stood together, gazing silently on the window stained with a picture of St. Martin in the act of cutting his cloak in two, to give half of it to the naked beggar crouching near his horse's head. While we were all sauntering about the diminutive building, a voice arrested our attention. A strange-looking man, with limp white cravat and threadbare coat, had got up into the little pulpit. His white locks fell about a face wrinkled with care, down upon his shoulders ; his ghttering eye held up, as that of the ancient Mariner did the wedding guest. Thus he spake:— " St. Martin's Church faces Canterbury Cathedral. The lowli-</page><page sequence="45">ON EDUCATION. 41 ness of the one, and the grandeur of the other, do not alone mark different eras of the English Church; they mark two totally distinct religions. The one means the saint who sacrifices his raiment for the needy; the other means a saint who sacrifices the needy to his raiment. What are our grand cathedrals, with their great revenues, but the rich gold-embroidered cloaks of a Jewish peasant, whose position in England has become princely. " I am a poor country clergyman, with a large family, and one hundred and fifty pounds a year. For thirty years I have bent shivering, like the beggar on the window there, near the door of a magnificent cathedral. Before the altar of that cathedral a bishop—who has been unable to do any work for ten years- moulders away, awaiting the day when he shall be carved there in stone, when he will do as much good as he does now. Fifty people get their living out of the revenues of that cathedral; they keep up a daily service for about twenty-five daily listeners. These attendants are from wealthy families, and their servants, in the neighbourhood, who have nothing else to do ; the common people never go there. What can I see in that cathedral but a great pile of loam in the centre of a barren field. What could I do for my own culture, for my own ability to serve, for the poor and ignorant around me, if the wealth of this useless heap were distributed for the religious advantage of the people! As it is, what do I find under the shadows of those majestic towers I will not speak of the daily anxiety, and the effort to make both ends meet; nor of a certain happy girl who has faded into the pale and care-worn mother, who toils and suffers at my side. But there is the need of servility to the wealthy, who think themselves St. Martins if they throw us an occasional shilling ; there is the parasite of ignorance creeping over my children's minds ; there is the subtle scepticism and despair deposited by each day in my own. Amid the conflict of sects, the surgings of scepticism, the only shores of belief, as solid as that on which were built and endowed our cathedrals, are popular education, freedom of thought, political liberty, and the rescue of the masses from pauperism, disease, and vice. Therefore, though to me there is left only a weak arm and a feeble voice, the last effort of both shall be made here and now. To the Church I bid an eternal adieu !" When the old clergyman had ceased, he tottered and nearly fell. The two deans, who had been gazing on the stained win¬ dows, sprang forward, and bore him to their carriage, in which he was driven away. From this scene the writer journeyed to a church auction, where five cures of souls were to be sold. A Jew bid for the livings; a faint smile showed itself on the faces present, caused by the oddity of a Catholic duke selling Christian cures of souls to a Jew. The autioneer harangued his bidders as follows :— " Gentlemen, these are no common lots which I have the plea¬ sure to offer to you to-day. These churches have cost a great deal. Their Founder had to be nailed to the cross that thoy might</page><page sequence="46">42 ON EDUCATION. "be built. Their walls are cemented with the blood of faithful heaits, the blood of confessors and martyrs. Thousands perished to put them in the state of repair in which I offer them to you to-day. They are consecrated by centuries of sorrow and sacrifice ; in them souls have inly burned with the 'flame of devotion; stricken hearts raised their supplications to One who alone could fathom their needs ; souls have brought to those altars their bur¬ dens of sin and sorrow ; and earnest minds aspired there to know the mysteries of life and. death. Their bells have rung in merrily the happy and sad years of wedlock, and again have tolled above the sobs of mourners. Their spires have pointed grief and poverty from eaithly struggle to eternal peace. All these have gone to swell the market value of the five cures of souls which the light of the blessed Reformation, and the grace of the Duke of Norfolk, enable me to offer you this day. " What! does no one bid yet Did I hear some one muttering about money-changers scourged from the Temple, or another call it outrageous that the cures of souls should be put up at auction Gentlemen, we are not children ; let us not refer to the childhood of the world for our precedents. We belong to a national Church which represents the apotheosis of decency. A whip of small cords, even for those who make the house of God a den of thieves, were vulgar in these days. Above all, let us have no mawkish or hypocritical sentimentalism here. We are Englishmen, who know the pearl of price to be a pound Stirling ; and we pray that our queen may live long in health and wealth. As for this church auction, permit me to remind you that it is no novel thing. The Christian Church of old was no sooner built, and the miserable scaffold at its base, on which its Founder perished like a slave, raised to shine on its towers as the symbol of honour, than the imperial predecessors of his grace, our duke, put it up at auction. Truth bid for it. Justice, humanity, holiness, did the same; but royalty fand superstition joined their purses and outbid the others. They have owned and conducted it to this day. Through them it is that the worshippers in it sit on cushions instead of on the cold hill-side. It is clue to them that the suc¬ cessors of wretched fishermen, following one who had not where to lay his head, do now get fine episcopal salaries and palaces. Gentlemen, it is a commercial age. Everything is in the market. What will you have quoth God ; pay for it, and take it. Nay, gentlemen repair even to the pulpits themselves; is not every prayer, every sermon, bought and paid for There is, indeed, an old story, that the world once offered all its kingdoms if the Founder of Christianity would only modify his ideas of worship, and that he refused; but we must await the results of modern criticism before crediting such preternatural narratives as that. At any rate, we have England to deal with, not ancient Judea, where, it has been truly said, "they didn't know everything." " Does any man here believe that the 1300 livings in the hands of the House of Lords, or the livings representing sg2,000,00G-</page><page sequence="47">ON EDUCATION. 43 sterling subject to private patronage, are mainly disposed of to the humblest and devoutest clergymen, without reference to any earthly or political considerations If so, let him move a return of the number of Liberal clergymen enjoying livings owned by Conservative landlords. Let him explain why the clergy resisted Irish disestablishment in a phalanx almost as solid as that with which the dissenters, reading the same Bible, and worshipping the same Christ, advocated it; if he would show the Church pulpits unpurchasable by any interest. But I need not confine my state¬ ments to any one Church. Look abroad through Christendom, and decide whether the scholarship, the ability, the ingenuity, and the eloquence which still maintains its dogmas, are not retained by fees. Does that learned Oxonian believe that the world was made in six days Does he believe that on the seventh day God rested, and was refreshed after the fatigue of the Creation Does he believe Athanasius when he says Christ is Almighty God, rather than Jesus when he says, ' My Father is greater than I ' And does he believe that all who adhere to the latter belief shall without doubt perish everlastingly Does he believe that God has prepared everlasting fires, that he sends millions into the world knowing that they will eventually burn in the same, and that among those who' will suffer that vengeance are all disbe¬ lievers of the orthodox creed Does he believe that Newton, Hume, Channing, Franklin, Schiller, Goethe, Comte, Mill, Taylor, Scott, Carlyle, Emerson, Mazzini, Garibaldi, are all destined to be damned, and that the generation they have been somehow empow¬ ered to train, is to follow them to perdition Does he believe that God has assigned as the one plan of salvation, a scheme which the majority of the best brains constructed by himself find utterly incredible; a scheme which the chief men of science find contra¬ dicted by every fact of nature, and the jurors of rihilosophy find revolting to reason If the scholarly graduate does not believe this, why does he preach it Has he not been knocked down at the bid of some grand abbey, or chapel, or cathedral Has he said ' Get thee behind me ' to promotion What has poor, unen¬ dowed scepticism to offer the young minister Who shall look for the scholarly divine to utter the tahsmanic word in his heart, when he knows that at that moment the walls around him must crumble, and he be left to take his chance with the hunted foxes, but with¬ out even their certainty as to holes " Consider these things, I pray you, gentlemen, and confess that it is but a straining at gnats to object to the selling at auction of the five churches which I now again offer to the highest bidder, saint or sinner, without condition, save that no Non-conformist shall preach in any one of them, be he the angel Gabriel. Set in them clergymen who shall teach men how to invest successfully in heavenly script. Let the children learn, as the}r did at the Big Tabernacle, that fleeing to Jesus means tea and cake at a distin¬ guished brother's house, and limitless measures of the same here¬ after. Let young and old there study the law and the profits. How</page><page sequence="48">44 ON EDUCATION. much was the popularity of Christ's name increased, in mediaeval Europe, after it was stamped on a gold coin, and its leadership meant a ducat! And is not the name of God on our own coins Wherever our race goes, this sanctity of the profitable thing appears ; as, across the ocean, in the almighty dollar. Other races maybe proverbially 'gay,' 'romantic,' 'theoretical;' we are 'shopkeeping,' and, in the sacred name of British trade, I offer you these cures of souls to-day. Who bids Going! going!! gone!!!" Such was the scene at the church auction; and bear in mind, such scenes as the aforesaid are facts, not fables. I could relate scores, aye, hundreds of others, but will content myself with re¬ lating one more fact, in order to show how derogatory, injudicious, and unwise it is to demand that the Bible, and the teaching of the Bible, shall be for the children of this kingdom essential. I would ask, what good has the Biblo done for the working man? Why, not many weeks since a lad named Mobbs was executed for mur¬ dering a boy, from whom he received no provocation whatever. The entire absence of any apparent motive for the deed, led the prisoner's counsel to put forward a plea of insanity. Before his execution Mobbs made a confession, in which he traced his deed to a morbid condition of mind produced by reading two things— one was a copy of the Illustrated Police News, with a pictorial ac¬ count of the Alton murder; the other, the Bible, with the story of Cain and Abel. This was the food which fed the wild beast in Mobbs into fatal strength. When the confession was published there was a great outcry against the Illustrated Police News. But the editor of the paper said, in his letter to the Times, "If a pic¬ ture representing the Alton tragedy acted as an incentive to the commission of crime, in an equal degree did the Bible, to which the prisoner alludes in the following passage : ' I had a book also about Cain and Abel in my dinner basket; that book was given to me by my grandfather, just before he died..' " But there was no outcry against the Bible Society, which is as busy to day as_ever taking care that wherever there is a Mobbs, he shall have the story of Cain and Abel in his dinner basket. Are not dukes, earls, lords, and members of Parliament, declar¬ ing that, "for the children of the British kingdom, an essential" shall be, that they shall be taught to read and regard, as the Word of God, a book which contains stories so gross, sensual, and cruel, that if they were contained in any other book, the police would make a raid, upon the bookshop where it was sold The judge who sentenced Mobbs told him he was instigated to commit his crime by the devil. Mobbs, about to die, says one instigator of his crime was the fourth chapter of Genesis. But a legion of Mobbses studying murder from the pages of the Bible, cannot move the idol, in obedience to which we are taxed to pay, to place the stories of Cain and Abel, Joseph and Potiphar's wife, Lot and his daughters, Jael and Sisera, David and Uriah, Solomon with his seven hundred wives and three hundred concubines, and a</page><page sequence="49">ON EDUCATION. 45 hundred other atrocities, into the hands of our youth, and even little boys and girls. " Alas for the children! The stony idol is unmoved by the accumulated evidence that school-children ignore what is beautiful and pure in the Bible (that being as far beyond their young expe¬ rience as Kant's metaphysics are beyond their intelligence), and dwell upon the stories they can comprehend. Millions of hearts and minds, first soiled by contact with these obscene pages, are offered by each generation as a holocaust to the idol of Christen¬ dom. You may notice the more salient instances only; but the whole case can alone be appreciated when you remember, that where hearts fall before temptations which others withstand, it implies a secret moral decay at work beforehand. The weakening of moral forces in human beings, through the perusal of the Bible in early life, proceeds during an age not easily subjected to scru¬ tiny by themselves or others ; but no one who remembers his or her school-days can fail to recall scandals of a kind that have hardly names, much less reports in detail, outside of that book. Is not this human sacrifice I ask, what has the Bible done for the people Has it not been the text-book of the oppressor in every age It has murdered thousands of innocent people with its sentence, ' Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.' It binds mil¬ lions to-day under the tyrant's foot with its commands, ' Resist not evil;' ' Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit your¬ selves ;' ' Obey the magistrates.' And does not Paul aid slave- hunters, by admonishing slaves, even if they could be free, to prefer their chains And further, does he not furnish the slave- drivers with their motto, ' Servants obey your masters in all things, not only the good and gentle, but also the froward, not answering them.' " " A people who have an authority acting above, and not through, their faculties, are so far intellectually paralysed. They are in the power of an idol, and can be easily overawed by it; when it is held up the common sense goes out of them, and they will yield rights which no earthly power, unaided by superstition, could extort from them. The English people have a love of truth; yet, even after the Convocation of bishops have been forced to admit that the English version of the Bible contains thousands of errors of translation, it is possible for eminent personages to resist tho correction of those errors, by raising fears that the place of the book in the popular veneration, may not survive any alteration of its words. The English people have a strong sense of justice; yet, so paralysed is it in the presence of the Bible, that they are ready to compel those who believe that book to be one of the worst possible for children, to furnish money to distribute it among their neighbours' children. If there was no idol in the case, would tho English people, at the end of so many centuries of struggle for tho right of conscience, sacrifice those rights, so far as they belong to the free-thinking minority, and force them to contribute to the dissemination of what they hold to be great and dangorous error ?"</page><page sequence="50">46 ON EDUCATION. You have heard of the crocodiles devouring the Hindoo children when thrown by their parents into the river Ganges ; and I have read of English children thrown by Christian parents into the jaws of death, and these fearful child-sacrifices may seem very far from our own homes ; but there are sacrifices nearer home, for there are few homes in Christendom wherein, in some form or other, the children are not victims of the Bible. To a royal sensualist, called in that book the wisest of men, is attributed the proverb, " Spare the rod and spoil the child;" that sentiment has been the cause of more cruelty to childhood, wrong to human nature, and bad training; it has made more cowardly, deceitful, sneaking men and women, than any other sentiment ever uttered. Entering every school and home with the authority of a divine command, the rod has appealed to the meanest motives, and fostered every animalism. The child's will must be broken ; but why not break its back You would make the child a facsimile of yourself; you will " bring¬ down its spirit" to your own level, and teach it that the evil of wrong is physical suffering, and that the beauty of holiness is a sugar-plum ; and yet, perhaps, you wonder that the world is so full of sly and selfish people. It is true, indeed, that some grow to be noble and manly despite the rod, for broken wills can sometimes knit together like broken bones; "but on many faces that are mere cyphers appended to the real figures of the world,—foreheads that are but the graves of individual minds,—the wise are reading the monition, " spare the child and spoil the rod." The Bible is a product of humanity, and every thing human must die. It is like an old tree which has stood centuries until its usefulness to the world has been nearly exhausted; to many it is dead already, and the number of them is increasing clay by day; for these I speak. Why, to put the Bible, as it is, into the hands of children, is not only totally to bewilder their sense of right and wrong, but it is to invite familiarity with the idea of the worst oriental vices. Even in the ease of those vices being mentioned only to be denounced, the suggestion is apt to remain, and the de¬ nunciation to be disregarded. It is notoriously injudicious to put into the minds of children faults of which they might never have thought of themselves, for the sake of admonishing them against them. I know myself an instance of a pious mother sending her daughter to a boarding-school, having first written in her Bible a list of the chapters and passages which she was not to read. It is remarkable how popular in the school that Bible became; the other girls were always borrowing it. There is no reason to suppose that boys would have acted differently. It may be thought by some of my readers, that particular instances I have adduced may not be immoral as they stand in the Bible, but they are assuredly provocative of immorality in children who read them. I myself have found them so. A far more serious indictment against the Bible as a hand-book of moral instruction, must be founded on its habit of representing- the Deity as a consenting party to some of the worst actions of its</page><page sequence="51">ON EDUCATION. 47 characters; nay, so unreliable is it as a basis of any thing what¬ ever, that after thus characterising the Deity, it deals in strong denunciations against those " who not only commit such things themselves, but have pleasure in them that do them" (Rom. 1. 32); thus, by direct implication, condemning the Deity himself. If it "be desirable to impress upon children the belief that only those " who fear God and work righteousness are acceptable to him," it is to stultify the whole principle of their education to represent Him to them as an eastern monarch, selecting his favourites by caprice, and independently of any merit or demerit on their part. Yet the entire Bible rests upon the idea that, so far from being an equal Father of all, "whose tender mercies are over all his works," the Almighty selected, out of all mankind, one race to be " His own peculiar people," and out of that race certain individuals to be His own peculiar favourites, and this in spite of the most glaring defects in their characters and conduct; and sustained those whom He had thus chosen through the whole course of their misdeeds, It is remarked by a well-known author that " the English tolerate no indecencies except in their Bibles." Fatal exception, when we print Bibles in millions', in all languages of the earth, and thrust them into the hands of every child, grow¬ ing youth, and others. Again, it is said in the Bible that " God made man in his own image ;" whether it be true or not, it is very certain that man has made God in his image, and moreover, has credited hirn with the qualities, morals, and immorals, which they found in them¬ selves ; and in their total ignorance of natural law and phenomena, were more ready to seek the divine hand in departures from the regular order of nature, than to recognise it in its establishment and maintenance. It is thus that all early literatures necessarily contain prodigies and fables illustrative of the imperfect notions of their period. And so far from these things being true because they are in the Bible, or a reproach to the Jews in being untrue, the miracle really would have been, if there were no miracles, no anthropomorphism, in the Scriptures. In this sense, therefore, it may be said that the truth of the Bible is proved by the untruths of the Bible. Even if we give the Jews credit as having done their best for the honour of their God, in thus constructing him in their own image, we assuredly cannot lay claim to similar credit for ourselves; for we have fallen infinitely below our best, in the character we have assigned to our God. Think for a moment how marvellous is the anomaly we present. For six clays of the week, we avail ourselves freely of the wondrous results of the most advanced science and culture, philosophy, and thought, of this nineteenth century after Christ, in which the labours of all former centuries have culminated, and we do this for our own advantage and enjoyment; and on the seventh day, when the honour of our God is concerned, we are content to jump back to the nineteenth century before Christ, and borrow for him both character and lineaments from a semi-barbaroiia Syrian tribe, whose whole L</page><page sequence="52">48 ON EDUCATION. literature proves their absolute incapacity to comprehend the simplest of his works in nature. And in their image, fitful and vengeful, we make our God, refusing him the benefits of the light we have gained. A wondrous feat of moral and intellectual athletics is this our weekly jump backward and then forward again. The Bible, like the Jews, its authors, has wrought much evil and wickedness in the world; the good is daily lessening, and the evil becoming daily more marked and more pernicious. It is time that some should, with sincerity and openness, utter aloud what great multitudes are thinking in the silence of their own souls, even though they may be only half conscious of the real drift of their own thoughts. The taught are in advance of their teachers. The Bible does not proclaim the highest truths, inculcate the purest ethics, breathe the noblest spirit, stimulate the grandest life^or hold up to the soul and to society the loftiest ideal of that which ought to be. It has stood still while the race has moved on. It has become the chief hindrance in the path of man to the destiny marked out for him in the very laws of his own being—. the chief obstacle to the realization of those magnificent dreams which are the inspiration of his sublimest endeavour. Thousands are becoming aware of this. For these I speak. Who can mis¬ take the tone of the authentic voices of the Anglo-Saxon civiliza¬ tion, to the theology which still stands declaring that all who do not accept it shall, without doubt, perish everlastingly " Depart! " cries the human conscience. "Your creeds refer to benighted eras, when men believed that evil and sin were the mere whims of a superior being, like the most frivolous among themselves; one whose mere word could make the eating of an apple a deadlier sin than murder; it belongs not to a day when the highest voice in every soul declares the eternal laws, which God himself dares not violate. "Depart!" cries common sense. " Your miracles and legends "belong to an age when men could not see a lunatic without fan¬ cying a devil was in him; or a meteor, without believing it the arrow of a god: it has no part or lot in a generation to which sciences are revealing the laws of cause and effect. " Depart! " cry the senses. " Your story of a blighted and ruined world may do for Syrian deserts, or for monks and nuns who have buried themselves in the unillumined cloisters; but on the green slopes of Western Europe, amid its cheerful populations, every flower, every singing bird, proves it a prodigy of falsehood; and every happy home, with its loving mother and bright-eyed child and honest man, is a contradiction to your wild superstition of the fall, and the depravity of human nature. "Depart!" cries the democracy of the west. "Your despotic deity, with his hell for all who do not glorify him enough, and sugar-jjlum heaven for his flatterers, is an idol copied from some barbaric king among his courtiers, with his racks and his patronages "beside him; it has no place in nations where rulers are as much subject to the laws as the people, for whom, and not for princes,</page><page sequence="53">ON EDUCATION. 49 laws are established; and where the poorest cannot be punished "but under codes that all must make and all obey." "Depart!" cries the aspiiing religious sentiment. "To the earnest inquiry of liberated hearts for truth, you have been proved the false reply; now you stand in the light: there stationed across the path, mocking all knowledge, browbeating every brave seeker for truth, frightening young children with your bogies, infusing your opinions into the heads of mere babes, and edu¬ cating your own ideas into their young minds to make them believe as you do; you are the enemy of all the great tendencies and ideals of this age, which, but for you, could even now, perhaps, attain the true faith, and build the genuine shrine for which the spirit of man weeps and watches." Thus, in tune, rise all noble voices. As the fires of Smithfield have made way for the meat market, so, after them, have the flames of God's eternal Smithfield faded out of the marts and daily life of the people. There is not a man or woman in England whose practice accords with a belief in the promises and threats of the Christian creeds. How would it affect that man at his work, or even in the theatre, if he believed that his child at home was in remote danger of being burnt for even five minutes? The man who should offer his cheek to the smiter, his cloak to the robber, who should not resist evil, but let scoundrelism have its way, or the man ^ho should take no thought for the morrow, is not the kind of man any one wishes his son to be. Who is it that sells all he has and gives to the poor Well enough, all this, for those who look for the swift destruction of the world, and are laying up treasures for a kingdom coming out of the sky; but not for sane men, who eat the productions of the earth, and. find them sweet and good, and know that it will sur¬ vive, as it has in the past, the advent and departure of many celestial kingdoms. England is the cemetery of religions : Druid- ism, Odinism, Romanism, came from afar to find their graves here ; and behold, the feet of them which have buried those reli¬ gions are at the door, and shall carry out also that which remains to frighten fools and make hypocrites of the able, moulding no heart to simplicity and grandeur. With all seriousness, then, and with intense conviction of the truth and urgent necessity of what I say, I impeach the Bible before the bar of civilized mankind. In the name of all that is "best, noblest, and divinest in human nature, I impeach it of high crimes and misdemeanors against the peace of the world and tho progress of the race towards a freer and holier future. And I summon it to appear before this high tribunal of humanity, to show good cause why it should not stand condemned and sentenced "by its judge. For it is not I that speak, but the largest mind, the purest conscience, the tenderest heart, and the most earnest spirit of the nineteenth century. They bring no flippant or idle charge, but utter the world's grave declaration of independence of the power that has become a tyranny. 4</page><page sequence="54">50 ON EDUCATION. As Abbot says, "I impeach it in the name of human intel- ligene, because it is the grand organised superstition of the Western world, perpetuating in modern times the false beliefs, the degrading fears, and the benumbing influences of the dark ages; in proportion to its power over men, paralysing their intel¬ lectual faculties, keeping them in the bondage of childish fancies, and governing them by means of an irrational religious terrorism. Because it is the great enemy of science, retarding the spread of natural knowledge, opposing new truths and discoveries as irre¬ ligious, perpetuating popular ignorance on all but permitted sub¬ jects, in order that its own empire may be unshaken; and making blind faith in impossible doctrines the highest virtue of the human soul, and the only protection against terrible, yet purely ima¬ ginary, dangers. Because it is the greatest stumbling-block in the pathway of civilization, inasmuch as it withdraws attention from the natural affairs of this life, concentrates all its earnest thoughts on a future life that is to be eternal bliss or eternal misery, makes a merit of neglect of this world's riches in order " to lay up treasures in heaven," frowns on active enterprize as a dangerous devotion to " carnal things," and thus unfits men for attention to all those objects of honourable ambition on which the progress of civilization so largely depends. "I impeach it in the name of human virtue, because it appeals to hope and fear as the supreme motives of human conduct, holds out promises of an eternal heaven as the reward of obedience to its commands, utters threats of an eternal hell as the punishment of disobedience to them, makes its appeal to human selfishness as the proper spring of human action, and, consequently, undermines and destroys the disinterestedness of all high morality, which commands the right because it is right, and forbids the wrong because it is wrong, regardless alike of punishment and of reward. Because, by this extinction of self-respect, it enfeebles the con¬ sciousness of human rights, and thus blights the very idea of natural justice, which is the practical recognition of these rights. No man who despises himself can respect his fellows, or reverence the rights inherent in their very humanity. Whatever ex¬ tinguishes human rights before God will extinguish human rights among men. Because it recognises no higher law for man than the "revealed will of God." It thus bases all morality on will alone, and says nothing of that necessary nature of things which determines all moral relations. It thus confuses men's ideas of right and wrong, and renders impossible that knowledge of true ethical principles which is essential to all enlightened virtue. " I impeach it in the name of the human heart, because it recognizes no sanctity in natural human affections, but requires that all these shall be subordinated to an unnatural love. ' He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me.' ' If any man hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters ; yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple.' Because it extends over myriads of sen-</page><page sequence="55">ON EDUCATION. 51 sitive minds the blackness and gloom of a horrible theology, tor¬ tures them with a morbid self-reproach for unreal transgressions, and fills them with excruciating doubts of their final escape from hell, thus destroying their happiness, and robbing their life of its natural beauty and charm. Because it commands supreme love to a God whose character it depicts as utterly unlovely.—a God whose wrath against his own childien is a 'consuming fire,' and who plunges the vast majority of them into eternal agony. It thus degrades the very idea of fatherhood by teaching the ' father¬ hood' of a God whose character and acts are as unfatherly as they are incredible. Because it proclaims a 'biotheihood of man' which denies the natural quality essential to all genuine biothei¬ hood—which perverts the natural sentiment of good-will towards all men into an artificial and exclusive bond among professors of their own creeds, and into a thoroughly unnatural condescension or pity towards all others—which is, in fact, consistent with the harshest injustice and the most frightful cruelty towards those who reject their creeds. It thus degrades and lowers the very idea of brotherhood, by calling that the 'brotheihood of man' which is, simply, a fellowship of believeis in their creeds, and which has been too often in history a fellowship of theives and murderers. "I impeach it in the name of human freedom, because it sets- np a despotic authority which, whether as Church or Bible, makes man a slave in his very soul; an authority which shuts up the human intellect within arbitrarily prescribed bounds, hands over the human conscience to the custody of clerical keepers, and rules all human life, individual or social, with an iron rod. Because it has always allied itself with despotism in civil government, has joined with the oppressor in keeping the oppressed under foot, and has sought to maintain its own supremacy on the ruins of all human liberty. Because it teaches the impossibility of humanity's advance through its own natural exertions, and insists that it should rely on supernatural assistance alone, thus extinguishing aspiration, and drying up the fountain-head of all progress. Because it consults only the interests of its own creeds, and sets its face, like a flint, against the purely secular education in which, by a quick instinct, it recognizes the most dangerous enemy of such creeds. Because it teaches despair of human nature, as ruined, lost, and depraved; incapable of all salvation but that which comes from without, and subject to no law of natural development but that of degeneration, carrying it from bad to worse and from worse to worst." Why, as to creeds, they depend upon the country, the age, and the families amid which they take their rise. Thus, in England they are Christian, in other countries Mahomedan, or Pagan. The like facts will determine our morality. Here we are to have one wife, there four; here a man will help his neighbour, there he will eat him ; here we repeat our prayers, there they will pray by machinery—by prayers put in motion by windmills, and rolled off on cylinders, like the Thibetians and Kalmucks, at the rate of 120 4—2</page><page sequence="56">52 ON EDUCATION. per minute, or by wheel and axle, like the Japanese ; but we need not smile at them in disdain: the prayers of millions of English and Europeans are likewise performed by a mere human machine, aided by machinery with pedals and other instruments filled with wind, and are, in fact, just as mechanical. Hear what the famous Christian Minister, the Rev. Spurgeon, said in his Tabernacle pulpit a few days ago on prayer :— " I have always been expecting to hear that before long praying to God would come to be managed by machinery. Our friends have for a considerable time praised God in that way, and a little inventiveness might surely arrange the same for prayers. There is scarcely now a plase of worship dedicated to Christian worship, but what the most of the 'praise to God is done by an organisation of wind and pedals, sometimes with the addition of electricity, and, doubtless, it is quite as consistent, and I believe quite as acceptable to God too, that we commence to pray by wind, or water, or fire, or magnetism, or, better still, by steam. I cannot see why what is done in many cathedrals and churches by machines which eat bread and meat could not equally be well done by engines con¬ suming coals and coke. The making of sounds is a mechanical business, and needs only a little attention, and we might soon have a whole service performed by figures filled with clockwork." The value of prayers in the Papal Church depends greatly on their quantity, and they are often made in a language not under¬ stood by the devotee. Some people pray five times a day, and others only once in seven days. But such prayers appear to consist as much of ejuculations of praise, invocations, and thanksgiving, as of prayer in the strict sense of the word ; not such as are offered up by many English and Europeans even at the present day, who pray for whatever temporal want they may feel to be supplied, even down to the commonest necessaries, or perhaps the luxuries of daily life. It appears that a great many parents and teachers amongst us think that the Almighty is a huge doll-loving baby, fond of flattery, praise, ceremonials, pomp, and show; and, consequently, they'll seek the assistance of the laundry-maid, milliner, and tailor, to deck out their children in fine raiment, pride, elegance, and flat¬ tery ; whereas God requires only the practice of cleanliness, the moral virtues, humility, and a pure mind; for " God is a spirit, and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth," and after no other fashion is a spiritual God to be worshipped. The absence of religious unity, freedom, truth, and love, is the reproach of our kingdom, and will form a source of disquietude to the whole nation so long as it lasts. One Church now tolerated is, I contend, from its very principles, which it vainly seeks to modify, a constant drag, if not a constant danger, to the State. And, for the other sects, what permanent bond of union can there be when men are afraid to speak to each other of religion, and cannot converse with each other on the highest, the noblest, the</page><page sequence="57">ON EDUCATION. 53 most important of topics, without fear of giving offence or of exciting enmity and hatred. We each desire to love and esteem our friends, and the more we love and esteem them the more do we desire to speak with them on a subject of the highest interest and importance to us all; yet the moment we begin to do so, we find them unwilling and apparently frightened to go on, They say at once, " if you do not believe the Bible there is an end of all discussion ;" and we find, to our regret, that it is not God and the - truth they worship, but the Bible and. their own opinions; and thus, till men love and receive truth as such, unity is impossible. But instead of truth they will swallow all the scriptural camels of the Jewish ages; believing that God made the world in six days; that he walked in the garden in the cool of the day; that he came down to see the city and the tower; that he made woman from one of Adam's ribs; that in the form of man, he walked and talked with Adam, Eve, Cain, Enoch, and Abraham, and eat meat and bread with the latter ; cast down great stones out of heaven and killed folks ; took off the Egyptians' chariot wheels ; and sent the she-bears to eat the children ; believing that the waters of the Red Sea opened for the passage of the Israelites; that the quails fell around the camp some three feet thick in a single night; that the walls of Jericho fell at the sounding of a ram's horn ; that Samson caught the foxes, and carried the gates of Gaza; that Elisha's iron axe was made to swim, and the sun and moon to stand still; believing, too, that the whale swallowed Jonah, and all because booked and labelled holy They believe those ancient occurrences, though purporting to have happened two, three, and four thousand years ago, among those old, selfish, warlike and murderous Jews, and then travelling down to us through a corrupt Uoman Catholic priesthood! And yet, while piously believing the above with other theological monstrosities, they reject the evidences of their senses; reject the spiritual gifts, visions, and evidences of Father God and Mother Nature of the present day, and worship, honour, and adore their fetish gods—the repenting, jealous god of Judaism, the changing, angry-getting god of Catho¬ licism; the partial, malicious god of Calvinism ; and the masculine, miracle-working god of Romanism and Protestanism; surely they might find higher conceptions of Deity in the definitions of Plato, Socrates, Christ, Parker, Davies, and others. Why, let them study (as I have done) our paronts' old rock-book,—a Bible that never required a "revision," a gospel never bound in calf, nor man-labelled " Holy." The masses, with open eyes, go blindly through the world, kicking aside the very stones that reveal in their formations the history of countless ages past. With all due deference, I would seriously inquire what tho people of this country care about Noah's Ark, or others of those old myths and legends that characterized the Jews. No matter how the Israelites were fed ; are the poor of this country fed Each city, town, village, hamlet, neighbourhood—all fed, poor and needy, old and young—all fed, in body and mind No matter</page><page sequence="58">54 ON EDUCATION. ab out the number of horns on John's mystic beast, or the mechan¬ ism of Paul's tents, or the colour of the curtains of Solomon's Temple ; we have to do with the living present, the lessons of this day, the necessities of this age. Oh! for living men and women to occupy the pulpits and rostrums of the churches and chapels of this our day! Speaking words that flame with holy fire ; words of truth that convince, words that touch the heart's deepest affections, moving the masses up on to that broad humanitarian plane of toleration and justico, sympathy and fraternity. Scarcely a generation has passed since a certain set of opinions formed part of the instruction of every educated person in England. All young children wero taught that the British Constitution in Church and State, that British laws, manners, and customs, were the most perfect that were possible, and quite incapable of any amendment. In Prussia the education imposed by the government was, until lately, mainly directed to repressing the natural aspira¬ tions of the people for political liberty. In Russia, catechisms are used in the schools, in which children are taught to regard the emperor as a god, or deity, whose will it is sacrilege to dispute. "If men think," say rulers, "they will desire change; therefore men must not think," for with them " ignorance is bliss." But fortunately for the progress of truth and the progress of humanity, men will think, will desire something better; men will believe in the possibility of producing among themselves that harmony which pervades the rest of the universe, and which is only valuable inasmuch as it is the result of their own exertions. And when the true method is discovered, they refuse to be content until it is put into practice. Wherever it is made the interest of men not to find out the right, but to maintain a certain existing routine, there God and nature are practically blasphemed, and the worst infidelity is rampant. Such was the case of the wealthy English bishop whom somo sanguine member of another communion had been trying hard to convince of the error of his Church. The bishop, in telling the story, said, " I listened to his arguments, but I could not help laughing at the idea of being reasoned out of £10,000 a-year." Many governments assert the monstrous principle, that social order can rest only on a theological basis,—on a basis of fear. This is the real meaning of the connection, whether in heathen or Christian countries, between rjriesthoods and govern¬ ments. The governments have made a compact with the religious or sacerdotal orders, that they should act as a police force to awe and subdue the children and people, by holding out the terrors of an after-life, in order to preserve the political and social edifice, no matter how wrongly or villainously constructed it may be. It has been reserved for this age to recognise the truth, that order consists in the harmony of the various conditions of social exist¬ ence ; that progress consists in social development; and that the combination of both is necessary to any permanent organization. Political operations, therefore, can have no efficacy, except in so</page><page sequence="59">ON EDUCATION. 0 J far as they are in accordance with the natural tendency of the human mind. The attempt to force upon any people any system which does not thus accord, can only result in failure and disaster. Institutions, like garments, must fit those for whom they are destined, or they will inevitably be thrown aside. Divinity, or religion, ought to be regarded as food, which is good and necessary for all; but what suits one race may not suit others. The races of the world are various and—even from slight variations of place and constitution.—require various kinds of food. It is useless and foolish to dogmatise on such matters. If we thrust down an Indian's mouth our beef, strong beer, and sauces, his stomach, probably, would refuse to retain them, or he would become ill. Spiritual and intellectual food is of the same nature, and it is silly of us to suppose that, because a Chinese, Malay, or Indian does not perceive the beauty of Christianity, he is, there¬ fore, unfit for any religion whatever. Heaven is a centre to which all men tend, and which all may arrive at from different points of the circumference, without ever seeing each other, or knowing even of each other's existence, and by paths of a very different nature. Every parent ought to think, learn, consider, and know the supreme value of infant education. The Roman Catholic and English Protestant, each alike, says, " Give us but the children to educate, and we will govern the world ; for the children rule the women, the women the men, and the men rule the state." All Europe is a standing example of the truth of what I write. In the monthly paper for last August of the National Society, you may read as follows : " In the present condition of Chiu-ch schools, it is more than ever necessary that they should be made the nurseries of Church principles. Leaving the teacher to act as pioneer, the clergyman must follow on to turn to good account the basis of fact • which the teacher has laid in the minds of the children. He will naturally be occupied with the two highest classes, as those which are soonest to leave school, and, perhaps, to slip altogether from his grasp. Before they do so, they should be furnished with reasons for holding fast the faith they have been taught. They ought to know -why they should be Churchmen, and not Dis¬ senters ; why they should go to church, and not to meeting ; why they should be Anglicans, and not Romanists. The time has come when, probably, the whole fate of the Church of England will turn upon the hold she may have upon the rising generation." "There is a sweet harmony in the discord of our sectarians," says theRev. Kirkman. "With one voice, all the leaders of the wrangling denominations applaud the wisdom of this manifesto. Conceal but the Church colours of the herald who blows the trumpet, and the Boniish sacrificer, the Presbyterian priest, the Calvinistic soul-smiter, the Methodist soul-saver—all feel the same inspiration at the sound, and each slaps his thigh, exclaiming, 'Just my sentiments.' We have been losing our time and pain in trying to convince men ; that was very proper in the days of the apostles, when men wore</page><page sequence="60">i 56 ON EDUCATION. nearly all children; but it is folly now. Men now are grown men ; they will not listen, they cannot understand. It does not pay to furnish men with reasons—we must take to furnishing the pates of children. All our lessons to men about holding fast the faith seem only to loosen their grip of it. It is painful to see how regardless the men are becoming both of our precept and of our example. They see how cordially I and my brethren hate those other parties; how diligently we shun them, ignore their very existence, and take it for granted, in all our public and private life, that there are no real Christians but ourselves; and yet these men will mingle and act like friends and brothers in business and social enjoyment. In vain do we pen them up at church or chapel on Sundays, labouring to tone, to colour, and to starch them. They will run together over the six clays of the week "all of one tint, like milk and water, and the best starch we put into them on the Sunday will hardly stand ten minutes rain of God's perpetual and unsectarian mercies. Our Church's fate turns not on her power to convince grown men, but ' upon the hold she may have on the children.' Every man of us must gird himself to a desperate fight for these little ones; he must catch them, and keep them, and cram them well with reasons, ' before they slip altogether from our grasp!'" A Church, holding false or superstitious ideas of religion, how¬ ever alive to its duties and loving of its charge, is still but like a foolish and wrong-headed mother who spoils and ruins her children, and, instead of training them in the way they should go, trains them necessarily in the very ways they should avoid. The Church and the State should hold the same position in social organization as the love and intellect do in the human organization, mutually assisting, inspiring, and advancing each other's progress. Nor can one profitably exist and proceed without the other at all. Or, as the heart and lungs are to the individual body, so ought the State and Church be to the social body; as the blood is the life of the animal body, so is freedom the life of the social body, or body politic. The State should act like the heart, to keep this blood in constant circulation ; whilst the Church should act like the lungs, in keeping pure that blood of life, and enable man to breathe the air from heaven, and by free respiration give life and health to the whole body. The view generally taken by our clergy of what is called true reli¬ gious teaching is, that parents must be taught, and must be well con¬ tent to believe, that they well fulfil their religious duties when they submit their children to baptism, assemble once a week, or oftener, to worship God, as they say, by the repetition of stereotyped creeds and prayers, calling themselves miserable sinners, entreating God, as if he were a hardened tyrant, for mercy on their souls, par¬ taking occasionally of a little bread and wine, changed, by some inconceivable incantation, into human flesh and blood. It surely can be no essential, and but a very insignificant part only of man's religious duties, that is involved in such acts and observances If</page><page sequence="61">ON EDUCATION. 57 nothing more than these be thought of, men still leave every essential element of their religious duties undone. Men no mora serve God in any such ways than did the Jews of old, when they gave the fruit of their body for their sin, and passed their first-born sons through the fire to Moloch or Jehovah. Men appear, by such acts, to be more the creatures of emotion and imagination than of reason. Hence so much ceremony in every-day life, and so much rite and observance in religion, in their fellowship^ in their Sunday thoughts of God, in giving utterance to their hopes and fears, in liturgies, litanies, hymns, and formulate! creeds of various sorts and complexions. Too long has the world's motto been, "Every one for himself;" " Every cla3S for itself;" " Every sect for itself;" "Every nation for itself." The substitution of a practical for a merely theoretical religion or morality would lead to a very dif¬ ferent state of things. We should behold nations as one family, dwelling together in unity, and forming, as it were, a vast joint- stock company, in which the gain of one would be the gain of all. Something of this kind is already aimed at in the institution of the numerous mutual benefit and insurance societies which mark our age. To annihilate the antagonism between religious sects and classes, we must not do as the enthusiasts of a past age attempted to do, by arbitrarily proclaiming all men to be equal; but by so regulating society, that all should be interested in the welfare of all. That, with education and the means of obtaining support afforded to all, every man would be free to follow what¬ ever calling his inclination might lead him to, and occupy whatever place his genius might raise him to. An education, based upon sound principles of morality, will soon remove the old nonsense about labour not being "respectable." As the young- Australian adventurer answered the sneer of his oldest aristocratic brother, on his seeing and pointing to his box of tools, which he was going to take out with him, " Any tool or weapon that con¬ quers fate is noble in the hands of a brave man." Thus, you see, as it is in our artificial state of educated society, we make both ungentle, for the one was envying, and the other despising—each his brother. But every social evil, like the foregoing, practised by parents, may be traced to ignorance. Wherever is the intel¬ ligence, there will be the power, there the capital. Educate all, and it will soon flow into the hands of all. A sound system of education would do something to mitigate the inordinate craving for wealth. Less homage would bo paid to it. Men would cherish other and less selfish aims. A condition of society that would ensure industry against destitution, would cause mere wealth to be less an object of desire for the purpose of making a lasting- provision for a family. We are accustomed from childhood, in every possible way, to see property respected more than man. And, as if to foster this feeling, we imposed a high property quali¬ fication before a man could havo any voice in the formation of the very laws that govern him and his children. Wealth, however obtained, seldom fails to procure for its possessor respect. No</page><page sequence="62">58 ON EDUCATION. wonder, then, that so many scruple at nothing to obtain riches. To the Anglo-Saxon worship of wealth may be attributed, in a great measure, our national pre-eminence in crime against pro¬ perty. A proper education would tend to diminish this evil, by teaching children that there are other things far worthier of their chief regards; and that wealth is not an end in itself, but is only valuable as a power that can be used for good ends. Proper edu¬ cation would make children skilful, temperate, and frugal. But of the nature of this education, and of the persons by whom it at least cannot be given, something should be said. To those who hold that, while here, our duty lies here, and its reward also, it is clear that the education which is to fit children for the work of life, cannot be consistently entiusted to the charge of persons who consider the claims of a future state of existence as of more press¬ ing importance than those of the present. " Sufficient for the day " is a maxim of which they have not yet learnt the import. Not to dwell on the immorality of a view which involves contempt for this bounteous world, and ingratitude to Him who has placed it at our disposal, "to dress and to keep it," it is impossible that those to whom I am referring should be able to detach themselves from the associations which habit has ingrained upon their minds. Thus, the first esssential step to be taken, in regard to our national education, is to free it from all priestly influence and control. And this must be clone even if, in order to do it, it becomes necessary to sever the connection between the Church and the State. At the Church Congress held lately at Wolverhampton, the newly-appointed bishop of Rochester said, in an address to a meet¬ ing of working men, that " he had lamented for twenty-five long years, at Kidderminster, the absence of working men from the sorvices of the Church, owing to the natural disinclination of the human heart to hear that which is good,—to hear that by which salvation comes to the soul." What would be said of a doctor lamenting in such strain over the perversity of his patient's constitution, in refusing to agree with the drugs which he administered Should we not say, " Doctor, try some other treatment; it is for the medicine to suit the disease, and not the disease the medicine ?" And what of the doctor who should own that, for a quarter of a century, he had persisted in supplying dings that never were taken, and in accepting payment for the same And what, again, of the authorities that should interpret the doctor's failure to make his remedies acceptable to his patients as a proof of his skill, and thereupon promote him to a more important sphore Fortunate it is for humanity that its destinies are in other hands; that spiritual terror, spiritual pretension, and spiritual uifling, are alike doomed to disappear before the development of man's heart and brain; that the new regime of truth and justice, based upon the eternal law of human consciousness, is succeeding to the despotism of authority and falsehood. '</page><page sequence="63">ON EDUCATION. 59 How often do we hear it said, in derision, this or that man is a theorist, a sceptic, an idealist, and has no practical powers Is this prevalent impression correct Is the world of the senses the only world If we look deeper into this question, we shall find that the ideal world is the real, of which the vaunted real world is but the shadow. What are these realities? They are incarnations of ideas. Look at the ponderous engine Its bones are wrought of iron ; its sinews are of steel; its vital energy is fire. How perfectly it performs its work How wonderfully its parts are adjusted to each other! It is the very embodiment of the real and the prac¬ tical. Yet, what would it be without the thought that gave it birth A mass of inert metal, slumbering in the earth. Ideas have found expression in the length of that piston, in the form of those valves, in the polish of that cylinder, in the condensation of that steam, in the draught of that fire ; and from those ideas the engine has been actualized. Whether it be placed in the hull of a ship, or mounted on wheels to drag freighted cars with the speed of the wind, it once formed a part of the mind of its archi¬ tect. Before the iron of which it is formed is mined the machine exists in the mental world. The inventor plans and projects; and when he enters the shop, and by his hands builds after these plans, he but clothes, with iron, and steel, and brass, his ideal. What this machine does results from the amount of mind ho imparts to it. So far as it represents his idea, it is perfect; and so far as it does not, it is imperfect. The idea is its soul, which we discern when we examine its motions, clearly visible through the garb of metal. The boiler is tested at a certain prossure. We see the index move, and, if above that pressure, the steam escapes to restore the necessary equilibrium. The inert metal has life, it is intelligent, it relieves itself when endangered. Mind has fashioned it; it retains the skill of the moulding hand. The picture exists in the mind of the painter before he places it on canvas, and often with a force and beauty, an exquisiteness of outline, a brilliancy of colouring, which shames his very attempt at reproduction. Tho statue exists in the rnind of the sculptor before it is chi¬ selled in marble; and how often does he revile the unyielding stone! The ideas of universal brotherhood, floating in the atmosphere of the world, gather around a child born to a poor carpenter in Nazareth, and so destitute, they cradle him in a manger. When the child matures, he becomes possessed with tho idea of brotherly love. Ho scorns the inequality, injustice, and shams of the world. He believes in the universal applicability oi love, and that it is better to suffer wrong than to do wrong ; to do as we would be done by. You may ask, Is there power in these Ye3 ; there is power enough to overturn a world., and resurrect a new and glorious race. There is this singular peculiarity about the men who first receive</page><page sequence="64">60 ON EDUCATION. ideas—they cannot keep them. No sooner does the man perceive that he has a new idea, than he becomes impressed that he has a mission. The same power which gives him the idea fills him with an irresistible impulse to reveal it. Theie is growth in the human race, from infancy to manhood. The present is the age of dawning manhood. The baby-clothes (creeds, superstitions, traditions, dogmas) are fast being laid away in the world's lumber-room, with all the utensils .former genera¬ tions considered necessary for the government of the people. The rack, the gibbet, the gallows, the guillotine, horrid engines of torture, once thought requisite to maintain government, are cast off with the ignorance which prompted their use. The world to-day has outgrown its yestorday thoughts; and to-morrow will outgrow the best porfoimances of to-day. Each year adds growth to the moral and intellectual world, as the circling sun adds a new layer to the tree. Each year's growth encircles all others; or, in other words, the ideas of the race are higher, its attainments more noble, and it basks in a bright light. Each year adds to the moral and intellectual temperature of the mind; makes it glow with superior tnvth and wisdom. This growth, slow, but visible, is a progress as uncontrollable as the movement of the heavenly bodies around their central suns. Grown to manhood, tho infant garments cannot be strained on; and were it possible to force them on, they would cramp the free movement of the body, bind the limbs in stiff contortions, and destroy freedom and manliness. Creeds, dogmas, beliefs, and traditions, are such garments to the spirit. " While the refoimer would have mankind throw off the gar¬ ments of boyhood,—cast aside the top, the doll, and toy, which pacified its babyhood, and occupy its mind with manly things,— the conservative would compel it to wear its infant dress, clinging for safety to its leading stiings, and delight itself with gewgaws and tinsel. Even its new clothes must be cut after the old in¬ fantile pattern. But, despite the stoutness of the seams, human minds will grow." We lament the error, sin, and depravity, which exist, and justly too ; but we forget that there is a cause, and that cause—ignorance. Alas, for human ignorance It has immolated it myriad victims ; and still its all-devouring jaws are stretched wide with insatiable rapacity. It is the prolific cause of all crime, all degradation, all misery. It is an accepted tiuth that, if man perfectly obeyed every law of his moral, intellectual, and physical nature, he would be perfectly happy, perfectly free from all pain, unnatural desires, and sufferings. He obeys not, because he is ignorant. Give him knowledge upon these great subjects, and he would do better in proportion to the light he receives. Pour a flood of wisdom into the world, so much that every bye lane and every alley shall be filled, and evil will expire. Error, sin, and evil, are the results of subjecting ourselves to other laws than those of our normal being. If we sufficiently understood these laws, we should never suffer</page><page sequence="65">ON EDUCATION. 61 from them. The child, before it learns the nature of physical matter, is delighted with the brilliant flame, reaches forth its tender hand to grasp the glittering object, and is burnt. Hence¬ forth it understands the relations of heat to its physical frame,— that it causes intense pain,—and avoids it, however much it glit¬ ters. Man, taken collectively, has been a child. When first an inhabitant of the globe, a rude savage, totally unacquainted with the material universe and its controlling laws, he was surrounded by darkness, and was compelled to walk empirically. Like the child, attracted by brilliant objects he strove to obtain, perhaps finding them useful in supplying his wants, perhaps causing him intense suffering. In either case, he discovered their nature, and the relations they sustained to him. By degrees the light dawned; fact after fact was learned, law after law deduced; until he knew the general bearing he sustained to the world of which he is a part. Sir John Coleridge, our solicitor-general, was right when he informed the House, during the great debate on May 11th in last year, that this Bible question promised shortly to become the great religious question of the time. It is so ; not for the reason he then anticipated, but because the Bible, or, rather, the popular theory about the Bible, stops the way to our advance in all that favours the redemption, or constitutes the highest good, of a people. By reason of this one impediment our whole system of national education " hangs fire ;" while our systems of private education are neutralised or vitiated. And, again, to tax any - people, or apply any public monies to the promotion or repression of any such theoretical opinions or teaching, is a sheer misappro¬ priation of such public revenue. It is an injustice to apply funds, belonging to the whole community, to promote opinions opposed, by a sensible and intelligent portion of it; opinions which no one can pretend to rest on the suffrage of mankind at large. A leading object of the State, in providing education, is to pre¬ vent crime ; partly by fitting children for honest industry, and partly by teaching them duty and its foundations. The higher their virtue and their intelligence, the more valuable citizens do they become. To abound in such citizens is the highest wealth of a State. The education required is one which will cultivate the reason and judgment concerning the laws of life, will store the memory with knowledge undeniably valuable, will impart noble tastes, will train to useful art, and, as far as may be, to good habits and disposition. No rational man among us can doubt that children, thus educated, are likely to discharge their duties better as men and women. Such is true national education. No system of education can be called national, or is entitled to the support of the state, which does not act impartially to all large masses of its citizens In a community distracted by sects, to teach in the public schools the tenets of one sect, is not equal justice; but must ever lead to endless jealousy, bickering, and indignation. Instead of promoting national harmony it sedulously</page><page sequence="66">62 ON EDUCATION. provides for discontent, and disentegrates national sentiment; so that, instead of a united nation, there is but a congeries of hostile sects. If sectarian religions must exist, it is of urgent interest to the State to secure that their controversy shall not enter the arena of public life, and introduce animosity into the State itself; but shall be fought out on a separate field. It is needless to discuss what would be just, if ninety-nine out of one-hundred in every grade of a community were of one religion ; for we evidently are daily drifting farther and farther from such a condition. In Ireland, Scotland, and Wales, the adherents of the Church by law established are in a very decided minority, varying from one-fourth to one-sixth. In England the Dissenters far out-number the church-goers; and among the chuich-goers a host of the most intelligent have no belief in the church dogmas, which no layman has to sign; while among the clergy who do sign them, there are notoriously three great sects, visibly hostile and irreconcilable. While such is the condition of a people, to allow religious dogmas to be taught in the week-day public schools is not a truly national, but is strictly a sectarian and unjust system. The first duty of the State is justice to all its members; and they ill recommend their religion who refuse justice to any. We believe that strict justice in this matter is alone compatible with true religion. It is often urged in favour of this sectarian system, that it is not rigidly carried out; children are exempted from the religious teaching, if parents disapprove ; but the plea is a palliation, not a justification ; it is a virtual confession of error and impropriety. Again, to afford grants to denominational schools, and plead that the money is not to be applied to the sectarian religious teaching, but to general purposes, is an evasion; for the money goes into the same purse, and as effectually piomotes the dogmatic teaching, as if it were avowedly paid for it. Hence it is not too severe to say that the money is obtained under false pretences. Public education ought to train children to become good citizens, without reference to any ecclesiastical system whatever. To such systems the State should be wholly indifferent; they are private to the members who compose them. We all contribute to the support of the State ; we all are equally citizens. Our respective religious opinions are matter of private concei n to each. If any new sect is deficient in the material aids for teaching its religion, to expect the State to supply the aid would be exclaimed against as monstious by the members of the privileged church themselves. This is to avow that they themselves rest on privileges, not on equal justice. For my part, I think better of my countrymen than to believe, that when once the truth is put plainly before them they will long halt between two opinions. I belie-^e that when once the alternative is shown to them to lie between gross superstition and a rational religiousness, they will no longer endure that their faith be only definable, as believing what they know to be untiue ; but will insist on their children being trained to subject all things to the test of a cultivated intelligence and moral sense. From henceforth the</page><page sequence="67">ON EDUCATION. 63 teacher in the schools of the nation must never forget that it is the purpose of his school-room to be the training ground, not of any party or sect, but whereon to develope the faculties which later in life are to determine the nature of individual belief. To impart a bias, or to anticipate or prevent the formation of genuine honest opinion, by the early instilment of dogma, is at once to stultify every principle of sound education, inasmuch as it is to repress the intellect and contravene the moral sense. Whatever th.e views which may be adopted in mature age by those who have been educated under the system I am advocating, there will be no cause to fear that they will be the worst for being founded in an in¬ telligence and moral sense which have been thus rigidly trained in youth. At present, for us in England, the issue lies with our school-boards ; if their members are themselves ignorant of the simple law of human development in religious ideas, or are un¬ worthily complacent to the ignorance and superstition of their con¬ stituents, generations may pass before the standard of education and religion is brought up to the standard of modern thought and knowledge. Generations may pass and the Bible will still be found the subject of hopeless contention, and the source of fatal dis¬ union and weakness. And generations long hereafter will find the country sunk deeper and deeper in ignorance and barbarism ; while the nations which have sprung from our race, and speak our language, will have passed so far ahead of us that they can only look back upon "poor England" with pity and contempt, as an effete and imbecile kingdom, " whose prophets prophesied falsely, whose priests bore rule by their means, and whose people loved to have it so." " Cease your drowsy disputations, Ye who'd preach the Word divine, Pouring out your turbid waters, When we thirst for living wine. Speak the truth as if you meant it, And would turn the wrong to right; Not as if you half denied it, And mistook the dark for light. "Deeds of love and thoughts of reason, Now must onward in the van; Olden creeds are out of season, Science clears the way for man. Cast delusion from your senses, Dare to look for purer light; Creedal fears are priestly fences Barring up the road to right.
