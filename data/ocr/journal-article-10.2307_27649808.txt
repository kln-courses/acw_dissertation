<plain_text><page sequence="1">LISA JEAN MOORE'S SPERM COUNTS: OVERCOME BY MAN'S MOST PRECIOUS FLUID, NEW YORK: NEW YORK UNIVERSITY PRESS, 2007 ELROI J.WINDSOR In Sperm Counts, Lisa Jean Moore explores how Western culture has made sense of sperm, examining the abundant oppositional constructions of "man's most precious fluid" as creator/destroyer, hero/villain, erotic/ toxic, and powerful/disempowering. Using varied sources for informa tion, Moore argues that cultural meanings of sperm reveal important information about men, masculinity, and related social issues. Moore bases her analysis on fifteen years of research. She relays infor mation obtained through working on the board of a sperm bank and from interviews with sex workers. She also analyzes the content of foren sics and criminal texts, children's facts-of-life books, pornographic film and the industry's news review, crime drama television shows, and DNA sleuth sites. This impressive collection of information illustrates sperm's social manifestations within family, law, science, media, and commercial sex arenas. In this investigation, Moore links cultural understandings of sperm to more complicated notions of manhood and masculinity. Throughout the book, she is reflexive in her role as a researcher and pep pers her account with interesting personal stories. She employs a straight forward writing style that makes the book accessible to both academic and popular audiences. Moore begins her study of sperm by contextualizing it historically, tracing its evolution as a cellular identity able to be studied. She reviews the Western origin of sperm in religious and scientific discourse and relays how these accounts mirrored notions of masculinity. She describes how sperm-competition theories situated men as wholly responsible for sexual reproduction. She then examines how anthropomorphic and heroic depictions of sperm in children's facts-of-life books carefully instill nor mative values in children. The book includes vivid illustrations that exemplify how these story lines indoctrinate stereotypical gender in chil dren's socialization. The most fascinating chapter in Sperm Counts is Moore's examination [WSQ: Women s Studies Quarterly 36: 3 &amp; 4 (Fall/Winter 2008)] ? 2008 by ElroiJ. Windsor.

Moore juxtaposes the glori fication of sperm in pornography with the intense management of semen in prostitution. She interrogates the significance of the revered "money shot" in pornography and posits compelling explanations for the idoliza tion of ejaculation. She considers how heterosexual men incorporate this cinematic feature into their erotic repertoires, arguing that the glamoriza tion of ejaculation is a marketable feature that responds to cultural depic tions of semen as dangerous, disgusting, and taboo and that men are assuaged through depictions of women who cherish it. Moore analyzes another, contrasting aspect of commercial sex by reviewing the ways sex workers treat semen as hazardous yet also employ creative strategies to avoid compromising their customers' masculinity in the process. She then shifts her analysis to a different economic aspect of semen?the sperm banking industry. Here, Moore argues that sperm banks reify hegemonic masculinity by imbuing disembodied sperm with desirable characteristics. She discusses how the selling of "technosemen" (107) to single-mothers by-choice has inspired fatherhood rights groups to reassert men's roles in the reproductive process?a contemporary response to a masculinity in crisis. The final analysis examines traces of semen identified through DNA testing technology. With sophisticated theoretical grounding, Moore demonstrates the ways sperm and the men who leak it are constructed negatively. She contrasts fictional representations of sperm on crime television dramas with real-life DNA sleuthing sites. She convincingly argues that the clinical authority of DNA testing laboratories functions to individualize and rank sperm, subjecting the male body to increased surveillance. Matching sperm to criminal or "bad" men serves to subor dinate the masculinities of sexually dysfunctional men. Moore concludes that "sperm is at the same time more interesting, complicated, and spe cialized, and yet more accessible, programmable, d?ployable, and pre dictable than ever before" (147). Finally, she imagines future problems and possibilities with advances in sperm technology and how these might affect masculinity. While the book is comprehensive in many ways, including Moore's in-depth analyses of sperm within numerous cultural forms, some ques tions remain unanswered. Moore acknowledges that her account does not examine "what sperm means to men" (162). She presents a wealth of evidence, but directly engaging the men who produce sperm would have</page><page sequence="3">WINDSOR 323 enriched the project. For example, when sperm donors are rejected, do they feel emasculated? How might sperm buyers interpret banking cata logs, and how do they prioritize the characteristics listed? For men who struggle with fertility, what techniques do they use to enhance their sperm and how do they appreciate these processes? How do infertile men redefine manhood? In pornography, is semen stratified wherein actors are rewarded for longer, denser, and more powerful ejaculations? Do men who partner with men view sperm differently from men who partner with women? How do race, class, age, and other social markers affect associations between semen and masculinity? Additionally, how do trans gender men and women position semen within their constructions of gendered embodiment? Certainly, Moore could produce another com pelling account that addresses these issues?possibly even as a companion book to Sperm Counts?to complement her analysis. Incorporating men's perspectives and lived experiences within another feminist study would offer a more well-rounded understanding of masculinity and gendered embodiment. Overall, Sperm Counts is an important work that expands gender stud ies both theoretically and empirically. Moore's research supports concepts generated in masculinities studies and contributes to social understandings of the sexual body. This book engages readers with enlightening perspec tives on a previously undertheorized aspect of the male body. ELROI J.
