<plain_text><page sequence="1">ECLECTICISM AND THE CARRACCI: FURTHER REFLECTIONS ON THE VALIDITY OF A LABEL By Denis Mahon In grateful memory of Professor Saxi n Part IV of my book Studies in Seicento Art and Theory' I attempted to trace, step by step, the literary ancestry of that conception of the art of the Carracci which only attained full development in the nineteenth century. My main conclusion was roughly along the following lines: a number of early interpretations, varied in origins and often limited in scope, tended to coalesce and eventually gained a disproportionate lease of life as a consequence of their gradual transformation in character, during the course of a very long period, into elaborate and systematic doctrines presumed to have been actually professed by the artists concerned. Though my historical analysis of this process met with a considerable measure of agreement,2 familiar views with an aura of orthodoxy are never very easy to discard, and Professor Rensselaer W. Lee, in reviewing my book in a generous manner in The Art Bulletin, took the opportunity to restate the traditional case at considerable length.3 Some clarifications of my standpoint on certain specific questions which he raised, together with a general indication of the radical differences in our respective methods of approach, will be found in a later issue of the same periodical ;* on the present occasion I wish to examine in detail a number of major issues which Professor Lee has brought into the foreground, but which I had been content, for the most part, merely to hint at in my book. Naturally I should not dream of claiming that my conclusions are in any way the last word on the subject; instead, I should be more than rewarded if it were to become clear that certain Seicento problems, hitherto scarcely envisaged by the non-specialist, do effectively exist, and that they deserve careful study and the fullest dis- cussion. I The Scope of this Essay Our principal justification for considering at some length what the early sources have to say on the subject of the paintings of the Carracci must be that the investigation has appreciable relevance to our own understanding of them to-day, both historically and critically. And this is not merely because familiarity with the artistic milieu within which a painter had to work often serves as a useful corrective to the more imaginative flights of criticism, but because our own reactions towards an artistic product of former ages inevitably take colour, more or less unconsciously, from what has been said on the matter during the course of time. Consciousness of this lengthy process of building up a critical picture of an artist's work brings consciousness of another fact-that 1 London, 1947 (Studies of the Warburg Insti- tute, No. I6). 2 For example, R. Wittkower, The Drawings of the Carracci in the Collection of Her Majesty the Queen at Windsor Castle, London, 1952, p. 9. 3 The Art Bulletin, XXXIII, 1951, pp. 204- 212. When Professor Lee's opinions are noted hereafter it can be assumed that the reference is to this publication; the questions with which we are concerned occupy pp. 208-212, more than half the review. 4 Denis Mahon, "Art Theory and Artistic Practice in the Early Seicento: Some Clarifi- cations," in the September 1953 issue of The Art Bulletin (XXXV, pp. 226-232). 303</page><page sequence="2">304 DENIS MAHON writings on art have a history of their own, a semi-autonomous internal development. In any given instance there is an interplay between the indi- vidual writer's experience of the work of art and the influence (sometimes even the demands) of the then contemporary climate in art literature, whether general or particular; on occasion the impulse from this climate becomes so strong that the criticism can almost be left to write itself without any very intimate acquaintance with the work of art in question. At the period with which we are concerned1 the art of writing about art was, in a technical sense, in its infancy. The reach of the few writers who concerned themselves with the subject was greatly limited by current literary conventions, by strong influence from the relatively more flourishing and developed criticism of poetry and the drama, and by the philosophical beliefs of the time (with all that this implies). To put it in another way, the youthful discipline leant heavily on its parents, and was content to rely upon them for its general concepts; these latter, with their robust capacity for survival, offered a sense of secure orthodoxy and of continuity. The result was, how- ever, that the more formal dissertations on art became something of an abstraction from artistic realities; one is with good reason liable to feel that considerable passages were born in the library and have much more to do with the printed page than with brushes and paint. Nevertheless there is usually another side to the medal: the frequent presence, however haphazard and disjointed, of a practical element, which originates from contact with actual paintings and in which preconceived theory often takes a back seat. And there is much more that is revealing and significant about this informal type of criticism (usually springing from the consideration of isolated though concrete artistic problems, or that of specific works of art or artists) than those impressive-but artistically irrelevant-general formulae which were passed on fromn writer to writer until they came to be politely taken for granted. I am of course well aware that the contrast just outlined is, as it stands, a gross simplification, but it does serve roughly to characterize the marked dichotomy which is a regular and essential feature of writings on art at this period, and which faces us with constant difficulties of interpretation when we wish to consider the important issue of the precise relationship of the artist's brush to the written word.2 The very real problem of reaching a sensible balance in this matter differs from case to case, but is apt to be com- plex, involving not only a knowledge of the literary raw materials which a given writer had ready to his hand, but also an understanding of him both as an individual and as one who wrote within the context of a very specific historical moment.3 The type of question which naturally poses itself is of the following order. To what extent did such and such a passage come into existence as a result of literary, or artistic, or historiographical, or religious or other exigencies? Are we to read it in a strictly literal sense from the point of view of art-theory? And so on. 1 We shall confine our textual investiga- tions to the period before Bellori (1672). 2In the sense, of course, of explicit or im- plicit art theory or criticism. 3 The latter qualification is all the more necessary at the end of the Cinquecento and the beginning of the Seicento because the artistic situation at that juncture was in a state of continuous and rapid transformation.</page><page sequence="3">ECLECTICISM AND THE CARRACCI 305 The present writer believes that in the case of the Carracci the critico- historical tradition has become a serious obstacle to understanding and that a rigorous re-examination of it is overdue. What follows is offered as a contri- bution towards two aspects of this re-examination. The first, an amplification of what I have already said on the subject in my book, is concerned with the written evidence purporting to document the proposition that, as a matter of historical fact, the Carracci themselves actually professed what the nineteenth century came to refer to as their eclectic' doctrine. Since the principal theme of the relevant section of my book was the continuity and perpetuation of the idea over a long period, I had concentrated on the notorious sonnet falsely attributed to Agostino Carracci, the reason being that it was destined (on account of its condensed and readily quotable character) to become the back- bone of later repetitions. The two other main items bearing upon this aspect, Faberio's orazione and the Carracci postille, having been only touched upon in passing, call for a more detailed treatment on the present occasion, and I hope to make it clear why I believe that they yield no evidence of any solid value in favour of the alleged doctrine. The second aspect is concerned with the problem of whether or not early interpretations of the Carracci are to be read at the present time in a way in which the nineteenth century would undoubtedly have read them, that is, as reflections of the advocacy by the artists of a theoretical programme the reliable documentation of which had come, by repetition, to be regarded as unquestioned. This unquestioning acceptance of what is obviously a funda- mental proposition for the argument had been arrived at by a slow and markedly artificial process of "literary" construction which I attempted to outline in my book, to which I must refer the reader; it must suffice to say here that any serious investigation of its chequered evolution, with arbitrary additions continually grafted on here and there as time passed, can hardly inspire confidence in the factual value of the conclusion reached. Yet, once the bona fide existence of satisfactory evidence documenting the profession of the doctrine came to be taken for granted, it is easy to see how various casual and disjointed early characterizations of the Carracci came to be read in the light of that assumption. Having questioned the whole basis of the assumption, I shall then seek to show that these interpretations of the Carracci, being explicable in a variety of ways which have no real resemblance to the nine- teenth century concept, cannot reasonably2 be employed to resurrect the latter in the absence of what had been taken (erroneously, as it turns out) to be its factual foundations. Furthermore it will appear that there are reasons for declining to believe that anything in the nature of a full-blown theory of eclecticism was a real, live issue during the period between the mid-Cinque- cento and the mid-Seicento. Indeed it was only in the nineteenth century that, for a number of reasons which cannot be entered into here, the theory of the theory (if we may call it so) reached fully articulated formulation. The result of this event was that thereafter the temptation frequently arose 1 The reader may be reminded that I drew attention in my book to the fact that the actual expression "eclectic" was first intro- duced by Winckelmann as late as 1763. 2 Provided that we are agreed on the neces- sity for a rather more critical attitude towards reading the sources than that which obtained during the nineteenth century.</page><page sequence="4">306 DENIS MAHON (and was almost as frequently succumbed to) of reading the accepted though unsubstantiated theory back into the works of art themselves, which, as soon as the idea had become sufficiently familiar, could then be cited as evidence that the theory must, after all, have existed! The ever-present possibility that, consciously or unconsciously, this process may be what has occurred in any given case is a constant weakness when the expression "eclectic" is used as a modern critical term in connexion with the paintings of the Carracci; in other words, the question often arises, how much can the actual critique itself be regarded as in essence derivative? At this stage the interpretation of the written sources, which is our main concern in this essay, withdraws into the background; but, since there is still constant confusion between the applica- tion of the term to passages in the sources and its modern use in direct con- nexion with the works of art, we shall conclude with some necessarily brief comments on the latter subject. II Faberio's Funeral Oration The flourishing existence of a conventional literary formula, whereby praise was conferred on an artist by alleging the presence in his work of certain outstanding qualities which had become associated with particular great names in the past,1 seemed to me to be pertinent to any assessment of the true character (and consequently the value for historical purposes) of the cardinal passage in the oration of the letterato Lucio Faberio which was delivered on the occasion of Agostino Carracci's funeral in I602 and printed in the com- memorative booklet of 1603.2 The passage in question, it must be pointed out, is the only strictly contemporary reference which is susceptible of the (in my view, mistaken) interpretation that the Carracci advocated a theoretical doctrine which could be characterized as "eclectic." I made it clear in my book3 that I regarded Faberio's remarks as having (here I cannot improve on Professor Lee's summary, op. cit., p. 211 ) "the effusiveness and rhetorical imprecision of a well-disposed letterato who is doing a set piece for a public occasion." Professor Lee agrees with my estimate, but nevertheless adds that in his opinion Faberio's words "reflect his personal view, based on association with the Carracci and first-hand knowledge of their works, that the [eclectic] doctrine was made manifest in the paintings of Agostino" (loc. cit.). Although I mentioned Lomazzo as a possible source for Faberio's observa- tions, I treated their provenance in a somewhat vague and general way in my book; the present occasion, however, provides a welcome opportunity for making good this deficiency. There is, in fact, evidence which points to the conclusion that Faberio, on being allotted the task of preparing his laudatory discourse, very understandably took down Lomazzo's Trattato from the shelf, and glanced through it in search of some suggestive turns of phrase. He came 1 For further remarks on this eulogistic cliche', see my book (e.g., pp. 205 f.) and my article in The Art Bulletin (XXXV, 1953, pp. 230 f.). 2 I pointed out in my book (p. 135, note 86) that this publication was well known during the Seicento. 3 Studies in Seicento Art and Theory, p. 137, note 91, and p. 205.</page><page sequence="5">ECLECTICISM AND THE CARRACCI 307 across a passage which provided what he sought, and proceeded to lift it out of its context and adapt it with considerable ingenuity to suit his particular purpose-that of working up a clever climax in his funeral eulogy of Agostino. In other words, I should maintain that the evidence which I propose to adduce throws light on the real character of the section under discussion of Faberio's oration, which turns out to have all the air of a deliberately ad hoc literary construction of patently artificial type. I now quote those sections of the passage in question in Lomazzo's Trattato which appear to me most clearly to demonstrate Faberio's literary debt to his predecessor 1 [Page 437] 1Io non h6 mai ritrovato che alcuno che habbi seguito l'orma 6 l'essempio d'un'altro lo habbia potuto agguagliare non che avvanzare.

La qual cosa e molto difficile, ancor'che appresso a molti sia stato facile; si come appresso il nostro Fontana,2 ilquale h' eletto la ma [page 438] niera piU bella de' panni, &amp; de' nudi che si sia giamai potuto eleggere, e cosi con facilith va ritrahendo, &amp; scolpendo le figure fuori della sua idea " lui facile, &amp; " gl'altri difficile; e come parimenti appresso de gl'altri il Ficino nostro discepolo ilquale con simile prudenza, &amp; industria di molte altre parti le sue rare pitture v" componendo con parte de l'ombre lumi, &amp; d'accuratezze di Leonardo, con le maesta armonice di Raffaello, con i vaghi colori del Coregio, e co'l dissegno d'intorno di Michel'Angelo perseverando cosi con tali parti a disponere in opera quello che secondo il suo genio particolare concepisce nella mente, come si vede trt le altre in una tavola dove ha dipinto la Vergine co'l figliuolo apresso che calca con un piede il collo dell'antico serpente, laquale si ritrova nella Chiesa di Santo Fedele di Milano.3 The related passage from Lucio Faberio's funeral oration reads as follows :4 [Agostino Carracci] considerava non essersi mai ritrovato alcuno, che ponendosi per ultimo fine l'imitare l'essempio d'un'altro l'habbia potuto pareggiar, non che avanzare. Se 1 Giovanni Paolo Lomazzo, Trattato dell'arte della pittura, scoltura, et architettura, Milan, 1584, PP. 437-8. For brevity's sake I do not propose to enter into a discussion of the passage from Lomazzo's own angle, since this is not relevant to the point being made. 2 The Milanese sculptor Annibale Fontana (1540-1587), Lomazzo's compatriot and con- temporary. 3 Whether Lomazzo actually saw this pic- ture by his principal pupil Giovanni Ambrogio Figino (x548-i608) is perhaps not absolutely certain, since (as far as I am aware) it is not documentarily dated, and Lomazzo, who was born in April 1538, lost his sight when he had just completed his thirty-second year, which would be in 1571 (cf. dedication in his Idea, pp. 538-9 of his Rime, and p. 299 of his Trattato). Figino would then have been hardly 23 years of age. 4 Ilfunerale d'Agostin Carracciofatto in Bologna sua patria da gl'Incaminati Academici del Disegno scritto all'Ill.mo et R.mo Sig.r Cardinal Farnese, Bologna, 1603, p. 40.

I can hardly believe that it is necessary to analyse these two passages in detail in order to bring out Faberio's dependence on what Lomazzo had written,1 and the skilful way, from the literary point of view, in which he has modified the raw material at his disposal with a view to satisfying the require- ments of a given situation-the provision of an impressive funeral eulogy for an eminent artist. While Lomazzo is inconsequential, shifts his ground, and loses the thread of the discussion, Faberio naturally centres the whole argu- ment on Agostino and tightens it up with deft craftsmanship. The whole performance announces itself as an expert technical job by a professional writer. Yet we are seriously invited to credit that a passage of this character must faithfully mirror the real artistic opinions of Agostino! And we are con- cerned here-it must again be emphasized-with the crucial foundation stone on which a portentous written tradition was built up over the centuries. The importance of Faberio's little publication in relation to the problem of the Carracci (and also, it may be added, in relation to the development of the classic-idealist point of view in art-theory) is all the greater in that it provides a striking, and indeed almost cautionary, example of the way in which what could be taken to pass for theory of the practice of art had in actual fact a stubborn continuity and independent growth of its own, strongly literary in character and often quite distinct from what was really going on in the studios. III The Carracci "Postille" "I1 Signor Vasari non s'accorge che l'antichi buoni maestri hanno cavate le cose loro dal vivo, e vuol piutosto che sia buon artista dalle seconde cose 1 When referring in my book (pp. 136 ff.) to Faberio's role in the history of classic- idealist theory, I omitted to note that a key passage relating to the correction of nature is evidently also lifted from Lomazzo. In the same section of the latter's Trattato, only a few pages earlier than the passage we have just quoted, appears the following (op. cit., p. 433): "Con tal arte si vengono gentilmente a dis- simolare, &amp; ricoprire le imperfettioni, &amp; i mancamenti della natura, &amp; accrescere, &amp; ampliare le buone parti, &amp; le bellezze." Faberio's rendering is (Il Funerale, p. 37): [Agostino Carracci] "Dissimulava, &amp; rico- priva con arte, e con si gentil maniera l'im- perfettioni, e le mancanze della natura, sempre accrescendo le bellezze, che non si poteva desiderar meglio."</page><page sequence="7">ECLECTICISM AND THE CARRACCI 309 che sono l'antiche, che da le prime e principalissime, che son le vive, le quali si debbono sempre imitare, ma costui non intese quest'arte." This is not a pronouncement of Caravaggio, as one might be excused from deducing from its content, but one of those marginal notes to Vasari's Vite which afford such a striking insight into the atmosphere of the Carracci studio in its Bolognese days.1 In the postille one may find the frank reactions of Annibale or Agostino set down spontaneously and with complete lack of formality.2 From these brief and haphazard observations we get a vivid impression of strong likes and dislikes. Carracci is an adherent above all of the Venetian tradition as against that of Tuscany and Rome, the disegno of which he considers to be overvalued. Too much study of anatomy and the antique comes in for censure, and the rules of the Florentine painters are dismissed as odiose. On the other hand several Venetian painters receive praise, including especially "questo Paolino" [Veronese], "il quale io ho conosciuto e visto le bell'opere sue," adding "era degno che si scrivesse delle sue lode un gran volume." But, though he does not deny the excellence of Michelangelo and Raphael, it is Titian whom he admires above all others as the greatest of artists. Carracci waxes indignant over Vasari's insinuations that Titian had something to learn from Rome and Florence, from the antique, and from Michelangelo and Raphael;3 he is obviously of the opinion that the latter were outstripped in several respects by his hero, whose naturalism is singled out as especially praiseworthy. We may examine two instances which throw particular light on Carracci's opi: ions. The first is related to Vasari's celebrated story of his visit in the company of Michelangelo to see Titian's Danai'. After having taken their leave of Titian, says Vasari,4 ragionandosi del fare di Tiziano il Buonarruoto lo comend6 assai, dicendo che molto gli piaceva il colorito suo, e la maniera; ma che era un peccato, che a Vinezia non s'imparasse da principio a disegnare bene; e che no[n] havessono que' pittori miglior modo nello studio. Conciosia (diss'egli) che se quest'huomo fusse pu[n]to aiutato dall'arte, e dal disegno, come ? dalla natura, e massimamente nel contrafare il vivo, non si potrebbe far piu, ne meglio, 1 The postille were published by Dr. Hein- rich Bodmer in II Vasari, Rivista d'Arte e di Studi Cinquecenteschi, X, 1939, PP. 89-I28. The extract quoted above (and previously quoted in my book, p. I99, note 7) appears on pp. I09 f., and the relative passage in the second volume of the 1568 edition of Vasari is on p. 8o6, line I (ed. Milanesi, VII, p. 427, line i). 2These notes were described in I627 as being by both Annibale and Agostino. As individual responsibility for them cannot be established unless and until the original volume is discovered, and since the question as to which of the two brothers was concerned makes no material difference to our argu- ment, I propose to use the family name alone. Dr. Bodmer believed that Agostino rather than Annibale was responsible, and there is doubtless much to be said for the hypothesis. But if Agostino did write them he was probably off his guard; a fluent talker, he enjoyed posing as a letterato, and it may be that in his literary incarnation he could have excogitated theories which he would hardly have set serious store by as a painter and about which Annibale (a very different char- acter) would certainly have permitted him- self a good deal of sarcastic fun. In the passages which concern us, however, there is no pose of any kind, and the writer's comments have the same spontaneity and directness which we should expect from Annibale. 3 Carracci makes a characteristic comment on the impressionistic technique of Titian's late works (op. cit., p. I15): "Avvertasi che Titiano non imparo a far di queste cose n6 a Roma ne a Firenze, dove non si vedono cose cosi fatte, n6 si bene intese." 4 Giorgio Vasari, Vite, 1568, p. 813 of the second volume (otherwise Vol. II of Part III); ed. Milanesi, VII, pp. 447 f.</page><page sequence="8">310o DENIS MAHON havendo egli bellissimo spirito, e una molto vaga e vivace maniera. Et in fatti cosi 6 vero, percioche chi non ha disegnato assai, e studiato cose scelte antiche, o moderne, non puo fare bene di pratica da se, ne aiutare le cose, che si ritranno dal vivo, dando loro quella grazia, e perfezzione, che da l'arte, fuori dell'ordine della natura, la quale fa ordinariame[n]te alcune parti che non son belle. In this passage, it may be observed, there is a sufficiently clear reference to the theory of the correction of nature, a version of which Faberio (as we have already had occasion to notex) had lifted from Lomazzo and fathered upon Agostino Carracci. Our postillatore, however, shows no signs of acknow- ledging the supposed relationship and rushes to the defence of the naturalistic Titian:2 Io sono sicuro che Titiano per vedere le cose dei pittori di Roma n? per alcuna altra ragione si perda d'animo, ma il Vasari non conobbe la bontd della pittura di Titiano. Non somigliano le cose di Titiano a quelle di Michelangelo e quindi non gli piacquero interamente, ma sono queste che paiono vive. II Vasari s'intende che di s? stesso, che bestia. Of special interest in our context are Carracci's reactions to the passage in which Vasari records as follows a conversation with Sebastiano del Piombo about Titian:3 E mi ricordo, che fra Bastiano del Piombo . . . mi disse, che se Tiziano in quel tempo [sc., early in his career] fusse stato a Roma, &amp; havesse veduto le cose di Michelagnolo, quelle di Raffaello, e le statue antiche: &amp; havesse studiato il disegno, harebbe fatto cose stupen- dissime, vedendosi la bella pratica, che haveva di colorire, e che meritava il vanto d'essere a tempi nostri il piu bello, e maggiore imitatore della natura, nelle cose de' colori: che egli harebbe nel fondamento del gran disegno aggiunto all'Urbinate, e al Buonarruoto. Carracci comments :4 Fra Bastiano fu discepolo di Michelangelo sia detto con pace dei michelagnolisti. Titiano fu pid di Michelangelo et a quella guisa vi fu differenza qual fuvvi fra Dante el Petrarca, non derogando per6 all'eccellenza di Michelangelo, e se bene Raffaello fu da preporre in qualche parte a Titiano, avanz6 non meno anche Titiano in molte cose Raffaello. It would have been difficult to select a better passage in Vasari to provide Carracci with a pretext (not to say an invitation) to make some enlightening comment on his supposed "eclectic" theory. We are, however, faced by the same sort of embarrassing situation which arises when an actor fails to take his cue. Instead, Carracci's remarks are full of straightforward common sense. Hlie discounts Sebastiano's view as biased by the fact that the latter was a renegade Venetian who had become a partisan of Michelangelo, and makes it clear that in his own opinion Titian was an exceptional painter in his own right and had no lessons to learn from Rome. Moreover he is well aware of the fundamental differences which exist between the greatest masters in the matter of approach and aims. This is a point of some importance; indeed, x Cf. note I, p. 308 above. 2 Op. dit., pp. I113 f.- 3 Giorgio Vasari, Vite, 1568, p. 807 of the second volume (otherwise Vol. II of Part III); ed.

IV The "Disegno-Colore" Schism In 1550 Vasari published in Florence the first edition of his Vite, the general form of which is an impressive edifice in which art is shown evolving to its culmination in Michelangelo. Living artists (other than Michelangelo himself) are only mentioned in passing, and Titian, though praised, is merely allotted a few lines at the end of the life of Giorgione.x Only two years previously Paolo Pino had published in Venice his small Dialogo, in which he makes it clear that in his opinion the two supreme artists are Michelangelo and Titian,2 characterizing the field in which Michelangelo held supremacy as that of disegno, and Titian that of colore.a By 1557 Lodovico Dolce had taken up, on behalf of Titian and the Venetian point of view, the tacit challenge of Vasari's Florentine interpretation of artistic excellence.4 It is true that Dolce's objec- tions to the supremacy of Michelangelo probably echo the views of his close friend Pietro Aretino (whose personal relations with Michelangelo had become strained), and that Dolce advances the claims of Raphael as against those of Vasari's hero; but the significant feature from our point of view is that Titian (for whom Aretino had real understanding and admiration) is characterized as the equal, and in some respects the superior, of both, and indeed Titian's name figures in the very title of the book.5 His qualities are described with a touch of evident sympathy,6 though we observe that a version of our familiar formula is employed in order to praise his 'Assunta,' the perfection of which, Dolce points out, was attained without a -;sit to Rome.8 By 1568, the date of publication of the second and revised edition of his Vite, we find Vasari on the 1 Giorgio Vasari, Vite, 1550, p. 581I. 2Paolo Pino, Dialogo di Pittura, 1548, fol. 24 recto: ".. . questi duo li tengo, come Dei, &amp; come capi de pittori." 3 Pino, op. cit., fol. 24 recto f.: ". . . se Titiano, &amp; Michiel Angelo fussero un corpo solo, over al disegno di Michiel Angelo aggio[n]tovi il colore di Titiano, se gli potrebbe dir lo dio della pittura, si come pari- menti sono ancho dei propri..." 4 Lodovico Dolce, Dialogo della Pittura, Venice, 1557.

He cannot deny the excellence of Titian, but qualifies his praise with certain objections (which, as we have seen, were eventually to arouse Carraccesque indignation). Obviously the whole issue had become a very live one, under the rough and ready banners of disegno (which came to have connotations of both subtlety and artificiality) and colore (which became more or less equivalent to naturalism, with two qualitative connotations, favourable and unfavourable). One of the most significant propositions which emerges from Dolce's book and from the clash which it reflects is that the perfections of art are varied: "non da credere . . . che ci sia una sola forma del perfetto dipingere."I It is the same with certain poets, "iquali se bene si veggono dissimili l'uno dall'altro, tutti nel suo genere, o diciamo maniera, sono perfetti. E, perche Dante sia pieno di tanta dottrina; chi e colui, che non prezzi sommamente il leggiadrissimo Petrarca? Anzi a lui la maggior parte lo pone inanzi?"'1 The understanding (which finds expression in Dolce, and is personified in the claims made for Titian) of the basic and even contradictory differences be- tween the greatest masters, each attaining perfection after their own particular fashion, becomes an important factor in publications on art from now on- wards.3 Those who wrote on the subject began to be uneasily aware of the awkward empirical fact (to put it in modern terms) that artistic quality of the highest order manifested itself in outward forms so varied as to lead to serious repercussions on the formulation of an explicit theory of art which purported to embrace them. This is a recurring dilemma which is commonplace enough to us, but which emerged for the first time on a major scale after the High Renaissance. It was not surprising that there was a period of disorientation and perplexity, during which the process of taking stock of the situation was 1 Dolce, op. cit., 1557, fol. 41 verso. 2Dolce, op. cit., fol. 7 recto. Later (fol. 48 recto) he says: "alcuni hanno comparato Michel'Agnolo a Dante, e Rafaello al Petrarca." We recall that Carracci substi- tuted Titian for Raphael. 3 As was so often the case at this time, the idea had been previously aired in a context not primarily concerned with art. In this particular instance, as Professor E. H. Gom- brich has kindly pointed out to me, there can be little question that Dolce's immediate source was the Cortegiano of Baldassare Casti- glione. A new edition of the famous book (written between I514-24 and first published by Aldo in 1528) was entrusted to Lodovico Dolce in 1552 by Gabriel Giolito de' Ferrari, the same Venetian publisher who was to issue Dolce's own Dialogo della Pittura in I557. I quote from this 1552 edition (which was fol- lowed by several others, including one of 1556 apostillato in the margin by Dolce): "Eccovi che nella pittura sono eccelle[n]tissimi, Leonardo Vincio, il Ma[n]tegna, Raphaello, Michel'a[n]gelo, Georgio da Castelfra[n]co: nie[n]tedimeno tutti son tra se nel far dis- simili, di modo che ad alcun di loro non par che manchi cosa alcuna in quella maniera: perche si conosce ciascun nel suo stil esser perfettissimo" (Il Libro del Cortegiano del Conte Baldessar Castiglione. Nuovamente con somma diligenza corretto, &amp; revisto per il Dolce, secondo l'essemplare del proprio autore, Venice, I552, fol. 37 verso; subsection 37 of Bk. I of the subdivided editions, such as that of Vittorio Cian). The context is a digression on lin- guistic questions in which Castiglione also points out the differences in style between great practitioners of the musical, poetical and oratorical arts, and it seems evident, as Cian indicates, that Castiglione's own source was Cicero's De Oratore (Bk. III, ch. vii, ?? 26 ff.). Dolce's stressing of the idea in a book specifically dedicated to painting (and moreover one involved in the birth of the disegno-colore controversy) resulted in it having a considerable progeny in that field; it was to become in due course routine ammunition for those who disliked too explicit a verbal codification of artistic excellence, and who were opposed to the monopolistic claims of classic-idealist theory.</page><page sequence="11">ECLECTICISM AND THE CARRACCI 313 very much in evidence. Considerable issues had arisen and some time had to elapse before their implications were realized and acted upon; indeed it was not until the Seicento that the two divergent paths out of the impasse began to develop in the form in which they have become so familiar.' V The Late Cinquecento : Lomazzo Particularly typical of the unsettled state of mind to which we have been referring are the works of Lomazzo, which were published in 1584 and 1590. By 1571, when he lost his sight, Lomazzo had evidently become aware of the problem which was emerging, and his writings may be described (in so far as our present investigations are concerned2) as in the nature of a review of the position. Indeed the mainspring of his Idea del Tempio della Pittura is his conviction of the diversity of ways by which artistic excellence had in fact been reached, and his demonstration, by means of interpretative characteriza- tion, of the forms which that variety took.3 It is perhaps difficult for us to envisage one who expended quantities of ink on (for instance) the detailed rules of iconography as being something of a romantic when more strictly aesthetic issues are in question. But Lomazzo was not only a true child of his times in his general theoretical principles-for example, in the importance which he attaches to inspiration4 and in his assertion that no learning, how- ever extensive and profound, was of any avail to a man who was not born a painter ;5 he also to some extent anticipates the future6 in the emphatic respect which he evinces for the essential individuality in actual practice of natural genius. This is the real backbone of his aesthetic point of view, and it not unnaturally leads him to adopt a decidedly cautious and reserved attitude on the extent to which an artist should allow himself to be influenced by the work of others. We may take some of the "heads of argument" printed in the 1 On the one hand there were those who were inclined to strengthen the element of theory at the expense of the claims of the works of art: this was the line of the classic- idealist theorists with a rationalistic and philo- sophic bias, beginning with Agucchi and developing a formidable progeny. On the other hand those whose point of departure was the work of art did not set much store by logical theoretical structure, especially if it tended to clash with an object which was felt to be of high quality: the allegiance of writers like Scannelli and Boschini belongs to this category, in which (closely related as it was to the rapidly growing world of the more broad-minded dilettanti) judgments tended to become matters of instinctive taste rather than of the rational application of given criteria. 2 On an occasion such as this it would obviously be both impossible and inappro- priate to attempt to deal with so big a subject as Lomazzo "in the round"-that is, com- prehensively. I have to confine myself to characteristics which seem significant for, or relevant to, the particular questions under discussion. 3 Idea del Tempio della Pittura, Milan, 1590. For his basic points of departure, cf. especially pp. 7-12. The idea of diversity constantly reappears thereafter. 4 His opinion that the painter should not take up his brush unless he is fired by "un natural furore" (Trattato, 1584, p. 484) is of course in accord with current Neoplatonic views. 5 Idea, 1590, pp. 38 f. 6 1 am referring to those dilettanti of the next century who found themselves out of sympathy with the classic-idealist standpoint in its more rigidly rationalistic manifestations. IO0</page><page sequence="12">314 DENIS MAHON margin of the Idea to typify his line of thought. "Genij diversi de i pittori, e secondo quelli diverse in loro l'eccellenze" (p. 7) is followed by (p. 8) "'Imitare le maniere altrui, &amp; abbandonar la sua naturale dannosissimo al pittore" and "Facilitk, &amp; gratia nell'operare nasce dal seguitare il proprio genio." Lomazzo makes it clear enough that in his opinion the most successful painters are those who, possessed of inborn gifts, have not neglected their talent but have exer- cised and cultivated it to the full. Immediately afterwards (Idea, pp. 9-o10) he refers to another (and, by obvious inference, lower) category which can be divided into two subsections: those who seek to remedy a deficiency in natural aptitude by assiduous study, and those who, not having sufficient understand- ing of the principles of art to work independently on their own, imitate the manners of other artists. The work of the first type is however likely to turn out respectable rather than geniale, and to lack that confident touch which is so desirable; 1 the second type has produced some successful artists (even though, the inference is, of less than the first rank) but within it are also to be numbered those obtuse bunglers who, relying on the hard-won achievements of others which they proceed to jumble up together ("accozzare insieme"), eventually come to their end without credit or repute. Moreover it is a fact worthy of note, Lomazzo goes on (Idea, pp. io-i i), that among those who belong to the first and most successful category (that is to say, those who, by cultivating their natural genius, "sono pervenuti al colmo dell'eccellenza") it is impossible to discern a manner common to all; on the contrary, they are "varie tutte, &amp; frt se, l'une dall'altre differenti," a feature which stems from the "diversith de i genij." The greatest masters, in fact, "nelle loro maniere sono tutti dissimili frhi se," but their manners are such that "in quella parte, cui da natura sono stati inclinati, &amp; ' cui hanno drizzato l'arte, &amp; industria loro, non e chi possa maggior eccellenza disiderare." After pointing out that such diversity is recorded as having existed among the leading painters of classical antiquity, and that it is indeed a characteristic of the arts of sculpture and architecture as well as painting, Lomazzo strongly stresses (Idea, p. I 1) the supreme and overriding importance of an artist taking exceptional pains to understand in what direction his own natural bent lies,2 so that he can be on the watch against stumbling into practices which are unsympathetic or even hostile to it, and conversely so that he can restrict himself to imitating (or rather-the interpretation of imitare which the general gist of Lomazzo's thought would suggest in this particular context3-following the example of4) 1 This appears to be the meaning behind the expression-"una certa gratia"-which Lomazzo uses in this particular passage. 2 Though Lomazzo states this principle with clarity and emphasis, he himself (need- less to say) was not responsible for its "dis- covery." SWe have already seen that Lomazzo takes a relatively unfavourable view of "mere" imitation- as a general principle. He is also strongly averse to particular borrowings in practice, whether compositions or motives (for instance, cf. Trattato, I584, pp. 482 and 484 f.) or even details of figures (ibid., p. 286), his view being that it does not pay to try and save trouble in this fashion. Similar criticism of borrowings may be found in the lecture of Cristoforo Roncalli (II Pomarancio), de- livered to the Accademia di San Luca on June 26, 1594 (cf. Romano Alberti, Origine, et progresso dell'Academia del Dissegno . . . di Roma, Pavia, 1604, p. 69). 4 Incidentally, Lomazzo himself uses "ex- ample" as a synonym for "imitation" (e.g., Trattato, 1584, p. 679, where he refers to individual artists being named by him "per essempio &amp; imitatione").</page><page sequence="13">ECLECTICISM AND THE CARRACCI 315 the manner of those whose natural instincts were in conformity with his own. It may seem strange, taking into account the outline which we have given of Lomazzo's point of view, that it has been thought appropriate to describe him as advocating an eclectic doctrine or method. The latter expression, used strictly within the context of the history of art-theory proper, is normally taken to convey the idea of a balanced system of combination and synthesis: a concept, that is, of so tidily rationalistic a stamp that it runs the obvious risk of shipwreck on the rocks of abstraction and impracticability. Why has an individualist like Lomazzo, often incoherent but with flashes of intuitive common sense, been cast for so ironically uncongenial a role? The prime responsibility for this misunderstanding is in my opinion to be laid at the door of the celebrated passage in which he speaks of two ideal pictures of Adam and Eve. In my book I rashly took for granted the customary reading (which began in the Seicento) and described Lomazzo's remarks as a precept, the implication being that it gave expression to a positive doctrine. However, I cannot now bring myself to believe that such a conclusion, which more or less ignores the context both in the general and in the particular sense, can claim to be a really adequate interpretation, and am glad of this opportunity for revision. In so far as the general context is concerned, we have already given reasons for supposing that the conventional reading would hardly be "in character" for Lomazzo, but the subject is sufficiently important to justify some further remarks. As has been pointed out, Lomazzo perceives that the situation in which the art of painting found itself in the sixties was one of extreme complexity, and he is engaged in taking stock of it by interpretative analysis and classification. Acutely aware that the many-sidedness of art goes further even than the disegno-colore controversy, he avoids taking up an extreme position in the latter; though he considers that colour gives superiority to painting over sculpture, and obviously has a genuine admiration for Titian's particular qualities, he nevertheless feels that that greatest of colourists is inferior in disegno. His evaluation of the then state of affairs makes him very pessimistic. Though he does, for example, hint that more self-reliance is necessary if great painters are to appear again," he is by no means the man to produce a neat ready-made solution-still less to urge it upon others. In actual fact he is very uncertain of himself, often losing the trend of his argu- ment, and even falling into contradiction. In the end what particularly strikes one about Lomazzo is his avoidance (despite superficial appearances) of any- thing which could be called a consistent and articulated aesthetic doctrine; he has no concrete rules to offer for the attainment of specifically artistic excel- lence, and indeed, as we have seen, one of his basic principles is the allowance of full scope to natural instinct. We are guilty of a pure non sequitur if we assume that his analytical explanations must also necessarily entail the advocacy of a deliberate policy of synthesis. We may now turn to the particular context of the fundamental passage 1 The fact that Lomazzo was inclined to adopt a critical attitude towards derivative elements in contemporary painting-which in his case necessarily meant pinting of the sixties-reminds us that he should never be regarded as a self-satisfied and complacent Mannerist who thought he knew all the answers.</page><page sequence="14">316 DENIS MAHON on which any assertion that Lomazzo put forward a positive programme of eclecticism must primarily rest.' In the chapter of the Idea in which it appears, No. I17, he is engaged in illustrating, with the help of an elaborate symbolism, the various types offorma to be found among the leading painters. We are not of course concerned here with exploring the whys and wherefores of the complicated and creaking machinery, with a marked astrological flavour, by means of which he makes his points; it may suffice to say that he characterizes the different masters by seeing similarities of natural temperament with various animals (a not uncommon convention) and with certain philosophers or savants of the past.2 "E per6," he says,3 "se si trovasse alcuno, nel qual fossero unite tutte le nature di tali animali, quello sarebbe il piu gran pittore che mai fosse stato fra i mortali, &amp; di quante piu participasse, tanto maggior sarebbe, come si vede nei Governatori [sc., Lomazzo's leading painters] i quali secondo che hanno participato piu e meno della natura anco de gli altri, sono stati piu e meno eccellenti." In this passage Lomazzo is not suggesting that a painter should actually endeavour to combine the various "natures"; this, after all, was a matter under the control of other forces-for instance, the heavens. He is simply sketching out a rough interpretative assessment of then existing data; it is a sort of primitive astrological adumbration of Roger de Piles' accountancy in his Balance des peintres. After completing his characteriza- tion of the masters, which finishes with Titian, he says (Idea, p. 59, misprinted 45): "Non lascier6 qui di dire che alcuni pittori mi hanno notato come che in loco di Titiano io dovessi porre Antonio da Corregio." He does not approve of this, saying that the holders of such opinions are "tutti dati solame[n]te al fare," and adding severely (p. 60) "nel giudicare dell'eccellenza de gli artefici drittamente no[n] discernono." But he immediately has second thoughts and proceeds to strike a more modest note, from which he is led-almost as an aside in parenthesis !-into his by now notorious pronouncement (Idea, p. 60): "E non presumo gia io di poterne giudicar piu saldamente de gli altri, &amp; conoscere essattame[n]te in che cosa principalmente sia eccellente ciascuno di questi grandi artefici. Ma dir6 bene che a mio parere chi volesse formare due quadri di somma profetione [sc., perfezione] come sarebbe d'uno Adamo, &amp; d'un Eva, che sono corpi nobilissimi al mondo; bisognarebbe che l'Adamo si dasse ' Michel Angelo da disegnare, a Titiano da colorare, togliendo la proportione, &amp; convenienza da Raffaello, &amp; l'Eva si disegnasse da Raffaello, &amp; si colorisse da Antonio da Coreggio: che questi due sarebbero i miglior quadri che fossero mai fatti al mondo." Lomazzo, as should be clear enough upon careful reconsideration, is simply concerned with interpretation and classification-with, that is to say, the characterization of the quality in which "principalmente sia eccellente ciascuno di questi grandi artefici."'4 Unfortunately he was too clever by half and put it all together metaphorically in the form of his two ideal pictures, 1 Perhaps it may be conceded that the passage relating to Figino which was quoted above was in essence a eulogistic tribute from the master to the leading pupil, cast in the routine literary form. 2 He also makes the point that the taste of the spectator is affected in a similar way by natural inclination. 3 Lomazzo, Idea, 1590, p. 57. 4 The passage in Pino quoted above (note 3, p. 311) is sufficiently obviously of the same type.</page><page sequence="15">ECLECTICISM AND THE CARRACCI 317 which later writers persisted in treating with a literalness which was never intended.1 The result was that he came to be called a fool for his pains and to be made responsible in due course for the paternity of what was taken to be the exhortatory battle-cry of eclecticism.2 VI The Late Cinquecento: Armenini It has several times been suggested that an aesthetic programme which can reasonably be described as "eclectic" is discernible in Armenini's single publication,3 but my own impression is that this cannot plausibly be main- tained if the essential character of the book is taken into proper account. It is necessary when reading Armenini to bear in mind that, though his youth was spent in apprenticeship to the art of painting, he abandoned its practice-in which he had not met with success-in early manhood. He was, in a sense, a frustrated student, and his book was written4 (as he repeatedly makes clear) above all as a handbook of hints for beginners, in order to save them from some of the lengthy trials and tribulations which used normally to beset those who wished to master the rudiments of the art (and of which-it seems clear enough-he himself had had his full share). The Veri precetti is not, therefore, to be regarded primarily as a general treatise on aesthetics dealing, for example, with the basic principles by which the highest artistic quality had been, or could be, attained, but rather as a practical manual of instruction for young students, and indeed-as the author claims-the first of its kind. That its intention was educational in this sense is emphasized by the fact that the giovani for whose benefit it was written are specifically invoked throughout, again and again. In his Proemio addressed to the "Studiosi della Pittura" Armenini adds to his audience of beginners the lay dilettanti, expressing the hope (p. 2) that his book will not only offer "molto lume alla giove[n]tii, che desidera darsi questo studio, ma molto giudicio ancora a gli animi, che si dilettano di con- te[m]plare, e considerare le gia fatte figure." But it is sufficiently clear that he is not attempting to tell the established professional ("pratico Maestro") his business, and we may suspect that Armenini has an underlying feeling of inferiority in this respect. The fact that he naturally defends the usefulness of his Precetti, denying that painting is a mystery unfathomable by words, does not prevent him from complaining bitterly (p. 3 and cf. p. 86) that the masters 1 The general form of framework adopted by Lomazzo for his metaphor, that of a synthetic work of art, may conceivably have a distant literary ancestor in Lucian's Etx6veg, as Professor Gombrich pointed out to me. SIt may be noted that it is quite possible to argue that the "chi" of "chi volesse form- are" is to be read as a hypothetical patron rather than an artist. 3 Giovanni Battista Armenini, De' veri pre- cetti della pitiura, Ravenna, 1586 (reprinted identically in I587). 4 According to the Conclusione dello Authore at the end-a sort of postscript-it was written many years before publication. The most probable period for its composition would appear to be the fifteen-sixties; Armenini tells us (p. 65) that he was in Rome, presumably as a student, in I556. When he gave up painting he became a priest (cf. his Will of I605 published by Michelangelo Gualandi in Memorie originali italiane risguar- danti le belle arti, II, Bologna, I841, pp. 78 ff.).</page><page sequence="16">318 DENIS MAHON are too chary of revealing the "secrets" of their craft even to their studio assistants. As a result the young men are driven to rely on their own resources and teach themselves, which costs them undue time and energy, having regard to the fact that the art is "piena di tante cose, e copiosa d'essempi di maniere quasi infinite." Our author, an initiate who has ceased to practise, stands in a neutral position, half professional and half layman, and proposes to disclose the inside knowledge he has obtained. He offers short cuts to competence.' Armenini reiterates at the end of the first book of his publication that he has been concerning himself with the "primi rudimenti" most necessary to give a start on the right track to students of painting.2 The fact that it is the very earliest stages of a would-be artist's career which are under consideration is especially obvious in the case of chapter 6 of book I (pp. 44-51), in which (after saying that his discussion is "a beneficio de' principianti") he points out that the matter of natural talent is especially important, and, individual apti- tudes being as diverse as they are, admonishes parents or relatives to consider carefully before encouraging an unsuitable boy to become an artist or dis- couraging one who has a natural inclination in that direction. Then, after indulging in a lengthy tirade against the many practitioners without natural gifts who afflict the good name of art with their stupid bungling, he passes (p. 48) to "quest'altro consiglio, come cosa che sia di qualche momento, &amp; questo sara d'avvertire a non ci metter giovani che siano troppo delicati, ne meno di troppo debil complessione, di modo che ogni poca di fatica 6 di disagio li faccia nocumento," his point being that, since learning how to paint is (in the Cinquecento!) a more active and energetic undertaking than other studies, the young beginner requires a sound constitution. By way of explain- ing this advice, Armenini then proceeds with a passage which I was surprised to see has been read3 as something very much more pretentious than the context would appear to justify-no less than a suggestion to painters (that is, painters in general, not giovani) that they should adopt "the practice of eclecticism." I quote:4 Concio sia cosa che si come ? necessario a' buoni Poeti veder molti volumi di libri, i quali trattino di materie diverse per aiuto di poter far belle, &amp; riguardevoli le loro opere, &amp; com- positioni; cosi parimente ? tenuto A fare, chi e per dovere adoperarsi " sufficienza nelle pitture, percioche giunti che essi5 sono A buona intelligentia nel dissegno, &amp; che sperimentato che hanno bene i colori in pidi maniere per trovar le tinte migliori, &amp; pib vere, gli e poi forza, volendo proseguire verso il fine della perfettione; come si deve; di conoscere, &amp; dividere diverse maniere d'opere, dipinte dai piu eccellenti nostri moderni, dalle quali si piglia il lume di unir le mestiche, &amp; i colori diversi insieme, che rieschino puri, fiammeggianti, &amp; piacevoli, &amp; da se parimente prendere i modi de' lor componimenti, &amp; abigliamenti, che sono sparsi in quelle, accioche poi nel far le sue rimangano senza difetti,6 per quanto si estendono le forze loro: Et perche queste sono sparse in pidi paesi &amp; Citta, gli e necessario di andarli con pii tempo, &amp; con stenti " minuto considerarle, &amp; se gli e possibile provarsi ad imitarle con i colori, 7 6 in tavolette, 6 in carte, 6 tutte, 6 parte le cose pi i belle &amp; con i pastelli, o con altra materia haverne copia per poter servirsene poi ne' lor bisogni. 1 For example, cf.

This is, as far as it goes, a simple and indeed almost trite piece of advice, which in practice happens to bring the best out of some artists (Rubens comes at once to mind) but not others (our author evidently made no success of his own prescription!). To treat such a passage as the enunciation of a programme for attaining artistic achievement by eclectic principles is, in my opinion, to magnify quite disproportionately what is in reality nothing but homely counsel of the most ordinary and unpretending kind. Armenini is not averse to the young artist looking about him while he is finding his feet' and en- deavouring to acquire a solidly established manner of his own.2 Our author is however strongly critical of those who think they have found "il fiore di tutte le maniere" by combining together a lot of incompatible elements.3 The borrowing of motives is not expressly insisted upon, but it is noted that an eminent master can carry it out successfully provided that what is borrowed is thoroughly assimilated into the style of the borrower.4 Students should consequently be careful to vary and adapt into their own manner anything derived from elsewhere.5 What is striking about Armenini's publication, having due regard to its nature as a manual for beginners, is not the existence of references to the desirability of taking lessons from what had been done in the past, but the warnings which are uttered against misapplication of those lessons. However that may be, I should have thought that it was in any case sufficiently apparent that Armenini was far from being an important or influential figure in the profession, and that masters of a certain stature would not be likely to pay great attention to his book, containing as it does a quantity of elementary "Questo costume del ritrar le pitture piU si frequenta in Roma, e in Fiorenza, che in altri luoghi per Italia che io sappia." 1 Cf Armenini, Precetti, 1586, p. 58: ".. non ? cosa peggio b i principianti, quanto che non havendo maniera ferma, cercar di voler pigliarne molte." 2 I take this to be the most reasonable inter- pretation of the expression "ferma maniera" which Armenini uses on occasion. Elsewhere (pp. 6o f.) he says that there are two ways in which the student can set about acquiring it: "Due sono dunque le vie per le quali la pre- detta maniera apprender si pu6 con molta fermezza, l'una 6 il frequente ritrarre l'opere di diversi Artefici buoni: l'altro 6 il dare solamente opera a quelle di un solo eccel- lente." 3 Armenini, Precetti, 1586, p. 67. The in- adequacy of combinations of borrowed ele- ments of various kinds was frequently noted at this time. Cf. also Dolce, Dialogo della Pittura, 1557, fol. 34 verso f.; Vincenzo Danti, II primo libro del trattato delle perfette proporzioni, Florence, 1567, p. 32; Lomazzo, Trattato, 1584, p. 286. A much later manifestation of the same sort of view was Bernini's amusing comment on the famous Zeuxis story, capped by Winckelmann's characteristic rebuke (cf. my book, p. 134, note 81, and Professor Lee's review, p. 210). 4 For example, cf. Armenini, Precetti, I 586, p. 65. The importance of personal style as an overall unifying factor is also emphasized when the matter of selection from nature is under discussion; Armenini, referring to the Zeuxis story (op. cit., p. 89) says that if the artist "non havesse posseduto da se singolar maniera, non havrebbe mai accordate in- sieme le belle membra divise ch'egli tolse da tante Vergini." 5 Cf Armenini, Precetti, 1586, p. 78. See also Lomazzo, Trattato, 1584, p. 484.</page><page sequence="18">320 DENIS MAHON information of a practical nature which (however interesting to us) was taken for granted by them. Federico Zuccaro, for example, appears to have thought little of him, since, in criticizing his definition of disegno in a lecture delivered to the Accademia di San Luca on January 17, 1594, he refers to him almost contemptuously as "un certo Giovanbattista Armelino [sic], ch'ha voluto anch'esso scrivere della pittura."'1 When all these considerations are borne in mind it seems inadequate and unrevealing to accord him full-blown status as an "eclectic theorist." In fact it is seriously beside the point because, once Armenini is studied more flexibly than the rather disproportionate preoccupa- tion with eclecticism would appear to allow, he turns out (like Lomazzo) to be an interesting figure in more ways than one. These two writers, whose experience of painting dates in both cases from the sixties,2 have one thing in common :3 their pessimism. In other respects there is considerable contrast between them. Lomazzo, as we have seen, has individualist and romantic tendencies, and is interested in interpretation and characterization; he is to some extent a forerunner of the anti-rational protagonists of "taste." Armenini, on the other hand, is not concerned with critical problems on the highest level, but has a decidedly utilitarian approach "from the bottom"; moreover, unlike Lomazzo, he foreshadows certain im- portant aspects of the rational classic-idealist point of view which was to develop fully during the Seicento. Among these latter is his opinion that nature should be assisted and her shortcomings avoided,4 and his respect for the sculpture of classical antiquity, which he is inclined to treat as a kind of norm.5 It may be remembered, however, that we have reason to believe that the Carracci of the marginal notes would have expressed his emphatic dissent from Armenini over this matter; it can be pointed out too that, while Lomazzo shows cautious interest in the Venetian colouristic (and therefore, in the con- temporary reading, naturalistic) point of view, Carracci is far more whole- heartedly committed to it. All in all, it would seem that the art-theoretical situation in the late Cinquecento was far from simple and straightforward. 1 Cf. Romano Alberti, Origine, et progresso dell'Academia del Dissegno . . . di Roma, 1604, p. 18. Zuccaro mentions Vasari just before, but he is of course referred to as "Il Vasari." It may be reiterated that the letter published by Ticozzi (Raccolta di lettere, VII, Milan, 1822, pp. 5I6 ff.) purporting to be written by Zuccaro to Lodovico Carracci and referring to Armenini as "assai garbato giovane ed assai curioso dell'arte nostra" is a palpable falsification (cf. my book, pp. I8o f., note 58). 2 It appears from his postscript that Arme- nini's text, probably written in the sixties, was not revised at the time of publication. Lomazzo saw no works of art after 157I; though his writings on art were certainly expanded and developed after he had become blind, he had evidently committed a good deal to paper-as he puts it in the dedication of his Idea-"ne gl'anni della mia gioventff" (cf. also his Rime, 1587, p. 539). 3 I should have thought that they could only be bracketed together as academic (a proceeding apparently favoured by Professor Lee) if the latter term is used so widely as to be almost meaningless. If it is taken to imply learning, Armenini is very ill-equipped by Lomazzo's standards. If it covers educational intentions, Armenini has qualifications. And so on. Hence my mistrust of these hold-all expressions which inevitably have the effect of concealing variety, or, in other words, his- torical realities. 4 For example, cf. Armenini, Precetti, 1586, pp. 88 f. 5 For example, cf. ibid., p. 6I.</page><page sequence="19">ECLECTICISM AND THE CARRACCI 321 VII Seicento Criticisms of Lomazzo's Supposed Precept: Domenichino and Scannelli We may now turn to the Seicento, taking as our point of departure the key passage in Lomazzo's Idea which we have already had occasion to discuss -that concerning the two "ideal" pictures of Adam and Eve. Reasons have already been given for supposing that this passage, which has generally been taken in a literal sense as a precept, is in reality to be read metaphorically as a piece of interpretative analysis; and as such it provides a typical example of Lomazzo's anxiety to avoid taking sides-at any rate in too definite and polemical a manner-in the great disegno-colore controversy which was by then in full swing. But certain disadvantages are likely to accrue from the creation of striking metaphorical images and from sitting on the fence over a much disputed matter. The first, just because they possess a high potentiality for lodgment in the memory, are almost certain to survive out of context; while a writer who adopts the latter attitude runs the risk of becoming a target for both of the contending parties. Lomazzo's case is no exception. We have evidence of Domenichino's highly critical attitude towards the Adam and Eve passage in a letter written by him (probably in 1632) to Francesco Angeloni, a fragment of which was published by Bellori.1 That we are concerned with a vivid image which had impressed itself on Domenichino's memory without regard to context is sufficiently evident in view of his state- ment earlier in the letter that he had no copies of Lomazzo with him at the time of writing. It is also clear enough in the preceding parts of the letter that Domenichino objected to a tendency to overvalue colore at the expense of disegno which he recollected as having perceived (whether rightly or wrongly) in the writings of Lomazzo.2 In essence, therefore, Domenichino takes up as firm a position in the disegno-colore controversy (though not on the same side of the fence!) as did the Carracci of the postille. Extremely significant and illuminating is the complete divergence from what Domenichino could have been expected to write if he bad really been attracted by the concept of equal balance of the best in both camps-a concept which was to become a com- ponent raw material of cardinal importance for the future manufacture of the hypothesis of an eclectic system.3 Both his classic predilections and his 1 Giovanni Pietro Bellori, Le vite de' pittori, scultori et architetti, Rome, I672, p. 359. The entire fragment was reprinted in my book (pp. 119-120; for the dating, cf. p. 121). Domenichino's sentence referring to Adam and Eve reads as follows: [Lomazzo] "Dice ancora che a fare un quadro perfetto sarebbe Adamo, &amp; Eva: l'Adamo disegnato da Michel Angelo, colorito da Titiano: l'Eva disegnata da Rafaelle, e colorita dal Coreggio hor veda V. S. dove vi " cadere chi erra nei primi principij." 2 In the Adam and Eve passage (if one reads it in the literal sense rather than in the metaphorical sense which was intended by the author) the concept which suggests itself is actually one of equal balance, which would indeed be equivalent to overvaluation of colore from the point of view of Domenichino; but previous sentences in Domenichino's letter make it seem probable that he was even under the impression that Lomazzo had in fact given the precedence to colore. 3 Professor Lee (op. cit., p. 2I 1), after refer- ring with good reason to Domenichino's advocacy of the primacy of disegno, proceeds to argue in substance that, since Domenichino is critical of Lomazzo on these grounds, the opinion that he was also critical of what we may call the potential "eclectic" content of</page><page sequence="20">322 DENIS MAHON common sense combine to reject what he took (erroneously, in the final analysis) to be a crude proposal for an equilibrium of incompatibles. Not so long after Domenichino's criticism of it, Lomazzo's ill-starred venture into imagery found itself under fire, on the grounds of the obvious incompatibility of the component parts, from another and very different quarter-a layman amateur who was strongly sympathetic to the cause of colore as against disegno. Francesco Scannelli, whose Microcosmo was published in 1657,1 was in several ways the heir of certain romantic tendencies which we noted in Lomazzo. Though (owing in particular to his fervent champion- ship of Correggio) Scannelli often finds occasion to differ from Lomazzo on particular points, he is in tacit agreement with the latter as regards certain fundamental principles-like Lomazzo he stressed the diversity of individual natural genius and was a strong believer in its significance and importance; obviously any notion of a deliberate combination of different perfections would be hardly likely to find favour with him. Scannelli is an interesting figure who deserves fuller attention than I can appropriately give him here ;2 but some brief indication of his character and position would appear to be desirable. A native of Forli in the Romagna, he was, like Mancini, a doctor of medicine by profession and an insatiable dilettante of painting by inclination. He was particularly familiar with the contemporary artistic scene at Bologna, being personally acquainted with Reni, Albani, and Guercino. He had travelled widely in Italy in order to satisfy his curiosity about painting. His point d'appui was Modena, where Francesco I d'Este, one of the most intelligent collectors of the time, was engaged in building up his magnificent gallery. Scannelli was a special protege of Geminiano Poggi, the Duke's Segretario di Camera (who had charge of the collection and was devoted to its welfare), and had on occasion acted as Poggi's representative in acquiring pictures for the Duke, to whom he dedicated his Microcosmo, and of whose "buon gusto della pittura" he speaks- a thoroughly characteristic expression for this type of writer. It is probable that Scannelli was in touch with the anti-classical Marco Boschini (who may well have been involved with advising the Duke's agents about the purchase of pictures), since he shows in the Microcosmo that he is aware of the existence of Boschini's Carta del navegar pittoresco although the latter was not published until three years later. Scannelli's bias is of course far from being in favour of classic-idealist theory (he was not, in any case, philosophically minded). On the contrary, though he treats Raphael with deferential admiration, his most genuine and instinctive sympathies are with Titian and, above all, the Adam and Eve passage must thereby be untenable. The assumption seems to be that the disegno-colore schism has nothing to do with the hypothesis of an eclectic system, whereas the fact seems perfectly clear to me that it is, on the contrary, extremely per- tinent. The strange thing is that Professor Lee appears to be aware of this in another context, since he goes so far as to describe Agucchi and Mancini as being conscious of an eclectic character in the art of the Car- racci-an art which, however, they had characterized as a bringing-together of the two poles and thus a healing of the breach. For further remarks on this subject, see also my article in The Art Bulletin, XXXV, 1953, pp. 229 f 1 Francesco Scannelli, II Microcosmo della Pittura, Cesena, I657. 2 I hope to be able to dedicate a separate study to him some time in the future.</page><page sequence="21">ECLECTICISM AND THE CARRACCI 323 Correggio. For Scannelli, naturalism is the most important quality in a picture-the best of nature, no doubt, but still nature without conscious search for idealization. "La vera e bella naturalezza" is the sort of expression he would employ to describe the painter's goal. In his "naturalezza" an impor- tant part is played by "uniformith," a term which he uses to express the fluid, fused characteristics of Veneto-Lombard painting. The great vice of the Florentines, by contrast, was their "snaturata seccaggine." It is typical that he feels that Domenichino overdid his allegiance to the Roman-Tuscan point of view. Scannelli's comment on Lomazzo's "ideal" pictures appears in a chapter' which puts forward the proposition that, in spite of the manifest and funda- mental stylistic differences between the greatest masters, their best works are not to be regarded as falling short of the highest perfection because of a lack of balance occasioned by instinctive bias in the particular direction which they were suited by nature to follow. However differently orientated they might be by reason of their special, individual qualities, their most outstanding achievements can only be described as perfect. Scannelli observes, however, that this view was apparently not shared by Lomazzo: ". . . dimostra sentire altrimente Gio: Paolo Lumazzi, mentre per compimento di bella Pittura, non stimando adequata la particolar sufficienza de' primi, e piu eccellenti Maestri, vole, che solo mediante l'unione delle megliori qualita si possa formare la bellissima Pittura" (p. 68); the passage from Lomazzo concerning the "ideal" pictures is then quoted, beginning with the words "Chi volesse formare." It may be noted that Scannelli overlooks the context and reads Lomazzo's remarks literally, one of the first published cases of very many; but what is of interest to us is his reaction to what he mistakenly believes to be Lomazzo's view. For him the supposed precept is "in effetto di poca riuscita" so long as the divine power does not produce an artist who combined these super- human qualities; but, "considerandosi ci6 in ordine all'atto prattico," he observes that, since the artists in question happened to live at the same time, we may as well visualize the consequences of actual collaboration between them: "varie, e repugnanti difficolth per l'unione di queste incompatibili materie" (p. 69). No doubt he investigates a possible collaboration between the drawing of Michelangelo and the colour of Titian in rather too literal a way, but it is clear enough that he understands the essence of the matter; it is necessary (p. 69) "pe'l compimento di buona Pittura, che il colorito, e dissegno unitamente conspiri alla formatione dell'opera." The different manner of Titian could not conform to a design of Michelangelo. Titian (with whom Scannelli's personal sympathies were engaged2) could not but amend the un- natural exaggerations of Michelangelo, and in so doing transform the work 1 Scannelli, Microcosmo, I657, chapter X of book I (pp. 67 ff.). 2 For example, cf the passage in which Scannelli denies that Titian had anything to learn from Michelangelo "come fantastica- rono i sopracitati Autori [sc. Vasari, Lomaz- zo, and Pino] stimando un tanto soggetto mancante per non ritrovarsi facilmente delle proprie parti, &amp; al lor gusto confacevole, &amp; in ordine a Maestri stimati da loro per norma infallibile della perfetta operatione . .." (Microcosmo, 1657, p. 216). In actual fact, of course, neither Lomazzo nor Pino were un- favourable to Titian, and Scannelli's real objection is to the miscalled "eclectic" passages in these writers. For Pino, cf. notes 2 and 3, P. 311 above.</page><page sequence="22">324 DENIS MAHON "a forza di colore al proprio gusto" (p. 70). In such a way that, he goes on, "dato sopragiunga il medesimo Bonarota, vedendo l'opera ridotta con dif- ferentissimo gusto, non restera, che mal sodisfatto, sendoche in questo caso l'aiuto dell'uno non potria servire, che per la confusione dell'altro." It is not enough to argue, Scannelli says (reverting to the relative importance of disegno and colore) that disegno is what is essential and colore is just an adjunct; in this case the final perfection, which should give the picture its most valuable quality of truth to nature, would be provided by Titian's "ultimi ritocchi . . . ne' quali... si contiene veramente dissegno, e colorito" (p. 70). Michel- angelo's draughtsmanship, in short, could only serve "a se stesso, e per l'opere sue" (p. 7'). At the beginning of the next chapter Scannelli sums up his findings, taking the opportunity to express his disagreement with Paolo Pino's pronouncement to which we referred above' (which he reads half literally and half with an understanding of its illustrative content), concluding that such theories are but vain imaginings, and that, if one is seeking perfection, one has only to go to the best works of the greatest masters. Though Scannelli's rambling and digressive style makes it particularly desirable that quotations should be selected cautiously, the passage in question may reasonably be reprinted :2 Essendosi gia dimostrato nell'antecedente Capo, essere difficilissimo, e come di repugnante riuscita l'accoppiare in opera sola varij soggetti di gusto, e sufficienza differenti; serviranno parimente le stesse ragioni, per far conoscere restar'altresi ingannato Paolo Pino, mentre vuole, che pure mediante I'attivita, e sufficienza di Michelangelo riunita all'altra di Titiano si possa ritrovare in fatti il tutto delle maggiori eccellenze di Pittura, come se3 Rafaello, &amp; Antonio da Correggio non concorressero del pari, e forsi anco di vantaggio nelle qualith supreme, e maggiori perfettioni di questa virtuf; e per ci6 lasciandosi da parte coteste vane immaginationi, come chimere dell'intelletto per ogni parte lontane dall'effetto desiderato della real essistenza; diremo, che simili chimerizate perfettioni di Pittura si ritrovano in fatti nell'opere pidi isquisite de' sopracitati primi capi, e maggiori Maestri, dove co[n]siste al presente l'epilogo vero delle somme perfettioni di questa pregiata virtuf, che del continuo si possono godere da gustosi della Professione. VIII The Climate and Issues of Criticism around i6oo Any study of Annibale Carracci's paintings which is not superficial reveals that the principal stylistic event of his percorso was the marked change occa- sioned by his transfer to Rome in mid-career; the existence of this turning- point was as clear to certain of the Seicento writers as it is to some of us to- day. It would be a commonplace at the present time to describe the change as a shift from the painterly in the direction of the classic, but the task which presented itself to the early writers was the provision of a viable characteriza- tion, in terms which could then be readily understood, of this situation, and of the historical position of Annibale within an anthropomorphic view of 1 Cf. note 3, p. 311 above. 2 Scannelli, Microcosmo, 1657, p. 75. 3 This is where Scannelli shifts the trend of his comment. Having first of all taken Pino's remark literally, he suddenly sees it in an illustrative sense and objects to Pino's restriction of divinity in painting to Michel- angelo and Titian; what about Raphael and his beloved Correggio?</page><page sequence="23">ECLECTICISM AND THE CARRACCI 325 painting which conceived its health as governed by laws of growth, decay and regeneration. All who were interested in the arts towards the end of the Cinquecento had become painfully aware of the fact that painters of the very highest calibre had been few and far between after the era of the giants of the High Renaissance, and that the progress of art as it had been laid down by Vasari-a process of growth from infancy to maturity-seemed to have run its course, leaving the prospect of eventual decay looming up over the horizon. The feeling in the air that an epoch had ended led to considerable pessimism and disillusionment. Not only this, but (as we have seen) the reassuring sim- plicity of the aesthetic implications of Vasari's historical treatment with its Florentine bias had been severely undermined by partisans of the Venetian point of view. The disegno-colore controversy had made it abundantly clear that a comprehensive definition of artistic excellence was a good deal less easy to formulate than had previously been supposed. A variety of artistic aim so wide that the virtues of one great artist almost became the vices of another could not but be bewildering. Implicit in this historico-critical situation were two ways out of the impasse, two roles ready made and only awaiting their actors. One (this would appeal to the reasoning theorist) was that of an artist who would halt the decay, begin a process of regeneration, heal the gaping breach between disegno and colore, and in general do what might be expected of him under the particular historical interpretation of art to which we have referred earlier in this paragraph. The other role awaiting its protagonist (likely to appeal rather to the more instinctive type of dilettante) was that of the artist who would throw the whole historical interpretation overboard by introducing some fresh, unforeseen element into the situation. In short, when Annibale Carracci and Caravaggio appeared, the general lines on which their art was likely to be interpreted were, by implication, already adumbrated. Caravaggio, who apart from being a great artist had an intuitive feeling for publicity value, very soon realized that the role of an enfant terrible who cared nothing for the past was going a-begging and had great possibilities. He accordingly played it with immense zest, thoroughly relishing the creation of a legend about himself. Since our primary concern here is not Caravaggio, this topic cannot be pursued in detail; but it ought to become clear as our knowledge and understanding of the artist deepens that his claims that he thought little of, and owed nothing to, other works of art are belied by the evidence of his paintings.1 Perhaps the most typical illustration of the dis- crepancy between the facts and what he said about them is provided by his dictum, recorded by the Marchese Vincenzo Giustiniani, "che tanta manifattura gli era a fare un quadro buono di fiori, come di figure." This was a very striking and novel thing to say, completely contradicting the conven- tionally accepted hierarchy of pictorial subject matter, which placed still life low in the sequence and figure painting at the top. It is of course true that Caravaggio did in practice treat still life with much more loving respect than it was commonly held to deserve, and that this was a refreshingly unconven- tional trait ; 2 but the lack of veracity in the artist's statement, if read literally, 1 This is not to say, of course, that his work was not highly individual. 2 It must naturally be borne in mind that a Caravaggio living in Venice would have been a rather different animal from the Caravaggio we know; Rome was the perfect setting for him.</page><page sequence="24">326 DENIS MAHON becomes evident enough if one gets into the habit of (shall we say?) dropping in at his studio and seeing him at work. Still life in actual fact gave him relatively little trouble,1 figures a great deal; he boldly made a virtue of his supposed limitations, and is certainly no less remarkable for that. Though Caravaggio welcomed with open arms the prospect of figuring as the upsetter of everything that was taken for granted, Annibale Carracci (who, like Caravaggio, had a strong urge to "find out for himself") seems to have been unhappy in the part allotted to him as the restorer of painting, judging from his acid aphoristic objections to being compared with the great men of the past. The irony was of course that, in the historical circumstances of the time, this was the highest praise which could be accorded to him; it reflects and expresses the view, as to which agreement became general (at any rate from the second decade onwards), that Annibale was the most outstanding modern painter in Italy. The compliment was double-edged, however, for such was the widespread obsession with the finality of the achievements of the giants of the Cinquecento (reinforced by the generally-held opinion that there had been a qualitative falling-off towards the end of the century) that Anni- bale's work could not but be judged in relation to theirs. It was at this moment that the familiar contrast between "old master" and "modern artist" made its first appearance, and not, of course, to the advantage of the latter; in spite of the undisputed pre-eminence allotted to Annibale among the moderns, it was never suggested during the Seicento, as far as I am aware, that he had quite attained equal heights with his greatest predecessors. What Annibale himself really desired was to be judged for his own sake without reference to the old masters. He was never a pretentious individual and would have ridiculed extravagant claims on his behalf; equally, however, he was a self-respecting artist of marked character and would have strongly resented the view that he had nothing of his own to contribute.2 Unfortunately he had, in the long run, less good fortune with his legend than the astute Caravaggio. When the passing of time opened out the possibility of seeing his work in true perspective-also taking due account, that is, of his relation to subsequent developments-the legend had become too solidly established, and eventually achieved the questionable distinction of being read back (as it were) into his paintings. IX Early Historico-Critical Interpretations of Annibale Carracci: Agucchi and Mancini Contrasted Such a writer as Dufresnoy may be taken to typify the reduction to a perilously succinct formula,3 at a relatively early date,4 of the characterization 1 The observation recorded by Giustiniani clearly does not originate from the end of Caravaggio's Roman period or later, when it would have little meaning; this is assumed in my comment. 2 For example, cf. the story told by Man- cini and quoted in my book Studies in Seicento Art and Theory, pp. 250 f., note 28. 3 For remarks on the one and a half lines of verse in which Dufresnoy deals with Annibale, see my article in The Art Bulletin, XXXV, I953, pp. 230 f. 4 Dufresnoy's De Arte Graphica was probably first composed (in Rome) about I640-46, but was not printed until I668, though it had previously been seen in manuscript by some</page><page sequence="25">ECLECTICISM AND THE CARRACCI 327 of Annibale Carracci which was suggested by acceptance of the historical interpretation of the art of painting which we have just been discussing. Art- theory also, in its classic-idealist form, was to become (as Bellori can bear witness) an important ingredient in condensed formulae of this kind, the attractive convenience of which not unnaturally ensured them wide popu- larity. Now of course Bellori, in spite of his penchant for tying everything up neatly, realized well enough that Annibale Carracci had gone through a perfectly normal sequence of stylistic growth; but the eventual effect of these summary characterizations, constantly repeated, was to blot out the fact that Annibale's artistic language had any real development of its own at all. Obviously, too, Winckelmann's production of the high watermark of the potting process in the shape of the expression "eclectic" made it extremely easy to overlook that important stylistic reorientation which took place as a consequence of Annibale's arrival in Rome half-way through his career. Processes of growth and change were, however, quite apparent to actual or near contemporaries, who would not have had much sympathy with the idea (so often implicit in the nineteenth-century view) that the Carracci more or less sprang into action from the start and ex nihilo with an extraordinary programmatic concoction in complete working order. It is instructive to analyse the differences between the standpoints of two contemporaries who show that they were aware of a changed accent in Annibale Carracci's stylistic language. The practical dilettante Mancini noted it without wishing to draw any very elaborate conclusions; but the philo- sophically-minded letterato, Agucchi, immediately put it to programmatic use with notable consequences. The latter made no claims whatever, round about the turn of the century, to special knowledge of painting, describing himself in a letter of that time as "affatto cieco nella professione;" the actual origin of his artistic interests, which no doubt developed as time passed, was obviously his discovery-the expression is one which he uses-of the genio of the Carracci. He became so much of an enthusiast on their behalf (and particularly on behalf of Annibale, whom he regarded as insufficiently appreciated) that he sought to give his admiration the reasoned literary expression which came naturally to him. He very clearly has a propagandist axe to grind, and does so to some purpose; indeed, on reconsidering in connexion with this essay such of his contribution as has come down to us, I am if anything even more struck than before by his importance in relation to later developments in art-theoretical literature. It is in the organization of his concepts and material, and the method of his approach to art-theory and art-history, that Agucchi provides a new departure; a certain rationality and orderliness is imported from other disciplines and applied to the art of painting in a manner and to an extent which, though it may appear very limited to us, was something of a fresh venture at the time. The mainspring of Agucchi's attitude is a transfer to art-history and art-literature of a middle-of-the-road spirit of compromise, whereby the abstract theories of past tradition were brought into harmony with the concrete facts of modern practice. But, though this tendency of Agucchi to promote reconciliation between theory and practice was un- painters and critics (notably Bellori); for particulars, cf. my book, pp. 41 f. (note 50), 56 (note 8o) and 153 (note 150).</page><page sequence="26">328 DENIS MAHON doubtedly progressive at the time,1 his approach was essentially that of an outsider from the point of view of the profession; any theory of artistic excel- lence which he put forward would still have to be consistent with a wider general philosophy. In other words, his starting-off point was that of an abstract theorist and he remains substantially true to the mitier, notwithstand- ing his significant and interesting attempts to increase the plausibility of theory by relating it more closely to practice. Given the contemporary circumstances, it is not easy to see how Agucchi could have obtained as satisfactory results (in fulfilling the purpose which motivated him of providing a reasoned eulogy or learned apologetic for Annibale) with a line of argument materially different from that which he did in fact employ. This consisted of a treatment of the problem of artistic excel- lence from both the abstract and the concrete points of view, but along parallel lines; the abstract proposition that the greatest beauty (that is, ideal beauty) is obtained by improvement of nature is placed alongside the concrete example of Annibale's shift of style on arriving in Rome, which is interpreted as the crowning of the naturalistic colore of the north with the idealistic refinements of Roman disegno. Thus the notorious breach was deemed to be closed, and the historic principle of balanced selection of the best could receive its apotheosis. "The worthy Monsignore means very well," I can imagine the sceptical Annibale muttering, "but things are not quite so straightforward as this in our profession." Too tidy, in short, to be true; but its very tidiness gave it irresistible appeal to Bellori et hoc genus omne.2 Mancini, who shared with Agucchi an admiration of Annibale, was in other respects quite a different type. By no means "cieco nella professione," his experience and knowledge of works of art was considerable for a layman, his tastes were unusually wide, and his interests were often of a practical rather than a theoretical nature, even foreshadowing in a notable way the outlook of a connoisseur. But he was a complete muddle-head when any question arose of giving a consistent, orderly structure to his ideas or of drawing general conclusions.3 His reaction to the phenomenon of Annibale Carracci has none of the positive propagandist motivation of that of Agucchi. It has more the passive character of a merely classificatory interpretation, placing the Car- raccesque group between those who adhere closely to the actual model and those who normally dispense with its use. In this context appears, more or less as an offshoot of the suggested classification, the only passage in Mancini which hints at the theory of ideal beauty in the sense of a judicious selection of nature.4 It is typical of Mancini that the topic is introduced casually a posteriori 1 In the field of art literature the layman Agucchi thus takes his place as, in a sense, a more up-to-date figure than the practitioner Zuccaro. 2 A fuller discussion of Agucchi (1570-1632) will be found in my Studies in Seicento Art and Theory (cf. index, sub voce), together with a reprint of the extant fragment of his Trattato (Appendix I). 3 For a full and illuminating chara cteriza- tion of Mancini (1558-1630), see Luigi Salerno, "Sul trattato di Giulio Mancini," Commentari, II, 1951, pp. 26-39; the present writer has also touched in a much more sporadic manner on Mancini's personality in Studies in Seicento Art and Theory. 4 It must be borne in mind that selection for Mancini also meant selection in the sense of decoro, often involving a teleological view of beauty. On the subject of decoro in Man- cini, cf. Salerno, op. cit., p. 3o; for the passages on the three groups, ibid., pp. 37-38, and my</page><page sequence="27">ECLECTICISM AND THE CARRACCI 329 as a characterization of the midway position (between the two other groups) which he sees in the actual works of the Carraccesque group, rather than as an a priori theoretical concept as with Agucchi. Similarly when he refers, in a broad phrase, to the union of the manner of Raphael with that of Lombardy, he is making a general stylistic observation, rationalized from that section of Annibale's work with which he was most familiar, the products of the Roman period. There is every reason to suppose that the classicism which Annibale affected during those years must have been regarded as a classicism with a difference by a relatively unprejudiced artistic observer like Mancini who resided at Rome; when related to examples of classicism extant there it must have appeared as a novel version, a free and easy variation imported from the north. To describe this situation, which indeed was perfectly real, as a union of the manner of Raphael with that of Lombardy also had a strong complimentary connotation, having regard to the battles which had been fought over disegno and colore; it is clear enough, moreover, that Mancini did in fact consider Annibale to be the greatest modern artist. Mancini, having no propagandist or programmatic intention, is far less definite and categorical than Agucchi, and, in the writer's view, the nearer to realities on that account. For Agucchi the change in Annibale's style coinciding with his arrival in Rome became charged with what we may call theoretic content; it was a sine qua non that Annibale's later manner must be qualitatively superior to his earlier one, because it was only at the later stage that he added the vital culminating element which was postulated by the theory: Roman disegno. Mancini's admiration for Annibale has nothing to do with theory in this sense, but is connected with considerations of a rather more practical nature. Dr. Salerno has drawn attentionx to the fact that Caravaggio's dependence on the model, which militated against his under- taking extensive decorative or historical works (we can call the story of Prince Doria's loggia to witness), was regarded by Mancini as a limitation. By the same token Mancini was impressed by Annibale's omnicompetence-calling him "pittore universale"-and remarks that he was not incapable of painting without the actual presence of the model, being "vero pittore poiche faceva di sua fantasia senza tener il natural d'avanti ;"2 Mancini was also sensitive to the quality of movement (a baroque speciality which was to become increas- ingly important in the immediate future), and this too enters into his estimate of Annibale. He typically does not attempt to lay down the law on the Bolognese-Roman issue, but usefully records the fact that the question of whether Annibale's Bolognese works or his Roman works were best had been in fact a subject for discussion at that time. "Alcuni credono,"' he says, "che dipingesse piii fresco e con mag[gio]r dolcezza mentre fti in Bologna," adding "Ma' credo che sempre operasse bene," and qualifying this a little later with book, pp. 33 ff. x Salerno, op. cit., p. 38. 2 Quotations from Mancini's Trattato in this paragraph are from MS. it. 5571 in the Biblioteca Nazionale Marciana, Venice (fol. 56). The point in this particular quotation is that Annibale could dispense with a model if he thought fit, not that he always did so (this would put him into Mancini's Mannerist category). Though in fact Annibale's contact with nature was frequently maintained by means of drawings, in Baglione's opinion (Le Vite, Rome, I642, p. Iog) he "risvegli6 il buon modo del colorire dal vivo quasi in quest'ulti- mi tempi dalla sua retta via smarrito." Cf. also note 5, P- 335 below.

Mancini, therefore, though he seems to have had a preference for the theoretical primacy of disegno over colore,1 is reluctant to commit himself over the particular issue of Annibale's change of style. The same applies to another admirer of Annibale, Scannelli, who of course approaches the problem from the opposite direction and with clear sympathies for the earlier manner;2 the fact that he comments on the subject may serve to illustrate that it was much discussed throughout the Seicento, being by no means confined to the examples we have noted. X Another variant: Pietro da Cortona From what has already been said it may appear somewhat risky to assume (as is still sometimes done) the existence of a general stream of Seicento testimony tending to support the view that the nineteenth-century eclectic interpretation of the Carracci is worthy of credence and acceptance even now.3 On the whole, given the fact that the means of expression at the disposal of writers on art during the Seicento were still relatively exiguous in scope, what surprises one is the extent of the variety which can emerge on the subject of a specific phenomenon. The attitudes of Agucchi and Mancini are, as we have seen, very different from each other, but since they have one thing in common -that they purport to have seen Annibale Carracci's change of style in terms of a union of northern and Roman elements-we may, in support of our contention of interpretative variety, call another witness, whose opinion on this particular matter seems to have been that there was no unification, and that Annibale simply changed his style. This view comes from one who was, like Agucchi and Mancini, a great admirer of Annibale, but who was not a layman: Pietro Berrettini da Cortona. Since the long but very interesting passage giving Pietro's opinions is undeservedly little known, some useful purpose may be served by quoting it in extenso.4 [Page 25] L'Avviso buono d'un Savio porta seco la propria lode, e benche si possa migliorare, non rimane privo del suo merito.

Quest'Autore dice cosa degna di lode; mA potrebbesi x Dott. Salerno points out (op. cit., p. 34) that Mancini criticizes Lomazzo's remarks on colore in the same way as Domenichino. 2 It is interesting to note that Scannelli sees Domenichino (perfectly correctly) as more Romanized than Annibale, and is inclined to be critical of him on that account. 3 It is much more hazardous to attribute to the artists themselves a theoretical system which was only fully excogitated for them in the last century, when critical reading of Seicento sources was virtually non-existent.

Sappiamo del famoso Anibale Caraccio, e di Lodovico suo fratello [sic], che si posero a seguitar l'opere del Coreggio, come d'Autore di genio conforme al genio loro, imitandolo nel colorire con tanta perfettione, che chi non havesse molta pratica, giudicherebbe l'opere loro essere state fatte dallo stesso Coreggio. Anibale condusse la famosa tavola di s. Luca in Reggio,4 ove il Santo sta espresso in atto di mirar la maestosa Regina del Cielo accompagnata da numerosa schiera d'Angelici Cortigiani: e sotto si vede la figura di s.

Certo che egli non goderd in se stesso l'accoppiamento di molte maniere proprie d'eccellentissimi professori. A good deal more could certainly be said about the interpretation of this passage than is possible or relevant here; but in any case the fact is sufficiently apparent that it provides an excellent example of that diversity of opinion on which it is important to insist if a reasonable sense of proportion is to be preserved. Particularly striking is the completely different approach to that of Agucchi, which was of course only to be expected from one of the leading protagonists of the Full Baroque.x Turning to the critique of Armenini, Pietro agrees that it is permissible for the artist at an early stage to look at, and draw from, the works of many masters; but when it later becomes a question of using the brush he should follow the example of that master whose style is most congenial to him. It is specifically in the latter context that he introduces by way of example the name of Annibale Carracci. And when Annibale came to Rome, according to Pietro's reading of the situation, he gave up his first style, instead of unifying it with that classic point of view which had now come to interest him. Pietro seems to regard Annibale's work in the Galleria Farnese as peculiarly personal although he mentions that Annibale had found great "satisfaction" in the concetti of Michelangelo. The latter expression is both typical and significant. The present writer's opinion is that in this context concetti means roughly what we should now call "motives"2 and has nothing to do with "style"-if we use that term rigorously. The point which is hinted at here and in Pietro's two stages is of cardinal importance if our understanding of the Seicento is to avoid complete super- ficiality. During this period there was a common currency of motives which played a rather similar part (for example) to that of the conventional hieratic orms of imagery in earlier periods; both had the character of being "given a priori" in a general sense when the artist arrived on the scene. Thus the personal contribution emerges from the way in which the given material is handled and transformed; the ever more popular process of tracking down the origin of this or that motive is not (or rather, should not be) an end in itself, but merely the first stage, necessary and valuable, in an attempt to understand the individual artist. The fact that Pietro sometimes hits the mark in his very instructive observa- tions ought not, however, to result in our accepting his opinions literally and in toto. On the contrary, it becomes increasingly clear that contemporary writings on art do not offer anything in the nature of comprehensive ready- made interpretations for Seicento pictures. They provide important evidence which, if carefully weighed, can throw much light in dark places. But, while taking them into due account, we are still entitled to put forward our own interpretations based on direct familiarity with the artistic productions them- selves. There is no substitute for this-certainly not a crude explanation which 1 It is however interesting to note that Pietro started with a form of classicism highly flavoured with painterly elements, which in- deed attacked the problem of acclimatizing the classic traditions to the Seicento after much the same fashion, mutatis mutandis, as Annibale had done in his Roman years. 2 I am far from suggesting, of course, that this is the only meaning of concetto.</page><page sequence="31">ECLECTICISM AND THE CARRACCI 333 established itself in the nineteenth century, when no one attempted to study Seicento pictures with any care or interest. XI Remarks on Modern Usage of the Term "Eclectic" Having reviewed the written sources, with their scant support for the relatively recent theory of the theory, we may now turn to the painted works of art. Are we to adjudge the potentialities of the expression "eclectic," when applied directly to the paintings in the form of a descriptive or critical term, as revealing or misleading? (a) Usage from the art-historical standpoint (as a descriptive term within the history of style) It is presumably clear to most of us, looking back on the scene at the turA of the century between the Cinquecento and the Seicento, that we are witness- ing a major transformation in the history of style, using the latter term in the sense of a general artistic language. There is a fresh, experimental spirit in the air and it is apparent that something out of the ordinary is struggling to emerge from the background of Mannerism. Few (and certainly not the writer) would deny that the work of Caravaggio made a vital contribution to this change; but by no stretch of imagination can he be made responsible for the whole of it. Indeed the upheaval which was just beginning was far too extensive to be attributed solely to an individual artist. For this is the moment when the foundations are being laid from which Baroque art developed,' But now that we can see the course of events in perspective and understand that a new type of pictorial expression was being born, it should become increasingly difficult-especially in the light of further detailed study of the period-to remain in ignorance of the outstanding part played in this process by the Carracci (in the final analysis, above all by Annibale). Having already expressed my general views on the subject elsewhere,2 I shall not elaborate here, but it may be sufficiently clear why I cannot but regard as something of a travesty the routine characterization of the art of Annibale as in essence no more than retrospective. This latter view has received much nourishment and reinforcement from the classic-idealist inter- pretation of Annibale which held the field for centuries. That it did hold the field is not, however, an adequate reason for regarding it, ipso facto, as necessarily corresponding with the artistic data. Indeed it can be shown 1 In this particular context Baroque can be understood both in its broadest sense (by way of painterly contrast with the classic High Renaissance) and in its narrow sense of Full Baroque; the fact is not without some signi- ficance. 2 Studies in Seicento Art and Theory, I947, pp. I98-204; Commentari, I, 1950, pp. I66-7. I may observe that, in commenting on what I wrote on the second occasion concerning the position of the Carracci in the history of style, Professor Venturi's misunderstanding (loc. cit., p. 169) of my use of the term has led him in effect to dissent from a view which I did not express. No doubt style in Italian normally implies something personal, but the sense, not unusual in English, in which I was in fact using it ought to have been clear from the context.</page><page sequence="32">334 DENIS MAHON clearly enough that its longevity was due to its own intrinsic qualities rather than to any very deep comprehension of the works of art to which it was applied; its clearness, plausibility, and rationality, being a constant recom- mendation, gave it considerable survival value, while the views of a writer like Scannelli, who was sensitive to certain of the artistic essentials, were con- demned to sterile oblivion because of the incoherence with which they were presented. Nevertheless, a certain fondness still persists for the view that the classic interpretation reveals more than it misleads. But if we look at the consequences of this contention from the strictly art-historical standpoint, we find that in order to accept it we have to go so far as to disregard the entire oeuvre of the family during the vitally important "associative" Bolognese years, when they were whole-hearted partisans of the camp of colore, both in practice and in theory.' The unnatural character of this mutilation becomes clearer when we realize that it was only in mid-career that Annibale came to Rome2 and had access to the full range of the classic language, and that Lodovico was there for precisely two weeks (and could never, on any pretext, be described as a classicist).3 Moreover, one thing leads to another. It is much easier to regard Annibale's work as scarcely more than a sort of bastard classicism if one simply takes little or no notice of what the works of the first half of his career have to tell us.4 For it is in fact the paintings of what is after all Annibale's formative period-and they are among the first buds of the Baroque style in Europe!-which provide the essential key to his funda- mental reinterpretation of the formulae of classicism in the new Baroque sense. The obvious contrast between the general images one has of the works of Annibale and Caravaggio is a constant encouragement to maintain the purely classic interpretation of the former. The process of reasoning is simple. Caravaggio has borne the label of naturalism from the start, and it is now regarded as virtually interchangeable with his name; classicism is generally taken to be the traditional opposite of naturalism; there is a classic admixture in Annibale's late work and so it becomes logical to look upon it as the anti- thesis of naturalism. Moreover it is all too easy to point to the actual works and imply that because they are so very obviously different in appearance they can have no single trace of a common factor buried beneath the surface. Now I cannot see my way to endorsing these premisses, which I regard as altogether 1 It is perhaps necessary to make it clear that classicism, in the sense in which it is being used here, implies something more radical in the way of formal language than either the manifestation of an interest in objects surviving from classical antiquity or a feeling for the considered arrangement of solidly monumental forms-taking these characteristics by themselves. 2That is to say, with a very considerable number of works behind him which, to put it mildly, have nothing whatever to do with Tuscan-Roman classicism (though they do of course afford us certain hints of what Anni- bale's reaction to it was likely to be). It must be remembered also that the years 1605-1609 may be partly discounted from Annibale's working time in Rome, owing to his illness. 3 Agostino, who of course made less of a large-scale contribution (as a painter) than the other two, only had three or four years in Rome, and died some 18 months after leaving it. Even so, it is interesting to see how dif- ferent (as compared to Annibale) was the effect of Rome upon him; where a tendency towards monumental solidity and richness did not exist, it could not be developed and enhanced. 4 To what extent such a procedure (in effect, the ignoring of the physical ante- cedents of Annibale's Roman works) is justi- fiable art-historically is another question.</page><page sequence="33">ECLECTICISM AND THE CARRACCI 335 too rough and ready to cover a situation of such complexity as obtains at the beginning of the Seicento. In the first place, if Caravaggio and naturalism are treated as more or less synonymous, the term must in any case necessarily cover works which have no resemblance to each other in appearance, and which indeed (if we were not fully aware of the intermediate stages of develop- ment) no one would dream of attributing to the same hand for reasons of style alone. To take two of Caravaggio's greatest achievements, the term would cover the precise, deliberate, clear, and attractive Doria 'Rest on the Flight' and the loose, impressionistic, unclear, and monumental Messina 'Resurrection of Lazarus.'" In the light of the early work the late one could appear crude, while looking backwards from Sicily the early work could strike one as artificially refined; and yet this transformation of "naturalism" has occurred in less than two decades.2 Very well then, it could be argued, naturalism is something deeper than the mere appearance of the picture; it can be said to manifest itself in many different ways. Quite so; that is indeed the point. Returning to the premisses which I am inclined to question, I should have thought it was evident that there are recurrent moments in the history of art, not less significant for being short-lived, when the reaction against a highly "artificial" style-whether we describe it as Gothic, Mannerist, or Rococo- brings a form of what may by contrast be roughly called "classicism"' and a form of naturalism into brief alliance. The beginning of the Seicento is precisely just such a moment. Reluctance to accept formulae which seemed to have the sanction of convention alone-and a consequent interest in return- ing to a consultation with nature-provided a common starting-point for both Caravaggio and the Carracci.4 This was expressed in a practical manner by their method; Caravaggio actually painted direct from life as much as he could, and Baglione tells us that Annibale. too was largely responsible for reviving this practice.5 It is true of course (and there is nothing surprising 1 One of the most rewarding experiences I ever had was to see this really extraordinary masterpiece fully lit by arc-lights after the close of the Caravaggio Exhibition at Milan in 1951. 2 Only some fourteen years, according to the present writer's view of Caravaggio's chronology. 3 Obviously the term is used here very broadly, and in a formal sense. 4 For the bracketing together by another contemporary (Mancini) of the "better" manner of Caravaggio and Carracci vis-a-vis the manner of Barocci, cf. Dott. Salerno's quotation and remarks in Commentari, II, I1951, p. 37. r Malvasia (Felsina Pittrice, 1678, I, pp. 484- 485) has an interesting passage in which he complains that Annibale's method in prepar- ing the frescoes of the Galleria, with his care- ful studies from life, was too deliberate: ".. dando perci6 nello statuino un poco anch'egli, e perdendo quella risoluzione Veneziana, e Lombarda che cola manca, e di che tanto abbondava, poco fidandosi del suo gran sapere. Scrive l'Albani al Bonini li 24. Ottobre 1659. che perderono i Carracci molto, e rimasero poveri, perche non si fidavano delle loro forze, e potevano fare miglior opere a non le studiare tanto &amp;c. siami lecito, soggionge, il dire che Annibale Carracci abbozz6 di prattica il Christo morto in grembo alla Madre, che ? nell'Altare i S.

The reactions of the various parties to the story are illuminating. For Malvasia conscientious realism of this kind is classic ("statuino"), and he characteristically intro- duces the anecdote by way of illustrating what</page><page sequence="34">336 DENIS MAHON about it) that what interested them in nature was different. Caravaggio began from the point of view of a still-life painter; there is often a curious "bit by bit" quality in his large compositions which (if his powerful presentation does not blind us to it) gives them a strikingly deliberate character; natural and easy movement and a fluent unity over a large area (facets of naturalism-as opposed to Mannerism-which appealed to Annibale Carracci almost from the beginning) were uncongenial to Caravaggio. It is true that Caravaggio frequently (though not invariably) made use of self-evidently humble types and went out of his way to emphasize this fact in a manner which tended to conflict with the conventions of decoro; this was indeed a most remarkable departure, at any rate in Rome, but I trust it will not in consequence seriously be maintained that an artist who does not do just this has no claim to be interested in nature. After all-among the many types-there is a lively as well as a downright form of naturalism. If one looks at Annibale's works with attention one becomes conscious that he was not averse to humanizing the Olympians; and I cannot doubt that, if he had lived to see them, he would greatly have admired certain of Bernini's busts. Baroque art in its early phases, being (it must be emphasized) a reaction away from Mannerism, drew its original strength from nature; moreover it sprang from the camp of colore- the synonym for naturalistic art in the past. The fact that it was destined in its turn to become heavily stylized should not cause us to lose sight of its roots. The novelty of the form of classicism which Annibale introduced in his Roman period, and which differentiates it radically from High Renaissance classicism, was its Baroque flavour.' This could no doubt be analysed at tedious length; I have said something about it elsewhere, and shall content myself here with pointing out the strong emphasis given in the Galleria Farnese to those ostensible accessories the ornamenti, which in practice have a "distracting" character which a strict classicist would regard as undesirable. We may recall the controversy which occurred some decades afterwards in the Accademia di San Luca, during the presidency of Pietro da Cortona (1634-38). This turned on the extent to which large compositions should be "furnished" with figures-simplicity on the one hand, or richness and density on the other? Those who favoured the more classic view said that the same rule should hold good of a picture as applied to a tragedy, "la quale e tanto piji laudevole, quanto maggiore effetto ottiene con minori attori."'2 The view Annibale stood to lose in the way of northern spontaneity and directness (to which Mal- vasia was especially partial). Albani, how- ever, in passing on the incident of the Pieta to Bonini, seems to regret the lack of idealiza- tion which Annibale's method involved, and believed (probably correctly) that Domeni- chino's view was similar. For us, on the other hand, it is interesting to note the fact that even in his last phase Annibale had not dis- carded the practice of finishing from life. (The presence of Domenichino as a witness certifies to the relative lateness of the incident; the picture, which is now in the Louvre, was first seen in public in 1607, cf. my Studies in Seicento Art and Theory, p. I 14, note 18.) 1 Obviously it is not-and could not be, in the historical circumstances-fully developed Baroque. But it would be misleading to describe it as proto-Baroque, a term best applied to isolated elements in Renaissance or Mannerist art which foreshadow the Baroque. In the case of the Carracci the connexion is rather a matter of direct lineal descent. 2 Quotations relating to this matter are from Melchior Missirini's abstract from archival material on pp. I I2-3 of his Memorie per servire alla storia della Romana Accademia di S.

Annibale's conception in the Galleria seems to herald this sort of opinion. In fact he even provides us with the paradox that, in the case of some of the smaller scenes, the ornamenti which surround them have a more lifelike and organic quality; finally, when we are enjoying the positively sparkling vitality conferred on the stucchi finti by the feigned lighting we are pulled up short by a rottura! An idea of this kind has nothing to do with the High Renaissance and everything to do with the Baroque. Before leaving the subject of Annibale as a founding spirit of the Baroque I should like to glance at a concrete example. Agostino, whose polished and yet rather frozen style in his last phase did not lend itself to compositions in which emphatic overall rhythms ran through the whole and were capable of stirring weighty masses into movement, had developed an extremely graceful but (for all its show of movement) oddly static and staccato composition, almost like a bas-relief, for the so-called 'Galatea' which he was to paint in the Galleria Farnese. Agostino's cartoon (P1. 46a) shows the solution which he had proposed for the right side of the scene. The Triton, in spite of his almost too energetic posture, seems strangely congealed, and this passage is perhaps the least integrated part of the design. Annibale felt uncomfortable about the figure, and suggested an alternative (P1. 47),' which Agostino adopted in the fresco (P1. 46b), though without the exuberant brio which is so evident in Annibale's superb study; nevertheless, in spite of the process of desiccation which the figure undergoes in the fresco, it still stands somewhat apart, amid the elegances of Agostino, by reason of its vigorous solidity combined with an air of easy naturalness of movement. Annibale's method of dealing with this particular problem is a real artistic invention of the highest order; what is significant and vital about this thoroughly individual conception is its robustly Baroque character, and to speak, in its presence, of classicism or eclecticism seems curiously beside the point. It is, I hope, unnecessary to emphasize that the type of solution which Annibale put forward (presumably in I599) is one which would have appealed profoundly to Rubens and Bernini. It will be clear that I have misgivings on art-historical grounds with regard to the indiscriminate and slogan-like use, in the actual undeveloped state of our study of the Seicento, of certain venerable expressions hallowed by repetitive tradition. These include naturalism in the case of Caravaggio, and classicism and eclecticism in the case of Annibale Carracci.2 My objection is that, in effect, they tend to hinder us from grasping the character (and sometimes even the very existence!) of the real problems of what is actually a 1 Black chalk heightened with white on blue paper, 406 X 241I mm.; collection of Sir Bruce Ingram, O.B.E., M.C., Chesham, Buckinghamshire. 2To describe the latter's art baldly as "academic" can also hardly fail to be mis- leading in the same sort of way. I cannot go into the matter here, but would simply observe that the indiscriminate employment of this sort of expression is of course similarly bound up with failing to see an artistic personality "in the round."</page><page sequence="38">338 DENIS MAHON by no means simple phase in the history of art; or, to put it crudely, they function at the present moment as excuses for not troubling to look seriously at the works of art themselves. This indeed ought to be sufficient ground for undertaking the present inquiry. (b) Usage from the critical standpoint (as a qualitative term concerned with aesthetic judgment) Having outlined my reasons for regarding the term "eclectic" as mis- leading when applied to the paintings of the Carracci from the art-historical point of view, something remains to be said about its usage as a critical term. But the fact must first be emphasized that one of its greatest weaknesses in this connexion is precisely that it is nowadays employed without discrimination in both these different senses-sometimes purely analytical and descriptive, and at other times with strong qualitative implications; as a result it may be questioned whether there is sufficient warrant for using it, as is frequently done, as if there was general agreement about its meaning. I have discussed the semantic aspect of its modern employment elsewhere,1 and shall limit myself here to noting that Professor Lionello Venturi, in commenting on that article,2 steers clear of the real issue which I raised; this was that, owing to the impossibility in practice of assuming general agreement as to any definition which is not hopelessly imprecise, the expression is so confusing3 as to be entirely unsuited for serious critical usage. The fact that Professor Venturi proceeds to provide us with his own particular definition does not of course affect the point. Indeed it reinforces it, for the imprecision for practical purposes is actually increased when he proposes to abandon its use in a quasi- objective sense (to convey the idea of the analytically observed convergence of more than one influence in a given work of art) and to confine it to the indication of occasions when influences (a term also apt to be used with appalling looseness) are deemed to be not "assimilated" by the receiving artist.4 Two observations may be made about the latter approach. First, the issue of assimilation or otherwise, which now becomes crucial, is clearly a matter of subjective opinion, in the sense that it is not a question which can be referred to anything approaching an objective standard; and secondly, since none of us would dispute the general proposition that unassimilated influences tend to make a poor picture, the question of whether or not a painting con- tains such influences becomes in effect a matter of applied qualitative judg- ment in each particular case. In essence therefore the usage favoured by 1 Commentari, I, 1950, pp. 163 ff. 2 Op. cit., p. 169. 3 The confusion is of course all the greater in the case of the Carracci because its appli- cation to them can be shown to be the off- spring of an artificially constructed literary tradition. 4 This is apparently also the view of Profes- sor Lee when referring strictly to the works of art (op. cit., p. 212). I should have thought, however, that he was open to a charge of inconsistency in using the term, when refer- ring to the sources, in a sense which is radically different; he presumably would not go so far as to maintain that when the early writers (as he puts it) recognized an "eclectic character," that recognition carried the same qualitative implication as does his own usage.</page><page sequence="39">ECLECTICISM AND THE CARRACCI 339 Professor Venturi (and also presumably by Professor Lee'), while perfectly plausible theoretically, boils down in actual practice to a roundabout way of expressing the opinion that a picture is good or bad. If a critic judges that it is bad or (to put it more impressively in Crocean fashion) not an "absolute" work of art, he has (if it be by a Carracci) at his disposal in support of his subjective judgment an ostensibly objective reason ready-made (which how- ever-ironically enough-happens to be the descendant, greatly transformed, of an equally ready-made formula for expressing the exact critical op- posite). I should agree that the Crocean concepts, which Professor Venturi invokes, of the absolute artistic personality and the absolute work of art have a perfectly legitimate theoretical existence; but so too, I should add, has the concept of absolute criticism. When, however, theoretical abstraction is left behind and concrete practical questions are faced, the problem is to ascertain precisely where, as between the work of art and the critic, this absoluteness- or the lack of it-lies. The specific application of such general theoretical terms to particular works of art or artists prejudges the issue and is apt to lend a spurious aura of objectivity to a critical judgment-as if we carried with us a sort of critical litmus-paper which revealed absolute personality, unabsorbed influences and the like in an uncontrovertible manner. Nevertheless by this means a category of absolute works of art, supposedly recognizable as such, is brought into existence (from which of course eclectic works are by definition excluded as different in kind). But serious inconsistencies are likely to arise from the adoption in concrete practice of such an essentially abstract concept; in Professor Venturi's case, for example, we find that the Carracci are said to be better eclectics than most-a contradiction in terms, if we accept his premisses. There is no need to stress the evident fact that two participants, the critic as well as the work of art, are present in any act of critical judgment, and that the accuracy of the latter (or, in theoretical terms, its pureness or absolute- ness as criticism) is in practice related to the success of the critic in the recognition and exclusion of extraneous or irrelevant issues from his criticism. There can be few cases in which caution in this respect is more obviously called for than in that of the 9arracci. An investigation of the possibilities of being led astray in this matter (some aspects of which we have dealt with on the present occasion) yields reasons for believing that the whole eclectic inter- pretation of the Carracci, in its many and varied ramifications, is a construc- tion of extremely artificial character, suffering indeed from that very surfeit of culture which Professor Venturi wishes to employ as a stick to belabour the artists. We have been chiefly concerned, of course, with the bringing to light of misunderstandings in the past; but it is still possible to produce more or less fresh ones to-day. An instance of this is provided by Professor Venturi's sudden and gratuitous introduction of the Counter-Reformation as a vicarious channel for criticism of the Carracci, who, he says, "non hanno osato salire 1 While Professors Lee and Venturi are in agreement on this point, it may be noted that they appear to differ as to another potential ingredient of eclecticism. For Professor Lee it is the classicism of the Carracci which is essentially eclectic, but for Professor Venturi there is no necessary connexion between eclecticism and classicism.</page><page sequence="40">340 DENIS MAHON sul rogo, ne quello di Bruno ne quello di Caravaggio."' What however does a sweeping pronouncement of this kind really mean? It suggests that Cara- vaggio's personal misfortunes were due to his artistic non-conformity. But this is utterly wide of the mark; in so far as events concerned with his private life permitted it, the fame and success which he could command as a result of having launched a non-conformist type of art were very considerable. His story was no doubt tragic, but the pyre he mounted was largely personal. He was not in any real sense a victim of the spirit of the Counter-Reformation, and dislike of dogma of all kinds (which I share with Professor Venturi) is no justification for implying that Caravaggio, an awkward member of society like many men of genius, was something in the nature of a "hero of the resistance." Such an interpretation (though I believe it to be without founda- tion) provides a convenient contrast for denigrating the Carracci who (quite misleadingly, in my opinion) can be depicted as dogma-ridden, oppressed by traditional "culture," conformist, and so on.2 Obviously the applied criticisms of those who give credence to some form of the eclectic interpretation and those who have no preconceptions of this kind will differ on certain points. Thus, though Professor Venturi and I can agree (for example) on the high quality of the Doria lunette of 'La Fuga in Egitto,' we get into difficulties over such a picture as the Naples 'Ercole al bivio.' For him it is an "opera mancata," but for me (I am speaking of the actual painting in so far as I can see it through a thick layer of discoloured varnish) it is a veritable masterpiece with the quite unmistakable stamp of a highly distinctive artistic personality upon it. On a matter of this kind we must resign ourselves to the fact that our individual spectacles seem to reveal an entirely different image; but the example may serve to illustrate the fallacy (to which Professors Venturi and Lee are both partial) of asserting almost in one breath that the evidence of eclecticism is to be found both in the actual works and in contemporary opinion. Professor Venturi, for whom eclecticism is a qualitative category, would point to what he believes to be the poor quality of the 'Ercole al bivio' in justification of his view that the picture can be properly described as eclectic. But can he really believe that anyone in the Seicento-and I include men of great artistic comprehension-would have depreciated the quality of this work to the level of an "opera mancata"? To those familiar with opinion at the time such a notion would seem frankly incredible. And it is by no means a question of merely classic-idealist opinion. While it may be admitted that Poussin had a considerable admiration for Annibale (and I cannot see that this is necessarily so very damaging a fact for the reputation of the latter), exactly the same is true of Bernini. Both would,. I feel sure, have seen a great deal in this picture. The young artist who (as Albani tells us) admired the 'Santa Margherita' in Santa Caterina dei Funari could hardly have thought the 'Ercole' a defective performance; personally I am inclined to think that Caravaggio looked at Annibale's work with more than casual interest. Nor can I believe that Rubens would have 1 Commentari, I, 1950, p. 170. 2Not, of course, that I would admit for one moment the proposition implied by Professor Venturi that conformity or non-conformity can properly be treated as a general touch- stone of artistic quality; it may or may not be relevant in particular cases.</page><page sequence="41">ECLECTICISM AND THE CARRACCI 341 classed this as anything but a painting of the first order. However they might have expressed it, the opinion of these men (not exactly ill-equipped in artistic matters, and with a fresher approach in a question of this kind than is possible for most of us to-day) would surely have been far from unfavourable to Annibale. Perhaps I may conclude by emphasizing that I am not making sweeping claims for the Carracci as artists; I am simply asking that their works should be looked at-and even enjoyed !-freshly and for their own sakes, without preconceptions. While it is sufficiently obvious to me that Annibale (while not a supreme genius) produced a notable series of really great paintings, and demonstrated in his masterly Galleria that a monumental work on the grand scale could be most carefully planned and yet not lose its vitality and intensity in the process, there can be little doubt, for example, that his illness affected the quality of his art for several years. Lodovico, volatile and unequal, lost his backbone with the departure of Annibale, and painted indifferent pictures on occasion. The three were, however, a remarkable phenomenon in their early days when they were working in contact with each other, sharing a novel, experimental and inquisitive outlook and a determination to avoid convention and to "find out for themselves." In order to appreciate the varied drive and enthusiasm of this phase one has only to spend a few hours studying a work still almost unknown except to specialists, the great frieze of Palazzo Magnani-which I am tempted to describe as the Adam and Eve of Baroque decoration. It will be clear enough that a critical impasse has been reached of the kind on which one can only agree to differ and to allow time to judge the issue. I hope I have made it evident that a real problem exists and that it is not one to be solved offhand without careful deliberation and expenditure of con- siderable effort. In order to arrive at as objective a judgment as possible it is necessary to become as intimately acquainted as we may be able with the artists concerned, and also (less obvious, perhaps, but vital if the relation between historical sense and true criticism is acknowledged) with the artistic milieu within the bounds of which they had to work. In the meantime, I would suggest that there is a weighty case for abandoning the use of the term "eclectic" in connection with the Carracci, if only on the score that its gross imprecision for practical purposes makes intelligible discussion of their works confusingly difficult if not impossible.
