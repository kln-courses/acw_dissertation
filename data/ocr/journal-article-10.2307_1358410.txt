"What Remains," Chapter Four, high- lights the legacy of AIDS and its impact within the lesbian community. Safe sex is addressed in the photographic construction by Tessa Boffin's (1962-93, England) Angel- ic Rebels: Lesbians and Safer Sex (1989). The American team Leone and Macdonald, in Ashes, Ashes We All Fall Down (1989-91), created a braille message in sand that docu- mented the names of friends who had died from AIDS. The title recalls the English nursery rhyme that refers to the bubonic plague. The raised sand dots (braille) stand like sentinels in memory of the lost lives. Belying this seemingly simple aesthetic is a powerfully reflective work. Lesbian activist and grassroots urban community work addressing sexism, racism, and sexual violence against women are the subjects dealt with in Chapter Five, "Mean Streets." The collective DAM (Dyke Action Machine), which evolved in New York City in 1990 from Queer Nation, was founded to heighten lesbian visibility. Their poster Straight to Hell (1994) depicts a dyke gang of three: an African-American, a Caucasian, and an Asian. Shot from below, wearing "gang-boy gear," these three offer an impos- ing image that reiterates the defiance of the title. Also working outside New York's art gallery setting is the group of four, Fierce Pussy, that, like the Guerilla Girls, uses posters and photocopies to subterfuge main- stream art activities. The work of several conceptual artists is encapsulated within Chapter Six, "Material Seduction." Jaya Schiirch's (b. Switzerland, lives in Italy) VII (Clam) (1994) is an ex- quisite minimalist sculpture in Staturio mar- ble. The artist speaks: "My hands retain a physical memory of shapes and curves that I love in a body." (98) Other works wittily draw on Duchampian reconstitutions of found objects, for example, Julia Kunin's (b. USA) Eggboard (1991). "Cartoonesque," Chapter Seven, includes artists using ani- mation and cartoon. Patricia Torres's oil on canvas, On the Air (1989), could well have been placed in an earlier chapter; however, the figures are stylized and cartoonlike. Leslie Bostrom's (b. USA) woodcut, Baby- dolls in Love (1995), shows two huge car- toon heads on tiny bodies. The tongue on the brunette to the left plunges into the ear of the blonde. The final chapter, "Parallel Worlds," in- cludes artists who use a variety of media to explore the worlds of the imaginary. Meta- morphosed male saints appear in women's bodies in the work of French sculptural team Ange et Damnation. Svar Simpson's 0 (b. England) meditative, androgynous plas- ter Cat Yogi (1983) is followed by Linda De- ment's (b. Australia) digitized From Cyber- flesh Monster (1995). In crossing boundaries into cyberspace Dement opens up arenas hitherto unexplored. The arena of the phan- tasmagorical is played out in her virtual spaces by anthropomorphic beings. This informative and provocative but by no means exhaustive book offers discussion couched strongly within current queer cul- ture and discourse positionings. It no doubt will provide encouragement to many. The brutal honesty and forthright nature of les- bian politics of desire and resistance is a sig- nature of the artworks represented. The text and images successfully fill a gap in the doc- umentation of lesbian, and more broadly speaking women's, art practice at this fin de siecle. Don't be shy, read it for yourself. NOTES 1.

At Beck and Call: The Representation of Domestic Servants in Nineteenth-Century American Painting by Elizabeth O'Leary Smithsonian Institution, 1996 Reviewed by Mary Ann Stankiewicz hey stand in the shadows, behind the family members, on the edges of the room, or in an open doorway. Their clothing is muted, providing a neutral backdrop for the real subjects of the paintings. The earliest 19th-century portrayals of household servants relegate both male and female workers to the margins of the canvas. By the end of the cen- tury, however, male servants have almost dis- appeared from view. The subject of the paint- ing is a kitchen maid, house maid, or server. Her skin is luminous; it glows in the light that pours into the picture like Vermeer's Dutch sunlight. The objects that surround her are painted as carefully as she-the porcelain vase, brocade chair, and silver candelabra gleam in the cool light. In some paintings she becomes another precious object, like the blue cup or Chinese figurine, announcing the collector's good taste and refined sensibility. In At Beck and Call, Elizabeth O'Leary, a historian of American art who lives in Rich- mond, Virginia, traces changing depictions of domestic servants from colonial portraits of boys and men with their African-American menservants through early-20th-century paintings by the Boston School in which Irish Bridget becomes another beautiful object necessary to the Brahmin lifestyle. During her research she uncovered 150 images, rang- ing from Thomas Nast's racist mid-century caricatures to Cecilia Beaux's 1894 Ernesta (Child with Nurse), a charming portrait of a child holding the hand of a faceless, anony- mous caregiver. The book includes 118 illus- trations, only 8 in color. O'Leary examines 19th-century paintings as social documents that both recorded and contributed to the so- cial reproduction of contemporary beliefs and values. Her topic enables her to examine crit- ically issues of class, gender, race, and ethnic- ity in American life. O'Leary's exploration of the complex relationships among painted im- ages, ideologies, and social history is both thoughtful and thought-provoking. The first chapter shows how early-19th- century ideas and images were influenced by colonial and British models. Late-18th-centu- ry images of African-American servants standing in the margins of their masters' por- traits followed British models by depicting passive black figures whose function was to enhance the white master. In Chapter 2, WOMAN'S ART JOURNAL</page><page sequence="2">O'Leary explores tensions be- tween the democratic rhetoric of equality in the early republic and the reality that white males con- tinued to control. One indication of this tension can be found in the question of how to refer to one's household help. Free white workers were no longer willing to be called servant, a term later codified to mean black domestic worker. Labels such as "hired hand" and "help" reflected the independence of native-born white workers as well as flexible boundaries between employer and employee. Although some images from this period demon- strate the same fluid status of master and man, others reveal the evolving space between do- mestic help and family members. Fig. 1. L Chapter 3 examines growing distinctions between male and female spheres and increasing separateness between employ- ers and their help, especially as depicted by Lilly Martin Spencer (1822-1902). In spite of the democratic rhetoric of a classless society during the 19th century, almost one-third of middle- and upper-class American homes em- ployed at least one domestic worker. Most were women. O'Leary does not miss the irony that women could be ladies only when other women did the household work. As class dis- tinctions increased and solidified during the post-Civil W\ar years, stereotypes of female servants as dirty, coarse, and sexually available increased. WVhen Spencer depicted a female baker extending her dough-covered hand as independent, bright, and capable in Shake Hands? (1854), one art reviewer noted that maids like that no longer existed. Even though (or perhaps because) this image contradicted the stereotypes, Shake Hands? was widely re- produced, establishing the artist's reputation. As a woman and artist, Spencer knew that the ideologies of innate female domesticity and the vulgar inferiority of women domestic workers were overdrawn. She relied on the intelligence and dedication of her own do- mestic workers to keep her complex house- hold running smoothly while she supported the family by her painting. She also used her help as models for her popular pictures. As the 19th century drew to a close, Spencer, like many other Americans, "became ambiva- lent and then hostile toward servants." (108) One reason for this attitudinal change was the increase in employment of immigrants. By mid-19th century most servants were African-Americans or Irish immigrants. Just as attitudes toward women of any class were shaped by depictions of them as domestic illy Martin Spencer, Dixie's Land (1862),oil on canvas, 20" x Gesner Fine Art, Largo, Florida. objects that enhanced the lifestyle of the leisure class, so attitudes toward these groups were shaped and reinforced by depictions of them as servants. Spencer's generous paint- ings of white domestic servants-some have argued that they were housewives not help- did not extend to African Americans. She had little experience of the South and there is no documentation of her attitude toward slavery. Her depiction of a young African- American servant girl with the blond toddler who is her charge, in Dixie's Land (1862; Fig. 1), is quite discomforting. In a text panel exhibited with the painting, Spencer identi- fied the servant as "Dinah." In Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin, Dinah was the head cook for the white family that owned the plantation. As O'Leary explains in Chapter 4, Dinah and Bridget become the ying and yang of servant stereotypes, African-American cook and Irish maid. Al- though Stowe's description of Dinah implied that she was capable and independent-mind- ed, Spencer's Dinah seems more akin to Prissy from Gone With the Wind preoccu- pied with her own amusements, perhaps less trustworthy as a babysitter than the shaggy dog at the child's right. Spencer painted many balanced and fully human pictures of white serving women, but in this portrayal of an African-American servant she accepted and furthered common caricatures. During the middle third of the century, popular im- ages and works of fine art showed white and black servants in ways that supported grow- ing prejudices. The fifth chapter documents a subtle shift from caricatures of ethnic stereotypes to what O'Leary calls "picturesque servility." (160) The wealth of an urban, industrial soci- FALL 1998 / WINTER 1999 ety made possession and display of the right accessories important. Butlers had more cachet than hired men. Maids were asked to wear the proper uniform that an- nounced their status as well as that of their employer. African-Ameri- can women who worked with young children became "Mammy." Just as one needed to purchase the right European paintings to an- nounce one's taste and class, so one acquired an appropriate ret- inue of servants. In the sixth and final chapter, O'Leary examines paintings of the Boston School in which the lovely Irish house maid becomes another object for contemplation within a tranquil, upper-class home. By this period, between 1892 and 25". 1923, painting had become a rar- efied fine art, less a reflection of modern American life than the creation of a world where one might escape that life. Threatened by the growing political power of the Irish in late-19th century Boston, by increased immigration before the first WNorld W\ar, and by the passage in 1920 of the 19th amendment granting female suf- frage, conservative Boston Brahmins re- sponded by advocating legislation to restrict immigration and by creating images of pas- sive women carefully tending beautiful ob- jects. Although O'Leary identifies these women as domestic workers, it is also easy to see them as spouses or sisters, assigned to a domestic role by the male painter to keep them in the margins of society. O'Leary does an excellent job of analyzing her subject in all its complexities. Her book helps us understand American attitudes to- ward women, ethnic minorities, and our too often unrecognized class structure. She offers new interpretations of familiar paintings and meaningful readings of unfamiliar works, adding a new dimension to standard histories of American art. Beaux's Ernesta (Child with Nurse), she explains, advertises the parents' ability to purchase "perfect, silent service" for their precious child. (189) One of the strongest reasons to recommend At Beck and Call, however, is its accessibility. O'Leary bal- ances careful readings of images with docu- mentary evidence and interpretations drawn from social history. As interdisciplinary stud- ies emerge from the margins of scholarship, one can only hope to see more work like this.
