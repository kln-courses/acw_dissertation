<plain_text><page sequence="1">Journal of A merican Folklore The Negro in Northern Brazil: A Study in Acculturation. By Octavio da Costa Eduardo. (Monographs of the American Ethnological Society, Vol. 15, New York: J. J. Augustin, I948. Pp. I31.) This book describes certain aspects of the culture of present-day Negroes in one state of northern Brazil, Maranhao, against the background of a sustained contact which African culture, brought to Maranhao by the slaves, has had with the culture of Brazil since 1761, more than two centuries after Negro slavery had been introduced into other parts of Brazil. The slaves carried to Maranhao came principally from four sections of West Africa: Angola, the neighboring Congo regions, the Guinea Coast, and Senegal. The title of the book is misleading since the study, limited to only one state of the several states in northern Brazil in which the Negro population is quite considerable, does not show that the situation in this state is typical of that in north- ern Brazil generally. Those aspects of Negro life with which the book deals-(i) the ways of earning a livelihood, (2) family life, (3) religion, (4) the soul, the guardian angel, and the rites of death-have been observed and recorded with great care and thoroughness. How- ever, the manner in which the contact of African and Brazilian cultures has affected other phases of the culture of Negroes in Maranhao, such as music, folk literature, language, art, etc., is revealed only slightly and indirectly in the author's discussion of religion. Based upon fieldwork investigation of the acculturative processes in two different settings-a rural and an urban community-the study attempts to answer such problems as the following: "Has the urban environment facilitated acculturation more than the rural setting? Is the urban group more European and less African than the rural? What have been and what are the factors at work in both communities? Has integration of religious beliefs and other cultural forms, if this has been achieved at all, been greater in the interior than in the city? Why?" As regards the ways of earning a livelihood, the Negroes in the rural community chosen (Santo Antonio) live a simple life. Their houses are mud-plastered structures thatched with palm leaves and meagerly furnished. Men and women alike work in the fields, and rice is the crop most cultivated. Cooperative work is common, espe- cially in agriculture and house building, though there are no permanent cooperative work. groups. In the urban community studied (Sao Luiz) the standard of living among the Negroes is generally low. Most of them live in the suburbs of the city in mud-plastered houses, but they wear better clothes than the rural inhabitants and their meals are more diversified. The men are employed as day laborers, factory workers, masons, shoemakers, tailors, porters, stevedores, and street vendors, or they hold positions in the city and state governments. The women serve as cooks, house- maids, laundresses, factory workers, and vendors in the streets and market places. There are fewer opportunities in the city for cooperative work than in the rural com- munity, but house-thatching is often done cooperatively in Sao Luiz. Though the Negroes of Maranhao participate in a typically Western economic system, there are two aspects of their economic life that are of African derivation: (i) the patterns of cooperative work, traceable to Africa through gang labor under slavery, but today less noticeable in the city because of day labor, and (2) the high status of women, especially in the country-traceable through slavery to the independent economic position of African women. Chapter IV, dealing with family life, is more questionable methodologically than the other chapters of the book. Here it is stated that in both the rural and the urban community, common-law unions or other extralegal relationships among the Negroes are considerably more frequent than those having a religious and legal sanction, and 49o</page><page sequence="2">some statistics are cited to support the statement. In explaining this situation the author gives considerable weight to the African background of the Maranhao Negroes as well as to conditions incident to slavery and to present factors of a socio-economic order. He interprets the situation as a "new form which was acceptable in the time of slavery to Whites and Negroes alike," apparently a sort of compromise between the African polygynous tradition and the "European's practice of monogamy." In studies of this type, however, one usually looks in vain for statistics on the relations between the sexes among other ethnic groups in the areas concerned which are absolutely necessary before valid conclusions can be drawn as to the uniqueness of the high inci- dence or the probable origin of the customs among Negroes. Are these types of re- lationship more prevalent among other groups of similar socio-economic status? If they are widespread among these, is this the result of borrowing from Africans, or have both Africans and these other groups brought similar family forms with them from the Old World? Could similar conditions of life in the New World have brought into being similar customs? If they are not widespread among other persons, is there a possibility that they once were, and that in the case of present-day Negroes we are dealing with a cultural lag? Certainly there is evidence of such types of relationship in many parts of the Old World, as cited in W. G. Sumner's Folkways, Chapters IX and X, and in other sources. In the religious life of the Maranhao Negroes the African influence is pronounced, especially in the case of the religious practices of certain groups of city Negroes. It appears that African religious ceremonies in the rural areas were suppressed by slave- owners, but there are many African cult houses in urban areas, the most important of which are Dahomean, Yoruban, and Yoruban-derived. The paucity of Angola- Congo cults and the absence of Senegalese ones appear to be due to the fact that these peoples were not well organized and therefore were less able to resist attack. As in Bahia, Brazil, the Dahomean and Yoruban cult houses of Maranhao have merged African and Catholic beliefs; and in some, Indian elements have been added, such as the tradition of the use of magic called pagelanqa or cura. African nature deities are equated with the Catholic saints who control natural phenomena and sickness, con- cepts of the soul and the guardian angel with personal spirits, and beliefs regarding the souls of the dead with the cult of the dead. The fact that the Catholic beliefs of the Negroes have much in common with African religious attitudes and patterns of worship has contributed to the blending of differing beliefs and facilitated the Negroes' acceptance of the Catholic religion. The worship of deities in the Dahomean and Yoruban cult houses of Maranhao follows closely the African patterns, though syncretisms between Catholic and African elements are noticeable in ritual and belief. In the Dahomean center the songs and drum rhythms accompanying the dances are pure African. The phenomenon of possession is essentially the same in all cult groups, but more restrained in the Dahomean. In the newest houses of worship elements of European and Indian origin are being integrated with African beliefs and practices. In the rural community the African influence is noticeable in ritualistic dances dur- ing which the participants are "possessed" by African-like spirits called encantados, the musical accompaniment being provided by the drum, musical bows, and rattles- all of African origin. The lyrics of the songs, though principally in Portuguese, are interspersed with African words and phrases. The belief of the rural Negroes in magic appears to be due to both African and European traditions. On the whole, the rural community has been less conducive to the survival of African religious practices than the urban setting. Some of the ideas held by the Maranhao Negroes concerning the guardian angel and the soul suggest the Dahomean and Yoruban concept of multiple souls. Death Reviews 49I</page><page sequence="3">Journal of American Folklore among the rural Negroes is marked both by European rituals and by ceremonies re- flecting the influence of African customs. Among the African features are the provid- ing of food and drink for the mourners, the visit to the grave, and story-telling during the wake of a child. Syncretization of African and European customs is noted in the intervention of the African-like spirits during the funeral and in the attitudes of fear, respect, and "worship" revealed toward the soul of a person who has recently died. Among the city Negroes mortuary rites are essentially the same as those among the whites with the exception of the great importance attached to the dead person's being properly buried. Among Africans, only one who is properly buried can enter the land of the dead and there assume his rightful place. At the wakes there are games reminis- cent of the festivities in Africa to amuse and honor the dead; and in the cult houses of the city the ceremonies for the dead are closer to the African pattern than in the rural areas. The book, on the whole, is excellent for the care it reveals in the recording of details of the cultural elements chosen for study and in the analysis and interpretation of the acculturative processes. Especially is this true of Chapters III, V, and VI. Investiga- tions of this kind are rare and are greatly needed. This one should inspire more studies employing the same approach in other New World areas. LORENZO D. TURNER Roosevelt College, Chicago, Illinois Grundziige des Estnischen Volksglaubens I. By Oskar Loorits. (Skrifter Utgivna av Kungl. Gustav Adolfs Akademien f6r Folkslivforskning, i8: i, Lund: Carl Bloms Boktryckeri A.-B., I949. Pp. xvi+591.) The author of this volume used to be director of the Estonian Folklore Archives founded in I927; he now resides, along with many another distinguished Estonian scholar, in Sweden. The importance of Estonia in folklore is well known: its remarkably rich collection of materials, products of the intermingling of eastern and western traits superimposed upon the ancient Uralic heritage, runs well over seven hundred thousand pages. Publi- cations based on the Archives are impressive both as to quality and quantity, and the name of Loorits is prominently associated with these in both respects. The present work-produced under the handicap of its author's exile from the Archives-is offered as a synthesis of much new information concerning Estonian religious beliefs rather than as a testing ground for fresh hypotheses. The subject being complex and multifarious, there is a great deal of internal cross-referencing and some repetitiousness, but what the fabric of organization lacks in smoothness is more than compensated for by the comprehensive and definitive coverage. There is an Estonian folk song which claims: "When I die, I shall disintegrate into three parts-my body (ihu) will go into the grave and my soul (hing) into heaven; my name (nimi) will be stirring on earth." Accordingly, the early chapters deal with these major topics: mana, live bodies and corpses, shades and associated spooks, the breath as soul, names and allied verbal tabus. The second half of the first volume is devoted to special spirits, transformations, animism, mythological concepts, ghosts, anthropomorphism, and guardian spirits. A sorely wanted index will be published, it is announced, after the completion of the entire work, that is, presumably, after the second volume appears. The thread of argument is bolstered throughout with texts-tales and legends, proverbs, and songs-translated from Estonian into German as literally as possible; it is illustrated with maps and photographs. 492</page></plain_text>
