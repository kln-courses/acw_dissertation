DAVIES DUKE UNIVERSITY, DURHAM, NC 27706 HE place of Albert Schweitzer in the history of the interpretation of the NT is secure. Although the predominance of the History of Religions School often led to the neglect of his work, especially in Germany, ultimately it could not be ignored; and that for one reason. Along with Johannes Weiss, Schweitzer established once and for all the eschatological dimensions of the NT. Necessary modifications of his work, compelled by C. H. Dodd and others, have not shaken the rightness of his main emphasis. The continuing insistence on eschatology by Schweitzer's fellow Alsacian, Oscar Cullmann, in many influential studies, the recent reiteration of apocalyptic as the matrix of Christian theology by E. Kasemann,2 U. Wilckens,3 and others, the emerging concentration on the examination of the apocrypha and pseudepigrapha, especially in this country,4 and the call by Klaus Koch to rediscover apocalyptic5 - all implicitly reinforce the significance of Schweitzer's contribution. '*Context determines content." This rediscovery of the significance of apocalyptic for the theological understanding of the NT has been stimulated by the temper of our disjointed times, and by certain important discoveries. *The Albert Schweitzer Memorial Lecture at the meeting of the Society of Biblical Literature and the American Academy of Religion, 1 November 1975, The Palmer House, Chicago, Illinois.

Here I want to point to still another sphere (not strictly a source) where we can find illumination for the understanding of the apocalyptic world within which the writers of the NT moved. The invitation to prepare this lecture arrived when I was re-reading Gershom G. Scholem's great work Sabbatai Svi: The Mystic Messiah, 1626- 1676.6 Its relevance for the study of the NT struck me with renewed force, and I dared offer as a title, "From Schweitzer to Scholem." This theme turned out to be too broad, and I can only deal with the prolegomena to it. I shall offer reflections on the value of Scholem's study for what could lead to a re- assessment of Schweitzer's work. These reflections, which have turned out to be more interrogatory than affirmative, are based mainly on Sabbatai Svi, but also on Scholem's other profound contributions to the study of messianism and mysticism. I emphasize that it is impossible to do justice to their vast riches and deep penetration here. I rely entirely upon Scholem's interpretation of the sources for Sabbatianism (a fact which he would be the first to admit is not without its dangers)7 and shall consider the purpose of this lecture fulfilled if only it helps to integrate Scholem's insight into the nature of Judaism more closely into the study of Christian origins. I Sabbatai Svi was born in Smyrna in 1626. In 1648 he proclaimed himself to be the Messiah, but was met with scorn. Three years later the Jewish community outlawed him. But in 1665 Nathan of Gaza, a young rabbi trained in the talmudic schools in Jerusalem, became convinced, through a vision, that Sabbatai Svi was the Messiah. He persuaded a reluctant Sabbatai of his messianic destiny and proceeded to disseminate the astounding news of his identity throughout the diaspora. The movement spread to Jewish com- munities in Yemen and Persia in the East and to those in the West as far as England, Holland, Russia, and Poland. It was stirred by massive repentance, expressed in fasts and mortifications, and by extraordinary enthusiasm, visions, and miracles. The date of the end of all things was fixed for 1666 but was conveniently moved when necessary. The antinomian acts of Sabbatai Svi 6 Sbty Sby whtnw'h hsbt'yt bymy hyyw (Tel Aviv: Am Oved, 1957); now excellently translated into English by R. J.

He quotes Byron's query: "Who will then explain the explanation?" 530</page><page sequence="3">DAVIES: REFLECTIONS ON SABBATAI SVI failed to dampen the enthusiasm of the believers, who through him were experiencing the emotional reality of redemption. Neither the astounding apostasy of Sabbatai Svi to Islam and his attempts to persuade believers to apostatize, nor even his death destroyed the movement. There still exist a few believers in Sabbatai Svi.8 Scholem has traced the history of this Messiah and his movement. Can a seventeenth century messianic movement illumine Early Christianity? The dangers of parallelomania (especially when movements long separated in time are compared) are familiar, particularly since Samuel Sandmel's noted address on this theme.9 But this being recognized, I welcome one salutary outcome of Protestant-Roman Catholic interchange in our time. Protestants have tended to think that movements are best understood in the light of their origins; Catholics, in terms of their developments. We now see more clearly that both origins and developments help to reveal the essence of movements. We can learn much about the nature of apocalyptic in the first century from the ways in which it expressed itself in the seventeenth. Scholem is right to draw attention to phenomena in early Christianity which seem to be illumined by counterparts in Sabbatianism. Was Sabbatianism directly influenced by Christianity? Scholem faced this question.10 Sabbatai himself had a real interest in those who claimed to be messiahs before him, especially in Jesus. Some Gentile Christian chiliasts were well informed about Sabbatianism and perhaps were indirectly influential in shaping it. But direct Christian influences cannot be proved, and Scholem prefers to regard Sabbatianism as an independent, indigenous phenomenon within Judaism. 1 In Sabbatianism, we can examine in depth a major Jewish messianic movement, other than Christianity. One point is of special note. If an early Christian Aramaic literature was ever written, it has not survived. The documents produced by early Christianity are few and are written in Greek. There is a sparse leanness about them. They demand infinite labor to give them flesh and blood, color and substance. The NT is a distillation. On the contrary, in Sabbatianism, thanks to the immeasurable labors of Scholem, the documentation is rich.12 Through it one can feel and know the historical actuality of the movement more directly than is the case with early Christianity. We shall attempt to show what Scholem's work offers the student of the NT under three headings: first, the new light it sheds on the nature of Judaism; second, on messianism; and third on early Christianity. 8 For all this see G. G. Scholem, Sabbatai Svi; and Major Trends, 286-324. 9 JBL 81 (1962) 1-13. 10 Sabbatai Svi, 153-54, 166. " Ibid., 284-86. 12 Scholem draws upon contemporary documents.

New Light on the Nature of Judaism To begin with, the Judaism which one encounters in Sabbatianism does not conform to the picture of it handed on to us even by Jewish scholars. Long ago, Scholem had emphasized two hitherto ignored facets of Judaism: the deep penetration of it by mystical currents, and the domestication of apocalyptic within Pharisaism.13 The picture of a predominantly halakic Judaism, largely untouched by mystic experiences and apocalyptic visions, has had to be abandoned. Scholem has now further unearthed and examined a world of mystical secrets, symbols, images, enthusiasms, and esoterica which rabbinic leaders and scholars had considered unworthy of serious attention and treated with contempt. In doing so, he has further discredited the concept of a normative pharisaic Judaism. 14 He has made such a concept untenable, not only by insisting on the two broad aspects hitherto denied to Judaism referred to, but also in a more detailed way. To illustrate, let us consider one phenomenon in Sabbatianism which has customarily been taken to be utterly non-Jewish. Judaism has usually been described as insisting on the qualitative difference between God and man. The notion of the divinity of a human being was regarded as one of the marks of Hellenistic religion which sharply differentiated it from the Jewish. 5 The doctrine of the incarnation has always been regarded as the Rubicon between Christianity and Judaism. But the case 13 See Major Trends, 40-79. The thesis of D. Rossler (Gesetz und Geschichte [WMANT 2; Neukirchen-Vluyn: Neukirchener Verlag, 1960]), distinguishing sharply between rabbinic and apocalyptic Judaism, although very influential in German circles (for example in the work of U. Wilckens - see K. Koch, Rediscovery of Apocalyptic, 40), is untenable. See, among others, A. Nissen, "Tora und Geschichte im Spatjudentum," NovT 9 (1967) 241-77. I urged the interpenetration of Pharisaism and apocalyptic in Exp Tim 49 (1948) 233-37. Cf. O. Cullmann, Salvation in History (Philadelphia: Fortress, 1967) 60. This interpenetration, with varying emphases, is now generally conceded. See Joshua Bloch, On the Apocalyptic (JQRMS 2; Philadelphia: Dropsie College, 1952); and Scholem's works. 14 Made familiar by G. F. Moore but increasingly abandoned. The works of E. Bickerman, D. Daube, S. Lieberman, and M. Smith have abundantly established the interpenetration between Hellenism and Judaism by the first century, so that Pharisaism itself can be regarded as a hybrid. See my Paul and Rabbinic Judaism (4th ed.; New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1967) 1-16; my "Reflexions on Tradition: The Aboth Revisited," Christian History and Interpretation: Studies Presented to John Knox (eds. W. R. Farmer, C. F. D. Moule, and R. R. Niebuhr; New York/London: Cambridge University, 1967) 138-51; and now, above all, the monumental study of Martin Hengel, Judaism and Hellenism (2 vols.; Philadelphia: Fortress, 1974). For important reviews of the latter, see M. Stern, Kirjath Sepher 46 (1970-71) 94-99; and A. Momigliano, JTS21 (1970) 149-53. For a summary statement, see H. A. Fischel, "Greek and Latin Languages, Rabbinical Knowledge of," Encyclopaedia Judaica (16 vols.; New York: Colliers-Macmillan, 1972) 884-87. For a summary statement of the variety of first-century pharisaic Judaism, see M. Stone, "Judaism at the Time of Christ," Scientific American 115 (1973) 79-87. But the historically significant stratum of first-century Judaism proved to be the pharisaic, so that whatever its comparative numerical strength and social or political influence, it unmistakably possessed a more enduring vitality than other strata. See my article in PCB, 705-11. 15 For a convenient statement, see C. H. Dodd, with P. I. Bratsiotis, R. Bultmann, H. Clavier, Man in God's Design according to the New Testament (Newcastle-upon-Tyne: Studiorum Novi Testamenti Societas, 1952). But it should be noted that Philo was capable of calling Moses "God" 532</page><page sequence="5">DAVIES: REFLECTIONS ON SABBATAI SVI of Sabbatai Svi is instructive. Divided and uncertain of himself as he was, at certain points he claimed to be divine and he did not offer explanations for his claim. The evidence for all this is ambiguous, but it is not to be ignored. He was regularly called by the term "Our Lord."16 It can be objected that Sabbatai's mind was diseased and that it is illegitimate to deduce anything about Judaism from his case. Scholem has shown that he was a pathological figure, suffering from a manic-depressive condition.17 But this makes it all the more striking that his followers, including rabbis despite the criticisms of some rabbinic leaders, do not seem to have objected to his claim to divinity nor found it, in itself, impossible. Moreover, the role ascribed to Sabbatai Svi by Nathan of Gaza was such as to demand that he possess divine power because, through his activity and the faith in himself which he engendered among his followers, the whole cosmos was to be redeemed, to achieve restoration. In previous studies, Scholem had indicated that in the Merkabah mysticism of an earlier period in Jewish history18 the unbridgeable gulf between man and God remained. But in Sabbatianism this gulf seems to have been crossed. Within a messianic context a new dimension of union between God and man had opened. But before Sabbatai Svi appeared, Judaism had known the long development of a mysticism in the medieval period in which the relationship between man and God had been constantly pondered under other than simply scriptural influences. This long development makes any direct comparison with Judaism in the period before the appearance of Jesus very precarious.'9 (theos); see De vita Mosis 1.28 ?155-58; De sac. Abel. et Caini 2 ?8-10. See also W. A. Meeks, "Moses as God and King," in Religions in Antiquity (Leiden: Brill, 1968) 355. 16 Sabbatai Svi, 835-36, 871. Scholem writes of a tendency that Sabbatai Svi had of "toying - though never explicitly - with the idea of his divinity." At one point he signed his name Turco, which, among other things, could mean "the mountain of God." Scholem asks, "Did he mean to imply that the Deity was resting upon Mount Sinai?" (ibid., 835). A liturgical practice developed among believers of saying: "Every morning and every evening we say: he and no other is our God" (Sabbatai Svi, 835). At one stage in his life Sabbatai Svi wore symbolic rings. One of his rings was engraved with the name Shadday (Ibid., 234); he discovered that the numerical value of the two Hebrew words for "God moved" ('eWlhim merahepet) [sic!] in Gen 1:2 was equal to that of his name, and that beresit, "in the beginning" (Gen 1:1) contained the letters of his own name "Sabbatai." Scholem compares the utterances ascribed to Jesus in the gospels as pointing to a peculiar intimacy with God (p. 235). The "divinity" of Sabbatai Svi became a subject of acute debate. The name by which Sabbatai Svi was known to his followers was Amirah, which is made up of the initials of the Hebrew words for "Our Lord and King, his majesty be exalted" (ibid., 263, 314, 329). 17 See esp. Sabbatai Svi, 125-38. In Jerusalem opposition to Sabbatai Svi reached the highest point, however, when he claimed "I am the Lord your God, Sabbatai Svi" (ibid., 361, 389; on p. 607 there is a reference to a rabbi ascribing divinity to Sabbatai Svi). 18 'The fact is that the true and spontaneous feeling of the Merkabah mystic knows nothing of the divine immanence; the infinite gulf between the soul and God the King on His throne is not even bridged at the climax of mystical ecstasy" (Sabbatai Svi, 55). Note that in emphasizing the role of the messiah as the agent of the tiqqzin, Nathan was departing from Lurianic qabbalists, for whom obedience to the Law was the instrument of the tiqqtun. 19 See Major Trends, 80-286. Professor Kalman Bland emphasized this (orally, to me): it is, indeed, a major consideration. On the other hand, medieval Jewish mysticism was accompanied 533</page><page sequence="6">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE But we can at least say this. Schweitzer drew a sharp distinction between the mysticism of Paul, that of being "in Christ," and the mysticism of the Fourth Gospel, that of being "in God."20 The former he considered Jewish and messianic, the latter Hellenistic. In the light of the history of Sabbatai Svi, such a distinction need not point outside Judaism. Sabbatai Svi's claims to divinity did not signify or imply any departure from it, nor involve the emergence of a new religion.21 Given belief in the advent of the Messiah, the possibility for transcending the customary categories of Judaism as they had traditionally been understood, was immensely enhanced. III. New Light on Messianism The reference to the Messiah brings us to the second sphere where Scholem's work is illuminating, our understanding of messianism.22 In a remarkable way Sabbatianism shows that messianic movements are always likely to have presented certain constants. The same characteristics recur in such movements, although separated widely in space and time. Certain phenomena re-emerge in Sabbatianism which had characterized early Christianity. They are so many that it is tempting to find in Sabbatianism simply a late, distorted replica of Christianity (a temptation that, as we saw, Scholem has taught us to resist). It is impossible to enumerate completely the phenomena to which we refer. We shall divide them into two groups: first, what we shall call, without prejudice,23 secondary characteristics; and secondly, primary or essential phenomena. The former are very many; the latter can be reduced to two. As for the secondary phenomena, they may be divided as follows. First, certain strictly religious emphases are common: for example, repentance, prayer, fasting, enthusiasm. Although Paul (in this, he was very unlike Nathan by a continuing tradition of apocalyptic, going back before the first century. G. W. Buchanan, in an unpublished work, has gathered rich evidence for this. This continuity makes the assessment of first century apocalyptic in the light of that of the seventeenth more realistic than might at first appear. 20 The propriety and precise meaning of the term "mysticism" as used by Schweitzer we need not here discuss. See the criticism of it, going back to the work of Nathan Soderblom, in Gustaf Aulen, Dag Hammarskj6ld's White Book: The Meaning of Markings (Philadelphia: Fortress, 1969) 38. 21 Scholem notes this of Sabbatianism. It was also true probably of early Christianity, at least up to 70 C.E. See P. Richardson, Israel in the Apostolic Church (SNTS 10; London/New York: Cambridge University, 1969). 22 Scholem's work The Messianic Idea in Judaism is the most important study of messianism known to me. It should be compared and contrasted with that of Joseph Klausner, The Messianic Idea in Israelfrom Its Beginnings to the Completion of the Mishnah (New York: Macmillan, 1955). The former raises our understanding of its theme to a new dimension and compels a reassessment of early Christianity as a messianic movement. This article opens up simply the thin edge of a wedge. 23 It is necessary to insert "without prejudice" because included among them are parallels in the crucial "moments" in early Christianity, e.g., the resurrection and the parousia. The term "secondary" is applied to such moments here within the context of Scholem's study. 534</page><page sequence="7">DAVIES: REFLECTIONS ON SABBATAI SVI of Gaza) apparently never emphasized repentance directly,24 early Christianity was preceded by or accompanied by a movement of repentance which Jesus himself joined. The same phenomenon in an even more marked form emerged at the birth of Sabbatianism. Sabbatai Svi himself, but in particular his prophet, Nathan of Gaza, inaugurated a vast movement of repentance and mortification of the flesh, a mortification which Paul at times might have exemplified (1 Cor 9:27). The sources for Sabbatianism reveal the extremes to which such pre-messianic repentance was liable: some followers of Sabbatai Svi died from fasting.25 Doubtless, had we more sources, early Christianity would reveal the same. Similarly in the strictly religious dimension, the habits of prayer of Sabbatai Svi recall the immediacy of the prayer of the Jesus of the Synoptics. The religious intensity of Sabbatai Svi, his experience of mystical absorption and ecstasy, and the almost bizarre unrealism of some of the Sabbatian believers recall the kind of enthusiasm which one detects both in and behind the Synoptics.26 Kasemann's brilliant detection of an early Christian enthusiasm has probably simply raised the lid of a cauldron.27 The enthusiasm, for example, which led to the so-called communism of Acts finds its parallel at the advent of Sabbatai Svi in the sale of their property by countless rich Jews in many quarters.28 24 See John Knox, The Ethics of Jesus in the Teaching of the Church (New York: Abingdon, 1961) 86; H. J. Schoeps, Paul (Philadelphia: Westminster, 1961). 188. But contrast C. F. D. Moule, "On Obligation in the Ethic of Paul," Christian History and Interpretation: Studies Presented to John Knox (eds. W. R. Farmer, C. F. D. Moule, R. R. Niebuhr; London/New York: Cambridge University, 1967) 398. 25 Sabbatai Svi, 260, 291, and esp. p. 472. Nathan emphasized repentance paradoxically as he did the nearness of the end which would change all things. Joy and penitence co-existed (p. 262). On fasts and enthusiasm, see also pp. 328, 356. For examples of the extremism, see pp. 358, 364, 434. Nathan and one hundred Jews immersed themselves naked in snow at Hebron. 26 Ibid., 112-13, 123, 146, 185. Particularly striking are the references to the face of Sabbatai Svi as "shining" (132, 142, 188-90). These naturally recall the accounts of the transfiguration of Jesus, but that moment must not be too easily interpreted in their light. The prayer life of Sabbatai Svi recalls Matthew 6, (ibid., 118, 185. On this see the extremely important work of H. D. Betz, "Eine judenchristliche Kult-Didache in Matt 6, 1-18," Jesus Christus in Historie und Theologie: Festschrift fur Hans Conzelmann [ed. G. Strecker; Tiibingen: Mohr (Siebeck), 1975] 445-57); his struggle with demons recalls those of Jesus in the Synoptics (see Sabbatai Svi, 174-75). 27 See n. 2 above, and also "Sentences of Holy Law in the New Testament," New Testament Questions Today, 66-81. Even if Kasemann's reconstruction of the oldest interpretation of the gospel in terms of apocalyptic does not always convince from lack of evidence (for example, it has been pointed out that the Son of Man and the parousia are absent in our earliest kerygmatic formula 1 Cor 15:3-5), that the earliest Christians were "enthusiasts" need not be questioned. It is impossible to ignore this. See, for example, Sabbatai Svi, 257, for a description of enthusiasm at Aleppo. In Gaza, Hebron, and Safed, very early after Nathan began his preaching, "the people slept in the streets and bazaars because the houses and courtyards could not contain" the multitudes. "No business is transacted and all - boys and old men, young men and virgins, pregnant women and such as have just given birth - are fasting from Sunday to Friday without suffering any harm" (Sabbatai Svi, 261 and n. 176). See further pp. 367, 423-25, 634, 652. The penitence called for by Nathan brought normal business to an end. Compare 1 and 2 Thessalonians. For mass hysteria and ecstasy and prophecy, see pp. 417-24, 435-40. 28 The desire to return to Palestine was widespread. Routes to be followed were discussed. There was sale of landed property (ibid., 287, 358, 637, 647, 474, but also 477 n. 20, 652-53). By 535</page><page sequence="8">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE Secondly, the miraculous is as marked in Sabbatianism as in early Christianity. For example, the manner of the birth of Sabbatai Svi was dwelt upon in a way reminiscent of the birth narratives in Matthew and Luke; and Sabbatai Svi urged a cult of his mother, comparable with later Christian mariolatry.29 There was a tradition that between 1648 and 1650 Sabbatai Svi was miraculously saved from drowning: "He rose from the sea and was saved," as was Jesus when he walked on the sea.30 Magical elements which have been discovered in the Synoptic tradition have their parallels, in a very enhanced form, in Sabbatianism. Sabbatai Svi seems at times to have inaugurated a magical enterprise. There were attempts to force the end by what has been called a "practical Qabbala," which amounted to magic.31 That Jesus' work could be and has been regarded in a similar magical fashion the studies of A. Schweitzer himself show; in the end the Jesus of Schweitzer is an apocalyptical magician who seeks to "force" the end.32 Thirdly, the nature and activity of Sabbatai Svi and Jesus as messiahs are often similar: for example, that the Messiah could be in the world unknown reappears in Sabbatianism;33 and also he is parallel with Moses and Adam;34 his coming inaugurates or is accompanied by the "birth pangs of the Messiah."35 Like Jesus, Sabbatai Svi chose twelve to represent the Twelve Tribes of Israel.36 Like Jesus also, Sabbatai Svi was a messiah without armies.37 In a strange way, but with a great difference in the nature of their pains, both Jesus and Sabbatai were suffering messiahs. 1669, according to some, not a single Jew would remain behind "on the impure soil outside Palestine" (p. 652). Nathan of Gaza at one period wanted the Chief Rabbi of Jerusalem to stop the sending of funds to the city, on the grounds that soon, in the messianic time, there would be enough money there (see pp. 364, 435-47). 29 Ibid., 109-10. "The merit of visiting her grave," he wrote to the Jews of Smyrna, "and of placing one's hand on it was equal to a pilgrimage to the Temple of Jerusalem." He initiated the worship of his mother (pp. 613-14). 30 Ibid., 145-46; he stilled the sea (p. 446 n. 209). 31 Ibid., 149, 171, 191, 198; Sabbatai Svi had studied "practical Qabbala" (that is, the process of using holy names and Qabbalistic magical formulas to force the end), and he had learned the magical use of divine names (ibid., 75). For Nathan and practical Qabbala, see ibid., 209-13. 32 See also Morton Smith, The Secret Gospel: The Discovery and Interpretation of the Secret Gospel according to Mark (New York: Harper and Row, 1973); and M. Smith, Clement of Alexandria and a Secret Gospel of Mark (Cambridge: Harvard University, 1973). On magic in Judaism, E. E. Urbach, The Sages: Their Concepts and Beliefs (Jerusalem: Magnes, 1975), beginning p. 97. He recognizes the belief in miracles as a necessary aspect of Judaism as of all religions (p. 102) and that "without doubt miracles played a great role in the propagation of Christianity in the ancient world" (p. 115). The Sages no less than the masses believed in miracles. The New Testament reveals how easily the magical can be appropriated by and absorbed into the eschatological. 33 See Sabbatai Svi, 199-207, on the way in which Nathan of Gaza found the Messiah in Sabbatai Svi (also 251-52). The fact that there was no well-defined dominant "image" of the Messiah had its nemesis. There could be many claimants. 34 Ibid., 304, 306, etc. 35 The suffering of Sabbatai Svi was explained in these terms. 36 Ibid., 222. 37 Ibid., 287. 536</page><page sequence="9">DAVIES: REFLECTIONS ON SABBATAI SVI Fourthly, among these secondary phenomena, if such a term be permitted in this connection, both Sabbatai Svi and Jesus were conceived to have overcome death, the former by occultation and the latter by resurrection. And both were expected to return again to earth to complete their work.38 Fifthly, we note the striking phenomenon that the roles of John the Baptist and Paul in early Christianity and that of Nathan of Gaza in Sabbatianism are parallel.39 Mutatis mutandis, Nathan of Gaza in himself was to Sabbatai Svi what both John the Baptist and Paul were to Jesus. Until Nathan convinced him, Sabbatai Svi was uncertain of his messianic identity. Though more directly so (the Synoptic and Johannine materials are here so varied), Nathan was a witness to Sabbatai in a way parallel with that of John the Baptist to Jesus. But it was Nathan also who later provided the theological structure for the interpretation of Sabbatai Svi and in this played the role of Paul to Jesus. Like Paul, Nathan refused to be impressed by or to demand "signs" that the Messiah had come.40 But this single parallel of Nathan with the Baptist and Paul must not be pressed. It is altogether natural that the founder of any movement should have significant interpreters. Finally, much as many scholars urge that there was little interest in the life of Jesus even on the part of Paul, Sabbatianism flourished apparently without much active interest among the masses of believers in the history and character of Sabbatai.41 What mattered was that the Messiah had appeared, not who had appeared as Messiah. The strange behavior of Sabbatai Svi, a manic-depressive, caused consternation among the rabbis, and others, who believed in him, as among those who did not. He changed the calendar,42 ignored the food laws,43 pronounced the ineffable Name,44 and was sexually irregular.45 His conduct was often, to use Scholem's vivid phrase, "an Exodus 38 On the occultation of the Messiah, see ibid., 314. 39 Ibid., 204, 207. 40 Ibid., 221, 267. This was connected with the emphasis on faith as the peculiar merit of the believer (p. 222). But such an attitude was inevitably challenged. Later in the movement the absence of the signs traditionally associated with the messianic age was emphasized by some rabbis. 41 For example, ibid., 251,290. The evaluation of Sabbatai Svi by the rabbis depended on their valuation, not of him, but of Nathan, the Prophet (pp. 245-46). The absence of Sabbatai Svi from Jerusalem helped the movement which was, in a sense, not related to him (pp. 252-53). Cf. p. 162, et passim. 42 He abolished the Feast of Tammuz in 1665; there are numerous examples of his tampering with the calendar (ibid., 237). He visited the Temple as a symbol of its rebuilding; he wanted to ride through Jerusalem on a horse (pp. 241-42). He changed the prayers (p. 277). 43 He allowed the eating of kidney fat (ibid., 242); he urged others to break the Law (p. 243). In the earliest stages of his messiahship all this was not accompanied by moral debauchery (pp. 245- 46). This was to come later. 44 Ibid., 160-61. 45 The attitude of Sabbatai Svi towards women was extremely complex (p. 403). That he married a prostitute has been taken to indicate his desire to liberate women, to free them from the curse of Eve. The subject cannot be dealt with here. That the liberation of women played a real part in Sabbatianism is clear. Sabbatai Svi distributed kingdoms to women (as to priests and Levites), ibid., 397. 537</page><page sequence="10">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE from the Law."46 The justification of Sabbatai's behavior, his attitude to and disobedience of the Law, culminating in his monstrous apostasy to Islam, posed a problem for his followers, comparable with that facing early Christians by the free attitude of Jesus to the Law and by his suffering and death. The theology of both movements began with an initial disappointment which had to be explained. Both turned to the same exegetical methods to do so, and both concentrated on the Suffering Servant of Isaiah 53 for illumination. Both developed a doctrine of the parousia; both demanded faith, unattested by works or signs. Perhaps, in early Christianity a new element had entered Judaism, that is, faith in a pure or neat form, not necessarily associated with good works, became the mark of redemption, and that a faith in a paradoxical messiah. Such a faith re-emerged in Sabbatianism.47 Both movements produced a doctrine of Incarnation. In both a deeply felt faith, an immediate experience of being in a new eon, a "realized eschatology" of incalculable emotional intensity, enthusiasm and exultation led to a radical criticism of Jewish tradition, a new standard of measurement being applied to it. The experience of the freedom of the children of God led to antinomian tendencies, especially and unrestrainedly in Sabbatianism, but also in early Christianity, which at times broke out into license.48 Taken together, the phenomena to which we have pointed - and many more such could be noted - are extremely valuable. To read the history of Sabbatai is to encounter the emotional intensity of a messianic movement at first hand, a temper or an atmosphere strikingly like the very enthusiastic, ecstatic world of feeling which was the "new creation" of early Christianity. This is not all. The history of Sabbatai suggests that a messianic movement of any depth is most likely, almost inevitably, to call forth certain phenomena - ecstasy, mortifications, visions, miracles, enthusiasms and certain inescapable parallel responses. The reason for this is simple. The messianic tradition had developed into a popular tradition, so that the advent of a messiah at any time stirred up among the masses certain age-long, stereotyped expectations. Discouraged as they might be to do so even by the messiah himself, the believing masses found "signs" everywhere. Moved by the age-old concepts and symbols of messianism rooted in the Scriptures and enlarged upon in tradition, they were eager to clothe their messiah, in every age, with the kind of characteristics they thought proper to him.49 Probably in every messianic movement, certainly in Sabbatianism and early Christianity, a distinction should be clearly recognized between the understanding of it among the masses and among the more sophisticated 46 After 1655 Sabbatai Svi regarded himself as no longer under the authority of the Law that he had studied in his youth, nor under rabbinic authority; he was subject to a higher law, ibid., 163-66. 47 See especially the very important pages 282-84. 48 It is impossible to document these sentences adequately. All points indicated are dealt with by Scholem himself in an extremely illuminating manner (particularly on pp. 795-800). 4' Thus Nathan of Gaza had to counteract the popular expectations of the masses (ibid., 287- 88). 538</page><page sequence="11">DAVIES: REFLECTIONS ON SABBATAI SVI leaders. Attempts to explain Sabbatianism and early Christianity in predominantly political or economic or sociological terms have generally failed to convince. Believers in Sabbatai Svi were drawn from the rich and the poor, the underprivileged and the established, from the ignorant cam ha'ares and the rabbinic authorities.50 Similarly, early Christianity was probably indifferent to barriers of wealth, class, and learning, although the evidence is not as clear as in Sabbatianism.51 Nevertheless there were real differences of comprehension among the believers in both movements. Nathan of Gaza and Paul of Tarsus understood the respective messiahs in whom they believed in a far more theologically informed manner than most of their fellow-believers.52 One is tempted to find here a suggestive datum for the interpretation of the symbols of apocalyptic in both movements. Recently we have been urged to distinguish between "steno symbols" and "tensive symbols." This distinction should probably be related to differences between the masses and the more subtle believers in early Christianity as in Sabbatianism. Because in both movements most believers belonged to the masses, they both tended to take on, especially incipiently, the marks of the popular understanding of the messianic age to which we have drawn attention. But it would be very unwise 50 Scholem discusses the economic, social, and political causes proposed for the emergence and development of Sabbatianism, starting on the first page. The evidence that not only the depressed but the wealthy and the established rabbinic leaders accepted the messiahship of Sabbatai Svi and were involved in his movement is abundant (e.g., p. 392). The participation of many rabbis and wealthy men was too marked to be simply another example of the familiar phenomenon that sect leaders tend to come from a higher class than those whom they lead. The best brief treatment known to me of early Christianity as a "sect," exhibiting typical sectarian characteristics is the very illuminating study by R. Scroggs, "The Earliest Christian Communities as a Sectarian Movement," Christianity, Judaism and Other Greco-Roman Cults: Studiesfor Morton Smith at Sixty (SJLA 12; Leiden: Brill, 1975), 2. 1-23. Scroggs cites Werner Stark (The Sociology of Religion, II: Sectarian Religion [London: Routledge and Keegan Paul, 1967] 46) on the generally superior social status of the leadership of sects. There is much in Sabbatianism both to support Scrogg's thesis and to modify it. 51 See, e.g., H. von Campenhausen, "The Christian and the Social Life according to the New Testament," Tradition and Life in the Early Church (Philadelphia: Fortress, 1968) 141-59. The appeal of early Christianity and Sabbatianism to the underprivileged, however, while not the explanation of their growth, was real. For example, a certain wealthy Raphael Joseph in Egypt served as a Maecenas to believers there. "He would provide food to all the people in Gaza that were with Nathan, and everyone that came from afar would leave his moneybag with him and then proceed to Gaza," Sabbatai Svi, 269. There is some indication that the rabbis feared to oppose Sabbatai Svi because of the masses (pp. 361-63). A bodyguard of the poor followed Sabbatai Svi (pp. 391-92). At Smyrna Sabbatai Svi gave alms very liberally to the poor (p. 384). At that city when public homage was rendered to him as king, he was offered money to be used for charitable purposes and to buy the freedom of Jewish prisoners who had been sentenced to the galleys (p. 412). 52 David Daube drew a distinction between the popular teaching of Jesus and that to his inner following, "Public Report and Private Explanation," The New Testament and Rabbinic Judaism (London: Athlone Press, 1956) 14. Morton Smith has introduced the distinction in the teaching of Jesus himself between that for ordinary Jews and that for the masses and, in addition, between that for both of these groups and that for his intimate initiates; see "The Reason for the Persecution of Paul and the Obscurity of Acts," Studies in Misticism and Religion Presented to G. G. Scholem (Jerusalem: Magnes, 1968) 261-68. 539</page><page sequence="12">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE to find the essence of any messianic movement in the kind of phenomena which such an understanding magnified. Bizarre miracles, the froth of enthusiasm and ecstasy must not be given equal weight with, or (perhaps better) must not be understood apart from the underlying formative factors in a messianic movement,53 to which we now turn. More important than the secondary phenomena, then, are certain fundamental similarities, accompanied by equally fundamental differences, between early Christianity and Sabbatianism. These we have called primary phenomena. They may be introduced under two rubrics. First, in both movements there was a radical confrontation with the established order, focused on the ultimate authority within Judaism, the Torah. In both, social, political, and religious loyalties and oppressions were challenged, so that there emerged an inevitable concentration on the person of the messiah in whose name the challenge was issued. In both, faith in the messiah became the primary mark of the believer.54 Secondly, both movements within a very short period spread extensively. Sabbatianism and early Christianity are in one thing peculiar. Most of the many messianic movements in Judaism have been short-lived and concentrated in specific localities. But Sabbatianism and Christianity are alike in having had an ecumenical appeal.55 Within two years, Sabbatianism spread throughout Europe and the Near East. Confined almost exclusively to Jews, it affected almost the whole of Jewry. Within a slightly longer period, Christianity spread from Palestine to Rome in the West and eastwards as well, to some extent among Jews but also, and particularly, among Gentiles. This means that both Sabbatianism and Christianity were understood to satisfy the spiritual needs of Jews and especially, in the case of the latter, of Gentiles. Movements do not spread without reason: emotionally at the least both early Christianity and Sabbatianism conveyed the living experience of redemption.56 53 There was much mass hysteria and ecstasy and megalomania in Sabbatianism; see, e.g., Sabbatai Svi, 417-19, 435, 468-70. 54 Ibid., 210-12, 282-84, 390. This explains a problem dealt with by N. Dahl ('The Neglected Factor in New Testament Theology," Reflection [Yale Divinity School] 73 [1975]), i.e., the relative paucity of materials dealing directly with the doctrine of God in the NT. 55 Sabbatai Svi, 2. This distinguishes early Christianity and Sabbatianism from other messianic movements, e.g., in modern Africa and Asia. These often reveal the twofold structure proposed by Scholem, but are localized. See Bryan Wilson, The Noble Savages: The Primitive Origins of Charisma and Its Contemporary Survival (Berkeley: University of California, 1975) 37-92. 56 Scholem emphasizes particularly the very wide extension of Sabbatianism, as of Christianity, in space and time, as calling for an explanation other than that required for more localized and evanescent movements (Sabbatai Svi, 2). In Sabbatianism what provided ecumenicity (a word which we use in its strict sense) was Lurianic Qabbala which (despite the counter influence of the Great Eagle, Maimonides) had developed within it. "Wherever Lurianism came, it produced messianic tension" (ibid., 67). "Lurianic teaching functioned as a means to draw down the Messiah" (ibid., 70). To this Nathan of Gaza could appeal in interpreting Sabbatai Svi. 540</page><page sequence="13">DAVIES: REFLECTIONS ON SABBATAI SVI At first sight, these two rubrics seem to justify Scholem's claim that messianism is essentially constituted by two fundamental elements. First, there is the emergence of a messianic figure. He serves as a catalyst, negatively, for radical criticism of the existing order; positively, of dreams at long last come true, of barriers long-standing being broken down, of a new creation- all this accompanied by an impulse to propagate the good news. And then, secondly, this messianic figure must meet a widespread need and be understood to satisfy that need in terms of an interpretative ideological structure of magnitude and depth. Infinitely complex as are all historical movements, Scholem claims that significant messianic movements are usually born of a coincidence - that of the interpretation of this person within a large conceptual framework which can illumine his significance for that need. To put the matter concretely, a significant messianic movement demands the coincidence of a Jesus and a Paul or of a Sabbatai Svi and a Nathan of Gaza. The catalyst of a messianic movement is a messianic figure, but its spread and significance are necessarily determined by the scope and profundity of the conceptual framework or myth within which such a figure can be or is interpreted. This dual aspect of messianic movements is especially clear in Sabbatianism. Owing to the absence of contemporary sources of sufficient richness, it is not so immediately clear in early Christianity. Does Scholem's analysis help in the clarification of early Christian history? Scholem points out that among Jews in the seventeenth century, when Sabbatianism arose, there was one single, dominant theology, Lurianic Qabbala, which constituted a rich, comprehensive myth.57 It varied in its forms but was profoundly united in essentials and was almost universally accepted by Jews. It was the universal dominance of a single theology or myth that enabled Sabbatai Svi, through Nathan of Gaza, to initiate such a widespread messianic movement. The reason for the hold of Lurianic Qabbala on Jews everywhere was that it provided a key to the mystery of their suffering at the hands of the Gentile world and made that suffering tolerable. In medieval Europe, the one inescapable fact about Jews was that they were in exile, at the mercy of the whims of their Gentile rulers. In 1492 they had been expelled cruelly from Spain; in 1648-49 there were horrendous massacres in Poland. How could Jews continue to bear the burden of their exile? Lurianic Qabbala provided the answer in subtle, mystical terms which satisfied. At first the doctrine, absorbed in strictly theological concerns, had not been particularly concerned with the question of exile as such. But it had developed in such a way as to provide a sustaining explanation for the terrible experiences of Jews in exile: it spoke directly to their needs.58 It did so by 57 The first chapter of Sabbatai Svi is especially illuminating for all this. Sabbatai 58 Sabbatai Svi, 15-22, esp. p. 20. On p. 42 Scholem writes: "The exile of the 'lower' terrestrial Congregation of Israel in the world of history is thus merely a reflection of the exile of the supernal Israel, that is, the Shekhinah. Israel's state is symbolic of the state of creation as a whole. It is the Jew who holds in his hands the key to the tiqqun of the world, consisting of the progressive 541</page><page sequence="14">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE setting their exile in a cosmic, divine perspective: it connected the historical exile of Jews with a supramundane exile of man from God, and indeed, with a rupture in the very being of God himself. By enduring their exile, while remaining loyal to the disciplined, austere, ascetic tradition of the Torah, and the knowledge of it supplied by the Qabbala of Luria, suffering, exiled Jews were assured that they were making possible a cosmic reintegration and with this the restoration of man to God and a reconciliation within God himself. The technical term for this process of restoration was tiqqun. Lurianic Qabbala was not simply a mystical and intellectual structure of vast complexity and insight; it became the strength and stay of a despairing people, crushed in the ghetto. In their insignificance, it gave to Jews cosmic significance. It enabled them to believe not only that even this world, in which they knew exile, could be saved or undergo tiqqun, but that through their obedience to the Torah it was they who were to be its saviors. When that obedience would have reached its fulfillment, the Messiah would appear. It was not the Messiah who would make the restoration possible; rather he would be a sign that it was near. He would usher in the end, made possible by the Jews' own obedience. Within this context the impact of Sabbatai becomes understandable: without it, his name would probably by now be forgotten like that of many another messiah in Jewish history. As we already noted, his claim to be the Messiah was at first ridiculed. But when a recognized prophet interpreted that claim in the light of the all-pervasive Lurianic Qabbalistic expectations, a new movement was born: the interpretation was as crucial as the claimant, the myth as the fact. Jews became convinced that the ultimate tiqqtun or restoration had now begun. The end was at hand; deliverance was at the door. The results of this conviction were staggering. The one decisive factor was that the Messiah had appeared. Who he was, or what he was like, was for many unimportant. Interest in the personal character and conduct of Sabbatai was at best secondary and probably, among the majority of believers, non- existent.59 What made him significant was his role as the Messiah, proclaimed separation of good from evil by the performance of the commandments of the Torah. Tiqqun is thus an essentially spiritual activity directed at the inner side of the cosmos. But once it will have achieved its end, then this hidden, spiritual perfection will also become manifest outwardly, since outward reality is always symbolic of inner reality. In exile, spiritual activity and mystical concentration (kawwanah) affect the inner strata of the cosmos only, 'but the [outer] worlds in general are not elevated until the advent of the messiah, when they will all rise by themselves. At present the only exaltation of the worlds is in their inner aspect .... In the present period of exile we can raise - even on the Sabbath -the inner side of the worlds only, but not their outside. For if the outer reality were elevated too, then we could behold with our eyes the exaltation of all the worlds on the Sabbath" (Hayyim Vital, "Sha'ar ha-Tefillah," chap. 6 Peri Es IHayyim: Dubrovna, 1804, fol. 7c). Once the last trace of holiness is extracted from the qelippah so that no divine sparks are left in it, the world of tiqqun will become manifest. This is the meaning of redemption." 59 See, e.g., p. 118 (". . clearly the course of the movement was determined by the public climate more than by the personality or the inner life of the young kabbalist . . ."), 207-8, 252, 289-90 and n. 41.

In the Lurianic world, among Jewish hearts made sick by hope deferred, the magic word, Messiah, was enough to set the world on fire. That among certain at least of the Sabbatians the neglect of a radical assessment of the character of Sabbatai Svi was to bring its terrible nemesis will become clear as we turn now to our main concern: the light that Sabbatianism throws on early Christianity. IV. Early Christianity and Sabbatianism Before we deal with the most significant questions that Scholem's works have provoked, it is desirable first to recognize their contribution to our understanding of the apocalyptic terminology of the NT. I am acutely conscious of my incompetence in dealing with this. I am versed neither in linguistic analysis nor in literary criticism as it is currently practised. I can simply point to certain facts. Sabbatianism used the terminology of apocalyptic as symbolic of a supernatural, unseen reality; this it did as heir to the Qabbala.60 But equally certainly it took that terminology quite literally. tension what is most surprising "is the feebleness of its image of the Messiah." In the process of tiqqtun "the Messiah himself plays a pale and insignificant role. Except for the highly developed and firmly established tradition of the Messiah, perhaps the Qabbalists would have dispensed with him altogether .... By transferring to Israel, the historic nation, much of the task formerly considered as the Messiah's, many of his distinctive personal traits, as drawn in Apocalyptic literature, were now obliterated" (ibid., 52). 60 Scholem writes as follows: "The character of Lurianic symbolism presents a special problem. The accusation of anthropomorphism directed against the kabbalists is an old one. Their manner of speaking in a material fashion about things spiritual was often held to fall little short of actual blasphemy, yet it merely exemplified the essential paradox of all symbolism. Symbols express in human speech that which is properly inexpressible. Hence they are always material and anthropomorphic, even though the mystic may regard them as mere crutches to aid his frail human understanding. The kabbalists, whose mystical thinking strained after expression in symbolic forms, endeavored to evade responsibility for their symbols by the frequent use of qualifying phrases such as "so to speak," "as if," "as it were," and the like. These reservations were supposed to minimize the real significance of the symbols employed. The kabbalists used the most outrageous material and even physical and sexual imagery but immediately qualified their statements by adding the solemn warning, "Cursed be the man that makes any graven or molten image," that is, who attributes reality to symbolic expressions. From their higher theological vantage point the kabbalists might argue that the material interpretation of their symbols was a misunderstanding, yet it was precisely this creative misunderstanding that determined the public significance of kabbalistic symbolism. He was a bold man indeed who undertook to draw the line between understanding and misunderstanding in such matters. The inescapable dialectic of symbolism is central to a proper appreciation of the historical and social function of kabbalism, even as it underlies most of the discussions between kabbalists and their opponents. Lurianism is mythological in the precise meaning of the term. It tells the story of divine acts and events, and it accounts for the mystery of the world by an inner, mystical process which, taking place within the Godhead, ultimately produced also the "outer," material creation. According to the kabbalists everything external is merely a symbol or intimation of an inner reality that actually determines the external reality which we perceive. The main concepts of Lurianism all refer to the mystery of the Godhead, but on each and every level they also point to a corresponding aspect in the manifest cosmos" (Sabbatai Svi, 26-27 [my italics]). One of our most urgent needs is to re-examine apocalyptic symbolism. Amos Wilder, in his poetry and elsewhere, has pioneered the way. 543</page><page sequence="16">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE For example, when Sabbatai's messiahship was accepted at Smyrna, he proceeded forthwith geographically to carve up the world, which he was soon to rule. He ascribed to several of his followers different parts of the world as their dominions. Some of his wealthy followers sold their possessions convinced that the end of the old order was literally at hand.61 The Turkish authorities took very seriously the political implications of Sabbatai's activity.62 On his side, he behaved like a monarch.63 Much modern discussion of the meaning of apocalyptic language which overmuch spiritualizes it must be regarded as misguided. For example, to understand the term "kingdom of God," as used in early Christianity, as non-political and non-terrestrial is unjustifiable, if it be taken to have been so used universally.64 Whatever their limitations, in their tenacious insistence on a literal understanding of the messianic prophecies chiliastic movements are doubtless true to much in Sabbatianism and in early Christianity.65 There was a literal dimension to apocalyptic language which must not be evaded, and it had a catastrophic political and social relevance. In particular, the political and sociological implications of early Christianity and their actual impact would be more adequately recognized if this literalism were taken more seriously. This would help us to comprehend that all messianism has a revolutionary, subversive potential.66 This is not to underrate the symbolism of apocalyptic. A literary critic might do justice to our point by claiming that apocalyptic terminology is both conceptual and symbolic. This applies especially to the understanding of early Christianity among the masses, which embraced apocalyptic literally and uncritically. To bear this in mind is to see both Jesus and Paul as corrective of a popular messianic political revolutionary enthusiasm and, therefore, despite the new wine which 61 Ibid., 397-403, 426-32, 468. Believers were given royal titles; the names of their future dominions were assigned. The brothers of Sabbatai Svi were to constitute a kind of caliphate (p. 430). Sabbatai believed that a supernatural act was to bring all this about. How unimportant financial matters became appears from Nathan's opposition to the sending of money to Jerusalem, his attack on money changers and on alms from abroad (pp. 365-67). Charitable funds had to be set up (pp. 497-99). The opposition of some wealthy Jews to the movement was probably spurred by its antifinancial and anticommercial aspects. Calculations of profit and loss, when it came to the demand to sell all to go to Palestine, would, of course, often reinforce their orthodoxy and rational inhibitions. Connected with this literalism is the widespread and recurring contemporary Christian (chiliastic) emphasis outside Sabbatianism and Judaism on the reappearance of the Lost Ten Tribes of Israel (pp. 332-54). And, again, although Nathan did not think of Sabbatai Svi as a warlike messiah, the popular messianism in Sabbatianism counteracted this emphasis (p. 363). 62 See, e.g., ibid., 369, 383, 432, 450, 674-77. 63 Ibid., 384, 386, and esp. pp. 412-17. 64 Especially important in this connection is the much neglected study by B. Reicke, Diakonie, Festfreude und Zelos (Uppsala: Lundequistaka, 1951) 242-47. He refers to "Materialisierung der Eschatologie" (p. 243) and to "anarchische Einstellung" (p. 244) in early Christianity. 65 See Sabbatai Svi, 93-102, esp. p. 98. 66 On the catastrophic aspect of messianism which is related to its utopian dimension, which in turn is related to apocalyptic, see G. G. Scholem, The Messianic Idea in Judaism, 4-12, esp. p. 7. The whole volume is indispensable for a comprehension of the dynamism of messianism. 544</page><page sequence="17">DAVIES: REFLECTIONS ON SABBATAI SVI they dispensed, as, in a certain sense, conservative. In this light they both emerge as reductionists of a fecund apocalyptic enthusiasm that sometimes led to political theatrics and discovered in the new creation a legitimation of license.67 But even more important are the two factors, the coincidence of which, according to Scholem's analysis, is necessary for the emergence of a significant messianic movement. Do they apply to early Christianity? First, can we point with equal clarity, as we did in the case of Sabbatianism in the seventeenth century, to a dominant ideological or theological framework in the first- century Judaism into which Jesus of Nazareth was fitted as Messiah to give birth to early Christianity? Or, to put it in another way, does first-century Judaism present an ideological counterpart, equivalent in depth and extent, to the Lurianic Qabbala in seventeenth-century Judaism which made Sab- batianism possible? The answers given to this question will be familiar. As representative, we refer to those of E. R. Goodenough and W. Bousset. Goodenough was concerned to explain how a Palestinian movement so quickly penetrated and prevailed over the Greco-Roman world. His answer was that by the first century certain Jews in the Hellenistic world had opened their minds to pagan notions and made them "at home" in Judaism. When Hellenistic Jews became Christians, they carried over these notions into their understanding of their new faith. This rapidly enabled the gospel to penetrate the Hellenistic-Roman world. But did such a Hellenistic Judaism as Goodenough describes exist universally among first-century Jews as did Lurianic Qabbala among those of the seventeenth, and was it as theologically dominant and accepted? Goodenough's position has not won the assent of those best qualified to assess Judaism. His treatment of the extent and potency of rabbinic influence as over against the almost autonomous Hellenized Judaism which he delineates remains questionable.68 Bousset, whose work Kyrios Christos often seems to anticipate much in Goodenough, nevertheless points to another alternative. For him nascent Christianity employed ideas anticipated in the apocalyptic tradition in Judaism. For example, a christology of pre-existence lay hidden in the idea of the Son of Man of Jewish apocalyptic.69 In the first century an apocalyptic 67 See my article "Paul and Jewish Christianity in the Light of Cardinal Danielou," RSR 60 (1972) 69-80. E. Kasemann has illumined Paul from a different point of view (New Testament Questions Today, 132). For him "Paul is the classical witness for a struggle against enthusiasm under the banner of primitive Christian apocalyptic . . ." (n. 24). But he also recognizes that it is only "relics of apocalyptic theology which are to be found everywhere in the Pauline epistles" (p. 131). 68 Jewish Symbols in the Graeco-Roman World(13 vols.; New York: Pantheon, 1953-68).

The relevant passages are 545</page><page sequence="18">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE structure was ready into which Jesus, as Messiah, could be fitted, as Sabbatai Svi was fitted into Lurianic Qabbala in the seventeenth. Faith in Jesus had merely to clothe itself with apocalyptic. How others have followed Bousset in this view we need not trace. But here again the difference between the role of apocalyptic in the first-century Judaism and Lurianic Qabbala in that of the seventeenth is unmistakable. The relative importance of apocalyptic in the complex of first-century Judaism is much disputed. The older view that apocalyptic was as peripheral in first-century Judaism as, let us say, the chiliastic sects in modern Christianity is no longer tenable.70 Apocalyptic belonged to the main streams of Judaism; but that Judaism was extremely variegated and certainly not dominated by a single apocalyptic ideology. In isolation, apocalyptic, although it has taken up Alexander the Great's notion of world empire, cannot provide a universal, dominant theological parallel to the Lurianic Qabbala of the seventeenth century. The two clear answers, then, to the question whether there was a dominant theological counterpart to Lurianic Qabbala in first-century Judaism do not satisfy. Does a combination of them do so? This might be suggested by the very nature of Lurianic Qabbala itself. In it two things were fused: an eschatological ideology derived from Jewish apocalyptic, modified and reinterpreted in terms of the notion of the tiqquzn, and a form of gnosticism tracing its lineage apparently back to the early Christian centuries. This fusion enabled Lurianic Qabbala to connect the terrestrial messianic hopes with an inward and supernal order and constituted its extraordinary dynamism. Scholem's work prompts the question whether in the first century too -in an inchoate form at least - a comparable fusion of a modified apocalyptic and proto-gnosticism had occurred to provide the framework for interpreting Jesus. P. D. Hanson71 has recently insisted on the prophetic connections of the origins of apocalyptic. But by the first century, what Hellenistic and other influences, including possibly pre- or proto-gnostic ones, had penetrated it? Unfortunately the NT is so laconic that it allows no certainty as to any one dominant framework, apart from the Scriptures, into which Jesus was fitted. Moreover, whereas Sabbatai Svi had one outstanding, almost unique interpreter in Nathan of Gaza, Jesus had various interpreters at least as different as Matthew, Mark, John, and Paul. And again sources outside the NT are either insufficiently examined or too confusing to allow for certainty. translated in W. G.

S. Russell, among others, had earlier pointed in the same direction. Contrast H. D. Betz in the same volume.

He would be a bold man who would claim this. If a unified ideology was the mark of seventeenth-century Judaism, we have long been taught that diversity was that of the first. But is this the whole truth? In reaction to G. F. Moore, have we overemphasized that diversity and overlooked a possible over- arching unity provided by a rich fusion of Law, apocalyptic, and pre- or proto- gnosticism? This question is made more and more pressing by Scholem's understanding of messianism.73 Perhaps the problem as to what theological framework most governed early Christianity can best be approached obliquely. The social and political structures favoring the spread of Christianity are clear - a ubiquitous synagogue, made accessible by Roman imperial roads and favored by Roman policy, provided a ready-made platform for Christian missionaries. We may ask what particular need had arisen among Jews in the first century. Sabbatianism met the needs of Jews in exile. Was there a dominant need that first-century Judaism had to face? The crucial question which it confronted was that posed by the Gentile world. In the first century, Jews, although occasionally living apart as in Alexandria, were not in a ghetto.74 They were free to respond to the fascination of Gentile life. This constitutes a crucial difference between the larger context of Sabbatianism and early Christianity. At the time of Sabbatianism, Judaism was turned in upon itself, cabined, cribbed, and confined. Sabbatianism arose within a suffering ghetto to meet its peculiar needs. By no means was the Gentile question central to it. By the seventeenth century that question had been closed; Gentiles had rejected Jews. Jews in turn had largely rejected Gentiles and had become introverted; the references to Gentiles in a thousand pages of Scholem's work are few.75 It was otherwise in the first century. Then the question of how to relate to the Gentile world pressed ubiquitously upon Jews. There was a vast missionary movement to the Gentile world.76 Before 70 C.E. there were elements in apocalyptic which directly occupied themselves with the fate of 72 For these distinctions, see R. McL. Wilson, Gnosis and the New Testament (Philadelphia: Fortress, 1968) 1-30, esp. p. 17. 73 See S. Sandmel, The First Christian Century: Certainties and Uncertainties (London/New York: Oxford University, 1969) 63-66. 74 See V. Tcherikover, Hellenistic Civilization and the Jews (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society of America, 1959). 75 In Sabbatai Svi there are references to Gentiles and to the "mission" of exiled Jews in the world, but it is significant that in the most excellent and comprehensive index to the volume there is no separate entry under "Gentiles," nor to the attitude of Sabbatai Svi himself or of the Sabbatian movement to them. 76 See, e.g., J. Jeremias, Jesus' Promise to the Nations (London: SCM, 1958) 11-19. 547</page><page sequence="20">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE Gentiles and that with hope for them.77 The relation of such elements to any pre- or proto-gnosticism we cannot pursue. But these elements did speak with particular force to the need of first-century Jews to come to terms with Gentiles. That they were a marked aspect of first-century Judaism before 70 C.E., after which date apocalyptic became more discredited, seems clear. Based on the Scriptures of Judaism,78 they were also the outcome of three centuries of the exposure of Jews to Hellenism -an exposure that time and again created a crisis: the crisis constituted by the insidious attraction of Gentile life. It could be resolved either by greater and greater intensity to achieve a total obedience as at Qumran, or by reinterpretation and adaptation as in Pharisaism, or by a blind hatred as among Zealots; or, on the other extreme, by acceptance and assimilation and interpenetration. 79 Whatever the solution adopted, first-century Judaism faced at boiling point the fascinating impact of Hellenism. Within that context apocalyptic, in those elements of it to which we refer, provided a hope for the final redemption of Gentiles. Was it apocalyptic, characterized by this universalist hope, that provided the framework for presenting Jesus as the "Savior of the World"? And, although it reflected a challenge produced by the attraction of the outside world, while Lurianic Qabbala was the product of an internal crisis produced by the rejection of Jews by the outside world, can we regard this apocalyptic, modified by Hellenistic influences, as a first-century counterpart to Lurianic Qabbala in the seventeenth? There are two difficulties. First, there is that already mentioned with reference to Bousset's position. How significant in first-century Judaism was the kind of apocalyptic to which we refer, among other matters, concerned 77 The relevant documents are: Tobit (200-170 B.C.E., Palestine); Sibylline Oracles, Book 3 (2d/lst cent. B.C.E., Egypt); 1 Enoch (mostly from 2d/lst cent. B.C.E., Palestine [Milik, for example, takes chaps. 37-71 (The Similitudes) as Christian]); 2 Baruch (end of 1st cent. C.E., Palestine), and the Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs (the stages of composition and the date are much disputed; R. H. Charles, 109-107 B.C.E. with additions in first century B.C.E., and later Christian additions; but J. T. Milik and M. de Jonge argue for a lst-3d cent. C.E. Christian expansion of two earlier Jewish testaments from Palestine). Some of the relevant texts are Tob 13:11; 4:6-7; Pss. Sol. 17:32-38; Sib.

Some of the leading ideas are that some or all of the Gentiles will be saved, and that the Gentiles will glorify Jerusalem. On this see P. Volz, Die Eschatologie der judischen Gemeinde im neutestamentlichen Zeitalter (Tiibingen: Mohr [Siebeck], 1934) 356-59; and D. S.

How pervasive was the hope for the Gentiles within it? That the hope existed is clear, but was it widespread, not to say dominant? The answer is not easy. The wide infiltration of apocalyptic ideology into the Greco-Roman world would seem to be likely. It began, according to M. Hengel, before the third century B.C.80 J. Danielou insisted that up to the Council of Nicea the substructure of Christian theology remained Semitic and largely apocalyptic in its terminology.81 The bog of terminological inexactitude must be avoided, but if gnostic thought was from the beginning related to apocalyptic, it is significant that R. M. Wilson writes of "something of an atmosphere in which the people of the early Christian centuries lived and moved."82 The work of such scholars gives us pause. They justify the question which Scholem's work compels us to ask. Behind the variety of first-century Judaism did there perhaps exist a single, widely-diffused and popular eschatological frame of reference in both Palestinian and Hellenistic Judaism (to use a distinction now largely obsolete)? Sweeping generalizations are out of place. In the present state of our knowledge it is as difficult to give an affirmative answer as a negative one. For example, R. M. Grant, who once urged that gnosticism was born of the collapse of apocalyptic, now denies this outright.83 Danielou's evidence is more abundant than convincing. Unless or until new texts from Nag Hammadi, Qumran and elsewhere enlighten us further, we must tentatively assert that the role of apocalyptic, however modified and reinterpreted under Hellenistic influences, cannot have been so important in the spread of Christianity as was Lurianic Qabbala in that of Sabbatianism. Such apocalyptic did not dominate the whole of Judaism - which was not in the first century a ghetto but spanned several cultures. We conclude that one element in the twofold coincidence to which Scholem points as necessary to significant messianism is not clear in early Christianity. Whereas in Sabbatianism there was a decisive conceptual framework or myth in the dominant Lurianic Qabbala, to judge from the sources we now have, the conceptual background in early Christianity appears to have been far more complex and varied. We referred to the need of Jews to come to terms with Gentile life. The opposite must not be underestimated: the need that Gentiles often felt to embrace Judaism. The multiplicity of God-fearers, and proselytes, which, according to some, largely accounts for the magnitude of the diaspora,84 80 In a forthcoming work. 81 Theologie du judeo-christianisme: Histoire des doctrines chretiennes avant Nicee (Paris: Desclee, 1958), 1. 1: "La th6ologie chr&amp;tienne utilisera a partir des Apologistes les instruments intellectuels de la philosophie grecque.

He calls proselytism a "major source of [Jewish] population increase." 549</page><page sequence="22">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE indicates that the primordial and nuclear certainty of Jewish monotheism and the sustaining discipline of life under the yoke of the Torah exercised a deep attraction for Gentiles. Any simple conceptual framework which should - on Scholem's terms - dominantly sustain the interpretation of Jesus would have to embrace the Jewish and the Gentile worlds. Where is it to be found?85 This brings us to the second apparent difficulty in finding a dominant apocalyptic, oriented towards the Gentiles, one of the two decisive factors in the spread of Christianity. It springs to the eye. Tojudge from the gospels, the Gentile question, although recognized, was not central to Jesus of Nazareth.86 This disturbing fact leads to the question, What role did the person of Jesus of Nazareth play in early Christianity? Was it as decisive as that of Sabbatai Svi in Sabbatianism? Despite the comparative infrequency of Jesus' engagement with Gentiles, we suggest that the answer to this question is in the affirmative, because Jesus had his Paul and others to interpret him, as Sabbatai Svi had Nathan. Where was the heart of the matter for Paul? He found the significance of the emergence of Jesus as the Messiah particularly in the grace that he had shown to the cam hda'res, and then, why not to Gentiles?87 The Gentile mission was for Paul implicit in the ministry of Jesus. His call was to the 85 Here we have only asked the question whether Judaism provided a unfied ideological structure for the interpretation of Jesus. The answer was largely negative. M. Smith and K. Stendahl have reminded me that in the Greco-Roman world of the first century there were very numerous religious categories into which Jesus could be placed to ensure him a spiritual significance in the eyes of Gentiles, e.g., those of "the divine man," "the magician," "the mystagogue." J. S. Whale has further recalled to me that A. Toynbee emphasized parallels with the figure of Jesus in the Hellenistic world at length (A Study of History [London: Oxford University, 1939], 6. 376-539) in a highly detailed discussion of the astonishing correspondence between the gospel story and stories of certain Hellenic saviors. See esp. pp. 418 onwards. Here such categories and parallels are not strictly our concern, which it was with the nature of Jewish messianism, as understood by Scholem, and as it possibly illumines early Christianity. One thing, however, we may propose. The diversity of hellenistically-derived categories (which were in varying degrees used to interpret Jesus and which doubtless helped the spread of early Christianity in countless ways) does not explain the dynamism of the new movement. The very religious diversity of the Greco-Roman world makes it, in fact, all the more difficult to understand that persistent vitality. S. Sandmel (The First Christian Century in Judaism and Christianity: Certainties and Uncertainties [New York: Oxford University, 1969] 164) finds such parallels with Hellenistic mysteries as are indicated finally unimportant; he emphasizes the content of the Christian kerygma as that which "enabled Christianity to triumph." The fissiparous fertility of available Hellenistic categories helps to illumine the struggle which Christianity had to face to reach "orthodoxy" (see especially W. Bauer, Orthodoxy and Heresy in Earliest Christianity [Philadelphia: Fortress, 1971], but it does not finally explain the reality of its life. The problem raised is a real one, but is outside the scope of this paper, even though Judaism also was not exempt from its magicians, and possibly its divine men and mystagogues. See M. Smith, "Prolegomena to a Discussion of Aretalogies, Divine Men, the Gospels and Jesus," JBL 90 (1971 ) 181-84; P. J. Achtemeier, "Gospel Miracle and the Divine Man," Int 26 (1972) 174-97; and now C.

This is a fundamental datum. There was little if any ground for a concern for Gentiles in the life of Sabbatai Svi. It is this ultimately that explains why Christianity became more than a Jewish but also a Gentile movement, whereas Sabbatianism remained Jewish.88 88 In another context, I should have sought to deal with this question in more detail, but that of the Schweitzer Centennial demanded a concentration on the roles of Sabbatai Svi and Jesus in their respective movements. The difference between Sabbatianism and early Christianity on the Gentile question can be illustrated by a significant detail. Sabbatai Svi was not a teacher; his attempts at theology were stumbling (Sabbatai Svi, 207). But he did claim one peculiar doctrine of his own. Scholem deals with it as "the mystery of the Godhead" as understood by Sabbatai Svi. The main concepts of Lurianism, in fact, all refer to "the mystery of the Godhead." Qabbalists were aware of their very material way of expressing spiritual truth and were disturbed by this (ibid., 27). It was part of their tradition that four persons - Abraham, Hezekiah, Job, and the Messiah - were capable of arriving at the knowledge of God by themselves. It would be expected that Sabbatai Svi as Messiah would know the Godhead in a special way. He himself claimed that he attained his special doctrine of the mystery of the Godhead because he prayed with great concentration (kawwanah) and always meditated on the plain meaning of his words like one praying before his king (ibid., 115); the doctrine developed over the years (ibid., 119, 142-46). But what was the "mystery" which he knew? It developed in a gnostic direction. Scholem writes of the matter as follows: "The hidden Mystery of the Godhead was the realization that the God, who revealed Himself to Israel in His Torah, was not the inaccessible and utterly transcendent En-Sof, but that particular aspect of His power which is manifest in Tifjereth. The first formulations of the 'mystery,' which were quoted later by Sabbatai's disciples in Smyrna, do not say very much more than this; and as this symbolism was a commonplace among kabbalists, one may rightly wonder what Sabbatai's original contribution to it was .... The fact that the later formulations are much profounder suggests that Cardozo's assumption may be correct and that Sabbatai's thought developed as time went on. But we must not exclude the possibility that there was a more profound layer in his teaching from the very beginning. This, at least, is certain: Those who received the Mystery of the Godhead from Sabbatai in later years heard it with a shift of accent which, however slight, made all the difference. Sabbatai revealed to them that 'the Tetragrammaton is our God and that He is superior to the whole emanation; He is also signified by the letter W of the Tetragrammaton YHWH and is called the husband of the Shekhinah' (Raza' de-Razin, MS. Jewish Theological Seminary of America, Deinard 153, fol. 3a). Similar extant formulations of the 'Mystery' no doubt express Sabbatai's thinking as it had crystallized beginning with 1666. But again it is not impossible that even in his first period he had already arrived at the idea that it was not the sefirah (that is, the emanation) itself that was called the 'God of Israel' but something superior to the emanation that merely manifested and clothed itself in the particular sefirah from which it borrowed its names and symbols. The decisive feature of this conception of the 'Mystery' is the distinction between the En-Sof, or unmanifested Root of Roots, and the divine Self called YHWH, which is above the sefirotic emanations, though it manifests itself in one of them. The latent implication of this paradox came to light only in later years and is not explicitly referred to in the testimonies regarding the early period. It amounts to transferring the supervision of providence from the hidden substance (En- Sof or whatever we choose to call it) to the 'God of Israel.' We cannot decide, in the light of our present knowledge, whether at this early stage Sabbatai intended this doctrine, to which there is no analogy in traditional Jewish thought - including that of the kabbalists - but which became notorious in the Sabbatian movement a generation or two later. What we know for certain is that Sabbatai's mystical thinking developed in a definitely gnostic direction. The symbol YHWH no longer signified one sefirah among others, but a substance that derives from the highest and utterly hidden Root and that, together with the Shekhinah, remains above the whole structure of sefiroth. There is good reason for dating this development to a period when Sabbatai had come 551</page><page sequence="24">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE We enter here disputed ground. There probably existed in both Sabbatianism and early Christianity many believers for whom the personalities of Sabbatai Svi and Jesus, respectively, were a matter of indifference and even unknown. But this must not mislead us. Ultimately, it was the personality of each messiah that gave to the movements they inaugurated their peculiarity. One ventures to urge that, in the end, what moved Sabbatians was that the Messiah had appeared, incidentally as Sabbatai Svi; whereas what astounded early Christians was that it was Jesus of Nazareth who had come as the Messiah. The difference between Sabbatai Svi and Jesus, draped as they both came to be in the traditional messianic mantles, is ultimately a difference, quite simply, of what we might call "character." Rabbinic leaders were so embarrassed by Sabbatai Svi's conduct that they sought to destroy the evidence for it.89 In Sabbatai Svi, despite his appeal to the masses, there seems to be no real concern for them such as breaks through the Jesus of the gospels. There is an insensitivity to the ostentatious into contact with Lurianic kabbalism. He could have found support for its conception that there were substances distinct from En-Sof and yet above the sefiroth and attributes in the Lurianic doctrine of parsufim, or 'configurations,' which similarly places an entity called the 'most primordial man of all,' or simply the 'Primordial Man' (Adam Qadmon), above the world of emanation (of sefiroth). Although Sabbatai never accepted the propositions of Lurianism as they are formulated in the kabbalistic writings of the school, it is quite possible that they stimulated him to a more novel and daring formulation of his own Mystery of the Godhead" (ibid., 120-22). This lengthy quotation reveals the world of speculation or myth within which Sabbatai Svi moved. Contrast with the mystery with which he was concerned that which occupied Paul and the Ephesian epistle: that concerning Israel and the Gentiles. There are hints of mysteries not shared by all in the NT, but generally there is a simplicity about its teaching (see, e.g., Matt 11:25-30) which is far removed from the involved speculation of Sabbatianism and of Sabbatai Svi himself (see BAG, 532a). Particularly for Paul and his circles it was the Jewish-Gentile question which set the terms for discussing the mystery of God. And Paul found the significance of the emergence of Jesus as Messiah particularly in the grace that he had shown to sinners, including Gentiles. Paul's activity modified the sequence of events as anticipated in Jewish apocalyptic. Gentiles symbolically entered Jerusalem before Israel had all been saved. But, for our purpose here, this is less important than to recognize the apocalyptic framework presupposed by Paul and others. This did enable early Christianity to interpret Jesus as the Savior of Gentiles as well as of Jews. 89 See, e.g., Sabbatai Svi, 750, 760-67, esp. p. 763. Scholem writes: "Penitential exercises and extreme mortifications having been a characteristic feature of the movement, the rabbis of Venice demanded their cessation. The believers, on the other hand, wished to continue them. The Venetian rabbis also wrote to all the communities, commanding them to destroy all documents relating to the movement of 1666 and to obliterate all testimony to this shameful episode. This attempt at censorship is mentioned by R. Samuel Aboab in a responsum written about eight years after the event. Aboab states that after the apostasy all the congregations in the Holy Land, Turkey, Germany, Holland, Poland, and Russia admitted that opponents of the movement had been right, and recognizing their error they 'burned all the records and writings in which his name was mentioned, in order that it should not be remembered.... And that which we heard from the far-away cities we beheld ourselves in the cities of Italy. .... They are repented [of their belief in Sabbatai] . . .and confessed, "Woe unto us, for we have sinned." Also the rabbis of Constantinople . . . sent orders to the communities near and far ... [to do away] with everything that had been written about that deceitful affair, . . . that it should be forgotten and mentioned no more" (Debar Shemu'el, fol. 97a). The large-scale suppression of records and documents relating to the movement was no doubt successful, much to the detriment of historical research. 552</page><page sequence="25">DAVIES: REFLECTIONS ON SABBATAI SVI and bizarre which is unthinkable in Jesus and, unless (paradoxically) antinomianism be an expression of such, an absence of sensitive moral concern. Sabbatai Svi was not a teacher of morality. The difference between the two messiahs comes to clearest expression in the apostasy of Sabbatai Svi, and the death of Jesus on the cross. Scholem calls the apostasy the most execrable act possible in the Jewish mind.90 Two ways were open to Sabbatians after Sabbatai Svi's apostasy, either to follow his actions, to imitate him, or to see in his fate a call to ever greater rigor in obedience to the Law. Sabbatianism developed along both ways. Some believers followed the latter course and showed a zeal in piety and morality which outshone that of other Jews and, indeed, became a mark of their heretical faith. Such Sabbatians recognized that while Sabbatai lived on the brink of the new eon, they themselves did not and could not follow his freedom from the Law.91 Their attitude could be compared with that of early Jewish-Christians who retained their zeal for the Torah, even though believing in Jesus as the Messiah. In the course of time these nomistic Sabbatians declined and reverted to the main stream of Judaism; historically they were not significant. Other Sabbatians took the former of the two possible courses noted. They took Sabbatai Svi as a paradigm and an example to be imitated. To do so, they had to call evil good. They had to justify apostasy itself as messianic and redemptive. To do so in the end was to destroy all values dear to Judaism. It implied an ultimate cynicism and nihilism, born doubtless of a profound despair, in which the demand of God was mocked. It is no accident that the most distinctive doctrine of Sabbatianism came to be that of redemption through sin.92 The infinitely complex and even pathological reasons for the conduct of Sabbatai Svi excite our pity. In the radical Sabbatian wing, its theological and practical consequences were disastrous. Despite the indifference of the masses of Sabbatians to the character of their messiah, his passive surrender to the power of impurity and iniquity, even as he persisted in his messianic mission, stamped itself upon his radical followers. In loyalty to their apostatized redeemer, they too were led to strange acts. Like the Messiah himself, they too had to descend into impurity; for them too good had to become evil. The very weakness of Sabbatai Svi they took for strength. And it was the radical Sabbatians who persisted; it was they who became historically significant. As time went on, the figure of Sabbatai Svi, within Sabbatianism itself, became vague almost to the point of 90 Particularly illuminating is The Messianic Idea, 6, 78-82. Scholem describes the apostasy as a "final step of holy sinfulness, in fact, its apotheosis," in the chapter "Redemption Through Sin." 91 Even Nathan of Gaza did not believe that he himself was free from the Law; there was a qualitative difference between himself and Sabbatai Svi. Nathan remained a pious, observant Jew. He interpreted the actions of the Messiah but did not imitate them (see Sabbatai Svi, 229). There developed two opposing factions in Sabbatianism, one moderate and piously inclined and the other radical, antinomian, and ultimately nihilistic. The former did not consider that it had to imitate Sabbatai Svi. See G. G. Scholem, The Messianic Idea, 100-108. 92 Ibid., 78. 553</page><page sequence="26">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE anonymity.93 Perversely, his lack of integrity alone remained significant, and that diabolically. Scholem has referred to the gulf that separates the character of Sabbatai from that of Jesus of Nazareth.94 As we indicated, the interest of much of primitive Christianity in the history and personality of Jesus has been denied.95 But while we recognize the force of the arguments of those who hold this view and the support it receives to a degree from developments in Sabbatianism, it is wiser to urge that, as the very emergence of the gospels indicates, the character of Jesus at least, if not the inner recesses of his personality and the minute biographical details of his life, in various degrees and dimensions, remained central for early Christianity. That he was the messiah was significant for early Christianity, in a way that Sabbatai Svi as a person was riot for Sabbatianism. We consider it legitimate to speak of the personality of Jesus or his character and do not find the suggestion, recently made by Dean S. W. Sykes of Cambridge, that the heart (I reject the word essence, as did R. W. Funk) of Christianity lies in the character of Jesus, easily dismissible.96 But because so many find difficulty in speaking of or in picturing the personality of Jesus, we shall seek to pinpoint the essential difference between Sabbatai Svi and Jesus, not in terms of their characters, but in terms of another dimension, the Law. Judaism lived by a moment, that of revelation, and by a dimension, that of tradition, the latter being the explanation and application of the former. The meaning of the revelation at Sinai was variously interpreted. As the Temple Scroll at Qumran has illustrated with astonishing force, the extent to which the Law itself was examined and even questioned in first-century Judaism was far greater than we had often assumed.97 Currents emerged in Judaism in which in the messianic age even a new tora was anticipated. Whether these currents were as early as the emergence of Christianity is questioned; certainly they existed in the Judaism that Sabbatai Svi knew.98 Messianic freedom, as Sabbatai understood it, allowed him to live beyond the Law. His position led to antinomian nihilism. If allowed to develop unchecked, the freedom of early Christianity could have had the same result. But whereas in Sabbatianism the 93 See, e.g., Sabbatai Svi, 252, 254, 290, 371. 94 The Messianic Idea, 62. 95 See most recently H. Conzelmann, "Das Selbstbewusstsein Jesu," Theologie als schriftauslegung: Aufsdtze zum Neuen Testament (Munich: Kaiser, 1974) 30-41. 9h "The Essence of Christianity," Religious Studies 7 (1971)298. Drawing upon D. Knowles, Sykes understands character as "the final and most precious thing in a man, his goodness of will, achieved by conscious and tenacious choice" (The Historian and Character [Cambridge: Cambridge University, 1963] 11). Precisely this kind of steeled will was absent in Sabbatai Svi. He was incapable of consistency in his conduct, probably for psychological reasons. Outside his periods of "illumination," as they were called, he was a pious, observing Jew. This is stressed by Scholem (The Messianic Idea and Sabbatai Svi, 11). 97 See Y. Yadin, "The Temple Scroll," New Directions in Biblical Archaeology (eds. D. N. Freedman and J. C. Greenfield; Garden City: Doubleday, 1969) 139-48, esp. p. 141. 9K See my book, The Setting of the Sermon on the Mount (Cambridge: Cambridge University, 1964) 109-90. 554</page><page sequence="27">DAVIES: REFLECTIONS ON SABBATAI SVI messianic founder (who was, we repeat, not a teacher) could supply no check to antinomianism but only a stimulus, in early Christianity there could be found such a check in the ministry, character, and teaching of Jesus.99 The attitudes of Jesus and Paul to the Law cannot be discussed at the tail end of a long lecture. Perhaps the Fourth Gospel best sums up that attitude when it speaks of the new commandment of the gospel as constituted by agape. The concentration on agape as the quintessence of the Law is not a negative dismissal of the tradition of Judaism, but its radical reduction to one dominating dimension. The life of Jesus of Nazareth, as understood by his followers, was consonant with this dimension, an expression of agape. It could, therefore, always provide a corrective to any antinomian messianic license that might emerge. This did not prevent antinomianism from emerging in early Christianity. Over against the concentration on the Law in Jewish- Christianity stood the amorality and immorality of gnostics and other Christians. The situation in both early Christianity and Sabbatianism was highly dialectical and complex. But at the root of the Christian tradition was a founder, whose impact could provide a salutary control in a way that Sabbatai could not. The Lord with whom the Chrietian tradition was sometimes virtually identified was such that he could be a constant corrective, even though misinterpreted in both nomistic and antinomian terms. 00 As we have expressed it elsewhere, Jesus became the Torah of Christians. '0 Here lies the heart of the matter, not in the apocalyptic imagery and fantasies with which he, like Sabbatai Svi, came to be clothed. We have sought to apply Scholem's categories to early Christianity. With regard to one of the two essential dimensions which he finds behind significant messianic movements, caution is necessary. It is easier to isolate Lurianic Qabbala as the one Sabbatian framework than to point to such a single conceptual framework, apart from the Scriptures, governing early Christianity. As for the role of the messianic figures, Jesus and Sabbatai, they were both significant in their respective movements not only as catalysts or initiators but as formative factors. The constructive constraint of Christ's ministry in early Christianity stands markedly over against the negative, distorting, and ultimately nihilistic influence of Sabbatai in Sabbatianism. One final word. Lurianic Qabbala was far too complex and comprehensive a phenomenon to be simply labelled as apocalyptic. But it had 99 See my chapter on "The Moral Teaching of the New Testament," The Use of the Old Testament in the New and Other Essays: Studies in Honor of William Franklin Stinespring (ed. J. M. Efird; Durham: Duke University, 1972) 310-32. It is not only the motif of the "imitation of Christ" that points to this. 100 See 0. Cullmann, "Paradosis et Kyrios: Le probleme de la tradition dans le paulinisme," RHPR 17 (1937) 424. The same oscillation between moral earnestness and immorality emerges in certain gnostic sects as among the Sabbatians, see R. M. Wilson, Gnosis and the New Testament, 11. 101 See my Paul and Rabbinic Judaism (2d ed.; London: SPCK, 1958) 147. The theme is developed by J. A. Sanders, "Torah and Christ," Int 29 (1975) 372-90. 555</page><page sequence="28">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE absorbed apocalyptic elements. 102 So ingrained in our minds is the halakic conception of Judaism, especially after 70 C.E., that it requires an effort to grasp that apocalyptic, messianic expectations which had emerged before the common era persisted in strength throughout the medieval period and down to the seventeenth century so that Sabbatai Svi could easily draw upon their dramatic dynamism. Jewish engagement with apocalyptic did not cease with the fall of Jerusalem in 70 C.E.,103 and so one cannot read the history of Sabbatai Svi, at least with Albert Schweitzer in mind, without being compelled to reflect upon the significance of apocalyptic. One might gather from Schweitzer that it is a dead end;'04 from others that it is a kind of collective megalomania. 105 But using the term in a broad sense at this point, apocalyptic presents both positive and negative aspects. To assess these would require a knowledge of the meaning of symbols which is beyond my competence. An examination of the nature of the symbolism of apocalyptic, 102 See Sabbatai Svi, 8, 15, 52-77. Apocalyptic elements emerged in Sabbatianism. Scholem connects them especially with the masses. He offers as one of the reasons for the success of the message of Nathan of Gaza that it "contained a curious combination of traditional popular apocalyptic and of hints at its reinterpretation in the light of Lurianic kabbalism" (ibid., 465). He holds that "it has been one of the strangest errors of modern Wissenschaft des Judentums to deny the continuity of Jewish apocalypticism" (ibid., 9). 103 C. K. Barrett proposes that the last decade of the first century, with few exceptions, saw "the end of Jewish apocalyptic,for this expression of Jewish faith hadfulfilled its purposes" (the words that I here italicize could be qualified by some such phrase as "for the time being perhaps"). That Jewish apocalyptic did not come to an end at the date suggested is now beyond dispute, and not only as "with few exceptions." See The Gospel of John and Judaism (Philadelphia: Fortress, 1975) 58. 104 It is not easy to grasp Schweitzer's meaning in his dismissal of the historical Jesus and the quest for him. In his second edition of The Quest of the Historical Jesus, which has not been translated into English, his words are shattering. In the translation of the relevant portion offered by Henry Clark (The Ethical Mysticism of Albert Schweitzer [Boston: Beacon, 1962] 198), Schweitzer wrote that moderns "continually tried to make of this 'fanatic' a contemporary man and a theologian. .. ." It is possible that Schweitzer did not see Jesus as a "fanatic," but that smug scholars saw him as such and tried to "tame" him to their small hearts. The precise examination of Schweitzer's thought is not possible here. For a brief presentation, see D. L. Dungan, "Reconsidering Albert Schweitzer," The Christian Century (Oct. 8, 1975) 874. 105 This phrase, borrowed from N. Cohn, The Pursuit of the Millennium (London: Secker and Warburg, 1957), I owe to H. Anderson, who allowed me to see an unpublished lecture on "A Future for Apocalyptic?" Anderson recognizes that apocalyptic has a future because "the untamed and, perhaps, untameable" element of man's spirit will always demand and issue in fantasy. He also allows that apocalyptic has served to overcome the frequent isolation of Christian theology from cosmology. But he too has seen an aspect of its ugly face. To him it is not the fruit of a living hope, but of a world-weariness and pessimism which issues in an ultimately apathetic waiting for the divine intervention rather than in any active transformation of present ills. In this he has much to support him in the sources. His distrust of apocalyptic leads him to urge the simple use of the term "eschatology" to express the hope of Jesus. His lecture reinforces the need for the kind of terminological exactitude which we desiderate. On this, see also J. Carmignac, "Les dangers de l'eschatologie," NTS 17 (1970-71) 365-90, who even pleads for the dropping of the term "eschatology." But, as Anderson notes, "we cannot solve a problem by getting rid of the words associated with it." We can only attempt to use them precisely. 556</page><page sequence="29">DAVIES: REFLECTIONS ON SABBATAI SVI such as has been begun by Amos Wilder106 and others, is a crying need. On the positive side, apocalyptic, emerging and re-emerging again and again in times of extreme suffering and despair, is the expression, in the light of the divine purpose, of a legitimate critical response to the iniquities, corruptions, and distortions of this world, to which, alas, most of us are at least half-blind. It is the element of divine discontent, of the desire for something afar, of the aim which exceeds our grasp. Without this discontent, the dead hand of custom, stagnation, and insensitivity throttles life, and even ancient good becomes uncouth. From this point of view, apocalyptic is the leaven of history. Its societal and cosmic imagery, symbols and hopes, which turn human longings to vivid expectations, are always necessary as a spur to sensitivity and a corrective against a false, irresponsible, individualistic piety. Even more, these expectations themselves - unrealistic as they often are- have a creative impact and, against themselves, modify societies even when those same societies reject them. Such hopes open up new possibilities, new pathways to Utopia, even if they never arrive there. A literature produced when man is at the end of his tether has its own stark, unblinded, and penetrating insight, even though its actual practical counsels, born of despair, are often dubious. The plea of K. Koch for the rediscovery of "apocalyptic" is understandable.'07 But, on the negative side, it needs careful control. A good stimulant, does it constitute a good diet? The ivied walls of the academy in which we dwell at ease make the appreciation of apocalyptic difficult for most of us. But this being admitted, again to use the term in an undifferentiated sense, apocalyptic has an ugly face. To read Scholem's work is to stand amazed, overwhelmed, and -it is to be stated - alienated by the bizarre, unhealthy, and unsavory possibilities of apocalyptic, messianic, political, and other indulgence. 08 Despite its suffering and courage, its moral and intellectual striving and daring, the practical consequences of what we normally refer to, without differentiation, as apocalyptic are no less baffling and even terrifying than its often lurid imagery. The rabbinic reaction to such apocalyptic as a pernicious menace is understandable. In Sabbatianism, an unrestrained utopian apocalyptic-mysticism worked itself out in antinomianism. Early Christianity knew the same temptation, but in its main developments, though not in all its expressions, it was often spared from the more undesirable tendencies by the constraint of its founding figure. Early Christianity was apocalyptic, but it 106 See "The Rhetoric of Ancient and Modern Apocalyptic," Int 25 (1971) 436-53. 107 The Rediscovery of Apocalyptic, 25-28, 405. 108 This makes understandable the reluctance of many Christian scholars to classify Jesus among the apocalypticists, This reluctance antedates the work of Schweitzer, but the latter provoked the reaction of C. H. Dodd who, although he does not state this and seldom if ever refers to Schweitzer's work, had the latter in mind. Cf. W. G. Kiimmel, The New Testament: The History of the Investigation of Its Problems (Nashville: Abingdon, 1972) 260; K. Koch, "The Agonised Attempts to Save Jesus from Apocalyptic: Continental New Testament Scholarship," Rediscovery of Apocalyptic, 57-97. History makes one suspicious of what Stendahl has called "the eschatoiogical itch." But it may be well to recall also that "if hopes were dupes" (and they have often been such in messianism), yet "fears may be liars." 557</page><page sequence="30">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE was such under the constraint of the agape (to risk distortion through brevity) of Christ. The sum of the matter is this: if we are to continue to describe early Christianity as apocalyptic, it seems to me that we can only do so by carefully differentiating what we mean. P. D. Hanson has led the way by drawing a distinction between prophetic eschatology and apocalyptic eschatology, a distinction which is not without parallel with that drawn by Scholem for a later period between restorative and utopian messianism.109 But this we cannot pursue here. In this centennial lecture I have referred only very sparingly to the great Albert Schweitzer. But I have tried to recall you to the haunting question which he bequeathed to us. How are we to preserve visionary intensity without an illusory fanaticism? It is because it offers a sobering warning against any uncritical concentration on and endorsement of an undifferentiated apocalyptic that I have reflected with you on Scholem's great work. 109 See The Messianic Idea, passim. T. W. Manson's work ("Some Reflections on Apocalyptic," Aux sources de la tradition chretienne: AMlanges offerts a M. Maurice Goguel [Neuchatel: Delachaux et Niestl6, 1950] 139-45) still deserves pondering. He finds that "apocalyptic is an attempt to rationalize and systematize the predictive side of Prophecy as one side of the providential ordering of the Universe. The other side of the systematising process of the scribal treatment of the Law leads to the codification of the Mishnah" (p. 142). He expresses no condemnation of either development, but rather implies that apocalyptic supplied evidence for the intensity with which the belief in providence was held in Judaism. He refers especially to Josephus' treatment of Daniel (Ant. 10.11.7 ?266-81). (One is reminded here of the position of Santayana referred to by Amos N. Wilder [Modern Poetry and the Christian Tradition (New York: Scribner, 1952), 3 n. 1] that "poetry and religion are identical in essence, though they relate themselves differently to practical life: poetry by a dramaticpresentation of values and religion by precepts and codes [my italics]). Is "apocalyptic" the poetry of religion? If so, it is its romantic poetry, accompanied by the dangers of the romantic. These are well expressed by Wallace Fowlie, in dealing with Rimbaud (The Age of Surrealism [Bloomington: Indiana University, 1972]). Pointing to classicism as involving order, control, considered choice, synthesis, rules, Fowlie refers to the romantics and to romanticism as always associated with revolution and liberation (ibid., 14). On p. 58 he emphasizes in Rimbaud the perilous aspect of romanticism. "It exacts so much destruction, of order and conventionality, of familiar patterns, and rules which had seemed indispensable disciplines, that it makes the poet a despiser of order, an anarchist in temperament and technique .... I call this way perilous, because it opens the gates to all kinds of charlatans, of undisciplined writers, of false visionaries." It is easy to connect apocalyptic with this kind of romanticism, but the connection cannot be examined here. D. Daube urges again that apocalyptists despite their violent writings are quietists and that this should modify the criticisms I express above.
