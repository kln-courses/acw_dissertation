Since her arrival in Ireland in 1965, Sonja Landweer has been admired for her mastery with materials, here Nicola Gordon Bowe discusses her life's work currently on view at VISUAL in Carlow The Netherlands Landweer's Crafts Council exhibition are of among Ireland at VISUAL, the and sponsors the which Embassy offers of of Sonja the the Netherlands are among the sponsors of Sonja Landweer's exhibition at VISUAL, which offers the first-ever opportunity to see the full range of work made by Landweer over the past fifty years in her adoptive Ireland. Although the invitation to the exhibition featured her Friendly Feathered Demons of the late 1960s, tousle-headed, fetishistic black grogged earthenware totemic pots, topped with feathers, sisal, wooden beads and udder-like protru- sions, the artist is probably best known for her flared earth- enware vessels poised on tiny serrated feet (Figs 6&amp;7). Consummately constructed, finely articulated, glazed with sonorously warm, deep, elemental colours, achieved with nickel, or iron, these exquisite forms made a lasting impres- sion on all those who saw them. Although she only threw such wide-rimmed bowls on the wheel until 1981, after she had lived in Ireland for sixteen years, her inventively glazed work became much sought-after by collectors when it was exhibited in David Hendriks' avant-garde gallery in St Stephen's Green, Dublin between 1967-81. If anything, they now look more magical, more glowing, than ever, grouped in 'families' with kindred forms and colours to stun- ning effect in this extensive show, which fills three prime gal- leries in VISUAL's impressive contemporary arts space. Exhibits are drawn from Landweer's own collection and that of the Princessehof Keramic Museum in Leeuwarden, the National Museum of Ireland, the OPW and the Ulster Museum, as well as private collections in Ireland and Holland, where Landweer's reputation has never waned. Showcases in the gallery chronologically furthest away from the entrance reveal exquisitely made bowls batik- glazed with archaic, timeless markings. These Landweer had pioneered in the early 1960s in her native Amsterdam before</page><page sequence="2">3 came to as in-residence at the newly set up Kilkenny Design Workshops between 1965-66. One, with a perfectly turned ebony lid by Landweer's fellow Kilkenny Design Workshops Dutch craftswoman, Maria van Kesteren, was illustrated in Ann Mulrooney's Irish Arts Review feature, 'A Matter of Form' (Spring 2009, page 78, Fig 5). The loose, painterly abstract washes of colour and subtly textured surfaces on these bowls reflect Landweer's lifelong fascination with the nature and behaviour of those minerals which are as vital a part of our own physiological structure as they are of the earth we inhabit. The essentially symbiotic relationship between man and nature has continued to inform all parts of her life, whether she is making vessels, body adornments or paper work, cultivating her dynamically planted garden, try- ing to preserve the balance of her own physical body, or dreaming up new combinations of untried or revisited forms. As Mulrooney has remarked, her experimental approach to materials, pushing the processes of her chosen materials beyond their known limits, 'has continued to define her practice' throughout her working life. Thus, the visitor to this carefully displayed exhibition can trace the evolution of Landweer's work from the early 1960s, when she had already established a distinguished 1 Sonja Landweer in 2 BLISTERED 3 SEED FORMS 4 HORNED her studio at OVOIDS2010 200Д bronze Private INVERTED OVOID Kilkenny Design earthenware, Collections 2000 earthenware, Works. individual black and bronze glaze Private bronze glaze Artist's Collection Collection career in nouana producing batiked ceram- ics and silks as well as jewellery, and worked as guest potter with Arabia in Helsinki, experimenting with indigenous glazes. Here, her inventive technical skills are already appar- ent in her playful yet impressively accomplished shapes, sur- faces (some pitted, or scored, others blistered in anticipation of recent sculptural forms) and variations on closed and open vessel forms in earthy shades of brown or a timeless, radiantly turquoise alkaline glaze. These seminal works, and deliberately coarse black grogged and stacked storage pots whose stem-like arrangement anticipates later seed-forms, are chronologically clustered according to colour and form to great effect. Other cases, with work from the 1970s, are filled with suffused pink or mottled blue nickel-glazed jars, globes, bowls and vessels redolent the the untamed Burren landscape and the she found around her on the Nore, where she and the painter Barrie Cooke lived. Iron and nickel glazes endow beautifully judged, deep burnished gold organic vessel forms with thickly dripped trailed markings.

Made in 1981, and now part of an installation housed at the Ballytobin Camphill Community, this exhibit is also impor- tant because it marks a crucial transition in the artist's work - from open to closed forms, reflecting her concern with the potential for growth from the inside, with metamorphosis - and shortly before a crisis in her life, when an over-active thy- roid caused the first major crash in her health.

Here we see the sort of technical skill and inspired design she can apply to even the simplest materials by ingeniously juxtaposing unexpected properties and combinations between them. In the best contemporary Dutch tradition, she miraculously transforms feathers, sequins, brass wire, sisal, bone, cut paper, felt, nylon filament, even plastic cable, through her imaginative resourcefulness and dexterity into wearable sculpture. Scarlet red felt, black LIKE BRANCUSI'S POIGNANTLY ABSTRACTED YET ANTHROPOMORPHIC SCULPTURE, THESE WORKS SUGGEST THE VULNERABILITY OF THE HUMAN CONDITION remembered from the Burren, and to monoprints based on elemental beings that seemed to protect her vulnerable body and spirit. They, along with later monoprint Angels and Guardians in mossy, licheny winged shapes, complement her resourceful Slate Forms (1989), also on show. These small sculptural realizations in Kilkenny slate from her studio roof (complete with nail holes), polished into characterful Arp-like shapes and slipped into grooves on black wooden blocks, exert a poignant presence. The same (unpolished) roof slates suede and silk, and inlaid stoneware are among the materials inventively moulded into dramatic crescent collars while myr- iad autumnal hues of pheasant and woodcock feathers form an unforgettable waistcoat. Back in the main lily-pool gallery, a collection of small, fis- sured, variously configured black earthenware Seed Forms (1990-93) rest their hand-polished surfaces on their respec- tive protective soft amber and damask rose-coloured silk- lined chamois pouches. Conceived as talismanic healing 136 IRISH ARTS REVIEW I WINTER 2011</page><page sequence="4">pieces to be held, these visceral, sensuous forms appeal strongly to the viewer's sense of touch, whether closed in the hand or mounted on wooden platforms in their subsequent patinated cast bronze versions. It is as though they are con- cealing within their virtually closed forms all the artist's arrested energy, and perhaps the pain and shock of suffering. Landweer had to dig deep inside herself in order to begin making voluminous forms again. The ensuing smoothly lus- trous Large Black Ovoids (1993) (Fig 5), caressed by single brushstrokes of gold leaf, suggest votive ritual use. Like Brancusi's poignantly abstracted yet anthropomorphic sculp- ture, these works suggest the vulnerability of the human con- dition. In complete transformation from her wide open flowering bowls, their allusion to seeds and eggs compounds the impression of internal metamorphosis. These command- ing Ovoid forms, seemingly solid, monumental on their limestone plinths, present a new, impenetrable gravitas which defies touch. It is almost inconceivable to think they began not as marble or stone but as clay, slowly built up from the inside, closed in, guarded, before their black pol- ished outer surfaces were built up little by little on their fired earthenware exteriors. In contrast, Small Matters (1995-96), stoneware gathered pouches with smokey copper slips remi- niscent of bracket tree fungus, grouped together with early versions of the interlocking standing forms that the artist calls Spatial Relationship s , consciously invite investigation.

Private Collection with rounded heads, alert to each other, is one of a series entitled Relationships (2001), (Irish Arts Review , Spring 2009, page 78, Fig 6) which she has likened to Frank Gehry's Bilbao Guggenheim architectural protrusions. Although clay has remained Landweer's prime substance, in 2000 bronze casting allowed her to have two of her concave- headed earthenware Inverted Ovoid pieces (Fig 4) translated into less fragile forms, notably her trilobyte-inspired Bronze Horned Vessel. Miraculously to her, the skills of her colleagues at the Dublin CAST Foundry could emulate something like the depth and range of subtly mottled colours akin to the infi- nite spectrum she had masterfully evolved over the years through her experiments with reduction-firing nickel, iron and other metallic glazes on clay. Such atavistic bronzes are well represented in the exhibition, their commanding yet abstract presences ranging from twin Asymmetrical Inverted Forms (2006) in non-conversational mode, the sympathetically engaged Dialogue (2008/9) ( Irish Arts Review , Spring 2009, Fig 1), and the warmly coloured, glowingly veined Conker (2008), whose dipped head also appears as a shiny gold-pol- ished rim on top of a black body. Similarly, her Totems appear in an ominously judgmental posse grouped together in black earthenware or, transfigured in bronze, as a bulbous, desert- rose coloured individual patinated with lichen-like markings. Susan Holland, acting curator at VISUAL, is to be con- gratulated on producing an exhibition and catalogue which pay full tribute to a rare soul, whose unmatched skills, creativity and vision continue to be an inspiration.
