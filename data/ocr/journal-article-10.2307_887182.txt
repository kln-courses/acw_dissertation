<plain_text><page sequence="1">Brancusi's 'Prodigal son'* BY DRAGOS GHEORGHIU THE recent Brancusi exhibition in Paris and Philadelphia provided unprecedented opportunities to analyse the development of the sculptor's work,' making it possible to trace the evolution of certain themes and to compare the same subjects treated in different mate- rials. With the notable exception of Sidney Geist's work, research on Brancusi has tended to neglect the study of materials and sculp- tural techniques in favour of other approaches. If closer attention is paid to the way in which he transmutes shapes from one medium to another, it is possible to arrive at a more precise interpretation of some of the Romanian artist's famous sculptures and, in some cases, to a more reliable chronology. Brancusi's Prodigal son (Figs.56 and 63), perhaps the least studied of all his early works, has been described as a 'sculpture of fantasy'.' When it is considered in terms of its genesis, materials and techni- cal processes, however, it takes on a new and more comprehensible significance. It is important to take as a starting point for reconsid- ering the sculpture the photograph made by Brancusi himself of the piece viewed from its right side (Fig.57), showing the original posi- tion of the base, with the step-like face on the right.3 At the exhibi- tions in Philadelphia and Paris, the work was shown turned on its base, which was clearly not the sculptor's intention. In the catalogue Ann Temkin writes of the work that 'the image of a kneeling figure is implied in the sharply faceted planes and open volumes of the wooden form',' following Geist's first decoding of the sculpture in his monograph of 1968. Geist wrote: 'The image of the returning son is not easy to read. It requires a sense of humor to see here a kneeling figure, one hand on the ground, the head thrust forward, a pack on the back'." Both Eric Shanes and Albert Elsen have accepted the main lines of this interpretation, the latter pointing out that Brancusi 'traveled with a knapsack and that he returned to his fatherland in 1914 after a five year absence', so that the sculpture could be seen as 'a metaphorical self portrait'.'" The puzzling disjunction between the apparently abstract nature of the sculpture and the implied narrative in its title have led to its being considered one of 'the most intricate of Brancusi's works'.7 It is symptomatic of the bafflement evident in responses to the piece that it was shown reversed in a recent monograph,8 and that in the catalogue of the Philadelphia exhibition a photograph including the Prodigal son taken by Yasuo Kuniyoshi at the Brum- mer exhibition of 1926 was airbrushed after enlargement, produc- *The support of the Romanian Ministry of Culture made it possible for me to visit the Brancusi exhibition at the Centre Georges Pompidou.

Furthermore, I suspect that all the lit- erature on the piece cited above has been decisively swayed by the title and configuration of Rodin's Prodigal son (1888, Mus'e Rodin, Paris),'" in view of Rodin's significant influence on the young Bran- cusi. Thus the imagery of Rodin's statue, a kneeling figure with upraised arms, has been assigned to Brancusi's carving, which has nonetheless been interpreted as an 'abstract' work because this pose can be read into it only with great difficulty. The purpose of the present article is to offer a new interpretation of the so-called Prodigal son, by comparing the various human fig- ures carved by Brancusi in his early period, and tracing the way in which the artist translated a single theme into different materials. Also relevant to this discussion is the influence exerted on Brancusi, at the time he left Rodin's studio in 1907, of contemporary paint- ings and drawings by Picasso and Matisse in which the human fig- ure is asymmetrically drawn. The translation of modes of drawing into sculpture, and the effects produced by switching from one sculptural medium into another, helped Brancusi to arrive at his novel approach to art. To trace the genesis of the Prodigal son of 1914-15, it may be help- ful to go back to these early years. By the time he left Rodin's stu- dio, Brancusi had already received the commission for the funerary monument in Buzau, Romania, the contract for which he signed on 18th April 1907. The kneeling female mourner in the first clay version of the Prayer was probably inspired by Bartholome or another Salon sculptor. In the final form (bronze, Muzeul Nation- al de Arta al Romafniei, Bucharest; Figs.58 and 59) it is a synthesis between Rodin's drawings, his sculpture of the same name of 1909," and avant-garde drawing, apparent in the modelling of the asymmetrical face. Brancusi went on to take separate elements of the Prayer as a source of inspiration for several distinct works made of different materials, perhaps influenced by the fragmentation involved in his drawing practices. Prayer's ovoid head, with asymmetrical eyes and trunk slightly bent forward, can be recognised in Head (Apollinaire) (1908, Apolli- naire Collection, Paris), the Sleeping muse (1909, various versions), the drawing Bust ofa woman with long hair (c. 1912-13, study for AMade- moiselle Pogany, Musee National d'Art Moderne, Paris). Prayer's torso reappears in the marble Torso ofa young girl (1909, Muzeul de arta, Craiova), and the prayer theme can be traced in subsequent works such as Ancientfigure (1908, Art Institute of Chicago), which shows a kneeling woman with her arms joined in prayer, and Alaiastra "Exh. cat. cited at note 4 above, p.59, fig. 12. At the Brummer show, the Prodigal son was positioned in front of a framed portrait drawing of a woman, probably the draw- ing now in the Art Institute of Chicago, so that the face of the latter appeared through the vault-like aperture of the sculpture. Kuniyoshi framed the photograph in such a way that the round top of the woman's head coincided with the arch in the wood (see the French edition of the catalogue, Paris [1995], p.60). In the airbrushed version of the photograph the arch is rendered as a straight line. "'See Y. TAILLANDER: Rodin, Paris [1967], p.34; R.

Special examples of polished material are the wooden sculptures inspired by the bronze Prayer. The first one, in my opinion, is The first step of 1913, later truncated and reworked by the artist as the varnished Head of a child (Fig.60, Musee National d'Art Moderne, Paris).'" Here, the amputated left arm and the curved right hand are similar to those in Prayer, but there are also many differences, such as the way of shaping the eye and mouth which are specific to wood cutting, and the positioning of the right arm and the body. Though Thefirst step had not been highly polished, the Head ofa child was varnished in order to make it resemble a piece of bronze. The second example is the Prodigal son of 1914 or 1914-15 12For the Sleeping muse and Mademoiselle Pogany, see ibid., pp. 102-04, 120-22, 293 94, nos.15, 26, 27, 115-17. 13R.

(Figs.56, 57 and 63),15 which was worked from a piece of old oak, well polished, but not varnished, and positioned on a stone step-like pedestal (as is well known, Brancusi frequently used a different material for the base from that employed for the sculpture itself). The sculpture consists of two juxtaposed cylindrical drums of dif- ferent sizes, supported by a rectangular post at the back and in front by a roughly diamond-shaped volume carved out into an arch shape below. In my opinion each element of the main volume has a precise equivalent in the constituents of Brancusi's contemporary anthropomorphic wooden sculptures. The larger horizontal drum is similar to human faces of the type portrayed in the Caryatid (1914-26, Fogg Art Museum, Cambridge MA). The oblique cut at the left edge of the drum is analogous to the asymmetrical eyes of the First step (Fig.6 1; 1913-14) and its derivatives, the First cry (plas- ter, bronze and black cement casts of the head of the First step) and Little French girl (1914-18; Fig.62),16 a feature borrowed from avant- garde portraits (see also Wisdom of the earth). Similarly, the smaller drum placed next to the cut, can be recognised in the ear or hair- loop shape of Little French girl. Thus, in my view, the main volume of the Prodigal son is a human face supported on a long neck, while the arched structure in front of it has the appearance of hands raised in prayer. In the Brummer catalogue, Brancusi positioned the sculpture to be seen from its right side (Fig.57),'7 from which the anthropomorphic image is obvious. The strong architectural character of the volumes, espe- cially of the arched hands, suggests that Brancusi was attracted here by the imagery of gateways: as early as 1914 he made the Arch (now in Philadelphia) from salvaged building material."8 Like Prayer, the Prodigal son is a synthesis between one of Rodin's themes and an avant-garde (in this case Cubist) style. From the beginning of his definition of his own style, the artist attempted to present prayer as a rite of passage, employing the architectural metaphor of the gate or porch.19 A pose analogous to that of the '~HULTEN et al., op. cit. at note 8 above, p. 102. date it 1914, whereas the Philadelphia catalogue, cited at note 4 above, gives a date of 1914-15.

The dimensions of the Prodigal son, which is 44.5 cm. high, are also identical or very close to the sculptures in the Pogany series: the marble Muse of 1912 in the Guggenheim Museum is 44.5 cm., the bronze Mademoiselle Pogany in the Museum of Modern Art, New York, is 43.5 cm., and even the studies on paper are similar in size, the overall height of the sheet in Philadelphia being 56.8 cm. (Fig.61), while that in Stuttgart measures 63.5 cm. It is worth noting that the image of joined hands in the form of a vault had been employed by Rodin in 1908 for the sculpture The cathedral (1908, Musee Rodin, Paris),21 and was also used in 1914 for a water-colour portrait of the Cam- bodian dancer, Hanako.22 It is not clear how Brancusi's wooden sculpture acquired its title, or whether it was the one intended by the sculptor himself. In a let- ter of February 1914 to his friend Steichen, Brancusi seems to write about the wooden sculpture Thefirst step (shown in the Photo-Seces- sion Gallery in New York in 1914 and destroyed later, except for the head)2 as being a Prodigal son: 'A propos des titres, je me suis trompe pour le gosse en bois. C'est l'enfant Prodigue qu'il doit s'appeler et celui que je suis en train defaire c'est Premier Pas'." Whatever the case, there is no real relationship between it and Rodin's sculpture which now bears the same name. (It should be noted that Rodin's work had first been called L'Enfant du siecle or Appel suprime and was dubbed by the critics Le guerrier expirant at the Salon d'Automne of 1905.)25 While Rodin shows a desperate man kneeling and brandishing his fists, Brancusi's figure is portrayed in an attitude of prayer. This is not necessarily inconsistent with the title commonly given to it, since the penitent prodigal is frequently depicted in prayer in Christian art.2'' At all events, the sculpture can be seen to be in the spirit of the Romanian artist's education. People close to Brancusi at different periods of his life, such as his doctor and Mrs Sanda Tatarescu-Negroponte, testified to his being a convinced and prac- tising Christian.27 The ascending step-like form of the pedestal sup- ports the symbolism of the sculpture, in a manner analogous to the support for the bronze version of New born (II),28 where the wooden pedestal is sculpted in the form of an open mouth representing a cry. The analogies mentioned above demonstrate the genetic rela- tionship between the Prayer and the Prodigal son, presenting the lat- ter not as a singular and unprecedented work, but as one which grows directly out of Brancusi's early themes.
