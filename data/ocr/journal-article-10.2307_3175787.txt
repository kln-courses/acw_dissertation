<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ann Ch ishol m Acrobats, Contortionists, and Cute Children: The Promise and Perversity of U.S. Women's Gymnastics omen's gymnastics easily has ranked as one of the two most popular U.S. women's sports with respect to media coverage and viewership during the past quarter century. With the exception of women's figure skating, it is the only U.S. women's sport that seems to merit prime-time, network television coverage. TheNew York Times, for example, reported that the 1996 Olympic Trials outdrew the Yankees (Vecsey 1996, B9). Accord- ingly, during the 1996 Summer Olympic Games, the National Broadcast- ing Corporation (NBC) broadcast more than nine and a half hours of the women's gymnastics competition during prime time: this airtime consti- tuted almost two-thirds of the prime-time coverage devoted to all women's sports, and, equally important, it constituted more than a quarter of the total prime-time coverage (nearly thirty-four hours) devoted to all men's and women's competitions combined (Eastman and Billings 1999, 151). Since the early 1970s, U.S. women's gymnastics has flourished in this context and, concurrently, has become a fully realized study in contradiction. Descended both from Western antiquity and from traditions of the min- strelsy, female gymnasts appear in the U.S. media today as acrobatic, con- torted, cute children who finesse the borders between fundamental social binaries: antisocial/social, deviant/normative, infrahuman/superhuman, feminine/masculine, foreign/domestic(ated), child/adult, perversion/nor- malcy, incivility/civility, and disqualified citizen/exemplary citizen. Specifically, as acrobats and aerial women, they represent exemplary citi- zenship and liberal feminism in complex and contradictory ways; as figures of contortion (particularly with regard to their discordantly gendered and sexed bodies), they represent deviations from social convention. United States women gymnasts, therefore, maintain a precarious balance not only between the superhuman and the merely human but also between the su- perhuman and the infrahuman (freakish). In turn, they represent ideal citi- zenship and extraordinary femininity, and thus they enact the promise of modern individualized heroism and empowered femininity, while embod- ying the risk of the uncivilized other (of difference) in our midst. They do [Signs:Journal of Women in Culture and Society 2001, vol. 27, no. 2] ? 2001 by The University of Chicago.

In this regard, what is particularly interesting about U.S. women's gym- nastics, as articulated in recent U.S. media coverage, is the degree to which the manifest promises of the sport - as the veneration of a particular strain of (mass-mediated) femininity and, in Toby Miller's words, as the "celebra- tion of flexibility, strength, and agility" (1997, 4) -function in reciprocal relation to economies of perversity, among which are numbered pedo- philia, incest, and sadism. Consequently, the promises and perversities em- bodied by U.S. women gymnasts are provocative not only because of what they indicate about U.S. women's gymnastics but also because of their im- plications with regard to the fantasies and desires of U.S. viewers. Minstrelsy and the circus: Acrobats and contortionists Gymnastic exercise in Western antiquity was practiced both as a means of training for other sports and as a means for military preparation (Gardiner 1930, 89-92; Scanlon 1984, 19).1 In these capacities, gymnastic exercise eventually was coordinated with Greek education; the law required each free, male citizen to provide his sons with instruction both in gymnastics and in the literary arts and music (Leonard 1973, 1; Zeigler 1973, 113- 14). The state provided gymnasia for these purposes, and, concomitantly, the gymnasium was a vital institution of the Greek polis -one in which young men were trained to embody the virtues of civil society defined in terms of the free, male citizen (Mandell 1984, 61-62; Scanlon 1984, 19). The demise of Western antiquity brought the attenuation of gymnastics as a means of athletic and military training in Western Europe until the eighteenth century, when it was revitalized for these purposes in Germany and Sweden.2 In the interim, however, several elements that are fundamen- 1 Gymnastics as practiced in Western antiquity (and even in the nineteenth century) did not resemble gymnastics as practiced today. Yet, connections among various historical permu- tations of the sport, militarism, and some contemporary practices can be identified. Vaulting, for example, has been linked with military training designed to teach soldiers to mount horses at a run during battle (McIntosh 1957, 50). 2 Most histories of gymnastics mark a break between the systems of Western antiquity and seventeenth-century Swedish and German systems. This is not to say, however, that physical education as a form of military training disappeared or that gymnastics, particularly medical gymnastics (often translated from Greek and Latin texts), vanished, either (McIntosh 1957, 60-80).</page><page sequence="3">S I G N S Winter 2002 I 417 tal to present-day gymnastics were alive and well in practices common to European minstrelsy- practices that also link the circuses of Western an- tiquity with those of the modem circus (Mandell 1984, 117; Guttman 1991, 44). Thus, whereas gymnastic exercise was once an institutionalized means for cultivating the embodiment of national ideals in Western antiq- uity, other precursors of the sport emerged at the margins of culture. What is unusual about women's gymnastics, as a result, is the fact that its histo- ries are entwined not only with disciplined civil and military bodies but also with bodies of the minstrelsy and of the circus -with those of the acrobat, the aerialist, the balancer, and the contortionist. Medieval minstrels traveled from tavern to tavern, from celebration to celebration, from town to town. They sang ballads, danced, told stories, juggled, performed stunts with trained animals, conjured magical illusions, executed feats of agility on raised bars and ropes, and tumbled. Associated with nomadism and with the tavern, these jugglers and tumblers were not regarded as members of civil society and often were considered to embody all vices (Duncan 1907, 47-68; Croft-Cooke and Cotes 1975, 28). Fur- thermore, their uncommon and peculiar physical performances of acro- batics and balance, in conjunction with their role as featured attractions during the folly and inversions of festivals and carnivals, defined these entertainers as deviant bodies that suspended social norms. Yet, minstrels often traveled to the centers of communities, performing in the town square and at court. In much the same way that the circus brought exotic animals and performers from the edges of empires to their centers, the minstrelsy was a fundamental site for the cultural negotiation of liminal bodies. The embodiment and performance of liminal difference in this context not only positioned minstrels as alien and exotic sites of fascination but also precipitated their domestication (McIntosh 1957, 69; Croft-Cooke and Cotes 1975, 7-8). The women who numbered among the minstrels were referred to, vari- ously, as Gligmeden (glee-maiden), Jengleresse, Joculatrix, Ministralissa, and femina Ministerialis (Duncan 1907, 78). Female minstrels, then, were also figures of both transgression and fascination: they were nomadic women roaming the margins of culture and appearing periodically at its center (on the village green, at the village festival, at court, etc.) as spec- tacles for enjoyment. There, they not only would dance and entertain but also would astound their audiences by performing acrobatics and feats of balance. Unquestionably, even as they staged liminal difference, it was pre- cisely because of their extraordinary physical exploits that these figures were distinguished as figures of desire and retained at court. Medieval tales</page><page sequence="4">418 I Chisolm of tumblers who became divine and of female minstrels who became queens, in turn, mythically transformed and valorized the minstrelsy in relation to essential cultural institutions (Duncan 1907, 37-38). Constructed as avatars of domesticated transgression, minstrels incar- nated at the nucleus of society that which they had constituted through opposition from the outside: tensions between the profane and the sacred, between deviance and the norm, and between the antisocial and the social. As I continue, I will demonstrate that, like the minstrel and the circus per- former, U.S. gymnasts performing mass-mediated feats of acrobatics and balance are coded as limit figures straddling the borders between funda- mentally opposed social binaries. Acrobatics and maiden flights Acrobatic skills have been integrated formally into international judging requirements for performances on every women's apparatus since the 1972 Olympics. At that event, Olga Korbut introduced elements of acrobatics and balance that fundamentally changed the conventions of women's gym- nastics, that popularized the sport in the United States, and that made covering this Olympic sport a lucrative proposition for U.S. television net- works and advertisers. Of note at that moment were the calls, issued within the gymnastics community, to ban Korbut's maneuvers because they were considered dangerous and reminiscent of circus stunts. Derived from the Greek prefix acro-, meaning peak or summit, the term acrobatics refers to bodies that leave the earth, that master gravity and cen- trifugal force, and that seemingly defy natural laws. Images of these spin- ning and twisting bodies are striking in that they appear to carve out and to move within spaces beyond the reach of ordinary human bodies - they are a testament not to strength per se but rather to a mastery of timing and space. By extending the limits in which human bodies are perceived to function and move, acrobats offer physical proof of their superior physical training and of their bravery; by surpassing what seem to be human physi- cal limitations in their performances of phenomenal aerial maneuvers, they appear to be superhuman. Therefore, to the extent that gymnasts potentially enact both human superiority and superhumanity through their performances, both the rec- ognition and the suppression of their extensive physical training are crucial to the appeal of female gymnasts (Bouissac 1976, 47). Thus, while tele- vised "background" segments are constructed to depict female gymnasts subjecting their bodies to grueling practice sessions, training devices such as wrist straps for the uneven parallel bars and rotator belts attached to cables are rarely, if ever, represented. Furthermore, even though visible</page><page sequence="5">S I G N S Winter 2002 I 419 effort is permissible in the context of practice, it is to be effaced in most aspects of actual competition. United States women's gymnastics expressly encourages effortless, fluid performances through its emphasis on grace and, consequently, through penalties imposed on gymnasts who pause too long before each "trick" in their routines.3 Thus, as depicted in the U.S. media, the seemingly effortless acrobatic, aerial performances of these "pix- ies" are not merely awe inspiring but also seem to possess a magic of sorts. Through acrobatics, women's gymnastics draws heavily on the U.S. ro- mance with flight, a locus of empowerment in terms of U.S. citizenship (as illustrated by the Wright brothers, by Charles Lindbergh, by Neil Arm- strong, by the Apollo space programs, etc.). Facilitated and influenced by technological advance, the aerial is emblematic of the courage and heroic individualism underwriting successful flights evidencing freedom, human achievement, and upward mobility (Russo 1995, 11, 25). The aerial, ac- cordingly, comprises the thrill of modern adventure, risk, and reward. Commensurate with this logic, Mary Russo suggests that aerial fantasy has fostered a sense of "bourgeois exceptionalism" within its narrative of modern progress and transcendence, a narrative that potentially "leaves bodies behind" including bodies evidencing "signs of non-Anglo-Saxon ethnicity" (1995, 11, 26). Accordingly, narratives of early Western flight generated associations not only with individual excellence and virtuosity but also with national, racial, and military elitism, particularly in the impe- rial contexts in which flight emerged (Whol 1994, 88-89, 97, 121, 270). Thus, among the earliest "dominant images of the [Western] aviator," Robert Whol catalogs "the ingenious inventor, the daring sportsman, the Nietzschean superman, [and] the courageous soldier and imperialist" (1994,279). To put it simply, flight promised to christen a new elite, supe- rior men with unlimited potential equipped to conquer fear, nature, other nations, and inferior (often non-Western, non-Anglo) peoples (1994, 117, 121, 257). Both world wars brought these myths to fruition; these myths, in turn, have permeated subsequent U.S. conceptions of flight in both mili- tary and nonmilitary circumstances. Consider, for a moment, Charles Lind- bergh, the record-breaking pioneer, the national hero turned military pilot, the admirer of Hitler's air force, the Nazi sympathizer and eugenics aficio- nado. His autobiography includes a telling racist passage about an "old negro" who, after admiring one of Lindbergh's flights (from a "respectful 3 The 1994 Code of Points lists "concentration pauses" among the "specific apparatus de- ductions" for balance beam and floor exercise routines (International Gymnastics Federation 106, 172). Similarly, the code lists "concentration pauses" among the behaviors that are "to be avoided" on the uneven parallel bars (44).</page><page sequence="6">420 I Chisolm distance") and after failing to understand that Lindbergh indeed had not flown as high as he might have, exclaimed "boss, you was so-o high. Ah could jist see you. You looked like a bird up thar ... Ah'm sho' glad ah come out here to see you, Boss. Yes suh" (1981, 439-41). Ponder also the well-documented racism and sexism of the U.S. Air Force, the U.S. space program, and the U.S. commercial airline industry.4 Essentially, then, in the very same moments that U.S. flight came to signify individual and national superiority, advancement, and achievement, institutionalized piloting and conceptions of flight were restricted and coded along the lines of race and sex. This was particularly the case with the emerging U.S. commercial air- lines, which supplemented (male) pilots with (female) "hostesses" (Ware 1993, 73; Bilstein 1994, 102). In spite of marked gendered differences between their duties and employment regulations, the first pilots and stewardesses were viewed as "Flying Supermen and Superwomen" (Ware 1993, 74-75). Early U.S. airlines required those (white) women to be young (under the age of twenty-five), to be unmarried, to be small (maxi- mum height and weight 5'4" and 120 lbs. [Ware 1993, 74]), to be physi- cally fit, and to epitomize the well-bred American (Bilstein 1994, 102). In conjunction with the classist prerequisite that stewardesses embody good breeding, the notion that pilots were also physically fit and well-bred led to speculation that marriages between the two literally would effectuate good breeding and "produce a race of superior Americans" (Bilstein 1994, 102) (although, as a practical matter, such marriages- or any other for that matter -would have prevented stewardesses from continuing to fly). As an acrobatic, aerial woman, the female gymnast carves out and moves into spaces above and beyond those inhabited and traversed by other, less exceptional, bodies. Consequently, she appears to be an empow- ered, extraordinary agent of her gender enacting a particular set of national ideals historically permeated by codes of race and class. (In fact, the most advanced division of competition in U.S. women's gymnastics is desig- nated as the "elite" class.) Encouraged as well by the code of points to per- form innovative maneuvers and, in turn, surpassing conventional expecta- tions while executing such miraculous tricks, her spinning and twisting body seemingly is freed from physical law and cultural restriction. In this regard, female gymnasts are most reminiscent of the nation's best-known woman flier and, as Susan Ware reminds us, "practically the only one remembered today," Amelia Earhart (1993, 58). Earhart-the 4 See, e.g., Ware 1993, 61-62, 74-78, 87-88, 248; Bilstein 1994, 101-3, 138; Penley 1997, 53-58.</page><page sequence="7">S I G N S Winter 2002 1 421 female counterpart to Charles Lindbergh, the boyish "Lady Lindy," "Lind- bergh's double," "who looked more like Lindbergh than Lindbergh him- self' (quoted in Ware 1993, 16-21)--was the first woman to cross the Atlantic, initially as a passenger and then as a solo pilot.5 While Earhart continued to enter races and to set flying records, she sold her image as a heroic and adventurous aviator for commercial use in order to support herself and to finance these pursuits (1993, 92). Concurrently, she self- consciously countered the presumption that women were physically ill- suited for flight (due to menstruation and lack of physical strength) and that they were temperamentally deficient as well (due to nerves and emo- tional instability) -presumptions that, as Constance Penley (1997, 39-40, 55-59) and Sarah Projansky (1998, 775-76, 778-83, 788) have argued, still endure.6 Earhart further characterized her aerial accomplishments as demonstrations of women's abilities and potential, as proof that women could venture into uncharted territory, create public careers for themselves, and perform as well as men in all domains of modern life (Ware 1993, 123). Accordingly, Earhart became a member of several women's organiza- tions devoted to women's professional and social advancement, including the National Women's Party (1993, 123). The latter, in turn, used Earhart to champion the Equal Rights Amendment, which she endorsed in oppo- sition to sex-specific, protective legislation for working women. For these reasons, Ware (1993, 24-25, 129-44) argues that Earhart promoted and represented a version of liberal feminism: one that assumed prejudices and barriers would evaporate once women crossed boundaries into new realms and proved they could perform as well as men; one that emphasized the extraordinary, inspirational, individual achievements of women who served as examples that women could do so; one that, in the words of Nancy Cott, "urged women to disregard sex" (1987, 276) by promising that equal opportunity and equal rewards in the public sphere would result from such acts of individual accomplishment (which were replete with U.S. liberal values of individualism, self-reliance, and self-determination); one that, like U.S. flight, was coded in terms of race and class in the sense that it gave little attention to non-Anglo and lower-class concerns.7 5 See also Ware 1993, 24-25, 38, 56, 92, 123-24; and Bilstein 1994, 76-84. 6 See also Ware 1993, 44, 78; Bilstein 1994, 76; and Whol 1994, 279-80. 7 Russo has described the aerial woman as an emblem of liberal feminism and as "a vastly over-produced Modernist image of women's liberation" (1995, 25). Ware's descriptions and assessments of liberal feminism closely resemble those found in Cott 1987, 4-5, 267, 275- 76. Penley 1997 (39-40) also discusses Earhart's relationship to liberal feminism in similar terms. Accordingly, gender differences are stressed in my analysis. Nevertheless, as indicated later in this article and as delineated more fully elsewhere, differences of race and class (in</page><page sequence="8">422 I Chisolm After delineating both the merits and the disadvantages of Earhart's status, Ware discusses the inability of U.S. popular culture to popularize larger-than-life models of exceptional female achievement and argues that "a whole generation of popular heroines is missing" (1993, 233-38). Yet, she does indicate that, since the 1970s, a few sportswomen ("mainly tennis players") have achieved that status (237). In turn, I maintain that, during the same time span, female gymnasts have performed this function for many Americans (particularly young girls) - albeit in complicated and con- tradictory ways. The fact that they have done so, in large part on the basis of their extraordinary acrobatic and aerial feats, further aligns them with icons of liberal feminism such as Earhart, insofar as their aerial flights liter- ally enact a sense of freedom (from physical law and human physical limita- tion) and upward mobility on the public stage, insofar as they demonstrate the abilities and potential of superior bodies and thus offer material evi- dence that women can venture into uncharted territory, insofar as they serve as examples of exceptional individual achievement and of U.S. liberal ideals (Russo 1995, 25).8 Thus situated at the nexus between U.S. codes of flight and liberal femi- nism, recent U.S. women's gymnastics seems to have fostered a particular notion of femininity that is emblematic of class (bourgeois), race (Anglo- Saxon), and nation (United States) (Russo 1995, 25). Yet, as indicated pre- viously, aerial acts (and, in particular, those penetrations of the unknown deemed "maiden flights") often are coded in the United States as acts of virility. Indeed, Whol has noted that "one cannot help but be struck with the absence of women as protagonists of flight" (1994, 279) in Western cul- ture. For acrobatic, aerial female gymnasts, therefore, the embodied per- formance of extraordinary femininity, individual achievement, liberation, upward mobility, and exemplary citizenship is necessarily complex and contradictory.9 Let us begin to investigate these contradictions by considering the well- known observation that women's gymnastics requires sleek, aerodynamic bodies. Gymnasts often are concerned with their "lines." Accordingly, competition uniforms often enhance the aerodynamic appearance of their bodies. Many of these leotards incorporate stripes that run up the side of particular) also are recuperated in the narratives of adoption that construct the nation's rela- tion to these acrobatic, contorted, cute children (Chisholm 1999, 132-38). 8 In both team and individual competitions, competitors perform individually, earn indi- vidual scores, etc. 9 Russo writes that, although the aerial woman is a figure of women's liberation, "the high flying female body in space is not simply a thrilling and emancipatory icon, an instance of the gendered sublime, of progress, of modernity, and freedom" (1995, 24-25; emphasis added).</page><page sequence="9">S I G N S Winter 2002 1 423 the body and under the arms, V-shaped wedges that emphasize the shoul- ders and deemphasize the hips, and stripes that cut across the hips on an inward diagonal. Here, in the realm of physical discipline and aerial weightlessness, recent U.S. women's gymnastics and eating disorders seem to have merged seamlessly at the precise moment wherein empowered, aerial femininity hinges on the conventionally masculine (V-shaped or wedgelike) body type.10 In one noteworthy U.S. commercial manifestation of athletic equality for women, for example, the first body of an athletic hero- ine represented on Wheaties cereal boxes was that of Mary Lou Retton. This image of Retton echoed the ubiquitous televised footage and published photographs capturing the moment she successfully landed the 1984 Olympic vault that secured the first all-around U.S. gold medal in gymnas- tics history. In all of these images, the signs of Retton's victory and of the nation's are reflected in, and are attributable to, the aerodynamic, mascu- line, wedgelike contour of her body. Those images, depicting a triumphant female athlete making national history, are constituted by the short-haired, impish Retton extending her arms victoriously overhead in the shape of a V That V is reiterated by the shape of Retton's bullet-like, slim-hipped body and is invoked further by the design of her leotard, on which the stars and stripes of the American flag meet to form a V just above her left hip. Thus, the acrobatic and aerial body that had gone where no American woman's had gone before - with respect to both the gold-medal Olympic awards podium for women gymnasts and the front of Wheaties boxes-- was more like a boy's than a woman's (or even a girl's). As this example demonstrates, U.S. women's gymnastics is a sport in which the quest for physical superiority, extraordinary femininity, individ- ual achievement, upward mobility, and exemplary citizenship seems to en- tail transcending the supposed material limits of one body in particular- that of the female. Consequently, many of the acrobatic and aerial feats performed by female gymnasts are maiden flights into uncharted territory actually performed by young girls whose bodies appear to be those of boys. 10 Russo establishes a foundation for this type of inquiry when she discusses the relation between the aerial woman and the consequent jettisoning of what Susan Bordo has deemed "unbearable weight" (1995, 23-25). Along these lines, the disciplinary imperatives of wom- en's gymnastics are often linked with eating disorders among female gymnasts. There has been little discussion, however, of similarities between the (nearly identical) ideologies of eating disorders and of gymnastics. In this vein, both ideologies are predicated on an empow- ered femininity that repudiates female sex organs linked with reproduction, a desire for mas- culine empowerment, etc. (Bordo 1993, 154-57, 171-74, 204-12). Furthermore, eating disorders can be linked with subsequent moments in this study, moments in which physical control and transcendence are at issue, moments in which the female gymnast embodies and enacts physical contortion as well as physical and mental instability, etc.</page><page sequence="10">424 I Chisolm Moreover, because the sleek and supple body of the aerial woman is "different from her own femininity" and is associated with a "dangerous virility," Russo suggests that she also is subjected to compensatory normal- ization as a "safe woman" (1995, 29, 44). In other words, in much the same way that the (racist and classist) presumptions about the physical and social superiority of early airline stewardesses were tempered by the belief that their "homemaking instincts" made them uniquely qualified to soothe and comfort passengers rather than to pilot planes - in much the same way that Earhart often combined icons of masculinity (i.e., comparisons with Lindbergh, aviator caps and goggles, military wings, jodhpurs) with those of femininity (i.e., pearls, silk scarves, flowers) -members of the 1996 U.S. Olympic women's gymnastics team are acrobats who also are cast as "little angels" by the U.S. media. Women's gymnastics, accordingly, does not erase femininity completely by any means. Rather, it at once rescinds and reasserts femininity provisionally. Thus, it has fostered figures that ap- pear to be androgynous yet coated with a thin veneer of femininity. But, before we pursue this logic further, let us continue to explore the links between these relatively recent constructions of U.S. women's gymnastics, the minstrel, and the circus. Balancing contorted bodies Acrobats in the minstrelsy and in the circus were identified not only with the aerial but also with the art of balance. Indeed, the aerial depends upon balance. Balance, in turn, is often a component of contortion. Conse- quently, both in the circus and in women's gymnastics today, balance not only negotiates the superhuman and the merely human, it also links (al- ready ambivalent) acrobatic and aerial, superhuman female bodies to the infrahuman (Bouissac 1976, 47-49).11 In gymnastics, the aerial necessitates balance to the extent that the suc- cessful acrobat must ultimately maintain his or her equilibrium while fi- nessing gravitational force. The ability to do so, and the possibility of not doing so, is what constitutes the skill and the risk of the performance. Gymnastics routines, therefore, are ritualized exercises of (calculated) dis- turbance and self-control (Bouissac 1976, 34-37). In this sense, "sticking a landing" provides proof that balance has been achieved and that the over- all skill has been performed correctly. Landing without a step backward or a hop forward also is significant insofar as the human body, momentarily 11 Likewise, Russo suggests a second, doubled (uncanny) manifestation of female aeri- alism, that of grotesque performance (Russo 1983, 40-41).</page><page sequence="11">S I G N S Winter 2002 I 425 the body of possible "fault" and disaster, is reconstituted as superior and superhuman. Through such demonstrations of balance, potentially vulner- able bodies (particularly the fractured, sprained, taped bodies of female gymnasts) demonstrate far more power and nerve than viewers might expect. Balance, then, seems to mark the boundary between the superior or superhuman and the merely human. Following this logic, television com- mentators for U.S. women's gymnastics are obsessed with the sometimes imperceptible "balance check," with the step or "hop" on the landing, and with the "fault.'12 One of the favored mantras whispered breathlessly by Olympic announcers for U.S. audiences in 1996, "remember, the balance beam is four feet high and four inches wide," also underscores these stakes. In like manner, graphic, slow-motion replays of disequilibrium often are used to introduce subsequent performances. As Margaret Morse has argued, slow-motion replay not only conveys a sense of "the fantasy of the body as a perfect machine with the aura of the divine" but also imparts "an aura of scientificity" (1983, 56). In the case of U.S. women's gymnastics coverage, this scientific scrutiny often is deployed to locate the physical errors resulting in disequilibrium (or other, often related, scoring deduc- tions). Slow-motion close-ups of gymnast's hands and feet working the balance beam and uneven parallel bars, therefore, not only emphasize the necessary split-second timing and precision of gymnastic performances but also identify those moments when minute miscalculations result in what commentators call "disasters" (falls). Concomitantly, the use of slow- motion replay and the emphasis on human risk both highlight the thrill of the superhuman and provide consoling reminders of the merely human as well. That the desire to witness the latter has been coded into recent Olympic coverage cannot be denied. For instance, until only recently, women's Olympic gymnastics competitions included a compulsory round in which all gymnasts performed identical sets of predesignated movements on each apparatus. Likewise, from the team competition through the all-around competition, to the individual events competitions, gymnasts who earn the right to advance typically repeat their individually designed optional performances three times on each apparatus. These performances, not co- incidentally, are deemed "routines" both by gymnasts and by U.S. media 12 The 1994 Code of Points identifies a range of technical faults and penalties for "loss of balance on landing of elements and dismounts." Among such faults are the following: "slight hop, unsureness"; one, two, or three steps; "fall on one or both hands, knees, hops, or against apparatus"; "additional movements to maintain balance" (International Gymnastics Federa- tion 1994, 22).</page><page sequence="12">426 I Chisolm commentators. The repetition of these "routines" diffuses the novelty of innovative, seemingly superhuman elements (which are also deemed "skills"). Repetition, concurrently, increases the chances that a mistake will occur (at least to the degree that gravity is bound to triumph occasionally). It heightens the import of flaws -which replace innovation as the impor- tant news reported to U.S. fans (either in the same meet or between differ- ent meets).'3 Therefore, U.S. commentators spend a good deal of time familiarizing audiences with possible scoring deductions. U.S. audiences, in turn, can- not help but watch a televised gymnastic competition without the height- ened awareness that a waver during a handstand on the uneven bars, a flinch on the balance beam, a heel touching the white line surrounding the floor exercise mat, and so on will result in competition-compromising deductions. Accordingly, the "perfect" routine in competition is somewhat rare, achieved only in the absence of disequilibrium and a variety of related "faults." United States women's gymnastics, in turn, is a sport in which positive results are rendered largely in terms of an omnipresent central neg- ative, in which the highest scores are the relatively rare effect of a lack of almost inevitable deductions, in which the superhuman results from the erasure of virtually inescapable human flaws. In U.S. women's gymnastics, balance not only distinguishes the body of ultimate control, it also positions the body of ultimate contortion. Thus, Korbut introduced not only the back flip to the balance beam but also the handstand maneuver in which she lowered her chest onto the beam while arching her back and holding her legs backward over her head (in the end, her chin and chest were braced lengthwise against the beam as she fixed her eyes on the tips of her toes). A more recent variation on this pose, the reverseplanche, is performed across the width, not the length, of the beam. The gymnast performing this element holds a handstand across the beam and lowers each leg into a straddle that creates a horizontal line running parallel to the beam. She then arches her back in such a way that she dis- places her hips, moving her straddled legs over the back of her head and suspending them in the air about six inches away from the beam. Gymnas- tics elements such as these, which combine balance, strength, and unu- sual performances of extreme flexibility, are not uncommon in women's gymnastics. Both the acrobat and the contortionist involve serious risk in that they 13 According to the Table for General Faults, the gymnast must avoid fifty-five possible faults that will result in a deduction of her score (International Gymnastics Federation 1994, 22-25).</page><page sequence="13">S I G N S Winter 2002 I 427 embody, according to Paul Bouissac, a "difference from the accepted norm" (1976, 46). As an irregular, distorted (and even bizarre) transmuta- tion of the body, however, contortion poses a serious risk civically in that it does not manifest transcendence or progress but rather deviates from social conventions and standards of comportment. Thus, throughout the histories of Western culture, the bodies of contortionists often have been represented as raced, exotic, perversely sexual, dehumanized figures. Likewise, in the case of U.S. women's gymnastics, aerial female bodies assuming contorted positions already are perceived as contortions in and of themselves. Even as they strain to recuperate femininity, they achieve, at best, a precarious balance: although many achieve a form of borderline femininity, androgyny remains. For example, a close look at most female gymnasts arching their backs either in flight or after they land their dis- mounts usually reveals only one protrusion in their upper torsos, that of the lower rib cage, not of the breasts. This protrusion often is thrown into vivid relief by a female gymnast's concave lower torso, by a hollow at the site where reproductive organs typically are housed.14 Consequently, the body that is celebrated in flight and at the completion of every routine is a female body in which indicators of reproduction are erased. Acrobatic, ae- rial female gymnasts, therefore, do not leave the abject behind absolutely. In contemporary U.S. women's gymnastics, then, the "sleek transcen- dent, spectacularized bodies" (1995, 15) that Russo views as "model[ing] ideals of progress and liberation" (23) are linked inextricably with contor- tion, androgyny, and deterioration. United States women's gymnastics, it seems, fosters a variety of female exceptionalism that has been achieved most often by midget-like, contorted creatures. The latter, in Bouissac's words, are situated at the furthest reach of "negative biological discontinu- ity" (1976, 49) -in the realm of the sideshow freak and the infrahuman. The bodies of acrobatic and aerial women, in turn, are represented as chronically damaged and internally disfigured (by tendinitis, Osgood- Schlatter disease, stress fractures, compressed vertebrae, etc.). Moreover, the narratives that link technology with the strengthening of these bodies and with their transcendent aerialism have a complementary manifesta- tion: these same bodies are described by commentators as containing "screws [that] adhere the heel back to the bone," "a miniscus implant in her knee," and so forth. These bodies, bodies transgressing boundaries of 14 Reports that many competitive female gymnasts in the United States do not menstruate reinforce the perceived absence of organs marking sex. These reports have been buttressed by medical studies and by exposes on women's gymnastics (Blimke, Chilibeck, and Davidson 1988, 87-88; Ryan 1995, 9). Accurate or not, because of their subject matter, such rumors have not been refuted by mainstream U.S. media.</page><page sequence="14">428 I Chisolm human physical capability, of gender, and even of sex, have an almost Fran- kenstein-like quality. These are not bodies that enact aerial fantasies--of white, bourgeois exceptionalism, of citizenship, and, concurrently, of extraordinary feminin- ity-in uncomplicated ways. Thus, in mobilizing the aerial, these female bodies interrupt and refigure it. These bodies, then, seem to destabilize not only sex and gender but also all that the aerial woman might have guaranteed. Cute gymnasts and conflicting desires When U.S. women's gymnastics incorporated acrobatics, the androgynous (albeit slightly feminized), contorted, dwarfed female gymnast appeared. As a consequence, during the past quarter century, U.S. women gymnasts have been associated with the infrahuman and the "freakish" (Seabrook 1998a, 39). In this context, the figure of the cute child has come to the fore, functioning as a means to embody and to offset the risks incarnated by these acrobatic and contorted female bodies. Cuteness, according to Lori Merrish, "is a historically, as well as nation- ally, specific aesthetic [that] . . . appears to have emerged as a distinct cul- tural style in late 19th century America" (1996, 187). Associated with the physical attributes of human children, cuteness often is linked with the mimicry of adult behavior, with miniatureness, as well as with preco- ciousness and prodigiousness (Merrish 1996, 187; Morreall 1991, 283). Performances of cuteness, which are spectacles in and of themselves, en- hance and embellish the spectacular maneuvers executed by acrobatic fe- male gymnasts. Such aerial feats appear to be even more extraordinary, dar- ing, and magical when performed by cute, prodigious children. Cuteness, however, does not function merely to intensify the effects of the acrobat per se. Because cuteness ultimately is a "feminine cultural style," it serves as a primer for the supplementary, compensatory, and (more or less) "safe" feminine veneer required of the aerial woman (Merrish 1996, 188, 195). At the same time, cuteness functions in U.S. women's gymnas- tics as a form of "apologetic behavior," a phrase that Jan Felshin coined while describing conduct that functions to signal compliance with--and to minimize transgressions of- (gendered) social norms in sport (Felshin 1974, 36-40; Festle 1996, 45). Such behavior, Mary Jo Festle argues, has traditionally been required of U.S. women who excel in sport because fe- male athletes are often considered gendered oxymorons and thus stigma- tized as abnormal women (1996, 45-51, 67-70, 265-67, 284-85, 289). In many ways, U.S. women's gymnastics, descended from eighteenth- and</page><page sequence="15">S I G N S Winter 2002 I 429 nineteenth-century versions of the sport that ostensibly were designed to address perceived physical and emotional needs (and deficiencies) of women, functioned apologetically at the outset (1996, 289).15 Neverthe- less, although the historical goal of U.S. women's gymnastics essentially has been that of refining feminine comportment, the acrobatic turn taken by the sport during the 1970s introduced a fundamental contradiction be- tween that historical impulse and the masculine connotations associated with aerialism, with boylike (rather than womanly) bodies, and with the increased muscularity that was necessary to excel in the sport. Thus, while raising the stakes in these ways, the sport also has, in the words of Festle, "bent over backward to display perfect (modest, feminine, nice) behavior" (xxii) by incorporating cuteness. In U.S. women's gymnastics, then, cuteness offsets masculinity while it constitutes a modernist image of women's liberation that is dependent on tiny bodies, lilliputian features, ponytails, ribbons, and so forth. Equally important, cuteness also recodes the contorted, apparently desexed bodies of acrobatic, aerial female gymnasts. As a result, resonances of androgyny are tempered by associations with prepubescence and childhood, even among female gymnasts who are approaching twenty years of age. Hence, cuteness embodies the gymnast's physical and performative deviations from norms of gender and sex yet concurrently functions to minimize and to contain these transgressions of social boundaries as well. Overall, then, cuteness incorporates androgynous, dwarfed, and con- torted bodies (markers of the transgressive and the infrahuman), while also constructing acrobatic, aerial female gymnasts as (relatively) unobjection- able and unthreatening figures sugarcoated with a glaze of agreed-upon femininity--as cute little girls. Cuteness thus establishes the terms of its own domestication and of viewers' conflicting desires as it both desexual- izes and feminizes its participants. Cute children: Made in America Congruent with one commentator's thesis that "the hard work and disci- pline which has been cultivated in their gymnastics training has transferred to other areas of their lives," U.S. media coverage has underscored the 1996 U.S. Olympic team members' impressive contributions to national life (ESPN 1997). Members of the 1996 women's team--the first U.S. gymnastics team to win an Olympic gold medal, viewers often are re- minded--have done more than merely amend the national history of 15 See also Todd 1998, 88-170. While early U.S. gymnastics regimes for women often were gendered in this fashion, many also were complex and contradictory.</page><page sequence="16">430 I Chisolm sport. They also have made noteworthy cultural contributions to classical music (Amy Chow), to Broadway musicals and music videos (Dominique Dawes), to television (Kerri Strug), and so on. Furthermore, biology and business stand to benefit from their brainpower as well (Chow and Shan- non Miller). These young girls, consequently, have been positioned as model citizens and as the inspiration to future U.S. female gymnasts. Their contributions along these lines have been linked inextricably to their mar- ketability: they have functioned as emblems for their parents' gymnasiums (Dominique Moceanu), for their hometowns (a street has been named for Jaycee Phelps), for their home states (Shannon Miller has been named "Oklahoman of the Year"), and for U.S. gymnastics writ large. Accord- ingly, members of the 1996 U.S. Olympic women's gymnastics team have been described in television specials as "ordinary kids and young women with extraordinary talent" (ESPN 1997). Their cuteness, in turn, serves to amplify the prodigiousness not only of their physical accomplishments but also of the contributions they have made to national life. As proclaimed by "The Magnificent Seven: Made in America" (ESPN 1997), the title for a television special promoting the U.S. women's gymnastics team as "the face of America," such magnificent, prodigious, cute children could only have been "made in America" as the result of heterosexual reproduction on U.S. soil (and, as we shall see, as commodities marketed primarily via their cuteness). Nevertheless, Merrish writes that the child has long functioned not only as "the privileged locus for the transmission of culture" but also as "the ('uncivilized') Other in ... culture's midst" (1996, 187-88). Accordingly, she suggests that cuteness is a "strategy for domesticating (the) Otherness (of'freak' of child)" (187-88).16 Children, therefore, embody not only the future of the social but also the risks of the antisocial. Crucial in this context is the fact that cuteness functions to mediate such anxieties publicly and collectively according to the private, intimate logic of family (Merrish 1996, 187).17 John Morreall writes that cute, attractive, childlike features (and I would submit behaviors deemed cute as well) have a distinct function -that of "elicit(ing) nurturing behavior" (1991, 284- 85). The cute child, in other words, invites us to assume a parental role. Thus, the attractiveness, allure, and desirability of cuteness is demonstrated 16 Lauren Berlant has discussed U.S. anxieties regarding child immigrants along similar lines (1996, 413-15, 422). Other scholars have discussed a more generalized, but closely related, desire to construct (seemingly innocent and appealing) children as monstrous, anti- social figures. See, e.g., Warner 1994, 43-63; and Kincaid 1998, 140-64. 17 Accordingly, in the United States, we see links forged between children and the politics of family values. See, e.g., Berlant 1996; and Jenkins 1998, 10-11.</page><page sequence="17">S I G N S Winter 2002 I 431 when it invokes responses of affection, embrace, and adoption (Morreall 1991, 284-85; Merrish 1996, 186-87). Constructed within this socially coded dynamic, cuteness negotiates differences beyond those signaled by the binaries child/adult, immature/ mature, and so forth in the most unthreatening and appealing of terms.'8 Racial and cultural difference, for example, frequently are mediated by im- ages of cute children representing different races playing together. The cute functions in these contexts by inviting the inference of a common preso- cial, predivisive, childlike innocence. At this level, human nature is seen to clean the social slate. Therefore, as witnessed by the attractiveness of the cute child and by appropriate responses to it (affection and embrace), the cute child is positioned as a member of a human family that transcends race or nation. Cuteness, however, does not signal the nonexistence of difference; rather, it indicates that difference is subsumed by an appropriative, adop- tive desire emanating from the supposedly mature (socialized, civil) subjec- tivity that defines the parameters of cuteness in the first place. Concur- rently, the cute child is subjected to (re)socialization by families that deem it cute--particularly insofar as its presumed lack of social subjectivity makes it a perfect repository for such projections (Merrish 1996, 186). Cuteness, then, serves as compelling proof of unthreatening, indeed plea- surable, assimilability. In this vein, members of the 1996 U.S. Olympic women's gymnastics team routinely have been portrayed in terms of their adoptability. This dynamic is apparent when these world-class international athletes are con- structed and contextualized as children in terms of their parents and, even more clearly, in terms of their coaches. Nevertheless, U.S. television com- mentary often reveals that female gymnasts, in order to train, do not actu- ally live with their parents. The gymnast, therefore, is revealed to be a child who is removed from life as traditionally conceived for U.S. teenage girls (e.g., no movies, no pizza, no football games, etc.) and who is separated from her (very supportive) family. Her adoptability is established clearly when U.S. media representations characterize her coaches as surrogate par- ents. In many cases, U.S. gymnasts themselves have described their coaches as parental figures. United States television coverage supports this percep- tion further by devoting far more screen time to female gymnasts' coaches 18 Initially, I tendered these claims as extensions of Merrish's and Morreall's scholarship concerning cuteness. Henry Jenkins subsequently advanced similar arguments in his intro- duction to The Children's Culture Reader (1998, 1-37). His arguments support not only Mer- rish's and Morreall's conclusions but also my own.</page><page sequence="18">432 I Chisolm than to their parents, who very rarely are depicted in proximity to their children. Moreover, during such televised interactions between the U.S. gymnast and her coach, the coach often exhibits parental behaviors. Along these lines, viewers frequently witness the coach hugging the gymnast, call- ing her "baby," kneeling down to squeeze her shoulders with pride, gently instructing her to "wave to the people," and so forth. Accordingly, televised U.S. coverage of the 1996 women's Olympic gymnastics competition highlighted the parental responses of two coaches in particular -Bela Karolyi and Steve Nunno. The large percentage of air- time devoted to these coaches is noteworthy both because Karolyi and Nunno were not U.S. team coaches and because they were separated from the competition platform in the Olympic gymnastics arena by a barricade. This marked a not atypical emphasis on the personalities of male coaches, as opposed to those of the two women who were in fact the official coaches for the U.S. team, and constructed cute gymnasts as "daddy's girls" (Ryan 1995, 68).19 Viewers, in turn, have been invited to assume the role of the relatively absent maternal figure.20 The figure of Karolyi, the most successful women's gymnastics coach in U.S. history, requires a moment of our undivided attention. In spite of reported tension between the U.S. Gymnastics Federation and Karolyi, his public performances (and successes) as a coach have resulted in his enor- mous influence on media constructions of women's gymnastics in the United States. This large, grizzly, exuberant, Geppetto-like figure is tele- vised most frequently expressing enthusiasm and affection for his prote- gees. Famous for what commentators refer to as his "bear hugs" and for lifting victorious gymnasts over his head after they have performed well, Karolyi produced the first (and, for almost a decade afterward, the only) U.S. victories in international women's competitions. Furthermore, he pio- neered the public display of parental affection--executed, unfailingly, within the range of a cued television camera. 19 Similarly, Susan Cahn has written that "these teenage 'pixies' were typically coached by middle-aged adult men who combined the roles of surrogate parent and stem taskmaster" (1994, 275). 20 Although there have been female coaches in the sport, male coaches historically have been far more prominent. Furthermore, until very recently, many of those female coaches have been married and subordinated to their more visible male coaching partners. Within the last three years, however, media coverage has featured female coaches to a far greater degree. I suspect that because maternal precedent has been set with regard to U.S. media construc- tions of spectatorship thus far, because female coaches often are depicted as maternal figures, and because cuteness invokes a maternal response, viewers will be encouraged to identify with these female figures.</page><page sequence="19">S I G N S Winter 2002 I 433 The consequent impression that cute gymnasts have melted the heart of this large, gruff-looking man reinforces impressions of their cuteness. Kar- olyi uses this relational dynamic as a means of aggressively and successfully marketing his gymnasts (and himself) to international judges, to television audiences, and to potential sponsors. Cuteness, accordingly, has become a means to commodify acrobatic female gymnasts who are "made in America" not only by establishing their adoptability (and desirability) but also by inspiring complementary proprietary desires (Merrish 1996, 186- 88, 195-96). The adoptability of the female gymnast, therefore, is not limited to her (mass-mediated) relationship with her coach. Miller's parents, for instance, have stated that members of the local Kiwanis Club "all think they are her surrogate father" (ESPN 1997). Likewise, Shannon herself has said that everyone in her hometown "has always treated me like their daughter" (ESPN 1997). The governor of Oklahoma, in turn, has referred to her as "the state's adopted daughter" (ESPN 1997). Frequent references to fe- male gymnasts by their first names facilitate such adoptive and appropria- tive impulses on a larger scale. In U.S. popular culture, the absence of a surname often signifies stardom, or even superstardom (Madonna, Cher, Michael, etc.). However, in the case of childlike female gymnasts, this con- vention also has indicated that the nation has taken young female gymnasts (Olga, Nadia, Mary Lou) into its heart. Thus, with respect to members of the 1996 U.S. Olympic women's gymnastics team, cuteness is a mass-mediated code of intimacy that func- tions as a precondition for representations of love - the nation's love for them and their love for the nation.21 Media depictions of cuteness, conse- quently, situate their public performances and their prodigious contribu- tions to national life in terms of collective affection. Thus, following the team's much publicized 1996 Olympic victory, which was referred to as a "national love-in" (Clarey 1996f, B9), the New Tork Times wondered "who would not aspire to be the next darling of the nation?" (1996, 12). United States media coverage, in turn, has circumscribed and posi- tioned members of the 1996 U.S. women's gymnastics team as Americans through these logics of adoption and family. These logics accrue significant force insofar as the family has become synecdochic with the values and the legacy of U.S. core national culture. Lauren Berlant has explained this relationship by describing the ways that "traditional, apolitical, sentimental patriarchal [heterosexual] family values" intersect with those of U.S. core 21 Merrish argues that cuteness can function as both a "public mass-cultural event" and as a "commercial style" (1996, 188).</page><page sequence="20">434 I Chisolm culture -with "a white normal national culture," a "core U.S. national cul- ture that has never actually existed except as ideal or dogma" (1996, 398, 401).22 She asserts, in turn, that mass-mediated representations of familial forms and of U.S. core culture have generated sentimental images of a singular U.S. culture (as well as models for social subjectivity and citizen- ship) that stand in opposition to - and that envisage a future at the expense of- abjected, "anti-normative" populations, embodiments, and practices (397-401, 431-32). Berlant makes her case by examining several mass- mediated figures. Paradigmatic among these are two anthropomorphic rep- resentations that mediate anxieties regarding core U.S. national culture: "the changing face of America" and "the new face of America." As indicated earlier, the televised special entitled "The Magnificent Seven: Made in America," which emphasized many of the themes discussed throughout this article (in particular those of cuteness, adoption, and family), intro- duced and framed the entire telecast with a segment that featured represen- tations of the 1996 U.S. Olympic women's gymnastics team as a cute artic- ulation of"the face of America" (Chisholm 1999, 134-38). In U.S. media representations of U.S. women's gymnastics, therefore, cuteness-an anthropomorphic aesthetic triggered to a great extent by physical and behavioral resemblances to human children - merges with the logics of family and U.S. core culture through the dynamic of adoption and affection that serves to validate the cute as cute. Furthermore, like U.S. core culture, cuteness, according to Merrish, also owes a tremendous debt to the logic of Anglo-American, bourgeois, patriarchal (heterosexual), "fa- milial and emotional structures" (1996, 189).23 Consequently, this dy- namic also minimizes threatening complications that might issue from contorted, androgynous children who straddle the line between the social and antisocial, between deviance and the norm. Accordingly, while their status as cute children enables members of the U.S. women's gymnastics team to embody domesticated difference, it also functions through adop- tion as a mechanism that radically circumscribes them as social subjects in the national media. Disavowed desires Overall, then, cute U.S. gymnasts recently have been positioned by U.S. media representations as precocious (and potentially transgressive) cute 22 See also Judith Stacey's analysis of the "new family values campaign" (1996, 62-72). 23 Both cuteness and representations of "the face of America" described by Berlant emerged as mass-mediated responses to white, Anglo (quasi-eugenic) anxieties regarding the implications of immigration for the United States (Berlant 1996, 410-24; Merrish 1996, 187-88).</page><page sequence="21">S I G N S Winter 2002 I 435 children who are viewed as lovable objects of affection and adoption within the white, normal, national logics of (heterosexual, patriarchal) family. Their lovability is predicated, in part, on their making themselves attrac- tive in (and for) the media in accordance with those terms, terms defined and delimited by the parent culture - core U.S. national culture, as defined by Berlant. Therefore, the manifest negotiation of differences between the child and the adult, between the deviant and the normative, between the antisocial and the social, is performed by the cute (potentially trans- gressive) child as her desire. Thus, according to Merrish, performances of cuteness engage in such negotiations and exhibit a "desire for sameness" that appears to be the child's (1996, 194). These, then, are the conditions under which the (potentially transgressive) cute gymnast enacts and au- thenticates love for her adoptive family and for the values of core, U.S. national culture; these, then, are conditions under which viewers are in- vited to respond affectionately by loving her in return. The cute, accordingly, is performed quite often through charming acts of diminutive imitation. In like manner, the cute female gymnast per- forming her floor routine exhibits her charisma and charm through the mimicry of adult behaviors. When cute U.S. gymnasts broadly pantomime stereotypical gestures of soldiers, of cowboys, and of folk dancers, these females with few if any physical indications of their sex do physically repro- duce aspects of the social--but only in a playful way, on a level that is skin deep. As indicated by the title "Women's Artistic Gymnastics," the prepubes- cent gymnast is credited when she mimics what she is not. In accordance with requirements of feminine artistry, women's gymnastics demands that androgynous, immature, childlike bodies appear to be elegant and grace- ful. Therefore, their performances of acrobatics and contortion must also include elegant, graceful postures and gestures that connote mature, re- fined femininity. Because these elements, deemed "gymnastic" (as opposed to "acrobatic"), are similar to balletic poses and leaps, gymnasts sometimes resemble miniature versions of prototypical ballerinas. This miniaturizing and mimicking of "mature," elegant, graceful femininity ultimately marks both its presence and its absence. It is realized at a distance from the gym- nast (the acrobatic, aerial woman, who, as we noted earlier, is "different from her own femininity" [Russo 1995, 44]). Yet, through such perfor- mances of cuteness, the androgynous female gymnast is feminized as a little girl who mobilizes our affection as she pretends to be a woman. In so doing, she negotiates the difference between her androgyny and heterosex- ual norms of gender and sex. Nevertheless, the implications of her mimicry must necessarily be</page><page sequence="22">436 I Chisolm restricted. At this point, the "mini-seductions" performed by the cute (U.S. gymnast) become complicated (Merrish 1996, 195). Because difference is at stake - and, indeed, continually alluded to by the difference between the mimic (child) and the original (adult) -the desire for the cute child, the desire necessary to legitimate the cute as cute, must be bounded in some way. Therefore, when the cute (desexed, androgynous) gymnast mimics stereotypes of normative, heterosexual femininity, the recognition of her appeal must be contained. This containment is marked by a (gen- dered) boundary that distinguishes appropriate and inappropriate re- sponses to the cute: a feminine, maternal posture of affection, embrace, and adoption (and, ultimately, protection) is sanctioned, whereas anything resembling reciprocal masculine, (substantially incestuous, paternal) het- erosexual attraction must be disavowed.24 Yet, many female gymnasts performing floor exercises overtly flirt with their judges and audiences. For example, Amanda Borden's Olympic floor routine, which was featured in commercials promoting NBC's coverage of women's gymnastics, was replete with hip-wiggling and hair-primping gestures reminiscent of Mae West. In turn, attitudes reciprocal to such cute performances are rendered indecent and perverse by familial logics under- writing U.S. core culture (ironically, the very logics that establish the terms of cute performances in the first place). There is, therefore, an expectation that U.S. viewers will deflect and minimize the female gymnast's coquettishness insofar as it is, after all, an imitation of feminine seduction performed by a guileless child who is nei- ther a woman nor a filly developed social subject. Furthermore, social pro- hibition clearly censures overt responses to the cute U.S. gymnast that risk positioning her as an object of desire. Thus, whereas U.S. media coverage (almost desperately) emphasizes the active heterosexual masculinity of roughly college-age male gymnasts through repeated references either to their wives and children or to their girlfriends, and whereas it typically stresses the heterosexuality of other female athletes, it goes to great lengths to depict teenage female gymnasts as cloistered young girls who have no time for parties, proms, and boys.25 Even in the context of coverage ex- pressly designed to portray members of the U.S. women's gymnastics team 24 Merrish writes that the cute child is "not the site of the absence of sexuality, but of its disavowal" (1996, 195). 25 United States media coverage of men's gymnastics routinely, indeed obsessively, features the wives and children of male gymnasts as a way to reinforce the heterosexual status of the latter. This is the case, I suspect, not only because of their age but also because gymnastics both reinforces and subtly jeopardizes the presumption of masculinity and heterosexuality required of male, U.S. athletes.</page><page sequence="23">S I G N S Winter 2002 I 437 as normal teenagers, boyfriends and dating are rarely mentioned.26 Rather, the media stresses the female gymnast's status as a chaste and disciplined girl. Still more telling is an instance in which NBC commentator John Tesh jokingly speculated that fraternity brothers might attempt to visit members of the 1996 U.S. Olympic women's gymnastics team, who resided at an Emory University fraternity house during the games (National Broadcast- ing Corporation 1996a). This comment was met by the stunned, nonre- sponsive silence of his colleagues, former U.S. gymnasts Tim Daggett and Elfi Schlegel. Clearly, Tesh's fellow commentators were reacting to more than the fatuousness of his statement. The impropriety (and quasi- salaciousness) of his remarks can be traced in part to his ignorance of the prohibitions against invoking- even hypothetically- heterosexual desire that might construct U.S. female gymnasts as its object. There is, consequently, precious little commentary regarding the ways in which mass-mediated images of gymnasts' lower bodies have functioned in relation to recent ideals of U.S. heterosexual feminine sexual allure. The slim, lean, and muscular lower torso traditionally associated with masculin- ity became one emblem of attractive and empowered heterosexual feminin- ity in the context of a U.S. fitness industry established through the com- modification of jogging, of weight lifting, of Jazzercise, of aerobics, and so forth. This occurrence coincided with the codification and the U.S. popu- larization of gymnastics as a decidedly acrobatic women's sport. Thus, the androgynous, prepubescent bodies that became emblematic of women's gymnastics between the mid-1970s and early 1980s inadvertently and ironically contributed to and reinforced aspects of feminine attractiveness that materialized in the nation during that time. Accordingly, a substantial number of contestants competing in Miss Fitness America Pageants have been former gymnasts who performed dance and acrobatic routines. Given the arrested development of most female gymnasts' breasts, it is not surprising that their lower bodies rather than their upper bodies have been fetishized in the United States. Furthermore, long-sleeved leotards cover the ripped, veined, sinewy muscles of female gymnasts' upper bodies (their biceps, triceps, lats, etc.).27 The leg cuts of their leotards, on the other hand, reveal the grooves and ridges of their lean, muscled quadriceps and glutes, which provide the visible basis for their physical exceptionalism. 26 Indeed, gymnasts are cast as girlfriends, fiancees, wives, and mothers only after they have retired from international competition. 27 The 1994 Code ofPoints reads as follows: "leotards with narrow shoulder straps are not allowed" (International Gymnastics Federation 1994, 12).</page><page sequence="24">438 I Chisolm Congruent with the ethic of the sport, then, athletic value has merged with aesthetic value, as coded within a heterosexual economy of desire. Even today, the names of U.S. gymnasts -young girls who often look more like boys than women--have been mentioned along with those of actresses and models in "best legs" lists. Thus, Entertainment Tonight recently aired footage from 1984 that included an interview with Rob Lowe in which the actor raised and lowered his eyebrows suggestively as he declared "I just met Mary Lou Retton, which is great" (Columbia Broadcasting Sys- tem 2001). At this point, something more has emerged than either the attempts of cute gymnasts to mediate difference in accordance with terms set by U.S. core culture or the acceptable maternal response of affection and adoption. There is no escaping the distinct sense that a mass-mediated desire ex- ceeding social prohibition, a desire to compensate for incomplete perfor- mances of heterosexual norms of gender and sex, has been projected onto the bodies of gymnasts. Pedophiles have engaged in similar projections by supplementing digital images of U.S. gymnasts such as Miller and Domi- nique Moceanu with effaced female genitalia (petite breasts, labia, etc.). The same phenomenon occurs in mainstream periodicals, however, as il- lustrated by two recent essays about U.S. women's figure skating that ap- peared in the New Yorker. In those essays, John Seabrook has likened the physical attributes of newly emergent, teenage skating stars (who embody the recently heightened emphasis on jumps) to those long associated with female gymnasts, stressing both their lack of breasts and hips and their muscular glutes and thighs (1998b, 38-39, 41). Even as he writes that such bodies have "shrugged off" adult sexuality, and while noting that some (heterosexual) men harbor longings for the retired, elegant, and ma- ture skater Katarina Witt, Seabrook describes one fourteen-year-old athlete as "an Olympic nymphet" who released an "almost sexual" scream upon learning of her gold medal victory (1998a, 33).28 Also, recall the cult of the "10," which resulted in the widespread, nu- merical assessment of U.S. women's (and eventually men's) physical attrac- tiveness on a ten-point scale. Although this phenomenon can be attributed directly to Bo Derek's appearance in the film 10 (1979), it can be traced as well to Nadia Comaneci's seven perfect performances at the 1976 Olympic Games-which, as the first perfect scores of 10.0 earned in gymnastics 28 Seabrook writes that "speculating along these lines is close to committing a thought crime these days.... Yet the figure skater is a fixture in the gallery of American male fantasies." He also asserts that "it's the men who really do find Tara [Lipinski] sexy that you really have to worry about" (1998a, 33).</page><page sequence="25">S I G N S Winter 2002 I 439 history, were celebrated extensively in the U.S. media. Along the same lines, actor Ryan O'Neal has recalled the thoughts that came to his mind during his first sexual encounter with partner Farrah Fawcett, an icon of heterosexual comeliness in the mid-1970s: "Oh my God I feel like I'm in bed with Olga Korbut" (Murphy 1991, 5). In each case, mature women, Derek and Fawcett, have come to embody earlier (and more or less) dis- avowed desires that emerged in tandem with cute female gymnasts' performances. These examples betray desires that can be coded as (masculine, hetero- sexual) pedophilic perversities. Conversely, Merrish contends that as a stag- ing of "the sublimation of adults' erotic feeling toward children cuteness is the sign of a particular relation between adult and child" - one that "si- multaneously establish[es] the 'innocence' of the child and the 'civility' of the adult spectator" (1996, 188-89). Thus, in many U.S. media representations of cute gymnasts, more is at stake than the social regulation of oppositions such as adult/child and innocence/perversion. When considered in relation to these cute children, who are both ours and "other," the stakes located at the border between civility and incivility become clear. As indicated earlier, near-pedophilic me- dia constructions of cute gymnasts reveal the desire to compensate for their incomplete performances of heterosexual norms of gender and sex, norms that are fundamental to the intersecting logics of family and nation. More to the point, these constructions manifest incestuous (masculine) desires that, by domesticating the otherness of the feminine child's independent will and sexuality, contain desire within the family. With respect to cute gymnasts, therefore, this mass-mediated containment of these "daddy's girls" signals a blatant desire for sameness, an inordinate desire to insure that signs of otherness are coded and apprehended in ways that guarantee the logics of U.S. core culture (Ryan 1995, 68). Stimulated not only by the female gymnast's transgressiveness and by her unacceptable female power but also by her childlike defenselessness and malleability, this in- cestuous stance, moreover, attends what Berlant has described as concur- rent mass-mediated aspirations for a "remasculinized America where the boundaries are drawn in all the right places" (1996, 410). In U.S. media portrayals of U.S. women's gymnastics, therefore, a desire for social order attends the uncivil, projected, incestuous relation between the adult and the cute child, both of whom can now be seen to mediate the binaries antisocial/social and deviance/norm. A similar desire for social order also motivates the civil, acceptable, maternal stance of affection and embrace, which is overtly encouraged and sanctioned by U.S. media cover- age and which disavows pedophilic impulses such as those discussed above.</page><page sequence="26">440 I Chisolm In the end, then, the perverse and uncivil are aligned with the civil, al- though the latter functions far more surreptitiously through adoption than the more obviously ardent desire for sameness that the mass-mediated log- ics of core U.S. culture both promote and disavow. Desubjectification and sadism Although cute U.S. gymnasts do not embody the other per se, they em- body the risk of the other (of difference) in our midst. Yet, through their cuteness, they more or less function as guarantors that minimize those risks as well. The subjectivity of these pivotal figures, however, appears precari- ous. This is not surprising insofar as the child embodies the risk of the antisocial precisely because s/he is perceived to be a partially unsocialized being, a being who has yet to become a fully developed, rational member of society, a being who must be taught, trained, and disciplined for pre- cisely that reason. Furthermore, the cute child's lack of subjectivity also serves as the basis for its unthreatening adoptability, assimilability, and do- mestication. The cute gymnast's seeming lack of subjectivity, therefore, ac- counts both for the ways she has come to incorporate assimilable difference within U.S. popular culture and for the ways she has been positioned and ruthlessly circumscribed as a viable, autonomous social subject. Hence, the social subjectivity of the cute child is uncertain not in spite of, but rather because of, its pivotal function with respect to mediating difference. Desubjectification, then, is not merely a precondition of cuteness; it also serves as the means through which cuteness provides the ultimate social guarantee. With respect to cuteness, desubjectification enacts "the need for adult care," while simultaneously delegitimating the child who arbitrates and represents difference (Merrish 1996, 187). In these ways, desubjecti- fication has underwritten ambivalent U.S. media representations of the 1996 U.S. women's gymnastics team. Initially, U.S. female gymnasts appear to be extraordinary manifesta- tions of disciplined subjectivity. United States media coverage facilitates this impression by emphasizing not only their physical discipline but also their mental strength. In particular, the gymnasts mental preparation is established through lingering close-ups of her face before she begins her performances. Almost without exception, she is depicted staring down the apparatus at hand with a solemnity and a fixedness that commentators in- evitably describe in terms of her extreme focus and intense concentration. In the end, her successful performances are credited to her mental tough- ness, to her ability to "control her nerves," and to her ability to submit matter to mind (Clarey 1996b, C5). Often, however, it seems that the mind at work is not that of the gym-</page><page sequence="27">S I G N S Winter 2002 I 441 nast but, rather, that of her coach. In fact, the gymnast's body often is described as functioning mindlessly by rote. Miller, for instance, has stated explicitly that "I practice ... so many times that my body knows what to do automatically" (Clarey 1996a, 11). Moreover, U.S. gymnastic coaches often wear microphones provided by U.S. television networks during na- tional and international women's gymnastic competitions. This practice is unique to the (predominantly male) coaches of high-profile U.S. partici- pants in women's, but not in men's, gymnastics. Thus, televised images of Moceanu's beam routine at the 1996 Olympic team competition were accompanied by Karolyi's voice (ostensibly) directing her as follows: "Tight, tight, nice, tight. Yes, yes, yes- and long. Yes--watch it! Good. Clean. Good job, right. Nice and easy. Yes.... Smooth, smooth." In these circumstances, the movements and flights of gymnasts' bodies appear to be synchronized to and guided by the voice-overs provided by their coaches (National Broadcasting Corporation 1996b).29 Furthermore, many U.S. gymnasts are depicted as painfully shy and overly sensitive children who lacked self-esteem until they were rescued and molded into successful, victorious representatives of the nation by their coaches. For example, Karolyi said the following of Strug: "Her basic personality was not that aggressive.... I always had to handle her as a baby. That's what we called her, the Baby. Even when I was angry at the group and threw everyone into the same pot of criticism, she had to be protected" (Swift 1996b, 62). Likewise, Steve Nunno has described his first impressions of Miller, the most successful U.S. gymnast in the history of the sport. He revealed that she was "crying after each of her turns and really disappointed and really trying hard. And I said, 'there's a girl that I can help. ... I know what the problem is with her.... I can help her"' (ESPN 1997; ESPN2 1998). Footage of coaches' reactions to "their gymnasts" routines is integral to U.S. television coverage of women's gymnastics. In many ways, the cute gymnast's subsequent contact with her coach marks the true completion of her performance. Often, the sentiments displayed by her coach during these interactions (calling the gymnast to his side, patting her on the head, exclaiming "good girl, good girl") evoke proprietary dynamics reminiscent not only of parenting but also of pet ownership. Overall, then, when con- sidered in relation to their coaches, cute gymnasts appear to be both "con- senting subject[s]" and "property object[s]" (Merrish 1996, 187). Accordingly, members of the 1996 U.S. Olympic women's gymnastics 29 The 1994 Code ofPoints, however, penalizes "signals, verbal commands, shouts, etc. by coach to own gymnast" (International Gymnastics Federation 1994, 25).</page><page sequence="28">442 I Chisolm team are portrayed as exceptional citizens who are, at the same time, not quite social subjects. Therefore, when the youngest U.S. national cham- pion in the sport, Moceanu, wrote her autobiography before the Olym- pics, she became something of a national joke. The punch lines delivered on late night talk shows referred to the fact that, in spite of her achieve- ment, the fourteen-year-old (who looked like a seven-year-old) was not a fit subject for her own life story. As a result, as cute children, members of the 1996 U.S. Olympic women's gymnastics team straddle the line be- tween incarnating "smaller less powerful vehicles of human agency" (im- mature citizenship) and being cast as disqualified citizens (Berlant 1996, 389, 401). In the latter respect, the cute once again signals the transgressive and even the infrahuman as it dovetails with the freak. United States popular culture frequently characterizes cute, female gymnasts in this way through references to their (contorted) bodies. These cute gymnasts often exhibit their freakishness when they are pictured with unusually large male athletes in a giant-dwarf configuration. Along these lines, Moceanu has been pic- tured with a four hundred pound weight lifter, and Miller and Charles Barkley (a professional basketball player) have posed together for photo opportunities (Berg and LeRussa 1995). Additionally, at least two male performers have parodied Strug's androgynous appearance and squeaky voice on Saturday Night Live for the past two years. Thus, the Magnificent Seven, the team of female gymnasts that derived its promotional name from a U.S. remake of a Japanese film (a film about displaced yet heroic cowboy- outlaws and their ambivalent relation to community), shared that title less than a year after the 1996 Olympic games in Atlanta with the McCaughey septuplets of Iowa (seven babies from America's heartland who were prop- agated unnaturally through fertility treatments). Additionally, vivid media descriptions of their apparently precarious and hysterical emotional states disqualify U.S. gymnasts as rational and stable social subjects. In women's gymnastics, it seems, emotional break- downs are everyday fare. This impression, of course, heightens the value of victories predicated not only on physical but also on emotional control. During the 1996 U.S. Olympic team trials, for example, Tesh described tensions surrounding the competition by revealing that, after he posed a single interview question to Amanda Borden, she burst into tears (Na- tional Broadcasting Corporation 1996a). In fact, the tears of the 1996 U.S. Olympic women's gymnastics team saturated U.S. media coverage of the sport. Notwithstanding their gold medal victory and their status as na- tional heroes, televised images of almost half of the U.S. team pictured them crying in close-up when they missed opportunities for individual</page><page sequence="29">S I G N S Winter 2002 I 443 honors. Print coverage also unfailingly and repeatedly emphasized these tears of disappointment (Clarey 1996f, B9, B16, 1996d, 6). Similarly, when NBC broadcast the final moments of the U.S. team's victory and the concluding moments of the Russian team's loss, U.S. viewers witnessed images of Russian gymnasts in paroxysms of grief and of Strug weeping in pain.30 Thus, U.S. media coverage constructs a reciprocal relation between mind and matter with respect to less-than-perfect performances in wom- en's gymnastics. On the one hand, physical errors often are attributed to mental instability. On the other hand, the gymnast's precarious subjectivity is revealed when her body has not performed as expected, when extraordi- nary perfection has not been achieved. Concomitantly, U.S. media cover- age of women's gymnastics seems to bring hysteria to the fore as some- thing rarely held at bay with success by practitioners of the sport. Even though crying compromises the subjectivity of cute gymnasts, tears are necessary to their cuteness because it often functions, as Merrish argues, by "aestheticiz[ing] powerlessness" and by "stag[ing] a need for adult care" (1996, 188). The vulnerability of the cute female gymnast, in other words, may enhance both her adoptability as well as self-attributions of benevolence on the part of those who take her into their hearts; the vulnerability of the cute significantly forestalls the risk of the other in our midst. Therefore, to the extent that the mass-mediated relationship be- tween the gymnast and U.S. viewers depends on a "subject" that must be rendered susceptible to mental and physical danger, the pleasures of gymnastics spectatorship are tinged with sadism. These sadistic desires are projected onto and enacted by the gymnast in two ways. First, the successful gymnast's performance often is positioned in the context of self-flagellation. In this vein, International Gymnastics, a U.S. publication, described the individual medals earned by three 1996 U.S. Olympic team members as a "final redemption" (Normile 1996, 2- 27). Comparably, Miller explained that her gold medal performance on the balance beam was "my last chance to redeem myself from yesterday's vault" (Clarey 1996c, Bll, B18). Televised coverage of many successful perfor- mances, accordingly, explicitly recalls and rebroadcasts prior instances of physical and emotional collapse. Second, gymnasts are portrayed as habitu- ally enacting either stoicism or masochism. For instance, in U.S. women's 30 Russo asserts that the aerial woman assumes her nonexistence and constitutes herself as a "subject" via hysterical and physical breakdowns (1995, 47). Yet, I question the extent to which U.S. women gymnasts embody the highly resistant possibilities that Russo attributes to this uncanny and abject doubling of the aerial.</page><page sequence="30">444 I Chisolm gymnastics, competing with serious injuries seems to be the rule rather than the exception; enduring pain when they perform is part of the rou- tine. When deemed noteworthy, such injuries are cast as indications of courage and self-sacrifice that are to be praised and celebrated. Thus, the day after the 1996 U.S. Olympic women's gymnastics team won its gold medal through the efforts of the injured Strug, International Gymnast cele- brated "The Agony of Victory" (October 1996). Likewise, the headline for the New York Times's sports page announced that "For the Magnificent Seven, It Hurts So Good" (Clarey 1996e, B7). Let us turn, now, to Strug's acclaimed second vault in the final rotation of the team competition at the 1996 Olympics (National Broadcasting Corporation 1996b). The U.S. team, which had pulled ahead of the Rus- sians, was preparing to win until pigtailed wunderkind Moceanu seat- dropped the landings of her two vaults. The four foot, nine-inch tall, eighty-seven pound Strug vaulted next. The boyish, spritelike Strug, whose ankles had been taped throughout the competition (her left leg, in fact, was taped up to her shin), botched the landing of her first vault as well. In doing so, she (further) injured her left ankle noticeably. The only reference to her prior injury was made in the aftermath by NBC announcer Tim Daggett, who conceded that "vaulting [on] unhealthy legs can sometimes hurt" (National Broadcasting Corporation 1996b). Subsequent shots of Strug limping up the runway were crosscut with televised close-ups of Karolyi, who could be heard urging her to execute her second vault (e.g., "you can do it, Kerri," "go very hard") in spite of the obvious damage to her ankle. After bouncing up and down to numb the pain - without either a whimper or a moment's hesitation in her run - she vaulted successfully. She landed without a hop, raised her arms overhead, and gingerly lifted her left foot as she crumbled onto the mat, reaching for her injured ankle and grimacing with pain. Unable to walk, Strug cried while the nation celebrated. After Strug was whisked out of sight by medical technicians, NBC's cameras found her parents searching for their daughter (unsuccessfully) in the hallways of the gymnastics stadium. She later emerged with Karolyi. As described by Sports Illustrated, Karolyi was "cradling her, once more a little girl, in his arms" as he carried her to the podium for the medal cere- mony (Swift 1996a, 104). Balancing on one foot to protect her injured ankle as she received her gold medal, Strug was the epitome of the acro- batic, contorted, cute U.S. gymnast who had played her part to (near) per- fection. What often is unmentioned and consistently rationalized is the degree to which Strug, indeed, literally was playing a part: the U.S. team, it seems, did not need her vault to win. She sacrificed for nothing, but she</page><page sequence="31">S I G N S Winter 2002 I 445 dramatized a role historically and socially delineated for participants in U.S. women's gymnastics so well that, for a moment, she won the na- tion's heart. Conclusion Given the physical performances that constitute women's gymnastics, it is not surprising that recent permutations of the sport have inherited the leg- acies of the minstrelsy and of the circus. What is surprising, however, are the complex negotiations that U.S. women gymnasts ultimately have per- formed along those lines in U.S. popular culture. Indeed, finessing funda- mental social binaries as an acrobatic, contorted, androgynous, cute child is no simple matter. This fact readily becomes apparent when U.S. gym- nasts' mass-mediated negotiations of social binaries are traced through their mobius-like trajectories. As fantasies of adoption merge with pedo- philia, as affection pivots on sadism, intensifying dynamics of intimacy and abjection circulate around these infantilized aerial women, who are repre- sented in the U.S. media as both exemplary and disqualified citizens. Thus constructed and positioned in relation to codes of paternalistic, U.S. core national culture, the (cute, childlike) U.S. female gymnast seems to be a classically disciplined liberal citizen whose subjectivity and physical- ity ultimately are rendered precarious and delegitimated on those very same terms. Given this circumstance, in order to achieve and to maintain her status as a heroic and exemplary citizen, or even as a citizen at all, the (cute, childlike) U.S. female gymnast must be viewed as maintaining exceptional physical and emotional control. Such enactments of citizen- ship, in turn, point both to the potential rewards and to the risks associated with U.S. women gymnasts as mass-mediated symbols of feminist athletic advancement and of female citizenship in the late twentieth century. There- fore, we cannot, and indeed should not, deny the import of U.S. women's gymnastics as a captivating and problematic site of identification for young girls. Specifically, as depicted in the U.S. media, practitioners of the sport pro- vide young girls with promises of empowerment and resistance that are both compelling and perilous. Thus, representations of women's gymnas- tics serve as sources of inspiration for young girls by offering them models for forging their identities as extraordinary social subjects and citizens. Furthermore, the sport itself provides a clearly constructed scheme for pur- suing this goal through physical training and achievement. Consequently, U.S. women's gymnastics equips young girls with a powerful framework through which they can conceptualize, desire, cultivate, and experience the</page><page sequence="32">446 I Chisolm strength and potentialities of their bodies. The resistant possibilities of such desires (potentially) emerge in an athletic context that reinforces the contention that the strength-to-size ratio of young girls may be "greater than that of any ... athlete, male or female, of any age" (Seabrook 1998b, 33). This is a context, after all, wherein teenage female gymnasts routinely execute the same athletic maneuvers performed by adult male gymnasts (on apparatuses that currently are similar but gendered: e.g., floor exercise, vault, even high bar). When media coverage of U.S. women's gymnastics conveys such information, it tacitly invites viewers to imagine gymnastics exhibitions that might not categorize participants on the basis of sex and that might instead depict sport as it has been conceptualized by Mary Jo Kane -as a "continuum" of autotelic physical possibility relative to size, age, experience, natural aptitude, and so forth (1995). At present, how- ever, U.S. media representations of the sport have neither explicitly ex- tended such invitation nor assessed its potential implications (both positive and negative). Rather, they continue to rehearse narratives that reinforce traditional gendered binaries by recuperating and rendering vulnerable fe- male gymnasts who traverse not only gendered and sexed boundaries but also, in the process, those maintained by the logics of core U.S. national culture. Concomitantly, the fundamental mass appeal of U.S. women's gymnas- tics seems to issue from its complex and contradictory nature, which gener- ates and ultimately devitalizes its empowering, resistant, and transgressive impulses. As depicted in the U.S. media, the sport at once comprises enact- ments of superior femininity (coded in terms of class, race, and nation) and transgresses those very same codes by cultivating a "dangerous virility" (embodied in flight and as a contortion of sorts). Therefore, just as Tania Modleski describes the female aerialist in Wim Wenders's Wings of Desire as "emblematic of the .. . desire to have it both ways" (1991, 104-9), U.S. media representations of women's gymnastics foster this desire and cast participation in the sport itself as the means of its fulfillment. Concurrently, U.S. media coverage portrays the female gymnast as both the transcendent individual citizen and as the risk of the other (of difference), a risk ulti- mately negotiated by mass-mediated performances of femininity that so- licit recuperative affection and protection according to the logics of core U.S. national culture - although at a substantial cost. Thus, because the ultimate markers of women's gymnastics in U.S. pop- ular culture today--flight, contortion, and cuteness--are culturally loaded, so too is the status of gymnasts who serve as U.S. symbols of exem- plary female citizenship. Here, we must begin by considering their aerial legacy. As mass-mediated icons of liberal feminism, their viability as models</page><page sequence="33">S I G N S Winter 2002 I 447 for social subjectivity and citizenship hinges on exceptional performances that exceed traditional assumptions regarding feminine physical weakness and emotional instability. Nevertheless, even as individual gymnasts repre- sent a variant of liberal feminism by embodying liberal citizenship, the male model that underwrites the latter - and that serves as the basis for the logics of core U.S. national culture -remains uninterrogated. United States media coverage, accordingly, mobilizes the logics of core U.S. national culture as a means of managing the risk of difference embod- ied by female gymnasts according to those very same time-honored tradi- tions of liberalism. As a result, even extraordinary, aerial gymnasts are con- structed, in the end, through mass-mediated reassertions of the classical liberal conception of woman. United States media representations thus do- mesticate and privatize the separate sphere of women's (as opposed to men's) artistic gymnastics, which comprises codes of femininity grounded in cuteness, through narratives that feature families and children. In this context and through those feminine codes, U.S. media coverage also cir- cumscribes the female gymnast's comportment and embodiment of differ- ence (gendered and otherwise) by infantilizing her and by subjecting her to heterosexual (incestuous) desire. Subsuming this extraordinary individ- ual within the family unit, in turn, serves to limit attributions of self- determination and to create scenarios of dependency ostensibly brought on by the female gymnast's physical weakness and emotional instability.31 Thus failing to meet the fundamental standards of liberal citizenship (indi- vidualism, self-reliance, self-determination, rationality) while at the same time realizing the liberal definition of woman, gymnasts who merit na- tional media exposure ironically erase the gains of liberal feminism when these exceptional citizens reveal that they are merely women after all.
