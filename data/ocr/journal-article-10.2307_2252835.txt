<plain_text><page sequence="1">VII.-CRITICAL NOTICES Action. By D. G. BROWN. London: Allen and Unwin, 1968. Pp. 150. 45s. AMONG the things that human beings can be said to do, some, but not all, are to be counted, in a favoured and central sense, as actions of theirs. Going to sleep, sleeping and snoring, tripping over the steps and falling are things that human beings do; so are indulging in a day-dream or working out a sum in the head. But these are not actions. They fail to satisfy one or the other of two necessary -conditions-for being actions. The first condition is thatthe-doin-of the thing should be the settling, or the outcome of the settling, of the question whether or not to do that thing; and this condition is satisfied only if the question, for what reason it was done, is appro- priate (even though the answer to it may be ' For no reason '). The second condition is that the doing of the thing should involve some externally observable change or movement of the body of the agent. It may be that the doing of the thing simply consists in such a move- ment, as when a man performs the action of walking or nodding his head; or it may be that the bodily movement is involved in the way in which the movement of a man's hand or foot is involved in his performing the action of starting his car. These are conditions of a doing being a human action or the action of a person. But not all action is human, or even animate, action. Inanimate physical things can be agents, can act. The conditions of their doing so are different from, but overlap with, the conditions of human action. Inanimate things can act only by acting on other things. One such thing acts on another when a movement or change in the first is causallyresponsible for a movement or change in the second. A concept which covers both kinds of action, though in different modes, is that of explanatory attributability to an agent. In the case of inanimate action, the change in the thing acted on is attri- buted to the inanimate agent; and here the attribution involves, or implies the availability of, a causal explanation, in that it rests on the fact that the movement or change in the thing acted on is caused by a movement or change in the agent. Explanation associated with the attribution of human action, though that action may involve some causal steps or sequences-as when the movement of the agent's hand is causally responsible for closing the switch which starts the engine-is ultimately of a different and non-causal kind. Explana- tory attribution to a human agent, whether what is attributed is a bodily movement of his or an effect caused by such a movement, implies the appropriateness of explanation in terms of reasons. Such, in bare outline, is the framework of ideas within which Brown elects to handle his topic. Or perhaps one should say, his topics. He speaks of fitting together the pieces of the puzzle; and the image is apt to his procedure. He handles a great many pieces; he handles 441</page><page sequence="2">442 CRITICAL NOTICES: them, usually, with scrupulous delicacy; and in many extensive sub- areas of the whole he deftly and economically achieves a most satisfactory interlocking. Much recent, and less recent, discussion (e.g. of knowledge of one's own bodily movements; of causal neces- sity; of human embodiment) is brilliantly concentrated and clarified. Yet viewing the result as a whole, one has a diminished sense of suc- cess. There seem to be gaps; some forcing; some final failure of fit. Perhaps some pieces are missing? Perhaps there are a few which don't belong ? I choose three points on which to voice some un- systematic doubt. First, as to inanimate action. (1) Brown seems mysteriously and gratuitously obsessed with the notion of the inanimate agent. He oddly holds that the concept of inanimate action is a 'primitive' element in his own analysis of human action; but we can see at once that this is not so, since (as he himself remarks, calling it a curious fact about the noun ' action') those basic human actions which consist in movements of the agent's body do not essentially involve what inanimate action does essentially involve, viz. the producing of an effect in another thing. All I can find to explain, though in no way to justify, Brown's odd belief about his own analysis are the facts (a) that the generic notion of explanatory attributability covers both human and inanimate action and (b) that the general notion of physical causation has a place in the account of both. It seems likely from what follows that it is this second point which is mainly influencing him. (2) Because of his odd belief, Brown is very anxious to show that the notion of inanimate action does not essentially involve the confused projection into nature of the concept of human action itself. This wish is not misplaced in so far as the general concept of causation is concerned, since that concept surely enters into any complete account of human action; and Brown gives an admirable account of causal and other varieties of necessity, in the course of which he borrows from, and greatly im- proves upon, Hume. But his anxiety leads him also unjustly to ignore some elements of anthropomorphic projection which we can surely find in some concepts of natural action. For instance, ' From what impression is the idea of force derived ? ' is a question one can not unreasonably ask, and conjecturally answer by reference to the human experience of exerting force and having it exerted on one. (3) Brown seems to be in error as to the nature of inanimate action itself. He holds that when an inanimate agent acts on another thing, it must do so by changing or moving: the effect in the thing acted on is caused by the change or movement in the agent. But at the level of commonsense description with which Brown is here concerned, this seems to be simply false. Mere contact with, or, generally, exposure to, the agent may produce the effect; as when the snow chills the wine, the water softens the skin or the acid turns the litmus paper red. It would be no answer to say that refined analysis shows that something happens to the agent as well.</page><page sequence="3">P. F. STRAWSON: Action 443 Next I turn to the ' ability to act at will'. Brown raises the question whether the fact that we (human beings) have this ability is a brute fact. A fact is brute as far as we (philosophers) are con- cerned-philosophically brute-if we cannot analyse it further and if we cannot explain how it is possible there should be such a fact. The fact in question would be brute if all we could say about it was this: when we perform a voluntary action, we not only perceive that the action, say the movement, has taken place, we also have the distinc- tive experience which we can express by saying that we acted vol- untarily; the concept of the ability to act at will is derived from this distinctive experience, the experience of the exercise of the ability. Brown rejects this account and with it the apparent bruteness of the fact. He says that the concept cannot be derived from the experience since you could not have the experience unless you already had the concept. He says the reason for this is that in order for it to be true that you are doing something in exercise of the capacity to act at will, you must know (be aware) that you are doing it in exercise of that capacity. Having rejected the experience as the source of the concept, Brown claims that his own account' begins to exhibit part of the analysis ' of the concept. Being aware that you are exercising the capacity to act at will means being aware that your doing what you do is the settling, or the outcome of the settling, of the question whether or not to do it. Does this mean that you actually considered the question ? No. You may not have. It means, rather, that the question what your reason for doing it was, is appro- priate. And how do we know when this question, addressed to us, is appropriate ? Is it appropriate just when we can sincerely give a reason ? No: for it might be that the only answer to the question is 'For no particular reason', even when the question is appropriate. So, again, how do we know the question is appropriate ? We know this because we know that it was open to us to do or not to do the thing we did, i.e. we were free to do or not to do it. But now the appearance of analysis seems to be threatened. A widening out was succeeded by a narrowing down again, a return to the starting point. It now looks almost as if the elements of the supposed analysis were but consequences of the nuclear, still un- analysed thing. That the thing is unanalysable is a suggestion which other philosophers besides Brown may well want to resist. But Brown does not show themhow it should be resisted. Is he arranging the pieces wrongly ? Are there some pieces missing ? Or is the whole approach insufficiently radical ? Brown himself acknowledges a sense of impasse at this point. He attributes it not to a failure of analysis, however, but to a different cause. We are describing, he says, the point of view of the agent, and what is really worrying us now is the question how there could be such a thing. It is the other aspect of the non-bruteness of the fact of the abiti'y to act at will that we must now turn to, the philosophical explanation of the possibility of this fact. To give this explanation</page><page sequence="4">444 CRITICAL NOTICES: we must abandon the point of view of the agent for that of the spectator. If I have understood him rightly, Brown finds the philosophical explanation he seeks in facts about the non-philosophical explanation of human action. And here I enter my third area of doubt. Brown modestly says that he ' declines the problem' of freewill and determinism. But, given the direction of his argument, he really cannot refuse this fence; and he does not. In summarising his views, I express myself with a crudeness quite uncharacteristic of him, and perhaps, therefore, misrepresent him. The possibility (legitimacy ? validity ?) of the point of view of the agent depends upon the appropriateness, from the point of view of the spectator, of giving or seeking explanations of the agent's behaviour in terms of reasons. The appropriateness of explanation in terms of reasons depends upon the failure, in the case of action, of explanation in terms of physical causes. To speak of such failure is not to deny physical determinism in respect of the elements into which bodily involvement in action could be resolved or in respect of the relations of those elements. (Brown is inclined to hold such determinism to be probably true; indeed, in an earlier part of his book he seems committed to it.) To speak of such failure is simply to deny the practicability of a full explanation in terms of physical causes in the case of any single human action. Brown anticipates, with a conjecture, the charge that his position equates freedom with ignorance of necessity. He says that even if a complete physical explanation were forthcoming in any par- ticular case, it need not displace, or be a rival to, an explanation in terms of reasons. The two explanations might not really be two at all. They might, rather, fit into a single unified explanation. The causal account contains certain physical specifications, the account in terms of reasons contains certain psychological specifications. If there were found to be a natural equivalence between these psycho- logical specifications and some part of those physical specifications- some relation of the form, p if and only if q-then we might say that, so far from the physical explanation threatening to displace the psychological, the truth of the former was required for the truth of the latter. I find Brown's position extraordinarily difficult to understand. It seems to be said that explanation in terms of reasons is appropriate in certain areas where physical explanation is impracticable, and appro- priate, at least partly, because physical explanation is there im- practicable. But how is this doctrine to be reconciled with the further view that explanation in terms of reasons would still be acceptable in these areas, even if physical explanations were also available, so long as there held the natural equivalence relations above referred to ? If this further view is correct, then, first, the impracticability of physical explanation must be irrelevant to the appropriateness of explanation in terms of reasons; and, second,</page><page sequence="5">P. F. STRAWSON: Action 445 this appropriateness remains altogether unexplained. It is no good appealing-as the naive might be tempted to do-to the fact of the capacity to act at will in order to explain the appropriateness of explanation in terms of reasons. For Brown appears to hold that to explain the appropriateness of explanation in terms of reasons is to explain how there can be such a thing as the capacity to act at will. Objectively considered, the existence of this capacity is nothing other than the appropriateness, in certain cases, of this style of explanation. We might perhaps get ourselves out of this impasse by shedding the 'further view' regarding natural equivalence relations (a view very tentatively advanced by Brown). But now we are out of one impasse into another. For surely the impracticability of explanation in terms of physical causes cannot be a sufficient explanation of the appropriateness of explanation in terms of reasons. There must be something else which makes the latter style of explanation apt and welcome, when it is. It would be pertinent to ask what. Or, if it is felt a sufficient answer to say: It is a mode of explanation-then one might ask why the giving of reasons counts as explanation; how we tell right from wrong explanations of this kind; and, above all, what sort, or sorts, of interest this kind of explanation has for us. Brown's book is written with great care. An Aristotelian dryness alternates with a subdued eloquence. An occasional muted epigram appears. There is much to be learnt from the work, even if it does not resolve all our problems in this most difficult field. University of Oxford P. F. STRAWSON</page></plain_text>
