Academic Press, Inc., New York, 1982, 536 pp. $96.50 cloth. This volume contains con- tributions by 13 authors concerning the interactions between reptiles and their en- vironment with regard to temperature (six chapters) and water (four chapters). Gans and Pough have selected a broad range of critical topics and highly competent au- thors to write about them. In the introductory chapter, the editors briefly discuss the nature of physiological ecology and how the approach began with the study of thermoregulation by desert lizards. They then summarize the linkage between the physiology of reptiles and their environment in a number of areas: metabolic characteristics, food require- ments, body form, body size, biomass con- version efficiency, growth rate flexibility, and integumentary permeability and wear resistance. The editors point out that the class Reptilia is characterized by the ab- sence, rather than the presence, of a unifying morphological scheme; the rep- tilian grade of organization permits diver- sity of body form. The ideas set forth in this chapter provide the philosophical framework for those that follow. In the second chapter, Pough and Gans perform a great service to herpetologists: they present a glossary of terms used in the description of reptilian thermoregu- lation. This glossary parallels that of Bligh and Johnson (1973) for endotherms and points out the inappropriateness of a num- ber of currently used terms. For example, "mean selected temperature" should be used in place of "preferred temperature" because the latter is anthropomorphic. Adherence to the terminology in this glos- sary by students of reptilian thermoregu- lation would serve to standardize the lit- erature. R. B. Huey discusses a number of as- pects of the physiological ecology of ther- moregulation by reptiles, and in doing so challenges some widely held beliefs. For example, Huey calculates the difference between critical thermal maximum and the upper body temperature for active crocodilians, turtles, lizards, and snakes. Because the average difference is 6 C, it is clear that reptiles are rarely active near potentially lethal body temperatures, as was previously believed. Furthermore, Huey points out that there are now many studies which indicate that imprecise tem- perature regulation and a broad thermal tolerance may be beneficial in some en- vironments; some reptiles need not active- ly thermoregulate to have a long daily ac- tivity period. Huey asks if most reptiles in nature thermoregulate precisely. The an- swer is "yes" if the criterion is a stable body temperature near that achieved in a laboratory thermal gradient but "no," at least for many species, if the criterion is overt thermoregulatory behavior. There is a clear need for detailed observations on the relation between behavior, tempera- ture and the characteristics of the envi- ronment of reptiles. In an especially in- teresting section, Huey discusses graphical and statistical methods for analyzing the effect of temperature on physiological performance; such approaches permit rig- orous testing of hypotheses of how tem- perature alters physiology. R. A. Avery summarizes recent field studies of thermoregulation by reptiles. He notes that Brattstrom (1965), in his re- view, presented data for 160 species; the present chapter covers over 500 species, representing all major groups. Avery cau- tions that there are many reports of body temperatures in isolation from other data on behavior or environmental tempera- tures; such information tells virtually nothing about thermoregulatory biology. Most of the available field data is for liz- ards; Avery discusses the data for each family and divides the families into (1) 89</page><page sequence="2">90 HERPETOLOGICA [Vol. 40, No. 1 diurnal baskers with precise thermoregu- lation, (2) diurnally active species with low activity temperatures, and (3) nocturnal species. This is not merely a listing of species in categories but a discussion of species or groups with well-defined or un- usual thermoregulatory patterns. There are fewer data for amphisbaenians, snakes, Sphenodon, crocodilians and turtles, but where the information is sufficient, Avery divides the species into functional groups with regard to thermoregulatory behav- ior. There are 13 tables listing the species for which activity temperatures have been recorded, but unfortunately those data are not included; the original references must be consulted. G. A. Bartholomew discusses the phys- iological mechanisms by which reptiles control their body temperature. There are separate sections on lizards, crocodilians, turtles, Sphenodon and snakes. Where data permit, there is discussion of the roles of behavior, the integument, the cardio- vascular system, evaporative cooling, heat production, temperature sensors, and tol- erance of low and high temperatures for each group. There are sufficient data to permit generalizations only for lizards. In a particularly interesting section, Bartho- lomew points out the thermoregulatory significance to lizards of the linkage be- tween changes in integumentary reflec- tance, absorption of incident radiation, lo- cal changes in subdermal circulation, and heat transfer. It is interesting that al- though turtles have substantial control over peripheral blood flow and thus the rate of change of body temperature, the ther- moregulatory significance of such phys- iological control is small in comparison with the control which can be exerted by behavioral means such as postural change and selection of microhabitat. It seems that there have been fewer recent major ad- vances in our understanding of the phys- iological control of body temperature in reptiles than there have been in other areas reviewed in this book; much remains to be learned. B. J. Firth and J. S. Turner had a for- midable task in chapter six: to discuss sen- sory, neural and hormonal aspects of ther- moregulation. To my knowledge, no such review has been attempted previously, for good reason. Although there have been numerous studies of sensory, neural and endocrine physiology of reptiles, few have dealt directly with thermoregulation and fewer still with its ecological aspects. Firth and Turner have been cautious in linking information from these diverse areas to explain physiological mechanisms of ther- moregulation. They present a number of hypotheses ripe for testing. The chapter considers sensory, neural and hormonal aspects of behavioral thermoregulation, thermal acclimation and acclimatization, and hibernation. There is strong evidence that reptiles have a dual threshold control system for body temperature which pro- duces a clustering of body temperatures which, when graphed, suggest that the an- imal is thermoregulating around a single set point. Data are beginning to show that acclimation to photoperiod and tempera- ture influence not only the critical ther- mal maximum (at which paralysis of nerve conduction occurs) but also neurotrans- mitter concentrations in critical brain cen- ters. The authors note that part of the changes in peripheral circulation that ac- company heating and cooling may be the result of changes in blood viscosity; dif- ferences between heating and cooling rates may not be specific thermoregulatory ad- aptations but rather the necessary conse- quence of regional heterothermy. There is a clear need for more research in the sensory, neural and endocrine aspects of thermoregulation. The application of biophysical models to the study of the physiological ecology of reptiles is the topic discussed by C. R. Tracy, who presents equations used in modeling energy exchange and water bal- ance. He then discusses each of the terms in the equations, with respect to both the physics and biology involved, and points out how such equations can be used to model the physical environment of rep- tiles. Useful models should have predic-</page><page sequence="3">March 1984] HERPETOLOGICA 91 tive power; a recent model of the climate space that can be occupied by a garter snake predicts that subtrate type will have a pronounced effect on the ability of the snakes to thermoregulate effectively. Tra- cy then discusses the application of mod- elling in three areas of reptilian biology: internal heat transfer during heating and cooling in lizards and alligators; utilization of time and space by lizards in different thermal environments; and water budgets of different types of reptile eggs. The ap- proach described here can help identify important variables in the interaction be- tween a reptile and its environment. Tra- cy points out a number of questions that can be answered from such biophysical models. It is clear from this chapter that our current knowledge permits precious few such models to be built. The first chapter dealing with reptilian water relations is by J. E. Minnich who reviews the regulation of body fluids, the acquisition of water, and the regulation of water losses. Minnich presents many data on osmotic and ionic regulation and fre- quently points out environmental corre- lations. An especially interesting section concerns ionic and osmotic balance by reptiles placed in fresh water, sea water, and conditions of severe drought. For ex- ample, Minnich describes several North American desert reptiles that are strongly herbivorous and thus have a high potas- sium intake. Nevertheless, they exhibit good regulation of plasma potassium and do not accumulate this cation even when dehydrated. In contrast, Australian lizards with a high sodium intake show a marked sodium accumulation when dehydrated. In the section on acquisition of water, Minnich points out that, unlike certain desert rodents, Dipsosaurus dorsalis can- not produce enough metabolic water to balance that lost by evaporation only; thus if no preformed water is available, the liz- ard will be in negative water balance. The author also summarizes some unique methods of acquiring water in reptiles: drinking of water carried along the sur- face scales by capillarity in Moloch; drinking of water droplets which con- dense from water vapor by lizards and a snake; and the use by certain tortoises of their shell as a "rain gutter." Minnich con- cludes that much of our knowledge is de- scriptive and that we need studies that ex- amine control mechanisms for water and ions in reptiles. H. B. Lillywhite and P. F. A. Maderson discuss the structure and permeability of reptile skin. This chapter is strong on structure and weak on physiological ecol- ogy-not because of any fault of the au- thors but because of the nature of the top- ic and the literature available. The authors discuss the basic morphology of the rep- tilian integument and make clear that it is much less homogeneous than mamma- lian skin, both vertically and horizontally. They note that there is much speculation but few data on the role of the skin in permeability. I found it most intriguing that the state of hydration of reptile skin affects its permeability: wet reptile skin passes water fairly readily; dehydration reduces water transport and loss. The au- thors lay to rest the notion that the hinge region between scales is the site of most water loss; experiments with skin and ob- servations of scaleless snakes reveal that the hinge region does not have high per- meability and that scales per se are not necessary for reducing water loss. Recent studies in which the corneous materials of the skin were stripped away with cello- phane indicate that the layer containing a-keratin, and not that with f-keratin, is the normal water barrier. It appears that keratin per se is not responsible for re- tarding water loss but rather the lipids which are interspersed with it. In discuss- ing the permeability to water, ions and gases of the skin of aquatic reptiles, Lil- lywhite and Maderson note that the fact that freshwater snakes die in sea water more quickly than marine snakes is due to the greater permeability of freshwater snake skin to salts: these species gain salts rapidly, develop thirst quickly, drink sea water, and suffer the fatal consequences. The authors point out that we lack a good</page><page sequence="4">92 HERPETOLOGICA [Vol. 40, No. 1 understanding of the physiological mech- anisms underlying transport of water by reptile skin. In chapter 10, W. J. Mautz discusses patterns of evaporative water loss by rep- tiles. The section on theoretical consider- ations should have a large impact on fu- ture studies because of the rigorous treatment given to the various factors that influence water loss; Mautz presents equa- tions relating the variables that determine respiratory, cutaneous and ocular routes of evaporation. Loss of water via the latter route is probably of greater importance than previously recognized. Allometry, and its relationship to water loss, is also discussed. It strikes me as strange that in many studies it is assumed that change in body size is not accompanied by a change in water loss per unit surface area; this seems unlikely in view of the changes in skin thickness (and perhaps composition) that often accompany growth. Mautz pre- sents a table of all previously reported data on water loss by reptiles and analyzes the data for the influence of body size and habitat. In all habitat groups, there is a decline in evaporative water loss (mg g- h-') with increasing size; high evaporative loss in small reptiles is matched by their relatively high rates of metabolic water production and intake of preformed water. Further work relating evaporative water loss to microclimates and behavior are clearly needed, as are studies on the influ- ence of acclimation on water loss. In the final chapter, K. A. Nagy sum- marizes studies on water relations of rep- tiles in the field, most of which were car- ried out with isotopically labelled water. When the water flux (= influx = efflux) rate of reptiles in water balance is re- gressed on body size, it is apparent that tropical and subtropical reptiles have higher rates of water flux but a lower rate of increase in flux as size increases than do arid-region reptiles. Nagy calculates that a 100 g arid-habitat reptile should have a water flux that is 15% of that of a 100 g mammal or bird, but relative to their respective metabolic rates, the reptile will lose water faster than the similarly-sized endotherms. The author presents field water budgets for the three species of des- ert lizards that have been studied in ade- quate detail and calculates that a desert lizard cannot maintain water balance on a diet of dry seeds alone whereas some desert endotherms can. In sum, this book lives up to the high standards of the preceding volumes in this series. The authors not only review recent developments but also critically appraise the current status of the various areas. The voluminous tables and lists of references make access to the original literature easy. The authors define many areas ripe for further work: an unfortunately large per- centage of the studies cited are with liz- ards (especially iguanids); our knowledge of the physiological ecology of other groups is much less adequate. Most studies have been descriptive in nature; investi- gations of the underlying mechanisms are clearly warranted. The authors have met with varying degrees of success in really describing physiological ecology, not be- cause of any lack of competence but be- cause of the various degrees of develop- ment of the fields they discuss. The editors succeeded in eliminating dual coverage of topics and have assured well-focused chapters. I found only four typographical errors. The author and subject indexes are complete and the paper stock, printing and binding are first rate. The cost will deter (and perhaps render indignant) many po- tential buyers, but this volume belongs on the shelf of all professional herpetological ecologists, physiologists and physiological ecologists, as well as in most college and all university libraries.
