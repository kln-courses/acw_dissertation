<plain_text><page sequence="1">Frank Paul Bowman (Berkeley) BENJAMIN CONSTANT, GERMANY, AND DE LA RELIGION The thought of Benjamin Constant evolved considerably be tween the second half of 1785, when he first contemplated a study on religion, and 1824, when De la religion began to appear1). Exactly how and when the book changed remains largely un known but the question is of considerable interest, for Constant's evolution parallels the general historical movement from Enlight enment to Romanticism. The Cahier rouge recounts how he originally conceived the work as an application of the principles of eighteenth-century philosophy, especially those of Helv?tius, to the comparative study of religion; his purpose was to attack Christianity 2). Constant was ever grateful that his sloth, usually the object of remorse, kept him from completing this original project. Among the new acquisitions of the fonds Estournelles at Lau sanne 3) there is a brief text by Constant, of interest as an exam ple of Franco-German intellectual relations and which also reveals some of the principles of the evolution of De la religion. The text, in the hand of a copyist, is in box 15 and attached to a lengthy study ?Des passions religieuses et de leurs rapports avec la morale". I have modernized the orthography. 1) De la religion consid?r?e dans sa source, ses formes, et ses d?veloppe ments. 5 vols.

On a fait de l'?tre supr?me une esp?ce d'instituteur du genre humain, conduisant les hommes par des instructions et par des r?v?lations successives ? un perfection nement progressif. Ce syst?me a ?t? imagin? dans l'Allemagne protestante pour d?vier le passage de la religion r?v?l?e au th?isme pur ou au scepticisme, et pour m?nager ? la th?ologie une retraite honorable, et il a servi dans cette partie de l'Europe, mieux peut-?tre que n'e?t pu le faire une philosophie plus hardie, ? consacrer les droits de la libert? des opinions. Il nous para?t en cons?quence que son histoire et ses maximes m?ritent quelques d?tails. Lorsque Fr?d?ric II monta sur le tr?ne, il y porta l'indiff?rence ou plut?t le m?pris pour toutes les religions. Il appela pr?s de lui plusieurs philosophes fran?ais, ennemis acharn?s du christia nisme. Les attaques contre la croyance des Chr?tiens se multi pli?rent ? l'abri de la protection d'un Roi. Les th?ologiens prus siens se crurent oblig?s de d?fendre leur doctrine. Par une suite de la libert? dont tous jouissaient, chacun entreprit cette d?fense ? sa mani?re. Les uns s'attach?rent ? l'ancien syst?me et cher ch?rent leurs armes dans les miracles et les proph?ties. D'autres renon?ant, les uns plus, les autres moins, ? ces ressources us?es, mirent en avance la morale comme la partie la plus inattaquable de la religion, et rejet?rent dans le lointain sa partie historique, traditionelle et surtout miraculeuse. Ainsi s'op?ra dans le pro testantisme de l'Allemagne une r?volution qui n'est pas sans quelque analogie avec celle qu'avaient op?r?e les pr?tres de l'an cienne Rome dans leur paganisme emprunt? des Grecs. Ceci ne se fit pas n?anmoins tout ? coup. Les th?ologiens novateurs battaient en retraite: ils n'abandonnaient chaque poste qu'? regret, et il est vraisemblable que ce qu'ils appellent aujourd'hui des perfectionnements leur paraissait alors des sacrifices. Ce qui le prouve, c'est qu'ils m?connaissaient eux-m?mes les principes de la tol?rance. S?rs de n'?tre pas pers?cut?s, ils auraient r?clam?</page><page sequence="3">Benjamin Constant, Germany, and De la religion 79 volontiers un peu de pers?cution pour ceux d'entre eux, qui, trouvant leur ligne de d?fense intenable, voulaient reculer quel ques pas de plus, mais ils avaient ? leur insu d?cid? sans retour de leur destin?e, d?s le moment qu'ils s'?taient permis de r?voquer en doute une partie quelconque de leur ancienne croyance. Gom me toutes les v?rit?s se tiennent, ils recul?rent toujours davantage. On suit, pour ainsi dire, en lisant leurs ouvrages, les traces de leur retraite, et, vers la fin du r?gne de Fr?d?ric, la religion chr?tienne n'?tait presque plus dans toute l'Allemagne protestante qu'une doctrine morale. Selon cette doctrine, Dieu est un ?tre puissant, juste, et bon; l'homme est susceptible de perfectionne ment; l'intention de Dieu est qu'il se perfectionne. Il lui en fournit le moyen par des r?v?lations successives; il proportionne ces r?v? lations ? l'?tat o? l'homme se trouve au moment o? il lui accorde ses faveurs. De l? les absurdit?s ou les erreurs qu'on reproche aujourd'hui aux r?v?lations. Elles ?taient proportionn?es aux fa cult?s de l'homme dans un ?tat tr?s diff?rent du n?tre et tr?s inf?rieur. Une r?v?lation n'est point une chose immuable et qu'il faille conserver dans son ?tat primitif; c'est une chose au con traire qu'il faut faire marcher de front avec les lumi?res et d? gager successivement de tout ce qui ne sert plus ? son but. Les miracles, par exemple, soit qu'on les consid?re comme des signes surnaturels de la puissance c?leste, ou comme des ph?nom?nes de la nature dont la cause ?tait encore inconnue, les miracles ?taient des preuves valables et n?cessaires dans les temps o? ils ont eu lieu. Les hommes ?taient trop peu ?clair?s pour ?tre con vaincus par le raisonnement: il leur fallait des preuves courtes et frappantes. Les miracles ?taient parfaitement convenables. Il en est de m?me des myst?res, de m?me des proph?ties. Aujourd'hui il nous faut des preuves tout ? fait diff?rentes. C'est par le raisonnement, la morale, le sentiment du beau, de l'honn?te, de l'utile qu'il faut nous convaincre. La religion juive ?tait pro portionne?e ? l'esprit et aux moeurs du peuple juif. Dieu, comme Solon, donne ? l'homme, non les meilleures lois possibles, mais les meilleures lois qu'ils puissent recevoir.</page><page sequence="4">80 Frank Paul Bowman La r?v?lation juive amenait le peuple juif jusqu'? l'?poque o? il a ?t? en ?tat de s'en passer, et la religion chr?tienne ?tait aussi proportionn?e au temps o? elle a paru. Nous avons fait des progr?s; la religion doit en faire de pareils. La r?formation a ?t? une ?poque. C'est aujourd'hui le moment d'une seconde. Toutes les opinions visiblement abstraites ou contradictoires, la satisfaction par la mort de J?sus Christ, ce dogme qu'un auteur fran?ais appelait le sacrifice d'un ?tre innocent ? un ?tre bon pour appaiser un ?tre juste, l'?ternit? des peines, la nature divine du Messie, la Trinit? etc. sont des disputes de mots, des subtilit?s contraires ? l'intention du fondateur du christianisme et ? l'esprit de son institution. Telle est la doctrine plus ou moins clairement manifest?e des th?ologiens les plus ?clair?s de l'Allemagne. Ils ?crivent en cons? quence des trait?s de th?ologie adapt?s aux besoins du temps, des essais sur la condescendance de Dieu envers les hommes et sur la marche graduelle des r?v?lations. Je ne m'arr?terai pas ? faire des objections contre ce syst?me: elles se pr?senteraient en foule. Il ne r?pond en rien aux difficult?s connues sur l'exi stence de Dieu. Ces difficult?s acqui?rent m?me une force addi tionelle. A l'hypoth?se fondamentale se joint une hypoth?se plus arbitraire sur le mode d'existence, sur les progr?s et sur les moyens. Mais il serait bien inutile de d?velopper ces objections, puisque ce syst?me aboutit ? une libert? compl?te et ind?finie pour les opinions individuelles et ? l'abolition de toute religion positive. En ?tablissant qu'il faut perfectionner les religions, on laisse un champ libre aux lumi?res et l'on consacre les seuls vrais principes de la tol?rance. Le hasard m?me a forc? les th?o logiens de l'Allemagne ? proclamer ces principes de la mani?re la plus formelle. A la mort du grand Fr?d?ric, les illumin?s qui gouvernaient au nom de son successeur voulurent venger la religion des longs outrages qu'elle avait soufferts. Des ?dits dict?s par des spectres, et sortis du fond d'un s?rail prohib?rent toute d?viation de l'ancienne doctrine. Sur ces ?dits, les novateurs qui se croyaient encore les d?fenseurs de la religion, se trouv?rent les ennemis. Les th?ologiens qui ?taient rest?s fermes dans le</page><page sequence="5">Benjamin Constant, Germany, and De la religion 81 retranchement des id?es anciennes, et qui s'?taient refus?s ? toute capitulation, loin de leur savoir gr? de leur z?le, les trait?rent d'apostates et de faux fr?res. Alors ils n'eurent de ressource que d'invoquer les principes de la libert? religieuse illimit?e. Ils procla m?rent que la religion n'?tait qu'un objet d'examen, que chaque homme devait choisir pour lui-m?me, et rester libre de toute contrainte dans la question la plus importante de la vie pr?sente et future. Or, avec ces maximes, tous les syst?mes religieux sont admissibles. Tous doivent ?tre respect?s. L'on me pardonne, je l'esp?re, cette digression, si c'en est une. La r?volution que je viens de d?crire a eu sur une nation sage, ?clair?e, studieuse et impartiale, une influence trop marqu?e pour qu'on puisse la con sid?rer sans int?r?t. C'est de l'Allemagne protestante, que nous reviendront peut-?tre beaucoup de v?rit?s qu'il est de mode aujourd'hui parmi nous de d?daigner, parce qu'il a ?t? longtemps de mode parmi nous d'agir en sens contraire de ces v?rit?s, en les invoquant. This text presents an interesting example of the penetration, or perhaps lack of penetration, of German thought into nineteenth century France. Although Constant visited Germany on numerous occasions, studied at German universities, was familiar with Ger man literature and philosophy, and served with Charles de Villers and Mme de Sta?l to introduce this thought into France, these pages certainly offer a superficial picture of the content and evolution of German theology in the latter part of the eighteenth century; a comparison with the fourth part of De VAllemagne, probably written in late 1809, is entirely to Constant's disadvan tage4). Constant seems to have known only some of the trends of German theology, and mistakenly considers them merely a 4) Before being too critical, it is well to remember that as late as 1838 Edgar Quinet still complained that no one in France knew anything about German theology ?

He grew in knowledge, and could here again be thankful for his sloth; when he came to treat the same subject in Book I, Chapter vi of De la religion he had made some radical changes. This later text serves as a conclusion to a long study, ?De la mani?re dont on a jusqu'ici envisag? les religions", which attacks those who seek to strengthen shaky beliefs at any price and their opposites who see in religion only a grave, nefa rious error. Constant's sympathy is for the disciples of a simple, natural religion, of whom F?nelon is an example. In France, religious questions have usually been treated superficially and always with prejudice; in England, despite the Reformation, the Establishment has made religion dogmatic and impeded any free, impartial discussion. Such discussion has been possible in Germany thanks to the widespread conviction that all is progres sive in man. The Germans know what the French are too self satisfied to recognize, that man's ideas and institutions, including his religious customs and beliefs, necessarily change as man him self changes. Constant then describes a particular circumstance which has confirmed in Germany this belief in progress, and recounts the tale of Frederick II. But the French philosophes are now termed, Voltaire excepted, ?m?diocres et subalternes"; their German imi tators (here named ? Wieland, Nicolai, Lessing) were ?bien su p?rieurs ? leurs tristes mod?les" (128). Before recounting the reac tion, he inserts a long development to the effect that ?l'esprit allemand, m?ditatif par nature, trop grave pour ?tre longtemps distrait par des plaisanteries . . . , le caract?re allemand enclin ? l'enthousiasme et ne trouvant de bonheur dans la religion comme dans l'amour, que par l'exaltation et la r?verie, r?pugnaient l'un et l'autre ? des doctrines arides, tranchantes, devenues dogma tiques". As he describes the reaction, he follows the earlier text, though omitting the remark that ?les th?ologiens novateurs battaient en retraite"; nor does he accuse them of lacking tole rance. He goes immediately to the death of Frederick II and</page><page sequence="7">Benjamin Constant, Germany, and De la religion 83 the reactions it provoked, keeping his images of spectres and seraglios but adding a comparison with political reactions ? for Constant is now a leader of the liberal opposition under the Bourbon restoration. The passage about ?les opinions visiblement contradictoires" is suppressed; such direct attacks on Christianity are nowhere found in De la religion. The explanation of miracles is put in a note, and placed between quotation marks, as coming from an unidentified German theologian; to this is added a discussion of John Craigs, a seventeenth-century English theo logian, and another comparing this concept of gradual revelation with the Hindu belief in the successive incarnations of the deity, reflecting Constant's Orientalist investigations. The whole beginning of the final paragraph has been replaced by a brief remark suggesting that if this ?surnaturel restreint doit m?contenter les d?vots et d?plaire aux philosophes", il nonetheless contains ?le germe d'une pens?e neuve et importante. Le syst?me. . . n'aurait plus qu'un pas ? faire pour ?carter de la religion cette tendance ?troite et hostile qui suppose la v?rit? un don du hasard ou du caprice, et condamne ? des peines ?ternelles ceux qui, sans leur faute, ont ?t? priv?s de cette v?rit?4' (134). A note is added which, in line with Constant's (and Romanticism's) syncretist tendencies, praises Greek and Roman religion as a ?bienfait de la Providence". Finally, he suggests this system was too anthropomorphic to satisfy either the reason or the sentiment; but there is nothing like the accusation in the earlier text that a system of this sort only increases the difficulties about the existence of God. The passage concerning Frederick's death, now put earlier, is replaced by a lengthy description of another German hypothesis not mentioned in the first text, the theory of G?rres, Creuzer, and others, that religion is the universal language of nature, expressed through different myths, dogmas and symbols but possessing a real, mysterious unity. Constant agrees that ,,il y a plus d'un c?t? juste dans cette hypoth?se" which he trusts will soon replace Dupuis' false ideas, but, in accord with his belief in progress, he suggests that this language has varied according to ?des lois fixes, qui ont 6*</page><page sequence="8">84 Frank Paul Bowman leur origine dans le coeur humain". He especially disagrees with the idea that the priestly caste might possess a truth at a moment when the people could not understand that truth, for De la religion is largely an attack on the nefarious influence of the sacerdoce. There are, then, considerable differences between the two texts. The attacks on Christianity have been replaced by attacks on the French philosophes. Constant, while not accepting the system he discribes, now tempers his sympathetic criticism with consider able praise. Much material has been added, revealing his increased learning and showing his syncretist notions. He is more aware of the developments of German thought on religious anthro pology. Finally, the second text insists more fully that religion is a sentiment innate to man, with its own rules of progressive evolution. In the earlier text, Constant discusses the question of reve lation ? of the source of religious truth ? which was an especially important problem in the development of De la religion. Thanks in large part to Kant 5), Constant, together with many of his contemporaries6), moved from Locke's sensationalism to the belief that certain intellectual and moral notions were innate in man; among these was the sentiment religieux. But this sen 5) See the excellent article of B. Munteano, ?Episodes kantiens en Suisse et en France sous le Directoire," Revue de litt?rature compar?e, XV (1935), 387?459, though I do not agree that . C. 's later notions about the con tingencies of morals involved a complete rejection of Kant. Throughout De la religion, the ethics of ?Pint?r?t bien entendu" are rejected in favor of an innate, transcendant concept of duty; and I suspect a careful study of B. C. 's political liberalism would indicate, beneath that concern with the dic tates of contingencies which laid him open to the charge of opportunism, a basic intransigeant idealism. 6) Including, for instance, Cabanis whose study of temperaments led him to believe in innate predispositions and psychological traits (v. OEuvres, Paris (1824), III, 128); it is this Cabanis ? who also believed in a progress certified by the hereditary transmission of acquired traits ? and not the disciple of Condillac, one must think of when B. C. writes: ?Visite ? Cabanis. Caus? sur mon ouvrage. Il aura l'approbation de tous les hommes de cette opinion" (Journal, March 2, 1805).</page><page sequence="9">Benjamin Constant, Germany, and De la religion 85 timent, at least in its expressions, changed and even progressed. The question was, what role did revelation play in this process of change? Constant's final attitude is certainly different from that expressed in this early text. De la religion was (after much hesitation) written as a historical study, with the doctrine of progress an assumption. One might say that Constant accepted the secularized eschatology of the eighteenth century and tried to apply it again to religion, but could only do so by positing for the religious sentiment an innately progressive nature. This idea could hardly be reconciled with the Christian notion that God gave himself to man at a particular moment in history, but this notion Constant did not accept (II 445?6, V 54). He rather maintained that the divine revelation is universal, successive and individual, i. e., not limited to any one group or historical moment but given to each man at each moment, and finally completely interior. Revelation is then admittedly identical with the sentiment religieux: ?Que ce que nous nommons r?v?lation, enseignement de la Providence, lumi?re due ? sa sagesse et ? sa bont?, d'autres l'appellent sentiment intime, d?veloppement d'un germe d?pos? dans l'?me humaine, peu nous importe. Pour qui croit en Dieu, toute lumi?re vient de lui, comme tout ce qu'il y a en nous de bien et de noble; et la r?v?lation est partout o? il y a quelque chose de vrai, de noble et de beau" (II 221). This purely pietist view of the source of religious truth is even more weakened by the immediate association of the religious with the ethical. But the difficulty was to reconcile this notion of revelation with the doctrine of progress; for if ,,la r?v?lation est partout", and not particularized in some way, there is no progress. So Constant developed, thanks in large part to the ideas of the German school here disparaged, a particularized notion of reve lation which, because it solved his dilemma, should not be considered only a sop thrown to possible Christian critics. Within his basic dialectic (the sentiment creates a form which the priestly caste fixes, whereas the sentiment continues to progress and hence becomes dissatisfied with this form), a particular revelation could and did serve to provide a new form which</page><page sequence="10">86 Frank Paul Bowman would satisfy the needs of the sentiment. Such were the Mosaic theist revelation (II 249) and the revelation of Jesus. He even goes so far as to suggest that man by himself does not have enough force to create a new form, as witnessed by the futility of the neo-Platonic efforts at reconstruction (II 236). The new forms are divinely revealed. ?Qui oserait dire que la piti? c?leste ne soit pas venue au secours du monde, qu'un ?clair n'ait pas sillon? la nue, pour montrer la route ? notre race ?gar?e . . . Tout serait ensuite rentr? dans l'ordre" (Du polyth?isme, II 234). For such revelations are only ,,des secours accord?s par un ?tre puissant et bon ? un ?tre ignorant et faible, quand ses forces ne suffisent pas ? son am?lioration" (II 211); the message is apportioned to the intelligence to which it is directed, and is in accord with historical trends (V 205). So God gives man the truth by both inner, and historical or outer revelation; but histo rical revelation does not change man's nature ? he must still struggle continually to express his sentiment or realize his ideals. Constant did not consider the revelation of Jesus a final one; progress continues, and Constant, like many of his contempora ries, dreamed of the new faith to come. Insofar as he came to accept this German theological notion of exterior revelation, unsympathetically presented in this early text, Constant separated himself from the tradition which had been busy secularizing the notion of history. Though he would have been most displeased if any one had pointed it out to him, by admitting that history could be teleologically conceived as revealing in the crises of the form-sentiment dialectic the hand of God at work, Constant is closer to Joseph de Maistre than he is to Voltaire. It is possible to date this text with a degree of certainty. First, it was clearly written after Constant had acquired a measure of familiarity with German theological thought. One can discount the trip to Erlangen in 1782, and although he worked on religion during his second stay at Brunswick (April-July 1794) and even visited the library at G?ttingen he was later to use so much,</page><page sequence="11">Benjamin Constant, Germany, and De la religion 87 he was then more concerned with the study of classical anti quity; it was not until 1804, and his stay in Weimar, that he became very familiar with German theology. The contents of the rest of box 15 help to date the text, and also to clarify the state of his beliefs at the time. The manuscript, ?Des passions religieuses et de leur rapport avec la morale", is organized in a most encyclopedic manner. There are three sorts of religious passions: enthusiasm, superstition, and fana ticism. Enthusiasm exists when the divinity offers the faithful special protection; superstition when the divinity is severe and demanding. Fanaticism combines the violence of enthusiasm with the grief and suffering of superstition. The next chapter discusses ?Des circonstances et des dogmes dans leurs rapports avec ces passions"; hope excites enthusiasm, fear superstition. ?Le chris tianisme, avant que le temps l'e?t ?pur?, et aussi longtemps qu'il excita des passions religieuses, ne produisit que la superstition ou le fanatisme". After comparing the effects of these three passions, Constant discusses ?Pourquoi nous avons tir? du th?isme plusieurs de nos exemples sur les passions religieuses". The text probably represents one of the many efforts, men tioned in the Journal for 1804?1805, to rewrite his Polyth?isme in a didactic, rather than historical form with as its main concern the relations between morals and religion. Constant was afraid he would be drowned in his erudition; he was also afraid of the attacks of the specialists. The tension between a historical study and a didactic one is the source of most of the recastings of the work mentioned by the Journal during those years. His occasional purpose was to write a book demonstrating that reli gin did not provide a sound basis for morals. This is then in all probability a draft of the ?livre sur les passions religieuses" men tioned on numerous occasions 7). Indeed, the tenor of the thought, the very organization, suggest an early text where the analytical procedures of the eighteenth-century philosophes still exercised 7) Journal, Sept. 18, 1804 and Feb. 19 and 20, March 6, 1805; for referen ces to the Journal, I have only provided the dates. Either the Pl?iade edition or the Gallimard edition, ed. Roulin and Roth, 1952, is satisfactory.</page><page sequence="12">88 Frank Paul Bowman a strong influence, where every subject had to be divided into its elements and these classified in terms of their effect when operating in conjunction with other influences. The final text of De la religion still shows traces of this sort of thinking (e. g., in discussing climate, though even there, pace Montesquieu and Sta?l, Constant often concludes that the same effects occur in different sorts of climate) but, thanks in large part to Herder, it is usually marked by a more typically Romantic concern with the importance of the collective historical devenir, identified with an eternally progressing power 8). This manuscript, which is attached to our text and in the same hand, also contains in passing the observation that only religious wars are legitimate, because in all other wars (of conquest, etc.) one of the two sides is always in the wrong; in religious wars both sides believe they are in the right. This strange idea, which suggests a regrettable ignorance of Erasmus' Querella pacis, Constant owed to A. W. Schlegel, who transmitted it to him on June 11, 1804 (v. Journal). So our text was probably written after that date. The syllogism is nowhere repeated. I am glad to say, in De la religion. Our text can also be associated with the remark in the Journal for Jan. 10, 1805, that Constant was contemplating contributing with Villers to a Biblioth?que germanique the Institut had con ceived, ,,donnant un coup d'oeil sur la marche de la th?ologie allemande dans le dernier si?cle ... le d?bouch? pour mes id?es sur ces divers sujets d?barrasserait mon ouvrage de plusieurs parties h?t?rog?nes qui y sont d?plac?es et que je regrette parce qu'elles ont une v?ritable valeur". This project, as far as I know, never came to fruition. One might also note his explosion, July 5, 1804, against the theists who want to burn the atheists without 8) On the important influence of Herder on Constant see Tronchon, La Fortune intellectuelle de Herder en France (Paris, 1920), p. 310?360, and M. Cambieri, ?L'Opera religiosa di . Constant e i nuovi ?journaux intimes," Nuova antologia, CCCCLXIV (1955), 267?284, and finally the unpublished thesis of Hilda M. Bowers, Les Id?es religieuses de B. Constant, Paris, Facult? des Lettres, 1950.</page><page sequence="13">Benjamin Constant, Germany, and De la religion 89 realizing that then the Christians would burn the theists, and even more Feb. 4, 1804, the observation that ?chaque jour la religion protestante devient en Allemagne plus une chose de senti ment qu'une institution: point de formes, point de symboles, rien d'obligatoire, presque point de c?r?monies, rien que des id?es douces et une morale sensible. Le protestantisme de l'Angleterre est bien plus recul?", ideas also formulated and developed in the text quoted above. For all these reasons, I am tempted to conclude that this text cannot be earlier than late 1804, was probably written in 1805, and, as I shall shortly show, certainly before 1808. At what point in his long religious evolution was Constant in 1804?1805? He had travelled far from his 1785 position, but still had some distance to go. In 1785, he was an avowed atheist; in 1804, he wrote: ?Observation assez ing?nieuse: la religion est sur tout touchante pour qui n'y croit gu?re. Je suis toujours ?mu quand je vois prier" (17 Feb.); in 1805, he goes further: ?II y a dans l'irr?ligion quelque chose de grossier et d'us? qui me r?pugne. D'ailleurs, j'ai mon coin de religion. Mais il est tout en sentiments, en ?motions vagues; il ne peut se r?duire en syst?me" (19 Feb.), attitude which accords with our text. In 1814, suffering from the indifference of Mme R?camier, he wrote: ?Pri?, Pleur?. La pri?re soulage. O Dieu mis?ricordieux! je te remercie. Si l'affreuse dou leur revient, je prierai et je pleurerai jusqu'? ce qu'elle soit pass?e" (4 Oct.). To outline in detail all the steps in this evolution would be to write an intellectual biography of Constant ? for much more is at stake than the quality of his belief. The tension between faith and reason, between form (ritual) and content (piety), the doc trine of progress, the redefinition, after the Revolution, of the liberal tradition, the nature of enthusiasm and sentiment, the role of scholarship and learning in early nineteenth-century France ? all these are important in the development of De la religion. For our purpose, it suffices to emphasize what seem to have been the four major moments: the contact with Mme de Sta?l between 1794 and 1803, with German scholarship in 1804 and 1805, with</page><page sequence="14">90 Frank Paul Bowman Quietism in 1807 and 1808, and the consequent revision of the work between 1809 and 1812. The youthful piety of the precocious Benjamin Constant was early replaced by the cult of Voltaire, La Mettrie, Helv?tius, and other philosophes in whom he naturally sought and preferred the scandalous. His interest in comparative religion and religious sociology began already in Edinburgh, and in 1785, the Cahier rouge reveals, he conceived the project ?de contribuer pour ma part ? la destruction de ce que j'appelais les pr?jug?s. Je m'?tais empar? d'une assertion de l'auteur de YEsprit, qui pr?tend que la religion pa?enne ?tait de beaucoup pr?f?rable au christianisme; et je voulais appuyer cette assertion ... de quelques faits pris au hasard et de beaucoup d'?pigrammes et d'exclamations que je croyais neuves." 9) Any religious tendencies he may still have had were obliterated by Mme de Charri?re. He kept his interest, during his stay in Brunswick, in the comparative study of civilizations, but there is no sign that during those years his bitter despair was tempered by any sort of faith. This despair, however, did lead him to deny not only all divinity but the optimistic eighteenth-century credo as well. ?Ne pouvant croire aux promesses saugrenues et myst? rieuses d'une religion absurde ? beaucoup d'?gards, et ne voyant aucune pr?somption en faveur des esp?rances d'une philosophie qui ne consiste qu'en mots, je ne vois ici que beaucoup de peines in?vitables ... et au bout de cela, plut?t ou plus tard, le n?ant."10) A year later, his despair had produced a different attitude. ?Je ne suis du reste ni cr?dule ni incr?dule, ni moral ni immoral. Je ne vois aucune preuve, aucune probabilit? qu'il y ait un Dieu, quoique je vous jure que je d?sirerais bien qu'il y en e?t un.

Then came Mme de Sta?l, and her influence on Constant was immense. Mme de Charri?re, an atheist, had been indifferent to if not discouraging about his study of religion; Mme de Sta?l, more intellectual and more religious, urged Constant to seek glory by every possible means. One can trace, in her writings, her thoughts on religion during these years. In De Yinfluence des passions (1796), she defines religion as a force which, although not controlled by the will, does increase hope and offer protec tion from the vicissitudes of fate; nonetheless, its unfortunate excesses which include not only ?intol?rance superstitieuse" but also ?qui?tisme" and ?illuminisme" must be avoided (Sect. II, Ch. iv). In Delphine (1802), religion plays a major role. The novel is in many ways a pro-Protestant, anti-Catholic pamphlet, with divorce and confession the centers of controversy. Yet the heroine possesses an intense religious sensitivity, is often moved by reli gious ceremonies and prayers. The novel's strictures against a sacerdotal priesthood were to be echod in De la religion. Delphine favors a natural religion, where the power of love makes us aware of the immortal source of life; ,,plus les jouissances du coeur sont vives et pures, moins il nous est possible de nous r?signer aux bornes de cette vie." 12) This natural religion has a moral content which includes the notion of future recompense for present suffering Constant was to adopt. Justification is by works of charity. The main source of religious enthusiasm, how ever, seems to be grief and sorrow as known in earthly love. Mme de Sta?l's God is not so much the creator prime-mover as he is the source and essence of the naturally good passions of a naturally good man, still conceived in Rousseau's image. Mention should also be made of Des circonstances actuelles, written in 1798, where Herriot sees a close collaboration with Constant. 13) 12) Paris, 1854, p. 310. 13) Ed.

Religion is invaluable in a democratic state, and must be directed and encouraged, but not invented or controlled by the state. In short, she favors Protes tantism as a state religion for France. Constant had certainly become no Catholic convert during these years. In De la force du gouvernement actuel he direly pre dicted that a restoration of the Bourbons would produce a return to the evils of medieval Christianity, whereas for the heroes of the new republic truth must be their religion, the great men of antiquity their saints, history their legend and liberty their after life. But, thanks to the dispute about his nationality, in the same year he began to progagate and live the legend that his ancestors had been exiled from France because they were Protestants, thus re-identifying himself with his religious heritage. In August, 1796 he published an article in the Moniteur on the economic advan tages of letting the Protestants return; many of them, he asserts, will come back from Germany where ?les lumi?res ont connu d'?tonnants progr?s; il n'y a chez aucun peuple plus d'id?es sai nes, profondes et m?res." 14) If Des r?actions politiques in 1797 contains bitter attacks on Catholicism and Catholic converts, it also shows no sympathy for the ?ath?es fanatiques, sceptiques dogmateurs, incr?dules intol?rants." 15) During these years Con stant also developped his libertarian political philosophy (given discover, for Guillemin's thesis (Benjamin Constant muscadin (Paris, 1958), p. 238) that the work was not published at B. C. 's behest; at the time he probably shared Mme de Sta?l's attitudes on politics and religion. She more likley feared the disapproval of Necker, which fear kept her from publishing the R?flexions sur la paix int?rieure ? v.

This already led him, in Des suites de la contre-r?volution en Angleterre, to ad vocate tolerance of those religious practices some regard as a duty, others as a matter of indifference. In short, his attitude steadily became more open-minded. In 1800 Mme de Sta?l published De la litt?rature, which deve lops, among many other theses, her ?morals of enthusiasm", her notion that the impulsion toward virtue must come from some thing above and beyond the reason; only ,,1'intr?pide d?vouement de l'enthousiasme religieux" can provide a sound moral basis with which to oppose tyranny, an idea Constant echoed in the opening pages of De la religion. 16) Yet the letters of Talma, a major source of information on Constant during these years, give the picture of a man whose heritage of eighteenth-century atheism has been tempered only by some post-revolutionary wise cynicism. 17) On the other hand, there is Mme de Sta?l, praising religious enthusiasm, proposing liberal Protestantism as the state religion, claiming that the truly virtuous man must know religious sentiment and fervor, that enlightened self-interest is an insufficient moral code. There is not enough evidence to say what Constant himself believed, but certainly he had evolved from his despondent, cynical atheism of the early '90s, and in Mme de Sta?l he found formulated beliefs he later adopts. She was surely instrumental in giving shape and consistency to his evolving attitudes, and his scholarship in part elaborates and confirms ideas derived from her powerful in fluence. In that sense, like many a traveller, he found in Germany what he sought there. The next period in the evolution of Constant's religious thought goes from 1803 to 1807, the period, I believe, of our text, and also of his first full contact with German thought. For these years, thanks to the Journal, we have relatively full documen 16) Ed. Paul van Tieghem (Geneva, 1959), II, 277. 17) Lettres de Julie Talma ? Benjamin Constant (Paris, 1933).</page><page sequence="18">94 Frank Paul Bowman tation. Mme de Sta?l still exercised a great influence, but Con stant's relations with her were, to say the least, strained. This strain provoked in 1807 the first ?Quietist" crisis which was again to put De la religion in a different perspective. A close reading of the Journal reveals that many of the ideas expressed in De la religion were already present to Constant in 1804?1805, or that he derived them from his reading during those years. For instance, of the texts mentioned in Vol. I of the published work, a seventh are mentioned in the ,,full" Journal between January 1804 and May 1805, including many of the most important sources for the work ? the Asiatic Researches, Berger, B?ttiger, Creuzer, Meiners, Heeren, Herder, Heyne, W. Jones, Nicolai, Paulus, Voss and Wolff. Of course, Constant may have re-read these men, or read other works by them, at a later date. As for ideas, they can easily be marked off chronologically. On Jan. 30, 1804, a reading of Herder helps formulate the obser vation that ,,tout est bon, tout est mauvais, selon les temps, selon les lieux. Grande application de cette v?rit? dans mon ouvrage." On Feb. 18 he discovers in Wieland the highly important ,,distinc tion heureuse et ? conserver entre le sentiment religieux et les religions positives4', a distinction which has the advantage of eliminating the brutality of dogmatic atheism. By March 15, we learn through a letter to B?ttiger, he has read Wolff and got there his ideas on the dating of the Homeric poems. 18) On May 17, in a conversation with Schlegel, he becomes at least partially convinced that religious ideas have their origin, not ?dans l'im pression des objets ext?rieurs, mais dans le coeur de Thomme", an important break with the sensualist tradition of the philo sophes ? ,,les philosophes fran?ais ont eu tort en ne regardant la religion que comme un effet des objets ext?rieurs"; but the German ,,neo-Platonists", as he calls them, are also wrong in attaching no importance to the influence of exterior objects and in giving religion a purely mystical, supernatural origin.

On Nov. 8, a comparison of the Persians and the Greeks leads him to suspect that a general rule of religious progress might be ,,la puissance du sacerdoce, se fortifiant apr?s le f?tichisme, puis renvers?e par les guerriers"; not his final analysis, but at least he has already found his scapegoat, the sacerdoce. On Feb. 18, 1805 he announces that he has written a chapter on ,,les dangers de conserver dans le th?isme l'esprit du polyth?isme, c'est-?-dire l'anthropomorphisme", suggesting he has attached his own liberal ideas to the historical devenir he has been elaborating. Finally, on April 22 he completes a chapter on ?la diff?rence de la marche des religions soumises aux pr?tres et de celle des religions livr?es ? elles-m?mes. C'est l? la grande difficult? de mon ouvrage" ? the central element of the historical development had been discovered. All this new knowledge was at times absorbed with difficulty. Nowhere is this more clearly indicated than in Constant's reac tions to the theologian Schleiermacher. At a first reading on Nov. 14, 1804, he is almost purely negative. Schleiermacher s work contains ?le plus singulier syst?me qu'il soit possible d'imaginer dans un homme qui se pr?tend inspir?", and his claim that he is fulfilling a divine mission is incredible. Five days later, while still critical, Constant reacts against the form rather than the ideas, because in the latter he finds himself echoed. When Schleiermacher states that ,,une religion sans Dieu peut ?tre meilleure qu'une religion avec un Dieu", his apparent absurdity hides the important fact that ,,le sentiment religieux est tr?s compatible avec le doute"; it is only the way Schleier macher states the ideas which makes them seem ?Celles d'un fou" (Nov. 19, 1804). Here, as so often, it is difficult to speak of an ?influence", for Constant found formulated in Schleiermacher ideas he claims he already possessed. Nor could one maintain that these texts show any great comprehension of Schleiermacher's admittedly difficult but very influential system of theology. Such</page><page sequence="20">96 Frank Paul Bowman was, I fear, often the case with Constant, faced with German thought; he appreciated it insofar as it echoed his own ideas and aided the development of his own thought. He sought there argu ments to support his system and naturally enough these argu ments provoked some changes in that system. But all his reading contributed more to the stuffing of his book than to its structure, and had little effect on his own convictions. It is also important to remember that during these months, if the content of the book was becoming more and more defini tive, the form and even the purpose were not yet determined. Constant was still tempted to write a book which would be uni quely didactic, with a minimum of scholarly and historical pr? tentions, demonstrating the inadequacy of religion as a basis for morals. The only difficulty was that every time he tried to do so he found it impossible to make his point without resorting to his immense erudition. Nor is it only the final form and purpose of the book which are unsure. Constant's religious convictions, while no longer atheistic, are still heavily maked by his eighteenth- century heri tage. Thus he notes, Sept. 5, 1804, a propos the reactions to Villers' book on Luther, ,, croirait qu'il s'agit de savoir ce que nous choisirons, du protestantisme, ou du catholicisme, tandis qu'il y avait tout lieu de croire que nous ?tions d?barass?s de l'un et de l'autre", and on August 17 of the same year, he explicitly announces that ,,je veux prouver que, malgr? ses avan tages individuels, la religion a de tels inconv?nients qu'il n'en faut pas faire la base de la morale". Even if much of his research has been completed, if many of the ideas are already present, not only is the book not in final form but also his basic attitude on the utility of religion is not what it was to be in 1824. Sen sationalism has been in part abandoned, but in moral matters Constant is still an atheist, whereas in De la religion the ,,sen timent religieux" was to seem to him a necessary substitute for the morality of ,,1'int?r?t bien entendu". The final step was made possible by two things. First, he developed the distinction between sacerdotal and non-sacerdotal religions to the point where he</page><page sequence="21">Benjamin Constant, Germany, and De la religion 97 could attribute to the sacerdoce those evil traits he formerly attributed to all religion and maintain that religion, freed from sacerdotal influence, automatically followed the all-important law of progress which was the basis of his political, social, and moral thought. Until this intellectual discovery was made, his book and his thought remained largely ?encyclop?dique" ? as indeed our text demonstrates. But he also needed something else, a reli gious experience of his own, which was to occur in 1807?08, his contact with Quietism. This experience, while not a lasting one, was repeated later in his life and certainly affected his attitude toward religion and toward his book. He gave himself over to Quietism, the doctrine that man should pursue complete passivity and annihilation of the will, abandon himself to God without concern for his material or even spiritual welfare. Only mental prayer, which places us in the divine presence, is efficacious; all other acts, sacramental or moral, are irrelevant. In that presence, man can only do or think the will of God; he cannot sin. A small Quietist group in Lausanne, tracing its descendance from Mme Guyon, was headed at the beginning of the nineteenth century by Charles de Langal lerie, a distant cousin of Constant's; its faithful converts included his first cousin Lisette. The ideas of the group can be found in the various published sermons of their previous leader, Dutoit Membrini, especially the Philosophie chr?tienne, whose preface, probably by Langallerie, contains an attack on ?la lumi?re trom peuse de la raison" which must be replaced, as a guide for con duct, by ?la Foi et l'Amour"; man must turn to God and ?s'y perdre enfin de la plus heureuse perte"; there, ?vous oublierez l'univers; le monde dispara?tra pour vous comme s'il n'eut ja mais exist?; ses objets, ses attraits et ses charmes vous deviendront ? d?go?t". 19) It was to this temptation to give up the moral 19) (Geneva?, 1800), 2 vol., I, 14?16; the best brief study of this school remains A.

Mme de Sta?l had already turned to the sect in 1804, after the death of Necker, without lasting effect; but year after year her circle included more and more religious figures ? not only Schlegel and Mathieu de Montmorency, but as well such eccen trics as Mme de Kr?dener and Zacharias Werner. Mme de Kr? dener spent five days at Goppel in 1808, and there met Langal lerie who introduced her to the ideas of Mme Guyon and some what formed her spirituality; a few years later she retransmitted these ideas to Constant. The summers at Goppet in 1807, 1808 and 1809 became religious seminars. Of the group the most eccentric was certainly Werner, whose mother already thought she was the Virgin Mary; he developed a marvellous syncretism, with Osiris, Vichnu and Pythagoras his prophets, Mary-Isis and Ghrist-Horus his gods, and love his one doctrine. He later became a Roman Catholic priest, thereby provoking a break with Mme de Sta?l. 20) In 1807 Constant, frustrated in his desire to leave Mme de Sta?l and rejoin Charlotte, was close to despair over his domestic situation. On June 10 he already exclaimed: ?Mon Dieu, sauve nous des malheurs qui nous menacent et fais que nous vivions et soyons heureux ensemble." On August 2 and again August 18 he dined with Langallerie, and on the 19th had the bright idea of using the mystics to facilitate his separation from Mme de Sta?l; he explained this project to Langallerie on the 20th and 21st, and to Mme de Sta?l on the 24th, but was not sanguine: ?Je ne crois pas qu'elle puisse devenir d?vote malgr? tous ses besoins religieux. Il y a trop d'?go?sme et de vanit? dans cette t?te." 21) But Benjamin was to take himself the medicine he had prescribed for Germaine; already on August 21 he says: ?je me 20) For an unexpected, and more favorable presentation of Werner, see Custine's novel, Romuald, ou la vocation (Paris, 1848), I, 252 sq. 21) Journal, p. 347.

The Journal of September and October continues to express Quietist senti ments, which explode in December at the moment of Charlotte's illness; then there are moving entries such as ?Dieu bon et compatissant, pardonne-moi mes criminelles folies et tire-moi de ma difficile situation!" or ?J'ai tant pri? ces deux derniers jours. La pri?re est un grand soulagement". The whole experience is accurately recounted in C?cile, except for the project of subduing Mme de Sta?l through Quietism which is not mentioned. The novel clarifies how much this Quietism was a solution not only to the narrator's immediate difficulties but also to his basic problem of imposing the will on the vicis situdes of time. The narrator also asserts that the experience affected his esprit as well: ?La plupart des dogmes que j'avais rejet?s, l'existence de Dieu, l'immortalit? de l'?me, me parurent non pas d?montr?s par la logique, mais prouv?s par une sorte d'exp?rience int?rieure." 22) Once the pressure had disappeared, however, the religious fervor declined and in May, 1808 Constant wrote Rosalie that as for Langallerie, ?je suis un peu d?go?t? de son syst?me de r?signation passive". 23) The letters to Mme de Nassau, who did not share Rosalie's antipathy for Langallerie, still reveal a Quietist suspension of the will: ?je me laisse con duire en grande partie par la destin?e, parce que je crois qu'elle est pr?sid?e par une intelligence bienveillante: et depuis quelque temps, je trouve qu'elle me conduit aussi bien, peut-?tre mieux que je n'aurais pu esp?rer. Vous trouverez cette phrase un peu mystique ..." 24) C?cile itself reveals this continuing sympathy: ?Aujourd'hui m?me" writes the narrator, ?je ne sais si cet aban don ? la Providence n'est pas, au milieu de la nuit qui nous entoure, et avec l'insuffisance d'une raison douteuse et superbe, la plus s?re ressource de l'homme" (131).

This conviction had delivered him from ?le fardeau de mon individualit?"25). In a later letter to Barante, after announcing that he has been reading the mystics, and especially Mme Guyon, he offers a new definition of man; our consciousness is composed of senses and sentiments which are innate, and reflections, which result from our relations with outside objects. So reason is acquired by experience, and has nothing to do with religion; reason seems important only because language, of its domaine, is our means of expression; but we cannot ? trouver des paroles pour rendre aucune sensation ni du corps ni de l'?me" (idem, p. 263). Such a point of view leads him not only to prefer Bossuet to Voltaire (p. 250) but also to sympathize with the ?grand? impulsion religieuse qui semble imprim?e ? tous les esprits de notre si?cle" (p. 267). ?Ma religion consiste en deux points: vouloir ce que Dieu veut, c'est-?-dire lui faire l'hommage de notre coeur; ne rien nier, c'est-?-dire lui faire l'hommage de notre esprit... je ne sais plus du tout comme on pourrait vivre sur la terre. .. sans l'appui du ciel" (p. 269). In short, Constant now sought in religion a means of com muning with a force beyond himself so that he might face the vicissitudes of life without too much pain and sorrow. This involved a denial of the efficacy of the reason and an abandon ment of the will. 26) He turned to Quietism again, with even more vigor, during his crisis with Mme R?camier, scene Levaillant has 25) ?Lettres ? Prosper de Barante," Revue des deux mondes, XXXIV (1906), 262?3. 26) Indeed, it even involved recourse to superstition ? v.

Quietism was no simple fad for Constant, but a way out of his basic dilemma, the impossibility of impos ing upon a constantly changing and unreliable movement of time any continuous decision of the will. The man who gambled, or who ceased loving a woman before he finished declaring his love, here sought a means of abdicating that part of himself which made impermanence and change painful. Indeed, as much as his Quietism, his liberalism reflects this horror for all that is fixed and permanent, that is planned for the future. In the Journal, the phrases ?Q. 1. v. d. D. s. f." (?Que la volont? de Dieu soit faite") or ?Vogue la gal?re" constantly recur; he w7ants to ?se laisser rouler par les vagues du temps". 28) The reasoning will makes plans for the future, draws conclusions, is the me chanism of ?l'int?r?t bien entendu"; when Constant turned against it, he also turned against his neo-Helvetian project of De la religion. The pietistic liberalism of the final draft owes as much to Romantic irrationalism as does the reactionary Catho licism of a de Maistre or a Bonald. For a change took place in the magnum opus precisely at this time. During much of the period Constant was occupied with the adaptation of Wallstein, but in January, 1808 he announced to Fauriel 29) that the material of De la religion is almost all in order, and he is writing the last sections, elaborating the parallel of our age with the age of the fall of Rome (a parallel already found in Chateaubriand and how many others, an im portant Romantic notion because it permitted the conclusion that the beginning of the nineteenth century was to see the rise of a new religion, which various Romantics then attempted to for mulate; earlier, as in our text, Constant tends to draw a parallel between his age and the age of the Reformation). His new atti tude is clearly revealed in a letter to Barante of Oct. 21, 1808: 27) Les Amours de Benjamin Constant (Paris, 1958). 28) Barante, p. 262; Constant was fond of using water-images to reflect this abdication of the will. 29) In Glachant, Benjamin Constant sous oeil du guet (Paris, 1906), p. 117.</page><page sequence="26">102 Frank Paul Bowman ?je me replongerai dans mon ouvrage sur le Polyth?isme, que je ne me rappelle dans ce moment que d'une mani?re assez vague et surtout tr?s oppos?e ? la direction actuelle de mes id?es.

Mais le r?sultat est autre, et sans rien changer ? mes assertions sur la progression, je finirai tout diff?remment de ce que mes premi?res intentions encyclop?distes semblaient l'annon cer, ce qui m'oblige ? modifier une quantit? de petites phrases, ?crites dans le dix-huiti?me si?cle et pour lui, et qui ne doivent pas lui survivre" (p. 267). This took the form of recopying the work from one end to the other ?pour ?ter les queues encyclop? diques" (Barante, p. 272). Neither of Constant's two Quietist experiences converted him permanently. He wrote Rosalie in the summer of 1816: ?Que fait le Chevalier? Je m'?tais de nouveau rapproch? de ses opinions par l'interm?diaire de Mme de Kriidener . .. mais pour la seconde fois, elles m'ont laiss? ?chapper, malgr? le d?sir que j'avais de leur rester fid?le. Quand on est parfaitement de bonne foi avec soi-m?me, la conviction compl?te est un mot vide de sens." 30) Constant always remained a rationalist, but his ratio nalism was tempered by his conviction that his will was in sufficient, that the religious sentiment was necessary for moral action. Thus, in De la religion, if he always speaks of F?nelon with admiration, he shows much less sympathy for Mme Guyon and attacks Antoinette Bourignon, seeing in her as he had in Werner a link between mysticism and voluptuousness. After his struggle with Mme R?camier, one is tempted to evoke the pot and the kettle. . . There is a more basic problem; De la religion is finally an apology for progress, which is inevitable if man is left in a free state. In his discussion De la perfectibilit?, Constant asserts that ?si l'homme se gouverne par les id?es, le perfectionnement est assur?"31). These liberal notions of progress seem in contra 30) Correspondance de Benjamin et Rosalie de Constant, p. 215. 31) M?langes de litt?rature et de politique (Par?s, 1829), p. 395.</page><page sequence="27">Benjamin Constant, Germany, and De la religion 103 diction with the Quietist notions of abandonment to providence. Yet, if one examines his comments on the Stoics, one finds him admiring them for demanding of the gods only what the gods wish to give us, just as he admires the various pietist manifesta tions of religious enthusiasm in his own age ? their cult of vague meditation and of revery is a relief after Voltairean irony; they may be lost in the clouds, but the clouds are in the heavens. Constant has more sympathy for these pietists and mystics than he has for orthodox Calvinism, or certainly for the Catholic revival (De la religion, vol. V. ch. i). Indeed, his very definition of the religious sentiment owes much to his Quietist experience. The notion that the true morality is that imposed by religion in the heart of man, that some interior conversion is necessary if man is to be changed, that he must obey the sentiment found in the heart, and not simply comply with a moral code imposed on him from the outside, nor with one intellectually derived from the ?int?r?t bien entendu", that the ?disposition de l'?me" matters more than the determinations of the will, all these convictions stem organically from those moments when Constant's own will and reason failed and he found peace only in prayer, in seeking the divine within his heart. The heroism of resignation, which he believed central to Christianity (Du polyth?isme, ch. ) was known in his life, and this personal experience was basic to his appreciation of the necessity of the religious sentiment and thus to the whole scholarly study. De la religion was again the object of considerable revision in the years 1811?1812, as revealed in Constant's letters to Hochet and to Barante: ?Je me suis remis avec une ardeur inex primable ? mon Polyth?isme. Je l'ai refait tout entier sur un nouveau plan, et ? bien des ?gards, dans des id?es nouvelles, car j'ai continu?, de la meilleure foi du monde, ? me rapprocher, sans le vouloir et parce que les faits et le raisonnement m'y poussaient, des id?es religieuses, pour lesquelles vous m'avez d?j? vu assez de disposition.

It is of note that here Constant claims it was his scholarly research, ,,les faits", rather than his own religious experience, which had provoked the change. But the change has led him quite far, to where he would prefer superstition to atheism. Further still, for his letter of Dec. 2 asserts that ?le sentiment religieux n'a pu longtemps me satisfaire, impuissant et vague qu'il est, lorsqu'il est abandonn? ? ses propres forces"; finally he has perceived ?Dieu rendant ? l'homme non seulement la religion, mais la raison m?me" (Barante, 548?550). The same letter contains a new judgment on German philosophy, far different from that made in the earlier text, and now attacking the French philo sophes even more ferociously than he does in the final version of De la religion. ?La philosophie allemande me sert beaucoup, quoiqu'elle ne marche pas dans une direction parfaitement ana logue ? la mienne ... Ce n'est pas cette ?troite et cynique philo sophie qui, dans Voltaire, nous faisait na?tre entre l'urine et la mati?re f?cale, dans Helv?tius ne nous distinguait des chevaux que par les mains, dans Diderot voulait ?trangler le dernier pr?tre avec les boyaux du dernier roi, et dans Cabanis d?finissait la pens?e une s?cr?tion du cerveau. C'est une philosophie un peu vague, mais respectant tout ce qui est religieux, retrouvant la religion dans tout ce qui est bon, et s'agitant seulement dans ses tentatives pour g?n?raliser ses id?es, et placer la divinit? dans tout, afin de parvenir ? un r?sultat plus s?duisant par son universalit? apparente" (Barante, p. 550). Finally, in an impor tant letter to Hochet, also of Oct. 11, 1811, he reasserts that he is changing the whole tone of the work, again claiming it is his research which has provoked these changes. ?Comme vous savez, je ne suis plus ce philosophe intr?pide, s?r qu'il n'y a rien apr?s ce monde, et tellement content de ce monde qu'il se r?jouit de ce qu'il n'y en a pas d'autre. Mon ouvrage est une</page><page sequence="29">Benjamin Constant, Germany, and De la religion 105 singuli?re preuve de ce que dit Bacon, qu'un peu de science m?ne ? l'ath?isme, et plus de science ? la religion. C'est positivement en approfondissant les faits, en en recueillant de toutes parts, et en me heurtant contre les difficult?s sans nombre qu'ils opposent ? l'incr?dulit?, que je me suis vu forc? de reculer dans les id?es religieuses" 31). The Journal does not tell us what new ?faits" Constant acquired during these years; they probably included his knowledge of the Orient and India, which finally does not play too important a role in De la religion 32). Another letter to Hochet, of August, 1812 (p. 217) indeed contains a description of the theses of his study which pretty well accords with the published text. The conclusion that, as far as content went, the book changed little after this date is confirmed by evidence from other quarters. In a letter to Charles de Villers of Sept. or Oct. 1812, Constant complained that he had shown the plan and several parts of his book to a professor at G?ttingen, T?lken, who ?s'est empar? non seulement de l'id?e en g?n?ral, mais de la forme avec une telle exactitude que l'annonce du cours qu'il veut donner cet hiver contient mot pour mot les titres de mes livres et de mes chapitres" 33). Worried that he might be accused of having stolen his organization from T?lken, Constant asks that a note be added to the brochure acknowledging the debt to Constant. This bro chure exists; it is the Ank?ndigung und Plan wissenschaftlicher Vortr?ge ?ber die Mythologie, besonders der Griechen, 16 pp. published at G?ttingen in 1812. The planned lectures follow closely the ideas of De la religion about the progress of religion in Rome, the role of foreign influence in Greece, the late deve lopment of the mysteries, the absence of a powerful sacerdoce in Greece, the notion that fetichism precedes polytheism, which later tends to be anthropomorphized or idealized. However, the essential thesis of Constant, that the religious sentiment demands 32) Lettres ? un ami par Benjamin Constant et Mme de Sta?l, ed. Jean Mistier (Neuch?tel, 1949), p. 194. 33) M.

And, if many of Constant's essential ideas are here, the plan does not correspond to either De la religion or Du polyth?isme, or to any of the numerous plans for the books I have seen in the fonds Estournelles. The form of the book changed, but not its content 34). The nature of these later revisions can be grasped by a com parison of the various publications of parts of the book. For instance, a text on the ,,Aper?us sur la marche et les r?volutions de la philosophie ? Rome" was printed three times, first in the Minerve fran?aise in 1818 (vol. I, p. 602?611; II, 71?77); second in the M?langes de litt?rature et de politique (1829), p. 1?27, and finally, posthumously in Du polyth?isme as Chap ters i through vi of Book X. There are in addition several versions of this material at Lausanne, of which the best seems that in box 2 of the new fonds Estournelles, Livre XXXVI, ?De la philosophie ? Rome". A collation of these texts reveals the follow ing: 1. A number of stylistic changes, usually not of great importance. 2. Differences in punctuation; there it is noteworthy that the Du polyth?isme text, thanks either to its editor or to the printers, is erratically punctuated, and its occasional incohe rence should not be blamed on Constant whose comma has been replaced by a period, etc. 3. The Minerve text has a different introduction and conclusion, and the material on Horace is 34) Constant's wish was granted, for at the end of the brochure was added: ?Mit vielem Dank f?r die G?te meines verehrten Freundes, f?ge ich hier die Bemerkung bei, da? ich zu diesem letzten Abschnitt mich mancher, zwar nur fragmentarischen, aber h?chst sch?tzbaren Mittheilungen des Herrn B. v. Constant zu erfreuen habe, der seit Jahren an einem gro?en Werke ?ber diesen Theil der Religionsgeschichte arbeitet." Which was right? Cer tainly . C.

There are a number of political allusions in the Minerve, suppressed in the M?langes; on the other hand, moral generalizations are added in the M?langes and the Polyth?isme texts, . A certain amount of material is suppressed, evidently because Constant decided it was irrelevant or because he used it elsewhere. 6. The documentation and references become increasingly more complete. At times the changes are quite abrupt; the same introduction of a sentence will serve for two different conclusions, for Constant worked with small sheets of paper whose order he would then change at will. This procedure makes collating the various versions quite difficult, for a sentence which seems suppressed is apt to reappear two or three pages later. However, in all these four versions, one cannot speak of any thorough, complete recasting. Constant's ideas on the evolution of Roman philosophy remain unchanged. A cursory examination of the innumerable partial drafts of De la religion at Lausanne indicates that this was most often the case 35). ,,Un professeur d'ici, homme d'esprit, avec lequel j'en ai souvent caus?, me disait que ce n'?tait pas moi qui faisais mon livre, mais que mon livre me faisait. C'est parfaitement vrai. J'ai par dessus bien d'autres ?crivains un seul m?rite, c'est une enti?re bonne foi, de sorte que toutes les id?es, tous les faits, je les accueille, et leur laisse ? produire la modification qu'il est dans leur nature de produire en moi 36." As often, the ?chame 35) The thorough study of them Mr. Deguise is making should establish certain steps in the evolution of the work. These manuscripts, however numerous they may be, are in any case far from complete. 36) Many of these later revisions take the form of answering certain opponents and critics, notably Lamennais (of the Essai sur l'indiff?rence) and the Baron d'Eckstein; these opponents, together with the religious policy of the Bourbon restoration, tend to make B. C. take an ever more liberal position. One of his critics was Stendhal (Courrier anglais, IV, 10 and V, 258) who found the book boring and obscure, the ??vangile de la religion nouvelle" which various grandes dames ?tentent de lancer ?

From the evidence I have presented, it would seem that Constant's work on religion evolved through a twice-repeated process; on two occasions his previous convictions were shaken, and then his new ideas led to a change in the content of the work, which change was dependent on his research. Between 1794 and 1803, thanks to Mme de Sta?l (who only figures a widespread reaction against the Revolution and, beyond it, the Enlightenment), Constant comes out of his crisis of cynical despair and replaces his materialist sensationalism by an innate, transcendant notion of moral duty; he begins to appreciate the value of enthusiasm and of the passions. This influence was followed by a period of intensive work on the book, during which, through his reading, he develops many of its central concepts. Even there he often says he discovers in various authors ideas he already has. But the text I have here presented demonstrates how far his ideas still were, then, from those of the finally published version. The next great change took place in 1807 and 1808; through his own religious crisis, Constant came to appreciate fully for himself the value of religious experience. The work was then rewritten, in the light of his new convictions and of his increased knowledge. Then the book was rather put aside during those years in which he devoted himself to his political career, to be revised again, but largely in terms of form and argumentation, immediately prior to and during publication 37). In the evolution of the book, the general intellectual and religious currents of the time and the personal religious experience of Constant seem more fundamental and important factors than the extensive research and scholarship of its author.</page></plain_text>
