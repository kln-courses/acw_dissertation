      <p>Our images of Upper Paleolithic Europe
are a curious lot, abounding with depictions of brave Ice‐Age
hunters preparing for the hunt, stalking and killing megafauna, or
celebrating the kill. This is true for written and visual representations
alike, which, by omitting from consideration the activities of not only
older individuals but also women and children, present extremely limited
and biased reconstructions of the past. These reconstructions of the
imagined stereotypical activities of prime‐age males leave us in the
proverbial outer darkness as to what the Paleolithic
“silent majority”—the mates, children, and parents of
such brave prehistoric men—may have been doing with their lives in
addition to admiring and assisting them.</p>
      <p>We have elsewhere discussed some of the reasons for these biased
reconstructions and pointed to the privileging of durable
media—stone, ivory, antler, and bone—as sources of our
information about the past (Adovasio et al.
1999, n.d.). Both
ethnographic evidence and data recovered from the excavations of sites with
equitable preservation tell us that the materials that survive, most
notably stone, form a minuscule percentage of the inventories used by
hunter‐gatherers both in the recent and in the remote past. In early
Holocene contexts where preservation is complete, there are 20 times as
many fiber artifacts and, where present, even 4 times as many wood tools as
lithic items (Soffer et al. 1998, with
references). Other scholars have pointed to the effect of bias in the
research interests of many of the male scholars who have
dominated Pleistocene research from its inception (e.g., Gero
1995; Conkey
1991,
1997).</p>
      <p>This paper begins to correct these slanted renderings of Upper
Paleolithic lifeways by discussing the evidence for perishable
technologies, specifically for the weaving of textiles and the plaiting and
coiling of baskets. We use the iconographic evidence for woven clothing
often found on European “Venus” figurines to argue that these
technologies were employed by Upper Paleolithic women, that they varied
across Europe, and that they were sufficiently valued to be immortalized in
fired clay, ivory, and stone.</p>

         <p>Ongoing collaborative research with Czech scholars on Gravettian
inventories from such sites as Dolní Věstonice I and III and
Pavlov I in Moravia (fig. 1) has
documented the existence of highly diverse and sophisticated textile
technologies that included the production of cordage and nets, the plaiting
of baskets, and the twining and loom weaving of cloth (Adovasio, Soffer,
and Klíma 1996; Adovasio, Hyland, and
Soffer 1997; Adovasio et al.
1999, n.d.;
Soffer et al. 1998). The evidence for these
perishable inventories comes from 36 textile impressions found on small
fragments of fired and unfired clay recovered from Dolní
Věstonice I (Adovasio et al. n.d.), 1
from Dolní Věstonice II (Adovasio, Hyland, and Soffer
1997), and 42 from Pavlov I (Adovasio et al.
1999).<fig-group content-type="figgrp" id="fg1" position="float" seq="1">

         <p>The textiles and cordage specimens in question were clearly made of
plant rather than animal fiber (Adovasio et al.
1999, n.d.;
Soffer et al. 1998, with references). As
table 1 indicates, the inventory
includes single‐ply, multiple‐ply, and braided cordage,
knotted netting, plaited wicker‐style basketry, and a wide variety
of non‐heddle‐loom‐woven textiles, including simple
and diagonal twined pieces and plain woven and twilled objects. Some of
these pieces even exhibit intentional structural decoration (Soffer et al.
1998).<table-wrap id="tb1" position="float" seq="1">

         <p>Because the Moravian ceramic assemblage is highly fragmentary and the
impressions especially small, we cannot specify with confidence the
configuration or dimensions of items that were produced. We do know that
both woven textiles and baskets are represented. As we have argued
elsewhere (Adovasio, Soffer, and Klíma
1996; Adovasio, Hyland, and Soffer
1997; Adovasio et al.
1999; Soffer et al.
1998), it is highly likely that the
plaited items represent baskets or mats, and the relatively wide range of
textile gauges and weaves suggests mats, perhaps wall hangings, blankets,
and bags, as well as a wide array of apparel forms including shawls,
shirts, skirts, and sashes. The presence of sequentially spaced knots on
some of the impressions suggests the production of netting, while our
identification of seams conjoined by whipping stitches points to the sewing
of textiles to produce more complex structures such as clothing and
bags.</p>
         <p>The variety of these inventories and the fineness of many of the
final products clearly indicate that these are in no sense “primary
essays in the craft.” Rather, when coupled with the observed high
level of standardized warp and weft processing, they suggest considerable
antecedent development both for these items and for the fiber industry in
general.</p>
         <p>The materials discussed all come from Upper Paleolithic sites
assigned to the Pavlov culture and date to between ca. 29,000 and 24,000
<sc>b.p.</sc> (uncalibrated). They represent the earliest evidence for
cordage and textile production in the world and reflect technologies
heretofore associated with the much later Mesolithic and Neolithic periods
(Childe 1936). Although impressive in their
number and sophistication, they are not the only cordage and cordage
by‐products reported from the Paleolithic. Cheynier
(1967), for example, published, albeit in an
anecdotal fashion, a textile impression from the Solutrean level at
Badegoule in France. Our recent reexamination of the collections not
only confirms his observation but indicates the presence of other
plant‐fiber‐based impressions. Actual cordage has been
reported from the somewhat younger sites of Lascaux, France
(Leroi‐Gourhan and Allain 1979), Ohalo
II, Israel (Nadel et al. 1994), Kosoutsy,
Moldova (Adovasio, Hyland, and Soffer
1997, Adovasio et al.
1999, with references), and Mezhirich, Ukraine
(Adovasio, Hyland, and Soffer 1997;
Adovasio et al. 1999, with references). These
data strongly suggest that plant fiber‐based textiles and basketry
likely existed in a number of regions outside of Moravia, and our current
studies of textile impressions in a variety of media from Upper Paleolithic
sites in France, Germany, and Russia indicate this to be the case. The
paucity of evidence for these perishable technologies in the Late
Pleistocene compared with the abundance of evidence for technologies made
of stone, ivory, antler, and bone is not surprising but rather to be
expected because of preservational biases and deficient recovery techniques
(Adovasio et al. 1999,
n.d.).</p>
         <p>Our evidence that people wove and/or plaited
plant‐fiber‐based products by at least Gravettian times and
the implication that these items were combined by sewing to produce more
complex products raises a number of issues that can be subsumed under two
broad research questions: (1) How were they produced and what were their
functions? and (2) Who made and used them?</p>
         <p>Although our research on the tools and implements which may have been
used to produce textiles and fashion them into more complex structures is
in its initial stages, we note that the appearance of Paleolithic textiles
is penecontemporaneous with the appearance of implements associated with
sewing, weaving, and net making. Specifically, eyed needles make their
first appearance during the Gravettian period <italic>sensu lato</italic>,
being reported in all parts of Europe from France (de Beaune
1993) to Sungir’ in Russia (Bader
1998). Although some of these, such as the
large needle from Předmostí, Czech Republic (Klíma
1990: fig. 28; Valoch
1982: fig. 4), may have been used in net
making, its subsequent ivory equivalents, ubiquitous in later Upper
Paleolithic sites, attest to extensive sewing and possibly embroidery.
While these needles have been traditionally associated with the sewing of
garments of leather and hide for the production of tailored clothing (Bader
1998, with references; Sterdeur‐Yedid
1979), many of them are too small for this
and likely reflect working with woven textiles and/or accessory stitching
or embroidering rather than conjoining of animal hides. Similarly, many
Gravettian‐age and later inventories contain implements previously
identified as hunting weaponry or decorative or “art” objects
which may have been associated with textile production—for example,
the bone “spear head” from Předmostí
(Klíma 1990; fig. 33; Valoch
1982; fig. 1), which may be a net spacer, the
sitting anthropomorphs made of mammoth phalanges from
Předmostí (Klíma 1990:
figs. 23–24), and their equivalents from Avdeevo in Russia (Gvozdover
1995: fig. 154), which perhaps served as loom
weights. They also include the enigmatic “rondelles,” including
the cutout circular ivory objects from Sungir’ (Bader
1978: fig. 114), the perforated
mammoth‐bone disks from Mezhirich (Pidoplichko
1976: fig. 74), which may have served as
spindle whorls, and the engraved foot‐shaped “pendant”
made of fossil ivory found at Kniegrotte in Germany, which likely
functioned as a grass comb (Feustel 1974:
fig. 27).</p>
         <p>We report here the results of our research on who made and used at
least some of these products, using iconographic evidence as well as the
more conjectural evidence from ethnohistory, modern ethnographies, and
Upper Paleolithic funerary wear to do so.</p>

            <title>The Human Body</title>
            <p>No item of Upper
Paleolithic material culture has received as much attention, from amateurs
and professionals alike, as depictions of humans (Soffer
1987, Soffer and Conkey
1997). Particular attention has been paid to
Paleolithic depictions of women, commonly termed “Venuses” in
the literature. This attention has, by and large, been directed to certain
features common to many of them, namely, the emotionally charged primary
and secondary sexual characteristics—vulvae, breasts, stomachs, and
buttocks (Soffer 1987,
1989; Soffer and Conkey
1997). This selective focus on just a few
features, presumed but never demonstrated to be the critical ones, has led
to the well‐known myriad of conflicting unitary explanations for the
Venus figurines. These explanations are as numerous as commentators
venturing an opinion and range from seeing the depictions as
“fertility” symbols or “mother goddesses,”
paleoerotica, gynecological primers, and self‐portraiture to
suggestions that they were signifiers of widespread social ties (for
discussion see, e.g., Delporte 1993, Dobres
1992, Duhard
1994, Marshack
1991, McDermott
1996). Other scholars have raised serious
objections to such explanations, pointing to their selectivity, lack of
attention to context, uncontrolled chronologies, and unjustified
assumptions (e.g., Dobres 1992; Soffer
1987, 1989;
Soffer and Conkey 1997).</p>

            <title>Gravettian Diversity</title>
            <p>While
Paleolithic depictions of females—which by now number well over 200
examples for the Gravettian period alone—are often unclad, there is a
great deal of variability in the way in which the bodies are
modeled. First, as Dobres (1992) points out,
there is variability in the media used as well as in context. More
important, the variability in the depiction of the female body is not
random but fairly rigidly patterned regardless of media or
context.</p>
            <p>Focusing on over 100 figurines and figurine fragments from
Gravettian‐age sites in European Russia, Gvozdover
(1989<italic>b</italic>) rigorously analyzed such
features as body posture, anatomical emphasis, and surface decoration to
identify at least four types of figurines in the assemblages recovered from
the related and coeval Kostenki and Avdeevo sites alone. This first truly
archaeological study of this category of material culture concluded that
(p. 89)<disp-quote>
                  <p>The massive numbers of figures at the site and their
diversity of types gives reason to suppose that they embodied a
multiplicity of roles of the female image and that the different types of
figurines had different functions in the Paleolithic pantheon. We believe
that each type of figurine had its own symbolic meaning, conveyed by the
pose and accentuation of the female body parts.</p>
               </disp-quote>Focusing on the
emphasis and spatial orientation of the anatomical features and extending
her comparisons to female figurines found in Central and Western Europe
during the broadly similar time slice some 27,000–20,000 years ago,
Gvozdover noted accenting of thighs and hips in Western Europe, of
breasts and bellies in Eastern Europe, and pointed out the intermediate
position of the pieces recovered from Central Europe. Figure
2 shows that even these depictions
are internally varied as well.<fig-group content-type="figgrp" id="fg2" position="float" seq="2">

            <title>The Elaborated Body</title>
            <p>Upper Paleolithic
female figurines, naked as well as partially clad, occur across Eurasia
from the Atlantic Ocean to Lake Baikal (e.g., Abramova
1962, 1995;
Delporte 1993; Gvozdover
1989<italic>b</italic>). Their distribution
contrasts sharply with the scarcity of unambiguous depictions of
Paleolithic males (e.g., Brno II, possibly Stadel, possibly the
Avdeevo male, fragments from Dolní Věstonice and Pavlov I,
and the more ambiguous male from Brassempouy) and humans of unknown sex who
are depicted either naked (in the case of unambiguous males) or lacking any
marking.</p>
            <p>Abramova (1960) and Gvozdover
(1989<italic>b</italic>) were the first scholars
to study the patterning of the decorations on the Venus bodies and to
suggest that some of them might represent clothing. Our study continues
this research, focusing on the close reading of these decorations and
demonstrating that they do indeed depict clothing. We do so because we
agree with the observations made by Joyce
(1993:256) in her study of figurines from
ancient Mesoamerica:</p>
            <p>
               <disp-quote>
                  <p>The selection of features to be incorporated
in human images is a means by which stereotypes of natural or essential
human behavior may be promulgated. In order to approach the relationships
between the inaccessible mental constructs of makers and users of these
human images and the public representations to which we do have access, I
assume that no detail is simply natural or accidental, the selection of
attributes being part of a diaologic process of construction of human
identities.</p>
               </disp-quote>
            </p>
            <p>We focus on these features also because when the
female images are depicted as decorated or clad, as much attention is paid
to the detailing of the items of clothing as to the depiction of their
primary and secondary sexual characteristics, something clearly in evidence
on the well‐known Venus of Willendorf and a myriad of other
figurines and figurine fragments (see fig.
2). We argue that such attention and
detailing offers us a rare, unambiguous entry into Upper Paleolithic
ideologies and helps us to identify the roles that some females played in
Late Pleistocene societies. This is so because, as Lesure
(1997:229) notes in his study of figurines
from Chiapas, Mexico,<disp-quote>
                  <p>If figurines really were a medium for active
construction of social identity, then the stereotypes represented in
figurine assemblages can provide important clues about what was talked
about and what was not, in conversations about social identity. … By
looking at what was and was not represented, and how social categories were
distinguished within figurine assemblages, it is possible to develop
hypotheses about the subject matter of conversations about social
differences.</p>
               </disp-quote>Furthermore, we note that such detailing of clothing
on the figurines reflects social differentiation in a medium both ideally
suited for this purpose and universally used to this end—the human
body. As Turner (1980:112) pointed out,
“The surface of the body, as the common frontier of society, the
social self, and the psycho‐biological individual, becomes the
symbolic stage upon which the drama of socialization is enacted, and bodily
adornment … becomes the language through which it is
expressed.” Thus, the presence of such detailing on the Venuses is
not only not surprising but to have been expected.</p>
            <p>While the few
scholars, among them Okladnikov (1941),
Abramova (1960), de Beaune
(1998), and Scheer
(1995), who have commented on likely
Paleolithic clothing have argued that it was surely made of such animal
by‐products as furs and hides, we argue here that the garments
depicted on the European Venus figurines clearly and unambiguously reflect
plant‐based textiles and basketry and in so doing confirm the
suggestions of this made by some of our predecessors on
purely logico‐deductive grounds (Barber
1991, 1994;
Gvozdover 1989<italic>b</italic>; Marshack

         <title>The Dressed Venus</title>
         <p>We next turn to a closer look at the garments found on the figurines
dating to the Gravettian period, roughly between 27,000 and 20,000 years
ago. We do so because female images produced during this period all across
Europe are the most “realistic” or detailed Upper Paleolithic
depictions we have. More recent images show a degree of stylization that
renders identification difficult (Soffer
1997). Since the figurines from Central and
Eastern Europe come from sites assigned by most scholars to a single
Pavlov‐Willendorf‐Kostenki‐Avdeevo (PWKA) cultural
entity (Soffer 1997, with references) and
since, as Gvozdover (1989<italic>b</italic>) has
noted, these images exhibit greater similarity to each other than to
their equivalents from Western Europe, we compare the two groups.</p>
         <sec id="sc3.1">
            <title>Caps and Snoods</title>
            <p>Gvozdover
(1989<italic>b</italic>) has noted that the
presence or absence of detailing and decoration on the heads of the Eastern
European figurines is highly variable, and this variability extends to
Central Europe as well. Figure
3 illustrates just some of this
variability, which, because of numerous examples found of each type, we
argue is not random but patterned. Some of the heads from both regions,
such as the Dolní Věstonice I example, lack any realistic
detailing at all. The second category consists of heads with variable
realistic detailing of faces and hairdos (e.g., the ivory head
from Dolní Věstonice I or the head of Kostenki I
83‐1). Of more interest to this discussion are heads with clear
depictions of headgear, which come from Dolní Věstonice I,
Pavlov I, Kostenki I, Avdeevo, and Gagarino and are made in a variety of
media from marl to sandstone, fired clay, and ivory (fig.
4). Although some of these
representations have been interpreted as stylized penis
depictions (Klíma, personal communication, 1999), the presence of
necklaces on them strongly suggests that they are images of the heads and
necks of females.<fig-group content-type="figgrp" id="fg3" position="float" seq="3">

            <p>The head of the Willendorf figurine offers the
clearest evidence that what we see here is a depiction of headgear—a
fiber‐based woven cap or hat—rather than a hairdo, as posited
by scholars from Sollas (1924 [1911]) onward,
or a cap made of shells, as suggested by Abramova
(1960). Our close examination of this specimen
shows a spirally or radially hand‐woven item which may be initiated
by a knotted center in the manner of some kinds of coiled baskets (see
Adovasio 1977: figs.
99<italic>a</italic>–<italic>b</italic>). The technique represented is a
two‐element structure in which an apparently flexible, horizontal
foundation element or warp is vertically wrapped with stem stitches. The
foundation element is clearly visible between the stitches, some of which
are plain while others are countered (see Emery
1966: fig. 65). Work direction is right to
left, and at least seven circuits encircle the head, with two extra
half‐circuits over the nape of the neck. The selvage, as depicted
over the forehead, simply has the wrapping element encircling the final
horizontal warp circuit. Several areas on the body of the cap appear to
illustrate splices, where new material has been added. Suffice it to say
that this complex construction cannot be produced with growing (that is,
attached) human hair. A similar cap is depicted on the fragment of the head
made of marl recovered from Avdeevo (Gvozdover
1995: fig. 110). This fragment also appears
to have been spirally or radially produced.</p>
            <p>The headgear represented
on the Kostenki I marl figurine recovered in 1983 (fig.
5) belongs in this category as well.
Although this cap is somewhat stylized, it is clear that the basic
construction technique is similar to that on the Venus of Willendorf. The
principal difference appears to be the greater number of circuits
encompassing the Kostenki head. The cap depicted on the large head fragment
from Kostenki I is also broadly similar, although the method of initiating
the radial weaving appears to be different (fig.
6). The top of this head made of
marl depicts a method of starting which may involve
systematically superimposed weaving elements such as those which
characterize certain types of twining centers and so‐called plaited
starts in coiled basketry (see Adovasio
1977:figs. 27, 31, 98). As in the Willendorf
piece, this cap also shows extra half‐circuits over the nape of the
neck. Whatever the method of starting or finishing, considerable effort is
expended on the caps themselves. Extreme detailing is typical across the
broad area occupied by groups assigned to the PWKA cultural entity
and exhibits various degrees of realism and stylization.<fig-group content-type="figgrp" id="fg5" position="float" seq="5">

            </p>
            <p>The Western
European specimens show different patterning. As in Central and Eastern
Europe, some of the female heads are devoid of any detailing, for example,
the “Venus with the Horn” from Laussel and numerous Grimaldi
pieces (Delporte 1993, White
1986). Others, however, do depict head
coverings, such as the Venus of Brassempouy (fig.
7), the “Negroid” head
from Grimaldi (Delporte 1993:fig. 95), and
the “Venus with the Grid‐like Head” from Laussel
(Delporte 1993:fig. 44). Unfortunately, the
head from Brassempouy is not sufficiently detailed to reveal any
attributes of the hypothesized head covering. Minimally, if the image is
taken at face value, it would appear that some form of flexible, open,
perhaps twined construction was fitted over the hair. Less likely but
possible is the depiction of stylized knotted netting. A similar head
covering may be represented on “La
tête négroïde” from Grimaldi. As in the Brassempouy
case, the rendering of the head covering is stylized and indistinct in
details. The Laussel engraving is even more schematic, depicting a head in
profile overlain with rectangular gridding. Rather than hats, we suggest
that these depictions represent hairnets or netted snoods, a hypothesis
also advanced by Moser (1997) for the
Brassempouy figurine. Although far removed in time and context, similar
netted headgear has been identified on a number of female bodies recovered
from prehistoric interments in Danish bogs (Hald
1980).<fig-group content-type="figgrp" id="fg7" position="float" seq="7">

            </p>
            <p>Finally, when hats or caps are
depicted on Upper Paleolithic figurines, facial details are absent. This,
we suggest, points to the social (as opposed to individual) importance of
the headgear in Paleolithic ideology.</p>

            <title>Bandeaux</title>
            <p>Gvozdover
(1989<italic>b</italic>) has noted the presence
of upper body decorations on a large number of the Kostenki and Avdeevo
figurines in the form of linear wedge‐shaped notching with staggered
spacing or checkwork and suggested that they might be elements of clothing.
The discovery of a number of new figurines and figurine fragments since her
writing, especially at Kostenki I, permits us to expand on this hypothesis.
The fine detailing on the Kostenki figurine reveals patterns on the straps
and bandeau reminiscent of open twining with running‐loop continuous
weft selvages (fig.
8). Additionally, the artisan
expended considerable energy on depicting the points at which the straps
join the body of the bandeau, presumably via sewing. Whatever the weave of
the straps, these engravings clearly depict woven fabrics.<fig-group content-type="figgrp" id="fg8" position="float" seq="8">

            <p>Bandeaux,
sometimes shown with straps and at other times abstracted into strapless
banding on top of the figurines’ breasts, are present on almost all
Eastern European figurines wearing woven headgear (e.g., on figurine
#6 from Avdeevo [Gvozdover 1995:fig. 98] and
on the Kostenki figurines [Abramova 1995:figs.
59, 60, 73, 74]). In the few cases where they are absent, as in the
Willendorf case, they are replaced by hands folded on top of the breasts.
These items of clothing are absent from the Western European figurines, and
their absence confirms Gvozdover’s
(1989<italic>b</italic>) observation that while
the semantic emphasis in Eastern European figurines was on stomachs and
breasts, in Western Europe it was on hips and thighs.</p>

these constructions are always shown worn on the waist, sometimes just on
the back of the figurines and at other times on the front as well (e.g.,
the large marl fragment from Kostenki [fig.
9]). In Central and Western Europe,
in contrast, belts are found low on the hip (e.g., the clay figurine
fragments from Dolní Věstonice I and Pavlov I [Klíma
1991:fig. 15]). Some of them are quite
realistic depictions of fiber‐based constructions; others, as on the
Venus from Dolní Věstonice I (see fig.
1), consist of highly abstracted
horizontal lines girdling the body. The same low position of the belt can
be observed on the Venus of Lespugue (fig.
10); here the belt is attached to a

            <p>Our examination of the original Lespugue piece via
unaided eye and low‐power magnification reveals remarkable attention
to detail. The Lespugue skirt is composed of 11 cords plied around a base
cord which serves as the belt. The cords are secured to the belt by looping
both ends of a single‐ply construction over the belt and then
twisting the ends together (i.e., replying) with a final Z twist. Several
of the cords show as many as 30 and 40 separate incisions illustrating
individual twists, and great care has been taken to depict progressive
changes in angle of twist. Near the top or waist end of the skirt, the
angle of twist is tight, circa 40° or more. On the opposite end, the
angle is much looser, circa 20°, clearly showing the cords
unraveling or fraying at the hem. The overall configuration of the skirt is
tapered not unlike a tail by employing a long central cord and immediately
contiguous segments with progressively shorter cords toward the lateral
margins of the skirt. Although no details of cord splicing are evident, our
examination confirms Barber’s (1991,
1994) observation that the garment depicted
was clearly made of plant fiber.</p>

Western, Central, and Eastern Europe concerning what the
well‐dressed Venus wore (fig.

paucity of female images from Gravettian‐ or Perigordian‐age
Western Europe makes our reconstruction of Western Venus attire
<italic>very</italic> tentative but suggest that the available data indicate
that it minimally consisted of a netted snood and sometimes a belted string
skirt worn low on the hip. String skirts are seen only on Western European
figurines; the one purported example from Gagarino (Barber
1994:56) reflects the structure of the ivory
(e.g., dentine) from which the figurine was made and not applied
decoration. In Central and Eastern Europe, in contrast, there is always a
basket hat, often accompanied by a woven bandeau and belt and by necklaces
and bracelets. In congruence with the differences in the area of emphasis
between west and east noted before and the intermediate position of the
Central European figurines between the two, in Central Europe, as
in Western Europe, the belts are low on the hip while in the east they are
at the waist.<fig-group content-type="figgrp" id="fg11" position="float" seq="11">

            <p>We have noted that garments are found only on Upper
Paleolithic female figurines; with the exception of the ambiguous belted
figurine fragment from Brassempouy (Challot
1964:423), the rare male depictions and the
undifferentiated anthropomorphs lack any such detailing. This patterning
clearly associates garments with females but only with some of them.
Gvozdover (1989<italic>a</italic>) has shown that
the decorations on female bodies occur in more abstracted form on a wide
variety of implements recovered from Kostenki and Avdeevo (fig.
12). This led her to identify these
implements as synechdoches of the dressed female figurines. The same
observations can be extended to inventories recovered from Dolní
Věstonice I and Pavlov I (Klíma
1991). These two sets of data permit us to
argue unambiguously, using terminology borrowed from Lesure
(1997), that what was important and
“talked about” some 29,000 to 20,000 years ago across
Europe was woven and plaited clothing and headgear made of plant materials
which were associated with one category of Upper Paleolithic
women.<fig-group content-type="figgrp" id="fg12" position="float" seq="12">

            <title>The Living, the Dead, and
Iconography</title>
            <p>Having documented Gravettian‐age
“Venus‐wear,” we next briefly turn to the issue of
whether these garments were a part of regular day wear, ritual wear, or
some combination of the two. Although limitations of space prevent us from
engaging in a full discussion of this issue, we can point to some
regularities in the archaeological record that permit us to begin
addressing it. While we will never be able to document Upper
Paleolithic costumes in full detail, two sources exist for first
approximations: (1) information from burials and (2) information from
iconography.</p>
            <p>We assume that the iconographic evidence, which depicts
males unclad and only some females very partially clad, is not
“photographic” evidence that little if any clothing was worn
during the Upper Paleolithic in Europe. This assumption is warranted by
ethnographic evidence that all hunter‐gatherers inhabiting northern
latitudes, if for no other reason than climate, are clothed. While it is
true that the amount and kind of clothing worn varies depending on the
season as well as the situation, the available data validate our
assumption that Upper Paleolithic iconography is not to be taken at face
value as a faithful reflection of clothing worn in daily
life.</p>
            <p>Evidence from Upper Paleolithic burials, although
extraordinarily sparse, does show that both males and females were at least
buried fully clad. For example, reconstructions of clothes worn by the
deceased in the three most complete burials from Sungir’, dated to
some 25,000 <sc>b.p.</sc>, use the placement of beads and deformations in
the bead strands to posit sewn hooded top garments, pants with attached
footwear, capes, and caps or hats (O. Bader
1978, N. Bader
1998, Scheer
1995). The three individuals buried here, one
an older male, the second an adolescent female, and the third a
7‐to‐9‐year‐old boy, also wore a plethora
of bracelets, armlets, necklaces, and rings. Reconstructions of clothing
worn by the deceased buried at the Gravettian sites in Italy also suggest
the wearing of hats or caps and other body coverings (Mussi
1990). As noted previously, scholars have
assumed that the clothing worn by the Upper Paleolithic deceased was made
of hides or furs (Abramova 1960, de Beaune
1998, Scheer
1995). Lack of evidence prevents us from
testing this assumption.</p>
            <p>Iconography tells us that at least some of
the clothing worn by some Upper Paleolithic individuals was made of
plant‐based textiles, that such clothing was associated, at least
iconographically, with one category of Upper Paleolithic women, and that
this association was important enough to be depicted in a variety of
objects, from figurines to pins, awls, and decorated
animal phalanges.</p>

         <sec id="sc4.2">
            <title>Constructing Female Identities</title>
            <p>This
association also affords us a clear glimpse of the gendering of society in
Gravettian times. Since, as Gero and Conkey
(1991), among others, have noted, gendering
is a social construct used to group individuals into socially distinct
categories, such evidence permits us to break down what has too often been
treated as a unified entity—be it “the Gravettians” or
“Upper Paleolithic groups” or, worse,
“Ice‐Age hunters”—and begin considering how
individuals were aggregated into socially constituted groups that far back
in time. It also permits us to address issues of agency, labor, and
especially the value of that labor. In this exercise we are informed by the
work of Costin (1996), who warns that gender
differences in the past need to be demonstrated rather than assumed. She
points out that the commonly used sources for doing so in archaeology are
data derived from ethnographic analogy, texts, mortuary evidence, and
figurative representations.</p>
            <p>Marcus’s
(1998) recent study of female figurines from
Formative Oaxaca and Brumfiel’s (1996)
analyses of Aztec figurines document that important information about
gendering can also be obtained from specific spatial contexts.
Upper Paleolithic female figurines and figurine fragments, however, as
Gvozdover (1989<italic>b</italic>; see also
Praslov 1993) has noted, do not appear to be
restricted to specific depositional contexts. Some came from inside
dwellings and others from cultural layers outside such features; some were
found in pits, others not. The pieces recovered from Dolní
Věstonice I and Pavlov I show no spatial patterning (Soffer
1997), and the contextual evidence from
Brassempouy, Grimaldi, and Willendorf is equally uninformative (Delporte
1993). Thus, the nature of the available data
seems to restrict us to just two sources of information, funerary
evidence and iconography about social categorization—and, indeed,
because the former is so sparse, to iconography alone.</p>
            <p>Little
attention has been paid to gender issues in the Paleolithic literature, and
the work at hand is mostly theoretical rather than empirical. One
exception is Conroy’s (1993) study of
anthropomorphic depictions, which argues for gendering during the Upper
Paleolithic, albeit in a different form from that of today. Pointing to the
patterning in female and not male depictions, she concludes that
women’s bodies had been transformed into cultural constructs while
those of males had not. Gvozdover’s work
(1989<italic>a</italic>,
<italic>b</italic>), in turn, demonstrates that
the gendered females were further subdivided on criteria which she argues
are related not to age but to other cultural structuring principles. Our
discussion adds to these observations by demonstrating the association of
textiles and basketry used as clothing with one category of social
females—their likely inventors and producers.</p>

         <sec id="sc4.3">
            <title>Women's Work in the Upper
Paleolithic</title>
            <p>As we have noted above, the unambiguous assignment of
particular technologies to any particular social grouping of individuals is
a difficult endeavor in archaeology. This is especially so as one moves
farther back in time and can no longer convincingly use arguments of
historical continuity. Separated as we are by some 27 millennia from the
first documentation about who wove and made baskets in prehistoric Europe,
the gendering of textile technologies must rely on parsimony, at best.
Nonetheless, iconography and analogy with the ethnographic record clearly
indicate that it was Paleolithic women who were most likely the weavers and
basket makers in Gravettian times.</p>
            <p>We have already presented
iconographic evidence for this. Here we briefly refer to the ethnographic
record, which documents the close association of women not only with plant
harvesting and processing (Kehoe 1990,
1991; Murdock
1937; Murdock and Provost
1973; Owen
1996, 1999;
Watson and Kennedy 1991) but also with the
transformation of plant products into more complex structures through
weaving and the processing of woody materials into basketry. This
association is valid for all simpler societies where textiles and basketry
are produced for domestic and communal needs and breaks down only when such
perishable products enter the sphere of market exchange (Barber
1990, 1994;
Hald 1980; King
1991; Schneider and Weiner
1989).</p>
            <p>This is not to suggest that
males play no role in perishable fiber‐based technologies. Indeed,
there is ample evidence that certain categories of items, such as woven
footwear and some kinds of nets and ritual cloth, are often made by males.
Rather, we suggest that these male‐based productions are the
exception; for textiles, in particular, male involvement is
usually minimal.</p>
            <p>We are well aware that, as Costin
(1996) and Wobst
(1978) before her have noted, reliance on
ethnographic analogy is fraught with dangers of replicating
contingent phenomena, especially the highly context‐dependent social
ones, as eternal. We suggest, however, that the evidence from the
ethnological and ethnohistoric records warrants such an
association.</p>

            <title>Valuable Work, Valued Lives</title>
            <p>Our
documentation of extensive textile production in prehistoric Europe and of
the gendering of these technologies sheds new light not only on the labor
of a heretofore unrecognized segment of Upper Paleolithic people,
women, but also on the high value of this labor. The exquisite and
labor‐intensive detailing employed in the depiction of the woven
garments worn by one group of Venuses clearly shows that weaving and
basket‐making skills and their products were valued enough to be
transformed into transcendent cultural facts carved into stone, ivory, and
bone. Simply put, we suggest that being depicted wearing such garments
associated the wearer and, by extension, the maker of them with a marked
position of prestige. While it is tempting to speculate about the criteria
used for such categorizations in Upper Paleolithic Europe—for
example, age‐grades, marriageability, reproductive status,
membership in sacred societies (for possible permutations see Marcus
1998)—the nature of the data at hand
permits us only to suggest that, however delimited, these status positions,
at least during Gravettian times, were restricted to a particular category
of social females.</p>
            <p>We have already commented, here and elsewhere, on
the narrow gauge of many of the weavings found imprinted on the Moravian
ceramic fragments—the finest of which are comparable not only to
Neolithic but even to Bronze and Iron Age products and, in fact, to thin
cotton and linenwear worn today (Adovasio, Hyland, and Soffer
1997; Adovasio et al.
1999, n.d.;
Soffer et al. 1998). Such fine weaving is a
very labor‐intensive activity, and its presence in the Upper
Paleolithic archaeological record therefore probably reflects the
intensification of female labor. The iconographic importance attributed to
this labor suggests to us that at least some textile products by this time
may have been what Clark (1986) has termed
“symbols of excellence.”</p>
            <p>Specifically, we raise the
possibility that these highly perishable products of female labor may have
served as “symbols of achievement” and been a part of prestige
economies. We advance this hypothesis in the light of Clark’s
(1986) discussion of prehistoric valuables,
which notes that in simpler societies materials of symbolic value are often
highly perishable—an observation amply confirmed by both
the ethnographic and the archaeological record (e.g., Chilikat blankets on
the Northwest Coast, atush among the Ainu, cloth in prehistoric Mesoamerica
and Peru). Here we add yet another category of products, textiles and
basketry, to the ivory and shell precious substances that Clark identified
as socially valuable materials during the Upper Paleolithic. In contrast to
his ivory and shell valuables, whose makers will likely remain forever
unknown, in the case of Upper Paleolithic textiles and basketry we are
dealing with gendered technologies that assign the production of valuables
to women’s labor.</p>

         <title>Conclusions</title>
         <p>A variety of textile, basketry, and netting items were produced in
Upper Paleolithic Europe by at least 27,000 <sc>b.p</sc>. They were
likely used to meet both household and hunting needs and also served as
clothing. The evidence for the making and wearing of varied and
sophisticated woven products by Gravettian times shows that the Upper
Paleolithic witnessed a quantum elaboration of “the string
revolution” (Barber 1990,
1994) and suggests that Paleolithic women
made and likely wore a great variety of cloth, including twined wear and
non‐heddle‐loom‐woven plain weaves.</p>
         <p>Paleolithic imagery associates the wearing of clothing with a
category of women whose attire included basket hats or caps, netted snoods,
bandeaux, string skirts, and belts. These garments were clearly not day
wear but more likely ritual wear, real or imagined, which served as a
signifier of distinct social categories. They varied in a patterned manner
from east to west.</p>
         <p>Hunter‐gatherer ethnography, ethnohistory, and Upper
Paleolithic iconography associate the production of textiles and baskets
with women and thus reveal not only female labor but one of the principles
used to gender Late Pleistocene people. The association of textiles and
basketry with just some of Venuses indicates that a variety of roles were
available to social females in addition to gender‐based ones and
that these roles were likely associated with achievements through female
labor and/or age or status.</p>
         <p>Both the fineness of some of the weaves and iconographic depictions
of this technology indicate that value was placed on these
plant‐based products. The iconographic recognition accorded to
textiles and basketry suggests that these products may have been
“symbols of excellence,” serving as important signifiers in
prestige economies and status demarcations. Furthermore, it seems clear
that whoever carved the clad Venuses was intimately familiar with fiber
technology. If the carvers were not the actual weavers or basket makers,
they must have been extensively guided by the latter’s knowledge and
expertise.</p>
         <p>Marshack’s (1991:29) observation
that “the Venus of Willendorf … was clearly richly and
elaborately clothed in inference and meaning” is true not only in the
allegorical sense but also literally. She and her sisters were indeed
richly and elaborately clad in the woven and plaited finery of their
time.</p>
