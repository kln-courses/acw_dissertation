If, however, his interest lies in the theory of personality, and if he is not terrified by an abstruse style and a multitude of new technical terms, his labors will be rewarded by a novel insight into the structure of personality. New Jersey Reformatory, Annandale D. T. GRIFFIN Contributi del Laboratorio di Psicologia. By A. GALLI, A. GEMELLI and others. Milan, Publ. Catholic Univ. Sacred Heart, 1931. Pp. 572. The sixth volume in series six (Biological Sciences) of the publications of the Catholic University of the Sacred Heart (Milan) contains 19 items. Spatial limita- tions preclude more than a brief statement concerning some of the more important. A. Galli, The perception of forms in peripheral vision. Perimetric method, Galli found, indicates 5 phases in perceptual reaction: (1) vague existence of something in visual field; (2) some form elements; (3) a figure formed of non-uniform parts, but without significance; (4) precise parted figure with meaning; (5) naming the form. A. Galli, Concerning the perception of apparent motion produced by different sensory stimuli. Apparent movement studied with variation of number and type of stimuli does not, the author concludes, exclusively support Gestalt theory. A. Galli, Contribution to the study of perception of changes in brightness and il- lumination. Differential threshold for the perception of both brightness and illumina- tion is increased, this study shows, with the increased speed of stimulus presen- tation. A. Gemelli, Researches on the diagnosis of motor ability. Gemelli concludes that the curve of apprenticeship is a more helpful index than aptitude tests. A. Gemelli and G. Pastori, On the reeducation of decerebrate animals. The au- thors found that decerebrate fowls are capable of reeducation. The remaining contributions were by A. Galli and A. Zama, Researches on the perception of plane geometric configurations masked in whole or part by other con- figurations; A. Gemelli, Emotions and sentiments; A. Gemelli, On the nature and genesis of character; A. Galli, Essay on the psychological analysis of the act of faith in Saint Augustine; A. Galli and L. Nechi, Researches on unstable children; A. Galli, Contributions to the study of moral judgments of normal and abnormal children; A. Gemelli, Current psychotechnical problems in national industry; A. Gemelli, On psychotechnic activity in the laboratory; A. Gemelli, On the nature of manual ability; A. Gemelli, Experimental researches on the forms of voluntary movement; A. Gemelli and A. Galli, On the adaptability of human action to machine action; A. Gemelli, On the value of simple reaction-time with respect to its applications to personal selection; A. Gemelli, Problems of experimental psychology in the study of physical exercise; A. Gemelli, On the selection of aviation pilots. Indiana University J. R. KANTOR Le sens de la direction et l'orientation lointaine chez l'homme. By PIERRE JAC- CARD. Preface by J. Larguier des Bancels. Paris, Bibliotheque Scientifique, Payot, 1932. Pp. 354. The author of this book on the sense of direction and remote orientation in men is not satisfied to give us a mere statement of this problem as it stands today, but he presents a rather exhaustive account of the way the relevant phenomena have been 362</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS regarded in the annals of human thought. On this account, and because of the critical scientific attitude of the author, the book is of significance. He does not hesitate to bring into the discussion mention of Noah's dove re- turning to the Ark, and other legendary incidents which indicate early views. Consider- able space is given to the legendary, the near scientific, and the scientific inquiry into the behavior of animals as regards their sense of direction and orientation at a dis- tance as well as to that of man. The latter is, of course, the main problem of the treatise. The author notes the efforts of the erudite mind to extricate itself from the anthropomorphic and fanciful interpretation of natural and psychological phenomena. One notes the author's severe criticism of Darwin for disregarding the now esteemed 'law of parsimony' with the implications of animistic meanings, and of even more recent interpretations such as are found in Jacques Loeb's mechanistic conception- for example in his "tropisms." Those who still hold to 'instinct' will find little com- fort here, and such speculative writers who are still willing to base their conclusions on reports from travelers on the sense of direction and orientation of the uncivilized will find that such peoples when placed under controlled conditions do not possess any such natural sense of direction. The book is to be regarded as a negative reaction to Levy-Bruhl's theories as they were accepted in France. For the 'mysterious sense of direction' or capacity for distant orientation in either animals or man, the author substitutes as a working principle the guidance by landmarks and other stimuli at hand of all such behavior. While further experimentation is still needed, doubtless this principle will eventually be established. It is noted that American psychologists have not fallen into the pitfalls of anthropomorphic interpretations of such behavior and of other instinctive conduct. University of Denver THOMAS R. GARTH Das erlebende Ich und sein Dasein. By OTTO JANSSEN. Berlin and Leipzig, Wal- ter de Gruyter &amp; Co., 1932. Pp. viii, 247. This book belongs to that German school of philosophical thought the develop- ment of which is marked by the names of Husserl, Scheler, and Heidegger. Its phe- nomenological method and its problems are not those of empirical psychology and cannot be represented adequately without a considerable discussion of the philosophi- cal implications. The book can be recommended only to the philosophically inter- ested and trained reader. The first part discusses the 'living and experiencing ego.' Ego is shown not to be subject to any definition; its chief characteristic is that of being a 'who' and not a 'what.' Emotions, wishes, attitudes in which the ego 'lives' constitute the sphere of the 'ego-belonging' (das Ichzugehorige) as opposed to the 'ego-strange' (das Ichfremde): colors, shapes, etc. However, pathological experience shows that the intrinsic bond between the 'ego' and the 'ego-belonging' can be loosened (deper- sonalization), and even the apparently impossible duplication of the ego in its own field is achieved in some cases of splitting of personality. In the second part the relation of ego to being and consciousness is discussed and relational theory of con- sciousness is sharply criticized. Of interest is the author's evaluation of the phenomenological method. Through- out the whole book he argues against the logistic interpretation of the phenomeno- logical findings which ascribes to them apodictic validity. He shows repeatedly that relationships apparently constitutive for the ego (e.g. its non-spatial character, its 363</page></plain_text>
