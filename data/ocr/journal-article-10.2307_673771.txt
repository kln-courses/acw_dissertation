Reviewed by BARBARA SMUTS Stanford University The Life of Monkeys is an unrecognized classic in the history of non-human primate films. Made in the early fifties before the emergence of broad interest in primate social behavior, this film describes all the major aspects of macaque social structure. This accomplishment alone would make the film significant, but it does so much more. The Life of Monkeys is truly an art film. It is an example of skillful utilization of the film medium to sharpen our understanding of the significance of various behaviors. For example, while the narrator (who speaks with a charming Japanese accent and has a flair for metaphoric description) speaks of the departure from the group of adole- scent males, the film shows a young male passing through the fence that surrounds the feeding area that the main group inhabits. Later on, when the narrator discusses the return of these adolescent males several years later, we see a larger, more confident- looking male re-enter the feeding area through the same fence. The true value of this technique becomes apparent when the viewer realizes that these shots represent more than just artful symbolism: it is evident from the narration that the fence has meaning for the monkeys as well. The high-ranking males and females are seldom found outside it, and the adolescent males rarely dare to cross this boundary. Another example: when the narrator describes the characteristic behavior of solitary males, the film shows a lone male, silhouetted against a darkening sky, gazing in the direction of the full troop visible in the foreground. By providing this visually effec- tive contrast, rather than simply showing a male alone going about his business-feeding, for example-the filmmakers have increased the chances that the viewer will remember the existence of solitary males in this species, and will recognize the full signifi- cance of solitarization in animals that are ordinarily highly social. During this same scene the narrator says, "How solitary he looks as he watches his playmates from afar!" I can almost hear my readers gasping, "Anthropomorphic!" and I will admit that it is. But I believe there are two kinds of anthropomorphizing. One kind is dangerous, the kind that utilizes facile references to human emotions in order to explain the significance of certain behaviors in other animals. This kind of anthro- pomorphizing substitutes analogy for analysis and thus violates the respected traditions of scientific methodology. But there is another type of anthropomorph- izing, the kind that simply and</page><page sequence="2">2008 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [75,1973] honestly makes explicit the kind of intuitive comparisons between human and animal behavior that all of us secretly succumb to anyway. This kind of anthropomorphizing reflects the highly significant fact that we can interpret aspects of monkey behavior more easily than, say, aspects of bird behavior, because there are real, biologically based continuations between humans and non-human primates. Admittedly, it is not always easy to distinguish these two types, but I am convinced that this film is not guilty of the first. If we assume that the more dangerous kind of anthropomorphizing interferes with lucid presentation of the facts, then the clarity and highly informative nature of this film strengthens my claim that The Life of Monkeys engages only in the harmless and, in my opinion, enriching form of anthro- pomorphism.</page></plain_text>
