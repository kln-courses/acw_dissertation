<plain_text><page sequence="1">116 BEGINNINGS OF SCULPTURAL ART IN SOUTH INDIA K.P. RAO* I 1.1 Indian sub-continent is one of the regions having the earliest stone carving traditions. The Indus valley stone sculptures are the earliest datable specimens going back to about 3000 B.C.1 But due to sorrïe unknown reasons, the sculptural art remained dormant for nearly two thousand years or more. So far it was generally believed that the sculptural art was revived only in the Mauryan period.2 But the recent studies of the stone anthropomorphic figures affiliated to the megalithic culture have revealed that the sculptural art was in vogue by at least 800 B.C. in South India. Though these anthropomorphic sculptures are known since 1868, 3 so far there is no attempt to evaluate these sculptures in the context of the burial practices, religion and their chronology. Even some of the works on the religion of the megalithic people4 have failed to take proper note of these sculptures. The present paper aims at discussing the chronology, beliefs and religious aspects connected with these anthropomorphic sculptures. 1.2 South India abounds in megalithic monuments. The entire region, upto the Vindhyas, is dotted with numerous megalithic sites. They range from simple pit and urn burials to elaborate dolmens and rock-cut chambers. The construction of monuments reveal great variety of form, requiring classification into different types and sub-types. The variety is not limited only to the mode of monument * AM-14124: Lecturer in History. S.V. University, Tirupati 517502</page><page sequence="2">K.P. Rao : Beginnings of Sculptural Art In South India erection, but also revealed in the internment method and funerary assemblage. On the whole the megalithic traditions reveal their belief in post-death life, spirits and worship of the dead. Whereas, animation of the dead is implied, but not directly evident, there are a few exceptional instances, where such a belief is . suggested by the association of stone anthropomorphic figures with the megalithic burials at a few places in South India. II MEGALITHIC ANTHROPOMORPHIC SCULPTURES 2.1 Stone anthropomorphic sculptures in association with the megalithic monuments are reported from Mottur5 in the North Arcot district of Tamil Nadu and Aihole6 in Karnataka and several sites in Andhra Pradesh. The sites yielding these figures in Andhra Pradesh are Midimalla7 in Chittor district; Domada,® Dongatogu,9 Galabha10 and Tottigutta11 in Khammam district; Kaperlaguru,12 Mungapet,13 Malur14 and Katapur15 in Warangal district and Lingala16 in Krishna district. On the whole about 40 such sculptures have come to light so far. 2.2 Depending on the features exhibited by these figures, they may be classified into five categories as under: i) A thick rectangular stone block is carved with a small, squarish projection at the top to represent the human head.17 The body maintains a uniform dimension up to the bottom and thus avoids suggestion of lower limbs. Kaperlaguru, Mungapet, Malluru in Warangal district and Dongatogu, Domada and Tottigutta in Khammam district have yielded such figures. ii) The second category of the anthropomorphic figures look like cruciform crosses.18 The projections on either side of the figure below the head represent hands, while projection at the centre is meant to represent the head. The body and the lower limbs are suggested by a uniform projection below the hands. The appearance of these stone crosses resemble like those of the Christian affiliation and as such led to such assignment by sogne scholars. But, there need be any doubt in this regard as these crosses pre-date the origin of Christianity. This point is proved in the following discussion on their chronology. iii) The third category of anthropomorphic figures appear like a wedge.19 They have a round head and curved outward shoulders. The body and lower limbs are suggested by tapering projection below the hands/shoulder portion. iv) The forth category of anthropomorphic figures reveal female features. These figures either have bulged breasts20 or they are suggested by two circles21 drawn at appropriate place. Sometimes even the stone crosses are identified with fair sex by drawing circles in this manner.22 v) The fifth category of figures look almost like the copper hoard anthropomorphic figures.23 They have a round head and in-curved hands. 665</page><page sequence="3">Proceedings , IHC : 53rd Session, 1992-93 Though legs are not suggested, a pedestal like elevation projecting laterally is provided, probably suggesting a seated figure. Some of these figures are carved headless24 with a depression at the area, where the neck/head should have been. V 2.3 The figures from Karnataka and Northern Andhra Pradesh are carved out of thick stone blocks. The figures from Tamil Nadu and southern parts of Andhra Pradesh are carved out of thick stone slabs. Though some figures from Khammam and Warangal districts are finished well with smooth even surface, most of the figures are very crudely chiselled. On the whole there was an attempt to represent human figure in a symbolic manner. The affiliation of these figures with the megalithic culture need not be doubted as these figures were sometimes found forming part of the megalithic monument as at Midimalla and in other instances they are planted inside or very near the megalithic monuments. 2.4 The general characteristics exhibited by these figures can be summarized as under: i) These figures represent human being in a very symbolic form; ii) no attempt is made to represent the lower limbs, though the elongated lower portion is meant to suggest trunk and lower limbs; iii) most of the figures do not reveal any sexual features; iv) when sexually identified they reveal female features only and so far anthropomorphic figures revealing male features have not come to light; v) no attempt is made to represent the sensory organs like ears, eyes, nose and mouth; vi) on an average these figures measure about 5 to 8 feet in height, though both smaller and taller figures also noticed at several places; and vii) these figures are carved in round and reveal three-dimensional perspective. III CHRONOLOGY 3.1 There are four regions which have yielded these anthropomorphic figures. It appears that we may have to fix independent chronology to each ui these regions. Our task is simplified in the case of Aihole anthropomorphic figure as the chronology for that group of megaliths was worked out well by Sundara.25 He fixes 800-600 B.C. for the megaliths of Aihole group and as such that range may be applied to the figure from Aihole. 3.2 In Tamil Nadu the dolmenoid cists with port hole on the east type are fixed to around 500 B.C. by Narasimhaiah.26 The anthropomorphic figure at Mottur was found in association with this type of megalith and hence same date may be 666</page><page sequence="4">K.P. Rao : Beginnings of Sculptural Art In South India assigned to the figure found there. The anthropomorphic figures found at Midimalla in Chittor district, a contiguous region to North Arcot district, also should be assigned the same date as the figures are very similar. 3.3 The chronology for the anthropomorphic figures from Khammam and Warangal districts has to be worked out on the basis of similarity shown in the mode of construction of the monuments since proper chronology for this group is not available. Dolmenoid cists with dressed stone circles are the type of monuments found in association with the anthropomorphic figures in this region. The characteristic feature of these stone circles is that the circle stones are dressed internally and externally to form a perfect circle. Similar monuments with dressed stone circles are noticed at Gadachimalki 27 and the type (Konnur type) are dated between 1200-700 B.C. Apart from this, the megaliths under consideration show similarity with the megaliths from Vidarbha in respect of funerary assemblage. Megaliths of both these regions have yielded iron horse bits, suggesting contemporanity. The Vidarbha megaliths have yielded dates ranging 'from 8th Century B.C. to third Century B.C. in general.28 Taking" cue from the Karnataka and Vidarbha evidence we may be justified in fixing a range of 800 B.C. to 500 B.C. for the megaliths and the stone sculptures from Khammam and Warangal districts. 3.4 From the above discussion it follows that the date of the anthropomorphic figures range anywhere between 800 B.C. and 50Ö B.C., and is likely to be pushed back if more precise information is available. IV TRADITIONS AND RELIGIOUS BELIEFS 4.1 Having thus considered the general features, provenance and the chronological aspects of the megalithic anthropomorphic figures, we may now dwell on the traditions and religious beliefs connected with these figures. The megalithic tradition primarily suggests their belief in veneration of the dead, post-death life, ghost or spiril. Whereas their belief in these aspects could be well understood from the evidence presented by numerous burials all over the world, the reasons and beliefs behind the association of anthropomorphic figures could not be' understood fully from such evidence. In this respect, probably we have to rely on the ethnographic data on the tribal people like Kurumbas, Gadabas, Nagas, Mundas, Savaras, Gonds, Morias, etc. who practice megalithism even to this day.29 4.2 The worship of the natural objects like hills, stones and trees is a phenomenon of the tribal religion. The South Indian tribes like Marias, Gonds, Saoras (also called Savaras), Kurumbas worship standing stones (planted by them), wooden posts and anthropomorphic figures. The tribais consider such objects as representations of the spirits or God. For example Gonds believe that the spirit of a dead person will enter a stone.30 Amongst the Marias and the Gonds the worship of the dead is represented by the erection of pillars and menhirs.31 A 667</page><page sequence="5">Proceedings , IHC : 53rd Session , 1992-93 further progress towards idolatory is probably indicated by the worship of crudely carved pillars with a large circle near the head.32 This indicates their effort to identify the venerated object with some human form.33 This is because of their belief that the god is invariably in human form. The anthropomorphic representations encountered alongwith the megalithic burials have to be viewed in this perspective. 4.3 The veneration of the stone or wooden pillars and figures that are associated with the death ceremonies could be well understood from the practices of some tribais. Marias apply turmeric and oil and offer rice ąnd sacrifice a buffalo while worshipping the stone in which they believe the spirit of the dead had entered.34 The Saoras, before sowing, take the seed to these pillars and sacrifice some animal to promote the fertility of the harvest.35 Similarly the Alu Kurumbas, when in difficulty approach the megalithic burials of their ancestors with favourite foods and drinks and implore them to help in tiding over the difficulties. This prayer, the Alu Kurumbas believe, will never fail in its objective.36 The Gonds mention three reasons for 'erecting pillars and dolmens to commemorate the dead. Firstly, the spirit of the dead not to wander after death; secondly they must not worry or harm the decendants; and thirdly, they must help by bringing rain and driving away the harmful spirits.37 The Badagas believe that a dolmen is the residence of their God and they would never allow any damage to these monuments.38 Thus the beliefs and the customs of the tribal people suggest worship of the dead. The menhirs and pillars are erected mainly for the purpose of worship of the ancestors. This tendency led to personification and idolatory, which is reflected in the erection of anthropomorphic figures. 4.4 We may now make an attempt to understand the reasons behind some of the anthropomorphic figures having female features. The Savaras carve female features to the wooden pillars erected for the dead women.39 Does this suggest that the anthropomorphic figures with female features were erected for the females who have died? Probably we need more corroborative evidence before coming to a conclusion. Similarly, mystery shrouds the headlesés anthropomorphic figures, one each found at Midimalla and Mottur. According to a tradition prevalent at Mottur,40 the figure is named Valiyar Daivam (God of Valiyara). Once they came to know that it would rain, fire and they would be perished if they stayed at that place. To escape the conflagration they decided to move southward. They requested their God to accompany them, but on refusal to do so, they cut his head and took it- with them. We do not know how far this tradition explains the real belief behind the headless anthropomorphic figures. The tradition of making headless anthropomorphic figures (in clay) goes back to chalcolithic times as evident at Inamgaon.41 Dhavalikar mentions about the worship of a headless goddess by Warlis, a tribe on the west coast in Thane district.42 She is called Palghat, meaning the position of the woman at the time of giving birth to a child. But this tradition does not come handy for explaining the occurrence of headless anthropomorphic figures of megalithic period. Unfortunately even the available ethnographic data does not give any clue to explain such figures. Probably, collection of more ethnographip.data may help us in understanding the reasons behind the headless anthropomorphic figures. 668</page><page sequence="6">K.P. Rao : Beginnings of Sculptural Art In South India V 5.1 In retrospect, we may conclude that some of the megalithic stone sculptures could be dated to atleast 800 B.C. The early dates assigned to megalithic monuments need not be doubted, considering the recent evidence from Komarananhalli which has yielded dates of about 1300 B.C. (thermoluminescence) for the megalithic culture.43 From the available evidence it is also understandable that these anthropomorphic sculptures are meant for veneration of the dead. Thus the roots of the sculptural tradition on Indian soil could be traced to the practices prevalent among the megalithic folk of South India by about 800 B.C. This may probably call for review of the prevailing opinion that the sculptural tradition was revived only in the Mauryan period, in view of the evidence presented above. NOTES AND REFERENCES 1. C.
