<plain_text><page sequence="1">Bamum Thrones and Stools CHRISTRAUD GEARY Thrones and stools are among the most striking examples of pres- tige sculpture from the Grassfields, a plateau area in western Cameroon. The Grassfields is inhabited by populations of diverse origins and divided into numerous political units, which in pre- colonial times ranged from stateless societies to highly centralized states. Complicated networks of internal and long-distance trade linked these units, which displayed an extraordinary de- gree of economic specialization. They were embedded in systems of alliances leading to gift exchanges in which paraphernalia of high status, and even masquerades, were included (Rowlands 1979: 4). Economic and political fragmen- tation coupled with homogeneity spring- ing from regionally comprehensive ties find their mirror image in the art produc- tion of the region. Art objects display an easily recognizable general style, which fragments upon closer examination be- cause of craft specialization resulting from the complex nature of the internal relationships. One of the stylistically dis- tinct areas is Bamum, the largest and most centralized of the states formed in pre-colonial times, that is, before 1900.' In Bamum, thrones and stools of the kings (fon)2 and the queen mothers (na- fon; na=mother) belonged to a court structure marked by strict hierarchy and the division into two major components: the nobility of the palace, that is, the high-ranking retainers; and the members of the royal patrilineage. While the re- tainers, recruited from peoples subdued by the Bamum in the course of their ex- pansion from the 17th century onward, can be considered as an element sup- porting the king, the male members of the royal lineage, particularly the king's brothers, posed a constant threat to his rule. The king had to maintain a delicate balance between those two groups in order to secure his position at the apex of the socio-political, economic, and religi- ous spheres. During several periods of Barnum history, this equilibrium was dis- turbed when the princes killed the king or when the palace retainers usurped power. Numerous titled officeholders formed the highest echelon of retainerdom. These included the heads of the retain- ers' secret societies, of which the regula- tory society mutngu was the most in- fluential, exercising police functions and enforcing royal sanctions. Other retain- ers held appointments as the heads of the palace guards or chamberlains. Simi- larly, members of the royal patrilineage had a number of offices at their disposal. They could act as the heads of their re- spective secret societies (e.g., ngiirri) and in supervisory functions relating to the organization of the royal lineage. This court structure finds expression in an abundance of emblems and visual symbols that indicate the position of an individual within the hierarchy. They in- clude the panoply from loincloths and headdresses-Bamum men of high status wore only these two articles of clothing before Muslim full dress was introduced-to items of personal adornment and military accoutrements. The king enjoyed a monopoly over the valuable materials used for their produc- tion: brass, imported fabrics, imported beads, as well as certain game (leopard, lion, elephant, buffalo, python, hip- popotamus, crocodile, and hyena) and their hides, teeth (ivory), and claws. The configuration of the materials as well as the materials themselves has relevance to aspects of rank and status. Specific motifs, ranging from the famous double-headed serpent to the much more commonly applied frog motif,3 were royal prerogatives. The display of such prestige goods and motifs by members of the court organiza- tion was a privilege bestowed by the kings and was an indicator of a person's standing. While some insignia went with specific offices to which the king appointed courtiers for a given period of time (usually for three years), more per- manent privileges were given by the king to his loyal followers, whose lineages kept the right to display these emblems when the initial recipient died. Only the royal recognition of the heir was required for each successor. Elabora- tion of specific visual attributes as well as exclusiveness marked high rank, distin- guishing members of the court from the masses, the descendants of subjugated lineages. The court in all its splendor was the focal point of Bamum society. The suc- cessful manipulation of materials and emblematic objects by the king and the display of wealth at the court was a con- stant reminder of the all-encompassing power of the central authority: the king and the court organization. Gaining the privilege to possess such objects strengthened the alliance between the favored subject and the king. Ownership of prestige goods and the permission to display certain motifs clearly carried a political message of solidarity between subject and king. The objects, many of them of artistic value, may be considered as political art. None of the several Grassfields states with similar institutions underwent as rapid a culture change as did Bamum, and nowhere was the traditional political organization more transformed than in prosperous Foumban, the kingdom's capital. Two events led to the abolition of the traditional court hierarchy, and with it the abandonment of its traditional vis- ual aspects. King Njoya, who ruled circa 1887 to 1924 and was nominally king until his death in 1933,4 embraced Islam early in his reign and began to fashion the kingdom according to the example of the Muslim Fulbe states in the northern parts of present Nigeria and Cameroon. The impact of Islam on social structure, court ritual, and ceremonial life was ini- tially not very pronounced. As Islam won more and more followers, after a short interlude of German colonial dominance from 1902 to 1915 and abor- tive efforts to introduce Christianity to members of the court, many of the insig- nia and emblematic objects began to lose their immediate significance, although they were still displayed. With the prog- ress of Islamization, the court took on the appearance of a northern Muslim court. To this day this is the general im- pression of the casual visitor to Foum- ban. Much more serious repercussions re- sulted from the unhappy relationship of King Njoya with the French administra- tion, which officially abolished the Bamum kingdom in 1924 after years of conflict with the "African despot," as the French perceived Njoya. The conflict culminated in Njoya's banishment to Yaounde in 1931; he never saw his king- dom again, dying two years later. The 32</page><page sequence="2">king's exile sounded the death knell for whatever had remained of the traditional kingdom. Over the years, the annual ceremonies in which wealth and royal splendor were displayed were aban- doned in favor of Muslim-style equest- rian concourses. Masquerades, usually performed in connection with these cel- ebrations, were discontinued as well. The pre-Islamic attributes of kingship-a scepter, called the "staff of the land," a royal drinking horn, a royal bag, numer- ous headdresses, and the thrones and stools--slowly lost their meaning, al- though even today they are occasionally displayed in an effort to recreate the splendors of the past. We owe to King Njoya's pronounced historical interest and to the present Sultan Seidou's per- severance the preservation of these ob- jects now in the little museum at the palace entrance in Foumban. Much of Bamum's traditional wealth did not re- main in Foumban, however, but found its way into European collections. A final step leading to the desecration of these objects was forced on the Bamum immediately after King Njoya's death in exile. In 1933, the French admin- istration put on public display all the sacra of the secret societies as well as royal objects usually hidden from public sight, destroying their aura of secrecy.s However, not all pieces shown in 1933 and subsequently kept in the Palace Mu- seum remained accessible to the public, as is evident by a comparison of the 1941 inventory of the museum with its pre- sent contents. In this typewritten docu- ment prepared for the French adminis- trator of the subdivision, 485 objects are listed, including many more masks, royal drinking horns, and other impor- tant pieces than can be found in the mu- seum today. In 1977, the Palace Museum contained 467 objects, which included a number of marginal or new pieces. The discrepancy between the inventories can be attributed partly to theft or secret sale, and also to the removal of some very im- portant objects to the private chambers of the Sultan. Three monumental thrones form the core of the Palace Museum's collection. Two of them have a female figure at the back (Figs. 1, 2); the third and largest throne, with two figures at the back and a separate footrest, shows the most complex composition (Fig. 3). In addi- tion there are three monoxylous royal stools (Figs. 5-7). The Bamum refer to the thrones as mandu yene and to the stools as rii mfo' (rii=stool, mfo'=king). The greatest puzzle in regard to the thrones is the similarity between the famous example in the Museum fiir Vl61ker- kunde in Berlin (Fig. 4) and the largest Foumban throne. Speculation on whether or not one of the two is a copy, and if so, which one, has frequently sur- faced in the literature (e.g., Wittmer 1976: 177 f.; Gebauer 1979: 89). The problem has never been discussed in detail, but evidence will be presented here that may help to resolve this issue. All thrones in the Palace Museum and the throne in Berlin combine a cylindrical stool (composed of a base ring and a carved portion connecting base and seat) and figures at its back. The standing fig- ures are three-quarters visible above the base, which is characterized by open- work carving with a double-headed ser- pent motif. The unbeaded throne with the female figure, which was never meant to be covered with the beads, is carved from one block of wood (Fig. 1); this may be true of the other thrones as well, but their bead- and cowrie-covered surface does not permit us to draw a de- finite conclusion about their construc- tion. Two of the cylindrical stools in the Palace Museum also have a beaded cov- ering (Figs. 5, 7), while the third stool seems to have lost it (Fig. 6). The production technique of thrones and stools is well known and can still be observed in Foumban. The carvings are covered with burlap-like cloth held in place by iron pegs.6 Then strands of either highly valued cylindrical blue beads (n tam) or small seed beads (memmi) are affixed to the fabric with the so-called lazy stitch; the strand is fastened to the fabric after approximately every six beads rather than after each one, making the embroidery loose. Cowries, which in pre-colonial times were the standard of value in Bamum (the term for cowries, mbiim, today means "money"), were used, in addition to varieties of imported beads, to embroider seats and as contrast around the rims. Cowries appeared in Bamum shortly after 1850 in connection with expansion of trade to the north and contact with the Fulbe (Tardits 1980:317). Although it is very fortunate that sev- eral thrones and stools are still in their original location, the rapid culture change in Bamum during the past sixty years makes it difficult, if not impossible, to answer all questions about these splendid works of art. Our major con- cern here will be the establishment of a chronology for these pieces and their at- tribution to the reigns of particular kings, taking into consideration several other thrones and stools in European col- 1.

If it is possible to establish a chronological sequence of the thrones and stools, can we trace any stylistic de- velopment in Bamum court art, which seems at first glance to be constant in its adherence to dearly formulated stylistic conventions? Can we then learn any- thing more about the context and mean- ing of these thrones? Information collected in Foumban by interviews with old princes and palace retainers proved to be less useful than expected in establishing a chronological sequence for the thrones. For example, the throne with the female figure (Fig. 2) was erroneously attributed by them to the reign of King Mbuembue, a charis- matic leader who ruled from the 1820s to the 1840s. Under his reign, tremendous economic and social changes occurred, shaping the kingdom into the entity the Germans encountered when visiting Foumban for the first time in 1902. Suc- cessful military campaigns gave the Bamum the necessary human resources to strengthen their position in the long- distance trading network connecting the Grassfields through intermediaries with the European trading frontier in the coastal areas of Cameroon and Nigeria. The coastal economies evolved around the slave trade, and since Bamum could indirectly provide slaves, the flow of prestige items of European manufacture (beads, fabrics, brass rods) into Bamum increased from a trickle to a steady stream (Tardits 1980: 358 ff.). The wealth of the court under the king's control in- creased. The servile masses at the dis- posal of the Bamum also meant new re- sources in human labor for the court, which began to support a much larger organization than had existed under the previous rulers. Among the captives were highly skilled artisans (brass casters, bead embroiders, weavers, potters, and sculptors) whom Mbuembue resettled at the court in Foumban.7 Their impact on Bamum art poses an important question to art historians, especially since the Bamum themselves claim that arts were introduced under King Mbuembue only Oral traditions state that the Bamum migrated to the area around Foumban in the 17th century under the founder of the kingdom, Nshare Yen. He descended from the dynasty of the Tikar chiefdom Rifum, the present Bankim. Unfortu- nately, the art traditions of the likar are little known, and thus we can only guess at the kind with which the Bamum were familiar. Although the effort to isolate Bamum stylistic features from styles formulated by the artists of the subju- gated populations before their incorpo- ration is important, attention here will be directed toward finding a motive for the resettlement in Foumban of the artisans beyond that often stated one: the lack of artistic skills in the Bamum proper. Even though the Bamum may have possessed artistic capabilities and appropriate technology, the relocation of the artisans was a significant step in es- tablishing Bamum dominance in the vis- ual domain. Appropriating the artists themselves seems to be the logical exten- sion of the tendency of dominant Grassfields states to take over and man- ipulate the visual symbols of subjugated populations, the regalia and emblems of the elite and of secret societies. Such ob- jects were frequently not only displayed as war trophies but also integrated into the rituals of the victor's secret societies or into court ceremonies, becoming a constant reminder of the victors' superiority. The conquered artists' work for the Bamum court served a similar purpose and also enhanced the court's overall wealth and prestige. The Bamum thus perfected the system of visual con- quest by appropriating not only the ob- jects of those they conquered but also the creators of the objects themselves. At the same time, their work for the court must have been a strong integrative factor for the kingdom as a whole. With increased resources of prestige goods and the presence of numerous artisans working with a variety of media, art production at the Bamum court expanded. Thus, under Mbuembue's patronage we see the formulation of the court style as we know it today (Wittmer 1976:60 f.). Little wonder that Bamum informants insist that all very old objects belong to Mbuembue's reign! Contrary to the opinion of the old princes and retainers, the Palace Mu- seum inventory of 1941 attributes the throne in Figure 2 to King Nguwuo, an attribution supported by other sources. This king ruled in the 1850s and 1860s. There were probably witnesses of Nguwuo's reign still alive when the in- ventory was compiled-or at least their direct descendants were-and this strengthens the attribution. 4.

In this rich but some- times difficult to interpret document, two passages mention thrones. One paragraph concerns the royal burial:9 "When a king ... died, a circular pit grave was dug and the deceased was wrapped into a mfuet cloth. Two double gongs (nkuem) were thrown into the grave. The feet and the knees ... were encircled with two leg rings (tangkut). He was given a bead necklace and a brass collar (mbagmba), ivory bracelets, and on top of that another large ivory bracelet. An artificial beard of beads was attached to his chin and his head was covered with a beaded cap. The corpse was seated on a chair decorated with a bead- covered statue. A leopard skin was placed in front of him for his feet to rest on. The nja sword [a sword for the nja fes- tival], from which hung two little bells and two pieces of a reed-like plant (mbuet), was put in his hand. He was en- veloped in a cloth mekpi-nso' and in another cloth called ntie shiie and other less important cloths were added to pre- vent the corpse from touching the earth. The corpse was seated on the chair and the ngiirri double gong [a gong for a se- cret society of princes] placed on his right, the mbansie double gong [a gong for society of warriors] was placed on his left. On his left was also a sheathed sword. The tobacco pipe was put on his chest. On his right was placed a bag con- taining a drinking horn (nduu). Ten spears were also placed on his right. In front of him was the friction drum for the nguon festival (nguon) and behind him the instrument of the secret society mfomu (mfomu); in front of him was also a calabash of wine and cola nuts in a basket ... Then they proceeded to fill the grave" (Njoya 1952:81 f.).10 This account, found accurate by Claude Tardits, who worked among the Bamum for many years, provides us with an excellent description of the royal paraphernalia deemed most essential. We know from it that the king was buried while sitting on a beadcovered throne decorated with a figure (it is not specified whether male or female), a throne very much like the one attributed to King Nguwuo. However, King Nguwuo and all his successors did not receive a tradi- tional royal burial. A former high- ranking retainer, Nguwuo had usurped the kingship when the legitimate heirs of the royal lineage in their fight over suc- cession imperiled the existence of the kingdom. Although he seemingly ruled successfully for twenty years, he was never considered the legitimate sovereign by the members of the royal lineage. Even today, old Bamum princes, when asked about King Nguwuo, de- nounce him as the "slave king" who only let the kingdom decay He was ultimately killed or he killed himself, according to differing versions of the oral tradition, and was denied a royal burial. This fact may well account for the survival of this throne. The second throne backed with a female figure (Fig, 1) was described sim- ply as "old" by Bamum princes and palace retainers. However, its stylistic features suggest that it is more recent than the other two thrones in the Palace- Museum, and this is confirmed by the 1941 inventory. There, the piece is de- scribed as an "incomplete throne which King Njoya commissioned to be carved as an imitation of King Nguwuo's throne. The carved back represents a woman who holds a calabash ..."11 This attribution appears highly likely be- cause the throne compares favorably on a stylistic basis to other carvings dating from the second half of Njoya's rule. Among these late works are pieces ex- pressing Njoya's growing historical con- sciousness, such as a portrait head of King Mbuembue. The carving of this throne is unfinished in places, especially where the torso merges with the seat. A beaded covering was apparently never intended because the throne is painted dark blue and white. The loincloth and neck ornament were added later. The third throne in the Palace Mu- seum (Fig. 3) and its counterpart in the Museum fir V61kerkunde, Berlin (Fig. 4), have an intriguing history. To this day, old Bamum men proudly insist that King Njoya sent the throne of his father, Nsangu, to Berlin, but before doing so had a copy made for his own use and for the memory of the Bamum people, which supposedly remained in Foum- ban and is now part of the Palace Mu- seum collections. King Nsangu ruled from approximately 1870 to 1887 after he had ousted King Nguwuo, the usurper. When Nsangu was killed in a battle with the neighboring Nso, his head was brought to the Nso king, who kept it as a war trophy in his palace. Its recovery was crucial to Nsangu's successor, his young son Njoya, because the head of the deceased predecessor plays an im- portant part in the installation ritual of the new king. During the first years of Njoya's reign, his mother, Njapun- dunke, ruled for the boy, but once he had reached adulthood, he managed to repel the attempt of the retainerdom to over- throw him and took command. In 1906, he used a German attack on the rebelli- ous Nso to his ends, and the Germans actually returned his father's skull to Foumban (Der Kopf des Bamum-Herrschers 1907: 258f.). Gratitude prompted Njoya in 1908 to present the German Kaiser with the magnificent throne now in Ber- lin. Before it was transported to the coast, accompanied by Njoya himself, he 5.

PHOTO: FRANZ THORBECKE. had his photograph taken sitting on the throne (Fig. 9); his good relationship with the Germans is further expressed in his imitation and adaptation of German uniforms (see the beaded epaulettes of the retainers) produced by his own tailors. In this case, Njoya followed the tradition of visual manipulation by vol- untarily displaying a German style of clothing. A* later photograph (taken by Franz Thorbecke in 1912 in Foumban) shows the king sitting on the counter- part of the throne sent to Germany (Fig. 8). By this time, Njoya's relationship with the Germans had cooled, and he and his courtiers wear Muslim attire in a striking display of new alliances with the neighboring Fulbe. The swift assimila- tion of new ideas and the innovative ef- forts of the Bamum elite become obvious here. Only once does Njoya mention his fa- ther Nsangu's throne in the Histoire. In a narrative about King Nsangu, it is re- ported that he demanded his throne be placed on the shiri, an elevated place where the king sat during ceremonies. He then sat down on the "chair," whose statues at the back had the names Ghane and Paansha, obviously the male and female figures (Njoya 1952: 61). Martin, the translator of the Histoire, remarks in his commentary that the throne men- tioned here was later sent to Berlin (Njoya 1952: 265). Other sources, however, clearly con- tradict these remarks. A report by Anna Rein-Wuhrmann, a missionary in Foumban in 1911-1915 and 1920-1922, con- tains information gathered from her missionary colleagues, especially the Reverend G6hring, who actually wit- nessed the event. Her report also points out some of the tragicomic aspects of the gift exchange between the African and the German sovereign, a reflection of the misunderstanding between colonial power and colonial subjects. According to Rein-Wuhrmann: "Nschoja liked to call the German Kaiser his friend. And he wanted to honor him with a 'sign of his hand,' a memento. . . For this reason his black Majesty commissioned a throne chair, which was a faithful copy of his own ... A broad seat and the two fig- ures that served as a backrest were carved out of a huge tree trunk. They de- picted court guardians who await the commands of their lord with drinking horn and tobacco pipe.12 The entire heavy throne was then artistically cov- ered with colored glass beads and was really a splendid piece of African artistry. It now stands in the V61kerkun- demuseum in the Reich's capital city. Naturally Nschoja looked forward to the Kaiser's return gift ... It turned out to be a big disappointment, because the friend in Europe did not know the Afri- can taste and was poorly advised in this situation. He bought a musical apparatus as big as a chest with record discs like wagon wheels and sent this or- chestrion to Foumban. The ... king, however, had no appreciation of Euro- pean music and had no idea what to do with the apparatus. The discs were played through a couple of times and by that time the mechanism had already been ruined. In the first rainy season it already suffered from the moisture and fell prey to rust" (Rein-Wuhrmann 1931: 19 f.). Another document, this time from Njoya himself, also attests to the fact that the Berlin throne is the copy of his fa- ther's throne. After the Germans were forced to leave Foumban in 1915, the British occupied the town for several months before handing it over to the French. In an attempt to establish a good 9. KING NJOYA IN 1908, SEATED ON THE THRONE THAT LATER WENT TO BERLIN. BASEL MISSION ARCHIVES. 37</page><page sequence="7">relationship with the new colonial power, Njoya sent a letter of submission to the "Great King of the English," which, after a strong denunciation of the Germans, ends with the following para- graph: "There is a small thing in my hand which I wish to offer humbly to the En- glish king. It will be nothing in his eyes. It is the chair in which I and my fathers have always sat and which is my strength and power. Also the two large elephant tusks which are on each side of it [see Fig. 3]. There are no other tusks in the country. The chair and the tusks are nothing to the Great King, but they are all I have. I, Njoya, and all my headmen and all my people I agree to the English flag which hangs in my town and I give greetings three times and give my land and all that I have to the English" (Public Record Office, London, 1916: Co 649 7 9532). 13 If one takes into account the archival evidence, oral information, and hints in the literature, it seems warranted to con- clude that the older piece remained in Foumban, while the newer carving went to Berlin. Is it possible, though, to con- firm this finding by comparing the stylis- tic features of the two thrones? The beadcovering on the thrones makes it difficult to distinguish the qual- ity of the carving underneath and in par- ticular to determine whether the carving of each one is fully articulated or whether the more recent piece was exe- cuted with the future beadcover taken into account. As Wittmer observes, there has been a tendency toward simplifica- tion of the carving when bead embroid- ery is intended (1976: 169). Some beaded figures show no articulation of the face at all, the bead design replacing the once carved features. The two thrones are comparable in size. The piece in Berlin is 175 centimet- ers high, only 3 centimeters shorter than the throne in Foumban, and its footrest is 117 centimeters long, only 2 centimeters shorter than the Foumban carving. The only significant distinction is the exag- gerated size and imbalance of the drinking horn that the male figure of the Berlin throne holds in its hand. The figures on the Foumban example, especially the two warriors on top of the footrest, also seem to be more rounded in their execu- tion. Since a comparison of the actual carv- ing underneath is impossible, the bead- work on the thrones may provide addi- tional information. The color scheme of the Berlin throne follows much stricter conventions than does its counterpart, and in this it resembles other older beaded objects in the Palace Museum. Blue tones dominate. Blue cylindrical and very valuable beads cover the male figure's body and the stool rims, and the embroidery covering the female's body as well as the bodies of the male figures on the openwork footrest shows differ- ent shades of light blue contrasted with black or blue beads. Patches of red beads correspond to the fabric used as the back- ing for the embroidery This flannel-like fabric, called pet by the Bamum, came from the coast and was highly valued. A few pink, yellowish, and white beads were used in addition to cowries for cov- ering the seat, the top of the footrest, and the rims. The beadwork on the throne in Foum- ban, affixed to burlap-like cloth, does not have as balanced a color scheme; indeed, one of its most striking features is the polychrome covering on the main fig- ures. Yellow and green beads are used in addition to blue, red, and white ones. Al- though the specific color scheme could be the result of availability of beads rather than aesthetic preference or color symbolism, what we see here is actually the result of restoration and repair. Old photographs allow us to date the major repair effort between 1933 and 1935, that is, immediately after King Njoya's death. By this time, the Bamum artisans had adopted the vivid colors that have become the trademark of new beaded objects. The oldest photograph of the Foumban throne dates from 1912 and shows the original beadcover (Fig. 8). Although the color scheme cannot be determined from this black and white photograph, the female's body appears to be monochrome, while the male's body is covered with the prestigious cylindrical dark blue beads, as it is to this day The treatment of the necks is in- teresting; that of the male figure shows a checkerboard design (no Barnum name could be found for this motif),14 and that of the female a zigzag design, the spear motif. The accurate fit of the beadcover enhances the well-defined underlying facial features (eye sockets, noses, and mouths). The openwork carving of the double-headed serpent on the stool por- tion likewise shows more articulation in the 1912 photograph. When Labouret (1935c: 117) photographed Sultan Seidou next to this throne in 1933/34 it still had the original beadwork, although it showed signs of disrepair. The lower right edge of the footrest had rotted away. By 1935, when a German traveler took another photograph of the throne (Kemner 1941: opp. p. 256), the female figure had been recovered, while the male figure remained in its original em- broidery In the course of these restora- tions, the new fabric to be embroidered was pulled so tightly over the figures' faces that the articulation was obscured, as were the details of the carving in the double-headed serpent.is5 Another large Bamum throne is found in the Cameroon holdings of the Rautenstrauch-Joest-Museum in Col- ogne (Fig. 13). Its history is similar to that of the example in Berlin. It was donated to the Grand Duke of Baden by a certain Baron von Puttkammer, who was un- doubtedly Jesco von Puttkammer, the governor of Kamerun from 1895 to 1907; thus the throne would have been col- lected before 1907.16 The Cologne exam- ple retains the base with the openwork double-headed serpent motif, but its back reflects the adoption of a European chair type into the repertoire of the Bamum court carvers. Rather than hav- ing two single figural elements, as do the older ceremonial thrones, it has an openwork backrest that repeats the double-headed serpent motif. With a tentative chronology of the thrones established, let us look more closely at some of their stylistic features. The oldest throne with the female figure, dating to 1850-1865, represents the Bamum court style at its most subtle and elegant (Fig. 2). It shows a high degree of naturalism in the proportion of head to body Furthermore, the ratio of figure to base differs from those for the other thrones: a larger part of the figure is visi- ble. This elegant balance contributes to the figure's calm and reassuring expres- sion. The face, even though covered with bead embroidery, compares favora- bly with the faces of masks from the same early period in the Palace Museum. Thus, a female head crest dating from the 1860s provides us with an example of what may be hidden underneath the beads (Fig. 10). Its slightly damaged face (mainly the lower lip) has lost its bead- cover, and the carving displays some of the elements of the court style. The eyes and the disc-like lips protrude from con- cave areas that divide the face into three portions. The back of the nose is almost flat and merges into the cheeks, while the alae are well-pronounced semicir- cles. The face is elegantly elongated and the surface is smooth. Nsangu's throne (1865-1885) already shows heavier set figures with rounder, more massive faces. A male figure, 81 centimeters high, which serves as the gigantic handle of a clapperless iron bell, provides us with an excellent compara- tive example (Fig. 11). The torn bead- cover reveals a slightly rounder face than that of the older female head crest (Fig. 10). It displays the stylistic features noted for that piece, though the face lacks some of its refinement. The surface is rougher in texture, with adze marks clearly visi- ble. Finally, the throne of Njoya's later reign, probably carved in the 1920s, shows a figure with facial features that are plump and overly round (Fig. 1). The head is large in relation to the body, even though the upper torso and arms are disproportionately long.17 In sum, a consideration of the figural elements of the thrones clearly demon- strates a shift in the Bamum court style between 1850 and 1930 from elongated, 38</page><page sequence="8">elegant forms to those more heavy-set and round.18 An analysis of the bases of the thrones shows that the openwork of the oldest (Fig. 2) is less baroque in its configura- tion than that of the later thrones (Figs. 1, 3, 4, 8) and that of a stool also displaying the double-headed serpent motif (Fig. 7). While the front part of the oldest throne shows only two large serpent heads, which contributes to its classic and serene appearance, the other thrones display a multitude of twisting and intertwined serpents, with three heads (slightly smaller than those on the oldest throne) visible from the front. The poor condition of the oldest throne's beadwork unfortunately prohibits any conclusion about the color scheme; in later examples, the surface design is very colorful. This elaboration of sculptural forms and surface designs on the bases parallels the growing complexity in the configuration of the thrones. The beadcovered footrests of the double-figure thrones are an additional enhancement. Both show an interesting openwork design of "dancing" retain- ers,19 one of the few instances in Grassfields arts where the impression of actual movement is conveyed. This ef- fect is created by the unusual profile po- sitioning of the retainers' bodies, which contrasts with the frontal view of the faces, and by the rhythmic repetition of the motif. Two warrior figures are fas- tened atop each side of the benchlike footrest. The warriors carry flintlock guns, introduced to Bamum during the reign of King Gbetnkom, Mbuembue's immediate successor, who ruled shortly before 1850 (Tardits 1980:140). Any Bamum pieces depicting flintlock guns therefore can be dated to the second half of the 19th century. Although the bead embroidery of the two large double-figure thrones has al- ready been discussed, a few remarks should be added about the oldest throne in the Palace Museum (Fig. 2) and the piece in the Rautenstrauch-Joest- Museum, Cologne (Fig. 13). In the former, the remnants of embroidery show a color scheme restricted, as we should expect, to three colors: dark blue (in the cylindrical beads on the torso of the figure), red, and white. Decorative motifs are restrained. In the latter exam- ple, which can be dated to the first half of Njoya's reign and certainly prior to 1907, the beadwork differs both in color and the variety of beads. The bodies of the serpents are covered with beads larger in diameter than the commonly used seed beads. Colors include a vivid light blue, bright red, white, and black. There is sketchy information about the historic development of these thrones, their cultural context, and their sym- bolism. In most regions of Africa, seating is an important indicator of a person's rank and prestige, an expression of au- thority (Fraser &amp; Cole 1972; Thompson 1974; Sieber 1980: 108 ff.). In the Grassfields to this day, the highest- ranking person in a group occupies the highest and most elaborate seat. The lofty position may be achieved by spatial arrangements-placing the stool on a ledge or slight rise-or by the height of the stool itself. In Bamum royal seating, both aspects are present: thrones were extraordinary in size and were also set on an elevated area (called shiri). So posi- tioned, the king held audiences, sat in judgment, or observed ceremonial dis- plays, his posture seeming to radiate calm and permanence and his authority (Figs. 8, 9). Only the highest ranking members of the court organization were allowed the privilege of sitting when the king sat. When the king met to discuss important matters with the retainers and royals in the retainers' court, as opposed to the audience court for the public, he sat on a beadcovered stool (rii mfo'). The queen mother, the titled maternal uncle, his uterine brothers, and the councillors of the country20 sat on the skulls of buf- falos and hippopotami, the three princely adjuncts sat on uncarved logs, and the rest of the entourage sat on the ground (Tardits 1980: 746 f.). According to the narratives of old princes, beadcovered thrones were not always part of the royal paraphernalia. Nshare Yen, the founder of the Bamum kingdom, sat on a simple wooden stool. The first king to introduce a throne (mandu yene) was supposedly Ngapna, who, as the seventh ruler after the foun- der king, reigned at the end of the 18th century. Asked why this king chose the more elaborate form of seating, 80- year-old Prince Yerima Jean, a son of King Njoya, replied that he probably wanted to enhance himself. There was no information about the actual config- uration of the very early thrones. We have too little information about this formative period of Bamum to do other than speculate about the introduction of larger thrones. Perhaps royal authority had been established more firmly, or perhaps economic conditions by this time had changed. It was possible to date the one-figure throne in the Palace Museum (Fig. 2) to the mid-19th century (i.e., to Nguwuo's reign), whereas the oldest double-figure throne in a museum collection (Fig. 3) be- longs to King Nsangu's reign (1865- 1885). There is evidence, however, that this type of double figure throne was also known around 1850. In 1935, the Mus~e de Trocadero in Paris, now the Musee de l'Homme, exhibited pieces collected by Henri Labouret in Cameroon in 1934.21 A photograph of the exhibit reveals a third double-figure throne with a footrest in very bad condition (Fig. 12; Labouret 1935b: 176). Its beadwork has come off and the carving is decayed. The two human figures at the back display the 10. HEADCREST 76cm. PALACE MUSEUM, FOUMBAN. 11. ANTHROPOMORPHIC HANDLE OF AN IRON BELL.

The photograph also allows one to analyze the detailed execution of the loincloths. In the male figure, the loincloth is seen to be held by a single belt; in the female figure there are two belts, probably a depiction of the narrow, beaded, round belts that Bamum elite women wore. Unfortu- nately, only holes remain where the two figures from the footrest were once fas- tened; we do not know whether or not they resembled the figures on the two other extant footrests. In any event, the Paris throne, known only through photographs, is an even earlier example than Nsangu's throne in Foumban. Little is now known about the actual carving procedure of the thrones and royal stools. The work was always done where the tree was felled, and the carv- ing was brought into the palace after completion. The wood was chosen from among the varieties reserved for the king's use, such as wood from the kapok tree. Once the throne arrived in the palace and probably after it had been covered with beadwork, it was consec- rated and transformed from a woodcarv- ing decorated with beads into a powerful piece of regalia. For the consecration cer- emony, the throne was carried into the "house of the land," a sanctum in the central part of the palace, where the "bags of the land" were kept. There was one bag for each king, containing the most personal goods of the king, his hair and fingernails collected during his lifetime, and his drinking horn, which had served for ritual purposes. After his death, his fingerbones were added to the contents. In addition, the skulls of the deceased rulers were kept in this sanctum, and the regalia had their per- manent place here. In this most sacred location, a permanent fire burned as long as the king lived. It was extin- guished at his death and ritually rekin- dled when a new king was installed. In this shrine room the njifonfon, the highest-ranking advisor of retainer status,22 cut a ram's throat and smeared its blood onto the inside of the throne's stool-like base. It is very likely that medicines were applied as well. The njifonfon then slowly circled the throne, carrying in his hand the "bag of the land" belonging to the current king. This ritual seems to have stressed the continuum in which a king found himself, and his close relationship to the royal ancestors. Since this chamber was the heart of the Bamum kinship, the ritual focus of the palace and of the land, some of this meaning may have been transferred to the throne consecrated in this location. After the completion of the ritual, the throne was carried into its permanent place. Only komshiinshiit, high-ranking retainers in the palace, were allowed to touch the royal seat. They had to un- cover their heads when carrying it. After gently setting it down, each retainer put one hand on the seat of the throne-the area that comes into contact with the king--and then rubbed the hand across his forehead and chest while pronounc- ing an oath of loyalty to the king. They prayed that they might die if they ever said anything negative about him. The privilege of carrying the king's thrones and stools was always executed by dif- ferent komshiinshiit because the power of the throne could ritually endanger per- sons who touched it frequently. The floor plans of the traditional palace, which was erected on the out- lines of Nsangu's old palace after it burned down in 1913, indicate that there were two permanent locations for two (different?) thrones. A ceremonial, beadcovered throne was kept in one of the three little chambers at the main en- trance of the palace, the so-called "mouth of the king." It was carried out into the "court of the nja festival"23 for the weekly display of the Bainum war- riors' skills, which the king observed, as well as for the big annual celebrations (Labouret 1935a: 121). The "court of nja," actually a large open space in front of the palace walls, served as an assembly area for all Bamum. Another location for a royal seat was the courtyard where the daily audiences were held and where the king sat in judgment. It was located al- most in the center of the palace, at the very end of the palace chambers and courtyards accessible to the general pub- lic (Tardits 1980: 600 ff.). The usage of the different types of thrones and stools may be inferred from these contexts. The beaded thrones with the two large figures obviously were used by the king at ceremonial occa- sions. Whether or not the thrones with one figure served the same purpose re- mains unclear, especially if one takes into account the passage about the royal bur- ial in Njoya's Histoire. Their function may have been restricted to that of burial stool. The smaller beaded stools (Figs. 5-7) were used in a more intimate setting when the king was with his courtiers. This type of stool also served a queen mother at ceremonial occasions when she sat at the king's side. It is doubtful, though, that she ever had the right to sit on a stool displaying the motif of the double-headed serpent (Fig. 7). A third variety of royal stool is the domestic type on which the king sat when in his cham- bers. These were strictly utilitarian, carved simply from wood or even made from bamboo (Tardits 1980: 749). 12. THRONE EXHIBITED IN THE MUSEE DE TROCADERO, PARIS, 1934.

No evidence has been found that any of the beaded thrones with figures were used in the installation rituals of the Bamum king, as the data about Kom throne figures might suggest (Northern 1973: 20 ff.). Nevertheless, seating dur- ing the installation ceremony of a Bamum king carried pronounced sym- bolic meaning. The new king sat on several stones or simple wooden stools, which alluded to certain historic events and relationships established with the subjugated populations (Tardits 1980:705 ff.). Whether each king had his own throne carved or whether he inherited his predecessor's thrones and stools, as Njoya's letter to the British suggests, having a new throne carved only to re- place one broken or destroyed, remains unanswered. Certainly it seems that older thrones were preserved, given those still in Foumban and especially the very old piece in Figure 12. The large ceremonial thrones with the two figura- tive elements obviously were not dis- carded but kept in the palace, where many of them may have fallen victim to the frequent conflagrations. Thrones and stools are laden with symbolic allusions, in their overall con- figuration and in the design of the two- dimensional beadwork.24 In particular the more recent thrones display a rich array of motifs, indicating the increase in complexity of the iconography used to- ward the end of the 19th century. All thrones and one stool (Fig. 7) show as the supporting element the double-headed serpent motif, an emblem of Bamum kingship reserved for the king's exclu- sive use. It embodies the concept of royal power in a legendary reference to the charismatic King Mbuembue who ruled during the 1820s and 1830s. Like a ser- pent with two heads, he was able to strike on two military fronts simultane- ously, that is, conquer the enemy. The double-headed serpent is an allusion to the king's strength and guile, and in that does not correspond to a real animal, such as the python or boa (Tardits 1980: 153).25 While the motif of the double-headed serpent is only found in Bamum and Bamileke iconography, the leopard motif occurs widely in the Grassfields, gener- ally in the context of political authority (Figs. 5, 6). The relationship between chief and leopard has been discussed re- peatedly (Thompson 1974: 87; Northern 1975: 21; Gebauer 1979: 93), but thus far efforts of interpretation appear limited by the lack of comparative ethnographic data. In Bamum, the analogy between the remarkable strength, speed, and ferocity of the leopard and the qualities of the king finds expression in the king being addressed as "leopard" (as well as "elephant" and "lion"). The perception of the close relationship between human leader and leopard is evident in the re- conciliation rituals performed after a leopard was killed by a hunter, an act re- sembling the ritual performed when human blood was shed.26 Whether the similarities between the rituals allude to the possibility of a person rather than a leopard having been killed (i.e., a human metamorphosed into the shape of a leopard) remains unclear. There is strong evidence that, like many other groups in the Grassfields, the Bamum believed in the ability of humans to change into animal shape. In particular, the king was believed to be able to trans- form himself into a leopard. Thus, a leopard killed could indeed be perceived as a metamorphosed leader. 41</page><page sequence="11">Other Bamum behavior associated with leopards reflects a system of alliances and dependencies, deepening our interpre- tation of the leopard motif as a political symbol. The act of bringing a leopard to the holder of authority implies submis- sion, while the assignment of its meat suggests a network of political relationships. The Bamum king received the leopard's heart, which he shared with selected sons and retainers, and the pelt was kept in the palace for later use by the king or as a, gift to loyal followers. The royal wives received the leopard's dried bones to use in a medicinal capacity, specifically to rub the royal offsprings' arms to give them a leopard's strength. Claws and fangs were made into neck ornaments for members of the royal lineage and retainers. The king himself kept the beard hairs in the care of the titamfon, the three highest- ranking advisors of retainer status (Tardits 1980: 953). Sitting on top of the leopard image then, as the king and the queen mother do, can be interpreted as an act of ultimate authority on the part of the royal dynasty, and as a visual expression of the king at the apex. In this context, a motif of alternating triangles has been in- terpreted as leopard spots in the recent literature (Northern 1975:117), probably because it occurs on several leopard caryatid figures (Fig. 5) and seems to recreate the leopard pelt marking in a stylized form. It is also found on an array of Bamum beaded and wooden objects, such as sheaths, calabashes, dance shields, and thrones. The Bamum material indicates, however, that the interpretation of this geometric design as leopard spots should be treated with certain reserva- tions. First, there are beadcovered leopard figures from Bamum whose pelt marks are indicated by a checkerboard motif. Many more carved leopards from the Grassfields gener- ally show either rings or circular depressions as the conven- tions marking the pelt. More importantly, old Bamum princes gave a very different interpretation of the triangular motif in 1977.27 The form perceived by the Bamum is not a single trian- 14. STOOL WITH CROCODILE OPENWORK. 54cm. RAUTENSTRAUCH-JOEST-MUSEUM, COLOGNE. gular element but a cluster of eight triangles, making up a gyronny. The eight triangles converge at the center. Four are light, the alternating four dark, and as a group they form a square. This design element was referred to by old Bamum as gbatu gbatu (four heads, four heads; tu= head). Ankermann, who visited Foumban in 1908, gives the earliest description of Bamum motifs, which contains a reference to a bad tu design, here translated as a type of hairdo. Ankermann also gives a sketch of this motif, showing a complicated design that does not correspond to the design now referred to as gbatu gbatu (Baumann &amp; Vajda 1959:285, 312). Ankermann mentions a number of other motifs that could be verified in Bamum, but there is no reference at all to leopard pelt marks. Such dis- crepancies demonstrate the need for much more careful re- search into Grassfields design and its symbolism before the primary interpretation offered by the creators and the sym- bolic meaning of the designs, as analyzed by the observing an- thropologist or art historian, can be addressed. Other iconographic motifs recurring on the thrones and stools equally elude more thorough interpretation. The spider (Fig. 8 at the sides of the footrest) symbolizes an intimate rela- tionship with the ancestors since the earth spider, a divination medium, lives in a hole in the ground. If the data collected in We, a chiefdom at the northern periphery of the Grassfields, can be generalized for other parts of the area, they suggest adherence to the belief that immediately after death, the de- ceased enter a world below the ground that represents a mir- ror image of the world left behind (Geary 1976: 117,179). Hence the spider, as the intermediary, permits communication with the ancestors. A beautiful stool, which was acquired by the Rautenstrauch-Joest-Museum in 1906, shows a frequent, al- though rarely mentioned, zoomorphic motif in Bamum court art: the crocodile. The openwork section of the stool with the naturalistically rendered crocodiles is covered with copper overlay, while the lower rim and the seat are decorated with bead embroidery and cowries (Fig. 14). This is a common com- bination of valuable materials also found on some of the older masks in the Palace Museum. By analogy with these masks, we can attribute this royal stool to Nsangu's or even Nguwuo's reign. The neglect of the crocodile in the description of the im- agery of the Grassfields might be the result of difficulties in distinguishing it from the conventionalized lizard or chame- leon. The crocodile image, as already pointed out by Lecoq (1953: appendix, n.p.), shows a maw with teeth, claws, and scales marked on the back. Unfortunately, very little could be found in Bamum about its symbolism, save that the crocodile was one of the animals reserved for the king's use. The frog motif (Fig. 7, stool rim) is associated with fertility The frog is also the main character in Bamrnum fables, which stress its cunning and intelligence (Rein-Wuhrmann 1925: 131 f., 139). Apparently rlosely related to this motif is a lozenge- shaped design (Fig. 3, rims of the footrest) referred to as "va- gina" by Bamum elders. Northern suggests that it is a styliza- tion of the frog motif and that it appears in combination with the complete frog motif (1973:34). The Bamum interpretation of the lozenge-shaped design thus lends support to the fertility symbolism connected with the frog motif. Another significant design, designated "spear motif" by the Bamum, can be found at the rims of the thrones (Fig. 2, receptacle held by the figure, and borders of the serpents). It may be associated with success in war, one of the pillars of the Bamrnum kingdom. An interpretation of the meaning of the human repre- 42</page><page sequence="12">sentations can conclude this discussion. The symbolism of the thrones with one female figure (Figs. 1, 2) needs to be explored beyond the statements of the old Bamum that these images depict female retainers. To consider the thrones with one fig- ure as burial thrones could lend credence to an interpretation of the figure as a royal ancestor, in this case a queen mother. Parallels with examples from other nearby Grassfields states-specifically the throne figures from Kom--support this suggestion. In Kom, emphasis is on the figural rather than the stool element, as it is in Bamum, and the Kom thrones portray actual kings and queen mothers. Two figures closely resem- bling the Bamum figures in configuration but not in style are preserved in the palace of the Bafut state and also referred to as king and queen mother (Ritzenthaler1962:127, 129). Such an interpretation for the Bamum one-figure thrones seems pre- mature, however, since important questions remain unan- swered; we do not know, for instance, whether there were male counterparts to these female figure thrones. Information available on the meaning of the two-figure thrones (Figs. 3, 4, 12) dispels any interpretation of their fig- ures as royal. When King Njoya described his father's throne in the Histoire, he referred to the two figures in back as Ghane and Paansha (Njoya 1952:61). These are names for male and female twins. For once, the sources and information collected in Foumban agree that the two figures represent male and female retainers or guardians of the king.28 Male twins were the preferred retainers and were always sent by their families to serve the king. They held a high position among the retain- ers, and many of the lineages now belonging to the retainer nobility descended from twins (Tardits 1980:600). Female twins became royal wives who performed ritual tasks as well, such as guarding the permanent fire burning in the "house of the land." The details of costume and the objects held by the fig- ures bear witness to their high rank. The oval headdress of the male, called mpelet (Fig. 11), was restricted to the king, princes, and important retainers; the cylindrical headdress of the female (Fig. 10) to women of high status, such as royal wives, princesses, and the queen mother. The elaborate loincloths were part of the pre-Islamic attire of persons of high status, for slaves wore only a very small protective piece of bark cloth or even leaves and grass (Rein Wuhrmann 1925:39 f.). The drink- ing horn and the receptacle held by the figures may have ritual connotations, but certainly they underline the ideas of display expressed in the overall configuration of these thrones. When the Bamum king sat in state on ceremonial occasions, his re- tainers were assembled around him, holding his important regalia-the royal sword, tobacco pipe, drinking horn, calabashes, and staffs-which they handed to the king at pre- scribed moments during the ceremony. The gesture of the male figure, who touches his chin with his left hand, may be a rendering of the gesture of respect and submission made by a subject when addressing the king. Even today, a Bamum bends forward and speaks through his raised hands when talking to the Sultan (Fig. 8). The best translation of this posture into image is captured in a stool now part of the collections at the Museum ftir V61kerkunde, Berlin. It is, to my knowledge, the only extant Bamum piece that shows a male figure in a caryatid position, supporting the king's seat (Fig. 15). His headdress of the mpelet type merges into the seat. The hands are held under the chin, showing a "beard" indicated by different colored beads, as is true of all beaded male figures. The image is an expression of hierarchical relationships, of the king's supremacy and the support of his retainers. This unique stool came to Berlin as early as 1904, making it one of the first pieces to leave Foumban. Its richly designed beadcover suggests that it belongs to the first half of King Njoya's reign. All human figures on the footrests represent retainers. The warrior figures particularly symbolize the retainers' prominent role in war. Several times in Bamum history, retainers pro- tected the king from being killed or captured in battle. A de- scription in the Histoire about King Mbuembue being saved from the enemy by retainers attests to their importance as war- riors and protectors (Njoya 1952:46f.). When the king sat on the throne, he occasionally placed his feet on the guns of the warrior images (Fig. 8). The iconography of the Bamum thrones and stools reveals them to be a perfect visual expression of the essence of Bamum kingship. Although some forms of royal seating stress particu- lar aspects of kingship by focusing on one or only a few metaphors, like the leopard, the serpent, the crocodile, or the individual retainer, the large ceremonial thrones with the male and the female guardian figure combine many significant im- ages. They show the king surrounded by his entourage, de- picting an important aspect of Bamum kingship: Bamum societal and political structure is organized with the retainers guarding the king, indicated by the large figures at the thrones' back, who surpass the seated sovereign in size. At the same time, the king represents the ultimate source of spiritual power, of rank and prestige for the retainers as well as for all Bamum, as the configuration of the footrest emphasizes. The accumulative aspect of all the elements, from precious materi- als to the abundance of meaningful decorative motifs and fig- ures of humans and animals and the complexity of their ico- nography, gives these large thrones a unique position among the emblems of Bamum kingship, and ranks them among the most outstanding art works ever produced at the Bamum court.

Marcilene Wittmer's discussion of Bamum village art (1976, 1979) as well as her delineation of the Bamum court style versus a "village style" are very helpful. My own field research in Foumban from January to June 1977 provided important data about Bamum court art. It was sponsored by the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs as a cultural aid project for the cataloguing and photographing of the ob- jects of the Bamum Palace Museum. The data collected in Foumban provide the basis for this paper. I thank Dr. Jean Borgatti for many helpful comments concerning the final version of this paper. I also thank Dr. Monni Adams for her suggestions. 2. The title fon does not always translate as "king." Rather, it is a widespread term for leaders of polities that cannot all be classified as kingdoms or highly centralized entities. 3. The correct designation for this motif would be "toad motif." I here follow the common usage in the literature about Grassfields arts. 4. The dating of the reigns of Bamum kings follows Tar- dits's chronology (1980:916). His monograph about the Bamum kingdom is the major source on the political and social structure of Bamum as it was at the turn of the cen- tury. 5. The date of this exhibition has been given incorrectly by DubiW as 1930 (1957:357) but was rectified by Tardits (1980:689). 6. Northern describes these materials as Manilla hemp or jute, and occasionally even raffia weave (1975:118). 7. The orgins of some of these artisan groups are known. Brasscasters came from the subdued chiefdom of the Pan- guot, bead embroiderers and weavers originated in Mamegnam. Potters came from Momarom, a village specialized in pottery to this day. Blacksmiths and carvers seem to have come from different conquered polities (see Geary, in press: chapter "Craftsmen and Artists: Their Techniques and Media"). 8. This Histoire et coutumes des Bamnum is a profound work about Bamum history, social structure, and secret societies that was compiled by Njoya and numerous courtiers in the second half of his reign. it is written in a script Njoya in- vented personally, and it was later translated by a missio- nary into French. 9.M.D.W. Jeffreys has given a translation of this description that unfortunately is incorrect in some crucial passages. For example, he translates "On place le cadavre sur une chaise orn4e d' une statue recouverte de perles" (Njoya 1952:82) as "He was then placed on a chair decorated with the carved figure of a man and ornamented with beads" (Jeffreys 1950:39). 10. Because of restrictions on the use of phonetic symbols, the spelling of the Bamum words in the original text cannot be reproduced and has been simplified. I thank Ms. Kath- leen Holman for the translation of this passage as well as for the translation of the following quote from Rein- Wuhrmann. 11. Translated from the French. Musie du palais du Sultan, inventaire 1941:10. 12. Obviously, Rein-Wuhrmann did not remember that the male statue holds a drinking horn, the female a receptacle. 13. Njoya never sent a throne to England because the British left Foumban after a few months and turned the town over to the French. 14. A checkerboard design as a beaded neck ornament also appears on two old throne figures from Kom (Northern 1973:13). 15. I do not fully agree with Gebauer's statement about the superiority of the throne in Foumban, when taking its pre- sent condition into consideration (Gebauer 1979:89, and footnote 18 of chapter V) Although its carving shows more balance, as opposed to the piece in Berlin, the beadwork in its present style is inferior. Gebauer's "iconographic rich- ness" seems to be a tendency toward overdecoration in both thrones after the Foumban throne was restored. 16. In a 1952 letter concerning this throne, another, though less likely, possibility of acquisition is mentioned. Franz Thorbecke, as a subject of the Grand Duke. could have presented him with the throne. In this case it would have been collected in 1912. I thank Dr. Klaus Volprecht, curator at the Rautenstrauch-Joest-Museum, for this reference. 17. This throne figure comes closer to the proportioning that Willett mentions as a typical feature of African sculp- ture. The head is disproportionately large in relation to the torso (Willett 1971:161). 18. Wittmer comes to a similar conclusion about the devel- opment of the court style in her examination of head crests in the Palace Museum (1976:175). 19. Line dancing of men or women is common throughout the Grassfields. Therefore the association of this configura- tion and dance comes to mind immediately. 20. The "councillors of the country" (kom nguSg) were the de- scendants of the seven retainers who accompanied the first king, Nshare Yen, when he left Rifum to found the Bamum kingdom. 21. Many of the pieces displayed in Paris and in an earlier colonial exhibition in Naples must have gone back to Cameroon. It is doubtful whether all of them are still in existence. On the other hand, there have always been rumors in Foumban that the palace actually contains more important objects than are shown in the Palace Museum. Thus, there may be some interesting discoveries to be made. I thank the Frobenius-Institut in Frankfurt for pro- viding the copy of this photograph. 22.The njifonfon ranks highest among the three titamnfon (tita=father; mfon=king). They are the king's closest re- tainer advisors and help him with the execution of his many ritual duties. 23.The annual nja festival in December, discontinued in 1924, was probably a celebration after tribute had been given to the king.

Rather than give a full account of the interpretation of the motifs that may be found in all newer works about Grassfields arts, I have chosen to present here additional material that might shed further light on Grassfields sym- bolism. 25. It might be assumed that the double-headed serpent openwork stool was introduced under King Mbuembue's reign (1820s-1840s). On the other hand, an existing motif could have been reinterpreted to reflect Mbuembue's par- ticular history. 26.The similarity of rituals was first discovered when analyzing the fiij tsii ritual performed by the We after kil- ling a leopard (Geary 1976:180 ff.). 27. Of course one should be aware of the possibility that the disintegration of Bamum as it existed at the turn of the century may very well have influenced the informants' in- terpretation of the motifs, so that present statements may no longer reflect the traditional meaning intended by the creators. 28. Rein-Wuhrmann also refers to these figures as "court guardians" in the quote given earlier in the text (1931:19 f.). Bibliography Baumann, Hermann and L Vajda. 1959.
