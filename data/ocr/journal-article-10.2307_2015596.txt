<plain_text><page sequence="1">REPORT OF THE THIRTY-FIRST ANNUAL MEETING OF THE EASTERN DIVISION OF THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL ASSOCIATION rpIHERE was something dramatic in the close of the New Haven 1 meeting, for, at the end of sessions sprinkled prodigally with problems of symbolism sprung directly or indirectly from Principia Mathemnatica, an author of that provocative work, in his address as retiring president of the Association, presented and skilfully de- fended a thesis. The thesis is one not foreign to the pages of Process and Reality, but many of Mr. Whitehead's listeners heard in his graceful epigrams echoes of an essay published more than two decades ago and of late not often recalled, an essay written in 1908 by F. H. Bradley and published in Mind of January, 1909. The subject-object relation has traditionally been limited to the knower-known relation, Mr. Whitehead noted at the opening of his address, and he proceeded directly to his thesis with, "I challenge</page><page sequence="2">AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL ASSOCIATION 97 that limitation." In support of his challenge he emphasized the primacy of feeling and the verifiability of non-sensuous perception. To limit perception to excitation of sense organs is, he pointed out, a conventional but dangerous employment of the term. There is a wider meaning, but one which has been for the most part overlooked in the emphasis placed by its proponents on the sensationist defini- tion. Things may be termed objects for an occasion of experience, but the occasion does not arise out of the mere passivity of the sub- ject. There must be activity, and this activity is the creative element of the occasion. "Concernedness" is of the essence of perception. Even fHume clothed each perception in liveliness. A mere patch is silent as to the past and future: sensa provide (if they are considered starkly present and immediate) no material to experience. Sensa- tionalism has provided a literature easy to read, facile with explana- tions, beguilingly convincing, and wholly fallacious. For no clear- cut perception can ever be limited to the here and now. Our im- mediate past is not mediately connected with the immediate present, but is continuous with the present' and "the immediate past sur- viving to be lived through in the present is the prime instance of non- sensuous perception." Thus the absolute individuality of each oc- casion of experience must be qualified by the continuity of experience in which feeling enjoyed in the past is present as felt datum. Per- sonal identity, which receives all occasions of a man's life "is an in- escapable fact in every doctrine in the history of western thought." Events are together by reason of their unity of locus. This gives at once a basis for the doctrine of the unity of nature and experience centering about the notion of "the imminence of the past energizing in the present." The above analysis must be, of course, the crudest brief of Mr. Whitehead's lucent address, but if it succeeds in indicating that the "philosophy of science" (which in too many hands is neither philo- sophic nor scientific), no matter how intricate and absorbing that may become, is not by itself adequate to the exigencies of rational thought, then the warning with which the address was instinct will have been conveyed. The opening session was devoted to Hegelianism in observance of the centennial of Ilegel's death. The three papers read were far from perfunctory tributes, but for some reason the audience failed to take fire. This may have been due to the fact that the conference was just getting started, but the discussion, or rather the poverty of it, seemed to reveal that Hegel weighed none too heavily on the minds of those present. Mr. Hook's paper on the "Contemporary 1 "Past" and "present" are here used in a sense similar to the one made significant by C. S. Peirce in 1892.</page><page sequence="3">98 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Significance of Hegelian Philosophy" drew a broad distinction be- tween Hegel's idealism, absolutism, and concept of organic totality, on the one hand, and his objectivism, his theory of process and dia- lectic, and his conception of objective mind on the other. Mr. Hook contended that the latter features of Hegel's thought could be dis- engaged from the former and after such liberation remain mean- ingful and productive today. Mr. Cohen, while likewise ready to recognize positive contributions of ilegel, inclined more to negative criticisms. He warned against the danger of hypostatizing cate- gories: "They are not things which combine, but relations"; and he suggested pertinently that any method which proves as many debat- able points as does that of Hegel is rightly held suspect. It is im- possible to deduce existence from abstractions, for there will always be an element of contingency, hyle', chance; and in the face of this abstractions collapse. Mr. Sabine's paper dealt with the origin of Hegel's political philosophy in relation to German conditions in the early nineteenth century and showed that Hegel, instead of justify- ing the statuqs quo at that time, offered a solution for "constitution- less" Germany distinctively adapted to German exigencies. In the discussion that followed it was both affirmed and denied that con- temporary Germany was again turning to Hegelian thought for relief in political crisis, and the further question whether indeed Hegel- ianism is a philosophy of purely provincial significance or not was also discussed on both sides, without however a notable clarification of the matter being reached. Discussion came to life in the Monday afternoon session at which three papers on logic were read, and continued to be keenest in those subsequent meetings where logical problems were treated. Hence these discussions are reported rather more fully than the others. The papers read at the logic session on Monday afternoon were: "The Viciousness of the Subject-Predicate Relation" by Miss Brown; "Reflexive Relations" by Mr. Parker; and " The Philosophical Theory of Classes" by MIr. Weiss. Miss Brown's contention was that the subject-predicate relation properly interpreted is not vicious. Every proposition involves an aspect of constancy and an aspect of variability with a principle of determination. The two outstanding systems of subject-predicate logic, Aristotle's and Leibniz's, can both be interpreted from this revised point of view. At the close of her paper it was objected, as lMJiss Brown had hinted earlier it would be objected, that a relation between subject and predicate again in- volves one in the germ stream of idealism. She answered by reiterat- ing her thesis and pointing out that this need not be the case if one distinguish the two orders and determinables she had indicated. Mr. Parker's approach to the question of reflexive relations was</page><page sequence="4">AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL ASSOCIATION 99 through the definitions of relation given by Johnson and in Principia Mathematica, as a class of ordered couples, or couples having a sense. In support of his main tbesis he used Wittgenstein, Prop. 5.5321, though the ensuing discussion indicated that he might better have stressed one of its premises, i.e., 5.5301,2 in order to avoid an almost inevitable misunderstanding. Identity, Mr. Parker urged, is an ir- reducible triadic relation holding (1) between two expressions and a meaning, (2) between an object and two descriptions, (3) between two appearances and the thing of which they are appearances; and in every expression of identity the expression can be so altered as to eliminate "identity." When we have x with itself, we really have no couple at all, and so no relation, for f (x, y) is nothing more than the formula for simple predication if y is taken as identical with x. All relations commonly called reflexive, such as "knows," "loves," "contradicts," etc., are triadic. Personal identity is a one- many relation between self and many events at many times. Mr. Whitehead objected that the limitation imposed on f (x, y) would rule out much powerful reasoning for the mathematician, and pre- sented an illustration of reflexive relation in the case of a president ruling as president over the class of share-holders of which he is a member. MIr. Parker responded that he had merely amplified the definition of relation in Principia Mathematica, and objected that the illustration was not strictly apposite. Mr. Weiss pointed out that we must apparently reject all symmetrical transitive relations of the form aRb, bRa, aRa, to which Mr. Parker responded that he would not allow the inference, aRa. Mr. Bayliss objected that in "Blue is blau" (an illustration used in the paper) the relation is not triadic in that it holds between the meaning of the terms and not between the terms themselves. This objection is answered, however, in the proposition in Wittgenstein above. Mr. Cohen asked pertinently if to analyse anything is to "eliminate" it, suggesting that this is a "very unphilosophical prejudice," his question, how- ever, being misunderstood by the speaker, who reiterated that the elimination of "identical" and "different" is a step toward an ade- quate language unburdened with redundancies. Mr. Weiss in his paper pointed out that the definition of class developed by Whitehead and Russell is inadequate in several ways, most notable of which are that the notion of class is used in the defi- nition of class and that it is bound up with a theory of description which involves the distinguishing of five different kinds of identical propositions where there should be only one. He suggested that a more fruitful procedure would be to analyze the proposition into two functions, ox' and q!x, discarding the unwarrantable metaphys- 2 "That identity is not a relation between objects, " etc.</page><page sequence="5">100 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY ical assumption that "this book" refers to an existential object and that "red" is an abstraction for the recognition that both are ab- stractions, importing a new primitive, "abstraction," and thus clear- ing up the perplexities of proposition-and-propositional function which swarm through Principia Mathematica. In the proposition, "Columbus is the discoverer of America," "Columbus" is not an individual separated from properties, nor a class (save so far as in- dicated by some characteristics), nor a member of a class. "Co- lumbus" is a unit, the locus of abstractions. The position involved here, he noted, is nearer "objective idealism" than to the atomism of contemporary logic. Mr. Ushenko objected that Russell, too, would say "this book" is really a propositional function, but it was answered that Russell once certainly held the view imputed to him. Mr. Whitehead pointed out that the doctrine of functions has still to be explored widely, but questioned some of the critical points of the paper. Mr. Weiss parried with the remark that the real prob- lems of logic are contained in the introductions to Principia and not in "the dexterity of its authors." In Principles of Mathematics Russell spoke of abstractions, but later he came to consider ox as demarLding the discovery of a value for x which involves existence. The speaker added that "atomism crops out in a very bad form in Wittgenstein" in the notion of propositions as "having hooks to link up particulars." Mr. Cohen pointed out that if the speaker's contentions were sound then empiricism is unsound, in which Mr. Weiss concurred "if by empiricism be understood atomism." He concluded by asserting that while idealists have known too little logic, modern logicians often fail to recognize the importance of the con- crete. Just before the session adjourned there occurred a rapid-fire colloquy between the speaker and Miss Stebbing of London Uniaver- sity over the status of "existential entities" in which the atomism he had been attacking came defiantly to bay. In the MVonday afternoon session on Value, Mr. Kruse in his paper on "The Hedonistic Interpretation of Pessimism" made clear the inadequacy of any reply to pessimism which interprets that position in terms of pleasure-pain. Any refutation of pessimism, he con- cluded, must take into account the summumn bonum sponsored by the particular pessimism dealt with, and not be concerned with merely advocating a "balance of pleasure." Mr. Roback's paper on "Significance" was an attempt, it might be said, to make "signifi- cance " significant, to detect what there is in the sempiternal problems of critical thought which makes each age's emphases meaningful to that age despite the fact that to a later culture those emphases may appear wide of any philosophic mark. The objective significance of si.e., that of Peirce.</page><page sequence="6">AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL ASSOCIATION 101 problems derives from the objectivity of the situation, Mr. Roback pointed out, though this gives but a qualified objectivity. His con- clusion was that there is a gradual unfolding in cultural progress of some fundamental significance which "clear-minded intellectu- als, not necessarily technical philosophers, can intuitively per- ceive." Mr. Dubs' treatment of "A Desire Theory of Value" was based on a theory of desire which finds it to be "a certain type of common neural organization" possessed of " (1) a goal, (2) conative energy, and (3) the capacity to produce a pleasant or unpleasant feeling." An interpretation of goods, economic, esthetic, moral, to- gether with an evaluation of "contentment" and "true happiness" was then erected on this basis. Mr. Urban's paper, which closed the session, was concerned with the necessity for a redefinition of mind and the function which a properly oriented theory of value might serve in that redefinition. The speaker stressed the doctrine of as- cending levels of mind, beginning with subjective mind and cul- minating in social or objective mind. Objective mind may be uni- fied, he pointed out, by introducing a theory of value which will import individuality, much, it was suggested, as Bosanquet has done. Psychologically, it was asserted, we must start from wholes-having- meaning, e.g., only in the light of social, objective mind does sub- jective mind, person, become significant. In the evening Mr. Murphy, discussing objective relativism, restated his position with great clarity and took occasion to score some of its critics. Against Lovejoy's championing of "scientific objects" he pointed out that such "objects" are abstractions which can be true of reality only in a limited aspect, and to absolutists of all kinds he said neatly that "the absolutist must talk about something . . . and is compelled to bootleg relativism." No one can talk adequately of reality, for the object known must always be a partial aspect. The speaker argued that knowledge of data does not require all the machinery of dualism, for all "appearances'' are but objects of one kind or another. He ended with a quotation from his first presentation of objective relativism, reaffirming his faith in the position outlined there. Mr. Hook asked eagerly for a section of the paper dealing with pragmatic critics which had been omitted in the twenty-minute reading, but was denied the pleasure of a counter refutation. Mr. Cohen emphasized the objectivity of secondary qualities which the paper had affirmed, and pointed out how the modern interpretation of probability is consonant with such a view inasmuch as probability is no longer regarded from the stand- point of subjective ignorance. Mr. Morgan asked whether an event had a core, and if so whether this is knowable, to which Mr. Murphy responded with commendable brevity, "No." Mr. Montague raised</page><page sequence="7">102 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY the question of the location of secondary qualities, suggesting that if these were located in the head then much fruitless quibbling over "subjective" and "objective" would be done away with, and that furthermore epistemology could then proceed experimentally as do the physical sciences. Mr. Macintosh made a point with regard to organism-environment considerations, to which it was answered that objective relativism is concerned with "aspects," not with organism- environment, save as an "'aspect. " ' 4 Mr. Ushenko followed with a paper on "Fact aind Event," pre- senting events as "organic units of change" which can not be in- stantaneous, and referred to an article by G. E. Moore in the Pro- ceedings of the Aristotelian Society 5 for its presuppositions. Events are indicated by names while facts are expressed in propositions, though facts differ from propositions in that they, unlike proposi- tions, have no element of generality. Events blend in single blocs to be perceivable. To record an event named A two facts must be noted, (1) A is in space-time; (2) A is a so-and-so. Substituting (2) in (1) there is a permanent record that a certain specification of space-time applied to a so-and-so. Miss Stebbing 's analysis of "Substances, Events, and Facts" was one of the most provocative of the whole meeting. " Substance," she pointed out, was used in the paper so as to be replaceable everywhere by "thing." "Substances are artifacts about events." Russell and Broad fail to make clear how a string of events and a complex of events respectively differ from a collection of events; this oversight is regrettable in both cases. Quoting from Wittgenstein she pre- sented as her thesis that "the world divides into facts," and that philosophy must be concerned with an analysis of facts. Her argu- ment rested on two assumptions: (1) Some propositions can be known to be true. (2) Analysis has a direction, so one can talk about reaching basic facts at the terminus ad quem of analysis. Things, facts, and events differ typicaZly from each other (a most important point to grasp in understanding all her work). A com- plete description of the world, if possible, would be of facts. Miss Stebbing expressed some doubt that facts can be defined, but assured her audience that they can be indicated uniquely. In looking at the table, "I am now seeing an absolutely specific shade of brown" indicates an inexpressible. General facts and absolutely specific facts have in common that they are facts, i.e., configurations of 4It might be noted parenthetically that this one beguiling phrase causes more trouble in philosophic discussion than any other. Critics who would not think of adopting, as metaphysical catch-words, concepts of astro-physics or electro-dynamics seem to find in the specialised concepts of biology unquestion- able data for philosophy to build upon. 5 N. S., vol. XX, pp. 40-62.</page><page sequence="8">AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL ASSOCIATION 103 elements (which may be facts). That which enters into a configura- tion (elements) involves causal relation or entailment. Absolutely specific facts are the end of philosophic analysis and elements of basic facts are ultimate constituents of the world. "The number of basic facts is exactly what is accidental in the world." An event can not be characterised as "brown," but a thing can; an event can not be the object of activity, but a thing can. A group or string of events (it would be nonsense to say "sense-data") can not be brown nor occupy a time nor provide one with a support, and Broad and Russell never get around this difficulty. There followed a criticism of Russell's view of "aspects" and "logical constructs" in which Miss Stebbing pointed out that the latter can not be "neutral" nor be referred to by "it." Russell, though he himself introduced the phrase, does not understand what "logical constructs" are, for as he uses the words they refer neither to what is logical nor constructed. "This table" refers to a set of facts, but no one of them has a unique aspect which can be referred to as "the table"; "this table" rather refers to them all at once. At the conclusion of the paper Mr. Weiss returned to the fracas interrupted that afternoon, objecting that facts, and not things, are derivative. In answer Miss Stebbing re- ferred to her two assumptions. Mr. Weiss: "But why should we believe there are basic facts?" Miss Stebbing: "We just now agreed to." Mr. TWeiss: "But facts are about things.'" Miss Stebbing: "Oh, then you believe the world divides into things?" In the history session Tuesday morning Mr. McClure presented a paper dealing with "Circularity in Greek Philosophy," in which he adduced the systems of Anaximander, Empedokles, the Pythag- oreans, Plato, and Aristotle as evidence of the predominant import- ance the notions of the circle and cyclical being had for the Greek mind which had not grasped the principles of transfinite mathe- matics and the doctrine of the continuum. The circle represents perfect movement to Aristotle, and final cause was invoked to de- scribe a kind of compensation which terrestrial bodies, deprived of perfect motion, possess. The concept of perfection, symbolized by the circle, is indicated in Greek art and political theory, Mr. McClure pointed out. Mr. Swabey objected that the concept of circularity is but a special case of the "imaginableness" of the world to the Greek, and it was objected that rectilinear motion is also an impor- tant concept in Greek metaphysic, to which Mr. McClure answered that he had no intention of making circularity the key to all Greek philosophy. MIr. Edel asked how one could hold that Aristotle's celestial physics was a "direct deduction from the idea of circu- larity, " and suggested that the idea of the circle was derivative from that of "the whole." Mr. McClure responded that he did not wish</page><page sequence="9">104 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY to minimize the observational aspect of Aristotle's physics, but merely intended to show how there was present, as in all empirical science, a great deal of a priori matter, and that the idea of the circle was symbolic of perfection, "the whole," etc. Mr. Calhoun in his paper, "A Neglected Main Source of Plato's Thought," attempted to es- tablish a genetic relation between the Dialogues and Anaxagoras's writings. He emphasized particularly the importance both to Plato and to Anaxagoras of the principle of "great-and-small," and also the doctrine of "participation" stressed by both thinkers. It was objected that the opposition of great and small was rather a common Greek instrument than unique to the two philosophers, and Mr. Porteous suggested that "participation" could hardly be used uni- vocally with respect both to Plato's doctrine and that of Anaxagoras, the former having to do with universals and the latter with material constitution. Mr. Birch's paper on "The Psycholog,y and Metaphysic of Ockham," stressed the contrast between the doctrine of science espoused by Aristotle and the nominalism of the fourteenth-century thinker, pointing out that "he interpreted universals in terms of particulars; Aristotle particulars in terms of universals." Mr. Alles's paper on the possible comparison between Clarke's doctrine of evolution as specialization within phyla, and Leibniz's metaphysic of the monad, was an interesting attempt to develop a synthesis of these two positions. In opening the Tuesday morning session on Logic Mr. White's paper on "Meaning" elaborated three essential points: (i) the "by- stander" theory of meaning is inadequate; (ii) meaning is primarily mediate; (iii) meaning in at least one sense is distinguishable from value. Mr. Blumberg's paper on "Demonstration and Inference in Philosophy" provoked one of the most spirited and productive pas- sages of the whole meeting. He began by confining logic to "formal pseudo-propositions" which are tautological and do not limit the possible states of affairs, and which are described as true regardless of the possible state which is in fact the case. A proposition is true or false according as it states what is the case and can be verified. Empirical verification differs from inference in that inference must be tautological, though the term, inference, is often used in another sense in empirical science; this latter solecism tends to confuse gen- eral implicative propositions with definitions and rules of syntax. The assertions of mathematics are a priori precisely because they are analytical, while the assertions of the sciences (including ethic) are synthetic a posternori. In philosophy verification is impossible, for philosophy is the attempt to come to clarity with respect to such terms as "meaning," "truth," et al. Philosophy does not consist of propositions, but of "elucidations" which are not true or false but</page><page sequence="10">AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL ASSOCIATION 105 "efficacious" or "inefficacious." "To the extent to which our lan- guage becomes logically sound anld our empirical sciences factually complete, philosophy in the technical sense becomes superfluous." (It is unfortunate that the session was deprived of Mr. Boas' paper on "Meaning," which, I understand, would have furnished an ap- proach to the problems that Mr. Blumberg discussed.) At the close of the paper Mr. Drake asked if all propositions about the soul are meaningless because they are unverifiable, and, if it is illegitimate to hold them true, may they not be believed to be true. Mr. Gins- burg observed that the apparent disagreement with Kant was really a shifting of Kant's whole problem so as to make the "applicability" of mathematics to the world impossible. Mr. Weiss pointed out that even in extensional logic there must be some intensional entailment, and asked whether the speaker would distinguish between proposi- tions which are known to be verifiable and those which are not yet known to be verifiable. If the latter are meaningful, then meaning- lessness does not consist in the fact that an assertion is nonsensical, but that it is a function. Mr. Irving asked whether verification is used univocally with respect to the physical sciences and the social sciences, and, if this is the case, what meaninglessness then means. Mr. Warbeke objected that the limitation of meaning to physically verifiable propositions seems to leave out everything we are most in- terested in, and took issue with Mr. Blumberg 's witticism that "meta- physics is bad grammar." In answer to his objectors Mr. Blumberg pointed out that meaninglessness may be used in two senses: (a) when in the proposition there occurs a term not yet defined but not indefinable; (b) in the proposition there occurs a violation of logical syntax. He asserted a typical difference between the physical sci- ences and the social sciences as Mr. Irving had suggested them, and hinted that there must be laid down rules which permit of transla- tion. To Mr. Weiss he replied that tautological intension was the only type considered in the paper, denying intension in the case of relation between two propositions which do not involve each other tautologically. Mrs. Swabey's paper on "Logical Force in Demonstration" de- plored the trend toward lexicography on the part of symbolic lo- gicians and toward mechanism on the part of experimentalists. In each case, she suggested, there seems to be a denial of logical neces- sity, and asked, "How can a system be a logical system if devoid of apodeictic force ?" Her conclusion was that logical principles possess a certain inevitableness, since not only is their validity pre- supposed in all the structures of knowledge, but they serve as tests of the formal truth of all other systems without being themselves subject to any extraneous principles. To her paper it was objected</page><page sequence="11">106 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY by Mr. Hook that onily confusion could result from lumping together all types of empiricism, and that she had not met the question rel- evant to all such analysis, "What is the test of consistency?" Her answer was that empiricism does in general say that the real is the concrete particular and that this has materialistic and mechanistic implications. To his question of the place of procedure she replied that procedure must be included in the analysis of logic, but the procedure is always logically objective. In the afternoon one session was devoted to probability in sci- entific method. Mr. Nagel contrasted the frequency theory of prob- ability with "subjective" and "materialistic" theories. The real problem is to develop a theory of probability which will enable one to distinguish between "One theory is more probable than another" and "The probability of a coin falling head is equal to the prob- ability of its falling tail." Quoting "there is no probability in advance of the real conditions," he proceeded to discuss a view of probability founded on evidence and not on subjective limitation. The ground for the assertion of one inference rather than another is supplied by a leading principle established on evidence. Prob- ability of the first order is given, e.g., by a series of sets of ten throws of the coin, probability of the second order by a series of series of sets, and so on. This makes meaningful the probable statement of probability. A true theory of probability must be founded on "traits of existence, not subjective limitation. . . . Contingency is as little an anthropomorphic character as is strict determinism. " Mr. Demos asked whether the failure of a premised probability to work out at any point could affect the probability of succeeding throws. Mr. Weiss inquired whether the definition of randomness used by the speaker was nominal or experimental, and reinforced Mr. Demos' query by asking how it is determined whether a series is convergent or not convergent; he also asked whether the theory itself was prob- able. Mr. Dotterer raised the question of partial ignorance as basis for probability, and Mr. Ushenko asked about the place of intuition. Mr. Eaton defended Keynes' position, pointing out that for Keynes no probable judgment can be altered by further experience. The probable is relative to evidence and no matter how much additional evidence may be gathered this will not affect the original probability. He objected to the speaker's assertion that error was impossible on Keynes' view. To this Mr. Cohen took issue, suggesting that Mr. Nagel had much in common with Keynes and pointing out how great an advance the basing of probability on evidence represents. In the course of his remarks he succeeded in answering most of the other objections, suggesting that the relative frequency theory is a theory of probable inference, dealing with types of inference. Mr. Nagel</page><page sequence="12">AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL ASSOCIATION 107 answered Mr. Weiss's questions by asserting that the theory is but probable itself, that the determination of a limit depends in each case on the nature of the physical system involved, and that random- ness and limit are concepts entertained hypothetically for any given physical knowledge. To Mr. Demos he replied by correcting a mis- apprehension: the question is never one of a set of throws, but of a series of sets. Mr. Ginsburg succeeded engagingly in his paper on "Probability, Determinism, and Science" in inavoking the shades of an earlier tra- dition for his method. Probability must rest on a mixture of both a priori and experimental grounds, and, in flat contradiction to the preceding speaker, he asserted that "the method of probability is not itself probable any more than life insurance is a risky business." Furthermore probability must posit order and not chaos, although no scientific system can be adequated with reality nor can reality be identified with causal determinism. The whole analysis was some- what confused by the introduction of a phrase which even that arch- idealist, Bradley, discarded toward the end of his work-"ultimate reality." Mr. Hook objected that certain metaphysical conditions were surreptitiously imported into the speaker's argument which did not follow from his premises, and noted that apparently the question under treatment was merely the Kantian problem of knowl- edge. What, he asked, is the order of probability an order of e Mr. Roelofs asked whether if knowledge of the conditions of tossing the penny be successively increased it does not eventually pass into cer- tainty, and whether this would also hold of quantum physics or whether " microscopic," 6 i.e., subatomic phenomena are actually different and unpredictable in themselves. This same question was asked in a little different form by another member of the audience. Mr. Ginsburg's reply to Mr. Hook resolved itself into a skirmish over the word "reality," and when he responded to Mr. Roelofs that "you ignore rather than are ignorant of" certain conditions, it was suggested by Mr. Northrop, the chairman, that the argument was degenerating into teasing and that time was up. The argument of Mr. Margenau on "Probability and Causality in Quantum Physics" was too technical for most of us to follow, but the speaker gave as his objectives: "to state the basic postulates of quantum physics in probability terms" and to show that "the uncertainty principle appears from this point of view a very natural feature, not contra- dictory to ultimate lawfulness. " In the alternate session the same afternoon Mr. Brotherston dis- cussed the significance of certain traits of primitive culture for an objective theory of mind. He argued that primitive ritual with its 6 This curious locution cropped up many times during the discussions.</page><page sequence="13">108 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY superindividual elements shows that as soon as conation arrived at the stage of reflection, man's mind, while not forsaking special problem-solving, connected this with the wider problem of an in- clusive conservation of values. Mr. Lafferty 's paper on "Some Metaphysical Implications of the Pragmatic Theory of Knowledge" owed much, he said, to the late Professor Mead's concept of "per- spective" as an essential factor in knowledge. This concept, he sug- gested, had metaphysical implications which many realist thinkers ignore in their insistence on an objective reality independent of any such qualification. Tests reveal things only as our manipulatory powers constitute them. Mr. Morgan's analysis of "Wilhelm Dilthey and the Geisteswissenschaf ten" was part of a study to be published in the Philosophtical Review. The selected portion dealt with Dil- they's attempt to characterize a distinctive method for the Geist- eswissenschaften, a method in which the "having" of experience (Erleben) and the ability to enter into others' experience (Ver- stehen) form the basis for conceptual generalization (Begriffsbil- dlung). This method may be considered an alternative for the sci- ence of man and his culture in contrast to behaviorism on the one hand and introspective psychology on the other. The paper offered by Mr. Kerby-Miller on "The Theory of Truth," while objecting to the view that "truth is merely a means to satisfaction," recognized both discernment and interests as objective factors in the constitution of truth. Both the common structure of the world and our interest in organization underlie the judgments which we regard as true. Unfortunately time was lacking for the discussion of these last papers. It would have been interesting to know how close Mr. Lafferty and Mr. Kerby-Miller felt their positions to be to the ob- jective relativism outlined by Mr. Murphy, for there did seem to be some convergence of epistemological thought on a position of this kind in contrast to the more traditional unqualified realisms, ideal- isms, and pragmatisms. This, together with the keen and wide- spread interest displayed in logical analysis, were the outstanding features of the meetings. The commodious appointments provided by the Yale committee for the meetings made it pleasurable and appropriate to pursue abstractions intensively without care for the world of carping affairs. The Executive Committee not only took excellent charge of this year's meeting, but had the foresight to advise members that papers submitted on future occasions be limited to approximately two thou- sand words so as to allow for more varied discussion. At the business meeting of the Association, testimonial letters in</page><page sequence="14">BOOK REVIEWS 109 memory of George H. Mead and William M. Salter were read and placed upon the record.
