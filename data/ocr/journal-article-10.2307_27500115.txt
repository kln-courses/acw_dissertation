<plain_text><page sequence="1">him/ Out of his limits, desire that fools him out of his limits, unnatural crime, inhuman science,/...These break, these pierce, these deify, praising their God shrilly with fierce voices: not in a man's shape/ He approves the praise ..." It is clear from this and numerous other passages in Jeffers's oeuvre that his intent is religious, an argument made powerfully by William Everson in his recent book on Jeffers, The Excesses of God (Stanford University Press, 1988). Jeffers is by turns the psalmist-'Continent's End," "Divinely Super fluous Beauty," "The Excesses of God," (some of the best poems in his first major book Tamar)-and the prophet/wisdom poet-"Shine, Perishing Repub lic," "Boats in a Fog," "The Purse-Seine," "Wise Men in Their Bad Hours," and "Hope Is Not for the Wise." These are compelling and well-done even if we feel bothered by some of the high proclamations. One finds that beauty is a constant goal in all his writing, less through the aesthetics of his own poems than through the divine beauty he wants us to perceive. Jeffers maintains an unstated faith in the ability of language to signify something beyond itself. His appropriation of the Whitman free verse line is an often effective gesture which conveys the sense of divine superfluity, desire, and freedom. But "permanent things are what is needful in a poem," he writes in "Point Joe," and one finds rock, hawk, and stars recurring as emblems of divine power in some of his best lyrics, especially "The Purse-Seine," "Rock and Hawk," and "Hurt Hawks." In the latter the narrator seems merciful by killing a wounded hawk, but insists upon the creature's "implacable arrogance" and its ultimate transcendent spirit: I gave him the lead gift in the twilight. What fell was relaxed, Owl-downy, soft feminine feathers; but what Soared: the fierce rush: the night-herons by the flooded river cried fear at its rising Before it was quite unsheathed from reality. Jeffers's pantheistic inhumanism is nothing new in American litera ture-it has progenitors in Emerson, Melville, and Thoreau-but the apparent misanthropy in these lines, for example, from "Hurt Hawks"-"l'd sooner, except the penalties, kill a man than a hawk," seem excessively misanthropic. Jeffers's excess in this mood appears in many of his longer narrative poems, "Tamar" and the ambitious and complicated "The Women At Point Sur." In the former, Jeffers portrays the horrifying incest in the demon-haunted Cauldwell family. In the latter he portrays the failure of would-be prophet, Barclay, who fails by trying to control humanity rather than praise all-encompassing nature. In trying to attain the austerity of Greek tragedy, these poems often seem stilted and their characters stiff, but they are fascinating meditations of a horrific sinfulness Jeffers sees residing in human beings and societies. In Jeffers, revelations of utter human degradation and sin are necessary to the process of purification. The opportunity to read widely in Jeffers's poetry reveals that he was well aware of this theodicy and provides something like an explanation in afine poem, very much his arspo?tica, "Apology for Bad Dreams." Jeffers sees himself as a diminished avatar of a cruel and immanent Creator: He brays humanity in a mortar to bring the savor From the bruised root: a man having bad dreams, who invents victims, is only the ape of that God. He washes it out with tears and many waters, calcines it with fire in the red crucible, Deforms it, makes it horrible to itself: the spirit flies out and stands naked, he sees the spirit He takes it in the naked ecstasy; it breaks in his hand, the atom is broken, the power that massed it Cries to the power that moves the stars, 'I have come home to myself, behold me.' Since Jeffers's misanthropy has often appeared to be a pettily renewed form of Calvinistic moralizing, or a political outcry against two horrific world wars, or a trivial appropriation of Nietzscheisms and Darwinisms (and there are unfor tunate moments which confirm these criticisms) the publication of his complete poetry (the final two volumes of the Stanford edition are forthcoming) will enable readers to see the integrity and depth of a visionary whose ultimate desire was spiritual peace and transcendence. Robert Faggen 8 - The Collected Poetry of Robinson Jeffers Volumes I and II Robinson Jeffers, edited by Tim Hunt. Stanford University Press, $60.00 each ISBN 0-8047-1414-2, 0-8047-1723-0 The near monolithic certainty one hears in reading through these first two massive volumes of Jeffers's complete works is both unnerving and compelling. While the search for a unifying myth, the escape from the tyranny of science, the disintegration of belief in a coherent reality, and the failures of society and religion left many modernists bitter or diffident, Jeffers sounds an assurance which was unique among the poets of his time. And that assurance is not optimism but an acceptance and incorporation of all the horror that others sought to escape. A poet whose work dares to be philosophical and prophetic, often at the risk of artistic success, Jeffers asserted the truth of a reality and totality he believed in, an inhuman pantheism which became the cornerstone of his imaginative edifice. Jeffers has been labelled a "California poet" because of his devotion to the rugged landscape of Carmel and the Pacific coast, a half truth which can be as misleading as calling Frost a regional poet of New England. Jeffers imagines a barren, forbidding landscape on which to drama tize his own myths of human nature. And Jeffers's apparently scientific conception of reality has little to do with the naturalist's careful and perhaps limiting observations of the natural world but more with the appropriation of a pantheistic cosmology. The nature of things for this would-be modern Lucre tius is all that is antithetical to the more comforting human emotions of joy, hope, sorrow, and pity. Thus, reality in Jeffers is a veil for the emergence of a transcendent God whose attributes are minimally anthropomorphic. As he interjects in one of his better narrative-tragedies, "Roan Stallion," the proc esses of science and of tragedy are united in their pursuit of the divine: "Tragedy that breaks man's face and a white fire flies out of it; vision that fools</page></plain_text>
