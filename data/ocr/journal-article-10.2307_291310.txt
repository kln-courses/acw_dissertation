The supreme interest of Syria to all students of antiquity is becoming clearer every year; so also is the continuity of fusion in religion and art within its borders. No praise could be too high for the work of the Jesuit Fathers of the Catholic Univer- sity of Beyrouth during the last thirty years in recording and interpreting monuments as they came to light. Ronzevalle, Mouterde, Jalabert have constituted a most beneficent triad. The only feeling other than joy which this volume brings to a re- viewer arises from the fact that it is the last from Ronzevalle's pen, and that we cannot look forward to the researches promised on pp. 139 f., "si mes forces tres defaillantes ne viennent 'a me trahir." What we have here is a magnificent collection of materials re- lating to the cult of Baalbek and to derivative and parallel phenomena in the region. A description of the new evidence and new interpretations presented would have to be lengthy.' In particular, a flood of light is thrown upon the young god, "Dieu-Fils" of the Heliopolitan triad, who is shown to have been intimately associated with agricultural and pastoral pur- suits. In Greek he could be either Hermes or Dionysos or Adonis. The data for this view are abundant, and I think it is convincing. We may well suppose that there were once many such local figures, all fairly similar, who became even more similar under the strength of the influence which radiated from Baalbek, just as local gods were assimilated to Hadad (p. 118) and various local deities believed to dwell in sacred stone were united as Zeus Baitylos r6-v 7rpos -(i9 1Op'vr-.2 There is a Hittite analogy, "alle Wetterg6tter, alle Hepits, alle Istars." Ronzevalle's emphasis on the presence and enduring importance of the agrarian side by side with the celestial in the piety of Baalbek is fundamental; there was not an antithesis but a direct link between the two. The octagonal altar of Fiki is then studied. While the reader should turn to Cumont's review, J. R. S., XXVIII (1938), pp. 87 f. for his novel and brilliant interpretation, the detailed comments of Ronzevalle remain most important. Finally, there 1For a good summary cf. F. R. Walton, A. J.

Ronze- valle did not live to write the comments which he had in mind, but his repertory is invaluable, and many remarks earlier in the book indicate the nature of the interpretation which he intended. While mourning for what is denied to us, we cannot be too thaiuk- ful for what has been given. CARL KoCH. Der rbmische Juppiter. (Frankfurter Studien zur Religion und Kultur der Antike, XIV.) Frankfurt a. M., Klostermann, 1937. Pp. 136. M. 7. Koch is oiie of Altheim's fellow-workers and we already owe to him a useful monograph: Gestirnverehrung im alten Italien. This work is also welcome. The first chapter handles the ques- tion " Die r6mische Religion, vormythisch oder entmythisiert ? " Was Roman belief unique among the religions of the world in being completely without imaginatioln? Koch adduces E. Tabel- ling's analysis of Ovid's account of dea Tacita, and shows the coherence of myth and cult in this instance. He then remarks that the language of Roman cult in the time which we know (when of course there can be no doubt that the application of the framework of Greek mythology was current) never includes references to mythological relationships, although its grouping of deities never violates these relationships, while Italian cult phrases do not shrink from saving "daughter of Juppiter." This is an important observation. Though the groupings at lectisternia (p. 28) are not relevant, since the custom is admit- tedly borrowed from the Greeks, there was a repugnance to the use of explicit terms of relationship. Koch is further right in saying that differentiation by sex was an essential part of the Roman concept of deity.1 The rest of the mionograph is devoted to an attempt to prove that the Roman figure of JuDpiter originally had chthonic ele- ments which were later put aside and which survived in Vediovis and in non-Roman cults in Italy.2 The argument is close and interesting, and deserves the careful attention of all students of ancient religion (e. g., pp. 39 if. on indiges). The conclusion seems to me to contain an important truth, which might be 1 But siue mas siue femina is a matter of legalistic caution: cf. Serv., ad Aen., II, 351, genio urbis Romae, siue mas stue femina, said to be inscribed on a Capitoline shield, though a Genius was after all definitely masculine. 2 Koch's references to Zeus Meilichios (pp. 34 ff.) require now to be reconsidered in the light of Nilsson's recent remarks, Arch. f. Rel., XXXV (1938), pp. 163ff.</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS. 397 formulated thus. The name of Juppiter was at Rome associated with a wide range of divine activities at very different levels.3 So were other divine names, notably Mars,4 and, when they were specialized by particular epithets, e. g. Juppiter Feretrius, the combination of name and epithet constituted an independent entity. Rome, as contrasted with some other Italian communi- ties, showed a tendency to recoil from specializations of Juppiter which involved a chthonic tinge. This dislike was perhaps acceni- tuated and crystallized as a result of the creation of the Capito- line cult, but the taboos applied to the flamen Dialis must be older and suggest that the repugnance had earlier roots. At the same time, if the name of Juppiter was associated with cult- ceremonies of other types, that association could not be broken. On Koch's more general thesis, that Roman religion was de- liberately stripped of myth, we should be cautious. K. Vahlert is probably right in rejecting the common idea that the hard- ness of Rome's early struggle for existence limited the play of the fancy.5 But when Koch asks whether we are to suppose in Rome an unparalleled absence of imagination, we may reply by asking whether we are instead to suppose an unparalleled rejection of the fruits of imagination. Our notions of myth are too much based on Greece; the sharpness of Greek anthropomorphism is a product of the heroic age and, apart from the Etruscans, there is no indication of anything like a heroic age in Italy. The Romans, like other people, envisaged forces of nature and other factors in life under personal terms: to do otherwise requires deliberate sophisticated thinking. But the myths did not take vivid form: whereas in Greece the normative element in religion was largely due to poets, in Rome it was due to men of a juristic and constitutional temper.
