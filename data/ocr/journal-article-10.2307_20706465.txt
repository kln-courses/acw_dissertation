<plain_text><page sequence="1">John Burton University of Papua New Guinea This is remarkable book by any standards. The publishing details along betray a project of extraordinary magnitude as few publishers today would take on a work with a tenth or even a twentieth of the number of illustrations and photographs. Evidently, publication was grant-assisted, and in the end the weighty result comes at a price that breaks few records nowadays. Paul Sillitoe is well known for his already comprehensive ethnographic writing on the Wola people of the Southern Highlands Province of Papua New Guinea, published hitherto in two books and many articles. He is no stranger to material culture studies, both through his statistical-documentary approach to presenting supporting informa tion on cultural topics such as exchange, and having previously published the results of stone axe experiments, among other things. Particularly notable in his earlier work in his sense of visual representation and attention to fine points of detail that become the hallmark of this book. Here he extends his coverage to a massive corpus of the entire material culture</page><page sequence="2">Reviews 315 inventory of the Wola. Evidently this comprises "only" some 169 artefacts, but the job presentation is far greater in scope than the arid work of creating a catalogue. The key difference is Sillitoe's obvious goal of trying to make the nearest thing to a manual of "how to make it" that he is able. He is more reserved about this than he need be, quoting (p. 19) an English craftsman ("My own eyes know because my owns hands have felt, but I cannot teach an outsider ...") on the futility of expecting description to be the verisimilitude of practical knowledge. Nevertheless, having become practised at making one of his artefacts ? the hafted stone axe ? I will settle for the idea that this is indeed a how-to-make-it guide for the "reasonably knowledgeable" Highlands artefact maker. There is no need to argue whether a novice could or could not follow the manufacture of this arrow or that basket, because we all know that this is simply not true of any other reference manuals. A knowledge of basic skills is always assumed. Viewing Made in Niugini this way, the volume becomes far more than a collection of exhaustive descriptions. I can "read" a good number of the "recipes" that are contained here which help to make the work a living thing. Some I cannot. For example, I know very well in theory how to make the woven bands variously used as axe bands (p.47), arrow ferrules (pp. 130-1), and woven armbands (pp.424-5), and I can follow the diagrams in principle. But to actually do this weaving (known as one round, two round, four round, etc., depending on the complexity) is another matter. It defies me, at any rate. Sillitoe has many others matters in mind in the book. All descriptions are well annotated with vernacular terms in this consistent, though idiosyncratic, orthography. Many are accompanied by timings for each stage of manufacture. A final section explores the question of whether various kinds of decoration carry cultural meanings. It is no surprise that the Wola almost snappily retort that they just follow their ancestors' custom: they do not carry about a ready-to-go set of explanations for why in practice they choose this or that design or method of decoration. Anecdotes relating to why men make distinct arrow designs (so they can tell whose arrow killed a victim of fighting) ring true, but I remain puzzled by the vivid and unique designs on war shields. Warriors all over the Highlands paint up with charcoal for anonymity in battle, arguably so that no one man is singled out and targetted. Why, then, do shield bearers go out of their way to draw attention to themselves through the distinctiveness of their designs (Wola ones are anthropomorphic, in other areas geometrical designs are common)? The last chapter also brings together information on the making and owning of each artefact by men and by women and explores gender issues. Material culture, in fact, proves an exceptionally useful vehicle for exploring these things through men's work and women's work. One snippet that is worth repeating here concerns the introduction of steel. It is easy to argue that women gained little direct benefit from this, indeed, that they still hold the wooden digging sticks they held long before contact. However, a careful analysis, following the information already provided on manufacturing times and on who makes what, leads Sillitoe to say that a man now saves about 53 hours a year with steel, and a woman about 21 hours. These are not highly significant figures in the context of annual work loads and rebut one particular set of arguments that</page><page sequence="3">316 Reviews colonialism, the agency that brought steel, enhanced the exploitation of women. (Of course, it may well have done so on other grounds.) I need to say a word about Sillitoe's methodology. Evidently he did not pursue artefact makers all around Haelaelinja, but was able to reap this rich harvest by setting up a "workshop"?a small shelter?adjacent to his house and offering to pay anyone who wished to make artefacts on the condition that everything must be done at the workshop. Experience suggests that this strategy brings its own problems, but that the amount of data generated far outweighs the possible distortions of work practice that the "laboratory" conditions impose. It would be ideal, indeed, to accidentally stumble across the making of every artefact in its rightful context, but it would be hopelessly inefficient. I do not expect this to loom as a genuine criticism of his approach. One observation: the Wola continue to come across as if frozen timelessly in the 1950s. In Sillitoe's photographs we see no man or woman wearing modem clothing; on no wrist a digital watch; on no map a road or highway. Some people may find the lack of acknowledgement of the 1980s "ethnographic present" irritating. Sillitoe's detachment from it lies in his sharing with his informant Maenget Saendaep a sense of impending loss of craft skills and knowledge. The (English) anthropologist brings a tradition very strong in his country, namely, a high cultural valuation of the crafts and rustic skills of yesterday; the informant his parallel discovery of rapid social and cultural change in his own society. The result is, by any measure, a fine testimony to the partnership between the anthropologist and all his informants.
