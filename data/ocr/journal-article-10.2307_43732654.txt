<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Šaiva Religion among the Khmers Part I Alexis Sanderson * The primary religion of the Khmers is now Theravāda Buddhism, as it is throughout mainland Southeast Asia with the exception of sinicized Vietnam; but the rise of that religion occurred only with the decline and fragmentation of the Khmer kingdom of Angkor and the concomitant growth of the power and influence of the Tai, who had adopted the Theravāda from the Mon of Dvāravatī and lower Burma. Our records of the Khmer principalities of the fifth to eighth centuries and of the unified kingdom of Angkor that emerged thereafter and endured into the fourteenth, show that religion throughout that time comprised three other faiths of Indian origin: Šaivism, the Pāncarātrika Vaisņavism of the Bhāgavatas, and Mahâyâna Buddhism in the developed form that includes the system of ritual and meditation known as the Mantranaya, Mantrayâna or Vaj rayana. The three coexisted harmoniously for the most part but with Šaivism predominant. This was so throughout ancient Kambujadeśa, the area of Khmer settlement that extended southeast through modern Kampuchea from the Angkor region north of the Great Lake into the delta of the Mekong river in southern Vietnam, and to the north, through north-eastern Thailand 1 and the Champasak province of southern Laos. 2 * Spalding Professor of Eastern Religions and Ethics, All Souls College, University of Oxford. 1 . The remains of nearly two hundred Khmer temples of the Angkorean period survive in modern Thailand in the provinces of Chanthaburi, Sa Kaeo, Prachin Buri, Nakhon Ratchasima, Buri Ram, Surin, Si Sa Ket, Ubon Ratchathani, Yasothon, Roi Et, Maha Sarakham, Khon Kaen, Chaiyaphum, and Sakon Nakhon, with the greatest concentrations in Nakhon Ratchasima, Buri Ram and Surin. 2. I have chosen to use the term Kambujadeśa to avoid confusion with the modern state of Kampuchea or Cambodia. Kambujadeśa or Kambuja is the name given to their territory by the Khmers in their Sanskrit and Old Khmer inscriptions of the Angkorean period: K 14, v. 3; K. 235, Khmer, C 1. 72; K 258 C, v. 2; K 278, v. 2; K 282 D, v. 23; K 549, 1. 12-13; K 956, 1. 16. They also show the form Kambudeśa (kamvudesa) and synonyms: K. 300, v. 9; K. 400 B, v. 2; K. 923, v. 14; K 806, v. 270a ( kambuvisvambharã ). These names were understood through a tradition that the Khmer kings are the descendants of a mythical progenitor Svâyambhuva Kambu (K. 286, v. 1 1 sqq.), i.e. as 'the land of the sons of Kambu' or 'the land of Kambu'. In Middle Khmer we find kāmbūj, kambūjdes, kāmbūjdes (K. 465 of A.D. 1583 [NIC I: 22]), in Modern Khmer kambujā/ Kampuchea/, and in Old Javanese kamboja ( Dekawamana 15.1). The earliest occurrence of the word of which I am aware is in A.D. 817. It occurs in Campa, the rival kingdom to the east of Kambujadeśa, in a Sanskrit inscription of king Harivarman I at the Po-Nagar temple (C. 2 = M. 26): ākambujārdham ajitabhujaujasã 'one the might of whose arm was unconquered right up to the middle of Kambuja[deśa]'. Perhaps there was no sense of any such comprehensive entity in the pre-Angkorean period. Running through the kingdoms of mainland Southeast Asia, the Da Tang Xiyu ji of Xuanzang (= Taishõ 2087), completed during that period, in A.D. 646, calls the kingdom between Dvāravatī ( dolobodi ) to the West and Mahācampā (mohojenbo) to the East not Kambujadeśa or similar, as we might expect, but Iśanapura ( yishangnabulo ) (Beal 1884, 2:200). This is the name of the capital (= Sambor Prei Kuk) of the Bulletin de l'École française d'Extrême-Orient, 90-91 (2003-2004), p. 349-462.</page><page sequence="2">350 Alexis SANDERSON The same configuration of religions held sway elsewhere in Southeast Asia. We find it to the east of the Khmers in Champa {campa), the confederated principalities of the Chams that occupied the coastal region and highlands of Cochin-China from the fifth century until the seventeenth. 3 It was much diminished by progressive Islamicization after the retreat of the capital to the Phan-rang (Pāņduranga) area in the South in the wake of the capture and destruction of Vijaya (Binh-Dinh) by the Vietnamese in 1471. 4 But the king remained a follower of the old tradition until at least 1607 5 and elements of it survived into modern times among the 'Brahmanisť Chams.6 There are signs of its presence in the Minangkabau region of Sumatra in the fourteenth century, 7 and in the kingdom of dominant principality of the period, named after its founder īsānavarman I (r. 616/7, 627-c. 635). The Chinese referred to the early southern coastal kingdom as Funan. Thereafter, from the seventh century onwards they referred to the land of the Khmers (gemie ) as Zhenla ( *Ts'iěn-láp ). The origin of neither term is known. I have seen no reference to the region or its people in any pre-modern Indian source. I write here by invitation, and do so aware that my competence is limited. As a Sanskritist working on the history of Šaivism I have come eventually to look beyond the Indian subcontinent to other regions in which this religion took hold, and this has led me to the inscriptions of the Khmers. But I have relied entirely on published transcriptions. I have not worked directly from the inscriptions themselves or from rubbings, squeezes, or photographs. Furthermore, I have very unequal competence in the two languages of the inscriptions, Sanskrit and Old Khmer, my knowledge of the latter being a superficial acquaintance that relies heavily on the translations of George Cœdès, Claude Jacques and Saveros Pou, and on the Dictionnaire vieux khmer-français-anglais of the last. I offer my own translations throughout, but where I have ventured to disagree with these scholars, I have not done so out of a superior sensitivity to the nuances of Old Khmer, but rather because I have felt that the subject and context demand an alternative within what I have thought with less than authoritative judgement to be the range of possible meanings. I am greatly indebted to my colleague Professor Gerdi Gerschheimer of Paris for encouraging me to undertake this work in spite of these deficiencies, for helping me to do so by providing a number of copies and photocopies of important epigraphical sources and studies and for saving me from many errors through his meticulous reading of my manuscript. I am grateful also to Dr. Arlo Griffiths of the University of Groningen for reading my manuscript and detecting a good number of misprints and other errors. 3. These principalities were centred in the string of coastal plains facing the South China Sea located, from north to south, in (1) the Binh-Tri-Thien area, (2) Quang-Nam and Quang-Ngai provinces (My-Son; capital Indrapura [Tra-kieu]); (3) Binh-Dinh province (capital Vijaya [Do-Ban or Cha-Ban], (4) Khanh-Hoa province (Kauthāra; capital Kauthāra [Po Nagar, Nha-Trang]), and (5) Phan Rang and Phan Ri provinces (Pāņduranga; capital Pāņdurangapura). In the Sanskrit inscriptions of this region and that of the Khmers the land of the Chams and the various peoples of the highlands is called Campa or Campādesa. In the inscriptions of the Khmers the Chams themselves are known as the Cāmpas: K. 273, v. 67 (Skt.); K. 1036 (NIC II-III, 149-155) (Khmer). 4. See Po Dharma 2001 (14-27) for an excellent up-to-date summary of knowledge of the history of Champa up to its demise in the first half of the nineteenth century. 5. bee the report ot Cornelis Matelief in 1608 cited by Reid (1993, 187). The mass of the Chams were Muslim by the 1670s, including the king (Manguin 1979, 269-71). 6. See Aymonier 1891, Cabaton 1901, Mus 1933. 7. Chinese, epigraphical and material evidence indicates that the powerful thalassocracy of Srivijaya ruling from Palembang from the seventh century to the thirteenth was Mahäyäna-Buddhist. It was followed by the kingdom of Malãyu, first centred in Jambi and then, by the beginning of the fourteenth century, on the west coast. Malãyu, unlike Šrivijaya, was in close contact with Java, which achieved ascendancy of this region from the late thirteenth century. This led to the introduction of Majapahit's Saiva-Buddhist religious culture. In 1284 the king of Malãyu received a composite statue consisting of copies of deity-statues from the Buddhist temple Candi Jago in East Java sent to him by king Krtanagara of Majapahit, an event recorded on the back of the statue in an Old Malay inscription (de Casparis and Mabbett 1992, 321). King Ãdityavarman of Malãyu (r. c. 1347-79), who had spent his early years in Majapahit, is described in his Surasao inscription as a follower of the esoteric Buddhist</page><page sequence="3">The Saiva Religion among the Khmers (Part I) 351 Kutai in the central region of the east coast of Kalimantan (Borneo). 8 It prevailed in East Java from the eighth century until the Muslim forces of Demak crushed Majapahit in about 1527, eliminating the last remaining major Saiva-Buddhist court of the region, and in West Java until those of Banten conquered the Sundanese court of Pajajaran in 1579. 9 It clung on into the eighteenth century in the kingdom of Blambangan on Java's Eastern Salient, and perhaps even within the Islamic kingdom of Mataram in the Central Javanese heartland. 10 It is still intact among the Balinese of the neighbouring islands of Bali and Lombok; and some of its Saiva practices and liturgies survive in Java itself, among the priesthood of a cluster of isolated communities in the Tengger highlands to the east of Malang, 11 a survival that suggests that when Islam began to make its inroads Saivism was not merely the religion of the courts but had put down deep roots in rural society, at least in some parts of Java. 12 cult of Hevajra (Satyawati Suleiman 1977 cited in de Casparis and Mabbett 1992, 321). But there is also an impressive fourteenth-century statue, 4,41 m in height, of a two-armed Bhairava standing on a corpse, said to have been found at Sungei Langsat (Schnitger 1937, plates 13-16; Cœdès 1968, 243, claiming that it is an image representing Ãdityavarman), and there is a set of fourteenth-century sculptures from Palembang in which Siva is flanked by Brahmā and Visņu reproduced in Soebadio 1992,120-121. 8. Saivite and Buddhist statues have been found in a cave at Gunung Kambeng; see Fontein 1990, 25, citing Bosch 1925. The stone statue of Siva, which conforms to the Javanese iconographical type (samapāda, holding a trident, a rosary, a fly-whisk, and showing the gesture of boons) has been reproduced in Soebadio 1992. Kutai is the site of the earliest Sanskrit inscriptions of maritime Southeast Asia, those of Mūlavarman in the late fourth or early fifth century associated with a shrine of a [Śiva] Vaprakesvara (Cœdès 1968, 52). Its rulers probably maintained their Saiva-Buddhist religious culture until they were converted to Islam in 1568. 9. Reid 1993,2:212-213. 10. See Ricklefs 1993, 366-367, n. 74 and Reid 1993, 2:149, 173-186 on the slow progress of Islam in Java, especially among the Javanist ( kejawen ) ruling elites, and the superficiality of its adoption by the lower orders of society. The Kartasura Babad ing Sangkala (Chronicle of the Chronograms) composed before about 1670 (Ricklefs 1993, 2) first mentions Muslims only in 1577-78, recording their defeat of Šaiva-Buddhist Kadiri; and we have a Dutch report of 1598 that Javanese Muslims were found only on the north coast and that the people of the interior were all heathen (Reid 1993, 2:173-174). Blambangan was under the control of the Saiva-Buddhist kingdoms of Bali, first Buleleng and then, from 1711, Mengwi (Ricklefs 1993, 161). As evidence of Saiva-Buddhist survivals in Mataram Ricklefs (1993, 366-367) notes that the Dutch East India Company reported superstitious heathen (supertitieuse heydenen) in Mataram in 1743. For the survival of some isolated Saiva-Buddhist religious communities see also Pigeaud 1967, 54. 1 1. On the religion of the Tengger communities see Hefner 1985. He reports (1985, 8) that at the time of his research there were some twenty-eight priests in a like number of village units comprising some 40,000 people living at altitudes between 1400 and 2000 metres, somewhat shielded from Islamicization by the fact that the massive expansion of the population of Java during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries (from around 5 million in 1800 to around 100 million at present) and the consequent migration into less populous areas largely passed them by, since these villages are above the altitude at which sugar and coffee can be cultivated (Hefner 1985, 31-33). Tengger communities in the lower villages and in the nearby towns (Malang, Pasuruan, Probolinggo and Lumajang) have been converted to Islam (ibid.). 12. Hefner 1985. 9.</page><page sequence="4">352 Alexis SANDERSON The Sources Our evidence for these three religions in Kambujadeśa up to the fall of Angkor, as for all other aspects of its history, consists primarily of inscriptions. More than a thousand have been discovered and published, engraved on stone stelae, image-pedestals, and the jambs of temples, written in Sanskrit verse, in Khmer prose, or commonly in both. The great majority belongs to the period from the last quarter of the ninth century, some seventy-five years after the beginning of the Angkorean kingdom, down to its end. For the first part of the Angkorean period we depend mostly on dubious information in later inscriptions, and before that only the seventh century is well represented, by some two hundred contemporary records. In all periods these epigraphs record the establishing or restoration of temple-deities, temples, hermitages and other pious foundations by royalty, high dignitaries and local leaders, their endowments consisting of land, slaves ( khñum , Skt. dãsah ) to work that land and to serve as cooks, musicians and the like, livestock, ritual implements and other valuables, or the settlement of title disputes concerning these, and the allocation of revenues {kalpana) for purposes such as the funding of specific recurrent ceremonies and the subsistence of religious officiants and other staff. They commonly introduce these practicalities with eulogies of the monarch and his ancestors, and also of the donor himself if other than the king, eulogies which sometimes contain information on matters of interest to the historian of religion, such as accounts of other pious works of the donor, the history of priestly lineages and their relations with their patrons through appointment to religious, administrative and other offices, rituals performed or sponsored, and in rare instances, the names of the textual authorities followed in these performances. In addition we have the evidence of a great wealth of material culture in the form of the remains of religious edifices, images of their deities, ritual objects, and bas-reliefs showing scenes from the Indian epics and the life of the population. The sheer number of the Khmer's temples, the vast scale of the greatest of them, and the inscriptions that detail their endowments, reveal that the creation and support of such foundations was central to the economic, cultural and political life of the whole society. They channelled and promoted agricultural production, engaging a very substantial proportion of the region's human and material resources, they integrated the realm, and they legitimated the tenure of land and power. 13 No non-epigraphical texts remain from the pre-Angkorean and Angkorean periods, other than a few short Chinese reports redacted in later compendia and a Chinese memoir of 1296-97 written by Zhou Daguan, who spent eleven months in Angkor with an embassy sent by Temür Öljeitü, the second Mongol emperor of China. None of these throws much light on the Khmers' religions. For the literature that sustained and expressed them, in the form of sacred texts, commentaries, handbooks of ritual, and temple archives, was transmitted in palm-leaf manuscripts, which cannot survive long in the hot and humid climate of Southeast Asia. 14 Once the information they contain had lost its relevance with the decline of Angkor and the rise of Theravāda Buddhism there would have been no reason to preserve it by making new copies. 13. Hall 1985, 136-138, 160-161. 14. The region of Angkor has a monsoon climate. It rains on average on more than half the days of the five months from May to October, with annual rainful in recent years averaging 1 ,4 1 0 mm. Temperatures climb above 35°C in April and May and fall to a little over 30°C at the end of the year. Relative humidity fluctuates between 60 percent and 80 percent (Acker 1998, 7; Nesbitt 1997, 32). Documents on palm-leaf are unlikely to survive long in such conditions.</page><page sequence="5">The Saiva Religion among the Khmers (Part I) 353 Though all local manuscripts of pre-Theravādin times have perished, manuscripts of some of the Sanskrit texts that the Khmers' inscriptions identify as guiding their ceremonies in the Angkorean period do survive in the Indian subcontinent. In the case of Saivism these works were primary authorities in India only in the early period during which the form of the religion they teach was introduced among the Khmers. Not long after that they were followed in the subcontinent by a second wave of texts propagating a simplified system of Saiva observance that rendered them largely irrelevant. This early obsolescence would no doubt have led to their complete disappearance, were it not that the Kathmandu valley has a temperate climate that has enabled a few manuscripts to survive there from the ninth and tenth centuries, when these changes had not yet occurred or, at least, had not yet affected this rather isolated region. By studying these and related sources we have a means of adding to our knowledge of Khmer religion. Scripture and Paddhati However, common sense and the character of the Indian Saiva literature must alert us to the naivety of assuming that these works can reveal more than the general parameters within which some elements of local practice would have operated. They are texts of scripture ( ãgamah , tantram , samhita) and as such were designed to be accepted as authorities by the widest possible constituency. To that end they tend to prescribe only the bare framework of practice, thereby allowing for the great variety on the level of detail and ancillary elaboration that can be observed in the practical manuals (Paddhatis) that guided the procedures followed by religious officiants in specific regions and lineages. The Khmers too had their manuals setting out the procedures to be followed in the worship of their deities. A Khmer inscription of A.D. 1306 from Banteay Srei (Isvarapura) refers to such a text: qnak varņna khnar grān nā vrah kamrateň añ pre pamre ta vrah kamrateń añ ru devatāksetra sap anie nusāra śloka prasasta vrah pânjîy ksetropacāra khnar graň corr. : khnar grań Pou • nusāra corr. : nu sāra Pou K. 569 (ed. Pou 2001, 166-171), 11. 17-19 The personnel of the corporation of Khnar Grań at [the temple] of the goddess are commanded to serve the goddess as [is done] in all [other] deity-sites, following {nusāra) the verses of the ordinances {śloka prasasta) of the Sacred Manual {vrah pânjîy) on the Procedure for Worship at Sacred Sites {ksetropacāra). 15 15. Pou translates the last phrase as follows: "suivant en cela les stances du saint registre relatif au domaine". For Khmer Skt. upacārah in the meaning '[ritual] service' see K. 254, v. 8: devadvijopa- cārārtham 'to serve the gods and brahmins'; K. 258 C, v. 10: agryopacãrair 'with fine offerings'. The Sanskrit term panjl , panjikā from which the Khmer form pânjîy is derived is used in Indian sources to denote both written records or registers, such as those that priests keep of their clients, and guides to ritual (Paddhati). An example of the latter is the Panjikā of Brahmaśambhu, a Paddhati on the Šaiva rituals composed in A.D. 938. Thus in the Naimittikakarmānusandhāna , f. 54r3: prakāsito yam arthātmā panjikopäyato maya. 'I have clarified this topic by means of the Panjikā* ; f. 31r3-4: prapañcah sakalo py asya nityakarmasamuccaye / nirddistah panjikãyân ca teneha na pratanyate 'I have taught the full elaboration of this in the Nityakarmasamuccaya and the Panjikā '. Similarly in Jayadrathayâmala , Satka 1, f. 197v8-9: kriyã vā dekikendreņa vyãkhyeyã panjikāgatā 'or else the Guru should explain the ritual [as set out] in the Panjikā '. I am very grateful to Mr. Guy Leavitt of the University of Chicago, who went to the trouble of obtaining a microfilm of the Naimittikakarmānusandhāna manuscript for me in Calcutta.</page><page sequence="6">354 Alexis SANDERSON and an inscription of the reign of Udayädityavarman II (1050-1066) reveals in a eulogy of his predecessor, the devout Saiva king Sûryavarman I (r. c. 1002-1050), that the latter had composed one or more such works: sivapūjāviseso pi sāstroktas srutamãtrakah dhiyã viracito yasya sivãnsasyãkhilocitah K. 661, v. 61 And being a born devotee of Siva (sivãmsasya) he was able by virtue of his intelligence to compose a fully appropriate [manual for] an excellent ritual of Šiva worship taught in [Šaiva] scripture as soon as he had heard it [expounded in that source]. 16 16. Cœdès misunderstood the verse as follows (IC 1:213; my trans, and parentheses): "The least particulars of the worship of Šiva ( sivapūjāviseso pi), prescribed by the treatises (śastroktah) or only transmitted orally, were entirely understood (akhilocitah) only when they had been redacted ( viracito ) by the wisdom (dhiya) of this (king) (yasya) who was a portion of Šiva ( sivãmsasya )". His rendering of sivapūjāviseso 'pi is contradicted by the singular number. There is nothing in the verse that justifies his "or". The compound srutamãtrakah (= śrutamatrah with the stem-extending suffix -ka- for the sake of the metre) has been wrentched from its common idiomatic sense, that is to say "merely heard" in the meaning "as soon as heard". For the use of Bahuvnhis in -mãtra- after a past participle passive in this sense see, e.g., Renou 1984, 117. The Šāstra(s) of sāstroktah are more naturally understood as the Šivasāstra(s), i.e. the Šaiva scriptures. This is the normal sense in Šaiva works, where it is not, as in Buddhist usage, used to refer to works of scholarship as opposed to scripture. "Entirely understood" cannot be the meaning of akhilocitah , which must mean either "entirely appropriate" or, less probably, "appropriate to all". As for sivãmsasya , which Cœdès understood as a Tatpurusa compound meaning "a portion of Šiva", it is rather to be understood as a Bahuvrihi meaning "whose amśah is towards Šiva". In Šaiva terminology a compound formed of the name of a deity followed by the word -amśah means a devotee of that deity, more precisely a person with a natural inclination (amśah) towards that deity rather than another. This can be seen in a passage of the Kiraņa in which it teaches three versions of the postmortuary Šrāddha ritual, calling them the Šivasrāddha, the Rudrasrāddha and the mundane (laukikam) Šrāddha. The first is for the benefit of Šaiva initiates ( dīksitāh ), the second for that of rudramśah , and the third for that of brahmins who are neither (f. 95r2-4 [6 1.6-1 0b]): Tśas sadaśivah śanto deśikatritayam bhavet / sãdhaka*dvitayam (em. : trtayaś Cod.) cãnyad rudrānantam iti sthitam / trptaih tair nikhilan trptam śivantam abhavat khaga / diksitãnãm śivaśraddham rudramśanan tadātmakam / tatra caņdamahākālau dvau gaņau dvitaye sthitau rudrah skando *ganeśo 'nyas (em. : ganeśanyat Cod.) tritaye samsthitãs tv ime I tapasvibhih dvijaiś cãtra rudraśraddham prakalpayet / kurvvanti ye narã bhaktyã rudralokam vrajanti te / laukikam brahmavisnvJśa*suryantakavikalpitam (em.: süryäntikavikalpitam Cod.) and (f. 96r5-vl [61.34-36]): śraddham evamvidham śaivam śivasayojyadam param / rudraśraddham svanāmāhkam praņavādi namontikam / rudrasãyojyadan caiva devatãnãm svasamjnayã / krte smin laukike śraddhe *narakam na sa (conj. : navamãsyam sa Cod.) paśyati / viprāņām vihitam śraddham vedoktam smrtikalpitam / brahmalokam avāpnoti tatkartã dvijasattamah. That rudramśah means 'devotee of Rudra/Šiva' (rudr abhakt ah, śivabhaktah) here is evident from its occurrence elsewhere in the same passage. Three balls of rice (piņdāh) are to be put out in a line in the course of the Šrāddha. If the wife of the person commissioning the ceremony (the karta) desires a son she should eat the one in the middle. She will then, we are told, give birth to one who will grow up to be a rudramśah (f. 96r4 [61.31]): putrārtham vanita śuddha madhyamam piņdam ãpnuyãt / tadā tasya naro dhīro rudramśah strîyuto bhavet. That this was understood to mean "devotee of Rudra/Šiva" is apparent from the parallels of this passage seen in the Brhatkãlottara (f. 196vl: v. 57c) and the Kriyãsamgrahapaddhati of Vāladhārin (f. Ill v2- 3). For there the son is described respectively as śańkarah 'a devotee of Šaňkara' (janayec chānkaram putrām) and śivabhaktah 'a devotee of Šiva' ( ¡ayate dhanavān putrah śivabhaktah suśllavań). Furthermore, the triad initiate (dīksitāh), rudramśah and ordinary brahmin identified as the beneficiaries of the three kinds of Šrāddha is parallelled in this same passage by the triad initiate, rudrabhaktah and ordinary brahmin, where these are those who may, in order of</page><page sequence="7">The Saiva Religion among the Khmers (Part I) 355 sivãrccanãgnihotrãditapasyâsãdhanãni yah mantratantrãni samkodhya vidhaye rañjayad dhiyã K. 661, v. 74 Intelligently redacting the Mantras and rites that accomplish the worship of Siva, the fire-sacrifice, other [rituals], and ascetic practice, he clarified them for ritual application. and: yuktam ukto maheko yas tapasyãsãdhanam vidhim sädhükrtya krtodyogair yogibhir yyad akãrayat K. 661, v. 76 He was aptly called the Great Lord (/Śiva) since he removed errors from the procedure for the practice of asceticism and then saw to it that it was followed by determined meditators.

The section on the last is mostly lost through damage to the codex but the other two are defined in a manner that supports my interpretation. The first is said to be one who is ever eager to study the Vedas, who accepts the Upanisadic doctrine of the Self, and who aims to reach the paradise of Brahmā (brahmalokam sadākānksan ), while the second is said to be ever eager to meditate on Visņu ( visnudhyãnaratah sada) and to aspire to enter his paradise ( visnusãyojyakãnksinah ). Of the first line of the two-line definition of the rudrāmsah we have only the last four syllables, in which he too is said to be ever devoted ( ratah sadã' presumably to the meditation or worship of Rudra ( rudradhyãnaratah sadā / rudrapūjāratah sadã or similar).

To increase [the king's] splendour this brahmin, with the king's permission, taught the Siddhi and the means of achieving it (. sasãdhanãm ) to that offerer of the [king's] sacrifices, [knowing that he was one] whose tranquil mind was devoted entirely to [his monarch's] welfare. The Brahman revealed to him as though by means of [this] Siddhi the four faces of Tumburu that are the scriptures Śiraścheda , Vinãsikha , Sammoha and Nayottara , and in order to increase the prosperity of the realm he carefully extracted the essence of [those] texts through his mastery of the esoteric [teachings] and [with it] established the Siddhis that bear the name Devarāja. 18 This 'essence' (, sãrah ) that Hiranyadama extracted is evidently a manual for practical application, a Paddhati or Panjikā, since we are told that after extracting it he proceeded to install the powers known as the Devarāja. The point must be that he redacted a Paddhati for this purpose on the basis of those scriptures. It might be objected that if the 'essence' were a manual of ritual procedure then learned Indian tradition dictates that it should be claimed that it is based not on four texts but on one, a Paddhati, literally 'a pathway', being a practical manual that guides the performer of a ritual by co-ordinating the Mantras and actions taught explicitly or implicitly in the various parts of a single scripture, setting them out explicitly in the order of their performance and utterance, supplementing them from related scriptures only where the silence of the primary source requires it. 19 However, the account of the events 17. The meaning of the term ãrya- is uncertain. It could mean a person of North India, an inhabitant of Aryadeśa, a sense that is found in Old Javanese inscriptions; see Zoetmulder 1982, s.v. ãrya , karņataka , kěliň, and dravida , and the inscription of Kaladi, 7b 1-2 (Barrett Jones 1984, 186), where they are distinguished from the people of Kalińga, Śrilańka, Karņātas, Dravidas etc. However, it may have been used here, as also in Old Javanese, to refer to powerful persons of noble birth; see Zoetmulder 1982, s.v. ãrya and Robson 1995, 139 ad Deśawarnana 81.3-4. 18. Tumburu is indeed four-faced; see, e.g., Vīņāsikha 96b-97b: tumburum karņikopari / padmāsa- nopavistam tu varadãnodyatakaram II caturvaktram astabhujam. The four texts are these four faces in the sense that they are thought to have been uttered by them, by analogy with the well-known tradition that Sadāsiva's five faces are the sources of the five streams of the Šaiva revelation: the Siddhānta from the upper, the Vārna from the left-facing, the Dakšiņa from the right-facing, the Gāruda from the front- facing, and the Bhautika from the rear-facing. 19.

K. 235, Khmer, Cll. 71-75 Then a brahmin called Hiranyadãma, who was learned in the Mantras that bestow Siddhi, came from Janapada. The Venerable Paramesvara [the late Jayavarman II] requested him to perform a ritual in order that this land of Kambuja (Kambujadeśa) should not continue to be a dependency of Javā and so that only one king should be universal ruler [in this region]. That brahmin performed the ritual [for those ends] following the venerable Vinãsikha and established the Kamrateň Jagat ta Rāja (= Devarāja). The brahmin [then] taught the Vinãsikha , the Nayottara , the Sammoha and the Śiraścheda. He recited them from beginning to end so that they could be written down, and taught them to Steń añ Šivakaivalya. It is clear from this that the 'essence' of those four Vārna scriptures was not a hybrid but a Paddhati based on one of them. This text, called the Vinãsikha here, is evidently the Viņās ikha/Vīņāsikhātantra that survives in a single Nepalese palm-leaf manuscript. It is widely attested in Indian sources as one of the principal Vārna scriptures20 and presents itself in its opening verses as the culmination or essence of the Vārna revelation already given in the other three texts. 21 It does not teach a ritual specifically for the purposes of independence and political unity indicated in the inscription, but then nor does any Saiva text known to me. One would expect that Hiranyadãma simply wrote these aims into the prose formula of intention (samkalpah) that any text of worship must contain when enacted for the benefit of the worshipper or his client, 22 perhaps choosing the ninth day of the lunar fortnight [throughout its length], and (ii) whatever [else] those explicit statements imply. An example is the Yajnasütra in the case of the [Kāthakaļ Yaiurveda'. 20. The error in the Khmer report of the title is certainly that of the composer of the inscription rather than the engraver or editors, since it also appears in the Sanskrit, where the metre requires the short syllable provided by the erroneous vi-. It should be remembered that the inscription was composed in A.D. 1053, some two hundred and fifty years after the installation it reports. It is only too likely that by then the Paddhati based on the Vinãsikha was all that had survived of the Vārna literature and that the original title had become distorted. 21. Vinãsikha 4-10. Note that in v. 12 it refers to its configuration of mantras/deities (Yaga) as the essence of the Tantras, by which it means those of the Vārna division: yãgam ãdau pravaksyãmi tantrasãram sudurlabham / *yenaiva (em. : tenaiva Cod. and Goudriaan) varada devyo nityam devi bhavanti hi 'I shall first teach you the Yaga, the essence of the Tantras, so hard to find, by means of which, O goddess, the [four] goddesses will constantly grant one's desires'. 22. The formula is to express the intention in an adverbial compound ending in -artham 'for the purpose of. For example, in the Svacchandabhairavakramamahāsarvasāntividhānam , f. 3v9, we see amukasãntyartham balim grhna 'Accept the bali for the averting [of ills] from N' and in the Rudrasānti section of the same manuscript we see in f. 19r6: dvTpamãrJmahotpãtasãntyartham mrtyunjayãya sarvapüjitäya namah 'Obeisance to Mrtyuñjaya worshipped by all for the averting of the great disaster of disease throughout the land'; and in f. 19r9-vl: mahãmrtyunjaya mahãjanaksayaprasãntyartham desotpātamahāmārībhayasāntyartham balim grhna 'Great Mrtyuñjaya accept the bali for the averting of</page><page sequence="10">358 Alexis Sanderson {navami) for the ceremony on the authority of the Vīņāsikha , which rules that a king who seeks victory over his enemies should have the worship of the deities of this text performed on that day. 23 The Vīņāsikha also lacks instructions on the procedures for the installation of images ( pratisthã ). But that too would not prevent the Vīņāsikha from being taken as the basis of a Paddhati composed for that purpose, since to select a scripture for a Paddhati is only to select its system of Mantras, its configuration of deities (yãgah ) and other basic constants. With these in place it is a simple matter to add any rituals such as those of installation that it happens not to cover but that are essential components of any Śaiva system. We see exactly this in the surviving mainstream Paddhatis of the Indian Saiddhāntika Saivas, nearly all of which are Paddhatis of the Kãlottara in its two-hundred verse redaction, a text which says nothing of installation. 24 We cannot assume, then, that references in Khmer inscriptions to rituals as following certain scriptural sources enable us to access the nature of those rituals in any detail where those sources happen to have survived. The Paddhatis that guide and reflect actual practice though claiming to be based on such texts draw only their framework from them. They are obliged to fill this in and extend its application by drawing extensively on other sources if they are to contain comprehensive prescriptions capable of governing the whole range of rituals that the faithful require. Nor should we assume that the inevitable supplementation would have been limited to closely related sources. Šaiva theoreticians require this and argue against eclectic syncretism. But their argument is a conservative attack on an established practice. Thus the Kashmirian Bhatta Rāmakaņtha (fi. c. 950-1 000) 25 decries a tradition of incorporating the procedures of the Svacchanda into worship based on the Matańga on the grounds that the two texts belong to separate streams of the Šaiva revelation, the former being a text of the Dakšiņa or Bhairava division and the latter one of the Saiddhāntika division: yena tv atra etacchãstrakramam vihãya svatantrapaddhatikrama ullikhitah sa svacchandam upeksanîya èva. yato yatretikartavyatã na srüyate tatrākānksabalāt samhitãntaratas tadapeksã yuktã na sarvatra anavasthiteh. ity uktam: kriyãdi- bhedabhedena tantrabhedo yatah smrtah. tasmãt tatra yathaivoktam kartavyam nãnyatantratah iti. tatrãpi svasrotasa evaikasrotopadešarūpatvena samnikarsãt na destruction from the whole community, for the averting of national disaster, of the peril of fatal epidemic disease'. Similarly, in the text of the Śaiva postfunerary Gopradãnavidhi of Kashmir the worshipper is made to say that he is about to worship the gods listed in the formula ãtmanah punyavrddhyartham vãnmanahkãyopãrjitapãpanivãranãrtham pituh rudrasya paralokapunyavrddhyartham sivapadavī- prãptyartham (f. 7v) 4 for the increase of my own merit, for the removal of the sins that I have acquired through word, mind and body, for the increase of merit of the Rudra who is [my deceased] father in the next world and for [his] reaching the path of Śiva' 23 .Vīņāsikha 17: samgrãme vijayãrthl vã pararas tra *vimardane (conj. : vimardanam bd.) / navamyãm *pãrthivo (em. : pãrthivam Ed.) y ãgam kurvîta bhaginîpriyam 'Alternatively if a king desires victory in battle, [or] intends an assault on the kingdom of an enemy, he should perform the ceremony of worship dear to the Sisters on the ninth day [of the month]'. 24. All the major early Saiddhāntika Paddhatis that have survived are based on the Dvisatika-Kalottara: the Paddhati of Brahmaśambhu (Brahmaśambhupaddhati) (938 A.D.), the Siddhãntasãrapaddhati of Bhojarāja (r. 1018 to 1060), the KriyãkãndakramãvatJ of Somaśambhu (Somaśambhupaddhati) (1095/6), the Kriyãkramadyoti/cã of Aghorasiva (1 157/8) and the JMnaratnâvaïi of Jñanasiva (second half of the twelfth century). Only one Saiddhāntika Paddhati survives that is based on another scripture. That is Aghorasiva's Mrgendrapaddhati , which, as its name reveals, is a Paddhati of the Mrgendratantra. But his purpose in this work is evidently not to promote an alternative model for the Saiddhāntika ceremonies. 25.

This is because it is proper to supplement a scripture by drawing on another only where a procedure is not explicitly stated [but evidently required]. In such cases one may draw on another scripture, because one is forced to do so by the incompleteness [of the base-text]. But one may not do so in all cases, because that would remove all consistency. This is why we have the text 'Tantras are distinguished from each other through their differences in the domains of ritual (kriyã) [, meditation practice iyogah)] and [observance ( caryã )]. So one must follow the instructions of that [scripture which one has adopted] and not those of any other system.' Moreover, even then ( tatrãpi ) [, when one is obliged to supplement its information from another source, one should do so] from [a scripture of] one's own division of the Saiva canon, that being the closest since it has the nature of instruction within one and the same stream of revelation. One may not do so from any other division [such as that of the Svacchandatantra ], because it is too remote from that and because this would lead to the undesirable consequence of the presence of practice of a contrary nature [within Saiddhāntika Saivism]. That is why 1 have taught: 'It is not proper in [the practice of] one scripture to do what has been taught in another.' 26 But the Paddhati Siddhãntasãra composed by Mahārājādhirāja Bhojadeva, probably the Paramara king of that name who ruled from Dhārā in modern Gujarat from A.D. 1018 to 1060, shows that the influence of the Svacchanda was too great to be withstood. For though his Paddhati is based on the two-hundred-verse redaction of the Kãlottara , a Saiddhāntika scripture, it has drawn extensively on the three and a half thousand verse Dakšiņa Svacchanda , though without acknowledging the fact, especially in its treatment of the rituals of initiation. Indeed large parts of his Paddhati are little more than a prose redaction of passages of that scripture. 27 The influential Saiddhāntika Paddhati of 26.

Our understanding of Indie ceremonial traditions has tended to be dominated by the model of the archaic Vedic (Śrauta) sacrifice, which has come down through the centuries in a remarkably stable and uncontaminated form. The Śaivas too wished their traditions to be seen in this light and at every stage have denied, or would have denied, that they were innovating, insisting that they were faithfully preserving the tradition of a specific ancient scripture, supplementing its instructions from ancillary sources only where absolutely necessary and with the understanding that they were doing so in accordance with an intention implicitly conveyed by that scripture, thus avoiding all syncretism. We have now seen that this model fails to stand up to analysis even in the domain of the private worship required of individual initiates for their own benefit, where we might expect that reasons for innovation would have been less compelling since such worship was comparatively free of market forces.

We should consider it very probable that the Paddhatis that guided their ceremonies among the Khmers were freely modified over time to appeal to or satisfy the expectations of new clients, such as immigrant brahmins patronized by the court or an incoming dynasty with its own traditions of worship for the protection of the king and the state. Anyone who doubts this need only examine the relationship between scripture and Paddhati throughout the Indie world. I shall consider three examples, from Kashmir, Nepal and Bali. These are cultural zones which received their Šaivism independently. Features that they share are therefore very unlikely not to have been found in their common source and, moreover, in other zones that received the religion, such as Kambujadeśa. Readers whose interest is purely Khmerological may wish to skip the rest of this subsection, moving directly to the next section (p. 377). Kashmir The Paddhatis used by the Šaiva officiants of Kashmir until recent times, notably the Kalādīksāpaddhati and the Agnikãryapaddhati, are based on the scriptures Svacchandatantra and Netratantra. Study of those scriptures and their learned commentaries written by the Kashmirian Ksemarāja (fl. c. 1000-1050 A.D.) leads one to assume that their ritual systems, being distinct in their Mantras, deities and other defining particulars, would be kept distinct. But we find that they are fused in these manuals within single ceremonies, and that this hybrid is further elaborated through the insertion of the worship of numerous subsidiary deities drawn from various sources, some of them local goddesses such as Šārikā, Rājnī and Jvālāmukhī, and others drawn from mainstream traditions, such as Mālinī, Kubjikā, Tripurasundari, and, from the Kalpas of the Jayadrathayãmala : Nityākālī, Pāpāntakāriņī, BhâgyâdhirohinI, Bhuvanamālinī (Dīksādevī), Mantradāmarikā, Mantramātrkā, Vāgīsvarī, Vāgbhavesvarī, Vidyãvidyesvari, Saptakotīsvari and Siddhalaksmī. 29 Further, there are distinct redactions of these texts which differ from each other in the presence or absence of the worship of certain deities or in following different sources for their worship. Thus the version of the Agnikãryapaddhati in a Paris manuscript adds the East-Indian Šākta deities Tārā, Bhuvanesvarī, Bhadrakālī, Dakšiņā Kālī, Bagalāmukhī and Vajrayoginî to the goddesses who receive oblations in the Šaiva fire-sacrifice, 30 deities that are no part of early Kashmirian tradition and are lacking both in a Göttingen manuscript's version of this Paddhati and in the corresponding section of the fire-worship that ends the ceremony of Šaiva initiation in the Kashmirian Kalādīksāpaddhati. 31 29. See Sanderson 2002, 2 and 22-23 (endnote 19) for a full list of the goddesses who receive offerings in the fire-sacrifice that is a regular constituent of the Paddhatis of the Kashmirian Šaiva officiant (gõryun). The seats (Pīthas) of the local Kashmirian goddesses listed are as follows: (1) Šārikā: in Šrinagar on the NW side of the hill Hāraparbuth (Skt. Šārikāparvata, also called Pradyumnaśikhara); (2) Rājnī (/Khīrbhavānī): at Tulamul (Skt. Tülamülya); and (3) Jvālā/Jvālāmukhī: on a spur at Uyen (Skt. Ovanā) / Khruv (Skt. Khadūvī). They and Bālā, whose seat is under a Deodar tree at Bālahom (Skt. Bālāsrama) to the NE of Pāmpar (Padmapura), are the family goddesses ( kuladevT) of the Kashmirian brahmins ( DevTrahasya , introd., p. 2). For the presence of these goddesses at these sites see Stein 1961, 2:459 (Bālā), note on 1.22 (Jvālāmukhī), note on 4.638, and 2:446-447 (Šārikā), and 488 (Rājnī). For their fairs ( utsavah ) see Koul 1991, 85-97. The antiquity of these local goddesses is uncertain. Šārikā at least was already venerated in the eleventh century since she is mentioned in the Kashmirian Kathãsaritsãgara of Somadeva (reign of Kalaśa, 1063 and 1081/2); see 73.107-118. Paddhatis for the worship of these four goddesses have been published as supplements (parisistãni ) to the DevTrahasya. 30. These goddesses are covered in ff. 80r5-84v8 of the Paris manuscript. 31. Kalādīksāpaddhati , A, ff. 220rl-227rl2.</page><page sequence="14">362 Alexis SANDERSON Dakšiņā Kālī, who is the foremost of these East-Indian goddesses, has also been added in the Paris version, together with Bhadrakālī, among the deities summoned to protect the Yaga;32 and the same two have been included among the goddesses in one version of the Paddhati of the Annapūrapūjā of the Saiva Šrāddha ceremony (. sivasrãddham ).33 Similarly, in the Kalādīksāpaddhati , first composed in A.D. 1335/6 by one Manoda but expanded and modified until at least the end of the seventeenth century,34 we find two redactions that differ in their sub-Paddhatis, one incorporating East-Indian tradition, the other not, for the preliminary worship of Ganeśa and the goddess Pustakavāglsvari. 35 I propose that these intrusive East-Indian elements were the result of the incorporation into Kashmirian brahmin society of the family stocks (krām) that share the name Kaul. They claim to be Kashmirians who moved from the Kashmir valley to Darbhanga in the eastern state of Bihar (Mithilā) in order to escape Islamic persecution during the reign of Sikandar (1389-1413) and then returned when conditions had improved during the reign of Zain-ul-abidin (1419, 1420-70). But there are compelling reasons to conclude that they 32. F. 27r-v. Dakšiņā Kālī (/Daksiņakālī) is the principal Kālī venerated in Bengal (Banerji 1992, 180). Her dark loi ling- tongued form, four-armed, her left hands brandishing a sword and holding a severed head, and her right hands showing the gestures of protection and the bestowing of boons, standing on the prostrate body of Śiva and surrounded by jackals, is held by tradition to have been revealed to the famous Bengali Šākta Krsņānanda Āgamavāgīsa Bhattâcârya of Navadvīpa (Banerji 1992, 91), author of the Tantrasāra , composed c. 1580 (ibid.). She appears in such East-Indian Šākta scriptures as the Kulacūdāmaņitantra (4.39-47); Todalatantra (1.3-4, 18), Phetkāriņītantra , Patala 10, Gup t as ādhanat antra, Patala 6, Niruttaratantra cited in Karpūrādistotratīkā p. 2, 3-11, Visvas ārāt antra cited ibid., p. 4, 13-16; and Mahākālasamhitā , ( Kāmakalākhaņda ) 241.4. 33. Annapūrapūjā f. 15r4-v3 (Daksiņakālī), 15v3-16v3 (Bhadrakālī). The published version of this Paddhati has only Bhadrakālī (Chandra 1984, 212a-218b, sivasrāddhe 'nnapūripūjā). The visualization-text ( dhyãnam ) of Daksiņakālī in the manuscript (f. 1 5r5- 12) is closely related to that of the East-Indian Phetkāriņītantra , 10.4c-12. 34. The date of the work's original composition and its subsequent expansion are recorded at its end (MS B, f.

Here ends this beneficent Ceremony of Initiation, composed by Mahāmāhesvara Manodadatta and expanded by Šivasvāmin.' Udayanadeva ruled Kashmir from 1 1 Pausa Laukika [43]99 (a.D. 1320) to 13 badi Phālguna (Šivarātri) Laukika [44] 14 (a.D. 1339). In support of these dates see Parmu 1969, 84, n. 44. The year 10, then, can only be 4410 of the Laukika (Saptarsi) era, since that was A.D. 1335/6. In the other era used by Kashmirian brahmins, that of the beginning of the Kaliyuga, the year 10 fell too early, [44] 10 being A.D. 1308/9. We have no information that enables us to date the expander Šivasvāmin or to determine whether he is one of the Šivasvāmins known from other sources or another. The latest addition to the text that I can recognize is in MS A. This gives the Bhairavastotra of Rājāna[ka] Šarikarakaņtha (f. 200r5) and the Sambhukrpãmanoharastotra of his son Rājānaka Ratnakaņtha (f. 201 vi 3-1 5) among hymns to be chanted after the consecration ceremony ( abhisekah ) that follows the dīksā.

For its worship of Ganeśa B follows East-Indian tradition (= Ãgamarahasya , Uttarãrdha 855-860) and for the worship of Pustakavāgīsvarī it combines that tradition (= ibid. 865-867b) with a Kashmirian tradition incorporating Jayadrathayãmala , Satka 4, pustakādhikārapatalah , ff. 209r4, 209r5-7 (= vv. 21 c-22b, 24^26).</page><page sequence="15">The Saiva Religion among the Khmers (Part I) 363 were Maithila brahmin immigrants from that region and that they conceived this story of return to support their assimilation. An anonymous Kashmirian Sanskrit tract of the Islamic period reports that the brahmins of Kashmir, who have often claimed to be all Sārasvatas, are actually Sārasvatas, Maithilas, Känyakubjas, Drāvidas, Gaudas, Autkalas and Gurjaras. Now it says that those Kashmirians who are Maithilas are distinguished from all others by the fact that their Gotra division is the Dattâtreya. 36 Since this is the Gotra of the Kauls and of the Kauls alone, at least in Kashmir, 37 we are being told that the Kauls are Maithilas and therefore that they are of East-Indian origin, since the term could never be applied to brahmins who had merely spent some years in Mithilā, the region from which the Maithilas derive their name. This conclusion is confirmed from within the Kaul community itself. For we have verses in two nineteenth-century Kashmirian manuscripts of collectanea of devotional works and liturgical texts of their tradition, in which an anonymous Kaul reveals not only that he belongs to the Dattâtreya lineage but also that he is a Maithila and a Yajurvedin of the Mādhyandinasākhā and the Kātyāyanasrautasūtra - the Maithila brahmins of Bihar are indeed either Mädhyandina Yajurvedins or Kauthumasakhlya Chandogas38 - and that his original home {pūrvabhūmih ) was in the land of Janaka, where Sita was born, on the banks of the Kolā river, that is to say, in northern Bihar at or near Sītāmarhi, about fifteen miles south of the modern Nepalese border. 39 The Kauls' presence there may explain the names of two villages in the vicinity: Madhkaul and Dhankaul. 40 36.

My former country is the land of Janaka ruled by a brahmin king, adorned by scholars adept in the study of Mīmārņsā, Nyâya and the Vedas, where Sita was born, where the venerable river Vāgvatī flows with its fresh waters, where the Suranagara river grants its presence, the site of the Bhairava Linga.' The traditional birthplace of Sītā is in Tirhut, in modern Sītāmarhi (26°35 N, 85°29 E) in the administrative division of that name (formerly the Sītāmarhi subdivision of the Muzaffarpur district). Sītā</page><page sequence="16">364 Alexis SANDERSON Once established in Kashmir, perhaps in the wake of the incorporation of the country into the Mughal empire by the emperor Akbar in 1586, 41 they adopted the local goddesses as their lineage deities, the doctrines of Kashmirian Saiva non-dualism, and the Kashmiri is believed to have sprung to life here from an earthen pot into which King Janaka had driven his ploughshare (O'Malley 1907, 156-158). That our anonymous author means this place and not some other possible claimant is confirmed by his mentioning the Vāgvatī and the Kolā. The former is the Bāgmatī river, which rises in Nepal near Kathmandu and descends south through northern Bihar, passing about 12 miles to the west of Sītāmarhi, or about 5 miles, if it is the old course of the river that is intended. The river Kolā ( kolāpagā ) flows south from the Bāgmatī at a point about 4 miles south of Dheng, passes about 8 miles to the west of Sītāmarhi and ends in the Bāgmatī about 16 miles SSW of Sītāmarhi and about 4 miles SW of Belsand. From the thirteenth century onwards Mithilā was indeed famous for its great experts on Mīmāmsā, Nyäya and Vaidika observance; and from the fourteenth it was indeed ruled by brahmins, having been made over as a fief to Kāmesvara Thakkura, the head of the Śrotriyas of Mithilā, by Tughlak Shah after his defeat of Harisimha, the last of the kings of the Karņāta (Simrāongarh) dynasty (c. 1097-1323), and the destruction of Simrāon, his capital. The Sugāon or Thākur dynasty founded by this brahmin ruled over Tirhut up to the early sixteenth century, until Tirhut was conquered by Nasrat Shah of Bengal (r. 1518-32) and put under the governorship of his son-in-law Ala-ud-din, to pass shortly afterwards with the fall of the independent kingdom of Bengal into the Mughal empire. For the three Pravaras of the Atri Gotra (its Gāvisthara division) mentioned in the verses see Brough 1953, 34; and for the Dattâtreya subdivision of this Gotra see ibid., 139. 40. Survey of India, Sheet No. 72F. Madhkaul lies between the Kolā and the Bāgmatī, about two miles W of Belsand. Dhankaul lies between the same rivers on the west bank of the old course of the Bāgmatī about two miles W of Parsauni, which lies about 5 miles N of Belsand. The two place-names are perhaps named after Kauls who received these villages as fiefs (jagir ): Mādh (= Mādhava) Kaul and Dhan (= Dhaneśa?) Kaul. The origin of the name Kaul is not clear. It is unlikely, I believe, to be a reference to their religion: as Śaktas they are indeed Kaulas. For that is not an identity that would be so publicly advertized. Perhaps it is rather from the Kolā river, by which they had settled. 41. The Kauls' claim that they entered Kashmir from Mithilā during the reign of Zain-ul-abidin (1419, 1420-70) is supported by Munshi Muhammad-ud-din Fauq (a.D. 1877-1945), who states in his Shabab-i-Kashmir that a Mādho (Mādhava) Kaul, a Ganesh Kaul and a Gopāl Kaul were in charge of the land settlement and grand irrigation schemes that marked this reign (Kilam [1955], 9). Such projects were indeed put into effect by Zain-ul-abidin (Parmu 1969, 148-154). But the contemporary histories (Rāj atar angiņī) written by Jonarāja and Šrīvara, covering the periods 1149-1459 and 1459-1486 respectively, make no mention of them nor, more tellingly, of any other Kaul. Kauls are also absent both from the history of the years 1486-1537 provided by Śuka (Rāj atar angiņī) and from the anonymous supplement which takes the chronicle of the kings of Kashmir up to 1597. In fact, the earliest sure evidence known to me of Kauls in Kashmir dates from the first half of the seventeenth century. Sāhib Kaul tells us in his Devīnāmavilāsa (17.18) that he completed that work in Vikrama 1723 at the age of 24, which places his birth in 1636 A.D.; and the author of the Dabistan-ul-Mazahab refers to Kauls whom he had met in Kashmir (trans. Shea and Troyer 1937, 229): Sudarshan Kal (= Sudarśan Kaul); Kopāl Kul (= Gopāl Kaul). From the text it appears that he was in Kashmir at dates from 1627, when he was a boy, to 1639 or 1640 A.D. Fauq reports a Pandit Sada Kaul favoured by the emperors Jahangir (r. 1605- 28) and Shah Jehan (r. 1628-1658) (Kilam [1955], 101). Perhaps the Kauls came in not during the reign of Zain-ul-abidin but in or after 1586, when Kashmir was annexed by Akbar, attached to the province of Kabul, and placed under the administration of imperial officers (Smith 1917, 240), this piece of family history having been pushed back to the time during which they claimed to have returned from Bihar. Perhaps the source of Fauq's report that Kauls were engaged in land settlement and irrigation schemes has also been dated to fit this claim. As a newly acquired territory of the Mughal empire Kashmir was immediately subjected to the rigorous system of land and revenue assessment introduced under Akbar. Five imperial officials were sent for this purpose. We know their names from the Akbarnāma of Abu-1 Fazl (Parmu 1969, 289-290), and they are not Kauls. But perhaps Kauls were brought in among their staff. They have certainly been prominent among the Kārkun sub-division of the brahmins of Kashmir, those who learned Persian and served in the administration of the Muslim rulers of the country.</page><page sequence="17">The Saiva Religion among the Khmers (Part I) 365 language, all of which can be seen in the works of Sāhib Kaul, composed in Kashmir in the seventeenth century. 42 But they also maintained their East-Indian Sākta traditions, as is shown by the same author's Paddhatis. I am aware of manuscripts of three works of this kind: his Syãmãpaddhati for the worship of Dakšiņā Kālī, his Srîvidyâpûjâpaddhati for the worship of Tripurasundari, and his Hrllekhāpaddhati for the worship of Bhuvanesvari. They show no connection with the Sākta Saivism long-established in Kashmir. They do not inherit its ritual forms, draw on its sources, or share its theology. They also contain elements entirely foreign to it, such as the consumption of the intoxicating drink known as samvit/samvidã or vijayã that is prepared from the powdered green Cannabis indica plant.43 42. Among these works by Sāhib Kaul (b. 1636) is a hymn to the local goddess Šārikā as the goddess of his patriline; Šārikāstava v. 17, f. 532r: stotram mantroddhãry adah sãrikãyãh sãhibkaulo vamsadevyãs cakāra 4 Sāhib Kaul is the author of this hymn to [his] lineage goddess Šārikā, a hymn which contains the [means of] the extracting of her Mantra [element by element from the initial syllable of each verse]'. He also wrote numerous works in which he expresses his devotion to the goddess in the language of Kashmirian Saiva non-dualism, such as Saccidānandakandalī , Sahajārcanasastikā , Svãtmabodha , Citsphãrasãrãdvaya , Sivasaktivilāsa , and Devīnāmavilāsa , a tour de force of devotional poetry in the most refined and complex style based on the Bhavāriīsahasranāmastotra. In the Kashmiri language we have his Janmacarita (BL, MS. Stein Or. f. 3 (v); SOAS MS no. 44390, ff. 69-140). 43.

That the drink is prepared from cannabis is stated in Sarvollāsa 30.21b, in a passage extracted from the Bhāvacūdāmaņi : bhangarūpā' and in a version of the Mantra to be recited when taking it, in which the substance is explicitly addressed by its mundane name bhańga: om bhańge bhańge mahābhange .... It is mixed with milk, water, Mādhvīka juice, molasses and other ingredients (Ānandapatala in Sarvollāsa 30.47-54). It is to be drunk before the pūjā proper after the worship of the deities around the door to the shrine. The long Mantra for the taking of this drink is exactly as in East-Indian sources, except that where the Kashmirian Paddhatis have brāhmanānām they have bhairavāņām; see, e.g., Sarvollāsa p. 117; cf. Samayäcäratantra f. 30v ( bhairavānandatattvārtham ). In other Šākta Šaiva systems, such as those inherited by the Kashmirians, the only intoxicant consumed in ritual is alcoholic liquor. In the relatively late tradition seen in East-Indian Sākta texts the cannabis-drink has been added; and the Mantra given for its empowerment ( abhimantraņam ) is a variant of that already current for alcoholic drinks; see Syãmãpaddhati , ff. 1 7r6- 7: om amrte amrtodbhave amrtavarsiņi amrtam ãkarsaya 2 siddhim dehi ...svāhā and cf. Kulārņavatantra 6.55, which gives ...amrte amrtodbhave amrtešvari amrtavarsiņi amrtam SRÃVAYA svāhā for wine. The quantity of cannabis to be consumed is not nominal. The Ānandapatala cited in Sarvollāsa 30.61 requires the worshipper to use from one to three tolakas in weight, no less, no more. As can be seen from the citation above from the Syãmãpaddhati of Sāhib Kaul, the worshipper could use either substance. But the East-Indian tradition is in no doubt that cannabis is superior. This is stated in a verse-line frequently encountered in its texts: samvidãsavayor madhye samvid eva garîyasî 'Of cannabis and wine it is cannabis that is greater'; see, e.g., Sarvollāsa 30.26cd and 60ab ( Mātrkābhedatantra and Ānandapatala) and Samayäcäratantra f. 30r9 (samvidãnandayor madhye samvid eva garlyasi). The Kashmirian Bhattārakasvāmin, author of the Spandapradīpikā , an unpublished commentary on the Spandakārikā of the ninth-century Kashmirian non-dualist Śaiva Kallata, speaks for the old tradition against this new Sāktism, dismissing its claim that cannabis enhances spiritual awareness. In f. 3 v 11 - 13 we read: tasmāt sarvatra vyãpteh spanda eva</page><page sequence="18">366 Alexis SANDERSON It is this Maithila tradition that is the probable source of the East-Indian elements that have intruded into some redactions of the Kashmirians' Saiva Paddhatis. I have mentioned only the addition of East-Indian goddesses; but there are other features that support this conclusion. The Paris Agnikãryapaddhati includes a sub-Paddhati for an animal sacrifice to the Goddess which is a variant of those seen in Sāhib Kaul's manuals;44 and there are visualization-texts ( dhyãnam ) recited in the worship of the same redaction that are identical with those used in these Paddhatis. That for Ganeśa, for example, is found in the Syãmãpaddhati , and it is also found in the principal Bengali Sākta treatise of the sixteenth century, the Tanirasãra of Krsņānanda Bhattãcârya. 45 The Newars Syncretistic elaboration also characterizes the anonymous manuals for the worship of the royal temple deities written and followed by the Newar Saiva priests of the Kath- mandu valley. We see this in the many surviving Nepalese manuscripts of Paddhatis that give the recitation-texts in Sanskrit and the ritual instructions in Newari for ceremonies of installation (pratistha) by named royal patrons, or set out the same for the thā pūjā, puchā, and dhavamchã , the periodic rituals that must be performed by these priests in the palace temples.46 In these the principal deities are Kubjikā with her consort Navātmanātha, kāraņam mahesvaro nāma. yac cātikruddho prahrsto vā kim karomīti vāmrsan / dhāvan vā yat padam gacchet tatra spandah pratisthitah ityãdinã srîspandavyaktir atraiva dar'sitā tat prāmādikam. vijayãpãnaratãnãm bodhanimajjanād iy am ittham uktih 4 So the dynamism [of consciousness] alone is the cause, namely Śiva, because it pervades all [states]. As for the view that the manifesting of this sacred dynamism can occur only in the states mentioned in such verses as "The dynamism is present in the state one enters when one is in great anger or delight, wondering desperately what to do or running" [Spandakārikā 1 .22], that is erroneous. This is what those who are given to drinking vijayã say, because [by consuming it] they diminish their awareness'. For the contrary belief, that cannabis promotes understanding, see passages such as Sarvollãsa 30.32-33, 55. It is probable that the use of cannabis for spiritual intoxication was adopted following the example of Muslim ascetics in India such as those of the Madãriyya order, founded by Badi4 ad-din Shāh Madari, an immigrant who settled in Jaunpur, where he died c. 1440 (Trimingham 1973, 97), an order notorious for its use of hashish. 44. Agnikãryapaddhati A, ff. 41v-44v. Cf. Šrīvidyānityapūjāpaddhati , ff. 122v-124r; Syãmã- paddhati, ff. 37r8-38r5; Hrllekhāpaddhati , ff. 70v4~74v8. 45. Agnikãryapaddhati A, f. 45r8; = Syãmãpaddhati , f. 6v4-6; = Krsņānanda, Tantrasãra f. 97r2-5. The Tantrasãra of Krsņānanda was certainly studied in some circles in Kashmir, since several Kashmirian manuscripts of it have survived, such as BHU Mss. c. 1028 and c. 3657; Research Department, Srinagar, MSS 1479 and 1637. A number of the visualization verses of the Paris Agnikãryapaddhati (A) are found in the published Uddhārakosa associated with the Devîrahasya. That of Tārā (f. 80r5-v4) = 7.1 1-12; that of Bhuvanesvari (f. 80v5-81r3) = 7.14-15; that of VajrayoginI (f. 84v3) = 7.49; that of Kulavāgīsvari (f. 65r) = 7. 62; that of Mrtyuñjaya (f. 47r) = 7. 71-72. The Devîrahasya is East-Indian in character but it has assimilated the local Kashmirian goddesses. In 2.2-6b it lists the Mantras of Šārikā, Mahārājnī, Jvālāmukhī, Šāradā and Bhedā. The locations of the first three have been stated above. Šāradā, a goddess of transregional fame, was worshipped to the north of the valley at Shardi by the Kishenganga river (Stein 1961, 2:279-289). Bhedā/Bhīdā was worshipped on a mountain in the Śukru Pargaņa. See the Kasmīratīrthasarņgraha of Sāhib Rām, f. 2 1 r 1 -2 : sukrarosarãstre parvatamastake bhīdādevī. Cf. Stein 1961, 2:472-3. 46. The Newari term thāpūjā/thāpūjā denotes a special ceremony of worship (pūjā) that is to be performed on one or more calendrically fixed days of every year in accordance with the requirements of an endowment for this purpose.

Each of these four is an independent pan- Indian Saiva deity with her own ritual system; 48 and for each there survive Paddhatis for personal worship. But here their cults are combined to form a larger structure. This in turn subsumes certain other deities of special significance to the palace, such as the Durgās Tumbesvari, Ugracaņdā and Mānesvarī, and, in certain contexts, the aniconic goddess Duyinimäju/Dumäju. It is also the basis of Paddhatis for the worship of yet other deities. 49 I propose that this came about in response to the accumulation of the goddesses of successive dynasties, that when a new dynasty came to power the palace priests integrated its goddess with those already in worship in the royal temples, creating a composite Paddhati for this purpose. The evidence for this falls far short of enabling a chronology but it does support the hypothesis of the historical process. The worship of the four goddesses is divided in the Paddhatis into two segments called the pascimadegulipūjā and the uttaradegulipūjā. The meaning of these Newari terms is 'worship of the western tutelary deities' and 'worship of the northern tutelary deities'. Now Kubjikā is worshipped in the first and SiddhilaksmI, Guhyakall and Tripurasundari in the second. The sense of the reference to the cardinal points is that in the classification of Sākta systems that was current among the Newars and elsewhere in the subcontinent Kubjikā is the goddess of the Western Transmission ( pascimãmnãyah , pascimãnvayah ), while SiddhilaksmI and Guhyakall are the goddesses of the Northern Transmission ( uttarãmnãyah , uttarãnvayah). When the worship of Tripurasundari is classified within this schema it is generally in late texts of its own tradition that seek to present it as the culmination of all the others and so classify it as the Transmission of the Zenith ( úrdhvãmnãyah ), though an earlier tradition seen in the Ciiïcinîmatasârasamuccaya, a secondary, syncretistic scripture of the Western Transmission, had classified the cult of the Nityâs, a system that prefigures the classical, as that of the Southern Transmission. 50 Here it is tagged on, as it were, without a separate mūriparimitaksetram sakusodakam samkalpya samarpitam asti 'Land within the capital Kāntipura [= Kathmandu] measuring 536 Mūris has been given with the formula of intent and with kuśa grass and water to enable a thāpūjā to be performed with all necessary materials, as specified in the document that records the donation, every year on the 8th days of the dark fortnights of the months Bhādrapada, Māgha and Phālguņa'; and no. 80, concerning the same temple, recording a land-grant to fund two annual thāpūjā , on the 8th of the bright fortnight of Bhādrapada and the 5th of the same of Āsvina. This provides textual confirmation of the account of this kind of pūjā given by Vergati (1995, 115-1 16) on the basis of anthropological enquiry in Bhaktapur as periodic acts of pūjā established by the Malla kings with donations of land to pay for them. The puchā (Skt. pavitrārohaņam) is the annual expiatory offering of threads to the deities, and the dhavamchā (Skt. damanārohaņam) is the annual expiatory offering of the parts of the fragrant-leafed Artemisia Indica plant (&lt; damanah , damanakah), though it appears from our lexicographers of Classical and Modern Newari that the plant offered by the Newars is camomile; see Tamot 2000, s.v. dhavamchā , dhavanasvāna and Manandhar 1986, s.v. dhavah , dhavahsvāā. 47.

The same</page><page sequence="20">368 Alexis Sanderson identity, as an annex of the 'worship of the northern tutelary deity' ( uttaradegulipūjā ), so as not to disrupt the balance of the established structure of the complementary co-existence of the western and northern traditions. 51 The proposal that these western and northern goddesses are worshipped side by side because those of one dynasty have been added to those of another is encouraged by remarks in the Parãtantra , a short scripture of 582 verses which gives every appearance of being a product of the Kathmandu valley. There are many manuscripts of it in that region and no evidence that it was known outside it. Furthermore, the system of goddess worship that it teaches is seen only in the Paddhatis of the Newars. It is primarily concerned with the deities of the Northern Transmission, their Mantras and worship, but it embeds this matter in a treatment of a larger artificial schema of six Transmissions, those of the four cardinal points, the zenith and the nadir. The deities assigned to the east and south are Pūrņesvari and Nisesvarī, goddesses that have no place in the Saiva tradition outside this context, appearing to my knowledge only here and in the Newars' Paddhatis. 52 It may well be that they were created artificially to fill these two positions in the schema and it is perhaps an indication of this that their cults are said by the Parãtantra to be current in the concentric continents (&lt; dvīpah ) beyond the oceans that surround the known world, Pūrņesvari in Plaksadvlpa and Kusadvlpa, and Nisesvarī in Šākadvīpa and Puskaradvlpa. 53 No such imagined geography is invoked in the treatments of the other goddesses of the transmissions, who are all deities of mainstream traditions that were well-established in Nepal and beyond. To the zenith ( úrdhvãmnãyah ) is assigned Tripurasundari, and to the nadir ( adha - ãmnãyah) the Buddhist Tantric goddess VajrayoginI, a deity that was of major importance in the Saiva-Buddhist culture of the Kathmandu valley, as the antiquity and popularity of her temple at Sankhu attest. 54 The text is explicit about her Buddhist identity and this is what justifies her position at the nadir. She is included because she was a major goddess system of deities is that of the scripture Nityākaula' see f. 2r7-2vl. The Cincinîmatasârasamuccaya refers to the systems assigned to the cardinal points as ãmnãyah , as in other sources; but it also calls them houses ( gharam ) and gharãmnãyah. Thus, f. 15r7: punar anyam pravaksyãmi ...caturnãm ghara-m- ãmnãyãm avatãram prthak prthak 'I shall teach you another matter ...the descent among men of the four Gharâmnâyas, each separately.' ghara-m-ãmnãyãm is for correct Sanskrit gharãmnãyãnãm. 5 1 .

On her cult in Nepal and its role in linking exoteric deities both Buddhist (Prajnāpāramitā) and Saiva (Durgā) with the deities of esoteric Buddhism see Zanen 1986 and Gellner 1992, 256. The local Nepãlamãhãtmya gives the Šaiva angle on the ambiguity of VajrayoginI by making her a form of Pārvatī, having Pārvatī favour the Buddha by appearing to him in that form (1.59): tapasyãm kurvatas tasya buddhasya girijã tadã / tus tā babhūva prakatā nāmnā sā vajrayoginî 'When the Buddha was engaged in asceticism Pārvatī was delighted and appeared to him under the name Vajrayoginť. The Parãtantra calls her Šābarī Prajnāpāramitā (6.1b: *sābarī [em. : sāvarī Cod. f. 15v6 : sāvali Ed.] jinamātrkā), which may mean 'the Prajnāpāramitā of [the Siddha] Šabara[pāda]' since Sabara was associated with the Sādhana of this goddess; see English 2002, 8, 360, 367-368.</page><page sequence="21">The Saiva Religion among the Khmers (Part I) 369 among the Newars both Buddhist and Saiva, but in the point of view of the latter her Buddhist background means that she can be acknowledged only in an inferior position, as able to bestow quick rewards in this life but not liberation. 55 The deities assigned to the west are Kubjikā and Navātmanātha and to the north SiddhilaksmI and Guhyakall, the first under her name Pratyańgira. 56 This is exactly as in the Paddhatis' arrangement of the complementary tutelaries, and while the assigning of Kubjikā and her consort to the west is not distinctively Newar, that of the combination of SiddhilaksmI and Guhyakall is. Moreover, the iconography of the deities of both transmissions given in the Parãtantra agrees with that seen both in the Newars' Paddhatis and in their religious art. 57 The Parãtantra , then, is almost certainly a product of the Newar community of the Kathmandu valley. It is therefore of great significance to the analysis of the Newars' bicentric Paddhatis that it associates the Western and Northern Transmissions that constitute those two centres with distinct royal lineages and that it does so in their case alone. It tells us that Kubjikā is the lineage goddess (kuladevi) of the kings that are descended from the Moon (Somavamsin) and that SiddhilaksmI (Pratyańgira) is the tutelary goddess ( istadevī ) of those who are descended from the Sun (Sûryavamsin). 58 55. Parãtantra 6. 1 d- 2a: kalau sīghraphalapradā / bauddhamārge 'bestowing quick results in the Buddhist religion during the Kaliyuga'; 6.6c-7b: saugatānugamā sãksãt kalau sīghraphalapradā / ihaiva phaladā nityam (corr. : nityã Ed.) nāpavargaphalapradā 'Followed by the devotees of the Buddha, quickly bestowing manifest results in the Kaliyuga, always bestowing results in this life but not granting the reward of liberation'. 56. In the sequence of Patalas 1 to 6, in which one Patala is devoted to each of the six goddesses of the transmissions, the goddess of the northern, the subject of Patala 4, is Guhyakall. But in the long seventh Patala, in which this transmission is singled out for further treatment, this identity expands to the pair SiddhilaksmI (Pratyańgira) and Guhyakall. 57. One of the rooms in the Art Museum in Bhaktapur contains scroll paintings on cloth (Skt. patah [- &gt; Tib. than ka] , Newari paubāhāā) of all these deities. On the left wall is a painting of a form of the white dancing Navātmanātha embracing the red Kubjikā and another which shows the three goddesses of the uttaradegulipūjā in a row: the red four-armed, one-faced Tripurasundari seated in the lotus-posture on a prostrate Sadāsiva, the black nine-faced, fifty-four-armed Guhyakall dancing on a prostrate Bhairava, and the ten-armed, five-faced white SiddhilaksmI seated on Rudra. On the far wall as one enters is a large and very finely executed painting of the white SiddhilaksmI in her cosmic form ( visvarūpā ), with eighteen fully depicted arms in the foreground and countless others in circuits behind and thirteen faces in the lowest of eight diminishing tiers. I claim no skill in such matters, but in style all three paintings appear to me to belong to a time before the eighteenth century. Elsewhere in the museum is a painting of Guhyakall with the goddess SiddhilaksmI in the upper left corner and Tripurasundari in the upper right. None of these images is correctly identified in the legends attached to their frames, a fact that underlines the esoteric nature of such knowledge: the educated public of Bhaktapur is generally unable to identify such deities. 58.

The first is that of the Licchavis, known to us from dated inscriptions from A.D. 456/7 (Mānadeva) to 733 (Jayadeva). The second is that of the Mallas, who ruled from 1200 until they were conquered in the second half of the seventeenth century by Pithivlnarayan Śah, the first king of the non-Newar dynasty that has occupied the throne of Nepal down to the present. 59 The solar kings in the mind of the redactor of the Parãtantra were no doubt these Mallas, since the text contains several indications that it is unlikely to have been written before the fifteenth century.60 That SiddhilaksmI was their tutelary goddess is supported by other evidence. King Jitāmitramalla (r. 1673-1696) of Bhaktapur composed an esoteric hymn to her, the Siddhilaksmimantrayantroddhãrãdistotra ,61 in which he presents the goddess in terms that accord well with this hypothesis. When he explains how to form her Mantra for the purpose of repeated recitation (japah ) he identifies the reciter as the king, 62 a restriction I have seen in no other Paddhati. He also intends his hymn to be used by his descendants. For he tells us that by reciting it kings will achieve success (Siddhi), bringing about contentment among their ministers and destroying the lineages of are Rama's descendants,] as their personal goddess. It is tradition that all of them are her devotees'. The last two lines (60c-61b), containing her association with the solar kings, are lacking in the edition. 59. The Licchavis' claim to be kings of the lineage of the sun is made in Jayadeva's Paśupati inscription of Samvat 157 (a.D. 733), vv. 3-14 (Dh. Vajracãrya 1973, 548-550): 3 süryäd brahma- pautrãn manur atha bhagavãn janma lebhe tato bhūd iksvākus cakravartī nrpatir api tatah šrīvikuksir babhūva ...5 cd srímattuňgarathas tato daśarathah putraiś ca pautrais samam rāj ño stāv aparãn vihãya paratah srīmān abhūl licchavih ...7cd sãrdham bhūpatibhis tribhih ksitibhrtãm tyaktvãntare vinsatim khyãtah srijayadevanãmanrpatih prādurbabhūvāparah .... It is made for the Mallas in the epithets that precede their names in all their inscriptions and in many manuscript colophons that mention a Malla as the reigning king. 60. It names the East-Indian Mahävidyä goddesses Daksiņakālī, Ugratārā, Chinnamastā, Bagalāmukhī and NīlasarasvatI in its coverage of the Southern Transmission (1.18d-20a). It also speaks of the cult of Tripurasundan as having two forms, one following the counter-brahmanical practice (vãmãcãrah) and the other the brahmanical ( daksiņācārah ), and identifies the latter as that of the Sannyâsins ( bhiksūņām ) (5.43ab: vãmadaksinayãgena sundarī dvividhã matā and 5.44cd: daksinãcãrayãgena bhiksūņām parama smrtā). This expurgated form of the worship of Tripurasundarī is the hallmark of the tradition of the Sannyâsin Śańkaracaryas. The earliest evidence that the Sannyâsins of that tradition were receiving patronage in the Kathmandu valley is in the reign of Ratnamalla (c. 1484- 1530); see Michaels 1994, 116 ff. See also the copper-plate inscription of 1635/6 from the Jagannātha temple in the Hanumān Dhokā palace square in Kathmandu (G. Vajracãrya 1976, no. 10), which names a number of Dasanâmasannyãsins of this order. 61.

Confirmation of her role as the personal deity of the Malla kings appears in the Paddhati for Navarātrapūjā in the autumnal royal festival of Dasain. For there Siddhilaksmī is identified unambiguously as Rājamantrabhattārikā-Siddhilaksmī 'Siddhilaksmī, the Goddess of the King's Mantra'. 64 The importance of this goddess to the kings of Nepal is underlined by evidence of her having been linked with Pasupatinātha, the premier Śiva of Nepal, venerated far beyond its borders and acknowledged as their patron by the kings of the realm from the time of Amsuvarman in the sixth century down to the present.65 For she is or has become the esoteric identity of Vatsalādevī, a goddess on the bank of the Bāgmatī river below the entrance to the temple of Pasupatinātha. The benedictory verse of a stele inscription of 1412/3 in the courtyard of that temple describes her as his consort,66 and this relationship is also enacted in her annual festival.67 The Nepalese chronicles ( Vamsāvalī) of the post- Malla period record a tradition that the eighth-century Licchavi king Śivadeva acknowledged this goddess as the principal deity of the realm, establishing an annual human sacrifice and a public car-procession in her honour, adding that when five generations later the king attempted to suppress these sacrifices he was prevented from doing so by divine intervention. 68 That Siddhilaksmī is or became the liturgical identity of this goddess is certain. Her processional image has not been observed in detail, but it has been seen to conform to the 63. F . 44r2: ādau gurum kalaya rāvām amum nrpānam siddhipradam vividhamantrisukhākaram ca' f. 44r4- 5: stotram caitan nrpānām ripukulaśamanam. 64. The context is the rites of the eighth day (Mahāstamī). After setting up and worshipping first the royal sword ( khadgasthãpanam ) and then two vessels for the kalašapūjā of Amrtesabhairava and the kumbhapūjā of Vāruņī, the priest is to do the worship of the paścimadeguli followed by that of the uttaradeguli. The Paddhati for the latter begins ( Navarātrapūjā , f. 5r6): srī 3 rājamantra- bhaUārikāsrīsiddhilaksmīdevārcanam kãrayet. siddhilaksmīdeguli yaya 'He should [now] perform the worship of Siddhilaksmī, the most sacred Goddess of the King's Mantra. He should do [the rite of] the tutelary Siddhilaksmī'; it ends (f. 5v5): thvate siddhilaksmīdeguli samãpta 'This [rite of] the tutelary Siddhilaksmī has been completed'. It is followed by those of Guhyakâlî (with the Mantras taught in the Parātantra) and Tripurasundari, with the addition of a pūjā to the goddess Kaumāri, associated with the worship of nine female children ( kumãrí) and two young boys that will take place the next morning (Mahānavamī). For a detailed account of the worship of these children (as personifications of Ugracaņdā, her eight subordinate goddesses, Ganeśa and Bhairava) performed by the king, or rather the brahmin priest who nowadays must take his place, the other priests of the Taleju temple, and the descendants of the Malla kings see Levy 1990, 540 ff. This addition of the pūjā of the goddess Kaumāri is an example of how while personal Śaiva worship is relatively free of syncretistic pressures, the liturgies of such royal priests must be adaptable in order to accomplish their engagement with the civic religion and its calendrical variety. 65. As soon as Amsuvarman began to publish edicts in his own name, after doing so in the name of his father-in-law Šivadeva, he assumed the epithet bhagavatpašupatibhattārakapādānugrhītah or bhagavatpasupatibhattãrakapãdãnudhyâtah 'favoured by the feet of the Revered Lord Paśupati'. The earliest of these edicts (Dh. Vajrãcârya 1973, no. 71) is dated in Samvat 29 of his era (= A.D. 595). 66.

This identification has been confirmed by the priests of her temple 69 and is placed beyond reasonable doubt by a visualization-text given for her worship in the Newari Paddhati literature. 70 That she should have two names, one esoteric and the other exoteric, is in no way surprising for a goddess such as this whose cult extends into the domain of the civic religion. The same is the case in Patan (Lalitapattana), which has the temple of a SiddhilaksmI known as Pūrņacaņdī71 who is worshipped there as their tutelary deity by a section of the Limbus and Rais calling themselves Kirantis, the name which the chronicles gave to the earliest rulers of the Kathmandu valley. 72 The kings of the lunar dynasty said by the Parãtantra to have had Kubjikā as their lineage goddess ( kuladevī) cannot be identified. But they were no doubt understood by the composer or redactor of this scripture to be the immediate predecessors of the Mallas ruling during the tenth to twelfth centuries, an earlier date being less likely in the light of what we know of the time during which the cult of Kubjikā was constituted and disseminated. Epigraphical evidence for Nepal during those centuries is extremely sparse and the accounts of the late local chronicles are unreliable. But although those sources are of limited value as sober history they at least reveal a model of dynastic alternation that is relevant to the present issue. For in their account a dynasty of five lunar kings was followed by the solar Licchavis; those were followed by a series of lunar kings that they call the Thākurīs; and these gave way in their turn to the solar Mallas. 73 Nepalese manuscripts of texts pertaining to the worship of Kubjikā, unlike those pertaining to the cults of SiddhilaksmI or Guhyakäll, do survive from the period before the Mallas. We have a Laghvikãmnãya manuscript of 1037/8 and at least four manuscripts of the Kubjikãmata extending from some time during the reign of the Pāla king Rāmapāla (c. 1072-1 126) to 1179. 74 69.

The dates given here for Rāmapāla's reign are those cogently argued by D.C. Sircar (1976). For the alternatives that have been proposed, from 1057 for its commencement to 1132 for its end, see Huntington 1984, 29-37, where these are conveniently tabulated. Who, then, is the mysterious goddess Taleju who has repeatedly been identified in the ethnographic literature and in the inscriptions as the tutelary deity ( svestadevatā ) of the Malla kings - see, e.g., G. Vajrãcãrya 1976, no. 28 recording a tulādānam by Cakravartlndramalla in 1664 A.D. 'for the pleasure of his istadevatā , the Mother Taleju': srīsrīsrīsvestadevatā-tarejumāju-prītina - and whose image, Mantra, and other esoteric aspects were concealed, we are told (e.g. Levy 1990, 239-240), from all but the royal priests, the king and his male relatives? The Paddhatis for the worship of Taleju, in which one would expect to find a simple answer to this question, are puzzling at first sight, because they</page><page sequence="25">The Saiva Religion among the Khmers (Part I) 373 Bali Nor was eclectic syncretism limited to the Paddhatis of the subcontinent. It is also apparent in those of the Saiva brahmin priests (pědanda siwa) of Bali and Lombok, inheritors of the traditions of pre-Islamic East Java. The Saivism of those texts is a form of the Saiddhāntika division of the Saiva Mantramārga, 75 but it contains elements of other traditions. Thus in the Âdityahrdayastava the deity, Siva as the Sun (, sivãdityah ), is equated with Tumburu, the presiding deity of the Vamasrotas of the Saiva Mantramārga, accompanied "by Jaya and the others", that is to say, by his four sisters Jayâ, Vijayâ, Jayantl/Ajita and Aparājitā. 76 Similarly, Khadgarāvaņa appears in the Balinese Šaiva do not mention her outside their titles, consisting of the worship of the sequence of the deities of the pascimadegulipūjā and the uttaradegulipūjā. I propose, therefore, that there is no Taleju over and above these deities and that she is either Kubjikā or SiddhilaksmI, or both. If she is one of them to the exclusion of the other then Kubjikā is the most likely candidate. She and Navātmanātha stand at the head of the liturgies. Moreover, there is a shrine of Wanelâykû Taleju in the Tachapāl ward of Bhaktapur (Slusser 1982, 320a) which is surely the Pascimamūlasthānabhattārikā ('the western goddess of the primary/ original site') of Vanerājakule mentioned among the deities of this ward in the liturgy of the Pratyaňgirapaddhati , f. 29r-v: gaņesa tavacapāla. mantra pūrvavat. bal im. vanerājakule. mantra.

The term mūlasthānam in these Mantras is used elsewhere in Śaiva texts to mean the site of the primary or original installation of the deity of a temple. This fits the theory that Kubjikā is the earliest of the two principal royal goddesses and/or the main deity of the Taleju temples. For the latter sense one may compare such terms as múlãcãrya for the chief priest of the temple. On the other hand we have seen that SiddhilaksmI is known as the Goddess of the King's Mantra and this strongly suggests that the name Taleju was also applied to her, because the secret Tantric knowledge of the king is identified as that of Taleju in the narrative literature. Furthermore, the Parãtantra speaks of the 290-syllable Vidyâ of Pratyańgira (SiddhilaksmI) as having come down through a line of transmission in an account (7.48-59) that strongly resembles the legend of the transmission of Taleju's Yantra written by a brahmin of Bhaktapur who works as a public storyteller summarized by Levy (1990: 234-241). As with the Yantra of Taleju, the Pratyańgira is acquired by Rāvaņa, the demon king of Lanka (7.50). Later it is given to Rāma on the banks of the Sarayü river so that he can use it to defeat Rāvaņa (7.53c-54 reading dasonā trisatāksarī with the manuscript in 54d) but the Mantra so far revealed is defective, having 300 syllables in its perfect state. In the modern storyteller's narrative Rāma acquires Taleju's Yantra by defeating Rāvaņa and takes it to Ayodhyä. The goddess instructs him in a dream to throw it into the river Sarayü, which flows past Ayodhyä, because its worship would be defective after his death. Here the narratives part company, the Newari legend introducing the solar king Nänyadeva, who is said to have rescued it from the river, and his descendant Harisimhadeva who is said to have brought it to Bhaktapur, whose Taleju temple is believed to be the first in the valley. But this 'history' from the time of Nänyadeva and Harisimhadeva, both Maithila kings known from inscriptions, could not have been included in the Parãtantra , because its presence would have contradicted its claim to scriptural status by showing that its composer postdated figures of relatively recent times. Further, the same text distinguishes, as we have seen, between Kubjikā as a lineage goddess ( kuladevi ) and SiddhilaksmI as a tutelary or chosen goddess ( istadevī ); and Taleju is referred to in the inscriptions as the istadevī of the Malla kings. It is probable, then, that the name Taleju was applied to both goddesses and either, according to context. But further research into the Paddhatis mav shed clearer lieht on this issue ✓ "ü 75.

These are put into correspondence with the constituents of the human body in a Balinese priest's detailed comment on the Śaiva Paddhati presented by Hooykaas. 79 That they are the hallmark of the Rsi denomination is clear from the Old Javanese Kunjarakarņa , since that teaches that the pancakuśika are to the Rsi sect what the five Tathāgatas are to the Mahäyäna Buddhists and the five deities to the Śaivas 80 setting out the correspondences between sets of five in the three denominations (tripaksa) as follows: (1) Mahakuśika/Kusika = Aksobhya = Rudra; (2) Gārga/Garga = Ratnasambhava = Brahmā; (3) Maitri/Metri = Amitābha = Mahesvara; (4) Kurusya = Amoghasiddhi = Visņu; and (5) Patañjala/Pratañjala = Vairocana = Siva. 81 The first four are known from Indian sources as the disciples of Śiva in his Lakullśa incarnation, and are remembered as the originators of the four teaching lineages (Gotras) syllable, his form accompanied by Jaya and the others [in the syllables] ksaň ksin ksen and ksun . In Javanese usage the "trisyllable" ( tryaksaram ) is the syllable OM (praņavah ), seen as comprising A, u and ma; see in the Sanskrit and Old Javanese JMnasiddhānta 26.1 led: a-u-ma tryaksaram samkhyam tryaksaram praņavam smrtam' also 8.9b: omkãram tryaksaram tyajet ; 16.6ab; 18.8cd; 26.1 Od.

But it seems hardly convincing as a name, which is what we require in this context; and we can have little faith in it when we see that the variant Prtañjala or Pratañjala is widely attested. 84 It is more probable that Patañjala is an attempt to substitute sense for a corrupt reading Prtañjala than that the latter is a corruption of the former. Perhaps what is concealed here is an ancient corruption of a name of Agastya. For the sage Agastya was widely worshipped in Java85 and he is famous in brahmanical mythology for having drunk all the waters of the ocean. Possibly, then, the original name was *PItañjala 'He who drank the waters'. 86 It might be urged against this hypothesis that the correspondences in the Kuñjarakarna show that this figure, whoever he was, was seen by the author of that text as the highest of the five, since he is equated there with Vairocana, the highest of the five Tathāgatas, and with Siva, the highest of the five deities of the Saivas, and that therefore we should expect rather a name for Lakullsa himself, since no-one else could reasonably be seen as their senior. But there is the alternative that the poet's correspondences are superficial and that Agastya or some other sage concealed behind the transmitted name has merely been added at the end of the established Pāsupata list to enhance his status in a Pāsupata environment. That this is so is strongly suggested by the position of the name and by the fact that the four that precede it are ordered with the seniormost in first position, since Kuśika was venerated by the Pāsupatas as the first of Lakullsa's disciples. 87 But whatever the origin of the fifth name the tradition is old. For the five sages are found in this form among the powers invoked as divine witnesses in the imprecation formulas of Old Javanese charters from 860 onwards. 88 They also appear in the cosmogony of the pürwabhümi prayer in the Saiva liturgy of the priests of the Tengger in 82. In the original Skandapurāņa , ed. Bhattarāī, 167.127-143 these four are Kauśika, Gãrgya, Mitra and Kaurusya. In Lihgapurāņa 1.131 they are Kuśika, Garga, Mitra and Kaurusya. In the Cintra Praśasti of A.D. 1287 from Somnāthpattan/Prabhāsa (El 1 :32, v. 16-1 7b) they are Kuśika, Gãrgya, Maitreya and Kaurusa. 83.

This tentative hypothesis supposes an irregular compound without reduction of the first member to its stem form (an aluk samāsah) (= pītam jalam yena sa *pītanjalah). For the myth of his drinking up the waters see, e.g., verses in the Kumbhakonam edition after Mahābhārata 12.202.11: agastyo 'sau mahātejāh pātu taj jalam anjasā / tatheti coktvā te devā munim ūcur mudānvitāh / trãyasva lokān viprarse jalam etat ksayam naya / tatheti coktvā bhagavãn kãlãnalasamadyutih / dhyãyan jalãdanivaham sa ksaņena papau jalam 4 "Let that radiant [sage] Agastya quickly drink that water". Having agreed those gods were delighted and said to the sage: "Save the people, O brahmin sage; get rid of this water". The Venerable [Agastya], who was as radiant as the fire of the aeon, agreed, and meditating on the mass of the water-devouring [*Vādava fire?] drank the water in an instant.' This hypothesis would be less tentative if this epithet were found in place of the name Agastya in some Sanskrit source. I do not know of an instance.

There it is said that there first arose the goddess Umā (Umo Betari, = Skt. Umābhattārikā) and then these five 'gods' {dewoto, Skt. devata). 89 Now in this prayer the officiant is identified as a resi pujangga , which if we may judge by the use of this Old Javanese term (rsi bhujangga) in Balinese religion, denotes members of a class of non-brahmin, commoner priests with lower status and function than the brahmin priests of Siva {pědanda siwa ) but serving 93 per cent of the population. In Bali the rsi bhujangga are members of the title-group sengguhu , which the brahmins rank as elevated Sūdra. 90 The element rěsi/rsi and the special position assigned to the five sages in this pürwabhümi text, which has its close parallel in the liturgies of the Balinese resi bujangga, 9X suggests that these priests too have their origin in the Rsi sect. Its establishments appear from Old Javanese sources to have been located in isolated areas, of which the Tengger highlands above the court centres of Singhasari and Kadiri, are an outstanding example; and it appears that their beliefs and practice became closely entwined with popular religion,92 as is the case with the rěsi bujangga of the Tengger and Balinese. Considering the centrality of the founders of the Pāncārthika Pāsupata lineages in their cosmogony text and the role of these sages in the imprecations of Old Javanese charters from the earliest period onwards, I offer the hypothesis that these non-brahmin priests inherit what remains of the earliest Saivism in Java, that this derives from the Atimārgic (Pāsupata) phase of the religion, that the Mantramārgic Siddhānta was introduced into Java at a later date, as it was, as we shall see, in Kambujadeśa, and that once this new tradition had been adopted by the courts and their brahmin officiants, the older system subsisted in a subordinate position among non-brahmin officiants, who survived in two roles. In the first, perhaps restricted to the courts and the core areas around them, they would have co-operated with brahmin priests as assistants and in that context been restricted to such functions as the invocation of lesser powers, as is the case among the Balinese resi bujangga in the nyepi, the annual day of silence, in which the brahmin pědanda siwa make offerings to the high gods while at their side the resi bujangga make offerings to the demons, so protecting the island from their assaults during the coming year. 93 In the second they served in their own right as the priests of the majority of the population, as in Bali, or in remote rural areas such as the Tengger highlands as the only priests, where their survival reveals that though Saivism may have flourished among the social elites in and around the court centres it had also established itself among the rural population, where it survived, as we can see in the pürwabhümi liturgy with a core element of an older Pāsupata or Pāsupata-influenced tradition, one that was influential enough in Java to survive also in the exegesis of the high-status liturgy of the pědanda siwa , albeit in an abstract schema in which it no longer has the exalted position originally assigned to it. 94 89.

Zoetmulder reports that in Old Javanese (1982, s.v.) the Sanskrit term bhujahga is used for a brahmin or other person of clerical rank and notes that in the older texts "it often appears to be a younger brahman (student or disciple)". Perhaps, then, it refers in the case of the term rsi bhujangga to the subordinate status of these priests. For the distinction between Atimārgic and Mantramārgic forms of Šaivism see Sanderson 1988.</page><page sequence="29">The Saiva Religion among the Khmers (Part I) 377 Thus while the liturgy of the Balinese is predominantly Saiddhāntika Saiva it shows elements of the non-Saiddhāntika Mantramārgic traditions of the Vāmasrotas and Paścimasrotas and also of the archaic Atimārga. But the religious culture of the Javanese court of Majapahit, whose traditions the Balinese have inherited, was a Saiva-Buddhist coalition; and so we find that Buddhism too has been drawn into the redaction of the liturgy. For the last two of the eight goddesses of the eight fingers in the preliminary ritual of the cleansing of the hands (karaśuddhi) are PrajñadevI and Parimitādevī. 95 These are surely created out of the Buddhists' goddess Prajnāpārimitā as Praj nāpārami tā is known in later Old Javanese sources. 96 The other six are personifications of the four unlimited virtues or Brahmavihāras of Buddhism ( upeksā , karuņā , muditã , maitrí) but with Šāntā taking the place of the fourth, together with the two brahmanical goddesses LaksmT and Sarasvatī. We see, then, that Saiva priests paid scant attention to the rule that a Paddhati must adhere closely to a single scriptural source. Pure Paddhatis of this kind were believed to exist for the personal worship of initiates, but when we look closely even they show admixture from disparate ritual systems. In the case of worship conducted by professional priests - and it is this class of ritualist that figures in the Khmer inscriptions - we find that the needs and expectations of their clients have lead to thoroughly syncretistic developments in three independent cultural contexts. It would be unreasonable, therefore, to assume that Kambujadeśa was exceptional in this regard. Indigenous Religion A further limitation is imposed by the character of our evidence. Unlike Christianity and Islam, which would claim half the population of Southeast Asia during the age of commercial expansion in the fifteenth to seventeenth centuries, the religions of India that flourished in the region before this period demanded no radical rejection of existing cults. As the new religions were assimilated by the Khmers they were no doubt added to traditions of the kind we see today in the propitiation and mediation of the local Khmer spirits known as the neak ta , accommodating them through subordination in a manner similar to that seen with the nat and phi cults of Theravādin Burma and Thailand. 97 But the sources at our disposal do not allow us to see this substrate, reflecting as they do only the Indie high culture patronized by the ruling elite. There are a few deities mentioned that may be pre-Indic. We have, for example, deities identified only by the pre-Angkorean title Kpoñ Kamratān Añ 'My Venerable Lord/Lady' and no name;98 and there are a few more that are identified only by association, such as vrah kammratān añ tnal 'the god of the road' (K. 910), vrah kammratãn añ kammratān tem krom (K. 137, K. 600) 'the god of the Krom tree',99 vrah kamratān tńaiy lue 'the god of the west' (K. 22), and vrah kammratān ai travaň ver 'the god of the double pond' (K. 22). Another, kpoñ kammratān añ bha nãriyya (K. 107), has a non-Sanskrit name, and yet another, kpoñ kammratãn añ srī Senãmukhavijayã (K. 904 of 95. See Hooykaas 1966, 50. 96.

Such names have been thought to be firm evidence of pre-Indic cults. 100 But there are reasons to be cautious, over and above the obvious consideration that the argument rests on negative evidence, namely that certain deities are not identified in a way that enables us to say that they are certainly Indie. For another nameless Kpoñ Kammratān An appears in the Khmer portion of K. 79 of 644; but in the Sanskrit portion she is identified as 'the goddess Caturbhujā (the four-armed)', which is very probably a reference to an Indie image. The probability that this is a Khmer deity is further diminished by the context in which she is mentioned. The inscription, which records its installation, states that it was commissioned by a Šaiva ascetic (yamî ), that is to say by one of those least likely to be involved in the cult of a pre-Indic deity. Furthermore we are told that he was motivated to undertake this meritorious action by his devotion to Siva and that the procedures adopted were those appropriate to the Goddess. All this suggests that the image was that of Siva's consort. 101 Caution is also prompted by the case of the kammrateň jagat pin thmo 'the god of the stone pond' of K. 653 of 956, who is surely identical with the deity who appears synonymously in Sanskrit as Asmasaronātha and Šilāsaronātha in K. 56, an undated inscription of the reign of Rājendravarman (944-c. 968). This and the cases cited above have been considered "perfect examples of Sanskrit names devised as translations of Khmer cult terminology'; 102 but the evidence is far from compelling. While recording the many pious acts of a Vaisņava dignitary related to the chief queen of Rājendravarman, the inscription tells us that he reinstalled the Visņu in the temple of the Lord of the Stone Pond (Asmasaronātha): yah kulapāvanīh catasras srīpater arccā janmabhūmāv atisthipat vaisņavīm pratimãm asmasaronãthasya sadmani bhüyo bhūrivibhām bhīmapure kãtyãyamtanum K. 56 B, v. 1 7b- 1 8 ...who installed four images of Visņu in the place of his birth to purify his family, reinstalled the image of Visņu in the temple of the Lord of the Stone Pond brightly shining, and installed an image of Durgā in Bhīmapura, ... If the Lord of the Stone Pond were a pre-Indic deity this would mean that a Visņu was present as a subsidiary in his temple, a striking result, since the character of the inscriptions and the material evidence would lead us to expect that if a pre-Indic deity persisted it would have been an ancillary rather than the principal deity of a temple. But I see nothing that compels this interpretation against the alternative that the Lord of the Stone Pond was actually a Visņu and that it was his own image that was being reinstalled.

It is highly probable, then, that the Lord of the Stone Pond and the Visņu of the Stone Pond are one and the same. To defend the hypothesis that the Lord is a distinct, pre-Indic deity we have to accept three entities in place of one with metrically variant names: a pre- Indic Lord of the Stone Pond with his own temple, a Visņu within that temple, and a separate temple of a Visņu of the Stone Pond; and we would have to be constrained to do so by firmer evidence than the claim that the Khmer version of the name in K. 653 looks like pre-Indic cult terminology. The fact is that we have no clear evidence of such terminology but only the probability that when the Khmers started to give Indie deities Khmer titles they would have drawn on pre-Indic conventions. Even if the inscriptions do refer to non-Indic deities, they tell us nothing about them other than their names. Nor is it certain that this lack of information prevents us from seeing the religious life of the rural masses alone, those on whose observances it is likely that the imported Indian religions had the least impact. For we cannot be sure that the old practices did not continue even among the Indianized elite, since absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. Conversely we cannot know how far the Indie religions had penetrated beyond the culture of the court, though the evidence of Java and that of the very large numbers of Khmers involved in various capacities in the support of these traditions strongly suggest that they must have put down roots in the minds and practices of the wider population. It is even more unlikely that the reticence of our sources concerning the pre-Indic traditions merely deprives us of knowledge of those traditions themselves. It is almost certain that it also diminishes and distorts our understanding of the imported religions. For if our sources allowed us to see Khmer religion and society in the round we would no doubt recognize that Indian forms clothed Khmer beliefs and practices or embedded them as subsidiaries, as we see wherever Indian religions have been assimilated, both in India itself and beyond it from Burma to Bali, and from Tibet to Japan. 104 It is in any case implausible that even purely Indian rituals would not have taken on a Khmer character when performed by Khmers for Khmers, just as their images of Indian deities have a distinctive style and aesthetic quality while remaining within the parameters of an imported iconography. 104. Vickery argues (1998, 142) that the popularity of Durgā Mahisāsuramardinī in 7th-century Khmer art should not be seen simply as a borrowing of a cult popular in southern India but "must be explained, if possible, in terms of a local socio-religious setting." Rightly insisting that comparative Southeast-Asian ethnography may be more important than Indian prototypes, he adds in a footnote that buffalo sacrifices presided over by female shamans are still known in northern Thailand, citing a report in the Bangkok Post of 2 July, 1986, thereby suggesting that the cult of Durgā Slayer of the Buffalo Titan (Mahisāsuramardinī) was an Indie veneer over an indigenous tradition. Perhaps it was. But he cites no evidence that the Khmers sacrificed buffaloes to Durgā, and, more crucially, no evidence that they did so in a manner that was Khmer rather than Indian.</page><page sequence="32">380 Alexis SANDERSON Khmer Subsidiary Brahmanism Also present among the Khmers was the Brahmanism of Śruti and Smrti. Brahmin dignitaries who officiated for the Khmer monarchs are commended for their knowledge of the Vedas, their ancillaries ( vedāngāh ), the Upanisads, the Epics and the Purāņas; 105 and Rājendravarman (r. 944 -c. 968) is credited with repeatedly causing the gods to drink Soma, which is a claim that he had Soma sacrifices performed. If this is not empty praise, it entails the existence of a community of orthodox brahmins versed in the Vedas and Śrauta ritual, since no Soma sacrifice can be performed with less than sixteen such persons as officiants (rtvik ). 106 This king is also said to have studied the exegesis (mīmāmsā) of the Vedas from a brahmin Somesvarabhatta and then to have taught it to 105.

In a clear allusion to this brahmanical ceremony Rājendravarman is described as being "consecrated every Pusya by a stream of nectar poured from one hundred golden vases". 118 Our Indian sources reveal that the stream of nectar to which the inscription refers was melted butter. The king is to be covered with a blanket and then this butter is to be poured over him from eight, twenty-eight or one hundred and eight vases. The blanket (ghrtakambalam) is then removed and he is bathed with the waters of the 'Pusya bath' ( pusyasnãnãmbubhih ). 119 Then there are the recurrent royal fire-sacrifices of one hundred thousand oblations (Laksahoma) and ten million oblations (Kotihoma): 120 115.

A Newari document listing various rituals and the dates of their performance records two Kotihomas for king Bhūpālendramalla of the independent kingdom of Kathmandu in 1693/4 and 1703/4 and tells us that the first lasted from the 6th of the dark half of Pausa to the 7th of the light half of Phālguna and the other from the 10th of the light half of Māgha to the 10th of the dark half of Phālguna, which is to say for forty-six and forty-five days respectively. 122 This means that the Homas must have proceeded at a rate of over 200,000 oblations ( ãhutih ) a day with numerous priests working simultaneously, each at his own fire. According to another Nepalese source, the Laksakotihomaprayoga , one should engage 4, 8 or 1 0 priests ( rtvik ) for a Laksahoma and 16, 20, 24, 64 or 100 for a Kotihoma. This makes the frequent references in the Khmer Sanskrit inscriptions to their kings blocking out the light of the sun with the smoke of their countless sacrifices seem less like poetic exaggeration. 123 Of the two annual Yajña ceremonies mentioned after the great Homas in the passage just cited, that whose name survives intact, the Pitryajña, is the annual Šrāddha ceremony, (em. : sammantryam Ed.) ca [pujrohitaih 'After consulting his domestic priests he should take care to do two Laksahomas and one Kotihoma that bestows freedom from all dangers every year following the procedures of the Atharvaveda'; Nīlamata 813: samvatsarasyãtha kãryau laksahomau (conj. : kãryo laksahomo Ed.) mahīksitā / kotihomas tathã kãry a eka eva dvijottama / tayor vidhānam vijñeyam kalpesv ãtharvanesu ca The king, O best of brahmins, should do two Laksahomas and one Kotihoma in the course of the year.

Nepalese materials show that Saiva and Sākta forms of these homas were developed, the brahmanical rituals being performed with non-Vedic mantras. One may ask, therefore, whether this may not also have been so among the Khmers. I think it was not.

As for the other annual Yajña, whose name has been lost through damage, I propose that it was the Brahmayajña 'the offering to Brahmā'. It has long been assumed that this Yajña, which is mentioned several times in the inscriptions, 124 is that which is taught under this name as one of the five basic daily obligations (pañca yajñah) of the twice-born in mainstream brahmanical texts: that is to say the figurative sacrifice (yajñah ) that is the daily recitation of a portion of the Vedas and other religious texts, otherwise called svãdhyãyah . This practice was certainly followed by Khmer brahmins. For example, we are told in an inscription of the reign of Sûryavarman I (1002-1050), that the ceremonial capital (puram ) was loud with the sound of brahmins engaged in this daily chanting; 125 and one of the contexts in which the Brahmayajña is mentioned in the Khmer inscriptions does associate it with sacred knowledge, since we find it there as an event that marks the beginning or end of the period of study with a Guru. But I propose that it is a proper sacrificial ceremony that is intended, a yajñah in the literal sense. This conclusion is suggested by its occurrence in another context, in which it is paired with the mãtryajna 'the sacrifice to the Mothers' as a preliminary rite performed on the site on which a Linga is about to be installed: vrah kamsteň añ srī laksmīpativarmma thve vrahmayajña mãtryajna ta gi bhūmi noh nu pan-lyań suvarnnaliňga ta vrah sureń pi vrah kamsteň añ kanlah vnam mok samayajña sanme ni pi jamnum mahãpanditta phoň ta damnepra vrah kamrateň añ srī vidyãdhipandita gi ta guru ni ta vrahmayajña vrah kamrateň añ bhimapura ta thve mãtryajna vrah kamrateň añ vlok ta panlyaň suvarnnaliňga.

V.Ka.A. Kanlah Vnam came [there]. Men learned in the proper times [for rites] (samayajña) agreed (sanme) to make the offerings together (ni pi jamnum ), great scholars beginning with V.K.A. Sri Vidyãdhipandita, the Guru for the Brahmayajña. V.K.A. Bhimapura celebrated the Mãtryajna. V.K.A. Vlok [was the guru for] the installation of the golden Lińga.' 126 124.

Pou takes mok and samayajña sanme ni pi jamnum mahãpanditta phoň ta damnepra ... together and translates as follows (with my interpretation of her parsing in parentheses): 'vint (mok) se joindre à ses sacrifices (samayajña) où furent assemblés (sanme) de grands savants, en premier ... (mahãpanditta phon ta damnepra )'. I have rejected this interpretation because her translation of samayajña 'to join in a sacrifice' creates an implausible hapax and renders sanme ni pi jamnum 'agreed to make the offerings together' pleonastic. She avoids that problem by translating only sanme ('où furent assemblés'). I have preferred to take samayajña as Sanskrit samaya-jña-. This occurs frequently in religious contexts in the meaning 'one who knows the proper occasion'. See, e.g., Mahãbhãrata 4.27. 6ab: samayam samayajñas te pãlayantah sucivratāh. It also occurs in both Šaiva and Bhāgavata texts meaning 'one who knows the rules of the initiated', in the special sense of one who has received the first grade of initiation. This is probably not what is intended here, since these officiants would have had to have been fully initiated and consecrated, though one cannot exclude the possibility that the term was also applied to initiates in general.</page><page sequence="37">The Saiva Religion among the Khmers (Part I) 385 and it is confirmed, I propose, in a Sanskrit verse cited immediately after the lacunose Old Khmer text that lists these ritual duties. For we learn that the royal preceptor (Vrah Guru) was invited to perform them "every year in accordance with [the following] Śloka [composed] by Our Lord Sûryavarmadeva [himself]" (sap samvatsara gi roh vrah śloka vrah pāda kamrateň añ srīsū ryya varmmadeva): - d guror hutavahe havir ãhutiryat samyag vidher vividhãvrstibhavam praśasyam sasyãya tad vidhividhãv iha kotihome kotir hutis suvidhivat kurute grasiddhyai K. 383, v. 2 (A 11. 35-36) The verse is problematic. It is not just that its first two syllables have been lost. It is also that its meaning is obscured by grammatical incoherence and syntactic ambiguity. It is clear, however, that the verse refers to the benefits of three kinds of fire-sacrifice, which the context requires to be among those listed as the Vrah Guru's duties. The third is the Kotihoma. The first is conveyed in the relative clause and the second in the correlative clause that follows it, ending sasyãya tad vidhividhau. The crucial word there is vidhividhau. CŒDÈS and DUPONT took it to mean 'in a ritual ( vidhau ) [performed] in accordance with injunction ( vidhi-)' But that is implausibly stilted Sanskrit for this sense and the passage so interpreted fails to provide the name of a sacrifice. There is a simple solution, which provides natural Sanskrit and satisfies the requirement of the context. That is to take vidhividhau in the meaning 'in the ceremony (-vidhau) of Brahma', vidhih begin a commonly used name of that deity. 127 The second sacrifice, then, is the Brahmayajna. This supports the restoration vrah pitryajña vrah brahmayajna in the Khmer prose (K. 383: vrah pitryajña vrah -h + y aj ña), but it also demonstrates that the Brahmayajna was a literal rather than a figurative sacrifice. For though the Sanskrit is incorrect in composition or transcription, it is clear that the meaning intended is that the same offerings that are made into the fire in the first sacrifice bring about the various timely rains (vividhãvrstibhavam) 128 and so promote the grain harvest (sasyãya) in the second, that is to say, in the Brahmayajna. There is also Old Javanese evidence for such a Brahmayajna. The Deśawarnana , alias Nãgarakrtãgama , completed in A.D. 1365 by Mpu Prapañca, Superintendent of Buddhist Affairs (dharmädhyaksa kasogatan) at the court of Hayam Wuruk of Majapahit in East Java, refers to a brahmayajna in contexts that indicate that a ritual of worship rather than text recitation is intended. He tells us that the royal priest Śrijnanawidhi in performing the preliminaries to the postmortuary rites of the chief queen (rājapatnī) consecrated the ground for installation and in that context 'performed a brahmayajna as his offering (pūjāY' 129 and in an account of annual ceremonies for the welfare of the king he tells us that 'the Saivas and Bauddhas performed the homa and brahmayajna as their offering (pūjā)' 130 One could not refer to the brahmayajñah in the figurative sense of text-recitation as a pūjā. 127. See, e.g., K. 692, v. 43d: caturānano vidhir ; Amarakoka 1.1.1 7d (among synonyms of brahmã). 128. Cœdès and Dupont give vividhãvrstibhavam. I have corrected this because the metre requires the third syllable to be short. As for the solecisms in the rest of the verse, I have understood havir āhutir as havir āhutam and kotir hutis as kotir hutā. 129. Deśawarnana 67.3: saň srī jnãnawidhi n lumakwani těhěr mabrahmayajña n pamūjā. 130. Deśawarnana 83.6: homa mwaň brahmayajnenulahakěn ira saň śewa boddha n pamūjā. It may be relevant that the centre-point of any ritual ground (yâgabhûmih ) is known as the 'place of Brahma' (brahmasthãnam)' see, e.g., Bhojadeva, Siddhāntasārapaddhati , f. 6r (on entering the shrine for worship): brahmasthāne om vãstospataye brahmane nama iti puspam dativa ... One of the principal rites in the preparation of a site is the Vāstupūjā , the presentation of offerings to the deities of the 64 or 81</page><page sequence="38">386 Alexis SANDERSON No details of the ritual are recorded. But among the supplements (pariśistam ) of the Atharvaveda , short tracts which set out the ritual duties of the king's personal priest, there is one (19b) that gives the procedure of a brahmayãgah. Since yãgah and yajñah are synonymous and since no other applicable brahmayajnah/brahmayãgah is taught in the brahmanical literature known to me, it seems at least probable that the Khmer and Javanese ceremonies were derived from it. In this Brahma is worshipped in a Mandala in a pavilion ( maņdapah ) constructed for this purpose, a platform ( vedih ) is made to its south or west, a fire-sacrifice is celebrated and an abhisekah given [to the king on that platform]. This is followed by the feeding of learned brahmins and the needy, the offering of a nocturnal gaņabalih , worship of the domestic deities, festivities in the palace, the feeding of Yogins and householders in their homes, and the usual markers of royal ceremonies in the civic domain: the temporary banning of the cutting down of trees and the butchering of animals, and the proclamation of a general amnesty throughout the kingdom. Finally the king should venerate his Guru. The benefits are said to be long life and the extension of the king's realm. 131 Other brahmanical rituals are encountered in the inscriptions. We have seen that a Matryajña is said to have been performed as a preliminary ritual on the site on which a Linga was to be installed. I propose that this was the worship of the Mother-goddesses {mātrkāpūjā) that is prescribed in Indian brahmanical sources as a preliminary rite in such ceremonies as rites of passage (samskãrah) and the consecration of homes or temples (pratistha). 132 There is also the first of the three annual sacrifices mentioned in the Sanskrit verse attributed to Sûryavarman I. Though the Sanskrit is lacunose and somewhat incoherent (- - d guror hutavahe havir ãhutir yat ) it is very probable that this was a guruhomah , a sacrifice [in honour] of the Guru. Against this conjecture is the absence of any reference to a sacrifice with this name in brahmanical literature. But in its support is the fact that elsewhere in these inscriptions a royal Guru is described as gurukotihomahotā. 133 CŒDÈS took this to mean 'who performed the Kotihoma for his Guru'. But this is highly implausible, since the Kotihoma is a sacrifice performed for kings. The alternative is to take the compound to mean 'who performed the Guruhoma and the Kotihoma'. In that case this ceremony too should be among those listed in the Khmer prose as the annual duties of the royal Guru. If so, it can only have been the third Homa of the list. Against this conclusion is the fact that CŒDÈS and Dupont judge there to be a lacuna of three syllables in the text where its name is given ( vrah + + + horná) while the restoration vrah guruhoma supplies only two {guru-). However, this objection is not decisive. For guru has the trisyllabic ãcãrya as a frequently used synonym. I propose, therefore, the restoration vrah ãcãryahoma. We also hear of the brahmanical practice of the daily pouring of libations of water to the ancestors (pitrtarpaņam ). For in an inscription of 667 A.D. Simhadatta, the devout Šaiva physician of Jayavarman I, is praised as follows: compartments of the square Mandala of the Site ( vāstumaņdalam ) drawn upon it. Brahmā is worshipped with the presentation of various foods in the central four or nine compartments; see, e.g, Somasambhupaddhati 4:55 and 57, vv. 83ab and 89c-91b. 131. Atharvavedaparisista 19.1.1-19.5.9. I propose the following emendations to the published text: pürayed varņakaih for püjayed varņakaih in 19.2.1; and madhyepadmam tu samsthãpya brahmāņam for madhye padmam tu samsthãpya brahmāņam in 19.2.5. 132. On the mātrkāpūjā in this context see Sanderson 1990, 62. 133. K. 692 of 1 189/90 or 1 195/6. v. 54.</page><page sequence="39">The Saiva Religion among the Khmers (Part I) 387 sivayajñena y o devān munīn addhyayanena ca pitřms cãtarppayat toyais satputrakaranissrtaih K. 53, v. 23 He satisfied the gods through his worship of Siva, the sages through his recitation of sacred texts, and the ancestors through libations of water poured from the hands of a virtuous son. That this refers to the daily libations that brahmanical tradition requires is not stated explicitly; but it is implied by the context, since the other two obligations, those of worship and reciting the scriptures, are daily duties. By speaking of these libations as poured from the hands of his son the author conveys that he has fulfilled his duty to the ascendants of his patriline, not merely by pouring the libations himself, which goes without saying since this is among the daily duties of any brahmin male, but also by fathering a son, since without a son to follow on the offerings to the ancestors would be interrupted. 134 Postfunerary rituals other than the annual Pitryajña are mentioned. We are told of Šrāddhas performed for the benefit of persons who have died leaving no-one to make these offerings to them. An inscription reports that a Saiva hermitage abandoned in A.D. 949/50 had been restored by four men without heirs on the condition that their Šrāddhas would be performed by the head (pādamūla ) of the hermitage; 135 and the foundation stele of one of the hermitages founded by Yasovarman I rules that balls of rice (piņdam ) must be offered [by the officiant] to persons who have died leaving no-one to make their postfunerary offerings ( apiņdāh ). ye bhaktyã patita yuddhe ye ca bhaktãh parãsavah apiņdāh krpanānāthavālavrddhās ca ye mrtãh etesãm èva sarvvesãn caturādhakatandulaih mãsãvasãne sarvvatra piņdaih kurvvīta tarppaņam etasminn āsrame piņdan krtvãnlya ca sarwaśah yasodharatatãkãnte tasminn èva tu nirvvapet K. 279 Cl, w. 13-15 At the end of every month he should use four ādhaka measures of rice to satisfy with rice-balls all the following: those who have fallen in battle out of loyalty [to the king], deceased loyal [servants of the crown], and the wretched, the unprotected, children and the elderly, who have died without anyone to offer them the postfunerary rice- balls. He should prepare the rice-balls in this hermitage, and then take them and offer them at the edge of the Yaśodhara reservoir. 136 1 34. The verse invokes the brahmanical doctrine of the three debts from which a twice-born male must free himself before he is entitled to retire from the world. There are two views expressed as to how he is to clear his debt to his ancestors: (1) by making the postfunerary offerings to them, and (2) by fathering offspring. The first is seen in Mahābhārata 12. 28 1.9c- 10c: rņavān j ayate martyas tasmād anrņatām vrajet / svãdhyãyena maharsibhyo devebhyo yajñakarmana / pitrbhyah srāddhadānena 'Mortals are born with debts [to the great sages, the gods and their ancestors]. Therefore they should free themselves of them, through the daily recitation of the sacred texts, the rituals of sacrifice and the giving of postfunerary offerings'. The second is seen in Baudhäyanadharmasütra 2.6.11.33: jãyamãno vai brāhmaņas tribhir rņavā jãyate brahmacaryena rsibhyo yajñena devebhyah prajayã pitrbhya iti 'The brahmin is born with three debts: to the sages, to the gods, and to his ancestors [, which he clears] by studying the scriptures, by offering sacrifices, and by fathering offspring' and in Manusmrti 6.35-37. Our inscription combines these two views. 135. K. 215, 11. 16-17: ãyãtta ta pādamūla leň nirvvāpa neh dharmma yeň 4 It is the responsibility of the officiant to perform the Srāddha offerings of this foundation'. 136. This is the vast Yaśodharatataka (approx. 7 km. by 1.8 km [Jacques 1999, 55]), now known as the Eastern Baray, excavated by Yasovarman I at his newly founded capital Yaśodharapura (Angkor).</page><page sequence="40">388 Alexis Sanderson In discussing the group of stelae of which this is one Barth states that there is nothing in Indian Smrti texts corresponding to this provision by the king for Šrāddha offerings for such persons, holding that the Indian rule is that only a relative of the deceased may perform the rite. 137 But that he was mistaken is clear from Brahmapurāņa 220.78c-79b: sarvābhāve striyah kuryuh svabhartfņām amantrakam tadabhãve ca nrpatih kãrayet tv akutumbinãm If there is no-one else, women should do [the Šrāddha] for their husbands if they have no family, [but] without the Mantras; and if there is no wife then the king should have it done for them. The principal here is that the heir and the person with the duty to make the postfunerary offerings are one and the same. In the absence of all others the king inherits the property of the deceased except, says Manu, in the case of a brahmin, whose property may never be taken by the king but must be given to a brahmin, preferably one learned in the Vedas. That these rules are relevant to the question of who has the responsibility to make the offerings is apparent from the fact that Vijñanesvara quotes the passage of the Manusmrti that states them (9.188-189) in this context ad Yãjnavalkyasmrti 2.135-136. Moreover, the case of the heirless individuals who had restored a foundation on the condition that its head should make their Šrāddha offerings (K. 215, 11. 16-17) may be understood as an application of the rule that in the absence of a son or close relative the Äcärya of the deceased may make the offerings. 138 We hear also of a Homa performed by the royal preceptor Divākarabhatta for the deceased queen MahendradevI on the twelfth day after her death, an office for which her husband Rājendravarman rewarded him with the gift of two villages. 894 saka pūrņņamī phālguņa nu vrah kamrateň añ divākarabhatta nivedana ta dhūli vrah pāda dhūli jeň vrah kamrateň [añ srl ] jayavarmmadeva kãla samrãc homa dvādašarātrī vrah pãda [vrah ãjjnã kanion kamrateň añ ° riy sruk kandin nu sruk supurãya pramān pūrvvadisa ° ta gi dhūlī vrah pāda dhūlī jeń vrah kamrateň añ stãc dau sivaloka oy vrah karunã prasãda ta vrah kamrateň añ [divãka] rabbatta neh sruk ta anie 2 gi pi vrah kamrateň añ + + + + + vrah dakšiņā phley srāc dvādašarātrī K. 668 B, 11. 1-8 In Šaka 894, on the full-moon day of Phālguņa V.K.A.

[Divākarabhatta received as (?)] his sacred dakšiņā as the result of the completion of [the rites of] the twelfth day. This was no doubt a Homa in connection with the offering of the first Ekoddista Šrāddha after the period of eleven days of postmortuary impurity ( ãsaucam ) had ended, 139 though 137.

Given the prevalence of Saiva initiation it is possible that the queen's postmortuary rites were performed in the parallel form that the Šaivas elaborated for their own initiates. 140 Brahmanism, then, was certainly present among the Khmers, at least within the élite of society. But I see no evidence that it amounted to a fourth religion. The Indian Saivas claimed to go beyond Brahmanism through practice authorized by their own, higher bodies of scripture; but they underwent Brahmanism's rites of passage, performed many of its regular ceremonies in addition to their own, and adhered to its regulations concerning such matters as caste-endogamy, inheritance, and the administration of law under royal authority. Only their path to salvation was peculiarly theirs. The Brahmanism that we find among the Khmers was of this subsidiary kind. There is no trace of the exclusive variety that many in India considered to be the sole means of access to salvation, denying the validity of the Saiva and Vaisņava scriptures. What is more, the subsidiary Brahmanism of the Khmers was less substantial than that of their Indian co-religionists. Its influence did not penetrate to those levels that provided the primary criteria of brahmanical orthopraxy in India. The Khmers eagerly adopted the etiquette and ceremonial of the Indian courts; they cremated their dead; and they allowed India to influence their personal habits, avoiding the left hand in eating, and cleaning their teeth with toothsticks; 141 but they did not adopt Brahmanism's dietary preferences and taboos, except in the case of special restrictions adopted by Saiva ascetics. 142 Thus we have two inscriptions in meditation caves that speak of such ascetics living on a diet of milk, a practice attested in Indian Saiva sources; 143 but reliefs on the wall of the Bayon after that until a full year has elapsed. Then the deceased (pretah ) becomes an ancestor (pita) through the Sapindīkaraņa ritual and from then on receives annual Pārvana Šrāddhas, unless the deceased is a woman without a son. In that case she does not join the ancestors through the Sapindīkaraņa and receives an annual Ekoddista rather than Pārvana Šrāddha. See, e.g., Brahmapurāna 220.64-75. 140. On the Saiva rites for the dead and their relation with their brahmanical prototypes see Sanderson 1995,31-36. 141. See Mabbett and Chandler 1996, 128, 129 and 133. Information on Khmer funerary practice is meagre. According to a passage in the official history of the Sui Dynasty ( Suishu ), covering the years 581-617 and compiled during the years 629-636, that is included in Ma Duanlin's Wenxian tongkao , an encyclopaedic history of institutions published in A.D. 1317, cremation was the norm though there were some who simply exposed their dead (translation in Cœdès 1968, 76). In Zhou Daguan's memoir, based on his visit in a.D. 1296-7 and published at some time before 1312 (Pelliot 1951, 37-38) it is exposure that is reported as the norm. He notes that cremation was gradually increasing, but mostly among the descendants of Chinese (Pelliot 1951, 24). The difference between the two reports is probably the result of the different perspectives of the two divisions of Khmer society, that of the common people, who exposed their dead, and that of the élite, who cremated theirs following Indian rites. The Suishu says that the dead were attended either by Buddhist monks and nuns or by Taoist priests. The latter term is probably a reference to Šaiva ascetics. Excavations at Nen Chua and Go Thap in the Mekong Delta have uncovered brick-lined chambers containing cremated human remains with gold leaves showing brahmanical symbols and other mortuary offerings. Radiocarbon dates suggest occupation during the periods a.D. 450-650 for the former and A.D. 400-600 for the latter (High am 2001, 29-31). 142. Similarly Reid (1988, 34-35) points to the fact that brahmanical dietary rules "had little practical effect in restricting sources of protein" among the Javanese. 143. K. 156 (10th century), v. lOcd, concerning the ascetic Kambu: gurudevãgnisadbhaJctir ãcãryyah ksīrabhug yamî 'an ascetic [Šaiva] Ãcãrya living on milk, truly devoted to his Guru, his deity, and the sacred fire'; v. 16ab: ksīrāsī yo *mahātejāh (corr. : mahātejā Ep.) püjyas srīkamvubhūbhrtām 'an illustrious eater of milk, venerated by the kings of Kambu'. K 431 (9th century), v. 4, tells us of another such Saiva ascetic inhabiting the cave Indraguhā 'who adhered to the ascetic observance of Sadāsiva [=</page><page sequence="42">390 Alexis Sanderson temple of Jayavarman VII (r. 1181 - c. 1210) depict fishing with nets and a kitchen in which two cooks are about to plunge a whole pig into a boiling cauldron; and Chinese sources report that the Khmers' diet included cakes soaked in meat gravy and that they reared chicken, ducks, sheep and geese. 144 The Manusmrti , the foremost brahmanical authority on such matters, enjoins the avoidance of fish and strictly prohibits the eating of the meat of the domestic pig or hen, saying that any twice-born person who eats these loses his caste. 145 Indeed inscriptions show that pork, goat and fish were eaten by the Khmers even in religious feasts. Thus on the occasion of the erecting of boundary-stones in 1089 an inscription records a donation of food that includes two pigs and four goats; 146 and an inscription of the reign of Sûryavarman I (1002-c. 1050) speaks of a feast that required two-thousand bowls, two pigs, eight hundred large fish, and an unstated quantity of beer (surã). 147 This too was a feast in a religious context. The purpose of the inscription is to record a royal decree requiring [the head of] a hermitage and the dignitaries (pradhāna ) of two localities to pay with land for the equipment and materials (kriya) of a vrah rudrasãnti. The foods and utensils are part of what was received for that purpose. In his edition of this Susiva], [sustaining himself by] drinking [only] milk' (ksïram piban ...susivavratasthah).

Similarly K. 91 (no earlier than the reign of Jayavarman VI [1080-1107]) tells us that the Kavīsvarapaņdita, the Guru and counsellor of Sûryavarman I, followed the religious discipline of the Paficarātra and lived on clarified butter: vrah kamrateň añ srī kavīsvarapaņdita qji mãtrpaksa [yejń mān sīļa pancarātra *ghrtãhãra (corr. : ghrnãhãra CŒDÈs). 144.

It is a Saiva ceremony. The purpose of a Rudrasãnti ritual is to counter ills of all kinds but above all national disasters, epidemics and famines. Its procedure ( kalpah ) and myth of origin (itihãsah) are the subject of a chapter of the Saiva scripture Brhatkãlottara ; 149 and an abbreviated redaction of the section on the procedure has been incorporated in the Agnipurãna ( Adhyãya 324). The foodstuffs and beer were evidently required for a feast held at the conclusion of a performance of this ritual, probably at some time of widespread distress. Such feeding, of brahmins and others, is, as is well known, a required subsidiary of all major Indie rituals, and in apotropaic rituals of whatever scale. This too, then, would have been a religious rather than a secular feast. 150 Khmer patterns of kinship, inheritance and property-rights also remained largely unaffected. The passing of office from a man to his sister's son seems to have been the norm among Khmer brahmins, and it remained widespread even in royal lineages, where patrilineal succession did make inroads. 151 Women, moreover, appear as owners and disposers of property in their own right, a role from which Indian brahmanical tradition excluded them. 152 Thus K. 216 S of A.D. 1 006/7 reports that Madhyadesâ, a woman in service at the court, donated land and other property to her Guru after a Brahmayajña, and yet other lands to the Siva installed at Šivapāda; and the Khmer portion of this inscription lists slaves given by two men to Ten Urnā, the granddaughter of Madhyadesâ; K. 165 N of A.D. 953 records that Me Indrāni, Me DevakI and Me Nem, three female members of the family of Tañ Kamrateń Añ MahendradevI joined with Vāp Pañ, the chief (mūļa) of the corps of Bhāgavata servants, 148. /C 5:134, n. 2.

We learn that when there was no available male in a lineage of Bhāgavatas designated to supply the presiding officiant of the Visņu temple at Kaden, a woman of the family was to be ordained for that purpose. 154 Nor is it probable that this arrangement was exceptional among the Khmers, for we find it also in the royal Saiva cult of the Devarāja. In the Sdok Kak Thom inscription of A.D. 1053, to which we owe most of our knowledge of this cult, we are told that after its inauguration by king Jayavarman II around the turn of the eight and ninth centuries he and the brahmin Hiranyadama agreed that the right to conduct the worship of the god should pass from Sivakaivalya to men or women in his maternal line: tanmātrvamse yatayas striyo vã jātā u - tra niyuktabhãvãh tady āj akās syur na kathañcid any a iti ksitīndradvijakalpanāsīt K. 235, v. 31 The king and the foremost of brahmins provided that ascetics or women born in his [Sivakaivalya's] maternal lineage, and no others under any circumstances, should be appointed to this ...and perform its worship. Cœdès and Dupont chose to translate this passage in a manner that eliminates reference to the right of women by taking striyo not as a nominative plural ('ascetics or women born in his maternal lineage') but as an ablative singular ('ascetics born from a woman in his maternal lineage'). But this asks us to accept an unnaturally stilted use of Sanskrit in an inscription whose Sanskrit is otherwise of a high standard of correctness 153.

K. 989 B, 11. 10-11 (of A.D. 1007) referring to an edict of Jayavarman II (r. c. A.D. 110-c. 834) concerning the Vaisņava temple of the God of Kaden ( kamrateň jagat kadeň): vrah sāsana pre santāna sten rau ta phjuh purohita kamrateň jagat kadeň ° daha qyat santãna ta purusa (11) ley strijana ta qvyah mān rtusnāta lah ta wam rtusnāta ley Iah pvās bhāgavatī pre phjuh kamrateň jagat kadeň 'A royal edict [of Jayavarman II] ordered that the descendants of Steñ Rau should serve as the officiants (purohita ) of the God of Kaden, and if there is no male descendant that a woman who is qvyah , who has bathed after menstruation or who has not, should be ordained as a Bhāgavatī (a female Bhāgavata) and serve the God of Kaden'. Cœdès (tr., IC 7, 183) understood rtusnāta lah ta wam rtusnāta ley lah to mean 'nubiles ou non nubiles'. Vickery rightly finds fault with this rendering and proposes instead 'women who no longer menstruate or who have not begun to menstruate' (1998, 220, 419-420), taking qvyah to mean 'finished with' and apparently having it govern rtusnāta. However, that too is unsatisfactory, however well it accords with anthropological expectations about menstruation taboos, since it is implausible that prepubertal girls were ordained as temple priests. The Sanskrit term rtusnāta- adopted by Old Khmer refers to a woman who has bathed at the end of the five days of impurity caused by her menstruation and is thereby considered ready to conceive, it being obligatory for the husband to attempt to proceate a son at this time; see, e.g., Parāsarasmrti quoted by Kullūka ad Manusmrti 3.45: rtusnātām tuyo bhãryãm sannidhau nopagacchati / ghorãyãm bhrūņahatyāyām patate nātra samsayah' Trilocanasiva, Prâyascittasamuccaya p. 52: rtusnāta yadâ patnī tādā pancadināvadhi / sevyâ vipreņa putrārtham anyathä bhrūņahā bhavet. I tentatively propose, therefore, that rtusnāta here is extended to mean 'of child-bearing age' and that accordingly warn rtusnāta means 'no longer of child-bearing age'.</page><page sequence="45">The Saiva Religion among the Khmers (Part I) 393 and lucidity; and, more conclusively, it overlooks the crucial word vã ('or'). Women, then, had the right to serve as priests, if only in the absence of a qualified male. 155 It seems, moreover, that high-born women were not barred by their gender from access to all positions in the administration. We learn that after the death of king Rājendravarman (r. 944 -c. 968) Prāņā, the daughter of his sister, was put in charge of the private secretaries of his successor Jayavarman V (r. c. 968 -c. 1000/1). 156 As for caste, adherence to which is so central an element of brahmanical orthopraxy in India, our sources use its language to distinguish between brahmins and the 'ksatriya' rulers they served; but marriage between brahmin men and women of the Khmer royal families was common, as it was in the neighbouring principalities of the Chams, kings of both peoples boasting of brahmin-ksatriya descent; 157 and most of the rest of society is referred to without caste-differentiation as 'the common people' (. sãmãnyajanah , sãmãnyãh ): 158 rãjakutyantare rājadvijātinrpasūnavah viseyur atra nirddosan ta evãbharanãnvitãh tadanyas tu sasãmãnyajano noddhatavesaņah K. 95 A, v. 39-41 b Only the king, brahmins and the prince(s) may enter this royal house of retreat wearing their ornaments without fault. Others than they, and the common people, should not be dressed in finery. and, in the Lolei inscription of Yasovarman 1 (r. 889-910) prescribing the punishments that should be meted out to those who infringe the rules of conduct in a hermitage: 78 ye sāsanam idan darppāl laňghayeyur yyadi dvijāh vadhadandãdyanarhatvãn nirvvãsyãs ta ito nganãt 79 rãjaputrãs tu dãpyãs te hemaviňsatpalair mmitam tadarddhavinayah kãryyo nrpatijnātimantriņām 155. Cœdès and Dupont 1943^6, 96: '«Que les yatis nés d'une femme de ce mâtrvamça et préposés... ici, soient prêtres de ce culte et jamais d'autres ! » Telle fut la règle des brahmanes royaux'. I also reject their translation of ksitīndradvija- as 'brahmanes royaux' (literally 'king-brahmins'). This too is implausible. The preferable alternative ('the king and the foremost of brahmins') fits the context perfectly and is supported by the Old Khmer parallel in 11. 76-77 of side 3: vrah pāda paramesvara nu vrāhmaņa hiranyadãma oy vara sāpa pre santãna sten añ sivakaivalya gì ta siň nā kamrateń jagat ta rāja wam äc ti man qnak ta dai ti ta siň ta nohh 'V.

If a common person cannot pay his fine he should receive one hundred blows of the cane upon his back. 159 The superficiality of the concept of caste among the Khmers is also evident in the fact that varņah , the Indian Sanskrit term for the [four] caste-classes from brahmin to Šūdra, was put to other use in Cambodian Sanskrit and Old Khmer. There it denotes title-groups or corporations associated with various kinds of royal service.

But this would be an error. There would be a prima facie reason to see the khñum in this light, if it were the case that slaves in India were considered pollutant. 166 But I find no evidence that this was so and much that it was not. For slaves working in Indian Saiva temples we have the testimony of the Siva- dharmottara, in which 'Siva's slaves' (sivadãsãh) are distinguished from temple servants hired for wages in a passage that promises both categories of worker that they will attain the world of Rudra when they die: ye cãpi vrttibhrtakãh sivãyatanakarminah yãnti te 'pi mrtãh svarge sivakarmānubhāvatah sivadāsatvam āpannā naranārīnapumsakāh te 'pi tannãmasamyogãd yãnti rudrapuram mahat f. 12[75]v5-6 (2.166-167) Those wage-earners who work in the temple of Siva will also go to heaven when they die by virtue of their work for Siva (sivakarma). As for men, women and the neuter who have become Šiva's slaves (Šivadāsas), they too, because of their connection with the name of that [god], will go to the great paradise of Rudra. 167 The Saiva Paddhati Naimittikakarmānusandhāna composed by Brahmaśambhu of the KarkaronI branch of the Mattamayüra lineage in 938/9 A.D. also distinguishes these two categories of worker. We are told that after the cremation of an ascetic of a hermitage (Matha) the Äcärya should announce the event to the initiated ascetics, lay Māhesvaras, slaves and workers [of the Matha]: des ikãdisamayy antan vyãhrtya tu tapodhanãn mãhesvarajanãms cãpi dãsãn karmakarãms tathã drstapūrvāparān brúyãd iti sarvvãn sadharmmiņah. ff. 92v5-93rl Similarly, when an outgoing Äcärya passing on his duties to his successor tells him all the details of the foundation over which he will preside, these should include the slaves he must support: 1 05 idam sthãnam iyam vrttir esã pustakasamhatih ami vai bharanîyâs tu dãsãh karmakarãs ca nah 166. This has been taken for granted by Jacques 1976a, 73-74. He argues that those khñum who were working within the temple, for example in the preparation of food, cannot have been slaves in the Indian sense, since this would have contravened brahmanical dietary taboos, and that this would surely have been unacceptable in Cambodia, even though the system was probably less rigid there. 167. The role of neuter slaves ( napumsakah , klībah ), that is to say, of men congenitally incapable of sexual intercourse and fatherhood rather than 'eunuchs', as these terms are commonly mistranslated, is unclear. I suppose that it was in the quarters reserved for the large numbers of women dedicated to the god as Rudragaņikā dancers or in humbler capacities (Devadāsīs). The reference to connection with the name of the god mentioned in this passage shows that the term sivadãsah is a title as well as a description. Cf. such terms as sivagãnavit "a singer in a Śiva temple", sivadîksitah "a Šaiva initiate", sivabrāhmaņah "a Šaiva brahman", sivavratî "a Šaiva ascetic", and sivārāmah "the garden of a Šaiva temple or hermitage".</page><page sequence="49">The Saiva Religion among the Khmers (Part I) 397 1 06 etat sarvam mayã tubhyam dattam adya tvayãpi ca pâlanîyam tathã samyag yathãsmãbhih prapãlitam f. 73vl-3, = 4.105-106 105d dãsãh em. : dãsya Cod. Such is the foundation; such is the revenue; such is the library; and these are the slaves and workers that it is my duty to support. All this 1 have given to you this day, and you should properly maintain it as 1 have done. 168 The Saiva scripture Brhatkãlottara defines the property of a temple-god (devasvam) as whatever has been donated to that god, including humans (dvipadāh): yad dattam devadevãya tac candãya prakalpayet lo ham bhū t väjayed yatnäd't dvipadãs ca catuspadāh manayo ratnanicayam devasvam parikīrtitam f. 44v5-6, = 22.8c-10b He should assign to [the charge of the deity] Canda whatever has been donated to Siva. The property of a deity (devasvam) is defined as 'metals, lands, t ...t, human beings (dvipadāh), livestock, jewels and precious stones. 169 and inscriptions confirm that such slaves were a common feature of temples. 170 As for the relative purity or impurity of slaves in ancient India, it was a matter of their caste or that of their owner (svāmī), not of their degraded civil status. Thus when considering the proper duration of the periods of impurity (ãsaucakãlah) for the various castes caused by the death or birth of a relative both brahmanical and Saiva authorities rule that the period for a domestic slave should be that prescribed for his master, or if his master has died, that prescribed for his own caste, which would normally but not always be Šūdra. 171 I see no reference to the period of impurity for temple slaves in brahmanical sources. But the Saiva Trilocanasiva rules that a female temple slave (devadāsī) and any Šūdra that works in the temple (which would include and is probably intended to mean male temple slaves of that caste) is subject to impurity for twenty days. 172 During this period they are not excluded 168. A related passage in the Keralan Siddhāntasāra of īsānašivagurudeva adds female slaves; see ī'sānasivagurudevapaddhati , Kriyãpãda , p. 196: i dam sthānam ime dharmãs caite pustakasancayãh / dãsídãsãdayas caite paripãlyã yathã purā . 169.

For this is an adaptation of a ruling which has a similar sense in the brahmanical Dharmasāstra. There we find that Šātātapa and Brhadvyäsa declare that Šūdras require only twenty days to be returned to full purity, and that this discrepancy is resolved by taking these authorities to mean this to apply only to devout, observant Šūdras, the rule of thirty days laid down by Manu applying to the rest. 175 Moreover, just as not all Indian slaves were Šūdras, so the slaves of god in the Khmers' temples included some at least who are likely to have been of high birth. The evidence of this is in the names of the slaves listed in our inscriptions in records of donations. While nearly all the donors have Sanskrit names, the names of most of these slaves are Khmer, and some of them are derogatory. 176 Among the Sanskrit names too are some that are consonant with low status. For example, some male slaves mentioned in pre- Angkorean inscriptions were named after a day of the lunar month, probably because they were born or acquired on those days. 177 But we also find such names as Jyesthavarma, īsānasiva, Brahmasiva, Mūrdhasiva, Vaktrasiva, Varmasiva, Šikhāsiva and Hrdayasiva. 178 The first of these is indicative of 'ksatriya' status, names in - varma being held among the Khmers by royalty, generals and other high non-religious dignitaries. The rest are Saiva initiation names ( dīksānāma ) and of a kind given only to brahmins according to most Indian authorities and to members of all castes above the Šūdras according to the rest, 179 173.

This records that of three persons found guilty of misappropriating lands two were punished by the mutilation of their lips and the amputation of their hands and the third given to the litigant at his request along with his entire family and domain in what is surely a case of the punitive enslavement ( daņda - dãsatvam) recognized by brahmanical authorities. 181 The reason for the difference in Kriyãpãda 8.60c-61, taking dvijendrāh 'the foremost of the twice-born' to refer implausibly to the best in all three caste-classes of the twice-born, i.e. outstanding brahmins, ksatriyas or vaišyas; Tantrãlokaviveka ad 4.265ab; and Manodaguru, Kalādīksāpaddhati , BORI MS. 157 of 1886-92, ff. 96vl6-97r: tatpātāvasare sivanāmānkitam śisyam vidhãya striyam ca saktināmānkitām vidhãya bhagavan sakalesvara tvatpādapadmapūj anaras ikamanãh ayam amukasiva agata iti pumvisaye. strîvisaye tu bhagavan sakalesvara tvatpādapadmapūj anaras ikamanãh iyam amukadevī agata iti puspãnjalipãtãvasare guruh kathayed ity arthah. südravisaye tu ayam amukagaņa agata iti prayojyam. ayam visayo bhuktiparah. mumuksau tu gurur evecchayã nãma kuryãt 4 [The words] "When, at the time that it has fallen, the Guru has given a male candidate a name in - śi va and a female a name in -śakti" mean that as soon as the handful of flowers has fallen he should say in the case of a man "Lord Sakalesvara [= Sakalasvacchanda], this [man] N- šiva has arrived, eager to worship the lotuses that are your feet" and in the case of a woman "Lord Sakalesvara, this [woman] N-devI has arrived, eager to worship the lotuses that are your feet."

The giving of names in -varma to ksatriyas follows Manusmrti 2.32b.

For the enslavement of a brahmin destroys the king's power'. 181. See Manusmrti 8.415cd, in which the daņdadāsah 4the slave by punishment' is listed as the last of seven types of legally permitted slave. Judicial enslavement is also recognized in the Saiva context. The Sivadharmottara reports that free women could be forced as punishment for unspecified offences to become Rudragaņikās (also called Rudrakanyâs or Rudranāris), female temple slaves of a superior class whose duty was to gratify the deity with dancing (f. 12[75]v7-8, = 12.168): dattāh krītāh pravistãs ca *daņdotpannā (em. : daņdātpannāh Cod.) balāhrtāh / vijneyã rudragaņikāh sivãyatanayositah 'Know that Rudragaņikās, the women of the temple of Šiva, are [of five kinds:] those given, those purchased, those who have entered [of their own free will], those who have become [Rudragaņikās] as a punishment [for a crime] ( daņdotpannāh ), and those acquired by force'. They are superior to other persons who are the god's property because Trilocanasiva gives the rule that the period of impurity caused by the death or birth of a relative is only fifteen days in their case, whereas he gives it as twenty days for a Devadāsī; see Prãyascittasamuccaya p. 65: ye ca māhesvarāh sūdrā bhasmarudrāksadhāriņah / tēsām pancadasāhena śuddhih sūtau mrtāv api / tathaiva *rudrakanyāyām (em. : sūdrakanyāyām Cod.) pancãcãrye 'pi *sammatam (em. : sammatau Cod.)

This means that he was the son of VIrendravIra, the general of king Harsavarman II. 182 Indian slaves, then, were not impure by reason of their civil status and there is no evidence that Khmer slaves, domestic or belonging to deities, were considered more impure than their Indian counterparts. The Chinese Zhou Daguan, observing the Khmers at the end of the thirteenth century, reported that their numerous domestic slaves were made to sit and sleep beneath the raised floors of the Khmers' houses, and that any visiting Chinese who had sexual intercourse with a slave girl even once was shunned by her Khmer master. But he also reports that slaves were allowed to enter the house, as in India, to carry out domestic duties. 183 This is far from untouchability in the brahmanical sense, and there is no sign of a more degraded group in Khmer society. For an Indian untouchable ( caņdālah ) was required by the brahmanical tradition to live with others of his caste far outside the limits of the settlement ( grāmah ) of the four caste-classes. He might enter it only in the forenoon to remove ordure and to perform any executions that may be required; he was to be executed himself if he were found within the settlement after midday; and he was ruled to be without right of access to the benefits of religion (, sarvadharmabahiskrtah , sarvakarmabahiskãryah). 184 Premodern Indian sources reveal no knowledge even of the existence of the Khmers. But how, one wonders, would Indian brahmanical authorities have looked upon this region? Would they have recognized it as part of the territory of their religion, that is to say, as a land fit for the performance of its sacrifices (yajñiyo deśah )? The answer must be no, if one applies the standard of the authoritative brahmanical jurist Medhātithi, writing in the ninth or tenth century, 185 since he rules the following in his commentary on Manusmrti 2.23: yadi kathamcid brahmãvartãdidesam api mlecchā ãkrameyuh tatra ivāvasihānarņ kuryur bhaved evãsau mlecchadeśah. tathã yadi kaścit ksatriyãdijããyo rãjã sãdhvãcarano mlecchãn parãjayet cãturvarnyam vãsayet mlecchãms cãryãvarta iva cāņdālān vyavasthãpayet so pi syãd yajñiyah If somehow foreigners ( mlecchãh ) were to invade a region such as Brahmāvarta and establish themselves there it would certainly become foreign [and so unfit for brahmanical sacrifices]. Equally if some king of orthodox observance belonging to the birth or death. The same is accepted for the Rudrakanya and the [musicians and dancing-instructor known as] the Five Ācāryas' Evidently this rule applies to them on the assumption that they are ŚOdras, that is to say, as a further reduction of the thirty days ruled for castes so classified. 182. K. 158, 25-26: osthacchedam karacchedam hemnãmnah pvãhvãyasya cal yathã taddosatah kuryãd iti tadrājasāsanam / svamātāmahasūnus tu kenāmā sakuļas tadā / yãcitas sahadevena rāj ña dattas sabhūmikah 'That king commanded that because of their crime Hem and PO should have their lips mutilated and their hands amputated. But at Sahadeva's request, Ke, [being] the son of the father of his mother, was given to him along with his family and lands'. That the father of his mother was VIrendravIra and the general of Harsavarman (II) is stated in K. 158, v. 11. 183. Pelliot 1951, 19. Zhou Daguan gives the going rate for a slave as one hundred lengths of cloth for one that is young and strong, and about thirty or forty for one that is old and weak. This corresponds quite well with the prices indicated in our inscriptions. For example, K. 933 of A.D. 1013 records the purchase of a woman and four children for sixty garments, of a woman for one buffalo, of a woman for twenty measures of paddy, of a woman for one frying-pan weighing six jyaň , and of a man for ten yo of garments and twenty measures of paddy. These reports reveal, incidentally, that the Khmers' economy was not monetarized. 184. See Manusmrti 10.12b, 10.51-56; Vaikhānasadharmasūtra 144.3-8. 185. Derrett 1975, 6.

This may have been all the more so for the Saivas, since their religion was essentially that of a brahmin-ksatriya culture centred on the court, the royal temple and the hermitage. As for the other non-brahmanical aspects of Khmer society there are large parts of India itself in which traditions such as matrilineal succession and cross- cousin marriage have survived within otherwise fully brahmanical communities, 188 traditions that were so integral to those communities that the theorists of Brahmanism conceded them as deśadharmah , as institutions prescribed and therefore meritorious for persons within the regions {desa-) in which they are practised. 189 So those who had reason to do so could have accommodated Khmer traditions of inheritance and property in the same way. In any case we have clear evidence in the Khmers' inscriptions that there were Indian brahmins prepared to migrate to the region and to accept the daughters of Khmer royalty in marriage. Durgasvāmin, a Taittiriya brahmin, is said to have been born in the Deccan (Daksiņāpatha) and to have married the daughter of īsānavarman I (r. 616/7, 627 -c. 635) (K. 438). Another Taittiriya, the Saiva Šakrasvāmin, is said to have been born in Madhyadeśa (K. 904) and to have married a daughter of Jayavarman I (r. 657, -690+). K. 95, v. 5 (= K. 323, v. 6) tells us that a brahmin Agastya of Ãryadesa, expert in the Veda and its ancillary sciences, married the princess YasomatI, the great-great-grandmother of the wife of Indravarman I (r. 877-before 889); and K. 263, v. 30 reports that the brahmin Divākarabhatta, husband of the younger sister of Rājendravarman (r. 944-968), had been born where Krsņa sported beside the river Yamuna, which is to say in the region of Mathurā in northern India. K. 910 of A.D. 651 mentions the benefactions of a brahmin Anantasvāmin from Mālava in western India; and K. 923, v. 14 describes Šrinivāsakavi, who served as a royal priest under Indravarman and his predecessor Jayavarman III (r. c. 835-before 877), as supremely learned in the Veda and as an immigrant who came from the excellent land of his birth to purify that of the Khmers. 190 It is very probable that this 'excellent land' was some region of the Indian subcontinent. Finally, K. 300, v. 7-10 186. For Medhātithi the relevant criteria in the present case must have been that the barbarians should be made to live apart as untouchables outside the religion. Only then could a conquered and colonized territory be fit for Brahmanical rites. 187. The same was and is the case among the Balinese of Bali and Lombok. They classify society within the four brahmanical caste-classes (caturwangsa): brahmano , satria , wesia ( triwangsa [gentry]) and sudra (commoners); and they recognize no untouchable group outside them. On the Balinese caste- system see Hobart et al. 2001, 76-82. 188. Matriliny is practised by the Nayars of Kerala (see Fuller 1976; Gough 1993) and there is cross-cousin marriage (marriage between the children of a brother and sister) throughout the communities in which Dravidian languages are spoken (see Trautmann 1993a and 1993b). 189. See Trautmann 1993a, 87-88. There he renders dekadharmah as 'regional custom'. But as dharmah it is more than custom.

The Wenxian tongkao , Ma Duanlin's encyclopaedic history of institutions published in A.D. 1317, draws on an early Chinese report that Indian brahmins had been greatly favoured by the king of the nearby kingdom of Panpan on the Malay peninsula and that many had come to his court to profit from his patronage; 192 and a source of the fifth century cited in the Taiping yulan , the general encyclopedia ( leishu ) published by Li Fang and others in A.D. 984, reports that there were more than a thousand Indian brahmins in Dunsun, a principality in the same area and a dependency of the early kingdom of southern Kambujadeśa that the Chinese called Funan. The people of Dunsun, we are told, followed the religion of these brahmins, many of whom had settled there permanently since they had been given local women as wives. 193 The Pre-eminence of Saivism Of the three Indian faiths of the Khmers Saivism appears to have been the most widespread and the most deeply rooted. Already in the sixth century a Chinese source, the Nan Qishu , the Standard History of the Southern Qi dynasty (A.D. 479-501), cites the report of an Indian Buddhist monk Nāgasena sent by the king of Funan to the Chinese court in 484 that though Buddhism was present in the region the dominant religion was the worship of Mahesvara (= Śiva). 194 In later times it was so central to the ceremonial life of the monarchy that it may be called the state religion. Saiva temples and associated hermitages far outnumber others in the epigraphic and material records; and it was Šaiva ascetics that were the pre-eminent preceptors and priests of the élite. The pyramid-based state-temples built by the major Khmer rulers of the Angkorean period at the centre of the ceremonial capitals (puram ) whose foundation marked their reigns were mostly temples of Šivas incorporating the ruler's name installed by Saiva officiants; 195 and during this same period Saiva initiation (dīksā) became a regular addition to the conventional brahmanical rite of royal consecration ( rãjyãbhisekah ), being received even when a king's personal religious loyalty ( bhaktih ) was to Visņu or the Buddha rather than to Siva. 196 For their services these officiants were rewarded with lands, slaves, and other valuables, and they were granted the golden palanquins {dolã, dolãyãnam , sibikã ), golden-handled fly-whisks (i cãmaram ), fans ( vyajanam ), white parasols (. sitãtapatram ), peacock feather parasols 191. It is possible, though not probable, that the Madhyadeśa and Daksiņāpatha mentioned in the first two of these cases were Khmer localities named after those in India; for these see K. 300, v. 22, Ka. 18 (Madhyadeśa) and K. 289 B, v. 10 (Daksiņāpatha) ; and cf. Vickery 1998, 124, 194, 205. 192. See Cœdès 1968, 52. 193. Pelliot 1903,279. 194.

The Saivization of the land Furthermore, neither Pāncarātrika Vaisņavism nor Mahâyãna Buddhism became so intimately connected with the land itself. In the pre-Angkorean period most of the Sivas whose installation in Lińgas is recorded in our inscriptions, at least two thirds, were given the names of the Sivas of venerable Saiva sites of pilgrimage in India. They have a name in -Isvara preceded by the name of one of those sites, meaning, therefore, 'the Siva of X', or the name (in -Isvara) of the deity that presides there. The effect of the practice is to transfigure the Khmer realm by creating a Šaiva landscape whose sacred enclaves could be seen as doubles of those of the religion's Indian homeland. Nineteen such names, some given to more than one Khmer Siva, are those of Indian Sivas of such fame and sanctity that they are included in the following four lists in Indian sources: 1. The "five Lińgas" of v. 50 of the Sivastuti of Halayudha in an inscription of A.D. 1063 on the Ardhamandapa of the Amaresvara temple at Māndhātā (A). 198 2.

In most of these sources only the site is named, but in the SarvajMnottara and, in a few instances, in the Mataňga the names of the Šivas of the sites are given, though in some cases the name given is simply that of the site followed by -Iśa/Iśvara. In some of these cases it appears that the deity may be referred to either in that way or under his proper name. In other cases the presiding deity is identified only in the first style. This is the case with Lākula/Lākulin/Lakulīsvara, Bhārabhūtīsvara, Āsādhīsvara, Diņdīsvara, Mahākāla, Bhairava, Vimalesvara, Bhīmesvara and Sthāņvīšvara.

Of these the following would seem to be of particular antiquity, since they are already mentioned as sacred places associated with Śiva/Maheśvara in the pilgrimage text of the Äranyakaparva of the Mahābhārata : Mahākāla, Sthāņutīrtha, Šaiikukarņesvara, Vastrāpada, Rudrakoti, Suvarņāksa, Bhadrakarņesvara, Šrīparvata, and Gokarņa. Vārāņasī is associated with Mahesvara there; but there is no mention of Avimukta. 201. The original Skandapurāņa (167.1 18-149) says that Siva incarnated himself at Kārohaņa near the Narmadā as Bhārabhūti in the Krtayuga, as Diņdimuņda (sic) in the Tretâyuga, as Āsādhi in the Dvâparayuga, and as the Guru of Kauśika, Gärgya, Mitra and [Kurusya], that is to say as Lakulīsvara/Nakulīsvara, in the Kaliyuga. Kārohaņa, the supposed site of the revelation of the Pāsupata system, is modern Kārvān, a large village in the Dabhoi Taluk of the old Baroda State in Central Gujerat about 1 8 miles south of Baroda, not far from the Narmadā, probably once a station on the road from ancient UjjayinI to ancient Bhrgukaccha (mod. Broach). According to Matsyapurãna , Adhyãya 194 (in the Narmadãmãhãtmya ) Bhārabhūti is a Šivaksetra on the Narmadā below Broach. It is no doubt the Bhádbhut (sic) on the north bank of the Narmadā about 8 miles from Broach reported to be the site of a Siva in whose honour there is or was a pilgrimage every nineteen or twenty years in The Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency. Gujerát: Surat and Broach (Bombay: Government Central Press, 1877), 550-551. In the Gazetteer of the Ordnance Survey the village is written more correctly as Bharbhut. Āsādhi is mentioned in passing by the Matsyapurãna' s version of the Narmadãmãhãtmya after Bhārabhūti and before Stritīrtha. I have no information on the location of Diņdimuņdi/Diņdi, but it too was doubtless in this area. These four then, which head the lists, are Pāsupata sites. Of the other four, Amaresvara and Prabhāsa too were Pāsupata strongholds, to judge from inscriptions surviving at these sites.</page><page sequence="58">406 Alexis SANDERSON into existence, which is not likely to be later than the sixth century. In any case it is earlier than the ninth. The Nepalese "Licchavi" script of an undated and fragmentary palm-leaf manuscript of the Sivadharmottara suggests that it was penned in that century, 202 and that text is certainly not earlier and very probably later than the Sivadharma. That is also the probable date of a fragmentary Nepalese manuscript of the Sarvajñanottara , whose script closely resembles that of this Sivadharmottara manuscript. 203 We have early Nepalese manuscripts of two other of the Mantramārgic sources that retail this list, one of the Nisvãsaguhya from c. 900 and one of the Kiraņa from A.D. .924.

Yuko Yokochi has observed (1999a: 81-82) that the icon of the goddess Mahisāsuramardinī seen in texts of the sixth and seventh centuries gives way to a new iconic type around the beginning of the eighth century and that the original Skandapurāņa belongs with the earlier sources in this regard. The same scholar has argued (1999b: 68-75) that the "Gupta" type of this icon seen in the Skandapurāņa corresponds closely to the subtype seen in a sixth-century image in the Siddhi-kī-Guphā at Deogarh and concludes that there is a distinct possibility that the text was composed in that century.</page><page sequence="59">The Saiva Religion among the Khmers (Part I) 407 4.

We should probably add (20) Siddhesvara, of which several installations are recorded in pre-Angkorean inscriptions. I find the name in our lists only in a variant of B found in the Matsyapurãna , in which it is compounded with the familiar Mahälaya. 216 But there is evidence of numerous Indian Siddhesvaras, many with Pāsupata associations: at the Nolamba capital Hemavatī (Pāsupata);217 at Ededore;218 at Palāri, about 20 km north of Sirpur, in ancient Dakšiņa Kosala (Pāsupata);219 at Barākar in the Burdwan District of Bengal (Pāsupata); 220 at Māndhātā on the Narmadā (Pāsupata);221 at Somnāthpattan/- Prabhāsa in Kāthiāwād; 222 and at Loharì in Rajasthan. 223 trtatvasyãpi *copari (conj. : kopań Cod.) / amarekvarañ ca *ãgneye (corr. : agneye Cod.) karnnikãyãn tu vinyaset / 155 omkāra nairite bhãge dindi vai vãyugocare / īsāne ca tathā *diņdim (conj. : candi Cod.) sinharūpās tu vinyaset.

In the Indian lists cited here the place is Mahälaya and the presiding Śiva is Rudra. But the name Rudramahalaya is seen in a context that suggests that the same place is intended in Devala as quoted by Laksmldhara in his Krtyakalpataru, Tīrthavivecanakāņda p. 250: ksetrāņi vārāņasī mahābhairavam devadāruvanam kedāram *madhyamam rudramahãlayam. 216.

Its Indian eponym, at Kanakhala in Brahmāvarta, the area within North India venerated as Brahmanism's purest territory, that most fit for the performance of its sacrifices, was believed to have been installed by the deity Brahmā to mark the site of what is arguably the pivotal episode in the devotional mythology (sivakathāh) of the Saiva religion, that in which Daksa's Vedic Asvamedha sacrifice was destroyed as punishment for his failure to include Siva among the gods invited to receive a share of the offerings. 234 There were several Bhadresvaras in Kambujadeśa, a fact that attests the special status of this Siva among the Khmers, 235 but the most important, and perhaps the original, was at a temple-complex whose architectural remains date from the 7th to the 12th centuries A.D. 223.

The installation of the Indian Bhadresvara by Brahmā at Kanakhala just south of modern Hardwar and the tradition that it was the site of the overthrow of Daksa's Asvamedha by Bhadrakālī and the Gaņesvara Hari/Haribhadra/VIrabhadra are the subject of the thirty-second chapter of the original Skandapurāņa. This Rudraksetra, whose sanctity is declared to extend in all directions for a distance of one yojana around the Liňga (32.164), is said there to contain the Bhadrakarņa lake (32.166) and to be situated near Kubjāmra (32.171-176). Evidently, then, Bhadresvara is none other than the Bhadra- karnesvara already reported to be situated near Kubjāmra by the Mahābhārata ( Ãranyakaparvan 82.35- 36) in its account of the pilgrimage route from Kuruksetra to Prayâga. 235.

Mt. Phu Kao, known in our inscriptions as the Mountain of the Liňga ( liňgaparvatah , liňgadrih' owed its ancient name to an impressive Lińga-like outcrop on the summit at the centre of the massif. A deity personifying the mountain ( bhagavān srīlingaparvatah' probably a Siva, is mentioned in a fragmentary inscription assigned on palaeographic grounds to the second half of the fifth century found close to the mountain in the remains of an as yet unidentified city. 236 A royal decree from the reign of Jayavarman I (657, -690+) expresses the wish that the endowments of this god be used to good effect and underlines the sanctity of the area by prohibiting persons (1) from taking the life of any creatures that dwell on the mountain, even if they are criminals deserving punishment, (2) from moving about in its hermitage without restraint, riding in carriages, with raised umbrellas and chowries, and (3) from feeding or raising dogs and chickens on the god's lands. 237 The God Lingaparvata is also mentioned as the recipient of a silver bowl donated by Śańkarapandita, the priest (Purohita) of Harsavarman III (r. 1066/7-1080) and his two predecessors, 238 and as the recipient of a platter offered by king Tribhuvanâdityavarman (r. c. 1 165-1 177 A.D.) to mark the occasion of the second annual Kotihoma after his accession. 239 As for the outcrop after which the mountain was named, it was not perceived as merely Lińga-like. It was venerated as a Linga, under the name Niskala;240 and the remnants of the brick foundations of a temple have been discovered on its top, with a carved sandstone Linga lying at its foot. 241 In the Indian Saiva tradition natural Lińgas of this kind are termed self-created (svayambhu) or self-manifest {svayamvyaktam) and they 236.

The city, on the alluvial plain on the west bank of the Mekong River, with an archaeological area of about 400 hectares, has tentatively been identified as Śresthapura; see Unesco 1999, 70 (1.3.23). But this appears to rest on no firmer foundation than the long established assumption that Śresthapura was near Vat Phu. Vickery (1998, 346, 410^413) has shown the weakness of this assumption and has argued convincingly that the evidence points, though not conclusively, to a site in the central Angkor region between Siem Reap and Kompong Thorn. 237.

But K. 194, which he cites as evidence that the Kotihoma was performed at the time of accession, says only that it is performed every year after accession, as do our Indian authorities on royal ceremonies. These do not require it among the ceremonies of accession itself. 240. K. 583, v. 6 (as edited in Jacques 1976b). That Niskala is its name rather than a description of a type of Linga, i.e. 'subtle', 'interior' (Bhattacharya 1967) or 'simple', that is to say a Liňga proper without faces (Brunner-Lachaux 1968, 445^47), follows from the accompanying Khmer text, in which it is called vrah kamrateń añ srī niskala (11. 3-4). This was pointed out by Dagens in a private communication reported by Jacques in his edition of the inscription (1976b, 368). The sense of niskala- that justifies its technical use to denote the simple kind of Liňga is 'undifferentiated'. This would be even more appropriate as a name for a Liňga that has not been formed in any way by man. 241.

[The learned] declare that these [Lińgas] should not be examined [to determine whether they are in a state fit for worship]. They should be worshipped as they are. They do not have [the usual] division into the [three] segments; nor is it possible to be guilty of mixing Mantras [of different classes]. [The danger of] mixing Mantras and icons applies only in the case of Lińgas installed by human beings.' In ordinary Lińgas one may not install Mantras of one sort where Mantras of another have already been installed. This restriction does not apply in self-born and other natural Lińgas such as Banalińgas. This is another aspect of their immunity to contamination. In Šaiva scripture see Kir ana, f. 74v3: svayamudbhütalingasya sthãpitasya maharsibhih / devair *vā (em. : vya Cod.) sthãpitasyãpi rūpamānam na grhyate 'Form and dimension are irrelevant in the case of a self-arisen Lińga or of one that has been installed by a great sage or god'. Differentiation into sections (mūrtivibhāgah) is that into the square brahmabhāgah , which is the lower third of the Lińga, the octagonal visņubhāgah , which is the central, and the rounded cylindrical rudrabhāgah , which is the upper and the only one that is visible once the Lińga has been installed. This category of Lińga is mentioned in K. 762. It records the installation of a natural (svãyambhuvam) Lińga with the name Kedāresvara in A.D. 673. It is probable that another instance is recorded in K. 400B, v. 4-5: lingām suvarņņasamghātam surāsuragaņais tu u I + rggajanitam pu - u u ãmrãtasya kalpitam / [ vijyadratnasvarãnke smin kāle tat sthãpayat tadā I u u sadravinãny eva so smai prãdãc ca bhaktitah. I propose that the second Pāda read surāsuragaņais s tutam 'hymned by all the gods and Asuras'. Cf. the Pāda formula surãsuranamaskrtah that appears frequently in the Mahãbhãrata (1.94.34b etc.) and Purāņas. For the beginning of the third Pāda Cœdès conjectured svarggajanitam. But this is implausible because the three syllables after the first may never be u u u , and because the cadence of the Pāda would be a ma-vipulā without the required word-break before the closing - u . It is more probable, therefore, that there were two syllables in the initial lacuna and only one syllable after pu , probably nyam. I propose nisarggajanitam punyam , understanding the first word to mean 'born by nature, natural'. For the synonym nisargaja- in this sense see, e.g., Manusmrti 8.414cd and 9.16ab. As the object of the reverence of both the gods and the Asuras it is appropriate that the Lińga should be of this kind. That it is a 'natural' Lińga is also suggested by the expression suvarņņasamghātam 'a conglomeration of gold'. This would be an odd way to refer to a Lińga cast in gold, but makes good sense if it was rather a naturally Lińga-shaped nugget. As restored the passage means 'In 790 [Śaka, = 868/9 A.D.] he installed the nugget of gold, an auspicious natural Lińga that had been hymned by Gods and Asuras'. I leave unsolved the crux u u ãmrãtasya kalpitam , though I suspect a reference to the name of the Lińga and therefore to Āmrātesa/Āmrātesvara/Āmrātakesvara.</page><page sequence="64">4 1 2 Alexis Sanderson it follows that even if they are broken into pieces the deity will remain equally present in each of the fragments. That this view was held by the Khmers may be inferred from the fact that the purpose of the inscription that names this Linga is to report that a fragment of it, perhaps detached through erosion, was installed for worship in another place. Dating from the reign of Rājendravarman (944 -cĒ 968) the inscription tells us the following about Indrâyudha, a son of king Jayavarman II (r. 802-c. 834): präg èva campa [dhipa] tigrahaņe labdhavikramah tīrttvā kãlam va(yo) [vr] ddhau ś iv abhakt iparãyanah gantā liñgapu(ra)ñ citran tapah kastañ cakãra sah tatas sivãjhayã lingām aiśan niskalaliňgatah lavan tat sthãpi[ta]n t[e]na santūnāmni [p]ure mudã K. 583, v. 4c-6 (ed. Jacques 1976b) Jacques proposes plausibly that gantā in 7c is an error for gantvā After many years, having earlier achieved an act of great valour in capturing the king of Campa, he turned in his old age to devotion to Siva. He went to Lińgapura and performed various harsh austerities. Then at Siva's command he took a Linga of Siva that was a fragment [fallen] from the Linga [called] Niskala [on the summit of the mountain] and joyfully installed it in Santūpura. Two other Lińga fragments ( lingaikãmsau ), probably from the same source, are reported to have been installed for worship in Aninditapura by Sivâcârya, a Saiva officiant in the service of the four Khmer kings from Isānavarman II (r. c. 922 -c. 928) to Rājendravarman (r. 944-968). 243 That this Saiva dignitary should have chosen to install these fragments where he did is in keeping with his special connection with the Sivalinga already established there. Generally the opening verses of the Khmers' Sanskrit inscriptions offer praise or obeisance to one or more deities in their unlocated universality, with the principal deity at the head. In this case after venerating Siva, Visņu, Brahmā, Urnā and Sarasvatī in that manner he adds, most unusually, a verse of devotion addressed to the Sivalinga of Aninditapura. 244 Now the Bhadresvara enshrined on a terrace near the foot of Mt. Phu Kao and aligned with the natural Lińga on its summit appears to have been seen as the national deity, in a In K. 806, v. 27 we read of Rājendravarman that 'he increased the endowments of both the natural and the installed deities in Kambujadeśa': kam vu vis vambharãyãm yas tridasānām svayambhuvãm/ sthãpitãnãn ca yajvaiko bhūtvā pūjān avarddhayat. CœdèS missed the meaning of svayambhuvãm 'natural' and tridasānām here 'gods'. He took the former to mean 'gods' and the latter to indicate their number ('thirty'): 'il accrut le culte des trente dieux érigés sur la terre de Kambu'. The price of this reading was to overlook the conjunction ca. 243. K. 532, v. 27: lingām bhīmapure moghapure liňge ca sa vyadhãt / lingaikãmsau sabhīmārccāv aninditapure punah 'he installed one Lińga in Bhīmapura, two in Amoghapura, and two fragments of the Lińga and an image of Bhlma in Aninditapura'. I suppose that these may be fragments of the Niskalalińga because I know of no other natural Lińga that could be intended. 244. K. 532, v. 6: vande śrJś i val ińgakhyam śańkaram visvasaňkaram / animãdigunãnindyam aninditapurāspadam 'I venerate the Śańkara (Śiva) at Aninditapura, holy Šivaliňga by name, who bestows joy (-kankaram) upon the whole world who is [indeed] irreproachable (anindya-) because of [his possession of] the [eight supernatural] attributes [of godly power], minuteness (anima) and the rest.' Aninditapura is important in royal genealogies as one of three kingdoms, the other two being Śambhupura and Vyâdhapura, from which the early kings of Angkor had descended. But it is not mentioned before the reign of Yasovarman I (889-910) and its location is uncertain. Vickery (1998:384) considers it the puram of a lineage whose estate was somewhere between Kompong Thom and Kompong Cham, in the central part of modern Kampuchea.</page><page sequence="65">The Saiva Religion among the Khmers ( Part I) 413 role analogous to that of such South Asian Sivas as Natarāja of Cidambaram for the Tamils of the Far South and Paśupati of Deopatan for the inhabitants of the Kathmandu Valley. Thus we learn that the lineage of Vidyesa ( vidyesavit , vidyesadhJmãn ), 245 a Saiva Rājaguru of the fourteenth century, had emanated from an Indian Saiva called Sarvajñamuni who, we are told, had employed Yoga to transport himself from India (ãryadesah) to Kambujadeśa to worship Bhadresvara, mostly that of this site: 246 7 sa[r]vvapriyo bhavad vipras sarvvãgamavisãrada[h ] sarvvalokārthakrt nāmnā sarvvajñamunir īri [tah] 8 caturvve[da]nidher yyasya caturānanam āvabhau caturmmukhasyeva bhrśan caturvvedasa - u - 9 ãryya[de]se samutpannas sivārādhanatatparah yo yogenãgatah kamvudese smin[n] i u - u - 10 srībhaļdresvar asa] mbhor yy o y aj anārtham samãgatah cirakālan tam abhyarcya pray ay au parama [m] pa [dam] K. 300, w. 7-10 7a śa[ r] vvapriyo conj.

BERGAIGNE There was a brahmin devoted to Siva, skilled in all the [Saiva] Āgamas, acting for the good of all, called Sarvajñamuni. He had memorized the four Vedas and his skillful mouth loudly [reciting them] seemed like that of the four- faced [Brahmā] himself. He was born in Aryadesa and devoted himself to the propitiation of Siva. Having reached this land of Kambu by means of meditation [...] he came to worship Bhadresvarasiva and having done so for a long time proceeded [in death] to the ultimate goal. Moreover, an inscription composed during the reign of Dharaņīndravarman I (a.D. 1107-1113) by Yoglsvarapandita, grandson in the maternal line of Vīralaksmī, daughter of Sûryavarman I (r. 1002-c. 1050), in which he records his career as a Saiva officiant and his lavish donations to Bhadresvara, refers to the latter in terms that reveal that it was venerated as the source and guarantor of the supremacy of the Khmer emperors. In the first benedictory verse of that inscription Siva is revered in abstract, metaphysical terms as that from which all creation flows and as that into which all creation returns: yasmãt kramena sakala . i u -dbhavanti bhūtāni tantuvisarā iva f púlikãyãh t yatraiva tãni nidha - u u- ^nidīhat vyomnîva ta siva K. 258 C, v. 1 Emending the first quarter verse, restoring diagnostically the sense of the corrupt and lacunose second and third, and providing the last, whose engraving was not completed, with a makeshift ending of the kind required by the context, I propose: yasmãt kramena sakalãni samudbhavanti bhūtāni tantuvisarā iva lãtikãyãh yatraiva tãni nidhanam punar eva yãnti vyomnîva tam śiva[*m ahatn pranamãmi bhaktyã (?)] 245. I propose that the Sanskrit expressions vidyesavit and vidyesadhîmân that refer to him (K. 300, v. 40; K. 300, v. 103) are to be understood as metrical substitutes for the name-title Vidyesapandita/ Vidyesvarapandita, designations in -paņdita being standard for Khmer royal officiants. 246.

That the Bhadresvara mountain of this verse is the mountain of the Linga (Phu Kao) with Niskalalińga as its summit and the temple of Bhadresvara at its foot is evident from K. 723, an undated pre-Angkorean inscription from the largest of three caves 1500 metres north of Vat Phu, which refers to the consecration of that cave as a place for meditation and locates it "on the side of the Bhadresvara mountain". 248 247. Cœdès' s reading pülikäyäh, which he translated 'd'un écheveau' ('from a skein') is suspect. The word is not found to my knowledge in Sanskrit. At best one may postulate it on the basis of pūlah, pūlakah 'bunch, bundle'. But even so the sense is not apposite, because the term is used of grass or straw. I see two possibilities. The first is that pülikäyäh is an error for púnikãyãh 'from a roll of cotton' or 'from a spindle'. But this too invokes an unrecorded form, one for which we must rely on the Prakrit words pūņiā and poniã, which are attested in these two meanings respectively, though the analogy is somewhat less inapposite, and the syllables ņi and li could easily be confused. However, I have preferred to propose that the author intended lütikäyäh 'from a spider'. Though it is a step further away from the reading attested by Cœdès it provides an entirely appropriate sense. For the spider's emanating threads from within its body is well-attested in key Indian theological texts as a metaphor to illustrate how it is that the world can come forth from within its divine source, so that its efficient cause and its material cause (its nimittakāraņam and its upādānakāraņam) are one and the same, whereas the alternatives before us are not found to my knowledge. We see it in the Brhadãranyakopanisad 2.1.20, in the Vaidika-Pāsupata Svetāsvataropanisad 6.10 and Muņdakopanisad 1.1.7; and it was standard among those emanationist (pariņāmavādin -) Vedāntists who preceded or survived the illusionist reformation of Śańkara and Mandanamiśra. Thus it is invoked by Bhāskara Brahma- sütrabhäsya ad 2.1.14 (concerning Chãndogyopanisad 6.1.4: mrttikety eva satyam . apracyutasvabhãvasya saktiviksepalaksaņah / parinãmo yathã tantunãbhasya patatantuvat)' and it is challenged by the Mīmārņsaka Kumārila in Slokavārtika , Sambandhāksepaparihāra 50c-51, tacitly treating it as a standard argument by analogy. That such emanationism is rejected by the dominant tradition of learned theology within the Siddhānta, the mainstream Saivism whose rituals and observances were followed among the Khmers is not an argument against this reading. All three readings are equal in that regard, and the fact that those who propagated the Saiva dualism that strictly separated God as the efficient cause of the universe from mãyã as its inanimate material cause were followers of this ritual system does not require us to conclude that all its followers adhered to the same view. 248.

I propose, tentatively, that the noun in the accusative plural required in the lacuna by the context was patīn ( karttum sarvvamahībhrtām api patīn 'to make [the rulers ...] lords over all [other] kings') because it provides the required sense and fits both the metre and style. As for the last criterion, we see the same expression for the Khmer king as paramount ruler later in this same composition (K. 258 C, v. 6c) in the compounded form mahībhrtpatih and in the uncompounded form in another inscription. 249 It is also alliterative (api patīn) and echoed by paśupatih in the next Pāda. There is other evidence of the role of the Siva Bhadresvara of Vat Phu as the patron of the Khmer monarchs and thence as the protector of the Khmer realm. After re-occupying the temporarily abandoned city of Angkor (Yaśodharapura) and constructing his new capital on the south bank of the Yaśodharatataka or 'Eastern Baray', the vast water reservoir excavated by Angkor's founder Yasovarman I (r. 889-910), Rājendravarman (r. 944-968) established two eponymous Sivalingas, the first in 953 in the 'Eastern Mebon', a temple-complex on an island constructed for this purpose at the centre of that reservoir, and the second in 961/2 in the central tower at the summit of his pyramid-temple now known as Pre Rup, built at what was probably the centre of his capital. The name of the first of these Sivalingas was formed in accordance with the common practice observed in the Indie world for images of deities enshrined by individuals, that is to say, as a compound consisting of the distinctive part of the individual's name, or of that of a person designated for the honour, followed by a term indicating the universal deity invoked into the image for worship: -īsvara for a Siva, -svāmin, -mādhava or -nãrãyana for a Visņu, - svāmin or -âditya for a Sûrya, and -īsvarī for a goddess. 250 Bhadresvara, established to the extent of his ability by Vaktrasiva under the name Vaktraguha for the meditation practice of all ascetics'. 249.

For these naming conventions see, e.g., Mohacūrottara , ff. 34v9-35rl : yajamânasya yan nāma yojayed īsvareņa tu 'he should compound the name of the patron with -īsvara'; Bhojarāja, Siddhānta- sārapaddhati , f. 76r4: yajamãnãdyam īsvarāntam bhagavate nāma datvā 'after giving the deity a name that begins with [that of] the patron and ends in -īsvara'; Somaśambhupaddhati 4:227 (N-Iśvara for a Siva), 275 (N-īsvarī for a Goddess), 291 (N-svāmin or N-āditya for a Sun), 3 1 1 (N-svāmin or N-mādhava for a Visņu); īsānasivagurudevapaddhati Kriyãpãda , p. 446: yajamãnãbhidhãnãdyam *nameśvara(Qm. : nãmaisvarya Ed.)padāntakam 'the name, beginning with the name of the patron and ending with the word -īsvara'; Pratisthämayükha , p. 30b7: atha kartrnãmayutam devanãma kuryãt sarvadā vyavahãrãrtham 'For the sake of mundane transactions one should always give the deity a name compounded with that of the patron'. I interpret the last of these passages as pointing to the fact that the apparent individualization of the deity through the giving of this composite name is understood as a device that enables the deity in the principal image of the temple to be treated in law as the owner of the lands and other goods gifted by the founder and any subsequent benefactors. It has no further reality. The Śiva in an image is never worshipped under this name but only as Śiva pure and simple. That the legal fiction of ownership is the function of the name is implicit in Somaśambhupaddhati 4:227 (v. 46): hiranyapasubhümyädi gitavãdyãdihetave / amukeśaya tad bhaktyã saktyã sarvam nivedayet 4 With devotion he should make over all that he can, such as gold, domestic animals and lands "to N-īsvara" to [fund] the singing, instrumental music and other [expenses of the cult]'.

K. 286, v. 44cd; K. 872, v. 15; K. 528, v. 218. 252. The complex of the Lińga surrounded by the four images is compared to that of the five faces of Sadāsiva, the form of Śiva venerated in the Siddhānta, which was then the Šaivism of the state. Just as Sadāsiva has a superior upper face (īsāna) and four lesser faces below it (Tatpurusa, Aghora, Sadyojâta and Vāmadeva) looking in the four directions, so this Liriga shrine has four somewhat lower shrines around it forming the corners (SE, SW, NW, and NE) of a square of which it occupies the centre. For the quincunx layout of the uppermost level of the Rājabhadresvara temple (Pre Rup) see Jacques 1999, 76- 78. The secondary images, installed in the corner-shrines, were (1) a Rājendravarmesvara (SE) for the king's own benefit, (2) a Visņu Rāj endravi svampa whose purpose is not stated, (3) a Gaurl, probably called Rājendrešvari, for the salvation of his consort JayadevI, and (4) a Rājendravarmadevesvara for the welfare of his younger brother Harsavarman (K. 806, vv. 278-281). Cœdès translates liňgam ...agryam 'ce linga principal' as though it were related to others; but see the following close parallel in a Nepalese inscription of 468/9 a.D. in which another solitary liriga is so described: aisãnam liňgam agryam vidhivad anupamam sthãpayãm ãsa bhaktyã (Dh. VajrãCÂRYA 1973, No. 6). Cœdès reads kīrttim vaktum ...muditasya ...ãsyais caturbhis 'joyeux de proclamer sa renommée par quatre bouches brillantes', but this abandons the syntactic parallel and makes no sense: gods do not proclaim their fame and that is certainly not the function of Sadāsiva' s four lateral faces. On the other hand it is in keeping with Indie convention to say that the purpose of a religious installation is to enhance the founder's reputation ( kīrttih , yaśah ), that and the increase of merit (punyam , dharmah) being everywhere identified as the goals of such activity, for the founder, others, usually his parents, or both. See K. 53, v. 12: yo tisthipad imau devau sraddhayã bhūridaksiņau kīrttistambhāv ivodagrau 4 who installed these two gods with faith like two loft pillars of [his] fame, giving abundant fees'; K. 528, v. 202cd: sthãpayãm ãsa pitrņām dharmavrddhaye 'he established [it] to augment the merit of his ancestors'; K. 323, v. 59ab: imãs svasilparacitã gurūņām punyavrddhaye 'these [images] fashioned by his own craft to increase the merit of his elders'; K. 339, v. 39: khãtam idam mãtuh tatãkam punyavrddhaye 'this tank was excavated to increase the merit of his mother'; Lājimpāt inscription of Mānadeva (467/8 A.D.)

In the Tamil country Natarāja of Cidambaram became the family deity of the Cola emperors; 253 Paśupati in the Kathmandu valley is regularly invoked as the patron of the kings of that region from the seventh century to the present; 254 and the Gangas who conquered Orissa claimed the same relationship with Siva Gokarnasvāmin on Mt. Mahendra in the Ganjam district, as did the Solaiikis with Umāpatisiva, the Hoysala Yädavas with Vajresvarasiva,255 and the Guhilot kings of Mewar with Ekalingasiva. 256 The Rājendrabhadresvara of the Pre Rup pyramid-temple was evidently intended as a local double of the national deity, permanently accessible to the monarch at the heart of the new capital and no doubt visible from his palace (rājamandiram). No remains of this palace have yet been identified, perhaps because they have not been searched for with sufficient diligence. But JACQUES has proposed that in accordance with normal practice it would have been located directly to the north of the Rājendrabhadresvara temple, between it and the Yaśodharatataka and in alignment with both the Rājendrabhadresvara and Rājendresvara on the island at its centre. 257 The role of Bhadresvara as the sustainer of the king and his realm is confirmed by another passage of the same inscription: kamvuvisvambharãyãm yas tridasānām svayambhuvãm sthāpitānān cayajvaiko bhūtvā pūjām avarddhayat rãjendunã yena yathã yathã srī- bhadresvare dîyata mandalasrīh tathā tathāvarddhata niska laňka candraśriyam hrepayitum mudeva K. 806, vv. 270-271 Having become [as king] the unique worshipper of [all] the gods of Kambujadeśa, both the self-manifested and those installed, [Rājendravarman] increased their endowments. 253.

The special status of this Siva is also indicated by the fact that he was believed to have manifested a double of himself ( punarbhãva ) at Šikharesvara/Šikharīsvara (Preah Vihear): man [kamrajten jagat srībhadresvara liňgapura mok punarbhãva ãy srīsikharīsvara piy gi vrah tej ah tayal pratyaksa prãdurbhãva K. 380 E, 11. 3-5 Then the Lord of the World Bhadresvara of Lińgapura came to be born a second time in Šikharīsvara, so that the divine radiance {vrah tej ah) should be made manifest [there]. and to have been induced to do so by king Sûryavarman I (r. 1002-c. 1050) as the reward of his ascetic practice ( tapovîryya ): man kamrateň jagat srībhadresvara liňgapura ti vrah pãda kamraten kamtvan añ sñsüryyavarmmadeva sãdhya nu tapovîryya gi pi mok rãjya ãy srīsikharīsvara piy gi vrah tejah prãdurbhãva pratyaksa pi loka mel K. 380 E, 11. 58-60 Then the Lord of the World Srībhadresvara of Lińgapura, by the power of asceticism achieved by His Majesty Sûryavarman [I], came to rule in Šikharīsvara, to make his divine radiance {vrah tejah) visible, so that all the world could see it. This public manifestation of Siva's radiance was the installation of a Linga, as is revealed by parallel expressions. 258 The meaning, then, is that Sûryavarman I engaged in ascetic practices, probably in the vicinity of Bhadresvara, and was rewarded with a vision in which that god had instructed him to install a double {punarbhãva ) in the form of a Linga bearing this name at Preah Vihear. It is at least probable that this event was intended to be understood as a divine authorization of the king's rule, which we know to have been won by force of arms and after a long struggle. The theme of ascetic retreat from the world as enabling the seizing of power through conquest and as the support of its exercise is well- documented in Southeast Asian sources, among the Khmers, the Chams, and the Javanese; 259 and Preah Vihear was a site of special significance to this king's rule.

This theme is seen among the Chams in C. 66 = M. 31, the Dong Duong stele of Indravarman II (a.D. 875), A, vv. 18-21. There we are told the following. Bhadravarman's son Srï- Indravarma now rules ( nrpo bhavati) in the royal city of Campa ( campãnagare ), through the might of Siva ( māhesvaraprabhāvāt ) (18). The perfect sovereignty that the king has acquired is not simply an inheritance from his ancestors (19ab), the gift of his grandfather to his father and of his father to him (19cd). He has won it from Bhadrešvara as the exceptional award of his religious austerities (tapahphalavisesãt) [in many former lives (cf. prose after v. 37)], his pious actions, his wisdom and his valour (punyabuddhiparãkramãt ) (20-21). In Java we find the theme that the ideal king's career comprises ascetic preparation, victory through war and eventual retirement into life as a hermit. This pattern is ascribed to Pikatan, the Šaiva king of the Sañjaya dynasty in Central Java who expelled the Śailendras from Java in the mid-ninth century, and to the East Javanese conqueror Airlangga (r. 101 9 - 1 049) (Taylor 1992, 177-178). The latter is said to have spent four years in a hermitage on the mountain Vanagiri before he acceded to the pleas of the brahmans and other dignitaries that he should accept royal power (Cœdès 1968, 144-145). It is very probable that it was the latter's career that motivated his court poet Mpu Kaņva to compose his Arjunawiwäha (a.D. 1053), since that retells the myth derived from the Mahābhārata of the asceticism undertaken by Arjuna on the Indrakīla mountain to obtain from Siva the weapon that would bestow victory on the humiliated Pāņdavas (Henry 1986, 14, following Berg). The theme persisted after the arrival of Islam, being found in the Javanese chronicles ( babad ). Supomo (1997, 1:67), writes: "we often read in various babad , that a would-be rebel against a Javanese king, Dutch authority, or both, would invariably practice asceticism before embarking on his dangerous undertaking". 260. The others were at Jayaksetra (= Vat Baset in Battambang) in the west, Sûryâdri (= Phnom Chisor) in the south, and Isānatlrtha, presumably in the east. Jacques proposes (1999, 96-99) that it may have been by the Mekong river. Perhaps it was within the territory of the old kingdom of īsānapura in the Sen river valley to the east of the Tonlé Sap. The installation of these four Süryavarmesvaras is recorded in K. 380 E, v. 12: ekam srīkikharesvarādrikikhare srīsānaūrthe para[m] srîsûryyâdrisiloccaye nyad asame krîsûryya- varmmekvaram / Ungarn samyag asau kriyãdhikajayaksetre purātisthipat pascāt ürnaviyatpayodhivivarais krîsûryyavarmmâ trisu 'Süryavarman first installed a Süryavarmesvaraliñga in Śrijayaksetra and then, in 940 elapsed, in three [other sites], one on the summit of the hill of Šikharesvara, another at Isānatlrtha, and yet another on the summit of the hill of the Sun (SüryädriV. 261 .

Divākarapaņdita, after serving in lesser capacities under Udayâdityavarman II (r. 1050-1066) and Harsavarman III (r. 1066-1080), is said to have followed this practice as Vrah Guru under Jayavarman VI (r. 1080-1107), Dharaņīndravarman I (r. 1 107-1 1 12) and Sûryavarman II (r. 1 1 13-c. 1 150). We are told that after he had performed the royal consecration of Sûryavarman II, given him Šaiva initiation, taught him the Saiva scriptures and other branches of learning, and been invited to perform the Kotihoma and other annual brahmanical sacrifices for him, he was given golden palanquins and many other valuables so that he could visit various sacred sites around the kingdom and give these to the deities installed there, each engraved with a verse composed by the king himself to the effect that it was a gift to Śiva made by his revered Guru. The sites chosen for this purpose were five, of which the first three are clearly the most important: Bhadresvara, Sikharlsvara (Preah Vihear), and Šivapura Danden (Phnom Sandak). At each of these he had a water-reservoir excavated, founded a hermitage, gave it slaves and villages and made an endowment to provide for worship. Similarly, Sadāsiva Jayendrapandita, high priest of the royal Saiva cult of the Kamrateń Jagat ta Rāja (Devarāja) and Guru of Udayâdityavarman II, is praised for his constant lavish donations to 'Bhadresvara and other gods'. 263 kamsteňi ta ti duk ta sruk vibheda ta jmah kuruksetra īlū 'In 958 Saka, on the new moon day ot Magha in Pusya, under the asterism Dhanisthā, at midday. V.K.A. Śri Rājapativarman, grandson of V.K.A. Śri Rājapativarman the elder, of Sruk Avadhyapura, respectfully informs H.H. Sûryavarman [I] of the works of devotion of Śri Sukarmā Kamsteń on the occasion of the beginning of the works of fortification for the gods Sikharisvara and Vrddhesvara. He preserves with great effort the inventory [of goods received] since the time that the Śiva splendour of Sikharisvara was directly manifested to our senses ...There is a family that preserves the records of the Kambu lineage and the departments of the royal service, records of the splendid deeds of the kings from [those of] Srutavarman down to those of Sûryavarman I in the royal family of Indravarman who went to Isvaraloka and [down to those of] the queen Vīralaksmī Mahādevī of Vrac of the Vrah Sruk, relative of Harsavarman who went to Rudraloka and of īsānavarman who went to Paramarudraloka. The collection of the sacred records is kept on leaves stored in Sikharisvara, Vrddhesvara and Kanloń. He took the same oath of loyalty *following the same formula as Rājapativarman (?). So Sûryavarman I favoured Sukarmā and gave him royal goods and the Sruk Vibheda, inheritance of Prthivlnarendra being part of the goods of Mahldharavarman of Vrah Sruk. He ordered that [this decision] be engraved on a stone pillar in Šikharisvara and ordered it to be engraved on [another] stone pillar to be placed in the Sruk Vibheda given by him to Sukarmā in Sruk Vibheda, formerly called Kuruksetra'. 263. The account of Divākarapaņdita's offices and donations is given in K. 194, A9-B17. I he gitts of Sadāsiva Jayendrapandita are mentioned in K. 235, v. 119ab: manikanakamayãdi dyumnajãtam vadanyas satatam adita deve bhūri bhadresvarãdau 'A liberal donor, he constantly gave valuables made of jewels, gold and other [precious substances] in great abundance to Bhadresvara and the other deities'. Cœdès and Dupont (1943-46: 137-139) discuss this practice of redistributing royal gifts to the gods of the kingdom in the introduction to their edition of this inscription, considering both these passages. They also cite the case of the general Samgrāma. K. 289 D recounts his campaign against a chieftain called Slvat, who had attacked him in Prthuśaila. He defeated him at Prasãnvraimmyat and founded two hermitages dedicated to Šiva Bhadresvara at the site in this same year, giving one thousand cows and a hundred and twenty cows. The inscription records a further encounter near a temple of Visņu. Once again victorious he made donations to this god and having returned handed over the booty ( dhanāni hrtāni) to the king, Udayâdityavarman II. The king gave these riches back to the general as the reward of his loyal service. The general declined to accept them and asked that they be given to the king's subtle inner self,</page><page sequence="73">The Saiva Religion among the Khmers (Part I) 42 1 Neither Buddhism nor Vaisņavism offered the Khmers any deity so central to their collective identity and only Saivism had inscribed itself so deeply into the Khmers' sense of place, by establishing this and other doubles of the Sivas of ancient temple-sites of the Indian subcontinent and by locating natural, autochthonous Sivas in their landscape. Saivism and Khmer Vaisņavism Moreover, while Pāncarātrika Vaisņavism and Mahâyãna Buddhism flourished alongside Saivism, there are indications they were unable to escape its shadow. Thus Nârâyana, a Bhāgavata courtier of Jayavarman V (r. c. 970-1000), could found a Vaisņava hermitage and build a Visņu temple within it, but then install images of Nandin and Mahākāla to guard its entrance, although these two are the door-guardians prescribed in the Saiva systems for shrines of Siva. 264 cakãra cakrisaubhaktyãt samkrāntapadam asramam dāsīdāsahiraņyādidhanair äpürayac ca sah dviprasthañ cātra sucyannam dãtavyam prativãsaram triprasthadevayajñañ ca cakriņe so py akalpayat nandinam srīmahākālam dvãsstham visņor vvidhãya sah dviprastham anvahan tãbhyãm yajñan deyam akalpayat K. 256 C, v. 9-1 1 (= K. 814, v. 9-11) 9a saubhaktyãt conj. : saubhaktyã {saubhaktyã K. 814) Cœdès and Dupont265 • 10a dviprasthañ cātra śucyannam conj. : dviprastham tadā sucyannam Cœdès and Dupont266 Out of his great devotion to Visņu he founded the Samkrāntapada hermitage and filled it with male and female slaves, gold and other valuables.

See Pancãrthabhãsya ad Pāsupatasūtra 1.9; Somasambhupaddhati 1:95; Suryasevana p. 135; Svacchanda 2.25 and Netratantra 3.9; Ksemarāja ad Svacchanda 2.25 and Netratantra 3.9; and Tantrāloka 15. 183-1 88b. 265. The emendation saubhaktyãt cannot be supported by any citation of this word; but it is well- formed as an abstract from subhakta- 'very devoted, very loyal' (cf. such words as saugandhyam and saubhãgyamX whereas saubhaktyã , which could only be understood to mean subhaktyã , is an implausible solecism. 266. The version of K. 814 is given by Cœdès and Dupont as catuhprastha - sucyannam , reporting that the syllable after stha is cã or cchā with tra written beneath. The reading dviprastham tadā sucyannam accepted by Cœdès and Dupont in K. 256 C is unmetrical. 267. The word sucyannam 'pure food' is a Vaisņava usage. In our Old Khmer inscriptions sucyanna and samvibhāga are in the worship of Visnu what caru and naivedya are in that of Śiva and the Goddess. See K. 989 B, 1. 47- C, 1. 1. For this usage among Indian Vaisnavas see Rahasyãmnãya cited and discussed by Vedāntadešika in his Saccaritraraksā , p. 90, 11. 7-10, also Alaśińgabhatta ad Sātvatasamhitā 6. 1 8 1 c- 1 82 : ... odanapacane sucyannam srapayitvã vedyãm bhagavate nayati ....</page><page sequence="74">422 Alexis SANDERSON The deities required at the entrance to a Vaisņava shrine are Canda and Pracaņda. 268 There is further evidence of the intrusion of Šaivism into the Vaisņavism of the Khmers if the great temple established by Sûryavarman II (r. 1113-c. 1150) and now known as Angkor Vat was originally dedicated to Visņu, as is probable and generally accepted. In the bas-relief on the wall of the eastern section of its southern gallery thirty- two hells are depicted, each with an accompanying Khmer legend that names it and identifies the kinds of sinners being punished in it. 269 Now the schema of thirty-two hells is distinctively Saiva. It is taught in the Šaiva scriptures Nisvãsamukha , Matańga (VP 23.74-8 lb), Parakhya (5.1 1- 32b), and Kiraņa ( Vidyãpãda 8.7-1 le). There is some small variation among these sources in the names or identities of the hells, and no scriptural list known to me agrees exactly with that of the Angkor Vat bas-relief. But there is a particularly close agreement, both in names and in their order, with that of the Nisvãsamukha . 270 In any case all the Saiva lists are closer to that of Angkor Vat than are those seen in brahmanical and Vaisņava sources. 271 But more telling than this is the fact that the inscriptions identifying the categories of sinners who are punished in these hells disclose an unambiguously Šaiva perspective. For they include persons who have committed offences against Šiva or his devotees but none who have committed sins against Visņu or Vaisņavas. 272 Thus: kriminicaya . anak ta nindã devatã vrah vleň. guru. vrãhmana. mahãjnãna . anak ta pradau dharmma. anak ta sivabhakti. ame. vapã. suhrt.

He considered that it did not contradict the exclusively Vaisņava character of the bas-reliefs of Angkor Vat, on the ground that the inscriptions might be a little later than the bas-reliefs and that they may therefore have been executed after the fashion for Vaisņavism had receded in favour of Šaivism, the persistent primary religion. This hypothesis is weakened by the fact that, as we have seen, the bas-reliefs of the hells are themselves Šaiva in inspiration. Cœdès wrongly thought the inspiration to be Buddhist (1911, 207-8). 273. These inscriptions were published by Aymonier (1883), then, with some corrections ot Aymonier's readings by Cœdès (1911). They have now been re-edited by Pou (2001, 156-163) with notes and some unremarked deviations from the text of Cœdès.

The characters th- and j- are similar enough in the Khmer script, as are p- and y-, to be easily confused; and the emendation replaces the puzzling reference to those who keep Siva's flowers in their huts with exactly what we find in the Sanskrit parallel: 'those who wear them [on their heads] (duk) and those who smell [them] (thep)' . Only the order of the two is different. 276 274. The Khmer text suggests that it might be based on a variant of this verse with the reading mahājnānam rather than mahãtmãnam. The meaning is any case the same. 275. See Pou 1992, 191 ab and 545b (s.v. hajaya). Her evidence for this meaning is the hapax legomenon hajaya K. 324a (NIC II- III, 62-64), 1. 36 (9th century): cmām hajaya tai kanlak 'Guard of the hajaya : the female servant Kanlak', and Middle and Modern Khmer jai. See also Pou 2001, 163 (ad loc.). But only the meaning of jai would seem to be certain. Cœdès (1911, 207) saw no meaning in duk jey sin and so attempted no translation. 276. The point of the rule against smelling the flowers for worship, that is to say, deliberately inhaling their fragrance, is that having been enjoyed by another they become impure and therefore unfit to be offered to the deity. See, e.g., Paramasamhitã 5.29cd: anyair anupayogas tu sarvesām suddhir uttamā 'the highest purity is not to have been used by others'; 5.46c^ł7b: bhuktaśesam parimlānam asprśyasprstam èva ca II puspam vihitam apy etam ãpatkãle 'pi varjayet 'He should avoid these flowers though enjoined [for offering] if they have been already enjoyed, if they are faded and if they have been touched by an untouchable, even in times of dire distress'.</page><page sequence="76">424 Alexis SANDERSON Šaivism and Khmer Buddhism As for Mahâyâna Buddhism, whose presence among the Khmers is apparent from the seventh century onwards in images of the Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara, that too received extensive patronage from the Khmer élite, 277 particularly during the reigns of Jayavarman V (c. 970-1000) and Jayavarman VII (1181 - c. 1210), both of whom, but especially the latter, were active supporters and adherents of this form of Buddhism. Indeed Jayavarman VU' s vast and grandiose program of Buddhist temple and monastery building was evidently part of a conscious attempt to supplant Saivism as the dominant religion, empowering it to take over the roles of protecting the state, validating its hierarchies and sanctioning the authority of the emperor. The Mahâyâna was already well placed to do this, especially since it had provided itself through the Way of Mantras ( mantranayah , mantrayãnam ) with an elaborate and impressive system of rituals designed along Šaiva lines to offer its royal patrons exactly the protective and apotropaic benefits promised by their rivals. However, the Mahâyânist versatility of method ( upãyakausalam ) that enabled this development went a step further among the Khmers. For they adopted the Šaiva practice of installing deities under names that incorporate that of the founder. Moreover, in the case of Lokesvara, these names end in -îsvara, as do those of Šiva-images. Indeed in one case such a Lokesvara is even referred to as a Lińga, a surprising inroad from Šaiva terminology, in which litigam denotes all three varieties of Šiva image, namely the Lińga proper ( avyaktam lińgam, 277. For seventh- and eighth-century images of two-armed Avalokitesvara see Jessup and Zéphir 1997, nos. 7-10. Images of the four-armed and eight-armed Avalokitesvara generally called Lokesvara in the inscriptions abound in the Angkorean period; see ibid., nos. 59, 95-98. The earliest epigraphic reference to Lokesvara is K. 244 of A.D. 791/2: samagunasasinagasāke prathito yas supratisthito bhagavān / jagadisvara iti nãmnã sa jayati lokesvarapratimah 'Victorious is the renowned Lord well installed in Šāka 713 under the name Jagadisvara in the likeness of Lokesvara'. Inscriptions record many installations of Lokesvara, the Buddha, and the goddess Prajnāpāramitā, the Perfection of Wisdom who is the Mother of the Buddhas (jinamãtã K. 273, v. 36; jinānām janariī K. 273, v. 5); and there is material and epigraphic evidence of the currency of the worship of those three as a triad on a single base, a meditating Buddha seated on the coils of the Nāga Mucilinda being flanked by attendant standing figures of the other two; see, e.g., Jessup and Zéphir 1997, no. 95. We also find a tetrad comprising these and Vajrin (= Vajrapāņi, the wrathful defender of the faith); see ibid., no. 59, where they appear on the four sides of a small Caitya. The cult of Ekādasamukha, the eleven-faced Avalokitesvara, was also present. K. 168 of A.D. 973 records gifts of slaves and other valuables to Ekādasamukha, Lokesvara and BhagavatI (Prajnāpāramitā). The popularity of this cult in the early phase of the development of the Mantranaya within Mahâyâna is shown not only by the survival of its principal scriptural authority, the Ekãdasa- mukhadhāraņī , among the sixth-to seventh century manuscripts of the Gilgit horde (ed. Dutt 1939, 35- 40), but also by the existence of three Chinese versions (Taishõ 1070, translated by Yaśogupta around the middle of the sixth century, Taishõ 1071, translated by Xuanzang in 656, and Taishõ 1069, translated by Amoghavajra at some time between 720 and 774) and by its conspicuous role in the religious rituals of Japan during the eighth century (Abé 1999, 159-176). By the time of Jayavarman V, if not earlier, the more esoteric, Vairocana-centred Mantranaya of the Yogatantra that reached China in the eighth century and Japan in the ninth, was in vogue among the Khmers (K. Ill, see below n. 284; K. 240-241, which refers to a donation to the deity Trailokyavijaya (1. 2), for whose position in the Buddhist Yogatantra tradition see Linrothe 1999, 26, 178-21 1, 214-215); and by the late twelfth century the cult of Hevajra, a major deity of the Buddhist Yoginîtantras that followed the phase of the Yogatantras in India, was flourishing there, as can be seen by many surviving images (Lobo 1997; Jessup and Zéphir 1997, nos. 99-102), though by no epigraphic reports.</page><page sequence="77">The Šaiva Religion among the Khmers (Part I) 425 niskalam lingaiti), the anthropomorphic image (sakalam lingami), and the hybrid Lińga with Siva's faces ( vyaktãvyaktam lińgam , sakalaniskalam lingām). 278 Jayavarman VII adopted this practice of installing deities incorporating his name, evidently for the glorification of himself and his lineage, in his two vast foundations at Angkor, the Rājavihāra (Ta Prohm) and the Jayasrînagarî (Preah Khan). In 1 186/7 he had an image of Prajnāpāramitā with the likeness and name of his devout Buddhist mother Jayarājacūdāmaņi installed as the presiding deity of the former, 279 and in 1 191/2 he had a Lokesvara embodying his father installed with his own name (Jayavarmesvara) as the presiding deity of the latter. 280 He also installed Jayabuddhamahânâthas, images of the Buddha incorporating his name, in many sites throughout his realm281 and ordained that every year during the month of Phālguna these should be invited to the temple of the Lokesvara Jayavarmesvara, together with the "Eastern Buddha", the Buddha VIrasakti ( vīrasaktisugatah),2*2 the Buddha of Phimai ( vimãyasugatah ), the Prajnāpāramitā Jayarājacūdāmaņi of the Rājavihāra, and Bhadresvara, Cāmpesvara, Prthusailesvara and the other major deities of the realm, in all one hundred and twenty-two. 283 This must have 278. The Sanskrit portion of K. 239 records the installation in A.D. 961/2 of a - u- kesvaralingam ...prāsādam (S, 1. 13, v. 7) by Bhadratiśaya, a servant of King Rājendravarman. The text begins with obeisance to the Three Jewels and the donor prays that the merit of the act should go to his mother, father, the king, [his] guru, his kinsman and his friend, and that by means of this good deed he may be a Bodhisattva in life after life in order to save people drowning in the ocean of incarnation. The Khmer portion of the inscription records the consecration in A.D. 966 of bricks offered to V.K.A. srl Jagannāthakesvara (1. 23) and donations to him of various paddy-fields. This deity is surely the same as that of the - u- kešvaraliňgam ...prāsādam of the Sanskrit text, though the metre precludes exactly that name. Given the context and the name in -Isvara it is highly probable that this deity was a Lokesvara. We may compare the Lokesvara Jagadlsvara of K. 244. 279. K. 273, v. 36-37: prātisthipac chrījayarāja*cūdāmaņim (corr. : cūddāmaņim Ep.) manidyotita- punyadehãm / tasyãn jananyã jinamātrmūrttim mūrttim samürttidyusasañkarüpaih / so tisthipac chrījayamangalār[tha] devam tathã srîjayakîrttidevam / mūrttim guror daksiņavāma - yas sastim kate dvau parivāradevān 4 In [Šāka] 1108 he installed Jayarājacūdāmaņi, an image of the Mother of the Buddhas. Its body was illuminated by its jewels and it incorporated his mother. He installed a Jayamangalarthadeva and a Jayaklrtideva, embodying his Guru, to its left and right, and two hundred and sixty deities as its retinue'. 280. K. 908, v. 34-35: sa srîjayavarmmanrpas 'srîjayavarmmesvarâkhyalokesam / vedendu- candrarūpair udamïlayad atra pitrmūrttim / ãryãvalokitesasya madhyamasya samantatah / satadvayan trayosîtis tena devãh pratisthitãh 'In [Śaka] 1113 that king Jayavarman [VII] installed here a Lokeśa called Jayavarmesvara embodying his father. Two hundred and eighty-three deities were installed around this central Avalokitesvara'. 281. K. 908, v. 11 5-1 2 lb. This says that Jayavarman installed a Jayabuddhamahânâtha at each of twenty-three listed locations (120c-121b: trayovimśati*deśesv [em. : devesv Cœdès] esv ekaikasminn atisthipat / jayavuddhamahãnãtham srīmantam so variīpatih). But in v. 159 it speaks of the Javabuddhamahānāthas of the twentv-five locations (iavavuddhamahãnãthãh pancavimsatidesakãh). 282. This Buddha is probably the "god VIrasakti" mentioned in Jayavarman 's Rājavihāra foundation stele, K. 273, v. 85: bhagavãn bhagavatyãsau *caturddasyãm (corr. Cœdès : caturddhasyãm Ep.) pradaksiņam / trih kuryyãt *paurņamāsyān (corr. : paurnamãsyan Cœdès) ca vïrasaktyâdibhis suraih 'On the fourteenth [of Caitra] and on the full moon day the [Buddha] and the goddess [Prajnāpāramitā] should circumambulate [the temple] three times, keeping it on their right side, together with VIrasakti and the other gods'. K. 240 N comprises the words kamrateù jagat srî jayavîrasaktimahâdeva. This, given that it is found on a Buddhist temple, is no doubt the same deity rather than a Šiva (Mahādeva). 283. K. 908, v. 158-160: atrãdhyesyã ime devāh phālguņe prativatsaram / prãcyo munīndraš srījayarājacūdāmanis tathā / jayavuddhamahãnãthãh pancavimsatidesakāh / šrīvīrašaktisugato vimãya- sugato pi ca / bhadresvaracãmpesvaraprthusailesvarâdayah / satadvāvimsatis caite piņditāh</page><page sequence="78">426 Alexis SANDERSON entailed processions (yãtrã) in which their festival images - we may presume that their primary images remained in place - were transported in palanquins (, sibikã ) over considerable distances into the presence of the king's personal Lokesvara in the capital in a ceremony that mirrored that in which subordinate rulers would come before their overlord to demonstrate their dependence and loyalty. The inscription that records these arrangements listed twenty-three sites throughout the kingdom in which Jayavarman VII established a Jayabuddhamahânâtha. But when it speaks of the annual visit of these Buddhas to the temple of Lokesvara Jayavarmesvara it gives their number as twenty-five. Perhaps this is a lapse. But that would be surprising in an inscription that contains a great deal of precise numerical information on the funding of the foundation, the various classes of personnel engaged to serve in it, and its deities. I propose that the number has risen because the author's list was of provincial Jayabuddhamahãnãthas and that there were two others in the capital or its vicinity that were to be included in the total in the context of the annual visit. It is probable that one of the additional two was the image presiding in the Bayon, the great temple constructed by Jayavarman VII at the centre of his ceremonial capital Angkor Thom. The broken fragments of a Buddha were found at the bottom of a deep shaft under the tower in which the image would have been housed, perhaps, as has often been suggested, having been thrown there during the anti-Buddhist Saiva backlash after the end of this reign. That Jayavarman VII installed a Buddha here is in any case highly probable. The Bayon, the Jayaśrinagari and the Rājavihāra, his three principal Buddhist foundations, would thus have been dedicated to the Buddha, Lokesvara, and Praj nāpārami tā respectively, completing the triad whose worship as a set, on a single base with the Buddha in the centre, is a well attested feature of Buddhist devotion during this period. That it should have been a personal Buddha is intrinsically probable in the light of his policy in his other foundations, and that it should have a personal Buddha in his own name is also probable, since that would have accomplished a further symmetry: his personal Buddha in the Bayon at the centre of Angkor Thom with a Lokesvara and Praj nāpārami tā embodying his father and mother in Jayaśrinagari and the Rājavihāra outside its walls. That this cult of the personal deity-image was adopted from Saivism, and in Kambujadeśa itself, cannot be demonstrated conclusively. But it is very probable. It is less than certain because it rests on an inference from an absence of evidence that this practice was ever adopted by Buddhists in India together with the assumption that though the installation of deities incorporating the name of the founder was also practised in Pāncarātrika Vaisņavism, the preponderance of Šaivism in the religion of the Khmer state makes that an improbable source. My assertion that Buddhist images were not personalized in India through the incorporation of their founder's name is, of course, a claim that further research or the greater knowledge of others may easily refute, since even a single example of the practice would suffice for this purpose. But in this case the inference of absence from the absence of evidence is somewhat strengthened by the fact we find no evidence of the practice in a context in which we would expect to see evidence if it existed. This is the record of the religious foundations of pre-Islamic Kashmir in parivārakaih. K. 254 (Sanskrit, vv. 28-29; Khmer, B 1. 44-d, 1. 42) details benefactions in 1 127 for the Šiva Lirigapuresvara / Kammrateri Jagat Lińgapura, the Šiva of Prthuśaila (Phnom Roung, north of the Dang Raek range) / Kammrateri Jagat Vnam Run, the Visņu of Cāmpesvara / Vrah Kānti Kammrateri Añ Šrīcāmpesvara, and the Buddha of Varnsārāma / Kammrateri Jagat Chpā Ransi. In K. 289, C, v. 32 the military commander Sarņgrāma makes donations to Prthusailasiva and requests him to grant him success in his campaign to seize the rebel Kamvau during the reign of Udayadityavarman II (1050-1066): prthusailakivam prãpya samyag ãrãdhya so dhiyã / datvā rairūpyanāgendrān arīndrāptim ayãcata.</page><page sequence="79">The Saiva Religion among the Khmers (Part I) 427 Kalhana's chronicle of the dynasties of that kingdom (Rājatarangiņī), completed in A.D. 1149/50. In Kashmir, as in Kambujadeśa, Buddhism, Saivism and the Pāncarātra were able to flourish side by side. In nearly all the cases of Saiva and Vaisņava foundations established by the kingdom's rulers and high dignitaries the deity installed or the Matha constructed has a name that incorporates that of the donor at its beginning, or that of a person that he or she has designated. But not one of the Buddhas whose installation he records - and they appear together with those of Šivas, Visņus and other gods - has a personal name of any kind. The only Buddhist foundations in Kalhana's history with names incorporating the donor's are monasteries ( vihãrah ). What is more, even when royal support for Buddhism was at its most fervent, it seems to have been unwilling or unable to oust Šaivism completely from the circle of royal and state ritual. Nor did Buddhist fervor divert the monarchy from its traditional obligation to uphold the brahmanical Dharmasāstra that the Saivas had always accepted as binding in the sphere of law and other mundane transactions. An undated inscription of the reign of Jayavarman V (K. Ill) records his ordinances for the conduct of religion in the Buddhist monasteries of his realm. It also reports that one Kīrtipaņdita, a learned follower of the Mahâyâna and an expert in the esoteric Mantra rites of the Yogatantra, 284 was adopted by the royal family as their Guru, giving them many sermons on the Buddhist religion while seated on the Dharma throne (&lt; dharmãsanam ), 285 and that he was engaged within the royal palace to perform frequent 284. The evidence that he was a follower of the Yogatantra form of the Buddhist Way of Mantras is as follows. In K. 1 1 1 , v. 23 he is said to have been devoted to the four Mudrās: catussandhyãsu yogãtmã caturddānānvito nvaha[m] caturmmudrātmako dharmmañ catusparsatsu *yo disat (conj. : yo u uCŒDÈS) 'Devoted to meditation at the four junctures of the day, a giver of the four gifts, one with the four Mudrās, he taught the Dharma to the four congregations'. The four Mudrās are a distinguishing mark of this system; see, e.g., Mkhas grub rje, Rgyud sde spy 'i mam par gźag pa rgyas par brjod (Lessing and Wayman 1980), pp. 226, 1. 28-248, 1. 7. He is said in vv. 28-29 to have resuscitated the long neglected study of the Madhyavibhãgasãstra (= the Madhyãntavibhãgasãstra of Maitreya) (v. 28: sāstram madhyavibhãgãdyam dīpam saddharmmapaddhateh / kāladosāniladhvastam bhüyo jvãlayati sma yah) and to have sought from abroad and taught the Laksagrantha Prajnāpāramitāsūtra and the tattvasahgrahaūkāditantram (v. 29: *laksagrantham (corr. : laksagraņtham Ep.) abhiprajñam yo nvesya pararāstratah / tattvasaňgraha- tīkāditantran cãdhyãpayad yamí). Cœdès took the Tattvasamgrahatīkā mentioned here to be Kamalasīla's commentary on Šāntaraksita's Tattvasamgraha. It appears more probable that having mentioned sources of the two major branches of the Sūtra tradition of the Mahay äna he now speaks of the complementary Way of Mantras, saying that Kīrtipaņdita "taught the Tantra teachings ( tantram ) of such texts as the Tattvasamgraha and its commentary", that title being an abbreviation, as commonly in Indian sources, for the Sarvatathãgatatattvasamgraha , the principal scripture of the Yogatantras. This combination of the exoteric and esoteric divisions of the mature Mahâyâna is also referred to in v. 42: vãhyam guhyañ ca saddharmmam sthãpayitvã cakãra yah I pūjārthan tasya samghasyãtithes ca prthag āsramān 'Having propagated the Buddhist religion in both its exoteric and esoteric forms he founded separate hermitages to honour the monastic community and [lay] guests'. That the Way of Mantrayâna was also established in Jayavarman's monasteries is clear from the fact that this inscription requires each such institution to engage an officiant {purohitah) who must be "adept in the heart[-syllable]s, Mudrās, Mantras and Vidyâs, and in the ritual of the fire-sacrifice, and who must understand the secret doctrines of the Vajra and the Bell" (v. 69: *hrnmudrāmantravidyāsu (corr. : hrnmûdramantravidyâsu Ep.) homakarmmaņi kovidah / bajra- ghantârahasyajno daksinîyah purohitah). 285.

The plural rājabhih I take to be a plural of respect ( ādare bahuvacanam). On the Dharma throne see, e.g., Suvarņabhāsottamasūtra , Pari varta 6, p. 11 -IS. According to that account when the king wishes to hear</page><page sequence="80">428 Alexis SANDERSON rituals for the averting of dangers (, sãntih ), the promoting of welfare (pustih) and similar ends, for the protection of the kingdom. 286 But the same inscription, in spite of its purely Buddhist focus, praises Jayavarman V for guiding his subjects in strict accordance with the precepts of brahmanical Smrti and Śruti. 287 Moreover, the royal high-priest Divākarabhatta praises him as a devotee of the Saiva Path of Mantras, that is to say, of the Tantric Saivism of the Siddhānta, which implies that like other major Khmer monarchs he had received Saiva initiation at the time of his elevation to the throne in 970 or shortly thereafter. 288 Since the Buddhist inscription is undated we are not able to assume that his involvement in Saivism and Buddhism were contemporaneous. He may have been committed to Saivism around the time of his accession and then turned to Buddhism later. Nor may we assume from Divākarabhatta's claim that Jayavarman "delighted" (rarãmá) in the Saivism of the initiate that his commitments to Saivism and Buddhism were of a similar kind. It is all too possible that his Saiva initiation and subsequent involvement in the Path of Mantras were matters of social convention dictated by his position in the state, and that his personal faith in Buddhism was already present at that time. That his Buddhism was indeed a matter of personal conviction is clear enough from his relationship with Kīrtipaņdita and his drawing up of regulations to govern the [royal] monasteries. It is confirmed by the name Paramavlraloka he was given after his death. For it was the custom among the Khmers, as it was among their neighbours the Chams, to give their kings posthumous name that expressed the belief that the bearer had ascended to the paradise (-loka, -pura) of a certain god or to some other goal (-pada) of [their] religious endeavour. 289 In the great majority of cases this world or goal is Saiva. But there are a few the Suvarņabhāsottamasūtra he should sprinkle the palace with scented water, scatter it with flowers, set up a high, richly adorned Dharma throne for the preacher (&lt; dharmabhāņakah ), decorating the place with chowries, parasols, banners and pennants, and a lower throne for himself on which he is to sit and listen without any thoughts of his royal power. 286.

Among these are this posthumous name of Jayavarman V and that of Jayavarman VII: Mahāparamasaugatapada. The latter is obviously Buddhist, since it means that the bearer has attained the domain (padam) reached by those who are supremely devoted to the Buddha (paramasaugatah ). The former is less obviously so, but it too must be Buddhist, since vīrah is a common epithet of the Buddha and is not found in Saiddhāntika Saiva, Pāncarātrika or brahmanical usage in any appropriate sense that would allow an alternative interpretation. I propose, therefore, that it is equivalent to Paramabuddhaloka and so testifies to the king's personal devotion as opposed to what may have been no more than religious obligations imposed by his position. 290 As for Jayavarman VII, the intense commitment to Buddhism manifest in his vast architectural undertakings might have been expected to entail that those who sang his praises in the inscriptions would have presented him in purely Buddhist terms, so that we would find no evidence of involvement in the earlier tradition of royal devotion to Siva. But on the stele in front of the chapel of Lokesvara in the south-western corner of Angkor Thom a eulogy of this king speaks of him as having Siva permanently in his heart: srastur manobhūr gatavãn mano pi krodhãdibhis svair anugair nu dūram nirasya nityasthitasûlibhîtyâ tãn yasya citte vahirangalīnah K. 288, v. 24 [When] Love, deprived of his material form entered the mind of the creator [Brahmā], [he did so] with Anger and his other attendants. [But when] he entered the heart of [Jayavarman] [he] surely [did so only] after banishing them afar, because he feared Siva (-iw//-), who was ever present [there]. 291 With this we may compare the following in a eulogy of Indravarman I (r. 877-before 889): the teacher of the son of Paramesvara [Jayavarman II], King Jayavarman [III] who is in Visņuloka' (K 256A, v. 6); and in K. 826, v. 30 we see sa visnusvāmināmānam murārātim atisthipat / visnulokaprayãtasya bhütyai srîjayavarmmanah 'He established a Visņu with the name Visņusvāmin for the welfare of Jayavarman [III] who had gone to Visņuloka'.

The posthumous name Paramabuddhaloka is seen among the Chams as that of the ninth-century king Indravarman II (C. 67 = M. 36, p. 101). For vīrah as a name of the Buddha see, e.g., the vocatives vīra addressed to the Buddha in the devotional Satapancãkatka of Mātrceta, vv. 1 9c, 45c, and 87d. 291. When Love had tried to distract Śiva from his meditation with feelings of desire for Urnā, Śiva had punished him by reducing his body to ashes with the fire from his third eye. Love thus disembodied was able to enter the mind of the Creator (Brahmā, Prajāpati), and did so along with anger and the other moral taints that accompany love in lower beings. But Siva was permanently present in the heart of the King. So Love dared to enter there only after dismissing this company, lest Siva, who had already destroyed his outer form, be angered by this contamination of his presence and destroy him altogether. The poet thus proclaims the king's moral perfection. If he allowed himself to feel carnal desire it was because he could not otherwise fulfill his duty to his subjects by fathering a son. This is a variant of an ancient theme in the brahmanical portrayal of the ideal king. See, e.g., Raghuvamka 1.7d: prajãyai grhamedhinām 'marrying [only] for offspring'.</page><page sequence="82">430 Alexis SANDERSON adhyãste y asy a hrdayam naiva kãmo nirantaram tatsannihitacandrãrddhacúdãmanibhayãd iva K. 713, v. 12 Carnal love never entered his heart, as though out of fear of [the god] who wears the digit of the moon on his crest, [since he was] ever (nirantaram) present there. 292 It seems, then, that this reference to Jayavarman VII's devotion to Siva is conventional praise, part of the stock in trade of royal eulogy. But the fact that it was not considered inappropriate to use it in his case is significant. It is hard to believe that it could have been used if Jayavarman VII would have found that it misrepresented his religious sensibilities. Similarly, in the same inscription the king is claimed to have been an offerer of sacrifices to Siva: dakšo mahesapratipãditestir mahesvaro dhvamsitakālakūtah jisņus svadãrair niyatas sudhīr yo daksesvarendrāl laghayãn cakāra K. 288, v. 91 That wise [king] surpassed Daksa, for he was daksah (a skilled [ruler]) and offered sacrifices to Śiva [unlike Daksa who refused to do so]. He surpassed Mahesvara (Siva) for he was a great lord ( mahesvarah ) and eliminated the dishonesty of the [Kali] Age (&lt; dhvamsitakālakūtah ) [unlike Mahesvara, who did not destroy the Kālakūta poison (&lt; dhvamsitakālakūtah ) since though he saved the world from its effects by imbibing it, it remains forever visible in the dark colour of his throat]; and he surpassed Jisņu (Indra), for he was jisņuh (victorious in battle) and faithful to his wife [unlike Jisņu (Indra), who took many consorts]. Finally, a verse of this inscription compares him to a Śaiva Guru through terms with double meanings, one pertaining to the role of that Guru as the saver of souls through initiation and the other to the king's skill in governance: gurur ninīsur bhuvanãni mantraiś sivan dhruvam mantravidām varisthah vidhüya drstiprativandhabhūtan tamo nvagãdyas samayãn asesan K. 288, v. 79 Wishing to bring mankind to *eternal Siva / lasting welfare* by means of *the Mantras / his policies* [this] Guru who was the foremost among *the Masters of Mantras / experts in politics* banished the darkness that was the obstacle to knowledge and honoured his pledges. This might be thought to mean that he too had received Šaiva initiation, because the function of that ritual is believed to be to remove the substance Impurity ( malah ) that prevents the soul from experiencing the deployment of its innate Siva-ness and because 292. A variant of this verse is v. 19 of K. 826 of A.D. 881/2, also in praise of this king: na sthãtum aśakad yasya hrdaye kusumãyudhah / tatsannihitacandrãrddhacúdãmanibhayãd iva 'The Flower-Bowed [Love God] could not dwell in his heart, as though it was afraid of [the god] who wears the sliver of the moon on his crest, [since he was] present there'.</page><page sequence="83">The Saiva Religion among the Khmers (Part I) 43 1 "darkness" ( tamah ) is one of the terms used by the Saivas to denote this Impurity. 293 Moreover, the term samayãn that I have translated 'pledges' is that used by the Saivas to refer to the special rules that bind the conduct of persons once they have been initiated. But to compare his governance to the giving of initiation in the first half of the verse and then to report the king's having received initiation in the second seems excessively lame and muddled. If the whole verse is about the king's governance of his subjects compared in all four quarters with the benefit bestowed by a Saiva Guru on his disciples, then the effect, though not compelling, is at least coherent. It would in any case be improper to say that the person who receives initiation dispells his own darkness. That is the function of the officiant or rather of Siva acting through him; and the alternative, that we are being told that Jayavarman was himself a Saiva officiant, is very improbable. That the political sense of the last two quarters lacks attack is a lesser defect than overall incoherence. Perhaps he was referring in the third quarter to the king's exercise of his duty to promote knowledge, certainly evident in his generous provision for education in the Rājavihāra (Ta Prohm), and in the fourth to his loyalty to his followers. Even so, the very fact that the king's conduct towards his subjects is compared to that of a Saiva Guru towards his disciples shows clearly that the Buddhism of Jayavarman VII was not defined by any radical and intolerant exclusion of Saivism either by the king himself or by those who like the author of this eulogy wished to win or maintain his favour. The same conclusion follows from the plan of the Jayaśrinagari. Two hundred and eighty-three deities are said to have been enshrined around Lokesvara Jay avarmes vara, the king's personal deity at its centre. In addition to various Buddhist deities installed to the south and east of it thirty gods lead by [Visņu] Cāmpesvara were installed to its west and forty lead by [the Siva of] Šivapāda to its north. 294 The complex is likewise said to be especially holy because of its association with sacred bathing sites dedicated to the Buddha, Siva and Visņu. In this regard, we are told, it surpasses even the famous Prayâga of northern India. That is visited by pilgrims seeking purification because the two sacred rivers Yamuna and Ganga come together there. But here three sacred waters combine to empower the site. 295 The same holds with the arrangements for the annual 'durbar' in 293. Kiraņa, ed.

That the strongly Buddhist royal family of this reign was unwilling or unable to sever its links with the non-Buddhist deities of the realm is also apparent from a record of the pious works of JayarajadevI (/Jayarājacūdāmaņi), the devoutly Buddhist chief queen (&lt; agradevi) of Jayavarman VII. She founded a Buddhist nunnery for abandoned girls, and made gifts to the Eastern Buddha (Pūrvatathāgata), the Jayarājacūdāmaņi of the Rājavihāra, the Buddha of the Jayaśrinagari (Jayasrîsugaîah ), and the [Avalokitesvara] who Eliminates the Eight Great Dangers ( *astamahabhayaprabhañjakah)9 296 to [Śiva] Bhadresvara, 297 [Visņu] Cāmpesvara, the Buddha of Phimai, and the Siva of Prthuśaila,298 installed and endowed with lands a Siva and his consort in the temple of Siva at Baset in Battambang (Jayaksetrasiva), giving both the name of her husband: a Jayarâjesvara and a Jayarajesvarl, 299 gave one hundred decorated multi-coloured silk war banners to the god on the Central Mountain {madhyãdrisurah) for her husband's welfare in the world to come, 300 gilded the Vasudhātilaka temple in Sivapura that had been made in stone by a previous king, and installed golden statues of her three Gurus there. 301 She also set up images of her mother, father, brother(s), friends and family, both those she knew and those of whom she was informed. 302 It will have been noticed that the deities to whom she made gifts agree closely with those whose images are identified as having to be brought each year to the temple of Lokesvara Jayavarmesvara along with the twenty-five Jayabuddhamahânâthas, namely the Eastern Buddha, the Buddha VIrasakti, the Buddha of Phimai, the Praj nāpārami tā Jayarājacūdāmaņi of the Rājavihāra, Bhadresvara, Cāmpesvara, and Prthuśai leś vara.

Cœdès proposes ( IC 2: 1 80, n. 2) that the Vasudhātilaka may be the Phimeanakas, the small pyramid- based single-towered laterite state-temple of Sûryavarman I.

I do not see any alternative to concluding that the Vasudhātilaka too was in Šivapura, namely Phnom Bayang or Phnom Sandak. Cœdès 's translation treates the crucial tatra as though it were redundant.

The Buddha of Phimai, the Sivas Bhadresvara and Prthusailesvara and the Visņu of Cāmpesvara each receive the same gift: a gilded silver drum. As for the "Central Mountain" to whose god she dedicated banners for the welfare of her husband after his death, CŒDÈS suggested that this might be the Bayon at the centre of Jayavarman's capital. But the text speaks of a god rather than a Buddha, the Bayon has not been called the Central Mountain ( madhyãdrih ) in any other inscription, and there is an obvious alternative in Phnom Bakheng, the Saiva state-temple of Yasovarman I, constructed c. 900, since that is known in Old Khmer as Vnam Kantāl, "the central mountain". 303 Relations between the Religions Relations between the three faiths were generally tolerant. The inscriptions speak of Vaisņava, Saiva and Buddhist family lineages among the nobility, 304 but they record cases of marriage between persons of these different faiths, 305 and show that the palace, though predominantly Saiva, was not exclusively so. Among the Khmer kings of Angkor Jayavarman V and Jayavarman VII were fervent promoters of Buddhism, as we have seen, and at least two were devotees of Visņu: Jayavarman III (r. c. 835-before 877) and Sûryavarman II (r. 1113-c. 1150). This is apparent from their posthumous names, Visņuloka and Paramavisnuloka, which assert that these kings ascended after death to the paradise of Visņu. 306 Moreover, the preceptor of Jayavarman III was the Bhāgavata Šrinivāsakavi; 307 and a bas-relief in Angkor Vat depicts Sûryavarman II going forth to war mounted on an elephant preceded by a small statue of Visnu on Garuda. 308 303.

His posthumous name, if he was given one, has not been recorded, but he is described as having taken up his rule by Visņu's favour. 309 Moreover, there were high-born Vaisņavas in the royal staff. We hear, for example, of members of a corps of Bhāgavata royal servants ( bhãgavata pamre) and their chief {mūļa bhãgavata pamre ) going back to the time of Jayavarman II,310 and of the Vaisņava endowments of a Pāncarātrika noble Ksetrajña, given the title Mahendropakalpa 'Assistant to the King', who was the barber of Rājendravarman and had served in some capacity under all four preceding rulers. His ancestors too are traced back to the reign of Jayavarman II.311 Other Bhāgavatas who served the palace received -upakalpa titles with the same meaning. Nrpatlndropakalpa, the daughter of whose sister became the chief queen of Rājendravarman, has been encountered above in connection with his extensive Vaisņava endowments; and he was a matrilineal descendant of a certain Narendropakalpa, the bother of his maternal grandmother {mãtrmatulah). We also have a record of the Vaisņava endowment of a dignitary who had received the title Rājopakalpa from Jayavlravarman (1002-1006). 312 K. 91, an Old Khmer inscription from the reign of Jayavarman VI (1080-1 107) at the earliest records a matrilineal line of Guru mandarins beginning with Kavīsvarapaņdita, described as an observer of the rule of the Pancarātra {sīļa pañcaratra ), who became the Guru and counsellor of [the Šaiva] King Sûryavarman I. Of his two brothers, Jātibindu, Buddhist sources and in Far-Eastern sources derived from them; see Manjusrīmūlakalpa 54.32-41: an image of Mañjusrl to be taken into battle on the back of an elephant or on a standard; Mahābalasūtra , Tibetan translation, para. 19: 'Mahābala attaché à l'étendard, quoi qu'il arrive dans la bataille, l'adversaire ne saura faire aucun mal'; Taishõ 1248, a ritual of Vaisravaņa attributed to Amoghavajra, but not found in the Korean Tripitaka, teaches that one should attach an image of Vaisravaņa to a staff and enter battle with this standard carried fifteen paces in front of the army (Demiéville 1929-30, 81b, 11. 41^44). The eulogy of the Rāstrakūta king Govinda III in his Nesarikā grant of 805 a.D. boasts that he has seized the standards ( cihnāni ) of thirteen kings: the Fish from the kings of the Pandyas, the Bull from the Paliava king and the kings of Kosala and Avanti, the Tiger from the Cola king, the Elephant from the Ganga king, the Bow-stock from the king of Kerala, the Boar from the king of Andhra, the Câlukya, Maury a, and Simhala, and the goddess Tārā from Dharmapāla, the king of Bengal. He then brought the whole world under his Garuda standard {EI 34, 1 9). 309.

For the convention that caturbhujah 'the four-armed' means Visņu see, e.g., K 165 S, v. 4; K 256 C, v. 1; K. 275, v. 8; K. 323, v. 1; K. 528, v. 208; K. 532, v. 43; K. 534, v.'io (= K 382 A, v. 4); K. 814, v. 1; K 814, v. 29 (= K 256 C, v. 22). The expression caturbhujadvãradhrtãdhirãjyah , which I have translated 4 who took on the position of supreme ruler through [the intervention of] the four-armed [god]' may also refer to the date of his accession : 'who took on the position of supreme ruler in 924 [śaka]'.

See also K. 208, v. 53 (Rājendropakalpa). The Sanskrit term upakalpah , literally "one who prepares or provides", i.e. "an assistant" (Old Khmer upakalpa) is not used to my knowledge in this sense in Indian sources. In Old Javanese upakalpa denotes a religious officiant of some kind; see Zoetmulder 1982, s.v.</page><page sequence="87">The Saiva Religion among the Khmers (Part I) 435 and Šrīkaņthapaņdita, the latter is said to have taught at the Saiva site of Šivapāda. His son, unnamed, had a son Vāgīsvarapaņdita, who became the principal fire-sacrificer ( hotā ) of Harsavarman III and the Guru of the queen. This record shows conclusively that families were not strictly Saiva or Vaisņava, that members of the same family could be of different religions, and that a Pāncarātrika could preside in Saiva centres, for Kavīsvarapaņdita is said to have been in control of the hermitages of Isvarapura, Sivapura, Sûryaparvata and Jalāiigesvara and to have installed a Liriga and a BhagavatI on vacant land acquired by royal favour and a Candì in the temple of K.J. Govinda, evidently a Vaisņava establishment. There is evidence that the state did limit the freedom of individuals to change their religion, but only in the special case of persons from certain title-groups {varņa) who had been selected for training as Saiva officiants in the service of the king. A decree of Jayavarman V (r. c. 970-1000) forbids these from becoming Vaisnavas ( bhãgavata ).

It is ordered that they should be trained by them in the royal capital and that they should then work in the service of the king (/in royal ceremonies) as religious officiants and should not be able to become Bhāgavatas [Vaisnavas]. and insists that the women of the families from which they were selected should be given in marriage to none but persons who are of the highest status ( uttama ) and devotees of Siva. K. 444B, 11. 2-4 : nau ampall kule ta strījana oy ta qnak ta uttama pi k iv abhakt i. wam ãc ti qnak ta hīnajāti yo[k d] au pi panjã qnak khloñ As for the women of these families, they are to be given to those who are [of] superior [status] and devoted to Siva. Men of low birth ( hīnajāti ) may not take them to make them their wives. The Unchanging Saiva Temple Cult Indian Saivism was not static. During the course of several centuries new systems evolved and co-existed with their antecedents as beneficiaries of state-patronage. This history also affected the Khmers, who received the religion in at least two waves. The first is seen in inscriptions of the principalities of the pre-Angkorean period from the seventh to the early eighth century, the second in those of the kingdom of Angkor from the ninth to the fourteenth. These two forms of the religion fall within what Indian Saiva sources call respectively (1) the Atimārga ('The Supra[-mundane] Path'), intending thereby the various divisions of the Paśupatas, principally the Pāncārthikas, Lākulas/Kālamukhas and Somasiddhāntins, and (2) the Mantramārga ('The Path of Mantras'), corresponding to what modern scholars have called Agamic or Tantric Saivism, principally that of the Saiddhāntikas, the followers of the Siddhānta. But it should be understood that the differences between these two traditions, the Khmer evidence for which will be the principal subject of the second part of this study, bear for the most part on the private practice of initiates. Siva temples in which Siva was worshipped in the form of the Linga</page><page sequence="88">436 Alexis SANDERSON and associated hermitages for the support of Šaiva ascetics were institutions that appear to have remained unchanged in their fundamentals whatever the initiatory affiliation of the religious attached to them, and it is these common externals that are all that are usually apparent to us and recorded in the inscriptions. This relatively unchanging aspect of the religion, which was already in place when the Atimārga held sway and which was inherited by the Saiddhāntikas when they came to the fore, was that of lay devotion (sivabhaktih). Though the worship of initiates was focused on Śiva alone and on Śiva in one iconic form, the temples of Śiva in which they officiated for the benefit of the laity accommodated a broader range of deities. There was a single Śiva at the heart of each foundation, generally embodied in a Linga,313 who received a version of the regular worship that initiates were required to perform for themselves. But the sites also enshrined (1) ancillary Šiva forms that had no role in the higher worship of the initiated, but evoked the mythological dimensions of the deity that are so central a feature of lay devotion, and (2) images of various other deities besides. As elsewhere in the Indie world distinctions between the religions were less relevant in the lay domain, where piety tended to be inclusive. Thus during the reign of the pre-Angkorean ruler Isānavarman I ( c . 610-628) the temple of the Šiva Prahasitesvara in his capital īsānapura (Sambor Prei Kuk), named after the Indian Šiva Prahasitesvara of Pātaliputra in Magadha, received installations not only of a golden Lińga, but also of a silver image of Vrsabha (Šiva's bull), a Brahmā and a SarasvatI (his consort) and four anthropomorphic ancillary Šiva forms: (1) that in which the left of his body is that of Visņu, called Harihara or Šaňkaranarayana, (2) that in which this half is his consort Umā, called Ardhanārīsvara or Gaurisvara, (3) dancing Rudra, called variously Nrtyarudra, Nrttesvara, Nrtyesvara, Natesvara, Nātakesvara and Nätyesvara, and (4) a Šiva pure and simple, probably single-faced and two-armed: harisambhor umãrddhãngasamhatasya pinākinah vrsabhãúkasya - ucatasraf pra [timā imāh] 32 kãrttasvaramayam lingām idañ ca sacaturmmukham sarvvasya t sarvvarīdhvāntanīvrtāngam u- u - f 33 pratimeyam sarasvatyã iyan nrttesvarasya ca vidhinã sthãpitam sarvvam idan tena mahībhujā 34 sthãpiteyam pratikrtir vrsabhasya ca rājatī yã mūrttir iva dharmmasya paripūrņnā krte yuge K. 440, w. 31-34 31a harisambhor umārddhānga em. : hari u u u - rccãúga Ed. 31c vrsabhãúkasya corr. : vrsabhãúkasya Ed. 32a kãrttasvaramayam liúgam em. : kãrttasvaramayaliúgam Ed. These four images of Harihara, Ardhanārīsvara, Šiva [and ...], this golden Lińga together with [an image of] the Four-faced [Brahmā], this image of Šiva ; this image of Sarasvatī, and this of Nrttesvara: all this has been installed by that king. He has further installed this silver image of [Šiva's] Bull, which seems to be the body of Dharma in the Krta Age, [when it was still] undiminished. 314 313. A notable exception is the golden image of Paramesvara (Šiva) consecrated by Rājendravarman in A.D. 948 in the central shrine at Baksei Chamkrong, as recorded in K. 286, v. 45: sa divyadrsvã paramesvarasya hiranmayJm apratimãm vidhãnaih / upãskrtemãm pratimãm pravīņah prãsãdasobhãn ca sudhãvicitrãm 'With celestial vision this gifted king provided with all due rites this matchless golden image of Paramesvara and adorned the temple-towers with beautiful stucco-work'. 314. In his edition and translation of K. 440 ( IC 4, 5-1 1) Cœdès expressed the view that hari u u u - rccãúgasamhatasya pinākinah (3 lab) ('Hari ... de l'Archer (Çiva) uni au corps de ...') referred to Visņu and Harihara, i.e. the Siva form which is half Šiva (Hara) and half Visņu (Hari). But the fact that we have</page><page sequence="89">The Saiva Religion among the Khmers (Part I) 437 Šaiva sites during the Angkorean period show the same openness. In addition to the primary Linga, the image of the five-faced, ten-armed Sadāsiva, the icon that Saiddhāntika Šaiva initiates are to visualize when they worship Šiva in the Lińga,315 the guardians Nandin and Mahākāla who stand at the right and left of the doorway into Siva's shrine,316 and the wrathful Caņdesvara, who receives the offerings that remain after Šiva' s worship (yajñasesah ), 317 in addition, that is, to the deities that are found in the private cult of Šaiva hari rather than hareh and the Saiva context render this interpretation less probable. The syllables rccānga that Cœdès read after the lacuna are surely an error (his or the engraver's) for rddhãnga. Cf. K. 228, v. 5b: harãrddhãngadharã ; K. 583, v. 1 (= K. 70, v. 2): namo ' stu ta[s](mai) [ru] (drã)ya yadarddhańgam ha(ri)r ddadhau; Kathāsaritsāgara quoted in Šrīvidyāmantravivrti, f. 35r: tathã ca brhatkathãsaritasãgare devīm prati / mahãdevavacanam : ' 'madīyārdhāngabhūto 'sau tato visņus tvadãtmanã / yo hi nãrãyanah sã tvam śaktih saktimato mamai tatah prabhrti vikhyãtam rüpadvayam idam mama! ardhanārīsvaram rūpam ardhahãriharam vapuh / ato dadāmi nityatvam svabhaktesu harer gatim " iti. Vrsa (Šiva' s bull) is seen as the embodiment or symbol of pious religious observance (Dharma). See, e.g., Sivadharmottara D, f. 71r4: Tsvarãyatanasyãdhah srīmān dharmavrsah sthitah . In the Krtayuga, the first and best in the cycle of the four ages, Dharma is believed to have been complete and to have diminished by one quarter with each age until now, in the fourth age, the Kaliyuga, only one quarter ( pãdah ) remains. Vrsa, being four-footed ( catuspãdah ), symbolizes the Dharma complete with all four of its quarters ( catuspãdah ). 315. See Cœdès 1923, 25-27, plates XI, 2, XII, 1-3, LI, 3. XI, 2. There is a relief sculpture in which a standing Sadāsiva is flanked by reverentially kneeling figures of Visņu (viewer's right) and Brahmā (viewer's left) on the rock face a few metres to the north of the Vat Phu sanctuary, illustrated in Unesco 1999, 89. For an eight-armed variant see the 12th/l 3th century bronze in Sotheby's 1995, pl. 99. 316. K. 191, v. 45; K. 275, v. 7; K. 278, v. 26 ; K. 300, v. 64. For the role of Nandin and Mahākāla as Šiva's door-guardians see, e.g., Trilocanasiva, Somasambhupaddhativyãkhyã, IFI T. 170, 27-28; Jflānasivācārya, Jnānaratnāvalī, IFI T. 231, p. 39; Tantrāloka 15.183c-187. 317. Kir ana f. 49 v3: tarpayed yajña'sesena candeśam tańkadharinam 'With the remnants of the sacrifice he should make an offering to the hatchet-wielding Caņdesvara'. Caņdesvara/Caņda/Caņdarudra has his shrine in the NE corner of the Indian Šaiva temple compound. This is surely the deity given as Candlsvara in K. 593, v. 1 and K. 278 B, v. 26. The former records the installation of a Candlsvara, a Ganeśa, a Lińga and the Grahas ( candīsvaram vighnapatiñ ca lińgam / grahais saha sthãpitavãn ), the latter that of a Lińga and the re-installation of a Ganeśa, a Candîsvara, a Nandin and a Mahākāla: padmāsane sphātikam īsalingam / yas sthãpayãm ãsa yathãvidhãnam / vighnesacandisvaranandikãlãn / punar yathãsthãnam *atisthipac (em. Barth : adhisthipac Ep.) ca. I am unaware of any surviving Khmer image of this deity. However, the fact that he is in the company of Ganeśa, Nandin and Mahākāla make it unlikely that it is not Candeśvara that is intended. For these are all deities of the same class, being among the eight leaders of Šiva's attendant demigods (gaņesvarāh , pramathanãyakãh) that are worshipped in the systems of some of the Šaiva Tantras as the deity-circuit outside the Vidyeśvaras, between the latter and the Lokapālas. The other four are Skanda, the skeletal devotee Bhnigin/Bhnigiriti, Šiva's Bull, and Ambikā/Umā (gaņamātā 'the Mother of the Ganas'). See, e.g., Kiraņa ff. 40v6-41rl: evam *syãd( corr. : syã Cod.) dvãravinyãsah padmaih *pūjyāh (corr. : püjyä Cod.) khagesvarãh (i.e. khaga (voc.) īsvarāh [= vidyesvarãh]) / *tīksņāgrotpalasamsthānāh (corr. : tīksņāgrotpalarņsamsthānā Cod.) *pūjyāķ (corr. : püjyä Cod.) pramathanãyakãh / lokesãh svastikaih püjyäs caturbhãgavivartitaih; Mrgendra 3.20-26b; Sarvajñanottara B, p. 37 (Šivārcanaprakaraņa 35ab, 37c-39a, 39c): vidyesvarãms trtîye tu pūrvād ãrabhya vinyaset / ...ganeś vārāms caturthe tu kauberyãsãdisah kramãt / *devīm (conj. : divām Cod.) caiva tu candeśam mahākālarņ ca nandinam / ganãdhyaksam ca bhrngīsam vrsabham skandam eva ca / dhyãyet ...pañcame lokapālāms tu kramād āvaraņe budhah / vinyased astramārgeņa dhmãta- cāmīkaraprabhān; Brhatkãlottara f. 19r5 (13.102c- 103): anantãdyãn dalãgresu vidyesãms tatra püjayet / pīthakaņthe ganesãms tu lokesãn pīthapādatah.

See also the pre-Angkorean inscription K. 22, which records the</page><page sequence="90">438 Alexis SANDERSON initiâtes, we find installations of Śiva's vehicle (vãhanam), the Bull (vrsah, vrsabhah) who sits facing the Linga of the central shrine,318 the four ancillary Šiva forms already mentioned (Harihara,319 Ardhanārīsvara/Gaurīšvara, 320 the dancing Rudra,321 and the simple Siva322) and Umāmahesvara, also called Umeśa, in which Urnā, Šiva's consort, sits on his right thigh with his right arm around her. 323 installation of a Harihara, and visņucandesvaresānalingam , which most probably means 'a Visņu, a Caņdesvara, and a Šivaliriga' (cf. K. 834, v. 84: lingām aisānam ), as thought by Cœdès (IC III, 145). 318. K. 300, v. 64. The Bull has been generally called Nandin or Nandi in secondary sources both Indological and Khmerological. But this usage is extremely rare in Indian sources before modern times (see G. Bhattacharya 1956) and is never seen in the Khmer inscriptions. In the classical and learned Sanskrit sources Šiva's mount is always simply "the Bull" (vrsah, vrsabhah). The current usage is particularly unfortunate since Nandin (/Nandi/Nandlśa/Nandikeśa) is the name of the entirely different, anthropomorphic figure that stands guard at the right door-post of the entrance to the Šiva shrine, as Mahākāla guards the left. Šiva's Bull is understood as the embodiment of religious observance, dharmah' and in consequence the word vrsah is found as a synonym of dharmah in Khmer and Indian inscriptions (K. 282 D, v. 9; K. 286, v. 20; K. 834, v. 44; Gwalior Museum Stone Inscription of Patańgaśambhu (Mirashi 1962), 1. 15 (re the ascetic Vyomasambhu): vrsaikanistho 'pi jitasmaro 'pi yah śańkaro 'bhūd bhuvi ko 'py apūrvvah 'He was a new and extraordinary *Śańkara/bestower of happiness* in this world, [since he was] *completely devoted to piety/rode only on the Bull* and had *conquered lust/conquered the God of Love*'; ibid. 11. 24-25 (re Patańgaśambhu): acalasthitivrsaniratah prakaūkrtavisamadarsanah satatam / yo vijitamakaraketur ddhūrjjatilīlām alam vahati 4 He fully imitated Šiva, being *content with unchanging piety /dwelling the Himalaya and fond of the Bull*, *always clarifying abstruse doctrines/with his three eyes ever manifest*, *having conquered lust/having defeated the Love God*'. 319.

Šri Nātakesvara (= Nātakesvara) (vrah kamrateň añ srīnātakesvara daśabhuja ), along with the necessary vessels for his cult in gold and silver, a peacock-feather parasol, and the inhabitants of Arņpeņa to serve him. I have not noted the name Nātakesvara in any Indian source; but it is very improbable that this is other than the form called Nâtyesvara, Nrttesvara etc., especially in the light of its description here as ten-armed. The same applies to the Nartakesvara whose installation is recorded in Ka. 18 B, 11. 2 and 36-37. Khmer examples of ten- armed dancing Rudras have survived. He is found as the deity on temple tympana at Banteay Srei, Sikhoraphum and Phnom Rung. From the Prasat Thom at Koh Ker there survive exquisite fragments of a five-faced, ten-armed dancing Rudra in stone, of about twice human size (Jessup and Zéphir 1997, no. 42). Boisselier (1955, 198) wrongly identified the image as a Sadāsiva. 322.

For the bull see ibid., no. 24.</page><page sequence="91">The Saiva Religion among the Khmers (Part I) 439 We also find images of the following deities of the wider pantheon at Saiva sites: Durgā Mahisāsuramardinī, Urnā, Ganeśa, Skanda, Visņu (including the forms Trivikrama and Hayagrîva), Brahma, Sûrya, Laksmī, Sarasvatī, the Lokapālas, the Grahas (the Sun, the Moon, the five visible planets, and Rāhu and Ketu, the ascending and descending nodes of the moon personified as the causes of eclipses), the river Ganges (Gańga) and Bhlma. 324 Similarly, Saiva temples in which a central shrine of Siva was flanked by shrines of Brahmā and Visņu were not uncommon in the region. Examples of such complexes are those built by, or in the reign of Yasovarman I (889-910) on the hills Phnom Krom and Phnom Bok roughly equidistant from the pyramid-based temple of Yasodharesvara, the Lińga incorporating his name on the summit of Phnom Bakheng at the centre of his new capital Yaśodharapura (Angkor). 325 Others, all tenth-century, are recorded in K. 94 (on Phnom Trâp), K. 352-354 (at Rudrapada [Prasat Kantop]), and K. 532 (at Banteay Kdei). During the reign of Rājendravarman Hrslkeśa, Saivâcârya and tutor of the royal family, had a Brahmā and a Visņu installed to the right and left of a Lińga established by his Guru in Yaśodharapura (Angkor),326 and these two gods are portrayed kneeling on either side of a standing Sadāsiva in a bas-relief on the rock-face behind the Vat Phu Siva temple. 327 324. K. 176, a cave inscription on Phnom Kulen below one of the images that adorn the walls, records the installation by a Šivasoma, the Šaiva ascetic occupying the cave, in A.D. 1074/5, of the gods Siva etc., their consorts Urnā etc., the Ganas; Siva with Visņu, the Ganas and Urnā; Brahmā [?: prathamamakhabhuk]); K. 191, v. 41: a Lińga, a Visņu and a Sarasvatī; K. 218, reign of Sûryavarman I (a.D. 1002-1050): a Lińga, an Urna, a Trivikrama Visņu, a Hayagrîva, and a Trailokyasãra (Visņu); K. 254 B, 11. 17-23: a Lińga, a Visņu, and a Devī; K. 258 C, v. 26: two Lingas with a Visņu; K. 286, v. 32: Śiva, the Goddess (Urnā), Visņu, and the two Goddesses (Laksmī and Sarasvatī?) in the Baksei Chamkrong; K. 366, 11. 16-17: a Lińga, a Mahisāsuramardinī and a Visņu; K. 528, v. 218: Rājendresvara on the Eastern Mebon together with a Visņu, a Brahmā, a Siva and a Gauri; K. 528, v. 205: a Lińga, a Visņu, a Gauri and a Siva on the south bank of the Yaśodharatataka; K. 532, vv. 1-6: Šiva, Visņu, Brahmā, Umā, Sarasvatī, the Šivalinga of Aninditapura; K. 702, v. 22: Šiva and Sarasvatī; K. 56 B (Vaisņava): Laksmī, five Visņus, Kātyāyanī (Durgā), Ganga, a Visņu sleeping on the ocean (Jalaśayin); Mahisāsuramardinī: K. 56 B,' v. 18cd (Kâtyâyinî); K. 257, 11. 31-32; K. 534, v. 21.

Cf. K. 300, v. 26 (= K. 95 A, v. 36), which refers to a Yogin's vision of Siva accompanied by Umā and Gańga. The identity of Bhīma is problematic. It is mentioned to my knowledge only in K. 532, v. 27: lingām bhīmapure moghapure lińge ca sa vyadhãt / lihgaikāmsau sabhīmārccāv aninditapure punah 'He established a Lińga at Bhīmapura, two Lingas at Amoghapura, two parts of a Lińga together with an image of Bhīma in Aninditapura'. Perhaps it was an image of the Epic Hero Bhīma. A cult of this Bhīma in association with the Lińga cult was practised in East Java at Sukuh on the slopes of Mt. Lawu. Several Bhīma statues survive from this area. He appears in Old Javanese literature as a compassionate saviour of souls, a tradition that has survived in the Balinese shadow play. See de Casparis and Mabbett 1992, 317.

We see it also in Pura Meru, the state-temple established in 1720 in Cakranegara on Lombok. There too there are three pagodas in an inner courtyard. That of Šiva is in the centre with eleven roofs, that of Visņu on the north with nine, and that of Brahmā on the south with seven. 328 The same triad is conceptualized in the eleven-roofed pagodas that dominate the three shrine-complexes of Purah Besakih on Mount Agung, Bali's principal state temple. The main pagoda of the central complex (Pura Penatarang Agung) is dedicated to Šiva, while those of the complexes to the left and right of it (Pura Batu Madeg and Pura Dangin Kreteg) are dedicated to Visņu and Brahmā respectively. 329 The ninth-century Candi Srikandi on the Dieng Plateau in Central Java has the same three deities in relief: Šiva on the east wall, flanked by Visņu on the north and Brahmā on the south. 330 In the fourteenth century the East Javanese poet Mpu Tantular of Majapahit depicts an imaginary landscape that includes a ruined Šaiva temple complex on a mountainside comprising shrines of Šiva and Visņu with one of Gaņapati under the gate. 331 This laity-orientated Šaiva inclusivism is also evident in the benedictory verses that open the Khmers' Sanskrit inscriptions. Those that record benefactions creating or supporting Vaisņava and Buddhist establishments open with strictly Vaisņava (Pañca- rātrika) or Buddhist benedictions. This convention is also seen with some of the Šaiva benefactions. But many of the inscriptions recording these, while giving precedence to Šiva or to Šiva and his consort (Umā/Gaurī), go on to venerate other gods, typically Brahmā and/or Visņu (commonly both), sometimes with Laksmī and/or Sarasvatl. 332 In this openness the Khmers were following the long-established practice of India. There too Šaiva temple sites housed a wider range of deities, bridging the gap between the exclusive worship of the initiates and that of the laity on whose support they were dependent. But the Khmers were following more than the principle here. For the Šiva- forms and ancillary deities of their Šiva temples are precisely those which are prescribed for this purpose in the surviving Indian Šaiva scriptural sources, or rather in the earliest of them available to us, which comprise most of the works of this kind that were known to Indian Šaiva scholars between the tenth century and the thirteenth. The most important of these are unpublished Pratisthātantras, works concerned specifically with the installation (pratistha) of Lińgas and images, the consecration of temples, other religious edifices and the royal palace, and the ancillary topics of iconometry, iconography and architecture. They are the Devyãmata , the Pingalāmata alias 328. For these numbers of roofs for pagodas of Šiva, Visņu and Brahma in Balinese temples see van Eerde 1910. 329. Stuart-Fox 2002, 95-97. 330.

One of these scholars, Bhatta Narayanakantha, appears to have written a commentary on the Piňgalamata , since it is mentioned and attributed to him by the twelfth-century South-Indian Šaiva authority Trilocanasiva in his commentary on the Somaśambhupaddhati ; 334 and another, Vidyâkantha, a pupil of Bhatta Narayanakantha' s famous son Bhatta Rāmakaņtha II, wrote a commentary on the Mayasamgraha , which has survived complete in a single Kashmirian manuscript under the title Bhāvacūdāmaņi, 335 a work of importance not only in its own right but also because it is our only evidence of the contents of substantial parts of the text it explains, the Mayasamgraha itself having come down to us in a single incomplete manuscript. 336 The commentary cites the Devyãmata 337 and, very frequently, the Piňgalamata . 338 The fourth work, the Mohacūrottara , also referred to as Mohasūrottara and Mohacūdottara , 339 is not cited or named by any of the 333. The relevant sections of these sources are as follows: Devyãmata , ff. 66v4-73r4 (Patala 61: surāņām vividhapratimālaksaņapatalah ); Piňgalamata , ff. 13r2-27v3 (Prakaraņa 4: pratimãdh ikãrah ) ; Mohacūrottara , ff. 4v2-9vl (Patala 2: vyaktalingaprakhyãnam). The relevant section of the Maya- samgraha is one of those missing in the incomplete codex unicus, but its contents can be determined from the commentary on this text {Bhāvacūdāmaņi) composed by the Kashmirian Saiddhāntika Vidyâkantha II, pupil of Bhatta Rāmakaņtha II. 334. Somasambhupaddhativyakhyã, p. 99: tad uktam piúgalãmatatikãyãm nãrãyanakanthena pīthāntam pîthavyâpîti. 335. For my evidence that the author of the commentary was a pupil of Rāmakaņtha II rather than the Vidyâkantha who was a pupil of Rāmakaņtha I, and for my identification of the Mayasamgraha of the Nepalese ms. as the work known to the early Kashmirian commentators, see Dominic Goodall 1998, x- xiii. I am very grateful to him for providing me with a photocopy of his photocopy of the Jammu manuscript, which he had acquired seeing that it might be a previously unknown work of Kashmirian Saiddhāntika literature, and to another of my former pupils John Nemec, who kindly acquired a direct photocopy of the manuscript for me in Jammu, a copy which proved, unlike the first, to be completely legible. This Mayasamgraha is not to be confused with the published, South-Indian Mayamata. They have in common only that they are Šaiva works on Pratisthā attributed to Maya, the architect of the Asuras. 336. Prakaraņa 2 of the Mayasamgraha , the section on iconometry and iconography (pratimã - laksaņaprakaraņam ), is covered in the commentary on ff. 12r7-21v9. 337. Ff. 56v and 58v, on both occasions with the erroneous spelling Divyãmata , which no doubt reflects the tendency of the speakers of Kashmiri who transmitted this text not to distinguish Sanskrit ī and e; see Grierson 1915, 3b-4a. 338. E.g. ff. 4v, 8v, 21r, 24r, 25r, 25v, 35 v, 37v, 40r, 43r, 43 v, 44v, 50v, 53r, 53 v, 55r, 57v, 61r, 6 lv, 62 v, and 66r. The other works of this class that are cited as authorities by Vidyâkantha are the Nandikesvar amata (ff. 17v, 18r, 53r, 54r, 67r), the Pratisthāpāramesvara (ff. 7r, 8r, 12r, 13v, 17v, 23r, 24v, 57v, 67r), the Paitãmaha and the Pratisthãsamuccaya (ff. 17r, 22r, 58r, 58v, 59r, 60r, 66r). I know of no surviving manuscript of any of these. 339. The name of this text is a puzzle. In the opening section Indra, the pupil here, says that he has already been taught the Mohacūda (1.2ab: tvatprasādāt par ij ña tam mohacūdam mayã prabho), and asks Skanda to teach him the Mohacūrottara (1.3 cd: mohacūrottaram sãs tram tadartham vaktum arhasí) to provide detailed instruction on the Linga and temples mentioned there. We therefore expect moha- cūdottaram 'The Sequel of the Mohacūda ' but the unmeaning -cūrottara- is repeated in all the colophons. The original source of the text, a mythical work in 70 million verses, is also Mohacūra in the closing verses of the work (f. 46v5-6: saptakotipravistīrņān mohacūrān mayã tava / vyãkhyãtam sãram ãdãya laksagranthena suvrata / punah prstah samãsena tvayãham suranãyaka / tad ãkhyãtam tadarddhena mohacūram mayã hare / siddhisãrasahasrais tu yugmacandrais tad antatah / yogajnãnãdisamyuktam vyãkhyãtam sãs tram uttamam / susamksepam sugambhīram pratisthãtantram</page><page sequence="94">442 Alexis SANDERSON tenth-century commentators of Kashmir. But it was known to Somaśambhu, who cites it in his Karmakāņdakramāvalī (Somaśambhupaddhati 4:85, v. 42), which he completed in A.D. 1095/6 while he was abbot of the Central-Indian Golaklmatha. It is excerpted by Hrdayasiva, probably of Mālava, in his unpublished Prãyascittasamuccaya , 340 which may prove to have been earlier. But the evidence now available to me indicates that it may have been composed at any time from the late ninth century to 1157/8, the date of the earliest manuscript. 341 We also have the Kir ana and the Ne tratan tra , both major scriptural sources for the Kashmirians of the tenth century, the former surviving in a Nepalese manuscript completed in A.D. 924/5, the latter in one of 1200. 342 Neither of these Saiva scriptures is a work devoted exclusively to Pratisthā, but both include important relevant information on the range and iconography of deities. Chapter 52 ( vyaktaliñgalaksanam ) of the Kiraņa sets out the iconography of the wider Saiva pantheon, that is to say, of the images of the various deities that a Saiva officiant may be expected to install. The Netratantra teaches the specialized cult of the Mantra-deity known as Mrtyuñjaya, Amrtesafbhairava] or Netranātha, but it is a peculiarity of its system that the Mantra is absolutely universal in that the officiant initiated into its cult is empowered to use it in the worship of any deity. The Mantra is constant; only the visualization changes. In this context the text sets out in its thirteenth chapter the principal forms of the deities whose worship may be assimilated. The range is wider than that of the other texts, since the Netratantra is not narrowly concerned with the programme of images in the Saiva temple-complex but envisages the whole range of deities, including the Buddha, whose worship was part of the religious calendar of the court, in which this Saiva specialist was to serve in a role that encompasses and exceeds that of the brahmanical royal chaplain ( rãjapurohitah ). Though its iconographical information is less detailed than that of the other five works mentioned it is of use in that it agrees closely with the range of Śiva-forms envisaged in those sources. These, minor discrepancies apart, are just those seen in the surviving inscriptions and statuary of the Khmers: the mild one-faced and two-armed Šiva, the ten-armed, five-faced Sadāsiva, the ten-armed dancing Rudra, Ardhanārisvara, Harihara/Śańkaranarayana, and Umāmahesvara. 343 The same applies to the wider Śaiva pantheon taught for installation in uttamam. We also see it with the citation of the text in the manuscripts of the Prãyascittasamuccaya of Hrdayasiva. South-Indian citations always give the title as Moha'sūrottara, which removes the problem but is certainly a misguided attempt to correct what was probably seen as a Tamilism, for Sanskrit -i- is rendered by -c- in Tamil transcription. The puzzling spelling is also supported by the Kashmirian manuscripts of the Karmakāņdakramāvalī of Somaśambhu. The Kashmirian edition has mahādūrāntare for the locative singular of this title in v. 1361b, but records the obviously less corrupt variant mohadūrāntare. This dû is more probably a corruption of cū than of św, because cū and dû resemble each other in the Kashmirian Šāradā script to a degree that makes confusion easy, whereas sū and dû do not. Moreover, cū and dû have one style of postconsonantal w, whereas sū shows the other. I find the title in the expected form Mohacūdottara in two Maharashtrian sources: a manuscript of Kamalākarabhatta's Sūdradharmatattva (AUFRECHT 1864, 279a) and the published edition of the Caturvargacintāmaņi (1:134, 135) composed by Hemādri while he was a minister of the Yädava king Mahādeva of Devagiri (r. 1260-1271). I have retained the prevalent spelling in preference to this plausible correction. 340. Ff. 1 03v 1-1 1 Irl, = Mohacūrottara , ff. 42v4- 47r2 (the end). 341.

This might suggest the possibility that the Khmers received their Saivism before these elements had been integrated into its programme of temple images. But this is unlikely, since Saivism's engagement with these deities goes back at least to the fourth century of the Christian era. The Vākātaka king Rudrasena I (r. A.D. c. 335 -c. 360) is described as a loyal devotee of (Sadāsiva), Ardhanārisvara, Umeśa, Haranârâyana (Harihara), and Nrtyeśa/Nrty arudra; Mayasamgraha {Bhāvacūdāmaņi, f. 19rl4 - v3): ten-armed Siva, Šiva on his bull, Ardhanārisvara, naked and ithyphallic in the Devadāruvana, Nätyastha and Śańkaranarayana (Harihara); Kiraņa , Patala 52: ten-armed dancing Rudra, Umāmahesvara, Ardhanārisvara, Rudra-and-Krsņa (Harihara); Netratantra 1 3.29- 32b: ten-armed Rudra on his bull, four-armed Śiva with trident, gesture of protection, citron and rosary, Nätyastha, Ardhanārisvara, Harihara, Vivāhastha, Samīpastha (= Umāmahesvara?); and Pińgalamata f. 19v2 ff.: Nātesvara, Sadāsiva (four-faced and eight-armed), Umāmahesvara, Ardhanārisvara, and Harirudra (Harihara). 344.

The subtypes detailed in the Netratantra belong, I shall argue elsewhere, to a Kashmirian tradition with strong local features. The Pińgalamata is not a text of the Siddhānta but rather of the Yâmala tradition of the Sākta Šaivism of the Vidyapltha. It affiliates itself to the Brahmayãmala ( Picumata ) and in accordance with this stance, though it covers Saiddhāntika territory, it teaches the iconography of the deities of the Vārna, the Dakšiņa {Picumata) and the Trika, and builds up the role of Bhairava and the Mother Goddesses in its general Šai va iconography. In the absence of the relevant portion of the text of the Mayasamgraha it is impossible to be sure that all the deity-forms in Vidyakantha's commentary were in that text. His reference to three- and four- faced Visņus seems likely to have been added on the basis of what he knew of the distinctive Kashmirian Pāncarātrika tradition.</page><page sequence="96">444 Alexis Sanderson "Great Bhairava"; 345 and a copperplate decree issued by Maharaja Bhuluņda in A.D. 376 from Bagh (Valkhā) in Madhya Pradesh records a grant made to support the worship of the Mothers in a temple of those deities established by a Pâsupatãcârya Bhagavat Lokodadhi. 346 But in all other respects we find a strikingly close correlation between the Khmer evidence of the range of deities installed in Šiva temples and that prescribed in these early sources of Indian Šaivism. And this correlation demonstrates that the Šaivism of the temples underwent little change when patronage shifted from the Atimārga to the Mantramārga. For although the extant Indian textual sources that record this iconography belong to the Mantramārga, the same iconography, with the exception of the Mantramārga's Sadāsiva, is in evidence among the Khmers in the seventh century, well before the Mantramārga reached their shores. The Problem of Provenance What we do not find among the Khmers or their neighbours in mainland and maritime Southeast Asia is any trace of that range of ancillary Śiva-forms that has seemed so central to students of Saiva India because they are found throughout the Siva temples of the Tamil-speaking South, where Šaivism has been best preserved down to modern times, and because they are those prescribed in Šaiva scriptures transmitted under ancient titles in that region. 347 I refer to forms such as Bhiksātana, Somāskanda, Kankālarūpa, Candraśekhara, Daksiņāmūrti, Gangādhara, Tripurāntaka, Lingodbhava, Kāmāri, Kālāri, Caņdesvaraprasāda, and Natarāja. 348 345.

This list is followed by the Sūksma and the īsānasivagurudevapaddhati (Kriyãpãda 43.1 -84b).

The Ajitāgama teaches the following twenty ancillary Šiva forms and other deities for installation in Šiva temples (Kriyãpãda 36.207-375a): Lingodbhava, Sukhāsīna, with Gauri, Bhiksātana, Kankālarūpa, Nrttarūpa, Trimūrti, Cakrada, Candraśekhara, Devyardha, Daksiņāmūrti, Kāmāri, Kālāri, Vaivãhya, Somāskanda, Jalandhara, Harihara, Vrsārūdha, Tripurāntaka, and Visasamharaņa; Visņu, Brahmā, Šakti, Vinäyaka, Skanda, Sūrya, Durgā, Ksetrapāla, Candeśa, Moti, Jyesthä, Šāstr, the Dikpālas, the Mātrs and Ganas, VIrabhadra and Ganeśa, the Rudras, Âdityas, and Vasus, the Vidyeśvaras, the eight Mūrtis, Nandin and Mahākāla, Šailādi, Šri, Sarasvatī, Agastya, Nārada, the Gaņas, Bhnigi, Ganeśvaras, Rudrakińkaras, Bhaktas, and Vrsa.</page><page sequence="97">The Saiva Religion among the Khmers (Part I) 445 But this should not be read as evidence that the temple Saivism of the Khmers cannot have reached them from the Tamil-speaking region of South India. It may have been introduced from another source, but the mere absence of the Saiva iconography distinctive of that vigorous cultural zone does not settle the matter, since our evidence of Khmer Saiva images goes back to the seventh century and so long predates the emergence of that iconography. Against influence from this region one might also point to the Indian Sivas that proliferated in the Khmer realm during the pre-Angkorean period. We find no Siva from the Tamil cultural zone among them and so might wish to conclude that the Khmers must have received their Saivism from another direction. But this too carries no weight, since the names chosen are those of Sivas sanctified by inclusion in the lists of the early Saiva tradition. That tradition is North-Indian in origin, as can be seen from the fact that the Siva temples of its lists are overwhelming concentrated in that region. There are only three sites that approach the South and they are outposts: Ś risai la (Tripurāntaka) and Saptagodāvara (Bhīma) in Andhra, and Gokarņa (Mahābala) just below Goa in northern Karņātaka. But the tradition, with its religious topography, spread throughout India and indeed beyond it and therefore could have been brought to the Khmers from any part of the subcontinent. Thus while it is entirely possible that the Khmers received their Saivism from sources other than the Tamil South, there is as yet no evidence that definitely excludes that region. On the contrary there is evidence of South-Indian influence in other spheres that should make us hesitate to do so in this. There are the scripts of the Khmers and Chams, which are based on South-Indian models, and there is evidence that both peoples knew the Mahãbhãrata Epic in its South-Indian recension. The evidence is slight in the case of the Khmers. A single verse cited in an inscription shows a reading that appears in all but one of the South-Indian manuscripts that have been collated and in only one other. 349 But the evidence is firmer for the neighbouring Chams, since one of their Sanskrit inscriptions relates the myth of Siva's destruction of the celestial palaces of the three Asuras in a variant that appears only in that recension. 350 349.

According to the editors' apparatus criticus all the manuscripts collated read sarvalokagurum as in this citation, except for two from Kashmir and a single Devanāgarī witness (Ś1, K1.4 and Dl), whose reading they have adopted.

Editorial Conventions When I have emended the reading of a manuscript or printed edition cited in the notes and when I have preferred the reading of one manuscript or group of manuscripts I have marked the beginning of the text-segment in question with a superscript asterisk. The end of the segment is followed by a parenthesis in which first the status of the segment is indicated, by "em." for an emendation, "corr." for an obvious correction, "conj." for a conjectural emendation, or, if it is an attested reading, an upper-case letter or letters identifying the manuscript or manuscripts in which it is transmitted. The manuscripts to which these letters refer have been identified in the bibliographical entry for that text. Any testimonia relevant to the emendation or choice of reading have been indicated thereafter within square brackets. Then, after a colon, are given the readings that have been rejected. Where more than one rejected reading has been cited the later is separated from the preceding by a colon. Rejected readings are followed in every case by their source, either the letter or letters identifying the manuscript source, "Cod." for the manuscript when only one has been available, "Codd." when there is more than one and all give the reading, or "Ed." when the source is a printed edition identified in the bibliography. When the reported reading of an inscription has been questioned its source has been indicated by the abbreviation "Ep." The same conventions have been followed where text has been presented in the form of an indented citation within the main text rather than in the notes, except that emendations, variants and the rest have been given not within the citation, as in the notes, but in a register below it. The beginnings of the text-segments concerned have not been marked with a superscript asterisk because they have been given in the lower register at the beginning of each entry. I have enclosed problematic text-segments between obeli. In my transcriptions the character Upadhmanlya is rendered f</page></plain_text>
