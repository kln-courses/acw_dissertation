<plain_text><page sequence="1">413 New Approaches in the Search for Meaning? A Review of Research in "Paleolithic Art" Margaret W. Conkey University of California Berkeley, California This review article summarizes some of the major research on "paleolithic art" since 1979, with the explicit intent of evaluating how this research has contributed to the search for the meaning ofpaleolithic art. The article reviews recent major publications and argues that the emphasis on the diversity of the materials and on their contexts is changing the scope and interpretive possibilities for the study of "paleolithic art." Particular attention is given to studies that have focused on aspects of the technologies that generated the imagery. Introduction Most general treatments of the Upper Paleolithic focus not only on its "classic" manifestations in sw Europe but also on what appears to be a strikingly new feature of the archaeological record-"paleolithic art." This term has been applied to an extremely diverse set of materials and imagery that includes cave paintings, drawings, engrav- ings; engraved and carved bone, antler, and ivory; low or bas-relief sculpture on stone blocks; shell, teeth, and other materials pierced, perhaps for suspension; statuettes of ivory, stone, bone, and even kiln-baked clay. The images include an Ice Age bestiary of animals that comprises primarily ungulates (horse and bison) but includes fish, birds, and other mammals (e.g., bear) as well. There are also humans, parts of humans (e.g., hands), anthropo- morphs, and a variety of geometric shapes and forms, usually called "signs." These materials and images appear to have been made within the 25-30,000-year period we call the Upper Pa- leolithic, yet they are differentially distributed through time and space. Regional variations, for example, have been cited for even the earliest imagery (Hahn 1981; Conkey 1983); female statuettes seem relatively limited in their temporal occurrences (Delporte 1979; Gamble 1982); and cave painting appears to belong primarily to the last 8000 years of the Upper Paleolithic. This is im- agery and techniques from varied contexts and from some tens of thousands of years ago; it has been both familiar and convenient to label it "art," yet this both privileges and problematizes our interpretations (that is to say, cer- tain interpretations tend to be given more attention or credibility and then are made into the particular problems to be addressed). This article is an attempt to review the literature and other scholarly treatments of "paleolithic art" between 1979 and 1986. In so doing, I will use the term "paleo- lithic art" in quotations to indicate the questionable nature of this term as a definition.' Until recently, it has been fairly easy for nonspecialists to deal with the thousands of images, wall-paintings, engravings, and figurines because relatively monolithic, inclusive kinds of interpretations for the "art" have prevailed in the generalist literature. For the first half of this century, the imagery was explained in terms of sympathetic hunting magic and associated rituals and paraphernalia. By the 1960s, this view was replaced by a structuralist "reading" of cave art, which showed that the images were not randomly placed on sacred cave walls in order to insure success in the hunt.2 Rather, it was 1. There is no doubt that the use of the term "paleolithic art" has contributed to our condensing all the diversity of media and imagery into a single category that is, furthermore, one of "our" categories. By calling these images "art," we presume the aesthetic; we also presume a link between us and the makers/users of the imagery. As this review will note, such a term has invited monolithic interpretive accounts and col- lapses as much as 30,000 years of image-making into a single category. To show the usual map of where such painted caves and imagery have been found promotes this even further: 30,000 years is collapsed into a single spatial "slice." I prefer the notion of "visual and material imagery," which, while not completely neutral itself, at least sidesteps the assump- tion of the works as "representational art." As indicated later in the review, it is hoped that the current investigation into the diversity of the imagery will proceed so far as to make the term, "paleolithic art," ob- solete on these grounds as well. 2. Embodied in this interpretive shift is the tension (as identified by W. Davis, personal communication) between analyzing paleolithic pic-</page><page sequence="2">414 A Review ofResearch in "PaleolithicArt"/Conkey suggested that there was a deliberate selection both of animal species for different topographic locales in the cave, and of ones to be depicted in association with certain other animals and/or (geometric) signs. The cultural source first proposed for such a symbolic mapping--or mythogram-was a cosmological schema that distin- guished between male and female domains, and it was this schema that was thought to have generated the image- making guidelines for an ideal sanctuary and all its var- iants. Most archaeologists will recognize this structuralist in- terpretation as the contribution of Andre Leroi-Gourhan, originally published in English in his magnum opus, Trea- sures of Prehistoric Art (1965). His 1968 article in Scientific American provided a concise synopsis of the gender-gen- erated mythogram and was particularly useful for the class- room. It is tragic that this review of "paleolithic art" studies must include reference to the deaths of Professor Leroi-Gourhan (February, 1986) and Jean Vertut (May, 1985), whose photographs in the 1965 volume (and since) have made a significant contribution to expanding and yet refining the public comprehension of the imagery and media that comprise "paleolithic art" (see Clottes 1985).3 Because Leroi-Gourhan's mythogram hypothesis, and, in particular, his accompanying stylistic chronology for the imagery, have been so inclusive and predominant, the description and explanation of "paleolithic art" have been relatively easy for Americanist consumers to assimilate. Other widely-published views, such as those of Alexander Marshack (e.g., 1972a, 1972b), have been easily comple- mentary to Leroi-Gourhan's in that both have worked from the assumption that the cognitive systems of the image-makers were fully modern. Also, it has been Mar- shack's work with the engraved bones and antlers as part of a notational system that has been most widely read and integrated into classroom interpretations, and this has complemented-not challenged-the mythogram inter- pretation of the decorated cave walls. The structuralist interpretation of Leroi-Gourhan has, however, not been unquestionably accepted (e.g., Ucko and Rosenfeld 1967; Parkington 1969; Stevens 1975), and reference to the magic and/or intensity of the hunting way of life as a source for the imagery has also not been completely deleted from the literature (e.g., Guthrie 1984; Leroi-Gourhan 1982: 8,75). Certainly the structuralist ap- proach has found support from structuralist-minded An- glo-American archaeologists (e.g., Hodder 1982; Leone 1982; and for a review see Conkey, in press). What is more, the interpretation has undergone its own intellectual evolution. In subsequent papers (e.g., 1972) and books (e.g., 1982), Leroi-Gourhan further empha- sized additional features (such as the spatial organization of imagery) as well as deleting explicit reference to the male-female binary structural principles. He had come to emphasize on the one hand the formula for the arrange- ment of animal species (as applied in Arlette Leroi-Gour- han and Allain 1979: 343-353), and, on the other, a more formal analysis of the imagery itself, such as animation and various figurative stages (Leroi-Gourhan 1982). These modifications to the structuralist approach, how- ever, are not likely to be a part of the nonspecialist's working knowledge of Upper Paleolithic interpretations. In fact, few European workers in "paleolithic art" have yet to address the much more complex symbolic approach undertaken by Leroi-Gourhan in his 1982 book. But if the interpretive framework has been a relatively inclusive, and thus an easy, one to grasp and to teach, such a simple situation no longer obtains. The past seven years have witnessed a noticeable increase in the literature that deals directly with paleolithic visual images and forms and with their contexts. Even more noticeable and im- portant, it is clear that there can no longer be a single "meaning" to account for the thousands of images, media, contexts, and uses of what we lump under the term "pa- leolithic art." In this review, I will show how the literature, events, activities, and studies of "paleolithic art" over the past seven years not merely promote and encourage but also demand a recognition of the diversity of the material cul- ture and visual imagery of the Upper Paleolithic, which tures as artifacts/tools and analyzing them as images/texts, which is part of the wider tensions (if not schism) between the social sciences (includ- ing archaeology) and the humanities (art history). There has been a marked tendency among most Americanist paleolithic archaeologists (particularly those of the scientific persuasion prevalent in the 1960s and 1970s) to avoid or ignore "paleolithic art" except insofar as it is useful to support evolutionary notions about the transformation of paleolithic cultures into fully modern forms, or in writing grand-narrative cultural chronologies. One paleolithic archaeologist once noted that he, as a professional field archaeologist, in fact resented "paleolithic art" because it had, to him, distracted first rate minds and field archaeologists such as Breuil and Leroi-Gourhan away from living sites into a hopelessly enigmatic cul-de-sac. 3. There is no doubt that the death of Leroi-Gourhan takes from us one of the most creative and important researchers of the past century. Most Americanists know only his contributions to the study of "paleo- lithic art," which alone have been unsurpassed. He wrote, however, extensively on aspects of prehistory and ethnology, ranging from essays on human technology to prehistoric religion (see Leroi-Gourhan 1983 for a collection of his essays). His pioneering methodological work at the open-air Magdalenian site at Pincevent has also been a model for site excavation over the past two decades. Most of his work has been published in French, and Americanists' relative lack of familiarity with it has been a serious loss. Perhaps more so than any other French prehistorian of the past century, Leroi-Gourhan has had the very an- thropological perspective that would be most compatible with that of Americanist archaeology.</page><page sequence="3">Journal ofFieldArchaeology/Vol. 14, 1987 415 is, after all, a sweep of some 25,000 years of more. I have chosen the past seven years somewhat arbitrarily, in that, while this review was first intended to cover research of the 1980s, several important 1979 works (e.g., Delporte 1979; Leroi-Gourhan and Allain 1979) must be included. Perhaps also, I would like to argue that we are now feeling, literally, a "seven year itch," and it is timely to not only review the situation but also activate the changes incipient in the literature and research of the past years. There is no doubt that because of the nature of the images (many so-called "naturalistic" and dynamic im- ages), because of their favored place in the narratives of human culture history and of art history, and because of the presumed association of the images with human sym- bolic behaviors, the search for "meaning" has been a more explicit and accepted goal in "paleolithic art" studies than in other aspects of Upper Paleolithic research. Thus, this review will pay particular attention to what the implica- tions of diversity might be in the more ambitious-and highly-valued-search for the possible meanings of these images and forms. Although Leroi-Gourhan's contribu- tions to the study and interpretation of Paleolithic art forms have been prolific and revolutionary, it appears that the field of "paleolithic art" studies may be changing, diversifying, and producing observations and interpreta- tions that not only challenge any extant inclusive accounts for the imagery, but also make it unlikely that any new accounts could be as inclusive as those of Leroi-Gourhan and his predecessors. The review will be organized in three parts: 1) a review of some recent major publications and a consideration of what we might infer about the field from these; 2) a consideration of the kinds of studies that, taken together, are changing the scope, direction, and interpretive possi- bilities for the study of "paleolithic art"; and 3) a more detailed consideration of one subset of these studies, those that have focused on what I will call the "generative tech- nologies" or "technological styles" of paleolithic imagery. It is studies such as the latter, I suggest, that are crucial and have particular potential in the search for the "mean- ings" of the imagery and its contexts. It is important to point out that this review has no pretensions of being comprehensive, nor is it based on a completely systematic or representative selection of the literature; only the Bulletin de la Socitt Prthistorique Fran- gaise was surveyed fairly completely, because of its acces- sibility. It is not likely, however, that additional mono- graphs or studies would alter the basic interpretation of the field that is suggested here: that the field is diversify- ing; that the diversity of the imagery is finally being given more attention; and that there are important new research foci, which, if coupled with much-needed theoretical con- texts, could make significant headway into the field of "meaning." The Production of Meaning by Us: Recent Literature This section is intended to give a brief idea of the range of literature and organized activities such as symposia that have characterized the past seven years. One major trend that is now being developed appears to be a more global approach to all prehistoric art. Despite obvious differences in subject matter, media, historical contexts, and available ethnographic materials, it appears that the study of pre- historic visual imagery in other places and times is per- ceived to be relevant to the study of the Upper Paleolithic case, and the Upper Paleolithic materials are no longer the baseline for the study of other repertoires, as has been the case historically. One may cite, for example, the appearance of the high quality journal, Ars Praehistorica (1982), an international annual review of prehistoric art, initiated by E. Ripoll- Perello. It has articles in many languages and on "art" from North Africa and Italy as well as from the traditional Franco-Cantabrian domain. Also initiated during the past few years is the Cambridge University Press monograph series, Imprint of Man, edited by Emmanuel Anati, which complements his own personal and enthusiastic attempts to organize a global rock-art consortium and to increase public awareness of rock art as both cultural heritage and as one undergoing serious degradation because of envi- ronmental or human factors. At least four monographs have appeared in the Cambridge series: one on Levantine art (Beltran 1982; see also Dams 1984); one on North American rock art (Campbell 1983); one on European cave art (Leroi-Gourhan 1982); and one on the rock art of Southern Africa (Lewis-Williams 1983a). That at least one ear of the Paleolithic specialist has been attuned to rock-art studies outside the "classic" Up- per Paleolithic zone is also apparent in that various col- loquia or lecture series held over the past three years at the Musde de l'Homme have included overviews of rock- art research in Australia or elsewhere. For example, the 1983 lectures on "Representations Prdhistoriques" in- cluded Clegg's (1984) work on an Australian petroglyph site and Lhote's chronology (1984) for North African and Saharan rock art (all papers from 1983 were published in volume 88[4] of L'Anthropologie [1984] and those from 1985 were published in Volume 90[4] of 1986). To what extent, however, the different perspectives taken in and for other areas and repertoires will be con- sidered or integrated into Upper Paleolithic "art" research</page><page sequence="4">416 A Review ofResearch in "PaleolithicArt"/Conkey remains to be seen. Certainly, the appearance of Rock Art Research, the journal of the Australian Rock Art Research Association (AURA) is already proving to be a place for debate and discussion about "paleolithic art" studies in a wider intellectual context (e.g., the "RAR Debate" col- umn concerning Marshack's [1985b] contribution to the journal; see Lorblanchet 1986). Among the most prolific and provocative work else- where that must be considered by Paleolithic scholars has been that by Lewis-Williams (e.g., 1982, 1983b, 1984a) and colleagues (e.g., Manhire, Parkington, and van Rijssen 1983; Maggs and Sealy 1983; Huffman 1983) with the rock art of Southern Africa. Stimulated by the quantitative studies of Vinnicombe (1976), which-like those of Leroi-Gourhan for paleolithic caves-showed how certain species of animal were or were not selected for representation, and thus challenging the prevailing functionalist, sympathetic hunting-magic account of the imagery, Lewis-Williams has gone on to argue convinc- ingly that the key to understanding this rock art is its embodiment of metaphors that are both derived from and actualize trance experiences. That is, by drawing on 1) previously untapped ethnohistorical accounts of some of the last southern San; 2) contemporary San trance expe- riences, myths, and metaphors (e.g., Katz 1982); and 3) formal analysis of the imagery itself that challenges the prevalent "literal" readings (Lewis-Williams 1981a, b), Lewis-Williams argues that much of the imagery depicts aspects of trance hallucinations and experiences. These aspects relate to such phenomena as the power of the eland (antelope), the most frequently-depicted spe- cies, and its role in helping to achieve a trance state, or to "medicine men" in trance who may go on out-of-body journeys and, among other things, lead off certain rain animals, such as a bull, to bring on the desired rain or who use the potency released by achieving a trance state to "cure" other San. Many of the painted rock-art images have been related to metaphoric forms for being in a trance state (such as a sensation of being underwater) or to the "form constants" (certain geometric shapes that are widely documented as being seen by those in a trance or other hallucinatory state) (Lewis-Williams 1986). On the one hand, this interpretive framework has rev- olutionized the study of Southern African rock art; the importance of trance in explicating the art is no longer restricted to the Drakensbeig region of SE South Africa (e.g., Maggs and Sealy 1983; Huffman 1983). It is more than the coherent interpretive umbrella of the trance ex- perience that makes this recent work revolutionary. The various researchers have revealed a new and more system- atic use of direct historical analogies drawn from ethnog- raphy and ethnohistory, something that appears, however, to be out of the question for Upper Paleolithic materials. But, more relevant to paleolithic research has been both the challenge to an "empiricist's paradigm" (e.g., Lewis- Williams 1983b, 1984a), which had led to the limited interpretations and proclamations that rock art is "forever enigmatic," and the attempt to bring an explicitly histor- ical-materialist interpretive framework (Lewis-Williams 1982) to the study of prehistoric visual imagery. Those studying rock art or prehistoric imagery of any particular context certainly must read both of Lewis-Williams' papers cited above (1983b, 1984a), as well as Davis' reviews, which include reference to this Southern African work (Davis 1984, 1985). On the other hand, in the enthusiasm over the trance hypothesis, one is often led to believe that without such rich ethnography we will never be able to access "mean- ings" at all in "paleolithic art." What is more, it has been easy for African workers to consider as marginal, or even exclude, imagery that does not (yet?) fit under this partic- ular interpretive umbrella. The attempts at literal or nar- rative readings, which may use the imagery to confirm the use of certain technologies or activities (e.g., Manhire, Parkington, and Yaks 1985; or Campbell 1986), have sometimes been controversial and subject to challenge (see Lewis-Williams 1984b). There is no doubt that the trance hypothesis offers a very unified interpretation for a diverse set of imagery, which is in contrast to the current move away from this interpretation in "paleolithic art" research. Further, in the face of the increasingly complex histories that are being demonstrated for the indigenous peoples of Southern Af- rica (e.g., Denbow 1984; Gordon 1984; Schrire 1980, 1984b), the insistence on the long-term continuity of ideology and visual imagery (Lewis-Williams 1984c) has raised some questions (Kelly 1986). One of the concerns over Leroi-Gourhan's view of a continuous stylistic evolution of paleolithic cave "art" and a continuity in the generative structural meaning has been the unquestioned corollary that there was a corresponding social homogeneity and continuity. This corollary may be expressed by the assertion that: ". . . there were no great social upheavals" (Sieveking 1979: 20). If one accepts Lewis-Williams' interpretations of "artistic" and ideolog- ical continuity in Southern Africa, and if-at the same time-the claims for historical and prehistoric cultural dis- continuity and variation are further substantiated, as ap- pears likely, then there is still much to be learned about the diachronic and fiunctional interrelations between "art" and social forms, which will be applicable to our inquiries into such interrelations in the Upper Paleolithic. But it</page><page sequence="5">Journal of FieldArchaeology/Vol. 14, 1987 417 has been some time since most interpreters of "paleolithic art" have looked seriously at the ethnographic and/or eth- noarchaeological literature for other than the most general interpretations. In returning to the recent literature on paleolithic ma- terials, the difference from the work in Southern Africa is clear: there are neither attempts at inclusive interpretations nor critiques of functionalism or of positivist paradigms, although there is, as will be noted, some self-critique. For the most part, one notes primarily a continued increase in the documentation of materials. Noteworthy among the books and monographs of the past seven years is the new series launched by the Univer- sity of Salamanca (Corpus Artis Rupestris), devoted to pa- leolithic wall "art" (e.g., Sanchidrian Torti 1981; Sauvet and Sauvet 1983). Other important site monographs in- clude Barriere (1982) on Rouffignac (Dordogne, France) and Volume III in the La Marche (Vienne, France) series (Pales and Tassin de Saint-Pereuse 1981). The latter ad- dresses the engraved depictions of horses and bovids at the extremely important and rich site of La Marche which has yielded dozens of engraved plaquettes or stone slabs and a most provocative set of images of humans, including faces (Pales 1976; see also in Hadingham 1979: 231). Regional compendia include Adam and Kurz (1980) on the increasingly interesting "portable art" from south- ern Germany and Apellaniz (1982) on the prehistoric images from the Basque country and nearby regions. The latter represents an attempt to identify the individual hands of artists ("maestros") at many Basque sites. One interesting problem-oriented volume is that edited by Bandi et al. (1984), which brings together many papers on the zoological and ethological aspects of interpretation. These are in many languages and of variable quality, but those by Bosinski (1984), Delporte (1984a), and Hahn (1984) are of particular interest in their attempts to iden- tify patterns of imagery, sometimes in the context of in- trasite distributions (as in Bosinski's study). "Portable art" seems to be, at last, receiving increasing attention; the first international conference devoted exclu- sively to its study was in November, 1987, in Foix, France. Among the more notable recent treatments of portable materials is Delporte's (1979) summary of the female im- agery. This work is primarily a geographically-oriented "catalogue" and description of the statuettes (see also Rice 1981). Also of note is Varagnac's (1980) somewhat con- troversial (see Clottes 1980) monograph on the Piette collection of engraved bones and antler. This book is pri- marily useful as a catalogue that arranges the materials (presented as photographs, never in drawings, which the author believes can be too subjective) in both chronolog- ical and typological order. If one accepts Chollot-Varag- nac's analysis of the engraved geometric elements on these bone/antler forms, which shows-in contrast to Leroi- Gourhan's work in the caves-no clear preferences for association of elements on the pieces, then one can antic- ipate the current view that the portable materials are the product of very different conceptual systems than are the images found on cave walls. Whether one may proceed- as Chollot-Varagnac does-to view the geometric ele- ments on portable forms as the foundation for graphics or written language is, of course, the controversial aspect to her study, and one that has not received much serious attention in the literature. If it can be argued that there are at least two important lines of inquiry, in general, that are emergent and must be encouraged, they would be 1) the demonstration and comprehension of the diversity and range of imagery (and of all the associated techniques, production stages, media, locales, associations, and uses) and 2) the pursuit of con- text: who was using the caves or other media, how, and why? This is a call for more commitment to a framework that emphasizes diversity and contexts. Although this ap- pears to be an empirical and descriptive goal (if interpreted narrowly), it is so only in part. The necessary theoretical implications will be discussed in subsequent sections of this essay. One important contribution to this diversity-contextual framework is the 1979 monograph, Lascaux Inconnu (Le- roi-Gourhan and Allain 1979). It is a landmark mono- graph because here (and elsewhere: Arlette Leroi-Gourhan 1982) the accumulated studies of the abundant engravings and of the rich archaeological materials are reported. The authors and associated specialists report on prehistoric scaffolding for painting, on the burins for engraving (in- cluding use-wear studies), on the rope impressions in as- sociation with the place where one would have descended into the painted "well," and on the pigment-processing activities and chemistry. The monograph also provides drawings of the hundreds of engravings traced by the Abbe Glory, whose excavations provided most of the ar- chaeological materials including pigments, lamp frag- ments, burins, and other tools for engraving. Here, then, we have a monograph that contributes significantly to the comprehension of diversity-Lascaux is much more than a painted gallery of splendor-and to some understanding of context, complete with a suite of "4C dates that shows a relatively limited period of cave use by the painters/ engravers. In fact, there is now increasing emphasis on the specific archaeological contexts of the so-called "art caves." Moure- Romanillo and Gonzalez-Morales (1984) have been work-</page><page sequence="6">418 A Review ofResearch in "PaleolithicArt"/Conkey ing with the pigments and associated tools recovered from the earth in front of the painted panel at Tito Bustillo (Asturias, Spain). Begouen and Clottes plan excavation (in 1987) of the very thin archaeological layer in the Salle du Foyer at Les Trois Freres (Ariege, France). This project continues their archaeological work in the caves of the Volp, in which they have found a variety of tools and objects related to image-making that were abandoned and even stuck in crevices of walls and elsewhere (Begouen and Clottes 1981). Garcia is continuing his work on the footprints left in many "art caves"-Pech-Merle (Lot, France; see Duday and Garcia 1983); Fontanet (Ariege, France); and l'Al- dene (Herault, France)-that allow inferences on who trod there and under what conditions. At Pech-Merle, for example, the analysts suggest that the footprints were left by a single individual; this finding does not support the original idea that these were the prints of a female and a child (an "initiate") involved in some rituals in this "cave- temple" (see also Lorblanchet 1981). Last, in terms of the international literature, anyone who is serious about the study of paleolithic imagery, and who must first grasp its range and forms and as much of the context as possible, must refer to at least the following two publications of the 1980s. First, there is the magnif- icent Atlas des Grottes Ornies Paliolithiques Frangaises, the first in a series of archaeological atlases issued by the Ministere de la Culture (1984) in Paris. In this instance, the bulk of the text was prepared by J. Clottes, J. Combier, and J-Ph. Rigaud. The general opinion on this 673-page volume is that nothing comparable has been issued since Leroi-Gourhan (1965); it provides uniform and compa- rable descriptions (on a region-by-region basis), maps, locations, and even schedules for visits to as many sites as could be listed, major and otherwise. Second, at a more modest scale but more extensive geographically is the volume prepared in conjunction with the 1985 exhibit at the Musde de l'Homme (Paris) of the same title: Art et Civilization des Chasseurs de la Prthistoire: 34,000--8,000 Ans Avant J.C. (Musde de l'Homme et Musde des Antiquities National 1985).4 Here there is a most useful summary (in French) of the Upper Paleolithic/ Late Pleistocene and a period-by-period catalogue of im- portant sites that have yielded both portable and wall art, with photographs and summaries of research and excava- tion at each locale. Of more limited range, but unique in its approach, is the small booklet distributed in conjunc- tion with the 1984 Perigueux colloquium on "wall art," "Decouvertes de l'Art des Grottes et des Abris" (Centre National de Prehistoire 1984), which briefly describes and illustrates some 23 French cave/shelter sites in the chron- ological sequence of their discovery, from 1878 (Chabot; Gard, France) to 1983 (Jovelle; Dordogne, France). The English-language publications, unfortunately, re- main relatively few in number. Ucko and Rosenfeld's (1967) fine critical synopsis of Leroi-Gourhan's early (1965) structuralist framework is now out of print; here was the first significant call for addressing the diversity of imagery and for improvements in theoretical approaches. Sieveking's The Cave Artists (1979) is a very useful, ar- chaeologically-oriented summary (by region), with maps and photographs, dealing only with the imagery on cave walls and following the Leroi-Gourhan idea of the my- thogram for its interpretive base. Pfeiffer's The Creative Explosion (1982) ranges more widely; it is explicitly an- thropological in drawing on contemporary hunter-gath- erer literature as well as that of cognitive evolution in order to place the cave imagery into an interpretive frame- work that stresses the "art" as central to initiation cere- monies and a general Upper Paleolithic "information ex- plosion." Although this is an excellent book for classroom use (as is Hadingham 1979) and as an introduction to the images in some wider behavioral context, the initiation- ceremony hypothesis can be only a partial, albeit provoc- ative, explanation. Other analyses in English (e.g., Conkey 1985; Gamble 1982; Jochim 1983; Mellars 1985) will be discussed be- low; most approach the imagery (or certain classes of imagery) in terms of the adaptive-systems framework con- gruent with Anglo-American archaeology of the 1970s. The limits to these as functionalist approaches ("all roads lead to social solidarity" [Lewis-Williams 1982: 431]) are being recognized, and alternative approaches are being tried out (see, for example, Conkey [1982] for an attempt at "reading" image-spaces and interpreting iconic values, or Faris [1984] for an interesting critique of structuralist approaches to "art," in general, and a statement on his own historical-materialist reading of paleolithic imagery). What is more, as will be noted in the conclusions, there are those who are venturing into more reflective, if not 4. Inspired by the French exhibit, the American Museum of Natural History in New York prepared "Dark Caves, Bright Visions: Life in Ice Age Europe" (October, 1986 through January, 1987). Here, thanks to generous loans of materials from the Muse des Antiquites Nationales, the Musce de l'Homme, the Mus&amp; d'Aquitaine, and several other mu- seums and private collections, one of the most extensive collections of Upper Paleolithic "art" ever to be assembled in a single locale was exhibited. The show was curated by Ian Tattersall of the American Museum of Natural History and by guest curator Randall White. The catalogue (White 1986b) provides a magnificent photographic display of many objects never before published, along with a succinct, up-to- date text.</page><page sequence="7">Journal of FieldArchaeology/Vol. 14, 1987 419 critical, positions on the "meaning of paleolithic art," es- pecially as a topic of our archaeological discourse (e.g., Conkey 1983, 1984; Davis 1986; Preziosi 1982; Ucko and Layton 1984). Material Culture and the Production of Meaning When the literature and research activities are taken together, one can make a good case for serious attention being given to detailing and demonstrating the diversity of what now we condense under the term, "paleolithic art." If this research goes as far as it should, the term should disappear from the literature. In addition, this in- quiry into diversity may be taken as more than (or even other than) a continued empiricist, antiquarian, descrip- tive endeavor; it may be one that has significant theoretical and interpretive implications. And, of course, there are those who would argue that studies in "paleolithic art" had best undergo theoretical renovations, lest they remain the "stagnant" and subjective endeavor that some see them to be at present (e.g., Ucko and Layton 1984). Some (Ucko and Rosenfeld 1967, for example) have long argued for this attention to diversity, a diversity that was so easily subsumed under the seductive structuralist visions of early Leroi-Gourhan (1965), by the predispo- sition to focus on the "cave and wall art" at the expense of dozens of other media, by the problems of dating the images on the walls that invited the stylistically-based con- tinuous and gradualistic chronologies, and by a pervasive tendency to view the "art" as a phenomenon of the Upper Paleolithic as a whole. Coupled with the prevailing views of hunter-gatherers as fluid, flexible, well-adapted, and ecologically-sensitive societies, the implied social continu- ity of the Upper Paleolithic, derived from its continuity in "art," has resulted in an almost-utopian notion of the Upper Paleolithic period as one of harmony and equilib- rium (Conkey 1984). The following section of this review intends to show not only that the pursuit of diversity is becoming a central feature of "paleolithic art" research, but also that the rec- ognition of diversity can challenge the notion of utopian social homogeneity and that systematic inquiry into that diversity provides one of the best ways to access the field of meaning. First, there are indeed the necessarily descrip- tive and formal analyses of various media and classes of imagery (e.g., Cattelain [1979, 1980] on spear-throwers; Bellier [1982, 1984] on the contours decoupis, or bone cutouts of animal heads, and the Dellucs' [1978] reanalysis of the Aurignacian engraved blocks). Also, there are new finds that continue to expand old categories and to chal- lenge our notions of the range of paleolithic imagery, such as the early Aurignacian animal statuettes and engraved pieces from Geissenkl6sterle (Hahn 1982) or the open-air engravings in the French Pyrenees (Bahn 1985) and in Spain (Beltran 1984; Fortea-Perez 1981). It is in two ways that some of these studies (and others) are making significant contributions to the deconstruction (that is, a deliberate taking apart of concepts, ideas, or building blocks of certain taken-for-granted notions) of the monolithic views on "paleolithic art": 1) they are either implicitly or explicitly contributing to the definition of different culturally-standardized systems of visual rep- resentation, and 2) this ultimately challenges any inclusive interpretations and, in particular, is leading to very explicit disassociation of "wall art" from "portable art" and pos- sibly from a third class of media, art-sur-bloc or the en- graved blocks. This disassociation at least allows for the possibility that different conceptual formations and differ- ent cultural premises may have generated the imagery and made it differentially meaningful to its makers and users. What is more, given that humans are simultaneously ma- terialists and symbolists, and given the multivalent, mul- tivocal nature of human symbolic systems, it is likely that we will only be able to access any meanings of paleolithic imagery by detailed study of the difering materials, media, and images. And we may also have to approach these as individual sets before we can move on to elucidating any principles, patterns, contexts, or associations that could provide clues to the conceptual formations and to the cultural premises that generated the ways in which, or why, these images may have been meaningful to some Upper Paleolithic peoples. That Leroi-Gourhan's struc- turalist approach was so provocative and appealing is due to this very kind of analytical strategy; he showed how there might have been at least one major culturally-stan- dardized (ideal) system of visual representation. In 1965, Leroi-Gourhan first drew upon aspects of portable "art" as a referent and as a support for the gender- based system of principles for cave-painting, and he sug- gested that the same general principles governed its im- agery (Leroi-Gourhan 1983). By 1982, the only remain- ing sexual symbolism in his work focuses on the cave itself as a female form, but the animal classes are not linked (or derived from) gender. What is more, there is no "portable art" providing support for, or a referent to, the mytho- gram. It was not by chance that the opening paper5 of the 5. The reader will note that there are many references to papers presented at the 1984 "Colloque International d'Art Parietal Palkolit- hique." Although abstracts and syntheses of these papers were distributed among the participants and subsequently to others, and the presentations were reviewed by Lorblanchet (1985) in his published conference sum- mary, the formal publication of the proceedings, coordinated by J-Ph. Rigaud, is still in progress.</page><page sequence="8">420 A Review ofResearch in "PaleolithicArt"/Conkey 1984 Perigueux colloquium on "wall art" was by Delporte (1984b), who emphasized and illustrated the considerable differences in "artistic expression" between portable and wall manifestations. By now, there appears to be a widespread acceptance of the differences between wall and portable imagery and forms. Some of the recent research and interpretation by Vialou (1981, 1982, 1983a, 1984a, 1984b, 1984c) draws out this idea using a contrastive structure. On the one hand, he stresses the uniqueness of the contexts of wall "art"-the "cave-ness." More than Leroi-Gourhan, Vialou (1982) envisions the cave itself as a part of the structure and signification of the imagery, which are embedded in the entire three-dimensional volume of each individual cave. On the other hand, he contrasts this cave-ness with what he envisions to be the predominant tempo of Upper Paleolithic lifeways-mobility. We know there was much exchange, with movement of goods (including mobile "art"), raw materials, even fauna, and surely of people. His "reading" of the caves and their imagery is taken from the contrast they make in a sociocultural milieu of mobil- ity: the decorated caves are a cultural immobilization of- a way of fixing-symbolic givens (Vialou 1981, 1983a: 95). The suggestion is that a grand meaning of "cave art" may at least in part be derived from how it is different from and contrasted to "portable art." Even further, Vialou (like B. Delluc and G. Delluc [1984]) suggests that the engraved and sculpted blocks (art-sur-bloc) comprise a third and distinct class from the cave and portable materials (Vialou 1984c). Again, to make his point, he invokes metaphors of mobility and attributes of content and context. These engraved blocks are considered to be semi-mobile "art," neither fixed nor removed from daily or occupation sites (as are the deco- rated caves); nor are they very transportable over long distances, as are the engraved or carved bone and antler objects of portable "art." Rather, these blocks are poten- tially moveable within a site, and a site could be trans- formed by simply moving them around. What is more, he argues that some of the grand sites with blocks (such as Limeuil and La Marche) have inventories of subject matter that are either unique (as at Limeuil) or, as at La Marche, are in striking contrast to the inventory of animal species or themes that Leroi-Gourhan (1965) has shown for the caves. In the latter, certain associations and species pre- dominate (e.g., horse and bison), whereas at La Marche, there is an unusual number of human depictions and dif- ferent associations of figures than Leroi-Gourhan finds in the caves. Although far from substantiated, these may be some of the necessary first rounds in symbolic inquiry that sort out the marking or at least marked features of the imagery, its contexts, and its content. Thus, Vialou has added another dimension to those claims for diversity, even at the general level of different media classes. In his own detailed re- search on the painted caves (particularly those in the French Pyrenees), Vialou has made certain challenges to the unity of the mythogram as applied to the cave imagery alone. Having defined three levels of variation among the com- positions in caves, (themes, thematic liaisons, and what he calls "symbolic constructions"), Vialou argues (1981, 1983a) that while there may be conformance to some ideal principles of representational composition, each "wall art" site is best considered as an original symbolic construction. There are so many local or individual variations on the basic mythogram (he contrasts Niaux, for example, with nearby Fontanet) that it is more the exception than oth- erwise to document similarities between any two or several sites along the three structural axes or compositional levels that he has identified. Each cave reveals its own symbolic construction, and the frequency and diversity of themes plus the multiplicity of thematic liaisons point to the "ir- reducible originality" of each Paleolithic site. This is clearly beyond, if not a challenge to, the ideas of Leroi-Gourhan. Vialou's work and inferences suggest that it is no longer completely demonstrable that whatever unity exists in wall "art" is derived from a religion or common metaphysique that persisted over the millennia. There can no longer be, he argues, a homogeneous notion of "paleolithic wall art" (Vialou 1983b: 264). In addition to this kind of a challenge to the Leroi- Gourhan hypothesis, there are at least three other kinds of significant contributions toward firmly establishing that the baseline for interpreting any of this material culture must emphasize diversity and contexts. First, there are the contributions of Alexander Marshack, and now also some studies that complement his two major lines of inquiry: the framework for cognitive evolution and the micropho- tographic documentation of object-use through time. Sec- ond, there are those studies that adopt more ambitious theoretical and anthropological perspectives for restricted classes of imagery (e.g., Conkey 1985; Gamble 1982; Jochim 1983). Third, there are the ways in which the repertoire or inventory is being modified, either by con- tinued new discoveries (as of engraved walls, paintings, engraved blocks, etc.) or by more systematic inventories of dispersed and unstudied museum collections. Marshack continues with a two-pronged approach. On the one hand, there is the evolutionary "cultural brain" perspective (Marshack 1984a, 1985a) in which the visual imagery of the Upper Paleolithic and some of the inferred</page><page sequence="9">Journal of FieldArchaeology/Vol. 14, 1987 421 motor skills (such as two-handedness) are used to derive inferences about cognition and aspects of neurological organization. This has, of course, been a longstanding interest and concern of his (e.g., Marshack 1972b, 1976). At the same time, Marshack's analytical emphasis has been particularly focused on the demonstration of the use-and even more importantly-reuse of some portable artifacts (e.g., 1984b, 1985b, 1986). This line of inquiry converges with the observations made by others (e.g., Vandiver n.d.; Lorblanchet 1985) with regard to the re- newal of painted imagery in some caves. These observa- tions open up another set of questions that fit well within the rubric of diversity-contextual inquiry, as described above. For example, what should prove most interesting would be the extension of these studies to include com- parisons that indicate which caves (or which parts of caves) show renewals and which do not (for example, Lorblanchet contrasts the renewals at Cougnac with the lack of them at nearby Pech-Merle) and, if there are any consistencies or patterns, which images (animals, species, signs) are those that were renewed or supplemented. The penultimate questions would then include: why were these particular animals, signs, compositions, cave locales, or caves those that received renewals and reuse, and, thus, why could this have made them meaningful for those making and using the imagery? The same questions should be phrased for those portable objects shown to have been renewed. In addition to the continued work of Marshack at the more inclusive scale of the evolutionary and cognitive implications of Paleolithic image-making, another recent contribution to the evolutionary perspective is that by Whitney Davis (1986), who addresses the "origins of image-making" from the position that the development of representation is not evidence for a sudden and "mysteri- ously-gifted" population of modern humans "with a uniquely new projective aesthetic faculty" (Davis 1986: 215). Rather, Davis provides an account for the emer- gence and specific features of the earliest representational material as we know it. What is more he, too, emphasizes that we must "remain sensitive to the logical differences between representation and other marking strategies or sign systems" (Davis 1986: 202, emphasis mine). It is unlikely that any one account can be given for the whole "figurative system" of Paleo- lithic symbolism in that such an inclusive notion as this "figurative system" most likely comprises the "simulta- neous use of several sign systems" (Davis 1986: 202). Thus, for example, Marshack's work with the portable pieces and the evidence for their reuse is perhaps seen as being about one (or possibly more) of such sign systems as well as an important analytical contribution to the de- sirable but long-term project of identifying and specifying the range of sign systems and their relationships, histories, and contexts. Both Marshack and Davis are addressing a long-stand- ing feature of "paleolithic art" studies; namely, that "pa- leolithic art" has received much of its attention because of its assumed or potential role in the larger narrative ac- counts of "sapiensization," that is, in how anatomically- modern humans came to replace neanderthals in Eurasia, came to be "like us," and appear in the archaeological record as a "segment of ethnography" (Isaac 1976: 283). Although recent biological evidence suggests that fully modern humans (Homo sapiens sapiens) appear earlier in other parts of the world (see Smith and Spencer 1984), and that their appearance in sw Europe is comparatively late, this has not minimized the assumed correlation be- tween an achievement of full anatomical modernity and an "explosion" of symbolic behaviors. This is a view that has received increasing support in the popular literature (Dennell 1986; Pfeiffer 1986; Wilford 1986), although until it is demonstrated that an "explosion" occurred and can be linked to specifically Homo sapiens sapiens capacities, the association remains essentially "vitalistic" (Conkey 1983). Some other recent works have offered alternative views on why an "Upper Paleolithic Revolution" occurred. Gil- man, for example, not only provides a solid challenge to the biological approach, but also develops a historical- materialist case that "rituals expressing social solidarity came to have increasing salience in Upper Paleolithic ma- terial culture . . . because the basis for [necessary cooper- ation] had become more problematical" (Gilman 1983: 122). Other explicitly anthropological studies, such as Conkey (1985), Gamble (1982), or Jochim (1983) provide plau- sible, processual, and yet not completely satisfactory ac- counts. All address specific classes of media (engraved bones/antlers, female figurines, and cave art, respectively) in the context of models for Upper Paleolithic social ge- ography. Although they all attempt to make linkages be- tween particular kinds of imagery and particular sociocul- tural contexts, these contexts are still at too broad and inclusive a level to give us much confidence in the linkage. Gamble proposes that female figurines were part of the development and maintenance of socioecologically-neces- sary regional alliance networks (that is, a means for reaf- firming networks needed in the face of environmental changes and concomitant social realignments); Conkey (1985) suggests that concentrations of material culture and a growing complexity of the symbolic repertoire into</page><page sequence="10">422 A Review ofResearch in "PaleolithicArt"/Conkey different culturally-standardized systems of visual repre- sentation can be understood in the context of hunter- gatherer reorganizations, perhaps at "aggregration" sites. Jochim suggests that cave paintings, found in only one area of Europe, may be related to the Franco-Cantabrian region's being a climatic refuge, with the resultant need for social (via symbolic) negotiations over space. All three can be identified, with varying degrees, as functionalist approaches; all three rely on as-yet unde- monstrated higher-order processes or stresses (e.g., scalar stress related to changing group size [Conkey 1985]; demographic stress [Jochim 1983]; stresses from environ- mental change and geographically more extensive social obligations [Gamble 1982]). Exactly why the medium in question (e.g., female figurines or cave art) would cement or solve socio-spatial problems is not fully addressed, ex- cept insofar as a general theory is proposed about the role of material culture as ritual (Conkey 1985). Despite many recent critiques of an adaptationist approach in archaeol- ogy (e.g., Hodder 1982, 1986), these recent inquiries into some classes of "paleolithic art" do raise the possibility of social analysis of the production of particular artifacts, even though the linkages are yet a little obscure. What is more, these studies might contribute to the first rounds in the search for meanings if the underlying ques- tion were rephrased. We should ask why-in a very par- ticular sense-would these particular images, in these par- ticular media, contexts, and associations have been meaningful in the social negotiations/renegotiations that are implied by each of these three hypotheses: regional alliances; aggregation and social reorganizations; and pop- ulation displacements and territorial readjustments. Last, in terms of documenting diversity, it is clear that the repertoire of Upper Paleolithic materials and imagery is far from established. New statuettes (see, for example, Delporte, Mons, and Schmider 1982; Klima 1983), en- graved shelters (e.g., Aujoulat et al. 1984) and blocks (e.g., Begouen et al. 1982), paintings (see, for example, Beltran [1984] for a review of Spanish finds; Larribau [1982, 1984]; Lorblanchet [1984]), and "portable art" (e.g., Hahn 1982) are regularly reported. There are also the reworkings of old assemblages of engraved bone/antler in light of specific interpretive hypotheses (e.g., Chollot- Varagnac 1980; Conkey 1980), and new inventories of "art-sur-bloc" (Delluc and Delluc 1978, 1984). And, with the general enthusiasm for refitting of archaeological spec- imens from a single site, there are such attempts, especially with the fragmented engraved blocks from such sites as Limeul (particularly by workers at the Musde des Anti- quitis Nationales) or Enlkne (Begouen et al. 1982). White (1986a) is inventorying a previously dormant but rich collection of European materials housed at the Logan Museum of Beloit College. Bahn, Cole, and Couraud (Bahn and Cole 1986) have done the same for an extensive collection of Pyrenean materials housed at Chicago's Field Museum. In conclusion, it is now mandatory to view "paleolithic art" as an extremely diverse and abundant repertoire of material culture that cannot be accounted for by any in- clusive interpretive umbrella except perhaps as "cultural." Because the diversity and the differential distributions in time and space have not been highlighted, we have not developed the ways in which these variants might be used as a means of gaining access to understanding the contexts of use and meanings. We have concentrated on what the art "means" rather than on how these images and forms might have made them meaningful. Because the diversity of forms, of contexts, or of content are now being made explicit, I suggest there is great potential for answering the latter question. The last major section of this review will pursue one further, more specific line of research that has, I believe, considerable potential for understanding the conceptual formations that may have generated this imagery. Production as Meaning? The past decade of paleolithic art research has increas- ingly included studies of the technologies of image-mak- ing, through both experimental (Dauvois 1977; Delporte and Mons 1980; Lorblanchet 1980; Mons 1972; New- comer 1977) and analytical (Couraud 1983; Moure-Ro- manillo 1984; Vandiver n.d.) studies. On the one hand, this trend is very much in congruence with wider trends in archaeology and European prehistory. Among Anglo- Americans one could argue that there has been a certain re-examination of the archaeological record and the ma- terials that comprise it in the form of middle-range re- search, actualistic studies, and concerns with refitting and site-formation processes. Certainly experimental archae- ology, refitting, and use-wear studies have added to the long-standing European tradition of a direct concern with the record. On the other hand, it is a very different endeavor to extract and further develop the theoretical implications of those studies that have elucidated the technological or productive processes that bring the imagery and forms into existence. At the moment, most of these studies have led to descriptions of the techniques used to engrave bone (e.g., Delporte and Mons 1980), to paint images (Lor- blanchet 1980), to process pigments (Couraud and Lam-</page><page sequence="11">Journal of Field Archaeology/Vol. 14, 1987 423 ing-Emperaire 1979; Couraud 1983; Vandiver n.d.), to engrave or sculpt on blocks (e.g., Delporte 1973; Del- porte and Mons 1973; Mons 1974; Silio 1982), or to manufacture pendants or "necklace-elements" (White 1987). From most we get an appreciation of the com- plexity and skill of the techniques involved or a sense of how much time image-making involved, but without any theoretical framework to explain how these productive activities are related to "meaning," the studies will remain primarily descriptive. This section will present just a few of the observations and inferences that these studies of techniques have yielded. I will also suggest how a theoretical framework might be developed and applied to carry these studies beyond description and toward aspects of "meaning." A number of interesting observations have resulted from the studies of "technological generating processes." For example, studies of the pigments used at Lascaux have expanded our knowledge of pigments to show that these "paintings" are the result of very complex and sophisti- cated pigment-processing knowledge and activities (Ar- lette Leroi-Gourhan 1982; Couraud and Laming-Emper- aire 1979; Vandiver n.d.). It has been shown that the paintings and images take on many of their stylistic attri- butes because of the kinds of pigments used, the colors used, and the ways in which these were prepared and applied. The analysis of the reds and blacks, for example, shows how the differing structural properties of the raw materials and how they can be processed are responsible for the use of black as a long outline color in what are really drawings (not paintings), and of red as a shading or filler (Vandiver n.d.). Just as Delporte and Mons (e.g., 1977) have shown ways in which engraved bones and antlers bear images that are derived from the shapes and techniques of work- ing different raw materials, the Lascaux "paintings" are the result of interaction between raw material, technique, and image intended. This, I believe, we can call "techno- logical style" (Lechtman 1976). Furthermore, much of the "wonder" or, at least, the "brilliance" of the Lascaux imagery has been shown (Vandiver n.d.) to be due to very specific combinations of natural phenomena and human actions: mixing pigments with clays with a relatively high index of refraction; use of limestone-rich cave water that provides a medium for recrystallization; natural recrystal- lization of calcite in cave walls; and evidence for reappli- cation of pigments after recrystallization. From these stud- ies it is clear that techniques and technology cannot be set aside from the "style" of these images. What is more, there is always the possibility that the techniques and acts of production and reproduction of these images may be part of their meaning. Another set of studies has been based on experimental replications of imagery. Techniques of formal analysis, instead of stylistic comparison, have been used to derive inferences about the relative unity of the visual images, such as the cervids at Lascaux (Vialou 1984a), or within an entire region (e.g., the Basque area of northern Spain [Apellaniz 1982]). Lorblanchet (1980) can now convinc- ingly argue that the Black Frieze at Pech-Merle was the work of a single artist, who did preliminary sketches of the figures and executed them quickly, so that the entire frieze could have been done in only an hour. Instead of pigment processing to get adequate texture, the painter here used a little stick to make a trough in the wall that "held" the color. From this and other archaeological evi- dence at Pech-Merle, it is hard to accept the traditional interpretation that this cave was revisited often by the "faithful." Rather, there appears to have been only a rel- atively brief stay, with little evidence for revisits, and even these (in the principal gallery) seem to be only in relation to the painting (Lorblanchet 1985). The contrast in pig- ment-processing between Lascaux and Pech-Merle is strik- ing. Lorblanchet also contrasts the absence of imagery renewal in the main panels at Pech-Merle with the evi- dence for such "successive renovations" at nearby Cou- gnac, which also evidences a long utilization of the cave and the "possible existence of multiple subterranean rites" (Lorblanchet 1985: 9). Even within the Pech-Merle cave system, Lorblanchet (1986) has noted variations; there do appear to be some renewals in the Combel gallery that is attached to Pech-Merle. It is these contrasts in technolog- ical processes that are interesting and may be relevant to understanding the use of the caves, the use of the imagery, and their "meanings." Although these studies and others (such as those in process with the coloring materials excavated below the painted panel at Tito Bustillo [Moure-Romanillo and Gonzales-Morales 1984]) might appear to be those of "purely" technological processes, they are concerned, of course, about how the imagery comes into existence in the first place. The kinds of questions that these studies could answer include how the images we are studying were embedded in the productive processes of Upper Pa- leolithic life, what the conceptual formations behind the imagery were and whether we can even approach the topic of meaning without some handle on conceptual forma- tions. The kind of theoretical framework that might relate these studies to the search for "meanings" is one that</page><page sequence="12">424 A Review ofResearch in "PaleolithicArt"/Conkey entertains the possibility that the stages of making things, the technological acts themselves, might comprise or con- tribute to a metaphoric scheme for other symbolic systems (see Lechtman 1976, 1984; or Adams 1971). This frame- work would involve a shift of emphasis away from the adaptive-systems approach that promotes the idea that technological systems and behaviors are primarily a me- diator between society and the natural world and are a vehicle through which humans exploit environments and resources, and through which they adapt. The shift would be toward a view of technological systems and behaviors as a source for creating and maintaining a symbolically- meaningful environment. That is, material culture is pro- duced, but not just to use or not even just to "mean." Rather, technology is viewed as ideology, production as meaning. It could be argued that experimental studies of various Upper Paleolithic media and technologies are be- ginning to provide exactly the kind of baseline for an- swering the kinds of questions that are posed above. Some Conclusions In his presentation at the 1984 colloquium on parietal "art" in Perigueux, France, Ucko boldly declared to the assembled European researchers that the current state of the art is completely dominated by implicit personal pre- suppositions (Ucko and Layton 1984; Lorblanchet 1985). These charges (and how they were received and devel- oped) show that some of the issues dominating prehistoric art studies elsewhere have barely emerged among "paleo- lithic art" scholars, including the heated debate among those who study rock art of Southern Africa, where the empiricist nature of much previous research has been soundly challenged by Lewis-Williams (1983b, 1983c, 1984a) and others (Davis 1985). Much of Ucko's critique focuses on the assumptions behind analytical methods and on the unquestioned goals of research. Should we, for example, focus on the identi- fication of animal species and subspecies in the "art," on the determiniation of images? Is this what was of concern to the paleolithic image-makers (Ucko and Layton 1984: 9)? What are the underlying (often functional and/or eth- nocentric) implications of the terms and categories we use, such as "anthropomorphs" (see also Ucko and Rosenfeld 1972), "schematization" or "realism," or even "portable art"? Ucko's challenge appears to be part of a wider con- cern for the practice of archaeological inquiry. Interest- ingly enough, this concern seems to appear most often in archaeological studies that try to approach the field of "meaning" (e.g., Davis 1984; Hodder 1982; Leone 1982; Lewis-Williams 1982, 1983b). "Paleolithic art" studies have, of course, been particu- larly susceptible to assumed premises of the ritual and symbolic nature of the imagery, while-at the same time- there has been little explicit presentation of the underlying theoretical assumptions that motivate and propel any re- search. Phrased more strongly is Davis' reminder (1985: 9) of "the strong covert influence of powerful modern ideologies" on what constitutes some of the fundamental categories we have defined, such as an image or a com- position. We "continue to rely upon unexamined institu- tions about image-making and sign-systems derived from our own cultural experience" (Davis 1985: 9). Among the reflexive or more self-conscious inquiries into the assumptions and practice of "paleolithic art" re- search are those by Preziosi (1982), Conkey (1983, 1984), and Bahn (1986). Some of these works challenge the status ascribed to "paleolithic art" as representing the "origins" of human artistic traditions (e.g., Preziosi 1982; Conkey 1983) and show how such a frame of reference has, in fact, determined the relevant subsequent questions, which are both produced by and constitute contemporary ideologies more than they yield significant insights into the past. These questions become non-questions once the imagery is reconceptualized as part of the historically- contingent differential production and reproduction of material and possibly symbolic repertoires (see also Davis 1986). Bahn's challenge (1986) is more along the lines of some of Ucko's concerns in terms of in questioning the assumed identification of certain motifs or engraved shapes. In this case, Bahn challenges those shapes on Au- rignacian blocks that have been unquestionably "identi- fied" as female vulvae, or, at least, as vulvoids (see Mar- shack's 1986 reply). Clottes' (1986; see also Begoven and Clottes 1987) concern for problems of methods and un- questioned assumptions is one other exception to Ucko's challenges to the way in which other researchers proceed. In another kind of critique, Lorblanchet notes that the 1984 Perigueux colloquium marks the "end of the reign of the chercheur-roi [the individual, self-contained, and independent researcher], working in splendid isolation" (Lorblanchet 1985: 12). He notes the necessity of collab- oration among specialists and that research into degrada- tion (of cave painting) is just as crucial as research into meaning; in fact, the two types of research are comple- mentary. Along the same lines as noted above with regard to the studies of "technological generating processes," Lorblanchet recognizes that insights into the way the im- ages are made and have been preserved (such as those studied by the artists who eventually created Lascaux II, the facsimile of Lascaux) are just as necessary to any "read-</page><page sequence="13">Journal of FieldArchaeology/Vol. 14, 1987 425 ing" of meaning as are those insights previously thought only possible by the chercheur-roi. All of these critiques raise the broader epistemological and methodological questions of how one "reads" imag- ery. These are questions being addressed directly in other rock and prehistoric art studies, and must be brought, as Ucko argues, to the center stage of "paleolithic art" re- search. The "texts," or whatever we think we are reading, are not given but, are, in fact, made. Without the rich ethnographic and ethnohistorical records that have played so large a role in recent studies of both Southern African (e.g., Lewis-Williams 1981a, 1982, 1983a) and Australian rock art (e.g., Vinnicombe 1986), the "reading" of paleo- lithic imagery appears particularly challenging and neces- sarily subject to intense critical scrutiny. Although there is notable contrast, for example, be- tween the increasingly inclusive trance hypothesis that ac- counts for much Southern African imagery, and the mul- tivalent, multivocal interpretations reported by Vinnicombe (1986) for some Australian imagery, both of these ethnographically-rooted studies are two different ap- proaches to the same problem that must also be grasped by those working with Upper Paleolithic imagery. We cannot expect to capture "meaning" as a single, inclusive, empirical entity or category of our inquiry. Although I have tried to show how the past seven years have witnessed a fairly intense level of research activity and publication in "paleolithic art" studies, it should be equally clear that without important theoretical develop- ments, and the explicit wedding of theory to practice-if not the recognition of theory as practice (and vice-versa)- it could well be the case that we will never achieve greater insights into why these varying images were meaningful in the varying sociocultural contexts of some Upper Paleo- lithic peoples. In particular, I have tried to show how the recognition and demonstration of diversity of the imagery should be a liberation from the confines of inclusive theories on the meaning of paleolithic imagery. What is more, it is sug- gested that an emphasis on diversity and on contexts of all sorts can provide major new lines of inquiry. I suggest, for example, that some of the studies of "technological style" or a materials-oriented approach not only can lead to identification of the marking and marked features that are sought in the first round of symbolic interpretation, but will also be able to "displace the question of meaning from the individual boundaries of particular images" to the productive contexts within which the imagery "comes to be invested with (partial) meaning" (Preziosi 1982: 325). Acknowledgments To write a review of current research on "paleolithic art," with an emphasis on the search for "meaning," was suggested to me by Peter Wells. I am most grateful to him for his stimulus and encouragement. As a review, this would never have approximated the current state of the literature without the significant bibliographic help of Frangoise Audouze, Roy Larick, Jean-Philippe Rigaud, Denis Vialou, the library of the University of California at Berkeley, and, most especially, the assistance of Paul Bahn. I would also like to thank Randy White and Glen Cole for providing information on unpublished work and Pam Vandiver for having sent me a copy of her 1983 M.A. thesis (now being prepared for publication) on pig- ment-processing, which has been a most stimulating piece of research. The comments by various reviewers and col- leagues have been particularly insightful and challenging, and I regret having been unable to address within the space of this article all the issues they raised. In particular, thanks go to J. Clottes, W. Davis, M. Jochim, A. Mar- shack, J. Sackett, M. Wobst, and the editorial staff of this journal. Margaret Conkey received her Ph.D. from the University of Chicago in 1978. Until recently, she taught at the State Uni- versity ofNew York at Binghamton; she is currently an associ- ate professor in the Department ofAnthropology at the Uni- versity of California, Berkeley. Dr. Conkey has been working for two decades with sites and materials of the sw European Paleolithic. Past research includes structural analysis of designs on engraved bones and antlers from Cantabrian Magdalen- ian sites, and she is now extending this analysis to materials from the French (Aridge) Pyrenees. She has also written on the use of style in archaeology and on archaeology and the study of gender. Mailing address: Department ofAnthropology, Uni- versity of California, Berkeley, CA 94720.
