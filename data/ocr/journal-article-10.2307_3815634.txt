Printed in United States of America women in the driver's seat: The auto-erotics of early women's films Jennifer Parchesky n the first quarter of the twentieth century, women drivers of automobiles emerged as signal figures of the 'New Womanhood' Freed from both the confines of the domestic sphere and dependence on male drivers, they embodied an autonomous mobility that challenged conventional gender roles. Operating recalcitrant vehicles in often hazardous conditions, early women motorists - especially the celebrated race car drivers and cross-country pio- neers - demonstrated 'masculine' courage, stamina and technical skill. While such unladylike behavior did not go uncensured, the press and public on the whole celebrated the woman motorist - typically young, affluent and attractive - as a positive symbol of female emancipation,. As previous scholars have observed, automo- biles figured prominently both in the on-screen ex- ploits of a new breed of action heroines and in off-screen publicity about stars' personal vehicles, from images of'serial queen' Helen Holmes repairing her own stunt car (infant daughter at her side) to Anita King's highly publicised Paramount-sponsored transcontinental solo journey in 1915.2 Yet there are even broader parallels between the pioneering women motorists and the women directors, produc- ers, screenwriters and stars who sat, metaphorically, in the 'driver's seat' of so much of the early film industry. Not only actors but women in all branches of the industry were celebrated in fan magazines, the mainstream press, and even girls' dime novels as hardworking, technically skilled and courageous, holding their own in a man's world in conditions that were fast-paced, physically demanding, and subject to all kinds of human and natural disasters.3 Like women motorists, women directors emphasised the technical demands of their craft - '[k]nowledge of camera operation, of lighting effects, and of all the hundred-and-one less important mechanical details' - even as they insisted that 'there is no reason why [a woman] cannot completely master every techni- cality of the art'.4 While women in both fields tended to emphasise individual achievements over collec- tive struggle, both motoring and filmmaking were deeply imbricated in the larger feminist movement. Suffragists promoted their cause with both spectacu- lar cross-country automobile tours and stirring propaganda films throughout the 1910s; in 1913, when California women won the vote, director Lois Weber and a coalition of studio women made na- tional headlines by sweeping to victory the nation's first all-female municipal government in the newly incorporated Universal City,5 Whether behind the wheel or behind the camera, women's mastery of exciting new technologies offered a spectacular im- age of New Womanhood as both practical power and thrilling adventure. In this essay, I examine three films about fe- male automobility in which women held key positions of creative control: Mabel at the Wheel (1914), di- rected by and starring Mabel Normand; Something New (1921), written, directed, produced by and star- ring Nell Shipman; and Zander the Great (1925), starring Marion Davies with script and 'editorial direc- tion' by Frances Marion.

C(ilni .P1...11.... - powerful women filmmakers to the consolidation of the studio system, these changing representations of women in the driver's seat resonate with the film- makers' own experiences of empowerment and con- straint within the industry.6 While these films may not have been consciously intended as allegories of their conditions of production, they nevertheless articulate a 'political unconscious' in which we can read a larger narrative of the history of first-wave feminism, from the politically-charged 'New Womanhood' of the 191 Os to a more circumscribed 'modern' feminin- ity that conflated liberation with consumer desire and heterosexual romance.7 While this historical narrative may seem to take a rather depressing turn, my analy- sis aims to seize the empowering and subversive potentialities embodied in these texts, recuperating the work of early women filmmakers as a valuable resource for a contemporary feminist analysis of the dialectics of power and desire. My argument thus participates in the larger struggle of recent feminist film scholarship to reclaim female subjectivity, desire and pleasure from an overly monolithic view of the patriarchal constraints of classical narrative cinema.8 While such arguments have generally assumed that women viewers must 'negotiate' their pleasures in the interstices of the patriarchal text, I focus on the negotiations taking place at the level of both produc- tion and discourse, suggesting that these early women's films articulate alternative discourses of female pleasure and agency that defy patriarchal norms.9 Certainly early women filmmakers were not immune to the pressures and constraints of a patri- archal society, but they were supported by both a widespread popular feminist discourse and the growing importance of the female audience. I con- tend that these factors, together with the relative fluidity of generic and representational conventions in early cinema, created a far more open field for the articulation of female subjectivities, desires and pleasures. In defining these representations as 'auto- erotic', I connect the eroticisation of female automo- bility with psychoanalytic and feminist theories of sexuality and subject formation. Early women drivers described their experience in highly erotic terms, citing the 'thrills' and 'excitement' of speed and power as well as the queer intimacy of body and machine: 'There is wonderful difference between sit- ting calmly by while another is driving and actually handling a car herself. There is a feeling of power, of exhilaration, and fascination that nothing else gives in equal measure. ::When t::he ponderous car begins in equal measure. When the ponderous car begins to move and the motor seems a living, breathing thing responding to your slightest touch, then comes the realisation of "motoring" in its truest sense.'0 Such comments echo Audre Lorde's construction of 'the erotic' not as narrowly sexual but rather as a whole constellation of emotional and creative ener- gies suffusing a woman's being.11 They also reso- nate with Freud's description of pre-Oedipal 'auto-erotism' as a diffuse field of libidinal energy that is neither 'unified' in a particular region of the body nor directed toward a particular object but which instead 'obtains satisfaction from the subject's own body'.12 Indeed, just as Freud cited among the chief sources of auto-erotic stimulation the 'mechanical agitation' provided by trains or bicycles, the 'muscu- lar activity' or 'romping' of little girls, and the feverish activity of 'intellectual work', these films link the ath- Fig. 1.

Rather than support- ing Laura Mulvey's call for a radical aesthetic that destroys both cinematic pleasure and unified subjec- tivity, however, Irigaray's model underwrites the more recent interest in the complexities of women's cine- matic pleasures and subject positions, anticipating Christine Gledhill's call for decentered subjectivities as the vehicles of new kinds of agency: 'We need representations that take account of identities - rep- resentations that work with a degree of fluidity and contradiction - and we need to forge different iden- tities - ones that help us to make productive use of the contradictions of our lives'.16 I suggest that auto- mobility, as constructed in these films, functions for women filmmakers, protagonists and even specta- tors as a source of autoerotic satisfaction, an expe- rience of pleasure and power that can energise both a stable but unbounded sense of self and a desire to extend that power and pleasure into artistic creativity. The connection between women's driving and their growing power in Hollywood is epitomised by Mabel at the Wheel (1914), one of the first films made following the announcement that 'Mabel Normand, leading woman of the Keystone Co. since its incep- tion, is in the future to direct every picture she acts in'.17 In this two-reel comedy, Mabel takes the wheel of her boyfriend's race car, thwarting the machina- tions of a villainous Charles Chaplin and speeding to victory on her own. While the film seems at first a simple fusion of Normand's established comic per- sona with her well-known love of fast cars, it can also be read as an allegory of Normand's own directorial career. The fictional Mabel initially quarrels with her beau over the use of his race car, much as Normand had struggled with producer and lover Mack Sennett to 'take the wheel' of her own star vehicles. Her conflicts with the villain mirror the obstacles posed by Chaplin - then an inexperienced film actor with his own directorial aspirations and the only member of Keystone to resist Normand's authority.18 In the film, their conflict stems from the villain's incompetence behind the wheel - to make her boyfriend jealous, Mabel goes for a ride on Charlie's motorcycle but is outraged when he accidentally sends her flying into a mud puddle.19 She reunites with her beau, who allows her to take the wheel and joins her in confront- ing Charlie. When the villain kidnaps the hero to prevent him from racing, Mabel takes his place, overcomes the obstacles the villain places in her way, and is rewarded by a throng of cheering spec- tators. While off-screen events differed in many re- spects - rather than siding with Normand, Sennett conceded to Chaplin's resistance by allowing him to co-direct - the film nevertheless provides a compel- ling image of the emergence of women directors in the 1910s: a woman's demonstrated talent is ap- plauded by male colleagues and the general public and resented only by the most ridiculous and impo- tent of competitors. Normand, like many of her fe- male contemporaries in the industry, was welcomed by most of her cast and crew and heralded by the press, who declared that Normand's new role as director would not only allow the star to expand her comedic talents but would 'undoubtedly make Key- stone more popular than ever'.20 Mabel at the Wheel constructs the woman driver as an image of not merely professional com- petence but also uninhibited desire and active resis- tance to patriarchal constraints. Mabel's conflict with Charlie stems from her resistance to ungentlemanly behavior that includes sexual harassment and physi- cal assault - he repeatedly pinches and pokes her thigh and, when she slaps him for his effrontery, punches her back. When she goes in search of her kidnapped boyfriend, he grabs the collar of her dress and exposes her upper chest. She, in turn, grabs his hand and bites down until he retreats in agony. The film thus alludes to popular discourse about the sexual harassment routinely faced by women who 'travel alone' in the urban environment, a phenome- 176</page><page sequence="4">Women in the driver's seat: The auto-erotics of early women's films non that included both 'unwanted advances' and violent responses to female resistance.21 In contrast to the sadomasochistic fascination with which the popular press and 'white-slave films' of that era rep- resented such threats, however, Mabel at the Wheel defuses the threat by comically emphasising Mabel's feisty resistance. The real thrill of the film lies in the fast-paced action of the race and the audience's identification with Mabel's excitement and satisfaction. Camera- work and editing function not to objectify the attrac- tive Mabel but to encourage identification with her, an identification facilitated by Normand's technical innovations - rather than using an advance car for driver close-ups, Normand mounted a camera on the front of her race car, a practice later adopted indus- try-wide.22 Scenes of the speeding cars and the obstacles placed by the villains are intercut with close-ups of Mabel, whose face alternates between intense concentration and delighted laughter as she grips the wheel. (Her male mechanic-passenger, in contrast, registers a comic anxiety and dismay.) The only shot-reverse-shot sequences in the film do show Mabel as the object of the male gaze, but the gaze highlighted is that of her father, who registers first astonishment but ultimately pride in her unladylike competence. The reverse shots of Mabel highlight not her feminine physique but her restless physicality as she drives, refuels and recovers from accidents. When Mabel takes the wheel, she strips off both her feminine frippery and her girlish frivolity, donning a bulky, shapeless white coat and scarf that renders only her face clearly visible, and shifting from exag- gerated gestures and comic face-making to a more natural air of poised self-assurance. Significantly, Mabel does without the unattractive driving goggles, which rest atop her head, the better for us to see her expressions in closeup. However, the film avoids calling attention to this omission and her male pas- senger is also sans eyewear, suggesting that its motivation is less to highlight Mabel's beauty than to keep her face free as it registers the erotic pleasure with which the audience is invited to identify. At the film's conclusion, Mabel's autoerotic pleasure is not repressed but ecstatically celebrated by a mostly male crowd, which pours from the stands to congratulate her. The men neither resent her achievement nor subject her to unwanted advances, enveloping her instead in comradely admiration. The villain and his henchman are defeated by their own smoke bomb. Rather than ending with a heterosex- ual clinch, the final shot shows Mabel's boyfriend, now freed from captivity, and father, now reconciled to his daughter's activity, lifting her to their shoulders in celebration. The film explicitly insists that Mabel's triumph should not be viewed as a solicitation of masculine desire: when a man in the crowd attempts to take advantage of the carnivalesque celebration to grab a nearby woman, she and her female friend respond swiftly and decisively, battering him with hands and feet until he releases them. Then they continue on their way to join Mabel at the finish line. Mabel's auto-erotic activity - and by extension, the creative power of the woman filmmaker - can thus be seen as the vehicle of not a revolution against but rather a utopian transformation of the patriarchal order, in which female agency and desire are not bounded by the demands and restrictions of men but rather serve as a galvanising force for a new het- erosocial community. Significantly, the cinema plays an important role in constituting this community, as suggested by the presence of a cameraman in the concluding scene, excitedly cranking the machine that records Mabel's triumph. As women directors and stars continued to rise in power in Hollywood in the late 191 Os, many chafed under the confines of the studio system and turned to independent production as a new vehicle of artistic freedom. While most such ventures were ultimately crushed by the studios' stranglehold on distribution, the brief heyday of independent women filmmakers produced films of remarkable power and innova- tion.23 One of the most intriguing of these is Nell Shipman's Something New (1921), which stars the filmmaker as a young 'writing woman' who goes to Mexico in search of 'ATMOSPHERE - real, red, and RAW'. When the remote mine she is visiting is at- tacked by banditos, she is captured, threatened with rape, and rescued by a handsome mining engineer who pursues the villains across the desert in his Maxwell automobile. It is Shipman, however, who emerges as the true hero: after the engineer is in- jured, she must take the wheel and pilot them across the desert to the safety of the American border. While the film echoes many conventions of the serial-queen melodrama - alternately reveling in the sadistic spectacle of the heroine's victimisation and celebrating her triumphant agency - it goes well beyond those conventions in its complex and highly erotic articulation of female agency and automobility with intellectual creativity.24 The fictional 'writing woman' is conflated with the well known writer-direc- 177</page><page sequence="5">Jennifer Parchesky tor-producer-star in a peculiar framing narrative that shows Shipman seated at a typewriter in the midst of a campsite, wracking her brain for 'something new' to write about. Inspiration strikes when she witnesses a man on a horse ('the OLD') defeated in an off-road race by one in an automobile ('the NEW'). While the scene's setting alludes to Shipman's established persona as 'the Girl from God's Country', an intertitle constructs the authorial imagination as machine, de- scribing her writers' block as 'one of those muddy mental hills with the old brain hitting on one cylinder'. With its emphasis on the identification of woman and automobile and on the conquest of 'old' by 'new', the scene marks an important shift in Shipman's oeuvre from the association of woman with nature to the identification of the New Woman with technological modernity. The film was financed by the Maxwell-Briscoe Motor Company and, as such, has been dismissed by some critics as merely an extended and some- what melodramatic commercial for the off-road ca- pacities of the Maxwell automobile.25 But Shipman's collaboration with the automaker represents less a capitulation of art to commerce than a strategic alli- ance enabling her independence from the equally commercial and increasingly patriarchal studio sys- tem. Demanding only a favorable presentation of its product, Maxwell likely seemed a far less oppressive master than a 1920s studio boss. Moreover, the company had long been associated with the empow- erment of female motorists, sponsoring Alice Ram- say's pioneering transcontinental journey in 1909, a 1914 feminist campaign to promote automobile saleswomen, and numerous women's tours and races.26 While the film embodies the ongoing tension between women's desire to prove their 'masculine' prowess behind the wheel and automakers' desire to market their products as so reliable and easy that even a woman could use them, Shipman navigates this rocky ideological terrain by constructing the reli- able automobile as a valuable friend to, but no sub- stitute for, the courageous and capable female driver.27 Perhaps the most intriguing feature of the film is the way in which the automobile emerges as a quasi-subjective companion and lover whose rela- tionship with the woman soon displaces the male hero to the visual and narrative margins.28 Scenes of the hero's race to the rescue emphasise the subjec- tivity not of man but of car in head-on long shots that invest the Maxwell's 'face' with a personality. Its headlight eyes, mouthlike grill, and arduous move- ment toward the camera suggest that the car itself is rushing to the rescue, while the man fades into gray obscurity behind the wheel. In contrast, scenes of Shipman driving emphasise her agency with fre- quent close-ups of her expressive face and physical exertion; even in long shots her white shirt, blowing hair and active movements make her visible as an active presence behind the anthropomorphic face of the auto. The displacement of man by automobile is most decisively signaled in the film's crisis, when they reach a steep cliff where even the trusty Maxwell can go no further. With suicide the only alternative to a fate worse than death at the hands of the rapacious Mexicans, the engineer offers Nell his gun - only to discover he is out of bullets. Failed by the hero and his phallic weapon, Nell turns to her true love, the Maxwell, passionately embracing its 'face' as she pours out her sorrows and thanks it for its loyal service. Although a miraculous ray of sunlight points a new path up the hill, they are soon trapped again. A precariously perched boulder suggests itself as a weapon against the villains below, but the hero strug- gles impotently against its solid mass. In a flash of inspiration that had apparently not occurred to the engineer, who watches anxiously from the sidelines, Nell leaps into the Maxwell; together, woman and car ram the boulder until it falls to crush the villains below. Much as Kay Armatage has suggested of the faithful dog in Shipman's Back to God's Country (1919), the automobile can be seen as both a partner in an intersubjective relationship and an extension of the heroine herself: 'the representation of the excessive desire of femininity, a transgressive desire which exceeds the capacity for satisfaction through rela- tions with the woman's human lover/husband'.29 What makes Something New so remarkable is not only its attribution of such subjectivity to a machine but also its insistent identification of the automobile as feminine, repeatedly ignoring the masculine brand name to define the Maxwell as 'she' and 'the real heroine of this story'. Constructing the Maxwell as both prosthetic extension of the heroine and feminised lover, the film figures their relationship as a multivalent field of homo- and auto-erotic desire surpassing the love of men. While Back to God's Country had resolved its subversive interspecies romance in a cozy domestic scene - the hero and heroine snuggle by the fire while the dog watches over a new baby - the conclusion of Something New represents a far more ambivalent 178</page><page sequence="6">Woe in the C _dir satffil .Th .a.uo. -ero,tiCcs ofealywmen .films -.17 structure of containment.30 'Was the real heroine of this left, like a bloomin' bird, on a mountain top?' a title asks. A long shot of the Maxwell driving into the foreground reassures us, 'No Sir-eel She got 'em in and she got 'em out!' Far from displacing the hetero- sexual couple, the automobile is figured as the natu- ral vehicle of a reconstituted nuclear family: the hero now drives while the heroine holds his dog. Yet a dog is not quite a baby, and its conspicuously sudden reappearance - having been absent since calling the hero to the heroine's aid back in the first reel - suggests the tenuousness of the film's desperate effort to defuse the queer intimacy of woman and machine. Equally conspicuous is the phallic signifier under whose auspices the new 'family' is reconsti- tuted: as they drive into the foreground, Nell rises to look in the distance and an iris shot reveals the American flag waving in the distance. The hero puts his arm paternally around woman and dog, and they all gaze rapturously at Old Glory. While we might dismiss this as merely a con- ventional gesture toward a patriotic postwar audi- ence, the scene brings into sharp focus the nationalist and imperialist discourses implicit throughout a film set on the contested frontier of the U.S./Mexico border during an epoch of bloody revo- lution. Mexico is described first as a 'land of rogues and romance, mystery and murder' and later as 'the Country God Forgot', in sharp contrast to the majes- tic U.S. and Canadian forests of Shipman's 'God's Country' films. Both the rugged terrain and the swarthy, horseback-riding villains are figured as hos- tile, lawless forces that must be conquered by Ameri- can technology - whether mining operation or automobile. The writing woman discovers that her racialised national virtue cannot protect her from this lawless otherness: 'You forget that I am an Ameri- can!' she ineffectually defies her leering captor just before the hero and automobile arrive to save her. Yet while merely being American is no protection, the heroine triumphs by learning to act American - using technology to master savage nature and conquer threatening Others. While such jingoism may seem odd on the part of the Canadian-born Shipman, it must be understood as part of a complex negotiation with American sponsors, industry, and target audi- ence in a postwar America striving to incorporate both new technology and female emancipation in the service of a patriarchal, imperialist, capitalist hegemony. At the same time, the film evokes a far more * ow ... . .'. ' . ...: ;... . ambivalent historical resonance in its recurrent im- ages of the capable woman driver and her ban- daged, bleeding and often unconscious male passenger: the highly visible role of female ambu- lance drivers in World War I. While such women were praised for giving up frivolous pursuits in service of the nation, they also evoked a host of postwar cul- tural anxieties about women's entry into 'masculine' roles vacated by absent, incapacitated, and even literally castrated men. With a generation of young men physically and psychologically damaged just as the nation sought to consolidate its global power, such heroines were both needed and reviled and, frequently, demonised as lesbians.31 In this light, there is considerable tension between the film's cele- bration of the New Woman's passionate attachment to the feminised vehicle of her independence and its insistence upon channeling that power in the service of a patriarchal, capitalist imperialism. While she uses technology in the service of man and nation, the heroine's erotic attachment to the pleasures of that technology exceed the hegemonic uses to which it is put. Most importantly, the film does not end with the reunited American family but returns to the soli- tary pleasures whence it began, recasting the iden- tification of New Woman and new technology in the figure of the woman author/filmmaker. Man, dog and flag disappear as the film announces its ambiguous 'MORAL': 'Be it MOTOR - ' - or MAID -' 'THERE IS ALWAYS SOMETHING NEW!' A 'closeup' of the Max- well's 'face', framed to cut off its human passengers, zooms into the foreground. The 'motor' is graphically matched by the image of the 'maid' Shipman, pound- ing excitedly at her typewriter until both machine and operator begin to tumble over the edge of the desk toward the camera.

The final title is punctuated with an equally exclamatory final close-up: Shipman laughs radiantly into the camera as she nearly falls over the desk herself, completely uninhibited in the overflow- ing pleasure of her creative activity. The solitary pleasure of the scene is under- scored by the conspicuous absence of Shipman's lover, Bert Van Tuyle, a former race-car driver who plays the hero and was credited as co-writer and co-director of the film. Appearing in the opening frame only as driver of the car that inspires the story, Van Tuyle's disappearance in the closing frame ech- oes biographical evidence that his credits reflect less a true creative partnership than a concession to male vanity. Indeed, the historical Van Tuyle, whose alco- holism and poor business sense would ultimately contribute to the downfall of Nell Shipman Produc- tions, resembles less the capable engineer who rides to the rescue than the incapacitated burden he be- comes after his head injury, a passenger in a vehicle clearly driven by Shipman.32 While the fictional con- clusion restores the hero to the driver's seat, the framing narrative depicts a far more subversive fan- tasy: male partner, sponsors and imperialist ideolo- gies melt away as woman, automobile, typewriter and camera blur together in an ecstatic jouissance of autoerotic creativity. By the mid-1920s, the heyday of powerful women directors and producers had passed. Those who established independent studios in the late 1910s, including Shipman and Lois Weber, suc- cumbed to the box-office slump of the early 1920s, while the increasingly rigid division of Hollywood labour made it more difficult for others to move from acting or screenwriting into postions of greater authority. Perhaps, as some have speculated, women were simply pushed out of what were by then recognised as highly powerful positions in a lucrative industry.33 Nevertheless, a few women- mainly screenwriters and actors - continued to exert signifi- cant creative control well into and beyond the 1920s, albeit by negotiating their visions with the demands of powerful male studio heads and the ever more codified conventions of Hollywood filmmaking. My final reading examines the effects of these changes on the discourses of female authorship and auto- eroticism in Frances Marion's Zander the Great (1925). Some may question my claim of 'authorship' for Marion, an established screenwriter who, after successfully directing three films in 1920-21, had renounced the overt authority of the director's chair - and the resistance such authority provoked - in favor of a less visible behind-the-scenes power.34 On Zander, she is somewhat ambiguously credited as 'editorial director' of a film produced by William Ran- dolph Hearst, directed by George Hill (an inexperi- enced former cameraman whom Marion promoted and would later marry), scripted by Lillie Hayward, and starring Marion Davies. Yet it is clear that Marion was the driving force behind the film: conceiving the story, co-authoring the script, selecting cast and director, 'suggesting shots and angles', and negoti- ating ongoing conflicts between the insecure Hill and the tyrannical Hearst.35 The film marks the culmina- tion of Marion's long struggle with Hearst over the direction of Davies' career, which began when he hired her as a writer in 1916 and continued after her promotion to head of Cosmopolitan's West Coast production in 1923. While Hearst longed to 'smother' his young mistress in opulent costume dramas - constructing her as aesthetic object - Marion fought for vehicles that would allow Davies' comedic talents to shine. Zander epitomises the success of that struggle and was praised as a 'personal triumph' for Davies.36 Although the film makes only brief use of motor vehicles, the scenes in which they appear - and their subsequent disappearance - reveal a complex ne- gotiation between the diffuse energies of autoeroti- cism and the centripetal pressures of patriarchal femininity. Davies plays an impish orphan who blooms into womanhood, simultaneously imitating and subverting Mary Pickford's idealised 'child im- personations'. With her plain, freckled face, pigtails, scrawny form and aggressive movements - all ex- posed in harsh, unflattering shots - young Mamie defies the aesthetic objectification of the 'pedophilic gaze' that Gaylyn Studlar has associated with 'Little Mary', even as her activities demonstrate a preco- cious sexual drive.37 In the opening scene, Mamie is distracted from her labour in the orphanage laundry by a delivery man who gives her a lollipop and shows her his marvelous motorcycle. When he walks away, Mamie (with some nudging from her companions) climbs atop the motorcycle and begins to bounce vigorously upon the seat, sucking her lollipop in- tently. The scene not-so-subtly evokes the wide- 180</page><page sequence="8">Women in the driver's seat: The auto-erotics of early women's films spread turn-of-the-century anxieties about women's bicycling, which decried not only the subversive free- dom of movement the new vehicle offered but also the dangerous masturbatory possibilities of the bicy- cle seat - pleasures and dangers both enhanced here by motorization.38 Yet there is no effort to con- struct Mamie's autoerotic pleasure as coy invitation to an objectifying gaze: she is intensely focused on her own activity, her only observers the other girls who clamor for a turn as she absentmindedly slaps them away. Mamie's frenzied autoerotic activity is soon disrupted, however, by the repressive figure of the matron, whose appearance startles Mamie to shift into gear and take off on a wild ride across the yard. The film revels in the terrifying yet pleasurable thrill of the forbidden ride: pigtails flying, circling wildly, she crashes through fences and laundry lines, knocks down the matron, and generally wreaks havoc until she bumps into a basket of laundry and falls in a heap. The motorcycle disappears as Mamie's auto- erotic pleasure is, in classic Freudian fashion, first repressed - the matron binds her hands and locks her in a closet - then sublimated into a more 'mature' domestic femininity, when she is adopted by the gentle Mrs. Caldwell and given a baby - little Alexan- der Caldwell - to care for. But Mamie's transforma- tion from 'cabbage' into 'rose' is disrupted by Mrs. Caldwell's death, and she must again take the wheel. When the orphanage threatens to take Zander, Mamie sets out in an old Ford to deliver her young charge to his father, who is seeking his fortune in the West. Although the arduous automobile journey is represented somewhat elliptically - the distance from New Jersey to Arizona comically signaled by Zander's rapidly multiplying pet rabbits - the film highlights the challenges of early cross-country mo- toring. (The rabbits also provide a visual reminder of Mamie's precocious sexual awareness: when later asked if she traveled alone, she ingenuously ex- claims, 'Alone! Say, mister, have you ever traveled with a couple of rabbits?') While we do not see Mamie's face during the sequence, her subjective point-of-view is evoked by the ironic juxtaposition of a sign - 'Welcome Visitors! You are now enjoying our splendid highways'- with jerking shots of the rocky, rutted dirt track through the windshield and long shots of the tiny car bumping across the desert. Like Mabel at the Wheel and Something New, Zander sensationalises the dangers facing the woman who 'travels alone': with no service stations for miles, Mamie stops to beg for food and rest at a rancho inhabited by a gang of bootleggers. As she enters the dark, gothic building, the Ford is visible behind her, steam pouring from its engine to indicate the impossibility of escape. While her mud-spattered face, goggles and cloak testify to the rigors of her journey and emphasise the smallness of her form as she is greeted at gunpoint, they also serve as armor against her feminine softness, recalling the spunky orphan within. The Ford soon disappears as Mamie is rein- scribed in the realm of domestic femininity: the gang's leader, Dan, finds woman and child a con- venient blind against the law and persuades Mamie that he is Zander's father; she moves in as cook and housekeeper and the two gradually fall in love. Yet the independent spirit articulated in those early scenes of auto-eroticism remains in constant tension with her new role as angel in the house. She domes- ticates the gang almost forcibly and, when she dis- covers their illegal activities, threatens to report them to the law. Finally, when she and Zander are taken hostage by Mexican banditos, she escapes, steals a horse, and rides, still bound and gagged, to seek help. Ultimately, Dan promises to give up his wicked ways and begs Mamie to stay, for he 'need[s]' her to 'help [him] build a home'. Much as in Something New, white American woman and man unite to con- quer racialised villains and domesticate the wilder- ness. Mamie, Dan and Zander ride off into the sunset - albeit on horses rather than in an automobile - followed by the proliferating herd of rabbits which fills the foreground as the new family recedes into the distance. Much as turn-of-the-century magazine fic- tion had 'reframed women's bicycling as a trip that would end in married happiness', Zander the Great rechannels Mamie's precocious autoeroticism into reproductive heterosexuality.39 We should not be too hasty, however, to dis- miss the film's closure as subordinating the heroine's desire and agency to the imperatives of the patriar- chal order. Mamie remains the subject of her own desires even as they are redirected heterosexually: when Zander interrupts the couple's kiss with de- mands of his own, she dismisses him - 'Not now, honey, Mamie's awful busy' - and returns to her new love object much as she brushed away the clamoring girls who interfered with her solitary pleasure on the motorcycle. Moreover, their relationship is founded less upon Dan's rescue of Mamie than his acknow- ledgement of his own need. In contrast to the classi- 181</page><page sequence="9">Jennifer Parchesky cal Hollywood construction of woman as a chaotic force to be investigated, punished, or saved, woman here emerges as a powerful force of civilising order desperately needed (and ultimately, desired) by the lawless masculine West - much as she had in Some- thing New.40 While this construction of woman as driving force of civilisation seems less sexy than the anarchic jouissance of unfettered autoeroticism, it was a cen- tral theme of first-wave feminism, which justified women's empowerment not merely as an exercise of personal freedom but as a force for reinventing a society corrupted by masculine violence and greed. Indeed, the notion of women as the vanguard of moral and social reform was central to the self-con- cept and public perception of many early women filmmakers, who were viewed as bulwarks against the corruption and anarchy of both industry and society. The Universal City women candidates ran on a platform to 'clean up' the company town, and directors like Lois Weber and Dorothy Davenport Reid made their careers with sweeping polemics for such causes as birth control and economic reform and against drug abuse, capital punishment, 'white slavery', and political corruption.41 Such efforts, in an era of war, greed and seething social inequities, represented less a Victorian conservatism than a quite radical progressivism, though they were often, like much of the progressive movement, complicit with racist and imperialist agendas. In this light, both the narrative of Zander the Great and Marion's strat- egy of working for power within the system rather than striking for independence can be seen as con- sistent with the general direction of first-wave femi- nism, which responded to the victory of suffrage by assuming (albeit erroneously) that women had be- come equal partners and could now turn from the pursuit of their own freedoms to become full partici- pants in the progress of the nation. While few early women filmmakers fared well as a patriarchal capitalism gained a firmer control of the diverse energies of cinematic creativity - and those who did, only by subordinating their autono- mous dreams to the imperatives of Hollywood con- vention - their works survive as material traces of the powerful desires and utopian visions of our feminist foremothers. As such, they represent a valuable re- source for a feminist film theory and practice long impoverished by the fear that our cinematic pleas- ures are always already compromised by patriarchy. We need not sift through the cracks and fissures of patriarchal discourse to reconstruct feminist pleas- ure - it is right there before us (especially in the first two films) in the radiant image of the woman in the driver's seat, unselfconsciously reveling in the mani- fold pleasures of speed and power, not a fetishised object of the male gaze but a subject of her own desires, an 'ideal-I' calling forth both the desire and the identification of the female spectator. Female automobility thus serves as a paradigm of a pleasure defined by neither commodity fetishism (though commodities facilitate pleasure, they are not in them- selves objects of desire), nor a heterosexual dichot- omy of active male subject and passive female object (though it can encompass heterosexual de- sire), nor even a narcissism that turns self into object. Instead, these auto-erotic fantasies offer paradigms of female pleasures and powers that elude the sub- ject-object oppositions of the phallocentric imagina- tion. Moreover, the autoerotic pleasure of becoming one with the speed and power of the machine pro- vides a potent metaphor for female creativity - like Shipman in the framing narrative, the artist becomes one with the creative drives that emerge from both within and beyond herself. While the eroticised linkage of woman and machine has been a recurrent trope in feminist film- making from Christopher Strong (1933) to Thelma and Louise (1991), such films seem unable to imag- ine any but tragic outcomes for their heroines' de- sires. In contrast, early women's films offer a vision of female automobility not merely as self-destructive flight from patriarchal oppression but as a galvanis- ing experience of freedom and satisfaction that em- powers women to take up more powerful roles within their societies. As Audre Lorde has suggested, The erotic is an internal sense of satisfaction to which, once we have experienced it, we know we can aspire ... Once we know the extent to which we are capable of feeling that sense of satisfaction and completion, we can then observe which of our various life endeav- ors bring us closest to that fullness.42 The films I examine suggest that narrative clo- sure need neither purge subversive female energies nor bind them safely back into an unchanged patri- archal order; rather, the energies unleashed by woman and machine provide the engine of a new, utopian future. The victorious Mabel, cheered by men and women alike, the impassioned 'writing woman' pounding away at her typewriter, even the domesti- 182</page><page sequence="10">Women in the driver's seat: The auto-erotics of early women's films 183 cated Mamie, riding off into the sunset with the men that she loves - all signify the promise of a future still unwritten but one in which women will surely be a driving force.

For example, the Moving Picture Girls dime novel series by Laura Lee Hope (1914-1915) represented the adventures of early filmmaking in terms much like those of the contemporaneous 'Automobile Girls' and 'Motor Girls' series.

The intimate companionship of woman and automo- bile is anticipated in the accounts of pioneering women motorists like actress Anita King, who told reporters that 'what [she] enjoyed most' about her transcontinental solo voyage was 'the daily compan- ionship with my motor. You cannot realise how close we seemed. There were many, many times in my long and tiresome trip, when had my motor failed me I would surely have perished, as I was miles beyond help, and as I realised how perfectly to be depended upon my KisselKar was, I grew more and more pals with my car.'

On women ambulance drivers, see Scharff 107, who notes that screenwriter Anita Loos made humorous use of this association in her 1925 novel Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. My reading of the castration anxiety in this discourse is indebted to Kaja Silverman's analysis of 'historical trauma' in World War II films in Male Subjectivity at the Margins (New York: Rout- ledge, 1992). Ben Singer traces the trope of female heroism as response to male incapacity from the serial queen back to Augustin Daly's 1867 stage play Under the Gaslight. It is worth noting that this early image articulates togethertechnology, feminism and the trauma of war: the man the heroine rescues from the train tracks is a disabled Civil War veteran who marvels, 'And these are the women who ain't to have the vote!' (qtd. in Singer 109-1 10). 32. Armatage, 23. Director Lois Weber made a similar concession to male vanity in granting undeserved co-credit to her husband, Phillips Smalley. See Slide 32. 33.

Abstract: Women in the driver's seat: The auto-erotics of early women's films, by Jennifer Parchesky The trope of women's 'automobility' in three films centered around female drivers is examined in order to chart the changing fortunes of women's creative control in early Hollywood, looking in turn at Mabel Normand, Nell Shipman and Frances Marion. Whether behind the wheel or behind the camera, women's mastery of exciting new technologies offered a spectacular image of New Womanhood as both practical power and thrilling adventure. 184</page></plain_text>
