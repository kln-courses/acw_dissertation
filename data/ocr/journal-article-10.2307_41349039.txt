This movement from introspective vision to out- ward engagement is essentiell to her vision for Aurora Leigh: "An autobiography of a poetess - (not me) . .

She transforms the blind Beggar into a metaleptic figure, in Harold Bloom's sense of the word, revising him in her "beggar boy," as well as in Marian and Romney;3 her protagonist Aurora develops through engaging intersubjectively with these revisions of the blind Beggar, in an "inner to outeť manifestation of the profound spiritual inspiration Wordsworth provided Barrett Browning. This article's exploration of Barrett Browning's finally ironic response leads one to wonder: why does Wordsworth fail to engage with the blind Beggar? I attempt to answer, drawing on both poets' works and on an eclectic critical framework. The blind Beggar's inspirational effect is better understood after reading Barrett Browning's thoughts and feelings, expressed in her correspondence, about Wordsworth and his work.4 In a letter to Mary Mitford, she calls Wordsworth the "KING" of poetry (21 October 1842, 6: 1 14-6, 1 14); in another letter, she professes to him that he is a Prophet to whom she is a disciple (Barrett Browning to Wordsworth, 2 April 1843, 7:44-5, 44). She associ- ates Wordsworth with poetry itself: "He was a great poet to me always - and always, while I have a soul for poetry, will be so" (Barrett Browning to Hugh Stuart Boyd, 14 May 1843, 7:123). The physical and unconscious dimensions of her feelings signify their depth: upon first meeting him, she reports, "I trembled both in my soul &amp; my body!" (Barrett Browning to Julia Martin, 23 January 1837, 3:216-21, 217); later, she dreams, "we met a child of Wordsworth's, &amp; it held out its arms to kiss me! And then came a most tremendous rain in which Papa vanished away - " (Barrett Browning to Samuel Moulton-Barrett, 19 April 1839, 4:136-7, 137); finally, receiving "A letter from Wordsworth!" she confesses, "Don't tell anybody, but I kissed if (Barrett Browning to Mitford, 27 October 1842, 6:122-5, 124). Nevertheless, as early as 1842, Barrett Browning also ex- presses a concern with Wordsworth's deficiencies, both poetic and personal. She implies in a review of Wordsworth's tragedy The Borderers (1842) that he does not evince the union of terror and pity necessary for active Aristotelian emotive catharsis. In essence, she describes a lack of intersubjectivity: "The master indeed, was a prophet of humanity; but he was wiser in love than terror, in admiration than pity, and rather intensely than actively</page><page sequence="3">Emily V. Epstein Kobayashi 825 human; capacious to embrace within himself the whole nature of things and beings, but not going out of himself to embrace anything; a poet of one large sufficient soul, but not polypsychi- cal like a dramatist/'5 Barrett Browning was painfully aware of Wordsworth's insen- sitivity to the urban populace. In 1844, Wordsworth published in The Morning Post his "Sonnet on the Projected Kendal and Winandermere Railway" opposing the building of a train line into the Lake region. Defending his views weeks later in a letter to The Morning Post , Wordsworth argued, 'The imperfectly edu- cated classes are not likely to draw much good from rare visits to the Lakes."6 In her own correspondence, Barrett Browning responded, "Certainly, if Mr. Wordsworth wrote such a letter as was described to you [Mitford], &amp; the writing of which I cannot help doubting, it is not only unworthy of him but an abnegation of his whole poetical life. To oppose the establishing of the railroad was wrong, but to use the argument in question, was atrocious. I cannot believe that he ever used it. If he did it certainly was as Laureat, &amp; not as poet" (Barrett Browning to Mitford, 16 December 1844, 9:278-83, 281). Wordsworth demonstrated to Barrett Browning that his revolutionary embrace of the common man had limits. Harriet Martineau writes to Barrett Browning of Wordsworth's blindness to rural humanity's vice and his conviction of the ills inherent to urban humanity: "I dare say you need not be told how sensual vice abounds in rural districts. Here it is flagrant beyd. any thing I ever cd. have looked for: &amp; here, while every justice of the peace is filled with disgust, &amp; every clergym. with (almost) despair at the drunkenness, quarrelling &amp; extreme licentiousness with women, - here is dear good old Wordsworth for ever talking of rural innocence, &amp; deprecating any intercourse with towns, lest the purity of his neighbours shd. be corrupted!" (Martineau to Barrett Browning, 8 February 1846, 12:51-5, 54). In December 1843, Barrett Browning writes of her decision to remain faithful to Wordsworth despite his faults: "Still, the wings of his genius are wide enough to cast shadows over it's [sic] feet - and our gratitude shd. be stronger than our critical acumen. Yes - I will be a blind admirer of Wordsworth's - I will shut my eyes &amp; be blind. Better so, than see too well for the thankfulness which is his due from me" (Barrett Browning to Thomas Westwood, 31 December 1843, 8:123-5, 124). Barrett Browning wishes to acknowledge Wordsworth's importance to her; in August 1844, she writes of her plan to send a copy of her Poems to him: "I am</page><page sequence="4">826 Feeling Intellect in Aurora Leigh and The Prelude going to send one to Wordsworth, as tribute" (Barrett Browning to Mitford, 6 August 1844, 9:78-80, 79). Barrett Browning must have received The Prelude with a sense of excitement. As early as 1839, she knew of the poem's existence. She anticipates its publication: "It is whispered that the poor Laureate told Moxon a few years ago, of his intention to leave a posthumous poem" (Barrett Browning to George Goodin Barrett, 4 April 1843, 7:54-6, 55); A New Spirit of the Age has high expectations: "The Excursion,' which is only a portion of a larger work (to be published hereafter) called The Recluse,' has passages of very glorious exaltation" (1:313). If she looked to The Prelude for the sustained intersubjective concern and active dialogue with the downtrodden she had found in The Excursion (1814), she must have been disappointed. Yet by engaging with The Prelude , Wordsworth's narrative that "hath chiefly told / Of intellectual power," Barrett Browning could expand the realm of Wordsworth's "feeling intellect" toward an intersubjective idealism that would reach into the city and fulfill the promise of Wordsworth's revolutionary identification with the common man.7 The arresting, enigmatic image of Wordsworth's blind Beggar in London invites the poet's and the critic's engagement. Imme- diately relevant are the critical readings of Jonathan Wordsworth and Geraldine Friedman who find Wordsworth and The Prelude reflected in the blind Beggar and the label he wears: This label seemed of the utmost we can know, / Both of ourselves and of the universe" (7. 645-6). 8 Wordsworth's mirroring of the text in this passage cuts off the reader of The Prelude and leaves her hanging, in a state similar to the Boy of Winander's, listening for the owl's answer. Geoffrey H. Hartman notes Wordsworth's frequent use of "hung," "indicating a suspension both physical and mental."9 But instead of spiritual acuity, here we witness the poet's demoralization, a Saussurean objectiveness - " language is a form and not a substance " - that is echoed elsewhere: "lifeless as a written book" (8.576). 10 Wordsworth's response is a marked contrast to Barrett Browning's view of his Poems (1842) as "the sign, seal, and representation of his life."11 The label displaces the man; Hartman finds the Beggar's face and eyes "are as much a surface as the paper he wears."12 This displacement opens the way for Barrett Browning. Wordsworth's provocative turn away from the blind Beggar calls for a closer look at both men. Because the love for which Wordsworth is so rightly celebrated is absent from his representa- tion of his encounters within the city, I am compelled to take up and conceptualize the love that guides his poetic vision. Intra-</page><page sequence="5">Emily V. Epstein Kobayashi 827 subjective love is a person's timeless fusion with art, whether in creating it or in reading it. It motivates Wordsworth's reading of the ultimate art form, Nature, the source of his imaginative pow- ers: "Attention springs, / And comprehensiveness and memory flow, / From early converse with the works of God" (7.740-2). 13 Nature is Wordsworth's precursor text, as The Prelude is Barrett Browning's. Instead of Bloom's scenario of poetic influence be- ing initially indistinguishable from love but soon shading "into revisionaiy strife," intrasubjective love is termed love because the reader's or creator's attention is drawn and held, and the poet attains a completeness as the poet's psyche joins other psyches in art.14 Instead of a striving against, there is a striving with. Although there are "sweet counsels between head and heart" (1 1.352), Wordsworth tells us that the body is forgotten. Hartman and Herbert Lindenberger analyze Wordsworth's depiction of the intrasubjective state. Hartman notes the poet's portrayal of "suspension both physical and mental," while Linden- berger describes Wordsworth's "rhetoric of interaction" between inner and outer worlds wherein "emptiness becomes an image of transition."15 Wordsworth requires vision by the intellectual eye, here described within his childhood, to enter this state: bodily eyes Were utterly forgotten, and what I saw Appeared like something in myself, a dream, A prospect in the mind. (2.349-52) Wordsworth emerges from a fusion with Nature (2.170-5, 5.379-88) with his own imitative and thus uniquely intrasubjec- tive thetic. His assertion of position as a subject in relation to an "object" - his position in relationship to Nature - is one that seeks to re-create, not to change. He hopes his work "may become / A power like one of Nature's" (13.31 1-2). 16 A New Spirit of the Age sees this realized: "He would not separate poetry and nature, even in their forms" (1:31 1). In structuralist fashion, intrasubjective love could be defined by what it is not; it is not intersubjective love, which causes one to pursue understanding of another embodied human being. While the poetic valuing of another in intersubjective vision is a seem- ingly simple concept, it is a potential answer to Jonathan Culler's question of what could possibly lie beyond the mirror so unavoid- able in the study of Romanticism. Might not "the fragmentation</page><page sequence="6">828 Feeling Intellect in Aurora Leigh and The Prelude of the body and the self beyond the mirror instead be a positive, subtler opening up of the self to new, to others' truths?17 Barrett Browning seems to intimate this with her metaleptic transposi- tions; as Kenneth Burke points out, "Characters possess degrees of being in proportion to the variety of perspectives from which they can with justice be perceived."18 Aurora Leigh tracks poet Aurora's growing realization of the necessity of intersubjective love for both her own sake and that of the other. Dolores Rosenblum notes Barrett Browning's inter - subjective vision in 'The Seraphim," wherein Barrett Browning rejects the Romantic visionary mode and embraces "humanized inter-subjective vision Tace to face.'"19 Yet paradoxically, in Aurora Leigh Barrett Browning seems to point out that Wordsworth is the Romantic visionary when he engages with "men obscure and lowly" (Prelude, 13: 183). While The Prelude closes with a passage that romantically places hope in the power of the imagination and transcendence of "this frame of things," overall the work seems to be one of quiet, revelatory introspection that invites further exploration for truth (14:452). Barrett Browning "boldly take[s her] way among mankind / Wherever Nature leads," one among many poets "each with each / Connected in a mighty scheme of truth," and intersubjectively mirrors this intrasubjective coopera- tion as she returns the poet to mortal embodiment, to the man Wordsworth (The Prelude, 13.296-7, 301-2, and 7.763-6). Wordsworth, of all poets, successfully walked the line between "sublime egotism" and intersubjectivity, a line he seems to rec- ognize in this question posed in the "Preface to Lyrical Ballads' ' (1802): "What is a Poet? To whom does he address himself? And what language is to be expected from him?" While it is likely that when Wordsworth answers "He is a man speaking to men" he in- tends that he is speaking to the reader or "speaking" intrasubjec- tively, as important to Barrett Browning is that within his poems he is conversing intersubjectively with people, people whom even today's readers might avoid.20 In The Prelude , Wordsworth explains the importance such interaction holds; he finds "steadiness, and healing" in meeting and conversing with "men obscure and lowly" during his rural walks (13.181, 13.183; see also 13.151-85). Yet in this work he only details one specific encounter, that with the discharged veteran (see also 4.369-468). The treatment of the blind Beggar is quite a contrast to Wordsworth's admiration of the tall beggar woman and her two sons who, intriguingly, "might flit / Precursors to Aurora's car" in "Beggars" (1807, composed 1802). 21 Wordsworth's faltering in front of the blind Beggar is signifi- cant because of his legacy of skillfully transmuting intersubjective</page><page sequence="7">Emily V. Epstein Kobayashi 829 encounter into intrasubjective poetic creation. The Prelude was published in a Victorian context that looked to poets for "instruc- tion and the comfort of spiritual guidance," a function Wordsworth performed even for his earlier contemporaries, as Barrett Brown- ing notes: "Mr. Wordsworth's life does present a high moral to his generation/'22 An exploration of "the history of the Author's mind," The Prelude does not do adequate justice to the author's earlier revolutionary intersubjective poetic vision, a vision that placed "The Old Cumberland Beggar" (1800) in a central, morally educative place within the rural community.23 The much-loved line "We have all of us one human heart" is repeatedly quoted in the Victorian literary scene.24 Matthew Arnold mourns Words- worth's loss in "Memorial Verses April 1850": "who, will make us feel?"25 A New Spirit of the Age describes Wordsworth's relation to his audience: "Wordsworth holds their humanity within his own, and teaches them out of it, and blesses them from the heights of his priestly office" (1:323). This statement points not only to Wordsworth's relevance to Barrett Browning's intrasubjective life but also to the nature of his own intrasubjective vision. Barrett Browning must have felt compelled to revise the poet's encounter with the urban outcast. In Aurora Leigh, she enables a revision by creating a rich context that builds on Wordsworth's "feeling intellect," described in the closing book of The Prelude as a receptivity to all that friendship, all that love can do, All that a darling countenance can look Or dear voice utter, to complete the man, Perfect him, made imperfect in himself. (14.221-4) Following these lines, Wordsworth pays homage to his sister Dorothy Wordsworth and friend Samuel T. Coleridge of the Lake School. Barrett Browning externalizes Wordsworth's implicitly intersubjective vision through poet Aurora's piecing of truth "with another's life," that of the urban outcast (7.914). After gaining feeling intellect, Aurora can express the intersubjective truth, that she cannot "in this ragged, narrow life of mine, / Contain my own conclusions" (7.918-9). Both Kathleen Blake and Linda Peterson explore Aurora Leigh's revision of Wordsworth's development in The Prelude.26 "Feeling intellect," courtesy of Marian, allows Aurora to reach the final blest union with Romney to which Blake refers; Aurora</page><page sequence="8">830 Feeling Intellect in Aurora Leigh and The Prelude "must attempt to achieve at the end of her story the stage at which [Wordsworth] starts."27 Marian, whose first words to Aurora are in the voice of a "hurried dove" enables this union (3.796). 28 John Woolford notes that Victorian critics attribute Wordsworthian qualities to "My Doves" (1838), a poem that describes Barrett Browning's own struggle in London: So teach ye me the wisest part, My little doves! to move Along the city-ways with heart.29 Dorothy Mermin, Catherine Shumadine, and Woolford find Ro- salind of "The Poet's Vow" gives voice with her written words to deceased Lucy in Wordsworth's "A Slumber Did My Spirit Seal"; similarly, via his thwarted mirror image, the vivid "punctual presence" of the blind Beggar, Aurora expands Wordsworth's intersubjective poetic practice beyond his native countryside.30 Wordsworth neither feels himself to be, nor reverences with love the punctual presence within the city; instead, the goal seems to be intrasubjective fusion: The human nature unto which I felt That I belonged, and reverenced with love, Was not a punctual presence, but a spirit Diffused through time and space. (8.608-11) Aurora's discovery of Marian in Paris in book 6 of Aurora Leigh re- calls Wordsworth's reaction to seeing the blind Beggar in London. Wordsworth is lost in thought, overcome by the individual mys- teries of the faces that pass him in the street, when he is struck: Thus have I looked, nor ceased to look, oppressed By thoughts of what and whither, when and how, Until the shapes before my eyes became A second-sight procession, such as glides Over still mountains, or appears in dreams; And once, far -travelled in such mood, beyond The reach of common indication, lost Amid the moving pageant, I was smitten Abruptly, with the view (a sight not rare) Of a blind Beggar, who, with upright face, Stood, propped against a wall, upon his chest</page><page sequence="9">Emily V. Epstein Kobayashi 831 Wearing a written paper, to explain His story, whence he came, and who he was. Caught by the spectacle my mind turned round As with the might of waters; an apt type This label seemed of the utmost we can know, Both of ourselves and of the universe; And, on the shape of that unmoving man, His steadfast face and sightless eyes, I gazed, As if admonished from another world. (7.630-49) Wordsworth's imagination is simultaneously captured and re- pelled by the blind Beggar. He famously experiences admonish- ment in "Resolution and Independence," but its use in "Essay, Supplementary to the Preface" (1815) is most instructive: "in every thing which is to send the soul into herself, to be admon- ished of her weakness, or to be made conscious of her power ... the Poet must reconcile himself for a season to few and scattered hearers."31 Wordsworth refers to the more selectively experienced sublime power of imagination in contrast to the superficial ap- preciation of fancy, and here Wordsworth's imagination is made aware of his weakness. Within the urban context, Wordsworth cannot move beyond fancy.32 He cannot intrasubjectively read the city; the intellectual eye cannot see. Before she finds Marian, Aurora is in a similarly distracted state of mind as she wanders through the "Market-place of Flow- ers" in an urban environment: So wandering, musing, with the artist's eye, That keeps the shade-side of the thing it loves, Half-absent, whole-observing, while the crowd Of young vivacious and black-braided heads Dipped, quick as finches in a blossomed tree, Among the nosegays, cheapening this and that In such a cheerful twitter of rapid speech, - My heart leapt in me, startled by a voice . . . turning the face round So close upon me that I felt the sigh It turned with. (6.427-41)</page><page sequence="10">832 Feeling Intellect in Aurora Leigh and The Prelude Barrett Browning is able to go beyond the bodily eye because she loves the blind Beggar and Wordsworth; alter-ego Aurora thinks "with the artisťs eye." Intersubjective love is possible because there is no polarization or bifurcation of vision. Wordsworth's vision is similarly "whole-observing" in his follow-up to "The Beg- gars," "Sequel to the Foregoing": he remembers the boys of "The Beggars" within "a genial hour, / When universal nature breathed / As with the breath of one sweet flower." Love is here, as he entreats of "Kind Spirits" and "pitying Heaven" that the boys be "free / From touch of deadly injury?"33 Aurora's sensual perception of Marian's physical punctual presence enables the poeťs engagement and exemplifies the poeťs credo: the artist who separates the natural and the spiritual "writes unreal verse" (7.767). A "cyclamen" (6.445), Marian is the flower a poet sees in this world: every natural flower which grows on earth Implies a flower upon the spiritual side, Substantial, archetypal, all a-glow With blossoming causes. (7.840-3) The poet feels her sigh and attempts to catch "something of the bloom and breath" (7.845). Barrett Browning revises Wordsworth's reflective mentali response, his mind that turns toward the blind Beggar, as Aurora's heart responds to Marian in a reference to Wordsworth's "My Heart Leaps Up When I Behold" (1807), a poem Barrett Browning repeatedly quotes in her correspondence.34 Aurora's "feeling intellect" makes "natural piety" possible; her receptivity to Marian can be predicted from the first time she meets her: "She touched me with her face and with her voice, / This daughter of the people" (3.805-6). Why does Wordsworth's feeling intellect fail to engage with the urban blind Beggar? He confesses that it is not only his bodily eye holding his "mind / In absolute dominion" and fancy trumping imagination, that "interrupt / [His] deeper feelings" (12.130-1, 12. 122-3); he is aware of a cause, "That almost seems inherent in the creature, / A twofold frame of body and of mind" (12. 125-6). His bifurcation of the eye into the intellectual and the bodily and his privileging of the former are, in Roman Jakobson's sense, métonymie;35 as the most intellectual of the senses, vision has the power to displace union with separation. Is the bifurcated eye the result or cause of interruption of feeling? Like Coleridge, who</page><page sequence="11">Emily V. Epstein Kobayashi 833 writes of "the despotism of the bodily eye" in Biographia Literaria (1817), 36 Wordsworth rebels against John Locke's theory that imagination is dependent upon bodily sensate experience, but by becoming overly introspective, Wordsworth becomes bound to perception of perception, or Lockean reflection that is stagnat- ing. Basil Willey points to the limits of drawing upon the past.37 While Wordsworth notes in the "Preface to Lyrical Ballads " that thoughts are "representatives of all our past feelings," feeling of course denotes emotional experience but etymologically connotes bodily sensate experience.38 Contemporary sensory experience is perhaps needed to refresh feeling. In The Prelude , Wordsworth seems to chart a development away from the idealism present in the blest Babe passage, where feeling has to him imparted power That through the growing faculties of sense Doth like an agent of the one great Mind Create, creator and receiver both, Working but in alliance with the works Which it beholds. (2.255-60) Instead, as Hartman notes, Wordsworth's frame of mind in the blind Beggar passage shares similarities with that found in the morbidly renovating spots of time,39 those times when 'The mind is lord and master - outward sense / The obedient servant of her will" (12.222-3), a frame of mind that leads to a characteristic "separation between observer and observed."40 An intersubjective orientation returns the poet to mortal embodiment, a simpler acceptance of mortality present in "My Heart Leaps Up When I Behold." Aurora Leigh recognizes her own division, when "Day and night / I worked my rhythmic thought" (3.271-2): 'I,' means in youth Just /, the conscious and eternal soul With all its ends, and not the outside life, The parcel-man, the doublet of the flesh. (3.283-6) Barrett Browning echoes Wordsworth's Miltonic refusal to</page><page sequence="12">834 Feeling Intellect in Aurora Leigh and The Prelude bow down the soul Under a growing weight of vulgar sense, And substitute a universe of death For that which moves with light and life informed. (14.158-61) Milton describes Hell in Paradise Lost (1667) as "A universe of death," which is where Aurora seems to be as her self-division is reflected in her graphic, judgmental descriptions of the im- poverished crowds pouring into Marian and Romney' s thwarted wedding: they are blood, snakes, a pack, and their faces are vices (4.553-98, 4.851).41 Yet rather than equating sense with Hell, Marian's "Revolted soul and flesh were reconciled" (3. 1 138), and Aurora's vision is deepened and widened as her own body and soul begin to come together (7.1269-71). Wordsworth states that the foundational experience of "intel- lectual Love" (14.207; see also 14.206-18), a solitary wedding of love to the imagination and its associated falling off of sense in the sublime experience of nature (see also 6.592-605), allows a person to gain the height of "feeling intellect." In Aurora's development, feeling intellect grows from itself, from intersubjectivity, as the polypsychical transformation of the blind Beggar is interwoven with another metaleptic revision, Barrett Browning's externaliza- tion of Wordsworth's ideal scene of love, the blest Babe passage of book 2 (2.232-44). Wordsworth describes the blest Babe as pos- sessing "the first / Poetic spirit of our human life," and he essen- tially describes the beginning of feeling intellect: the infant "with his soul / Drinks in the feelings of his Mother's eye!" (2. 236-7). 42 Yet though the Babe is "No outcast," Wordsworth does not rec- ognize his sensual infancy as the beginning of "feeling intellect" (2.241; see also 2.245-68). Instead of Wordsworth's foundational sublime experience of the power of imagination, Aurora's foun- dational existential experience is a decidedly unblessed infancy, described in a passage that clearly revises Wordsworth's ( Aurora Leigh, 1.35-45). She gains a nascent empathy that survives, in an idealized notion of love, a time of solitariness (see 1.673-8). Marian tells Aurora about her own infancy, a tragic reflection of Aurora's, and finally the poet witnesses a blessed scene between Marian and her child conceived through Marian's involuntary prostitution or rape (see 3.881-99 and 6.567-612). Poet Aurora's childhood feeling of being "Left out at night in shutting up the fold" enables her to associate with Marian, "the outcast child" who at three years is forced to "run off from the fold" (1.42, 3.873, and 3.882).</page><page sequence="13">Emily V. Epstein Kobayashi 835 Perhaps both the association of Dorothy Wordsworth with the feeling intellect passage (14.221-4) and the model of Word- sworth's intersubjective life inform Barrett Browning's portrayal of Marian and Aurora's developing relationship.43 Barrett Brown- ing read of Dorothy's importance to Wordsworth's development in Thomas De Quincey's "Lake Reminiscences."44 De Quincey writes at length about Dorothy and Wordsworth's admission of debt to her in "The Sparrow's Nest" and in his unpublished "philosophic poem" (see also The Prelude , 14.246-54). 45 Implicit in Dorothy's intrasubjective inspiration is William's intersubjective recognition. In The Prelude , in a movement from intersubjectivity to intrasu- bjectivity, Dorothy loses her human shape and is figured as a stream (11.336-42) - Wordsworth's representation for his own poetic development - or as an inspiring current of air: "thy breath, / Dear Sister! was a kind of gentler spring / That went before my steps" (14. 264-6). 46 In a move from intrasubjective influence to intersubjectivity, Barrett Browning has Aurora follow a fully embodied Marian across the stream to begin a relationship with the "fallen" woman: Marian led The way, and I, as by a narrow plank Across devouring waters, followed her, Stepping by her footsteps, breathing by her breath. (6.500-3) Aurora and Marian's encounter engages the figure of the stream and implies that Wordsworth's use of this classical metonym for the soul is, in Burke's sense, a severe reduction of his poetic practice. M. H. Abrams notes this figure of the soul in Romantic writing is "usually reformed to imply a bilateral transaction ... between mind and external object"; instead, the stream represents the artist's fusion with Nature in intrasubjective vision and reflec- tion (see The Prelude, 14.70-4 and 14. 201-2). 47 Imagination has "been the feeding source / Of our long labour: we have traced the stream," but it does not allow Wordsworth to see in the city and engage with the blind Beggar (14.193-4). Barrett Browning knew Dorothy Wordsworth tamed nature's terror for William, balancing, as Lindenberger points out, his pathos with her ethos, and Marian likewise tames the city's ter- ror for Aurora. The stream and the wind are no longer " literally intermediaries between the visible and the invisible worlds," but the stream does continue "to prepare the reader for the great mo-</page><page sequence="14">836 Feeling Intellect in Aurora Leigh and The Prelude ments of vision" of intersubjective love.48 Marian brings Aurora to her baby and wakes him, allowing the poet to witness the union of natural form and spiritual substance that is their love, "seeing that love / Includes the whole of nature, rounding it / To love . . [sic] no more, - since more can never be" (6.601-3, see also 6.567- 612). Humans echo the lamb and mother illustrating Words- worth's diminutive "love" by which, nonetheless, "subsists / All lasting grandeur, by pervading love; / That gone, we are as dust" (14.168-70; see also 14.171-87). They are "sublime or beautiful forms, / With the adverse principles of pain and joy" (14.165-6). A New Spirit of the Age describes Wordsworth's poetry in Lockean terms, "passionate in his will and reason, but not in his senses and affections," and Wordsworth's depiction of nature as Lockean, "by sensation and reflection" (1:313, 1:320). Yet in The Prelude , Wordsworth points to the reason for sensation's absence and goes beyond Locke's materialism by noting the connection between love and perception: Love cannot be; nor does it thrive with ease Among the close and overcrowded haunts Of cities, where the human heart is sick, And the eye feeds it not, and cannot feed. (13.202-5) Locke and Wordsworth note that judgment may color perception; however, as Wordsworth described, love tempers harsh judgment and goes hand in hand with sensation. A seemingly Swedenbor- gian Wordsworth "did not judge" before he "was called forth / From the retirement of my native hills, / I loved whate'er I saw" (12.188 and 12.174-6).49 Barrett Browning's urban beggar boy contains Wordsworth's rural context of love (see 6.194-7). New to Barrett Browning's oeuvre, the beggar, "Who stares unseen against our absent eyes," holds a transitional position that belies his significance as a pow- erful synecdochic representative of Aurora Leigh s revision (6. 187). Angela Leighton points out the beggar boy's role, that "Marian appears like the muse of Aurora's new, different, contemporary poetics. She is not exactly the 'beggar -boy,' but his female equiva- lent."50 She is also the blind Beggar, who, like the beggar boy, Contains himself both flowers and firmaments And surging seas and aspectable stars</page><page sequence="15">Emily V. Epstein Kobayashi 837 And all that we would push him out of sight In order to see nearer. (6.194-7) He "Bears yet a breastful of a fellow- world / To this world, un- disparaged, undespoiled," the promise of sublime spiritual in- spiration, available to the poet through intersubjective human relationship (6. 190-1). The beggar boy embodies the sublime and the transcendence beyond physical form that attracts Wordsworth to rural humans, described in the "Preface to Lyrical Ballads ": "the passions of men are incorporated with the beautiful and permanent forms of nature."51 As we read Aurora's portrayal, the beggar boy's body seems to slip away, mirroring Wordsworth's intrasubjective vision. While within a fictional work and so a form, "mainly to the pleasure of the mind / What passion makes" him, Barrett Browning establishes within the urbain punctual presence the unity of form and substance that Wordsworth finds unique to Nature: "the forms / Of Nature have a passion in themselves" (13.289-90, 13.290-1). The "noblest synecdoche,"52 the beggar boy embodies the central doctrine of Emanuel Swedenborg' s writings, described by Barrett Browning as "Anthropomorphism, universal in applica- tion" (Barrett Browning to Mitford, 31 October 1842, 6:127-31, 128). 53 The beggar boy is also what Burke describes as the primus inter pares of Aurora Leigh's ironic development. The synecdochic representative of Barrett Browning's revision of Wordsworth's encounter with the blind Beggar, he is "adjectival," sharing at- tributes with the blind Beggar necessary to the total definition of the irony; and "'substantial' as embodying the conclusions of the development as a whole."54 Intrasubjective love enjoins in- tersubjective love, as the beggar boy begins the unfolding of poet Aurora's encounters with the blind Beggar's revisions. Barrett Browning dramatizes dialectic in Burke's Hegelian sense, creating an irony that builds on "the use of mutually related or interact- ing perspectives," so ending the repression of one of the terms in Wordsworth's oppositional métonymie dialectic of the bodily eye and the intellectual eye.55 The beggar boy, Marian, and Romney are "features / Of the same face, blossoms upon one tree" [The Prelude, 6.636-7). Bar- rett Browning transforms the blind Beggar as she utilizes irony to bridge, and so reveals, "the discovery and description of 4 the truth'" that could be. As Burke explains, the trope of "Irony arises when one tries, by the interaction of terms upon one another, to</page><page sequence="16">838 Feeling Intellect in Aurora Leigh and The Prelude produce a development which uses all the terms. Hence, from the standpoint of this total form (this 'perspective of perspec- tives'), none of the participating 'sub-perspectives' can be treated as either precisely right or precisely wrong. They are all voices, or personalities, or positions, integrally affecting one another."56 In structuralist terms, the paradigmatic blind Beggar becomes syntagmatic within the construct of fictional Aurora Leigh. The replaceable, the site of reflection, becomes irreplaceable, as the messy business of intersubjective relation with Marian and Rom- ney allows Aurora to become a sage.57 The beggar boy's revelatory effect on Aurora's feeling intellect is evidenced in her first sighting of Marian in the city, 135 lines later. Both passages demonstrate Barrett Browning's resolution of veiy early questions about Locke's materialism, despite her "profound admiration and almost mysterious reverence for the greatest of Metaphysicians." In her unpublished "Defence of the Bishop of Worcester's Objection to Mr. Lockes [sic] assertion 'that possibly we shall never be able to know whether any mere mate- riali Being thinks or no'" (1820), Barrett Browning alludes to the omission of "soul" in Locke's argument.58 Both Wordsworth and Barrett Browning seem to respond to Locke's denial of the valid- ity of an image, "the having the idea of anything in our mind, no more proves the existence of that thing, than the picture of a man evidences his being in the world." Barrett Browning's poetic vision would seem to encompass Locke's qualification: "no par- ticular man can know the existence of any other being, but only when, by actually operating upon him, it makes itself perceived by him."59 While Locke describes one's own sensory perception, Barrett Browning emphasizes that the other material being is able to think and feel; moreover "more's felt than is perceived" (7.891): And those eyes To-day, I do remember, saw me too, As I saw them, with conscious lids astrain In recognition. Now a fantasy, A simple shade or image of the brain, Is merely passive, does not retro-act, Is seen, but sees not. (6.325-31) Reminiscent of Wordsworth's vision of the blind Beggar, "Struc- tures like these the excited spirit mainly / Builds for herself (Aurora Leigh, 7.651-2), and of the feeling intellect passage, the</page><page sequence="17">Emily V. Epstein Kobayashi 839 narrative changes as Aurora gives Marian a chance to prove herself: "Twas a real face" (6.332). Through the intersubjective engagement that begins here, as Leighton points out, "it is really Marian who finally saves her."60 Marian will not only foster Aurora's feeling intellect, but she also decides not to many Romney. Aurora's encounter with the latter punctual presence in London echoes Wordsworth's realiza- tion of the sublime power of the imagination in the Alps, to my conscious soul I now can say - "I recognise thy glory": in such strength Of usurpation, when the light of sense Goes out ... There harbours, whether we be young or old. Our destiny, our being's heart and home, Is with infinitude. (6.598-605) On seeing Romney tormented by the crowds at St. James's Church because Marian fails to show up to wed him, Aurora Leigh struggles to precipitate myself Head-foremost to the rescue of my soul In that white face, . . [sic] till some one caught me back, And so the world went out, - I felt no more. (4.874-7) Barrett Browning intuits the gaping hole that leads to the poet's sublime experience. Aurora reflects back on the loss of her mother at four years of age, as Barrett Browning alludes to eight-year -old Wordsworth's loss: Life calls to us In some transformed, apocalyptic voice, Perhaps we name it Nature's voice, or Love's. (1.673-6) Feeling intellect will tame Wordsworth's attraction to nature that "Hath terror in it" and will help Aurora hold on to her senses that she might engage in intersubjective love (14.246).</page><page sequence="18">840 Feeling Intellect in Aurora Leigh and The Prelude Romney is the intrasubjective nexus who revises both Word- sworth and the blind Beggar and holds the souls of their revi- sions, Aurora and Marian (4.874-7, 4.970-2). He is not a poet because his "mother took fright at the ugly world," and while he was figuratively blind to himself, Marian, and Aurora, he under- stands Aurora's poetry after his sudden blindness at the end of Aurora Leigh (4.765). Romney's truer love for this punctual pres- ence goes hand in hand with his refutation of his earlier self that would cry to God that everywhere The government is slipping from his hand, Unless some other Christ (say Romney Leigh) Come up and toil and moil and change the world. (8.673-6) Peterson notes the parallel between Romney and Wordsworth, finding his initial faith in socialist schemes to be "the narrative equivalent of the French Revolution," but Romney becomes the essential revolutionary as he works at embodying Wordsworth's intersubjective poetic sense.61 Aurora and Romney's final union is possible because the poet embraces her own body and that of the urban outcast. Peterson notes that Barrett Browning is able to finish Wordsworth's story of an encounter with a prostitute in book 7; Wordsworth cannot, because he judges: "for a barrier seemed at once / Thrown in, that from humanity divorced / Humanity" (7.388-90).62 Aurora's own initial condemnation of Marian reflects a self-division that has, in fact, led to Marian's condition (see 6.631-43); as Joyce Zonana points out, "Marian's rape can be described as a consequence of Aurora's willful denial of her own body and Romney's stubborn denial of his own spirit."63 Does Barrett Browning imply the delete- rious social significance of Wordsworth's self-described division? Aurora comes to understand the context that leads to Marian's victimization and the change that is necessary; a person must Not one day, in the artist's ecstasy, But every day, feast, fast, or working-day, reverence ... even his very body as a man, - Which now he counts so vile, that all the towns Make offal of their daughters for its use. (7.858-66)</page><page sequence="19">Emily V. Epstein Kobayashi 841 Barrett Browning's wish for appreciation of the human body echoes Wordsworth's persistent scene of intellectual love, an in- trasubjective reading of the Alps that does not go away, that will lead to a misreading of the city: "Not rich one moment to be poor for ever; / Not prostrate, overborne, as if the mind / Herself were nothing" (6.735-7). In Wordsworth's future, the scene administered To grandeur or to tenderness, - to the one Directly, but to tender thoughts by means Less often instantaneous in effect. (6.747-50) Feeling intellect has no place when Wordsworth wishfully re- vises the city and overlays it with nature (7.745-71, 8.631-8) in an example of what James H. Averill describes as "Individual remembrances' working on present 'shapes.'" Averill notes the significance of Wordsworth's turn within the city, "From those sad scenes when meditation turned, / Lo! every thing that was indeed divine / Retained its purity inviolate" (8.654-6). Instead of "purity inviolate" being that of human nature, it seems only Wordsworth's nature could retain such purity.64 Wordsworth's championing of nature is prophetic, given today's environmental state; nonetheless, the reader has nothing to attach the label "indeed divine" to in the city, much as the blind Beggar cannot see Wordsworth. Feeling intellect, or intersubjective relationship with those of the Lake School, led to Wordsworth's receptivity to all of Na- ture's various facets. Wordsworth's poetry informs Aurora Leigh's formidable task of uniting body and mind in a less-than-ideal exploitative urban environment, allowing her to confront on an intersubjective basis the city's problems. Aurora and Romney's final intersubjective union seems very much like intrasubjective fusion: which of our two large explosive hearts So shook me? That, I know not. There were words That broke in utterance . . [sic] melted, in the fire, - And deep, deep, shuddering breaths, which meant beyond Whatever could be told by word or kiss. (9.718-24)</page><page sequence="20">842 Feeling Intellect in Aurora Leigh and The Prelude This physical embrace manifests Aurora's description of the artisťs work: the artist transfers "The bloom and breath" of the spiritual world, correspondent to the natural world, "to picture, music, verse, / For thrilling audient and beholding souls / By signs and touches which are known to souls" (7.845, 848-50). Intrasubjectivity approaches intersubjectivity, as spirituality is conceptualized in natural physicality, a fuller sensuality beyond vision that embodies the soul. Wordsworth has taught Barrett Browning this; she reads his poems as "the actual audible breath- ing of his inward spirit's life."65 Barrett Browning has overcome the label's displacement of the blind Beggar by establishing him as subject, or rather, subjects. Instead of "the fragmentation of the body and the self' beyond the mirror Culler describes, Barrett Browning responds to The Prelude by creating a prism that highlights the importance of intersubjective language, the communication that the blind Beggar's label indicates as necessary.66 Wordsworth's profound creative impulse, "an ennobling interchange / Of action from without and from within," centers on "The excellence, pure func- tion, and best power / Both of the object seen, and the eye that sees" (13.375-8). The subject-object relationship is a fascinating one, invoking the artist's creative power, yet the object's funda- mental resistance also invokes a sense of existential futility. Can the object communicate? The subject-object relationship figures strongly in Jacques Lacan's theory of development, referred to by Culler.67 Lacan describes the individual's imaginary sense of wholeness founded in the object of her mirrored reflection. Development beyond the mirror will lead to "the fragmentation of the body and the self," as the individual enters the symbolic order's "'empty' world of language."68 In contrast, Aurora Leigh s world of intersubjective vision demands language. Language plays almost an embodied role as it is externalized from Wordsworth's intrasubjective response, through Barrett Browning's subsequent intrasubjective response into the active exchange of intersubjec- tive engagement within Aurora Leigh. Employing language's basic role of translating "sensory images into structure," Aurora Leigh demonstrates that relationship with others through language might strengthen unification of body and self.69 NOTES Thank you to Joyce Zonana for suggesting I write on Aurora Leigh and The Prelude, and for her support and that of Nancy Easterlin, Peter Schock,</page><page sequence="21">Emily V.

He asserts that "Milton counts for more than nature does, both here and in The Prelude " (Bloom, Poetry and Repression: Revisionism from Blake to Stevens [New Haven and London: Yale Univ.

The thetic "establishes] the identification of the subject and its object as precondi- tions of propositionality." Wordsworth's thetic of identification with nature undergoes a "transposition" in Barrett Browning's creation of Aurora Leigh. A synecdochic description of the intrasubjective process, essentially focused on its intellectual aspects, is found in Kristeva's term. Developed from the structuralist term intertextuality, transposition "specifies that the passage from one signifying system to another demands a new articulation of the thetic - of enunciative and denotative positionality." This passage is "via an instinctual intermediary common to the two systems" (Kristeva, "Revolution in Poetic Language," in The Kristeva Reader, ed. Toril Moi [New York: Colum- bia Univ. Press, 1986], pp. 89-136, 98, 111, and 1 12). If we apply Kristeva's more-complicated description of "thetic," we cannot attribute " identification of the subject and its object" to nature; hence, Kristeva's "transposition" cannot be applied to Wordsworth's intrasubiective relationship with nature. 17 Jonathan Culler, The Pursuit of Signs: Semiotics, Literature, Deconstruc- tion (Ithaca: Cornell Univ.

See also The Prelude, 12. 122. Barrett Browning would perceive Emanuel Swedenborg's logic in Wordsworth's passage. Swedenborg, influenced by Locke, apparently builds on his "Of Simple Ideas of Reflection" within the Essay. Locke finds the origin of ideas in sensory experience and reflection and here lists the "two great and principal actions of the mind: Perception, or Thinking; and Volition, or Willing. [The power of thinking is called the Understanding, and the power of volition is called the Will; and these two powers or abilities in the mind are denominated faculties.]" (1.2.6). Swedenborg brings in the ele- ment of love and an external orientation: "love apart from wisdom (or our volition apart from our discernment) cannot do anything. By the same token, wisdom apart from love (or our discernment apart from our volition) cannot think anything, see or sense anything, or even say anything" (Swedenborg, Angelic Wisdom about Divine Providence, trans. George F. Dole, New Century Edition of the Works of Emanuel Swedenborg [West Chester PA: Swedenborg Foundation, 2003], Section 3). Barrett Browning copied passages from this work in 1850 (see Barrett Browning, Commonplace Book [1850], HM 4934, Huntington Library, San Marino CA). ^Leighton, p. 480. 51 Wordsworth, "Preface to Lyrical Ballads ," p. 597. 52 Found in metaphysical doctrines, "microcosm is related to macrocosm as part to whole, and either the whole can represent the part or the part can represent the whole" (Burke, p. 508). 53 Swedenborg's writings, to which Barrett Browning refers from 1841 onward, probably strengthened her focus on the punctual presence. For ex- ploration of Swedenborg's influence on Barrett Browning, see Simon Avery and Rebecca Stott, Elizabeth Barrett Browning (London: Longman, 2003), pp. 135-9; Linda M. Lewis, Elizabeth Barrett Browning's Spiritual Progress: Face to Face with God (Columbia and London: Univ. of Missouri Press, 1998), pp. 11, 135-6, 141-2, 164-5, 199, 200, 208; and Mermin, pp. 178-9. 54 Burke, p. 516. Burke describes irony as dialectic dramatized (pp. 511-2). 55 Burke, p. 503. Culler notes that in the artificial distinction between two terms, such as fancy and imagination, "the repressed term always inhabits its opposite" (p. 168). 56 Burke, pp. 503, 512. 57Maijorie Stone notes that Aurora is "a sage-in-formation whose wisdom is in process of revision and often contradicted by her own actions" ( Elizabeth Barrett Browning [New York: St. Martin's Press, 1995], p. 162).</page><page sequence="26">848 Feeling Intellect in Aurora Leigh and The Prelude 58 Barrett Browning, "Defence of the Bishop of Worcester's Objection to Mr. Lockes [sic] assertion 'that possibly we shall never be able to know whether any mere material Being thinks or no,'" (1820), D 1287, p. 3, see four-page document, Armstrong Browning Library, Baylor University, Waco TX. Barrett Browning summarizes through book 2, chapter 12 in her "Short Analysis of Locke's 'Essay on Human Understanding' 1825," D 1369, pp. 198-183 [sic] Special Collections, Margaret Clapp Library, Wellesley College Library, Welles- ley MA. "An Essay on Mind" (1826) includes reverential praise for Locke and an entreaty that his influence will "illume me as I write!" But she goes on to compare philosophy which "Reasons, believes, yet cannot plainly see" to poetic rapture (Barrett Browning, "An Essay on Mind," in The Complete Poeti- cal Works of Mrs. Browninq, pp. 499-512, 509; see book 2, lines 877-909). 59 Locke, 4.11.1. ^Leighton, p. 482. 61 Peterson, p. 143. 62 Peterson, p. 133. 63 Zonana, p. 531. ^Averill, pp. 273, 273-4. 65 Barrett Browning, "Review of Poems" p. 757. 66 Culler, p. 165. 67 See Culler's assessment of Jacques Lacan's Ecrits, p. 165.
