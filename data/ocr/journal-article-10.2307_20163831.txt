<plain_text><page sequence="1">Jupiter in Ovid's Metamorphoses CHARLES SEGAL I. JLor his depiction of Jupiter in the Metamor phoses, Ovid had two main epic models, the Homeric and the Virgilian, although in the case of Homer we have to dis tinguish further, between the anthropomorphic Zeus of the Iliad and the more fully moralized Zeus of the Odyssey. The Virgilian Jupiter, like Zeus in the Odyssey, takes seriously his responsibilities as father of gods and men and is identified, though somewhat elusively, with the ultimate order of things and the Fates (as he is also in the Iliad).1 Like the Iliadic Zeus, Virgil's Jupiter has his conflicts with Juno, to be sure, but only on the "higher" political and cosmic plane. He nev er descends to the domestic indignities of the Iliadic Zeus, and his demeanor is almost always stern. When he does smile, it is only in calm, knowing superiority, as when he paternally reassures his worried daughter, Venus, about Aeneas' future in the prophecy scene of Aeneid i.254-56.* This smile of con trol and superiority has an antecedent of sorts in the ironic smile of the Hesiodic Zeus as he lays his trap for Prometheus in the Works and Days (54-60; cf. also Theogony 550-61), but in Virgil is far more benign. At his first appearance in the Iliad Homer's Zeus is on the defensive, uneasy about the reproaches that Hera will make about his aid to Thetis (1.517-23). A few lines later, however, he produces a small earthquake on Olympus by nodding as sent to Thetis with a shake of "the ambrosial hair on his im mortal head" (Iliad 1.528-30): r\ Kai Kuav?rjoiv en' ?^puai ve?ae Kpov?ov au?pooioa 5' apa xa?iai ?rcepp?OGavTO ?vaKto?

(Lattimore) Ovid takes over the Olympian nod to signal his allegiance to the most sublime reaches of the epic tradition (Met. 1.177-80): ergo ubi marm?reo superi sedere recessu, celsior ipse loco sceptroque innixus eburno terrificam capitis concussit terque quaterque caesariem cum qua terram, mare, sidera movit. When all the gods, then, were seated in the marble hall, he himself, higher in his place and leaning on his ivory scepter, shook three and four times the awe-inspiring hair with which he moves earth, sea, and stars. Ovid's Jupiter here demonstrates his dignity in suitably lofty terms as he leans on his ivory scepter (1.178) and recalls his battle with the snake-footed hundred-handers in his con cern for the world order (pro mundi regno, 1.182-86), there by evoking the cosmogonie themes surrounding Thetis' aid in the Iliad.i He thus anchors one side of Jupiter's character in his traditional role as the responsible guardian of human and divine order?a role he will continue to fulfill throughout the poem.4 If we look more closely at this passage, however, some characteristically Ovidian qualifications emerge. The descrip tion of Jupiter here follows directly upon Ovid's humorous little anachronism about the class differences among the gods' homes and the Palatia caeli, Jupiter's Palatine of the sky (1.170-76).5 The language too offers some disturbing dis tractions from Jovian grandeur. Celsior ipse in 1.178, "him self higher," is a self-conscious marker of the sublime or "lofty" style that Ovid is imitating. Ovid goes even "higher" than Homer in the next verse by adding terque quaterque</page><page sequence="3">8o JUPITER IN OVID'S METAMORPHOSES and by noting Jupiter's universal power in the asyndeton of earth, sea, stars. Yet this apparent elevation is also a step from the sublime to the ridiculous, for the multiple shakings of the head (terque quaterque), aside from possibly inducing dizziness in the mighty Olympian, is unworthy of his author ity. For the ruler of the universe one nod should suffice. The word terrificam here (i.i79), also in the high epic style (the first extant use is in Lucretius), is Ovid's addition to the Homeric passage and reinforces one of the dominant charac teristics of his Jupiter, anger and violence. The Homeric Zeus freely uses force to control his wife, hanging her from the heavens with anvils on her ankles in the checkered past of this marital history (//. 15.18-24). He is a bully and a wife-abuser, and so the head of a rather dysfunctional family. In that first scene on Olympus, in fact, the deformed Hephaestus, the only child of Zeus's union with Hera, offers his mother well advised warning about her husband's violent hands (//. 1.586-88).6 Virgil, by con trast, has his Jupiter first appear in a pose of paternal tenderness toward Venus in Aeneid 1, perhaps deliberately reacting against Homer's abusive father-figure. Ovid too tones down the Homeric portrait of the domestic bully and instead emphasizes the oppo site side, the adulterous husband always afraid of getting caught by his suspicious wife. But the violence remains in his emphasis on Jupiter's anger, punitive mood, and destructiveness in the first half of his opening book. Jupiter's ivory scepter and authoritative nod visually crys tallize his possession of universal power in the concilium deo rum that he has called to discuss the recent outrage by Lyca on (i.i67); and it is the prelude to his first speech in the poem (182-98), which significantly begins and ends with Lycaon (1.165, 198). To be sure, Lycaon's crime is a violation of the most fundamental sanctities and so justifies Jupiter's wrath. In having Jupiter begin his first speech (and the first embed ded narrative in the poem) with Lycaon, Ovid is clearly lead ing his audience from the familiar creation myths to his poem's particular subject, metamorphosis, and restamping the traditionally elevated epic motifs of the concilium deo rum and the theodicy with his own poem's signature motif of</page><page sequence="4">Charles Segal 81 metamorphosis. Putting the poem's first tale of metamorpho sis in Jupiter's mouth lends his subject something of the grandeur of the speaker. Yet Ovid is surely tongue-in-cheek about this pseudo-epic magnificatio of his poem's theme. Some of the comic effect comes from a certain disproportion of emphasis between the tales of cosmogonie creation and an individual Arcadian wrongdoer. It is as if the ruler of the world has becomes fixated on punishing a single human criminal. Whereas the Iliad introduces the Olympian ruler in terms of his somewhat lighter side, his quarrels with Hera (//. 1.517-23, 540-67), Ovid holds this aspect of Jupiter tem porarily in abeyance. It is not a personal plea from Thetis but human wrongdoing that brings Jupiter on the scene, and so far he appears only in this public role. Yet the contradictions soon emerge in the Io episode, where Jupiter's proclamation of his grandeur to the frightened girl (virgo, 1.589) leads up to the comic theme of the furta mariti ("husband's decep tions") that follows (1.595-600, 601-9). Whereas the lovesick Apollo, though menacing (1.533-42), prefers persuasion to force and does not actually overpower or rape Daphne in the closely parallel preceding tale, Jupiter satisfies his lust quickly and brutally, as the rapid sequence and homoeoteleu ton of the three verbs of 1.600 indicate (cum deus inducta latas cal?gine terras I occuluit tenuitque fugam rapuitque pu dorem, "when the god, bringing mist upon the wide earth, hid and checked her flight and snatched away her virginity" )J Earlier Jupiter had caused the earth to be covered with clouds and water (induc?as flamina nubes, 1.263), ostensibly to save its "better part." Later, when he saves the world from the conflagration caused by Phaethon, he also tries to bring clouds over the earth (unde solet nubes latis inducere terris, "whence he is wont to bring clouds upon the wide earth," 2.308). But the echo of the nearly identical language in the rape of Io {1.599) reminds us of his less noble motives and his less exalted behavior. Similarly, his epithet pater omni potens (2.401), just before his attack on Callisto and directly after his concern for the world order in the Phaethon episode,</page><page sequence="5">82 JUPITER IN OVID'S METAMORPHOSES takes up the by now familiar discrepancy between Jovian grandeur (1.154, also 1.163) and Jovian lust.8 Here too, as in the Io episode of the previous book, Jupiter has to reckon at once with Juno's suspicions and reproaches (2.422-24; cf. 1.601-24). The Europa episode at the end of book 2 brings Jupiter's two sides together in a famous programmatic contrast of maiestas and amor fundamental to the contradictions and in stabilities in the poem's representations of the gods: non bene conveniunt nee in una sede morantur I maiestas et amor ("Majesty and love do not come together well nor dwell in the same place," 2.846-47).? Concomitantly Jupiter leaves behind the scepter that he leaned on so authoritatively at his first appearance (sceptri gravitate relicta, 2.846; cf. 1.178). Henceforth the contrast between Jovian solemnity and Jo vian indignity pervades the poem. The Pi?rides begin their musical competition against the Muses in book 5 with a gi gantomachy, but the gods are defeated (5.319-20) and take refuge in Egypt, where Jupiter transforms himself into a ram, the etiology for the cult of Jupiter Ammon (5.327-28). Cal liope's song, in grandiose language and in the complex syn tax worthy of epic (5.346-48), opens with the Sicilian setting of Aetna piled on the "Giant limbs" of the now subdued Typhoeus (Giganteis membris, 346). These Gigantea mem bra, one may hazard, are also po?tica membra, a metaphor for verse as old as Aristophanes.10 The Muses self-consciously heap up the massive limbs/verses appropriate to a gigan tomachy. Yet all this Olympian defense of the cosmic order is only a foil to a tale of Venus' power, Pluto's love for Proser pina (significantly juxtaposing Virgilian echoes of arma manus que ["arms and hands"] with the darts of Cupid, 365-66).XI Pluto's fear for the condition of his underworld realm when he is erotically distracted by Proserpina is a self-conscious re prise of Jupiter's similar behavior after the Phaethon episode (5.356-58 and 2.401-3). In book 10 Orpheus, traditionally the son of the Muse Cal liope, resumes this contrast between erotic themes and the gigantomachy of the Pi?rides and the Muses. He even strikes</page><page sequence="6">Charles Segal 83 up the lyre in the same way (cf. 5.339 and 10.145-46). He starts off with the "power of Jupiter, " which he sang with "heavier plectrum" (10.148-51). But a few lines later his first tale recounts Jupiter's passion for Ganymede. Orpheus in fact tries to preserve some shreds of Jupiter's dignitas by trans forming him into a nobler creature than the Pi?rides had allowed and giving him a somewhat less undignified motiva tion, love rather than fear, when Jupiter chooses the shape of an eagle to carry off Ganymede ("There was found some thing that Jupiter would prefer to be rather than what he was," 10.15 5-61), one of Jupiter's more briefly recounted metamorphoses in the poem. Here too, as amor again under cuts the maiestas of a gigantomachy, the demeaning domes tic quarrels of Jupiter's comic side make their appearance, albeit briefly, in Juno's opposition to the pretty cupbearer (in vitaque Iovi nectar Iunone ministrat, 10.161, "despite Juno's unwillingness he serves the nectar to Jupiter"). The contrast of "light" and "heavy" lyre (plectro graviore, leviore lyra, 10.150, 152) corresponds to the contrasting moods of Jovian gigantomachy and Jovian amours. Ovid's ways of treating the Olympian ruler self-consciously embodies the contrasting thematic and stylistic levels of the poem. Ovid's introduction of Jupiter in book 1, as we have noted, frees him from the squabbles of the Iliad's Zeus but raises a different set of doubts about his character. At his first ap pearance, in sending Saturn down to shadowy Tartarus and bringing on the Silver Age (1.113-15), Jupiter at once short ens the springtime (luppiter antiqui contraxit t?mpora ueris, i.i 16; cf. 1.107) and introduces the extremes of heat and cold that force humankind to take shelter in caves and thick ets ( 1.116-22). Ovid is closely following Virgil's first G?orgie (i.i20-59); but Virgil's Jupiter, though stern in the labor im probus ("harsh toil") that his reign demands (G. 1.129-35), nevertheless wants mortals to learn how to invent the arts of civilization (ut uarias usus meditando extunderet artis I paula tim, G.i.133-34, "so that man might forge the various arts and crafts by practising their uses"; cf. 145, turn uariae uenere artes, "then the various arts and crafts arrived"). Ovid's</page><page sequence="7">84 JUPITER IN OVID'S METAMORPHOSES Jupiter has no such educational goal, and the arts of civiliza tion that follow appear merely as the consequences of living in a harsher world (turn primum subiere domos .. ., "then for the first times humans entered houses," 1.121-24). W/hereas Saturn's Golden Age required no punishments, fear, or threats (1.89-93), Jupiter's first acts in the poem are punitive, sending Saturn down to "shadowy Tartarus." Punishments, poenae, in fact, frame Jupiter's second speech, in which he ex presses his satisfaction at his chastisement of Lycaon (poenas, 209, 243). The severe authority of a vindex ("punisher, aveng er") and his punishment (vindicta), blissfully absent from the Golden Age, also recurs (1.210, 230; cf. 89, 93).12 When Jupiter destroys the threatening Giants, there are sug gestions of excessive force as he "breaks Olympus with his thunderbolt" (turn pater omnipotens misso perfregit Olym pum I fulmine, i.i54~55).I3 In his destruction of the human race by the deluge later, his wrath is not even satisfied with vengeance from the sky (nee caelo contenta suo est lovis ira, i.274).x4 Ovid's ideally merciful Jupiter of the Tristia will allow the skies to clear after he has hurled his thunderbolt (Tristia 2.32-36); the Jupiter of Metamorphoses 1, having launched a thunderbolt (unsuccessfully) at Lycaon, does not rest until he lets loose the deluge upon the entire human race (1.244-92). When Horace's Jupiter, for example, reaches for his thunderbolt in anger, the fault clearly lies with human transgression (C. 1.3.38-40): caelum ipsum petimus stultitia neque I per nostrum patimur scelus I iracunda lovem poner? fulmina ("In our folly we seek the very heavens, nor through our crime do we allow Jupiter to put away his angry thun derbolts"). In the Metamorphoses the human guilt is less clear. Initially, Jupiter would scatter thunderbolts indiscriminately over the whole earth (1.253-54) but desists only because he fears for his own celestial realm. Soon after, Neptune, under his influence, adopts his brother's violence and urges the streams to pour forth their waters with all their force (1.277-80). The destruction of Virgil's pastoral locus amoenus is a leit motif of the Metamorphoses.^ It is particularly prominent</page><page sequence="8">Charles Segal 85 here in the first book, with the violent ending of the Lycaon episode and the overlay of the bloody death of Argus on a peaceful pastoral setting that harks back to the Eclogues.16 In the Callisto episode of book 2 Arcadian peace is the setting for violent rape; and the end of the story refers back to the Lycaon episode of book 1, so that it brings together the two proto-Arcadians, Lycaon, the poem's first Arcadian (cf. 2.496-97 and 1.217), and Areas, the eponymous hero of Arcadia. This Arcadia holds rape and near matricide, as Lycaon's Arcadia in book 1 held the violation of the sanctity of guests and near cannibalism.^ Near the end of the poem, in the Acis-Galatea episode, Ovid replaces the innocuous and foolish Polyphemus of Theocritus Idylls 6 and 11 (and indi rectly of Virgil's Eighth Eclogue) with a murderous brute. But at the opening of the poem the destroyer of pastoral is Jupiter himself. Even when he acts to preserve Arcadia's characteris tic rustic divinities, his motives are suspect. Far from being Virgil's playful realm of rustic amours, with a benign savior god in the Roman background (E. 1.6-10), Ovid's Arcadia stands under the threat of an omnipotens who is simultane ously capricious and dangerous, hypocritical and destructive. Deucalion, the sole survivor of the flood, along with his wife Pyrrha, in his limited mortal knowledge, assumes that the decision to destroy humankind is the will of all the gods (sic uisum superis, 1.366; ira deorum, 378).18 Ovid has made it clear, however, that the decision and the anger are Jupiter's alone (1.253-6-1). Ovid leads up to this decision in two stages. At the first announcement of Lycaon's crime, all the gods raise a shout (confremuere omnes, 1.199). After his speech describing Lycaon's punishment and his decision to destroy the whole human raise, some gods approve by voice (dicta lovis pars uoee probant, 1.244), but all feel grief (dolor) at the ensuing loss and have reservations (1.246-50), even if their motives are not entirely disinterested. Even when Jupi ter saves the world later from the ravages of Phaethon's un controlled chariot, he faces Phoebus' accusations of unnecessary violence (2.391-93), which he would counter, in part, by imperious threats (minas regaliter addit, 2.397), again in</page><page sequence="9">86 JUPITER IN OVID'S METAMORPHOSES contrast to the absence of threats in the pre-Jovian Golden Age (nee uerba minantia fixol aere legebantur, 1.91-92, "nor were threatening words read on the bronze tablet fastened [to a public wall]"). It does not improve Jupiter's portrait that his show of responsibility for the ravaged world is at once interrupted by his violent rape of Callisto (2.410-12), where the details demean the attacker and win sympathy for the helpless and innocent victim (e.g., 2.422-33, 433-40). To replace the mortals destroyed in the flood, Jupiter prom ises a race "different from the previous one," through a "won drous origin" (1.252-53). Yet only the second part of this promise seems to be fulfilled, for, when Deucalion and Pyr rha create their stony race of future humans, they simply duplicate the hard lot of the mortal condition (1.400-15, es pecially 414-15) The innumerae figurae and nova monstra (1.436-37) created after the flood arise sponte sua, of their own accord (1.417), and show little trace of Jupiter's agency (1.416-37). Ovid's Jupiter, of course, is neither entirely comic nor en tirely destructive. There are positive touches in his knowledge of the fata (1.256-58), his pity (belated though it is) for the two survivors of the deluge (1.324-29), and his appreciation of their piety (1.327). But the hints of violence, arbitrariness, and irascibility have a cumulative force. Thus we are pre pared for the contrast between Jupiter's abrupt coercion of Io in his first amour and Apollo's milder treatment of Daphne in his. Even Jupiter's pity for Io, when it finally arrives, takes the form of the bloody killing of Argus.x? Jupiter comes closer to the Virgilian pater omnipotens when he announces the apotheosis of Hercules that will make him augusta gravitate uerendum (9.268-72, "revered with august grandeur"). Yet even here Jupiter exhibits egotistical and au thoritarian traits (9.255-58) and has a residual conflict with Juno (9.259-61). The whole scene, moreover, is undercut by the abrupt change to feminine concerns in the exchange be tween Alcmena and her pregnant daughter-in-law Iole, with its folksy account of Alcmena's labor and delivery and a gravitas more down to earth than the augusta gravitas offered Hercules</page><page sequence="10">Charles Segal 87 (tendebat gravitas uterum mihi, "the heaviness [of baby Her cules] was weighing down my womb," 9.287).20 2. Hera's deception of Zeus in Iliad 14 introduced an anthro pomorphically philandering god. As Zeus succumbs to Hera's charms, he reaches for her with a little speech in which he states his overpowering desire, greater even than in his at traction to various mortal and immortal women who have born him sons (14.313-28). When Virgil borrows from this scene in Aeneid 1, he takes over only the motif of Hera's bribe to Hypnos with the promise of one of the Graces in marriage; and the bribe is directed at the minor divinity, Ae olus, so that he will release the storm-winds against Aeneas' fleet. But Virgil also adapts the motif of the Olympian god put to sleep by love-making much later, namely in Vulcan's response to Venus' request for Aeneas' armor in book 8 (Aen. 8.404-6): ea uerba locutus optatos dedit amplexus placidumque petivit coniugis infusus gremio per membra soporem. When he had spoken these words, he gave the hoped for embraces and relaxed on [literally poured into] the bosom of his wife sought peaceful sleep. This passage is one of the few genuinely humorous touches in the Aeneid. As Venus fondles Vulcan "here and there with her snowy arms," he becomes inflamed and, like Lucretius' Mars at the opening of De Rerum Natura, is "bound by the eternal wound of love" (aeterno devinctus uulnere amoris, 8.394; cf. Lucr. 1.34, aeterno devictus uulnere amoris, "sub dued by the eternal wound of love"). "If you had a similar concern for me," Vulcan says, "it would have been right (fas) for me to have armed all the Trojans; and neither the omni potent Father nor the Fates would forbid Troy to stand for another ten years and Priam to survive" (8.396-99). A little</page><page sequence="11">88 JUPITER IN OVID'S METAMORPHOSES attention from his wife makes even the cowed and cautious smith-god of Homer ready to defy the absolute powers of the universe. Virgil is adapting Iliad 18.462-67 but radically changes the tone by adding the marital bond and the sexual reward. This passage is perhaps the closest Virgil ever comes to something like Ovidian humor, but Virgil is writing about Vulcan, not Jupiter. Ovid adapts this kind of irreverent mood to Jupiter himself. Especially revealing here is the scene in Met. 14 in which Venus persuades Jupiter to deify Aeneas (14.581-95). Ovid here replaces the Virgilian triumph of Jupiter's stable order over the destabilizing wrath of Juno, with its implications for the political and cosmic order (Aen. 12.793-828), with a metamorphic narrative about the bird that rises from Turnus' city of Ardea (Met. 14.573-89). This narrowing of the Virgilian perspective continues in the fol lowing account of how Aeneas' virtus "compelled Juno to end her old wrath" (14.581). Personal apotheosis replaces the Aeneid's ending of the Latin war, the crucial step, on Italian soil, for the founding of the Roman imperium (Aen. 12.836-40). Ovid's Aeneas, now ripe for apotheosis (tem pestivus caelo) can enter Olympus. Yet Ovid treats even this potentially solemn moment with a light and delicate humor, as a beautiful daughter inveigles a doting father, after the man ner of the Odyssey's treatment of Nausicaa and Alcinous. Ovid is playing with another Virgilian model, the Jupiter-Venus scene of Aeneid 1, to which I have already referred. Virgil's Jupiter, even in this gentler, more intimate moment, is still the god of the remote cosmic order, for he shows "the countenance with which he calms the heavens and the storms" (vultu quo caelum tempestatesque serenat, Aen. 1.255). I* ls he, moreover, not Venus, who does the embracing, so that he is the one who controls the emotions of the situation. In Ovid, by contrast, Venus controls the scene through her exploitation of her charm. Ovid's circumfusa (poured around, embracing) in 14.586 also reminds us of the seductive Venus of Aeneid 8 and behind her of the Venus of Lucretius 1, and so suggests this Jupiter's susceptibility to feminine flattery. The Augustan solemnity of this moment in book 14 is sig</page><page sequence="12">Charles Segal 89 naled by the purgation of the residues of Aeneas' mortality in the following lines (14.600-1), for which the model is Her cules' apotheosis in book 9. In Metamorphoses 14, however, Venus subverts the grandeur of the Julian apotheosis not only in her seductive manner but also in the humorous modesty of her request for even "a small divinity (quamvis parvum des), as long as you give him some sort of divinity" (589-90). She is like a petty office-seeker in the house of an important offi cial, an impression fostered by the phrase ambieratque Venus in 585 ("and Venus made the rounds"), which suggests polit ical solicitation.21 She further trivializes the situation by point ing out that Aeneas has made Jupiter a grandfather (588-89)? not a particular distinction, given the Ovidian Jupiter's pro miscuity (cf. 6.176). Hercules and Aeneas are perhaps at a safe enough distance from Augustus himself to permit the lighter tone. But Ovid is on more delicate ground when he comes to the apotheosis of Julius Caesar in 15.745-59.22 Early in the poem he intro duced this theme, in a simile, alluding to the world's dismay at the attempted assassination of the princeps at the begin ning of book 1 (200-6), where he addressed Augustus by name (204) and compared his authority and the pietas that he inspires with that of Jupiter. 23 The end of book 15 now makes this event a major narrative episode and then goes on to describe the sidus lulium, the comet that appeared at Julius' death and is closely connected with his deification. So far so good. But Ovid moves into a more sensitive area with the following claim that of all Caesar's achievements none was greater than fathering Augustus (15.750-61 ).24 This might pass as the normal hyperbole of the panegyrical style; but Ovid's grandiose geographical terms and elaborate peri od culminate in quam tantum genuisse uirum, "than to have sired so great a man" (758). Caesar, of course, did not "sire" Augustus but adopted him. Ovid might have left matters with the more tactfully vague pater exstitit huius a few lines before (15.751, "emerged as his father"). Instead, his insis tence on biological generation in genuisse, "begot," rein forced by the reference to "mortal seed" (mortali semine) in</page><page sequence="13">90 JUPITER IN OVID'S METAMORPHOSES the following lines (760-61), comes dangerously close to par odying the whole topos of the divinization of the imperial line.25 Ovid does not let up even here. Venus, in alarm, appeals to Jupiter in another replay of the father-daughter scene of Aeneid 1. Jupiter is here the lofty Virgilian deity, concerned with universal peace, empire, and the irrevocable decrees of destiny (15.830-42). His reply to Venus has the dignity of the Virgilian Jupiter's reply to Juno in the last speech of the Aeneid (12.793-95). Yet, like a contemporary Roman offi cial proud of his efficiency, he invites Venus into the archives (tabular?a) and shows her the brass tablets on which are inscribed the future deeds of the Julian line.26 His prophecy of the coming era of peace includes Augustus's fostering of high moral standards by his own example (exemploque suo mores reget, 834). Ovid is comfortably within the limits of familiar praise of Augustus' moral program, and he is draw ing on the Virgilian Jupiter's famous prophecy of the Augus tan Golden Age in Aeneid 1.286-96. In this happy state of benign government, Ovid's Augustus will "look forward to the offspring born from his revered wife" (prospiciens pro lem sancta de coniuge natam), and he "will tell that offspring to take on both his name and his responsibilities" (15.836-37). Ovid is referring to Augustus' adoption of Tiberius; and the lines reflect the official language and titles.27 Tiberius, like his brother, Claudius Drusus, who was the designated successor before he died in 9 BCE, was the son of Livia and Tiberius Claudius Nero, not Augustus. Ovid is suitably brief and vague, but his emphasis on biological generation (prolem, natam), as in the case of Julius Caesar, might have been circumspectly avoided. Ovid follows up the apotheosis of Caesar with Augustus's reluctant superiority to his father (which involves another comparison of Augustus to Jupiter, Saturn yielding to Jove). Ovid then expresses the tactful wish that the day of his admission to the heavens as a god will be far off. Needless to say, Ovid is operating with (and on) a quasi-mythical appa ratus that has become part of a semi-official ideology.28 As</page><page sequence="14">Charles Segal 91 Alessandro Barchiesi points out, however, the princeps' trans lation to the heavens might seem innocuous for Virgil or Horace a generation earlier (G. 1.24-42), but would be less than welcome to the aging Augustus now, especially as Ovid reminds us that this penultimate metamorphosis of his poem will entail the emperor's "absence" from the mortal world (1.87o).2? Ovid then undercuts all these conventional eulo gies by his closing claim that his work can resist even "the anger of Jupiter" (15.871-76). In predicting here the eternal survival of his opus, Ovid recalls Jupiter's account of the bronze tablets on which is inscribed the destiny of Venus' descendants: iamque opus ex egi, quod nee lovis ira nee ignes I nee poterit ferrum nee edax abolere uetustas (15.871-72, "Now I have completed a work which neither Jupiter's wrath nor fire nor iron nor devouring old age will destroy"); . . . tabularia . . . I quae neque con cussum caeli nee fulminis ham I nee metuunt ullas tuta atque aeterna ruinas (15.810-12, "the archives . . . which in their security and eternity fear neither the shaking of the heavens nor the anger of the thunderbolt nor any other collapse").3? Through these echoes of sentence structure and diction (in cluding perennis in 813 and 875), Ovid appropriates for him self both the prophetic voice of Jupiter and the immortality that the Virgilian machinery of the fata promises to the Julian line. Instead of predicting the apotheosis of Julius, he predicts his own apotheosis through the immortality of his work. Just as the apotheoses of Hercules, Aeneas, and Julius involve the separation of the mortal, corporeal part from the immortal "better part," so the poet's apotheosis means the end of his corporeal life but the survival of his "better part" in the im mortal fame of his work (parte tarnen meliore mei, 15.875). The first-person prediction of this apotheosis makes even more striking Ovid's shift to himself and his poem. It is as if the poet's own personal voice has now acquired sufficient authority to defy "Jupiter's anger" on the one hand and to claim his immortalizing, prophetic power on the other. The "anger of Jupiter" recurs repeatedly in the Tristia to describe the emperor who banished him to Tomis; and, as many have</page><page sequence="15">92 JUPITER IN OVID'S METAMORPHOSES suggested, an allusion to Augustus as Jupiter in these closing lines of the Metamorphoses seems probable, given the strong parallels between Jupiter and Augustus less than twenty lines earlier (858-6o).3* Venus saved the soul of Julius from dissolving into the air and "placed it among the heavenly stars" (caelestibus intulit astris, 15.846). The immortalized poet, however, will be "car ried above the lofty stars in his immortality" (super alta perennis I astra ferar, 875-76). Once more, the statement has a confident, first-person form, with no divinity specified. "That day" of Augustus' apotheosis, ilia dies, which, Ovid prays, may be slow in coming (868), will also bring the poet's immortalization (873), and the parallel again overlays impe rial with poetic apotheosis. Augustus might not be pleased at the suggestion that Ovid rides into immortality on his coat tails (or the toga-equivalent). How conscious was Ovid of his unflattering portrait of Jupiter? Two familiar passages show Ovid calling attention to his own poetic activity in programmatically undercutting the solemn, moral Jupiter of the Odyssean-Aeschylean-Vir gilian tradition. First, the tapestry of Arachne in book 6 begins with a list of Jupiter's metamorphoses, including bull, swan, satyr, mortal, gold, and river, as part of his amorous adventures (6.io3-i4).32 The first item in the list is Europa, whose story Ovid/narrator told in his own voice at the end of book 2, so that Ovid is self-referentially harking back to his own poem. This artistic depiction of caelestia crimina (6.131, "the heavenly crimes"), as has often been observed, challenges Minerva's symmetrical depiction of Augustan so lemnity (augusta gravitate) centered on Jupiter (6.72-73). This vignette harks back to that first Olympian scene in book 1, where the "gods above sit in their marble retreat" and Jupiter himself on high leans on his ivory scepter" (1.177-78) as he shakes his fear-inspiring hair. In the Europa episode, as we have noted, Jupiter abandons the gravitas of that scepter in relinquishing maiestas for amor (sceptri gravitate relicta, 2.847). m book 2 Jupiter's tauriform wooing was a particu lar object of light humor. Here in book 6 Minerva horribly</page><page sequence="16">Charles Segal 93 punishes Arachne for these scandalous scenes, but the god dess has in fact been defeated in artistry and is a sore loser (6.130-31 ). If one wants to push further this hint of identifi cation between Ovid and the hapless but victorious spinner of tales, one might see Ovid's criticism of Minerva's vengeful anger as an anticipation of his own epilogue's defiance of "Ju piter's anger. "33 My second passage is Orpheus' invocation to Jupiter as the supreme deity at the beginning of his song in 10.148. Every thing, Orpheus says, yields to Jupiter's realm. He has sung of Jupiter's power often on previous occasions, Orpheus says; and Orpheus goes on to mention the gigantomachy, the high est register of poetry (cf. Horace, C. 3.4). Now, however, he needs a "lighter lyre" for his erotic themes, boys beloved by gods and girls' illicit passions. The deflating movement is exactly the opposite of that of Horace, Odes 3.3, who, after seventy lines of high political themes concludes, 3.3.69-72: non hoc iocosae conveniet lyrae: quo, Musa, tendis? desine pervicax referre sermones deorum et magna modis tenuare parvis. All this is not suited to the playful lyre. Where, O Muse, are you heading? Bold creature, stop reporting the talk of gods and slim down your grand themes to small measures. Horace does in fact celebrate those grand Augustan themes of political and cosmic order (as he does at even greater length in C. 3.4) and pulls back to his lighter mode only at the end. Ovid makes a point of replacing Jovian seriousness with the Jovian levity of sexual appetite and marital conflicts familiar from the early books of the poem (cf. Juno's discontent with Ganymede's presence on Olympus, 10.161, cited above). We need not assume an identification of Ovid with Orpheus any more than with Arachne. Yet in both these passages a pro grammatic statement about the writing of poetry takes the form of putting Jupiter into undignified postures. At the very least Arachne and Orpheus are anti-Virgilian and anti-Jovian</page><page sequence="17">94 JUPITER IN OVID'S METAMORPHOSES voices, and these resonate in different forms throughout the poem. It would, of course, be mistaken to attribute to Ovid any systematic anti-Augustan program. It would have been dan gerous as well as futile to mount a direct attack on Augustus' social and cultural policies; and it is doubtful that Ovid would even think of his work in such terms.34 Whatever Ovid's per sonal feelings, the parallels between Jupiter and Augustus are intended as flattery, not as attack (see 15.855-60); and Ovid follows in the tradition of Virgil in identifying the future glory of Rome with Augustus' Julian gens (see 15.446-51).35 Yet when he comes to portray the highest of the Olympians, even when he develops the parallels with Augustus, he is un able to envisage a divine governance of the world that could combine omnipotence, justice, and consistent moral order. Jupiter-bashing had been good fun ever since the Iliad. Unfortunately for Ovid, Virgil and Horace, strong poets in Harold Bloom's sense,36 had created a Jupiter that, one may hazard, had a particular appeal to Augustus and was encour aged in public representations.37 In 8 CE, after nearly a quar ter-century of being "Augustus," the princeps was not in a mood to be playful, especially where images of authority, moral order, and the descent and divinization of the emperor were concerned. 38 For all the anguish of his exile, however, Ovid had his revenge and in his epilogue perhaps even claims his posthumous triumph in his defiance of "Jove's anger."39 In the second half of the poem Jupiter's role as a god of a stable political order grows stronger, as is clear from his importance in the apotheosis of Hercules in book 9 and of Aeneas, Romulus, Caesar, and Augustus in books 14 and 15. But the Metamorphoses depicts the precariousness rather than the stability of the world order and displays multiple and divided points of view rather than a unitary vision. In the epic tradition, from the Iliad to the Aeneid, Jupiter has the fullest and most powerful potential for a unified and unify ing vision of the cosmic order; and so it is inevitable that he should play a major role in Ovid's deconstruction of that vision. Like all of Ovid's gods, he is both an agent and a sym</page><page sequence="18">Charles Segal 95 bolic expression of the poem's divided perspectives and shift ing levels of style. In the competing art-works of the Pi?rides and Muses in book 5 and of Arachne and Minerva in book 6 Ovid presents a microcosm of his poem's radically conflicting views of the gods;4? and Jupiter, father of gods and men, is repeatedly at the center of these contradictions. He can stave off cosmic catastrophe and maintain order and equilibrium, as he does when he destroys the Giants or checks Phaethon's wild ride through the heavens. But he is also the most powerful exem plar of divinities who bring chaos, exercise arbitrary vio lence, and selfishly violate the rights and dignity of those whom they govern. The abrupt shift from his concern with the "vast walls of the heavens" to his rape of Callisto in the space of ten lines (2.401-10) is a miniature enactment of the contradictions between the respective pictures of the gods in each of the two ecphrastic contests of books 5 and 6 (Pi?rides and Muses, Arachne and Minerva). It would be a serious mis reading of Ovid to regard such contrasts as an expression of a systematic political ideology. His epilogue, however, asserts the poem's ability to survive its own darkest images of wrath ful, destructive gods and ultimately to triumph over the often chaotic, hostile, and even nightmarish world that those gods create. NOTES i. See, e.g., Dennis C. Feeney, The Gods in Epic (Oxford 1991), 151-55, with further references there. 2. On this much-discussed scene, with further references, see Feeney (note 1), 137-41. I do not mean to deny the incomplete and misleading side of Jupiter's prophecy here or the deceptiveness of his serene countenance, given the sufferings that await Aeneas and the future city of Rome: see J. J. O'Hara, Death and the Optimistic Prophecy in Vergil's Aeneid (Princeton 1990), 128-63, especially 135-36. 3.17. 1.397-406. Cf. also Met. 1.150-62. Ovid's Jupiter, however, in con trast to the Homeric Zeus, makes no mention of Thetis' help, despite the ref erence to Nereus immediately afterwards (1.187). On Thetis and the succes sion myth in Iliad 1 see Laura Slatkin, The Power of Thetis (Berkeley and Los Angeles 1991), 60-62.</page><page sequence="19">96 JUPITER IN OVID'S METAMORPHOSES 4- Thus we see the "serious" Jupiter in his intercession with Ceres in 5.512-32, in his role as god of strangers violated by the Cerastae in 10.224-26, and in his association with the decrees of the Fates in 15.830-42, to be discussed below. 5. Views on the degree of seriousness in the concilium deorum are divided between taking the scene at face value, as Ovid's bid for epic grandiosity, or seeing a lighter tone. For an overview of interpretations see Franz Borner, ed., P. Ovidius Naso, Metamorphosen Buch 1-3 (Heidelberg 1969), ad 1.163-252 (pages 74-75), who opts for the serious view.

K. Galinsky, Ovid's Metamor phoses: An Introduction to the Basic Aspects (Oxford 1975), 190-91. Ovid's Palatia caeli in 1.176 may be a humorous glance at Virgil's regia caeli in G. 1.503-4, a passage that Ovid perhaps has in mind generally in his ref erence to the assassination of Caesar (whether Julius or Augustus) soon afterwards (1.200-2, and cf. 1.200), manus impia saevit ("the impious hand raged") G. 1.511, saevit Mars toto impius orbe ("impious Mars raged over the whole world"). 6.

(Cambridge 1970), 104-7, and Otto Steen Due, Chang ing Forms (Copenhagen 1974), 114-17; but neither pays sufficient attention to the brutality of 1.600. 8. The reference to Arcadia in both passages, along with Callisto's descent from Lycaon, also links the Phaethon episode and the aftermath of the Cre ation in book 1.

Sic uisum superis in 1.366 (so it seemed best to the gods) is a possible echo of the rather more probing theology of the Aeneid (e.g. Aen. 2.428, 2.659, 3.2, 12.647). The trivial and inconsequential saeua ira (savage anger) of Cupid soon after, in 1.453, sets ?fftne destructiveness of Jupiter's ira. In 6.262-64 one of the Niobids' mistaken appeal to all the gods, rather than to the one who is causing the slaughter, adds to the pathos. 19. See my "Ovid's Arcadia" (note 12), 410-11. 20.

Lateiner, "Mythic and Non-Mythic Artists in Ovid's Metamor phoses," Ramus 13 (1984), 7 observes that apotheosis is not particularly privileged in the world of the Metamorphoses, granted as it is, e.g., to Cal listo and Ino, among others (2.505-7, 4.536-38). Feeney (note 1), 213-14 points out the contrast between Virgil's concern with the whole Roman peo ple in Aen. 1.257-58 and Venus' concern with the fate of Julius Caesar as an individual in Met. 15.814. For a much more positive view of this motif see L. B. Wickkiser, "Famous Last Words: Putting Ovid's Sphragis Back into the Metamorphoses," MD 42 (1999), 137-38 Wickkiser highlights the importance of succession from Julius Caesar to Augustus via the precedents and parallels in the poem but does not seem to me to deal adequately with the tone of Ovid's treatment. 23. Although some have thought the reference in 1.200-5 to De to Julius rather than Augustus Caesar, the latter is more probable: see Borner (note 16), ad loc. (page 87), and also Anderson (note 16), ad loc. 24. For the probable irony here see Due (note 6), 86; Garth Tissol, The Face of Nature (Princeton 1997), 188-89.

In fact, Barchiesi, Il poeta (note 29), 265-66, finds verbal confirma tion of this association in the fact that Ovid uses the phrase rupit opus in Trist. 1.7.13-14 and 2.549-52 to describe his destruction of the Meta morphoses and part of the Fasti, evoking Minerva's rupit pictas, caelestia crimina, vestes in the Arachne episode (Met. 6.131), as another parallel between mythical divine ira and Ovid's harsh treatment from Augustus. 34. Barchiesi, II poeta (note 29), ix-xi, 277-78, points out that Augustus himself had politicized the areas of art and culture and in this totalizing world-view deviations, even (or especially) when witty and humorous, could appear suspect; see also my "Ovid's Arcadia" (note 12), 411. Ovid may have added more ironical jabs at Augustus as it became clear that his exile would not be revoked, and possibly after Augustus' death: see M?ller (note 5), 287 and also 282-83, apropos 15.750-51 and 758.
