Literature of all kinds provides a medium of enrichment for science learnings. Science supplies the information and a systematic order of things. We have explored ways to exploit this logical relationship. To do so, we have selected three of the nine basic conceptual themes of the biological sciences as identified by the Biological Sciences Curriculum Study 1 and examined ways that these three themes are revealed in good children's literature. The conceptual themes chosen are: (1) change through time, (2) diversity of type and unity of pat- tern in living things, and (3) the complementary relationship be- tween organism and environment. Many variations on these themes are found in nature and reflected in stories and poems for children. Change The first theme, change, is an underlying theme in many children's books and may occur as growth, season-related adaptations of plants and animals, or physical alterations in the surface of the Earth. Change in living things can range from the dramatic metamorphosis of but- terflies to the subtle evolutionary adaptation of organisms. Change in NOTE: The graduate students in Early Childhood Education at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill made valuable contributions to this article. the surface of the Earth can range from the vivid effects of a violent storm to the gradual erosion of rock by wind and water. Children relate best to changes that affect them directly and that are easily observed and recorded. Growth, one variation of change, is an underlying concept and central problem in Lynn Ward's Caldecott Award winning book The Biggest Bear.2 A young boy, Johnny, finds a bear cub in the woods. As the bear grows, his size and inquisitive behavior become a significant prob- lem for a small mountain communi- ty. Dramatic changes in the size of the bear, followed by his change in behavior, are revealed in the ex- cellent illustrations. Other books dealing with the growth theme can be read; children can bring pictures of themselves to school showing their progress or they can observe the growth of animals. Seasonal variation is the theme of The Big Snow. 3 The coming of winter and its effect on the lives of woodland animals is the major focus of this book. Wild geese flying south, hibernation, and food storage are some of the season- 1 Biological Sciences Curriculum Study. Teacher's Guide, High School Biology, Green Version.

This book would be particularly ap- propriate to share with children in the fall when colored leaves fall on the playground and squirrels scurry about storing a few last nuts for the long winter ahead. Develop the theme further by reading similar books or by observing the effects of seasonal change on local plants and animals. Physical alterations in the surface of the Earth, a third variation of change, is an important concept in A Time of Wonder . Beautifully written passages about a coastal storm and changes which surround its passage provide opportunities to explore the effects of wind and water on the environment. Author Robert McCloskey describes some of these changes: And out-of-doors in the gentle morn- ing lie reminders of yesterday's hur- ricane. Fallen and broken trees are everywhere - on the terrace, on the path - blocking your way at every turn. You cannot walk on familiar paths and trails, but you can explore the tops of giant fallen trees, and walk on trunks and limbs where no one ever walked before. 4 Children can observe similar changes during a walk shortly after a heavy rain or storm. More subtle physical changes are evident in the weathered rocks that children col- lect. Diversity and Unity The second major conceptual theme, diversity of type and unity of pattern in living things, can be a focus for relating science and literature. Even the youngest child can observe likenesses and dif- ferences in living things. Unity of pattern is apparent in animals, yet in other ways the diversity of type is in- finite. As the child matures, these simple observations of likenesses and differences will become more sophisticated and eventually serve as a basis for formal scientific classification. The classic rhyme Over in the Meadow shows a variety of com- mon woodland animals in their natural setting and thus provides an opportunity for teachers to help children identify similarities and dif- ferences. The appealing poetic pat- tern for the book is established in the first stanza Over in the meadow, in the sand, in the sun, Lived an old mother turtle and her little turtle one.5 Many classrooms house pet mice, fish, birds, gerbils, or plants which can also be compared on the basis of likenesses and differences. Once children understand the pattern, they will enjoy applying their new classification skills to a variety of plants and animals in books, or in the environment. Relationship to Surroundings The third conceptual theme, the complementary relationship be- tween organism and environment, is a concept appropriate for young children yet directly related to more complex ecological understandings. Plants and animals affect, and are affected by, their surroundings. The squirrel's instinct to bury a portion of the nuts it collects is a natural mechanism by which trees are often planted. The Beaver Pond examines the effect of a beaver-constructed pond upon the lives and the environ- ment of other animals in a northern woodland setting: the author has a complex ecological community described in simple terms. The at- traction of the pond for a variety of animals is described in the following passage: It didn't matter to the beavers who used their pond. There was room for everyone, and the beavers were too busy fixing the dam and repairing their houses and raising their babies to notice their neighbors . . . Frogs and fishes, turtles and hovering dragonflies enjoyed its waters. Red- winged blackbirds nestled in its rushes, and ducks paraded their new babies proudly. And in the cool eve- ning light the mother deer brought their young ones to the edge of the pond to drink. 6 These kinds of interactions result in the maintenance of vital ecosystems. Similar interactions between animals (including man) and the en- vironment can be observed by children in most communities. The themes and the examples we have presented are certainly not the only ones appropriate for classroom use. Teachers may want to identify conceptual themes and related books which have personal meaning to them and the children with whom they work. Adaptation, interrela- tionships between the structure and function of living things, and reproduction are a few examples. Ideas for additional concepts may be drawn from children's science texts, model programs, curriculum guides, or the teacher's own understanding of science cur- riculum. Select Good Books Many of the books teachers most frequently read to children are ideal for enriching science understand- ings. We have found that books which are most effective for relating science and literature include two important qualities. First, the books must be well-written and well- illustrated. Caldecott Award-win- ning books are obvious favorites. Second, the books must clearly reflect the author's sensitivity to patterns in nature, thus illustrating conceptual themes to which children can easily relate. 7 Strategies Results of our exploratory efforts in reading books to young children suggest several teaching strategies which seem to enhance children's enjoyment and understanding. If we asked questions prior to reading, the children's attention focused on the selected concept, while reading the story allowed children the pleasure of experiencing good literature. During the introduction and story reading, we asked children ques- tions directly related to the content of the story. Later, the children discussed the story in greater detail 4 McClostey, R.

Young children may have difficulty differentiating between the natural behavior of animals and those human-like characteristics sometimes attributed to them by authors. Animals may go south for the winter, as part of their normal behavior, but they do not discuss it. The use of anthropomorphism as a literary technique need not prevent the use of an otherwise appropriate book. Teachers who are sensitive to the nature of children's thought may use such books to help children distinguish the real from the imag- inative. Tapes of listening experiences based on our approach revealed an unexpected variety of responses. The children reacted with en- thusiasm, relating their own ex- perience to the science themes, sug- gesting additional books, and par- ticipating in related science and language arts activities. The children were able to identify science-related themes in the books read to them, and when asked to ap- ply generalizations, cited a wide variety of examples from personal experience and their environment.
