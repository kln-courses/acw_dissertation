<plain_text><page sequence="1">Sen'trees' of Mumbai. S. B. Chaphekar, C. S. Lattoo and Mugdha Karnik (eds). Centre for Extra-Mural Studies, Univer sity of Mumbai, Supported by ONGC. 2007. 304 pp. Price: Rs 2000. When environmental problems linked to the declining green mantle are proving menacing to life on our planet, the re lease of the book under review by the Hon'ble Minister of Petroleum, Murli Deora is timely. The publication pre sented by the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Mumbai, Vijay Khole, on the occasion of the sesquicentennial year of the university provides a fresh ap proach to the arboreal sentinels of the metropolis. The genesis of the book lies in a course on 'tree appreciation' organ ized by the university under the leader ship of S. B. Chaphekar. No claim is laid on covering all the ligneous species. Ex cluded are some showy flower-bearers, fruit trees, teak - the king of the forest and exotics like Eucalyptus and wattles. Included are over 100 species that have caught the fancy of the participants of the course for their sheer beauty and their cultural, historical, religious, liter ary and scientific significance. Over 40 authors, among them eminent botanists, have contributed as many chapters. Beautiful photographs, a few (19) without description, enhance the value of the publication. The title is apt: Sen'trees', a pun, is a tribute to the greenery around us, to the lifeguards that shower upon us their generous bounty: lungs of the city that generate oxygen, sequestrate C02, indicate and reduce pollution, control micro-climate, contribute to water cycle and storage, check erosion and bestow on us myriad benefits. The Sen'trees' are thus our saviours in the Homo sapiens dominated ecosystems in a new geolo gical era termed 'Anthropocene'. Valuable information is included for a majority of species on world distribution, migratory routes in some cases, mean CURRENT SCIENCE, VOL. 93, NO. 9, 10 NOVEMBER 2007</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS ings of Latin and vernacular names, econo mic and medicinal uses since earlier times with references to the Mahabharata, Ramayana, Charak Samhita (500 BC), Sushrut Samhita (AD 300), mythological anecdotes and localities in Mumbai where the trees stand. The derivation of botanical names makes interesting reading; to cite a few: Areca catechu - Areca could have come from Kannada 'Adaka' and catechu could be with reference to the chewing action. Tamarindus is derived from the Arabic Tamar-e-Hind (Indian date). Azadirachta has its roots in Azae-darakht, terms used by the Iranian travellers meaning good health at no cost. Etymology of the monocarpic Corypha is traced to Malaya lam Kodapanam, i.e. umbrella palm. Its abundance in Kerala has reportedly earned it the title of God's own country. Calophyllum inophyllum means a tree made beautiful because of its veined leaves: Calo = beautiful, phyllum = leaves and ino = veins. Mice-killer Gliricidia has roots in gliris (mice) and caedo (killer). In the first chapter on the 'Princes of the plant kingdom' - the palms, Marselin Almeida presents a wealth of information on ten species. The chapter on mangroves points out the worsening scenario and shrinkage in the area of what was once the dominant element in the seven islands that the city originally was. The silver lining is the Mangrove Park project launched by the company Godrej under the guidance of Chaphekar. Given the paucity of mangrove species, what may be suggested is the creation of a Man grove Arboretum within the framework or the Park project, with introduction of mangals from other parts of India (e.g. Nypa and Heritiera from the Sunder bans) and other warm countries. For the massive Adansonia, C. S. Lattoo has col lected voluminous data; the huge, hollow trunk could accommodate 30 persons, an African tribe buries its dead in the tree. Missing is the Indian legend that robbers used to hide inside the trunk during day time and commit robberies at night. Hence the Gujarati name 'Chor-Amlo', the robbers' tamarind. Two candidates contest for the title of the oldest living tree: A specimen of Adansonia claiming to be 6000 years old is challenged by a bristle cone (not care) pine, 5000 years of age. Among such other fascinating points of interest in the book figures the mythological significance of planting Couropita around Shiva temples; to the devotees its flower represents the image of the Lord as 'linga', sun-shaded by the hood of the 'naga'. In the case of the rain tree (Samanea), the rain is not a water shower but the excreta of certain insects inhabiting the tree. The heavy, hanging fruits of Kigelia could provide a novel idea for the Motor Vehicles Department! Incidents of these fruits making dents on cars parked underneath the tree, suggest planting of Kigelia trees in no-parking zones. The reviewer is reminded of a query from an eminent lawyer: 'Why is it that there is not a single police or court case of a coconut falling from a height of 25 m on someone's head, grievously injur ing him?' Though I did not find mention of this curious fact in the chapter on palms, the reason may be that the nuts are collected before maturity or that the fruit-fall occurs during night-time. A glar ing omission is the mention of a special coconut day celebrated in Maharashtra; probably to thank the ocean currents that brought the fruit to our shores. On this occasion coconuts are offered as return gifts to the sea. On Pongamia, the author is silent on the use of its seeds as bio diesel. A matter of inconvenience is that the species are listed neither in alphabetical order nor according to an accepted taxo nomic system. The family Sterculiaceae is separated into four groups, Sterculia foetida (p. 138), S. urens (p. 287), Fir miana (p. 285), Pterospermum (p. 269). Mimusops (p. 78) and Manilkara (p. 260) are treated in different chapters, though earlier the latter was placed in the genus Mimusops. The reason for this discrep ancy is the choice given to the authors to deal with trees of his/her liking. The photo plates show the same trends: Diospyros malabarica (p. 14) deserved a place near D. embryopteris (p. 172), Lannea (p. 144; Anacardiaceae) near Mangifera (p. 66), Haldina (p. 6; Rubiaceae) near Neola markia and Mitragyna (pp. 146, 147). The language used is at times too poetic. I, for one, prefer plain English. Also there are several anthropomorphic expres sions. For example, on p. 27, there is a reference to 'Strangulating Ficus', an oft repeated textbook statement. The banyan seed germinating on the palmyra trunk develops roots that clasp the palm for support. But do they really choke the host with the intension of killing it? 'Ad venturous traveller' (p. 175), 'Born in' instead of the country of origin, 'Living happily', 'Obesity' in the baobab, and the 'Ghost tree' Sterculia urens are few more examples. Likewise the noteworthy distribution of the Doum (Dome) palm Hyphaene dichotoma is not discussed. Like the Gir (Kathiawar) lion, this palm too has almost endemic status in Diu, an erstwhile Portugese enclave in Kathiawar. Given the concentration of the genus Hy phaene in Angola, also a past Portugese colony in Africa, indigenous or intro duced occurrence since earlier times would be a good subject for historical and palaeo-palynological research. Errors are few. Peltophorum (p. 87) bears the heading Pterocarpus indicus. Saraca asoka plate is on p. 126 and not on p. 116 as indicated in the photo-index. 'Deciduation (p. 201) is not a well-recog nized term for leaf-shedding. An appendix of vernacular names with the correspond ing botanical names would have helped readers not familiar with the local lan guage. One would have also appreciated a map showing major localities. The price is on the higher side for students to afford a copy. Anyway, it is a useful ref erence book which universities, institutes and college libraries should have. For the budding botanists it would be a good guide to know the trees and their loca tion. The publication is, however, essen tially addressed to tree-lovers; not only Mumbaiites but also to those residing in other cities and towns who would enjoy reading it-a veritable collector's item for those interested in plant-life, ecology, and the very history of the metropolis.
