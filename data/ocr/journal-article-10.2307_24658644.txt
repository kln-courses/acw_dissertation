<plain_text><page sequence="1">Noise at the Threshold CHRISTOPHER FYNSK State University of New York at Binghamton I will be focusing my remarks primarily on the first essay in Heidegger's Unterwegs zur Sprache, "Die Sprache" ("Language"),1 and thus on an essay devoted not to Hölderlin's poetry, but rather to a poem by Trakl. I will want to suggest, however, that Heidegger's reading of Τrakl's A Winter Evening constructs a kind of allegory concerning poetic language. It follows from such a hypothesis (and this would be the case even if the last words of Trakl's poem were not "bread and wine") that Heidegger's reading of Hölderlin plays a major role in the essay. "Language" is an exemplary essay for Heidegger's approach to the question of language (and specifically poetic language). It offers a general statement about poetry within the framework of the dialogue between thought and poetry that Heidegger pursues throughout On the Way to Lan guage. But it is also distinctive for the fact that it points overtly to what I take to be Heidegger's key difficulty in his descriptions of the relation between human speech and what he calls the speaking of language: namely, that human speech introduces into this speaking what I will call "noise." My aim in this paper will be to bring this difficulty forth by offering a brief reading of "Language." I will then try to pursue the questions raised by this essay by turning to another passage in On the Way to Language (this one addressed to verses by Hölderlin) and finally to lines by Hölderlin that offer a singular challenge to Heidegger's claims for poetic language by pointing to a source of "noise" that Heidegger does not seem to hear. Heidegger begins his essay by proposing to invert the traditional approach to language. He proposes to think it not in relation to humankind, as has been done throughout the tradition, but in itself, and to think humankind, in 101</page><page sequence="2">102 CHRISTOPHER FYNSK turn, from its basis. This means abandoning the traditional armature of concepts about language which Heidegger summarizes in three basic no tions: that language would be a means of expression of thought and feelings; that language would be a form of human activity by which humankind makes itself, or makes a world for itself; that it would be a representation of what is (whether real or imagined). But the inversion Heidegger proposes actually requires more than the abandonment of these concepts; it requires, to a certain extent, the abandon ment of the concept itself, if we understand by this the representation of the essence of a thing, in this case language. For as soon as we arrogate the right to represent to ourselves the essence of language, we posit a relation between it and human knowing, and refer language back to humankind; we posit language as an object for a subject capable of representing that object in its essence. Some combination of the three traditional notions of language is inescapable if we proceed within the structure of representation. So Heideg ger finally invites us not only to avoid the traditional understanding of language as a means of representation; he invites us to avoid positing language itself as the object of representation. We are to think language from out of itself—proceeding from language and not approaching language from our position as theoretical subjects. To approach language in itself, he suggests, we must ask how language is as language or comes about as language. Heidegger's response to this question comes immediately in his essay. Language is language, he says, and he explicates this apparently tautological phrase by asserting that language speaks. So to follow language in thought, die Sprache nachdenken, to think after language (in the sense of the phrase, "after the fashion of") is to engage with the speaking of language. Thought must allow language to speak; and this means that the language of thought must answer to language. Only when thought reveals itself as answering to the essence of language will the inversion Heidegger is seeking be achieved. But on what grounds can Heidegger affirm that his own answer to the question of how language is as language answers to the essence of language and is not merely another concept for language? How can he know that he is answering to language when he insists that language speaks? Heidegger himself raises the problem just as quickly as he gave his answer. He writes: "Is this, seriously, an answer? Presumably [Vermutlich: I have tried to demonstrate elsewhere that the essential mode of thoughtful saying as it replies to language is one of "presumption," so this word is not falling here by accident2] . . . Presumably it already is—that is, when it becomes clear what speaking is" (PLT, 190). So Heidegger's proposition, that language speaks, will reveal itself as having answered to the essence of language once we know what it means to speak. The thesis itself will become meaningful, it</page><page sequence="3">NOISE A Τ THE THRESHOLD 103 will speak, once we know what speaking is. It will reveal itself then as a reply to language; for as Heidegger asserts near the end of his essay, a language that answers to the speaking of language counters language or works by rejoinder: it is entgegnende. As such, it draws out a distance that makes it possible to think about language or to think after language—but without turning language into an object, a Gegenstand. (I will return to the question of the nature of the countering reply.) Heidegger's answer, Die Sprache spncht will reveal itself as answering to language, then, once we know what speaking is, and the question of course immediately follows: How do we recognize the speaking of language? Where do we find it? Heidegger again answers with a series of propositions or theses that are strongly marked as such by their clipped quality, and by the way they follow one after another. The last is described as a naked assertion [nackte Behauptung]—and the epithet in fact applies to each of them. There are at least four (depending on how closely we consider them): 1) The speaking of language is found in what is spoken (das Gesprochene). 2) The speaking of language accomplishes itself in the spoken and is sheltered there; its speaking does not cease in the spoken, but rather gathers there the manner in which it continues to unfold in its essence—that is to say, it gathers or orders the movement of its becoming-speech in the spoken. 3) The spoken is pure (and most suitable for our attention in meditating on language) when the speaking that accomplishes itself in it by composing itself there is originary or marks a beginning (eine anfangende ist). One will recognize this theme from "The Origin of the Work of Art," and so the fourth point, the one Heidegger termed a "naked assertion," will come as no surprise. 4) The purely spoken is the poem (das Gedicht). Now, we can let these assertions stand in their nakedness, Heidegger says, if we manage to hear the purely spoken in a poem. Once again, the proposition awaits its confirmation in a speaking. But to which poem are we to turn if we do not know what speaking is and how we are to listen for it? Heidegger responds that our choice and our hearing will not be unbound if we let ourselves be guided by what has been indicated to us (zugedacht) by the speaking of language when we follow it in thought. Heidegger's answer, Die Sprache spricht has already spoken and already bound our hearing. We are of course moving in a circle. Heidegger turned to the poem in order to make his answer concerning how language is sound as an answer. Heidegger now tells us that we will hear what is happening in the poem if we have heard the answer as an answer. Listening to the poem, he says, we will make a few steps toward understanding what is binding in the bond already created by our following language in thought (das Bündige jener Bindung). In other words, we will discover what makes Heidegger's answer conclusive. But Heidegger is doing more than punning here and doing more than</page><page sequence="4">104 CHRISTOPHER FYNSK turning in circles—and I would like to stress in this respect a point that has some bearing on his reading ofTrakl's poem. If Heidegger is underscoring so ostentatiously the specifically philosophical character of his approach, or to put this perhaps in more appropriate terms, if he calls special attention to the character of his own language as the language of thought (focusing first on the guiding phrase, then highlighting the assertive character of his proposi tions about poetic language), it is because he thinks that our only access to the speaking of language that is the source of thought as well as of poetry (though for each in a singular manner) is through the difference between poetry and thought. As Heidegger says elsewhere in On the Way to Language, each mode is blind to its own origin—it is only by remarking the difference between them that each can have access to itself as a site where language speaks. Each comes to itself, as a unique mode of saying, by way of the other. Thus it is probably misleading to speak in terms of a logical circle. We have to do rather with a play of juxtaposition or contrast, and, once again, a kind of countering since language and poetry, as Heidegger says elsewhere in the volume, stand gegenüber einander. The crucial point is that language gives itself as language, that is, as speaking, only by way of a kind of contrast, or countering, that is, in and through the difference between modes of speaking. We will see a related idea made in every essay in which Heidegger takes up the topic of language: that is to say, each time he has recourse to the dialogue between thought and poetry, or recourse to the concept of dialogue itself, as in his conversation with the Japanese student. We will also see it in his reading ofTrakl's poem, which works, he claims, by way of a differential structure. Let me turn now to Heidegger's reading of A Winter Evening. Heidegger claims that the three stanzas ofTrakl's poem each enact a different mode of saying in that they draw out successively the difference to which the poem as a whole answers (what Heidegger calls here the difference between world and thing). I will be focusing essentially on the third stanza, but I would like to summarize Heidegger's reading of the movement of the first two in order to suggest what Heidegger means when he says that this third stanza draws out the difference between the modes of speaking of the first two stanzas and thereby allows the speaking of difference to occur. It will also be necessary to move quickly through the poem in order to set up the terms of the allegory Heidegger reads in it.3 Heidegger initially approaches the poem by sketching a reading of it that would proceed from a notion of language as expressive and representational and would appeal to aesthetic categories in order to account for its particular beauty. But he then asserts that if, on the contrary, we listen to the poem with the proposition "Language speaks" in mind, we shall be aware of the inadequacy of this approach. The proposition, he says, gives a different</page><page sequence="5">NOISE A Τ THE THRESHOLD 105 measure with which to listen to the poem—a measure at once temporal and spatial provided by language itself. Accordingly, when Heidegger returns to the poem, he concentrates on the way in which the poem opens a site through its speaking. The first stanza speaks by naming, he says. It does not affix terms to familiar objects; rather, it brings things into what he describes as a presence sheltered by absence. This is a nearness and thus spatial in a certain sense, but it is a nearness marked by temporality. What the stanza names, Heidegger emphasizes, is the time of the winter evening. The snowfall makes things last longer, he says, and thus the vesper bell, which tolls daily for a strictly delimited time (streng begrenzte Zeit) tolls longer. "Strict time" may well point to Hölderlin—specifically to the Remarks on Oedipus and the Remarks on Antigone in which Hölderlin defines the modern relation to the divine in terms of a most severe historicity. Hölderlin will never be far off in this commentary. But my point in evoking Hölderlin at this point is to emphasize the temporal character of the measure (a presence sheltered in absence) to which the poem calls things, and to suggest one of the ways in which the measure cast by the poem defines the relation of things to the four compo nents of what Heidegger calls the world. The long tolling of the vesper bell brings men before the divine, Heidegger says, the snowfall brings men under the sky, the house and table join mortals to the earth. The naming of the first stanza, in other words, engages mortals with the other elements of what Heidegger calls the fourfold, and thus implicitly evokes the world, which is the unity of the four elements in their play. Thus by naming things, the first stanza already implicitly calls upon the world and is already beginning to draw out the measure of the relation of relations that is the relation between world and thing.4 The second stanza will unfold and remark in its turn what remains implicit in the first stanza. It will call up the world by addressing itself to mortals (this is how Heidegger initially interprets the reference to those who wander on dark courses), to the earth and the sky, and to the divine. I will not dwell over Heidegger's discussion here; I note simply that like the naming of the first stanza, the calling of the second is double, though it reverses the movement of the first. The first stanza brought things to their presence in the world; the second entrusts world to things. So the second stanza draws out the relation of world and thing implicit in the first stanza and remarks it in its distinct fashion of speaking by inverting it. Heidegger's justification for this claim (or even its precise meaning) concerns me less here than his insistence upon the difference in modes of speaking between the two stanzas. They differ as modes of speaking, Heidegger asserts, because they answer to the difference that exists between world and thing in their respec tive movements. By tracing out this difference in their very speaking (though only implicitly), they remark what I have referred to as the relation of</page><page sequence="6">106 CHRISTOPHER FYNSK relations, and what Heidegger also speaks of as the ontological difference.5 The third stanza will draw out explicitly this difference sketched out between the two stanzas. Before describing the distinctive mode of speaking of this third stanza, Heidegger pauses to develop a series of terms with which to describe the difference between world and thing traced out in the first two. He refers to it as a scission between the two terms, an Unterschied (dif-ference) that gathers them into a unity Heidegger describes with the Hölderlinian term, Innigkeit (intimacy). (Heidegger used the term in "The Origin of the Work of Art" to describe the relation between world and earth [PLT, 63]—and indeed he is describing the same event as the one he described in that essay: the happen ing of truth in a work of art—the opening of an open space in which everything that is can come into presence). Intimacy is defined in turn as the unity of what Heidegger calls the diaphora: a carrying apart of the terms it draws into a unity (again, world and thing) that does not mediate between these terms (vermitteln) in the sense that it would connect these already existent terms after the fact, but rather discovers these terms or dis-cerns them in an originary fashion (ermitteln). As such, the difference appropriates world and thing into their respective natures. The tracing out and unfolding of difference is Ereignis. And Heidegger finally adds that this difference cannot be thought as a relation or distinction (which would presuppose, again, already existent terms), but rather as a di-mension—a separation that measures out, ermisst. Ermessen implies decision or judgment, but we have to do here not with a judgment according to a previously established measure, but the original opening of a measure, an Entscheiden and Austragen that gives the measure by which it decisively separates and joins into a unity. Having defined in this manner the difference traced out by the modes of speaking of the first two stanzas, then, Heidegger turns to the third stanza and remarks that it speaks emphatically in its first verse, and then suddenly and strangely in its second. The second verse stands alone in the spoken of the poem, Heidegger says, because it is the only verse that is in the past tense. By evoking now his notion of the spoken, Heidegger calls us back to his initial propositions about the poem as the site of the purely spoken. In the spoken, he had said, the speaking of language does not cease, but rather gathers in its essence. Likewise, he argues here that this past tense does not name something that no longer is, but rather something that comes into its essence as already having been, that gathers or collects its essence in this way. It will turn out to be, as he said at the outset, the speaking of language, understood now as the tracing out of difference. Heidegger moves quickly and allusively here, but the steps he makes are essentially the following. He proposes pain as another term for difference. Pain tears asunder he says, it separates (the verb he uses here is reissen); but</page><page sequence="7">NOISE A Τ THE THRESHOLD 107 at the same time it draws together (auf sich zieht) what is rent, in the manner of an initial tracing out or sketch: Vorriss or Aufriss {PLT, p. 204). These are again terms that appeared in "The Origin of the Work of Art" to describe the difference traced out by the work as it joins together world and earth {PLT, 63). They are also the terms Heidegger uses to define the essence of language elsewhere in On the Way to Language. The tracing of the Riss, Heidegger argues in "The Essence of Language," is the speaking of language. Language speaks by drawing out, tracing out the differential articulation that Heidegger is thinking here as the difference between world and thing. So "pain" names the difference as traced out in the speaking of language. Why "pain"? To explicate this properly we would have to pursue the topic of the relation between language and death or suffering, which Heidegger has already evoked by defining the wanderers who travel on dark paths as mortals. Hölderlin, again, is an essential reference here.6 But there is also a connection that proceeds more immediately by the relays of language, and that is through the word pain itself. Heidegger is drawing upon the etymol ogy of the Greek word for pain, algos. It is related, as he suggests elsewhere, to the word alego, which comes from lego (to speak), and means, Heidegger says, intimate gathering.7 So the "pain" that hardens into stone in the threshold names the essence of language as a tracing out and gathering of the difference between world and thing. One more step must be added now to explain the allegory Heidegger is setting in place. Heidegger had argued in "The Origin of the Work of Art" that difference must be set up in the work and fixed there. It must be composed in the work's Gestalt, set into the outline or boundary of the work {PLT, 64). The threshold, as we can see, figures for Heidegger precisely this composing of the difference that is pain. It figures the work's form or boundary as that out of which the work itself comes to stand as the remarking of the event of the happening of truth. At another level, it is a figure for the poem itself as a site where the speaking of language is gathered and set out—it is an instance of the setting into work of truth of which Heidegger speaks in "The Origin of the Work of Art" (there is also a pun at work here around the word "dicht"—compact or dense). And in a larger sense, it is a figure of the threshold that is language itself, if language is defined as the articulation of difference by which difference comes about. Heidegger gives it this larger sense when he says it defines a relation between the inside and the outside, which he will come to define in the essay as a movement into difference from out of difference by which world and thing are appropriated to their essences. World and thing are only in and by their difference, thus to call upon world and thing as the poem does is to call upon their difference. But the calling of the poem traces out this difference, articulates it in an originary fashion. It unfolds the difference in such a way as to enfold world</page><page sequence="8">108 CHRISTOPHER FYNSK and thing into its intimacy. In this sense, the poem calls difference to itself as the intimate union of world and thing. It brings difference to speech, and as Heidegger will add in the conclusion of his reading, it brings about the speaking of difference as a silent order or command, a Ceheiss, that enjoins a disposition between word and thing to which all human speaking must answer and to which the poem itself will reveal itself as having answered. The logic of this argument can be dizzying, but it is really quite simple. What the poem does is call upon difference in the manner of a project that anticipates what it answers to. It brings difference to speak and thus to unfold as difference. Heidegger thinks this unfolding, once again, as an Austragen, an Ereignen, an Ermessen, an Eröffnen, and, finally, as a Sprechen that sounds as a silent Läuten. The poem answers to difference, but retraces it in such a fashion as to make it come about as a difference that joins world and thing into a simple intimacy and brings about the sheltering that is figured with the image of the house and the splendor of bread and wine which stand in simple sufficiency by virtue of the way they are gathered in the fourfold. The threshold, then, is language, as gathered in the poem, and thus as the measuring of the relation between world and thing; the poem would bring things into the intimacy of this simple measure and make possible a "home coming." I have spoken of an allegory—we see now that this is an allegory formed around Heidegger's figure of language as the house of Being, and around Hölderlin's ambition of finding a measured and firm word (the "firm letter," he called it in Palmos8). The wanderers of the second stanza ofTrakl's poem are poets. The threshold of pain they would cross, quietly, is the threshold of language made firm in the poem. That to which they accede would be the intimacy of world and thing figured in the preeminent Hölderlinian symbols of bread and wine. Trakl's poem is an allegory of poetry as a founding word.9 Now, one might expect Heidegger to stop at this point (since things are going so well) or shortly thereafter—that is to say, once he has developed the notion that the poem brings language to speak as the silent peal of difference that stills the movement of world and thing through the measured rhythm of its melos. But instead he adds a word on the need for poetry as a finite act of human speaking—a need that is as much language's need as a human need. He is following through the logic of finitude. The speaking of difference, though the condition of possibility of any signifying act, can only come about in singular articulations—it can only occur inasmuch as it is drawn out in distinct signifying acts (which arc not necessarily linguistic in the restricted sense—poetry simply has the privilege of showing itself most demonstratively as such a performance). Heidegger pursues this point about language and finitude with reference to the event of appropriation as it concerns the human essence, thus returning to the question from which he began. Mortals are</page><page sequence="9">NOISE A Τ THE THRESHOLD 109 given to language, Heidegger said at the very outset of his essay (agreeing with the tradition)—this defines their essence. But, he added, they are given to language by language (and there he departs from the tradition). The point is implicit in what he has said about the event of appropriation that happens in the poem. Since mortals belong to the fourfold that is articulated in an originary fashion by the speaking that happens in poetry, their very essence is brought into play in poetry, defined there. Further, as it is of the essence of mortals to be given to language, the event of appropriation must also be thought as the giving of language; language must give itself in the poem, communicate itself in some way—it must give the possibility of significant speech. But language gives itself only inasmuch as it is brought to speak. This is why language needs poetry. Heidegger puts it this way: "Such an appropriating [the appropriation of the human essence and its "appropri ation" to the essence of language] takes place in that the essence of language needs and uses [braucht] the speaking of mortals in order to sound [verlauten] as the peal of stillness for the hearing [hören] of mortals. Only insofar as men belong [gehören] within the peal of stillness are mortals capable in their manner of a sounding speaking [verlautende Sprechen] (PLT, 208). The appro priation of the human essence occurs inasmuch as language uses the speech of mortals to give itself to mortals, to make itself audible. For only insofar as mortals hear can they speak. Heidegger makes this point again near the end of his essay, and again he points to the necessity of a speaking. Mortals speak, he says, because they have heard, because they already belong or answer to the command of difference (the Geheiss). They speak, he says, because they listen, and when they speak they draw from language's command what they bring into the sounding word. In this sense, their speaking is always a response that corresponds, an entsprechen. But while such correspondence presupposes what Heidegger describes as a kind of reserve (we must listen and hold back from speaking, if our speaking is to answer in an authentic manner), this reserve must also be ready, Heidegger says, to anticipate upon the command of difference. It must go out ahead, zuvorkommen. This may seem like an overeager obedience, but it is what determines the manner of the mortal entsprechen, which is an answering, a speaking, that counters or rejoins (ent gegnet), precisely in order to draw from this encounter (ent-nehmen) its own possibility.10 We should be attentive to the echoing of the privative uent-" in this concluding passage of "Language." The answering reply dis-appropriates or ex-propriates something of the speaking of language precisely in order to make correspondence and appropriation possible. It deprives or alters in some fashion. And since language needs this reply in order to speak (to come about in its essence: the essence of language is also at stake in the event</page><page sequence="10">110 CHRISTOPHER FYNSK wherein humankind is appropriated to it), we are undoubtedly justified in concluding that this originary dis-appropriation is related to the tearing (the reissen) that occurs with the drawing out of language—at least insofar as this tearing is indissociable from what Heidegger calls a "breaking" (as we will see momentarily). In this sense, the anticipatory speaking of mortals would constitute something like the "suffering" oflanguage. Once again, the pain to which Heidegger refers has its source in language; as Heidegger cautions, it is not to be taken in anthropomorphic terms. But in what way does language suffer? It suffers, I would suggest, through the introduction of what I want to call, provisionally, "noise." Shortly before the passage I have just been commenting, Heidegger writes, "At the proper time, it becomes unavoidable to think of how mortal speech and its utterance [Verlautbarung] take place in the speaking of language as the peal of the stillness of the dif-ference. Any uttering [Verlauten], whether in speech or writing [my emphasis], breaks the stillness. On what does the peal of stillness break? How does the broken stillness come to sound [Lauten] in words? How does the broken stillness shape [prägt] the mortal speech that sounds [erklingt] in verses and sentences?" (PLT, 208). Heidegger would seem to be admitting here that there is no stillness, except as broken. Only a broken stillness imprints mortal speech. Now, Heidegger will immediately assert that we must not take Verlautbarung (and above all not "expression" [Ausdruck]) as the element from which human speech takes its decisive measure. The structure of human speech can only derive from the mode, the melos in which the speaking oflanguage appropriates mortals. But Heidegger has also asserted that the speaking of language can only appropriate mortals to their being by using the speaking of mortals (which as a Verlauten may be either speech or writing). And if all speaking of mortals breaks the silence, then the speaking of language can only sound for mortals through a certain noise. To put this very simply: we perceive only broken silence because we can only hear speech ("the essence of language needs and uses the speaking of mortals in order to sound as the peal of stillness"); we hear silence only through the contrasts of speech. The fact that there is no silence but broken silence would seem to unsettle in a fundamental way the claims Heidegger makes for poetic speech and the allegory he constructs on the basis of Trakl's A Winter Evening. If the stillness of saying is broken, then it would seem that there can be no stilling of the relation between world and thing; the rhythmic articulation of the fourfold within which the thing is said to "repose" [PLT, p. 206) would be disrupted. How could Heidegger not be aware of such a consequence? Or could he have thought that the rhetorical weight of his reading of Trakl's poem would still any questions raised by his concluding remarks? In which case, why raise them? It seems reasonable to suppose, on the contrary, that Heidegger was</page><page sequence="11">NOISE AT THE THRESHOLD 111 quite in control of the movement of this text, and that the questioning conclusion served to cast what I have called the allegory of poetic saying into the mode of possibility. We have still to evaluate the status of such a mode in Heidegger's writing." But it happens that in another text in On the Way to Language Heidegger proposes a solution to the difficulty he raises at the end of "Language." He argues near the conclusion of this essay that the "noise" of Verlautbarung is reabsorbed by the melos of poetic saying. "Noise" (in the sense of sonority) plays a constitutive part in the sounding of the essence of language, he admits, but the occurence of this sounding—the opening of a measure and a harmony—attunes the poetic saying in such a way as to carry it back into silence. Accordingly, Heidegger offers a very different notion of "breaking" in the final lines of "The Essence of Language" from the one we see in "Language." Human speech breaks the silent speaking of language, but breaks up as it is appropriated by the speaking it allows to occur: "To break up here means that the sounding word [verlautende Wort] returns into sound lessness [inj Lautlose], back to whence it was granted: into the ringing of stillness which, as Saying, moves the regions of the world's fourfold into their nearness. The breaking up of the word [Zerbrechen] is the true step back on the way of thinking" [OWL, 106). The predominance of the imagery of sound (despite the fact that Heideg ger refers consistently to both spoken and written language12) would lead us to suspect that the "noise" to which Heidegger alludes, in speaking of the breaking of silence, derives essentially from the material, sonorous character of human speech. Careful attention to the argument in "The Essence of Language" (to which I want to return) will bear out this point. But it should be noted that the words Verlautbarung, Verlauten and even Lauten connote more than a simple "sounding." "Laut" does in fact mean "sound" or "tone," and is used in linguistics to designate the phoneme. As an adjective, it means "loud," "noisy," or simply "distinct," or "audible." It can thus take on the figurative meaning of "public." The latter sense dominates in the term "Verlautbaren," which means "to report" or "to divulge," "to publish." Verlauten, in turn, is an intransitive verb meaning "to spread about" or "to give to understand"; wie verlautet means "according to what people say," "as it is rumored." Thus it is clear that these last terms connote something more than "making audible"—they have to do with the transmission of a signified content, what Heidegger refers to in his discussion of "idle talk" in Being and Time as "what is said-in-the-talk."13 Indeed, Verlautbarung could designate precisely what Heidegger means by "idle talk" in that volume. In this respect, we might surmise that the "noise" in question derives from the repeatable character of the linguistic sign (understood as a relation between signifier and signified) that makes it possible for any speech to bear significa</page><page sequence="12">112 CHRISTOPHER FYNSK tion outside a fixed context, and thus to empty out as it is spread about and repeated without the "primordial understanding" deriving from a "primary relationship of being" towards the reality talked about. The noise in human speech would have its source in the conditions of what Heidegger calls "average intelligibility," and that make it possible for the sign to function as a sign: precisely the source of what Heidegger described in "Hölderlin and the Essence of Poetry" as the "permanent danger" attending all authentic use of language.14 Those conditions are material, but they have to do with the significant character of language. We should not forget that the problem Heidegger is dealing with in discussing the articulation of human speech and the essence of language is also the problem of signification. But when Heidegger takes up the question of Verlautbarung in "The Essence of Language," he emphasizes only the sensuous (referring to it as das Sinnliche, das Leibhafte) and primarily sonorous dimension of language. His aim is to account for its materiality with the concept of earth and to circumscribe the sign structure (a unity of sense and sound—Heidegger takes Aristotle's famous definition of the sign in On Interpretation for his example) with his notion of the relation between earth and world. In the economy of his essay, this move allows him to locate the saying of language in the broader context of the "countering" relations of the fourfold ("the face to face encounter of the world's regions" [OWL, 107]) after he has described how its saying opens the neighborhood (the face to face relation) of poetry and thought. The citations from Hölderlin (OWL, 99-100) work essentially to this purpose. Having suggested indirectly that the concepts of melody and rhythm, and thus the kinship between song and speech, might shed light on the proper nature of the sounds and tones of speech (provided that these concepts are removed from any "metaphysical-technical" determination), and having suggested that we have yet to grasp what is conveyed in the German term for dialect, "Mundart" (namely that dialects flow from the earth, always differently in accordance with the "landscape"), Heidegger turns to Hölderlin's figure of language as the "flower of the mouth." Each of the four citations merit consideration, given the critical attention that has been devoted to this figure (and we should remember that Heidegger would challenge this very term). But for my purposes here; I would stress merely Heidegger's claim that Hölderlin's figure names (and is) the advent of language as song in which the relation of world and earth is composed (gefugt) in the manner described in "The Origin of the Work of Art" when Heidegger defines how the work of art sets out the Äm-design (the difference between world and earth as it is traced out in the event of truth) by setting forth the earth in the Open of truth. This "composing" of language makes any "physiological-physical" explanation of its "earthly" character (based on "phonetic data") wholly inadequate (OWL, 98). "The sound of lan</page><page sequence="13">NOISE A Τ THE THRESHOLD 113 guage," Heidegger writes, "its earthiness, is held with the harmony [das Stimmen] that attunes the regions of the world's structure [die Gegenden des Weltgeföges] to one another by playing them together" (OWL, 101). The material quality of poetic language is thus strictly equivalent to what Heidegger described as the "thingly" character of the work of art, and it is grounded in the same fashion. Heidegger has simply developed his notion of the differential relation of world and earth with his notion of the countering structure of the fourfold. "When the word is called the mouth's flower and its blossom," Heidegger writes, "we hear the sound of language rising like the earth" (OWL, 101). That is to say, the poetic word is brought into and brings forth the articula tion of world and earth as the speaking of language, and is thus carried back into the silent peal of stillness, the source of its being. Gathered in this silence, it "blooms" in the same manner that the bread and wine are said to shine on the table in the poem by Trakl—though it does so in the manner of language, and thus as the word that holds bread and wine, as things, in their simple presence. But "Brot" and "Wein" in Trakl's poem (at least as these words may be read in the allegory of poetic saying Heidegger constructs) also ring silently as words in the same way as does Hölderlin's figure of the flower of the mouth—for they are the accomplished naming, out of the difference of world and thing (and out of the speaking of difference), of these things in their presence. And Heidegger may well be assuming that as a citation of Hölderlin (for in modern German poetic language, these are also unavoidably Hölderlin's words) they work as a saying of language (like Hölderlin's figure), or a saying of poetic saying.15 Over the threshold of A Winter Evening unfolds the poetic language for which Hölderlin called in Bread and Wine, if not, in some sense, the poem itself. One might argue that this citation (let us supply the quotation marks: Da erglänzt in reiner Helle/Auf dem Tische "Brot und Wein") would constitute a kind of noise.16 For wouldn't this residue of textuality (the irreducible fact of the possibility of this citation and the resultant ambiguity of the verse: the fact that A Winter Evening also allows us to see a poem by Hölderlin on the table in the house, immediately rendering all "seeing" problematic as the language of the poem foregrounds itself as language), dampen the clarity of the poetic saying that give bread and wine as earthly gifts from the divine? Or wouldn't simply the echo of another poet's words (if we read somewhat less "liter ally") interfere with the poem's silence? Heidegger would suggest, I believe, that such textual and intertextual play is subsumed in the reflexive or allegorical structure of a poem that says the essence of poetry and that what is said in Brot und Wein would in some manner be repeated and re-collected in Trakl's poem. Or he would suggest (another version of the same point) that one threshold opens upon another, that the silent ringing of one word</page><page sequence="14">114 CHRISTOPHER FYNSK brings forth the ringing of another to produce a manifold but harmonious silence. But if we allow, for the moment, that Heidegger's notion of poetic saying may subsume the questions raised by this instance of citation (which is to grant quite a bit), there still remains a more immediately troublesome fact for the general statement Heidegger is making about poetic language. This is the fact that Hölderlin himself (whose words, "Brot und Wein," are implicitly being used—if for nothing else—to caution the claims Heidegger is making for the poetic saying that occurs in A Winter Evening) consistently questioned in his later poetry the possibility of achieving a measured poetic saying like the one Heidegger ascribes to him and to Trakl. Hölderlin suggested ex plicitly that the "suffering" of language (his own in any case) is irredeem able—by which I mean not measurable or gatherable, not "compactible" in the way Heidegger suggests with his interpretation of Trakl's figure of the threshold that has turned to stone. The human suffering Hölderlin describes in his late poetry (I think first of In lovely blueness . . .) is indissociablc from this knowledge, and in large measure proceeds from it; it is a suffering that proceeds from thc poetic experience of the impossibility of mourning—that is to say, from an experience with language. "Mourning" would designate here the capacity to assume mortality and the finitude that is revealed (Heidegger argues) in and by this preeminent human possibility. "In death," Heidegger writes in his commentary on the figure of the wanderers in A Winter Evening, "the supreme concealedness of Being crystallizes [versammelt sich]. Death has already overtaken every dying" (PLT, 200). "Death" names here the truth of all being-toward-death. For mortals, it is the impossible; that upon which Dasein opens in its assumption of its mortality (as it stands at the threshold, its opening to the Being of what is), but which it can never have in its grasp. Its meaning is defined (or a relation to it is established) in the poetic acts of language that trace the threshold, but this definition of meaning is not an appropriation. For Dasein cannot appropriate its own finitude; which is to say, it cannot mourn itself in such a way as to interiorize its exposure to alterity (its opening to what is). It may measure itself against this alterity, and may measure it as difference (difference opens only in such a measuring, Heidegger asserts: this is the gathering of the concealedness of Being, what Heidegger describes elsewhere as the drawing out of a nearness). But difference can never be Dasein's own. The logic of finitude strictly forbids any such possibility—and all of Hölderlin's later poetry and thought is devoted to thinking and obeying this injunction. For Hölderlin, a proper mourning would be nothing other than obedience to this injunction: purity and firmness before absence or (as in the Remarks on Oedipus) irremediable loss. But Hölderlin found no such measure—he could establish no such mea</page><page sequence="15">NOISE A Τ THE THRESHOLD 115 sure in a "firm letter." As he suggests in Mnemosyne, mourning "fails" in his poetry.17 In In lovely blueness . . ., this failure ("like brooks, the end of something sweeps me away") is figured in a flow of metaphoricity and in a series of figures expressing a lack of measure (the "third eye," the plaint of the poor man, etc.).18 But I would like to call attention to one figure in particular in this last poem, because it appears to touch upon the question of the materiality of poetic speech, and may point to another dimension of the "noise" (though this term grows increasingly problematic—for we must go beyond the limitations implied by a metaphorics of sonority) that disrupts the harmonious articulation of the speaking of language and human speech, and thus the possibility of mourning as Heidegger describes it in his reading of Trakl. I refer here to a figure that appears at the opening of the third and last section of In lovely blueness If someone looks into the mirror, a man, and in it sees his image, as though it were a painted likeness; it resembles the man. [Wenn einer in den Spiegel siehet, ein Mann, und siehet darin sein Bild, es gleich dem Manne.] This unsettling line is intelligible only in the context of the concerns that occupy the first section of the poem. Hölderlin had opened the poem by implicitly asserting that a human being might appear, in its purity, as an image of divinity. Starting from the image of a man framed against the windows of a church steeple "blossoming" in lovely blueness, he had suggested that a poetic relation might be found between the beauty of nature and the beauty of human purity. Poetry would form the bridge between these forms of beauty and make possible a dwelling on earth by establishing man's capacity to be an image of divinity. It would ground this capacity like (and as) the Bildsamkeit that initially appears to the poet against the beauty of nature: "If now someone comes down beneath the bell, comes down those steps, a still life it is [ein stilles Leben ist «] because, when the figure is so detached, the man's plasticity [Bildsamkeit] is brought out." The first stanza of the poem, then, asserts the possibility of establishing human Bildsamkeit as the condition of an appearance commensurate with the manifestation of the divine (which is said to appear, as Heidegger argues in his interpretation of the poem, as unknown, and like the manifestness of the sky). But in the second stanza, the poet begins to speak in the first person (for convenience, let us refer to this "I" as Hölderlin) and expresses both his desire to achieve the Gestalt of a pure soul, and his difficulty in doing so. The third stanza then evokes his failure. When he looks in the mirror of his poetry (the constant references to conditions of representation and to the poet's own suffering make this equation almost unavoidable), he sees a kind of "still</page><page sequence="16">116 CHRISTOPHER FYNSK life." But the stillness of this image is of a very different form from the one that appeared in the window of the church steeple as it was gathered in a play of light, color and sound. It is of an uncanny, deathly stillness. And what the poet sees with his "third eye" is resemblance; not simply his reflection or image, but the likeness of a painted representation. What the man sees in the mirror, in other words, is his capacity to resemble something (himself)—he sees his Bildsamkeit. But this capacity for resemblance is surely not the condition of the appearance of a correspon dence with the divine (the man does not see the Gestalt of the "pure soul" of which Hölderlin speaks in the poem's second section: "die Wesenheit, die Gestalt ist's"). The man does indeed see resemblance (not a resemblance, rather resemblance itself); but, as Blanchot would remind us, this is the very "impure" resemblance of the cadaver. "Man is made in his image," Blanchot remarks, "but this formula should first of all be understood in this way: man is unmade according to his image."19 Blanchot illustrates this statement with a long and extraordinary meditation on the strange status of the cadaver (neither fully a person or a thing) as it slips from the world of significant relations and begins to resemble itself (not the human being it was, but an anonymous being brought forth by this resemblance). The strange resem blance of the cadaver—that is to say, the appearance of what is properly unrepresentable: mimesis "itself," the possibility of appearing like some thing—brings to the surface a dimension of the image that art takes as its proper domain (a domain that undoes all "property," all essentiality). It is the domain of what Heidegger refers to in "The Origin of the Work of Art" as Verstellung, "dissemblance" (one of the two forms of concealment Heideg ger recognizes in the play of concealment and unconcealment [PLT, 54]). Blanchot refers to it as "dissimulation." Prior to all negation of being, Blanchot argues, and thus prior to any constitution of meaning or ideality, there is dissimulation.20 It belongs to the very possibility of the appearance of what is, but is revealed only when objects withdraw in some way from the world as a realm of significant relations. Such withdrawal occurs for Dasein in various forms of "limit-experience" that all communicate in some way with the experience of death (not the death of negation, but the death that is a slipping away from the capacity for negation), and it is the event that is proper to art. Literature, Blanchot argues, enters into this domain of appear ance prior to the world—and only then does it become literature—when its language becomes image.21 This is not to say that literary language is characterized by its use of images, but rather that it becomes the image of language (in the same way the image seizes the cadaver) and allows language itself to show dissemblance. Language that becomes the image of language, Blanchot says, takes on a spectral quality, and, as Blanchot argues in "Literature and the Right to Death," a strange opacity.22 It is like a thing,</page><page sequence="17">NOISE A Τ THE THRESHOLD 117 but a thing that does not achieve the muteness or silence of the thing (even if it actively pursues the destruction of signification, as in some poetic experi mentation) because it will always appear as language and show the empty possibility of signification, a strange residue of meaning beyond meaning or before meaning (as achieved in any semantic configuration) that belongs to the very possibility of meaning but cannot be subsumed or eliminated. A proper analysis of this material quality of poetic language to which Blanchot points would lead well beyond the bounds of this paper (and such an analysis would eventually have to relate the materiality in question here to the materiality that makes up the "danger" of language to which Heideg ger refers in "Hölderlin and the Essence of Poetry": the material conditions of "average intelligibility"). I thus conclude by offering merely the hypothesis that an experience with this dimension of language contributes to Hölderlin's experience of what I have called the impossibility of mourning, and that a full consideration of its nature (as something that resists any essential determi nation) would unsettle Heidegger's most fundamental claims for poetry. For Heidegger, the compact threshold of poetic language (the "firm letter") is also a tombstone, the house is a sepulcre (the image is made explicit in "Language in the Poem" [OWL, 173, 188], but is already suggested strongly by the images of "stilling" in "Language"—however much Heidegger insists that such stillness is not the absence but the highest form of movement in measure). The accomplished mourning of poetic remembrance would be an assumption of mortality. But it would hold in it the possibility of a kind of rebirth (again, a major figure in "Language in the Poem") and access to what we might call the life of the spirit. Heidegger looks to poetry, in other words, for what Blanchot would describe as "the possibility of dying."23 But Hölderlin experiences precisely the impossibility of such an assumption of mortality through poetic Stiftung. "Life is death," he writes at the end of In lovely blueness . . ., "and death is a kind of life." This line is not about redemption; it describes existence beyond the borders of a life circumscribed (and rendered meaningful) by death. An errancy ("poor stranger in Greece," Hölderlin writes of Oedipus) destined to no Colonus and no homecoming: a death that is not yet life and that is the impossibility of dying. Other modern writers have described such errancy and such an experience with language: Kafka, Beckett, Blanchot, Celan. They demonstrate that another articulation of the terms "life" and "death" is required—and one that is not necessarily tragic—once we assume the impossibility of dying (or to return to the figure from which I started, the impossibility of putting an end to the noise). In Heidegger, the way to language seems to lead inevitably to death in the sense of stillness (at least one powerful strain of his thinking takes that path, or takes its orientation from that possibility). But if we</page><page sequence="18">118 CHRISTOPHER FYNSK attend more to the noise in language than does Heidegger, very different paths will open. There is something like an ethics or a politics implied here. Reflection on poetic or literary language today can no longer posit silence or stillness as a kind of telos or even a mere possibility; it must start from the fact of broken silence and begin to dwell with noise.

All page references for this essay in the body of the text (as well as those for "The Origin of the Work of Art," also translated by Hofstadter) will be from this volume and preceded by the abbreviation "PLTWhen my argument has required a more literal rendition, I have made slight modifications in the translation (which I find generally very faithful). 2. I refer here to an unpublished essay, "Qu'il y a le langage . . Heidegger, Derrida," presented at the Collegium Phaenomenologicum, Perugia, August 1987. The argument of this essay will be presented in a book I am preparing on the problem of language in Heidegger and Blanchot. 3. Albert Hofstadter provides the following translation (PLT, 194—195) of Ein Winterabend·. A Winter Evening Window with falling snow is arrayed, Long tolls the vesper bell, The house is provided well, The table is for many laid. Wandering ones, more than a few, Come to the door on darksome courses. Golden blooms the tree of graces Drawing up the earth's cool dew. Wanderer quietly steps within; Pain has turned the threshold to stone. There lie, in limpid brightness shown, Upon the table bread and wine. 1 want to emphasize that 1 will be attending to the allegory Heidegger constructs rather than to the texture of Trakl's poem. Veronique Foti noted very appropriately after my initial presentation of this essay that Heidegger's reading of A Winter Evening should also be situated in the larger context of his reading ofTrakl (which includes his essay "Language in the Poem," also in On the Way to Language) and that Trakl's poem demands consideration in the context of his oeuvre. I am in full agreement with these points, but will pursue a specific focus that does not immediately require this broader perspective. 4. "Relation of relations" is a phrase that is perhaps too overdetermined philosophically, though Heidegger uses it in one of his essays on language to designate language itself. ("The Essence of Language," in On the Way to Language [New York: Harper and Row, 1971], 107.</page><page sequence="19">NOISE A Τ THE THRESHOLD 119 Peter D. Hertz translates the title of this essay as "The Nature of Language." Further references to this essay in the body of the present discussion will be preceded by the abbreviation "OWL."). As we will see, the tracing out of difference he describes in Trakl's poem is the speaking of language. But I use the phrase to recall that what the language of the poem traces or sets out is the relation or the measure governing what is finally a set of relations—the presence of the thing is defined by the way it bears in itself the relations between mortals, earth, sky, and the divine. When Heidegger speaks of a presence sheltered in absence, he is referring to the way the thing is given to us in and by these relations as they define a spatio-temporal disposition. What Heidegger calls the difference is the measure of these relations. 5. It is somewhat disappointing that Heidegger asserts, but does not really clarify, the difference between the modes of saying that characterize the two stanzas. He accounts for it by referring to the difference between "thinging" and "worlding" that is said by the two stanzas; but as he pursues the difference between these two movements, he leaves aside the question of the corresponding modes of speaking. 6. As is Trakl, of course; the essay "Language in the Poem" develops the theme of pain (as difference) at some length. 7. See The Question of Being, trans. Jean T. Wilde and William Kluback (New Haven: Twaync, 1958), 71. 8. Heidegger never interprets this figure (at least to my recollection), but it is clear that he would read it on the basis of Hölderlin's remarks to Böhlendorff regarding the "sureness" of the sign and in relation to his understanding of the notion of poetic "founding." I take up this topic in my essay, "Hölderlin's Testimony: An Eye Too Many Perhaps," in Heidegger: Thought and Historicity (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1986); see in particular pp. 215-216. My concluding remarks on Hölderlin's In lovely blueness . . . in the present discussion also draw from the context of this essay. 9. Heidegger proposes, near the beginning of "The Origin of the Work of Art," a definition of allegory that is quite different from the more traditional one I am employing here: "The art work . . . says something other than the mere thing itself is, alio agoreuei. The work makes public something other than itself; it manifests something other; it is an allegory" (PLT, 19-20). As his essay will demonstrate, this "something other" is difference. A more precise meaning of the term "allegory," as I want to use it here, would have to be developed in the light of Heidegger's notion of poetry that says the essence of poetry (as is pre-eminently the case with Hölderlin, in Heidegger's view) and in the light of what Heidegger says about the way a work shows its "createdness" (PLT, 65). 10. In a marginal note printed in the Heidegger Gesamtausgabe (vol. 12, Unterwegs zur Sprache [Frankfurt am Main: Vittorio Klostermann, 1985], 29), Heidegger adds "entsagen." 11. I should add that it is by no means uncommon for Heidegger to offer the means for an entirely different reading of his argument from the one his text seems to favor by its rhetorical movements. Not only does Heidegger's text deconstruct itself constantly; it also points to different paths of inquiry (as in the first volume of Nietzsche). In this latter respect, Heidegger seems to be attempting to prompt thought on the part of readers willing to go beyond comforting formulas or conceptual schemata. 12. The reference to written language appears in the passage I quoted above concerning the "breaking" of silence. It appears also in the passage I am commenting from "The Essence of Language," 98. It goes without saying that if we were to pursue the question of written language, Heidegger's use of the term "speaking" would have to be brought into question. 13. Being and Time, trans. John Macquarrie and Edward Robinson (New York: Harper and Row, 1962). The citations from Being and Time in this paragraph are all from page 212 of the translation. I should note that I have not pursued the term "lauten" in this paragraph</page><page sequence="20">120 CHRISTOPHER FYNSK because Heidegger's use of it elsewhere in On the Way to Language merits special considera tion. One says in German, "Wie lautet. . . (der Brief, etc.)?" to say "How does it go?," "What were her words?," "How does it read?" etc. The question, in other words, asks for the precise terms used in order to seize the exact sense of the communication. "Hölderlin and the Essence of Poetry," trans. Paul de Man, Quarterly Review of Literature, vol. 10, Nos. 1-2, 1959. Sec pages 82-83. I might note that Derrida's concept of "iterability" would be useful in this context. See, for example, his essay, "Signature, Event, Context," in Glyph 1, trans. Samuel Weber and Jeffrey Mehlman (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1977), 179-180. See also "Plato's Pharmacy," in Dissemination, trans. Barbara Johnson (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1981), 61-172, in which Derrida demon strates how the sign's "repeatability" haunts metaphysics from its inception. In fact, the line concerning the origination of words like flowers comes from Hölderlin's Bread and Wine and is the "one word" about the word Heidegger wants us to retain from his citations of Hölderlin. I want to thank Andrzej Warminski for this suggestion. For a discussion of this theme in Mnemosyne, see Anselm Haverkamp, "Error in Mourning—A Crux in Hölderlin: 'dem gleich fehlet die Trauer' ('Mnemosyne')," in Yale French Studies, The Lesson of Paul de Man, No. 69, (1985), 238-253. I will be citing Michael Hamburger's translation of this poem as it appears in Friedrich Hölderlin, Poems and Fragments (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1980), 600-605. "Two Versions of the Imaginary," trans. Lydia Davis, in Maurice Blanchot, The Gaze of Orpheus (Barrytown: Station Hill Press, 1981), 85. Ibid., 89. Ibid., 77. Ibid., 21-62. It is true that Heidegger describes the assumption of mortality as a passage and as a "going down" to a site in which there gathers the original essence of time; in this respect, one could draw the conclusion that there can be no more than a crossing of the threshold and no static dwelling within the difference that gathers. But when Heidegger hypostatizes death in "Language" ("Death has already overtaken every dying"), and when he evokes in "Lan guage and the Poem" the possibility of a rebirth through the assumption of "accomplished pain" (OWL, 189), he effectively appropriates death as a possibility. Let us note that Heidegger describes the "rebirth" in question as the rebirth of one generation or race (Geschlecht [OWL, 195]) out of the decline (which is not a decomposition, but a "going down") of the West as it assumes its historical destiny (OWL, 194-196). I cannot refrain from observing here that I find few texts by Heidegger—including his "Rectoral Address"—as unsettling as this one in a political perspective (which is to say that it calls for careful and extended analysis). For the range of possible connotations of the word "Ges chlecht," see Derrida's essays, "Geschlecht: Difference sexuelle, difference ontologique," and "La main de Heidegger (Geschlecht II)," in Psyche: Inventions de l'autre (Paris: Galilee, 1987), 395-452.</page></plain_text>
