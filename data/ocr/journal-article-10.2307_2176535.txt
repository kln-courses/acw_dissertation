BY all students of history it has been recognized that in the religious spirit is to be found one of the most potent of the forces which have determined the character and the destiny of nations. Nor is it less evident, on the other hand, that among many of the leading peoples of the world, the sections of society most distinctively intellectual and progressive are largely com- posed of individuals who have passed beyond the influence of the religious tenets held by their fathers, either adopting toward such religion a directly hostile attitude, or passively ignoring it, be- cause they regard its dogmas as too dubious to be accepted by them as the rule of faith and duty. One may regard this scepticism of the more cultivated minds in Italy, France, Germany, and England, with distaste or with satisfaction, one may look upon it as an indication of intellectual growth, or as a proof of moral obliquity, but its existence in various forms and degrees it is impossible to deny. It is little wonder if, in view of this fact, the question at times presses upon us, as to what part, if any, religion is to play in the future story of civilization. Is it a force that has nearly spent itself, or that at least is diminishing, and is destined to diminish further, and at last to disappear? Or are its roots so closely interwoven with the deepest instincts and needs of the human soul, that its reign must be as enduring as humanity itself? Or is it possible that religion is a permanent factor in the life of our race, but that it is destined to pass into wholly new forms, and to express itself in</page><page sequence="2">2 TTE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW, [VOL. X manifestations hitherto unrecognized, corresponding to the rise of the masses of mankind to higher stages of intelligence, and to the enlargement of their moral horizon. Obviously the whole significance of any discussion of this problem depends upon the attaching of some definite meaning to the word 'religion.' Very numerous and very diverse have been the definitions offered of the term. Generally they have erred by suggesting too narrow a restriction of its denotation. What religion is, has too often been taken to mean what some ,one form, or some one function of religion is. Not seldom the word has been limited to the higher, or more intense manifesta- tion of devotional feelings, or to what has been held to be the more worthy presentations of spiritual truth. From this it comes that we are still sometimes assured that many savage people have 4 no religion.' From this, too, originates the misleading classi- fication of religions into ' true' and ' false.' Evidently, how- ever, any such restriction of the term is unwarranted. Like all other important phenomena of human society, religion has ap- peared in many forms, being modified and qualified by the in- numerable circumstances determining the character and the en- vironment of races, communities, and individuals. Moreover, any careful study of religions leads us to recognize the historical con- tinuity of the religious consciousness, and we see that the 'higher,' more complex, and more spiritual forms of cult and creed, have been evolved gradually from those that were simpler and more crude. Nor, again, is any satisfactory exposition given of the true nature of religion, if only one aspect of the religious life is recognized in the definition. Thus " morality touched with emotion" may perhaps stand as the expression of the dominant note in the creed of a Matthews Arnold, as it might in that of a Marcus Aurelius, or, with a difference of emphasis, of a George Fox; but it would be an obviously inadequate description of what religion meant to a Calvin, or a Thomas Aquinas. We must try therefore to lay our foundation more broadly and more deeply. When we ask ourselves what we mean when we speak of a religious man, a religious community, a religious race, we find</page><page sequence="3">No. I.] THE ESSENTIAL IN RA'ELIGION. 3 that we have in view a certain temper of mind, a certain way of facing the facts of existence, which affects the whole tone and color of the emotional life, and which has a determining influence upon conduct, upon that external side, that is, of a man's indi- viduality by which alone his fellows can judge of him; whether the creed be low or lofty, simple or complex, it must be felt; whether its outer expression consist in ceremony or ritual, in philanthropic work or in fanatical persecutions, some effect it must have on the emotional and the practical life; if either of these factors be wholly absent the phenomenon is not that of religion. Thus, for example, almost all critics of Immanuel Kant have agreed that his account of religion was deficient and incorrect, just because in identifying it with the recognition of the moral law as a divine command, he almost eliminated from his definition the element of emotion. On the other hand, we should for the most part hesitate to call Rousseau a ' religious' character, not because of any defects in his creed, nor from any lack of emotional susceptibilities, but because his beliefs, though genuine, and often accompanied by keen feeling, were not to any appreciable extent ' springs of conduct.' The mere religiosity of the sentimentalist is not a genuine religion at all. The defi- nition of the Epistle of St. James is obviously directed to the exclusion of just such unpractical sentimentality. "Pure re- ligion, and undefiled before God, and the Father, is this: To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world." Yet there must be more than the influence of feeling upon conduct, to constitute religion. Mr. Herbert Spencer points out that the loving mother nursing her child gives us an example of a perfectly moral action performed under the stimulus of purely enjoyable feeling. Yet it would be absurd to speak of her act as a ' religious' one. To revert to what has been already said, there must be a certain way of facing things, a certain direction of the intelligence, which must offer an appropriate object to the feeling, and through it direct the conduct. And it is this, which we may call the intellectual factor in the religious consciousness, which constitutes the very heart and core of our problem.</page><page sequence="4">4 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. X. What is the intellectual factor present in, and essential to, ' re- ligion'? There would be little difficulty could we say that there must be an assent to a particular creed, embodying some one theory of the ultimate nature of the universe; and that to give such assent is the only duty of reason within the religious sphere. But such a view is, of course, impossible, save to the representatives of the narrowest forms of theological dogmatism. Even the most superficial glance over the history of religion makes it evident that no limit can be set to the theories and con- ceptions which have been held by men profoundly religious, as being of the essence of their creed. Apart from the enormous number of sects within Christianity, the creeds of Jews, Mahom- etans, Parsees, Buddhists, to name only a few, are at absolute variance from each other. What specific articles of belief were common to Confucius, and Pascal, and Marcus Aurelius, and Bunyan, and Socrates, and Simeon Stylites ? Surely it is clear that it is not because of adhesion to any one theological dogma or metaphysical conception that we rank these men as religious. We must conclude then that there is no particular belief as to what the ultimate reality of things is, or as to man's relation to that reality, which is either essential to, or incompatible with, the possession of religion. And yet, if, as we have seen, the intellect bears its part in re- ligion, the question must be faced regarding the nature of that part. In attempting to answer this question, I venture to offer a tentative explanation of the word ' religion,' which, if not fulfilling all the requirements of a strictly logical definition, may at least take account of all the elements which seem intrinsically necessary to it, and which are, therefore, to be found even in its most diverse manifestations. Religion is the intimate and vital apprehension, by the indi- vidual, of what is conceived to be reality, in its fullest sense, Ia vraie ze'ritk of things; whether such reality be regarded as co- extensive with, as included in, as inclusive of, or as distinct from, the world of natural phenomena, it always, however, being re- garded as in some way related to the individual himself; any such apprehension must embrace belief, emotional response, and</page><page sequence="5">No. i.] THE ESSENTIAL IN RELIGION. 5 the determination of conduct, in so far as conduct is supposed to have a bearing on the connection of the individual with such reality. Is now our proposed definition sufficiently broad to cover all cases in which we find manifestations of the religious spirit ? It may be well to test it provisionally, by observing its applicability to a few examples representative of religion, at widely separated stages of thought, and under the utmost diversity of creed and cult. We may begin with one of the lowest and crudest forms of religion, the fetish worship of the savage. Professor Tylor has described fetishism as " the doctrine of spirits embodied in, or at- tached to, or conveying influence through, certain material ob- jects." Fetishism is thus, as the same writer declares, but one form of animism-the general belief in spirits, so widespread among savage and barbarous people. Difficult as it is for us to figure to ourselves the vague and incoherent view of things that fetish- ism represents, yet this, to puerile superstition, must signify a genuine effort of the imagination to reach down to the real through the appearance. The influence of his belief on the con- duct of the savage varies under different conditions of race and environment, but often such influence is very great indeed; and the alternations of childish terror with equally childish attempts to wheedle or even to bully the unseen power through its ma- terial representation, are, in spite of their naivete, not unlike the display of feeling we often find among worshippers whose creed is far less crude and unsophisticated. Even in fetishism, then, we find there is implied a belief in a certain reality, there are feelings aroused by such a belief, and, to some extent, there is a direction of the conduct by these feelings. But the savage worshipper of sticks and stones, who is wholly incapable of giving the grounds of his belief, and who oftener re- gards his fetish with cowardly dread, or selfish greed, than with respect or veneration, is but at the lowest stage of religious prog- ress. His crude theory is half materialistic, his emotions are sordid, his conduct, though influenced, is hardly at all moralized by his belief in the supernatural.</page><page sequence="6">6 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. X. Let us turn to the religion which offers the most striking con- trast to this instinctive animism, and consider a highly spiritual- ized creed, as devoutly held and fully realized by a Christian saint. By men of all beliefs the Imitation of Christ has been studied and admired for the intensity and purity of its sentiments, its lofty ethical tone, and its absolute sincerity. The religion of Thomas a'Kempis is of a highly emotional type; for monasti- cism, restraining the free use of the intellect, and confining the practical activities within a narrow circle of devotional and disci- plinary exercises, necessarily tended to give a disproportionate preponderance to the purely subjective side of life. But if his apprehension of what he held to be spiritual reality was mystical rather than rational, if it was assumed rather than proved, it was none the less strong and intimate. If he says little of the need of a belief in God, it is because doubt was for him impossible. The Divine presence, the source of the soul's joy and power, is the thought that inspires all his meditations and prayers. Nor is its influence confined to the creation of an ecstasy of devotional feelings; it is the inner and hidden spring which fertilizes and beautifies the whole life, and renders the conduct holy and Christlike. The recognition of the dependence of the soul on God, the joy and peace that such a recognition brings, and the righteousness and strength that flow from it-this is the whole of religion as it is presented in the Imitation. " Above all things, and in all things, 0 my soul, thou shalt rest in the Lord always, for He is the everlasting rest of the saints." " Behold ! my God and all things! what would I more, and what happier things can I desire !" "Turn Thou us unto Thee, that we may be thankful, humble and devout; for Thou art our salvation, our courage and our strength." Now let us notice an example of the religious spirit, in which it is the intellectual apprehension of truth, rather than the emotional fervor, which dominates. Nothing could seem, perhaps, further removed from the ecstatic contemplation of the Imitation of Christ than the calm rationalistic philosophy of Spinoza's Ethics. But that the temper and teaching of Spinoza were profoundly religious has become apparent to every unprejudiced</page><page sequence="7">No. i.] THE ESSENTIAL IN RELIGION. 7 student of his system. If the great Jewish thinker was not the " Gott-getrunkene Mann" that Novalis called him, the epithet is misleading only because it represents the dominating idea in his mind as an exciting and stimulating conception, and not as was really the case, an illuminative and regulative one. Deus sizve Natura was for him synonymous with reality in its intrinsic unity, the infinite totality of the universe, conceivable by thought alone, and of which the individual objects apparent to sense are the ' Modes,' or finite manifestations. But while Spinoza rejects, definitely and deliberately, the anthropomorphic representation of the Deity, while the personality of God is a doctrine that he holds to be wholly antagonistic to the scientific and philosophical point of view, yet God who is Nature, world-force, and world- essence, to whom neither intellect nor will, as we commonly under- stand them, is to be ascribed, is none the less the object of man's intensest and purest love; and it is in its realization of its one- ness with the Divine that the soul finds the source of its highest and noblest activity. To know God, to love him, and to act ever under the influence of that love, this was as much the ideal of happiness, the only true life, for the outcast Jew who was held in abhorrence as an atheist and blasphemer, as it had been for the medieval monk. " Our salvation or blessedness, or liberty, consists in a constant or eternal love toward God" ; " The highest virtue of the mind is to know God, and from this knowl- edge arises the highest possible peace of mind"; "Blessedness is not the reward of virtue, but virtue itself." If, then, in view of such examples as these, and they might be multiplied and varied indefinitely, we take as the sufficient and indispensable characteristics of the religious spirit, the firm and vivid apprehension of reality (however conceived), an emotional response to this belief, and the regulation of the conduct by it, we can perhaps perceive how the decay in the religion of Christianity among the cultured classes has come about; and we can catch some glimpse of the probable fate of religion itself, in the more civilized and highly educated communities. Popularly, religion has been identified with a theology which includes as essential the belief in the supernatural and miraculous. The children of Cath-</page><page sequence="8">8 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. X. olics and Protestants alike have been taught from early youth that miracles are credible; that faith, the chief religious virtue, must accept as assured fact certain stories of divine interposition in, and interference with, the relation of natural phenomena to one another. The Catholic is taught to believe in the liquefaction of the blood of St. Januarius, the Protestant to scoff at this as a con- temptible superstition, but to accept as credible the story that Balaam's ass spake with man's voice. Now, such a creed, in an age like this, can be accepted by men of clear intelligence and logical habit of mind, who are to some degree familiar with the present position, the methods, and the results of the various natural sciences, only in so far as subjects of a religious character are excluded from the sphere of their mental activity. It is for the most part possible for such persons to give assent to current theo- logical dogmas, only so long as they make no attempt to Mkink them. That men of great intellectual force, who are capable of keen and merciless analysis in regard to other matters, do main- tain the tenability of such beliefs, is indisputable; and it would be absurd to assume hypocrisy or deliberate insincerity in such cases. If we consider how earnestly and perserveringly it has been taught for centuries, by moralist and theologian alike, that the moral life is dependent on an acceptance of certain religious dogmas, we shall realize that there is no ground for wonder, and little for contempt, if even earnest and able reasoners have been timid in regard to instituting or recommending a frank and thor- ough examination, where it seemed that it might be dangerous to the foundations of character and conduct. But more and more is it becoming difficult to hold the tradition of supernaturalism as a vehicle of vital and essential truth. To those who are guided by emotion rather than by thought-and their number is great-it is indeed practicable, even for the educated, to regard the Bible, or the Lives of the Saints, merely as a point d'appui for tender feelings and aspiring hopes, though perhaps in such cases the adhesion to implied theological doctrines is more apparent than real. But to men who covet more rational and logical processes, there are but two alternatives-they must set as their mark, not truth, but orthodoxy, and search out with painful ingenuity the</page><page sequence="9">No. i.] THE ESSENTIAL IN RELIGION 9 strongest attainable props and guards for their tottering creed, too often satisfying themselves with arguments the fallacy of which in any other connection they would readily detect, till they at last "with much toil attain to half-belief"- or they must boldly apply to all theological questions, however fundamental and vital, the same methods, with equal frankness and imparti- ality, that they would strive to make use of for the disentangling of knotty problems in secular concerns. In the former case, the structure of credulity becomes subject to dry rot, and in time will crumble away; in the latter case, it is liable to be shattered at a blow. Now religion cannot maintain itself on a half-belief or on a no- belief; it requires, as has already been stated, an apprehension of reality, which, however partial, incoherent, and imperfect it may be in itself, is yet for the individual himself a genuine reaching down to the heart of things. For this, a creed of supernaturalism and miracle still suffices in the case of those wholly ignorant, and even in that of those more or less educated, if untrained in reasoning and knowing little of the results of modern scientific research or of philosophical analysis. It suffices, too, for men of active life, who have little taste or power for critical investigation, but who warmly appreciate the pure and lofty ethics of the New Testa- ment; and for that very large class of men, and especially of women, who, finding in religion that satisfaction of their emo- tional needs which seems otherwise denied them in the prosaic and dull routine of every-day existence, ask nothing else from it. It need hardly be pointed out how vast is the number of persons, in even the most intelligent and well-informed communities, who are included in the categories we have indicated. Supernaturalism is not dead, it is probably not even dying, so far as the vast masses of the population of Europe and America are concerned. But each generation extends the circle of those who deliberately re- ject or practically ignore its influence. If it is with the belief in the miraculous that we identify religion, it seems safe to say that the sway of the latter over the educated classes is doomed, and if, however slowly, the masses of the people are to be raised to</page><page sequence="10">10 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. X. a higher level of thought and mental training, its influence upon them must gradually wane.' But too strong a protest cannot be made against such an identification, for which, indeed, there is no justification either in history or in philosophy. Religion implies a faith, not in this or that presentation of truths, but in truth itself; and whoever finds in truth his ideal, and strives to realize it in whatever way is possible for him-however clearly he may recognize that his approximation to it can be but partial and imperfect-possesses the intellectual element of religion. The presence of such an element is implied in any active endeavor of the mind to attain to real fact. How that reality may be conceived of matters nothing, so far as the genuineness of the religious life founded on it is concerned, though of course the comparative adequacy of the conception will determine whether such religion will permanently prevail as consonant with the demands of human reason. Are there, then, any grounds for doubt that reverence for truth, and the earnest effort to appro- priate truth, are permanent factors in the progress of our race ? And has it ever been found that this effort to get at the heart of things, to see life steadily and to see it whole, has been void of emotional response or of influence upon conduct? To the scientific or philosophical mind, and they differ only as the object of reverent investigation is the partial and specific, or the universal and generic, the love of truth is itself a passion, and a passion which by its very nature tends to purify the soul from all low and selfish affections. Sincerity, patience, self-devotion, openness of mind are some of the virtues that are characteristic of the lover of truth. To strive to make the ideal of life an actual fact, this is morality. To recognize the claims of the real, refusing to rest content with the merely transient and surface aspect of things; to strive to reach their true meaning, and to find joy and peace in bringing the life into harmony with it, this is religion; and this no extension I I intentionally omit here, as foreign to my purpose, any discussion of the other causes, political, social, and economic, which appear to be potent factors in the decay of theological faith among many European nations.</page><page sequence="11">No. I.] THE ESSENTIAL IN RELIGION. I I of scientific method, no new discovery of facts or new formu- lations of natural law, no investigations into the workings of reason itself, can ever render outworn or effete. For what is the essential difference between the irreligious and the religious man ? Surely not that the one denies and the other asserts the existence of the supernatural. It lies, not in what the belief is, but in how the belief is held. One man is content to look no further than to the externals of things, to concur in phrases without asking their significance, to set a value only on the obvious and the immediate, to drift idly on the stream of life. With such a one, whether he calls himself an orthodox churchman or an agnostic, his conception of what is real is so vague and so vacillating, as to awaken but tepid feelings, and to have no appreciable effect upon action. Another man, whether to him the fact of facts presents itself as a Divine Father, whose love guides his children and whose wisdom governs the world, or as that ever-unfolding mystery of natural law in the universe in which reason finds its reflection and its satisfaction, or as a hu- manity which gives all its interest and its worth to the material world, in any case recognizes in it what for him is the highest attainable truth, and what as such calls out his deepest emotions and shapes his ideal of life. If sincerity, earnestness, and devotion to knowledge are likely to remain, to grow and strengthen with the higher evolution of our race, then, however present creeds may drop out, and religious organizations may decay, the in- fluence of a genuine belief upon the heart and life cannot cease. The content of belief may undergo a change as knowledge in- creases and the reasoning power develops, but this change we may well feel assured, will involve the loss only of what is tem- porary and extrinsic, and will lead the way to a higher and purer form of the religious life.
