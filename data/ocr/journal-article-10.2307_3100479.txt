<plain_text><page sequence="1">Exhibition Reviews London, Whitechapel Art Gallery Arshile Gorky 1904-1948 'What has the Armenian experience to add to modern life? Sensitivity. That is the main thing, the unforgettable word that has been engraved in my memory of it. Sensitivity to beauty, to mental progress. ... Sensitivity in the day ofdehumanisation. Therein lies our contribution to all art .... Our Armenia, the sensitivity of Armenia, its understanding and immense experience of bad and good, of the beautiful and ugly, the dead and living is needed by all the world.' (Gorky, February 1944). The fact that the Arshile Gorky exhi- bition at the Whitechapel Art Gallery (closed 25th March)* happened to coincide with the recent unrest in his native Armenia inevitably drew the spectator to focus on an aspect of his art which has received scant attention since his death, namely his often stated insistence on the Armenian in- spiration of all his work. Ever since Gorky was appropriated as one of the pioneers of Abstract Expression- ism, critics and art historians have, with few exceptions, cast him resolutely in the r6le of the 'American Artist'. His achieve- ment was measured solely by the degree to which he was perceived, in the 1940s, to have thrown off the shackles of Euro- pean artistic influences and to have evolved an authentically American abstraction, a 'grand style of automatism' whose mean- ing was located exclusively in the anti- illusionistic gestures and actions of the material surface. In short, Gorky became the formalist hero of abstraction. According to this reading, his entire ieuvre from c. 1927- 42 was either ignored or dismissed as slavish imitations or ill-digested adaptations of European modernism; his legitimisation as a major innovator was inextricably bound up with his assumed rejection of tradition in the last five years of his life, 1943-48. In 1990, after a decade of renewed dia- logue between abstraction and figuration in art, and further prompted by the his- torical events in Eastern Europe, it is at last possible to gain a more balanced view of Gorky's artistic identity. In the generous space of the White- chapel's ground floor, Gorky's passionately honest engagement with C~zanne, Picasso and Mir6 was indeed immediately evident. But even in the earliest synthetic cubist still lifes of c. 1928-30, Gorky's boldly atonal colour juxtapositions are more reminiscent of the jazzy rhythms of the New World than of the subtle harmonies of Paris. In the group of four still lifes dating from 1936-37, a dramatic tension is struck be- tween the cubist-inspired geometric scaf- folding of the composition and the emphatic relief-like quality of the heavily encrusted pigment which makes even Picasso's Three dancers seem tame by comparison. But by far the most intriguing early interaction between Gorky the apprentice and Gorky the individualist is found in the extraordinarily moving portrait of him- self with his mother, the result of a pain- fully slow gestation lasting from 1926-42. It is based on a photograph taken in Van City in 1912, when Gorky was eight years old, and his mother 39. Seven years later she died of starvation in his arms, after they and his sister had marched a hundred and fifty miles to escape massacre by the Turks. It was partly in response to this tragedy that, shortly after following his father and step-sisters to America in 1920, he abandoned his Armenian name, Vos- danik Adoian, and re-christened himself Arshile Gorky, in imitation of the pseudo- nym adopted by the Russian novelist and apparently aware of the Russian meaning of the word - bitterness. The exhibition also included three preparatory drawings for this work, enabling one to chart the artist's confrontation with these poignant memories. In the first sketch, his mother is idealised, engaging the viewer with a wide-eyed gaze and sensuously full lips - far removed from the pained resignation of her regard in the photograph. This madonna-like quality also characterises the composition sketch, though the sensuous mouth now turns down, registering suffering. In the final work it can clearly be seen that he has painted out the lower lip to create a haunted, ghost-like quality. A similar metamorphosis has occurred in his own portrait; the wistful, innocent expression of the first sketch (Fig.95) gives way to the tight-lipped, wildly staring terror of the painting. Yet the mood of anguish con- veyed by the figures is curiously softened by mellow pastel shades of terra-cotta and green earth, to create one of the most quietly intense depictions of emotion in twentieth- century art. It evokes precisely his 1937 statement that 'an appreciative and under- standing tenderness seems to have been largely suffocated in this century's art. And this is exactly what I desire to infuse into my works'. Two of the eight versions of the Garden in Sochi series (1940-43) dominated the end wall. While clearly inspired by Mir6's anthropomorphic abstractions of the 1930s, close examination of the larger of the two, dated '17.4.42', revealed that the final forms of the composition were created by a nega- tive process, by covering up arbitrary sec- tions of a previously painted synthetic cubist composition. The resulting forms have a hesitant, amorphous quality, like larvae in the process of metamorphosing. Now suggestive of bird, fish or plant life, they are also redolent with sexual imagery. Do they hover or float, or are they embedded in the earthy green ooze created out of the yellow-orange and ultramarine blue which dominate the original composition? Also recalling the memory of votive prayers on pieces of cloth tied to the branches of a tree in his father's garden which were be- lieved to have magical healing powers, this work shows Gorky finally beginning to 'open new windows to infinity', as he put it, using a simulated automatist technique. The Whitechapel's upper galleries were devoted to Gorky's last five years: text- book Gorky. The eye was constantly enticed and entralled by the fantastic organic forms and biogenetic hybrids that seem to emerge and dissolve in an endless process in and out of the evanescent veils ofcolour (Fig.96).

Surely they should be seen as embodying the spirit of Paul Klee's dictum that 'the elements should produce forms without being sacrificed in the process'. The works in the final room charted the tragic close to Gorky's life. In February 1948 a fire in his Connecticut studio de- stroyed much of his recent work. A month later, it was discovered that he had cancer. Agony and The betrothal, both 1947, bear testimony to his painful acknowledgement of the disintegration of his body, including his sexuality; of the conflict aroused in him by his impotency and his erotic feel- ings. Fragmentation and dislocation are powerfully conveyed using the most mini- mal of means; fleeting linear forms floating weightlessly over transparent colour hazes.
