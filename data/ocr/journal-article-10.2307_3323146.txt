This analysis focuses on Les formes eldmentaires de la vie religieuse, where Durkheim is obliged to defend the objectivity of representation against the relativist or constructivist implications of his own sociology of knowledge and religion. Despite the aporia in it, the type of ontology required by this text continually presents sound arguments to support the postulate that a social reality exists that is independent of our representations. Though this is not sufficient to resolve all difficulties, it should dissuade us from claiming he "fathered" different or opposed theses simply because he was not fully able to demon- strate a particular one. The question of objectivity is central to current debates in sociology of knowledge on the notions of relativism and social construction. Durkheim regularly serves as a reference in these debates for thinkers whose positions are quite different from each other, from Raymond Boudon to Barry Barnes or David Bloor. It seems worthwhile, therefore, to try to clarify a few points of Durkheim's thinking on the themes in question, and, without a priori delegitimizing readings that "update" Durkheim's thought, to specify which positions in today's debates can legitimately be attributed to him. The notion of objectivity -the objectivity of social reality, of sociology- gives rise to two types of questions in Durkheim's writings. In the first type, found in Les regles de la methode sociologique (1895), objectivity is to be understood in an epistemological sense, as an attribute of scientific discourse. The point is to establish an opposition between observation, comparison, explanation of social facts considered objectively, by means of specific proce- dures, "as things",(1) and methodological individualism, ie, analysis of (1) See Durkheim ([1895a] 1990, in particular chap. II). On Durkheim's discussion of individualism, methodological and other, see Borlandi (1997). On sociological objectification in Les regles de la methode sociologique, see H6ran (1995). 3</page><page sequence="2">Revue frangaise de sociologie subjective motives as explanatory factors. The second type of question is char- acteristic of Durkheim's later thought, and raises the general problem of the objectivity of representations. Here the point is to determine whether a repre- sentation "represents" something, and if so, what; the notion of objectivity is thus enriched with an ontological connotation. The problem is implicit in the hypothesis that "social life [is] made up entirely of representations" (2) and becomes quite clear in Les formes elementaires de la vie religieuse (1912). Given that for Durkheim every representation is intentional, meaning it is a representation "of something", (3) sociological analysis of representation systems such as religions or knowledge categories must demonstrate that they are not free constructions of the mind or imagination, whether individual or collective, but beliefs or concepts that correspond in some way to reality, are endowed with an objective foundation. In other words, Durkheim's notion of objectivity is based on a realist thesis -"there exists a (social) reality inde- pendent of our representations"- that stands in virtual contradiction to his theory of collective representations and the idea that social life is composed entirely of representations. (4) This study analyses how Durkheim tackles the question of the objectivity of representation in Les formes eldmentaires de la vie religieuse, and exami- nes some of the difficulties related to the two aspects of the problem raised by this work. The sociological approach to the theory of knowledge seems to deny the objectivity of collective representations. Can one affirm the social genesis of thought categories without arriving at a relativist position? On the contrary, the sociology of religion requires beliefs to have objective meaning. How can this affirmation be compatible with Durkheim's attribution of a hallucinatory quality to religious representations? Analysis of the definition of totemism as the cult of material objects leads to a number of observations on the type of ontology implied by Durkheim's defense of the objectivity of representation. I explain how this ontology cannot be reduced to an empiricist conception of the reality of social facts and how, in the name of realism, it also precludes the opposite affirmation, the omnipresence of social represen- tations. (2) See Durkheim ([1895a] 1990, p. XI) (preface to the second edition, 1901; 1982, p. 34). (3) The terms "intentional" and "intentionality" (of representation) are always employed here with this meaning. "Intelligence is the faculty of knowing. The act particular to intelligence is the idea. What characterizes intelligence is its representational character. Every idea repre- sents an object." (Durkheim, 1884, lesson 10); "Representations function above all as an expression of a reality not of their own making." ([1897] 1991, p. 245; 1996, pp. 226-227); "Our consciousness cannot be exclusively self-nourishing [...] it requires matter that can only come to it from the outside world." ([1925] 1992, p. 189).

The former, negative determinations generally come down to the synthetic definition devised by the Durkheimian Frangois Simiand: that which is objective is "independent of our individual spontaneity". (5) This does not preclude a tie between that which is objective and the individual's perceptual aptitude, provided that aptitude is essentially receptive or passive. This means that that which is objective is not dependent on praenotiones (Durkheim [1895a] 1990, p. 16; 1982, p. 61), cannot be assimilated to a mental state ([1895b] 1975, p. 96), and cannot be modified through willing ([1895a] 1990, p. 29; 1982, p. 70). (6) That which is "objective" is external to the subject or individual, and resists him ([1895a] 1990, p. 3; 1982, p. 50; [1895b] 1975, p. 99). In positive terms, Durkheim developed a two-fold, convergent definition of the concept. First we read in Les regles that in an objective analysis of a phenomenon, the natural properties inherent in it, above and beyond the ideal notion that we already have of it, are noted, on the basis of signs of constancy and regularity ([1895a] 1990, p. 28; 1982, p. 70). The ingenuous realism implicit in calling the would-be sociologist back to the nature of things is clarified later by reference to the complete set of observers: that which is objective can be observed, communicated, verified ([1895a] 1990, p. 36; 1982, p. 76); see also [1895b] 1975, p. 98). Second, and conversely, Durkheim affirms that the way to leave behind abstract, prejudicial concepts is to return to sensation. (7) However, "sense experience can easily be subjec- tive". To safeguard objectivity, therefore, it is necessary for sensations to have a fixed and fundamentally unvarying "vantage point" [point de repere] which constitutes a touchstone for the variable set of individual, contingent impres- sions ([1895a] 1990, pp. 43-45; 1982, pp. 81-82). The fact that the first, more developed definition restricts the observer to considering only observable reality and that the narrower definition is generalized to include "determined" sensation ([1895b] 1975, pp. 97-98) works to delimit the area of objectivity, making it a sort of intermediate zone between two extremes, the nature of things and subjective sense data, a zone characterized in terms of a collective human form: the complete set of observers or the stable intersection of different points of view. In Les formes lekmentaires de la vie religieuse, resolving the problem of objectivity is one of the stated objectives of the research, ie, reaching the (5) See Simiand (1903, p. 6).

(8) The form of the project is analogous to the one just described for defining objectivity in Les regles de la methode sociologique: namely to stabilize and scientifically study an object that is plural (in this text, beliefs; in the other, sensations); a form of universality (here categories; there the nature of things) that must be shown to be relative but not arbitrary. Religious beliefs and thought categories are, Durkheim stresses, "collective representations"; that is, representations shared by a community of individuals and that are meant to represent that same group. (9) To illustrate how they function, he uses a philo- sophical formula: "Hence, there is a realm of nature in which the formula of idealism is almost literally applicable; that is the social realm. There, far more than anywhere else, the idea [makes] the reality." (ibid., p. 326; ibid., p. 229). The "essential idealism" that social thought is understood to give rise to consists first of all in objectifying an idea by means of a thing in such a way that the idea superimposes a meaning that is independent of the thing's char- acteristic attributes: "Here the role of matter is [reduced to] a minimum." (ibid., pp. 326-327; ibid., p. 229). However, the diversity of cases examined by Durkheim raises a theoretical difficulty. On the one hand we are dealing with specific examples of symbolism, such as churingas, exemplary sacred objects of Australian totemism (rocks or pieces of wood), or a soldier's flag. To say "ideas make reality" in such cases amounts to saying that the collective symbolic system of reference invests material objects with new meaning, conferring properties on them that they would not have in and of themselves. "Reality" here is not co-extensive with being; it is what truly counts in being. The believer ritually handling the sacred piece of wood, the soldier defending the flag at the cost of his life, bracket off other aspects of the world, or reinter- pret them in light of what matters above all to them. The fact that the relativity of symbolic meaning does not call into question (and at the extreme presup- poses) the existence of a reality outside symbolism is a rather ordinary truth, analogous to the truth that different (and even partially untranslatable) terms can be used to speak of one and the same reality. For categories, on the other hand, the assertion that "the idea makes the reality" means that collective representations account for the fact that a thing is thought or thinkable -that it "is"- before it exists. Here reality and being coincide (ibid., pp. 12-13; ibid., pp. 8-9). Moreover, for Durkheim the specific (8) Wherever possible I follow Fields' English translation of Les formes eldmentaires (see bibliography); occasional modifications generally appear in brackets. (9) See for example [1895a] 1990, p. XVII; 1982, p. 40 and [1912] 1990, p. 628; 1995, p. 440. On the notion of "collective represen- tation" and its development, see Nemedi (2000). "Second degree" collectivity (on subject and object, see Durkheim [1912] 1990, p. 628; 1995, p. 440) is what distinguishes collective representations in the original, strict sense of the term as Durkheim defined it from the broad notion common in present-day social psychology of "social representations", defined only in terms of the social aspect of the subject. For a genealogy leading back to Durkheim, see Moscovici (1997). 6</page><page sequence="5">Giovanni Paoletti form of categories is itself due to the social reality they express. The difficulty in this case arises from the fact that being in its entirety is understood to be conceived or judged on the basis of a form characteristic of one of its parts: social reality. From this we can draw two conclusions that either annul or upset what Durkheim seemed to mean by the "objective value" of categories. The first is relativist: What ensures that the part (socially determined catego- ries) produces an objective representation of reality as a whole and not simply a metaphorical one (ibid., pp. 25-28; ibid., pp. 17-18)? The second involves determining the intentionality of representation, the fact that it is always representation of "something", in exclusively self-referential terms: If being is conceivable only by means of categories, it makes no sense to speak of a social reality, or reality altogether, that would be external to collective repre- sentations. The affirmation that such and such representations "express collec- tive realities"(Durkheim and Mauss, [1903] 1969, p. 402 and p. 417) means not that they represent a separate social reality, but rather that fundamentally they only represent themselves. At a crucial moment, the moment when he includes space and time among categories, Durkheim's way of posing the problem of categories links up with that of two thinkers who were strong influences in his training, Charles Renouvier and Octave Hamelin. (10) The thesis in question was of interest to Durkheim because it made possible an understanding of space, time, and cate- gories by means of a single model of sociological explanation, one which had already been tested to satisfaction in an essay written with Marcel Mauss on primitive classificatory forms and another by Henri Hubert on representations of time. (1) For Renouvier and even more markedly for Hamelin, the thesis involved reinterpreting Kant's theory of knowledge in idealist terms. By rejecting "the thing in itself' and reducing the object (in all senses of the word; (12) that is, being itself) to a phenomenon, Renouvier actually ended up defending the anti-realist position that there is no reality independent of our representations: "Representation involves exclusively its own components." ([1894] 1912, vol. 1, p. 21). Thus eliminating the distinction between the receptiveness of the two "pure forms of sensible intuition", space and time, and the spontaneity of mental categories also meant that the difference was eliminated between what is knowable -the object of experience, the phenome- non according to Kant- and what is unknowable, whose existence can only be conceived: "noumena". (13) Instead of being valid only for the area of know- ledge, Renouvier's table of categories thus extended to the entire category of (10) See Durkheim ([1912] 1990, p. 13n and p. 15; 1995, p. 8n. and p. 10). See also Pickering and N6medi (1995), and Stedman Jones (2000). (11) See Hubert (1905). See Hertz (1909) (quoted in Durkheim [1912] 1990, p. 17; 1995, p. 12n.). (12) It should be recalled that Kant distin- guished between two meanings: as phenomenon (that is, the object of sensible intuition) and as the thing in itself; see Kant ([1781] 1998, preface to the second edition [1787], pp. 110-111) (AK, III, p. 17 in Berlin Academy edition). (13) This is obvious given that for Kant we can readily conceive the reality of objects that do not fit into categories and are foreign to space and time. Such objects remain neces- sarily unknowable only to us, not, perhaps, for someone else. 7</page><page sequence="6">Revue frangaise de sociologie being, and objectivity came to have meaning only as a kind of analytic predi- cate of representation. Equating representation and reality, that is, negating the realist thesis, is perhaps defensible at a theoretical level if we consider the table of categories in absolute terms as the metaphysical structure of the real. But when one intends as Durkheim did to show the socially determined nature of categories, their relative, non-absolute character, then the absence of a reference point outside representation inevitably brings their objective value into doubt: What are categories relative to? If one refuses to settle for an exclusively self-refer- ential sociology of knowledge -society relative to itself, representing only itself- then it seems necessary first to reestablish the realist thesis, then to demonstrate that the social relativity of categories thesis successfully accounts for the essential properties of categorical judgment, namely univer- sality and necessity. (14) Let us deal with this last point first. Durkheim's sociology of knowledge requires a different meaning for categorical universality and necessity than their ontological one, according to which they are a function of the human species' innate classifying faculty. (15) Durkheim need not go beyond Kant's terminology to accomplish this. The "strict" (strenge) and "unrestricted" (unbeschrdnkte) universality of a priori principles, while given for mathe- matics and physics propositions, (16) can also for Kant take a potential form, that of moral law, whose universal validity is expressed through the possibility of universalizing a subjective maxim: "Act as if thy maxim were to serve like- wise as the universal law (of all rational beings)." (17) It is this mode of exis- tence for universality -as potential rather than given- that is relevant for Durkheim's collective representations: "a concept is universal, or at least universalizable" (Durkheim, [1912] 1990, p. 619; 1995, p. 435). On the basis of Kant's distinction, then, Durkheim assimilates the case of categories to that of moral law, interpreting the absolute universality of time, space, causality, etc., in terms of potential universality. "Indeed, their stability [the stability of categories] and impersonality are such that they have often been taken to be absolutely universal and immutable." (ibid., p. 627; ibid., p. 441; my italics). This does not, however, make categorical necessity a sort of relative or inductive universality similar to that of empirical judgments, (14) This is precisely what Durkheim claims ([1912] 1990, pp. 19-20; 1995, p. 13). (15) Against innateness, see in particular Durkheim ([1912] 1990, p. 21n; 1995, p. 14n). For the opposite hypothesis, see the review of L 'Annie sociologique, VI, in Revue de mitaphysique et de morale, 1903, XI, Nov., supplement, pp. 11-12 (attributed to E. Hal6vy). (16) See Kant ([1781] 1998, introduction, section II, p. 137 and p. 138) (AK, III, p. 29). (17) See Kant ([1785] 1987, p. 67) (AK, IV, p. 438). It goes without saying that reference to the Kantian notion of universal is necessarily sketchy here, as its purpose is to clarify Durkheim's conceptual instrumentation; see Durkheim ([1893] 1975, pp. 258-260), where the criterion for maxim universalizability is discussed in detail, leading to the conclusion that it is not a sufficient condition for defining moral law. On this point see Landucci (1994, pp. 109-110). On Durkheim and the concept of the "kingdom of ends", see Watts Miller (1996, pp. 185-206). 8</page><page sequence="7">Giovanni Paoletti which are only universal as long as the most recent experience has not belied them. Durkheim's argument is aimed instead at replacing the idea of unique, abstract human rationality with a plurality of possible universalities -ways of conceiving space, time, etc.- corresponding to a plurality of actual societies (Karsenti, 1999, p. 404). At the same time as such multiplicity contradicts the actual universality and necessity of a priori synthetic judgments, it presup- poses that we can still use the term universal for what is not effective but potential. Using terms that can recall Kant's "kingdom of ends" (Reich der Zwecke, royaume des fins) - "the union of different rational beings in a system by common laws" (8)- Durkheim speaks of categories as a "common ground [lieu commun] where all minds meet" ([1912] 1990, p. 19; 1995, p. 13). Whereas for Kant the kingdom of ends is "a world of rational beings (mundus intelligibilis)" that remains universal even if only possible, (19) categories constitute for Durkheim "a whole world of stable ideals, the common ground [lieu commun] of intelligences". (20) But what is this common ground? Denying individual experience any foun- dational role, Durkheim goes beyond demanding logical priority for abstract universality, specifying: "It is not my time that is organized in this way; it is time as it is objectively conceived by all men of the same civilization." ([1912] 1990, p. 14; 1995, p. 10). In Durkheim's terminology, "civilization", which he prefers to use in the plural, designates organic social units that do not coincide with political groupings but are characterized by a defined set of symbolic and material conditions, a moral milieu in the broad sense that Durkheim attributes to that expression. (21) Linking the objectivity of a cate- gory to the context of a civilization satisfies the apparently paradoxical demand of conceiving a kind of universality that is limited or determined in space and time. Civilization, "the integral system of human representations at a given moment" (Durkheim, 1909, p. 757), appears to him the context within which conceptual operations become both possible -"To conceptualize a thing is simultaneously to apprehend its essential elements better and to place it [with]in a [whole], for each civilization is characterized by its own organized system of concepts." (Durkheim, [1912] 1990, p. 622; 1995, p. 437)- and objective: "A collective representation, because it is collective, already pre- sents assurances of objectivity." (ibid., p. 625; ibid., p. 439). In sum, Durkheim's definition of the sociology of knowledge seems condemned to lead to an aporia, or at least a state that contradicts the claim or ambition of scientificity. The sociological idealism described in certain (18) Kant ([1785] 1987, p. 62) (AK IV, p. 433; definition of "kingdom"). Durkheim used Barni's 1848 French translation of Grundlegung zur Metaphysik der Sitten. (19) See Kant ([1785] 1987, p. 67) (AK IV, pp. 438-439). (20) See Durkheim ([1912] 1990, p. 622; 1995, p. 437). See Windelband (1875, p. 169): "At the beginning the distinction between true and false thoughts must have been linked to an entirely external reality criterion, general identification, the correspondence in represen- tations of different persons." (the article by Windelband is quoted in Durkheim [1912] 1990, p. 18n; 1995, p. 12n.; my translation).

Either it endows such objectivity with a metaphysical rather than sociological foundation, or it denies it sociologically. Nonetheless, Durkheim's thinking on the notion of "civilization", together with the distinction between absolute (or actual) universal and potential universal, provides important matter for a solution. Accepting a potential universal makes it possible to see the universalizability of a concept as non-contradictory with the plurality and historical-social rela- tivity of representation systems. The objectivity of a collective representation will thus depend on the possibility of conceiving that representation as universal at least within a given "civilization", "a world of stable ideals", even if that world, like the kingdom of ends, is "only possible" or is different from other existing worlds of the same nature. (22) "Well-founded delirium" "To understand a [case of delirium] properly and to be able to apply the most appropriate treatment, the doctor needs to know what its point of depar- ture was." (Durkheim, [1912] 1990, p. 10; 1995, p. 6). Durkheim's linking of the study of religions with the practice of the alieniste shows above all that the believer's point of view does not have explanatory value when it comes to religious phenomena. Does this necessarily mean that religious beliefs are mere misunderstandings or illusions? On the contrary, Durkheim thought they had objective meaning, and even suggested that thought categories themselves had a religious origin (ibid., p. 3). To discover this meaning, what was needed was simply a more reliable point of view than the believer's. However, having recourse to the scientific viewpoint still left him open to a petitio principii, since the objectivity of abstract thought, according to Durkheim, was genetically derived from that of religious representations, ie from the demonstrandum. If we answer, as Durkheim in fact did, (23) that religious representations obey prac- tical necessities only, not theoretical ones, we would be sidestepping the problem, since, as we have been told, representations are always representa- tions of something; they always have a cognitive or speculative aspect. The comparison with the alieniste contains another paradox: whereas discovering the objective cause of a case of madness makes it possible to measure the great distance between pathology and a normal relation to reality, the doctor must also apply therapy, which is a means of making the phenomenon itself disappear. The search initiated by the postulate of objectivity would thus seem itself to lead to the discovery that there is no objectivity at all. (22) On the idea of multiple possible worlds it is interesting to note the importance Durkheim attributes to Leibniz in the Coursfait au lycde de Sens (1884; for example, lesson 14). See also Paoletti (1992). (23) Durkheim puts this response clearly: "We represent the sun as a flat disk measuring a few centimetres [...], the wind as breath, etc. The scientist frees himself from what seems obvious, replacing these false if practically useful notions with completely different ones." (1920, p. 92). See also Durkheim ([1893] 1975, p. 69). 10</page><page sequence="9">Giovanni Paoletti Durkheim uses three alieniste notions, all of which address the problem of a subject's distorted relation to objectivity: illusion, hallucination, and delirium. After alluding to them through the pars destruens of Les formes elMmentaires de la vie religieuse (1912, book I, chaps. 1-3) to criticize the tradition of equating religion with illusion, (24) Durkheim returns to them in book II, chapter 7, a central chapter, underscoring this time the similarity between the two phenomena. This apparent inconsistency is cleared up if we take into account the fact that he is using the technical meaning of the terms in question. It may have been from Brierre de Boismont, one of the most impor- tant medical sources for Suicide, that he learned the distinction between an illusion, which always originates in a real sensation, and a hallucination. An illusion involves misinterpreting a real perception of an existing object; a hallucination is an imagined perception of an absent object. (25) Delirium is defined as a more general mental state, uncontrollable though most often temporary, in which the various perceptual and intellectual faculties are detached from each other (Esquirol, 1822). Thus defined, the notions of illu- sion, hallucination, and delirium partake of distinct psychological domains. The first is an isolated sensory disorder which, though it may occur frequently, is readily corrected by more attentive observation; the other two bring into play a belief, not merely perceptual but psychic (intellectual), that in most cases implies an entire system of dominant ideas. (26) In the pars construens, this nosological grid appears in two cross-refe- renced passages, one in book II, chapter 7, the other in chapter 2 of book III, which discusses the theory of sacrifice. The argumentative structure of the two is identical and may be analysed into four steps. 1) The thesis that reli- gion is illusory is rejected; the believer "is not the dupe of an illusion" (Durkheim [1912] 1990, p. 322; 1995, p. 227); on the contrary, his behaviour manifests "sense and moral import" (ibid., p. 496; ibid., p. 351). 2) Nothing, however, can assure us that that sense is not simply elaborated subjectively with no equivalent in the real, ie, that it is anything other than "a play of hallu- (24) Among authors relevant for Durkheim in addition to those cited explicitly (Max, Miiller, Frazer, Tylor), see Guyau (1887, p. 42 and p. 64); Marillier (1902a, p. 347 and p. 356); Levy-Bruhl (1910, pp. 8-9 and p. 55ff); Renouvier (1879, pp. 29-30, p. 220, and p. 232), who locates the domain of illusions in magic; and Hubert (1904, p. XLIII). (25) See Brierre de Boismont (1845), in which the history of the distinction is also traced, starting with the Englishman Arnold (1806). See Durkheim ([1897] 1991, p. 27, p. 31, and p. 33); Besnard (2000); and for medical statistics sources, Borlandi (2000). In Le suicide Durkheim also uses Esquirol's treaty, Des maladies mentales (1838), which contains a study entitled Hallucinations (1817) that fixes the distinction for France; see also Illusion and Hallucination entries in Lalande's dictionary of philosophy, which attest that the distinction was still being debated when Les formes ele'mentaires was published. For a recent study see Bodei (2000, particularly pp. 45-52). (26) The French word delire is particularly difficult to translate; neither "delirium" or "delusion" seems a satisfactory equivalent (see Lutzky et al., 1997-1999). Understanding the term requires taking into account both the contexts in which Durkheim used it and the technical meaning it had in the medical lite- rature of the period. Here it was decided to translate ddlire systematically "delirium", which follows Fields' stated preference though she occasionally used "delusion". 11</page><page sequence="10">Revue frangaise de sociologie cinatory images" (ibid., p. 496; ibid., p. 351), "the product of a certain [delirium]" (ibid., p. 323; ibid., p. 227; note the contiguity between hallucina- tion and delirium). 3) Durkheim agrees with the objection: in a certain sense, religion is delirium, but a "well-founded delirium" (ibid., p. 324; ibid., p. 228) because in its own way it represents the objective reality of the society (ibid., p. 497; ibid., p. 352). 4) Moreover, if we look carefully, we could paradoxi- cally affirm that all mental elaborations whose raw material is the immediate data of sensible intuition constitute a kind of delirium, given that they move away from reality in itself; therefore, all collective representations, and with them our own representation of the external world, are "a fabric of hallucina- tions" (ibid., p. 325; ibid., p. 229). Durkheim founds the similarity between religion and delirium or hallucina- tion on the following shared features. Hallucinations have a contextual aspect that illusions do not. Their meaning cannot be reduced to the isolated, linear sequence of a subject receiving a sensory impression; indeed they have "a moral import"; that is, they acquire meaning from a whole set of shared notions and values. If religious beliefs were strictly "illusory", they could be demystified through more attentive observation of sense data, of which any individual is in principle capable. On the contrary, for Durkheim the meaning of religious beliefs is due to a system or context of ideas produced by collec- tive interaction, not by convergence of different individual mental elabora- tions (see point 1 above). Delirium and hallucination involve more than illusion, for with them perceptual activity as a whole, not just isolated sensations, is implicated in a pathology. From an epistemological perspective, that means there is even more cause to doubt the objectivity of representation. Whereas illusion by definition presupposes the presence of an object external to the origin of sensation, the ideational system involved in hallucination or delirium seems to contain within it all the necessary conditions for presenting ex nihilo an entirely fantasmatic objectivity. It is for this reason that refuting the illusory nature of religion, which Durkheim does on the basis of the existence of worship objects, does not in itself preclude religion from having something in common with delirium (see point 2, the irreality of objectivity itself). Durkheim's answer to this, namely that the existence of social reality is enough to make this delirium "well-founded" (point 3), is not yet satisfactory: what is there to ensure that society itself, recognized and identified by the sociologist behind the veil of beliefs, is not a fiction? This can explain the final reversal of the objection, ie, the attribution of positive epistemological value to delirium and hallucination (point 4). And this reversal, which proves the precondition for the entire argument, is based on recognition of the constructive character of all representational activity, including the scientific variety. This is the second specific property of the kinship tie between religion and delirium. Gnoseological constructivism (prior to social constructivism) is thus what is at issue in the analogy between religion and delirium/hallucination. Beyond his philosophical sources -Taine for the thesis that perception is really hallu- 12</page><page sequence="11">Giovanni Paoletti cination; also, among neo-Kantians, Victor Brochard (27)_ it is crucial to point out that Durkheim's version of constructivism is, despite what an intuitive conception of such a notion would lead us to assume, not at all incompatible with the realist thesis that there exists a reality independent of our representa- tions. In the introduction Durkheim explicitly lays out his position on this point, position based on the postulate of an isomorphic relation between society and nature. Because society is a natural realm, the artificial compo- nent of the concepts it constructs "is an artifice that closely follows nature and strives to come ever closer to nature" (Durkheim, [1912] 1990, p. 26, p. 18, and pp. 25-28; 1995, p. 17, p. 12, pp. 17-18). The implications of the nosological analogy make possible yet another argument in favor of compatibility between constructivism and realism. The constructive character of representation does not in itself imply that the "construction materials" are also constructed. To explain totemism, says Durkheim, is "to discover what could have led men to construct this idea and with what [materials] they constructed it." (28) At an even more fundamental level, the very notion of hallucination presupposes the existence of an external reality in relation to which the representation is defined as hallucinatory (a point unaffected by the fact that no representation can be perfectly adequate to reality). In other words, the very notion of hallucination can occur only in a metalanguage: 1) distinct from the language available to the subject of the hallucination (for him, the hallucination is reality) and 2) that encompasses the realism thesis. (29) The thesis that every representation of the external world has a hallucina- tory component to it is discussed in a well-known passage that is worth citing in full: "There is a sense, of course, in which our representation of the external world is itself nothing but a fabric of hallucinations. The odors, tastes, and colors that we place in bodies are not there, or at least are not there in the way we perceive them. Nevertheless, our sensations of smell, taste, and sight do correspond to certain objective states of the things represented. After a fashion, they do express the properties either of [material particles] or move- ments of the ether that really do have their origin in the bodies we perceive as being fragrant, tasty, or colorful. But collective representations very often impute to the things to which they refer properties that do not exist in any form or to any degree whatsoever. From the most commonplace object, they can make a sacred and very powerful being." (30) According to Durkheim, the logic of collective representations constitutes an extreme version of the logic of secondary qualities (odors, tastes, colors, and so forth) which in turn is different in degree but not in nature from the (27) See Taine ([1870] 1906, vol. 1, p. 408); quoted in Durkheim (1884, lesson 12) and Brochard (1879). (28) See Durkheim ([1912] 1990, p. 293; 1995, p. 207); see Searle (1998, p. 243). (29) On the contrary, there are illusions that continue to be produced even if the subject is conscious of the illusory nature of the phenomenon, as in the classic example of refraction (the stick that appears broken when partially immersed in water). (30) Durkheim ([1912] 1990, pp. 325-326; 1995, p. 229). See Pickering (2000, pp. 101- 102). 13</page><page sequence="12">Revue franqaise de sociologie conceptual structure of primary qualities. (31) Durkheim's comparison aims to show both that collective representations are formed according to the percep- tion model and that they arise from the normal functioning of the representing apparatus. The reader of the passage is thus invited to conclude by analogy that just as secondary qualities do indeed refer to the same objects that primary qualities identify differently, more rigorously, so the hallucinatory component characterizing collective representations does not dissolve their tie to the objective reality of what they represent. Here Durkheim could count on the firm authority of his implicit model, readily recognized at this point as Descartes' thesis in the sixth metaphysical meditation that knowledge that comes to us through the senses teaches us nothing of what the object really is (quid est) but does allow us to know that that object is (quod est). (32) This is the same type of relative or partial veracity -limited to the object's existence- that Durkheim attributes from then on to collective representations: "The believer is not deceiving himself [lefiddle ne s 'abuse pas] when he believes in the existence of a moral power to which he is subject and from which he receives what is best in himself. That power exists; it is society." ([1912] 1990, p. 322; 1995, p. 226). Instead of establishing an essential difference between perceptions and collective representations, Durkheim, in the propositions of the passage cited above underscoring the particular creative force of collective representations, poses the following problem: If each representation is at least in part constructed, how can one construction be distinguished from another, one hallucination from another? It does seem obvious -and therefore at least the consequence of a strong universal collective representation- that a molecular structure, a rainbow, and a totemic idol do not present the same type or degree of objectivity. In the particular case of social facts, for example, not only the form of the representation but the very material of which it is composed is revealed to be constructed rather than given. It is this which seems to lead to the fundamental thesis of the work: religious beliefs are symbols or represen- tations of society. To recapitulate, while the problem of objectivity in Les formes elementaires de la vie religieuse seems to involve an increasing number of difficulties, we can note the following progress: the constructivist implica- tions of Durkheim's notion of representation are not a priori incompatible with the realist thesis, which seems the minimum condition for affirming the objectivity of collective representations in a non-ordinary or self-referential (31) On this point see particularly penetrating studies by Melandri (1991) and Gargani (1978). (32) The passage just cited ("The odors, tastes, and colors that we place in bodies are not there, or at least are not there in the way we perceive them. Nevertheless, our sensations of smell, taste, and sight do correspond to certain objective states of the things represented.") corresponds to the following statement by Descartes: "Indeed, as I perceive different sorts of colors, sounds, odors, tastes, heat, hardness, etc., I safely conclude that there are, in the bodies from which the diverse perceptions of the senses proceed, certain varieties corre- sponding to them, although, perhaps, not in reality like them." (Descartes, [1641] 1999, p. 493 [trans. John Veitch, 1901]). 14</page><page sequence="13">Giovanni Paoletti sense. This is a negative condition, symmetrical to that illustrated at the end of the last paragraph: all we can say is that Durkheim can affirm the plurality of category systems (relativism) and the hallucinatory character of religious and non-religious representations (constructivism) without being logically forced to deny the thesis that there exists an external reality to which collective representations may refer (realism). For this last proposition to be more than a mere postulate, it is necessary to close the space between lack of refutation and demonstration. Totemism, or adoration of objects I will not provide any such demonstration. My aim is less ambitious: to formulate the problem of objectivity as precisely as the components of Durkheim's own thinking in Les formes elementaires de la vie religieuse permit. While this does not suffice to resolve all the problems raised by his procedure, it should dissuade us from attributing different and even opposed theses to him simply because he did not manage to fully demonstrate a parti- cular one. I have already pointed out that the notion of objectivity raises specific theoretical problems for each of the main arguments in his work -sociology of knowledge and of religion- considered separately. Are these simply heterogeneous, juxtaposed domains where "objectivity" means substantially different things, or is it possible to analyse the problem in terms of a common, even unitary conceptual basis? The aforecited argument on the essential practical function of religion suggests that we should prefer the first of the two alternative propositions: religion and science have different func- tions, the first practical, the second theoretical. But Durkheim's insistence on the genetic continuity between religious beliefs and abstract notions would tend to make us choose the second proposition, as would his observation that every religion is a cosmology, ie, a representation of the external world (Durkheim, [1912] 1990, p. 12; 1995, p. 8). In general, we should be able to define the question on the basis of the elementary form of religion that is Durkheim's entire concern in this book: totemism. The notion of totemism is inseparable from the debate on primitive religion that engaged the field of religious science through the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In book I, chapters 2 and 3 of Les formes elementaires de la vie religieuse, Durkheim presents the major theses: animism as characterized by E. B. Taylor (1871) as a projection onto the cosmos of the idea of a multiplicity of souls or spirits, and "naturism", a term no longer used that designated the classical idea that religion originated in the divinization of forces of nature such as the sun, rain, and stars (M. Milller, 1856, and A. Kuhn, 1859). What unified these theories, which we may term empiricist, was precisely what made them unacceptable to Durkheim, namely the anachronistic postulate that religion was no more than a rudimentary, imperfect attempt -which thereby reflected the intellectual nature of primi- tives- to explain natural or empirical phenomena, such as thunder, eclipses, 15</page><page sequence="14">Revue frangaise de sociologie dreams, and shadows, that were experienced as mysterious or exceptional. From this perspective, religion is the negative of science in much the same way illusion might be said to be the negative of perception: it is science deprived of its objectivity. This understanding is incompatible with Durkheim's inclusion of religion among social institutions. (33) As for totemism, Van Gennep's doctoral thesis (1920) linking each of more than 150 authors with one or more of twenty main interpretive hypotheses clearly shows how desperately complicated the range of positions was. Durkheim's position, labeled "emblematic-collectivist", was far from the majority one (ibid., p. 341, summary table). Nevertheless, it is possible to give an elementary synthetic definition of the totem that almost all commentators would have accepted: "We designate by the word totem a class of material objects, usually animal or vegetal species, that members of a clan believe to be linked to the group they belong to..." (Marillier, 1902b). The description of totemism as worship of material objects is the most fundamental element in this definition, while being distinct from two other properties that were already a matter of debate: 1) the idea that what is worshipped is not isolated objects but "classes", 2) namely animal or vegetal species. Though apparently quite slight, the first determination of totemism, as worship of material objects, is sufficient to distinguish it from empiricist theories of primitive religion, defined in terms of a need to explain processes, ie, chains of phenomena, rather than objects or even classes or categories of objects. On the contrary, since this is adoration of things, it seems consistent to link totemism with fetishism, as indeed it seemed so to the earliest observers. (34) We need only compare the preceding definition with that of fetishism proposed by Charles de Brosses ([1760] 1988, p 15): "These fetishes are nothing other than the first material object that it pleases each nation or particular to choose and to make sacred through a ceremony conducted by its priests: a tree, a mountain, the sea, a piece of wood, a lion's tail, a pebble, a shell, some salt, a fish, a plant, a flower, an animal of a parti- cular species, such as a cow, goat, elephant, sheep, and anything of the sort one can imagine." Whereas Durkheim considered fetishism a pseudo-scientific category, (35) he takes off from the same point: "There is hardly anything in nature that has not served as a totem to some group." (Durkheim, 1902, p. 319). This explains (33) "Indeed, it is an fundamental postulate of sociology that a human institution cannot rest upon error and falsehood. If it did it, it could not endure." (Durkheim, [1912] 1990, p. 3; 1995, p. 2). (34) This as early as McLennan, the first theorist of totemism: see Levi-Strauss (1962, p. 18). See also Marillier (1902b). As attested in his letter to Mauss of July 10, 1899, Durkheim was struck early on by the impor- tance of adoring things, and therefore the analogy between totemism and fetishism, specifically on reading Spencer and Gillen's first work in Australian ethnography (1899): "This work contains facts of great interest. The relations between totem and things (other than totemic) are clear. There is a fetishism -indis- tinguishable from current fetishism- whose origins and totemic character are indisputable." (Durkheim, 1998, p. 224). (35) See his criticism -"The truth is that the notions of fetish and fetishism do not corre- spond to anything definite." (Durkheim [1912] 1990, p. 227n and p. 250; 1995, p. 161n and 16</page><page sequence="15">Giovanni Paoletti his broad delimitation of the domain of the sacred: "A rock, a tree, a spring, a pebble, a piece of wood, a house, in a word anything can be sacred." ([1912] 1990, p. 51; 1995, p. 35). Noting the similarities between Durkheim's and Brosses' definitions also brings to light that the ordinariness of worship objects is complementary to the fact that what is "chosen" is quite indifferent (Brosses: "the first material object it pleases them to choose"; Durkheim: "anything" [une chose quelconque]). Fetishism and totemism would seem to disprove empiricist theories of primitive religion by involving not only worship of material things but worship of ordinary material things. Because the disposition to be an object of worship applies to all objects indifferently, fetishes and totems seem foreign to both analysis of a sequence of events -on the contrary, attention is fixed on things, objects- and perception of any exceptionalness: the objects are normal, ordinary. Religions of this type cannot readily be interpreted as a rough version of scientific explanation. Indeed, their relation to worship objects must be situated at a more fundamental level than explanation: they call into play not causal links among phenomena, but the elementary forms of constituting and apprehending things. However, in Durkheim's version of totemism -and contrary to the para- digm of fetishism, where the worshippers' relation to worship objects tends to be defined in economic-utilitarian terms (do ut des)- the material object is adored because it symbolizes the social group. Durkheim goes so far as to affirm that "the images of the totemic being are more sacred than the totemic being itself" ([1912] 1990, p. 189; 1995, p. 133). From this it follows first and foremost that the fact that the object chosen is indifferent is interpreted in very different ways for totemism and fetishism, ways that are different even axiologically. In fetishism, the choice is an effect of individual will and capri- cious imagination. The savage institutes a private, utilitarian idolatry, using things that would be the least worthy of all to be adored: ordinary, valueless things. In totemism as Durkheim (and Robertson Smith before him) under- stood it, the indifference of the object choosen indicates that the relation between worshippers and worshipped object is codified; that is, that it is subjected to a process of normalization common to the members of a given community. The objects of totemic worship are considered from within a collective symbolic context, and this context gives them a second meaning, or makes meaningful what was once opaque or indifferent. (36) p. 177)- which follows Mauss's assertion in 1907 that there was a "huge misunderstanding" on the definition of fetishism (Mauss, 1969, II, p. 245); see Iacono (1992, pp. 116-120). Among those to discuss the issue prior to Durkheim, see particularly Robertson Smith ([1889] 1927, p. 209) and Renouvier (1880a and 1880b). Durkheim's main source of infor- mation nonetheless seems to have been F. Schultze's Der Fetischismus (1871), which explained fetishism in terms of four psycholo- gical operations said to be typical of the savage: exaggerated esteem for objects of no importance, anthropomorphism of said objects, identification of said objects with the causes of certain experiences, the conviction that the objects demand to be adored. (36) See Durkheim ([1907] 1975, p. 91). See Robertson Smith ([1889] 1927, pp. 124-125). 17</page><page sequence="16">Revue frangaise de sociologie In other words, the logic at work in totemism is identical to the more general logic of collective representations: "the idea makes the reality". While the convergence of apparently unrelated inquiries and analyses toward the same "arrival point" shows the unitariness of the problem of objectivity in Les formes e'lkmentaires de la vie religieuse, the question, in its new form, remains: What is the status of objectivity in totemic symbolism? We can always answer simply -and powerfully- thus: To dispel the apparent mystery of objectivity all we need do is understand religion and science as two different forms of symbolic thinking, as science, too, uses symbols. (37) This would also mean reducing the interpretation of the totemic object as symbol of a clan to the equivalent of fairly unproblematic propositions such as "H is the symbol for hydrogen" or "the President of the Republic is the symbol of national unity". That in turn would mean symbolism is no more than a way of translating a complex reality into a system of signs that make it recognizable, comprehensible, wieldable. But we would still have to understand why symbols in totemism are ordi- nary material objects and not, for example, major natural forces, which would seem able to express much more satisfactorily the great moral authority that society exercises on its members (Durkheim, [1912] 1990, pp. 295-301; 1995, pp. 208-213). How we interpret Durkheim's theory of symbolism then depends in part on how we evaluate the following definition: a symbol is "a [material] expression of something else" (ibid., p. 294; ibid., p. 208). (38) We can focus immediately on the fact that a symbol expresses something else and reduce the notion of symbol to that of representation in the broad sense, with its qualities and difficulties. (39) Or we can assume that the word "material" is in fact crucial to Durkheim's definition and ask whether this doesn't give the notion of symbol a narrower and more specific meaning than representa- tion. (40) These options are not symmetrical: whereas the first tends to make the second irrelevant, the second does not at all exclude the first. Using terms that recall Spinoza -"mere modalities", "various modes of the totemic being"- Durkheim subjects sacred objects to a single, impersonal spiritual principle, the mana, (41) while providing arguments to explain the fact that totemic worship involves material objects ([1912] 1990, book 2, chap. 7). Some are epistemological: totems/symbols work to make conceivable or visible the complex and "fleeting" reality that is society ([1895a] 1990, p. 46; 1982, p. 83); they work to recall the feelings of belonging that arise in (37) See Durkheim ([1895b] 1975, pp. 106- 107, and [1912] 1990, pp. 25-26; 1995, p. 17). (38) Here and elsewhere, Fields translates the French adjective matiriel "tangible", thereby missing an important point of Durkheim's argument. (39) On this point Pickering's analysis (1984) remains essential; see in particular pages 275-299. See also Tarot (1999). (40) For a more detailed argument in support of this hypothesis see Paoletti (1998). (41) Durkheim ([1912] 1990, p. 213, p. 219; 1995, p. 151, p. 155). Mana is "an impersonal god, without name, without history, immanent in the world, diffused in a numberless multitude of things" (ibid., p. 269; ibid., p. 191). See (ibid., p. 274; ibid., p. 194): "The idea of a single religious force that unifies the universe, all that is; all the other sacred principles are but modalities of that force." 18</page><page sequence="17">Giovanni Paoletti moments of social "effervescence" ([1912] 1990, pp. 314-316, pp. 329-330; 1995, pp. 220-221, pp. 231-232). There is only one argument that is sharply ontological and therefore at the same conceptual level as the notion of objec- tivity. It consists in claiming that the interaction among individuals out of which society arises (42) is only possible "with the help of [material] interme- diaries" which therefore necessarily not only express collective representa- tions but "also contribute to [their] making": "Individual minds can meet and commune only if they come outside themselves. But they can only externalise themselves through movement [...] [O]nce these movements have taken a definite form and been stereotyped, they serve to symbolize the corresponding representations. But these movements symbolize those representations only because they have helped to form them. Without symbols, moreover, social feelings could have only a precarious existence." (43) This argument presupposes that symbols are distinct from both representa- tion in the broad sense and from systems of signs. What characterizes symbols is their material component ("material intermediaries"). According to the traditional philosophical argument that Durkheim is implicitly using here, matter is the necessary condition for the reality of movement ("they can only externalise themselves through movement")(44) and therefore for the very existence of society, existence which would otherwise be precarious. Further- more, the particular structure of symbols means that they are individual enti- ties, the union of an ideal form and a material substratum; that is, things, or more exactly, substances. (45) In the logic of symbolism, the vast epistemological meaning of "object", encompassing, for example, universals and ideas as objects of representation, tends to be reduced to the definition of object as individual, separate substance, or union of matter with form. This makes possible a few clarifications of the status of objectivity in symbolism. As we have seen, the idealistic, hallucinatory character of collec- tive representations (together with the difficulties this produces) consists for Durkheim in their ability to completely transfigure their objects, to transform "the most commonplace object" into "a sacred and very powerful being" ([1912] 1990, p. 326; 1995, p. 229). It is precisely the material nature of symbols that determines the limit of this creative force, the limit beyond which the idea no longer makes reality. The determination is minimal -"the role of matter is reduced to a minimum"; in symbolism, only two attributes of (42) On the production of social facts see Borlandi (1995). (43) Durkheim ([1912] 1990, p. 330; 1995, p. 232 [trans. slightly modified]). The suppo- sition that not merely the communicative but the productive function, that of communing [communier], is at the heart of Durkheimian theory seems attested to by Mauss: "Durkheim and I have long taught that the only way for men to commune and communicate with each other is by symbols." ([1924] 1991, p. 294). (44) The classical reference here is to book I of Aristotle's Physics. See Durkheim (1884, lesson 14), where he seems quite close to the Aristotelian conception, and to Leibniz's idea of matter as passive force, inertia or resistance ("unconscious force"). (45) "Nowhere can a collective feeling become conscious of itself without fixing upon a material object; but by that very fact, it partic- ipates in the nature of that object, and vice versa." (Durkheim, [1912] 1990, p. 339; 1995, p. 238). 19</page><page sequence="18">Revue frangaise de sociologie matter that do not pertain to collective representations are retained: the condi- tion of movement and the principium individuationis of symbols. (46) It is, however, fundamental in the economy of the problem of objectivity, because it provides if not an exhaustive demonstration, at least an argument in favor of the existence of a reality external to collective representations. Despite the relativist and constructivist implications of collective representations, all that society is composed of, they are not only not incompatible with the realist thesis but require the existence of external reality as a necessary condition for their own existence. We can therefore say of reality in general what Durkheim says explicitly of the historical-social factors of logical thought: "We do not know exactly what these factors are, but we can presume that they exist." ([1912] 1990, p. 18; 1995, p. 12). What is this reality, in fact? Science is both absolutely obligated to raise that question and precluded from considering it definitively resolved, because "the real is inexhaustible, not only in its entirety but in each of its constituant parts" (Durkheim, [1913-1914] 1955, p. 185). In any case, we have come a ways from the aporia contained in the question of the objectivity of collective representations, aporia that seemed to suggest that the problem was in fact radically irresolvable and thus not even worth posing. In conclusion, a few theoretical statements concerning how Durkheim takes on the problem of the objectivity of representation in general and of collective representations in particular in Les formes elementaires de la vie religieuse: 1) Collective representations have by definition a self-referential compo- nent because they represent society, itself composed of representations. This does not mean, however, that collective representations are solely self-referen- tial. On the contrary, their intentionality (the fact of being representations "of something") also necessarily refers to a reality external to representation. This reality cannot be immediately identified with social reality, but is rather the ontological foundation presupposed by social reality. In this sense, Durkheim's thesis constitutes a version of of Barry Barnes' that "the know- ledge that constitutes society is self-referring". (47) Indeed, Durkheim's would seem a strong version of this same thesis, since in his thinking the epistemological level of reference (or self-reference) is closely linked to onto- logical implications. Through the intermediary of reference to external reality, collective representations go beyond expressing social reality; they help produce it: "Thus, in all its aspects and at every moment of its history, social (46) See Durkheim ([1912) 1990, p. 386; 1995, p. 273), where he describes the genesis of the notion of person: "If there are to be separate personalities, another factor must intervene which fragments and differentiates this principle [the spiritual principle]; in other words, a factor of individuation is necessary. The body plays this role." (47) Barnes (1988, pp. 46-54); see Montuschi (1999, pp. 236-238), and Bloor (2000, pp. 159-161). 20</page><page sequence="19">Giovanni Paoletti life is only possible thanks to a vast symbolism." (Durkheim, [1912] 1990, p. 331; 1995, p. 233). 2) The ontology supposed by Durkheim's notion of objectivity is a two-tiered one, as we know and as the author of Lesformes dlementaires de la vie religieuse often repeats (using other terms). However, the viewpoint that the question of objectivity moves us to take suggests that the relevant ontolo- gical duality here is not individual/society but reality/representation. (48) Like all collective representations, thought categories presuppose a reality external to representation, a reality that can be minimally described by means of a few properties of matter. How this should be related to the homo duplex thesis is another question. Here it suffices to recall that it was Durkheim who made the connection between the two when discussing the "essential idealism" of social reality, attributing our need to "express our own ideas even to ourselves [...] to attach those ideas to material things which symbolize them" to "the duality of our nature" ([1912] 1990, p. 326; 1995, p. 229). 3) The type of realism that this two-tiered ontology gives rise to is based on the idea that external reality exists even though representation of it is pro- blematic. In this sense Durkheim's realism is different from both an empiricist position, where social reality is simply given to observation as fact, and an idealist position, according to which there is no reality independent of repre- sentations. If it is true, as Durkheim suggests, that the ontological dimension of the notion of objectivity debated in Les formes dlementaires de la vie religieuse is only a further elaboration of the problem already examined in exclusively epistemological terms in Les regles de la methode sociologique, (49) then Georges Davy's (or Talcott Parsons') old and still widely accepted evolutionary thesis is called into question. Instead of contrasting a "first", positivist Durkheim to a "second", idealist Durkheim, it would then make more sense to grasp the fil rouge of his research, which started with the question of representation's form, then turned to the question of its object.
