<plain_text><page sequence="1">Karl J. Narr APPROACHES TO THE RELIGION OF EARLY PALEOLITHIC MAN* The oldest human burials that we know of up to now belong to the middle Paleolithic age. From them we can conclude that men of that time believed in some form of life after death. No one has yet been able to offer a convincing profane interpretation of the deposits of bear skulls which are about equally as old; on the contrary, we must assume that there were irrational motives behind them. We can regard them as a sacrifice to higher beings or to a supreme being or as a means of resurrecting the animal (the term "skeleton magic" surely represents only a very inadequate description of this custom). But this evidence, which is our earliest indication of the religion of Paleolithic man and which is often cited as being so, goes back scarcely further than about a hundred thousand years -and this is already a rather high estimate. On the whole, man is much older. Our first definite evidence for his existence is certainly better than half a million years old, and perhaps even much more than a million. We have no direct archaeological evidence for religious activity * Translated from the German by Nancy E. Auer. 1</page><page sequence="2">Approaches to the Religion of Early Paleolithic Man during this long period of the early Paleolithic age;' but our argument would of course be unfounded, ex silentio, if we were to assert on this basis that an early stage of human history had no religion. Nonetheless, people have made such assertions again and again,2 and it is true that they are consistent with the belief that early man was incapable of religious experience and of the higher spiritual feelings in general. In an approach to the religion of early Paleolithic man we must, therefore, first settle the important preliminary question of whether or not we can consider him to have been capable of having religion at all. I Such ideas are fed above all by an extreme kind of evolutionistic thinking which claims that early man had a more or less animal nature. In particular, some so-called phylogenetic rules are important in this connection. The biogenetic rule formulated by 1 Cannibalism has often been cited in this context; but we must consider two objections to such a notion: (1) The cannibalism of early man had already been adopted as an evolutionary postulate before archaeological data of a corresponding age was uncovered, and the data which was later cited in this connection is not clear (see K. J. Narr in Zeitschriftfiir Ethnologie, LXXXV [1960], 279-81). To be sure, some of it can be interpreted in terms of cannibalism; however, this inter- pretation is not necessary and evident per se-other interpretations are also possible. (2) Today cannibalism is extensively attested only among peoples of agrarian cultures and its spiritual nucleus is clearly bound up with a world of ideas which is centered in the edible plants (see E. Volhard, Der Kannibalismus [Frankfort, 1939]); thus its religious and magical background cannot be used for explaining the customs of simple hunters and gatherers ("Wildbooter": see n. 7) of the Paleolithic age, whose cultural structure is completely different (see also n. 21). Similar criticisms hold true for the "Paleolithic skull cult" and "head-hunt." It is true that evidence exists for a non-profane deposition of human skulls and possibly also for the removal of the brain, especially in Monte Circeo (A. C. Blanc, Origine e sviluppo dei populi cacciatori e raccoglitori [Rome, 1956]), and this can possibly also be asserted for a number of other finds of skulls and parts of skulls, because of their selective character (e.g., Chou-kou-tien). Nonetheless it is difficult to find a workable interpretation for this data, and most authors rely on evidence from agrarian cultures in this connection (e.g., W. Gieseler in Der Neandertaler und seine Umwelt, ed. K. Tackenberg [Bonn, 1956], and G. H. R. von K6nigswald in Neanderthal Centenary, ed. G. H. R. von K6nigswald [New York, 1958]); for this practice we can make the same criticism as we did above with reference to can- nibalism. The other interpretation of them as representing the simple preservation and "carrying along" of the skulls and skull parts of dead relatives (see H. Breuil and W. Schmidt in Anthropos, XXVII [1932], 1-11) is, to be sure, based on analogies from simple hunters and gatherers; but still these analogies are known only from a few examples and cannot be regarded definitely as evidence from a broad and ancient cultural level (see also Narr, Urgeschichte der Kultur [Stuttgart, 1961], pp. 56-58). (The French version, A la recherche de la prehistoire [Paris, 1964], is a rather bad and misleading translation!) 2 This idea penetrated the science of prehistory especially by the work of J. Lubbock, Prehistoric Times as Illustrated by Ancient Remains and the Manners and Customs of Modern Savages (London, 1865). Such a notion is also necessarily conserved in the system of historical materialism which claims that religious ideas are intrinsic neither to human nature nor to human thinking; still there is a 2</page><page sequence="3">E. Haeckel is the most significant one; according to this rule, ontogenesis is a recapitulation of phylogenesis. This principle was carried over into the psychic realm, to produce the psychogenetic rule that man's development from childhood to maturity sup- posedly mirrors the fundamental aspects of the intellectual development of mankind.3 Thomas Huxley's discovery that apes more nearly resemble human beings in their body structure than they do monkeys seemed to advance further suggestions. It was carried over into the psychic realm and scholars concluded from it that apes were intellectually closer to human beings than to monkeys. In fact, this principle was even projected into human development so that, according to one extreme theory, early man was intellectually closer to the apes than he was to present-day human beings.4 We need not go into the significance of these rules, especially the biogenetic rule, in theories of biological evolution; we might mention, however, that even in biology they have been criticized and their significance has been reduced to the signifi- cance of a heuristic principle.5 Nevertheless, it is important for us to decide whether rules or supposed rules of development which have been established by the biological sciences can be carried over into the psychic realm. Such proceeding implies a psycho- physical and phylo-ontogenetic parallelism which they presuppose rather than prove. The justification for carrying such rules over from the biological to the psychological realm is not the result of objective research, achieved a posteriori; instead it is derived from an evolutionistic postulate, laid down a priori, that psychical and physical development follow absolutely parallel courses and are governed by the same laws. Differences in the structure of the brain are regarded as further remarkable contradiction here: on the one hand the roots of religion are to be found in primeval man's weakness and powerlessness over against nature (see e.g. Vsemirnaya istoriya, ed. I. M. Shukov [Moscow, 1955], Vol. I); on the other hand an original non-religious state is postulated, in spite of the fact that the conditions in question must have been more predominant in the beginning than at any other time (see also n. 27). 3 For examples of correlation between ontogenetic stages of modern man, pre- historic epochs, and fossil human races see E. Dennert, Das geistige Erwachen des Urmenschen (Weimar, 1929); R. R. Schmidt, Der Geist der Vorzeit (Berlin, 1934) (French edition: L'aurore de l'esprit humain [Paris, 1936]) (R. R. Schmidt must not be confounded with W. Schmidt, as F. M. Bergounioux in the last years repeatedly did when he criticized the theories of W.

Haas (Basel, Freiburg, Wien, 1959), Vol. I. 3</page><page sequence="4">Approaches to the Religion of Early Paleolithic Man evidence for the intellectual inferiority of early man. For all prac- tical purposes, nothing can be predicated, of course, for the internal structures of early man's brain; we can only talk about its size and the differing proportions of its parts. We can doubtless assert that an intellectual activity which is specifically human requires that the brain have a specific structure and a certain volume; but no one can say, even with approximate certainty, where the boundary line is to be drawn. It is by no means certain whether changes in the course of human development, which generally seem not to have followed a straight line, mirror an increase in intellectual powers. Recent research in brain surgery and comparative anatomy compel us to revise many views which up to now were regarded as certain. In extremely evolutionistic interpretations of the anatomical facts we are again confronted with a silent presupposition: the physical substratum is regarded as the only or as the chief or effective cause-the causa efficiens of intellectual development. This is also, fundamentally, an a priori axiom, and we cannot unconditionally accept anatomical charac- teristics as criteria for kinds and degrees of intelligence6 so long as our conclusions are not borne out by other factors. Scholars have wanted to find such a confirmation for Paleolithic man in the fact that his technological progress was extraordinarily slow. But here again they wanted to believe that the cause of this slow development was his intellectual inferiority and the slow development of his intellectual capacities. Again we are dealing with an a priori assumption, namely, that technical progress is only possible on the basis of growth in intelligence. People also attempted to couple the doubtless, although also not unilinear, economic and technical progress of prehistoric times with the biological development from "lower" to "higher" races-from early Paleolithic Pithecanthropus to middle Paleolithic Neander- thal man to the so-called Homo sapiens of the late Paleolithic age. This argument is not very convincing either, because the increase in technical and economic progress continued also in the time of so-called Homo sapiens. Here it is even much greater: today, both "civilized peoples" and contemporary simple "primitive" hunters and gatherers (Wildbeuter or Wildbooter)7 belong to the 6 F. Weidenreich, " The Human Brain in the Light of Its Phylogenetic Develop- ment," Scientific Monthly, Vol. LXVII (1948); T. Edinger, "Die Palaneurologie am Beginn einer neuen Phase," Experientia, Vol. VI (1950). 7 The term "Wildbooters" (Wildbeuter), which equals the term "Niedere Jiger und Sammler" ("Lower Hunters and Collectors") of E. Grosse (Die Formen der Familie und die Formen der Wirtschaft [Freiburg and Leipzig, 1896], was coined 4</page><page sequence="5">species Homo sapiens; and yet the economic and technical dif- ference between these two is perhaps greater than that which existed between the Neanderthal of the middle and Homo sapiens of the late Paleolithic age. There are many other factors which have determined this development. Initial discoveries are doubt- less always the most difficult ones, and in spite of their apparent simplicity we must ascribe great significance to them. It is easier to add onto achievements already in existence, and a developed culture can always fructify itself and thus continue to grow. The richer and more complicated its inventions and its other cultural elements are, the more manifold are the possibilities for their combination-and thus the possibilities for stimulation and advancement increase. We must also remember that the differing demographic conditions play their roles here. Small groups living in more or less widely unpopulated regions have fewer oppor- tunities for exchanging techniques and inventions and also have fewer possibilities of social differentiation-which in turn pro- motes special talents. Thus, even if technical progress might possibly be explained in terms of increasing intelligence, it does not necessarily require such an explanation. Once again, that which we have before us is not the result of conclusive inductive investigation, but rather the expression of a pre-existent idea. The entire argumentation is actually unnecessary, because other factors can offer an adequate interpretation. Thus all of these ideas about mental inferiority and the slow development of man's intellectual powers, instead of being derived from the available paleontological and archaeological sources, have been applied a priori to this material. Nonetheless it is, of course, possible to utilize such constructions as heuristic principles in constructing working hypotheses-but only for so long as they do not immediately contradict the objective data. II We readily come to this conclusion when we examine the oldest artifacts which can definitely be identified as such-namely, artificially fabricated tools.8 At the same time, they are our oldest by F. Kern (Die Anfdnge der Weltgeschichte [Berlin, 1933], p. 28) to avoid the depreciating flavor of Grosse's term. 8 G. Kraft's book, Der Urmensch als Schopfer (Berlin, 1942), is still the basic work for the evaluation of the earliest stone tools. Valuable contributions are presented also by A. Gehlen, Urmensch und Spdtkultur (Bonn, 1956), pp. 11-13 (for other parts of this book see the review in Anthropos, LI [1956], 1107). For general considerations see G. Siegmund, Tier und Mensch (Frankfort a.M., 1958), and F. J. J. Buytendijk, "tTber die Grenzen der tierischen Intelligenz," Natur- wissenschaft und Theologie, Vol. I (1957). 5</page><page sequence="6">Approaches to the Religion of Early Paleolithic Man evidence for the presence of human beings. We can expect that in the process of biological evolution there was, at least theoretically, a continual series of related forms; thus there is no clear-cut anatomical distinction between man and animal. Thus even physical anthropologists have been more and more seriously inclined to use evidences of cultural activity-especially the manu- facture of tools-as their criterion for distinguishing the two. Tool- making is the oldest cultural phenomenon known to us and the one most easily accessible to archaeological investigation. The dis- tinction between human and prehuman beings, drawn according to this criterion, is first of all a practical and pragmatic one, but closer investigation shows that it is grounded in some specifically human characteristics. Here, too, we cannot go into more detail; a few examples must do. Because there are great numbers even of the most ancient stone artifacts and because they are constantly embedded throughout thick stratifications, we can assume that they were not manufactured just occasionally. Evidently they were not only serving to fulfil needs in specific situations, but were produced regularly and continuously and were consciously oriented to a specific way of working and to anticipated needs. These are not objects which functioned as tools only at the time of their use; rather their function was lastingly determined by their design. They are lasting intellectual property, kept at hand to be used as tools-and they could be used by everyone who had the requisite insight, capability, and understanding. The know- ledge of the method of manufacturing them must, moreover, have been h'anded down from one man to another, from one generation to the next, so that a tradition arose.9 Moreover, we cannot dis- miss these tools as being more or less unconscious projections of human organs, as ways of imitating, extending, and improving on the members of the body; rather, the oldest stone artifacts are designed, at least partially, for cutting. Thus they fulfil a function for which there is no natural model in the bodily structure of men or apes. (Tearing with teeth or scratching with nails is funda- mentally different from dividing something by cutting it.) We 9 To be sure the duration and growth of tradition are possible without the fabrication of tools and would indicate a human way of working; but at present such a tradition cannot be definitely verified by archaeological evidence. The so-called "Osteodontoceratic culture" would, of course, represent something of the sort, if this was really a question of tools. It has not, however, been proved that these were used as tools, and if, in fact, some pieces actually show traces of preparation, this would again shift the question from one of use to one of manu- facture, without our being able to learn anything new in the process. At most we would learn from some alleged composite tools that besides division by cutting there was also joining and tying, something presupposed anyway. 6</page><page sequence="7">must therefore regard this kind of tool-making as the result of a genuine invention, as the solution of a problem by wholly new means evoked by studying a situation and by selecting and rejecting possibilities. They are the products of real insight into the essence of objects and problems, and the products of intelli- gence in the sense of an "Intus legere," for they reveal a capacity for recognizing and selecting essentials which goes beyond simply observing objects and their given connections. We are doubtless dealing with the products of an intellectual activity which is to be radically distinguished from the accidental discovery of tools in play or by a kind of experimenting-discoveries which require no such act of judgment, like those of apes using natural objects. The latter activity is always confined to a specific situation and lacks the elements of precaution and foresight involved in a function which is possibly new and which has no model. Everything, there- fore, indicates that these early tool-makers already possessed certain fundamental traits of a specifically human intelligence, even if the latter was not yet fully developed in all its dimensions or had not even been practically realized. If we are to start with some kind of positive statement, we must, therefore, regard early Paleolithic man as a being who was already a man in the full sense of the word and who is clearly distinguish- able from his animal relatives.'0 If we wanted to use the psychical achievements of apes for illuminating the peculiarities of early man, we could do so at best only with reference to a transitional phase for which we have no data. Such methods are clearly useless when we come to the time of the earliest tool-makers, that is, of Paleolithic man himself. This phenomenon so clearly estab- lishes him on this side of the "Rubicon," that is, of the gulf which separates man from animals, that we can hardly use the theory of evolution as a "most powerful heuristic method of thought" 1 here. On the contrary, we shall use a different "approach" as our heuristic principle-one which maintains that early men were genuinely and fully human and not half-animal and that they must be understood in the context of human nature in general and not by means of non-human analogies.12 It is manifestly not necessary for us to presuppose that there are different stages of development in human intelligence which 10 See also Narr, "Der Urmensch als Natur- und Geistwesen," Saeculum, Vol. VII (1956). 11 M.

Unbiased evaluation of our sources disproves such inferiority even when we are dealing with prehistoric man and the early human races. It is even less likely that contemporary man of the species Homo sapiens-which includes the "most primitive" tribes-would be intellectually inferior. But again and again people have invoked our "primitive" contemporaries to demonstrate the existence of a "primitive mentality" which is supposed to be radically and qualitatively different from our kind of intellectual activity and essentially "prelogical" and "magical." 13 Such exaggerated and one-sided conceptions are basically applications of the evolutionistic principle to ethnographic materials. (The "biogenetic rule," in particular, is at work here, for people think that they can detect a similar mentality among children and thus they suppose that there is a stage in the onto- genetic evolution of modern man which is analogous to one in the phylogenetic position of contemporary and prehistoric "primi- tives ": the evolutionistic Circulous viciosus is closed!) At any rate, these theories are not accepted by ethnological field researchers, and they cannot pretend to universal validity.14 Nonetheless it would be unrealistic for us to deny that there is a difference between modern "civilized" man and his "primitive" contem- poraries for, of course, in each instance particular aspects of intel- lectual activity come to the fore. Primitives certainly place less emphasis upon abstract and rational thinking and, being in a different cultural system, they also define concepts differently. To us, their way of thinking seems to be vague and illogical-it seems to efface and dissolve the boundaries which we are accustomed to set, for example, between the human and animal, the mundane and supermundane spheres. The connections and participations of phenomena are grasped and experienced in a considerably more comprehensive way. To that extent, the premises of primitive thinking are of course different from ours; but the thinking itself is in no way illogical. In order to evaluate the mental disposition of the "primitive," we must, moreover, properly appreciate the fact that his everyday circumstances, activities, and functions participate in the religious to a much greater extent than ours do 13 L. Levy-Bruhl primarily represents this theory, although he later retracted it in its essential points: Les carnets de Lucien Levy-Bruhl (Paris, 1949). For a pertinent critique cf. also A. Portmann, Biologische Fragmente zu einer Lehre vom Menschen (2d ed.; Basel, 1951), p. 63. 14 See W. Koppers, Der Urmensch und sein Weltbild (Vienna, ca. 1949), pp. 13-14. 8</page><page sequence="9">and that he is more open to religious experience than we tend to be. This is a positive element which should be set over against his limited interest in the abstract-logical, the rational, and the critical-a lack of interest which is often evaluated negatively. Still, on the whole, "primitive mentality"-if, for once, we abide by the expression-is as a rule concerned more with the sub- stantial, the corporeal, and the concrete.15 However, we have to understand this concern more within the context of over-all cultural conditions and needs, and we cannot infer from it a radically different kind of mental activity. If we understand contemporary as well as prehistoric "primi- tive" man in this way-not as an inferior being, but rather as a human being living under different constellations-we will, on the one hand, guard against disputing certain essential traits which are characteristic of human beings and certain fundamental categories of human behavior; on the other hand we will receive important indications of the respective peculiarities which we must take into account. This also applies to the realm of religion, for there is no good reason why early man should not have been capable of religious feelings and why he should not have felt the need for religious obligations ("religio ") and a religious interpreta- tion of the world. So far as we can see, appearances teach us that religion constitutes a fundamental category of human existence.16 (The only exception is an "enlightened" atheism, which still very often turns into a kind of ersatz-religion.) Thus, if anyone should demand proof that early man was a religious man, we would have a complete inversion of the methodological situation. On the con- trary, what is to be proved is the assertion that he was not a religious man. Such proof does not exist, unless we permit an evolutionistic (and philosophical, very often fed by a militant atheism) a priori to constitute proof by itself. III A judicious approach to the religious life of early man must there- fore include an investigation of his total background, for the latter strongly influences the forms of his religion. This applies not only to the dispositions of his spiritual life, but also to the economic and social circumstances which put certain limits to the possi- bilities for their realization. (For example, in polytheistic religions, 15 A. Brunner, Die Religion (Freiburg, 1956), p. 301. 16 On tribes allegedly without religion see R. Boccassino, Ethnologia religiosa (Torino, 1958), pp. 120-65. 9</page><page sequence="10">Approaches to the Religion of Early Paleolithic Man surely the concept of "departmental deities" or a "state of the gods" presupposes a matching economic and social organization, based on an extensive division of labor.) Unfortunately we can learn very little about this background when we study the most ancient epochs.17 At least it is certain that men in the early Paleolithic age lived by hunting and gather- ing, although this was carried on at a very simple technical level. Everything indicates that there was also communal work that would have required the co-operation of several hunters. It must have been of such a nature that we can postulate some kind of language that at least named specific activities, and made dis- tinctions of time and space, and was capable of putting them together meaningfully. But size of communities was surely very sharply restricted by the natural environment, which would have allowed only a very few men to maintain an adequate existence by means of extensive hunting in a confined territory. We can get some idea of the forms of communal life if we base our considera- tions on such things as biological facts (non-specialization, lack of specialized organs for fighting, extended childhood, distinction between the sexes), basic psychic structure (probably fewer instinctual bonds, allowing fundamental freedom of decision), economic activities (ways of procuring food which required the co-operative effort of several hunters while at the same time limiting the number of heads because of natural contingencies), essential human traits (striving for independence and necessity for association). These cannot be developed in detail here; they have been discussed elsewhere.18 We conclude thereby that the basic small family (parents and children and possibly older or weaker people) is a nuclear unit of society which is given by the nature of man; but we must also assume that there were larger groupings for performing common tasks. If we want an unbiased picture, then we must say that these little groups could not have been "primeval bands with sexual promiscuity";19 rather they were 17 For a general presentation see Narr, Urgeschichte der Kultur, pp. 47-64. 18 Narr, "Approaches to the Social Life of Earliest Man," Anthropos, Vol. LVII (1962). 19 Utilizing older ideas, above all of J. J. Bachofen (esp. Das Mutterrecht [Stuttgart, 1861]), this supposed root of human society is taken as the basis for his system of social development by L. H. Morgan (Ancient Society [New York, 1877]). Fundamentally this is a question of the application of an evolutionistic principle: the conditions of our own time and society are viewed as the highest stage reached up to now, and that which seems especially "primitive" in the sense of "unrefined" and "brutish" according to our own conceptions of value and moral concepts (i.e., according to Morgan and his contemporaries of the Victorian age) is also held to be "primitive" in the sense of "early" and "prime- 10</page><page sequence="11">associations of several families. Furthermore, they probably moved their camps according to their needs and to natural oppor- tunities; but they were hardly nomads roaming over great dis- tances. They probably moved within territories which were not excessively large, whose natural resources they knew, and which required no wandering into the unknown. We thereby come to basic elements of social organization resembling those which can also be found among contemporary simple hunters20-that is, among tribes whose way of life we, basing our ideas on capabilities, conditions, and ways of behavior called human, could hardly conceive as being less complicated. What anyone thinks of the precise antiquity of a simple hunter culture-that is, whether he regards it as a genuine vestige of a Paleolithic stage or a secondary form of "primitivism"-is not particularly important. The phenomenon alone, that is, the social structure of small human groups economically dependent on simple hunting and gathering and living closer to the natural state than any other men, is significant enough in itself. The inter- dependence of the two realms is undeniable,21 and in analyzing the structure of the simple hunter's economy we learn that the latter does not favor change, but rather is inclined to extreme conserva- tism.22 Obviously we are dealing with one of those cultural con- stants which are largely due to the very nature of the given conditions, and we must duly take it into account along with the process of change. Beyond what we can learn from archaeological data, contemporary simple hunters teach us that leadership under such conditions usually falls instead to the share of the " elders " or an "elder" who is outstanding within the group. The dignity and functioning of such leadership is based on personal prestige and on respect for the aged and their experience, coupled with the natural leadership of the husband and father which emerges under such circumstances. val" and therefore transposed to the beginning of human history, e.g., promis- cuity, cannibalism, a lack of religion, or an especially "primitive" form of religion (e.g., "fetishism": see already A. Comte, Cours de philosophie positive [Paris, 1830], Vol. I), etc. 20 Though one may not agree with his conclusions, one must acknowledge that a useful picture of wildbooter society is given by F. Kern, Der Beginn der Welt- geschichte (Bern and Munich, 1953) (English version: The Wildbooters [London and Edinburgh, 1960]). 21 To this extent the nucleus of the principle of the dependence of the social "superstructure" on the economic "basis" in the system of "historical material- ism" is correct, but we must guard ourselves from treating this relationship as a rigid law. 22 See R. Schott, "Beharrung und Wandel von Wildbeuterkulturen unter wirtschaftsethnologischen Aspekten," Anthropos, Vol. LVII (1962). 11</page><page sequence="12">Approaches to the Religion of Early Paleolithic Man IV If we can, without further discussion, ascribe religious beliefs and activities to early man, the concrete form of these beliefs and customs still remains a different problem altogether. As we are completely lacking both historical and archaeological sources, we can only make inferences about it by using analogies from more recent times. This procedure is much disputed; but the radical objections to it are very often no less frivolous and epistemologic- ally naive than a careless use of analogies would be.23 (Doubtless one factor involved here is that these comparisons lead to other results than the evolutionistic postulates and are not suited to many allegedly "unbiased" tendencies in the interpretation and evaluation of man and his world.) Without the use of analogies, prehistoric research would simply be impossible (even in the technical-economic realm!), and all assertions to the contrary are self-deceptions.24 The first objection brought forward has to do with the incalculably long time which has passed since the early Paleolithic age; this gap, it is claimed, makes it impossible for us to learn anything about truly early circumstances from modern "primitives." (The objection, of course, loses its force when the same authors, uncurbed, use their observations of apes for inter- preting the behavior of early man. Time-wise, apes are just as far removed from earliest man as contemporary simple hunters are and by nature they are much farther. Furthermore, those who think that technological and economic progress constitute evidence for an over-all increase in intellect must then account for a really fundamental transformation which would first be notice- able 30,000 years ago; for us these thirty millenniums, measured against the preceding aeons of simple hunting culture, seem almost a quantite negligeable.) However, the chronological proportion of historical past is not decisive for our question but rather the degree of cultural change. As in the modern physical and mathe- matical sciences-both microsciences (e.g., nuclear physics) and macrosciences (e.g., cosmology)-the categories of immediate comprehension and concrete apprehension have been to a great extent lost, so the same is apparently true also for the dimension of history. Its temporal categories, through their extension into 23 Schott says justifiably (ibid., p. 720): "Jedenfalls kann man es sich nicht so einfach machen wie z.B. Herskovits" (i.e., M. J. Herskovits, Economic Anthro- pology [New York, 1952], p. 55). 24 See Narr in Saeculum, X (1959), 136-38; also C. Siegmund, Der Glaube des Urmenschen (Bern and Munich, 1962), pp. 20-22. 12</page><page sequence="13">prehistory, have come to defy all immediate temporal experience and current historical imagination. Insofar as the category of "historical time" is lost, we have to turn to categories of a trans- historical nature. This is a difficult task, and a kind of "Copernican revolution" which cannot take place painlessly. When we look to this task, however, a further objection which people often raise against the use of analogies disappears-namely, their reference to the multiplicity of possible analogies which would allow too many possibilities of interpretation.25 The process of making the right choice is unquestionably a methodological problem.26 Certainly an arbitrary scale of values (like those of the evolutionistic theories) cannot be a proper criterion. We can say, however, that the basis for our conclusions will be more stable, according as a fact to be interpreted by means of analogies is more general-that is, more generally human. Furthermore, we can exclude many analogies which belong to contemporary cultures quite different in structure from those of the early Paleolithic age which we are interpreting. Thus we will generally find our most useful analogies among those primitives who most nearly resemble Paleolithic man pheno- menologically, for their culture is likely to contain a number of constants of human nature and human behavior. However, we must remember that we cannot use for comparison singular elements of culture which appear only infrequently. We can only use those which occur in sufficient breadth and accord to represent as much as possible the general characteristics of a certain cultural situation. If we proceed on the basis of the preceding heuristic principle and investigate religious phenomena existing among simple hunter cultures, we find that those forms of religion (or non-religion) which progressivistic theories of religion have put at the beginning of its development (perhaps fetishism or the like) are not especially characteristic of them. First of all, there is a belief in a Supreme Being, who in many cases is said to be the creator and maintainer of the world and the world order and who is called "Father, Old One," or "Primeval (Eternal) One," and also "Creator," "Owner," "Lord," "The One Who Is Up There," and the like. (Often this Being is said to live in heaven, and for this reason scholars also call him "uranian"; but still we must distinguish whether "heaven" 25 Especially stressed by E. Patte, Les hommes prehistorique et la religion (Paris, 1960). 26 See Narr in Anthropos, L (1955), 519-25 (methodological evaluation of "ethnographic parallels") and Kairos, V (1963), 179-88 (review of recent books on prehistoric religion). 13</page><page sequence="14">Approaches to the Religion of Early Paleolithic Man implies only a dwelling, a name used metaphorically, or an identification with the sky.27) The fact that such simple people have such a belief in a Supreme Being is already very significant in itself, no matter how we assess its historical position. In any case it shows that a religious conception which we commonly think of as being especially "high" exists among tribes with very simple social and economic structures and that it is, therefore, obviously possible under such conditions. To be sure, along with the belief in the Supreme Being there are also concepts of tribal ancestors, personifications of natural objects, spirits, and souls, and even magical elements.28 Still, these have not attained such marked breadth and agreement, nor do they occur as regularly as the belief in the Supreme Being.29 Moreover, although the latter is by no means always the living center of cult and myth, being often a deus otiosus, nonetheless the idea of the Supreme Being can be identified in so many instances as a common and significant com- ponent of hunter-religion that it clearly represents a central religious belief of these primitives whose economic and social structure is so simple. We have good reason for believing that it was originally of fundamental significance.30 Of course we have no indisputable proof that this belief goes back to the early Paleolithic age, but neither can we set any convincing backward limits to it.31 This would be possible only if we had convincing grounds for denying that early man was capable of having such a conception, that is, if we could show that he was a being whose intellect was generally inferior to ours. If we reject this a priori postulate and regard early man as a being of normal intelligence, these grounds no longer exist. Nevertheless 27 See M. Eliade, Traite d'histoire des religions (Paris, 1949). No matter what one may think of the theories which W. Schmidt developed, his monumental work Der Ursprung der Gottesidee, Vols. I-VI (Miinster, 1926-1935) still remains at least a very valuable collection of materials; Pettazoni's book, L'Onniscienza di Dio (Torino, 1955) (English version: The All-Knowing God [London, 1956]) adds further valuable material, in spite of its emotional critique, which is often difficult to understand objectively. F. Herrmann also offers a useful review in his Symbolik in den Religionen der Naturvolker (Stuttgart, 1961), pp. 65-97. 28 See J. Haekel in Lehrbuch der Volkerkunde, ed. L. Adam and H. Trimborn (Stuttgart, 1958); still we must consider that the concept "Wildbeuter" has recently been interpreted quite broadly by German ethnologists and prehistorians and includes tribes which, according to Grosse (op. cit.) and others must be called "Higher hunters." 29 This conception was not detected among the Wedda; still it is possible that their religion was studied under somewhat one-sided aspects. We know so little about the religion of the Kubu, Tasmanians, and Yumbri that any conclusion about it is absolutely ruled out. 30 See Eliade, op. cit. 31 Haekel, op. cit., pp. 67-68; also already Th. Mainage, Les religions de la prehistoire (Paris, 1921), p. 145. 14</page><page sequence="15">we must set some necessary limitations here and pay attention to some special qualifications. On the one hand, they emerge from certain special aspects of a way of looking at the world-aspects proper to a "primitive mentality"; on the other hand they arise from a general social and cultural environment. When "primitive" man meets something uncommon and unique, which directs him beyond the everyday world and comprehensible reality and which he experiences as the intervention of a new and trans- cendent cause, it is likely to suggest to him personal powers working behind the visible event. When he experiences a trans- cendent power and feels that he is dependent upon it, he is likely to envision it, according to the models of his concrete experience, as a personal cause which creates and controls the world and the world order. (It is strangely self-contradictory when many theorists maintain that "early" and "primitive" men are incapable of abstraction and nonetheless claim that religion came into being through categories of transcendence which require a higher degree of abstraction than the belief in a personal god.) Since over-all social and cultural conditions also have a hand in shaping such ideas, we can assume that the importance of the family and the father, and of the venerable elders, had a forma- tive effect on the representation of the Supreme Being. We cannot presume to want to learn or to claim to know details; but under the circumstances the idea of a primeval father who is the personal bearer of a general and original power would be the more natural one. It surely is better in keeping with "primitiveness," in the sense of undeveloped simplicity, than are the abstractions of Animism, Manism, and Dynamism. v Among contemporary hunters and gatherers we can observe still another aspect of the religious-an aspect which is closely bound up with their economic activity and its objects-with the hunt and the game. It is expressed in the conception of the Master of Animals, in the theriomorphic attributes of supernatural beings, and in the close ties between the animal and human realms. (This "animalism" or "theriocentrism" is apparently also the spiritual basis of totemism; for this reason it is sometimes called "proto- totemism"32 or "cultic totemism,"33 inasmuch as it is tied to living cultic beliefs and practices and has not, like totemism 32 H. Baumann in Zeitschrift fur Ethnologie, LXX (1938), 208. 33 H. Petri in Paideuma, V (1950), 44. 15</page><page sequence="16">Approaches to the Religion of Early Paleolithic Man proper, particularly group totemism, been emptied of such reli- gious content to become a purely social application of the relation- ship between man and animal.) This animalistic attitude can, to a certain extent, develop in different ways and is expressed above all in the idea of the animal as guardian spirit and alter ego, as well as in the possibility of easy and frequent exchange between animal and human forms. Higher beings who are portrayed theriomorphically or who alternate between human and animal forms and unite them-as the Master of Animals, of the Hunter, or the Hunting-ground-as well as spirits of the game and the forest, play a great role.34 Very often the same types of super- natural beings have also taken on the characteristics of tribal ancestors and culture heroes, or they act as mediators between the world and the Supreme Being, or they can be understood as hypostases and personifications of individual traits and functions of high-gods. Thus this animalism dominates religious forms to a great extent, especially among "higher hunters'"; but for the most part it is basically a "lower" province of religion35 and is also frequently interspersed with other motives, some of them magical. Our first archaeological indication of such a world of ideas is the art of the upper Paleolithic age (since about 30,000 B.C.). It would of course be a precarious argumentum ex silentio for us to assert that nothing like it existed before that time; however, studying the art of the late Ice Age can still give us some indication of the phenomenological and historical position of such conceptions.36 In general, an aesthetic evaluation is unnecessary here, for the content of this early art is more important for our questions. Its effectiveness as art is indisputable, and it still makes a deep impression on modern man. However we cannot deny that, especially in Franco-Cantabrian cave art, there is an undeniable poverty of motifs in contrast with this inner richness of expression. Animals are portrayed for the most part; men are comparatively 34 H. Baumann, "Afrikanische Wild- und Buschgeister," Zeitschrift fur Ethno- logie, Vol. LXX (1938); A.

There is no scenic composition, nor are there baselines, borders, or any background. It is quite clear that the focus of interest is the (rarely portrayed) anthropomorphic being and, above all, the animal itself. We need not repeat here our grounds for maintaining that this is not a case of pure ornamentation of a wall or perhaps of "l'art pour l'art," but these pictures have a religious or magical significance.37 Unfortunately, among today's hunter tribes, the custom of painting or engraving on rock walls and caves is quite rare and partially in a so-to-speak "subfossil" condition. For all that, we can still say that picture galleries are often centers of cult activities in which the contents of an animalistic world view play an impor- tant role.38 Occasionally rock paintings are immediately con- nected with the first hunt and with a boy's introduction into the circle of men. On these and other occasions they are partly refreshed and re-painted-this is necessary so that the game will increase and the hunters' world order will prosper. Some peculi- arities in contemporary rites of initiation even offer good explana- tions for phenomena in Paleolithic picture-caves.39 On the whole, when we utilize ethnological materials for interpreting the rock art of the old Stone Age, one-sided conclusions about "picture magic" become quite improbable. Instead, it seems to be full of cultic and religious content.40 If we leave magic aside for the moment and base our judgments on the total data from Franco-Cantabrian cave art, it becomes quite apparent that the animal played a predominant role in the artistic activity of men from that era. It is the essential thing, the animal, that is portrayed here, partially in its relation to the hunt (shown in drawings of arrows and spears on the animal) but also in its relationship to anthropomorphic beings and at times in the appearance of partly animal, partly human forms. We can probably assume that this was something which largely occupied and dominated the spiritual world of this artist, who, as a hunter, 37 Narr, ibid.; his Urgeschichte der Kultur; and his " Sentido de arte Paleolitico," Orbis Catholicus: Revista Iberamericana international, Vol. IV (1961). 38 L.

As, however, the paintings clearly did not serve purely profane ends and as their content cannot always be explained in terms of profane models, we can presume that, for this hunter, there was also a special inner relationship between man and animal in the supernatural world-a relationship that transcends and dissolves the demarcation between what we consider to be different realms of existence. Clearly the animalistic-theriomorphic being partici- pates in other spheres of existence in a way which is quite similar to the animalism of modern "primitives." To be sure, there are many possibilities for the concrete realiza- tion of such a general conception in individual cave paintings or other kinds of art, and thus we very rarely find a precise and unequivocable designation of their spiritual background. This holds true, for example, for a number of paintings of so-called "masked dancers" or "disguised magicians." Some of them are to be understood as intermingled animal and human forms rather than as men in disguise. For example, details of the clearly catlike (feline) body of the well-known Sorcier de Trois Freres seems to favor such an interpretation-or perhaps the painting of a man whose arms end in mammoth-tusks. We especially cannot inter- pret through "masks" paintings of animals which incorporate the attributes of different kinds of animals without including any human elements (e.g., the body of an ox with the head of a reindeer or a bear with a wolf's head). There are even some peculiar drawings which have no real models in the animal world of the Ice Age (as the Licorne of Lascaux). On the whole, we can scarcely expect that reality and the supernatural were always rigidly distinguished. In the imagination of the artists the two very often flowed together just as, among today's "primitives," masked dancers often do not merely portray supernatural beings, but feel themselves to be such. If the modern primitive is more open to participating in what he portrays than "civilized man" we can expect that reality and transcendence would have flowed together still more easily for the prehistoric artist. The dancer, after all, is bound to his body, but the artist's materials would have posed no such limitations to participation in his different animal and anthropomorphic subjects. As it is clear the Franco-Cantabrian cave art did not serve profane ends, theories which seek to find the roots of art in the numinous may help us to understand it. Immediately, however, we shall have to ask whether the idea of an indefinable power is 18</page><page sequence="19">enough of an explanation for Paleolithic art. And we must ask, further, why an artistic potency should have been released for the first time at just that time and place to become a lasting cultural possession. In this connection we seem to receive some help from the fact that, although contemporary simple hunters have no graphic arts, they do have another way of portraying the animal and the hunter-namely, immediate representation through pantomime. All observers (as of the African pygmies or Semang) are united in saying that such pantomime has great expressive power and much versatility, nourished by creative exuberance and enthusiastic devotion to such free and uninhibited kinds of expression.41 It is clearly distinguishable from the ritual and utilitarian "institutionalized" animal-pantomimes and masked dances of "higher" cultures. Thus, by means of imagination and danced pantomime, a numinosity which was experienced in the animal and expressed as an animal might have readily been trans- formed into painting or sculpture. Then and there the numinous, conceived theriomorphically or anthromorphically, would have taken on a concrete shape, found expression in sharply outlined myths and cultic rites, and would have been made lastingly present through painting or sculpture. We can well imagine that during cultic and ritual events (which may have also had social significance, e.g., initiation), when religious experience was surely very intense, when feelings ran high and men were very open to the transcendent, the drive to express the numinous thus experi- enced came to a climax. The art which had been instituted by individual creative personalities would have remained historically irrelevant, however, if people had not continued it. But we can expect that they would have, if it was meeting a need which had become vital to a group of men; for the art in question, such a need would have arisen out of the especially deep relationship between man and animal which exists in many hunter cultures. Such hunters, however, belong for the most part to a more highly developed form of hunter culture which we call "Higher Hunter Culture." 42 It can be characterized by a marked augmentation, differentiation, and specialization of technique and of the hunter economy, in which an especially intensive preoccupation with the animal dominates man's interests. 41 For evaluations of this fact see W. Schmidt and H. Sedlmayr in Historia Mundi, Vol. I, ed. F. Valjavec (Bern and Munich, 1952), pp. 354 and 450-51; and A. Gehlen, op. cit., pp. 164-76. 42 For presentation of this type of hunter culture see Narr, Urgeschichte der Kultur, pp. 90-163. 19</page><page sequence="20">Approaches to the Religion of Early Paleolithic Man It is quite apparent that, during the Stone Age too, the animal played a predominant role in the spiritual world of such "higher hunters," insofar as that world is reflected in their art. Of course the same kind of world of ideas could have existed without artistic representation, but the fact that the first flowering of art was so closely bound up with such a content and with the aug- mentation and development of the hunter economy and culture can hardly be accidental. Furthermore, our observations of con- temporary "primitives" indicate that the world of the simple and undifferentiated hunter is not as radically centered in the animal as the world of specialized hunters tends to be. Thus it would be more than a mere argumentum ex silentio for us to maintain that animalistic features were at least not as fully present under the also simple and undifferentiated conditions of the earlier Paleo- lithic age as they were in later times, when they may have pushed more into the background other categories of the religious, as for example the idea of the Supreme Being. VI To conclude, we should say a few words about the problem of magic, which we touched upon earlier. We cannot get into an involved discussion about the essence of magic and its relationship to religion here.43 Instead we must be satisfied with a very general definition of magic as an activity which tries to compel the super- natural by means of definite practices, whereas in religion man approaches the deity conscious of his obligation ("religio") and his dependence. Understood in this way, magic, furthermore, cannot be reconciled with a true and pure idea of God. Whereas an out-of-date evolutionistic reconstruction would have religion arising from magic, thought to be the "more primitive" form of intercourse with the supernatural, today other scholars are pro- posing, on good grounds, that magical practices represent only the "applications" of old cult activities, no longer understood properly and emptied of their true religious meaning.44 Be that as it may, we can regard magic as something antagonistic to genuine religion which comes into being wherever religious life fades and 43 M. and R. Wax, "The Notion of Magic," Current Anthropology, Vol. IV (1963), is a review article whose authors evidently believe that they can master this difficult problem on the basis of that which has been published about it in the English language; therefore they are not acquainted with a number of important works. 44 Jensen, " Gibt es Zauberhandlungen ?" Zeitschrift fur Ethnologie, Vol. LXXV (1950). 20</page><page sequence="21">the idea of god is overrun with other notions.45 Thus magic is able to take over cultic forms and to rob them of their religious content, and we must take into account the possibility that this could have happened already in the case of prehistoric phenomena. The external form does not often allow us to make a clear-cut dis- tinction. Among the artwork of the old Stone Age there are many paint- ings of animals which have been wounded. Scholars have com- pared them with a custom existing among certain contemporary "primitives," in which men throw spears at such pictures or shoot them with arrows, in order to anticipate and to influence the hunt magically.46 However, such throwing or shooting is likely for the Paleolithic artwork only in a very few instances. Drawing weapons on pictures cannot be compared directly with the magical prac- tices in question; rather we can understand them as a perpetuation of success in the hunt. Moreover, even when we regard these pic- tures as evidence of sympathetic magic, this interpretation is not valid as an over-all interpretation for Paleolithic art. The fact that such interpretations have been offered, and that the generalization was so widely accepted, almost without contradiction, must probably be understood in light of the persistence of evolutionistic theories.47 On the one hand, it fits a certain schema in which a non-religious stage is followed by a period of magic, out of which the first genuine religion develops. On the other hand, it is fur- thered by the biogenetic rule which claims that children go through a stage of "prelogical and magical" activity which is also reflected in the prehistoric past of mankind as well as in the surviving remnants of "primitive" mankind. Among contemporary primitives, simple hunters practice magic, to be sure, but it clearly does not have the same significance for them as it does in other cultures. It is possible that the hunter's constant practical and transcendent confrontation with the animal as his most important partner led to important changes in the entire relationship. The increasing specialization of activity, growing preoccupation with the game, and improved mastery of adverse circumstances in the environment of "higher hunters" may have brought with it a general increase in self-consciousness and a feeling of superiority through which feelings of dependence 45 See Brunner, op. cit. 46 L. Frobenius, Das Unbekannte Afrika (1923), p. 34; F. Graebner, Das Weltbild der Primitiven (1924), p. 19. 47 See Narr, Urgeschichte der Kultur; "Anfiinge der bildenden Kunst," op. cit.; and "Sentido de arte Paleolithico," op. cit. 21</page><page sequence="22">Approaches to the Religion of Early Paleolithic Man and obligation would have diminished. Thus there would have been more of an opening for attempts to influence the super- natural powers for personal ends by means of magical practices and thus force success by using sorcery. (This may also be a factor in the suppression of the idea of the "Supreme Being.") Such reflections also lead us to assume that magic did not play such a significant or even predominant role in the early Paleolithic age as people have often ascribed to it. VII In all these problems, of course, we have no proof, strictly speak- ing, of anything. Our argumentation will always be colored by the general image that we have of early man. Nonetheless, in this respect the results of different branches of knowledge seem to converge on an image which no longer allows us to regard early man as an "ape-man," still animal-like and brutish. Clearly a new approach is demanded which cannot by-pass speculating about early religion. Even on this basis we shall, of course, not arrive at unconditional certainty; but we can find a methodologically defensible approach to the religion of early man. 22</page></plain_text>
