<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE RETURN OF THE NATIVE: THE RENAISSANCE OF TRIBAL RELIGIONS AS REFLECTED IN THE FICTION OF N. SCOTT MOMADAY Alan R. Velie Christianity has waxed and waned in the American Indian com- munity since Spanish missionaries made the first conversions in the fifteenth century. By the early twentieth century the vast majority of Indians had accepted some form of Christianity or other, either one of the mainline churches - Baptist, Methodist, Catholic - or the peyote cult of the Native American Church. Today there seems to be a move- ment, particularly among younger Indians, away from Christianity, back to traditional tribal beliefs and practices. This tendency is par- ticularly strong in the plains states, where the Lakota and other tribes have revived the Sun Dance. Vine Deloria, the Lakota writer who has been the leading American Indian philosopher over the past two decades, reports: On the reservations we are seeing amazing resiliency in restoring the old cere- monies. A massive shift in allegiance is occurring in most tribes away from Christianity and secularism and back towards the traditional ways. A surpris- ingly high percentage of Native American clergy are also doing traditional ceremonies and urban area churches are often the scene of traditional healing ceremonies. (253) According to Deloria, Indians have been motivated by nationalistic, ecological or spiritual considerations to move away from Christianity. Scott Momaday, the dean of American Indian writers, is a sensitive chronicler of life in Indian Country. His two novels, House Made of R&amp;L 26.1 (Spring 1994) 135</page><page sequence="2">136 Religion &amp; Literature Dawn and The Ancient Child, written twenty-one years apart, reflect to an extent the shift back towards traditional religions. The issue is a complex one, however, and what Momaday shows is that in certain ways some Indians who became Christian did so without abandoning their previous religion, and that in moving away from Christianity, they did not totally abandon that either. In his earlier novel, House Made of Dawn (1968), Momaday depicts two forms of Indian Christianity, Jemez Catholicism, and the peyote cult of the Native American Church. The novel's setting, "Walatowa," is based on Jemez Pueblo where he grew up. Momaday refers to the residents as "Tanoans," the language group to which the Jemez belong. Jemez Catholicism at the period that Momaday depicts - 1940s and 1950s - is a thorough combination of two very different belief systems, the Kachina Cult of the Pueblos, and the Catholicism brought in by the Conquistadors and Spanish missionaries. For years the priests simply sought to suppress the native religion, but although the Jemez became Christians they refused to abandon their old beliefs, and as the Church became more tolerant in the twentieth century, the religion of the Indians emerged as a blend of Christian and Tanoan elements. House Made of Dawn depicts the dramatic change in the attitude of the Catholic Church towards Tanoan religion between the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The priest at Jemez in 1945, Father Olguin, has a journal of a predecessor, Fray Nicolas, written in the 1870s. In it Nicolas reports with horror that his sacristan, Francisco, dances in the kiva - a chamber used for religious ceremonies - on traditional Tanoan holidays. Nicolas considers this Devil worship, and expects God to strike Francisco dead: Listen I told you of Francisco &amp; was right to say it. ... He is one of them &amp; goes often in the kiva &amp; puts on their horns and hides &amp; does worship that Serpent which even is the One our most ancient enemy. . . . Where is the Most Holy Spirit that he is not struck down at that moment? I have some expecta- tion of it always &amp; am disappointed. (50, 51) By 1945 the Church's attitude has softened towards Tanoan customs. On the Fiesta of Our Lady of the Angels Father Olguin takes visitors to see the native dancing, which has become part of the Catholic festivities. The ceremony is described from the point of view of Fran- cisco, Nicolas 's sacristan, now an old man: The shrine for Porcingula, Our Lady of the Angels, had been raised at the center of the north side and adjacent to the kiva. It was a small green enclosure, a</page><page sequence="3">ALAN R. VELIE 137 framework of wood and wire covered with boughs of cedar and pine. He [Fran- cisco] bowed before it although as yet there was nothing but the bare altar and benches inside. Tomorrow it would be made beautiful with candles and cloth and holy with incense. . . . And after mass the lovely Lady would be borne in procession from the church, and the little horse would come to greet her in the aisle, would precede her out into the Campo Santo and dance beside her in the streets; and the bull would lope all around and wheel and hook the air with its wooden horns, and the black-faced children, who were the invaders, and the clowns would follow, laughing and taunting with curses, on its heels. The Lady would stand all day in her shrine, and one by one the dancers of the squash and turquoise clans would appear on top of the kiva, coming out upon the sky in their rich ceremonial dress, descend the high ladder to the earth, and kneel before her. (73) This ceremony combines a number of disparate cultural elements. The "lovely Lady," the bull and the horse come from Europe by way of the Pecos Pueblo. The kiva dancing is native Jemez. The Pecos Pueblo, once one of the largest in New Mexico, was decimated over the course of the centuries by disease and the depredations of whites and Plains Indians. In 1838 the remaining tribal members - 20 in all - came to Jemez for asylum (Parsons 130). Momaday tells their story in House, calling them the "Bakyush." The Pecos brought with them bull and horse figures, and one of the Virgin, Our Lady of the Angels, whom they called "Porcingula." The bull and horse, originally from Spanish bullfighting, were borrowed from their Spanish American neighbors. The children in blackface represent the Moors the Spanish drove out of Spain. Porcingula comes ultimately from the Church of Santa Maria degli Angeli at Portiuncula, Italy, probably by way of Spain (Parsons 96). The dancing in the kiva, however, is native Tanoan. The squash and turquoise clans ran the two kivas at Jemez. Momaday does not describe the dancing that takes place in the kivas, although he mentions it. He relates in his memoir The Names that the most sacred Jemez ceremonies were private, and that at those times he and his parents "stayed on the reservation of the day school" (147). The Jemez, it seems, adopted Christianity without ever giving up their old religion. The narrator states in House: The people of the town ... do not hanker after progress and have never changed their essential way of life. Their invaders were a long time in conquering them; and now, after four centuries of Christianity, they still pray in Tanoan to the old deities of the earth and sky. (56) The traditional religion of Jemez is the Kachina Cult, which the Jemez share with other Pueblo peoples (Adams 1-18). Katchinas are spirits, many of them ancestors of the Pueblos, who act as intermedi-</page><page sequence="4">138 Religion &amp; Literature aries with the deities. The Kachina Cult seems to be a late addition to the original Pueblo religion, which centered on deities related to Meso-American gods - earth, sky and war, a horned serpent, and a spider woman.1 A more secular festival that also blends native and Catholic ritual is what Momaday calls the * 'feast of Santiago." Momaday places it on July 25, the date that Elsie Clews Parsons, the anthropologist who made the first detailed study of the Jemez, gives for the Jemez " Fiesta of San Thiago." In both Momaday's and Parson's accounts the chief activity of the day is a game in which riders try to pull a buried chicken out of the ground while galloping past it on horseback. Par- sons tells nothing about the saint; Momaday has Father Olguin relate his legend, in which he rides from New Mexico into Mexico where he performs heroically at games held by a king, winning the hand of the king's daughter. When the king tries to have him killed, Santiago destroys the king's soldiers with the aid of a magic rooster. Santiago then sacrifices the rooster by tearing it apart, and its body parts become plants and animals for the use of the Pueblo people. St. Iago is St. James the Apostle, whose day is celebrated July 25. James, also known as James the Less, son of Alpheus, was long iden- tified with James the brother of Jesus. Today scholars generally agree the brother and the apostle were different men. Neither, of course, had anything to do with New Mexico. In fact, Father Olguin 's narra- tive looks far more like two Indian genres, the trickster tale and the myth of origin (the two are frequently combined), than it does the life of a saint. The chicken pull game is of course appropriate (symboli- cally, if not morally) to a saint who sacrifices a rooster for the good of his people.2 It is not difficult to see why Pueblo Indians would accept Catholi- cism without thinking it necessary to relinquish their other beliefs. They were polytheistic to begin with, and if the Spanish missionaries insisted on the divinity of the Trinity, what harm in adding them to the pantheon? And Catholic churches have stood in the center of Pueblo villages for centuries now. Parish records at Jemez, for in- stance, go back to 1720. As Momaday puts it in The Names: The Roman Catholic churches of the pueblos are so old, many of them, that they seem scarcely to impose an alien aspect upon the native culture; rather, they seem themselves almost to have been appropriated by that culture and to express it in its own terms. (123)3 Momaday also shows a very different sort of Indian religion in his depiction of the peyote cult of the Native American Church. The reli-</page><page sequence="5">ALAN R. VELIE 139 gious leader of this group in House Made of Dawn is Rev. John Big Bluff Tosamah, Pastor and Priest of the Sun at the Los Angeles Holi- ness Pan-Indian Rescue Mission. Tosamah is particularly interesting in that he is based on Momaday himself, though more of a caricature than a self-portrait. Like Momaday, Tosamah is Kiowa, and both are "big, lithe as a cat, and narrow eyed" (85). And, most remarkably, when Tosamah tells about his forebears and background, he delivers the autobiographical account Momaday had published in The Way to Rainy Mountain. We see Tosamah in his religious capacity on two occasions, once preaching a sermon on the Gospel according to John, and once at a peyote session. The sermon is interesting because Tosamah contrasts Indian and white attitudes towards the sacred nature of language. The title "Reverend," the phrase "Holiness . . . Rescue Mission," and the sermon on John suggest Christianity, but Tosamah preaches an interesting variation of the religion. Tosamah 's sermon is based solely on the opening phrase of John, "In the beginning was the Word. ..." According to Tosamah, John was struck with an epiphanic revelation: Old John, see, he got up one morning and caught sight of the Truth. It must have been like a bolt of lightning, and the sight of it made him blind. . . . That was the moment of revelation, inspiration, Truth. (86) Tosamah believes that the revelation that the universe began with the Word should have satisfied John, but John goes on to say "and the Word was with God, and the Word was God." Here Tosamah be- lieves John goes too far: It was the Truth, all right, but it was more than the Truth. The Truth was overgrown with fat, and the fat was God. The fat was John's God, and God stood between John and the Truth. (86) John, being a white man, couldn't stop with his revelation. He needed to embellish it, and bring it into accord with his notion of a personal, anthropomorphic God. Tosamah refers to God not only as God, but also as the Great Spirit. This might simply be a way of making his Indian audience feel at home in a Christian setting, but Tosamah is the Priest of the Sun. In the Sun Dance religion, the sun is not an anthropomorphic deity but a powerful spirit force. The ideas that Tosamah advances in this story are Momaday's own. At the heart of Momaday 's conception of reality is his sacred regard for language. For Momaday, humanity's existence and essence are rooted in language, as Matthias Schubnell explains:</page><page sequence="6">140 Religion &amp; Literature His considerations are rooted in the belief that man's existence and reality find their fullest manifestation in language. The notion that "we don't really begin ... to exist until we convert ourselves into language" is an underlying theme in Momaday's work. (40) In his essay "The Man Made of Words," Momaday articulates his belief that "in a certain sense we are all made of words; . . . our essen- tial being consists in language" (qtd. in Schubnell 41). Momaday's personal ideas about the nature of language are bol- stered by beliefs of Southwestern tribes like the Navajos and Pueblos he lived among while growing up. Anthropologist Gary Witherspoon states: "In the Navajo view of the world, language is not a mirror of reality; reality is a mirror of language" (qtd. in Schubnell 49). Given these ideas, it is not surprising that Momaday links language and creation. Although Tosamah apparently believes in some sense in God the Father of Christianity, he is also clearly polytheistic. Tosamah tells the story of a Kiowa man who while wandering in the wilderness hears a voice, and is confronted by a figure with the feet of a deer, and a body covered with feathers. It says, "Take me with you," and from that day Tai-me has belonged to the Kiowas. For Tosamah, the story of Tai-me "represents the oldest and best idea that man has of himself" (90). Tai-me is both the feathered spirit, and the sacred fetish of the Sun Dance. Momaday relates that he had a chance to view the fetish, and that in doing so he experienced "one of the most intensely religious feelings he had ever known" (Schubnell 142). We also see Tosamah officiating at a peyote ceremony. Indians of the Rio Grande Valley of what is now Texas and northern Mexico had used peyote for medical and ritual purposes for thousands of years. With white settlement of the West in the late nineteenth century, and the conquest of the Indians and their forcible settlement in proximity to one another in Oklahoma, use of peyote spread quickly among the tribes. The Lipan Apaches introduced the Kiowas and Comanches to peyote ceremonies, and soon the cult had spread to tribes all over Indian and Oklahoma territories. By the early years of the twentieth century the cult had spread to the upper middle west as well. As younger Indians joined, the cult became more Christian, adding prayers, preaching, and baptism (Stewart 153). Despite Christian elements, many whites in supervisory positions over the Indians objected to the use of peyote, and attempted to get it banned by federal law. In 1916 Rep. Harry Gandy of South Dakota and Sen. W. W. Thompson of Kansas introduced legislation to outlaw</page><page sequence="7">ALAN R. VELIE 141 peyote, but Sen. Robert L. Owen of Oklahoma was able to block and ultimately defeat the legislation with the aid of testimony by Indians and anthropologists, most importantly James Mooney. Indians, frightened by the close call, organized a Native American Church. Article II of the Church constitution states: The purpose for which this corporation is formed is to foster and promote the religious belief of the several tribes of Indians in the State of Oklahoma, in the Christian religion with the practice of the Peyote Sacrament as commonly understood and used among the adherents of this religion in the several tribes of Indians in the State of Oklahoma, and to teach the Christian religion with morality, sobriety, industry, kindly charity and right living and to cultivate a spirit of self-respect and brotherly union among the members of the Native Race of Indians, including therein the various Indian tribes in the State of Oklahoma. (Stewart 225) The peyote ceremony, as Tosamah performs it, is clearly a blend of Christian and non-Christian elements. Tosamah starts by describ- ing the chemical qualities of peyote: "It contains nine narcotic alka- loids of the isoquinoline series" but goes on to say that "Daddy peyote is the vegetal representation of the sun," linking peyote to the old Sun Dance religion (101). Tosamah performs a detailed ritual with tobacco and cedar incense, but no preaching or prayers. The celebrants then testify and pray. Henry Yellowbull invokes spiritual help but does not name the force he is praying to. Instead he asks it to "Come to us in bright colors and sweet smoke" (104). Cristobal Cruz, Tosamah's assistant, and the fireman at the peyote ceremony, prays "in Jesus' name" (105). Napoleon Kills-in-the-Timber invokes the Great Spirit, and Ben Benally sees a "house made of dawn," a vision from a Navajo prayer chant. In short, Indian religions in House Made of Dawn, Pueblo Catholi- cism and the Peyote Cult, are a blend of Christianity and the religions that the tribes had practiced before their contact with whites. In Momaday's second novel, The Ancient Child (1989), the Christian com- ponent in Indian religion has diminished substantially. The Peyote Cult is again depicted, but this time the native religious elements, both Kiowa and Navajo, are much stronger than the Christian. The Ancient Child extends the conventions of the novel; perhaps the best generic description is the term "telling" that Momaday applies to Leslie Silko's Ceremony. Leslie Silko's Ceremony is an extraordinary novel if indeed " novel" is the right word. It is more precisely a telling, the celebration of a tradition and form that are older and more nearly universal than the novel as such. {Ceremony, jacket copy)</page><page sequence="8">142 Religion &amp; Literature As Silko does in Ceremony, Momaday bases his fiction on an Indian myth, in this case the Kiowa tale of the boy who changes into a bear.4 Momaday quotes Borges as his epigraph: "For myth is at the begin- ning of literature, and also at its end." Myth for Borges is, I would imagine, primarily a literary matter. For Silko it is also culturally or ethnically important, and for Momaday it has religious significance as well. The story of the boy/bear has for Momaday the force of Scrip- ture to a Christian - perhaps not a fundamentalist Christian, but cer- tainly a believing Christian. The Ancient Child is about a man who changes into a bear. This metamorphosis may make the book sound like fantasy, but that would imply that Momaday doesn't believe that sort of transformation possi- ble. He has asserted in interviews that in some important sense - and not simply symbolically - men do become bears. While he was still working on the book, he told Chuck Woodard: It [Devils Tower] is the sacred place in Kiowa tradition, and it is the place where the boy turned into a bear. I identify with that boy. I have for many years. And I have struggled with my bear power through those years. . . . Set, [The Ancient Child] my work in progress, is about the boy who turns into a bear, and in a sense I am writing about myself. I'm not writing an autobiography, but I am imagining a story that proceeds out of my own experience of the bear power. (13) He adds later: "I am a bear, I do have this capacity to become a bear. The bear sometimes takes me over and I am transformed" (14). In The Ancient Child the man who becomes a bear is Locke Setman, a nationally renowned painter, Kiowa by birth, but ignorant about his heritage. His parents die when he is young, and he is raised in San Francisco by a white philosophy professor. On a trip to Oklahoma to attend the funeral of a relative, Set, as he is called, meets Grey, a mixed-blood Kiowa-Navajo medicine woman, who gives him a sacred medicine bundle. Set goes back to San Francisco, but the bundle exerts a strange power over him, until he has a nervous breakdown. He returns to Oklahoma and puts himself totally in Grey's control. Set and Grey travel to the dine, the Navajo Reservation, where Grey has Set undergo a regimen of ritual and training until finally, at the base of Devils Tower - using poetic license Momaday moves the monolith from Wyoming to Arizona - Set turns into a bear. Set is the Kiowa word for "bear"; the surname "Setman" ob- viously "bearman." Momaday weaves in other myths along with the Kiowa. "Set" is the name of the Egyptian god of the desert regarded as the embodiment of evil; when Set turns into the bear (in the</page><page sequence="9">ALAN R. VELIE 143 Arizona desert), he feels the power of evil within him. Locke's child- hood nickname is "Loki," the Germanic god who takes on many shapes. Grey compares herself to Callisto, the beloved of Zeus, whom Hera turned into a bear. Grey is the chief religious figure in the book. She, like Tosamah, practices an eclectic religion which blends elements borrowed from Kiowa and Navajo religions with the Peyote Cult. Grey's great- grandmother, Kope'mah, a Kiowa medicine woman who had partici- pated in the last Sun Dances of the nineteenth century, initiates Grey into the mysteries of the Tai-me religion. Grey continues to commune with her grandmother after the old woman dies. Together they plan Set's metamorphosis. The chief religious object of the Tai-me religion is the medicine bundle. Kope'mah gives one to Grey, who in turn gives it to Set. The bundle is a set of sacred objects wrapped in a red blanket - the skin of a bear cub, a grizzly paw, pouches of tobacco and herbs, fluorite and quartz crystals, a pipestone carved in the shape of a fish, the penis of a wolf, and bits of bone and scalp (242). When Grey gives the bun- dle to Set, he feels "a kind of euphoria, as if he had taken a strong drink." He also feels a sense of death, and "the darkest power - until this moment he would have named it 'evil' - he had ever known" (115). This power of evil oppresses Set until finally he cracks and, in spite of the strongest of Kiowa taboos, opens the bundle and strews its contents around. His friends find him unconscious on the floor, his studio a shambles reeking of vomit and urine. Grey's Navajo relatives live in Lukachukai, in the northeast corner of Arizona. In order to help her with Set's metamorphosis Grey enlists her old lover, Perfecto Atole, the "keeper of a bear's paw." Atole, fortified with peyote tea, astride an evil black mare named Swastika, chases Set around like a stray calf, then slashes him across the throat with the bear paw. The chase is a ritual, part of Set's preparation for his transformation. Shortly before his metamorphosis, Set marries Grey in a peyote ceremony. The narrator describes the paraphernalia: "herbs and pollens, a gourd rattle, pots and liquors and teas, peyote pastes, feather fans, a bowl of water, and an eagle-bone whistle" (298). The narrator refers to songs and prayers, and describes how Grey and Set stand before an altar while the priest "gave the firestick to the fire." Nothing indicates that there is a Christian element to the ceremony. The one mention of Christianity as an element of Indian religion has to do with a minor figure in the novel, the Rev. Milo Mottled-</page><page sequence="10">144 Religion &amp; Literature mare. The preacher and his wife are described as "fine Christian folk" (59). We hear later that Mottledmare has been to Lawton, Oklahoma on "church business," doing "the Lord's work" (65). When we see Rev. Mottledmare at a religious ritual it is a peyote ceremony, in which he assists Grey. Milo recites prayers in Kiowa and English, but we don't learn what sort of prayers they are. Perhaps the narrator's reference to "bear medicine" to describe Grey's actions indicates that the theology is traditional Kiowa rather than Christian. And so, in conclusion, it seems that Momaday's novels, written a generation apart, reflect the recent attenuation of Christianity in American Indian religion, coupled with a return to traditional tribal beliefs. There is no specific rejection of Christianity in The Ancient Child, but the traces of it in Indian religion have become a good deal fainter as the native elements have become stronger. The interest in ethnic roots is common to many other sorts of Americans, but seems to be particularly strong among Indians, whose numbers have in- creased dramatically over the past decade because more mixed-bloods choose to identify themselves as Indian. Religion lies at the heart of most cultures, and as Indians seek to establish their ethnicity, they revive tribal rituals and beliefs. Scott Momaday's fiction chronicles the trend. University of Oklahoma NOTES 1. The squash and turquoise clans ran the two kivas at Jemez. Momaday does not describe the dancing that takes place in the kivas, although he mentions it. He relates in his memoir The Names that the most sacred Jemez ceremonies were private, and that at those times he and his parents " stayed on the reservation of the day school" (147). 2. The blend of Christian and " pagan" elements together in the Jemez festivals may seem odd, or even blasphemous to Christians, but there is certainly precedent for it outside the Indian community. For much of the first century Christianity was essentially a form of Judaism. The breach between the religions came when Peter and Paul released Christians from the necessity of following the commandments of Deuteronomy and Leviticus concerning dietary laws and circumcision, to facilitate the conversion of gentiles. Over the centuries each people that became Christian brought its own customs and rituals into the religion, which ultimately fragmented into many sects. Although the theological differences don't go as far as including new deities, in examining religions ranging from Unitarianism through evangelical Protestantism and Roman Catholicism, one finds considerable difference in what Christians consider divine.</page><page sequence="11">ALAN R. VELIE 145 3. Perhaps the most similar religion to Pueblo Catholicism outside of the Indian world would be the Voodoo Cults of Haiti and New Orleans. As Voodoo became Christianized in the nineteenth century, its African gods, the loos, became Christian saints: e.g., Legba transformed into St. Peter, and Damballah into St. Patrick. 4. Silko employs a series of fertility myths similar in many ways to the myth of the Holy Grail, Fisher King and Wasteland. I have written about this at length in Four American Indian Literary Masters. Silko alternates the myths with her own narrative of events in postwar New Mexico. The contemporary events are a reworking of the actions of the myths in terms of realistic conventions.
