JONES Health Physics Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, Tennessee WILLHOIT, DONALD G. AND JONES, TROYCE D. Dose and LET Dis- tributions in Small-Animal Sized Cylinders for a Fission Neutron Spec- trum. Radiat. Res. 44, 263-272 (1970). Monte Carlo sampling techniques were used to produce neutron histories in tissue geometries corresponding in size to the mouse, rat and guinea pig. Dose and LET distributions were evaluated for 60,000 to 80,000 normally incident neutrons having an energy distribution corresponding to that of the Health Physics Research Reactor (HPRR) spectrum. For these geome- tries, 99 % of the dose delivered by recoil nuclei was from elastic scattering with H, O, C, and N. The dose averaged over the volume of each animal was 94, 84, and 78 per cent of kerma for tissue for free space (2.2 X 10- erg g- neutron-' cm2) for the mouse, rat, and guinea pig, respectively. For these geometries, unilateral exposure results in maximum to minimum dose ratios greater than 1.30, which according to the ICRU recommenda- tions are classified as "nonuniform" irradiation condition. These data indicate that rotation of the animals in the field would result in a "uniform" (variation less than 15 %) irradiation condition. The distribution of dose as a function of LET was not markedly de- pendent on depth in the animal geometries. The dose median LET was estimated to be about 50 keV/Y for these geometries for the HPRR neu- tron spectrum. INTRODUCTION According to the International Commission on Radiological Units and Measure- ments (ICRU), complete specification of the physical factors of irradiation for radiobiological purposes should include (1): 1 Research sponsored by the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission under contract with the Union Carbide Corporation. 2 Consultant: Department of Environmental Sciences and Engineering.

The time distribution of absorbed dose. 3. The variation on a microscopic scale of local energy density. This is pri- marily related to the linear energy transfer (LET) of the charged particles that deliver the dose. Frequently in radiobiological studies utilizing neutrons, only the kerma at a point in space (or one of the interpretations of first-collision dose) is specified due to a lack of suitable instrumentation for measuring dose and LET distributions of dose in small geometries. As an alternative to direct measurements, Auxier, Snyder, and Jones (2) have calculated dose and LET distributions resulting from monoenergetic neutrons incident on an anthropomorphic phantom using computer techniques. These techniques have been extended to geometries corresponding in size to a mouse, rat, and guinea pig. The primary purpose of this study was to provide dosimetric information for radiobiological studies at the Dosar facility, Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), utilizing the Health Physics Research Reactor (HPRR) as a source of neutrons. CALCULATION OF DOSE AND LET DISTRIBUTIONS The dose and LETo distributions analyzed in this study were calculated at ORNL using Monte Carlo sampling techniques to produce neutron interaction histories in tissue cylinders for incident neutrons, having an energy distribution corresponding to the HPRR spectrum (Fig. 1). Except for tissue composition and size of tissue cylinders, the method of calculation was the same as described by Snyder (3) and Auxier, Snyder, and Jones (2). The atomic composition of tissue was considered to be hydrogen (62.9%), carbon (6.3 %), oxygen (28.9 %), and nitrogen (1.8 %). The corresponding percentages by weight were 10.0, 12.1, 73.8, and 4.0 for H, C, O, and N respectively. Dimensions were selected to approximate those of a young adult male animal. The cylinder height and diameter, in cm, were 7.5 X 2.5, 15 X 5, 21 X 7, for the mouse, rat, and guinea pig, respectively. In these calculations a plane, monodirectional neutron source with uniform fluence is assumed. The cylindrical geometry is divided into 5 layers and each layer into 5 concentric annuli (2). Each layer is further divided into 6 equal sectors, giving a total of 150 volume elements in the cylinder. The case history of each incident neutron is traced and the dose for each of 12 LET intervals (Table I) and the total dose are recorded for each volume element. Due to symmetry there are only 20 unique volume elements per layer and only three unique layers. A total of 33 dif- ferent interaction processes are considered (Table II). Of these, four are the elastic interactions with H, C, N, and O. The remaining 29 interactions are of the inelastic or nonelastic types. One of the approximations made in these calculations is that the energy imparted to charged particles is absorbed within the same volume element in which the inter-</page><page sequence="3">DIOSE AND LET DISTRIBUTIONS 265 0.1 1_ ' I I I 1 1 1 1111 I IH NEUTRON LEAKAGE SPECTRUM FROM HPRR - / I\ : 0.001 1 '1 z - 0.0001 0.00001 I 1 111II I 1 111 .01 0.1 I 10 E(MeV)---* FIG. 1.

N(n,t)C action occurs, i.e., that absorbed dose is equal to kerma. This is a satisfactory as- sumption if the range of a charged particle is small compared to the dimensions of the volume element. The maximum range of recoil protons from monoenergetic neutrons is: 0.07 mm, 0.2 mm, and 0.5 mm for neutron energies of 2.0 MeV, 4.0 MeV, and 6.0 MeV respectively (4). The smallest dimensions of the volume ele- ments in the geometries considered in this study were in the mouse geometry where the annuli were 2.5 mm wide. Thus, the maximum range of protons is approximately 3 % of the thickness of the volume element at 2.0 MeV, 8% at 4.0 MeV, and 20 % at 6.0 MeV. Since only 3% of the HPRR spectrum is above 4 MeV, the difference between absorbed dose and kerma at any given location in these geometries would not likely exceed 1%.</page><page sequence="5">DOSE AND LET DISTRIBUTIONS 267 ABSORBED DOSE DISTRIBUTIONS Some statistics of the neutron histories for the three geometries are summarized in Table III. Calculations were based on 80,000 neutron histories for the mouse and rat and 60,000 for the guinea pig. The total number of neutron interactions ranged from 100,000 for the mouse to nearly half a million for the guinea pig due to the fact that multiple scatter increases very rapidly with an increase in the diameter of the irradiated cylinder. The number of gamma rays produced increased very sharply in relation to the total number of neutron interactions for the rat and guinea pig compared to the mouse, primarily due to the increased number of neutrons reaching thermal energies and then undergoing the (n, y) capture reaction with hydrogen. The distribution of absorbed dose as a function of type of interaction process is shown in Table IV. Elastic scattering is by far the most important energy transfer process resulting in 99 % of the dose for the mouse and rat, and only slightly less for the guinea pig. Nonelastic processes, excluding gamma interactions, account for about 1% of the dose for these geometries. The dose from gamma rays produced by inelastic processes is essentially negligible for the mouse and rat and only 1% for the guinea pig. In man, elastic scattering accounts for approximately 80 % of the dose and gamma rays from inelastic reactions contribute about 18% of the dose (2). A convenient way to express absorbed dose is as a percent of the kerma for free space, the number usually supplied by the dosimetrist. Table V shows the data expressed in this manner. The average value of kerma for free space for the HPRR spectrum used in these calculations was 2.2 X 10- erg/g (tissue) per neutron/cm2 For the mouse the average absorbed dose is 93.5 % of kerma.

Also of interest and concern from the dosimetry standpoint is the distribution of absorbed dose within the animal. The variation of dose as a function of position along the axis of each of the cylinders was examined since it was expected that the dose to the end layers would be less than in the middle layer. However, it was found that the differences between doses to the various layers were small, probably due to the fact that the number of multiply scattered neutrons is rather low for these geometries. To make comparisons as a function of depth, dose values for the five layers were averaged to reduce statistical variations. These absorbed dose values were then plotted as a percent of the neutron kerma for free space as shown in Figs. 2 through 4 for the mouse, rat, and guinea pig, respectively.

The minimum dose of 75 % of kerma is found in the segment at the exit surface. The maximum absorbed dose in the rat is also 107 % of kerma, which occurs in one of the segments on the entrance surface and falls off to 52 % of kerma at the exit surface. The stand- ard error of the dose expressed as a percentage of the dose for each segment is indi- cated in parentheses in Figs. 2-4. The dose averaged over the volume of each of the three cylinders was 93.5 - 0.3 %, 84.3 ? 0.2 %, and 78.1 ? 0.2 % of the kerma for free space for the mouse, rat, and guinea pig, respectively. The corresponding midline dose (dose averaged over volume elements around axis of cylinder) and standard error for each cylinder was 96 ?t 5% (mouse), 78 ? 3% (rat), and 71 ? 3% (guinea pig) of the kerma for free space. The importance of detailed dose distribution data is indicated by the appreciable difference between average and midline absorbed dose for the rat and guinea pig geometries. Due to the smaller volume of the midline volume elements, the precision of the dose calculations for these elements is less than for those on the periphery. The ICRU recommends that the uniformity of dose distribution be classified according to the ratio of the maximum to minimum absorbed dose within the irradiated specimen (1). Using their criteria, an irradiation may be classified as "uniform irradiation" if the ratio of maximum to minimum absorbed dose does not RAT UNILATERAL EXPOSURE HPRR SPECTRUM 107.0 73.5 ( 2.2)l (I.9) 99.4 72.0 (24 (2. 1) 94.4 72.9 102.5 86.1 75.0 51.6 (3.1) 102.8 (3.4) (3.3) 55.8 (2.4) (3. 5) 97.0 78.3 78.9 66. 2 (2.7) ( 4. 1 )1 96.0 5.3) (5.9) 72.91 (3.6) NEUTRONI (5.5) 82.6\ /71.4 (4.7) BEAM (7.2) (7.c ) I"- 5 cm -----------j FIG. 3.

If the ratio exceeds 1.15 but is less than 1.30, the irradiation is classified as "moderately uniform." The irradiation is to be classified as "nonuniform" if the ratio exceeds 1.30. Two simple ways to improve the uniformity of absorbed dose are to use either bilateral exposure or to rotate the animal in the exposure field. Table VI shows the computed ratio and standard error of maximum to minimum absorbed dose for the mouse, rat, and guinea pig for the three irradiation conditions. With due reservations imposed by the statistical variations inherent in the calculation of the ratios, the following observations may be made: rotation of the animal in the radiation field results in a "uniform irradia- tion" condition; bilateral irradiation results in ratios which fall in the "moderately uniform" irradiation classification; and, under conditions of unilateral irradiation, even in a geometry as small as a mouse, the irradiation must be classified as "non- uniform irradiation" since the ratio exceeds 1.30.</page><page sequence="9">DOSE AND LET DISTRIBUTIONS 271 20 - INCIDENT SURFACE -- - -- ...

Goodman and Pearlman (5) have obtained experimental dose distribution data in a mouse-sized phantom (3.8 cm diameter) for the HPRR using a small tissue- equivalent ionization chamber. Their data indicate a maximum to minimum dose ratio of 1.47 (110/75) for unilateral exposure and an average absorbed dose of 95 % of kerma for free space. Their data are in reasonable agreement with the values in Table VI considering that their measurements included the dose due to prompt gamma rays from the reactor. LET DISTRIBUTION OF DOSE The LET distribution of dose was examined as a function of depth in the tissue cylinders and as a function of position along the central axis. Figure 5 shows the fraction of dose, D(LET), as a function of LET interval for the entrance and exit positions in the rat. The dose median LET was 53 keV/4 at the entrance surface and 50 keV/M at the exit surface. Comparison of LET distributions in segments at various locations within the three animal geometries indicates that there is no marked difference in the distributions for the three geometries which could be at- tributed to other than statistical variations.</page><page sequence="10">272 WILLHOIT AND JONES In order for there to be a change in the LET distribution of dose, there would have to be a significant change in the neutron energy spectrum. The fact that the number of multiply scattered neutrons is small in these geometries would indicate that the neutron spectrum is not significantly altered in penetration to these depths. Thus, it is concluded that for the HPRR spectrum the LET distribution of dose is not a sensitive function of depth in small tissue geometries. RECEIVED: February 20, 1970 REFERENCES 1.
