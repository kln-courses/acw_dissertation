<plain_text><page sequence="1">Hugh Stretton Nugatory Notes APART FROM THE CIGARETTE BURN through chapter tWO ?**&gt; there is nothing wrong with my book except the trifle of five chapters not being written yet and a certain amount of child art from forgetting to keep it five feet from the floor at all times. Never mind now, here is this Junior supposed to be telling me The Causes of World War One and all she does is babble of objectivity. I should do something about her prose if I had the time. Objectivity, hell. Objectivity is how many pages are in Courtney T. Whelen's book. Subjectivity on the other hand is whether it is intelligent. Even IQs are not as ob jective as was once thought and for a book to be intelligent is subjective absolutely. Scarcely anything is worse. Courtney is not subjective, he is an Associate Professor. Promotion is another thing that has got to be objective lest rank favoritism slip in. My father liked the joke, he always said you could rely on the old ones, they had stood the test of time, about the drunk looking for his dime under a street lamp. "Where did you lose it?" "Down the alley." "Why look for it here?" "Ya can't see a thing down there, stoopid." That one knew about objectivity before even the committees on tenure and promotion dropped to it. Why pretty soon they are going to put the professors themselves on the weighing machine; there has been all this subjectivity slipping in with the big and little typefaces and the hardcover-paperback gamble, you can't trust the weighing ma chine with a book any more. But put the professor on and there you have him. If it says one hundred eighty-two, why you know any machine in the country would say just that. So instead of getting on with chapter three which nastily 112</page><page sequence="2">Nugatory Notes exposes various explanatory devices of pragmatic sociology, especially Courtney T. Whelen's, what must I do but read forty-seven papers on The Causes of World War One which say things like "The fixaton of guilt upon one particular set of circumstances is secondary to ascertaning the situation which allowed such a conflagration to develop." Courtney would know what to write in the margin of that. "Ugh!" Or because this particular one is pretty, "Darling, learn to write." She likes that. Her mother is a part time clerk in a drugstore and she makes out in a place like this on a schol arship and the Student Loan. It means a lot when Associate Professors fraternize. Well anyway?"Interesting but could be clearer. C minus." Now where was I... the logic of historical explanation which covertly inhabits any operational definitions is such as to render even Zetterbergs austere tests nugatory. And I com plain about a little thing like a conflagration?why that girl never got within a long spit of nugatory. Try Operational defi nitions conceal an historical logic which escapes even Zetter bergys tests. Bad but better. Non-conflagratory. The trouble with that girl, it costs too much to teach her. What ought to be done to that paper would cost a day would cost five pages would cost promotion would cost cash. Because nobody would see me do it and it would still be subjective if they did. I would be imparting literacy, and if anything is more subjective than teaching, literacy is. Meanwhile I have a transmission job com ing up at around a hundred and twenty five dollars and one summer left before some highly objective school fees set in. But concentrate: The purpose of this demonstration of the historical element in such operational definitions is not to denigrate them as lack ing in objectivity, it is to denigrate objectivity as lacking in relevance to such definitions. Aaaaaghgh. Try It escapes Zetter berg}s tests because they test for objectivity. Objectivity can be a quality of measurement, but not of explanation. Courtney never writes things twice, and this is not because he gets them right the first time. But then he chooses better-known 113</page><page sequence="3">The Massachusetts Review things to say. Courtney has developed many a conflagration, and in print. The sad thing is how bright that girl was born. Traces remain: "Thus Renouvin arrives at what he considers to be the least common denominator or last differentiating ele ment." Barbaric. But a thought, true, and her own. She detects the man's trick. She could go right on and see what is wrong with the trick if only someone ... look, I have children to feed, and preferably not at Ohio State where in any case they prob ably publish even faster. To this girl it would have to be spelled out as to a child, bit by bit, slow and friendly. None of that "Try words instead of bubblegum" and "Button up?your concepts are showing." Not brisk or flip or friv. It would take three words per word of hers and there are two thousand of hers. Divide by half for speed, multiply by the twenty other conflagrationists in this batch, and it would cost ten days would cost fifty pages would cost.... But it occurs to my very inventive conscience that what she has done has all the macabre charm of a horror movie and per haps it would interest a wider, etc. Because it is genuine. It is none of your pastiche jargon pieces concocted by some professor of English for a despair-piece in a teachers' magazine. In full faith and innocence she thought that she thought those thoughts. When I reflect that she is twenty, she has been three years at this place which is right up there in the ivy with Vassar and Smith, she has a two-point-eight average and she wrote this, it has me wondering what they are being encouraged to go on thinking in say the Teachers College belt. So maybe she and I ought to print this piece with marginalia in some maga zine that really pays and fix the Student Loan and the kicking transmission with a fifty-fifty split. For all those deeply con cerned several times weekly by this Crisis in Our Colleges we now rend the veil for a rare glimpse of what is positively not characterizing that intimate faculty-student relationship around which after all the whole educational, etc. Courtney certainly does not let his attention wander from his book like this. Fortunately she left a wide margin. "Historically speaking" she says and I quote "the fixaton" 114</page><page sequence="4">Nugatory Notes (every word of this is sic so why single out this one) "of guilt upon one particular set of circumstances is secondary to ascertan ing the situation which allowed the conflagration to develop. The choice between different interpretations of an historical event involves both objectivity and subjectivity. That is to say problems of an historiographical nature deal with objective fact and the subsequent personal involvement that derives from selection and emphasis of these facts." So here we go. Look up guilt in a dictionary, circumstances cannot have it. This is not unnecessary pedantry. It is necessary pedantry. Through the rest of this essay you use a textbook classification of explanations, and this classification depends on distinctions between guilt and responsibility and cause. If you want to use those categories you must not muddle those distinctions. Next what is this difference between circumstances and situation? Perhaps you wanted to distinguish part of the situation from all of it. If you meant to do that you could have written "We must understand the whole situation before we can judge the importance of its parts." But that makes "secondary" mean "later" and it commonly means "less important." But I guess it means later here, because it is going to contradict your conclusion on page six if it doesn't. Another thing, subjectivity and objectivity are words you do not use in my class unless you have had instruction in philosophy and know what you are doing. There is a safe alternative in the translation of these sentences suggested later on. Did you really mean "historio graphical"? History is about history and historiography is about books. I suspect you of just liking to be graphic but since the sentence could make sense either way, you are forgiven this time. But not for the adjectival phrase "of a . .. nature" which does nothing the adjective would not do except clutter the sentence. This next "objective" does nothing for its fact in your mind which does not contain any concept of a non-objec tive fact. "Subsequent" could have a crude meaning which would be unnecessary or a less crude meaning which would be wrong. If it means that history is written after it has happened you need not bother to say so. If it means that the historian's 115</page><page sequence="5">The Massachusetts Review bias arises after he has decided what to abstract and identify as facts, it is untrue. Do you mean "personal involvement"? Do you mean the historian's self-identification with other people, or do you mean his passions or his values or his morality or his social theories or his political commitments or his what? Whatever it is, you are prevented from writing it by a disease called psychologism whose sufferers feel compelled to change all statements of thought into statements about the conditioning of the thinker. You seem to use personal involvement to mean purpose, which it does not mean, though it might sometimes explain why a man has a purpose. But you are simultaneously using personal involvement to separate subjective from ob jective thoughts (which you may if you wish, just this once, call normative from technical thoughts); and personal involve ment cannot separate these for you. Historians can be passion ately involved in an exact count of say corpses and entertain the most eccentric moralities with bored airs of detachment. If you want crude, vague distinguishers, try "knowledge" and "judgment." And in any case you are saying the opposite of what you mean. You do not mean that the personal involve ment derives from the selection of facts. You mean that the selection of facts derives from the personal involvement. This is the first of eleven syntactical reversals of intended meaning in this essay, which you will find noted in the margin as you go along. But before you go along, here is a translation of the last two sentences: "Historians have to select facts as well as discover them. Their different purposes make them disagree about the choice of facts, though not usually about their truth." It can't be quite what you meant to say, or you would have said something more like it. Please understand that I am not complaining about the argument your words conceal, though I don't agree with it, or about your style, though it insults a ver satile language, or that you don't communicate clearly, though you certainly don't. What bothers me is that you do not seem to understand that all this bad language prevents thought inside your head. For example if you had turned the sentence around 116</page><page sequence="6">Nugatory Notes into transitive form, or used a sensible intransitive verb instead of "derive," you would have got "personal involvement" doing such clearly silly things that you would have thought again, as well as writing again. Nor am I complaining about jargon. Be as ugly and technical as you like, but the test of a technical word is whether it excludes more unwanted meaning than a plain word would do, and includes more wanted meaning than a plain word would. "Personal involvement" probably excludes what you intended and certainly includes what you did not in tend. So it goes. Presently it stops. I eat. I wipe up what others failed to eat or tried to eat twice. There is a parlor baseball episode and I wipe up after that too, carnations and water and fragments of what contained them, all fortunately past their best at the time. Their mother cleans them and I tell about various anthropomorphic rabbits and kiss them goodnight and get them drinks of water and kiss them goodnight and hell, no, you've had all you're due for and kiss them goodnight. At this point I might as well kiss their mother goodnight too for all she is likely to see of me for the rest of this night. Around nine oh five I am declaring that Mr. Konne Zilliacus does not in terpret the war this way because of his extreme socialist back ground, he did not have any extreme socialist background, many people with backgrounds like his are conservative, he explains the war this way because he just chooses to think socialist thoughts. Around nine forty I move from her margin to the backs of some discarded drafts of Chapter Two to cope with "In trying to evaluate a commentary on a particular his torical situation what we must do rather is find the one that satisfies basic enigmas and at the same time provides a logical emphasis on one specific factor." Around ten forty I am saying cocoa will be fine sweetie just fine, and your opening "However" seems to contradict the sense of "the context of the trends of the times obviates the mitigation of individual respon sibility." The main clause is plain enough but are you sure you know what obviates means? Did you perhaps mean "with lives at stake men have to answer for their acts" or did you perhaps 117</page><page sequence="7">The Massachusetts Review mean "in such a baffling world men have to be forgiven their mistakes" and have you noticed that the first contradicts the paragraph before and the second contradicts the paragraph that comes next? Around eleven forty I have about finished her and me, both. The marginalium is still not good. It lacks art and psychology. It does not convey that old interpersonal relationship of being squarely on her side against her foolish mind. She will there fore cry. That is why it all has to be down in writing so she can read it over again dry. Oh goddam. Can this poor mind now add ten lines to chapter three? Indeed the content of the ubiquitous ideal of objectivity would seem to require drastic.. . . She's got me doing it. Poor little one, what chance has she against our truly hep library of social science when even I with my doctor of philosophy . . . try An explanation merely relates things in a way that satisfies my curiosity. My curiosity is fart of me; if you require that my explanations be objective it is not the explanations but the curiosity that you dragoon. The point may be illustrated by a simple example from pedagogy. It is as firm a principle of teaching as of democracy, that the need for common rules of thought must not be misconstrued as a need for uniform purposes of thought. So every teacher knows that he must discipline each students methods to the useful service of that students unique purpose and curiosity. . . . Mustn't he, Courtney? 118</page></plain_text>
