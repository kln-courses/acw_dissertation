<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> 266 Journal of English and Germanic Philology, April 2014 die saga von Þorsteinn bæjarmagn: saga af Þorsteini bæjarmagni—Übersetzung  und Kommentar. By Andrea Tietz. Münchner Nordistische Studien, 12. Mu- nich: Herbert Utz Verlag, 2012. Pp. 204. EUR 47. More fabulous than historical, the so-called fornaldarsögur (and þættir, for that mat- ter) have notoriously received less scholarly attention than have the Family Sagas.  The book under review is therefore especially welcome, for it contains a focused  commentary on a minor text within this “minor genre” (as a generic category, the  fornaldarsaga is a modern invention). The text in question is commonly known  as Þorsteins þáttr bœjarmagns (The Tale of Þorsteinn Farmhouse-Strength), and it  relates four supernatural adventures undertaken by the eponymous protagonist,  a daring marauder in the service of Óláfr Tryggvason. In the first, Þorsteinn fol- lows a boy into a chthonic realm, where he steals an armband and an ornate cloth  from an elven king. Next he encounters a mourning dwarf whose son had just  been abducted by an eagle. Þorsteinn shoots the eagle in flight and catches the  child out of the air. As a reward, the dwarf gives Þorsteinn a magic shirt, a magic  ring, a piece of flint that makes its holder invisible, and a remarkable magic stone.  The latter gift can be called upon to create hailstorms, sunshine, and showers of  flame. In the third and longest episode, Þorsteinn joins the otherworldly retinue  of Goðmundr of Glæsisvellir, who is riding to pay tribute to the treacherous Geir- roðr, king of the giants. With the help of the dwarf’s gifts, Þorsteinn foils each  of Geirroðr’s plans to undo Goðmundr and his men; ultimately, Þorsteinn kills  Geirroðr and incinerates his hall. In the final adventure, Þorsteinn rescues two  drinking horns from the burial mound of his father-in-law, the revenant Earl Agði.  Andrea Tietz’s Übersetzung und Kommentar consists of two introductory chapters, a  reproduction of the Old Norse–Icelandic story with a facing-page German transla- tion, twenty-five pages of “Anmerkungen zum Text der Saga,” a commentary on its  literary relations and principal themes, an essay on the role of Christianity in the  work, and a useful bibliography. The brief “Einleitung” (pp. 3–7) situates the text  within the fornaldarsaga tradition (its story is peculiar for being set during the reign  of Hákon Sigurðarson in Norway) and outlines the organization of the book. The  next chapter, “Saga af Þorsteini bæjarmagni” (pp. 7–31), presents a plot summary  of the saga; discusses its formal structure in terms of Bernard K. Martin’s semiotic  analysis of the text (“Structure and Meaning in Thorstein Mansion-Might’s Story,”  Parergon 8 [1990], pp. 69–80); surveys the broader manuscript tradition, which  consists of fifty-four witnesses, and describes five manuscripts in closer detail;  provides a list of earlier editions and translations; and recounts the few literary  influences that the tale has exerted on later Icelandic poetry.  The text and translation occupy the heart of the book (pp. 32–71). With few  emendations, each identified in a footnote, the Old Norse–Icelandic text is a  reproduction of the edition found in the third volume of Fornmanna sögur eptir  gömlum skinnbókum (1827), a book produced anonymously for Hið norræna forn- fræða félag. Tietz confirmed the accuracy of this edition by comparing it to the  manuscripts that had served as its basis, the chief of which being AM 510 4to.  The translation is trustworthy, fluent, and cautious. By way of example, here is the  source text and Tietz’s rendering of a passage concerned with one of the dwarf’s  magical gifts: Tók hann þá hallinn úr pungi sinum. Fylgði honum einn stálbroddr. Hallrin  var þríhyrndr. Hann var hvítr í miðju. En rauðr oðrumegin. En gul rond útan  um. Dvergrinn mælti: “Ef þú pjakkar broddinum á hallinn þar sem hann er  </page> <page sequence="2"> Book Reviews 267 hvítr, þá kemr haglhríð so mikil at engi þorir móti at sjá. En ef þú villt þýða  þann snjó, þá skaltu pjakka þar sem gulr er hallrinn. Ok kemr þá sólskin  svá at allt bræðir. En ef þú pjakkar þar í sem rautt er þá kemr þar úr eldr ok  eimyrja [ok] gneistaflaug svá at engi má móti at sjá.” . . . Daraufhin nahm er einen Stein und eine dazugehörige Stahlspitze aus sei- nem Beutel. Der Stein war dreieckig. Er war weiß in der Mitte, rot auf der  anderen Seite und ringsherum war ein gelber Rand. Der Zwerg sagte: “Wenn  du mit der Spitze dort auf den Stein stößt, wo er weiß ist, dann kommt ein so  heftiger Schneesturm auf, dass niemand wagt hindurchzublicken. Und wenn  du den Schnee schmelzen willst, dann musst du dort zustoßen, wo der Stein  gelb ist und dann kommt Sonnenschein, so dass alles schmilzt. Aber wenn  du dort hineinstichst, wo er rot ist, dann kommen dort Feuer und glühende  Asche und Funkenregen heraus, so dass niemand hindurchblicken kann.”  . . . (pp. 42–45) This is a straightforward translation, and less inventive than some others. Ac- cording to Jacqueline Simpson (The Northmen Talk, p. 184), the wondrous hallr  is a “pebble,” and according to Hermann Pálsson and Paul Edwards (Gautrek’s  Saga and Other Medieval Tales, p. 126; Seven Viking Romances, p. 261), it is “a bit of  marble,” but I see no reason to speculate about semantic opacities. Tietz’s simple  translation—“Stein”—is more honest.  Seldom of a textual-critical sort, the “Anmerkungen zum Text der Saga” (pp.  80–105) rather constitute a running commentary on those elements in the story,  “die einer näheren Betrachtung oder Erklärung bedürfen” (p. 6). For its part,  the Kommentarteil (pp. 106–80) is thematic and consists of two main sections,  “Intertexualität” and “Zu einigen Motiven zur Saga.” The utility and limitations  of Tietz’s notes and commentary can perhaps be conveyed by rehearsing her  discussion of two details:  (1) During their first major exchange, King Geirroðr asks Goðmundr to swear an  oath of loyalty (sverja mér eiða). Goðmundr responds that it is unlawful to request  such an oath from a man as young as himself. He proceeds, however, to make a  solemn vow (strengði þess heit) to serve no other king. Grateful for this, Geirroðr  claims that this vow seems even more valuable than a sworn oath of fealty. This  scene requires clarification, because there is no indication in the text that Goð- mundr is especially young and because the reader’s knowledge of the legal distinc- tion between oaths and vows is presumed. About this scene, Tietz remarks: “Die  Mündigkeit setzte—je nach Rechtsquelle—im Alter von 16, 18, oder 20 Jahren  ein. Von welcher dieser Alterstufen man auch ausgeht, muss Goðmundr tatsächlich  recht jung sein, wenn er aufgrund seines Alters noch nicht zum Leisten eines  gültigen Eides aufgefordert werden darf” (p. 93). She also refers to the article on  “Alter und Altersklassen” in the Reallexikon der Germanischen Altertumskunde. This  is slightly helpful, but I will have to turn elsewhere to satisfy my curiosity about  oaths and vows.  (2) Among King Geirroðr’s most cherished possessions is an anthropomorphic  drinking horn known as Grímr the Good, which is introduced as follows: “Lætr  konungr nú bera inn horn sitt hit mikla. Þat er kallat Grímr inn góði. Þat er  gersemi mikil. Ok þó galdrafullt ok búit með gull. Mannshofut er á stiklinum með  holdi ok munni ok þat mælir við menn ok segir fyrir óorðna hluti ok ef þat veit  ófriðar von.” In Tietz’s translation: “Der König lässt nun sein großes Trinkhorn  hereinbringen, es wird Grímr hinn góði—›Grímr der Gute‹—genannt. Es ist eine  </page> <page sequence="3"> 268 Journal of English and Germanic Philology, April 2014 große Kostbarkeit und noch dazu voll Zauberkraft und mit Gold verziert. Ein  menschliches Haupt aus Fleisch und Blut und mit einem Mund befindet sich an  der Spitze des Horns und es spricht zu den Menschen und sagt ungeschehene  Dinge voraus und ob Gefahr bevorsteht” (pp. 62–63). Needless to say, this ap- paratus is difficult to imagine (does ale issue through the mouth of the animated  head?). Tietz rightly devotes six pages of commentary to this strange vessel, “ein  Unikum” in Old Norse–Icelandic literature (p. 167). Although she admits that  the phenomenon of Grímr the Good cannot be traced with certainty to any given  source, she offers an informative overview of the theories that have been put forth.  The most attractive of these belongs to Jacqueline Simpson, who detected the  influence of the Mabinogi of Branwen, in which Bran’s severed head continues to  speak at feasts.  Andrea Tietz has translated and elucidated a text that warrants such attention,  and she has done so in a praiseworthy manner. It should be noted that her con- tribution originated as a Magisterarbeit under the direction of Wilhelm Heizmann  at the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität in Munich. Given the quality and utility of  the book under review, we have good reason to look forward to the fruits of her  doctoral research. Valentine A. Pakis University of St. Thomas Altwestnordische Farbsemantik. By Georg C. Brückmann. Münchner Nor- distische Studien, 11. Munich: Herbert Utz Verlag, 2012. Pp. 123. EUR 28. This recent volume in the Münchner Nordistische Studien series is a study of basic  color terms in Old Norse–Icelandic. In his Introduction, Georg C. Brückmann  specifies the aim of the study: “[D]er Versuch, das Farbempfinden der Isländer  und Norweger der Zeit nachzuvollziehen, [soll] in dieser Arbeit nicht unternom- men werden. Vielmehr soll eine Übersicht über die literarische Verwendung und  Funktion einzelner Farblexeme in der awn. Literatur gegeben werden. Hierzu  werden mit Hilfe der Etymologie und des literarischen Kontexts jeweils deskriptive  und affektiv-assoziative Bedeutungsanteile, d. h. Denotation und Konnotation,  herausgearbeitet” (p. 9). It is added that “[g]erade hinsichtlich der Konnotation  ist zu erwarten, daß diese in einem hohen Grad vom Kontext abhängig ist” (p. 9).  Brückmann bases his definition of basic color terms on the criteria of Brent Berlin  and Paul Kay in their landmark cross-cultural study Basic Color Terms (1969), that  is, that the color term is known to all members of a community, not contextually  restricted, not subsumed within another category, and generally named with a  mono-lexemic word. This, then, leaves Old Norse–Icelandic with eight basic color  terms: blár, brúnn, grár, grœnn, gulr, hvítr, rauðr, and svartr. The data for the usage  of these color terms are drawn from the slips of the Arnamagnaean Commission’s  Dictionary, which are now available online. Brückmann notes that in addition to the  occurrences noted by the Dictionary, he has found more than one hundred more,  which brings the number of occurrences of color terms to 956. Only prose texts  have been examined. A chart on page 12 shows that of these 956 occurrences,  hvítr (25%) is the most common basic color term; it is followed by rauðr (23%),  svartr (21%), blár (10%), grœnn (7%), grár (6%), brúnn (4%), and gulr (4%).  While these figures are interesting, it should be emphasized that the excerpting  of the Dictionary is selective, and that only a small selection of the oldest texts was  excerpted as if for a concordance.
