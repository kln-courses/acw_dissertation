<plain_text><page sequence="1">HEROISM, HERACLES, AND THE 'TRACHINIAE' By CHARLES FUQUA Sophocles' Trachiniae has provoked among the critics a broad variety of responses ranging from strong censure and denial of Sophoclean authorship at one extreme to expressions of approval and great praise at the other. In recent years the literature on the play has tended to approach the drama in a more sympathetic vein and critics have displayed a much more positive stance to both the contents and dramaturgy of the play. Although the debates about such questions as those of date, structure, purpose, theme, characterization, and unity continue, elements of the drama which earlier writers had tended to pass over, treat in an apologetic view, or even ascribe to the presence of textual flaws have been examined in a frank and open manner with positive results. The fact remains, however, that despite these advances there still persists a considerable reluctance to accept the figure of Heracles as he is presented in the drama. There can be no doubt that the characterization of Heracles is the fundamental reason why the Trachiniae has long been regarded as the great problem play of the Sophoclean corpus, and while for the most part we have moved from the blanket condemnation of this character that marked many earlier studies, the tendency to regard Heracles and consequently the Trachiniae as anomalies persists.1 1 Many of the standard objections are well epitomized and expressed by B. M. W. Knox in his remarks on the play in his Sather Lectures, The Heroic Temper (Berkeley and Los Angeles 1964) 2, 4, 8, 172; see also his ' Second Thoughts in Greek Tragedy,' GRBS 1 (1966) 213-32. A modification of these views can be seen in his review (AJP 92 [1971] 692-701) of G. Ronnet's Sophocle, po?te tragique (Paris 1969) which contains an exceptionally harsh appraisal of Heracles (94-95; infra, n. 175).

The primary function of this essay is to draw attention to certain characteristics of heroes, hero-cults, and the Greek attitude to Heracles in general in an attempt to shed light on the Trachiniae. The drama was not written in a vacuum; the culture for which Sophocles composed the play had a deep and abiding awareness of heroes and their cults, and many scholars, drawing upon the limited biographical evidence we possess about the playwright as well as the witness provided by the plays themselves, have noted his deep personal affinity to these cults.2 Never theless, while it is a commonplace of criticism that the traditional heroic myths formed the subjects of the dramas and a great deal of attention has been paid to the authors' sources and comparisons with prior and subsequent ver sions of these tales, comparatively little has been done to relate our understanding of these figures as heroes to their dramatic manifestations. We know a great deal about heroes, their cults, and the individual dramas as separate topics, but much more needs to be done to correlate these results with one another. This study is an attempt to move in that direction. It is divided into three parts. The first offers a series of short surveys of various issues surrounding our understanding of heroes, their cults, and the figure of Heracles followed by a brief analysis of the hero's appearances in Greek literature and selected works of art through the fifth century. The second section is devoted to an analysis of the dramatic action of the play, and in the third I draw some con clusions about the drama and propose some hypotheses about Sophocles' intent based on the results of the first two sections.

Sophocles' devotion to these cults has frequently been seen as a sign of his 'piety,' which all too frequently has been interpreted in a narrow and restrictive manner; see G. H.

Despite the fact that many areas of uncertainty remain, our understanding of heroes, their cults, and the relationship of these rituals to the general fabric of Greek religious practice has advanced considerably in the current century.3 Although, as Farnell cautioned, it is appropriate to distinguish among ancestor cults, hero-cults, and general religious 'tendance' to the dead, these distinctions were frequently not maintained by the Greeks themselves.4 The question, what is a hero, is one that no Greek of any period could have answered with much surety or precision. Hero worship occupied a broad and shifting spectrum of religious belief and practice, and heroes themselves were a very diverse group whom Nock aptly described as follows: . . . the category of heroes in general represents no more than an aggregate of individuals each having his own story, habitat, or function, and neither like the Olympians, constituting a divine society, nor, like the Christian saints, attaching themselves to it.5 In a similar manner Guthrie describes hero worship as 'the elevation of an cestors or other dead men to semi-divine status with all the apparatus of prayer and cult. '? Hero worship thus combined veneration for the dead with a belief in their continued power for both good and ill in human affairs after death. Since heroes were commonly believed to continue to dwell in their tombs and to exercise their influence from them, cult practices were usually centered at these sites. Generally speaking, the actual cult practices paralleled worship of chthon ian deities, and not infrequently there appears to have been a very unclear sense of the distinction between these cult figures and chthonian spirits.7 The most 3 The most important work in the field remains L. R. Farnell's Greek Hero Cults and Ideas of Immortality (Oxford 1921); see also A. Brelich, Gli eroi Greci (Rome 1958), M. Delcourt, L?gendes et cultes des h?ros en Gr?ce (Paris 1942), M. P. Foucart, Le culte des h?ros chez les Grecs (Paris 1918), A. D. Nock, 'The Cult of Heroes/ HTR 37 (1944) 141-74, and E. Rohde, trans. W. B. Hillis, Psyche0 (New York 1966) Pt. I, Chap. IV. The relationship of hero-cults to the broader fabric of Greek religion is sensitively considered in W. K. G. Guthrie's The Greeks and Their Gods (Boston 1950, 1956) and M. P. Nilsson's studies, The Minoan-Myce naean Religion and Its Survival in Greek Religion2 (Lund 1950), Cults, Myths, Oracles, and Politics in Ancient Greece (Lund 1951), A History of Greek Religion2, trans. F. J. Fielden (Oxford 1952), Geschichte der griechischen Religion3 (Munich 1957). 4 Farnell (n. 3) 2. 5 Nock (n. 3) 142-43. The tempting analogy between heroes and Christian saints should be employed with caution for, as Foucart (n. 3) 77-78 stated quite succinctly, the Greek did not consider heroes as intercessors for man to the divine but as powers in their own right. 6 Guthrie ( . 3) 220. 7 Cf. Farnell ( . 3) 239. Building on a parallel study by W. S. Ferguson, 'The Attic Or geones,' HTR 37 (1944) 61-140, Nock (n. 3) has shown this confusion about the status as well</page><page sequence="4">4 TRADITIO fundamental difference between these two sets of practices, as well as the dis tinction between veneration of heroes and Olympians, is that a hero was be lieved to have been a man originally and not a god or daimon. As Foucart succinctly observed, 'les Grecs n'ont jamais dout? que leurs H?ros avaient ?t? des hommes,'8 The Greeks' belief in the historicity of heroes and their con tinued interest in human affairs gave these cults a humane' quality that added greatly to their popular appeal. There has been considerable debate about the period of origins of these cults, and the available evidence suggests a vexing blend of elements that go back to the distant past and others that are comparatively late. The positions taken on this question parallel in no small part the author's convictions about the formative period of Greek mythology. In accordance with his convictions about the continuity of Greek religion and mythology from the Mycenaean era, Nilsson believed that many of the cults could be traced back to that period.9 In recent years, however, the conviction has grown that, while many of the figures who were venerated may have had Bronze Age prototypes, the actual cults did not emerge until the so-called Dark Ages.10 This hypothesis is sup as the origin of heroes carried over in the variety of practices associated with these cults, and not infrequently the form of heroic rites paralleled those of the Olympians as well as chthonic spirits. It is also significant that this confusion was true of new cults as well as older ones, and that a hero who was revered in a number of locales might well be honored in a broad variety of ways. On the basis of his trips to Tyre and Thasos Herodotus, for example, cites with approval the worship of Heracles as an Olympian and as a hero by various Greek states. The cults to Heracles on Thasos itself offer clear evidence to the variety of forms of worship accorded this figure; in addition to B. Berguist's recent study, Herakles on Thasos (Uppsala 1973), see G. Picard, 'Un rituel archa?que du culte de l'H?racl?s thasien trouv? ? Thasos,' BCH 47 (1923) 241-74 and H. Seyrig, 'Quatre cultes de Thasos,' BCH 51 (1927) 171-233. At Sicyon worship of Heracles combined elements from Olympian and chthonic worship into one 'service' (Paus. 2.10.1; cf. Farneil 354). 8 Foucart ( . 3) 67, cf. 2-3. Although Foucart's conviction that all heroes evolved from human figures constituted an oversimplification of the evidence and must be modified in light of such studies as those by Farnell, Nilsson, and Nock Cn. 3), the basic thrust and vigor of his argumentation offered a needed balance to the then current view exemplified by F. Deneken's article on heroes in Roscher's Lexikon that heroes were 'decayed' gods. Foucart's comments on how the cults represented a natural desire not to regard death as total anni hilation offer a sensitive appraisal of one of the basic reasons for the wide appeal of these cults. 9 In addition to the works cited before (n. 3) see also M. P. Nilsson's The Mycenaean Origin of Greek Mythology (Berkeley 1932). The continuity of mythological names with the Myce naean period which was first demonstrated on linguistic grounds (cf. Nilsson, 26 n. 21 and P. Kretschmer, 'Mythische Namen,' Gioita 10 [1920] 38-62) has received additional support since the decipherment of linear B. 10 Both V. R. d'A.

Vermeule, Chap IX, 'The Mycenaean Heritage,' Greece in the Bronze Age (Chicago 1964), deny direct</page><page sequence="5">* TRACHINIAE ' 5 ported by literary and archaeological evidence, and it now seems most probable that the hero cults themselves were a comparatively late phenomenon which in many instances commemorated much older practices and beliefs. This blend of old and new is reflected in the tendency of the Greeks to associate heroic cults with Mycenaean locales and tombs, which parallels the practice of the archaic Greeks to build temples on the sites of former Mycenaean pal aces.11 On the basis of the available evidence it seems most likely that a major impetus to the growth and development of these cults was similar to that behind epic poetry, a desire on the part of the Greeks to understand and explain the relics of a dimly remembered past.12 continuity in cult practices from the Mycenaean era through the archaic age. While Desbor ough and Vermeule believe that the formative period of the actual cults may have been relatively late, B. C. Dietrich, The Origins of Greek Religion (Berlin-New York 1974) 161, has proposed that the cults began as early as the concluding years of Mycenaean influence. Opinions on this point are closely related to the authors' opinions on the degree and type of continuity of religious expression over the entire period. For example, Nilsson's studies emphasized apparently constant characteristics while Vermeule sees in Mycenaean religious practices an openness and absence of superstition that is in marked contrast to cult practices of the archaic period. The issue is further clouded by the debates whether or not later de pictions of mythological and religious scenes represent a continuous tradition from the Myce naean era. On this last point see the discussions of L. Banti, 'Myth in Pre-Classical Art,' AJA 58 (1954) 307-10, V. Karageorghis, 'Myth and Epic in Mycenaean Vase Painting,' AJA 62 (1958) 383-87, and E. Vermeule, 'Mythology in Mycenaean Art,' CJ 54 (1958) 97-108. 11 One of the best known examples is the identification of a Mycenaean tomb on Delos as that of the Hyperborean Maidens, which after the purification of the islands by the Athenians in the fifth century became the site for a hero-cult; see Dietrich (n. 10) 160, Vermeule, Greece in the Bronze Age (n. 10) 287-88. G. E. Mylonas, Eleusis (Princeton 1961) 60-63, has an interesting discussion of the respect shown in the geometric period for Mycenaean burial sites at Eleusis and how these locales later became identified with hero-cults. 12 On the epics as vehicles for transmission of cultural ideals see E. A. Havelock, 'Prologue to Greek Literacy,' University of Cincinnati Classical Studies II (Norman 1973) 331-91; the thesis of this work was expanded in the author's Origin of Western Literacy, The Ontario Institute for Studies in Education, Monograph Series 14 (Toronto 1976). J. N. Goldstream, Geometric Greece (New York 1977), has shown how the Greeks in the second half of the eighth century became increasingly aware of a vanished heroic age, and parallels the growth of heroic cults with the rapid spread and development of oral poetry in the period (341-48; cf. Desbor ough [n. 10] 283). The nature of the interrelationships between oral poetry and hero-cults, however, remains a largely unexplored area, and questions about the continuity of the cults from the Mycenaean era (supra, n. 10) have their counterparts in the debates about the period when formulaic poetry developed. Some scholars (e.g., M. Nagler, Spontaneity and Tra dition [Berkeley 1974], D. L. Page, History and the Homeric Iliad [Berkeley 1959]) have ar gued that there is a direct continuity with the Mycenaean era if not earlier, while others (e.g., G. S. Kirk, Homer and the Oral Tradition [Cambridge 1976]) have asserted that the truly for mative period for oral poetry was subsequent to the decline of Mycenaean culture. Although there is no more consensus on these questions than on other forms of continuity and change</page><page sequence="6">6 TRADITIO For the purposes of this study, however, far more important than questions about the origin of these cults is the strong hold that this form of religious expression continued to maintain on the Greeks. The growth and development of these cults paralleled that of the system itself. The importance and number of these cults did not diminish but rather increased through the Clas sical period, and the great era of the Greek city states was also the period when these cults were most popular. Even the most cursory examination of the evidence reveals the enormous number and variety of these cults; not only were many different figures honored in this way, but also the cults themselves ranged from relatively crude to quite sophisticated practices.13 The importance of these cults to the overall fabric of Greek religion can be readily demonstrated by the steadily increasing significance of Delphi in the formal recognition and reg ularization of these cults.14 Heroization became more and not less frequent in the sixth and fifth centuries, and heroic status was accorded an increasingly diverse body of recipients. What may at first have been an honor to be extend ed to selected mythological heroes was by the end of the fifth century a prospect that might be accorded for a broad variety of human accomplishments.15 from the Mycenaean era to the archaic age, there can be little doubt that hero-cults and oral poetry represented parallel efforts to encapsulate cultural values. I believe this shared purpose is more significant than the commonly made distinction between the ' open, * ' humanistic ' attitude of Homer and the somewhat more apprehensive atmosphere suggested by the actual cult practices. As is the case with the familiar contrast between Homer and Hesiod, the essential difference is one of stance and attitude rather than content. I also concur with T. H. Price's position, 'Hero-Cult and Homer/ Historia23 (1973) 129-44, which expands upon R. K. Hack's thesis in 'Homer and the Cult of Heroes/ TAPA 60 (1929) 57-74, that Homer was aware not only of hero-cults but also that the cult practices themselves are reflected in the epics. 13 In this connection it is appropriate to note that one of the most important results of Nock's study (n. 3) was to point out that the date of foundation could not be used as an index of sophistication; some late cults were quite crude in terms of practices and beliefs, while a number of early cults display a striking elegance of ritual and conception. Although there is no certain way to classify heroes, the most reasonable approach appears to be a combination of Farnell's typology and Brelich's morphological approach to the classification of heroic behavior. 14 I do not share F. Poulsen's belief, Delphi, trans. G. C. Richards (London 1920) 30, that the oracle set out to revive hero-cults after they had been weakened 'under the influence of Ionian rationalism. ' The available evidence suggests that the role of Delphi, in fact, may have been the converse, to limit the proliferation of cults. 15 Brelich's, Farnell's, Foucart's, and Rohde's studies (n. 3) offer convenient discussion of the various types of heroes and types of activity that were considered appropriate for heroic status. Although the term 'hero ' later degenerated into little more than an honorary title that might be accorded for a broad variety of public and even private, domestic services, in the sixth and fifth centuries heroes and their cults were taken very seriously. One index is the frequent citations and reports of heroic assistance accorded the Greek forces in the Persian Wars.</page><page sequence="7">' TRACHINIAE ' 7 Hero-cults in classical Greece were not just survivors from a dim, less enlight ened past but a source of real concern to the states themselves. Each state had its own heroes and each state felt a real allegiance to these cults. Although the propaganda and political value of heroes was recognized early, the bond between state and cult was not just an expression of local pride or the rational istic desire to glorify conspicuous examples of human endeavor, but also en tailed a deep-seated conviction that the state's continued success rested in no small part on the continued good will of these figures. Success and failure of civic enterprises was often correlated with proper observance of the appro priate rites to local heroes and political control over the areas with which they were associated and especially the sites of their burials.16 One of the most important factors to bear in mind in attempting to understand Greek heroes and their cults is that the awe with which heroes were regarded was based on fear as well as respect. Heroes were not just positive figures commanding hu man respect and exerting their semi-divine powers for good effect but also harsh, severe presences who made peremptory and sometimes unpredictable demands for propitiation.17 The blend of admiration and apprehension with which heroes were regarded stemmed from a variety of reasons; part can be attributed to the indefinite status of heroes between men and gods and the way in which their rituals echoed the uneasy blend of chthonic and Olympian elements in the fabric of Greek religious practice, and part can be ascribed to what Guthrie has described as a fundamental ambiguity the Greeks entertained whether or not men should emulate the divine.18 Heroes and their cults reflected this tension in a much more explicit fashion than virtually any other aspect of Greek religion. Because 16 Clear examples of this concern can be seen in the Spartans' efforts to recover Orestes' bones (Her. 1.66-68) and Cimon's retrieval of Theseus' remains (Plut., Theseus 36.1; Cimon 8.3-6). The continued vitality of this theme is demonstrated by Sophocles' use of it in the Oedipus at Colonus where the question of the prospective location of Oedipus' remains is the basic datum about which the action of the drama revolves. 17 As Nilsson, History of Greek Religion (n. 3) 194, states quite succinctly: 'The hero-cult is more than any other apotropaeic; it is designed to appease the mighty dead, who are by no means slow to wrath. ' Although this point has been frequently made and illustrated in great detail by virtually every writer who has dealt with the subject, its applicability to heroes as dramatis personae has not been adequately recognized. Knox, Heroic Temper (n. 1) 55-58, is one of the few writers to emphasize the appropriateness of this material for understanding Sophocles. The harshness demonstrated by Sophoclean characters is quite in tune with the tenor of many cults and heroes. The harsh demeanor of these practices is in turn fre quently explained in terms of the close connection of early cults and figures with questions surrounding the expiation of blood guilt. 18 Guthrie ( . 3), Chap. III, Central Problem.'</page><page sequence="8">8 TRADITIO of their original humanity men could and did have a closer relationship with heroes than the more remote Olympian and chthonic powers. Heroes were thought to have been men, to have experienced the same earthly vicissitudes as their subsequent worshipers, and yet to have become something more. In so doing heroes entertained a very ambiguous existential status in which a recognition of their positive human accomplishments was coupled with con siderable apprehension about the qualities or powers they would have acquired by virtue of their semi-divine status. Greek heroes offered a very diverse body of paradigms, and Brelich's morphology of heroic behavior shows quite clearly how, while many of the traditional heroic tales deal with super-human beings in clearly fantastic circumstances, heroes and their cults were primarily con cerned with immediate realities in the world of men.19 But, at the same time that heroes were believed to have an interest in human affairs, the Greeks were always keenly conscious of their harsh and violent side as well. Many of the traditional tales dealt with very violent events in which the heroes' conduct cannot be reconciled with normal expectations of what is right and proper. Heroes were often seen as creatures of excess; their potential for excess, in fact, was often regarded as a significant factor behind their ultimate heroization. Brelich's study has made it quite clear that heroes regularly possess abnormal appetites, qualities, and characteristics which ally them to the sub- or super human forces against which they were often seen to contend.20 Heroes, thus, were beings to whom a duality of response was both possible and appropriate. All the tensions that can be observed in the study of Greek heroes in general can be exemplified in the figure of Heracles, who was by far the best known and most widely revered Greek hero. Brelich's description of Heracles as 'questo "vero ideale" dell'uomo greco' constitutes but a slight exaggeration of Heracles' significance in Greek culture.21 His exploits covered the entire range of heroic 19 Brelich ( . 3) categorizes the major concerns of heroes as death, combat, contests, man tic powers, healing, the mysteries, transition to adulthood, blood groups, the state, and ' attivit? umane' in even more general terms. Although reviewers (e.g., H. J. Rose, Gnomon 31 [1959] 385-89) have objected to some of these categories ? and especially the connection of heroic behavior with rites signifying a transition to adulthood ? Brelich's morphological approach conveys an excellent sense of the range and variety of heroic activity. Of particular interest for this study are Brelich's comments (191-97) on Heracles as epitomization of what heroism meant to the Greeks in accordance with the categories of activities he established. 20 Brelich ( . 3) 233-48, deals with this aspect of heroism in a very direct and positive manner, and I concur with his conclusion that the harshness of these figures must be accepted on its own terms and not explained away. 21 Brelich ( . 3) 230; Brelich ( . 8) quotes the following useful parallel from O. Kern's Die Religion der Griechen I (Berlin 1926) 126: 'Es gibt nichts Gleiches in der griechischen Religion. ... In Herakles ist das hellenische Mannesideal verk?rpert und dies Mannesideal geh?rt in dem Himmel ? auf der Erde leben keine Ideale ? und hat nur in der G?ttin der ewigen Jugend seine w?rdige Partnerin.'</page><page sequence="9">' TRACHINI AE ' 9 experience, and he was, as Guthrie notes, the 'hero of heroes in whom the general characteristics of the class appear to an exceptional degree. '22 Not only was he a man who through his own exertions achieved heroic status; he also was believed from an early date to have been subsumed among the Olym pians.23 As Fontenrose observes, Heracles Occupies every point in the religio-mythical spectrum from mortal hero through demigod and chthonian deity to Olympian god.'24 Although there are serious lacunae in the literary texts, there is an abundance, if not surfeit, of information from other sources;25 in fact, the basic problem in attempting to form an assessment of Heracles resides not in an absence of data but in classifying, correlating, and interpreting the vast bulk of evidence that we do possess.26 The probem is further com 22 Guthrie ( . 3) 238; Guthrie's pages on Heracles (235-41) offer a very convenient survey of the major dimensions of this figure. 23 Although, as we shall see in the review of the literary evidence, there is some ambiguity about Heracles' status in Homer, the author of the Nekyia at least assumes that Heracles has gained some form of divine status which Pindar was later to epitomize by the expression e (Nem. 3.22) and Herodotus (2.44) was to explain by postulating a double Heracles combining an Egyptian god and mortal son of Alcmene. Although it was interpreted in a variety of ways, Heracles' acquisition of divinity was generally not questioned; in this respect he was unique among the Greek heroes. An interesting parallel to Heracles in this regard is Asclepius, who in some periods and locales is accorded Olympian status and privileges and in other times and places is considered only an important hero; see Guthrie's brief comments (n. 3) 242-53, and Farnell's excellent chapter (n. 3) 234-79. Comparisons between the two heroes are very instructive because the ambiguity about Asclepius' status and the deliber ate attempts to elevate him to Olympian rank point out the 'stability' of Heracles' position in this regard. 24 J. Fontenrose, Python (Berkeley 1959) 321. Although Fontenrose does not attempt an exhaustive analysis, the numerous parallels he offers between both Heracles and other figures who bring order and the hero's adventures and other mythical narratives provides a valuable supplement to the approaches of Brelich and Farnell (n. 3) and especially the former's morphological approaches (supra, n. 19). 25 Perhaps the most serious losses are those of Plutarch's Life of Heracles, which would have offered a convenient compendium against and with which earlier traditions might be assessed, and of the four poems Stesichorus devoted to Heracles' adventures. These were the Geryoneis, Cycnus, Cerberus, and Scylla, and although they mainly dealt with the hero's adventures in the West, their loss is a serious one for our understanding of Heracles. The fragments not only of these poems but also his other works that survive demonstrate how Stesichorus drew upon and combined various sources with great inventive skill to produce mythological narratives on an extended scale which profoundly influenced contemporary as well as subsequent art and literature. The fragment from the Geryoneis (PMG 8) that describes Heracles' arrival in Erytheia in the cup of the sun provides an excellent example of Stesi chorus' narrative technique and raises intriguing questions as to how the poet construed various traditions to which he fell heir. For a very balanced appraisal of Stesichorus see C. M. Bowra, Greek Lyric Poetry2 (Oxford 1961) Chap. III. 26 In assessing the literary tradition I am greatly indebted to G. K. Galinsky's The Herakles Theme (Oxford 1972). F. Brommer's Herakles: Die zw?lf Taten des Helden in antiker Kunst</page><page sequence="10">10 TRADITIO plicated by the fact that not only did the figure of Heracles develop in its own right but it also served as a locus about which there were numerous accretions in every period. He was, in short, one of the most flexible figures in Greek mythology, and the Greeks were never hesitant about employing his paradigm in a broad variety of ways. Heracles was a figure of great antiquity, and there can be little doubt that significant elements of his character go back to the Mycenaean era. There is also a general consensus that as early as that period Heracles was a composite figure drawing on a variety of traditions and sources. Scholars who have attempted to analyze the basic or original significance of this figure have come to a variety of conclusions. Heracles has been interpreted on a spectrum which ranges from Mycenaean (Foucart) or Dorian culture hero (Wilamowitz) on the one hand to vegetation or solar deity (Harrison, Paley) on the other.27 Between these two sets of extremes virtually every position and combination thereof has been maintained to be at the heart of his nature. In recent years, for und Literatur (M?nster-Cologne 1953), Denkm?lerlisten zur griechischen Heldensage I: Herakles (Marburg 1971), and Vasenlisten zur griechischen Heldensage3 (Marburg 1973) are essential guides to the representations of Heracles in Greek art. The volume of this material is amaz ing: the third edition of the Vasenlisten gives 8,000 entries for Heracles which is approxi mately the total of the entries for all the heroes in the first edition, and in terms of raw bulk the first volume of Denkm?lerlisten approaches that of the two subsequent volumes dealing with the other heroes. The objections that various reviewers have raised with respect to the format and categories Brommer employs in both the Denkm?ler listen and Vasenlisten are more than outweighed by the utility of the lists themselves. The volume of material is such that no single form of classification will ever prove adequate. I believe that the full significance of the material will not become apparent until it is somehow encoded and adapted to computer analysis, and, although this approach will not provide a universal panacea, it would make possible much more expeditious inquiries into multi-dimensional questions? such as the popularity of certain characters and themes in various periods?than present methods allow. 27 Foucart (n. 3) 20, believed Heracles to have been based on an actual Mycenaean chieftain. The introduction to Wilamowitz's Euripides Herakles2 (Berlin 1895) provides an excellent example of the common view of Heracles as a Dorian folk hero. J. E. Harrison's discussion of Heracles as a year or solar figure, Themis (Cambridge 1912) 364-76 (cf. her Prolegomena to the Study of Greek Religion2 [Cambridge 1908] 346-49), offers an excellent example of the anthropological approach to which Foucart objected so strongly in his study. F. A. Paley, Sophocles, Vol. II (London 1880) 203-4, believed that it had been conclusively demonstrated that Heracles and his labors were a solar myth and described various aspects of the Trachiniae from that perspective. He was followed by L. Campbell, Sophocles, II (Oxford 1881) 240, who stressed, however, that this material was of little assistance for interpretation of the drama. On Heracles' solar qualities see also G. R. Levy, 'The Oriental Origin of Herakles,' JHS 54 (1934) 40-53,45-48. Farnell's chapter, Origin and Diffusion of the Cult of Herakles' ( . 3) 95-154, contains a very balanced appraisal of these issues.</page><page sequence="11">'trachiniae' 11 example, Fontenrose has paralleled him to various divine figures who bring order and believes that the number of times in which Heracles is cast as a conqueror of death is especially significant for understanding the nature of his character 28 In a somewhat less specific vein, Kirk, who notes that 'finding an under lying harmony in Heracles is something the ancients did not succeed in doing, and perhaps were not much interested in, ' believes that at the nucleus of this figure may be found a general antinomy between Nature and Culture.29 Debates about the locale of his origins have been no less varied. A high pro portion of the labors which later were to form the basis of the canonic e ae are firmly located in the Peloponnesus and in this connection there is the very early and well established tradition of Heracles as a Tirynthian.30 28 The basic thrust of Fontenrose's chapter on Heracles (n. 24) is to establish this point as well as to parallel Heracles with Apollo and Zeus as an important 'dragon fighter in the myth-making of the Greeks' (358). The evidence he adduces is quite supportive of this view of the hero's curative activities on behalf of others as well as himself. In this respect Fonten rose's work parallels Farnell's remarks on Heracles as a 'protector' or 'warder off (n. 3) 149-50, Brelich's emphasis on the 'medical' aspects of heroic behavior (n. 3) 113-17, and Delcourt's description of Heracles as a searcher for immortality and combater of death (n. 3) 135-36. 29 G. S. Kirk, The Nature of Greek Myths (Woodstock 1975) 203. Kirk sees the contrast between Nature and Culture in the tension between Heracles' civilizing acts on the one hand and his bestial or unrestrained on the other. In describing this antinomy in Heracles which he believes goes back to the formative stages of Greek mythology, Kirk draws upon a similar tension he sees reflected in both the conduct of and the Greek attitude toward Centaurs and Cyclops and the sophistic balance of and (206-9 cf. 85-86). In so doing Kirk continues the structuralist approach of his earlier Sather Lectures, Myth, Its Meaning and Functions in Ancient and Other Cultures (Berkeley-Cambridge 1970), but his chapter on Hera cles displays a somewhat more positive stance toward the hero, whom he described as 'for the most part an uninteresting performer' in his earlier work (187). Although I believe the structuralist approach is limited, it does provide a conceptual framework that is broad enough to accommodate Heracles' diversity. There can also be little doubt that the general tension between Nature and Culture emphasized by the structuralists was keenly felt by the Greeks themselves; see C. Segal, 'The Raw and the Cooked in Greek Literature: Structure, Values, Metaphor,' CW 69 (1974) 289-308. 30 It is interesting to note that, while the sites of a number of Heracles' labors remained static, the location of others moved as Greek knowledge of the world about them expanded; for example, the Geryon story, which at an early date becomes associated with the Greek far west, may originally have been located much closer to if not in mainland Greece, and in a similar fashion Heracles' bondage to Omphale appears to have been transferred to Lydia from Greece (cf. Farnell [n. 3] 140-41, Kirk, Nature . . . [n. 29] 197-98). Heracles' early connections with Tiryns are well attested, and as has often been noted his bondage to Eurystheus of Argos may reflect the political realities of the Mycenaean world (on this last topic see D. L. Page's chapter, 'The Homeric Description of Mycenaean Greece,' in his Sather Lectures [n. 12] 118-77). Arguments from this last perspective must, however, be used with caution since, as M. I. Finley's 'Homer and Mycenae: Property and Tenure,' Historia 6 (1957) 133-59, illustrates quite clearly, certain basic governmental and institutional practices of the Mycenaean era</page><page sequence="12">12 TRADITIO The tradition of his Theban heritage was also of considerable antiquity and the varied results of modern scholars in their attempts to define his nature have their counterparts in antiquity in the different attempts of ancient geneal ogists to reconcile Heracles' Theban and Peloponnesian ancestries.31 It is important to recognize, however, that Heracles soon transcended par ticular civic, local, and regional boundaries to become a truly Pan-Hellenic figure at an early date.32 Heracles was popular in the fullest sense of the term; not only was knowledge of his adventures familiar throughout the Greek world, but also he was a very accessible figure for the common man. Folk tale motifs are very frequent in his exploits, and there can be little doubt that Heracles' appeal was clearly based on the fact that he embodied very human charac teristics and desires to a conspicuous degree. It has, in fact, been frequently suggested that a major reason behind Heracles' widespread popularity stems from the fact that his attitude and acts have much more in common with the aspirations and desires of the ordinary man than those of the aristocratic few.33 Although Heracles was employed by the Greeks in a variety of ways, were either misunderstood or simply not known in subsequent eras. On P. Friedl?nder's attempt to explain Heracles on almost exclusively Tirynthian terms in his Herakles, Philolo gische Untersuchungen 19 (Berlin 1907), see Farnell's comments and discussion (n. 3) 103-6. One of the most important points that emerges from the latter's remarks is that the popularity of Heracles in the Peloponnesus antedates the arrival of the Dorians in the area. Farnell (113-35) also demonstrated that, while Heracles and the supposed connection of his stock to the Dorians was frequently invoked (and often quite blatantly for political purposes), Heracles was rarely, if ever, subject to enthusiastic devotion by the Dorian peoples. 31 Heracles' 'northern connections' are examined in considerable detail by Wilamowitz [n. 27], and his importance in Boeotia has frequently been explained by postulating that the mythical Heracles was originally a 'decayed' or 'faded' god of the region. As H. W. Parke and D. E. W. Wormell (The Delphic Oracle, 2 Vols. [Oxford 1956], I, 340-43) have shown, support for this contention is provided by a number of local myths and cult practices of the area. The story of Heracles' and Apollo's contest for the Delphic tripod supplements this position in a significant manner (see also Farnell [n. 3] 135-37). Nevertheless, as both Farnell, 103-5, and Delcourt (n. 3) 119-20, make quite clear, Heracles cannot be completely 'ex plained' in these terms any more than in light of the diverse Peloponnesian traditions. What does become clear is that the mythical Heracles drew upon a number of different sources and was an extremely 'composite' figure from a very early date; see Nilsson's excellent dis cussion of these issues, Mycenaean Origin of Greek Mythology (n. 9) Chap. III. I do not, however, think it is either feasible or appropriate to follow G. R. Levy's path (n. 27) and trace Heracles back to a Near Eastern vegetation deity. 32 This can be demonstrated by his appearances in works of art, the mythical narratives about his adventures in all parts of the Greek world, and the growth and popularity of his cults. Another factor which aided in the dispersion of his popularity was that, unlike most other heroes, he was not associated with a particular burial place. 33 Guthrie ( . 3) 239-41, offers an excellent pr?cis for the rationale behind Heracles' pop ular appeal. Heracles epitomized human confidence and accomplishment in very accessible terms and, as Wilamowitz, Der Glaube der Hellenen (Berlin 1932) II, 24-26, observed with</page><page sequence="13">' TRAGHIN IAE ' 13 some of which indicate a very sophisticated and specialized use of this paradigm, the Greeks never lost sight of his commonality and from first to last Heracles remained a figure of ready accessibility. Heracles' appearances in Greek literature are both numerous and varied. The following survey is intended to show the major permutations the hero un derwent so that the nature of Sophocles' portrait can be more closely defined.34 In Homer, perhaps because of the aristocratic bias of the epics as a whole, we find a somewhat ambiguous stance to this character. On the one hand certain references and parallels suggest that his acts are regarded as being beyond the pale, while others imply the poet's profound recognition of Heracles' importance as a paradigm of heroic life. In the first category can be placed Dion's de scription of Heracles' assaults on Hera and Hades in her consolation of the wounded Aphrodite in Iliad 5.382-415.35 Here Diomedes' violence is directly paralleled to Heracles, and the latter's attitude is delineated in very negative terms (IL 5.403-4): , ? e , oder' a a , e e e , ol " e a . The description of Iphitus' death at the start of Odyssey 21 reflects this stance in even stronger terms. The book begins with Penelope retrieving Odysseus' great bow for the contest with the suitors. The bow was a guest-gift from Iphitus, and, after a brief account of Odysseus' and Iphitus' meeting in Messene, there follows a brief but pointed narrative of the latter's death. In this passage (Od. 21.25-30) the poet not only implies a sharp attack of Heracles' rapacity but also, and more significantly in light of the motif's importance in the epic, depicts it as a violation of e a, guest-friendship.36 Despite the negative particular eloquence, Heracles was not bound by the sense of social restraint and propriety, a , that so marks and limits the actions and responses of the aristocratic heroes of the epics. 34 As noted (supra, n. 26), in assessing the literary tradition I am deeply indebted to Ga linsky's The Herakles Theme. I do not, however, agree with his belief that 'Homer found Heracles basically unsuitable for his aims' (9), a contention he supports by maintaining that Heracles does not demonstrate proper or a (cf. Wilamowitz [ . 33] 26). To con strue Heracles in this manner is, in my opinion, too restrictive. Another useful survey of the evidence on Heracles from early Greek literature is provided by G. L. Huxley's Greek Epic Poetry (London 1969), Chap. VIII. 35 The provocative phrase e e e e (It. 5.397) has occasioned considerable discussion; I concur with the sentiments voiced by Nilsson, Mycenaean Origins of Greek Mythology (n. 9) 202-4, and Fontenrose (n. 24) 327-30, that it is a strong indication that the Homeric account masks a much older tale of Heracles in direct combat with death. 36 The importance of this motif to the epic as a whole has long been recognized and is brilliantly discussed in such studies as M. I. Finley's The World of Odysseus (London 1954), but, while it is clear that the epic poet regards Heracles' conduct as a breach of this convention of behavior, he simultaneously acknowledges Heracles' heroic ability to perform (cf. Od. 21.25</page><page sequence="14">14 TRADITIO tone of these references Homer also does not hesitate to employ Heracles as an important paradigm of the heroic life. When Odysseus is goaded by the Phaea cians, he states that only Philoctetes excelled him before Troy and hesitates to compare his ability with earlier men such as Eurytus and Heracles (Od. 8.223-29).37 Even more significant is the fact that Homer employs Heracles as the ultimate prototype for both Achilles' and Odysseus' own endeavors. In the moving encounter with Thetis in Iliad 18 where Achilles poignantly accepts his own mortality, he does so by means of a comparison of his lot with that of Heracles (II. 18.115-26). As Galinsky observes, 'Heracles is the noblest mythological precedent that Achilles can turn to in his awareness of the ines capability of death.'38 An even more striking example of Homer's use of Heracles as the ultimate heroic prototype is provided by the Nekyia, where Heracles is the final shade to address Odysseus. Heracles appears wearing a 30). The need for Homeric heroes to perform, the Greek emphasis on performance as a basis for 'value' judgments, and the continuing influence of this attitude on Greek ethics form the subject of A. W. H. Adkins' Merit and Responsibility (Oxford 1960). His remarks on Homer in that work (Chap. Ill) are significantly supplemented in his '"Honour" and "Punishment" in the Homeric Poems,' ICS 7 (1960) 23-32. Adkins' stress on performance has been ques tioned in a very suggestive manner by A. A. Long, 'Morals and Values in Homer,' JHS 90 (1970) 121-39. Long emphasizes the sense of propriety that is felt by heroes and society and sees in it an important restraint on behavior. Although, as Adkins' reply makes clear, 'Ho meric Values and Homeric Society,' JHS 91 (1971) 1-14, the debate is far from resolved, I believe that in assessing such a passage as the opening of Od. 21 both sets of demands, per formance and propriety ? here in the form of e a ? must be taken into consideration. The precise nature of their interrelationship is often unclear, and there are considerable deviations in emphasis in the balance of these factors with one another throughout the epics. Consequently I cannot share Galinsky's view that the Odyssey passage is 'one of the most devastating indictments of Heracles in literature, exceeded only by Sophocles and the shrill bias of the church fathers' (n. 26, 12). It is instead a passage which not only reflects a very old view of Heracles (supra, n. 35) but also one which draws our attention to the ironies and harshness of heroic behavior in much more pointed fashion than the Homeric Hymn to Hera cles (15). In this very short work we can observe both an early juxtaposition of Heracles' Theban and Peloponnesian roots as well as the paradoxical line 'he did many wicked things (a a a a) and endured many' (6), to describe the rationale behind his entry into Olympus. 37 Galinsky (n. 26) 11, believes that, since Odysseus is referring to heroes who contend with gods (cf. Od. 8.255), the reference to Heracles is 'ambiguous.' The phrasing of the pas sage as a whole, however, suggests that the poet is making a distinction between Heracles and Eurytus as well as describing their prowess and, although the latter's death is attributed to his direct attempts to rival Apollo, there is nothing to imply that the same charge is ap plicable to Heracles. 38 Galinsky (n. 26) 14. In accordance with his view that Heracles and his conduct are anomalies in the world of the epics (supra, n. 34), Galinsky believes this is 'entirely appro priate' since Achilles has set himself apart from the commonly accepted code of behavior. This position may be too limiting; I believe that the passage should be taken at face value and Achilles should be understood as simply making the strongest case he can by appealing to the greatest example of heroic conduct.</page><page sequence="15">'TRAGHINIAE ' 15 baldric adorned with vignettes epitomizing many of his own exploits and com pares Odysseus' toils with his own in quite explicit terms (Od. 11.617-26), and there are few passages in Greek literature which illustrate the loneliness and isolation of heroic accomplishment more poignantly.39 The limited evidence that survives from the cyclic epics and lyric poetry shows that the ambiguous stance reflected in Homer continued.40 As time progressed, however, Greek attitudes to Heracles underwent a progressive modification and shift in emphasis. Galinsky describes this tranformation in terms of a process of ' internalization, ' by which he means an increased stress on the private, internal qualities of Heracles which enabled him to endure the various tasks with which he was confronted.41 This is borne out by the abundant references to Heracles in Pindar and Baechylides which do reveal a much deeper sense of the hero's internal moral qualities and dimensions than Homer and the fragments of early Greek lyric poetry. Both poets employed Heracles to good effect. And while Baechylides may well have been especially fascinated with 39 See Galinsky's excellent comments (n. 26) 12-14. The emphasis on toil and endurance as the essential characteristic of both heroes' lives is conveyed by the iconography of Hera cles' baldric as well as the content of his speech. On the importance of this theme for the epic as a whole see G. E. Dimock's well-known essay, The Name of Odysseus, ' which first appeared in the Hudson Review 9.1 (1956) 52-70. On the complex question whether or not the passage reveals Homer's knowledge if not acceptance of hero-cults and Heracles' heroic status see Hack and Price (n. 12). In his recent study, 'Heracles,' CW 71 (1978) 431-40, F. G. Philips comments on the questions surrounding Heracles' origins and his appearances in Homer and Hesiod and suggests that possibly Homer introduced the notion of Heracles' assumption of divine or Olympian status. 40 There is little that can be added to Galinsky's (n. 26) and Huxley's (n. 34) discussions of the references to Heracles in the Hesiodic corpus or such works as Peisandrus' Heracleia or Greophylus of Samos' Sack of Oechalia. The evidence that survives demonstrates beyond doubt the widespread familiarity of the Greeks with Heracles' career from an early date and the 'incidental' references to Heracles in the Theogony underscore his paradigmatic qualities (cf. Galinsky, 16, and M. L. West's commentary, Hesiod: Theogony [Oxford 1966]). The Hesiodic Shield of Heracles parallels and contrasts with the description of his baldric in the Nekyia and Achilles' shield in IL 18 in a number of significant ways. The Hesiodic Shield does not convey the 'generic' emphasis on toil as an essential component of heroic life that characterizes the former, and lacks both the paradigmatic quality and sense of mint construc tion conveyed by Achilles' shield. To what extent these characteristics of the Shield are an indication of the poet's private talents or even, possibly, his desires to reflect the political tensions and allegiances at the time of the First Sacred War (cf. Huxley, 110-11) is uncertain, but about his desire to present Heracles in full 'Homeric' splendor in a narrative situation that may originally have been much cruder (cf. Fontenrose [n. 24] Chap. II) there can be no doubt. The references to Heracles in the fragments of lyric poetry demonstrate an intensification of elements already visible in Homer rather than striking novelties (this, however, was probably not the case with Stesichorus' four lost works; supra, n. 25); they do indicate, however, that by the end of the archaic era there was no better known or more widely accepted heroic paradigm than Heracles. 41 See Galinsky (n. 26) Chap. II, 'Herakles in Transition: Pindar and Bacchylides. '</page><page sequence="16">16 TRADITIO the potential for colorful, if not witty, narrative afforded by Heracles' exploits, he nevertheless did not hesitate to employ him as a cultural paradigm in a pointed fashion.42 The most abundant and direct evidence for the added moral dimensions Heracles took on in this period comes from the frequent references to him throughout Pindar. The poet's description of him as e (Nem. 3.22) epitomizes his view of Heracles as an avatar of cultural ideals. Although he was well aware of their currency, Pindar worked with great energy to dissociate Heracles from the cruder aspects of his traditional career. In Olympian 9.30-39, for example, he indignantly rejects as blasphemy an account of Heracles' combat with Poseidon, Apollo, and Hades. For Pindar, the tra ditional heroes, and especially Heracles, served as epitomes of the cultural values which the victors themselves came to embody by virtue of their own success. In this process the cruder folk-tale elements of Heracles' career were subtly transformed to serve as expressions of these cultural ideals. Heracles' might, for example, was shown not so much in service of its own ends, as in Homer, but rather as a means of justice and for defense of the social order.43 The culmination of this movement came in Sophocles' own lifetime with Prodicus' account of Heracles' choice (cf. Xen. Mem. 2.1 21-33). Here we see not only a stress on Heracles' internal qualities and potential to act pro bono 42 See Galinsky ( . 26) 25-40. The most complete evidence for Bacchylides' attitude to Heracles is provided by Epinician 5; I concur with M. R. Lefkowitz's view of Heracles as a traditional hero in that work, 'Bacchylides Ode 5: Imitation and Originality/ HSCP 73 (1969) 45-96. On Bacchylides' style see G. M. Kirkwood, 'The Narrative Art of Bacchylides, ' The Classical Tradition, ed. L. J. Wallach (Ithaca 1966) 98-114. 43 This element is stressed by Galinsky throughout his discussion of Pindar (n. 26) 29-38, but, while Pindar did stress the 'positive* aspects of Heracles' use of force, we must also re member that the context within which he did so was considerably limited by his own aris tocratic perspective. This blend of old and new is quite evident throughout his corpus and sometimes provokes somewhat startling juxtapositions of concepts, as in the famous fragment (169) which begins 'law is the king of all* and then continues by illustrating this maxim by an apparent act of brigandage on Heracles' part. In addition to Galinsky's comments (33-35) see M. Ostwald, 'Pindar, Nomos, and Heracles,' HSCP 69 (1965) 109-38, and G. Pavese, 'The New Heracles Poem of Pindar,' HSCP 72 (1967) 47-88. The significance of Ostwald's remarks on Pindar becomes more apparent when considered in light of his Nomos and the Begin nings of the Athenian Democracy (Oxford 1969); see also J. De Romilly, La loi dans la pens?e grecque (Paris 1971). Pindar's reactionary tendencies in this age of dynamic political and social change have often been noted and are summarized well by CM. Bowra in his chapter, 'Echoes of Politics,' Pindar (Oxford 1964), and D. Kagan's 'The Aristocratic Response: Theognis and Pindar,' The Great Dialogue (New York 1965). A somewhat more 'democratic' stance to Heracles may have been taken by Aeschylus in his Prometheia trilogy and, although the reconstruction of Heracles' role is largely hypothetical, there can be little doubt that Heracles was presented in a positive manner and possibly as a more advanced cutural hero than Prometheus; see Galinsky 42-46 and F. Solmsen, Hesiod and Aeschylus (Ithaca 1949) Pt. II, Chap. II.</page><page sequence="17">'trachiniae' 17 publico but also the element of moral choice. This last element has, in fact, become the most important; Heracles is not seen as a doer of great deeds but as an Everyman who must make a conscious, intellectual decision to undertake a life of toil and hardship if he is to realize his potential.44 Against these traditions, with their ever-increasing stress upon the hero's intellectual and internal qualities, must be balanced the use of Heracles as a simple figure of colossal appetites found in comedy and the fragmentary re mains of satyric drama. Here elements derived from popular tradition and conceptions of Heracles as folk-tale hero found their fullest expression. The evidence makes it quite clear that Heracles was most frequently presented as a good-natured, simple-minded buffoon of gross and common tastes with whom the audience could both identify and project their own desires. His heroism expressed itself not in embodying cultural ideals, moral choices, lofty moral sentiments, or accomplishments for the commonweal, but in displaying an in satiable desire for food, drink, and sex in often highly ludicrous situations.45 Heracles offered a vehicle for comic expression of heroic proportions, and the dramatists did not hesitate to use his potential in this regard. The broad use of Heracles in these dramas, however, did not preclude his being employed as a vehicle of expression for significant and often quite profound ideas. His ap pearance in Aristophanes' Birds, for example, is not only hilarious in its own right but also offers an elegant example of the dramatist's delight in exploiting the ludicrous extremes of Greek mythology and their anthropomorphic con ception of the divine. So also with increasing frequency in recent years critics have noted that the brief appearance Heracles makes in the Frogs together with the subsequent explicit and implicit comparisons of his behavior with Dionysus serve an important and not altogether humorous purpose in the context of the 44 See Galinsky (supra, n. 26) 101-3. The depth of the hero's intellectual dimension should not be overestimated; the situation with which he is presented by Prodicus is readily comprehensible, and Heracles' selection does not depend on broad theoretical considerations. What is 'new' is the sense of awareness the hero displays to the issues. This combination of awareness and service pro bono publico became a hallmark of representations of Heracles in the fourth century and can be seen most clearly in Isocrates' use of Heracles as a paradigm for Philip of Maced?n (cf. Or. 5 and Galinsky's comments 103-7). On the transition of Hera cles from a physical to intellectual or moral hero see also S. Woodford, *Exemplum Vir tutis: A Study of Heracles in Athens in the Second Half of the Fifth Century' (diss., Colum bia University 1967). Woodford describes Prodicus' Choice as a turning point for the intel lectual appreciation of the figure of Heracles (129, cf. 262-64). Woodford's study offers a valuable supplement to Galinsky, and her discussion of the archaeological evidence is very important for understanding Heracles' position and role in fifth-century Athens. 45 See Galinsky's survey (n. 26), Chap. IV, 'The Comic Hero'; his remarks on the manner in which the Greeks 'reconciled' the comic and serious Heracles are very appropriate (96-98).</page><page sequence="18">18 TRADITIO play as a whole.46 The range and variety of Heracles' appearances on the comic stage suggests from yet another perspective both the hero's flexibility as a paradigm and the broad hold he exerted on the Greek imagination. Any attempt to understand Heracles' significance as a cultural paradigm must consider the witness provided by Greek art. Heracles and his exploits were exceptionally popular subjects in Greek vase painting, and, although a com plete and systematic analysis of the evidence has yet to be done (supra, n. 26), the general pattern of the manner in which Heracles was conceived and rep resented is relatively clear. The abundant evidence that survives both bears witness to every element recorded in the literary evidence in profuse detail and suggests the currency of many other traditions and tales as well. The rep resentations of Heracles in Greek art and literature moved in approximately parallel tracks. In fact, the representations of Heracles in Greek art may well have shaped his portrayal in literature, for, as Brommer has demonstrated, artistic representations of the e ae frequently anticipate, and often by a considerable margin, their first appearance in literature.47 Although the evidence is irregular in terms of date and distribution, there appears to be a gradual but distinct movement from simple presentations of folk-tale motifs to themes that bring out the hero's Pan-Hellenic qualities and the internal di mensions of his experience. This shift is reflected not only in choice of subject matter but in their treatment as well. In early representations the most com mon subjects are such folk-tale themes as Heracles' combat with the Centaurs or his conquest of the Nemean lion. In the presentation of these adventures, as well as such other popular subjects as the slaying of the Hydra or the Ery manthian boar, we can observe the artists' delight in the depiction of scenes of bold physical activity as they exploit the graphic possibilities of these motifs. Near the end of the sixth century and the beginning of the fifth the popularity of themes that stress Heracles' heroic nature and conquest of death in more abstract terms increases. We see, for example, many more representations of his battle with Geryon, the retrieval of Cerberus, or the apples of the Hesperides than simple combats with monstrous opponents. Although the former are fre quently presented in a lively manner, there can, I believe, also be discerned an increasing interest in and emphasis on what the particular adventure rep resents as opposed to simple depictions of act and incidents. There is, in other 46 See Galinsky's remarks on the Frogs (n. 26) 89-91 and C. H. Whitman's chapter on the play, 'Death and Life,' Aristophanes and the Comic Hero (Cambridge, Mass. 1964) 228-58. 47 See Brommer's table, Herakles ( . 26) 54, and attendant note, 95. Although Brommer's study is restricted to representations of the e ae ? in accordance with his thesis that the earliest appearance of this later canonic group was on the metopes of the temple of Zeus at Olympia?the general trends Brommer discerned in the representations of Heracles have been accepted by most critics and form the basis of my remarks.</page><page sequence="19">' TRA GH IN IAE ' 19 words, a movement toward the abstract which parallels the similar trend in Greek thought and letters in the period. I would like to close these brief surveys of the literary and artistic evidence by commenting on four monuments where the figure of Heracles plays an important role in the iconography. These works provide an exceptionally convincing witness to Heracles' importance as a cultural symbol to the Greeks in general and the Athenians in particular. The first structure is the Siphnian Treasury at Delphi (530-25), a building whose importance in the development of Greek architecture and sculpture has long been recognized.48 Although its proportions are relatively heavy, this small Ionic structure with its caryatids and continuous frieze was one of the most lavish and stunning structures in the precinct. Built from a portion of the proceeds from the island's gold and silver mines, the Treasury was erected not to commemorate a specific event or victory but to impress the other Greeks with the wealth and prosperity that the Siphnians briefly enjoyed before the Samian assault of 525. Their success can be witnessed by Herodotus' comments (3.57; cf. Pausanias 10. 11.2), the portions of the sculptures that remain, and the reconstruction of the principal fa?ade in the museum at Delphi. Above the frieze, which probably portrayed the judgment of Paris, was a pedimental group depicting Zeus moderating the conflict of Heracles and Apollo over the Delphic tripod.49 Parke and Boardman have shown quite clearly that the scene was employed as an allegory of the struggle for control of the sanctuary in the First Sacred War; Heracles had strong mythical associations with Krise, Apollo with Delphi, and Zeus' award of the tripod to Apollo parallels the outcome of the conflict.50 The manner in 48 My comments on the structure as a whole are drawn primarily from: W. B. Dinsmoor, The Architecture of Ancient Greece3 (New York-London 1950) 138-39; G. Picard, P. de la Coste-Messeli?re, Art archa?que: Les tr?sors 'Ioniques/ Fouilles de Delphes, IV. 2 (Paris 1928); Poulsen (n. 11), Chap. VIII; G. M. A. Richter, The Sculpture and Sculptors of the Greeks* (New Haven-London 1970) 6, 43-44, 82-83, 94-95 (see also her Archaic Greek Art Against Its Historical Background [New York 1949] lOOf.); M. Robertson, A History of Greek Art, 2 Vols. (Cambridge 1975) 86,152-59. These studies concentrate primarily on the lavish nature of the decoration and the contents of the continuous frieze which here made its first appearance in its 'canonical' position above the architrave. 49 B. S. Ridgway, 'The East Pediment of the Siphnian Treasury: A Reinterpretation, ' AJA 69 (1965) 1-5, conclusively identified the central figure to be Zeus. Her discussion of the iconography has done much to dispel criticism of the composition as a whole (cf. Poulsen's description of the group as 'bungling' [n. 14] 111, and E. Lapalus' comments on the imbalance of the pediment, La fronton sculpt? en Gr?ce [Paris 1947] 128-30). 50 H. W. Parke and J. Boardman, 'The Struggle for the Tripod and the First Sacred War,' JHS 77 (1957) 276-82. Parke and Boardman make a very good case that the subsequent popularity of the scene as an artistic motif may have derived from its use to commemorate the victory of the Delphians. In addition to the examples cited by Parke and Boardman, the lists compiled by Brommer, Vasenlisten ( . 26), give ample proof of the popularity of the motif in the period. In fact, as Ridgway (n. 49) 4-5, observes, confusion about the identity of the</page><page sequence="20">20 TRADITIO which the Siphnian Treasury incorporates this scene with its strong local asso ciations into a structure that was designed as an expression of the island's own national pride is exceptionally adroit, and the pairing of Heracles and Apollo about the central figure of Zeus is a clear indication of the artist's intent to recognize the importance of the hero as a cultural principle.51 This role is even more specifically illustrated in the iconography of the nearby Treasury of the Athenians. Built from a tithe of the spoils taken from the Persians of Marathon,52 the Treasury offers a proud witness to the Athen central figure was prompted in no small part by the chauvinism of Attic painters who very fre quently employed Athena as the moderator. It is interesting to note in this connection that after the Athenians were compelled to leave Boeotia in 446 ? a date that is significantly close to the most likely one for the Trachiniae (infra, n. 59) ? the Thebans issued a series of coinage in which Heracles figured prominently, and, as C. M. Kraay, Archaic and Classical Greek Coins (London 1976), observes, 'the type showing Heracles stealing the Delphic tripod must surely be intended to recall the recent elimination of Athenian influence from central Greece and consequent freeing of the sanctuary from Athenian control' (111). Kraay's study demonstrates from yet another perspective the universal popularity of Heracles throughout the Greek world, for, while many of his appearances on Greek coins can be explained in terms of specific local and political motives, many others appear to be prompted by little more than general admiration for the hero. 51 This is demonstrated by the manner in which the boldly striding Heracles balances the figures of Apollo and Artemis, and the diagonals formed by the lines of the gods' arms are continued by the legs of the tripod across the figure of Zeus toward the hero's head and shoulders. Heracles' importance would also have been pointed out by the manner in which the artist of the north frieze, which faced upon the Sacred Way, depicted him fighting on behalf of the gods against the giants. 52 In addition to the works by Dinsmoor, Poulsen, Richter, and Robertson cited before (n. 48), see J. Audiat, Le Tr?sor des Ath?niens, Fouilles de Delphes, II 'Paris 1933), P. de la Coste-Messeli?re, Sculpture du Tr?sor des Ath?niens, Fouilles de Delphes IV. 4 (Paris 1957), C. Picard, Manuel d'arch?ologie Grecque, II La Sculpture: P?riode classique (Paris 1939) 24-33. Two older studies by W. R. Agard, 'The Date of the Metopes of the Athenian Treasury at Delphi,' AJA 27 (1923) 174-84, and 'The Metopes of the Athenian Treasury as Works of Art,' AJA 27 (1923) 322-33, continue to offer a sound introduction to the iconography of the building. The basic problem that besets interpretation is the date of the structure. The French have tended to accept the witness of Pausanias (10.11.5) and believe the building to be a memorial to Athenian prowess at Marathon. This view has been challenged on technical grounds for a variety of reasons ranging from use of decorative motifs to the types of clamps employed to secure the stones in place; see, for example, W. B. Dinsmoor's 'The Athenian Treasury as Dated by its Ornament,' AJA 50 (1946) 86-121, and G. M. A. Richter's review of Picard's Manuel, AJA 49 (1945) 386-88. Dinsmoor and Richter (see also her Archaic Greek Art [n. 48]) believe that the building dates from 510-50 when, with the advent of the Cleisthenic constitution, the young Athenian democracy could reward Pythia for her inter vention in Athenian politics (Dinsmoor). I believe that the iconography and mixture of styles and hands in the decorative sculpture (see above Agard, 'Date . . . , ' and de la Coste Messeli?re, Sculpture 246-48 and PI. 98) are much more adequately explained by the later date.</page><page sequence="21">' TRAGHINIAE ' 21 ians' sense of personal accomplishment, and, as Robertson and others have observed, the element of propaganda invades the sculpture of this small but lavishly decorated building in a very explicit manner.53 Although some of the metopes are missing, others very mutilated, and the subjects of the pedimental groups a source of much debate, enough remains to form a relatively secure estimate of both the iconography of the building as a whole and the very signifi cant role that Heracles played in it. In this connection it is appropriate to note first that, while the worship of Heracles may not have belonged to the earliest stratum of Attic practice and there was no place for his worship on the Acropolis, the hero had been a welcome addition to Athenian cult practice and was widely revered throughout Attica.54 There were, in fact, more shrines and cults in his honor in the immediate suburbs of the city and outlying districts than to Theseus.55 The little Treasury at Delphi celebrates the recent victory over the Persians in very explicit terms. On the main fa?ade to the East were six metopes depicting battles between Greeks and Amazons, which afforded a clear projection of recent events into mythical and allegorical terms. The contrast between order and disorder, Greeks vs. Eastern threat, suggested by this series was echoed and developed in the metopes along the North and South faces, with those to the South depicting various exploits of Theseus and those 53 See Robertson ( . 48) 171 and C. Picard, 'Les frontons du Tr?sor des Ath?niens ? Delphes, RA 25 (1946) 214-16. J. J. Goulton, Ancient Greek Architects at Work (Ithaca 1977) 88-90, comments very suggestively on the size and scale of the building and the manner in which by such slight modifications as wider intercolumniation and use of thinner columns the archi tect achieved a much greater sense of monumentality than might be expected with such a small building. 54 As both Mylonas (n. 11) 77-78, and Nilsson, Greek Folk Religion (New York 1961 = Greek Popular Religion [New York 1940J) 60, observe, when in the latter part of the sixth century and the opening decades of the fifth the Eleusinian Mysteries became a Greek and not just an Athenian cult Heracles played an important role. Together with the Dioscuroi he was 'adopted' by Athenian sponsors and initiated into the Greater and Lesser Mysteries; one Athenian tradition even went so far as to assert that the Lesser Mysteries had themselves been instituted for the benefit of Heracles (Mylonas 240; see also his comments on representa tions of Heracles at the Mysteries, 206-12). 55 An important study on the subject is S. Woodford's 'Cults of Heracles in Attica,' Studies Presented to G. M. A. Hanf mann, Fogg Art Museum Harvard University Monographs in Art and Archaeology II, edd. D. G. Mitten, J. G. Pedley, J. A. Scott (Mainz 1971) 211-25. See also Farnell (n. 3) 107-11 and Nilsson's Cults, Myths, Oracles, and Politics in Ancient Greece (n. 3) 53-54. The evidence these scholars adduce to show the relative popularity of Hera cles over Theseus can now be readily supplemented by Brommer's Denkm?ler listen and Vasenlisten ( . 26). The esteem with which the Athenians regarded Heracles is indicated not only in his role in the Eleusinian Mysteries (supra, n. 54) but also the belief that Marathon (and therefore Athens by implication) was the first state to consecrate divine worship to Heracles (Paus. 1.15.3). On Peisistratos' use and manipulation of the figure of Heracles for political purposes see J. Boardman, 'Herakles, Peisistratos and Sons,' RA 1972, fase. 1, 57-72, and 'Heracles, Peisistratos and Eleusis,' JHS 95 (1975) 1-12.</page><page sequence="22">22 TRADITIO to the North adventures of Heracles.56 A thematic link with the sequence on the front was provided by the easternmost metope of both series; each de picted a conflict between the appropriate hero and an Amazon, a connection which was in turn reinforced by the mounted Amazons on the acroteria. Al though the metopes depicting the exploits of Theseus would have been more conspicuous to the spectator ascending the Sacred Way, there can be little doubt that the artists intended to parallel the exploits of Heracles and Theseus. Heracles' importance is indicated not only by the metopes to the North but also by the series which depicted his conflict with Geryon on the West end of the building. The manner in which this group thematieally balances the met opes on the eastern fa?ade (and does so in terms of appropriate geographical orientation as well) is another indication of the conceptual and stylistic so phistication of the building as a whole. While the fragmentary remains of the pedimental sculpture prevent definite identification of their subjects, it is very likely that Heracles and Theseus played an important role in these groups as well.57 As an expression of national pride and accomplishment few buildings 56 There has been considerable debate about both the sequence and subject of the metopes (and especially those from the North face). De la Coste-Messeli?re, Sculpture du Tr?sor des Ath?niens ( . 52) provides the following ? South: Theseus and Sinis, Theseus and brigand, Theseus and Kerkyon, Theseus and Athena, Theseus and Marathonian Bull, Theseus and Minotaur, and Theseus and Amazon; North: Heracles and Nemean Lion, Heracles and Centaur, Heracles and Atlas, Heracles and Hind, and Heracles and an Amazon. The prominent role Heracles played in the sculpture of this monument was due not only to his Pan-Hellenic prominence but also specific connections with Marathon and the battle; the Marathonians claimed that they had been the first to recognize Heracles as a god (supra, n. 55), the Greek army encamped in a s?nctuary of Heracles before the actual battle and again in another sanctuary of the hero (Kynosarges) after the battle when they withdrew to Athens to prevent another landing (cf. Her. 6.108,116). The relative importance of Heracles and Theseus to one another in Attic iconography and 'thought' is a very difficult question. It is frequently implied, if not openly stated (cf. Nilsson, Cults, Myths, Oracles, and Politics in Ancient Greece [n. 3] 55 and Greek Folk Religion [n. 54] 57), that Theseus is a more civilized and less 'mythical' hero than Heracles. In an abstract sense this may be correct, but Heracles and his exploits were always much better known, and when the two heroes are juxtaposed the basic point or frame of reference is Heracles and not Theseus. 57 De la Coste-Messeli?re's initial hypothesis, 'Observations sur les sculptures du tr?sor des Ath?niens,' BCH 47 (1923) 387-419, was that the East pediment was centered not on one group but on two, the contest of Apollo and Heracles for the tripod to the right and the apotheosis of Heracles to the left (393-94). After Audiat's (n. 52) revision of de la Coste Messeli?re's assignment of the geison blocks, Picard and de la Coste-Messeli?re, La sculpture grecque ? Delphes (Pans 1929), asserted that the subject was the apotheosis of Heracles 'sans doute' (24). In 1938 de la Coste-Messeli?re, 'Frontons Delphiques,' Annales de l'?cole des Hautes ?tudes de Gand II (1938) 109-23, argued that the subject was an encounter between Heracles and Theseus with Athena in the center (122), a proposal that he reiterated in the Fouilles des Delphes ( . 52) 178. Although in 1939 Picard, Manuel d'Arch?ologie Grecque ( . 52) 26, continued, but with less conviction, his belief that the subject was Heracles' a</page><page sequence="23">' TRAGHINIAE ' 23 are more satisfactory than the Treasury, and the iconography of the building offers incontrovertible evidence about Heracles' significance to the Athenians. As impressive as the iconography of the Treasury of the Athenians is in this regard, an even more striking collocation of Heracles and Theseus is provided by the sculpture of the Hephaisteion.58 Erected slightly earlier than the Parthenon and the most likely date for the composition of the Trachiniae,59 potheosis, in his note 'Les frontons du Tr?sor des Ath?niens ? Delphes* (n. 53) Picard pro posed that the pedimental group was possibly Theseus and Perithous centered on Apollo on the voyage to Hades, whence they will be rescued by Heracles. This suggestion was seconded by Lapalus (n. 49) 161-64, who developed Picard's proposals from a slightly different perspective. The common factor that binds all these proposals, as well as those for the even more fragmentary remains of the West pediment, together is the conviction which the au thors express about the importance of Heracles' role in the iconography of the building. If we bear in mind the general popularity of Heracles as a subject for pedimental sculpture (cf. Lapalus' table [n. 49] 458-62), and that the apotheosis of Heracles was among the topics drawn from the hero's career that had already figured in the archaic pedimental sculpture on the Acropolis (see Richter [ . 48] 4), the appropriateness of his presence on this structure celebrating the great Athenian victory at Marathon is even less surprising. 58 My remarks on the structure are especially indebted to the following studies: W. B. Dinsmoor, Observations on the Hephaisteion, Hesperia Suppl. V, 1941; H. A. Thompson and R. E. Wycherley, The Athenian Agora, XIV: The Agora of Athens (Princeton 1972) 140 49; E. G. Olsen, 'An Interpretation of the Hephaisteion Reliefs,' AJA 42 (1938) 276-87; . A. Thompson, 'The Pedimental Sculpture of the Hephaisteion,' Hesperia 18 (1949) 230-68. Woodford ( . 44) Chap. 11, offers a very convenient survey of the structure and the different ways in which various features have been reconstructed and interpreted; Woodford also sees a marked continuity between the Treasury at Delphi and the Hephaisteion (cf. 228-32). C. H. Morgan's four-part study, 'The Sculptures of the Hephaisteion,' Hesperia 31 (1962) 210-19, 221-35, Hesperia 32 (1963) 92-108, offers a very suggestive hypothesis about the chronology of the building's construction as well as comments on the sculpture; see also E. B. Harrison's detailed studies of the cult figures, 'Alkamenes' Sculptures for the Hephaist eion,' AJA 81 (1977) 137-78, 265-87, 411-26 and R. E. Wycherley's response to H. Koch's thesis (Studien zum Theseustempel in Athen [Berlin 1955]) that the temple was dedicated to Heracles and Theseus in his 'The Temple of Hephaistos,' JHS 79 (1959) 153-56. 59 One of the most constant preoccupations of Sophoclean scholarship has been the question of the date of the Trachiniae, and a considerable literature has developed on the topic. Using a wide variety of techniques and approaches, critics have assigned the drama to virtually every period of Sophocles' long career. At one extreme, for example, Ronnet (n. 1) 323-24, believes that the drama is a young man's manifesto against the Dorian ideal of the archaic age and dates the play to ca. 464-62; at the other, G. Perrotta, Sofocle (Messina Milan 1935) 526-58, asserted that the drama demonstrated profound Euripidean influence and dated the play to the same period as the Philoctetes (409). These extreme views have not won many converts (cf. Knox's comments on Ronnet's thesis in his review [n. 1] and F. Earp's comments on Perrotta, 'The Trachiniae,' CR 53 [1939] 113-15), and most critics have assigned it to a very loosely defined 'middle period. ' In the first part of this century scholars tended to assign the play to ca. 420 on the basis of what they felt was strong Euripidean influence in terms of dramaturgy and character portrayal. As time progressed the inclination to regard the play as earlier has grown, and the same evidence which had been employed to</page><page sequence="24">24 TRADITIO the temple honors the god whose significance to the Athenians of the period Olsen described in the following terms: He [Hephaistos] is the deity who presides over man's modelling of rude ma terials as a defense against the forces of nature. He is the prime mover of civilization and material order, just as Zeus is, throughout fifth-century literature, the prime mover of justice and material order.60 The sculpture illustrated this motif not by examples of the god's own exploits or intervention in human affairs but by incidents that indicate his power as a civilizing force in action. As Olsen remarked, . . the reliefs all represent occasions on which the deity's power has aided man, and the legendary and the emotional relation of the Athenian spectators with the victorious pro tagonists imply that the power and assistance continue.'61 In illustrating this conviction the representations of Heracles played an important and highly conspicuous role in integrating the iconography of the structure. The metopes of the principal fa?ade to the East were devoted to representations of the labors of Heracles and epitomize themes that are continued in the remainder demonstrate Euripidean influence on Sophocles has been used to prove Sophoclean priority (cf., e.g., E. R. Schwinge, Die Stellung der Trachinierinnen im Werk des Sophokles, Hypom nemata I [G?ttingen 1962]). Although the various 'conclusive' arguments have not succeeded in resolving the question of the Trachiniae's date and have, unfortunately, been undertaken to imply a series of value judgments on the merits of the dramas involved (e.g., P. W. Harsh's very sharp appraisal of the Trachiniae as an inferior imitation of the Heracles Furens in his A Handbook of Classical Drama [Stanford 1944,1948] 129-32), they have been of considerable service in demonstrating the range and types of dramatic cross-influences in the fifth century. The question of Sophocles' influence on Bacchylides or vice versa, and Aeschylean influence (and especially the parallels with the situation and characters of the Oresteia), have also been examined in some detail (e.g., S. G. Kapsomenos, Sophokles' Trachinierinnen und ihr Vorbild [Athens 1963]), and discussions of the parallels with the characters and situation of the Or esteia are very useful in demonstrating the sophistication of Sophocles' play (I do not con cur with T. F. Hoey's thesis, 'The Trachiniae and the Early Forms of Tragedy,' Helios 5 [1977] 47-53, that the dramaturgy of the play is relatively undeveloped). Convenient surveys of the various issues and problems involved are offered in the following works : G. M. Kirk wood's Appendix, 'On the Approximate Date of The Trachinian Women,' A Study of Sopho clean Drama (Ithaca 1958) 289-94; H. A. Pohlsander, 'Lyrical Meters and Chronology in Soph ocles,' AJP 84 (1963) 280-86, C. E. Sorum, 'Monsters and the Family' (diss., Brown University 1975), Appendix II; and C. H. Whitman's Chapter (III) on the chronology of the extant dramas (n. 2). In my opinion the most likely date for the drama is relatively soon after and at most a decade later than the Antigone (442?). 60 Olsen ( . 58) 277; this emphasis was underscored by placement of the temple on the edge of the agora nearest the metal workers' quarter and the presence of dual cult statues to Hephaistos and Athena within the cella; on the iconography of the latter see Harrison's studies (n. 58). 61 Olsen ( . 58) 286; as a number of commentators have observed, this 'oblique' approach was necessary since the myths and legends surrounding the god did not offer many specific examples of the god's direct intervention into human affairs.</page><page sequence="25">' TRACHINIAE ' 25 of the building's decorative sculpture. The subjects were familiar ones which illustrated the common motif of Heracles making the world safe for man.62 They were framed by a similar series of four metopes extending to the plane of the cella on both the North and South sides, which depicted parallel exploits of Theseus.63 The relative placement of these series to one another illustrates, in a much more explicit manner than had been the case at the Treasury of the Athenians at Delphi, the designer's intent to glorify, if not legitimize, the Athenians' national champion by using his exploits to frame the Pan-Hellenic example of Heracles. The theme of the imposition of order over crude barbaric forces common to both series was continued in the friezes above the pronaos and opisthodomos. Although there has been considerable debate about the specific subject and characters depicted on the East frieze, the most plausible supposition is that it represented an attack of the Athenians led by Theseus against the gigantic Pallantidae who were believed to have once inhabited nearby Mt. Hymettos.64 This subject offered a very specific * local' example of the general principle illustrated by the metopes of Heracles on the same face of the building. The spectator's sense of the thematic counterpart between these two series and the parallels between the two heroes would have been encouraged by the fact that the East frieze extended from epistyle to epistyle. This variation from standard practice not only avoided what Coulton terms 'the usual box-within-a-cage effect' of most Greek temples but also set off the front pteroma as an enclosed compartment.65 As a result, the approaching spectator would have been encouraged by the architecture of the building itself to view the dynamic, continuous action of the frieze in a context framed by different labors of Heracles illustrating the same general theme.66 62 Nemean Lion, Hydra, Hind, Erymanthian Boar, Mares of Diomedes, Cerberus, Heracles and Hippolyta, Geryon (2 metopes), and the Apples of the Hesperides. This collocation of subjects demonstrates quite clearly that, while the canonic e ae per se might not yet have emerged, a strong sense of a formal group of Heracles' most important labors was already well recognized in the period. 63 North face: Periphetes, Kerkyon, Skiron, Krommyon Sow. South face : Procrustes, Sinis, Marathonian Bull, and Minotaur; see Morgan (n. 58) Pt.

II, 232.</page><page sequence="26">26 TRADITIO The importance of Heracles to the iconography of the building is increased if we accept Thompson's proposal that the East pediment represented the apotheosis of Heracles.67 Although the remains are fragmentary and the details unclear, this suggestion is by far the most plausible that has been advanced. As Thompson observed, such a scene would have provided a natural culmination for the thematic progression of the metopes which begins with his traditionally first labor, the slaying of the Nemean lion, on the left and ends with the Apples of the Hesperides on the right.68 The pedimental sculpture would then have illustrated the reward of such heroic endeavor in very explicit terms, and the theme of immortality through heroic accomplishment may also have been suggested by the presence of the Hesperides on the acroterion.69 The motif of heroic endeavor against primal forces which is so prominent on the sculptures of the East end of the building was echoed on the West. The frieze above the opisthodomos portrayed the battle of the Lapiths and the Centaurs in which the figure of Theseus appears once more.70 The absence of feminine figures suggests that the artists wished to show not so much the motifs of lust and violation as the bringing of order against semi-human forces. The West pedi mental group contained a Centauromachy which not only provided the classic balance to the relatively static scene on the East but also a thematic context for the punitive raid depicted on the frieze above the opisthodomos.71 The iconog raphy of the building is a complex matter with many unresolved details, but the prominent role the figure of Heracles plays in it indicates not only the Athenians' familiarity with but great respect for this figure.72 67 Thompson ( . 58) 245-46; as Thompson observes (231), B. Sauer's reconstruction of the East pediment as a representation of the birth of Erichthonios on the basis of his detailed examination of the cuttings in pediment floors (Das sogenannte Theseion und sein plastischer Schmuck [Leipzig 1899]) aroused considerable skepticism. W. . Dinsmoor, 'The Lost Pedimental Sculptures at Bassae,' AJA 43 (1939) 27-47, believed the sculptures had been carried off to Rome and described the occurrence as 'a case of vandalism so current in the days of the Roman empire' (27). Morgan (n. 58) Pt. Ill, 92-94, does not accept Thompson's proposal and on the basis of analogies with the Parthenon argues that the theme was the birth of Athena. 68 Thompson (n. 58) 245-46. 69 Thompson (n. 58) 248-51; because he believes the subject of the pedimental group was the birth of Athena, Morgan (n. 58) Pt. Ill, Appendix III, 97-98, does not concur, but offers no alternative suggestion. 70 See Olsen ( . 58) 281-84, and Morgan (n. 58) Pt. II, 222-23. 71 On the basis of recent discoveries and re-examination of earlier evidence the identification of the West pediment as a centauromachy now seems without question; see Thompson and Wycherley (n. 58) 148 and E. B. Harrison (Report of paper delivered at Fifty-Seventh General Meeting of the Archaeological Institute of America) AJA 60 (1956) 178. 72 Even if we discount Thompson's thesis that the East pediment depicted his apotheosis, Heracles' presence on the East metopes demonstrates his importance and relative superiority over Theseus.

In this great example of early or transitional classical art we find a very thorough integration of the decorative art and the local setting and occasion.73 The building itself provides a striking example of the Greeks' great gift in erecting monuments which were not only beautiful in their own right but also elegant expressions of their cultural ideals. The basic subject of the sculpture was Zeus and his children, and this choice was used to illustrate the theme of the high costs required to ensure the presence of order in this world. As the visitor approached his attention was initially directed toward the figure of Zeus on the East pediment presiding over the prelude to the race between Oenamaus and Pelops, the mythological prototype for the great contests of the Olympian games. While there is little suggestion of the forth coming treachery, the latent irony of this peaceful majestic scene with its ordered, rectilinear groupings becomes clear when it is balanced against the West pediment, with the commanding presence of Apollo with arm outstretched over the dynamic, sinuous forms of the battle of the Lapiths and the Centaurs. The tension between these two groups is echoed through an elaborate series of contrasts and parallels between man and god, man and animal, and Greek and barbarian by which the artists illustrated both the need for and high costs of order in this world. This theme was illustrated on the metopes below, where, as Brommer demonstrated (Heracles, supra, n. 26), the canonic e ae made its first appearance in Greek art and literature. Ashmole describes the appropriateness of this selection in the following manner: . . . the choice of the exploits of Heracles to decorate this particular temple was a singularly happy one. Heracles was the greatest of all the Greek heroes, he was known to everyone, especially here, because he had spent much of his life in the P?loponn?se, and performed half his famous labours there. He was the patron of athletes, and had actually established the first Olympic Games on this very spot. He was the son of Zeus, and this was the temple of Zeus: but he also typified the life of man on earth, who battles on against seemingly impossible odds, endures sudden and terrible calamities ?how like real life this must have been to many Greeks?yet by sheer de the sculptors exploited the figure of Heracles on the Hephaisteion to compensate for a lack of prominent monuments in his honor on nearby cult shrines, underestimates Heracles' general importance to the Athenians of the period, which is indicated not only by the Hephais teion but also by his possible appearance on the pedimental sculpture of the Parthenon; see Robertson (n. 48) 302. 73 In addition to the general surveys of Dinsmoor, Richter, and Robertson (n. 48) and Brommer's Herakles ( . 26), my remarks on the temple are particularly indebted to B. Ashmole and N. Yalouris, Olympia: The Sculptures of the Temple of Zeus (London 1967) and B. Ashmole's Architect and Sculptor in Classical Greece (New York 1972).</page><page sequence="28">28 TRADITIO termination, and, one may add, very hard work, wins through in the end, and, with the help of Athena, is received by Zeus into Olympus.74 The series is a remarkable one in any number of regards, and critics have noted quite appropriately the technical mastery of the sculptors, their compositional skill in fitting such a varied series of subjects into the regular space of the metopes, and the sensitive portrayal of the characters. Commentators have frequently dwelt upon the manner in which the progressive portrait of the gradually aging Heracles unifies the group. As Pollitt observes, the subtle progression in the portrayal of Heracles from an eager but uncertain figure at the start of his labors to a weary but triumphant one at their close conveys a unity of and a in highly refined form; we see in effect what sort of man a hero must be and what he must endure in very convincing terms.75 Another striking quality of the metopes is the manner in which such a varied series of subjects, drawn from such different sources and levels of discourse, is presented in such an integrated manner. The metopes convey a unity of con ception that is matched by few other ancient works of art; simple folk-tale combats and situations of much deeper import such as the Apples of the Hesperides are portrayed with equal grace and acuity, and then these works in turn are integrated with the sculpture and iconography of the building as a whole. The role of Heracles on this structure not only epitomizes many of the factors considered in conjunction with the other three monuments, but also demonstrates in a very convincing fashion the profound and catholic hold of Heracles on the Greek imagination of the fifth century. When the evidence considered in the preceding brief surveys is borne in mind, I think that there can be little doubt of the significance of heroes, their cults, and the figure of Heracles to the audience for whom Sophocles composed the Trachiniae. Heroes and their cults formed an important part of Greek religious practice, and there was a real personal and civic devotion to these cults. Of all the many figures accorded heroic status none was more important or evocative to the Greeks than Heracles, and in this figure we can see all the tensions and ambiguities reflected in Greek attitudes toward heroes as a class reflected to a very high degree. It should also be clear that Heracles was a fig ure who had made a deep impression on the Athenians from very early on. 74 Ashmole ( . 73) 61. The figure of Heracles also appeared prominently on the interior decorations and ornamentation of the colossal statue of Zeus by Pheidias that was added later; see Robertson (n. 48) 317-18. 75 J. J. Pollitt, Art and Experience in Classical Greece (Cambridge 1972) 50; cf. 24: 'Perhaps it is not too reckless to say that when the designer of the metopes of the temple of Zeus at Olympia decided to show Herakles at different stages of his life and in different states of mind, he did so because he intuitively felt that these qualified conditions were stages in a meaningful scheme of things. ' Pollitt also offers an interesting series of analogies between the sculpture of the temple as a whole and the Oresteia (27-36).</page><page sequence="29">' TRAGHIN IAE ' 29 He was the subject of numerous popular cults, his exploits were an exceptionally popular subject for Attic black and red figure ware, and, as the iconography of the Treasury of the Athenians at Delphi and the Hephaisteion demonstrates with great clarity, he was an important paradigm by which the Athenians justified their own national hero Theseus as well as an important vehicle of cultural ideals in his own right. It should also be clear from the preceding surveys that Heracles was a very diverse figure who offered myriad possibilities for interpretation and response, ranging from comic parody to sententious expression of the loftiest cultural ideals. The very diversity which made this hero such a significant figure among the Greeks also meant that once Sophocles had chosen to write a play about him he had to define his character with care. To a much greater extent than was the case with the dramatist's other major figures, there was no fixed com munis against or with which he might manipulate the audience's re sponse. Another related problem the dramatist faced stemmed from the nature of the exploits with which Heracles was most readily identified in the period, for although a process of internalization and intellectualization was taking place, Heracles' most familiar adventures were much more akin to folk and fairy tale than the speculative themes that formed the staple of Attic drama. Heracles was essentially a figure of bold and decisive action against often bizarre opponents, and such deeds lent themselves much more readily to the delightful parody of comic drama than to the tragic stage. The stress on physical action which is so characteristic of most of his exploits and which had formed the basis for his widespread popularity is simply not in accord with the emphasis on dialogue and dialectic that lies at the heart of Attic drama, and the technical resources of the theater could offer little convincing assistance in their presentation.76 As Hendrickson noted in an explicit fashion sixty years 76 Character and action were presented primarily through words and not deeds on the Attic stage, and this emphasis, which may initially appear to be a major limitation from our perspective, was, in the hands of the Attic dramatists, a major source of the power of their dramas. I am especially indebted to the following studies which approach the genre from this perspective: P. D. Arnott, An Introduction to the Greek Theatre (London 1959, 1962), Greek Scenic Conventions (Oxford 1962), A. M. Dale, 'Ethos and Dianoia: "Character" and "Thought" in Aristotle's Poetics/ AO ML A 11 (1959) 3-16 and J. Jones, On Aristotle and Greek Tragedy (London 1962). P. Walcot's Greek Drama in its Theatrical and Social Context (Cardiff 1976) supplements these studies in a very useful manner; his discussions of the role of action and the influence of the courts on the Attic stage are especially suggestive and judi cious. The impact of the latter must not be underestimated; Athenian drama was in many respects much more allied to the courts than the cults: see J. Duchemin, \J9A dans la tra g?die grecque (Paris 1945) and H. Strohm, Euripides, Zetemata 15 (Munich 1957). Although Strohm's focus is not on Sophocles, he makes many sound observations on the impact of the courts on the genre and Sophocles' use of these dramatic patterns.</page><page sequence="30">30 TRADITIO ago: 'the truth is that the Heracles myth belongs to a type which does not readily lend itself to tragic treatment.'77 These factors must be borne in mind in any analysis of the drama. It is not sufficient to assert, albeit with utmost propriety, that Heracles is a hero and an important figure to the Athenians and then assume that these data explain the character or the drama.78 What must be done instead is to identify within the fabric of the dramatic action those elements Sophocles selected from among the diverse traditions to which he fell heir and then observe how he construed them to present the vision of heroism that he did. We must, in other words, determine how selection and emphasis on the part of the dramatist brought a specific focus to a character and theme that offered diverse pos sibilities. The following analysis is not intended to offer a complete exposition of the text but concentrates on three topics: the sequence of events Sophocles constructs, their internal logic and related questions of structure, and the types or levels of experience that are reflected in the play.79 I believe that a care 77 G. L. Hendrickson, 'The Heracles Myth and Its Treatment by Euripides,' Classical Studies in Honor of Charles Foster Smith, University of Wisconsin Studies in Language and Literature 3 (Madison 1919) 11-29, 14; see also Campbell's incidental remarks (n. 27) 238. V. Ehrenberg, 'Tragic Heracles,' Aspects of the Ancient World (Oxford 1946) 144-66, 146, and P. J. Conradie, Herakles in die Griekse Tragedie (Groningen 1958) Chapter I, both believe that Heracles' 'success' as a comic figure impeded his use on the tragic stage. Although Galinsky's chapter, 'The Tragic Hero' (n. 26), offers an appropriate balance to this view, I believe that, so far as the evidence allows us to judge, Heracles' appearances on the Attic stage were relatively rare in light of his general cultural significance. Because he stood for so many things in so many ways, Heracles was a very hard character for any dramatist to present in a convincing manner and, as the literature on other dramas where he figures in the action such as the Alcestis, Heracles Furens, and Philoctetes demonstrates, Heracles' appear ances in these dramas has been the source of considerable critical debate and speculation as well. 78 Consider, for example, the studies of S. M. Adams, Sophocles the Playwright (Toronto 1957) 108-9, and C. M. Bowra, Sophoclean Tragedy (Oxford 1944) 131-32, who, while they acknowledge Heracles' heroic status and the audience's familiarity with Heracles as a cult figure, do not make effective use of these factors in their comments on the drama. Knox's Heroic Temper (n. 1) 54-58, conveys an excellent sense of the impact of the traditional concept of heroism on Sophocles but, paradoxically, does not apply it to the figure of Heracles in the Trachiniae. P. Holt, 'The Imagery of Sophokles' TrachiniaV (diss., Stanford University 1976), is one of the few writers to address the question directly, and his remarks on the topic (124 31) parallel my own sentiments. 79 My comments on the text have been guided by the commentaries of Paley (n. 27), Campbell (n. 27), R. C. Jebb, Sophocles, The Plays and Fragments, Part V, The Trachiniae (Cambridge 1892), and J. C. Kamerbeek, The Plays of Sophocles, Part II, The Trachiniae (Leiden 1970). I regret that I was unable to obtain a copy of O. Longo's Commento linguistico alle Trachinie di Sofocle (Padua 1968) until the major portion of my remarks were completed. For the sake of brevity, bibliographic references and dicussion of points of controversy in the commentary and notes that follow are restricted to the most important examples and problems.</page><page sequence="31">' TRAGHINIAE ' 31 ful analysis of these three interrelated elements is absolutely essential for understanding the figure of Heracles Sophocles constructs; they are, in my opinion, as important a witness about Heracles' heroic temper as either what he says himself or what is said about him. I also believe that we can observe in the manner in which Sophocles manipulates these various elements many of the same tensions and ambiguities about this figure that we observed in the first part of this essay. To understand how this can be the case we must turn to the play itself. With the prologue the dramatist establishes the basic human dimensions and framework of the drama. The play opens with an extended speech by Deia neira in which she speculates on her lot. Although this address has frequently been compared to Euripides' expository prologues (and especially that of the Andromache), the intensity with which Deianeira delineates her present state in terms of past experience makes the scene much more than a vehicle for iden tification of characters and situation. The manner in which her speech begins is highly indicative of the temper that she is to display throughout, for immediately after she offers the Solonian tag that no one is to be called happy before he has died she expresses her conviction that her lot is distinct from this general rule and harsh from start to finish (5).80 To support this contention she tells first of her apprehension at her wooing by the river Acheloiis in three different forms and then her rescue by Heracles. The hesitant manner in which she characterizes the outcome of their combat (el a , 27) is developed in the account of her marriage, with its stress upon Heracles' fre quent absences and the comparison of his infrequent presence to a farmer who visits a distant field to sow and to reap (32-33). As she turns to the immediate situation, she reiterates her conviction that her lot is distinct from the general rule in the way that she balances her increasing apprehension against the real ization that Heracles has completed his appointed labors (36-37). The audience learns that she has been living in exile in Trachis since Iphitus' death and that Heracles has been away now for fifteen months. At the close of the speech Deianeira's anxiety and the urgency of the present moment are under 80 In their remarks on the play both H. D. F. Kitto, Poiesis (Berkeley and Los Angeles 1966) 154-91 (cf. the author's Greek Tragedy3 [London 1961] Chap. X, Pt. I) and A. Lesky, Greek Tragedy, trans. H. A. Frankfort (London-New York 1965), Chap. V, stress the replication of the natural cycle in the movement of the drama as a whole. Lesky and Whitman (n. 2) Chap. VI relate this motif to the question of the limitations of human knowledge, and Whitman in particular sees Sophocles' outlook as very bleak (104, 106, 120-21; cf. Lesky 108-9). In his 'Sun Symbolism in the Parodos of the Trachiniae,' Arethusa 5 (1972) 133-54, T. F. Hoey develops in a very suggestive manner his thesis that much of the tension in the drama comes from a contrast between cyclical and absolute states of being.</page><page sequence="32">32 TRADITIO scored by the stress upon the yet undefined message on the tablet that Heracles has left behind (cf. 44-48).81 This efficient and energetic opening of the drama not only sets forth the basic parameters of Deianeira's character but also introduces many of the major motifs of the play as a whole. Although its primary effect is to present Deia neira, we learn of a monstrous suitor, a heroic Heracles, and the urgency of the immediate moment. The initial impression Deianeira conveys is not one of either confidence or assurance; she takes no pride from her role as Heracles' wife, and the realms of marriage and heroic accomplishment which appear to be so closely linked in terms of the narrative sequence of events are in her mind quite distinct if not contrary realms of expectation.82 Deianeira conveys a sense of having been imposed upon by forces and events that are beyond her ken. The manner in which she refers to Acheloiis, Heracles, and their combat not only delineates her personal fears but also conveys a sense of a cruder, primal realm of experience that is quite apart from normal human expectations.83 81 The strong emphasis on time and specific periods of time that are present in this speech and others should be understood in a generic sense as one of the means the dramatist chose to convey a sense of the urgency of the present moment. There is also, however, the possibility that the specific intervals, twelve and fifteen months, may reflect Sophocles' desire to accom modate very old, traditional material into the fabric of the drama; see A. W. Verrall, 'The Calendar in the Trachiniae of Sophocles,' CR 10 (1896) 85-92. 82 P. E. Easterling, 'Sophocles, Trachiniae/ BICS 15 (1968) 58-69, very aptly characterizes the opening in the following terms: believe that Sophocles has taken pains in the first forty lines to show the relationship between Deianeira and Heracles from the start of their marriage so that we can judge what happens in the play not just as the outcome of a particular deed done recently by Heracles, but of what he has always been like' (60). 83 It is the recognition and acceptance of this dimension of the play's experience that constitutes one of the most important advances in recent scholarship on the drama. Sorum (supra, n. 59) offers in her initial chapter a good survey of critical responses to the problem. My own views on the topic have been shaped most directly by the following studies: U. Albini, 'Dubbi sulle Trachinie,' PP 23 (1968) 262-70, G. H. Gellie, Sophocles, A Reading (Melbourne 1972), F. J. H. Letters, The Life and Work of Sophocles (London 1953), G. M? autis, Sophocle, Essai sur le h?ros tragique (Paris 1957), and J. T. Sheppard, The Wisdom of Sophocles (London 1947). With varying emphases, Gellie, Letters, and Sheppard stress the tension between primal and human dimensions of the drama and its impact on Deianeira in a manner that is parallel to the very useful remarks of D. M. Jones, 'Euripides' Alcestis,' CR 62 (1948) 50-55, and K. von Fritz's 'Euripides' Alkestis und ihre modernen Nachahmer und Kritiker,' A&amp;A 5 (1956) 27-70, on that drama. In his three parallel studies, 'Mariage et sacrifice dans les Trachiniennes de Sophocle,' AC 44 (1975) 30-50, 'The Hydra's Nursling: Image and Action in the Trachiniae,' AC 44 (1975) 612-67, and 'Sophocles' Trachiniae: Myth, Poetry and Heroic Values,' YCS 25 (1977) 99-158, C. Segal makes constant use of the distinction between the human and primal levels of experience from a variety of different perspectives. In a similar but much more extreme vein J. Kott, The Eating of the Gods (New York 1973) believes that Heracles and Deianeira are representative of two worlds, one mythical, the other contemporary, that never meet (128). In the introduction to their</page><page sequence="33">' TRAGHINIAE ' 33 Although the relevance of the realm of the monstrous to the present situation is not developed immediately, Sophocles has signaled its significance from the very start of the drama. With the entrance of the Nurse and subsequently Hyllus, the dramatist redirects our attention to the human dimensions of the immediate situation from two quite distinct and understandable points of view. The Nurse's brief speech displays an attitude of common sense that is in marked contrast to Deianeira's apprehension. When Hyllus enters, the audience learns of Heracles' rumored bondage to Omphale, the war against Eurytus, and the oracle that once he has accomplished this task he is to have peace forevermore. The second part of the prologue both expands the audience's understanding of the immediate situation and conveys a sense of normal human expectations. The confidence of the Nurse and Hyllus set Deianeira's reserve in even greater contrast, and the scene concludes with Deianeira sending Hyllus forth to seek news of his father with greater assurance than she has displayed before. The parados reinforces and expands upon the antinomies introduced by the prologue in an explicit fashion. The first strophe is concerned exclusively with Heracles as the Chorus queries the sun for some notion of his whereabouts. The sense of cyclic rhythm suggested by the phrasing of this invocation (cf. 94-95) echoes the gnomic beginning of the play and is balanced by an almost 'gigantic' vision of Heracles bestriding the seas and continents at the close of the strophe.84 This heroic vision is balanced by the subdued, if not cowering, description of Deianeira as a huddling bird in the antistrophe. The juxta new translation, Sophocles, Women of Trachis, The Greek Tragedy in New Translations, ed. W. Arrowsmith (New York 1978) G. K. Williams and G. W. Dickerson stress the im portance of the themes of mutability, uncertainty and change but consider the central motif of the drama to be the 'constant resurgence of irrational bestiality in the world, the tragic, primeval struggle of civilized humanity to stifle or exclude the savagery and violence which threaten it both from without and from within' (6). Their emphasis on this tension in the drama parallels Kirk's assessment of Heracles and Segal's sentiments about its general importance in Greek culture (supra, n. 29). The presence of references to a primal world of experience in the Trachiniae is commonly explained in terms of the sources on which Sophocles drew. The initial chapter of G. Dickerson's 'The Structure and Interpretation of Sophocles' Trachiniae' (diss., Princeton University 1972) offers a thorough review of this material; see also C. Dugas, 'La mort du centaure Nessos,' REA 45 (1943) 18-26, A. . Krappe, 'La robe de D?janire,' REG 52 (1939) 565-72, and F. Stoessel, Der Tod des Herakles (Z?rich 1945). As we shall see, the role of the primal is closely related to that of eros in the drama, and there has been considerable variation by the critics in the manner and extent to which they believe the two topics are distinguished. 84 It is unfortunate that the text and consequently the significance of this very striking image is obscure; in addition to the commentaries of Jebb, Kamerbeek, and Longo ( . 79), see . Lloyd-Jones, 'Sophoclea,' CQ n.s. 4 (1954) 91-95, 91-93. G. M. Kirkwood, 'The Dramatic Role of the Chorus in Sophocles,' Phoenix 8 (1954) 1-22, offers a balanced appraisal of the Chorus as a whole and analyzes and contrasts the Chorus of this play with the Choruses of the other dramas.</page><page sequence="34">34 TRADITIO position of these two sets of verses points to the essential difference between the pair that will be developed throughout the drama, and by the contrast the audience is reminded of both the attitude of apprehension which characterized Deianeira's initial speech and how she has been the prize (cf. a e , 104) of greater forces. With the second strophe Sophocles returns to Heracles; the sea imagery with which the first strophe closed is developed into an ex pression of the cyclical nature of his fortunes before the Chorus concludes with an expression of their hope that on this occasion he will once more escape death.85 In the corresponding antistrophe the Chorus addresses Deianeira directly and gently rebukes her for not remembering that Zeus does not give a painless lot to men.86 This sense of the cyclic rhythm in human affairs is then re inforced by the very striking image of the Great Bear whirling in the heavens above with which the antistrophe concludes.87 The effect of this image is intensified in turn in the concluding epode where the parallels between the natural universe and the alternation of human affairs is emphasized once more. At the close of the ode the Chorus asks Deianeira to bear in mind the ebb and flow of human life and attempts to console her about Heracles' lot by posing the query, 'when has Zeus been so careless about his children?' (139-40). This juxtaposition of the interests of Deianeira and Heracles points to both the intimate involvement and the distance between the pair that was implicit throughout the preceding systems. In the concluding epode we are presented, in effect, with the basic quandary which the drama as a whole explores: how are the interests of a couple who are both so intimately involved and yet seem to be so distant in so many fundamental ways going to be reconciled not only to each other but also to the rhythm of the world about them? The parodos does not resolve but rather poses the problem in very vivid terms. The alternation of focus from Heracles and then Deianeira echoes the sense of natural ebb and flow that is the thematic center of the parodos as a whole.88 85 On the text of the strophe and Reiske's commonly accepted emendation of 117 see A. Macro, 'Sophocles, Trachiniae, 112-21/ AJP 94 (1973) 1-3. 86 I concur with H. Lloyd-Jones' analysis of the text of the passage, 'Notes on Sophocles' Trachiniae/ YCS 22 (1972) 263-70, 263-64, which sharpens the note of implied rebuke in the Chorus' address to Deianeira. 87 The importance of his image as a reflection of a major theme of the drama has long been recognized; in addition to Hoey's article (n. 80) and Jones' very apt description (n. 76) of how the fixity of the pole 'makes it the just figure of Sophoclean mutability' (175), see H. Musurillo, 'Fortune's Wheel: Trachiniae/ The Light and the Darkness (Leiden 1967) 61-79. Because of the long history of the image and its parallels I do not share T. B. L. Webster's belief, 'Sophocles' Trachiniae/ Greek Poetry and Life, edd. C. Bailey et al. (Oxford 1936) 164-80, that the passage demonstrates Sophocles' acquaintance with Ionian philosophy (166). 88 On the manner in which the formal structure of the parodos replicates its thematic con tent see Hoey (n. 80) 140-42. I do not concur with D. Wender's translation of the ode into</page><page sequence="35">' TRAGHINIAE ' 35 In a very adroit and suggestive manner Sophocles has expanded upon elements from the prologue, established a series of general but rigid categories of expecta tion and behavior, and posed the fundamental problem that must be resolved. The long first episode (141-496) is composed of four scenes and a brief choral interlude.89 While the prologue and parodos had set forth the basic issues of the drama in general terms, in the first episode the focus is narrowed and the major emphasis is placed upon the character of Deianeira and the human dimensions of the drama. Like the prologue the first scene opens with a monologue by Deianeira in which she develops two themes from her initial speech in greater detail. The first of these is the unfortunate lot of women and how they are happy only before marriage (141-52, cf. 27-30). In this passage she stresses, as she has throughout the prologue, the anxiety of both her particular sit uation and the institution of marriage itself.90 The emphasis on her personal lot in the first part of the speech is balanced by the stress on Heracles in the second (153-77), an alternation that echoes the movement of the parodos. Here also elements from the prologue are developed in much more explicit detail. A sense of the urgency of the immediate situation is created by the specific references to Heracles' instructions to Deianeira should he not return within a specific time, and these wishes are directly correlated with the oracle from Dodona that his present labor is to be his final one. The speech concludes with Deianeira balancing her realization that now indeed is the time when all these prophecies are to come due with a strong expression of her apprehension that she is to be bereft of 'the best man of all' (177). When the speech is con sidered as a whole, we can see that Sophocles has balanced her private concerns against her apprehension for her husband in a manner that develops in a very explicit fashion the apprehensions she had voiced in the prologue.91 sexual terms, 'The Will of the Beast: Sexual Imagery in the Trachiniae/ Ramus 3 (1974) 1-17, 6-8. 89 On the structure of the episode see Kirkwood (n. 59) 90; I do not concur with the view (cf. . Reinhardt, Sophokles3 [Frankfurt am Main 1947] 49-50) that the lyrics of 205-24 should be regarded as equivalent to a stasimon and consequently that 141-496 be divided into two episodes. 90 As Adams (n. 78) 115, and others have observed, the forceful, generic way she speaks of the institution in light of only her own experience is striking. The intense language of the passage parallels the play's opening, where Deianeira removed herself from the general norms of human expectation, and underscores the distinct sexual overtones of her speech (cf. Wender [ . 88] 8). The thrust of the garden motif parallels the references to the inviolate meadow metaphor in Euripides' Hippolytus (cf. G. Segal, 'The Tragedy of the Hippolytus: The Waters of Ocean and the Untouched Meadow,' HSCP 70 [1965] 117-69). 91 The intensity with which Deianeira describes toil as a basic condition of Heracles' existence (cf. 169-70) not only prepares for her closing description of him as the 'best of men' but also parallels the way she characterized her own lot in the first part of the speech; in both instances Deianeira sets both her husband and herself apart from normal standards.</page><page sequence="36">36 TRADITIO Following a brief speech by the Chorus that sets her address off in greater relief, Deianeira's doubts are answered by the ecstatic arrival of the Messenger with his news that Heracles is about to return. The shift in mood between these two vignettes both underscores the negative cast of Deianeira's mood before and then mirrors the theme of the ebb and flow of human affairs in the move ment of the drama itself. The Messenger's initial lines offer a glowing de scription of Heracles as a triumphant victor.92 The dialogue between the pair proceeds in a very logical manner. The Messenger's description of both his own expectations and the scene in the meadow is marked by a naturalness of thought and expression, and as Deianeira questions the Messenger her mood gradually but convincingly changes from one of fear to joy.93 The note of triumph and happy expectation engendered by this scene is epitomized in the brief song of the Chorus, where in Bacchic frenzy they invoke Apollo, Artemis, and her attendant nymphs in joy for the apparent success of the royal couple.94 Their earlier positive counsel to Deianeira now seems fully justified, and the ode concludes with a proud affirmation of the propriety of their conviction (221-24) :95 9 a a ? e \ a a , a ' a a ? e a ea ' e a . 92 The skillful manner in which Sophocles incorporates the highly traditional view of Heracles as a triumpant warrior (cf. the Nekyia and Hesiodic Shield) is especially adroit; the effect is heightened by the way in which the Chorus' subsequent brief song parallels the tone and spirit of an epinician ode. 93 Critics who voice dismay at the venality of the Messenger (cf. 190-91) neglect the fact that this is a common characteristic of this class or type of character on the Attic stage; see C. Garton, 'Characterisation in Greek Tragedy,' JHS 77 (1957) 247-54. Lloyd-Jones' proposal (n. 84) 94, that the intensity of Deianeira's anxiety is indicated by the fact that she intends the a of 192 to refer to Heracles while the Messenger understands it to refer to Heracles is very attractive on dramatic as well as linguistic grounds. The theme of hope and its relationship to the motif of mutability in the play has been studied in considerable detail by M. C. Hoppin, 'The Theme of Mutability and Dramatic Unity in Four Plays of Sophocles' (diss., University of Michigan 1976), who feels that Deianeira fails to display a positive hope while Heracles is characterized by over-confidence. 94 The brisk iambic movement of the choral interlude has been well analyzed by H. A. Pohlsander, Metrical Studies in the Lyrics of Sophocles (Leiden 1964) 134-36, and there can be little doubt that Sophocles chose this rhythm both to reflect the Chorus' mood and to echo the theme of ebb and flow from the parodos. This last point may help explain the motion described in 219-20, which has puzzled the commentators; Lloyd-Jones' analysis (n. 86) 264-65, which introduces the notion of a ship being driven backward by the weather, is very attractive. 95 Text and colometry are those of Pearson. The irony of the invocation of Apollo as Healer in light of Heracles' subsequent fate is paralleled by the emphasis on the ambiguous e (207) at the start of the interlude.</page><page sequence="37">*trachiniae' 37 The mood of exultation continues with the entrance of Lichas and his train of captive women in the next scene. The audience learns in greater detail that Heracles is alive and well and currently engaged in setting out a precinct for an appropriate sacrifice to Zeus following his successful capture of Oecha lia.96 The manner in which this triumphant note is combined with Deianeira's initial expression of her compassion for the captive maidens (cf. 240-45) is both a hint of the Queen's coming quandary and a suggestive commentary on the harsh nature of heroic enterprise.97 After Deianeira queries Lichas if the siege was the reason for Heracles' long delay, Lichas responds with a long narrative of the hero's adventures (248-90). When assessed against the sub sequent action of this drama, Lichas' account is puzzling from a number of perspectives, and critics have been quite concerned about both the nature and extent of Lichas' prevarication and the sincerity of his later recantation (472 89). I believe that the concentration on this issue has tended to obscure a much more significant element, for the irony of the speech stems not from what is or is not said but the manner in which Heracles is presented. On one level the speech is a simple, direct, however selective, narrative of events; on another it poses the broader question how heroic standards of conduct are to be recon ciled with normal human ones. In this way it mirrors not only the problematic nature of Heracles' and Deianeira's relationship but also the action of the play as a whole. The speech is similar to Deianeira's opening statement in the epi sode in that, while the audience does not learn much that is new, details about the situation are added that give it greater substance. We hear first of Hera cles' subjugation to Omphale and his resentment at Eurytus' role in these events (248-57) ;98 there follows an extended account of the source of Hera cles' quarrel with Eurytus, the death of Iphitus, and Zeus' punishment of Heracles for having acted in guile, before Lichas announces the final result and proudly displays the captive maidens. The speech, however, concludes not on this note but rather with Lichas reiterating that the reason for Hera cles' delay is his need to make proper sacrifices of thanksgiving before his return. 96 On the interplay of this motif with the theme of marriage see Segal's 'Mariage et sacri fice . . .' ( . 83); the author believes that the former is the center of the irony for Deianeira and the latter for Heracles. 97 Webster (n. 87; cf. Stoessel [n. 83] 168-71) offered some very suggestive comments on the parallels and contrasts between the sequence of scenes that begins at this point and the Agamemnon. When the evidence is considered as a whole, I think there can be no doubt that Sophocles composed this scene with Aeschylus' play and characters in mind. 98 As noted before (supra, n. 30), the story of Heracles' subjugation to Omphale was ap parently quite old (cf. Farnell [n. 3] 140-41) and, as Easterling observes (n. 82) 61, the notion of enslavement it suggests is developed to a remarkable degree throughout the speech. The effect of this motif is in turn heightened by the manner in which Sophocles leaves it undefined at this juncture.</page><page sequence="38">38 TRADITIO Although Zeus' role is noted (250-51, 274-80), the events themselves and Heracles' motivation are presented in very human, if not petty, terms." The tale Lichas tells is not a pretty one, and, as many critics have noted, Heracles' acts seem much more worthy of reproach than triumphant praise.100 Although, as his admissions at the close of the episode make clear, Lichas' disingenuousness is both personally and dramatically effective, it points out the problematic nature of heroic conduct in very explicit terms. For what the poet has done is to translate, in the literal sense of the term, an account of heroic attitudes and deeds into simple human terms, and in the process the irony and difficulty of reconciling heroic conduct with normal standards of human behavior becomes apparent.101 We are reminded of the importance of the latter in the remainder of the scene between Lichas and Deianeira. Her initial response is not one of exultant joy but cautious restraint. As she contemplates the fate of the captives before her, Deianeira is well aware of the ebb and flow of human affairs and speaks with convincing compassion about their now wretched lot (293-306).102 The manner 99 The description of Zeus as a (251) was not intended, nor would the audience have understood it as in any way diminishing Heracles' personal responsibility. In certain respects Heracles' position parallels that of Agamemnon in the Oresteia, with the very important difference that Heracles is not caught in a direct conflict between his public and private interests (see K. J. Dover's response, 'Some Neglected Aspects of Agamemnon's Dilemma,' JHS 93 [1973] 58-69, to A. Lesky, 'Decision and Responsibility in the Tragedy of Aeschylus,' JHS 86 [1966] 78-85). Although Sophocles makes us aware of both dimensions of Heracles, the manner in which they are construed and presented in Lichas' speech stresses their paral lelism. 100 Galinsky (n. 26) 47 stresses the parallels to the narrative of Iphitus' death in Od. 21 and believes 'Sophocles has accomplished the seemingly impossible by outdoing Homer in incriminating Herakles, ' who acts 'with the logic of a brute. ' For Kitto, cf. Poiesis (n. 80) 177, the speech illustrates Heracles' ? and explains why Zeus punishes him. G. Murray, 'Heracles, "The Best of Men,"' Greek Studies (Oxford 1946) 106-26, contrasts the portrait of Heracles in the Trachiniae with Euripides' Heracles Furens and believes Sophocles' hero is shown as brutalized. To Murray, Lichas' speech is Sophocles' way of demonstrating the savagery and brutality of the traditional heroic standards (113, 117). 101 Dickerson (n. 83) 215-21 argues in considerable detail that deliberate deception and a 'calculated whitewash' of Heracles' behavior is Lichas' intent from start to finish; see also U. Parlavantza-Friedrich, T?uschungsszenen in den Trag?dien des Sophokles, Untersuchungen zur antiken Literatur und Geschichte 2 (Berlin 1969), 26-29. 102 Deianeira's emphasis on slavery not only makes explicit the importance of this motif which had been latent in Lichas' speech (supra, n. 98) but also heightens the dramatic effect of the scene. The tension of the scene is indicated by the irony of 302-6 and Deianeira's own ambivalence; see G. Markantonatos, 'Tragic Irony in the Trachiniae of Sophocles,' Platon 26 (1974) 73-79, 74. On the structure and form of the speech as a whole see H. F. Johansen, General Reflections in Tragic Rhesis (Copenhagen 1959) 66-67. See also Paley's (n. 27) brief but telling remarks (202) on the important role and emphasis placed upon the descriptive narrative in the drama. Deianeira's use of a ^ in 297 to suggest how easily</page><page sequence="39">4 TRACHINIAE ' 39 in which she then turns to the mute Iole and queries Lichas about her identity is a brilliant stroke of dramaturgy.103 Ignorant of the maiden's true role, Deianeira displays a sensitivity to her lot that reveals in full measure both her ignorance and compassion. The change in Lichas* manner at this point is striking. Matters which before had been passed over in silence now become the subject of direct prevarication, and the author of the eloquent account of Hera cles' adventures becomes quite reticent and abrupt. The scene closes with a pair of speeches that encapsulate the dramatic tension of the play at this point, as Lichas attempts to explain his silence in terms of Iole's own and Deianeira in turn demonstrates the warmth of her nature once more by stating that the maiden will have no additional grief on her account (330-31). The next two scenes are closely related to one another, and in them the action of the play takes a much more personal slant as Deianeira learns of Iole's true role. In the first, following a crisp dialogue in which Lichas' disingenuous ness is quickly revealed, the Messenger launches into a very pointed account of Heracles' true motivation behind the sack of Oechalia (351-74). Without the slightest hesitation he announces in very specific, forceful terms that the basic drive behind Heracles was neither the servitude to Omphale nor the death of Iphitus but rather his love for Iole (351-58).104 After the Messenger recasts the human affairs are contravened by the divine is closely paralleled by Euripides in the Hippo lyts; see B. M. W. Knox, 'The Hippolytus of Euripides/ YCS 13 (1952) 1-31, 25-26. 103 An excellent discussion of the first part of the drama and the strong possibility that the confrontation between Deianeira and Iole is an innovation on Sophocles' part is offered by A. Beck, 'Die Empfang Ioles,' Hermes 81 (1953) 10-21. 104 It is at this point that the theme of Eros which had been latent before becomes quite explicit in the Messenger's very forthright statement. One of the most signal advances of contemporary scholarship has been its open acceptance of the importance of this theme both in its own right and in relation to such other important motifs as disease or the realm of the primal or monstrous. Very frequently, in fact, contemporary studies which stress the im portance of the primal (supra, n. 83) do so in terms of the theme of Eros. We have moved beyond G. R. Post's reluctant acceptance that the chief motif of the drama might be erotic ('The Dramatic Art of Sophocles,' HSCP 23 [1912] 71-127, 97) to such studies as those of Easterling (n. 82) and Wender ( . 88), which interpret the drama in terms of this motif. In his studies (supra, n. 83) Segal stresses the parallels between the power of Eros and the dark forces that annul human civilization, and Murray (n. 100) sees in the motif an index of Hera cles' savagery. In addition to the studies noted before, see: P. Biggs, 'The Disease Theme in Sophocles' Ajax, Philoctetes and Trachiniae,' CP 61 (1966) 223-35, H. A. Mason, 'The Women of Trachis,' I, Arion 2.1 (1963) 59-81, II, Arion 2.2 (1963) 105-21, H. W. van Pesch, De idee van de mensel?jke beperktheid bif Sophocles (Wageningen 1953) 52-62, . Weinstock, So phokles3 (Wuppertal 1948). Biggs and van Pesch concentrate on love as a disease in a manner that offers useful supplements to Easterling's and Wender's studies. Mason believes that the action takes place against a background of primitive lust and that Sophocles has construed the myth to show that sexual desires are an alien intrusion into the soul. This emphasis on the harsher aspects of love parallels M?autis' view (n. 83) 266, that Heracles is corrupted by love, and Ronnet's denunciations (n. 1), 96, of the hero's brutality, ? , and lubricity.</page><page sequence="40">40 TRADITIO remainder of the events in light of this revelation, Deianeira's reply reveals the highly personal way in which she regards Iole's presence and youth as a threat (375-79),105 and the subsequent dialogue among Deianeira, the Chorus, and the Messenger reveals the depth and intensity of her shock in a very efficient manner. The final scene of the episode begins with the reappearance of Lichas from the palace, and the haste with which he wishes to leave both echoes the discomfiture he displayed when first queried about Iole's identity and underscores the ser iousness of the immediate situation itself. The inquisition of Lichas by the Messenger is conducted in a very forceful manner; Heracles' motivation and Iole's identity and role are quickly established.106 The magnanimity Deianeira displays in her response (436-69) both warrants and explains the praise that has been accorded her by the critics. She speaks not out of a sense of personal pique but in general terms that recognize the effect and force of love in human affairs. She blames neither Heracles nor Iole, but rather sees the former as a victim of disease and the latter of circumstances far beyond her control.107 Her plea for candor, however, does not succeed until she assures Lichas that such events have happened before and she bears no resentment to the pair.108 Lichas' Weinstock in his chapter on the drama sees in the pairing of Heracles and Deianeira a general contrast between fundamental masculine and feminine principles. Weinstock Stesses the positive dimension of love (and especially Deianeira's) and emphasizes the manner in which the Queen inadvertently destroys her husband (cf. Kirkwood [n. 59] 256). 105 por reasons of sense as well as grammar, 379 should be assigned to Deianeira and not the Messenger; see Kamerbeek and Longo (n.79) ad loc. 106 Tjrig scene offers an excellent example of the manner in which Attic drama was influ enced by the courts. The cross-examination of Lichas by the Messenger proceeds very directly not only to establish the facts of the immediate situation, but also to demonstrate how they are part of a larger sequence of events; see Walcot's excellent comments on the scene (n. 76) 38-39. The question of Deianeira's reticence at this point has disturbed many critics and, since this analysis concentrates on the dramatic rhythm, I have reserved discussion of the issue until my Appendix, Deianeira's Deportment 393-435, in which I explain why I believe it is dramatically and personally appropriate that she is silent at this point. 107 Biggs (n. 104) 227-31, Easterling (n. 82) 62-63, and Wender ( . 88) 9-10, all stress the manner in which the themes of Eros and disease are associated at this point. With varying degrees of emphasis all three critics see in this collocation of motifs the poet's censure of Heracles. 108 Considerable energy has been expended on the question whether Deianeira is Ce.g., Reinhardt [ . 89] 54-57) or is not (e.g., Bowra [n. 78] 124) dissembling at this point. A thor ough discussion of the issues is provided by Dickerson (n. 83) Excursus 18, 523-24. See also Beck (n. 103) 19-21, Mason (n. 104) Pt. II, 113-15, and Whitman (n. 2) 111-12. I believe that Deianeira is speaking with utmost sincerity even if she does overrate her ability to be detached about the situation (cf. Jebb [n. 79], xxiv-xxv). Her behavior at this juncture becomes much more comprehensible if we bear in mind that she is Heracles' queen as well as wife, and is trying to act accordingly (supra, n. 106 and infra, Appendix). In attempting to carry out her regal role Deianeira demonstrates many of the same traditional aristocratic</page><page sequence="41">' TRA CHIN IAE ' 41 reply (472-89) reiterates once more that it was because of Iole Oechalia was overthrown and he closes by asserting that his equivocations had been prompted by his concern for both Iole and Deianeira because of the way in which Hera cles had been mastered by love.109 The long first episode concludes with Deia neira signaling her accord and bidding Lichas to wait until she can find a suitable gift for Heracles in return. The episode is a complex one in which the natural progression of the scenes veils a very carefully orchestrated sequence of action and response. The primary function of the episode is to develop the human dimension of the drama. Critics have responded to Deianeira's humanity with great zeal, but, in my opinion, they have not stressed how this quality is so very characteristic of the episode as a whole. Motivations, actions, and responses are consistently expressed in very human terms. Even when * extra-human ' elements, such as Heracles' heroic behavior or the power of Eros, are brought to the fore, their effect is seen primarily in terms of the human costs involved. Although Lichas' initial report had set Heracles' acts in the context of a very complex series of events and had posed the question of the difficulty of reconciling human and heroic standards of behavior, the broader aspects of the situation are sub ordinated to the human dimensions of the situation as the episode proceeds. The same is true of the way in which the theme of Eros is developed; for, al though the characters are aware of its superhuman power, its effects and costs are viewed primarily in very human terms. attitudes and patterns of behavior as Phaedra in the Hippolytus (see Knox [n. 102] 17-18). Deianeira's aristocratic bent is demonstrated by her respect for e a (cf. 492-96), her sense of a , the very Homeric conviction that words must be the same as deeds, and her belief that birth and status are important determinants of her behavior. To a marked degree Deianeira displays that sense of a Wilamowitz (n. 33) considered to be a major charac teristic of the temper of the Homeric heroes and alien to Heracles' own behavior. Not in frequently commentators have drawn analogies between Deianeira and Homeric heroines; both M?autis ?n. 83) 255, 257, and R. Bernard-Moulin, L'El?ment hom?rique chez les per sonnages de Sophocle (Aix-en-Provence 1966) 114-16, develop in a very suggestive manner the analogies and contrasts between her position and Helen's. I believe that it is the failure to recognize the Homeric qualities of Deianeira's behavior that has prompted considerable misapprehensions about her motives in this and the following scene. Discussion of these issues has frequently involved the question of Deianeira's and responses have been quite varied, ranging from Adam's conviction (n. 79) 109, that Deianeira is an embodi ment of it, and Reinhardt's telling remarks (n. 89) 57-58, on how she falls because of her desire to practice , to H. North's description, Sophrosyne (Ithaca 1966) 61-62, of how the contrast between Heracles and Deianeira extends to their concepts of . 109 The collocation of themes and contrast between the normally triumphant Heracles and his current subjugation to Eros at the close of Lichas' speech (488-89) offers an elegant apprai sal of Heracles' situation. It is balanced by Deianeira's assessment of her own lot at the start of her speech (490-92) to provide a convenient epitome of the action up to this point.</page><page sequence="42">42 TRADITIO This emphasis sets the first stasimon off in stark relief, for the ode dwells not on the immediate situation but the power of Eros in the abstract. In terms of role, function, and structure it complements the first episode in much the same way as the parodos had done the prologue.110 The strophe begins with a very striking portrait of the Cyprian goddess as a victor which is parallel to the references to Heracles earlier in the play and reminiscent of the use of Heracles as a paradigm of athletic and martial powers in lyric poetry and the epinician odes of Pindar. The use of praeteritio to describe her conquests of Zeus, Hades, and Poseidon reinforces this effect before the Chorus turns to the description of the contest between Heracles and Acheloiis at the close of the strophe. This vignette reflects the same attitude of wonder and bewilderment as Deianeira's initial description in the prologue (503-6; cf. 9-27). Its effect, however, is much more intense and conveys an atmosphere of primal rather than human forces at play. This spirit is intensified in the antistrophe with its description of the combatants entering the fray; both are described in heroic terms with equal energy and paralleled grammatically in a manner that sug gests that there is little real difference between the pair.111 The lines with which the antistrophe conclude return to the theme of the opening of the stasimon and offer a graphic demonstration of the power of love (514-16): o? ' a e a e e e ? a ' e e e a? e a. The ambiguity between the two combatants suggested in the antistrophe is de veloped in the narrative of their actual encounter in the epode, and the con trast between these primal beings and Deianeira is brought out by the striking 110 On the metrical affinities of the first stasimon with the parodos see Kamerbeek ( . 79) 117, and Pohlsander ( . 94) 136-38. As Gellie ( . 83) observes, the stasimon 'is a superb example of the way in which an ode can distill the essence of the scene just completed, and at the same time prepare our r?ponses for the scene to come' (63). The manner in which Sophocles recasts the present situation in light of the motif with which the play opened, Deianeira's marriage, is an especially adroit turn which reinforces the sense of unit construc tion in the drama so far. 111 Not surprisingly the violence and intensity of the scene has prompted many critics to see in it a harsh criticism of Heracles by the poet. For example, Murray (n. 100) in the con text of his remarks on the ode described Deianeira as 'the gentle and bewildered prize, fought for by monstrous creatures mad with lust' (115, cf. 116-17), and critics who have seen the power of Eros in negative terms have frequently cited the passage as confirmation of their views. But, while there can be no doubt that the poet wants us to be aware of the primal qualities of Eros and the combatants, and to reconstrue Deianeira's initial account of her wooing in these terms, the idea of a heroic combat or contest is equally strong; note the manner with which the strophe ends with the prhase ae ' a (506), the antistrophe with a vignette of Aphrodite as a judge (516), and the epode concludes with the image of Deianeira as a prize heifer (527-30).</page><page sequence="43">' TRAGHINIAE ' 43 vignettes of the latter first awaiting the outcome (523-25) and then as a heifer being separated from her mother (529-30).112 As noted before (supra, n. 110), this last image not only echoes the close of the strophe but also the images of Cypris as a judge at the antistrophe's end, and, just as it is hard to distinguish between the two combatants, so also Sophocles parallels the object and the instigator of their passion. But, at the same time he suggests their similarity, he also establishes a basic contrast as well. Cypris is seen as an active force who seems to enjoy her role and considers the combat as another proof of her sway, while the description of Deianeira watching the fray and the lines with which the epode conclude amplify the sense of Deianeira's distance and appre hension. The poet conveys a real sense of her frailty and terror, whatever the outcome, which stands in sharp relief to the eager expectation suggested on Aphrodite's part. The closing image of Deianeira as a heifer separated from her mother is a significant one for the reminder it offers of Deianeira's char acter and for the way in which it suggests the tension between human and more than human forces that is so characteristic of the play as a whole. The same effect is generated by the position of the ode itself. Set between the two episodes in which the human dimensions of the drama are most prominent, the first stasimon points in no uncertain terms to forces that are both beyond human control and ken and which by their very nature pay little regard to ordinary sensibilities. The ode also extends our understanding of Heracles. The initial references to his combat with the river god and Lichas' narrative of his exploits had suggested that he bore some resemblance to these harsher powers, and this impression is confirmed by the ode. So it is that, by construc ting the ode and placing it where he did, the dramatist has pointed to the dis tance that separates Heracles and Deianeira and consequently the difficulty for the latter to make an appropriate response to the situation with which she has been confronted. Although in the second episode the primary emphasis is on the human di mensions of the drama once more, the manner in which primal forces impinge upon human affairs becomes quite clear.113 The tension between the two sets of parameters is very obvious in the structure and content of the long speech by Deianeira with which this scene, like the prologue and the first episode, begins (531-87). Her tone at the outset is quite different from what she had displayed before. Up to this point she had mainly been seen as an individual who responded to others; now, however, she displays an initiative on her own 112 As the commentaries of Jebb, Kamerbeek, and Longo ( . 79) reveal, the text of 526 has occasioned considerable discussion; I concur with Kamerbeek's defense of the received text. 113 Kamerbeek's introductory remarks on the episode (n. 79) 125, offer a convenient pr?cis on the manner in which it is linked to what precedes and follows.</page><page sequence="44">44 TRADITIO account that had not been conspicuous before. The opening of her speech re veals the intensity of her sentiments. Deianeira speaks now not in quasi-abstract terms as she had at the close of the last episode but in highly personal terms which amplify her sentiments of 375-79. The speech begins with a very strong expression of her resolve to act and her pique at Iole, whom she now views not as an innocent victim of circumstances but direct competition.114 Deia neira's sense of her own position is brilliantly expressed in the balance between the image of the pair of them awaiting Heracles under a single coverlet and the description of this prospect as a proper return for her fidelity.115 She character izes Heracles' weakness as a disease (cf. 543-44) in very explicit terms, but then, instead of developing this theme in the abstract, pointedly reiterates her apprehension at being supplanted by a younger rival in very explicit terms (550-51): a ' ? a , a e a e a a , e a 9 a . The second part of the speech, with its very direct references to the realm of the monstrous and primal, stands in sharp contrast to the first part. Deianeira's initial description of her proposed remedy (555-56) as a a a a , ? a e , sets the tone of the subsequent narrative of her meeting with the Centaur Nessus, his attempted assault, and her rescue by Heracles.116 Both the char 114 The bitter irony of 536-37, with its tension between and e e e at the start and close of 536, and secretive connotations of a e e a at the start of the next line, is intensified by reference to Iole as 'extra baggage* ( e a , 537). The same metaphor is found in Clytemnaestra's parallel denunciation of Cassandra in the Agamemnon (1438-44), and possibly Sophocles intended to echo this very striking passage with its very explicit sexual overtones; see Longo's comments (n. 79) on 537-38, Fraenkel's remarks on the passage in the Agamemnon and my 'Agamemnon 1446-47/ CP 67 (1972) 191-92. lis Tne irony of 540-42 is intensified by the manner in which the description of Heracles echoes the close of Deianeira's anxious speech (176-77) before the Messenger arrived, and the use of a (cf. Jebb and Kamerbeek [ . 79] ad 542) suggests the motif of e a and how Deianeira sees Heracles' conduct as a fundamental breach of this series of conventions. See also Easterling's sharp appraisal (n. 82) 62-63, of Deianeira's conduct at this point. 116 I concur with the basic points of Kirk's assessment of centaurs as creatures whose ambivalence of form and behavior reflects the tension between nature and culture in Greek culture (cf. his Myth [n. 29] 152-62). While centaurs are among the oldest inhabitants of Greek mythology and there are some conspicuous parallels in Indian mythology, there is no need to trace them back to earlier Indo-European or Aryan figures (cf. C. Dum?zil, Le pro bl?me des centaures [Paris 1929]). There is virtually complete agreement that centaurs were originally nature or fertility spirits (cf. Nilsson, G.gr.R* [n. 3] 229-32) whose ambivalence of conduct was already well established by Homer. In this respect they are paralleled by Hera cles, and I share Kirk's view (162) that Heracles was an ideal heroic counterpart. In the</page><page sequence="45">' TRAGHINIAE ' 45 acters and the language Sophocles employs to describe the encounter are quite different from those at the start of the speech. The milieu depicted in this highly graphic vignette seems quite removed from ordinary human sensibilities and much more akin to the atmosphere and milieu of the first stasimon. Her language is highly reminiscent of her descriptions of the encounter with Achel oiis, and by constructing this parallel, the poet seems to suggest that the only real contact between Heracles and Deianeira has come about through such encounters on a primal level. The poet also stresses how they have re sponded in such different ways; for Deianeira these occasions have been ones of terror and brutal assault, and for Heracles opportunities for display of heroic excellence and mastery over barbaric forces. The contrast between the two encounters is also indicative of the manner in which the situation has intensified from the start of the drama. Deianeira is now not just a passive spectator but a participant and victim of Nessus' assault who now tragically heeds the dying Centaur's advice that his blood will offer a charm to prevent Heracles from ever loving another woman (572-77).117 The manner in which the speech closes (581 87) sets her purpose forth in clear relief. Deianeira explicitly disavows hostile intent (582-83; cf. 543-44); by her use of the philtre she wants only to prevail over her youthful rival and act as wisely as the circumstances allow.118 Con Trachiniae, even though Sophocles apparently did not follow the most negative traditions (cf. Dugas [n. 83], Dickerson [n. 83] 6-86), the centaur Nessus is consistently regarded in a hostile vein with a strong emphasis on his bestiality and secretiveness (cf. 555-56). Sorum (n. 59) 18-20, and Segal, 'Mariage et sacrifice . . .' ( . 83) 45, both stress Nessus as the center of the figures that threaten to annul civilized life, and Segal's emphasis on the sexual qualities of the philtre has been paralleled by those writers who stress the role of Eros in the drama. Although clouded by her strong belief that Heracles is a vegetation deity of Oriental origin, and that in the Trachiniae '. . . Sophocles has bequeathed us the life history of Herakles as Greek spirit of vegetation and seasonal birth and decay' (43), Levy (n. 27) has raised the interesting possibility that originally the stories of Heracles' combats with Achelo?s and Nessus were doublets of one account of a combat with a water demon. But, while Sophocles does a great deal to develop the parallels between the two events in the Trachiniae, I believe that he was prompted much more by the immediate realities and dramaturgical possibilities of the situation he was constructing than by any recognition of archetypal similarities. 117 The text of 572-74 has been much debated, and I concur with A. A. Long's view, 'Poison ous "Growth" in the Trachiniae/ GRBS 8 (1967) 275-78 that the phrase a e a a a refers to the Hydra's poison and not the Hydra itself. Segal, 'The Hydra's Nursling' (n. 83), develops the implications of this passage in a most suggestive manner. 118 The content and tone of the speech have occasioned considerable criticism of Deianeira. For example, Bowra (n. 78) 127-29, chides the Queen for both resenting the introduction of a concubine and her use of magic (cf. Post [n. 104] 102-3 and Ehrenberg's sharp censure of the Queen's conventional, if not bourgeois, behavior [n. 77] 149-51). On the first charge see the very proper objections of Whitman (n. 2) 114-15, Kamerbeek ( . 79) ad 582, and Gellie ( . 83) 64-66. Whitman and Gellie also address the question of Deianeira's use of magic in a convincing manner and point out that her fault, if such it should be termed, is not that she uses magic but rather that she believes she can handle these primal forces on their own terms</page><page sequence="46">46 TRADITIO sidered as a whole, the speech is an eloquent one in which the personal di mensions of Deianeira's predicament stand out in stark relief against a threatening background which includes not only the personal threat posed by Iole but also her own involvement with the Centaur. To a certain extent the scene also reverses the movement of the last episode, where deception preceded clarification: here, initially, Deianeira believes in the integrity of her own and the Centaur's intent and only later will she discover the beast's deceit. Tragi cally, despite the sense of distance she reflected in her descriptions of her en counters with Achelo?s and Nessus and the manner in which these narratives suggested that real, substantial contact between Heracles and Deianeira has not come on human terms but only as the result of brutal conflict, the Queen assumes that in this instance the realms of human and primal experience can work together to her advantage.119 In the subsequent scene with Lichas the action continues on a human plane. Lichas' impatience to depart (598-99) not only echoes his anxiety before his prevarications were revealed but also offers a subtle, but pointed, reminder of the urgency of the present situation that had been stressed in the prologue and initial scenes. It also helps emphasize the importance of Deianeira's instructions for Heracles' wearing of the robe (cf. 604-13). Not infrequently critics have wondered whether or not Deianeira's intent is hostile or deceptive.120 I believe that when her speech is regarded in terms of the dramatic rhythm of the play as a whole it may be regarded as ominous but not hostile. There seems to be little reason to doubt the sincerity of her closing speech where she bids Lichas not to speak of her devotion before she knows if it is reciprocated by her husband (630-32). Her instructions, in fact, are dominated by apprehension on this point, as can be seen by the manner in which she stresses that the robe is her own work and not that of others (602-3) and her friendly reception of Iole (627-28).121 (see Markantonatos [ . 102] 76, on the irony of 580-83). Other critics have questioned Dei aneira's resolve even at this juncture; for example, M. McCall, 'The Trachiniae: Structure, Focus, and Heracles,' AJP 93 (1972) 142-63, 150-51, detects a strong note of vacillation in the manner in which she sends the robe, and believes that the final lines of her speech epito mize the basic hesitancy of her character. Although his remarks should be tempered (see Kamerbeek [ . 79] ad 586, 587, on the use of tenses), McCall is quite correct in his belief that Deianeira lacks the sense of raw authority and obduracy that characterizes Sophoclean heroes (155). This does not mean, however, that she lacks a sense of her own personal authority? for this last quality is very much in evidence in the subsequent scene with Lichas. 119 Deianeira's final lines before the entrance of Lichas (596-97) reveal her very strong and Homeric sense of propriety; n. 108 and Kamerbeek ( . 79) ad 596, 597. 120 por example, in her review of Parlavantza-Friedrich (n. 101), P. E. Easterling, CR 22 (1972) 19-21, finds it odd that Deianeira's deception of Lichas is not discussed. 121 Although the text of 602 is problematic (cf. Kamerbeek [ . 79] ad loc.), the emphasis on Deianeira's weaving intensifies the irony of the scene as a whole; from Homer on the activ ity was regarded as emblematic of both one of the most important feminine roles within the</page><page sequence="47">'traghiniae' 47 The ominous qualities of this scene stem not from Deianeira's intent?for her domestic concern does not depart from what we have seen before?but rather from what is not said and the manner in which her instructions are phrased. The latter are in the negative (cf. 606-7) and there are no references to Nessus, the combat with Heracles, and least of all the philtre. The episode marks not only a major turning point in the action of the drama but also a transition in the focus of the drama as elements drawn from a world of crude, primal experiences begin to supplant those based on normal experience as the major frame of reference. The relationship between these two spheres is set forth with conscious ambiguity, for at the same time their distance is delineated, their proximity has been developed as well. Nowhere is this more clearly established than in the way that Sophocles depicts how Deianeira's decision to use the Centaur's philtre stems from very natural, human reasons. The irony of the episode is underscored by the note of happy expectation sounded by the Chorus in the short second stasimon (633-62). The ode begins with an invocation to the inhabitants of the region to rejoice and continues in the antistrophe with a description of their joy at the safe return of Zeus' and Alcmene's child in triumph with all his prizes. Against this happy prospect the second strophe sets first a vignette of the wandering Heracles and then a poign ant image of Deianeira, before concluding by noting how the 'maddened Ares' ("A e , 653) has released her from toil.122 The final antistrophe opens with an ecstatic wish for Heracles' safe arrival once the sacrifice is com pleted and closes with the Chorus hoping that he will arrive filled with desire because of the robe's persuasion.123 The jutxaposition of these two elements underscores the irony of the ode as a whole, and, just as the first stasimon had expanded upon events from the first episode and anticipated elements of the second, so also this ode both reflects the ambiguity of the preceding scene and the dreadful gulf between Deianeira's intent and the results of her acts that will be revealed in the coming scenes. It is the latter tension that is brilliantly dramatized in the third episode of the play with its double focus first on Deianeira's apprehension and then on household and feminine guile. On the manner in which Sophocles uses the motif of the robe to link Heracles and Deianeira see SegaPs comments, 'Mariage et sacrifice . . . ' ( . 83) 36-39. 122 jne intense focus on Heracles and Deianeira, and the manner in which the phrasing poignantly suggests both their distance and proximity in a manner that is reminiscent of both the parodos and first stasimon, intensifies the sense of scale and imminence created in the first strophe. 123 Although the text of the close (660-62) is seriously flawed (cf. Jebb, Kamerbeek, and Longo [ . 79] ad loc.), some form of reference to Heracles' desire being kindled by the robe does appear to be present. The sentiment is a clear echo of Deianeira's concerns at the close of the preceding episode and, together with the description with which the second strophe closes, anticipates Heracles' fate.</page><page sequence="48">48 TRADITIO Hyllus' graphic report of the robe's effect on Heracles.124 The note of exultation which characterized the second strophe is promptly undercut when Deianeira returns and immediately announces she may have gone too far (663-64). Following a brief dialogue with the Chorus in which both her mystification and concern become apparent, she launches into an account of the unexpected marvel that has just happened (672-722).125 The speech opens with a short, but graphic, description of the disintegration of the tuft of wool with which she had anointed the cloak of Heracles (674-78).126 With consummate skill Sophocles plays upon the traditional ambivalent response to centaurs as creatures of lust and teachers of man (supra, n. 116) when Deianeira signals the intensity of her concern by saying that she had followed the wounded Centaur's instructions as if they had been graven on bronze (683). In this account (680-92) there is a continuing balance of words suggesting light and dark which develops the contrast between human understanding and intent with the monstrous and its secret desires.127 This balance becomes even more explicit in the subsequent description of what happened to the tuft of wool as the light of the sun fell upon it. The vivid portrait of its decay and the clotted foam that emerged from the earth conjures up an atmosphere of horror which is heightened by Deianeira's growing recog nition of the Centaur's real intent. The manner in which Sophocles links her growing understanding and apprehension evokes a keen sense of man's limi tations when dealing with basic primal forces. The sense of the violent intrusion of this world into that of normal human expectations and behavior is as im portant as the motif of late and tragic knowledge so frequently stressed by the critics. Throughout the speech the dramatist develops a sense of these crude powers gradually becoming manifest, gaining momentum, and sweeping all before them. It is not on this note, however, that the speech concludes; instead we are very pointedly reminded of the human drama when Deianeira says she will die if Heracles has been injured by her acts. The sincerity of her resolve is underscored by the forceful manner in which she discounts the Chorus' pleas 124 See Dickerson's excellent comments on the structure of the episode (n. 83) 353-57, and how it is 'marked by a division into two segments of roughly equal extent and strikingly symmetrical pattern ' (353). As we shall see, the strong emphasis on symmetry in this scene in which Deianeira's misfortune becomes clear is in strong contrast to the linear presentation of the figure of Heracles. 125 Throughout the first part of the episode there is a strong emphasis on knowledge and action words, which underscores the discrepancy between her intent and the results, and demonstrates the reversal of her hopes. 126 The emphasis on the manner in which the tuft is consumed from within not only anti cipates the descriptions of the philtre's effect on Heracles but also mirrors the theme of how the disease of love within him brings about his destruction. 127 Holt (n. 78) 83-98, offers a number of sensitive observations on the light imagery of the drama and its use in the depiction of Deianeira; his remarks on the manner in which it is employed in the third episode to point to the certainty of Heracles' doom are especially adroit.</page><page sequence="49">'trachiniae' 49 first to hope for the best (723-26) and then their attempts to excuse her acts because of her positive intent (727-30).128 When Hyllus enters, the extravagance of his initial outburst (734-37) makes it clear that the worst has indeed happened; to Deianeria's initial query he bluntly responds that she has slain Heracles that day (739-40). Following a brief interchange in which Hyllus stresses once more the enormity of her act, he begins a long account (749-812) of the events of the sacrifice in which the dark power of the philtre suggested by Deianeira's account becomes manifest. These two speeches correspond to one another as fearful expectation and grim reality. Hyllus' speech begins with a narrative of Heracles' triumphal sacrifice on Cape Cenaeum, but the mood soon changes when he describes how the deadly poison begins to do its work in the light of the sacrifice.129 The description of the robe clinging ever more closely to his limbs like the work of a sculptor before the personified venom begins to devour him (763-71) offers a graphic illustration of the philtre's power.130 The vigorous language of this description is echoed by the account of Lichas' death and Heracles' agony in which we see the hero's private torment being given public expression in a series of violent acts (771-88).131 Hyllus' speech continues with an account of Heracles' collapse, his cursing of his marriage and pathetic plea to be taken away from the scene of his disaster, before Hyllus concludes with a brutal curse of his mother. In 128 There can be no doubt about the intensity of her resolve at this point, and critics have, with due propriety, pointed out the analogies with Ajax, Electra, and Oedipus. The lines with which the speech closes show how closely her sense of a is linked with her convictions about her personal responsibility. This last point is very important, since as R. D. Dawe, 'Some Reflections on Ate and Hamartia,' HSCP 72 (1967) 89-123, observed, Of all the Greek tragedies which survive, Women of Trachis is the only one where "error of judgment" appears an adequate diagnosis of the event or events which set in motion the great chains of catastrophe familiar to us from our reading of the tragic writers' (90). Dawe, however, also believes that Deianeira 'must be predestined, for she is fulfilling an oracle' (114). 129 I do not share the belief reflected in the work of Segal, 'Mariage et sacrifice . . . ' ( . 83) 37-41, and others that the sacrifice on Cape Cenaeum was somehow impure or sacrilegious because of the character of the events and Heracles' behavior which it celebrated. 130 Kamerbeek's remarks on the vivid language of the passage are very helpful (n. 79) ad loc.; see also Reinhardt's comparison and contrast of Heracles' and Philoctetes' sufferings (n. 89) 186-89. The image of the robe clinging to Heracles 'like a made by a sculptor' (Kamerbeek) is not only highly graphic but also offers a natural continuation of Deianeira's statement that she heeded the centaur's words as if graven on bronze (683) in the first half of the episode. 131 Although the description of Lichas' death has frequently been cited to demonstrate Heracles' continued misconduct, if not complete bestialization, I believe that the poet de picted the irony of Lichas' end in such a graphic fashion to point out both the intensity of Heracles' pain and how heroic standards and actions differ from normal ones. In this respect the account of Lichas' death offers a graphic demonstration of the tension that had been latent throughout Lichas' own narrative of Heracles' exploits.</page><page sequence="50">50 TRADITIO this final section (807-12) Hyllus equates her intent with the unforeseen results and prays that the Erinys and avenging Justice will exact an appropriate punishment from her since e e ? a ?a e , a a a a e e aa\ a e (810-12). The vigor of Hyllus' imprecation parallels the intensity of his narrative of the events on Cape Cenaeum, and the manner in which he judges Deianeira's intent by the results of her acts not only reflects a very characteristically Greek atti tude but also stands in stark contrast to the rationale behind her acts Deianeira had expressed in the second episode. When the progression between these two episodes is considered, two interrelated factors are of particular note: first the way in which the context of the drama's action is developed and gradually transformed and, secondly, the manner in which the very personal motivation of Deianeira has been proved insufficient. In a very skillful manner Sophocles has first expanded the parameters of the drama from its earlier concentration on the human situation to one where monstrous characters, behavior, and events have become more prominent and then shown how a response conceived on human terms to these forces is itself inadequate. Deianeira's attempt to manip ulate the primal has ended in a disaster both for herself and for the house of Heracles. The savage denunciations of her marriage first by Heracles and then by Hyllus have completely undercut her position. Deianeira, who before had apprehensively defined both herself and her acts in terms of her marriage, now finds herself denied in these very terms with the result that the very foundations of her being are destroyed. She has failed to preserve her a as well as be a proper wife and mother.132 Her silent withdrawal at this point is a brilliant stroke of dramaturgy. There is no way she can adequately respond to either the Chorus' plea to justify herself or Hyllus' unctuous sentiments that by her acts she has proved herself to be no true mother. Her silence not only stands in stark contrast to the episode's brilliant speeches and symmetry of action but also epitomizes her sense of personal failure more perfectly than any speech could ever do. Her silent exit at this point provides a perfect dramatic expression of the central theme of this episode, how man even with the best of intent cannot control the primal forces with which his life is intimately involved. The energy of Hyllus' description of Heracles' suffering is matched by the third stasimon (821-61), and although, as Kirkwood has observed, it has 'the 132 The fears reflected in her sentiments of 596-97 (supra, n. 106; cf. 108) have become true, and, like Phaedra in the Hippolytus, her a has become a ; see F.

Hipp. 380-388),' Hermes 101 (1973) 420-25.</page><page sequence="51">'trachiniae' 51 simple function of providing a lyrical commentary on the events of the play, '133 it fulfills this role with considerable verve. The first strophe begins with a strong statement that now all the prophecies are falling due. This motif had been prominent in the opening scenes of the play, where it had been employed to stress the urgency of the immediate situation of Deianeira. Now it is applied quite specifically to Heracles' fate as the Chorus recognizes the true meaning of the prophecy that after this labor Heracles will find rest (828-30; cf. Deianeira 164-68134). The antistrophe continues this train of thought and depicts Heracles as a victim of monstrous forces. The compact language of this description echoes and distills many of the earlier references to Nessus, the Hydra, and the philtre's effect, and together the strophe and antistrophe reveal how the prophecy and the realm of monstrous behavior have become imminent in the action of the drama itself. This effect is heightened when in the second strophe the Chorus turns to Deianeira and her acts and comments upon them as part of a larger pattern that finally has been revealed. The manner in which the Chorus balances the integrity of her intent against the insidious power of Nessus' counsels epitomizes the inability of human efforts to deal with, much less control, such basic forces. The inevitable result of such efforts is encapsu lated in the final gnomic lines of the strophe (850-51): a 1 e e a a a e a a e a a a a . The concluding antistrophe offers a vignette of Heracles that balances the strophe's emphasis on Deianeira. Here also the poet moves beyond the particu lar situation to the general causes for his downfall. The antistrophe opens with a description of Heracles' sickness as a greater than any brought about by a hostile foeman and closes with the following depiction of Aphrodite's role (860-61): a 1 a a a a e a ' e a a . There can be little doubt that these gnomic lines were intended to parallel the description of Deianeira's fate at the close of the strophe.135 In both sets of verses we see the principals and their acts set in a broader context, and Sophocles 133 Kirkwood ( . 59) 182; see also Letters' excellent comments, (n. 83) 184-85, on the manner in which the ode recasts Hyllus' 'physiological' account of Heracles' sufferings into terms that evoke a sense of the malignant and monstrous. 134 Although the text of 828-30 is troubled, the emphasis on three motifs that will be prom inent for the remainder of the drama, Heracles' toil, servitude, and relationship with Zeus, is clear. Verbal links with earlier sections of the drama are also maintained; see Kamerbeek ( . 79) ad 824-25, on the manner in which these lines possibly continue the figure of 31-33. 135 The importance of Aphrodite's role is brought out by the way in which the description of her as a echoes Lichas' description of Zeus' part in these events (251).</page><page sequence="52">52 TRADITIO employs the theme of love to suggest the parallelism of their lots as well as the tragic distance that separates them. The manner in which the themes of Hera cles' sickness and Cypris' power bracket references to his exploits and marriage intensifies the association of all these elements at this critical stage in the drama. For, although there is little 'new' in what the Chorus says, the third stasimon does convey an increased sense of perspective to what has transpired and so helps set the context for the remainder of the drama. Throughout the third stasimon the Chorus stresses Heracles' accomplishments from a variety of viewpoints, and their positive stance to his deeds echoes Deianeira's and Hyllus' earlier descriptions of him as the ' best of men. ' The greater emphasis on Heracles than Deianeira parallels the shift that is taking place in the movement of the drama as a whole as the playwright gradually shifts the primary focus from the figure of Deianeira to the ironies and ambiguities of Heracles' own career. The drama, however, does not turn directly to this question. Instead in the fourth episode we are returned to the human dimensions of the drama and learn of Deianeira's response to the events she has inadvertently brought about. Following the Chorus' anxious queries about the noise within the house,136 the Nurse returns, and in the elliptical but pregnant dialogue between the excited retainer and the Chorus the audience learns of the Queen's suicide. The lines with which the short kommos (879-96) conclude, e e e e e e &lt; &gt; e a a a a e a ' (894-96, Jebb) offer a poignant summary of Deianeira's fate. The audience is reminded of Iole's role by the forceful description of her as a a e a and the manner in which this phrase is placed between the others reflects how her presence is part of a much larger pattern of events.137 The Nurse's account of the actual suicide (899-946) with its stress upon the unlucky Queen's personal torment corresponds in no small manner to Hyllus' report of Heracles' suf ferings.138 But whereas in the latter the emphasis had been placed on the public 136 I concur with Kamerbeek's sentiment (n. 79) 189, that 863-70 should be considered as part of the fourth episode and not, as Jebb believed, an epode to the third stasimon. 137 The description of Iole as a new bride echoes Deianeira's sentiments in 536-51 as well as the Messenger's and Lichas' earlier revelations and the pregnant use of e in 206 (supra, n. 95). 138 The account of Deianeira's death has frequently been compared to the servant's narra tive in Euripides' Alcestis (152-98) and, as Kamerbeek ( . 79) observes, 'usually the priority of the Alcestis has been inferred from the comparison' (193-94). Discussions of temporal priority have often entailed evaluations of the relative merits of the two scenes, and Euripides is frequently given the nod; see Reinhardt ( . 89) 255-56 and M. L. Earle, 'Studies in Soph ocles' Trachiniae,' TAPA 33 (1902) 5-29. Such studies neglect the significant differences between the two scenes which are neatly delineated in Bowra's remarks (n. 78) 130, and the strong likelihood that Sophocles' drama antedates Euripides' (supra, n. 59).</page><page sequence="53">' TRAGHINIAE ' 53 setting and dimension of Heracles' acts, in the former there is a distinctly centripetal movement to the private dimensions of Deianeira's experience. We see, in effect, her personal response to Hyllus' accusations in the preceding episode. The initial theme that is developed is that of her isolation, which is epitomized in the vignette of her hiding from her son as he prepares the Utter for Heracles (cf. 900-3) and then amplified in the subsequent description of her frenetic movements through the house. In the initial section of the speech Sophocles conveys a profound sense of the way in which Deianeira now feels irrevocably separated from her house and family which before had defined her role and being.139 The next section (912-31) opens with an account of the Queen dashing into her bedroom and climbing onto her marriage bed. The Nurse's report of Deianeira's final words (920-22), e e a e e a, a e ', e e e ' e e a a a a ' e a a , epitomize the importance of the Queen's marriage to her; for, even though it had been a source of great anxiety, it was nevertheless the basic datum of her existence. The passage concludes with an account of the actual suicide, and the fact that she performs it with a sword may have been intended by the poet to suggest the ultimate incompatability of her very human perspective and Heracles' Ufe of heroic accomplishment. The narrative that follows (932 42) offers a graphic account of the youth's response as he realizes how Deianeira had been misled by 'the beast' (935). This pattern of action, discovery, and response on Hyllus' part parallels Deianeira in the second and third episodes and anticipates Heracles in the ?xodos. The gnomic close of the Nurse's speech (943-46) with its emphasis on the uncertainties of human life and knowledge echoes the opening of the play. We have moved full circle and Deianeira's excessive caution at the outset seems to have been fully confirmed by events. The episode conveys a profound sense of personal, human dimensions of the drama which is heightened by its placement in the dramatic sequence of the drama as a whole. For just as the first stasimon which developed a sense of Heracles' heroic qualities and their primal associations is set between the two episodes that develop the human dimensions of the drama, so also this very human scene is set between those that demonstrate Heracles' heroic qualities. 139 The expression a a a a . . . a in 911 has provoked considerable discussion (cf. Jebb, Kamerbeek, and Longo [ . 79] ad loc.)- I do not share Jebb's belief that the phrase is 'undoubtedly corrupt* or Kamerbeek's contention (see also Campbell, Paley [n. 27] ad loc.) that Deianeira now feels childless as well. Some sense of property is suggested by a even in the plural, and I believe Sophocles employs this striking phrase with its very Homeric collocation of family and property to point to the Queen's very traditional, aristocratic demeanor (supra, n. 108) even as she prepares to commit suicide.</page><page sequence="54">54 TRADITIO The manner in which the human and heroic perspectives are structurally interlocked within the fabric of the drama reflects the poet's desire to show how inextricably interwoven they are on a conceptual level as well. We are not presented with a sequence of scenes that deal first with the human and then the extra-human dimensions of the situation, but rather the two se quences are developed in counterpoint with one another. The effect of these shifts from one plane to another is intensified in turn by the manner in which the dramatist also alternates his emphasis on the general and specific di mensions of the situation both between and within individual scenes. In this way Sophocles intensifies the sense of both the parallelism and tragic distance among the various perspectives under which the action is conceived and presented. The dramatist directly underscores this quandary in the short fourth stasimon when in the first strophe the Chorus very explicitly queries whether Heracles' or Deianeira's fate is the more regrettable.140 The antistrophe develops this tension in the contrast between what has happened within the house and a e e e e e a (951).141 The note of apprehension with which the first antistrophe concludes is developed in the following strophe, where the Chorus wishes a wind would bear them away lest they collapse in terror at the sight of Heracles and his sufferings. The intensity of their sentiments is con tinued in the description of the approaching procession in the final antistrophe. Up to this point the primary focus has been on Deianeira, and Heracles has been presented as one of the basic parameters by which the action was guided rather than in his own right. Now are we about to be confronted with this figure himself. It is his presence that is to shape the remainder of the drama, and the anxiety with which the Chorus contemplates that prospect underscores the tension of the drama at this point. The ?xodos opens with a brief encounter between Hyllus and the Old Man in charge of Heracles' escort. Their use of anapaests coupled with the silent 140 T. F. Hoey, 'The Trachiniae and Unity of Hero/ Arethusa 3 (1970) 1-22, argues in a very suggestive manner from the Chorus' hesitation at this point that Sophocles did not intend us to regard either Heracles or Deianeira as the hero. For Hoey, 'The Trachiniae might be read as the tragedy of a house whose two essential components never meet' (18). For Hoey the drama is one about disunity, a union that was never achieved, even though Heracles and Deianeira were in need of each other (see also the pr?cis of his dissertation, 'Presentational Imagery in the Trachiniae of Sophocles,' HSCP 68 [1964] 417-19). In developing this thesis, Hoey stresses the importance of Hyllus' role and the symmetrical arrangement of scenes about his ode (cf. 15-16), and while Hoey's pattern may be slightly forced, his emphasis on Hyllus' role and importance is not. 141 Erturdt's e provides the necessary sense and solves the metrical problem; the MSS' e probably crept in from the connotations of e a and the e of the next line.</page><page sequence="55">'trachiniae' 55 figure of Heracles heightens the intensity of the scene and the audience's expectation.142 Heracles' first words are a combination of a query to his father Zeus about his location and an exclamation about the pain that is consuming him (983-87). These two factors ? Zeus and pain in all its forms ? are both the basic facts of Heracles' existence and the major themes of the ?xodos. When Heracles next speaks, he begins with a contrast between his present lot and the sacrifice he was making when afflicted (993-95).143 The imbalance between those two elements is intensified by the anguished queries that follow about where he is to find relief (1000-4). The phrasing of these lines reiterates the collocation of madness, disease, and magic from earlier in the play and applies it in very specific terms to his own situation. The manner in which Heracles personifies his disease at the outset of the subsequent kommos is exceptionally vivid.144 It is as if all the crude forces to whom both Deianeira and Hyllus had referred before have become unseen but nevertheless potent presences on the stage itself. The force of these lines makes Heracles' sub sequent expression of the irony of his lot all the more poignant (1010-14): a , , ' a ' e , e e \ a a a a a e , a e e e a a a a a a a e a a a ? a e e , e e e ; With these lines the dramatist reminds the audience in very direct, specific terms of Heracles' traditional role as a conquering hero and civilizing force.145 This emphasis increases the force of his subsequent descriptions of his pain and makes Hyllus' and the Old Man's inability to assist him all the more pointed. 142 Although critics have frequently spoken at great length about such topics as how this tableau epitomizes the theme of the great man laid low, the appropriateness or not of Heracles' situation, analogies with the Philoctetes (supra, n. 130), and the question of the relation of this scene with its parallel in Euripides' Hercules Furens (cf. Reinhardt [ . 89] 258-60), consideration of these and other appropriate issues should not distract us from recognizing how effective and pregnant the vignette is in its own right. One of the most adroit touches is the manner in which the escort in foreign garb (cf. 964) suggests Heracles' ' alien ' nature. 143 The irony of his lot is epitomized in the juxtaposition of olav . . . a with the MSS' or Brunck's and Wakefield's frequently accepted emendation a . 144 Although the basic pattern and sense are secure, the text and colometry of 1004-43 have been the subject of extensive discussion, and there can be little doubt that the MSS contain lacunae as well as transpositions; in addition to the various commentaries (supra, nn. 27, 79), see also Lloyd-Jones (n. 86) 267-70, and Pohlsander ( . 94) 145-46. 145 The force of these lines is intensified by the emphatic phrasing throughout and the poet's use of dactylic hexameters, which convey a gnomic quality. The irony of Heracles' situation is epitomized by the manner in which the initial phrases and reference to his illness are balanced by the descriptions of his accomplishments and use of a a (1012; cf. 1060 61) to characterize his acts.</page><page sequence="56">56 TRADITIO When Heracles couples his request that Hyllus dispatch him with the following denunciation of Deianeira, it is clear that he has not the slightest knowledge of or even regard for her intent, but in a very traditional, heroic manner judges her solely in terms of results (1036-40): a e a , a * a , e a a a e ? a &lt;5' e e a a , ' a , e e . Following a brief speech by the Chorus that marks the close of the first part of the ?xodos, Heracles begins a long account of his heroic labors (1046-1111). Throughout the speech the irony of his lot is expressed in terms of the contrast that recurs in different ways between his heroic enterprises and what 4 the deceitful daughter of Oeneus' (1050) has wrought. Her acts are 'the woven net of the Furies by which I perish, ' which ' glued to my sides has consumed my innermost flesh' (1051-54).146 In the next section (1057-63) he reiterates the contrast between his heroic accomplishments and how he has been brought low by a woman in very specific terms.147 The stark manner in which this con trast is expressed serves as a context for Heracles' query where his son's loyalties will lie when Deianeira is duly punished.148 Heracles justifies his stance by yet another series of references to what he has done in the past and how now he has been found to be a woman (1075). The force of this plea is heightened by his demand that Hyllus examine him as the disease attacks him once more. As he writhes before the assault of the disease, he invokes Hades and Zeus again for release, addresses various parts of his body, and then launches into an extended account of his labors. Elliptical though it may be, the narrative indicates the dramatist's intent to identify the agonized figure we see upon the stage with 146 The first figure not only implies an obvious notion of entrapment but also reflects the traditional metaphor of weaving as a figure for feminine guile as well as virtue (supra, n. 121). The second figure continues in a most graphic fashion that of 768-69 which in turn echoes 683 (supra, n. 130). 147 The contrast between his present bondage (cf. 1055) and the former range and scope of his heroic activities is heightened by the very direct description of his having been brought low by a woman. This figure serves as a capstone to the various enslavement and entrap ment figures in the play (supra, n. 98). The manner of Deianeira's suicide, with a sword, adds an additional note of irony to Heracles' angry denunciation that she conquered him a a a (1063). 148 The intensity of these lines is such that it is no wonder that many critics have seen in them Sophocles' own criticism of Heracles and the heroic ideals he represents; see, for example, Murray (n. 100) 120-21, or with even greater vehemence Kamerbeek's (n. 79) general comment on 1066-69: 'Perhaps the most savage passage in Greek Tragedy. If Sophocles wanted to demonstrate how bodily torment causes heroes, no less than ordinary men, to forget the most elementary decency, he could not have done better. But the picture is in keeping with the Heracles of 271-73, the devastator of Oechalia, the murderer of Lichas. Every word of these lines is of a maniacal, perverse cruelty.

The exploits Sophocles touches upon cover the whole gamut of Heracles' exploits ranging from such folk-tale motifs as his combats with the Nemean Lion or Hydra to themes whose * tran scendental' significance such as the retrieval of the Apples of the Hesperides were already well recognized in the period. In a manner that is quite parallel to the iconography of the Hephaisteion discussed earlier, the passage demon strates how, while the e ae might not yet be canonical, there was, nevertheless, a very strong sense of Heracles' labors as a group in the period.149 The bold language of this account sets Heracles' subsequent comments on his fallen state and the irony of his descent from Zeus in very stark relief.150 The speech concludes with his demand that Deianeira be brought forth for punish ment so all might know (1111): a a e a a e e a . The speech is a powerful one which conveys its effect not so much because of the intricacy of its internal logic but because of the intensity of the speaker and the bold contrast between his present wretched state and his heroic accom plishments in the past. The reference to his great deeds is a very pointed reminder that in this drama we are confronted not just with Deianeira's hus band but the greatest of the Greek paradigms of heroic accomplishment, and, just as earlier scenes had depicted the ambiguities of Deianeira's human quan dary and response, so also this speech delineates the fundamental irony of Heracles' heroic career as we observe not only his agony but also learn why all regard him as the 'best of men.' The next section of the ?xodos examines the rationale behind Heracles' plight. It begins with Hyllus' plea to Heracles to soften his anger, since (1118 19): a ?v e a e e a a e a . Despite Heracles' savage outbursts Hyllus persists in the subsequent dialogue until it is revealed that Deianeira is dead by her own hand (1136) and that she acted with good intent (1136). When Nessus' role is disclosed (1141-42), Hera cles becomes immediately aware of the finality of his situation and bids Hyllus to summon all the absent members of his house to hear the prophecies he 149 The stress on the monstrous elements in these accounts was obviously intended to echo the parallel descriptions of the assaults of the disease and Heracles' physical and mental torment. See also Brommer's comments on this passage and its parallel in Euripides' Her cules Furens 348-435, Herakles ( . 26) 59-60. 150 The description of Zeus as 'lord of the starry sky' (1106) not only forms an effective contrast with that of Heracles' unseen assailant but also recalls the star imagery of the parodos and the cyclic sense it created (supra, n. 87).</page><page sequence="58">58 TRADITIO knows.151 He begins this account (1157-78) by stressing once more his paternity from Zeus and explaining how the latter had said he would die at the hands of no living being but rather at those of an inhabitant of Hades, who then is promptly and forcefully identified as Nessus (1162-63; cf. 1141-44). Events have confirmed the accuracy of this prophecy, and now Heracles realizes the true meaning of the prophecy that after his labors he would find release, since (1173): a a a e a . In terms of substance the realizations Heracles expresses add little to what has been disclosed before; his comments on the true meaning of the prophecy that now he shall find rest are little more than a reiteration of the Chorus' sentiments in the third stasimon and Deianeira's and Hyllus' realizations in the preceding episode. What, however, is different and significant is the as surance with which they are expressed. As the full nature of the catastrophe is revealed, Heracles speaks not from the level of limited human intelligence but with the confidence that comes from the divine.152 The speech, however, does not develop this motif in the abstract but rather illustrates it graphically 151 I cannot share the opinion that has sometimes been voiced that the absence of Heracles' family at this juncture is part of his 'punishment' or the like; the lines draw attention to the hero's isolation from yet another perspective and at most serve as an ironic comment on his own extended absences. A far more important characteristic of the sequence is the way in which, with the emphasis on prophecies and their fulfillment, the basic parameters of the drama's action change from human to more than human concerns; see Adams (n. 78) 130. Other commentators have seen in the sequence a transition to a coda to the drama proper so that everything will come out in accordance with the usual mythical tradition; see, e.g., I. M. Linforth's rather extreme view that the final scene is an afterpiece that does mark a notable change in direction and emphasis in the drama, 'The Pyre on Mount Oeta in Sopho cles' Trachiniae/ University of California Publications in Classical Philology 14.7 (1952) 255-78. Discussions of these points have naturally entailed the complex question whether or not Sophocles refers to the apotheosis of Heracles in the Trachiniae. A very convenient survey of the issues involved and positions taken is provided in the opening pages of T. F. Hoey's 'Ambiguity in the Exodos of Sophocles' Trachiniae/ Arethusa 10 (1977) 269-94. The same author comments quite tellingly on Linforth's thesis in his 'Causality and the Trachiniae/ CJ 68 (1973) 306-9, and his remarks on how causality and responsibility are shared in the drama parallel G. M. Kirkwood's remarks on the forms of contrast in the play in his 'The Dramatic Unity of Sophocles' Trachiniae/ TAPA 72 ( 941) 203-11. 152 Reinhardt ( . 89) 70-71, offers an interesting analogy between Heracles' realization at this point and Cambyses' in Herodotus 3.64. The differences between human and divine knowledge and the manner in which tragic events occur because of the discrepancy between them is one of the most frequently discussed topics in Sophoclean scholarship. An excellent introduction to the subject is provided by H. Diller, G?ttliches und menschliches Wissen bei Sophokles (Kiel 1950). The theme of knowledge in Sophocles is closely linked with that of time; on the latter, in addition to the excellent remarks of Knox in the initial chapters of The Heroic Temper ( . 1), see J. de Romilly, Time in Greek Tragedy (Ithaca 1968), Chaps. 1, 4.</page><page sequence="59">TRACHINIAE 59 at the close when Heracles requests that his son pledge obedience to him. The subsequent interchange between the pair offers a subtle but forceful reminder of the importance of both the human and divine perspectives and their simul taneous proximity and distance for understanding the dramatic rhythm of the play as a whole. These human and divine dimensions of the play's experience are mirrored in the two demands Heracles places upon his son. The first (1193? 1202) is to carry him to the summit of Mt. Oeta and there prepare a pyre to kindle once he has been placed upon it.153 The manner in which Heracles presses this task upon Hyllus and the graphic language with which he threatens to be come a curse on him from below should Hyllus not comply (1201-2) are very direct reminders of the more than human dimensions of Heracles' being and experience. Hyllus' anguished response in return reminds us of the abhorrent nature of such a prospect from a human perspective. The differences between the two stances are epitomized by Hyllus' fear that such an act would make him his father's murderer (1206-7) and by Heracles' retort that he will instead be his true physician (1208-9). The extreme nature of the cure shows the extreme nature of the disease, and the audience is subtly but powerfully reminded of how earlier this illness had been identified with the divine power of Cypris her self.154 The incommensurability of human and divine desires is brought out by the uneasy compromise at which the pair arrive: Hyllus will take his father to the summit, construct the pyre, but not kindle it.155 The second boon Heracles 153 Commentators on the play and historians of religion have noted with some frequency how this request provides an aetiology for cult practice of considerable antiquity in Heracles' honor; see M. P. Nilsson, 'Der Flammentod des Herakles auf dem Oite,' Archiv f?r Religions wissenschaft 21 (1922) 310-16; see also 22 [1923] 200); and 'Fire-Festivals in Ancient Greece/ JHS 43 (1923) 144-48. But, while the cult practice was obviously old, I do not share Levy's conviction (n. 27) 47-48, that the practice supports her contention that Heracles has a Near Eastern origin. 154 I do not share the belief reflected in the work of Wender ( . 88) 14-15, and others (cf. Biggs [n. 104] 230) that this association is intended to demonstrate the purely negative nature of love. Rather, as R. P. Winnington-Ingram observed about the Hippolytus, 'Hippolytus: A Study in Causation,' Euripide, Entretiens sur l'antiquit? classique VI (Vand uvres Geneva 1960) 168-91: 'My point is simply this, Euripides is not demonstrating that passion in abstracto is too strong for intelligence in abstracto, but showing how, given certain cir cumstances and antecedents, it is too strong' (177). 155 As noted before, there has been considerable debate whether or not Sophocles refers to the apotheosis of Heracles in this play, and Hoey (n. 151) provides a very convenient review of the major positions taken as well as advancing additional arguments in favor of the view that the dramatist was deliberately ambiguous on the point (cf. Kirkwood [n. 59] 277-78). One point that needs to be considered more in deciding upon this issue is the general familiarity of the audience with this motif. The evidence collected by Brommer (Denkm?lerlisten, Vasenlisten [ . 26]), the fragments of archaic pedimental sculpture from the Acropolis, and the iconography of such structures as the Treasury of the Athenians and Hephaesteion make it clear that the Athenians were very familiar with this motif, and, when one considers the</page><page sequence="60">60 TRADITIO demands, that Hyllus marry Iole, reflects upon the human dimension of the situation.156 The manner in which Iole is reintroduced at this juncture is an elegant touch on the part of the dramatist by which he reminds the audience of not only her role in the tragic sequence of events but also Deianeira's response and the tragic consequences of her actions. At the same time, the manner in which Heracles refers to Iole and justifies his request (cf. 1225-26157) betrays a lack of human sympathies when dealing with a very human institution (1228-29): ' a e a a a e a ' e a e a a e a . Hyllus' initial response (1230-31) reveals how incomprehensible Heracles' request is on human terms, and his subsequent refusal concludes on a note of hyperbole that is reminiscent of his manner with Deianeira when he reported the events on Cape Cenaeum (1236-37) :158 e a e \ a e , a e f? a e . The vigorous manner in which Heracles responds with yet another threat that he will become a curse should Hyllus not comply (1238-40; cf. 1201-2) re minds the audience once more of the relative unimportance of human concerns when juxtaposed with more than human demands. This time Heracles does not mitigate his demands; he requires absolute compliance and regards any disobedience by Hyllus as ?e a, impiety (cf. 1244-46). The manner in which these two requests are framed and the responses they provoke epitomize both the proximity and ultimate distance between the hu man and more than human perspectives Sophocles has constructed in this play. Heracles does not soften, become more human, or temper either his nature or resolve, but rather, once the true nature and cause of his suffering is revealed, abundant references to Heracles' end, Mt. Oeta, and finally the pyre itself, it is hard to think how thoughts of the hero's prospective apotheosis would not have been conjured up even if the dramatist does suppress its positive aspects in favor of the grim costs involved. 156 I do not concur with J. K. MacKinnon's thesis ( 'Heracles' Intention in His Second Request of Hyllus: Track. 1216-51,' CQ 21 [1971] 33-41) that Iole is to become Hyllus' concubine and not his wife. 157 Although the text is troubled, the force and direction of the lines is not; in a very tra ditional, Homeric manner that is reminiscent of Achilles' and Agamemnon's attitude about Bris?is, Heracles simply regards Iole as a piece of property whose disposition is a matter of concern. 158 The extravagance of the sentiment is reflected in the grammar with the use of the generic plural to refer to Iole and the pleonasm of a a e which, as Kamerbeek ( . 79) ad 1237, observes, refers back to 1225 and possibly 545. The Homeric cast of Hyllus' response echoes that of Heracles' request (supra, n. 157).</page><page sequence="61">' TRAGHIN IAE ' 61 becomes more confident and demanding.159 He accepts his fate, his mortal lot (cf. 1256160), but as the scene with Hyllus has made abundantly clear, not the world of human sensibilities.161 As the procession prepares to depart, the au dience is reminded of the violence of the disease, and Heracles has to exercise all the control he can muster to control his pain (1259-63).162 The play ends not with a quiet acceptance of divine will but on Hyllus* anguished note of human protest at the apparent injustice of the gods. The irony of events is epitomized in Hyllus' outburst (1264-69): a e ', a , e a e e - e e a e a e e a a , a e a e a e a ' e a a . This statement encapsulates the ultimate incommensurability of human and divine affairs.163 Men, like Deianeira, must bear the responsibility for their acts and cannot be excused when action and intent fail to correspond because of factors that are beyond their ken; but the divine is not limited by such constraints. Hyllus cannot understand this, Heracles does, and does so because he has become something more and knows it. It is this dichotomy which has 159 With increasing frequency in recent years critics (e.g., Segal [n. 83], Sorum [n. 59], Williams and Dickerson [n. 83]) have seen a change in Heracles in the ?xodos, which they have described in a variety of ways ranging from a renunciation of his former violence and bestial ity to an increased understanding of divine purpose which leads to union with his father Zeus. Although, for the most part, these studies are marked by a willingness to accept Heracles on his own terms, there is, in my opinion, very little in the text that points to such a fundamental change in Heracles' temper at this point. We see, instead, an intensification of those elements he had demonstrated before; see Webster (n. 87) 178-79. 160 I share Hoey's belief (n. 151) 271-72, cf. 269, that the line does not imply a denial of Heracles' apotheosis; it may, in fact, point to it in a much less ambiguous fashion than Hoey supposes. 161 The ambiguity of their relationship is reflected in ironic use of the father and son motif which runs throughout the drama (see Easterling's excellent remarks [n. 82] 67-68), and which is epitomized at the close when Hyllus' complaints about his father's severity echo Heracles' laments about Zeus. 162 Although I do not concur with Segal's opinion, 'Sophocles' Trachiniae' (n. 83) 136-38, that these lines epitomize Heracles' new temper (supra, n. 159), his comments on this passage are valuable for the manner in which they delineate the intensity of Heracles' resolve. See also Segal's very suggestive remarks on the manner in which the pyre on Mt. Oeta can be considered a reversal of the sacrifice on Gape Genaeum (141-46; cf. his 'Mariage et sacrifice . . . [ . 83] 47-57). 163 T/kg contrast between and a in the opening lines is especial ly effective in this regard, and both Kamerbeek and Longo ( . 79) ad loc., comment sen sitively on the terms and the significance of their collocation.

It should be clear from the preceding analysis that the Trachiniae is a rich and complex play which displays a wealth of content and considerable sophis tication in the development and manipulation of dramatic effects. Although the drama is relatively early (supra, n. 59), it reveals the sure hand of an experienced dramatist who knows how to exploit and control the resources of the medium to good effect. In terms of content the play encompasses a broad range of subjects which are developed with a keen sense of their interrelation ships as well as significance in their own right. The result is a drama with a rich conceptual fabric, and, while there are a number of relatively simple individual concepts or pairs of concepts that can be discerned, the manner in which they are employed in conjunction with one another in a constantly chang ing and developing series of contexts makes their effect much more complex in the final analysis. Consequently it is simply not appropriate to speak of the play in terms of a single dominant motif or such contrasts as those between male and female principles in the abstract, Heracles and Deianeira in particular, human and more than human responses, divine and human wisdom, without recognizing the manifold ways in which Sophocles has construed these and other motifs in combination with one another. The richness of the thematic and personal interrelationships Sophocles constructs in the Trachiniae also makes it difficult to delineate the theme of the play as a whole. By now it should be apparent that, as useful as such generic descriptions of the play in terms of such motifs as knowledge, justice, Eros, or even the precarious nature of human existence itself are, they do not do justice to the total fabric of the play. The same hesitation can be expressed of studies which concentrate upon character analysis or which attempt to interpret the play by determining whether Heracles or Deianeira is the principal figure. The first approach does not pro vide an adequate framework for comprehending the strong conceptual aspects of the drama, and the second leads to the well-worn conundrum: if we consider the tragedy as Deianeira's alone, what are we to do with the presence of Hera cles in the ?xodos; or, if Heracles is the hero, why is the great body of the play devoted to Deianeira? In addressing these questions we must never forget that the Trachiniae was not constructed as a puzzle but a drama, and a drama that was meant to 164 par more important than the long-debated question whether Hyllus or the Chorus speaks the final lines is the emphasis on the ultimate responsibility of Zeus. Although enun ciated early in the drama in such descriptions as that of him as a (251; supra, n. 99), Zeus' role is subordinated to such motifs as Eros, disease, and the primal until the ?xodos, where he becomes ubiquitous.</page><page sequence="63">' TRACHINIAE ' 63 be comprehended at its first and possibly only presentation on the Attic stage. Author, actors, and audience were all aware of this, and in the intense and very public competition for prizes at the great Athenian spring festivals no dramatist, especially one as sensitive and experienced as Sophocles, would have deliber ately intended to confuse his audience. I believe that, when the significance of the factors touched upon in the first part of this essay is recognized, a much clearer assessment of Sophocles' intent can be formed. In other words, an analysis of the Trachiniae not only must entail recognition but also must be set in the context of Greek concepts of heroes, their cults, and their feelings to ward the figure of Heracles in particular; and these factors in turn both help us understand and are reflected in the structure and levels of experience present ed in the drama. It should be clear from the preceding analysis that the action of the drama is construed from a variety of perspectives reflecting a number of very different realms of experience and expectation which are fundamentally quite distinct from one another. There is the very human, feminine stance of Deianeira, the brutal, heroic demeanor of her husband, the constant undercurrent of references to monsters, monstrous beings, and primal experience to which both principals respond in different ways, and ultimately the will of Zeus himself. Considered as a whole, the play thus encompasses the totality of experience and all the ambiguities it entails. The dramatist, however, does not simply confront us with these varied perspectives, but in a controlled and measured fashion makes us aware of their interrelationships. In the initial scenes the primary emphasis is on Deianeira and the human dimensions of the drama, in the central scenes there is an increased emphasis on the world of the primal and monstrous, and in the closing scenes the audience is confronted with the heroic by the presence of Heracles and the divine by the constant reiteration of his relationship with Zeus and the revelation of the true meaning of the prophecies about his fate. But, while the movement from human through primal to heroic and divine is done in a progressive manner without jarring dislocations or inconsistent be havior on the part of the characters, it is not executed in a mechanical fashion. Throughout the drama these perspectives are in constant interplay with one another, and the dramatist does not hesitate to exploit either their interconnec tions or ambiguity. The result is a drama which possesses what Gellie has termed an extraordinarily rich 'rhetoric of the situation,' and it is only by considering the sequential nature of the action as it is developed on the stage that we can understand how Sophocles constructed this matrix of associations and inter connections.165 In the first episode, for example, we can observe a very careful 165 G. H. Gellie, 'Character in Greek Tragedy/ AU ML A 20 (1963) 241-55, 244; see also Dale ( . 76) 12-13.</page><page sequence="64">64 TRADITIO expansion of the situation established in the prologue and parodos. The four scenes of the episode flow naturally from one another to develop a clear sense of both the general circumstances and Deianeira's particular situation. Upon retrospect it becomes clear that the episode not only possesses a closely knit internal logic but that it also anticipates subsequent developments and the development of the play as a whole. By the contrast between Deianeira's gen eral expressions of compassion and her private dismay when she learns of Iole's true role, we are subtly prepared for her use of the philtre in the following episode. Lichas' and the Messenger's accounts pose the question of Heracles' heroism and its relationship not only to normal standards of conduct but also various primal forces and prepares for the different responses of the two prin cipals to the latter which are so vividly portrayed in the first stasimon. The same meticulous care can be seen throughout the drama; no matter what scene or sequence of scenes is considered, the basic pattern and manner in which it is linked to what precedes and follows is carefully and consistently wrought. Consequently, even though the audience is presented with what seems at first to be a bewildering panoply of perspectives, the internal logic of the drama as a whole is cumulative. The careful manner in which Sophocles develops and then explores the various forms of interplay among the various levels of ex perience presented in the drama constitutes one of the most important aspects of the play's structure. The effect of this logical network is intensified when we recognize that Soph ocles has also employed two basic structural patterns to epitomize the lots of his principals. The first part of the drama can be described in terms of a ring composition centered upon Deianeira, and this movement is combined with a linear presentation of the heroic paradigm of Heracles.166 The dramatist's 166 Although detailed discussion of the structure of the drama is beyond the scope of this essay, the following basic pattern does appear to be clear. The prologue and the parodos set forth in personal and then somewhat more abstract terms the basic situation from which the action of the drama as a whole proceeds. The sense of cyclic flow that is so strong in these opening scenes is then mirrored in the loosely knit ring composition of the first through fourth episodes in which, although there is a greater emphasis on the first and third episodes, the first episode is mirrored by the fourth and there is a close responsion between the second and the third. In a similar manner the third stasimon which describes Heracles and Deianeira as victims of love corresponds to the descriptions of the power of Eros and the contest for Deianeira's hand in the first stasimon. These two songs bracket the second stasimon, which with its note of happy expectation epitomizes the futility of human hopes?which, in turn, is not only an important theme in the drama but also mirrored in the oscillation between joy and despair that can be observed through the play as a whole (Hoppin [n. 93] 82, is one of the few critics to recognize the importance of this emotional pattern in the drama). The basic ring structure is not executed in rigid manner but combined with the progressive shifts of focus in a very effective manner; consider, for example, not only the manner in which the fourth episode closes the ring and the human drama with the account of Deianeira's suicide,</page><page sequence="65">TRAGHINIAE 65 choice of a ring composition for presenting Deianeira and the human dimensions of the drama is especially effective because of the manner in which the internal logic of the form and the cyclic sense it creates have their obvious parallels in the rhythm of human life itself. We begin with the negative hopes and expec tations of the Queen, the rationale behind them is then developed, and finally they are tragically justified. Sophocles presents us with a portrait of very human frailties that produce catastrophic results out of the best of motives and a tragic lack of knowledge, and our sense of the human dimensions of the drama is intensified by the structural rhythm in which it is presented.167 This ring composition is combined with an essentially linear development of the figure of Heracles. The basic elements of Heracles' character are revealed early in the play, they are amplified in the first episode in the same sequence of scenes that delineate Deianeira's dilemma, his sufferings are described in graphic clinical detail by Hyllus, and then at last we are confronted with him in person and the harsh demands he makes on all present. Although he is not present on the stage until the ?xodos, his presence is felt throughout, for even before he appears upon the stage he is a basic force behind and frame of reference for the responses and designs of all the characters.168 As the drama progresses the but also how the emphasis on the human dimensions of the catastrophe is set in even greater relief because of the earlier stress on the monstrous nature of the philtre and Heracles' agony. This circular movement is combined with the linear movement or development of the figure of Heracles commented on in the text. Although the opening of the fourth stasimon reflects in a very direct fashion the tension between the human and heroic dimensions (supra, n. 140), its major thrust is to shift the focus of the drama from Deianeira to Heracles, and, while there are correspondences between the fourth stasimon and ?xodos and prologue and parodos, the internal logic of these two sets of scenes is quite different. The initial scenes are constructed in such a way as to reinforce the motif of cyclicity that is so prominent within them, while the fourth stasimon and ?xodos are developed in a progressive manner that reinforces the sense of Heracles' alien nature. The common description of the Trachiniae as a diptych (cf. Kirkwood [n. 59] 42-54) is quite appropriate so long as we remember that use of the term does not preclude the extensive interconnections the dramatist develops between the two principal focuses in the drama, or believe that ' diptych ' is in some way a value term that re flects upon the dramatist's skill in constructing and manipulating complex plots. In this vein, for example, A. J. A. Waldock, Sophocles the Dramatist (Cambridge 1951) argued at some length that the frequent use of diptychs in both Sophocles and Euripides stemmed from the absence of subplots to develop the action (50-61; see Kirkwood's excellent rejoinder, 44-45). 167 We are directed to this rhythm by the gnomes with which the prologue opens (1-3) and the fourth episode closes (944-46). These lines offer the frames for the account of Deianeira, and the personal perspective they express is developed in the abstract in the image of Great Bear in the parodos (129-30). 168 This technique or emphasis amounts to a variation of the one that the dramatist had employed to such good effect in the Ajax; see B. M. W. Knox, 'The Ajax of Sophocles,' HSCP 65 (1961) 1-37 and Musurillo (n. 87) 52. Because Heracles does not enter until the final scene, the effect it produces in the Trachiniae is much more intense.</page><page sequence="66">66 TRADITIO linear development of Heracles and the cumulative effect it produces gradually displaces the ring composition centered upon Deianeira, until at the close we are confronted only with the figure of Heracles and the demands that he makes upon all present. The displacement of the ring composition by the linear development of Heracles reinforces the effect of the progressive shift in focus from the realm of the human to the heroic, and the effect of these two parallel movements must be borne in mind for assessing the interplay of the human and heroic dimensions of the play. The obvious care and attention Sophocles devoted to constructing the human dimensions of the drama and the figure of Deianeira require little additional comment on my part. There can be little doubt that Sophocles depicted Deianeira with uncommon sympathy and concern, and, while she may lack the intensity and unilateral sense of purpose that marks other Sophoclean characters, she does elicit a naturalness of response that is quite unique in Sophoclean drama. We gain a very good sense of her as an individual, and, although we may question her hesitancy, we can understand her motives with little difficulty.169 Under the most trying circumstances, and with only the slightest lapses that reveal the intensity of her private feelings (cf. 375-79, 536-42, and nn. 114, 115 supra), she consistently tries to do her best in cir cumstances that are beyond her control. From the very first scene of the play the audience is made aware that her lot is inextricably linked not only to that of her heroic husband but also with various primal beings, and in the same episodes in which her human qualities are developed in greatest detail, her relationship to these powers is delineated as well. This tension is reflected in the paradoxical nature of Deianeira's marriage; it is, on the one hand, the means by which she defines her personal existence and the human institution which she will attempt to preserve at any cost, but it is also, as she recognizes full well, 169 xhiSj pace Bowra et al., would include her dabbling in magic as well, for the evidence Bowra (n. 78) 129-30, adduces to show the Athenians' discomfiture with magic practices indicates their popularity as well. Although critics in recent years have criticized Deia neira's vacillation and gullibility (cf., e.g., Easterling [n. 82] 63, Ehrenberg [ . 77] 151, Gellie [ . 83] 61, Kirkwood [ . 59] 113-14, and McCall [n. 117] 143-44,155), the fact remains that her motives and demeanor do warrant the high marks the critics have accorded her (cf., e.g., Ad ams [n. 78] 109, 119, Campbell [n. 27] 237, Musurillo [n. 87] 77, and Ronnet [ . 1] 99-105). Her actions and responses do provide an ethical center for the drama on the human plane, and it is hardly surprising that critics such as Whitman (n. 2) 112, have seen the tragedy as hers alone. One element the original audience would have been much more aware of than their modern counterparts or critics is the manner in which Sophocles dissociated Deianeira from the traditions that stressed her Amazonian characteristics or that maintained she acted with malice toward Heracles in sending the robe. Instead, the dramatist develops a portrait of her which, with its stress on her aristocratic and Homeric qualities, is in marked contrast to that of Heracles' behavior in the drama and reflects the traditional distinction between Heracles and the Homeric aristocracy (supra, nn. 33, 108).</page><page sequence="67">' TRAGHIN IAE ' 67 an odd and violent union which has caused her almost continual anxiety. She has, as she states quite succinctly in the prologue, been seen by her husband but to sow and to reap (31-33). The accounts of her encounters with Achelo?s and Nessus and subsequent rescues by Heracles make it clear that Deianeira has long been regarded as little more than a prize and that she is aware of this.170 The descriptions of these violent combats convey a strong sense of more than human forces at play. In the narrative of the first stasimon, for example, there is a studied, deliberate ambiguity in the interlocked descriptions of Heracles and his opponent that sets Deianeira's human apprehension off in very sharp relief. Nevertheless, despite the strong and increasing emphasis on the primal and heroic as the drama proceeds, the human tragedy that is centered upon the Queen is comprehensible on its own terms, and the dignity of her responses is such that it is no wonder that many critics have seen the tragedy as hers alone. Human relationships are the framework from which the action of the drama as a whole proceeds. Until the ?xodos the primary em phasis is upon the human situation and the very human responses it generates in the figure of Deianeira.171 To assert the importance of the human dimensions of the drama, however, does not preclude the possibility that they themselves are developed to delineate other issues in a more intense and demanding manner. I believe that the structure and dramatic rhythm of the play as a whole point to a conclusion of this order. To understand how this might be the case it is appropriate to reconsider some of the factors discussed in the first part of this essay. Elliptical and incomplete though they may have been, the surveys of the first section demonstrated a number of highly significant differences between Greek and modern concepts of heroism, and these distinctions must be borne in mind when assessing the figure of Heracles and Sophocles' intent in the Trachiniae. One point that we must never lose sight of is that the term ' hero ' is and has been in large measure since the Romantics one with essentially positive connotations within the context of most Western societies and litera tures. As a result, authors and critics have consistently (and understandably) construed the phenomenon of heroism in positive terms. The situation in the Greek context was more complex. We must never forget that, while heroes were objects of admiration, avatars of cultural ideals, and frequently regarded as important guardians of the commonweal, they were also a cause for con 170 Although critics have with some frequency noted the parallels between Deianeira and Penelope and Helen in the epics, the ironic analogies of her position with such figures as Bris?is have not been properly recognized (supra, nn. 108, 157). Despite her apparent freedom Deianeira's lot is very similar to that of Iole and parallels Tecmessa's in the Ajax. 171 This emphasis is brought out by the way in which the fourth episode returns to and concentrates upon the personal dimensions of Deianeira's fate as well as the dramatist's use of ring composition, stress upon the cyclic nature of human affairs, and the manner in which the initial episodes all begin with Deianeira pondering the ambivalence of her lot.</page><page sequence="68">68 TRADITIO siderable apprehension who often made harsh, peremptory demands for pro pitiation as well. The Greeks did not require heroic behavior to accord with normal standards about what was right and proper, and, as the account of the heroization of the homicidal Cleomedes of Astypalaea indicates, this belief continued well into the fifth century.172 Brelich has shown quite clearly that the deportment of heroes was frequently viewed as analogous with the crude and barbaric forces against which they regularly contended (supra, n. 20). Sophocles' culture and audience was well aware of this, and, despite the ration alism and spirit of free enquiry that developed in the fifth century, Greek culture of the period continued to be dominated by mythology, and a mythol ogy which was filled with violent characters and conflicts. Sophocles' au dience may not have entertained a literal credence in these tales ? such was never demanded and rarely accorded ? but most major cultural models con tinued to be conceived and presented in terms of myth, and of the varied para digms Greek mythology provided none was more important than Heracles.173 Returning to the Trachiniae: the first point that must be recognized and accepted on its own terms is that Sophocles has deliberately constructed the drama so that Heracles is an almost complete antithesis to Deianeira. He is not conceived in the same terms and manner as Deianeira, his actions and re sponses have little in common with the human dimensions of the drama, and Sophocles has underscored these changes by the progressive shifts of focus within the drama and the careful combination of two different structural techniques to characterize the lots of his principals.174 The careful manner in which these shifts in emphasis and construction are made without imposing 172 Pansanias 6.9.6-8; see also Farnell (n. 3) 365-66. The fact that this was apparently the last cult sanctioned by Delphi indicates the increasing discomfiture with the extremes exemplified by some of these figures. 173 While, as Kirk, The Nature of Greek Myths (n. 29; Chap. 12, and others have argued, it is probably improper to speak of such a process as 'mythic thought, ' the fact remains that throughout the fifth century these narratives provided the medium through which many of the new ideas were expressed. The dramas of Sophocles, as well as those of Euripides, offer abundant evidence of this pattern of thought; see F. Solmsen, Intellectual Experiments of the Greek Enlightenment (Princeton 1975), Chapter V. The importance of myth within the context of the Greek enlightenment is demonstrated by the fact that the first work to con sider what we might term 'subjective psychology* on a theoretical level, Gorgias' Helen, took as its subject a heroine from the realm of myth; see C. P. Segal, 'Gorgias and the Psychol ogy of the Logos/ HSCP 66 (1962) 99-155. 174 It is significant that, although Sophocles does juxtapose two principals of quite dif ferent temper and combine two different structural techniques in the drama, he does so in a manner that is intended to increase our sense of unit construction and not to create one of violent dislocation as is the case in Euripides' Medea, with which this drama has been frequently compared. On the latter see T. V. Buttrey, 'Accident and Design in Euripides' Medea,' AJP 79 (1958) 1-17, which has been supplemented in a significant manner by J. R. Dunkle, 'The Aegeus Episode and the Theme of Euripides' Medea,' TAPA 100 (1969) 97-107.</page><page sequence="69">'trachiniae' 69 jarring dislocations to the fabric of the drama not only offers eloquent testi mony to the dramatist's skill but is also highly indicative of his intent to demonstrate the proximity and distance between Deianeira and Heracles. The violence of the latter is one of his most conspicuous characteristics. The reports of his conduct by Lichas and the Messenger suggest that he lacks vir tually every reasonable human sensibility and sensitivity. When he finally appears upon the stage he does little more than rant, scream, rave, and make extravagant demands on everything and everybody. Even in his agony he does little to command our sympathy and is, without doubt, the harshest figure in Sophoclean drama; and, just as the critics have lavished praise on Deianei ra's sensitivities, so also with equal, if not greater, zeal have they castigated Heracles.175 When judged in human terms there is little that can be said to be attractive in his persona; he seems in fact to be little more than an alter Bill Sikes whose lust and violence have brought him his just deserts. Consequently, the question that must be resolved is not how Sophocles pre sented Heracles but why he makes such a harsh, violent, and demanding pres ence the point to which the action of the drama inexorably moves. I believe that an adequate response to this question and its appropriate corollaries can be found if we entertain the hypothesis that the Trachiniae is a dramatization in very explicit terms of the absolute and unconditional nature of heroism and all the ambiguities such a condition or state entails. Heracles is not presented as an individual but as a demanding heroic presence from first to last. The portrait of Heracles in the Trachiniae constitutes a full scale dramatization of nothing more and nothing less than the varied and sometimes contrary responses the Greeks entertained about heroes in general and the figure of Heracles in particular. This ambivalence can be observed in the accounts of the sack of Oechalia, the highly graphic and suggestive descriptions of the combats between Heracles and Acheloiis and then Heracles and Nessus, and most immediately in Heracles' conduct and demands in the ?xodos. Heracles is violent, harsh, inflexible, and demanding not because he is a brute but because he is a hero. Commenting on Antigone, J. H. Kells once remarked that 4 she belongs to an exceedingly tough class of personage, one which we no longer meet in our society 175 There is little need at this juncture to rehearse in any great detail the varied ways in which this has been done, but the intensity with which these sentiments have been voiced, not only by those critics who have criticized Heracles from start to finish but even by such critics as Segal, 'Mariage et sacrifice . . .,' Trachiniae . . . (n. 83), or Williams and Dickerson (n. 83) who see Heracles as somehow redeemed at the close, is conspicuous. The most limited ap proach to Heracles occurs when the hero is considered on purely human terms. R?nnet*s study ( . 1) 94-99, offers one of the most forthright examples of this attitude and demonstrates in complete detail the form of negative criticism that results when Heracles and his acts are considered from a purely human standpoint (see also Murray's frequently cited description of the dramatic action as a police case [n. 100] 126).</page><page sequence="70">70 TRADITIO and are therefore liable to misunderstand. '176 Nowhere in Sophoclean drama is this intensity of person better witnessed than by Heracles in the Trachiniae. The nature and limitations of heroism have long been recognized as an impor tant motif in Sophoclean drama, and no figure illustrates this motif better or more directly than Heracles, the hero par excellence of Greek culture. I believe that, when the presentation of this figure in the Trachiniae is placed in the context of Greek attitudes to heroes in general and Heracles in particular, the drama emerges not as an aberration or anomaly; rather, it can be recognized as dealing with what Knox has termed 'the heroic temper' with greater in tensity and directness than any other extant play, for the drama presents the audience with a figure who even upon entrance is the epitome of what other Sophoclean heroes strive to become and who from that existentially precarious position proceeds even further. At this point the objection might well be raised why, if Sophocles' intent was to dramatize the ironies and tensions of heroism, are the human dimensions of drama and the figure of Deianeira so well developed ? My response to this is simply to ask what better or more readily comprehensible technique could Sophocles have employed to illustrate the simultaneous proximity and tragic distance between the heroic and human spheres than by illustrating this tension between husband and wife ? We must recognize that it was only by developing the human perspective with as much eloquence and compassion as he did that Sophocles could demonstrate with such intensity both how and why Heracles and heroism cannot be construed on purely human terms. The ready accessi bility of the human dimensions of the drama, the sympathetic nature of Dei aneira, and the predominant bent of modern sensitivities have all fostered the view that Sophocles' primary intent was to dramatize the human elements of the situation. Understandable though it may be, such a stance underestimates not only the lively sense of both the primal and the heroic the Greeks entertained, but also the strong hold these beliefs exercised over the Greek imagination. We must also never forget that, given the nature and conventions of Greek drama, it would have been very difficult for Sophocles to address the question of hero ism except by presenting it in the context of a human situation. The ambiguity of the close and Hyllus' strident pleas of moral outrage demonstrate not only the irony of Heracles' individual lot but also how heroism itself can neither be reconciled with ordinary human standards nor understood on purely human terms. In other words, I believe that the human drama is designed to focus our attention on the question of heroism and not the other way around. Support 176 J. H. Keils, 'Problems of Interpretation/ IC S 10 (1963) 47-65, 50. See also J. T.

The manner in which the dramatist develops and manipulates the impor tant themes of knowledge and love also lends support to this hypothesis. It has long been recognized that knowledge and the tragic consequences of the limitations of human knowledge are important themes in the drama. These themes are not developed in abstract, static terms but emerge from the inter play of characters and their responses as the action of the play progresses. There is a broad spectrum of forms of intelligence that are portrayed in the drama, for, in addition to the carefully distinguished stances of the human characters ranging from Deianeira to the old man in charge of Heracles' escort, we are confronted with the animal-like cunning of the Centaur, Heracles' self-centered egocentricity, the realm of prophecy and, ultimately, Zeus' will. Everyone, save Zeus, learns and learns too late, but Sophocles is concerned with much more than demonstrating a simple failure or inadequacy of human knowledge. Deianeira fails not because of the limitations of her intelligence but because of the nature of the forces with which she tries to contend, the different capacities they possess, and priorities they espouse.177 The ?xodos demonstrates with exceptional clarity how Heracles displays a prescience that is not only beyond Deianeira and Hyllus but also proceeds from quite different assumptions. The manner in which Deianeira is simply dismissed from con sideration by Heracles once he learns of Nessus' role and consequently under stands the prophecy about his end demonstrates not merely the hero's callous disregard of this wife but also the truly substantial differences in the levels of their comprehension of the situation. Hyllus' protests to Heracles' impositions of his will in the ?xodos serve a similar function in an even more explicit manner, and both sequences illustrate the differences between human and heroic under standing and standards of conduct The parallels between the dramatist's use of this theme and his manipulation of the motif of Eros are both more ex tensive and significant than has been commonly recognized. All the characters can be said to 'love, ' and the forms this emotion takes cover a broad spectrum of types as well as intensities. We see Deianeira's gentle devotion, the lust of Achelo?s and Nessus, Heracles' rape of Oechalia for the sake of Iole, and in the descriptions of the philtre and Heracles' anguish graphic displays of the power 177 As Diller ( . 152) observes, 'die Gottheit redet in der Sprache ihres Wissens, der Mensch versteht nach der F?higkeit seiner Aufnahmeorgane und versteht notwendig falsch, aber nicht, weil die Gottheit ihm irref?hren will, sondern aus der strukturellen Verschiedenheit g?ttlicher und menschlicher Einsicht heraus' (30-31).</page><page sequence="72">72 TRADITIO of love in its most primal form. Eros is not only the basic impetus behind the characters' acts but also the vehicle by which their understanding of the sit uation is made manifest in the action of the drama. If in the Trachiniae the power of love is mainly seen in negative terms, it is, to paraphrase Winnington Ingram (supra, n. 154) not because love itself is inherently a negative power, but because in these circumstances where human and heroic designs are in con flict it has proved to be so. The manner in which the themes of love and knowl edge complement one another in this regard is one of the most important ve hicles Sophocles employs to illustrate the tragic distance between heroic and human behavior. Our appreciation for the intensity with which Sophocles addresses these issues in the Trachiniae can be increased if we compare the drama with the other scene in which Heracles appears in the extant plays. This occurs at the close of the Philoctetes when, after Neoptolemus has failed to convince Philoctetes that it is in his best interests to go to Troy and the pair are about to depart for Greece, Heracles appears ex machina and announces in very explicit terms that it is Zeus' will that they go to Troy. Although this scene was composed some thirty years after the Trachiniae, it shares certain important characteristics with Sophocles' earlier play. First, the epiphany not only under scores the confrontation between human desires and the demands of heroic existence that has been latent throughout the drama, but also does so by means of a bold reversal of the direction of the drama by the playwright after he has deliberately created a seemingly impossible impasse.178 The audience of the 178 Although in recent years the work of A. Spira, Untersuchungen zum Deus ex machina bei Sophokles und Euripides (Kallm?nz 1960), A. Longo, 'Deus ex machina e religione in Euripide/ Lanx satura N.

Some, if not the majority, of the spec tators would have developed considerable compassion for Philoctetes' predica ment and would understand, if not sympathize with, the rationale behind his refusal.179 Those spectators who were familiar with the earlier Aeschylean and Euripidean versions would have realized that Sophocles had by this point developed his drama in such a way that it could not have been concluded by Odysseus' either compelling or persuading Philoctetes to go to Troy.180 They were aware that the action had been redirected before with the arrival of the Emporos, Philoctetes' sudden handing over of Heracles' bow to Neoptolemus, and the 'first' ending with Odysseus' and Neoptolemus' initial departure with 122-64, 24 [1956] 72-107; this suggestion is also made by R. Lattimore in his Story Patterns in Greek Tragedy [London 1964] 45). 179 It has long been recognized that a major theme in Sophoclean drama is the author's concern over the limitations of traditional moral standards and behavior. In general Philoc tetes' refusal reflects the traditional heroic ethic of helping friends and harming enemies, and the rationale behind his particular response is developed in the scenes following the second kommos, where the dramatist has carefully portrayed two sets of demands for Philoctetes' allegiance. When Neoptolemus returns with Odysseus it becomes clear that he has pro gressed from the simplistic attitude he had displayed earlier in the drama, and that his rejection of Odysseus' is based upon abstract concerns for justice (cf. Phil. 1244-51). This scene in turn prepares for the subsequent one between Philoctetes and Neoptolemus where the return of the bow marks the end of the dichotomy between word and deed, speech and intention that had marred their earlier relationship. (On the theme of speech in the Philoctetes see A. J. Podlecki, 'The Power of the Word in Sophocles' Philoctetes/ GRBS 7 [1966] 233-50, K. J. Happe, 'Sophocles' Philoctetes: A Study in Structure' [diss., Yale University 1964] 28-43, Grene [n. 178] 143; W. M. Calder, III, 'Sophoclean Apologia: Philoc tetes,' GRBS [1971] 153-74, however, argues strenuously that this scene and Neoptolemus' repentence is a ruse [cf. 163].) Neoptolemus then makes a direct appeal to Philoctetes as one e a to another to come to Troy, and the force of this appeal is underscored by the brief appearance of Odysseus with his threats of force. When Neoptolemus promptly curbs Philoc tetes' response in kind the dramatist indicates that violence by neither side is an appropriate response, and this in turn centers the audience's attention on Philoctetes' quandary whether or not he should help his former enemies to gain a future benefit. 180 por a general comparison and contrast of the three Philoctetes plays see J. S. Kieffer, 'Philoctetes and Arete,' CP 37 (1942) 38-50. W. M. Calder, III, 'Aeschylus' Philoctetes/ GRBS 11 (1970) 171-79, and T. B. L. Webster, The Tragedies of Euripides (London 1967) 57, who offer detailed discussions of the Aeschylean and Euripidean predecessors to Sophocles' play. Although I do not share many of Calder's conclusions about Sophocles' play (n. 179), I am in complete agreement with his view that this play reflects the political tensions of the period of composition quite directly. See also his 'Die Technik der sophokleischen Kompo sition im Philoktet/ Hellenische Poleis, ed. E. C Welskopf, 4 Vols.

No matter what our sentiments may be about Philoctetes' prior reluctance to go to Troy, we must recognize and accept the fact that a highly personal drama is suddenly and deliberately transformed by the playwright into something quite different with the apocalyptic appearance of Heracles, and, just as Deianeira and the human perspective of the Trachiniae were subordinated to Heracles and his commanding presence in the ?xodos, so also in the Philoctetes the carefully constructed network of human concerns and interactions disappears virtually without protest when matched against the demands of heroic existence. The promptness of Philoctetes' response points to the second feature of this scene which is useful to consider when assessing the Trachiniae, and that is how Sophocles presents Heracles as the ultimate paradigm of the heroic life whose authority and status are signaled by the fact that he speaks with the assurance of divine knowledge.182 Heracles' appearance in the Philoctetes amounts to nothing more and nothing less than that of unconditional truth in a world where such certainty does not normally exist, and it is because the protagonist recognizes this that he signals his instant compliance. As a dramatis persona the Heracles of the Philoctetes can hardly be said to provoke much human interest ; the dramatist has deliberately subordinated his character and personality to what he says in such categorical terms. When Heracles appears the dramatist does not develop a new character so much as present us with a stark paradigm of the costs and obligations of the heroic life. The e with which Neoptolemus had tried to entice Philoctetes to come to Troy (Phil. 1383-84) had been con ceived and framed in very human terms: a cure for his diseased foot and public glory for his role as Troy's captor. These boons are redefined in Heracles' words that Philoctetes must endure, ' e e a a e (Phil. 1421), to 181 The scene with the Emporos offers a very clear-cut and specific example of a technique Sophocles employed to good effect in the Trachiniae of using a scene or speech not to advance the action so much as to intensify and amplify our understanding of the status quo; see A. Masaracchia, 'La scena dell' "E nel Filottete di Sofocle,' Maia 16 (1964) 79-98, and S. Osterud, 'The Intermezzo with the False Merchant in Sophocles' Philoctetes,' Classica et Mediaevalia: F. Blatt septuagenario dedicata, edd. O. S. Due, . F. Johansen, and L. . Dalsgaard, C. and M. Diss. IX (Copenhagen 1973) 10-26. The initial departure of Odysseus and Neoptolemus with the bow has prompted considerable debate whether one or both of them is or is not bluffing at this point. As valid as this concern is in the abstract, with Neoptolemus' return of the bow the issue becomes a moot point. What, perhaps, is more significant about the scene is the way it anticipates the situation just before the epiphany. Possibly Sophocles intended the 'impossible' prospect of Philoctetes' desertion by Odysseus and Neoptolemus to foreshadow the moral dilemma posed by the later scene. 182 The importance of the distinction between human and divine capacities for knowledge has been recognized in virtually every study of the drama; Reinhardts comments and dis tinctions (n. 89) 199-201 are of especial value.</page><page sequence="75">' TRAGHINIAE ' 75 gain glory. The paradigm Heracles presents and Philoctetes accepts is that of heroic endurance.183 Heracles directly parallels Philoctetes* and his own lots and defines the heroic life as one of toil and endurance through toil (Phil. 1419; Tr. 170). Heracles does not speak of his heroic accomplishments save in terms of the costs they have entailed, and he uses his own career to illustrate how Philoctetes must suffer bad masters in the future just as he had done in the past in order to realize his full potential. Heracles conceives and presents Philoctetes' past actions and future prospects under a much different set of parameters than those that have prevailed up to this point, and, in a way that is reminiscent of Heracles' disregard of Deianeira and her fate from any further consideration once Nessus' role has been disclosed, the human terms on which Philoctetes progressed in such an intense and moving manner are not so much dismissed as simply transcended by Heracles' statements in the epiphany. By now it should be clear that there are marked parallels of form and content between these two dramas written so far apart and for such different ends. Both dramas begin with a very strong emphasis on events and interrelation ships on the human level which at or near the close are dismissed in favor of the heroic and divine. In both plays we see Heracles presented as a paradigm of heroic endurance and conduct and a confrontation of heroic and human standards. And, most importantly, in both plays Sophocles stresses the essen tial loneliness of heroism. Heracles' gnomic pronouncements at the close of the Philoctetes are an epitomization of the terrible anguish he voices in the Trachi niae about the discrepancy between what he has done and suffered in return. In certain respects the content of the Philoctetes is narrower than the Trachiniae, for, although the former has been described by Kitto as 'a profound study of political morality set against a universal background of divine justice,'184 it does not cover or reflect the same range of experience and expectation as the Trachiniae. In his earlier drama Sophocles explored the profound and dangerous interplay among human, primal, and heroic spheres in sweeping terms that are reinforced by the overall progression of the drama itself. In the Philoctetes there is no force analogous to Eros exerting its influence upon either Neop tolemus or Odysseus, and the violent bestial disease synonymous with heroism 183 The prominence of this motif has long been recognized in Sophocles' late plays. In the E ledra endurance has been the watchword of the heroine's existence, and the play depicts the moment when her persistence is finally rewarded. The same is true of the Oedipus at Colonus where the aged blind beggar becomes a figure of commanding power and force simply because he has endured until vindicated by the gods. In all three dramas persistence and integrity can be said to accomplish some form of transfiguration. M. C. Baldassari D'Angelo, 'La solitudine dell'eroe sofocleo,' Filosophia 24 (1973) 201-6, has recently con sidered this aspect of Sophoclean drama from a slightly different perspective in very sug gestive terms. 184 H.

Perhaps the most valuable service that these comparisons with the Phil octetes provide is the very direct reminder they offer of the scope and inten sity of Sophocles' earlier drama, and I will close this essay with some brief remarks on these topics. The first quality is most clearly evident in the care fully orchestrated sequence of perspectives through which the action of the drama is developed. We have seen how the Trachiniae is concerned with much more than the personal lots of Heracles and Deianeira; it covers the entire spectrum of existence from crudest forces to the mystery of Zeus' will, and the tragedy that emerges is one that illustrates how two of these perspectives, the human and the heroic ? which mean so much to one another and which, in a sense, only find meaning in one another ? are in the final analysis so painfully alienated. We can observe this movement in many aspects of the play and especially in Sophocles' development of the themes of love and muta bility. Deianeira loves to the best of her abilities, but her positive human intent is confounded when she attempts to control what she cannot even really com prehend. The actions of Heracles and the Centaur's philtre demonstrate how love possesses a more than human dimension that can destroy even more readily than it can heal. Heracles with his imposition of Iole wrecks what little calm and assurance Deianeira possesses, and Deianeira in her attempt to preserve her marriage destroys Heracles and herself. The theme of love is developed both in conjunction and in contrast with the motif of human mutability. Beginning with Deianeira's opening words, this theme is stressed by every character including Heracles. It receives its most explicit formal statement in the paro dos, and throughout the drama Sophocles presents a constant counterpoint between the natural transience of human affairs and the harsh permanence of the divine to which any form of compassion seems alien. The gulf that emerges is epitomized by the fact that Heracles and Deianeira never meet and is re flected in Hyllus' futile protests against both his father's impositions of his will and the resolution of events in the ?xodos.186 In this way the play illustrates 185 Cf. Biggs ( . 104) 231-35. The crude, violent aspects of heroism suggested by the disease-beast imagery of the play are balanced by the emblematic image and physical presence of Heracles' bow, and, although the dramatist does employ both sequences of images both singly and in counterpoint and concert with one another to examine the irony of Philoctetes' situation and behavior, there is a greater separation between the 'positive' and 'negative' aspects of heroism than in the Trachiniae. 186 Despite the protest of K. Rees, The So-called Rule of Three Actors in Classical Greek Drama (Chicago 1908), 55-56, who found the notion highly objectionable on a wide variety of grounds, there can be little doubt that the protagonist played both Heracles' and Deia</page><page sequence="77">traghiniae' 77 from yet another perspective how, despite their natural links and interde pendence, the human and heroic realms are essentially different and then how attempts to bridge this gap are inevitably bound for disaster. The sense of scale created by the broad scope of the dramatic action adds to the intensity of both the drama and the presentation of Heracles it contains. As noted at the outset of this study this second issue is the one which has caused the critics the greatest concern. By now it should be clear that the intensity of this portrait is a matter of deliberate intent and not dramatic misadventure, for just as Sophocles carefully distinguished his Deianeira from the cruder aspects of earlier traditions and stressed her positive human qual ities,187 so also his portrait of Heracles concentrated almost exclusively on the harsher aspects of heroism. By the progressive shifts of focus and the dramatic rhythm of the play we are moved beyond the particular human situation to consider the irony of heroism itself. This, as I have suggested before, is a major part of Sophocles' intent in the Trachiniae. For although we do not share or even fully understand Greek attitudes to heroes, we do know enough to recognize that Sophocles' presentation of Heracles contains no untoward anomalies. The violence and disregard of human concerns demonstrated by Heracles is very much in accord with Greek concepts of heroic behavior. Heroes, like the historic hero cults themselves, were more naturally allied with the Furies than the Olympians, and Heracles in his acts and desire for vengeance behaves accordingly. The violence of his behavior, however, should not prevent us from recognizing that Sophocles also presents us with a character who accepts and fulfills his heroic responsibilities. The final scene is not a coda designed to set the human drama and fate of Deianeira in greater relief, but a graphic demonstration of the isolation incurred by heroism. The great speeches in which Heracles recounts his labors are more than devices by which the author reminded the audience of Heracles' traditional role; they are also the hero's anguished expression of the irony of his lot and how by his very excellence he has isolated himself from any normal human intercourse. Heracles suffers not only from the Hydra's venom but also because he was tragically betrayed neira's roles. The rationale behind this allocation of parts has sometimes puzzled the critics (cf. McCall [n. 117] 142-43) but I believe that Sophocles did this to remind the audience in a very specific, physical way of both the proximity and distance between husband and wife that is developed throughout the drama in so many different ways; see Z. Pavlovskis, 'The Voice of the Actor in Greek Tragedy/ CW 71 (1977) 113-23, who applies some of J. Jones' (n. 76) and T. B. L. Webster's ( 'The Poet and the Mask,' Classical Drama and Its Influence, ed. M. J. Anderson [London 1965] 3-13) remarks on the use of masks and the masking con vention to the individual dramas in an effective manner. 187 See Dickerson (n. 83) Chap. I, and Dugas (n. 83); as Hoppin, (n. 93) 55, observes, Deia neira's response to the natural mutability of human affairs is profoundly colored by the fact that she tends to have no positive hopes.</page><page sequence="78">78 TRADITIO by the very order of being he had served so well. There is a real and very tragic incommensurability between what Heracles has accomplished and what he suffers in return.188 The steadfastness he demonstrates and the demands he makes upon his son in the ?xodos do not mark a lessening of resolve or in tensity of purpose, but rather signal his acceptance of his heroism and the gulf between heroic and human sensibilities. The portrait of heroism Sophocles offers in the Trachiniae is not a comforting one. We are not presented wih a positive paean of human endeavor but a brutal portrait of heroism in its most extreme and ironic form. In this drama Sophocles demonstrates the harsh realities of this state of being in a much more intense and unrelieved manner than in any other play; there is, for example, no final public acceptance of Heracles such as Ajax receives in the close of that play, and little sense of terrible yet somehow comforting mystery that en velops his end, such as befalls Oedipus in the Oedipus at Colonus.189 In so doing Sophocles not only may have voiced his own inclinations and affinities with the temper of the archaic age but also reflects Greek concepts of justice as well as heroism.190 In assessing the Trachiniae, we must never forget the ambiva 188 On the importance of the notion of incommensurability for understanding Greek drama see C. Segal's very adroit application of Max Scheler's concept of 'guiltless guilt' to the Hippolytus in his 'Euripides' Hippolytus and Scheler's "Phenomenon of the Tragic,"' Are thusa 3 (1970) 129-46. See also K. von Fritz, 'Tragische Schuld und poetische Gerechtigkeit in der griechischen Trag?die,' Antike und moderne Trag?die (Berlin 1962), 1-112 and H. Funke, 'Die sogenannte tragische Schuld' (diss., Cologne 1963). 189 The parallels between the Ajax and the Trachiniae need to be examined in some detail. There are, in my opinion, very strong analogies in the way Sophocles construed the situation and central figure. In both dramas selection from potential sources is such that the integrity of the central figure's intent is subject to intense scrutiny from the outset. We have seen how Lichas' and the Messenger's accounts of the sack of Oechalia bring the question of Heracles' heroic conduct to the fore, and Sophocles' choice of the account of Ajax's madness found in the Little Iliad over the Aethiopis for the base of his narrative creates a similar effect (see Hoppin [n. 93] 10-11, Musurillo [n. 87] 7-9, R. C. Jebb, Sophocles, The Plays and Fragments, Pt. VII, The Ajax [repr. Amsterdam 1962] ix-xix, J. C. Kamerbeek, The Plays of Sophocles, Pt. I, The Ajax2 [Leiden 1963] 1-6). In both dramas the ironic relationship of the hero to society and the continued viability of traditional heroic ideals is examined in a very demanding manner (see Knox's comments on this theme in the Ajax [ . 168] 3-6). G. M. Kirkwood, 'Homer and Sophocles' Ajax,' Classical Drama and Its Influence, ed. M. J. Anderson (London 1965) 51-70, has shown how Sophocles uses direct echoes of Homer not only to place the action of the drama into a traditional heroic context but also, and more importantly, to demonstrate the changes that have taken place. The same tension can be discerned in the Trachiniae but in somewhat more abstract terms; we see, in effect, a drama tization of the tension latent in Homer, where Heracles was shown on the one hand as the ultimate paradigm for Achilles and Odysseus and on the other as a flagrant violator of the rights of guest-friendship. 190 I concur with E. R. Dodds's assessment of Sophocles as 'the last great exponent of the archaic world view,' The Greeks and the Irrational (Berkeley 1956) 49. The links between Soph</page><page sequence="79">TRAGHIN IAE ' 79 lence of the Greeks to both of these ideals, for at the same time they offered positive goals, they were the source of considerable apprehension as well. In its simplest form this tension stemmed from the Greeks' concern about the gulf that separated human and divine standards of conduct as well as levels of understanding. We see this tension directly demonstrated by Heracles in the Trachiniae; he is by any normal human standards guilty of lust and ? and yet his attitude and his accomplishments are what ensure his heroic status.191 In the Trachiniae Sophocles neither censures nor lauds heroism, but with metic ulous dramaturgy and in terms the audience would have readily understood constructs a portrait of heroism that is as brutal as it is magnificent. In so doing Sophocles gave vivid dramatic expression to a fundamental ambiguity of his culture, and perhaps it was the intensity of his expression that Pound felt when he stated: 'The Trachiniae presents the highest peak of Greek sensi bility registered in any of the plays that have come down to us. '192 Williams College ocles and the temper of the archaic age have been discussed from a variety of perspectives; see, for example, M. Balasch, 'S?phocles y Sim?nides/ I EH 1 (1967) 45-63, Diller (n. 152), Kirkwood (n. 189), J. C. Opstelten, Sophocles and Greek Pessimism, trans. J. A. Ross (Am sterdam 1952), van Pesch ( . 104), W.

Winnington-Ingram, 'The Electra of Sophocles, Prolegomena to an Interpretation/ POPS n.s. 3 (1954-55) 20-26, and 'Tragedy and Archaic Greek Thought/ Classical Drama and Its Influence, ed. M. J. Anderson (London 1965) 29-50. 191 On the combination of the themes of heroism and justice in the Trachiniae see H. Lloyd Jones, 'Greek Tragedy: Sophocles' Women of Trachis,' The Greek World, ed. H. Lloyd-Jones (Harmondsworth-Baltimore-Ringwood 1965) 96-116 and his amplification of E. R. Dodds' On Misunderstanding the Oedipus Rex/ G?cR 13 (1966) 37-49, in the fifth chapter of his Sather Lectures, The Justice of Zeus (Berkeley-Los Angeles-London 1971). These studies also demonstrate Sophocles' archaic 'temper' (supra, n. 190). 192 The quote is from Pound's brief prefatory remarks to his translation, 'Sophocles, Women of Trachis,' which first appeared in the Hudson Review 6 (1954) 487-523, and their value should not be discounted either because the sentence concludes 'and is, at the same time, nearest the original form of god dance' (487) or because of Pound's unfortunate characteri zation of Deianeira. On Pound's translation see Mason's judicious remarks (n. 104), D. Davie, Erza Pound: Poet as Sculptor (Oxford 1964) 233-34, and the variety of responses in 'The Women of Trachis: A Symposium/ Pound Newsletter 5 (January 1955) 3-8. I share H. Kenner's opinion, 'The Poetics of Error/ Modern Language Notes 90 (1975) 738-46, that, although Pound might be guilty of 'local misrepresentation' (744), his instinct in handling Sophocles' drama was basically correct. Pound possessed a keen sense of the dy namic qualities of the Greek theater and understood quite acutely how the ancient genre reflected civic as well as private aesthetic goals, and it is clear from this translation that Pound recognized and respected the intensity of Sophocles' Heracles. This concludes a loosely connected series of studies that began with my 'Studies in the Use of Myth in Sophocles' Philoctetes and the Orestes of Euripides/ Traditio 32 (1976) 29-95,</page><page sequence="80">80 traditio Appendix: Deianeira's Deportment 393-435 In recent years Deianeira's resolve and general strength of character have been questioned with increasing frequency, and, as noted (supra, n. 106), the brief scene under consideration has frequently been cited as a telling indication of her lack of determination and self-reliance. McCall (supra, n. 118), for example, has argued that when the Messenger takes over the re-interrogation of Lichas 'the feeling among the audience would be that even now, when Deianeira is threatened as a woman, someone else must act, in this case prosecute for her' (149; cf. Adams [supra, n. 78] 117, and Dickerson [supra, n. 83] 244). For McCall and others the ready manner in which Deianeira is displaced at this critical mo ment is a clear indication of how any assertiveness on her part can be undercut by a challenge to her authority. I believe this approach underestimates the sub tlety of both the scene and the dramatist's characterization of Deianeira, and that by having the Messenger and not Deianeira conduct the second interrogation of Lichas the dramatist is able to set her predicament in a clearer perspective than had she continued on her own behalf. One of the most striking and frequently noted qualities of this scene is the adroit manner in which it reiterates and develops elements from earlier in the episode. The Messenger's blunt questions and Lichas' attempts to avoid the issue recall the contrast between their earlier accounts of Heracles' exploits. Lichas' extended prevarication (248-90), the only time in Sophocles we are not aware a deception is underway before it begins, had cast Heracles' exploits in an atmosphere of heroic accomplishment, the irony of which becomes clear in the Messenger's bold, if not coarse, version of the same events and especially Heracles' motivation for the sack of Oechalia (cf. 359-62). In the scene under question the truth at which the Messenger is driving is as blunt as the language he employs (Jebb, Kamerbeek, and Longo [supra, n. 79] stress the Messenger's abruptness; his initial interjection, 402, is especially noteworthy in this regard; see also Kirk wood [supra, n. 59] 113, 119), and Lichas' reluctance mirrors his studious avoid ance of Iole and her prospective role in the earlier scene with Deianeira (cf. 314 19). The crisp dialogue between these two retainers, each faithful in his own way ? Lichas to Heracles and the Messenger to Deianeira ? and now in direct confrontation, reiterates the contrast between these two characters, raises the problematic question of heroic conduct, and points to the fundamental differ ences between Heracles' and Deianeira's characters. Faced with the recalcitrance of Lichas, the Messenger can and does force the issue in a way that she cannot; he asks questions that would demean her both as an individual and as a queen. As Jebb observed, it would be Out of accord with Deianeira's courteous dignity that she should address Lichas with such words' (ad 401-4) as the Messenger employs in 404 and, as Kamerbeek (ad 390, 391, 2) notes, 'it would have been an offense against style and dignity alike if Deianeira had intervened time and time again. ' In the crisp dialogue between Lichas and the Messenger we see in graphic terms how the situation affects Deianeira without her having to descend to the level of the reality with which she has been confronted. and continued with 'The World of Myth in Euripides' Orestes/ Traditio 34 (1978) 1-28. I would like to express my gratitude to the Board of Editors and to the staff of Fordham University Press for their comments and careful attention to matters of detail.</page><page sequence="81">TRAGHINIAE ' 81 This is important because, in our concern over the private dimensions of Dei aneira's personal plight, we must not neglect the fact that Sophocles has taken considerable care in developing the public aspects of her character as Heracles' queen. Her regal status is made quite clear by the initial addresses of the Nurse (49) and Messenger (180) as well as the Chorus (291), and references to her royal po sition continue through the drama. Deianeira consequently has an obligation, a a as it were, with respect to her public role that must be served as well as her own personal desires, and, as noted (supra, n. 108), in fulfilling this obligation she displays a strong sense of the traditional aristocratic virtues and ideals. Although the motif of is not especially significant in the drama, Deianeira's behavior reflects the dramatist's belief that rights, duties, and concepts of proper behavior are a function of birth and rank (see C. E. Hajistephanou, The Use of and its Cognates in Greek Tragedy with Special Reference to Character Drawing, Stasinos 2 [Nicosia 1975] 132-34; the following studies, not cited by Hajistepha nou, are important for understanding Sophocles' concept of and its re alization in the course of the dramas: H. Diller, 'Der griechische Naturbegriff,' JAB 2 [1939] 241-57, '?ber das Selbstbewusstsein der sophokleischen Per sonen,' WS 69 [1956] 70-85, 4 Menschendarstellung und Handlungsf?hrung bei Sophokles,' AScA 6 [1957] 157-69, and A. Lesky, 'Erbe und Erziehung im grie chischen Denken des f?nften Jahrhunderts,' NJAB 2 [1939] 361-81, 'Zwei Sophokles-Interpretationen,' Hermes 80 [1952] 91-105). Although Deianeira's regal qualities have not been frequently noted by the commentators, they are recognized quite well by Lichas, who when he responds to the Messenger's challenge acknowledges first her regal position and then her role as Heracles' wife (405-6). It is the authority of her station which ultimately does compel the truth from Lichas, and when he finally apologizes, it is with pointed reference to her royal position (481-83; cf. 472). The substitution of the Messenger for Deianeira in the interrogation is a very effective stroke on the dramatist's part; it continues the contrast between these two brilliantly drawn characters and allows him to depict Deianeira's situation before her very eyes in sharp relief. The threat that Iole poses to her as a woman and a queen, which itself is intensified by the references to the maiden's royal bearing and stock (cf. 307-16, 379-81, 417-20), becomes all too clear as she listens to their dialogue, and her silence on this occasion is not only as effective as, but also possibly anticipates, her reticence before her final exit to her death. It is important to recognize that Deianeira's moving appeal to Lichas (436-69) can thus be made by a character who, al though she is at the center of a situation which has become increasingly painful with each passing line, has not been forced to any compromise of her standards and deportment. Whatever our views of Deianeira's resolve in the play as a whole, I think we should recognize that the dramatist has constructed this brief scene in such a manner that she is not reduced to acting in a way that would diminish her stature as Heracles' queen and wife (see P. E. Easterling's parallel defense of her behavior in the prologue, 'Character in Sophocles,' GScR 24 [1977] 121-29, 122-23). More, in other words, is involved in Deianeira's silence in this scene than a blunt indication of her frailty, and I believe that interpretations which view the scene in this restricted manner underestimate the subtlety of Sophocles' dramaturgy and character portrayal.</page></plain_text>
