<plain_text><page sequence="1">Giuseppe Mazzotta Bruno's Radical Critique of Humanism Introduction By the time he died in Campo dei Fiori on February 17, 1600, Giordano Bruno had by all accounts — whether because he was delusional or simply to shield himself against the pain of the flames that would burn him alive — an absolute faith in his destiny. Like a winged Icarus in his flight out of the labyrinth, as one reads in Degli eroici furori (Part 1, dialogue 3), he was sure he too would unfold his wings and reach the heights of philosophical speculation (193). Tansillo's sonnet, "Poi che spiegate ho l'ali al bel desio," makes a subtle point about the frenzy of love pushing the soul out of the labyrinth toward the stars, and Bruno appropriates it for his speculations on love-mania: Poi che spiegate ho l'ali al bel desio, quanto più sott'il piè l'aria mi scorgo, più le veloci penne al vento porgo, e spreggio il mondo, e vers'il ciel m'invio. Né del figliuol di Dedalo il fin rio fa che giù pieghi, anzi via giù risorgo, ch'i' cadrò morto a terra ben m'accorgo: ma qual vita pareggia al morir mio? La voce del mio cor per l'aria sento, "Ove mi porti temerario? Chissà, che raro è senza duol tropp'ardimento." "Non temer", respond'io, "l'alta ruina. Fendi sicur le nubi, et muor contento; s'il ciel sì illustra morte ne destina." (Degli eroici furori, I, dialogue 3, 193) (Now that toward beauty I have spread my wings,/ the more I see the air beneath my feet the higher to the wind my proud wings fly ,/ and the whole world I scorn, and seek the sky./ Nor can the tragic end of Icarus / relent my flight — it makes me higher go./ That I shall soon fall down and die, I know:/ but which man's life can equal such a death?/ The voice of my own heart cries in the air:/ "Where do you take me, reckless one! Fly down,/ for sorrow comes to those who too much dare."/ "Fear not," I answer, "the profound Annali d'italianistica 26 (2008).

In his quest for the mind's absolute contemplation of ever distant essences (or of self-definition and self-assertion), Icarus finds himself at the edge of an abyss and falls to his noble death. The myth of the labyrinth (which the sonnet recalls simultaneously from the viewpoint of both the successful flight of Daedalus and the fall of his son Icarus) runs deep in Bruno's vision. Like a background light, it reveals the logical intricacies of his thought, his perpetual flight to transcendence and concomitant consciousness that there is no escaping the world of immanence. In Degli eroici furori he can never fly above the dark colors of the labyrinth of love. Thus, Bruno cast himself as a latter-day Icarus undaunted by his tragic failure, and he believed that he was not understood in his own time, but that the fire of his new ideas — his nova philosophia — would dazzle future generations. Posterity has certainly elevated Bruno's tragic death to the status of a decisive event in the history of philosophy and has made his thought the stepping stone over the threshold of the modern world. He understood his own enterprise, and his most faithful interpreters today correctly stress his self consciousness in the effort to overturn the ideas of his more or less immediate predecessors (Ciliberto; Ordine).2 Cusanus, Ficino, Pico, Luther as well as Aquinas and Aristotle, so he thought, were caught in obsolete schemes of transcendence and in false dualisms and oppositions between the finite and the infinite. Unlike them, Bruno chose to depict a world locked in the total immanence of Nature, which he saw as a vast enclosure without exit or escape. And he raised a set of questions regarding values, freedom and a new ethics.3 In this essay I am going to focus on these questions and on Bruno's radical critique of Neo-Platonic and classical humanism, and will analyze one of the Opere 1 The translation is available in Tusiani, Poets of the Renaissance 217. 2 "A differenza di altri padri della 'modernità', Bruno procede dalla 'scienza' alla 'magia'; dalla ricerca gnoseologica e cosmologica a un programma di integrale riforma della civiltà [...]" (Ciliberto 12). The "subversive" nature of Bruno's thought is emphasized also by Ordine in"La cosmologia e la filosofia della natura. Cena, De la causa, De l'Infinito" {La soglia dell'ombra. 71-92). 3 On this important aspect see the volumes of Badaloni, Ciliberto, and Ordine.</page><page sequence="3">Bruno 's Radical Critique of Humanism 173 magiche recently edited by Michele Ciliberto, the Lampas Triginta Statuarum, and one of the Italian philosophical dialogues, the Cabala del cavallo Pegaseo. The Lampas Triginta Statuarum and Bruno's Critique of Classical Humanism The question of the possibility of freedom in the context of nature — leaving aside for the time being whether this nature is historical (particular, concrete) or the unalterable, inescapable world of physical reality — is at the core of the Lampas Triginta Statuarum (1587).4 Written in a predictable and yet rare spirit of boldness, the texts are connected by a common set of concerns: the relation between cosmology and ethics, the nature of freedom and its relation to materiality, an innovative view of man's place in the cosmos, and the role of memory in human consciousness. In the process — from the perspective of the dynamic model etched by Lucretius's Epicureanism — Bruno dispels a number of illusions that have shaped the tenets and figurations of Neo-Platonic Humanism. The Lampas begins with two metaphors Bruno subtly correlates to each other. It is first of all a philosophical banquet whereby the knowledge the text administers turns into food for the soul. Second, it presents itself as a journey, as the map of an itinerary on the harsh road leading the mind from sensible experience through imaginative forms (the thirty statues as memory-images) to philosophical contemplation. A fine conceptual thread binds and complements the two images involving, respectively, body and soul. If the metaphor of food suggests, in Aristotelian terms, the body's process of assimilation of knowledge (the act by which what is different and outside is internalized and changed into the same) as if it were a physical process, the metaphor of the journey of investigation focuses on the ongoing, relentless quest of the mind, the end of which is neither univocal nor to be ever taken for granted. Appropriately, the Lampas ends by evoking and discarding the literal interpretation of the Bible in Luther's De servo arbitrio (1525) and by stressing the unavoidable ambiguities in the interpretation of symbols and images, the need for an ongoing deciphering of their inexhaustible contents. This dynamics of Bruno's philosophical investigation rests on a literary cosmological model: Lucretius's De rerum natura. The aim of his quest is to crack open the secret origins of the universe and to derive from such a knowledge, much as Lucretius does, an understanding of the desirable norms by which human beings ought to live. By adopting an objective and problematical stance, as if the philosopher were standing outside the flow of time (which, in effect, makes him step beyond his own subjective, dynamic perspective), Bruno transports himself backwards or forward in time and evokes three degrees of originary shapelessness, three modes lying beyond all figuration: Chaos, Orcus, 4 In the body of the text the citations from Giordano Bruno's Lampas Triginta Statuarum refer to the paragraph number.</page><page sequence="4">174 Giuseppe Mazzotta and Night. Undefined, homogeneous and unlimited, Chaos, characterized as a void, as a receptable, and as passive and inert matter untouched by either passion or action, is nothing and has nothing in itself ("Deinde in ipsum nichil est [...] nihil habet" par. 946). This concept of "avaricious" nothingness (the term is Bruno's) marks a deliberate reversal of both the Pseudo-Dionysius's and Dante's views of a generous, productive nothing and casts Chaos as a stranger to any difference and concordance. Lumped with it, there is Orcus, an "avid" abyss or void, akin to a gravitational force. Nothing escapes its grasp and it inexorably pulls all things to itself in its "desideratio infinita." But in the darkest Night of the cosmos the seeds of the universe are sown. The generative process gets going as if in a frenzy of incandescent magma in the crater of a volcano. Particles swirl and collide. Like seeds and eggs in the concave receptacle of a woman, messy shapes cluster together, emerge at random, and the fire emits a faint glow. The myth of the Night as the bearer of light and form recalls Aristotle's Metaphysics (13), where the opinions of those theologians for whom all things are generated by the night are recorded. But Bruno's cosmology is not Aristotle's. It is rooted, as are the naturalist constructions of Epicurus and Lucretius, in violence, and it both follows and deviates from Lucretius's vision of blind contingency in De rerum natura. Following in the footsteps of Epicurus's discoveries about first beginnings in De rerum natura (5, 91-135), Lucretius brackets any idea of the divine origin of the universe and makes nature both the artisan and the artifact (5, 186). Without any mythological machinery, Lucretius expands how all that exists results from the random movement, from a chance coming together and perpetual renovation of atoms (5, 795) carried along by their own weight till they finally die. Lucretius's myth articulates the whole movement of history. We read that the first beginnings were shapeless and discordant; that in time the parts arranged themselves in the living body of the visible universe with the firmament, the succession of the seasons, and the generation of animal life and mortal diseases, in their precarious place. Later, human beings emerged in these surroundings; they dwelt in caves, without laws, fearful of wild beasts (5, 950 1004) and in constant danger of death, which Lucretius renders by the alliteration of liquid sounds: "dulcia linquebant labentis lumina vitae" (5, 989; "They leave the sweet light of lapsing life"). Language, civilization, cities and friendship, religion and eventually power and wealth developed out of the need for concord and a firm foundation on which to stand. These achievements were made possible by great men and kings, although the principles of true wisdom (peace of mind, the dispelling of ignorance and fears) come from the Epicurean philosopher. An ethics of the fragility of "concord" is upended against the stark chaos of origins. Lucretius's representation of the world as a living body became a staple of Renaissance naturalism. It stands behind the animism of Telesio and</page><page sequence="5">Bruno 's Radical Critique of Humanism 175 Campanella {De sensu rerum et magia) as well as the "new philosophy" and the occult sciences (Hermeticism, panpsychism, magic, etc.) that opposed the Aristotelian-Scholastic conception of physics. Bruno's philosophical naturalism, wherein the "human" never exceeds the bounds of Nature and yet dwells in an infinite, dynamic, and living universe, in which nothing dies and all changes, retrieves, and mixes together ancient Epicurean doctrines with both Pythagorean and Neo-Platonic views. His radicalism consists, as a matter of fact, in his effort to encompass all intellectual strains that probe the depths of existence (origins, movements, passions, and ends). In a way, Bruno's adventurous excursions into disparate realms of the philosophical tradition reflect his own life's peregrinations — from his native Nola to Naples, and from Rome to Paris, London, Geneva, Frankfurt, Venice, and back to Rome. And both his intellectual curiosity and his travels give more than a hint of the openness of his mind, his imaginative flights out of the narrow prison of partial views into the airy freedom of thinking. In the Lampas Triginta Statuarum the unrepresentable tripartition of Chaos, Orcus, and Night (though the names assigned to them and their distinction — the "statue of the Night" — paradoxically give them a form and a figure) is balanced by a higher tripartite sequence, which is Neo-Platonic in origin. The corresponding superior triad consists of the infigurable Mind, Apollo, and Spirit or light. The correlation between the higher and the lower hierarchies does not entail the reduction of mind to matter and vice versa. Rather, a hierarchy of values or a pattern of degrees extends from the vortices of physical reality to the centripetal order of the immaterial intellect. Deploying the mystical formula, available from Cusanus's De docta ignorando (1, 23), that God is the infinite sphere "whose center is everywhere and whose circumference nowhere," Bruno makes Mind the infinite sphere (par. 58). From it all things derive as if from another nature (par. 61), and, though it is the whole, it nonetheless lives separate from all and is knowable by a finite, human intelligence not directly but as if in a mirror (Ficino, Theologia Platonica 6, 2). Next to the Mind of the Father Bruno locates Apollo (Par. 97-108), source of life, "center of the microcosm," and intellect as it manifests itself in human beings. Unlike Orcus, who is wrapped in the fog of darkness, Apollo conceals himself in the haze of light and gives out its own light according to the particular capacity of entities to receive it. This third principle of light, also known as the Platonic and (Neo-Platonic) "anima mundi," penetrates all entities without ever mixing with their substances. This philosophical and fabulous myth of material Chaos on one end and Intellect or Mind on the other centers on man as the fleetingly converging point of the two different, and divergent, forces or realities, body and soul, matter and consciousness. Within the horizon of the "scala naturae" (par. 308), the philosopher — Bruno himself — opens up and has the intellectual power to travel the route of knowledge from one end of the spectrum to the other, goes up and down, and sees the whole conspectus of contradictory impulses. The place</page><page sequence="6">176 Giuseppe Mazzotta man occupies in the world of nature as well as man's fate remain always uncertain and to be decided. Thus, the Lampas Triginta Statuarum shifts its focus and takes on the form of an educational tract in order to redefine the Neo Platonic ladder of ascent to the Good, rè-figure man's place in an infinite cosmos, and teach man how to confront heroically an alien world. To the notion of the unrepresentable, figureless, and formless matter and intellect with which the text started, Bruno now juxtaposes a paradigm of knowledge traced through the representation of a Tree of Knowledge (par. 323) and through the figuration of thirty statues, their source and purpose. By gathering the sediments of meaning contained in these images, and always described in metaphorical terms, Bruno suggests that what a man can learn in his journey of discovery cannot be concealed either from his eyes or from the variously soft light and burning flame of the imagination. The seductive gesture about the inevitability and accessibility of knowledge introduces his hermeneutics of the statues. After describing and speculating on the lowest triad (Chaos, Orcus, and the "statue" of the Night) and the highest triad (Intellect, Apollo, and Light), Bruno moves on to the statue of Saturn (par. 109), the god born of Caelum, and then describes the symbolic meanings of some other figures. One of them is the statue of Prometheus (par. 119), who is evoked through its widest mythological and traditional resonances. For instance, Prometheus appears as the figure of the architect, of the artist and inventor of techne, who steals the fire of the gods and, as a punishment, is "chained" (par. 123, 17) on the Caucasus till he is freed by Mercury's caduceus. Next to it stands the statue of Vulcan (par. 127), who though he himself is lame and deformed (par. 138), is the symbol of fire and molder of figures. He is linked to painting and sculpture (he is the maker of Pandora's box). Tethys, the figure lying under all shapes, who can change form — she becomes, for instance, a tiger and generates Achilles and Clitia (Ovid's Metamorphoses 2, 260-75) —, follows Vulcan. The mythological images Bruno recollects and interprets in a philosophical key echo mythographers, such as Fulgentius, Boccaccio's Genealogy of the Gentile Gods and, I would like to suggest, Natale Conti's Mythologiae (1582), glossing on Vulcan, Caelum, Prometheus, and other pagan gods. But Bruno is not just another allegorizer of myth bent on recounting the multiple associations of each fable. His approach focuses on the imaginative links between myth and memory. Like memory, each statue contracts into one form several symbolic dimensions of meaning, which in fact depend on the stratifications of time. In short, Bruno's statues resist being catalogued as faint, weak duplicates of reality. They crystallize vital memory-images, symbolic forms that materialize, preserve, and actualize the past, and through their survival we come to the recognition of how wisdom accrues in time, how the past flows into the present. Bruno's educational purpose, thus, consists in recovering and forging the "thirty" virtual associations of each memory-image and its interaction with other</page><page sequence="7">Bruno 's Radical Critique of Humanism ill images as immemorial resources of the mind opposing time's inexorable erasures.5 To this educational end and to justify his belief in the didactic value of icons, he even includes, in a truly baroque fashion, a critique of the iconoclasm heralded by and rampant in the most advanced circles of the Protestant Reform. It is possible to take to task Bruno's notion of images and memory by noting that he stresses their contemplative aspects and apparently fails to provide (as Vico, for instance, will do) a constructivist account of history and "personality" or agency (Mazzotta 206-33). But the objection can be overturned. As befits a philosopher, Bruno's contemplative stance prevails (his eye circles around the statues and sees them in their virtual totality), yet he recognizes the derivation of ethics from memory habits — what Scholastic psychology calls habitus — and their importance in our relation to the world. The unfolding of the text follows rigorously this logical structure. From paragraphs 181 to 306, the Lampas ranges from the discussion of "bonitas" (natural and moral good) to Vesta, mother of Astraea (a moral good) generating Justice and coloring ethics, politics, and economics, to order in the universe, virtue and power, to Demogorgon as principle of relation, to "concord," reason, will, and charity6. Within the logic of the text, the cosmological and physical problems marking the beginning of the text are brought down to the realm of ethics and are the foundation of this ethics. The radical relation between knowledge and action, between chance and justice, between cosmology — its Chaos, its void, and its night — and the ethics of justice, order, and generation that apparently contradict the cosmology, is formulated through the statue of Thetys, the most beautiful daughter of Earth and Sky (par. 149). As a composite, Thetys gathers within herself matter and light, and becomes the material cause or principle from which emanate other divinities. Finally, as a principle of all things, she is the element of water capable of fashioning itself into disparate and multiple forms. Following the account in Ovid's Metamorphoses (11, 250), Hyginus (Fabulae 54), Boccaccio (Genealogy of the Gentile Gods 12) and Conti (Mythologiae), Bruno figures Thetys naked, as she metamorphoses into a tiger, a wing, a tree, and a snake. In this sense, Bruno says, she recalls Anaxagoras's Chaos (par. 154, 18), in which the seed of forms is contained. We are also told that she married Peleus, and from their marriage Achilles was born. At their wedding all the gods attended, except for one, Litis or Discord ( Genealogy of the gentile Gods 12, 50, 2-3), who threw the golden apple to the guests. Discord tragically appears in the midst of a feast, excluded and yet irrepressible. Yet, from the marriage of Thetys to Peleus were born Achilles and Clitia (Metamorohoses 4, 234), who is first 5 See the symbolic value of the number 30; the reference is to Dante's "thirty" in the sonnet "Guido, i' vorrei" as well as Purgatorio 30 and Paradiso 30. It is the number of Beatrice and the power of her seduction. 6 Bruno writes that Demorgon is the ori self-sufficient nature constitutes the totality of all possible things (par. 225). 6 Bruno writes that Demorgon is the original principle through which the absolute and</page><page sequence="8">178 Giuseppe Mazzotta loved by Apollo (or light) and later abandoned by him. Because she is deprived of light, she is identified with the moon, variously luminous and dark, and divided against herself. The analysis of the figure of Thetys cannot claim to offer the conspectus of Bruno's ethics. Nonetheless, she opens up to our view the contradictory pulls within his ethical vision. More than that, Thetys is not confined within fixed boundaries nor can she be grasped in and by herself as a self-defined and self identical entity. Because she changes, Proteus-like, into multiple forms, she needs a limit to contain her transgressions and overflowing, and Peleus, the human being the goddess marries, stands for the limit to her divine diffusiveness. In brief, Bruno gives her fabulous figuration what can be called an agonistic interpretation. "Agon" describes the quintessential trait of Bruno's persistent polemical voice and sustains the movement of most of his texts (such as La cena delle ceneri and Spaccio della bestia trionfante). Indeed, the "agonal" thrust of his rhetoric acquires a paradigmatic status in his ethical and cognitive views and it conveys his sense that authentic knowledge is attained through a confrontation of contrary postures and stances. New ideas necessarily displace and dismantle old, entrenched beliefs, and in the process they even reveal the hidden kinship between the old and the new. In the Lampas, however, the discordant note does not belong to Bruno's style or authorial voice. Quite to the contrary, contentiousness or "Litis" partakes of the myth and shapes the myth's eventual tragic outcome. "Litis," also known in Greek religion as Eris, the winged and wicked goddess of disputations and controversies, daughter of the Night, who sows discord (as well as the noble desire for emulation and primacy) at the marriage of Peleus and Thetys, recalls the violence at the origin of things. And Bruno even confers on Discord an epistemological value: Discord cannot be dissociated from and actually coexists with the principle of sameness and order. In its eristic, divisive powers, Discord introduces, as René Girard has shown in his work on "la mimétologique," the very principle of difference and knowledge within the grid of homogeneity of forms. The fundamental ethical project of locating the "difference" (on which hinges the question of values and meanings) in the homogeneous, non hierarchical pattern of beings is staged a few paragraphs down in the movement of the Lampas (par. 317, 15, 19). We arrive here at Bruno's most radical philosophical formulation, and this formulation concerns his understanding of the nature of man. If Ovid's myth of Thetys celebrates the wedding between man and goddess in its tragic and unpredictable consequences (Discord, the Trojan War, etc.), Bruno claims that no natural intrinsic or ontological difference exists between men and beasts. The opinion recalls Aristotle's own denial of a difference between men and other animals (De partibus animalium, 4, 5, 680 b-681 a). By this statement, Bruno unleashes a frontal attack against the tradition of classical humanism. Pico's</page><page sequence="9">Bruno 's Radical Critique of Humanism 179 theses in his Heptaplus and Tasso's re-description of the Genesis in II mondo creato (1594), with their shared conception of the dignity of man, are abandoned. What for Pico accounts for man's dignity and privilege within the economy of creation, especially as De Dignitate Hominis puts it, is man's freedom and freedom of the will. This ontological freedom guarantees transcendence from the shackles of the world of immanence. Unlike Pico or Tasso, Bruno does not distinguish sharply between the human and the inhuman: "Et forte maior differentia est inter istos, quam sit inter idiotas homines et equos et elephantes " (par. 317, 15, 19; "In fact, a larger difference exists among them [i.e. men] than exists between idiotic men and horses and elephants"). The statement encapsulates the core of Bruno's "new philosophy," which now appears as the creation of radically new, man-made values. The determinist domain of nature (as the kinship between men and animals shows) annuls the Humanists' classical hierarchy and it reveals that freedom is neither identical with the essence of man nor is the property or foundation of his being. Yet freedom is not disavowed by what could be called Bruno's version of amor fati. Freedom, the condition of moral life, becomes the possession of the philosopher and his elite disciples capable of going up and down the scala naturae (par. 308). As such, it coincides with the philosopher's knowledge of the Chaos steadily lying at the heart of apparent structures of order. A different rank-ordering based on the new scientific, Lucretian paradigm of knowledge is put in place in the Lampas. This new rank-ordering had been advanced, for instance, in La cena delle ceneri with its derision of the old, Ptolemaic structures of thought (i.e., the pompous rhetoric of the Oxford professors), which Bruno wants to supersede in the light of the new Copernican science. As stated earlier, Lucretius's sage — the man-philosopher — who still belongs to the material world, counters, heroically, the physical laws of nature. This perspective allows Bruno to dismantle both Ficino's and Pico's Neo Platonic hierarchy of entities leading to the mind of God. In De rerum naturae (5, 50) Lucretius's philosopher Epicurus, the poet's spiritual guide and superior intellect, stokes the never extinguished fires of atheism, teaches both the progress of the arts and sciences and the mortality of the world, purges the mind of superstition and fear, stresses the atomic chaos of nature and the inexistence of fabled Centaurs, and preaches that true piety resides in understanding and peace of mind (5, 1040-45). Bruno's "hero" also stands over and against the ordinary levels of existence, and, in this sense, his stance evokes an aristocratic morality for the enlightened happy few. More precisely, the hero — the "man" made perfect "per scientias speculativas" (par. 317, 19) — is a version of Lucretius's sage, who enjoys a universal perspective, and who, godlike, breaks down the chains of natural determinism and prescribes values ex novo. Theology, one can say, is thus philosophized (to put it in terms of the traditional attack against Aquinas as an</page><page sequence="10">180 Giuseppe Mazzotta Averroist). To say it differently, Bruno empties of any substantiality the theological frame of reference, yet he is forced to keep it as a formal structure of thought. The all too apparent contradiction, however, does not puzzle him. Yet, for all this secular, anthropomorphic vision, a question lingers: how does the philosopher-hero, who is part and parcel of the unavoidable reality of immanence, attain a superior vantage point allowing him to transcend the level of immanence in which he abides? And since all objective ethics is impossible in his universe, how do his ethical choices take place and find a justification? Is it conceivable that Bruno is obliquely re-proposing Machiavelli's myth of Chiron, the Centaur, half man and half beast, and teacher of Achilles (The Prince, chapter 18) as the figuration of the philosopher's power? The answer to these questions can be found in his Cabala del cavallo pegaseo, where the Christian paradigm of creation is replaced by the Pythagorean cosmology of the eternal transmigration of souls or the doctrine of metempsychosis. The Cabala del cavallo pegaseo or Philosophy as Literature Structurally, the Cabala del cavallo pegaseo gives itself as a Menippean satire (a combination of poetry and philosophy). It opens up with a dedicatory epistle to Don Sapatino, who is acknowledged as "vescovo," a word from the Greek episkopos or overseer. The title, in the tone at once playful and contemptuous Bruno adopts, casts the recipient of this gift, Don Sapatino, as one who has achieved the skopos, a word meaning the perspective of all perspectives or a synoptic vision. Don Sapatino is endowed with a total knowledge: "[...] con enciclopedico vostro ingegno [...] par che abbracciate il tutto [...]" (9; "with your encyclopedic mind [...] you can embrace the whole"). To him, Bruno sends a book that joins "cabala, teologia e filosofia [...] dico una cabala di teologica filosofica, una teologia di filosofia cabalistica.? [...] avete tutto del niente in parte, parte del tutto nel niente, niente de la parte in tutto" (9; "kabbalah, theology and philosophy, a cabal of theological philosophy, a theology of cabalistic philosophy, [...] you possess the whole of nothing in art, a part of the whole in nothing, nothing of the part in the whole"). The hybrid, playful definition brings to light the central purpose of the dialogue: to foster a conceptual break across fragmentary divisions of disciplines of knowledge. Bruno wills to forge a connection among three distinct disciplines: rationality, revelation, and kaballah, a Hebrew term meaning "tradition" and designating the oral, esoteric strain of secret knowledge that also shapes Pico's Heptaplus (1489). There Pico argues that in the work of the six days Moses had gathered all human knowledge which the various philosophies (Plotinus, Aristotle, Scotus, Maimonides, Porphyry, etc.) had sought to hunt down. Bruno, by contrast, makes the Socratic mystical principle of learned ignorance the center of all knowledge: what joins them is the principle of "asininity," a mixture of wisdom and ignorance, each the path to the other, as Bruno read in Nicholas of Cusa's De docta ignorando (On Learned Ignorance).</page><page sequence="11">Bruno 's Radical Critique of Humanism 181 Three characters, Sebasto (whose name suggests the sense of "the one who is self-sufficient"); Coribante (who in ancient mysteries appears literally as an "enthusiast" or possessed by God), priest of Cybele, following her in her nightly wanderings and revelries; and Saulino. The latter is Bruno's "persona," and the name recalls the apostle Saul/Paul. The name's diminutive casts him as the self ironical mask of the small latter-day apostle to modern Gentiles: unlike Paul preaching Christ to the Athenian philosophers, Saulino/Bruno addresses those in need of philosophical enlightenment. A more general point is made by the use of masks. In Bruno's literary-philosophical theatre masks are not just fictional disguises of identities; rather, they make manifest the ceaseless metamorphoses of all identities. Ironically, Sebasto, more than self-sufficient, lacks knowledge, while Coribante, a pedant frozen in the grammar of the learned language(Latin), categorizes knowledge according to clear-cut scholastic distinctions; Saulino, finally, bears the new philosophical knowledge to latter day's unbelievers. Another character, Onorio explains the theory of metempsychosis to Sebasto, who wonders whether this doctrine, which entails the cosmological hypothesis of the wholeness of the universe and of all living reality within it, resembles Ovid's theory. He quotes a passage taken from the section devoted to the teachings of Pythagoras: [...] spiritus eque feris humana in corpora transit, inque feras noster, nee tempore deperit ullo [...] (Metamorphoses 15, 167-68) [...] the Spirit passes from the body of beasts to that of men,/ from ours to that of beasts, but it never perishes. (Trans. Frank Justus Miller) Since everything in the Ovidian world of transformations is interrelated, Pythagoras's ethical prescriptions presuppose the common bond between men and beasts and express themselves through a vegetarian diet. Yet, at the core of Pythagorean mysteries lies the joyous belief in the unreality of finitude and death. In his universe all things change, but nothing dies. Time is a river, and the hours flow by like water, forever fugitive and forever new. In this process of perpetual renewal, the seasons of life resemble the seasons of the year, the heavens and the earth change, and human beings are winged spirits with the power to enter animal forms and vice versa. If nothing ever ends nor really begins, how do we account for death and birth? Is there a decisive break in history? What is the value of the contingent, historical individualities? And how can Bruno affirm the existence of an individualized, though common, privileged, totalizing perspective (and, therefore, the value of his "Nolan" philosophy)? The Cabala del cavallo pegaseo relentlessy articulates these concerns by pondering the production of differences in the midst of the flux of forms. In the "Dialogo Secondo" (89-113) Onorio recounts the sequence of the</page><page sequence="12">182 Giuseppe Mazzotta various metamorphoses, from donkey to Pegasus to man. His narrative depends on and retrieves the exercise of memory as the key to consciousness. He recalls his past existence as a donkey, his fall from a high cliff while plucking a thistle, his roaming as a disembodied spirit till he reaches the banks of Lethe, the river of forgetfulness. Multitudes of souls wash in its water the stains of the past and the particularities of their memories, and, by drinking from it, their past identities are washed away, lulled to sleep in their unconsciousness. Onorio, however, preserves the memory of his past, becomes conscious of himself in so far as he is the bearer of memory, by cheating. He only pretends to drink from Lethe, resumes his journey through the Gate of Horn (Aeneid 6.894-95), and reaches the Parnassus, where he becomes Pegasus, the winged horse of poetty. As Pegasus, he helps Bellerophon to kill the Chimera and takes Perseus to the rescue of Andromeda from a sea-monster. Eventually, Pegasus becomes a constellation in the sky at the boundary of Andromeda, the Swan (Cygnus, which is the name of the melodious singer), the Fishes, and Aquarius. Onorio's adventure — recounted, appropriately, as a journey ("presi il cammino," "venni a ritrovarmi nel Parnaso" etc., 91) — gives a sharp focus to Bruno's central ideas: this world is not just a human world; the soul is common to men, flies, and plants, and all spirits belong together in Amphitrite (91), one of the Nereides and the goddess of the sea. Onorio's "journey" of discovery through forms of life and identities (he becomes a philosopher, a poet, a pedant, a rhetorician a politician, etc., 108-13) marks the path to philosophic enlightenment. All these changes mean that we cannot expect to find man's definitive place in the fluid scheme of things, for, in point of fact, the Copernican revolution (as well as the notion of infinity of the universe) has erased the boundaries of astronomical space. We can only expect to bring to a head the reality of man's homelessness. We are steadily at sea, never on firm land, and are, thus, denied the false security of apparent order. The impending shadow of Chaos envelops the destiny of each man. Riding Pegasus as it floats on air, the heroes Bellerophon and Perseus grapple with their respective monsters, for they too live in the twilight of dangers, and night deepens around them and in them. For Valla and Pico, the Augustinian insight into the unquiet heart's displacement (we always inhabit a place other than our own) is the ground on which the ontology of liberty is rooted. We are free in the measure in which we are displaced and are, thus, forced to find our way. Bruno, like Pomponazzi in his De fato, libero arbitrio, et praedestinatione, is skeptical about this "ontology" of freedom. He sees freedom as the consequence of a deliberate usurpation, the crafty act of cheating oneself out of the cycle of the repetitive, labyrinthine circularity of the flow of forms. Onorio's cheating is an experience that belongs to the arsenal of Greek virtue and ingenuity and to the tricks of their gods: think of Prometheus's thievery of fire highlighted in the Lampas, of</page><page sequence="13">Bruno 's Radical Critique of Humanism 183 Mercury the trickster, or of Odysseus's craftiness. Onorio's transgression of the law of nature, the metempsychosis within which all forms move and yet are perpetually imprisoned and immobilized, stands as the absolute break with the norms of naturalism. It frees us from the chains of fatality and opens up the possibility of a novelty (which is the essence of freedom) by the preservation of one's past memories. Above all, Onorio's fraud, against all objective ethics, shows that one's world stems from one's will and becomes an assertion of liberty against dire necessity. The emphasis on Onorio's invention, the primacy given to memory and magic, and the centrality of Pegasus, reveal and capture the paradigm at the core of Bruno's philosophical thought. The model of his new philosophy, of his ideas about man's rotation along the circle of life (as if it were the wheel of Fortune), of time's ceaseless becoming, is the metaphorical language of literature. He understood philosophy as literature. Retrospectively, we can understand the frequent references to metaphorical language, to the exchange on language between Sebasto, Coribante, and Saulino at the opening of the Cabala del cavallo pegaseo. One example will suffice. Sebasto says: "E il peggio che diranno che metti avanti metaffore, narri favole, raggioni in parabole, intessi enigmi, accozzi similitudini, tratti misteri, mastichi tropologie" (51 ; "The worst they will say is that you set forth metaphors, tell fables, reason in parables, weave enigmas, mix together similes, treat mysteries, and chew tropologies"). And we can now grasp why the Lampas Triginta Statuarum puts into relief the domain of images as well as the value of metaphors even in the polysemy of the Biblical text (par. 360). Conclusion The literary model for Bruno's thought and ethics (which he singles out as the locus of the relation between theory and practice crucial to the two texts we have discussed above) shows, first of all, his conviction that literature is the language of ethics. It shows the inadequacy of mathematical physics (such as Galileo's and Spinoza's geometry), whereby philosophers posit the eternal order of the cosmos rather than see it as a construction in order to make the world intelligible, but not "true." It shows that what stands between bondage, mastery, and freedom is the power of discourse to assert one's viewpoint; that literature, as the work of discovery as production (a term to be understood as a manifestation of energy and passion), embodies the possibility of self-invention, of masks of the self, and of the selfs endless transformations. Within the domain of poetry and literature, the ethics of man's proximity and familiarity with beasts, of a perfect knowledge, of the eternal return (whereby all things are the same and yet forever different and "other"), and of death and life each endlessly arising from the other, as from the ashes of the Phoenix, are imaginable. In this sense, literature is the dream of all the magic wonders of life and one in which all discordant discourses are placated. The literary model</page><page sequence="14">184 Giuseppe Mazzotta dramatizes a pursuit of and hunt for elusive knowledge: the sciences for Bruno clear the space for a sharper perspective on ourselves and on the universe. And yet literature shows human beings forever standing at the periphery of the circle of knowledge, where knowledge is shadowed and they themselves are shadows on the verge of vanishing, without leaving a trace, as Sebasto's wife does ('Cabala del cavallo Pegaseo, "Dialogo Terzo"). More than that, literature has the power to shape chaos into a perspective, chance into design, and teaches the philosopher to will away what does not fit his system of self-enclosed revelations. Finally, literature's obliquities give access to the fiery visionariness linked with contemplatives and mystics. For all the hunger he feels for the absolute, which no crumbs falling from the table of philosophical banquets can satiate, Bruno is no mystic: he believes in the unity of all things and seeks to transcend all limitations, but he does so as a man of letters would. He spurs his readers to undertake a journey of rational ascent up the ladder of nature, but he lacks the mystic's wish for self effacement: he wants to be everywhere, to endlessly start his texts over and over again, to postpone all beginnings, which he quickly interrupts in order to set his hand on a new project, on a new challenge or provocation coming to him from the sciences of physics, geometry, logic, arts of memory, Egyptology, kaballah, and what not.7 But if he was not a mystic, even a mystic of an immanent nature, he was something of a prophet-teacher, one who descends or falls from the heights in order to deliver his message, and who, as he falls down, denounces and destroys the illusions of an old world in hopes that from the chaos ensuing the destruction he himself caused and imagined, a new world and a new ethics of knowledge and ignorance together could emerge. From this viewpoint, Giordano Bruno's radical critique of classical humanism draws on the tradition of the Dominican order within which he was trained in Naples while growing up and which he left, when he wandered from place to place all over Europe, not to seek knowledge but to tell his reluctant hosts what he already knew. The Dominican tradition is made of pure rational philosophers who apparently eschew poetry; and yet they are the ones who most radically rebel against reason's constructions that are at the core of classical humanism. The Dominican philosophers push back the limits of one's place in the infinity of cosmos and turn into heretical visionaries, carry heaven and earth all mixed up in their heads, and pay for it dearly: Catherine of Siena, Girolamo Savonarola, and Tommaso Campanella. Giordano Bruno belongs to this list of rationalists-turned-visionaries. Like them, and like Aquinas, he engages in poetry. And like Albert the Great and Thomas, Friar Giordano makes his "place" — however precarious — the illusory center of the world, and in the process he raises man's crucial ethical questions, such as "how we should act" and "what 7 For a recent study on the pervasive and encyclopedic nature of Bruno's research see Saiber's Giordano Bruno and the Geometry of Language.</page><page sequence="15">Bruno 's Radical Critique of Humanism 185 we are." As he does so, he "sees" the inescapable contradictions lodged in the heart of the "human," forever torn between a sense of bondage and the wish for an impossible freedom, and, alone in an alien world, he recognizes in the Ovidian poetry of metamorphoses the flicker of a disappointed desire to be all, to last forever.
