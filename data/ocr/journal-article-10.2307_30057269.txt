<plain_text><page sequence="1">BUSON (from the Irish) Gabriel Rosenstock Yosa Buson (1 716-83), Haiku Master. There is probably no Haiku master, except Basho of course, whom the Japanese regard more highly than Buson. His reputation is easily defended. He was a great painter - Basho's pilgrimages were often among his themes and an excellent poet, and the painter's eye was obvious in his beautiful creations. Before we focus on his haiku - which weren't haiku at the time but hokku, the first verse of a connected component poem called renku - let us look at a fine poem of his unknown to many westerners. He met a girl - a servant girl returning to her family home and this is how the poet pictures the young woman's perceptions. BY THE BANKS OF THE KEMA, A SPRING ZEPHYR IN THE AIR Returning home this day - Leaving Osaka behind, here I am By the Nagara River A spring breeze blows The bank of the river stretches far, further still Is my native village I walk the banks, gathering herbs, And the path is bristly on the way. Are the briars so jealous They would tatter my clothes and scratch my thighs? The river is speckled with rocks I venture out and pick a fistful of parsley. Thanks to those jutting rocks The hems of my kimono remain dry 158</page><page sequence="2">IRISH PAGES The willow tree Beside the lonesome teahouse How old it's got The old woman of the teahouse, when she sees me Good luck to you, says she, and praises my appearance She has two customers who are on the point of leaving, They rattle on in the southern dialect, Throw three coins on the table as payment And leave a space for me on the bench. This boundary village has no more than two or three houses - A cat howls for its mate That does not appear Outside the fence a hen calls to her chicks. The whole world is grass. Little chickens trying to get over the fence, A few of them fail - it is too high Three paths lie ahead And through the spring grass I see a shortcut that will do me fine Dandelions bloom, groups of three and five, Here are five that are yellow, three that are white, I remember this path well I pick one of the dandelions Fondly and milky juice Ejaculates from the thin stalk I remember far-off days, the love our mother had for us, The sweet smell of spring in her bosom My springtime is over and I live in Osaka now In Whiteflower Manor by Naniwa Bridge, As a young woman I picked up city ways 159</page><page sequence="3">IRISH PAGES It was three years ago that I left my home and my little brother. A grafted plum tree, its branches blooming, the roots forgotten My home village besieged by spring, I walk ahead. Adorned with cherry trees, the path sweeps down along the bank Twilight, craning my neck, I catch a glimpse of the old abode. With her back to the door stands an old woman, my brother in her arms, Waiting for me the whole long days of spring Remember what Old Tigo said? Returning home - She is asleep, and beside her The lone parent still alive (In the Irish, Rosenstock gaelicizes Tigo to Tadhg, the personal name that also means "a poet", anglicised by Ulster Protestants as Tague, meaning a Catholic. Such is the catholicity of translation and back-translation. Managing Editor) There's a certain atmospheric sorrow there and a facility to tell a story that would remind you of the RioraT'ang poets of China and, of course,Yuso Bosun was greatly influenced by the best of Chinese culture. To the marrow. There is much that could be said about that poem. The little chickens, for example. This is an example of what is called hogan bhku, empathy with small unimportant things. It is a characteristic excellently developed by the master Issa (examples of whose work may be read in Eachtrai Krishnamurphy, 2003). 1 notice also that there is hon'&gt; here, a poetic description of a particular place. It's a masterly poem in many ways and I thought of our own spailpins and servant girls that were of other days, and all the changes they noticed on returning home. It's a universal theme that reminds me of another poem, the title poem in Peter Huchel's book, An Spealadozr Spdinneach (The Spanish Reaper) published some years ago by Comhar. There is, of course, a touch of eroticism in Buson's poem and you would expect that from this painter-poet who celebrates all the senses. It's surprising how often wandering is mentioned in classical Japanese haiku; Zen monks practised it often and Buson himself did his share of it as well: 160</page><page sequence="4">IRISH PAGIS The gate behind me I, too, am a wanderer again Autumn dusk A word that tells you which season the haiku invoives is called kigo. The season itself can be mentioned, of course, and it is often mentioned or a clue is given. If you mentioned, for example, snow drops, the reader would know that it isn't midsummer. Specialist dictionaries were published where all the signs connected with each particular season were mentioned. The four seasons, therefore, are very important as we read old haiku. I'm not sure the ancestral religion of Japan isn't involved in the matter: Shinto, where there is a close connection between supernaturalism and nature. And if the crow, say, is somewhat cheerless to look at, he often appears accordingly in autumn poems: One by one they disappear from view, crows, Autumn gloaming Everything is connected. The day is going from light and the crows are going from view. There is a poetic connection between the two things, a connection that a poet especially will recognise: Lightning flash - the sound of dew dripping from bamboo There is a mysterious sensitivity in the haiku aboxe. The quality that brings things together that have no obvious connection is called toriawase. There is a particular texture about that example, and note that there is more than one sense operating there, both seeing and listening. Autumn wind goes by the scarecrow bending with it Certain images are commoner than others in classical haiku. The scarecrow is one of them. At times it arouses amusement, at other times loneliness. I know of two books of haiku from Eastern Europe which have the scarecrow in their title. Issa was a countryman who loved fine honest people. But, as for town and suburban people: 161</page><page sequence="5">IRISH PAGES Don't speak to me of people - even the scarecrows all of them bent! Buson must have been in good humour when he jotted down this haiku: Sedge warbler his song has an extra syllable No doubt the poet's friends and disciples enjoyed that one. Buson had noticed that the bird added a syllable to his song. Of course, haiku makers count syllables - to their dying day. These death poems are called jisei. Often a haijin (a haiku master) was found on his deathbed and it was clear from the shape of his hand that counting syllables was his last act in this world. Syllables in European languages are not like the Japanese onji; that's why free haiku is practised in the West. Often about a dozen syllables will do in our haiku rather than the 7-5-7 we get in classical haiku. There are fifteen in the English version above, 16 in the one before it and the same in the one before that, but note that there are only 13 in the lightning haiku. Autumn evening a woman shines a mirror with her sleeve We know that Buson was fond of women. There is a graciousness or femininity in the above haiku. She's not a servant girl as in the long poem above. I'd say she's a noble woman, and she's cleaning the mirror to get a look at herself. Note it's an autumn evening. Leaves are withering. Is the woman trying to assure herself that she's as resplendent as she always was? That's certainly what I take from it. Haiku doesn't tell everything. It leaves us room to complete the picture. Two plum trees - wonderful their blossoming one early, the other late The painter's eye again, indeed. The haiku master opens the landscape for us, he opens our eyes for us. 162</page><page sequence="6">IRISH PAGES Sedge warbler what's all that rustling? frosty bush And he opens our ears as well. He can't see the bird but he recognises its xoice and because of the frost, there's more than the usual rustling coming from the bush. Haiku poets often speak directly to animals, to birds, to insects. In the last haiku in Issa's haiku collection (in Eachtrai Krishnamurphy) the poet is leaving and it is a good example of the hogan bhlk: I'm off start your love-making now my flies There's probably a trace of Shinto in the two haiku aboe - esteem for nature - and Buddhism teaches us to show sympathy for every perceptive thing. In the western world, you are either one thing or another, Catholic or Protestant for example. Often the people of the East have more than one belief, one person wearing the hat of Kung Fu (Confucius), the Dao's robe and Buddha's sandals. It is so with me: one system isn't enough for me. Interestingly enough, comparative study has been done recently on Animism in Japan and in Ireland. I go from A to Z - from Animism to Zen -- and I see nothing odd about that. Waterfowl changing its sleeping place- a croosting* of stones *(This was the word used in Rosenstock's native Kilfinane when boys pelted stones: from the Irish, crtustaigh. - Managing Editor) Boys out and about, probably in high spirits. If Zen-haiku were taught in Ireland's schools there'd be a big decrease in all kinds of bullying. A young trout in the valley stream there goes a bamboo leaf too A sharp glance. It's not a trout, but a young trout. I notice that this makes a difference - even if it's a subtle difference. Its being small adds to the 163</page><page sequence="7">IRISH PAGES atmosphere. Any of us would notice a fish, or the shape of a fish. The haiku poet names it. And you could certainly say that there is no such thing as triviality in the mind of the haiku poet. Every thing has its own quality, its own beauty, its own dignity, its own life - a bamboo leaf in this case. The bamboo is mentioned often in the poetry of Japan and China - in the great poetry of Riora T'ang, say, in which Basho and Buson were highly skilled. Did you ever listen to the bambu flute, the shakuhachi? Little else would bring you closer to the spirit of Japan. The Indian flute, by the way, is called bansuri. "You'll find my house where that kite is flyin" she tells him A prostitute definitely. (She's not necessarily speaking to Buson himself.) Prostitutes are found in profusion in Japanese and Chinese haiku. There's something airy, playful about that image of the kite. The year's close, almost, filth and rubbish in Sakura River The problem of waste is not a modern day one. You'd have to understand the word Sakura, perhaps, to realise the poet's amazement. It means "cherry flowers". I stayed in a hotel called that in Tokyo, the cheapest hotel in the city. The lotus are all dead how miserable the pool- winter shower He's not often as bleak as that in his haiku. Basho was really the master of bleakness. Perhaps the above piece is in homage to Basho or to Basho's spirit. Basho (a pen-name) means "banana tree" or "plantain tree". The plantain is a rough banana. The tree bears no fruit in Japan and it has a wretched look in bad weather. His disciples had a hut of plantain leaves built for Basho - the Basho- an it was called. And what did Buson do but have a hut built long after Basho's death and he called it Basho-an. Poets used to gather there for renku sessions. First frost of winter an injured white crane somewhere in the distance 164</page><page sequence="8">IRISH PAGLS Again, you'd probably have to know how beautiful a bird the white crane is, as it dances with its other half in the mating season, to grasp the pathos of this haiku. One of the most delightful pieces of music played on the shakuhachi is The Dance of the White Cranes. The willow is bare, the bright stream dried up stones in scattered confusion That is also quite bleak. However, it is a beautiful picture. How white the lotus - to pick or not to pick - the monk's dilemma Well, there you have seventeen syllables, if that's what you want 5/7/5. There's great delicacy behind this haiku. We are forever interfering with nature. This is a picture of a Zen monk about to pick a beautiful flower. But wouldn't it be better to leave it as it is and not disturb its perfection? Ambush site a butterfly alights on neck armour If flowers and women, refinement and delicacy pleased Buson, he was obviously attracted to heroism as well. The hero is probably dead in this haiku. A clawed crow or a black raven would descend on a Gaelic hero; here we have a butterfly. There's a fine contrast there. According to the modern master Shiki, Basho's haiku characteristics are manliness (yukon), strength (keiken), beguilement or delight (enre) and liveliness (kappatsusa). The wheat rneitheal sadness in the eyes of the mad woman (Meitheal is still widely used in Ireland to convey a party of reapers. Curious, is it not, that an Irish word not contained in the Irish xersions should find its way into an English back-translation.- Managing Editor) 165</page><page sequence="9">IRISH PAGES Because poets are not like other people, they have a fellow-feeling for those on the edge of society. And because poets are forever trying to take some meaning from life, they're particularly attracted to the lunatic. What does the lunatic think? What does the lunatic see? What does the lunatic hear? What does the lunatic feel? Ancient well catching mosquitoes dark fishy sound There is much happening in that haiku but there is also the unsaid thing there. A fishy sound? A poet would hear such - or a lunatic. However sharp the haiku masters are, everything in this world isn't black and white, or recognisable: Air shimmer ... the bright flight of an unknown insect White plum blossoms absorbing the colour of morning We often find in the haiku things painting each other, colouring each other, influencing each other, from season to season, from morning to night. Life and death: Flying squirrel crunching a bird's bones bare cold field Fragility and transience everywhere: Short summer night- a drop of dew on the hairy moll (Moll: one of many anthropomorphic names, in Irish and in the English of Ireland, for the caterpillar. - Managing Editor) 166</page><page sequence="10">IRISH PAGES Views and sounds that excite, or astonish, us: Walking over the dishes - such cold rattling music made by the rat's feet Things inside, things outside, and the long white roads calling him again: Farewell! I take to Kiso Road all on my own older than autumn Southern roads, on the thatched cottage, on the shrine, everywhere, swallows A couple of views, a couple of adventures along the way that would make you laugh or reflect: No underpants, suddenly arse to the wind - spring gusts Bamboo hat, straw coat, Basho come alive - freezing rain The boat has gone off Johnny come lately under winter's first shower Four or five dancers in a circle: the moon above about to fall Like many other masters, Buson succeeds in generating echoes from unusual things. For example: Young bamboo trees - the courtesan mn Hashimoto is she still there? 167</page><page sequence="11">IRISH PAGES The graciousness of the bamboos reminds him of a prostitute. Or, perhaps she has grown old? A beautiful yearning haiku. His master, Basho, couldn't write the like. Basho mentions prostitutes sure enough, but with no liking for them. It happens often in the poetry of the west that something unusual must happen before we mention it. In haiku, however, maybe there's not much at all happening, or the occasion involved so insignificant that no one but a haiku poet would consider saying anything about it: The snail has vanished - where, I wonder? not a sinner knows And here comes another snail and the discernment that we see always in the good haiku which is more than just acuteness of sight: Hit squarely by a drop of rain - the snail closes up It was only a split second, but a split second that will last as long as haiku is read.
