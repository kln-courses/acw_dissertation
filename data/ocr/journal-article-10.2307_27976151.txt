<plain_text><page sequence="1">FURTHER NOTES ON A SNAKE DANCE OF THE BAINING By GREGORY BATESON1 IN 1927 I spent some months among the Central Baining and I am 1 able to add a few notes to Mr. Read's article " A Snake Dance of the Baining " (Oceania, II, 232-236). My observations were con fined to the villages of the eastern side of the Central Baining territory, Latramat, Malabunga, etc., and the neighbourhood of Mount Taungi. I also saw something of the South and North Baining, but I did not visit the Toriu natives. I used some of the Toriu men as informants, however, and gathered that their culture was identical with that of the Mount Taungi-Latramat area. Actually it was only in the mission villages that I saw any consider able display of kavat and vwuyvwurj. There, in 1927, these miaus dances were held with fair frequency to celebrate such events as the birth of a child or the completion of a new house or church. Probably as a result of European contact, the dances were always held in the villages, not in a secret place in the forest as Mr. Read describes. I have attended these miaus dances as a member of a visiting party, and on other occasions when my own village was performing I have seen most of the preparations. Strictly speaking Mr. Read and his carriers should not have arrived at the dancing ground during the preliminary dance of women. Usually the visiting parties sit in the forest in the dark until the sounds from the dancing ground indicate that kavat and vwuyvwug have made their entry. On these occasions the forest is almost always wet with rain?made by magical means on the afternoon before the dances, in order that the women may not wander in the forest and so see the preparations?and a visiting party will wait thus for two or three hours, getting steadily wetter and colder. The carnival spirit is very much in abeyance formerly Anthony Wilkin Student, Cambridge University.</page><page sequence="2">FURTHER NOTES ON A SNAKE DANCE 335 until at last the visitors hear the sudden increase in volume of the singing which denotes the arrival of vwutjvwutj and kavat. In my area the term kavat is usually applied to the running figure (Read, Plate 2b) wearing a mask, but without a trumpet and without the curious framework and suspended red and green orna ments ; vwutjvwui) on the other hand refers to the more ungainly figure (vide Plate ia, and also Read, Plate ib) with the framework and trumpet. I shall use the terms in this way, although in Mr. Read s article these two terms are interchanged, a usage which may obtain in the Toriu area. Plate ia shows a man wearing one of these vwutjvwug masks from which the pale green and red patterns have been stripped, leaving only the headdress, trumpet and the supporting framework for the patterns. The trumpet is about four feet in length and four inches in diameter, and projects from the mouth of the figure. Like the headdress, it is covered with bark cloth upon which elaborate geometrical designs have been painted. The septa of the bamboo have been carefully removed with the exception of the end septum inside the headdress. This septum is perforated and constitutes the mouthpiece of the trumpet. The dancer applies his lips to this hole and winds the instrument as a bugle is winded. During the dance the vwutjvwug thus makes an occasional low-pitched grunt which is almost inaudible in the general uproar ; but although the sound of this trumpet is unimpressive, the fact that it can be winded at all testifies to the skill of the dancer and to the mechanical skill with which the whole structure is balanced. The red paint used on the bark cloth is usually prepared from the seeds of Bixa orellana, one of the most widespread red pigments in the Pacific region. The red material is accumulated in coconut shells and is applied with a brush made from a twig of some fibrous plant. On the other hand, the red used on the suspended ornaments is, as Mr. Read states, a mixture of blood and saliva. Inasmuch as this use of blood is an important secret of Baining stage-craft, carefully concealed from women and children, it is perhaps worth describing the process in detail. Among the Central Baining the plant used to chafe the tongue is a species of Ficus, which the authorities at Kew have identified as F. ? setistyla. The leaves are</page><page sequence="3">336 FURTHER NOTES ON A SNAKE DANCE folded and the edge of the fold is rubbed against the tongue. The blood and saliva is then spat on to the bark surface which it is intended to colour. Plate 2B shows a similar process being carried out among the South Baining (Mali dialect). The big cowl-shaped headdress is to be worn in nocturnal dances connected with mendas (initiation ceremonies associated with a cult of the dead). The cowl is made from a piece of freshly stripped bark which is folded and sewn together along one side. The rough surface is inside and the men are engaged in spitting blood on to the smooth white phloem, the whole of which is to be coloured red. On this occasion the men cut their tongues with the stem of a rough creeper and one man used a piece of bottle glass. The blood and saliva must be sprayed on to the bark by the same sort of spitting as that whereby a native scatters his betel spittle as a red cloud in the air, pressing the tongue against the upper lip as he blows. I doubt whether a satisfactory uniform paint could be got by spitting the blood into coconut shells. The tongue recovers in a surprisingly short time, but a man who had spat over three or four of these cowl-shaped headdresses was fairly exhausted. The beautiful shiny crimson so produced lasts only for one night, after which it is discarded. In the case of vwutjvwuq the headdress and trumpet with their bark cloth wrappings may be used several times, but the suspended patterns on which blood is used are stripped off and destroyed after a single performance. The suspended patterns were in Latramat usually called aios (a?os=ghost, shadow, pattern, reflection, etc.), and the same word is applied to any masked figure. Thus vwutjvwufj and kavat are themselves aios, and the patterns upon them are also aios. Two materials are used in the construction of these patterns, the unopened leaves of a species of Pandanus (not banana stems as Mr. Read supposed) and the bark on to which blood is to be spat. The whole day previous to the dances is spent by the men in the secret house cutting up these leaves and pieces of bark and sewing them together into crescents, triangles and spirals which are fixed to the vwuf/vwug. These preparations continue far into the night as it is important that the leaves and spat blood shall all be as fresh as possible. To give light for this work a resin is burnt in lumps on the ground in</page><page sequence="4">FURTHER NOTES ON A SNAKE DANCE 337 the secret house, and the scene so illuminated is strangely impressive to European eyes. As to the attachment of the artificial penis (magumbet), Mr. Read says that this is attached by means of a waist-band. In Latramat, to adopt such a method would be a piece of modern laziness. The dancer should not wear anything round his waist and the means of attaching the magumbet is another of the secrets concealed from women. The magumbet consists of a cylinder of bark cloth with a mushroom-shaped head. From the base of the cylinder the bark cloth is continued as a strip about four inches wide and four feet long. The cylinder is sewn at its base tightly to the man's pubic hair and is so held erect. The strip of bark cloth is then carried back between the legs and pinned to the skin at the base of the spine, so that the man's real genitals are held back and hidden. The free end of the strip is then transversely pleated and hangs down as a tail. The pin which holds the tail is a particular bone of a particular fish, though I have seen ordinary European needles used for this purpose. This pin, the trumpet and the use of blood are among the most important secrets of Baining dramatic ritual and therefore I have dealt with them in some detail. I believe that the making of the bark cloth is also a secret, but I never witnessed this process. To me the most striking feature of the dances which Mr. Read witnessed is the enormous number of snakes used. I have seen one or two snakes brought by kavat and given to the women, who after wards cooked and ate them, but I have never seen anything to equal the profusion of reptiles which Mr. Read records, and this alone would seem to indicate that the performance was for some greater occasion than the village rejoicings which I witnessed. In general I can add very little to what Mr. Read says of the significance of these dances. I could never collect any general statement either that the ceremonies were good for the crops or that they referred to ghosts or ancestors. The Baining are not an easy people to work among, and though they were keen enough to exhibit their dances and masks, they were very unwilling to talk about their religion. I enquired into the meaning of the patterns and the songs,</page><page sequence="5">338 FURTHER NOTES ON A SNAKE DANCE but neither of these shed any light on the significance of the cere monies as a whole. The patterns, both those on the bark cloth and those suspended from the vwut/vwurj are very various and elaborate. They are named after the most heterogeneous objects?flowers, opossums' tails, etc. But it was clear that the objects referred to had no ritual importance except as motifs for the patterns. I was even shown a fine blood-spat vwugvwug pattern which I was informed was a newly invented design and based upon a card (? the Ace of Hearts) from some cook-boy's pack. It is usual too to see a Baining native studying the white man's books and boxes with great attention?he is looking for scroll designs, trade-marks and such like, which he hopes to remember and to use as aios. Some aios are discovered by folding large leaves and cutting out pieces. The leaf is then unfolded and the resulting pattern studied. If such a pattern were adopted it would, I think, be named after some object which it faintly recalled. Thus from the name one might suppose the motif to be naturalistic, although in its origin the pattern had been purely geometrical. The richness of these patterns is the more astonishing because the Baining have almost no other decorative art. The string bags (setjanaga) carried by the women are ornamented with simple stripes and one sort of club (ma virgi) is sometimes painted with a representation of a snake. These, with a few wretched armlets and other personal ornaments, are the only other decorations indigenous to Baining culture. The material culture of this people is among the most miserable in the world, and yet it has blossomed out into the strange extravagance of these patterned headdresses. In his idle hours, when another native might ornament or carve some object, the Baining man will pick a piece of charcoal out of the fire and begin to draw geometrical patterns, rehearsing those he has seen before, or experimenting to discover new designs. Like the patterns, the songs contain no reference to ancestors or other religious concepts. They are simple little lyrics referring to incidents of daily life, to love affairs and to dreams. Some of the songs are said to be old, but new songs are continually being</page><page sequence="6">FURTHER NOTES ON A SNAKE DANCE 339 composed. The words of one song are perhaps worth quoting (from memory) : They stared at me. They stared at me. You would have said they were frogs. You would have said they were fish. This song had been composed by a young man who had been arraigned before the men of the village and beaten for rape or some similar offence against a small child. The words refer to the staring of the assembled men, but when I collected the text, about three months after the trial, the song was already included in the repertoire to be sung at miaus dances. Thus the miaus dances, patterns and songs contain little direct reference to such matters as are usually included under the heading of " religion." Even granting that the performance has many features which are symptomatic of religion?e.g., the exclusion of women from participation in the secrets, the outpouring of artistic effort and the wearing of masks?the fact remains that the only clear references to supernatural or symbolic matters are in the vocabulary used for the masked figures. The word aios is used to refer to any masked figure and in this context we may roughly translate it as " spirit " or " ghost." The word vwugvwuy, on the other hand, I regard as probably onomatopoeic, imitating the sound of the trumpet and having no reference to the supernatural. There are many other names applied to various types of masks worn at miaus or mendas ceremonies, but I suspect that the majority of these names refer to patterns and types of mask structure rather than to any supernatural beings. Three names stand out from the others in that they refer also to beings which are constantly mentioned in mythology. These three names are Kavat, ma Sega and ma Siraigi. Though Kavat is the only one of the three that I have seen, I believe that the other two are made as masks for the mendas ceremonies. In the mythology, ma Sega gana?the Sega folk?are human heroes and of them all, ma Sirini?the little Sega?is the most successful in bloody combat with the evil and fantastic Kavat folk and with the horrid hag ma Siraigi. These beings are all imagined to be human</page><page sequence="7">340 FURTHER NOTES ON A SNAKE DANCE in form, and the Kavat are described as living in single, very long houses.2 These stories are told to children and to pass the long evenings, and there is nothing in the manner of telling to suggest that they have any religious significance. But besides these secular references to anthropomorphic beings, I was once told quietly and in private that Kavat are creatures which live in certain trees, and that a man must never look up into the tree at them lest he go mad and lose his way in the forest. This statement seems to me to refer to super natural beings of some kind, whereas an oft-repeated assertion that Kavat are fruits, refers I think to mask designs rather than to supernatural beings. Father Rascher collected similar information about fruits, and at one time I thought that this corroborated the statement that Kavat live in trees. But later, among the Sulka tribe, I was shown a dancing mask which was said to be the fruit of a tree, and by good fortune I was able to see the tree in question, which has been identified as Sterculia shillinglawii. It was clear that neither the tree nor the fruit were in any way sacred or important, but that the clusters of bright red pods had inspired the design of the mask. In the light of this Sulka practice I am very sceptical as to whether the beings Kavat, Sega and Siraigi are really imagined to be fruits. There may be a mass of secret lore attached to Kavat and the other figures, and the Baining are so uncommunicative that I cannot exclude this possibility. But I am of opinion that the magico religious content of the dances is really very slight. This must not be taken to imply that the dances are without importance. When I was among the Baining I was inexperienced as a sociologist, and looking back I can see that I should have paid more attention to the economic aspects of the dances. Especially I should have studied the relation between the organizing hamlet and the visiting parties. I believe that an enquiry of this sort would reveal that the dances 2Such houses are used to this day by the Baining of the mountains behind Pondo, where the whole local group (? a patrilineal joint family) lives together in a single long house. The Central Baining live in hamlets of small round houses and do not even know of the existence of the Pondo tribe.</page><page sequence="8">^^^^^^^^^^^ A SNAKE DANCE OF THE BAINING. A.

However this may be, the dances are certainly held with great enthusiasm, and great labour is devoted to the preparations. The whole artistic energy of the people is exerted in the songs and dances, and especially in the design and decoration of the masks. If as a result of European contact these dances should cease to be held we shall have destroyed the only patch of colour in the otherwise drab existence of the Baining people.
