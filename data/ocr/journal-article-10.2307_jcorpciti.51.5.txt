<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Reshaping the Political  (Green) Economy* Simon Zadek Independent adviser and author Scaled and rapid transition to a green growth pathway is a survivalist imperative,  according to the science and, increasingly, experience. Contextually, therefore, incre- mental costs of adopting such a pathway as a deviation from ‘business as usual’ are  trivial. Impediments to change therefore can only be understood through a political  economy lens rather than through a narrower, purely technical economic analysis.

Yet it is not really so complex to understand. Pursuing sustainability is no more or less than acting responsibly, ethically, and with common  purpose with those who have less, have been treated badly by history: those who  should have more, more to eat, more to earn, and more to say.  Certainly this view of sustainability is essentially anthropomorphic, but with- out people’s welfare at its core, it is a cause without a future. After all, the poor  number in the billions, and are far more complex and diversified a group than  our narrative on poverty unintentionally suggests, including: t The 1 billion disabled people across the world, most of whom are impover- ished and marginalised t The 22,000 children who die each day of avoidable diseases, one roughly  every four seconds t The increasingly impoverished proportion of the 12% of the world’s popula- tion aged 60 and above (Zadek et al. 2013) t The millions of Greek and Spanish citizens who for the first time in five  decades cannot put food on their children’s plates These experiences are not equivalent, of course. What they have in common  for our purposes here are that they are all symptoms of the flawed economy that  we have created, a modern, global economy that delivers more than enough to  a growing minority and less than enough to the vast majority.  Just how broken is the prevailing economic model is also starkly revealed by  an examination of its environmental scorecard. Everyone here knows this part  of the story, but let us be very clear about how much risk we are taking.  t With respect to climate, we are currently on track to CO2 concentration  levels between 600 and 700 ppm, way above the 450 ppm so-called climate  safety threshold t Over 30% of fish stocks are over-exploited and another 50% are fully  exploited, spelling disaster for the 1 billion poor people on the planet who  are dependent on fish for protein t We are losing the topsoil from over 10 million hectares per year—almost  1% of the world’s land under cultivation t The current rate of species extinction is approximately 1,000–10,000 times  the natural ‘background’ rate The reason for this assault on our planet’s social and natural capital is  straightforward. Our model of economic growth has been built on an assump- tion of open-ended, unlimited resource availability. Consider, in 1900, the world  used 35 exajoules of energy, with one exajoule being equivalent to the annual  6  JCC 51 September 2013 © Greenleaf Publishing 2013 JCC51_Zadek.indd   6 17/09/13   3:00 PM </page> <page sequence="3"> reshaping the political (green) economy electricity consumption of South Korea—or about the annual supply of power  from 35 GW of nuclear plants. By 2000, the world was using over 500 exajoules.  And if the global economy continues to grow at its current rate, we will be using  670–700 exajoules by 2030. This would require the world economy to build an  additional 5,000, GW-sized power-stations! Twenty years ago, the call by the radical economics think-tank, the New Eco- nomics Foundation, for a ‘new economy’ that would be more inclusive, account- able and environmentally sustainable, fell largely on deaf ears. It was the heyday  of the neoliberal revolution marked by massive privatisation, liberalisation of  markets, and dismantling of major parts of the state. Rank opportunism, greed  and outright theft masqueraded as freedom, individualism and entrepreneur- ism. Myopic technological optimism swept away any concerns about planetary  boundaries; scarcity and pollution alike would be dealt with by the market. The  state was said to be a dinosaur, not merely ineffective but unnecessary for a  modern, cool, globalised, political economy.  Such views were nurtured in the hallways of Washington and London, distor- tions of long-dead political economists from Adam Smith to Frederich Hayek.  Yet such views proved to be some of the finest Anglo-Saxon exports of the age,  shaping political economies across Africa and Latin America and large parts  of Asia. Yet it would be dishonest to argue that there were no benefits from the last  half a century over which the market has emerged as a powerhouse of the inter- national political economy.  t Worldwide, life expectancy at birth has increased by 21 years since 1950 t Poverty, by any definition, has fallen faster for more people in the last half  a century than at any time in history And on the environmental side: t The energy required to produce a ton of steel has fallen by over 30% over  the past 25 years t The CO2 required for a KWh of European power production has fallen by  20% over the past 15 years t In US aviation, there has been a 50% reduction in fuel requirements per  passenger mile over 25 years Profit-seeking business, technological advances and globalised financial mar- kets have played a crucial role in delivering these results. Indeed, there is no  doubt that there are extraordinary developments involving both business and  government that are advancing us significantly along a sustainable develop- ment pathway. The scale of renewables investment has quadrupled through the  recession, making it the single largest investment category in the energy sector  and the sector’s largest generator of new jobs. Yet the fact is that such advances remain incremental in the face of the scale of  the challenge. Given all the time in the world, it is conceivable that our current  trajectory would eventually deliver an environmentally sustainable economy,  JCC 51 September 2013 © Greenleaf Publishing 2013  7 JCC51_Zadek.indd   7 17/09/13   3:00 PM </page> <page sequence="4"> simon zadek﻿﻿ albeit one that would almost certainly not be inclusive. But we do not have the  luxury of time on our hands. While every windmill, each scrap of energy effi- ciency, and every ton of waste recycled does count, an incrementalist approach  to optimising our current economic model will simply not be enough. We need to up our game, so what is stopping us? Our challenge is no longer that we do not understand the problem; we are in  fact overwhelmed with evidence that things need to change dramatically for the  better if they are not to get an awful lot worse. Furthermore, it is not that this  evidence is spoken only from the wilderness; we have many political, business  and civil leaders who are shouting about this stuff from the rooftops. And while  further technological advances can and will be made, we already have a chest  full of technologies that could if deployed at scale move us rapidly towards a  circular economy. And as for money, the world has never before been so awash  with capital, some US$250 trillion by one measure powering our US$70 tril- lion global economy.  So what really is the problem, if we know what is happening and our leaders  increasingly speak up, and we have the technology, and there is ample capital  to invest? Certainly there are many, many reasons why we are not progressing  adequately in the right direction, but here are highlighted three particular bar- riers to accelerated transformation: (a) financial markets, (b) vested interests  and (c) government. Financial markets Anyone who has lived through the last five years needs no reminding that there  is something wrong with our financial markets. Andrew Haldane, based at the  Bank of England and one of the most authoritative voices of reason about our  current situation, has estimated that the financial meltdown has cost the global  economy, so far, roughly one year of global income, in the order of US$70 tril- lion. And that is before we know the outcome of Europe’s current crisis or the  slow down across the developing world, including China. Financial market reform to date has failed by its own measure of success  in securing the resilience of financial markets. Continued failures to manage  risks by the world’s largest banks, most recently UBS (again), follow closely on  the footsteps of Barclays and JP Morgan. Yet these failures have been amply  matched by these same banks’ success in their political lobbying to prevent  reforms taking place that would limit their rights to, and rewards from taking  asymmetrical risks with other people’s money, notably that of taxpayers.  But this shameful and worrying wobble in the democratic project pales into  insignificance when one considers that the contested reforms, even if imple- mented, would not move the needle in ensuring that financial markets invest  in the technology, energy systems, and infrastructure we need to secure tomor- row’s inclusive, sustainable global economy. The heart of the problem is that  the reforms have been discussed exclusively with the ‘narrow’ resilience of the  8  JCC 51 September 2013 © Greenleaf Publishing 2013 JCC51_Zadek.indd   8 17/09/13   3:00 PM </page> <page sequence="5"> reshaping the political (green) economy financial markets in mind, rather than considering the resilience of the broader  socio-economic and ecological system within which the financial system exists.  Sir Nicholas Stern, writing in the Financial Times just before COP17 in Durban  last year, summarised this fatal flaw in asking how we can allow fund managers  to calculate risk adjusted returns with an inputted carbon price of zero, today’s  pervasive practice, knowing that this means that they are betting on, indeed  encouraging a carbon intensive economy that will threaten our very survival. Capital markets have public as well as private purposes. Shorting entire  economies, painfully experienced in the past by parts of Latin America and Asia,  has become an endemic practice apparently without limits, threatening political  stability and economic continuity. Moreover, the failure of capital markets to  channel the estimated US$6 trillion a year needed to create an economy that can  serve a rapidly growing global population within planetary boundaries is little  less than shorting civilisation itself (Green Growth Action Alliance, 2013). No  greater externality can be envisaged. No greater justification exists for today’s  proposed financial market reforms to widen their scope to ensure that this  historic market failure is overcome. What might such a broader reform agenda involve? In particular, how can  effective action be taken in the face of the financial industry’s ability to innovate  rapidly beyond the reach of the rule of law, and likewise threaten regulatory  arbitrage with impunity if host nations challenge their right to play dice with  our collective futures?  First and foremost, it requires regulators that are not captured by the corpo- rate coin. An IMF team has estimated that the US financial sector invested US$5  billion in lobbying inside the Washington DC ‘beltway’ over exactly the same  period that they were accepting large-scale bail outs on our account. Frankly,  it is hard to imagine a US or UK government that is not at the beck and call of  the financial sector, and the same can increasingly be said of the rest of Europe.  However, this may not be the case for major emerging nations, even those with  sophisticated capital markets, including among others South Africa, China and  Brazil.  Put bluntly, financial market reform that takes sustainability issues into  account is more likely to be driven by the collective efforts of emerging nations,  especially at a time when it is these countries that have the greatest trading sur- pluses and the most attractive investment destinations. And the evidence of this  potential leadership is already apparent. South Africa, after all, has the world’s  most progressive corporate governance rules. Brazil, similarly, has gone far in  embedding environmental aspects of governance into listing requirements.  And on February 24, 2012, the China Banking Regulatory Commission released  its ‘Green Credit Guidelines’, securing China’s global leadership in advancing  environmental principles and rules across its banking sector, uniquely includ- ing corporate as well as project finance. Beyond this, however, there are regulatory opportunities that could limit  the type and extent of financial market innovation and that ban certain types  of financial trading, such as the pernicious and unproductive activity of naked  shorting. Furthermore, there are fiscal measures that could reduce endemic  JCC 51 September 2013 © Greenleaf Publishing 2013  9 JCC51_Zadek.indd   9 17/09/13   3:00 PM </page> <page sequence="6"> simon zadek﻿﻿ short-termism in investing, such as the wrongly maligned, financial transac- tions tax. Such measures could raise the relative return of longer over shorter  term, and so advantage green over brown investments. Following this line of  argument, there are many opportunities for raising the cost of ‘brown’ invest- ments relative to green. Requiring sovereign and corporate credit ratings to  build in the intensity of natural capital and pollution as a factor in assessing  solvency, for example, is a practical option being worked on as we speak, and  would if widely adopted dramatically change investment decisions.  And finally, there is of course what for fiduciary experts would be the ‘nuclear’  option, to mandate public policy objectives onto the boardroom tables of inves- tors, especially the large institutional investors. As one major investor confessed  in confidence to me recently, ‘unless you force us to invest long in green, what  you will see will always be tokenism’. Incumbents The preceding remarks about the financial sector take one to my second bar- rier, the incumbents. This front line includes those businesses, along with their  political allies, that make money out of the current economic model, complete  with its inequities and the arising environmental tsunami. The financial sector  certainly exemplifies the worst of the winner-takes-all culture that has emerged  across the global political economy, with fund managers willing to trade off even  the survival of the very institutions for which they work in return for a chance  to hit the jackpot.  More worryingly, this Casino Economy has become part of a broader eco- nomic landscape. The share of the USA’S GDP taken by the top 1% earners  has risen from 7.5% in 1970 to an extraordinary 22.5% today. About 1.5 million  people in the US live on less than US$2 a day (Stiglitz, 2012). Similar patterns  can be observed elsewhere; as inequalities between nations have fallen signifi- cantly in recent decades, so have inequalities within nations escalated rapidly.  With public finances under both cyclical and structural pressures, most govern- ments do not have the capacity to mitigate this new form of structural inequality. Incumbents, those that benefit from the current economic model, are unsur- prisingly keen to sustain this situation, even in the face of the resulting social  unrest, from South Africa to Egypt to California, and now also filtering into  hitherto protected political economies such as China. And this willingness to  protect unreasonable rents at all costs brings us to the struggle between advo- cates of green in the face of defenders of the brown economy. Our brown, natural resource-intensive economy currently benefits many  incumbents. Greenpeace’s report, ‘Who Is Holding Us Back’, served up at  COP17 in Durban, provided a role call of the main protagonists defending the  status quo (Greenpeace, 2011). Saudi Arabia is not surprisingly attracted to the  idea of a world dependent on fossil fuels. Russia, similarly, might well embrace  a future with ‘Siberia de Sol’ as a sunny tourist destination. And of course then  10  JCC 51 September 2013 © Greenleaf Publishing 2013 JCC51_Zadek.indd   10 17/09/13   3:00 PM </page> <page sequence="7"> reshaping the political (green) economy there are those companies, foremost among them it has to be said, the rump  of the coal lobby, that are committed to preventing a green transition from  happening. National competitiveness provides a convenient veil behind which corporate  incumbents benefiting from the status quo hide. ‘Why should “we” make the  change if the price is lost competitiveness, growth and jobs’, they argue, refer- ring to countries whose tax regimes and labour markets they are in quickstep  abandoning. Yet the World Economic Forum’s latest version of its leading edge,  national competitiveness index removes this tacky veil. Building on earlier  work on Responsible Competitiveness during my tenure at AccountAbility,  the Forum has created a Sustainable Competitiveness Index of nations (World  Economic Forum, 2011, Zadek, 2006). The index highlights above all the  vulnerability of countries undervaluing the competitiveness costs of failing to  manage environmental externalities and social inequality (back to the issue of  flawed sovereign credit ratings). Countries including China, India and the US  each drop by more than 10 places in the sustainability-focused, competitiveness  ranking. Greenpeace’s error (or at least its campaigning approach), however, is to  reduce this to a ‘bad guy–good guy’ issue. There are tens of trillions of dollars  invested that depend for their returns on a carbon intensive economy (Carbon  Tracker, 2012). Penalising natural resource hungry business models, from coal  to cars to long-distance tourism and food systems, would dent if not crash the  institutional investors that a growing portion of the world relies on. And such  reliance is not only for old folks’ pensions. These are the same institutional  investors that are the ‘go to’ source of capital needed to go green. Crash them  and we can forget any thoughts of mobilising the much-needed money to  finance the transition.  We have become economically addicted to carbon and more broadly natural  resource intensity. Polling a well informed, global middle class as to whether  they would give up a major portion of their wealth and future security in return  for collective survival, and of course a letter of thanks from the appropriate  authorities, might deliver some disturbing results. That is, it turns out that we  are the incumbents, more or less anyone with the time, inclination and access to  listen to me or read this speech.  Welcome to the real world. Overcoming the political power of incumbents is therefore not just about  side-lining mean-spirited capitalists, it is about finding a way to transform what  would otherwise become stranded and so devalued assets, the assets we need  to live securely and invest in tomorrow’s economy. Such policy paradoxes may  bemuse and confuse us, but they should not surprise us. When we talk about  ‘system change’, that is exactly what we mean. There are no so-called exogenous,  or independent parameters to the overall system; we have no choice but to work  within an entangled, interrelated reality. Practically, there is much that can be done, dramatically, but not in ways that  crash the system. Some of these I have already alluded to in my comments  about reforms to the financial sector. But equally there are many changes that  JCC 51 September 2013 © Greenleaf Publishing 2013  11 JCC51_Zadek.indd   11 17/09/13   3:00 PM </page> <page sequence="8"> simon zadek﻿﻿ can happen in the real economy to transform stranded assets into productive  ones fit for the 21st century. New product development, rentalisation of products  into services, virtualisation of delivery and communications, and the redesign  of everything from building standards to public procurement specifications, are  what is needed now, and what we all know how to do, at scale.  Government Such policy capture and associated shortfalls brings one on to the third and  last barrier discussed here, the government. Contrary to much ideological  myth, governments are and have always been a key driver of wealth creation.  Governments play a crucial role in legitimising wealth creation and its result- ing distribution and use. And governments are the stewards of the rule of law  that among other things protects and rewards those who do create wealth.  These roles are pre-conditions for any successful, organised economy, from the  African continent to the technology-powered pavilions of the modern economy,  from California to Shanghai. Beyond these roles, governments have to shape the political economy within  which successful investments can be made in the development of technologi- cally dynamic and diversified businesses, markets and sectors. This has been  crystallised into the term ‘investment grade policies’ by folks at Chatham  House in London. But actually this term is deceptive as it suggests that a menu  of policies can do the job, suitably enforced. In fact, government’s role, while  including the advance of specific policies, is crucial in shaping the more subtle  fabric of the political economy within which trust, innovation and investments  can take place.  What is similar about Singapore, South Korea, and Switzerland, for example,  is that their governments have been successful in delivering these functions.  What is similar about Russia, Saudi Arabia and, sadly, South Africa is that they  have failed to date in this respect. And what is similar about Brazil, Turkey and  Thailand is that the jury is out as to whether or not they are set to join the first  group or languish helplessly in the second. This crucial role of government is very apparent when one considers the  countries that have progressed furthest in green transformation, in terms of  both commitments and practice. The governments of Denmark and Germany,  for example, along with Japan and Korea, have played a crucial role in advancing  their country’s low carbon trajectory.  China’s government, perhaps must obviously, has driven both the massive  growth in carbon intensive energy generation, and now the rapid increase in  renewables. Today, China’s government is embarking on major fiscal and regu- latory shifts that will attempt to swing the country’s huge economy towards a  sustainable growth path.  China’s 12th Five Year Plan sets out ambitious intentions for advancing  a more balanced domestic economy, framed by out-going Premier Wen’s  12  JCC 51 September 2013 © Greenleaf Publishing 2013 JCC51_Zadek.indd   12 17/09/13   3:00 PM </page> <page sequence="9"> reshaping the political (green) economy characterisation of the current economic model as ‘unbalanced, unstable,  uncoordinated, and unsustainable’. Evidence of the seriousness of China’s  stance includes its commitment over the plan period to invest in environmental  protection to the tune of US$450 billion, and to put an extra US$450 billion  into renewable energy and US$600 billion into smart grids. Ambitiously, it  has recently announced plans to pilot seven domestic carbon markets covering  hundreds of million of people, and hundreds of thousands of companies. The uncomfortable reality is, however, that most governments appear unable  to perform their historic function of creating the right conditions for sustainable  wealth creation. Even the basics, maintaining the rule of law, civil security and  clearly defined and enforced property rights, are beyond the reach not only of  so-called ‘fragile and failed states’, but of a growing number of more matured  governments and societies. Corporate capture, as I have highlighted already,  with the associated biases and shortfalls in public policy, is endemic in the US  and increasingly across the OECD. Corruption in the public sector, in its broad- est rather than its legal sense, despite the views of Transparency International,  is pervasive in developed countries, and growing worldwide.  Rather than wishing for some non-existent past, we have to face the possibil- ity that the governments of our dreams are not going to be part of our future  reality. This is not a note of despair but a call for reflection, innovation and  experimentation. Across Africa, we see ‘leapfrogging’ in areas such as telecom- munications, with the huge potential benefits that this will bring, for example,  to education and health delivery. Yet Africa, and many of countries around  the world, is creating governments in the image of their European and North  American counterparts. Learning from others is of course right and proper. But  South Africa cannot, and should not seek to emulate Europe or North America.  Beyond the very limits of emulation, these models are themselves no longer  fit for purpose, largely made up of inherited institutional arrangements that  creak and groan and are integral to their originating continents’ failing vitality. Tomorrow’s governments will have to be up to the task of wealth creation  and distribution. Regulation and fiscal interventions will remain important  instruments, but only one piece of the pathway to success. It is indeed a time  for experimentation in governance and its links to execution.  t The Water Resources Group, for example, is a global partnership made up  of international agencies and businesses, working with governments from  Jordan to Mongolia to South Africa in improving water security and access  conditions t The Sustainable Energy for All initiative, launched in New York in 2012 by  UN Secretary-General Ban Ki Moon, and bringing together governments  from 50 countries and many private sector players, aims to catalyse mas- sive private and public investment in clean and largely distributed energy  systems for the poor t Qatar has launched the Global Drylands Alliance in an effort to create a  mutual risk-sharing, multi-country alliance involving the private sector to  raise the ambitions and deliver food security to a billion people JCC 51 September 2013 © Greenleaf Publishing 2013  13 JCC51_Zadek.indd   13 17/09/13   3:00 PM </page> <page sequence="10"> simon zadek﻿﻿ t Two international initiatives, the Global Subsidies Project and the Procure- ment and Public Policy Partnership, both hosted by the International Insti- tute for Sustainable Development are aimed respectively at ridding the  world of fossil fuel subsidies and advancing green public procurement  at scale Government has to be reinvented if it is to play its historic role. Highlighted  above are examples that blend governance and action by combining public and  private actors, and working both across as well as within national boundaries.  Yet this is not the only possible direction to go. Rhetoric aside, we are witnessing  a renaissance in industrial strategy, abandoned last in the face of the neoliberal  push from the 1970s. China is certainly the iconic, class master in this respect,  but Germany, Japan, Korea and Denmark, notably all leaders in green growth, offer  comparably successful role models.  State ownership, furthermore, is once again part of the mix in discussing  how to gain policy leverage in global markets (Zadek, 2012). Setting aside the  specifics of the nationalisation debate in South Africa, it is important to recog- nise some basic facts from the international economy. State-ownership is most  pronounced in the natural resources sector. Today state-owned oil and natural  gas companies, such as Saudi Aramco, Petróleos de Venezuela and China  National Petroleum Corp., own 73% of the world’s oil reserves and 68% of its  natural gas. Similarly, in 2008, state-owned share of global mining production  value amounts to about 24%. According to the Inter-American Development  Bank, the percentage of state ownership in the banking industry globally by  the mid-1990s is over 40%. The BRIC countries—Brazil, Russia, India, and  China—contain nearly 3 billion of the world’s 7 billion people, or 40% of the  global population. The BRICs all make heavy use of public sector banks, which  compose about 75% of the banks in India, 69% or more in China, 45% in Brazil,  and 60% in Russia. China, once again, is today’s iconic case of having dominant, state-owned  enterprises. These SoEs exhibit many performance shortfalls by most tradi- tional measures (e.g. return on capital, customer service and corporate gov- ernance). Equally, however, there is no doubt that China’s SoEs have played a  crucial role in the country’s development, providing policy-aligned investments  and effective national stewardship across many markets. There is no doubt  that such a policy has challenged, in fact undermined, the principles of non- discrimination, good governance, intellectual property protection and a host  of other ‘untouchable’ international norms and standards. Yet there is also no  doubt that the existence of SoE’s has been part of a package of measures that  has enabled China to emerge more or less peacefully as a global giant, despite  the efforts of global incumbents. The point here is not to advocate state-ownership, but to highlight a real time  mega-trend that has benefited some of the world’s most successful economies,  as well as dragging back some of the world’s worst performers. State ownership and sovereign wealth funds are in some ways the opposite  end of the spectrum to avant-garde public–private partnerships. After all, one  14  JCC 51 September 2013 © Greenleaf Publishing 2013 JCC51_Zadek.indd   14 17/09/13   3:00 PM </page> <page sequence="11"> reshaping the political (green) economy seems to be about more control while the other is about less; one is overtly an  expression of national self-interest, while the other more explicitly embraces  an internationalism and the ‘principle of Co’, co-determination, co-design, and  co-risk.  Yet in the face of these polarities, there are critical similarities. The role of  government in both cases does not exclude regulation or fiscal measures, but  goes beyond these narrow confines. Furthermore, both ends of the spectrum  in fact are centrally about a re-engagement of the state into economic affairs,  involving many forms of instruments including ownership, co-governance,  and non-statutory (‘voluntary’) regulation. Amid the rhetoric, ideology, and at  times the violence, we are seeing a very messy experimentation in what forms  of government can get the job done. And so... The core message offered in this paper is in fact very simple, albeit about a  complex topic.  t First, we have everything it takes to solve the problems facing us. There is no  empty chair at the table that we are waiting to fill, some leader or technology  or crucial piece of information that will change the game altogether for the  better. The cards, if you prefer the analogy, have all been dealt  t Second, the obstacles to overcome are many, but three in particular seem to  be significant: the crisis of capital, the power and legitimacy of incumbents,  and the damaged nature of government Green growth is so often a supply-side discussion, an economic- managerialist  style of debate about, in particular, technology, energy and finance. This paper,  while confirming the importance of such topics and perspectives, has mean- dered into the muddy waters of political economy. It argues that the action we  need to understand and shape lies largely at the interface between government  and business, between co-operation and competition, and between private gain  and public benefit. These interfaces are penetratingly complex, certainly, but  with solutions at hand, albeit requiring tough love, leadership, risk taking, and  a vibrant political economy in its fullest sense.  t Capital markets, viral and parasitic in their nature, need a radical overhaul  to align them to their public purpose to invest in tomorrow’s sustainable  economy t Incumbents, including us, need to be gently or otherwise moved to one side,  allowing toxic assets to be depreciated or better still converted to other uses t And government, the uncelebrated key to wealth creation through the ages,  needs to be reinvented to do its job at this critical time JCC 51 September 2013 © Greenleaf Publishing 2013  15 JCC51_Zadek.indd   15 17/09/13   3:00 PM </page> <page sequence="12"> simon zadek﻿﻿ Bibliography Carbon Tracker (2012) Unburnable Carbon: Are the World’s Financial Markets Carrying a   Carbon Bubble, Carbon Tracker Initiative, London.
