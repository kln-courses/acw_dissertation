Krause-Parello, Ph.D., RN College of Natural, Applied and Health Sciences Kean University The relationship between loneliness and general health was investigated in 159 older females living in the community. Pet attachment support, a variable tested as a mediator of this relationship, was examined also. Participants completed the Revised UCLA Loneliness Scale, a Pet Attachment scale, and the Psychological General Weil-Being Schedule: general health subscale. A negative relationship between loneliness and general health decreased when controlling for pet attachment support as a coping mechanism. The findings from this study support that pet attachment support has a mediating effect on the relationship between loneliness and general health in this sample of older females. Implications for community health nurses and public policy are discussed. Nursing, as a human science, focuses on human beings in relation to health and illness (Mel?is, 1997). In addition, Mel?is explained that the discipline of nursing is shaped by its health orientation in contradistinction to a disease orientation. She further explained that nurses have a mission to care for people, discover ways to enhance health, and utilize resources accessible to them. Moreover, community heath nurses (CHN) have opportu nity to discuss the utilization of coping resources available to older females living in the community. The utilization of pets as a supportive and coping resource is promising in the reduction of loneliness and the promotion of health. According to the U. S. Census Bureau (2003b) there are 144 million women, compared to 138 million men, and among individuals 65 and older, women outnumber men by 5.3 million. Worldwide, women aged 60 and over are expected to double by the year 2025 with Correspondence should be sent to Cheryl A.

S. Census Bureau, 1998). This trend shows no signs of receding. The U. S. Census Bureau (1996) further projects that, by 2010. Americans over the age of 55, which represents over 16 million individuals, will be living alone. Among the older adult population in the United States, 31 % of women and 9% of men are widowed, and these percentages increase in ratio with age (U. S. Census Bureau, 2003a). In the United States, the prevalence of mental illness is on the rise and, according to the National Institute of Health (2002), approximately 22.1% of Americans aged 18 years and older suffer from diagnosable mental health disorders each year. Over 2 million Americans aged 65 years and older experience depression, and, in 2000, older Americans accounted for 18% of suicide deaths (National Institute of Mental Health, 2003). Accord ing to the National Institute of Mental Health (2006) depression is a mental disorder af fecting older women. Stone (1999) explained the annual suicide rate for older women is 6.7/100,000; however, this rate may be underreported due the nature of death, such as overdosing, which may lead to speculation regarding the actual cause of fatality. As a re sult, the identification of easily accessible mechanisms to promote health among older women is urgently needed. The promotion of health is an important aspect of community health practice (United States Department of Health and Humans Service [U.S.DHHS], 2000). The role of the CHN includes the responsibility of conducting a health assessment of older female adults. However, CHN should be conscious that the health needs of older women vary when com pared to older men. Specifically, there are a variety of psychosocial needs that should be met for older women to lead fulfilling and healthy lives and reduce the pain of loneliness. Subsequently, one of the psychosocial needs is a supportive attachment relationship (Flaherty &amp; Richman, 1989). Weiss ( 1973) discussed the importance of attachment and the need for supplementary relationships to relieve the pain and stress of loneliness. There is scant but evolving literature that indicates that companion animals may have a significant effect on the reduction of loneliness and the promotion of health in older women. According to Manfredi and Pickett (1987), older adults use a variety of mecha nisms to cope with stress. Subsequently, pets may act as a mechanism by which older women can cope with stress. In addition, companion animals are easily accessible and appear promising as a resource that may enhance health (Hart, 2000). This research serves to better understand the op?rant mechanisms by which pet attachment support en hances general health among older women. LITERATURE REVIEW Loneliness and General Health Perlman and Peplau (1982) proposed that loneliness has an adverse effect on general health. The mechanisms by which loneliness has an adverse effect on health include ere</page><page sequence="3">Pet Attachment Support 3 ating anxiety or depression that can manifest physiological symptoms, including an alter ation or disturbance in eating and sleeping patterns, headaches, and nausea (Perlman &amp; Peplau, 1982). In addition, Weiss (1969) proposed that older adults are particularly susceptible to a blitz of relational losses, and, as a result, are continually at risk for some extent of loneli ness. He further stated that the relational losses, foreseeable with age, should result in the quest and establishment of new relationships that restore the lost provisions of support. Theory suggests that among older adults, loneliness is a widespread state that leads indi viduals to actively seek supportive relationships. In other words, loneliness serves as a precursor to actively seek a new attachment or supportive relationship to cope with lone liness (Weiss, 1969). Subsequent studies support this proposition, in that a significant, inverse relationship has been found between loneliness and health (Cox, Spiro, &amp; Sullivan, 1988; Penninx et al., 1997; Seeman, 2000; Sugisawa, Liang, &amp; Liu, 1994). Based on theory and previous research, the relationship between loneliness and general health was examined. Pet Attachment Support and General Health According to Lazarus and Folkman (1984) people use coping strategies as a response to stressful life events. Lazarus and Launier (1978) theorized that the ways in which people cope with stress is critical to their general health. There are many resources available to older adults to help cope with stress. A review of several theories identifies several im portant theoretical propositions that serve to illuminate and elucidate the role of compan ion animals by means of pet attachment support in the enhancement of health. More re cently, theorists have indicated that attachments, including the attachment between humans and their pets, provide a unique and accessible source of social support (Collis &amp; McNicholas, 1998; Serpell, 2002). A subsequent study supports this proposition, in that a significant, positive relation ship has been found between pet attachment and health in women (Staats, Pierfelice, Kim, &amp; Crandell, 1999). Based on theory and previous research, the relationship between pet attachment support, as a coping mechanism, and general health was examined. Loneliness and Pet Attachment Support Weiss (1973,1974) explained that loneliness is consequently stressful and it prompts in dividuals to integrate new relationships or regain lost ones, so that the needed relational provisions of social support can be obtained. Weiss (1969) further posited that older adults are particularly vulnerable to relational losses and, thus, to a state of loneliness that results in the coping mechanism of actively seeking supportive relationships to replace</page><page sequence="4">4 Krause-Parello those that were lost. Hence, theory supports a positive relationship between loneliness and supportive attachment relationships. Collis and McNicholas (1998) proposed that individuals, vulnerable for disruption and loss of human relational provisions, may seek to replace these lost human relation ships by establishing a supportive relationship with a pet. Therefore, pet attachment sup port is posited as a coping mechanism and manifestation of support-seeking among indi viduals. Research supports a positive relationship between loneliness and pet attachment in older adults (Keil, 1998). Based on theory and previous research, the relationship be tween loneliness and pet attachment support was examined. Women and Supportive Networks According to Skarupski and Pelkowski (2003), CHN should inform older adults about the health consequences of loneliness and the benefits of maintaining societal attachment rela tionships. Moreover, Flaherty and Richman (1989) explained that women are sensitive, which may lead to the support of others and a higher dependence on social support. Subse quently, role socialization of females at an early age also promotes the development of care giving and nurturing behaviors. Many women react to stress by caring for others and join ing social groups all for the exchange of supportive networks and responsibilities (Taylor et al., 2000). PURPOSE The purpose of this descriptive study was to examine the relationship between loneliness and general health, as well as examine the effect of pet attachment support which theoret ically mediates this relationship in a sample of community-residing older females. The stress, coping, and adaptation theory posited by Lazarus and Folkman (1984) was the overall conceptual framework for this study. This framework proposes that certain cop ing resources can mediate the relationship between stress and adaptation (see Figure 1). This investigation is part of a larger study (Krause-Parello, 2007). Research Questions This study sought to provide answers to the following questions: 1. What is the relationship between loneliness and general health in older women? 2. What is the relationship between pet attachment support and general health in older women?</page><page sequence="5">Pet Attachment Support 5 Adaptation FIGURE 1 The theoretical model proposing that coping mediates the effect of stress on adaptation (Lazarus &amp; Folkman, 1984). 3. What is the relationship between loneliness and pet attachment support in older women? 4. Does the coping resource of pet attachment support mediate the effect of loneli ness on general health among older women? (See Figure 2) Definition of Terms General health, for the purpose of this study, is theoretically defined as a personal and subjective assessment of one's overall physical condition (Dupuy, 1984). General health is operationalized by a score on the Psychological General Well-Being (PGWB) Sched ule: General health subscale (Dupuy, 1984). Loneliness, for the purpose this study, is theoretically defined as a painful and unpleas ant (Fromm-Reichmann, 1959; Weiss, 1973) Stressor (Selye, 1976,1980). Loneliness is operationalized by a score on the Revised UCLA Loneliness Scale (Russell, Peplau, &amp; Cutrona, 1980). Pet attachment support, for the purpose of this study, based on attachment theory and others (Ainsworth, 1989; Bowlby, 1969,1973; Collis &amp; McNicholas, 1998), is theoreti cally defined as a strong emotional and affectional relational bond between a specific hu man and a canine or a feline. Pet attachment support is operationalized by a score on the Pet Attachment scale (Albert &amp; Bulcroft, 1988). METHODOLOGY Sampling Inclusion criteria for participation in this study were women: (a) 55-84 years old; (b) owned a canine or a feline; (c) resided in a pet friendly independent living housing</page><page sequence="6">6 Krause-Parello f-\ Pet Attachment Support *v-?-* General Health FIGURE 2 The theoretical model proposing that pet attachment support mediates the effect of loneliness on general health. community for older adults or participated in a senior citizen community center; (d) were able to communicate in English; and (e) could read and write in English. Based on the power tables to ensure a medium effect size of/2 =.15, and a .05 level of significance, a minimum number of 75 subjects were required to achieve a power of .82 for regression analysis (Cohen, Cohen, West, &amp; Aiken, 2003). The final sample of 159 women ranged in age from 55-84 (M = 71; SD = 8.52) years old. A descriptive analysis of demographic data was conducted to describe the sample characteristics. The variables included gender, race, educational level, marital status, living arrangements, housing type, and health status (see Table 1). The second set of demographic data subjected to de scriptive analysis was characteristics of the participant's pet. The variables included pet type and health status. Pets were represented by dogs (n = 74) and cats (n = 85) and the pet's health was rated by the participants as excellent (49.7 %), very good (27.0 %), good (14.5 %), fair (7.5 %), ov poor (1.3 %). Instruments PGWB Schedule. General health was measured by the PGWB Schedule: General health subscale (Dupuy, 1984). The general health subscale is a 3-item summative likert-type rating scale that measures general health using anchors that range from 0 (most negative option) to 5 (mostpositive option). The scale scores can range from 0-15, with higher scores indicating higher levels of general health. The psychometric evidence for the PGWB has been reported in a sample of the general population consisting of 1,209 residents of Dayton, Ohio (Ware, Johnson, Davies, &amp; Brook, 1979). In the previous study, the internal consistency for the general health subscale was .73. The Cronbach's alpha obtained for this study was .70. The Revised UCLA Loneliness Scale. Loneliness was measured by the Revised UCLA Loneliness Scale (Russell et al., 1980). The Revised UCLA Loneliness Scale is a Loneliness</page><page sequence="7">Pet Attachment Support 7 TABLE 1 Participant's Demographics &amp; Characteristics Variable Race Black or African American White Hispanic/Latino Native American or Alaskan Native Asian or Pacific Islander Other Education No formal school Some grammar school Completed grammar school Some high school Completed high school Some college Completed college Marital status Married Never married Divorced Separated Widowed Partnered Living arrangements Alone Spouse/significant other Friend Parents Family/relative Housing type 55 and over community Private residence Participant's health Excellent Very good Good Fair Poor 2 154 1 1 0 1 0 2 6 25 60 36 30 37 7 40 2 71 2 106 38 0 1 14 120 39 27 50 56 23 3 1.3 96.9 .6 .6 0 .6 0 1.3 3.8 15.7 37.7 22.6 18.9 23.3 4.4 25.2 1.3 44.7 1.0 66.7 23.9 0 .6 8.8 75.5 24.5 17.0 31.4 35.2 14.5 1.9 20-item summative Likert-type rating scale that measures the subjective experience of loneliness. The scale uses these anchor degrees of agreement and disagreement: 1 (never), 2 (rarely), 3 (sometimes), and 4 (often). The scale scores can range from 20 to 80 with higher scores indicating higher levels of loneliness. The psychometric evidence for the Revised UCLA Loneliness Scale has been reported on college students attending University of California, Los Angeles (Russell et al., 1980). The instrument has been found to be reliable in samples of older adults in that the coeffi cient alpha of .86 was reported in a study of 87 persons who were at least 65 years of age (Barron, Foxall, Von Dollen, Jones, &amp; Shull, 1994). A coefficient alpha of .95 was re</page><page sequence="8">8 Krause-Parello ported in a study of 110 persons who were aged 60 years or more (Kim, 1999). The Cronbach's alpha obtained for this study was .84. Pet Attachment scale. Pet Attachment support (PAS) was measured by the Pet At tachment scale (Albert &amp; Bulcroft, 1988). This scale is a 9-item summative likert rating scale that measures PAS. The scale uses as anchors degrees of agreement and disagree ment: 1 (strongly disagree), 2 (disagree), 3 (neutral), 4 (agree), and 5 (strongly agree). The scale scores can range from 9 to 45, with higher scores indicating a higher level of pet attachment. The scale developer has given permission to substitute the word sad for lonely in question number six, to avoid overlapping content with the Revised UCLA Loneliness Scale (K. Bulcroft, personal communication, March, 13, 2006). The Pet Attachment scale has demonstrated good internal consistency reliability in a diverse sample of 320 community-residing pet owners representing various stages of family development from young married couples to older, widowed individuals (Albert &amp; Bulcroft, 1988). The Cronbach's alpha in the previous study was .85. The Cronbach's alpha obtained for this study was .90. Data Collection Methods The rights of human participants were protected by obtaining approval from the Institu tional Review Board of Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey prior to data collec tion. The community directors of pet-friendly, independent-living housing communities for older adults and senior citizen community centers were contacted. The community di rectors signed a permission form indicating willingness for their facility to participate by being a site for data collection. Upon obtaining signed, informed consent from each participant, the investigator gave participants an instrument packet to be completed at that time. If the participants had more than one pet, they were asked to respond based on the animal for which they had the most feelings. The completion of the instruments took approximately 20 minutes. The participants who completed the instrument packet received small tokens for themselves and their pet in appreciation for their time and participation. Data Analysis Techniques Data were analyzed using Pearson product-moment (questions one through three) and regression analyses (question four) using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS), version 13.0 for Windows, (SPSS, Inc., 2004). Two-tailed tests were used to de termine the level of significance at the .05 level.</page><page sequence="9">Pet Attachment Support 9 FINDINGS AND RESULTS The mean score for loneliness was 37.00 (SD = 8.32). The mean score for PAS was 36.71 (SD = 6.70). The mean score for general health was 9.80 (SD = 2.72). Loneliness scores were analyzed using the criteria set forth by Perry (1990), with a score of 65-80 indicat ing a high degree of loneliness, a score of 50-64 indicating a moderately high degree of loneliness, a score of 35-49 indicating a moderate degree of loneliness, and a score of 20-34 indicating low degree of loneliness. In this sample, the mean loneliness score indi cated a moderate degree of loneliness. The result for question one supported a statistically significant positive relationship between loneliness and PAS (r =. 19, p = .01 ). The result for question two supported a sta tistically significant inverse relationship between PAS and general heath (r = -.21, p = .01). The result for question three supported a statistically significant inverse relationship between loneliness and general health (r = -.28, p = .00). The mediation affect of PAS on the relationship between loneliness and general health was tested. Regression analyses were conducted according to Baron and Kenny (1986). The result for question four supported in the first regression analysis that the independent variable (loneliness) had a significant effect on the mediating variable (PAS; ? = .19, p = .02); in the second regression analysis the independent variable (loneliness) had a signifi cant effect on the dependent variable (general health; ? = -.28, p = .00). In the third re gression analysis, both the independent variable of loneliness and the mediating variable of PAS were entered into the equation simultaneously with the dependent variable of general health. In the third regression analysis, the mediator (PAS) did have a significant effect on the dependent variable (general health; ? = -. 17, p = .03) and the direct relation ship between loneliness and general health was decreased, demonstrating a small but sig nificant mediating effect of pet attachment between loneliness and general health (? = -.25, p = .00; Figure 3). The results support the theory that PAS meditated the relation ship between loneliness and general health. Discussion of Findings Based on the results of this study and on previous research, the presence of a Stressor such as loneliness may be linked to adverse health outcomes. A variable such as PAS may serve as a coping mechanism to enhance health. This postulation was supported in that the coping resource of PAS mediated the effect of loneliness on general health among older women. This finding is also consistent with the overall theoretical framework put forth by Lazarus and Folkman (1984) that guided the research. The stress, coping, and adaptation model theorizes that coping mechanisms mediate the relationship between stress and adaptation. Furthermore, the findings suggest that the promotion of health for older women may occur by cohabiting with pets, however more research is needed.</page><page sequence="10">10 Krause-Parello Eq. 1 Loneliness ^r Pet Attachment Support ? = .19(p = .02) Eq. 2 Loneliness Tr General Health ? = -.2S(p = .00) Eq. 3 Pet Attachment Support ^i ? = -.17 &lt;p = .03) Loneliness mW General Health ?=-.25(p = .00) FIGURE 3 The results of testing the pet attachment support mediation model in women. Moreover, a positive relationship was found between loneliness and PAS, which suggests that as loneliness increased for the older woman, there was a significant increase in pet attachment. This finding is consistent with previous research (Keil, 1998). The attach ment with a pet may also act as a resource to help disadvantaged older females remain ac tive in a reciprocal relationship. In this study, a negative relationship was found between PAS and general health. Dupuy (1984) explained that the PGWB Schedule, which includes the general health subscale, is sensitive to changes in an individual's subjective well-being. The general health instrument asked subjects how they felt and how things have been going with them during the past month. The participants in this study were attached to their pets, however, the variability of scale scores may have been reflected if they were not feeling well or things were not going well for them in the past month (i.e., acute illness or a recent ache or pain). Consequently, this alternative methodological explanation may suggest a tem poral component of the general health instrument.</page><page sequence="11">Pet Attachment Support 11 CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR CHN The findings from this study have implications for CHN. CHN are expected to initiate the appropriate changes in community health practice based on the current evidence. The findings from this research support a pet as an alternative and easily accessible coping mechanism for the older woman living in the community. In this study, the women who participated benefited from cohabiting with a dog or a cat in that PAS mediated the relationship of loneliness on general health. In addition, cur rent literature suggests that CHN should inform older adults about the health conse quences of loneliness and the benefits of maintaining societal attachment relationships (Skarupski &amp; Pelkowski, 2003). The findings also suggest that women have a dependence on attachment support when they are stressed. These findings are supported by previous research in that women re spond to stress by caring for others and joining social networks, all for the exchange of seeking support resources and responsibilities (Taylor et al., 2000). Consequently, the re sults of this study supported the health benefit of the older woman caring for a cat or a dog. Furthermore, the findings from this research have implications for public policy. Spe cifically, the changes or alteration in public policies can include allowing pets in senior citizen housing complexes, nursing homes, rehabilitation centers, retirement communi ties, and adult facilitates. In this study, a majority of the participants lived alone. As a re sult, some participants expressed the want and desire to cohabitate with a pet, but ex plained that they were not permitted to acquire a pet at the facility in which they live. Subsequently, in other cases, if the residents were allowed to own a pet, they stated that the security deposits required by building management and/or landlords were too high, especially if they were on a fixed income. Suggesting that current pet policies and pet policy restrictions are becoming a social problem for the older population. The CHN working in the community is in an ideal position to assist older adults in changing or altering pet policies. The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (2001) developed a guide for pet ownership in a rental unit or public hous ing. This guide can assist CHN and the individuals they are caring for by providing suggestive strategies to implement pet policy changes in their residential setting. CHN can begin by ascertaining the current pet policies where the individual resides. Once an understanding of the policy is established, the CHN can assist older individuals in ad dressing concerns and suggesting strategies to management/landlords. One strategy that can be implemented is the development of a pet contract that supports pet owner ship responsibility. This contract may include a variety of information, such as veteri nary contact information, copies of current health records, date of spay/neuter, rabies vaccine, flea/tick prevention regime, heart worm medication compliance, and sched uled immunizations. The pet contract can also include evidence of pet licensure, proof</page><page sequence="12">12 Krause-Parello of obedience training, information on designated areas for pet recreation, and rules on pet leashing in common areas. The findings further imply that nurses, particularly CHN, due to their direct access to the residents living in the community, have a responsibility to help older adults develop strategies aimed at reducing loneliness and promoting health. One way that CHN can as sist this aggregate is to begin screening older adults for loneliness and providing informa tion regarding the benefits of positive social relationships (Skarupski &amp; Pelkowski, 2003). In addition, CHN can further assist this aggregate in identifying sources of attach ment support through discussion and an assessment of their social networks. CHN should also encourage older adults to maintain and expand social relationships. In summary, attachment relationships can be found in many different forms; therefore, CHN have an obligation to assess the older woman's supportive networks, such as a pet, and utilize them to enhance individual health. Future research needs to be conducted to further examine the relationships among loneliness, PAS, and general health for the older woman living in the community. REFERENCES Ainsworth, M. D. S.
