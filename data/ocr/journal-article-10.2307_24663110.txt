<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE HOLINESS ACCORDING TO THE TEMPLE SCROLL (*) God's Location and the Biblical Laws of Purity and Impurity he Bible itself provides a variety of answers to the question of God's location, ranging from the minimalist perception, according to which God dwells in the Sanctuary or the Temple only, to a broader one, according to which God is in the heavens or every where. (1) These different perceptions have implications for one's understanding of the concept of "sanctity" induced by the divine pre sence, as well as for the details of the laws due to that sanctity. In this article I propose to determine the position of the redactor of the Temple Scroll Scroll on this issue, by examining his way of using biblical expressions of sanctity, which serves in the Torah for reasoning the laws of purity and impurity. It will be shown that the redactor of the Scroll has his own unique manner of describing the divine presence, which is essentially a harmonization of the different perceptions in the Torah. To that end, the different perceptions in the Torah will be briefly surveyed, the major distinction being between the accounts in the book of Leviticus, on the one hand, and those of Deuteronomy, on the other. (2) According to one perception, God is present in the Temple, and only there. This is clearly the tenor of the passages of the Torah concerning the construction of the tabernacle; for example: "And let them make me a sanctuary that I may dwell among them" {Ex 25:8); "I will dwell among the children of Israel, and I will be their God" (ibid. 29:45); "And they shall know that I the Lord am their God, who brought them out from the Land of Egypt that I might dwell among them, I the Τ (*) An early version of this paper was presented at the S.B.L. annual meeting, Bos ton, November 1999.

(3) While these texts speak of God dwel ling "among the children of Israel," it is clear from the first verse quoted that this is accomplished through His presence in the tabernacle. As against this strongly anthropomorphic approach, the book of Deutero nomynomy presents an abstract theology of the divine presence, repeatedly stressing variations of the formula "the place where the Lord will choose to establish His name." God Himself is not in that place, because He has no definite location; but He establishes His name there and invests it with His presence. mere are tnus two airrerences oetween inese concepuons: 1; wnue the Priestly literature envisions God Himself "dwelling" in a specific place, Deuteronomy describes only "His name" as being there, ii) While the book of Leviticus describes God as dwelling exclusively in the sane tuary, in the book of Deuteronomy and the related literature He is pre sent everywhere. The strongest expression of this idea may be found in Solomon's prayer at the dedication of the Temple (1 Kgs 8; 1 Chron 2:6). While Solomon states, "I have now built for You a stately house, a place where You may dwell forever" (1 Kgs 8:13), implying that God Himself will live in the house, he repeatedly speaks of building a house "for My [= God's] name" or the like. (4) In addition, he affirms that Israel will offer their prayers "toward this place, and You will give heed in Your heavenly abode, give heed and pardon" (ibid. v. 30). Even more emphatic is the version of the prayer in the book of Chronicles: "Does God really dwell with man on earth? Even the Heavens to their utter most reaches cannot contain You, how much less this house that I have built!" (2 Chron 6:18). Solomon therefore prays "When Your people take the field against their enemy by whatever way You send them, and they pray to the Lord in the direction of the city which You have chosen, and the house which I have built to Your name..." (7 Kings 8:44). So Israel will pray to "this house," but God will hear in His abode in the heavens, not on earth; His presence is not confined to the site of the temple or sanctuary. As already intimated, the divine presence in the temple or sanctuary has halakhic implications, expressive of the sanctity of the place as due to that presence. The laws of impurity results from genital discharges (טומאות הגוף) are summed up by the following exhortatory verse: "You shall warn the children of Israel (5) against their uncleanness, lest they (3) Y. Knohl, The Sanctuary of Silence, Fortress Press, Minneapolis 1995, 63-66, ascribes these verses to the "Holiness School," whose conception of the deity and the sacred rite he distinguishes from that of the Priestly School (ibid., 184-185); see below, n. 7.

Mil grom, Leviticus 1-16 (The Anchor Bible), New York 1991, 945-946.</page><page sequence="3">THE HOLINESS ACCORDING TO THE TEMPLE SCROLL 371 die through their uncleanness by defiling my tabernacle which is among them" (Lev 15:31). This is an admonishment to the Israelites to cleanse themselves of all impurity, lest they defile the sanctuary, that is, the tabernacle or the temple, in their midst. As Milgrom explains, (6) the import of this verse is as follows: the fear that the unclean may defile the temple with their bodily impurity does not relate specifically to their entering the temple precincts. Unclean persons in the camp may also affect the temple, as one can also convey impurity not directly, by touch, but also at a distance. This is in accord with the general doctrine of Levi ticus that God dwells only in the temple, so that the need to guard against uncleanness outside the temple too is attributed to fear of de filing the temple itself. Such is also the perception expressed in NumNum 19:13: "Whoever touches a corpse, the body of a person who has died, and does not cleanse himself, defiles the Lord's tabernacle; that person shall be cut off from Israel.'1 In other words, a person becoming unclean through contact with a dead person — the most severe type of impurity — must cleanse himself; if he fails to do so, he will defile the Lord's tabernacle/temple. (7) A different reason tor avoiding uncleanness and cleansing oneself when unclean is given at the end of the laws of forbidden foods, which include an injunction to avoid contact with a carcass: You shall not make yourselves abominable with anything that swarms; you shall not make yourselves unclean therewith and thus become unclean. For I am the Lord your God: you shall sanctify yourselves and be holy, for I am holy. You shall not make yourselves unclean with any swarming thing that moves upon the earth. For I the Lord am He who brought you up from the land of Egypt to be your God: you shall be holy, for I am holy (Lev 11:43-45). There is no mention here of defiling the tabernacle. Instead, the obligation to cleanse oneself is present as an independent command, implied by Israel's duty to be holy in emulation of the hallowed deity. This duty is independent of any place, whether the place of the unclean person or the "place" of the Lord's presence. (6) Milgrom, Leviticus 1-16, 85-86. (7) This fear of defiling the temple is the reason for the Torah's command to expel persons with an eruption or discharge, or defiled by a corpse, from the camp: "Instruct the Israelites to remove from camp anyone with an eruption or a discharge and anyone defiled by a corpse. Remove male and female alike; put them outside the camp so that they do not defile the camp of those in whose midst I dwell" (Num 5:2-3). In light of our discussion up to now, we must interpret these verses as requiring the expulsion from the camp of unclean persons, lest they defile — from wherever they may be in the camp — the tabernacle in their midst. Thus, it would be more accurate to understand "so that they do not defile the camp" not as the reason for their expulsion but as its result (but cf. Knohl, The Sanctuary of Silence, 173).</page><page sequence="4">372 AHARON SHEMESH The reason for the difference between these two texts lies in the dif ferent gravity of the uncleanness implied in each. Leviticus 15 deals with severe categories of uncleanness, which require seven days for purifica tion. Such uncleanness may defile the temple even at a distance. Chapter 11, however, is concerned with persons who have touched the carcass of a dead animal or "swarming thing," whose uncleanness is less severe, lasting only one day. Such uncleanness can defile only by direct contact, and the Torah therefore explains the need to cleanse oneself from it as due to a different cause. (8) It follows that God's place is in the tabernacle/temple, and there only. The obligation to cleanse oneself in the camp and expel the unclean is not due to the camp being holy. Its motive is that uncleanness within the camp may affect the tabernacle/temple standing in it. Indeed, there is no injunction to expel from the camp persons who have incurred the above-mentioned less severe forms of impurity. God's God's God's Location and the Laws of Purity and Impurity in the Temple Scroll Let us now examine the Temple Scroll in light of the above obser vations. Columns 48-51 deal with the laws of forbidden foods; the pro hibition of gashing or shaving the front of one's head; burying the dead; quarantining the unclean; and uncleanness due to contact with a corpse, with swarming creatures and with dead animals. In this unit, (9) the Scroll is essentially concerned with Lev 11 and 15. The unit ends with a final admonition to maintain purity (Temple Scroll 51:7-8). Comparison of this conclusion with the admonitory passages in Leviticus shows that it's author has combined the phraseology of the two biblical versions. Temple Temple Scroll And vou shall warn the children of Israel of all the uncleanness(es). And they shall not defile themselves with them, which I tell you on this mountain and they shall not be unclean. For I am the Lord, who dwells among the children of Israel; Leviticus Leviticus You You shall warn the children of Israel against their uncleanness. lest lest they die through their uncleanness by defiling defiling my tabernacle which is among them (Lev 15:31).

Leviticus Leviticus You shall not make yourselves abomi nable with anything that swarms; you shall not make yourselves unclean there with and thus become unclean. For I am the Lord your God: vou shall sanctify yourselves and be holv. for I am holy. You shall not make yourselves unclean with any swarming thing that moves upon the earth. For I the Lord am He who brought you up from the land of Egypt to be your God; vou shall be holv. for I am holy (Lev 11:43-45). The most significant point in the Temple Scroll s combined version is the replacement of the key words "lest they die through their unclean ness by defiling my tabernacle which is among them" — which, as we have point out, express the idea of "defilement at a distance" — by the formula from Num. 35:34: "For I am the Lord, who dwells among the children of Israel." (10) In the Bible, this expression is used to justify the prohibition on accepting ransom for a murderer's life, for "the land can have no expiation for the blood that is shed on it, except by the blood of him who shed it," so that "you shall not defile the land in which you live, in which I Myself dwell, for I the Lord dwell among the children of Israel." As we shall see later, the Temple Scroll understands this passage not as a geographical designation, but rather as an abstract description of the God Who dwells among the people, that is, within the community. It (10) The full verse reads as follow: "And thou shalt not defile the land which you shall inhabit, in which I dwell: for I the Lord dwell among the children of Israel." The Scroll's use of this verse in the context of the laws of purity and impurity indicates that the author understood "for I the Lord abide among the children of Israel" not as a geographical designation — the Lord dwells on earth — but as stating that God is present in the midst of the Israelite community. Further use is made of this expression in the Temple Scroll in connection with the ban on persons with physical defects from entering the temple city: "No blind man may enter it as long as he lives, lest the city in whose midst I dwell be de filed. For I, the Lord, shall dwell among the children of Israel forever and ever" (45:12 14). Weinfeld (Deuteronomy, 128-129) cites this law from the Temple Scroll, which is concerned with the laws of the temple city, pointing out the use it makes of a verse (Num(Num 35:34) relating to the sanctity of the land; in his view, this is an example of the tend ency, common in Second Temple times, to shift the national-religious center of gravity from the "land" toward the "city" and the "temple." Though the conclusion is no doubt correct, it would seem, in light of our explanation as implied by the further use of the verse in the Temple Scroll, that Weinfeld's proof is less secure; indeed, if the author of the Scroll understood the biblical expression as designating the divine presence in the community rather than in a place, its usage in relation to the city is as legitimate as in relation to the land.</page><page sequence="6">374 AHARON SHEMESH follows, therefore, that the replacement of the expression "my tabernacle which is among them" by "For I am the Lord, who dwells among the children of Israel" was necessary to enable the author of the Scroll to harmonize the two distinct motivations given in the book of Leviticus for the obligation to cleanse oneself. According to the Scroll, this obliga tion is due not to the fear of defiling the sanctuary where God dwells, but to the presence of God "among the children of Israel." This conside ration is in good agreement with the duty to be holy. As already stated, the biblical rationale "you shall sanctify yourselves and be holy" has no need of the divine presence; the need to purify oneself is implied by the sanctity of Israel themselves, who are enjoined to be holy in emulation of God. However, the Scroll also adds the reason "For I am the Lord, who dwells among the children of Israel," thus endowing the verse with the meaning that the duty of purification and sanctity is implied by the presence of God Himself within the community. There is a broad scholarly agreement that this passage and col. 29: 2-10 were written by the TS's redactor himself as seams serve to connect the different sections and sources together. (11) It is from these para graphs that we can learn best about the redactor theology and the way he wants to shape the composition as a whole. Thus, from the above dissua sion we can conclude that the redactor of the Temple Scroll rejects the priestly idea that uncleanness can defile the temple "at a distance," which stems from the perception that God's resides exclusively in the temple precincts. Instead, he attributes the obligation to remain pure to the God's presence everywhere within the people of Israel. By extending the scope of divine presence from the Sanctuary to all places, the redactor of the Temple Scroll has taken one step toward the Deuteronomic doctrine. Moreover, whenever referring to the divine pre sence in the temple itself, the Scroll generally employs Deuteronomic terminology. That is to say: God Himself does not reside in the temple — only His name and His glory (12) .(כבוד) Nevertheless, the theology of the Scroll's redactor is not completely identical with that of the book of Deuteronomy, but combines it with that of the book of Leviticus. At the conclusion of the laws of the festivals (29:2-10), which as noted above is also a free composition of the redactor himself, we read: ...in the house upon which I will cause my name to dwell [...] all their gifts which they will bring to me to obtain my acceptance of them. Then I shall accept them, and they shall be my people, and I shall be theirs for (11) Wilson &amp; Wills (above note no. 9); M. O.

And I will dwell with them forever and ever. And I will sanctify my temple with my glory. For I shall cause my glory to dwell upon it until the Day of Creation, when I myself shall create my temple, to establish it for me forever, according to the covenant which I made with Jacob at Bethel." (13) In this passage the author is concerned with the Temple itself. Notice, that he is careful to state that God Himself does not reside in the Temple: "in the house upon which I will cause my name to dwell," "and I will sanctify My Temple with my glory, for I shall cause my glory to dwell upon it." In this respect, as we have observed, he is following Deuteronomic theology. But he also employs another expression: "And I will dwell with them forever and ever," which has no parallel in the Bible. (14) In this expression the author explicitly express the idea that God is not confined to a specific geographical area but dwells with Israel everywhere. To deepen further my inquiry into the TS redactor's understanding of the concept of holiness as a result of God's presence, I rely myself on M. Wise notion of "redactional phrases." (15) Based upon analysis of the above two passages, Wise defined seven different "redactional phrases" which characterized the redactor language, and enable him to trace the footprint of the redactor in other parts of the scroll. This useful tool should be used not only for source critical study but to better understand the way the redactor reshaped the early material as well. In col. 46 we have two "redactional phrases" insertions of this type: "And every [unclean bird will not] be within my temple for ever and ever, all the days that [I dwell] among them" (Ins. 3-4); "And you shall make a fosse (חיל) around the temple ... so that they may not come sud denly into my temple and desecrate it. They shall consecrate my temple and fear my temple, for I dwell among them" (Ins. 10-12). At first sight, one might think that the words "within my temple [...][...] that I dwell among them" in the first passage are taken from the biblical verse Ex 25:8: "And let them make me a sanctuary that I may dwell among them," which we have cited as one of the classic examples of the perception limiting the divine presence to the Sanctuary. At first sight, the author of the Temple Scroll was somewhat careless here, ascribing God an abode in a specific place — the temple. Yadin, accord (13) On the meaning of the future Temple referred to in this passage see Y. Yadin, The The Temple Scroll, The Israel exploration Society, Jerusalem 1983, I, 182-187; D. Schwartz, "The Three Temples of 4Q Florilegium," Revue de Qumran 10 (1979) 83-91. On the covenant concluded with Jacob at Bethel see Yadin, 10c. cit.; Wise, A Critical Study,Study, 157-161. (14) If Yadin's restoration is correct than this expression occurs once again in the Temple Temple Scroll (47:3). (15) M. Wise Critical Study (above note no. 11) 133.</page><page sequence="8">376 AHARON SHEMESH mgly, argued that the author is inconsistent in his use of biblical expres sions: sometimes he follows Deuteronomic terminology, sometimes that of Leviticus, as if trying to point out that there is no contradiction bet ween such expressions occurring here and there in the Bible. (16) A fur ther difficulty, in Yadin's view, is the contradiction between the two descriptions of time in this passage. On the one hand, we have "within my temple for ever and ever," and on the other, "all the days that I dwell among them." (17) Both difficulties, however, evaporate if one observes that the passage is based, not on the verse in Exodus, but on another biblical source. We read in 1 Kgs 9:3 that God appeared to Solomon after the dedication of the temple, saying to him: "I have heard the prayer and the supplication which you have offered to me. I consecrate this house which you have built and I set My name there forever. My eyes and My heart shall be there all the days." Here we have a similar juxtaposition of "forever" (לעולם) and "all the days" (כל הימים), implying that the latter has the same connotation as the former and there is no contradiction. Moreover, although the verse emphasizes that it is God's name that will be in the house forever, not He Himself, His eyes and heart will nevertheless be there always — "My eyes and My heart" being a metaphor for God's constant attention to Israel's prayers direct ed to the temple. Hence the passage from the Temple Scroll should be parsed differently: "And every [unclean bird will not] be within my temple for ever and ever all the days, for [I dwell] among them." In other words, the word אשר should be translated not "that," but "for, because": the clause "for I dwell among them" is the reason for exclud ing unclean birds from the temple, not a description of the temple's location. This is quite different from the verse in Exodus, for there the words "I may dwell among them" refer to the divine presence within the sanctuary sanctuary/temple; while here the opposite is the case: God calls the house "My temple" because he dwells among Israel. The same under standing apply to col. 45: 12-14: "No blind person shall enter it (the temple city) all their days, and they shall not defile the city in whose midst I dwell because I, the Lord, dwell in the midst of the children of Israel for ever and always". God's dwelling in the temple city does not result from his presence in the temple but from being in the midst of the people. In light of this conclusion we should pay our attention to the following striking phenomena. Whenever the scroll deals with God's residing in the temple, he is very careful not to describe God himself there but His name or glory. But when he is concerning with God's resid ing in the midst of the children of Israel, he do not hesitate to say that it f 16) Yadin, Temple Scroll, I, 280; II, 128. (17) Ibid. II, 197</page><page sequence="9">THE HOLINESS ACCORDING TO THE TEMPLE SCROLL 377 is God Himself who dwells there. Apparently, only when the text is dealing with the divine presence confined to the temple does the author deem it necessary to stress that only God's name is there, not He Him self. But if the subject is the divine presence everywhere — which is in any case an abstract concept — he has no compunctions about stating that God Himself dwells with Israel. (18) It follows, therefore, that in regard to God,s location the redactor of the Temple Scroll is closer to the Deuteronomic perception: only God's "name" or "glory" dwell in the temple or sanctuary, while He Himself is among the Children of Israel. The redactor "plants" this idea in the text while rewriting the Priestly laws of purity and impurity. The Sanctity of the Temple and the Temple City Despite the Scroll redactor's conception of the deity as dwelling among the Israelites, he distinguishes between various places as to degree or level of sanctity, as expressed in the severity of the laws governing unclean things and persons there. First and foremost is the temple itself; then come the temple city, the other cities of the Land of Israel, and finally the land itself. We will now cite a few laws pertaining to these places, discussing the implications of those laws for the appro priate perception of sanctity. The Temple Scroll assigns Jerusalem, the city of the temple, a spe cial position, dictating special laws of purity and impurity. For example, it decrees that a person who has experienced a nocturnal emission or has slept with his wife shall be unclean for three days, during which he is forbidden to enter Jerusalem (45: 7-12): And if a ma[n] has a nocturnal emission, he shall not enter any part of the temple until [he will com]plete three days. And he shall wash his clothes and bathe on the first day, and on the third day he shall wash his clothes {and bathe,} and when the sun is down, he may come into the temple. And they shall not come into my temple in their niddah-like uncleanness and defile (it). And if man lies with his wife and has an emission of semen, he shall not come into any part of the temple city, where I will set my name, for three days. The Torah, too, considers the laws of a person with a nocturnal emission and a cohabiting couple in the same context: When a man has a nocturnal emission, he shall bathe his whole body in water and remain unclean until evening... And a woman with whom a man lies and has an emission of semen — they shall bathe in water and remain unclean until evening (Lev 15:16-18). (18) In cases where the city is the subject, the text exhibits some ambiguity. When it comes with conjunction with the children of Israel (as in 45: 13-14) it says: "the city in whose midst I dwell", but, in cases when it comes with conjunction with the temple itself it uses "my glory" or "my name" phrases (except in 47: 17-18).</page><page sequence="10">378 AHARON SHEMESH The law of the Temple Scroll differs from the biblical law in two respects: the Torah declares the man unclean for one day only, while the Scroll decrees three days; in the Torah, a man having a nocturnal emis sion must bathe only once, whereas the Scroll requires him to bathe twice — once on the first day and once on the third. Yadin suggested that the Temple Scroll derived this law from Moses' instructions to the Israelites before the theophany on Mount Sinai, forbidding them to cohabit with their wives for three days (Ex 19:15). (19) This would imply that the Israelites' camp in the wilderness, with the Sanctuary at its center, represents their positions around Mount Sinai; while the paral lei to this configuration in the Land of Israel is the city with the Temple at its center. Accordingly, Milgrom argues that the author of the Temple Scroll Scroll distinguished between the law of a person with a nocturnal emis sion in the temple city (who must remain unclean for three days and is expelled from the city) and the biblical law, which is concerned with a person already outside the camp, that is, outside Jerusalem, who is unclean for one day only. (20) Underlying this distinction, Milgrom believes, is the biblical conception that the presence of unclean persons in the Temple city (or the camp) may defile the temple (or the taber nacle) from afar; but that same uncleanness cannot defile the temple if the unclean person is outside the city. (21) The requirement that a person with a nocturnal emission should be expelled from the city is therefore conceptually similar to the biblical command to expel persons with a discharge or lepers from the camp. The author of the Temple Scroll indeed lists all these categories together in his instruction: "And you shall make three places to the east of the city, separated one from an other, into which shall come the lepers and the people who have a discharge and the men who have had a nocturnal emission" (46:16-18). Milgrom's explanation may be correct for the original source the redactor of the TS used for this law. However, in its final redacted phras ing, the clause explaining the law in question — "he shall not come into any part of the temple city, where I will set my name, for three days" — is not compatible with the above conception. The text stats explicitly that the temple city itself is the place "where I will set My name." (22) Milgrom's explanation requires a slight adjustment. It is indeed true that the Temple Scroll associates the laws of the camp in the wilderness with the temple and the temple city. However, while the Bible attributes the (19) Ibid., 1,287-288; Π, 192.

And the city, which I will hallow by setting my name and [my] tempfle within (it)], shall be holy and clean of any unclean thing with which they may be defiled; everything that is in it shall be clean, and all that will be brought to it shall be clean: wine and oil and foodstuffs and all liquids shall be clean. All skin of clean animals that will be slaughtered within their cities, they shall not bring into it; but in their cities they may do with them their work for all their needs; and into the city of my temple they shall not bring (them), for their (degree of) cleanness is according to (the degree of clean ness of) their flesh. And you shall not defile the city in which I settle my name and my temple; but in the skins (of the animals) that they will slaughter in the temple, in them they shall bring their wine and their oil and all their foodstuffs to my temple city. And they shall not defile my temple with the skins of their abominable offerings which they will sacrifice in their land. And you shall not purify a city of your cities to (the degree of) my city; for according to the (degree of) cleanness of its flesh is the (degree of) cleanness of the skins. If you slaughter it in my temple, it (the skin) will be clean for my temple; but if you will slaughter it in your cities, it will be clean for your cities. And all the purity (clean stuff) of the temple you shall bring in the temple skins, and you shall not defile my temple and my city in which I dwell with the skins of your abominations (47:3-18). In this passage (23) the Scroll distinguishes between the temple city and other cities; though all cities must be pure, the temple city must be "holy and clean of any unclean thing with which they may be defiled." The practical expression of this requirement is that foodstuffs may be brought to Jerusalem only in skins (that is, in containers made of skins) of animals slaughtered in Jerusalem itself, i.e., in skins of sacrificed ani mals. The key principle of this law is formulated as follows: And you shall not purify a city of your cities to (the degree of) my city; for according to the (degree of) cleanness of its flesh is the (degree of) clean ness of the skins. If you slaughter it in my temple, it (the skin) will be clean for my temple; but if you will slaughter it in your cities, it will be clean for your cities. The important point for our purposes is the repeated use of expres sions of the type we are discussing, that is made in this text, to define sanctity: . .the city in which I (shall) set my name and my temple"; and (23) According to Wise (Critical Study, 198) this passage is also the redactor's free composition.</page><page sequence="12">380 AHARON SHEMESH the whole passage ends with a similar expression: "my city in which I dwell." The new element is that a similar reason is given for the need to maintain the purity of other cities: God dwells therein. In accordance with Yadin's plausible completion of the text, the opening sentence should read: "And let their cities be clean and [I shall live... with them?] for ever." This expression, unique to the Temple Scroll as already noted, signifies the dissociation of the divine presence from any confined, hal lowed, physical area: God resides in the midst of the community — "with them" (אתם), regardless of any one geographical location. Thus the need to maintain the purity of the cities is also a result of divine pre sence. It is motivated, however, by God's presence not in any one city but among Israel as a whole.

The different perceptions of divine presence in Leviticus and the Temple Temple Scroll, and the different concepts of holiness and laws of impu rityrity in the camp in the wilderness as against those applied by the Temple Scroll Scroll to the temple city, which is identified with the camp, may be considered from another angle. There is no doubt that exegetical thin king was an important element of these differences. A central motive in the changing concepts of divine presence was the desire to create a har monistic system of the Bible itself: to reconcile the descriptions in Levi ticusticus with those of Deuteronomy. A similar approach may be taken to the different concepts of sanctity of the temple city and of the camp in the wilderness. The biblical accounts actually refer to two different reali ties, each pertaining to two geographical units. One reality is that of Israel during the wanderings in the wilderness, the other, that of their future life after entering the Promised Land. During the stay in the wilderness the Torah distinguishes two realms: that of the Sanctuary itself, on the one hand, and the camp around it, on the other. In that real ity any location outside the camp has no significance at all and is essent iallyially a kind of "no man's land," where lepers, persons with discharges and other severely unclean people are sent. In the context of the Promis ed Land after the settlement, the Torah again speaks of two realms: "the place that the Lord will choose" (24) and the rest of the land. In it's reshaping of the laws of purity the redactor of the Temple Scroll took an exegetical-halakhic step, which had necessary implications for the meaning of sanctity. By implementing the wilderness-related reality to (24) It is not clear from the Torah itself whether this chosen place is the city or the temple itself. For a discussion of this question and the interpretation of the tannaitic expression בית הבחירה see D. Hanschke, "The Sanctity of Jerusalem: Between the Sages and Sectarian Halakhah" (Heb.), Tarbiz 67 (1998) 5-28.</page><page sequence="13">THE HOLINESS ACCORDING TO THE TEMPLE SCROLL 381 the reality of the Holy Land, and comparing the temple city to the Israe lites camp, he produced at least three realms of holiness in the Land of Israel: the temple; the temple city (parallel to the camp in the wilder ness); and the rest of the country. This necessitates a change in the kind of sanctity attributed to the camp, for in Leviticus no particular holiness is assigned to the camp of itself: that the laws of purity must be maintained there and unclean persons expelled is a measure taken in order to avoid defiling the sanctuary. This is possible only in the biblical account, in which, as explained previously, there are only two realms of sanctity: the sanctuary and the camp. However, once Jerusalem, the city of the temple, is considered as parallel to the Israelite camp, one can no longer interpret the relevant laws of purity and impurity in such a way; for the laws of purity and impurity remain in force even at large dist ances from the temple, as implied by the sanctity of other cities. Hence the author is obliged to assign the temple city an independent category of sanctity, stemming from its status as the place chosen by God or from God's presence among the people of Israel. Conclusions and one possible Implication. Influenced by our reading of the Torah, we tend to describe levels of sanctity as decreasing in proportion to the distance from the source of sanctity: the source of sanctity is the temple, which possesses the supreme level of sanctity; on a lower level is the temple city, whose sanctity stems from that of the temple but is correspondingly less; and the sanctity of all other places is even less. Such a description, however, does not fit the picture drawn in the Temple Scroll. The sanctity of Jeru salem is independent, not necessarily related to that of the temple, and the sanctity of other places in the Land of Israel, though even less, does not depend on that of the city or of the temple. A wide range of scholarly speculations has been suggested for the identification of the Temple Scroll's author/compiler/redactor, for it's dating and origin. (25) However, even scholars who deny sectarian ori gins for the Temple Scroll agreed, that it was known to, and accepted by the Qumran community (26) .(יחד) I suggest that my analysis of the concept of holiness in TS contributes to better understanding of the attraction of TS to the Qumraniats. The sectarians, as we know, were forced to leave Jerusalem and settle in the desert, where they lived cut off from the temple — the hub of holiness. As many scholars have noted, the Qumran community (25) See the detailed survey of Wise, Critical Study, 23-31; L. H. Schiffman, Reclaiming Reclaiming the Dead Sea Scrolls, XX.XX.

(27) The shift made by the TS from the biblical conception as regards God's "location" — provided the sectarians with the necessary complement to the theory of their community as a surrogate temple. As laid down in Leviticus,Leviticus, the source of sanctity is the divine presence in the sanctuary or the temple; hence there is no sanctity — and no obligation to observe the laws of purity — without a temple. Only the new perception of the divine presence, the transition from the idea of a God dwelling physi cally in a geographical location to that of a God living in the midst of the community, made it possible for them to create independent lives of holiness.
