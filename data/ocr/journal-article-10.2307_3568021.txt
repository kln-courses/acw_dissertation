<plain_text><page sequence="1">Going Through the Motions: American Public Health and Colonial "Mimicry" Warwick Anderson "But what an imitator the Filipino is!" wrote Dr. Victor G. Heiser, after visiting a hospital in Sulu, during an investigatory trip he conducted in 1916 for the International Health Board of the Rockefeller Foundation (Notes 2: 537). Just a year earlier Francis Burton Harrison, the new governor-general of the Philip- pines, had forced Heiser to resign from his post as director of health. Now the wily, authoritarian hygienist, supported by the Rockefeller Foundation, had an opportunity to return to the archi- pelago and make life difficult for those who sought-prematurely in his opinion-to "filipinize" the American colonial bureau- cracy. In general, it was evident to him that health work had been degraded in his absence. The town of Legaspi, for example, had no latrines and was "filthy in the extreme" (2: 553). Heiser felt that Filipino infiltration of the public health service now meant that "politics seems to dominate everything for the worst" (2: 553). In Manila, "the dead spirit seems to pervade everything" (2: 570). "Natives" in the health service constituted a corps of pathetic im- itators of American public health, carelessly supervising lower- class imitative "natives" in the barrios. "There is a great ineffi- ciency and the machine is big and ponderous and the fuel does little more than oil the wheels, and progress is small, but this is to be expected with native control."' As they all went dutifully, slowly, through the motions, producing unfaithful copies of the American originals, Heiser watched, gleefully reporting on their deficiencies. "In leaving Manila," he wrote, it was "a satisfaction to see the indestructible monuments of cement which I left on the landscape and which they will be unable to destroy" (2: 621). Wherever he went in the colonial Philippines, Heiser found imitation, theatricality, ornament, and politics. There were times when he was heartened by Filipino enthusiasm for his projects. "Hookworm treatment is very popular with the people," he re- ported on a later visit in 1925. They "have become greatly inter- ? 2002 OXFORD UNIVERSITY PRESS AMERICAN LITERARY HISTORY</page><page sequence="2">American Literary History 687 ested in its prevention; now that they understand how it is trans- mitted they are voluntarily building large numbers of latrines."2 He was thrilled by local efforts to follow practices that he regarded as typically American. But these latrines would often turn out quite different from what he had imagined. "The question of su- perstructure is left entirely to the householder's wish and it is amazing to see the numbers of directions into which this feature develops."3 Nor were Filipinos seating themselves on their new toilets quite to his satisfaction. Heiser urged the local Rockefeller emissary, Dr. C. H. Yaeger, to modify the bowl design "to make it impossible to sit on except in the desired position."4 Out in the field, boring holes for yet more latrines, Yaeger himself was never sure when locals were making fun of his hygiene enthusiasms or subverting his projects. In one town, it was suggested that they might make a "wood carving of someone boring a latrine and sug- gested me. Well a joke is a joke and I didn't know if they were se- rious or not but took it in good spirit. What a reputation!"5 I want to return to the colonial excremental vision not so much to indulge in toilet humor as to discuss imitation and differ- ence in the new hygienic order, focusing on the role of mimicry in a colonial "development" project.6 Previously I have described an American poetics of pollution in the colonial Philippines, a racial- izing of germ theories that conventionally contrasted a clean, as- cetic American body with an open, polluting Filipino body.7 In the early twentieth century, public health officers argued that Fil- ipinos, evolving with local pathogens, would surely have been fashioned as natural reservoirs of disease organisms, containers that racial customs and habits kept filled to the brim. Filipinos, then, were cast along with other local fauna as disease dealers- even apparently healthy Filipinos might secretly carry the invis- ible pathogens from which supposedly pure and cleanly bourgeois Americans were typically exempt and to which they seemed typi- cally more vulnerable. "Natives" would thus appear as meretri- ciously healthy carriers and transmitters of local diseases, while those Americans who fastidiously restricted local contact were represented as innocent victims.8 As the American "lower bodily stratum," to borrow a phrase from Bakhtin, was erased or ab- stracted in tropical hygiene, the poorer class of Filipino, like other "natives," became the chief source of contamination and danger. In other words, the new tropical medicine, developing at the end of the nineteenth century, had led to an anthropomorphic mobi- lization of disease agency in the tropics as elsewhere, giving patho- logical depth and interiority to older racial and class stereotypes. I have called this a "poetics" in order to emphasize the way in which colonial public health officers attempted to close the struc-</page><page sequence="3">688 American Public Health and Colonial "Mimicry" ... afew select Filipinos seemed ever more reformable ... Positioned at the polluting pole of a binary typology, Filipinos were expected to confess their putrescence ... and to make themselves available for reformation. ture of medical metaphor and omit any relations of these texts to political practice. The closed system of equivalence and opposi- tion served to erase any historical or social context for disease pat- terns, substituting instead contrasting natural typologies, a poet- ics of purity and danger.9 But the Manichaean opposition in the medical text-the contrast of a white bourgeois American body, a formally expres- sive body, with a Filipino grotesque body-proved in practice excitingly assailable and perhaps necessarily unsustainable. Amer- ican self-possession was always fragile, and no matter how re- pressed, a secret rottenness kept resurfacing in even the most apparently abstracted of bodies, disturbing and reconstituting American identity. American males repeatedly broke down in the tropics, going native or becoming neurasthenic or nostalgic.10 On the other hand, a few select Filipinos seemed ever more re- formable, perhaps able through correct training to transcend their lower bodily stratum, and thus eventually to become eligible for social citizenship. Positioned at the polluting pole of a binary ty- pology, Filipinos were expected to confess their putrescence, to announce their desire for "civilization" or modernity, and to make themselves available for reformation. Medical and civic dis- courses were thus overlaid upon each other. The American civil authorities, unlike more repressive military figures, treated Fil- ipinos as infants in need of, and capable of responding to, bodily training and guidance in proper behavior, that is, subject to a "benevolent assimilation" into a sort of American adulthood. In heeding the gospel of hygiene Filipinos might therefore be given limited civic rights, becoming probationary citizen-subjects." As Woodrow Wilson remarked in relation to American duties in the Philippines, "[S]elf-government is a form of character and it fol- lows upon the discipline which gives a people self-possession, self- mastery, and the habit of order and peace. ... No people can be 'given' the self-control of maturity. Only a long apprenticeship of obedience can secure them this precious possession" (50-53). Un- like most other colonial powers at the time, the American regime thus began to supplement a project of native homogenization with limited individuation and developmentalism-evidently, the copy was becoming as interesting as any typological construction of difference. The newly recognized individual's moral reform was linked symbiotically to bodily reform, but the satisfactory achievement of both normalizations could, as Heiser attested, be endlessly deferred. Native imitations of American citizenship ap- pealed to the narcissistic demands of colonial officials, but these performances usually appeared belated, invalid, and unfaithful- that is, in need of further surveillance and discipline.</page><page sequence="4">American Literary History 689 Here I would like to extend this analysis and consider further the role of mimesis in the colonial "civilizing" process. I will focus on the Rockefeller campaign to prevent hookworm infection in the Philippines during the early 1930s, as this project demon- strates a medical effort to produce hybrid, imitative subject posi- tions for Filipinos and indicates the ways in which "mimicry" sometimes might expose these constructions.12 In the latrine busi- ness we can see the white man unloading his burden, making hy- gienic subjects who participate in that subject making, sometimes parodically. The story takes place during a period of rising na- tionalism and anti-Americanism in the Philippines, so the rela- tions of colonial hygiene and citizenship become especially clear. My study of the colonial "civilizing" process thus represents, in a sense, the lower stratum of an emerging body of literature on iden- tity formation in the colonial Philippines. In Pasyon and Revolu- tion: Popular Movements in the Philippines (1979), Reynaldo Ileto has reconstructed Philippine revolutionary mentality and traced the invention of "the Filipino" in the late nineteenth century; in White Love and Other Events in Filipino History (2000), Vicente L. Rafael describes the American colonial interest in racializing Fil- ipinos and their history. During the past few years, Michael Salman has identified the Philippine prison as a site for creating self-governing subjects, for the fabrication of citizens, laborers, and commodities; and Paul Kramer has implicated anthropology and exhibitions in the construction of a new colonial order in the archipelago. Of course the historian of medicine has to work with the markings of bodies, Filipino and American, and especially their orifices and excretions, the more private parts of colonial power. It seems to me that what we all do, in our various ways, high and low, is reveal the construction of a sensationalized racial contrast in the Philippines, and explain how colonial subjects, thus rendered visible and accessible, would then be trained or pre- pared for conversion or assimilation, an end indefinitely deferred. As Michael Taussig, in a different context, once put it, "[T]he frontier provides the setting within which the problem of disci- pline magnifies the savagery that has to be repressed and canalized by the civilizing process" (156). Or one might say that in the Philippines, American health officers were expressing a desire for that which the native could not be allowed fully to repress. I have referred to this as a colonial "civilizing" project, for that is the goal to which American bureaucrats in the Philippines aspired, but in the 1940s this task would come to be called "devel- opment." This essay may therefore be read as an account of a colo- nial precursor of the development discourse that proliferated af- ter World War II. The early effort to produce and implement</page><page sequence="5">690 American Public Health and Colonial "Mimicry" development knowledge would prove immensely influential, shap- ing later Rockefeller Foundation policies and stimulating other international agencies to conduct similar projects. Although "development" was soon taken up more widely by local elites and used as nationalist rhetoric, here it still appeared to offer, to Heiser and others, recolonizing possibilities. Indeed, one might argue that "development" never quite discarded the colonial legacy that pervades this story; it often seemed to repeat the older dichotomies of modernity and tradition, science and ignorance, global and local, purity and danger-only to characterize the subjects of de- velopment as arrested at stages in the traverse between these op- posites. "Development" remained, at heart, a "civilizing" mission, disempowering local communities and demanding that the "na- tive" or the "underdeveloped" person follow a single track toward a unique western modernity, not really expecting that this distant prospect, the light on the hill, would ever be reached. There are three main purposes toward which I push this es- say, making it trace a rather peculiar route through recent studies of colonial cultures, medical history, and the shaping of modern North America. I would like first to recapture the civic vision of medicine and science in a specific colonial setting and suggest that colonial power relations can become manifest even in a techni- cal discourse on bodily practice, mundane contact, custom, and habit. Of course, such an insertion of theories and practices of hy- giene into the historical study of the intimacies of colonial cul- tures is no longer startling, yet the recognition of the possibility of medical subject formation too often is left at that, without it be- ing, in a sense, "operationalized" in a socially meaningful way. Here I provide a case study of how agency was constructed and contested in the colonial Philippines through the promotion of hy- giene and bodily reform. I am suggesting that in framing disease one might also assemble an unstable framework for racial capaci- ties and national bodies (see Rosenberg xii-xxvi). But in this essay I also want to move beyond the case study, important as it is, and point to the need to consider the "colonial" as a process and cat- egory in the history of medicine and public health more generally. By this I mean more than the mere accumulation of homologies, or family resemblances, the notion that if it looks like something else it must "somehow" be related--that all medicine, for ex- ample, is "somehow" colonial in its relation to the body of the pa- tient.'3 Rather, I am suggesting that one can put together a specific genealogy of metaphors, practices, and careers that links the colony with the metropole and with other colonies, that one might follow people, technologies, and ideas as they move from one site to another. The medical doctors and bureaucrats we write about</page><page sequence="6">American Literary History 691 were often itinerants, with a global view of things that we histori- ans, so preoccupied with the local and constrained by nation or re- gion, are only now coming to appreciate. In a generally uncritical, unreflective way, these colonial technicians were prepared to find the modern in the colony, the colonial in the metropole. In this case, the traffic between the US and the Philippines, the Pacific crossing, allows us to recognize that colonial technologies of rule could also be used to develop the "nation" and its various disci- plines in both locations. Jose David Saldivar has urged us to look at the borderlands between the US and Mexico as "the spaces where the nation begins and ends" (388). But we should remem- ber that the colonial laboratories of the Philippines and Puerto Rico and Hawaii also were borderlands, where many were partic- ipating in the development of more than one national body. 1. A New Order of Colonial Hygiene In 1916, Heiser, believing that the filipinization of the colo- nial bureaucracy was premature, took special care to visit Sulu. The year before, the American health officer for the province, Dr. Ivan B. Hards, had approached a visiting US congressman to tell him that since Heiser had left office, the Filipino civil authorities had been grossly neglecting a cholera epidemic.14 But when Fran- cis Harrison investigated these allegations, Major L. A. I. Chap- man, the commanding officer of the local barracks, reported that Hards, perhaps "more interested in maintaining a paid civil prac- tice," had himself shown "but little interest in the cholera situa- tion:'5 Hards now "emphatically" denied having suggested ear- lier that his Filipino superiors disliked his reporting of the facts. "I have always been instructed by telegram and letters from my offi- cial superiors," he assured the authorities, "to report all cases of cholera occurring anywhere within the province."'6 Harrison re- garded the accusation, now retracted, as typical of the attempts of Heiser and other health officers to "discredit and destroy the work of distinguished members of their own corps." "Among the most annoying and vexatious incidents in the establishment of the civil regime here," the governor-general wrote to Washington, "has been the effort of certain medical officers to discredit the newly ap- pointed civil officers of the public health service:'." Hards resigned from his post late in 1915 and returned to the US. Harrison then replaced him with his deputy, Dr. Marcelino Gallardo-unlike Hards, Gallardo was reputed to have "distinguished himself dur- ing the Sulu cholera epidemic" and displayed "a correct under- standing of the fundamentals of combating cholera in accordance</page><page sequence="7">692 American Public Health and Colonial "Mimicry" with the best modern practice."'7 Yet it was Gallardo who prompted Heiser, as he passed through Sulu, to exclaim: "What an imitator the Filipino is!" (Fig. 1). Before 1914, Filipino physicians had generally occupied jun- ior positions in medical institutions under the control of the Philippine government. All six senior officers of the Bureau of Health in 1913 were American; the only Filipino division chief was Dr. Manuel Gomez of the statistics department. At the Philip- pine General Hospital, Dr. Fernando Calder6n was head of the obstetrics section, but Americans managed the other five units. The senior officers of the bureau's inspection division were, with few exceptions, American physicians, but their assistants all were Filipino. Only 2 of the 17 inspectors in the field were Filipino, yet all of the 9 junior inspectors were locals. Of the 27 district health officers-a lower-status job in the medical service-no more than 3 were American (Heiser, Annual Report 3-6). All senior instruc- tors at the new Philippine medical school were foreigners. Simi- larly, at the Bureau of Science, all senior researchers were Amer- ican or European. The first article by a Filipino published in the Philippine Journal of Science-Calder6n's discussion of obstet- ric practice in the archipelago-did not appear until 1908; the following year, Filipinos were junior authors of only 7 of the 47 papers presented in the journal. In 1913, Filipino investigators contributed to no more than 4 of the journal's 41 medical articles."8 During this period, Heiser and Dean C. Worcester, the iras- cible and influential secretary of the interior, repeatedly empha- sized the current incapacity of Filipino physicians for high office and their need for unremitting supervision and tutelage. The American colonialists thought it likely that Filipinos, after learn- ing the "whys and wherefores" of modern hygiene and sanitation, would eventually develop the skills and the sense of responsibility that American physicians recognized in themselves, but that goal still seemed far off (Heiser, "Sanitation" 124). Meanwhile Fil- ipinos should occupy junior positions where they could observe and imitate the more accomplished foreigners. Heiser took great pleasure in recalling a trip to the US with Dr. Francisco Cal- der6n-then "being groomed for an important administrative po- sition"-whom he watched over "as though I was his keeper" (Heiser, American Doctor's 192). According to Heiser, his charge was at a loss in modern society, unable "to conform to American notions of propriety" (194). "Things moved far too rapidly for him" (195), and when Calder6n addressed medical gatherings, Heiser was convinced that he "scarcely knew the meanings of the words" (198). Later, despite Heiser's misgivings, his Rotpeter be-</page><page sequence="8">American Literary History 693 Fig. 1. Dr. Luna, Dr. Heiser, Dr. Fajardo, and Dr. Gallardo at Jolo Hospital.

Before he was displaced as governor-general in 1913, W Cameron Forbes, a wealthy New England Republican, had been fond of socializing with Heiser and Worcester at Malacafiang and engaging with them in sweaty tennis matches and polo contests. Forbes too was reluctant to confer much responsibility on sup- posedly feckless Filipinos. In 1905, Forbes had written to his old friend William James, wondering if the philosopher had ever "travelled around the world on a recently developed map and figured out how many countries there are in the torrid zone and in the neighbourhood of the equator... and how many of them maintain self-government unsupported by men from the temper- ate zones."'9 Forbes was convinced that Filipinos as yet were "without the sinews necessary to maintain a position among the nations of the world."20 James suspected that this was indeed true but hoped that the American emissary would nurture the "soul" of the Filipino. Occurring at a time when the US was relying on a "collaborative compromise" with local elites to secure control of the islands, this exchange has a rather sad, detached, and self- serving tone. If he did not know in 1905, it must soon have become clear to Forbes that Filipinos continued to dominate commercial, professional, and political activities, even if they were excluded from the military, the American clubs, and the higher levels of the colonial bureaucracy. But the local elites proved capable of toler- ating an American rhetoric of superiority, so long as they were al- lowed to get on with business.</page><page sequence="9">694 American Public Health and Colonial "Mimicry" The enrollment of educated Filipinos in the institutions of American medicine, initially so gradual, accelerated greatly after 1914. Wilson, the new US president, had been elected on a plat- form that proposed early independence for the Philippines. Con- ventionally, Wilson argued that Americans should give Filipinos "a moral government which would moralize and sublimate their ideals" (52); having accepted the "compulsion of American char- acter" (52), locals might become true partners in government. Ac- cording to Wilson, the trajectory from savage to bureaucrat was already more or less achieved, their apprenticeship was virtually over-an attainment that Forbes and his acolytes would still dis- pute. It came as no surprise, then, that soon after Francis B. Har- rison, a Democrat congressman from New York, arrived in the ar- chipelago, he quickly announced his commitment to complete the filipinization of the colonial bureaucracy. The reformist governor- general declared portentously that "a new era is dawning. We place within your reach the instruments of your redemption. The door of opportunity stands open and under Divine Providence the event is in your hands" (Harrison, Inaugural Address 4-5). Harrison regarded the American colonial officials as a "stuffy body of restless, ambitious and adventurous young men" (Corner- Stone 81), ill-suited to their self-appointed task as tutors of sup- posedly ignorant Filipinos. He suspected that "as the attractions of Philippine life grew upon American officials, so grew their will- ingness to believe in the incapacity of Filipinos for office" (44). The number of American officials in the islands, including medical doctors and teachers, fell from 2,600 in 1913 to 614 in 1921 (Zaide 2: 248)21-the result in part of a deliberate policy of replacing Americans with Filipinos, but also a consequence of Americans leaving to fight in the European war and inveterate re- tentionists giving up in disgust at the drive toward independence. The passage through the US congress in 1916 of the Jones Act, which extended the powers of the Philippine legislature, con- firmed plans for early self-government, and disturbed those American colonial officials who doubted that Filipinos were ready to assume such responsibilities. When Heiser left the is- lands, he had been appalled that "many Filipinos were lifted into positions which they were not qualified to fill" (American Doctor's 56). His imitative subordinates had not yet gotten their act to- gether. Heiser had been prepared to allow locals to "direct the lesser units of government and, as they showed fitness, to turn over to them the higher units," but Harrison seemed to believe that "the only way for people to learn how to govern was to let them do the governing as they wished" (56). Worcester, also isolated by the drift toward self-government, had resigned as secretary of the in-</page><page sequence="10">American Literary History 695 terior in 1913, "firmly convinced that Filipinos are where they are today only because they have been pushed into line, and if out- side pressures were relaxed they would steadily and rapidly dete- riorate" (685). The task of "training physicians, surgeons and sanitarians so that the public health may be adequately protected" was not yet, he claimed, complete (693). "Shall they," he asked, "be left to stagger on alone, blind in their own conceit?" (695).22 Worcester continued to campaign strongly against the filip- inization of the health service, enlisting expatriate friends and col- leagues in the fight. The changes so incensed Dr. H. L. Kneedler, a physician who had worked as an insurance examiner in Manila since the American occupation and an associate of Worcester, that he wrote to Wilson, warning that the "weak puny bodies" of Filipinos would never be "transformed into a healthy vigorous race" if the "natives" were allowed to take over. When Kneedler first arrived, after the Philippine-American war, he had found the city's water grossly polluted; 40,000 or more died each year from smallpox; the lack of sewers meant that "noxious odors and gases were being constantly liberated"; 5,000 lepers were at large; and malaria prevailed. "Those in charge of sanitation under these ob- stacles soon learned," Kneedler wrote, echoing Heiser, "that the passive resistance of the Oriental is a much more subtle and diffi- cult force to overcome than the active opposition so frequently en- countered among the inhabitants of the temperate zone." Never- theless, a "system of sanitation" had been established, despite the "many efforts to avoid enforcement by the native Filipinos."23 And now this apparently childlike race was taking over again (Fig. 2). Heiser and many of his compatriots continued to find-in the failures to enforce smallpox vaccination, the recurrences of cholera, and a rising death rate in the archipelago-evidence of the unreadiness for office of the Filipinos they had trained. American papers unsympathetic to the Democratic administration declared that "the full harvest of the 'new era' is now in the reaping in the Philippines." "The filipinization wind," warned the New York Herald, 17 September 1916, had caused the incidence of plague to "jump" in the Islands (n. pag.). Even the increasingly filipinized health service conceded that in the city of Manila the mortality rate for each 1,000 inhabitants (42.28 in 1903, at the end of the war, but as low as 24.48 in 1913) had risen in 1918 to 46.33, and in 1919 was still 27.55.24 For Heiser this was a clear indictment on Filipino management. But Dr. Vicente de Jestis, the acting direc- tor of public health, had another explanation: the influenza pan- demic in 1918 had exacted a heavy toll in lives and caused a "weakened organic resistance" to other diseases among the pop- ulation.25 New outbreaks of smallpox were the result of a wearing</page><page sequence="11">696 American Public Health and Colonial "Mimicry" Fig. 2. 'An old Spanish type of toilet." Courtesy of the Rockefeller Archive Center. off of the immunity conferred in the general vaccination of 1905, the only thorough campaign that the Americans ever carried out in the islands. Cholera had appeared again, as it usually did, for the archipelago had never been free of the disease. Jesuis was con- fident that 1920 would show some improvement in the Philippine death rate. Using the now-standard sanitary methods, cholera had been checked and smallpox was again under control. "Health conditions are returning to normal," he reported, "and with the increasing efficiency of this Service on the one hand, and on the other, with the population becoming better enlightened regarding hygiene and sanitation and readier therefore to respond to and co- operate with our efforts, the steady decrease in the death rate ob- served during the pre-grippal years will no doubt be recorded again."26 General Frank McIntyre, chief of the Bureau of Insular Affairs, also defended the filipinization of the health service. He agreed that "unfortunately, cholera has visited the Philippine Is- lands every year since 1902." To charges of increased "friction" at the Philippine General Hospital, he replied that Heiser's earlier policies had probably caused the trouble, and currently care was as effective as ever, with no shortage of clinical material. All con- sidered, "the great public health work in the Philippines is going on and it is being extended as rapidly as the resources of the gov- ernment will permit."27 With the election of Warren Harding as president, Harrison was recalled in 1921. The new US administration appointed Cameron Forbes and General Leonard Wood, both professed foes of rapid filipinization, to report on conditions in the archipelago.</page><page sequence="12">American Literary History 697 Not surprisingly, they concluded that "the orderly process of pro- motion of proved efficiency from the less important positions was changed to a hurried filipinization, placing Filipinos in nearly all of the higher positions" (United States Special Mission 21). The report condemned the lack of hospitals and dispensaries, inade- quate appropriation for sanitary work, and shortage of properly trained doctors, nurses, and sanitary workers. It added that the "excellent health service which previously existed has become largely inert; much of the personnel remained, but it has lost the zeal and vigor which formerly characterized it" (21). Heiser liked to think that the "Harrison bonfire which had blazed so merrily for many years and round which the Filipinos had danced so blithely, finally flickered and went out, leaving only dead ashes" (American Doctor's 417). Having attached himself to the Wood-Forbes mission, Heiser took pleasure in visiting the is- lands again, once more "in harness at the old job of hauling the Filipinos out of the slough" (417). He felt warmly welcomed in Manila by his "prize cholera fighter," Jesis, who "seemed over- joyed at my return to share his responsibilities" (419). "He had al- ready had a desk placed beside his," Heiser recalled, "and offered to retire temporarily while I was there. I was never more touched than by this demonstration of trust" (419). But despite the Wood- Forbes mission's criticisms of filipinization, and Heiser's immense capacity to patronize Filipinos, the process continued even after General Wood was appointed governor-general. By 1925, only 1.5 percent of the civil service-not including teachers-was American (Wood 5).28 It was about this time that Heiser began or- ganizing the Rockefeller hookworm campaign in the Philippines, a scheme that would become a means of recolonizing health work in the archipelago and reintroducing American discipline and American role models (Fig. 3). For Heiser and many other American bureaucrats, there was only one right way to manage the colony, and only one way to in- habit it with propriety; Filipinos necessarily were unfaithful or in- adequate imitators of this model. But it is clear that many Fil- ipinos thought they were in fact doing something quite different. For example, it was still the opinion of many Americans, includ- ing Heiser, that Filipinos could not hope to evade fully their un- hygienic racial habits: thus any Filipino, until proved otherwise, would remain a contributor to tropical pathology. Educating out such ingrained habits would, it seemed, take generations; in the meantime only the strictest regulation would control them. But this made little sense to JesuIs and other members of the Filipino elite. For him disease stigma more properly belonged not to race but to social class. Thus while Heiser continued to look askance at</page><page sequence="13">698 American Public Health and Colonial "Mimicry" Fig. 3. "Build a bored- hole latrine." Courtesy of the Rockefeller Archive Center Filipino customs and habits, Jesuis argued for the "insanitary habits of the masses as the largest factor in the transmission of cholera and other intestinal diseases, such as eating with the fingers, carelessness in the disposal of excreta" (emphasis added). The bad behavior was the same, the ideal techniques of surveil- lance, persuasion, and enforcement altered little, but a simple racial understanding of tropical disease transmission dropped out of most Filipino epidemiological theory. It had become "the masses," not the race, "as yet untouched by either example or pre- cept."29 When Dr. Eugenio Hernando rehearsed the dogma of the "new public health" in 1919, the racial concerns that had per- vaded earlier tropical accounts of the subject were absent: he con- fined his remarks to the individual (of any race) and contact with infective discharges (5-7). Thus if cholera continued to be spread in the provinces, it seemed to the urban Filipino elite that this was because "the poorer classes"-and not their educated compatri-</page><page sequence="14">American Literary History 699 ots-continued to drink water contaminated by others of their low social stratum.30 The natural resistance to hygiene reform that Heiser took to be racial and illicit was, for many Filipino physicians, at once so- cial and comprehensible. Jesus, for example, repeatedly urged that the sanitary code "be given a certain flexibility, so that the appli- cation of certain regulations would be left to the discretion and sound sense of the district health officer" (Jesus 7). But sanitary regulations might, on other occasions, still be enforced severely. In 1914, Jesus had thought that the only effective way to eradicate cholera in the provinces was "through a trained central force sent from Manila and operating under direct supervision of the Bu- reau of Health in cooperation with the Constabulary"31 But if an apparent sanitary crisis could still elicit a military style of preven- tion, Filipino medical officers were more commonly claiming an increased sensitivity to local social values. A senior health official in 1929 observed that the conquest of disease "is so closely bound up with the economic condition and personal habits of the people that improvement must necessarily come gradually with sympa- thetic guidance and education." He incensed the great interven- tionist Heiser when he continued: "[F]ew things arouse greater re- sistance and antipathy than efforts to enforce changes in the daily lives of people and the conditions that surround them, and it is but natural that they should resist measures which, so far as they can see, are devised solely to make them unhappy and uncomfort- able."32 Such remarks prompted Heiser to reflect yet again on what poor imitators the Filipino physicians had proven to be. 2. The Germ of Laziness Under the American civil regime, the biological laboratory of the Bureau of Science examined specimens taken from the new tropical territory and from the bodies that inhabited it. Each day, scientists assayed more than 100 samples of body fluids and ex- cretions, mapping the pathological terrain of the archipelago and identifying the racial salients of disease. In 1909 alone, the scien- tists resentfully examined 701 specimens of blood, over 900 urine specimens, and more than 7,000 fecal specimens (Freer 16). When cholera broke out in 1914, the laboratory staff faced a deluge of over 126,000 fecal specimens, all requiring prompt diagnosis (Cox 11). The influx of Filipino material had indicated a widespread and often asymptomatic pathogen carriage, and generally the sci- entists attributed this condition to inherently racial "customs and habits," not to social disadvantage. The search for occult germ</page><page sequence="15">700 American Public Health and Colonial "Mimicry" carriage became an obsession of the biological laboratory. It prompted C. L. Cole in 1907 to survey the "natives of the Philip- pine Islands" for the presence of the hookworm Necator ameri- canus; P. E. Garrison organized a more orderly study of the "ani- mal parasites of man"; J. M. Phalen and H. J. Nichols reported on the distribution of Filaria nocturna among the local inhabitants; R. E. Hoyt presented the results of 300 examinations of feces "with reference to the presence of amoebae"; Garrison and R. Llamas described the intestinal worms of 385 Filipino women and children in Manila; and E. R. Stitt studied the intestinal parasites of Cavite province.33 At Heiser's request, Dr. David Willets went to the Cagayan valley where he made nearly 7,700 fecal examina- tions (see Willets). Weston Chamberlain reported that 92.5% of Igorots showed parasites in their stools, while 95.9% of lowland Filipinos were infected, though usually asymptomatic (see Cham- berlain et al.). Garrison claimed he had discovered "one of the most striking instances in the history of medicine of a population almost universally infected with animal parasites" (205). Even though many of these studies demonstrated widespread hook- worm carriage in the archipelago, Heiser, while director of health, would do little about it. American doctors in Puerto Rico were treating hookworm infestation far more seriously. A year or so after the American oc- cupation of the island, Dr. Bailey K. Ashford had identified hook- worm as the cause of the anemia that prevailed there. Ashford knew of the work of Charles Wardell Stiles, who in the 1890s had found hookworm in the stools of poor whites in the southern states.34 The pattern of behavior of this novel pathogen was soon established. Entering humans through the skin, usually through bare feet, the parasite eventually reaches the intestines by way of the trachea, esophagus, and stomach. Once in the duodenum, worms fix themselves to the intestinal walls and feed from the bloodstream, in time causing a marked anaemia. Blood loss might produce the symptoms of pallor, tiredness, and fatigue-thus hook- worm became popularly "the germ of laziness." The infected per- son, unknowingly, excretes thousands of ova each day, and if de- posited on warm, moist soil, the eggs generate infective larvae that seek another host. Although Stiles thought he had found Anchy- lostoma duodenale in the southern US, Ashford's worm was a new type, later called Necator americanus. Returning to Puerto Rico in 1902, Ashford, together with Dr. W W King, set aside two wards of the Ponce hospital for hookworm patients; the following year, the governor, William H. Hunt, allocated $5,000 for hookworm prevention and treatment (using an unpleasant, nauseating thy-</page><page sequence="16">American Literary History 701 mol mixture). The program expanded further in 1904, resulting in the establishment of the Hookworm Commission of Puerto Rico, which used mobile field hospitals and clinics to distribute infor- mation and provide treatment. When Ashford returned to the US in 1906, the commission continued its work, led by Puerto Rican physicians, and by 1910 more than 250,000 people had been treated in an effort to eliminate the germ that was sapping their in- dustry and efficiency. In the US, Stiles had been talking to Frederick T. Gates, the adviser of John D. Rockefeller, about the frightening prevalence of the germ of laziness in southern regions. Rockefeller, eager to pro- mote health and efficiency, decided in 1909 to fund a Sanitary Commission for the Eradication of Hookworm Disease and ap- pointed Stiles as scientific secretary and Wickliffe Rose as admin- istrative secretary. Hearing of Ashford's work in Puerto Rico, Rose visited the colony in 1910, hoping to use the Hookworm Commission as a model for health work in the southern US. He was impressed with the Puerto Rican program, which combined educational and dispensary activities. During the next few years, the Rockefeller Sanitary Commission set up similar organizations in each southern state. Led by a director of sanitation, who re- ported to the state board of health and to the commission, a corps of inspectors, microscopists, and laboratory technicians engaged in educational campaigns, diagnostic investigations, and the dis- pensing of thymol. Working mostly through newspapers, fairs, and the public schools, they produced articles, pamphlets, car- toons, and circulars, and delivered stirring lectures. They traveled from town to town, putting up exhibits of the hookworm, dis- playing models of sanitary houses and latrines, and exhorting the public to avoid the germ of laziness-it was a form of hygienic evangelism that often echoed the southern tent revival meetings. The local sanitary officers tended to racialize the message, though their more extreme opinions rarely received endorsement from the commission. Dr. Charles T. Nesbitt, for example, pointed to the African origin of the parasite and suggested a likely affinity be- tween it and African Americans: "The hookworms, so common in Africa, which are carried in the American Negroes' intestines with relatively slight discomfort, were almost entirely responsible for the terrible plight of the southern white. It is impossible to esti- mate the damage that has been done to the white peoples of the South by the diseases brought by this alien race" (74-75). Nesbitt interpreted such racial susceptibilities as evidence for the need to separate vulnerable and valuable whites from the intestines of African Americans. Stiles, in contrast, suggested that this ecolog-</page><page sequence="17">702 American Public Health and Colonial "Mimicry" ical detente meant that "the white man owes it to his own race that he lend a helping hand to improve the sanitary surroundings of the Negro" (Stiles 4).35 Although this campaign followed, in broad outline, earlier work in Puerto Rico, significant deviations soon became evident, especially in its relations with southern whites. The promoters of the "gospel of hygiene" in the US took special care to enroll local medical doctors and to appoint sanitary officers that already claimed the respect of their white communities. Such sensitivity to local concerns had been rare in the colonial setting when Ameri- can officers were program managers. Moreover, Rose and others in the southern states chose to emphasize dispensary work more than sanitary reform: they recognized the need for behavioral reform and a privy construction program but conceded that so- cial changes would have to be voluntary, not compulsory (as in the colony). The sanitation and treatment of African Americans, however, was frequently forced and blatantly "colonial." By 1914, Gates was satisfied that the Sanitary Commission had alerted white southerners to the microbial peril. As the hook- worm campaign was stimulating the growth of a network of state and local public health agencies, his attention had shifted to global health work. The new International Health Commission (later Board) of the Rockefeller Foundation needed a means of en- try into the colonial tropics, and hookworm seemed to offer ready access, just as it had in the southern US. The hookworm campaign might prove a tool permitting ingress to a colony, or a new state, and a means of enabling the Rockefeller Foundation to build, or rebuild, a health program. Rose soon became the head of an in- ternational hookworm program, setting up campaigns first in Egypt and then northern Australia, both modeled on the Sanitary Commission's work in the US. When passing through Manila in 1914, Rose recruited Heiser, the disaffected director of health, and made him director for the East of the International Health Board. Rose reported that Heiser's "demonstration that the superstitious and fixed customs of Asiatic natives can be transformed" was "one of the very best things he accomplished."36 Heiser, who had paid little attention to hookworm until then, would soon demon- strate that he could also become an indefatigable warrior in the sanitary battle against the germ of oriental laziness. When Heiser's successor, Dr. J. D. Long, compiled the an- nual report of the Philippine Health Service for 1915, he scarcely mentioned hookworm, but he did include a lengthy consideration of persistent "soil pollution" in the archipelago. Although climate and terrain had been exonerated as causes of illness in the tropics, as elsewhere, it seemed that native customs and habits might yet</page><page sequence="18">American Literary History 703 pollute and render dangerous the otherwise salubrious soil. Health officers feared that Filipino "promiscuous defecation" would spread the germs of typhoid and cholera-hookworm no doubt figured in their concerns, but they rarely mentioned it. At- tempts to install a pail system of toilets in the Philippines had failed, since it was difficult to "secure personnel for the repulsive work of collecting, dumping, and cleaning the pails, and any part of the system from the pail closet to the pit where final disposal is made, may easily become a nuisance if there is the slightest relax- ation of sanitary precautions or lack of intelligent supervision" (Long 56).37 The sophisticated privies favored by the Sanitary Commission in the US would be far too expensive for an impov- erished colony. Health authorities had therefore resorted to a simple pit, in which body wastes were deposited and covered with earth or lime, but this rapidly became a breeding place for flies. In Antipolo they developed a closet in which the pit was covered with slabs of stone or concrete, the preferred construction material of colonial modernity. The Antipolo closets included a galvanized iron pipe for ventilation and a fly-proof seat from which a pipe led down to the excrementitious depths. It proved cheap and effective, though Long feared that the typical Filipino excretory system would soon overload it, and he warned against its use in public buildings. Still, Long believed that providing better toilets would be "far reaching beyond calculation in the education of the ris- ing generation, who will continue the sanitary habits inculcated during their period of school life. .... When this has come about, the nightmare of water-borne epidemics and the economic in- efficiency due to intestinal parasites will have disappeared" (57) (Fig. 4). Soon after leaving office in the Philippines, Heiser an- nounced that "effort should be continued to control intestinal parasites, to extend malaria control work as rapidly as the field studies warrant, to encourage the use of latrines, and other cam- paigns to make friends for the health department."38 Under his di- rection, the Philippine activities of the International Health Board, through to the early 1930s, would concentrate on medical and nursing education, hookworm eradication, and malaria con- trol. Heiser thought that these projects would prove the most effective means to "promote self-help and prosperity in a needy, (I must admit it!) exasperating, and hitherto irreconcilable people."39 In 1922, the foundation loaned Dr. William S. Carter to the medical school at the University of the Philippines, where he acerbically evaluated and supervised the training of Filipino doc- tors. Later that year, the first field experiments began in malaria control, initially managed by W. D. Tiedeman and then by J. J.</page><page sequence="19">704 American Public Health and Colonial "Mimicry" Fig. 4. A hookworm dispensary at Las Pifias, Rizal. Courtesy of the Rockefeller Archive Center. Mieldazis and Paul F. Russell. They emphasized the provision of mosquito nets and screens, enlistment of schoolchildren in anti- larval measures, better drainage, and the spraying of Paris green. In developing a malaria program that involved surveys, field re- search, control demonstrations, and the training of medical and subordinate personnel, the Rockefeller emissaries produced a model for later disease-centered projects in India and other parts of the colonial tropics. The Rockefeller Foundation thought it could do better at toilet training refractory Filipinos than the increasingly filipinized health service, with its "imitative" Filipino doctors--allegedly less fastidious than Americans-who now were largely in charge of the civilizing mission. A hookworm survey conducted in 1922 indicated that infection had increased during the previous 10 years; Filipinos apparently were still polluting the soil and avoid- ing latrines, especially in rural areas. Heiser lamented that "the habits of the people are such that the control of intestinal borne diseases is extremely difficult."40 When Dr. Charles N. Leach vis- ited Cebu in 1923 on behalf of the International Health Board, he reported that almost 80% of the inhabitants harbored hookworm; and yet, during the past few years, 26,000 had received treatment with carbon tetrachloride, an effective vermifuge, though some- times toxic to the liver.41 Leach advocated the "frequent instruc- tion of school children residing in infected areas regarding the dangers of soil pollution and the methods by which hookworm disease can be avoided." He hoped, too, for more mass treatment with carbon tetrachloride.42</page><page sequence="20">American Literary History 705 Traveling through the southern islands in 1922, Dr. E. L. Munson reported that "some of the sanitary inspectors are un- questionably inert and incompetent." They were permitting wide- spread soil pollution and did little to encourage latrine construc- tion.43 Heiser also thought the problem was not a lack of money, but the failure of Filipinos to offer "intelligent and forceful direc- tion'" There were too many councils, committees, and advisers, and not enough American know-how and efficiency.44 It seemed to Heiser that the Rockefeller Foundation might make available a better model of health work, just as his old health service had once served as an exemplar of proper conduct. At the medical school, Carter was finding it "discouraging to try to do something for people who will not do anything for themselves, and I am free to say that the inertia of these people passeth all understanding."45 He regretted that "these people are so blinded by their mistaken ideas of patriotism that they cannot see things in the light of effi- ciency."46 That the Filipino was a mere perfunctory imitator of American medical ideals became a Rockefeller litany. Of course, this was exactly what Heiser wanted to hear. In 1927, Dr. E. B. McKinlay, a representative of the International Health Board, confirmed that "it is most difficult to stimulate the native worker to do more than his daily routine work. ... The scientific tone is in general very low." "All will agree that the mass of Filipinos rep- resent an inferior race," he wrote to Heiser. "They are not in a po- sition to know what's best for them.'"47 It was not until the late 1920s that the Rockefeller Founda- tion would sponsor rural health demonstrations and sanitation studies. In 1928, Dr. C. E Moriarty first suggested to Heiser the establishment of a demonstration unit for rural sanitation in Cavite province-a poor, malarious region accessible from Manila. A model system, it would make available clean water, a sanitary excreta disposal system, antilarval methods for malaria control, dispensaries, immunization programs, education, and propaganda. "The Filipino is not usually capable of independent judgement due to his environment and relative lack of culture," warned Moriarty. "He must have a routine program and should be taught only one method for each task."48 The following year, the town of Calauan, in Laguna province, was chosen as the site for the first demonstration unit, in part because it boasted a death rate of 64 per 1,000 people, compared with 26-28 per 1,000 in other rural areas. The pioneer primary health care project would improve the water supplies, investigate the suitability of various sanitary latrines, replace sanitary inspectors with public health nurses, develop the school health program, enforce immunization, and ensure better mother and baby care. Heiser specifically in-</page><page sequence="21">706 American Public Health and Colonial "Mimicry" structed C. H. Yaeger to get rid of the male Filipino sanitary in- spectors and have the more pliant nurses conduct "repeated in- tensive house-to-house public health education."49 He hoped that the Laguna unit would soon be "coming to grips by intimate per- sonal contact with health problems."'50 By the end of the year, Yaeger could report that police were dealing with unsanitary nui- sances and nurses were promoting personal and domestic hygiene, giving "special emphasis to the importance of using latrines." He was in charge of a special "boring squad" and was delighted to point out that, thanks to the Rockefeller Foundation, "now la- trines are being built every day."51 Yaeger set up another demonstration unit at Navotas, in Rizal province, in 1931, where he concentrated again on ousting the sanitary inspectors and boring holes for latrines. A few years earlier, when Yaeger had investigated health work at Daet, he found that the local sanitary officers spent a lot of time on "gen- eral inspection," which meant "loafing if we judge by results.""52 Both he and Heiser wanted to remove them, but they met consid- erable opposition. "'Replacement by nurses,'" he wrote to an in- sistent Heiser, "I suppose I would dream that if latrines didn't interfere. I have had all kinds of verbal promises and suave agreements, and even letters and resolutions on the sanitary in- spector problem, but excuses come in persistently.""53 Heiser be- came more impatient and demanded some clear evidence of suc- cess. Yaeger simply asserted that substituting public health nurses had already led to excellent results. "This is as we expected," Heiser replied. "Nurses are so much better trained, have superior access to the family, and do not have to serve as assistants to the doctors."54 But Paul Russell pointed out that there was great re- sentment of nurses "for enforcing the regulations regarding sani- tary toilets" and ignoring local sensitivities." One of these nurses described how she went about her duties. Ignacia Limjuco pro- moted the importance of cleanliness and correct eating; she warned against overcrowding and poor ventilation; she was dedi- cated to the propagation of school hygiene and the "proper dis- posal of excreta" (23). As a nurse she demanded assent to modern science, to the knowledge that an individual was "an arsenal of germs" and that the mouth was nothing more than "the gateway of infection" (21). In 1933, though, the provincial council stopped its part of the funding of nurses like Limjuco and spent the sav- ings on a carnival. "They evidently preferred carnival exhibits," lamented Yaeger, "to saving babies and other public health work."56 According to the Rockefeller emissaries, male Filipinos remained feckless and childlike, fond of entertainment, decora-</page><page sequence="22">American Literary History 707 Fig. 5. "Every home is visited by a nurse who gives sound advice and treatment." Courtesy of the Rockefeller Archive Center. tion and political gambits. They still did not know what was best for them (Fig. 5). "Politics, personal opinions, the retrenchment policy of gov- ernment," explained Yaeger, "seemed to come up daily, and with- out any official power on my part made the work seem almost hopeless."57 Indifference and opposition meant that he was far from his goal of 100,000 bored holes. At times Yaeger was still op- timistic: "The spectacle of boring and particularly of blasting is one which appeals strongly to the people.... This appeal to the imagination is an important aid in attempting to persuade a com-</page><page sequence="23">708 American Public Health and Colonial "Mimicry" munity to install a large number of latrines. There is nothing dra- matic about the old pit latrine."58 But more often he was disap- pointed. "In one instance," he reported, "too much insistence on latrine installation resulted in an anonymous letter threatening the life of the district health officer."'59 Just before it closed in 1934, Yaeger admitted that the Rizal health unit had been nothing but "a little volcano."60 In 1930, Heiser had met with Dr. Jacobo Fajardo, the new di- rector of health in the Philippines, and tried to impress on him that "the ultimate success of health work in the Philippines would depend upon the degree of education of the masses and that the best hope there lies in a sound school health program."61 The need for education and reform was a truism of progressive public health, and Filipinos were already well aware of its importance. A few years earlier, Dr. Agerico B. M. Sison had urged the state to teach proper care of the body and fastidious behavior in the public schools. "The masses need to be informed of the rudiments of hy- giene and public health," he wrote (123). It was crucial that more effort was made to "inculcate the principles of hygiene and sani- tation in the more plastic minds of the school-children" (124). In- deed, health education had been molding the minds of Filipino children for many years by this time. Teachers were compiling a "health index" for every child in their class: a healthy child would possess a "well-formed body," "clean and shining hair," "a clear skin of good color," "ears free from discharge," "a voice of pleas- ing quality," "an amiable disposition," and so on (Bureau of Edu- cation).62 Every child was supposed to be weighed once a month, with height measured at least twice a year. If anything was amiss the teacher was expected to report it to the local health officer. It was also the duty of the teacher to "instruct pupils to care for themselves and to put into practice both in the school and at home miscellaneous health principles" (33). Children learned of the dangers of raw vegetables, impure water, poorly ventilated houses, a sedentary way of life, and deformed posture. Every child was en- joined to carry a clean handkerchief, drink at least a cup of milk every day, sleep between 10 and 12 hours each night (under a mos- quito net), bathe daily, wear shoes, wash hands before eating, never touch food, and defecate fastidiously. It was even suggested that "the construction of a toilet, either in his own home or that of a neighbour, should be a project for each seventh-grade boy" (49). As Fajardo announced in the commencement address at the nurs- ing school in 1931: "Many of our major health problems now, such as infant mortality, tuberculosis and respiratory diseases, can only be satisfactorily solved with the aid of personal hygiene, which means an alteration in daily habits of the individual, and</page><page sequence="24">American Literary History 709 such alteration can be accomplished by one means-education" (174). The Philippines were thus reconfigured in medical texts as a laboratory for the production of self-possessed citizens, individ- uals who would regulate their own intimate behavior and personal contact. Fajardo wanted each nurse to become "exemplary as a good citizen, interested always in the best solution of public ques- tions, social and health problems, and in everything that pertains to the community" (175). But Filipino doctors, nurses, teachers, and the subjects they were supposed to be molding would find that the achievement of self-government, of corporeal and social citi- zenship, was difficult to validate: for Americans like Heiser it was never quite satisfactory, always premature, and poorly imitative. As Americans registered the performance of hygienic cit- izenship as inadequate, partial, or perfunctory, they took it to imply that continued surveillance and discipline were required in the colony. For example, as Yaeger observed, most of the teachers who had the responsibility to educate children about latrines themselves lived in houses without privies. "It is almost unbeliev- able," he wrote to Heiser, "to think that the very teachers who are following health education department instructions can keep talking latrines to the students and not make an attempt to live in houses with latrines themselves." The idea of privy-deficient teachers pretending to preach sanitation disturbed and unsettled him. They did not seem to take the message seriously. He could see no excuse "for a single teacher being allowed to teach without hav- ing a latrine."63 Toward the end of his stay in the archipelago, Yaeger reported that he was "very much disappointed in the re- sults among the people in general of public health education. Per- haps I expect too much."64 The Rockefeller health adviser did not believe that most Filipinos were ready for self-government, whether of the body or the polity. "Level-headed persons in gen- eral," he mused, "see only a gloomy future if the present provisions for independence are not changed."65 In 1933, after dinner in Manila, Heiser too found himself "rather exhausted this evening after a full day of struggling with the Malay mind.'66 As the archi- pelago moved toward independence, the Rockefeller Foundation decided to cut its losses and close down its programs. "I was none too well impressed with the zeal or the manner in which our activities were conducted," Heiser reported in 1931 to E F. Russell, the head of the International Health Board. "I suppose the tropics have a tendency to promote apathy."67 Pri- vately, Heiser noted: "Our own work lacked logical planning, ini- tiative and punch .... [Paul] Russell was more interested in travel- ling somewhere than thinking of practical malaria control. Yaeger, while doing brilliant things in the mechanics of boring</page><page sequence="25">710 American Public Health and Colonial "aMimicry" holes, lacked perspective in spreading the work on an island-wide basis."68 Yaeger had never bothered to establish the baseline for the rural health programs, so it was impossible to ascertain their effectiveness. Heiser criticized his junior colleague's "inability properly to set forth his work on paper."69 The Americans had themselves been shown up as illogical and lacking initiative and perspective; Yaeger was demonstrating a childish fascination with boring holes everywhere. Filipino imitations of American hygiene had drawn attention to the inadequacy of the American models- were the Rockefeller emissaries themselves perhaps mimics? After all, elite Filipinos were fond of saying that the Americans were no more than flawed copies, crude imitators, of Europeans. Americans were most anxious about revealing any affiliation with the practices they regarded as typically Filipino. Paul Russell had frequently complained that "local doctors will not get their feet muddy except in cases of urgent personal necessity, as when being chased by beast or potent superior officer."70 But his criti- cisms of others were often turned on himself. Heiser remarked wryly that "the itinerary of your southern trip includes many of the Islands' best fishing places, at all of which there seems to be a dearth of malaria-transmitting Anopheles."71 Neither Yaeger nor Russell would leave anything of value behind in the Philippines. Others fared much worse, breaking down or "going native." Mo- riarty, according to Heiser, "did nothing the first five or six months except consume alcohol." He refused to go out on field trips and indicated he would like a job in India, where, it was suspected, "if no results followed the blame could be put on religion, caste, and superstition."72 Heiser interviewed him in Manila. "After a long diatribe against Filipino inefficiency and unreliability, and the im- possibility of obtaining results," Heiser reported, "I asked [Mori- arty] point blank how much his drinking habit had interfered with his work."73 Moriarty resigned on the spot. But eventually Heiser would also suffer from his interactions with the poor Filipino "im- itators." His disparaging of their political activities and their cease- less self-promotion would draw attention to his own intrigues and egotism. In 1934, E E Russell forced him to resign, having tired of his irritability, his scheming, his resentment of rivals, and his claims, as a cacique of tropical hygiene, to own the Orient.74 Who, then, was imitating whom? Who was not imitative? 3. Conclusion: Uncanny Hygiene Nancy Tomes has argued that in the US during this period "notions of public health citizenship..,. offered a seemingly neu-</page><page sequence="26">American Literary History 711 tral ground for building consensus, for purposes of both inclusion and exclusion" (19). Heiser had dreamed of fabricating such self- possessed hygienic citizens in the Philippines, and he had prom- ised that, in the indefinite future, needy "natives" would be trans- formed into a respectable proletariat. But it was hardly a neutral ground, and frequently it seemed to him that Filipinos were sub- verting his designs, that they remained incomplete, unfinished; he was fond of representing local inhabitants as unstable hybrids, dressed natives, mere imitators. No longer simply the polar oppo- sites of bourgeois Americans in civic decorum, Filipinos allegedly were becoming flawed or profane copies. As Homi Bhabha re- minds us, "colonial mimicry is the desire for a reformed, recog- nizable Other, as a subject of a difference that is almost the same but not quite" (126). Repeatedly Heiser imagined hybrid Filipinos seductively attesting to their unreadiness for self-government. In order to reveal more clearly their poor mimesis of American hy- giene, Heiser tried to create islands of good conduct and rigorous discipline in the archipelago, supervised by American doctors. The health demonstration units in Rizal province were utopian medical microcolonies designed, like the Culion leper colony, to produce, in the distant future, citizens who avoided promiscuous contact and forswore irresponsible habits.75 As usual, Heiser ex- pected, and indeed hoped, that American supervision and disci- pline would have to go on for generations before this goal was achieved. The medical marking of mimicry, the insistence on it as a sign of developmental delay, thus still functioned to limit bound- ary crossing in the Philippines and worked to defer the entry of Filipinos into civic modernity. If Filipinos, even Filipino doctors, were so obviously and so poorly imitative, then they had not yet developed a fully adult American subjectivity, and could not yet be counted as authentic citizens. And yet, an awareness of mimicry, an uncanny sense of the copy, might also inadvertently challenge the boundaries of citi- zenship in the colony. A supposedly mimetic performance at a deeper level could serve to reveal the artificiality, the play, of con- ventional distinctions between native and Other, to illuminate and make strange the "cultured self" of the colonialist, to disturb a narcissistic overvaluation of his own mental processes, eating away at his sense of authenticity and control. There were moments when the whole project of colonial hygiene and bodily reform came to appear a little silly, and self-proclaimed models of fastid- ious conduct realized that they looked foolish, inadequate, and self-deceiving. Surrounded by "imitation," the constructedness of their own identity was, on occasion, revealed to colonial officials and Rockefeller emissaries in the Philippines.76 In imagining pro-</page><page sequence="27">712 American Public Health and Colonial "Mimicry" fane copies of themselves, they would experience an uncanny dou- bling. In 1919, Sigmund Freud described the uncanny as the se- cretly familiar that has been repressed and then returns in a dis- torted form.77 The figure of the Filipino imitator of hygiene was thus revealing what ought to have remained hidden, that which Americans sought to overcome or repress in themselves, their own supposedly infantile or primitive or underdeveloped elements, the abject that returns to disturb identity. At the beginning of the essay, I framed this Philippine proj- ect in terms of North American history because I wanted to sug- gest that a study of the disciplines of hygiene in the Philippines might tell us as much about the making of modern American iden- tities as about Philippine history. Cultural assumptions and pat- terns of behavior that pass as unremarkable at home may be re- vealed with special clarity in a colonial setting. Racial boundaries are etched more deeply on the margins, where corporeal difference can appear more threatening, incommensurability of values more disturbing, and the need for bodily reform and behavioral change ever more pressing. Displaced from the reassuring civic structures of home, lurching between evangelism and nostalgia, colonial emissaries would often find their new circumstances unsettling, with local inhabitants indifferent or hostile to their projects, or us- ing them for other purposes, or perhaps engaged in parodic imi- tation of them. In the interactions of Americans and Filipinos it was always hard for the participants to be sure just what was occurring. Out of this play of assertion and uncertainty came alterations in the style and form of the hygienic management of populations, and in the self-fashioning it engendered. An intimate circulation and repatterning of public health ideas and practices was taking place, and as models passed from place to place, they would be readjusted before moving on. Thus hookworm control in Puerto Rico gave rise to hookworm control in the southern US, and then, having been adapted again, it was exported by the Rockefeller Foundation to colonial and protonational parts of the world. Career paths, too, might link sites that otherwise appeared quite separate and unrelated. Dr. Allan McLaughlin, after trying for years to convert Filipinos to the gospel of hygiene, became commissioner of health in Massachusetts, where he "set the pace and direction for reorganization" (Rosenkrantz 142). The career of J. D. Long connected the San Francisco Health Department, the Philippines Health Service, and the Pan-American Sanitary Bureau: making analogies between colonial discipline and urban health in Asia and the Americas, Long would later draft national health codes for Chile, Panama, and Uruguay. In the late 1930s, Heiser became an expert in industrial hygiene and a spokesman</page><page sequence="28">American Literary History 713 for the National Association of Manufacturers in the United States: he could detect few differences between promoting hygiene on the factory floor and in a tropical jungle; he asserted that African-American physicians would inevitably be poor imitators of originals like himself.78 Notes 1.
