      <p>Since the introduction of the term “Neolithic revolution” to characterize the political, social, and economic transformations that accompanied the invention and spread of farming technologies in the Near East (Childe 1934), archaeologists have engaged in an intensive research effort to explain why the transition to agriculture took place when and where it did, the particular means by which it is likely to have occurred, and its likely effects upon the political and social organization of early farming communities within the region. Considerably less attention has been devoted to the impact of agriculture on social relations, particularly those concerning gender. While the reciprocal effects of social and technoenvironmental developments were addressed by Barbara Bender more than thirty years ago (1978), they have only recently begun to be explored in depth. In this article I critically examine some of the traditional narratives of early agricultural societies in the region and draw attention to recent research that challenges traditional assumptions about gender roles and relations in early human societies. Perhaps the most important assumption in need of revision, since it has been so pervasive in the literature and because it is used to legitimize normative gender roles in the present, is the belief that male and female roles in early prehistoric societies were clearly and separately defined. As we shall soon see, recent archaeological research demonstrates the inadequacy of polarized categories to account for the social relations of production at this time and challenges generic models of task allocation, even within the fairly circumscribed area of the ancient Near East (fig. 1).<fig-group content-type="figgrp" id="fg1" position="float" seq="1">

      <p>I will consider four major areas of research in this article: subsistence, bioarchaeological evidence, sedentism and the built environment, and ritual and symbolic behavior. While dividing the evidence in this way runs the risk of artificially dissociating one area of research from another, it allows for greater clarity in addressing some of the major issues and problems inherent in traditional approaches to early agricultural economies and in identifying some of the more recent, social approaches that are helping to reshape our understanding of gender relations and gender identities during one of the most formative phases of human prehistory.</p>

         <p>Although Vere Gordon Childe’s revolution aptly conveys the profound nature of the socioeconomic changes that accompanied the transition to agriculture in the ancient Near East, it connotes a suddenness and rapidity that do not accurately reflect what we now know to have been a long and uneven process of socioeconomic change. Writing in the 1920s and 1930s, well before the advent of radiocarbon dating and other methods of absolute chronology that are now standard in the field, Childe had no way of measuring the rate at which mobile populations of hunter‐gatherers in diverse environments began to settle down into more permanent communities and adopt new subsistence practices involving the domestication of plants and animals. Today, it is widely acknowledged that the transition to agriculture was a long‐term process rather than a short‐term event and one that did not occur uniformly in all places at all times, progressing differentially in fits and starts over the course of several millennia (for rough chronological spans of the various periods, see table 1).1<table-wrap id="tb1" position="float" seq="1">

         <p>Archaeologists generally agree that a variety of external forces were instrumental in the adoption of agriculture in the Near East, but there has been far less agreement on the role of internal social factors. A number of recent works on early agricultural and pastoral societies are quick to emphasize the lack of scholarly concern about the effects of this fundamental transformation upon social relations, social inequality, and the gendered division of labor, but little explicit research on gender has been carried out to date.2 In the remainder of this section I will review some of the traditional binary models that frequently recur in archaeological and anthropological studies of hunter‐gatherers and early farmers and consider recent approaches to early subsistence strategies that suggest new ways of interpreting the evidence.</p>

            <title>The gendered division of labor among hunter‐gatherers</title>
            <p>Since agriculture in the ancient Near East emerged among communities of complex hunter‐gatherers, many of whom had begun to cultivate various wild species of plants and had adopted sedentary or semisedentary lifestyles, archaeological interpretations of the gendered division of labor in early agricultural societies have been based to a large extent on ethnographic evidence for the division of labor among nineteenth‐ and twentieth‐century hunter‐gatherers. Apart from the obvious anachronisms involved, the reliance on ethnographic models, which are also prone to gender bias, has tended to transfer stereotypical assumptions about male and female roles from social anthropology to archaeology (Bolger 2006, 456–68). It is therefore not surprising that George Murdock, creator of the Human Relations Area Files at Yale, attributed the first occurrence of a gendered division of labor to the earliest groups of hunter‐gatherers, believing such a division to be biologically determined and hence natural (Nelson 1997, 86).</p>
            <p>For more than forty years, the concept of “man the hunter” served as a powerful paradigm for the successful emergence of Homo sapiens as the dominant species on our planet (for recent critiques of this work, see Bolger 2006; Brumbach and Jarvenpa 2006). While the hunting hypothesis continued to be highly influential in anthropological circles into the 1970s and 1980s and some of its central tenets are still applied today, its obvious gender biases have come under sharp attack from feminist anthropologists and other scholars who are highly skeptical of a theory that “leaves out half of the human species” (Slocum 1975, 38). A particularly strong line of attack was launched in the late 1970s by anthropologist Eleanor Leacock, who challenged the notion that male and female roles became sharply demarcated at an early stage of human evolution and that the gendered division of labor led subsequently to hierarchical relations of power and prestige (Leacock 1978, 1981). According to Leacock, the hunting hypothesis failed to consider the dynamics of social change and neglected the social, historical, and cultural (rather than simply the biological) factors that may have shaped differences in status between males and females. “Instead,” she observed, “the polarization of public male authority and private female influence is taken as a given of the human condition” (Leacock 1978, 248).</p>
            <p>Armed with ample evidence from ethnology, primatology, and social theory, opponents of the hunting hypothesis began in the mid‐1970s to develop alternative models of human origins that granted women more substantial roles in the successful emergence of the hominid line. Among the most influential of these was the often‐cited article by Nancy Tanner and Adrienne Zihlman published in <italic>Signs</italic> (1976), which aimed to establish a central role for women in human evolution by positing gathering, rather than hunting, as the key economic innovation leading to the survival and success of the human species. According to Tanner and Zihlman, the basic unit of kinship in early hominid societies was not the male‐female pair bond but the mother‐infant relationship. Adult females gathered food to share with their offspring and transmitted valuable technical skills and complex information about the environment (604). The long period of dependence by young upon their mothers led to increased levels of maternal investment, which in turn led to greater discrimination by adult females in choosing their mates; sexual selection in human primates, therefore, was based on female rather than male choice (590). This line of reasoning has been further developed in some of Zihlman’s more recent works (1997a, 1997b), in which she stresses the need to develop more flexible models that consider the roles of women, men, and children in reconstructions of early hominid life.</p>
            <p>A fundamental question that still needs to be addressed by archaeologists and anthropologists alike is the way in which the very terms <italic>hunting</italic> and <italic>gathering</italic> are defined. Many ethnographic reports, for example, regard the capture and killing of small game by women and children as gathering rather than hunting activities, with hunting reserved exclusively for larger animals (Crabtree 1991, 384). Alternatively, it has been argued that “hunting should not be defined as simply killing animals, but should encompass all the strategies involved in their pursuit, transport, processing, and storage. When the full range of activities is considered it is arguable that men and women (and children too) worked interdependently at this goal” (Brumbach and Jarvenpa 2006, 506). Studies that polarize male and female roles in early human subsistence—regardless of whether they prioritize hunting, shepherding, and plowing (male roles), or gathering, grinding, and pot making (female roles)—fall prey to the binary divisions that modern gender theorists have concertedly aimed to deconstruct. As archaeologists continue to investigate the social aspects of hunter‐gatherers and early farming communities, it is important that they actively seek to avoid the many simplistic, unmediated assumptions that have distorted our understanding of early human subsistence patterns for more than half a century.</p>

            <title>Gender and the transition to agriculture</title>
            <p>In economic terms, the invention of agriculture and the shift to more sedentary lifestyles represent some of the most significant achievements of prehistory, and the material remains associated with these developments, including the manufacture of specialized stone tools for clearing and farming land during the Neolithic period and the introduction of the plow during the Bronze Age, have been of particular interest to archaeologists concerned with processes of domestication, sedentarization, and socioeconomic growth. In contrast, little attention has been devoted to the impact of gender relations on these developments or to the relationships between gender constructs of hunter‐gatherers and the gendered division of labor among early cultivators and pastoralists.3 Some scholars assume that women must have been involved in the invention and spread of plant cultivation on account of their earlier roles as gatherers, but these views remain largely untested and only serve to extend to later periods the binary models applied to early hunter‐gatherer societies.4</p>
            <p>In one of his best‐known works (<italic>Man Makes Himself</italic>), Childe proposed that women’s roles in food production are likely to have raised their social status (1948, 101). However, he did not distinguish between simple cultivation (i.e., horticulture) and more intensive cultivation involving the use of the plow. Where such a distinction is made, the adoption of the plow is normally associated with a diminution of female status on the grounds that in conditions of intensive agriculture female labor is largely removed from contexts of primary production. Similarly, the emergence of the secondary products revolution, which involved the exploitation of domestic animals for wool, milk, traction, and transport, in the Near East during the fourth millennium BCE (Sherratt 1981, 1983) is widely considered to have lowered female status by further separating male and female labor and restricting women’s work to the domestic sphere. While ethnographic research on women’s roles in modern agricultural economies has tended to support this scenario (e.g., Boserup 1970; Lerner 1986; Ehrenberg 1989, chap. 3), recent archaeological research on gender and subsistence has been critical of the secondary products revolution since it rests on untested assumptions about men’s and women’s roles during the Bronze Age (e.g., Crabtree 2006; Peterson 2006). Emphasis is given instead to the great variability in the actual practices adopted by different communities and regions, differences that are likely to involve flexibility of task allocation, seasonal variations of work patterns, changes in social roles throughout the life cycle, and the sharing of workloads by men, women, and children. Just as it is becoming increasingly untenable to construct an overarching model that can account for the shift from hunting and gathering to farming in economic and environmental terms (Simmons 2007), it is likewise becoming increasingly difficult to accept universalizing models of social organization in the transition to agriculture that polarize male and female labor.</p>

         <title>Bioarchaeological evidence for gender roles</title>
         <p>During the past fifteen years, evidence for the gendered division of labor in early agricultural societies has begun to emerge at a number of prehistoric sites in Syria and the southern Levant, an area that includes present‐day Israel and Jordan, from a very different source than has been considered thus far: the analysis of human skeletal remains. By analyzing these remains for signs of deformity, injury, and asymmetrical morphology, osteologists are sometimes able to isolate structural anomalies that resulted from work activities and occupational stress. When the skeletal material in question can be reliably sexed, it is possible to correlate workloads, and even specific work activities, with adult males, females, and subadults; and if the remains are reliably dated and can be shown to cover a wide chronological span, differential patterns of male and female work activities (for adults as well as juveniles) can be linked hypothetically to changes in the gendered division of labor.</p>
         <p>The first significant research in this area was conducted by Theya Molleson on skeletal material from the site of Abu Hureyra in northern Syria (Molleson 1994, 2000, 2007). The site covers a long chronological span ranging from the Epipaleolithic (ca. 11,500–10,000 before the radiocarbon present [BP]) to the early stages of the ceramic Neolithic period (ca. 7000 BP; Moore, Hillman, and Legge 2000, 126–31, 251–53). Excavations in the 1970s and 1980s yielded the remains of 162 individuals, 102 of which were dated to the Epipaleolithic period (complex hunter‐gatherers) and the early Neolithic period (the earliest farming communities). By considering evidence over a chronological range of several millennia, Molleson has been able to monitor changes in the skeletal record during the transition to agriculture; she has used these results to draw a number of interesting conclusions concerning the gendered division of labor.</p>
         <p>During the Epipaleolithic period, the hunter‐gatherer population of Abu Hureyra adopted a sedentary lifestyle, and the cultivation of wild plants as well as small amounts of domesticated barley have been inferred from paleobotanical remains; during the Neolithic period, farming became the main subsistence strategy. Human remains from both periods show indications of considerable stress to weight‐bearing bones such as the spine, shoulders, hips, and knees, particularly on the bodies of juveniles. Molleson has proposed that subadults were regularly engaged in load carrying and that they probably carried these loads on their heads (2000, 310). More important for gender, however, is the evidence of strain injury detected in a number of instances to the first metatarsals of the foot, an injury that could have caused severe arthritis of the big toe. According to Molleson, this pattern is best explained as the result of a demanding activity such as grinding of grain on querns, many of which were found in the houses excavated at the site. Grinding with a saddle quern is done in a kneeling rather than a squatting position, and metatarsals are affected as the result of excessive pressure applied to the toe joint (fig. 2). Since most of the metatarsals affected in this way belonged to the skeletons of adult females, Molleson was able to attribute processing activities such as the grinding of grain to female domestic labor. Moreover, as the extent of the arthritic damage could have occurred only if women were engaged in this activity regularly, for a number of hours per day, she suggests that women spent a great deal of their time inside the house in food preparation tasks: “Women were tied to the house for several hours every day, while the men would have worked in the field and, in the appropriate season, trapped and processed game” (2000, 324).<fig-group content-type="figgrp" id="fg2" position="float" seq="2">

         <p>Very different results have emerged from a wide‐ranging study of musculoskeletal stress by Jane Peterson (2002), who has analyzed human remains from a number of sites of in the southern Levant ranging in date from ca. 12,500–5,000 BP. A total of 158 skeletons from fourteen sites were examined, covering a greater chronological and geographical range than Molleson’s study. Peterson’s goal was to examine the human remains for evidence of musculoskeletal stress in order to uncover patterns of male and female labor in the transition from hunting and gathering to farming. While her finds are not unproblematic (see, e.g., Wright 2005), they are very different from Molleson’s, particularly in the absence of arthritic deformities, which are present on the Hureyra metatarsals. Peterson’s results suggest that female activity levels were more stable diachronically than those of males, and while there is indication of strenuous workloads among both sexes, males show greater changes from the hunter‐gatherer lifestyle of the early Neolithic period to that of the later Neolithic farmer and from the simple farming lifestyle of the Neolithic period to the plow‐based agriculture characteristic of the Bronze Age. The most sexually dimorphic patterns occur during the Natufian period (ca. 12,500–9,500 BP), which Peterson attributes to intensive hunting activities (such as spear throwing) by males, activities that result in asymmetrical development of arm muscles; in contrast, female skeletons suggest bilateral motions (2002, 143).</p>
         <p>Unlike Molleson, who proposes a continuous and robust division of labor during the Epipaleolithic and Neolithic periods, Peterson sees significant changes in the nature of female and (especially) male labor over time (2006, 550–51). Males and females from Neolithic contexts exhibit greater levels of musculoskeletal stress, and both show high levels of bilateralization, suggesting that many tasks were shared (2002, 145; 2006, 551). The switch among males to a more bilateral pattern suggests to Peterson that hunting activities may have declined at this time. She concludes that there is no strong evidence to support either a female farmer hypothesis for early agricultural production in the region or a significant gendered division of labor (2002, 145). Only in the Early Bronze Age, when there is evidence of a marked decrease in activity levels of males in relation to females, is there sufficient evidence to suggest the emergence of separate roles for males and females. Peterson attributes this to the advent of the secondary products revolution, the use of traction animals, and herding activities by males, all of which involve less energy expenditure (2002, 145).</p>
         <p>Which scenario is more plausible? It is possible that both Molleson and Peterson are correct and that there were considerable differences in task allocation within and between regions, as well as through time. Molleson’s recent study of skeletal material from Çatalhöyuk (in present‐day Turkey), for example, has yielded very different patterns of bone modification that indicate the effects of squatting facets (bone structures that facilitate squatting) but not of divisions of labor (Molleson 2007, 185–89). When all the evidence is taken into consideration, the variable patterns of musculoskeletal stress and the behavioral correlates associated with these patterns reveal the shortcomings of generic models of task allocation among early farming communities of the Near East. It is hoped that forthcoming osteological studies from recently excavated sites in the region can help us to appreciate in greater detail the ways in which gendered relations of production shifted through time and space and varied according to local cultural practices.</p>

         <title>Gender, sedentism, and the built environment</title>
         <p>Architectural evidence from Neolithic sites in the Near East shows increasing distinctions though time between public and private space (Banning and Byrd 1987; Byrd 1994; Banning 1996). According to Brian Byrd and E. B. Banning, the construction of more permanent, segmented buildings during the period known as Pre‐Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB; ca. 9000–8000 BP) was accompanied by increasingly restricted social networks and the development of more formalized mechanisms for social organization. Changes in the built environment include more restricted access to courtyards, the compartmentalization of interior space, elaboration and increased frequency of storage facilities within buildings, increasing concentration of domestic activities in discrete locations, and the introduction of special‐purpose buildings of a nondomestic nature for political decision making, ritual and ceremonial activities, and redistributive storage. With the exception of the nondomestic structures, these changes point to the increasing privatization of domestic production, including everyday activities such as food storage, preparation, cooking, and dining (Wright 2000).</p>
         <p>Research on the domestication of space in early sedentary societies has assessed the impact of the adoption of intensive agriculture and village life on social relations.5 With the growth of sedentism and the domestication of plant and animal resources, economic production became channeled increasingly through the medium of the household, and this in turn had an important impact upon the ways in which individuals and groups interacted with one another and negotiated access to domestic space. However, while in Ian Hodder’s view (1990) the domestication of society resulted from increasingly closer links between sedentism, domestication, and social organization, his conceptual divisions of Neolithic society according to binary categories such as male/female, wild/tame, and inside/outside are overly simplistic. Recent work at Çatalhöyük, in fact, has yielded no conclusive evidence linking women exclusively with the domestic sphere; on the contrary, carbon residues found on the ribs of older adults, presumably contracted in smoke‐filled houses, suggest that men as well as women spent considerable amounts of time indoors (Hodder 2006, 210).</p>
         <p>In an article addressing issues of gender and sedentism during the Pre‐Pottery Neolithic period, Karen Wright (2000) examines the relationships between gender, space, food storage, and food preparation. After considering evidence from a number of different sites in the southern Levant, she discusses the ways in which storage bins, hearths, and other activity areas for processing and cooking food became increasingly privatized over time, and suggests that this evidence may signify increasing restrictions on women’s visibility in relation to the community, with women working in “relatively cloistered settings” during the Late PPNB (2000, 117). While Wright’s interpretation runs the risk of reverting to the sorts of binary divisions of labor critiqued in previous sections of this article (see also Peterson 2006, 551), it demonstrates the importance of cooking and dining in “structuring daily social intercourse and reinforcing cultural values” (Wright 2000, 89). In order to better appreciate the processes by which this came about, there is a need for archaeologists to investigate the social correlates of changes in the built environment and to more clearly define the Neolithic house or household as a social and economic unit, a point raised recently by Ian Kuijt and Nigel Goring‐Morris (2002, 430). Further research is needed on the relations between gender, food, and the built environment during the Neolithic period; at present one can only agree with Wright’s conclusion that “after a century of research on agricultural origins we still know very little about many social and cultural aspects of early food production” (2000, 117).</p>

         <title>Gender identities and ritual behavior at the dawn of agriculture</title>
         <p>An increasing awareness of the importance of ritual and ideology among early farming communities of the Near East can be observed in a number of recent studies that attempt to account for the occurrence during the Pre‐Pottery Neolithic period of unprecedented mortuary practices involving special treatment of the skull, the emergence of the earliest ritual structures and public buildings, and the production of a wide range of anthropomorphic and zoomorphic art.6 Some of this work has been linked to presumed male and female identities, such as the association of women with figurines and fertility cults and links between males and wild animal imagery, but there has so far been little attempt to move beyond standard male/female dichotomies to more nuanced gender‐based analyses. Here I wish to review three major areas of current research on social aspects of the Neolithic period for which there is considerable scope for gendered perspectives. These are studies of mortuary practices involving special treatments of the dead, new approaches to figurative art linking concepts of performance and symbolism with the construction of social identities, and investigations of the ways in which ritual serves as a vehicle for maintaining collective identities and egalitarian lifestyles.</p>

            <title>Treatments of the dead</title>
            <p>The function of mortuary ritual in promoting social cohesion and group identity has been the subject of several recent publications by Kuijt that focus on mortuary practices during the Pre‐Pottery Neolithic period (2000a, 2000b, 2000c). Kuijt argues that the adoption of new mortuary programs involving secondary burials, skull caching, and the caching of animal bones and anthropomorphic figures, practices recorded at a number of sites, helped to establish and maintain collective identities. By the same token, some of these practices, such as head shaping, skull plastering and painting, cranial removal, and cranial caching, seem to have been applied selectively to individuals and groups rather than to entire communities. This is important for charting the emergence of social inequality, with the earliest systematic evidence dating to the middle of the PPNB (ca. 8500 BP). This trend increases during the Late PPNB, a period that ends with a widespread abandonment of sites that Kuijt and others cite as a prime example of the processes of social fissioning and population dispersal. To date, however, very little has been said of the impact of these developments on gender constructs (important exceptions are Asouti 2006; Hodder 2006; Croucher 2008). And while recent excavations at a number of sites in the Near East are providing carefully recorded evidence for mortuary practices and sexing of skeletal material, archaeological research programs to date have not made gender a central focal point of interpretation (Bolger 2008b).</p>
            <p>A common feature of mortuary ritual during the Neolithic period was the burial of individuals underneath the floors of buildings, a practice that suggests the importance of social memory and ancestors for the construction of social identities (Akkermans and Schwartz 2003, 83). It is therefore likely that the burial of females inside houses signifies women’s close links to ancestors rather than reflecting women’s roles within the domestic sphere (Molleson 1994, 65). At Çatalhöyük, for example, the discovery of the remains of males and females in various buildings (including decapitated male skeletons and detached female skulls) suggests to Hodder that ancestry could be claimed equally through maternal and paternal lines, and the analysis of burial evidence has thus far failed to reveal any significant gender differences in the treatment of the dead, at least in lower levels of the site (Hodder 2006, 209–11); analysis of material from upper levels is still in progress.</p>
            <p>Another locality where gender distinctions in mortuary contexts appear to have little bearing on the construction of social identities is the Late Neolithic site of Domuztepe in southeastern Anatolia (6500–5500 BCE). Here, the excavation of a large mortuary facility known as the death pit uncovered the remains of over forty individuals whose bodies had been disarticulated and fragmented before being deposited into the pit along with remains of numerous animals (Kansa and Campbell 2004). Study of this material is still in progress, but as yet no clear gendered patterns have emerged. Individuals of both sexes and various ages were among the dead, and no significant differences have been observed in the positioning or distribution of male and female remains. Therefore, it appears that in some regions and periods of the Near East gender was not a decisive element in the selection and deposition of the dead (Croucher 2008). Research programs need to focus more explicitly on issues of sex and gender, however, in order to appreciate more fully the ways in which gender constructs in mortuary contexts varied through time and space.</p>
            <p>While there has been little research conducted to date on gender and mortuary ritual in early farming communities of the Near East, it is important to realize its potential. Not only does the study of mortuary evidence shed light on the beliefs and customs regarding death, as well as on the identities, statuses, and physical traits of individuals, but it reveals the ways in which early agricultural communities defined and negotiated gender. The careful study of mortuary structures, funerary rituals, skeletal remains, and associated burial goods can also help us to discover underlying patterns of social and political relationships between and within particular gender groups. Furthermore, by linking changes in mortuary practices to advances in social complexity it is possible to identify the variable means by which gendered identities were transformed through time in various regions and subregions.</p>

            <title>Gendered images: Ritual, symbol, and identity</title>
            <p>Ideological aspects of early farming communities of the Near East, including symbolic and ritual behavior, were first addressed by Jacques Cauvin (1978) more than thirty years ago and have been the subjects of more systematic study in recent years.7 A renewed interest in symbolic aspects of Neolithic society can be attributed in part to the considerable number of new excavations during the past ten to fifteen years (including ʿAin Ghazal, Çatalhöyük, Çayonu, Göbekli Tepe, Jerf el Ahmar, Kfar HaHoresh, and Nevali Çori), which have yielded a wealth of evidence ranging from small‐scale images (figurines, figures, plastered and painted skulls, and the like) in domestic contexts to larger‐scale depictions of animals and humans painted on the walls and floors of buildings and relief sculpture on monumental plinths associated with special, nondomestic buildings.</p>
            <p>While much of this evidence is truly remarkable and has allowed archaeologists to address some of the cognitive aspects of early farming societies in much greater detail than has previously been possible, considerations of the roles of males and females in the analysis of the evidence have generally been limited to the standard binary models that dominate other areas of archaeological research. In a recent article on symbolism in Neolithic art, for example, Marc Verhoeven makes the interesting observation that a common set of symbols tends to occur in domestic and public buildings (2002a, 247); however, he does not appear to recognize the importance of this overlap for a critique of traditional gender narratives that sharply separate public and private spheres of engagement. Instead, he reverts to a traditional polarized model of gender, as is evident in his speculation concerning the links between images of males and wild animals at a number of Pre‐Pottery Neolithic sites: “Could it be then that PPNB human–animal linkages were an expression of the wild, dangerous aggressive dimensions of the domain of nature, where it was the men who hunted, as opposed to the domestic and more peaceful domain of culture, where women were symbolized as giving life and bringing fecundity”? (Verhoeven 2002a, 252). Those who would hope for a more nuanced analysis of gender roles can at least be thankful that this hypothesis has been phrased as a question rather than an assertion.</p>
            <p>A similar interpretation has been adopted by Klaus Schmidt for the spectacular carvings on large stone pillars at the Pre‐Pottery Neolithic site of Göbekli Tepe in southeastern Turkey (Schmidt 2006). Animal imagery dominates this sculpture, and all of the animals depicted on the pillars appear to be wild species (including foxes, wild boars, snakes, lions, gazelles, and onagers). Representations of humans are rare, but where sex is identifiable it appears to be predominantly male, such as the forty‐centimeter‐high sculpture of a male with an erect penis (fig. 3). An important exception to this rule, however, is the incised image of a naked female on a stone bench in the Building of the Lion Stele (fig. 4). It is the only depiction of a female discovered at the site. She is shown in a squatting posture, with breasts hanging down her sides; the labia, which are depicted frontally between her buttocks, have larger than normal proportions. The head is more difficult to interpret, depicting either an elaborate hairstyle or the head of an animal. In order to account for the rare presence of female imagery, and to sustain his overall interpretation of the site within the framework of masculinity as wild and powerful, Schmidt argues that the incised image does not belong to the original construction of the building but was added at a later date as a kind of graffiti (2006, 237). While it is true that the image is not executed in the relief style characteristic of the other images at the site and that incised decoration occurs only very rarely at contemporary sites in the region, there is no stratigraphic or other contextual evidence to indicate a lack of contemporaneity between the female image and the rest of the building. Schmidt’s hypothesis of a post‐Neolithic date for this figure appears to convey his reluctance to accommodate the image of a female in what is assumed to be a male‐dominated world. Once again, the assumption of separate roles for males and females has been instrumental in the interpretation of Neolithic culture.<fig-group content-type="figgrp" id="fg3" position="float" seq="3">

            <p>Another domain in which traditional narratives of gender continue to play an important role in archaeological interpretation is that of figurative art. Numerous examples of anthropomorphic figurines (male, female, ambiguous, and dual‐sexed examples) have been found at many prehistoric sites in the Near East, and while it lies beyond the scope of this essay to provide a critique of the various interpretations that have been applied to this large corpus of material, one cannot help but agree with Peter M. M. G. Akkermans and Glenn M. Schwartz that “archaeological explanations have generally not transcended simple notions of fertility or mother goddesses” (2003, 83). An increasing number of exceptions to that rule have emerged in recent years, however, that emphasize the dynamic nature of this evidence and adopt interpretative models that explicitly address issues of gender and identity.8</p>
            <p>Of particular relevance for connections between gender and ritual in the Neolithic is Yosef Garfinkel’s (2003) study of dancing figures depicted on representational art of the eighth to fourth millennia BCE. These appear as plastic and incised images, engravings, and painted plaster walls and floors at a number of sites in the Levant, northern Mesopotamia, Anatolia, and Cyprus (e.g., fig. 5). The figures depicted in these images are engaged in ritual performances, perhaps associated with feasting. Garfinkel has calculated that more than 50 percent of the figures in his study had no indications of gender and that images of male and female figures dancing together were relatively rare. At the same time, he acknowledges a considerable degree of geographical and temporal variation for this imagery, noting, for example, that female figures are generally more prolific in the earliest depictions but decrease in later periods; in contrast, representations of males are uncommon at first but gradually increase over time. This suggests a central role for females in dancing activities and ritual performances during the early phases of agriculture and a less prominent role in later phases. Further research on this subject, including a more rigorous contextual analysis of dancing motifs, could greatly enhance our understanding of the performance of gender in ritual and public life.<fig-group content-type="figgrp" id="fg5" position="float" seq="5">

            <p>A final point to note with regard to gender and ritual is the special, symbolic role of food and plants. According to Christine A. Hastorf (1998), the domestication of plants may have been linked to the intensification of social relations and lineage construction. She believes that the earliest domesticated plants are likely to have had “special meanings and identities due to their associations with places, events and lineage groups, especially for women” and that “women and their lineage associations were important instigators in the spread of plants and were probably involved in their domestication” (1998, 773). This interesting line of inquiry is supported archaeologically by the recent discovery in upper levels of the south area at Çatalhöyük of a figurine with a seed deliberately inserted into its back (Hodder 2006, 204, fig. 90) and by James Mellaart’s discovery in a grain bin of the now well‐known clay figure of a female on a seat of felines (fig. 6; see also Mellaart 1965, 92). The connections between women, ritual, and agriculture make for a fascinating subject for gender studies, and one that deserves to be explored in greater depth.<fig-group content-type="figgrp" id="fg6" position="float" seq="6">

            <title>The egalitarian basis of neolithic society</title>
            <p>Studies on the archaeology of social inequality have drawn important distinctions between loosely defined inequalities associated with prestate communities and the more formal, institutionalized inequalities of the organized state (e.g., Bender 1990; Price and Feinman 1995). While archaeological investigations of early farming villages in the ancient Near East have detected only limited degrees of social hierarchy, they have sought to identify and explain the various processes that led over the course of several millennia to less egalitarian social forms. Importance has increasingly been attached to the role of internal social forces, such as ritual behavior and ideology, as important vehicles for social change, and to the role of individuals and groups as active agents. Particular emphasis has been given to the ways in which social phenomena such as mortuary and other ritual practices promote a collective ethos that helps to preserve and maintain traditional social structures (Kuijt 2000c; Akkermans and Schwartz 2003, chap. 3). For example, in the Late Neolithic period of Syria, when there is evidence for increasing cultural diversity, there is little or no indication of social stratification or centralized authority; it has been suggested that social mechanisms such as fissioning and mobility may have been adopted deliberately to preserve traditional lifestyles (Akkermans and Schwartz 2003, 150–51). Similar arguments have been proposed about the development of early sedentary societies in Cyprus, where settlement shift and nucleation are regarded as important means by which early farming communities maintained an egalitarian social base (Peltenburg 1993).</p>
            <p>It is therefore within a noninstitutionalized, flexible, and relatively egalitarian framework that male and female roles in early agricultural societies of the Near East ought to be assessed. The notion of a gendered division of labor, particularly when linked to a disparate ranking of male/female status and prestige, seems increasingly untenable and should not be assumed, particularly when there is no compelling evidence for other types of social divisions or inequalities. Hodder’s recent summary of gender and social organization at Çatalhöyük, for example, notes the lack of evidence for gender differences in burial and settlement contexts (2006). This indicates that when gender roles are investigated rather than assumed, the result is very likely to contradict simple, binary models. There is clearly a need for further research on gender and social relations in the archaeology of early farming communities in order to better understand the processes by which social differentiation and specialized gender roles emerged and developed through time, and to gauge the impact of less egalitarian social forms upon male and female status.</p>
            <p>Brian Hayden (1990, 1995) has identified some of the possible social mechanisms involved in the transition from hunting and gathering to farming by considering the links between subsistence strategies, competitive feasting, and aggrandizing behavior. In his view, economic rivalry was “the driving force behind food production,” a rivalry that resulted in the end of egalitarian social organization and the emergence of new cultural traits such as social hierarchy, slavery, and warfare (Hayden 1990, 32–33). While Hayden’s ideas are important for addressing the mechanics of economic change in social terms, they fail to treat the concept of egalitarianism in a nuanced manner, adopting instead the kind of simple, rigid dichotomy (equality/inequality) criticized by T. Douglas Price and Gary M. Feinman (1995, introduction). More relevant for the present discussion, however, is Hayden’s failure to identify the sex or gender of his proposed aggrandizers, effectively situating his model within conventional paradigms that link competitive behavior and economic success with male dominance.</p>
            <p>Hayden is not alone in his inadvertent adoption of essentialist models for the transition to agriculture in the Near East, and similar criticisms can be applied to many hypothetical explanations for the rise of social complexity in the region. The notion that big events and big men functioned as prime movers in prehistory, when combined with a genderless perspective on the past, creates a theoretical vacuum that opens the door for uncritical views about gender roles, such as the association of women with private domestic spheres and men with the more cosmopolitan spheres of trade, politics, and public life (Gero 2000; Bolger 2003, chap. 1). While this is probably not the result that Hayden intended, we are left with a polarized view of the past in which men appear to have played prominent roles in the transition to agriculture whereas women contributed only marginally. Agent‐based models such as Hayden’s are important for placing people at the center of social change, but until they begin to adopt more explicitly gendered perspectives they will continue to people the prehistoric stage with the “genderless, faceless blobs” so aptly characterized by Ruth Tringham (1991, 97).</p>

         <title>Beyond binary divisions: The future of the past</title>
         <p>This article has focused on some of the unmediated assumptions about gender that continue to characterize much of the research on early farming societies of the Near East. As has long been recognized by gender researchers in archaeology and history (e.g., Conkey and Spector 1984; Scott 1986; Bertelsen, Lillehammer, and Næss 1987), these assumptions have resulted in large part from presentist interpretations in which the binary gender constructs of modern Western society are projected onto communities of the remote past. Consequently, scholars essentialize and reify gender roles and relations by providing the binary paradigm with a scholarly and timeless pedigree. As Rosemary Joyce observes, such a static view fails to fulfill the potential of archaeological investigation to construct a past in which “inequality on the basis of sex was not inevitable, and thus is not a natural and unavoidable feature of contemporary life” (Joyce 2008, 130). In order to extricate ourselves from the tautological cul‐de‐sac in which the past is used to legitimize the present and the present is used as the basis for interpreting the past, archaeologists need to abandon universalizing approaches and begin to interpret the past from the perspective of difference.</p>
         <p>Current approaches in the anthropology and archaeology of gender emphasize the wide variability of life experiences, not only between men and women but among women and men of different ranks, classes, ages, and ethnicities (Moore 1994; Gilchrist 1999, chap. 1). Other fundamental differences can be measured through the dynamics of time and space. While concern with particular sites, regions, phases, and periods is fundamental to archaeological analysis, exclusive focus on short‐ or medium‐range scales fails to take advantage of longer‐term developments that are essential for formulating theories of social change on a broader scale. By the same token, it is important to consider the dynamics of the human life cycle in which gendered experience can be shown to occur not only over long stretches of time but within the relatively brief temporal spans of the human life course (Conkey 2003; Gilchrist 2004; Bolger 2008b). The biological and cultural transitions from cradle to grave vary considerably, both spatially and temporally, and these small‐scale differences need to be integrated into our overall understanding of gender in early agricultural societies of the Near East.</p>
         <p>Archaeological inquiry has the capacity to undermine essentialist assumptions about gender by challenging universal theories of cultural change based on monolithic categories such as the state, the prestate, and women and men, and by focusing on differential patterns of gender relations and gender identities through time and space; however, links between gender constructs and other aspects of socioeconomic development must be demonstrated rather than assumed. In contrast to unilinearevolutionary models in which social trajectories emerge gradually from one century to the next, contextual models are nonlinear and recursive, thereby addressing the complexity, diversity, and idiosyncracy of human behavior. Because of its focus on context, archaeology has the potential to overcome and replace evolutionary and essentialist models of gender (Joyce 2008). Methodologically, this can best be achieved through detailed considerations of gender roles and relations at particular localities and among specific communities rather than across broad regions and large populations (Asouti 2006; Croucher 2008; Joyce 2008, 130). By looking at gender and other aspects of social identity from the bottom up rather than from the top down, archaeologists can begin to construct new models of social interpretation based on the multitude of spatial and temporal variations in the archaeological record.</p>
         <p>On a more theoretical level, the ability of archaeologists to move beyond binary interpretations of gender in early agricultural societies depends upon a willingness to shift the focus of their analysis from environmental to social concerns; while this does not necessitate the abandonment of the processual, or structural, models that have dominated this area of research until very recently, it does require acknowledgement and integration of postprocessual approaches in which social factors such as gender, agency, and identity are given a more central role (Wylie 1991; Brumfiel 1992). A key factor in this shift is the concept of multivocality (Conkey 2003; Engelstad 2007, 230; Bolger 2008a, 352–55). Given the increasing complexity of archaeological research, which now embraces a wide range of specialist disciplines, it is no longer possible for the past to be narrated by a single voice. Moreover, current debates about ownership of the past (discussed in Silberman 2003) challenge archaeologists to question traditional structures and methods of fieldwork in which the director of a field project (traditionally a white European or American middle‐aged male holding a prominent position at a university or other scholarly institution) serves as the sole voice and authority for the interpretation of excavated remains. While traditional structures of the discipline are beginning to change, the attainment of gender parity in the archaeological workplace still has a long way to go, particularly among archaeologists working in the Near East (for a detailed assessment, see Bolger 2008a). Given the close links between gender inequities in modern society and the marginalization of gender as a tool for interpreting the past, it is unlikely that gender will become a central analytical component in Near Eastern archaeology until we come closer to achieving parity between males and females within the infrastructures of the field itself (Matthews 2003, 190; Bolger 2008a, 355).</p>
         <p>While the slow pace of integrating gender into Near Eastern archaeology, both in the past and in the present, furnishes ample cause for pessimism, there is also some evidence that the situation is beginning to change; this is suggested by a growing tendency among archaeologists to address issues of agency, identity, and socioeconomic complexity in discussions of early societies of the Near East, as well as by a number of recent publications that are specifically concerned with gender (cited in Bolger 2008b). As Roberta Gilchrist has observed, the best research about gender in archaeology involves the use of multiple lines of evidence (1999, 53). Moreover, by approaching the evidence from a variety of perspectives, and by employing a range of temporal and spatial scales, it is possible to challenge traditional assumptions concerning the gendered division of labor that can no longer be sustained by detailed contextual evidence and specialist research.</p>
         <p>The ongoing program of excavation and research at Çatalhöyük provides a positive example of the ways in which multiple strands of evidence can be combined to build more nuanced interpretations of gender in discussions of early agricultural societies in the Near East. Within a larger social framework, gender constructs are closely linked to issues of individuality, agency, temporality, and sedentism, and are dynamic rather than static (Hodder 2006, 257). Hodder correctly places changes in social interaction at the heart of the momentous developments accompanying the origins and growth of farming societies in the Near East, and the detailed evidence that continues to emerge from excavation and postexcavation analysis illustrates the gendered aspects of these entanglements particularly well. After fifteen years of excavation and research, Hodder and his colleagues have begun to demonstrate that the egalitarian traditions of Neolithic society at Çatalhöyük persisted over a considerable period of time and that social equality extended to male‐female relations (Hodder 2006, chap. 9). This suggests that binary models that sharply separate male and female roles and posit a gendered division of labor among the earliest sedentary societies in the region have at the very least been overstated. Of course, it remains to be seen whether the egalitarian pattern that characterizes the lower levels at Çatalhöyük continued into later periods and whether those patterns recur at other places and periods of Near Eastern prehistory. As knowledge of early farming communities in the region continues to expand and methods of recording and analysis become more sophisticated, it is essential that archaeologists move forward on the theoretical front as well by incorporating current theoretical work on gender, agency, and social identity into their interpretations. As a start, we need to abandon once and for all the stereotypical, polarized conceptions of male and female behavior that have been so firmly embedded in our discipline.</p>
