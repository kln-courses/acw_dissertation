<plain_text><page sequence="1">Foreword Volume seven of Cleveland Studies in the History of Art honors the editorship of Henry Hawley, curator of baroque and later decorative arts and sculpture and executive editor of this journal, who retired at the end of 2 o02 after forty-two years of service to the Cleveland Museum of Art. The next issue of Cleveland Studies will be devoted to decorative arts to celebrate his exemplary career. The five articles in this volume discuss works of art from three conti nents over a span of almost six hundred years. While the history of the museum's Gothic table fountain, a three-tiered assembly of individual sections of gilt-silver, is uncertain, Stephen Fliegel, associate curator of medieval art at the Cleveland Museum of Art, demonstrates its purpose by cataloguing other medieval automata. In a welcome article about textiles, Joanne Pillsbury, Dumbarton Oaks Professor of Pre-Columbian Studies at the University of Maryland and Dumbarton Oaks, provides a context for two Inka-style colonial tunics, speaking to the tenacity and complexity of indigenous textile traditions in colonial-period Peru. Through a review of miniatures by Gerard David, Diane Scillia, associate professor of art history at Kent State University, defines the artist's work ing methods and compositional devices to show that every element in the St. Elizabeth of Hungary folio from the Hours of Queen Isabella the Catholic has a parallel in one of the artist's paintings of c. 1495?1505. Patrick Shaw Cable, assistant curator of drawings at the CMA, examines five drawings by four artists?Eug?ne Delacroix, Auguste Raffet, Eug?ne Fromentin, and Alexandre Bida?each of whom created important works in the Orientalist genre. Executed in a variety of media, these works date from the 1830s to the 1870s, a period that was particularly rich for French Orientalism. Finally, Constantine Petridis, associate curator of African art at the CMA and assistant professor of art history at Case Western Reserve University, argues that a mother-and-child figure has been incorrectly attributed to the Mbala people of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and should instead be given to their neighbors, the Kwilu Pende people. He adroitly places the wood sculpture among the anthropomorphic roof top figures of Kwilu Pende ritual houses. Cleveland Studies is primarily intended to foster research on works in the museum's collection, but articles treating relevant subjects as well as important original research presented as lectures or symposia at the museum are also considered. We invite our colleagues in the international scholarly community to contribute to future issues of the journal. Katharine Lee Reid, Director The Cleveland Museum of Art 5</page></plain_text>
