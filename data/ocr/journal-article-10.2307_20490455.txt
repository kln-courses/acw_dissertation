By V, :BALL, C03., LL.D., F.R.S., Director of the Science and Art Museum, Dublin. [Read JANuARY 23, 1893.] T:nE selection of a suitable title for this Paper has been a matter of some difficulty, it being desired to convey by it that the object in view is to describe the influence upon the inhabitants of India of certain sele9ted classes of physical phenomena. The subject is there fore connected with those which I have previously discussed either in this Academy or elsewhere, with reference to some characteristics of' the animals, plants, and minerals of India, as they are regarded from the natives' point of view, and as a-fording the origins from whence sundry myths and traditions have sprung. As will be seen in the following account, the phenomena here described have exer cised a considerable effect on the habits, customs, and religious beliefs, of those who live in the regions where they are manifested. In all cases, both with regard to the subjects previously treated of, and those which are discussed im the present Paper, sufficient scientific descriptions of the objects have been given, to insure precision of identification. Mfany interpreters of myths, with a sub lime indifference to the laws of geogaphical distribution, have searched the world over in order to provide themselves with means for explaining the myths they have sought to investigate. :But a more satisfactory method appears to be to describe, where possible, a phy sical :phenomenon, a zoological or a botanical species; then to mention the views of the inhabitants on the spot where it occurs, and so pass, to the consideration of how those views may be connected with, or have given rise to, a particular myth or tradition. What is aimed at principally in the present communication is to give a systematic account of a certain group of Indian myths and traditions, which may afford material for- comparisons hereafter with the myths a traditions of</page><page sequence="2">152 Proceeding.s of the Royal Irish Academy. other countries in connection with similar natural phenomena; and also to suggest to residents in India a line of inquiry which has perhaps hitherto not received the attention it deserves. The collection of such native opinions is not quite so easy as might be supposed, because the majority of scientific writers rather avoid reference to them, while the descriptions of non-scientific authors, when dealing with them, often lack the precision which would justify specific identification of the objects with which they maybe connected. However, there are exceptions among both classes, and the stories previously recorded, in addition to my own observations, have enabled me to bring together a considerable number of these myths and their explanations. I am tempted to add here in illustration of what has just been said, as to non-scientific observations, that I remember hearing a well-known traveller inveighing at a meeting of the British Association against our system of education, which allowed travellers like himself to go forth unprovided with the means of explaining the phenomena they encountered, and by way of example he mentioned several. subjects, not in themselves really difficult of explanation, which had puzzled him, but regarding which he could only give the native accounts without any attempt at rational elucidation. VOLCANOES. Although peninsular India affords evidence of vast volcanic activity in long past geological times, there is no trace in it at present, from and including the Himalayas to Cape Comorin, of any volcanic centre which has been in active operation since early tertiary or late cretaceous times. For more recent manifestations we must pass from the peninsula to the Islands of the Bay of Bengal, and to the regions on the mainland, further eastwards, within the limits of Burmah. But before passing to these more recent sites, we may well pause to say a few words in reference to the phenomena in connection with the earlier activity to which reference has just been made. Through out an area of some 200,000 square miles, in Western India and the Central Provinces, together with a not inconsiderable outlying tract of strata of possibly somewhat earlier age, in Bengal, namely, the Raj mahal Hills, the prevailing rocks are wide-spread flows of basalt, which extend with marvellous uniformity in thickness over wide areas. In some localities this Deccan trap, as it is commonly called, flowed over beds which had been deposited on the surface of previous flows, during their submergence under lakes or the sea; and, as a result, we</page><page sequence="3">BALL-On the Volcanoes and Hot Springs of India. 153 find that some of the sedimentary beds which often contain remains of plants and animals (thus affording evidence of the age to which they belong) have been baked by the superincumbent heated mass of basalt, and have consequently received such names as porcellanic shales and the like. Throughout these vast areas diligent research has resulted in the discovery of no definite evidences of the former existence of any voleanic cores or craters from whence these vast masses of trap can have been poured forth. Nearer at home in the north of Ireland, and in the west of Scotland, we meet with some what similar conditions, and, inferentially, it may be suggested that wide-spread flows of trap will also be found to occur, or to have formerly existed in the Soudan and other parts of Africa; for, from thence have been brought silicious pebbles similar in character with those which are found in the other above-named regions. India has long been renowned for the agates and carnelians, &amp;c., which are produced in the trap areas; they have, when cut, been articles of trade from the earliest times, the artificers having learnt how, by a process of heating them in specially constructed ovens, to purify and develop the beautiful combinations of colours which so far back as the time of the Romans rendered the Murrhine vases famous and almost priceless. Among traces of what has by some writers been supposed to have been a volcanic centre is the Lonar Lake, a vast hollow in the trap in Buldana jDistrict, Berar. But in the opinion of those most competent to judge it was more probably formed by an explosion which took place lo4g after the flows of basalt had been poured forth. Indeed it affords #n example comparable in its form and general characters to the pipes and crater-like hollows which have proved so prolific a souree of diamonds in South Africa, the probable origin of which has, I think, been very satisfactorily explained by Daubree's recent experimental researches.' The peculiar appearance of this Lonar Lake (of which I exhibit an illustration) has given rise to much speculative imagination on the part of the natives who, while regarding it as a sacred spot, also take advantage of the benefits derivable from it as a source of certain salts of some commercial value. The principal salt is the sodium carbonate, which indeed is the most abundant salt in the trap regions 1 Application de la Methode Experimentale au role possible des gaz souterraines dans l'Histoire des Montagnes Volcaniques.

It is collected when, by evaporation and drought in the hot season, the level of the water falls.1 As iS elsewhere the case, the true source of these basalt flows appears to be quite independent of volcanic action in the ordinary sense of the term. The material apparently flowed from reservoirs deep-seated in the crust of the earth through long cracks or fissures, and without the accompaniment of ordinary volcanic phenomena. Some of the layers of basalt, partly perhaps in consequence of their constituents but chiefly because they cooled down more slowly than others, have assumed what is commonly known as a basaltic structure, and scenes may be visited in several parts of India where the basatic columns are almost as strikingly developed as they are at the Giaht's Causeway and the Island of Staffa. In such localities the natives have not failed to take advantage of the mystery attaching to the caves naturally formed among these pillars, and have made them the subjects of myth and the objects of pilgrimage. Many such sites have I seen in the Rajmahal Hills, and in some of them I have been invited by the guardian priests to remove my shoes when entering the holy ground. Whenever in such caves there happens to be a natural drip of water, every drop is invested with mystical and curative properties if admi nistered to pilgrims through the intervention of the Brahmins. Besides these nature-wrought temples there are those which by means of incredible toil and labour have been excavated by past gene rations of men about 1000 years ago. Such are the temples of Elephanta, on an island near Bombay, and those at Ellora, in Haidarabad, Deccan, which extends for a mile and a quarter along the hillsides. These have been carved out of the solid basalt by the hand of man (Buddhist, Brahminical, and lain), as well as the figures and decoration on the walls, and the supporting columns of the roofs. Well may the pre sent generation ascribe them to the anthropomorphic deities of former times; to them it seems incomprehensible that ordinary humanity could have accomplished such extensive and laborious tasks. We now know a good deal about these temples, and one of the principal at Ellora, that called Xailas, a perfect Dravidian temple, measures inside 247 feet by 150 feet, and is in some places 100 feet high. It is highly sculptured, both inside and out, the solid rock having been cut away, both internally and externally, so as to isolate it from the hill. It was executed in the 8th century, A.D. 1 Ayin Akbari, Gladwin, vol. ii., 1800, p. 59. * Economic Geology of India, p. 493. 3 Ferguson's History of Indian and Eastern Architecture, p. 334.</page><page sequence="5">BALL- On the Volcaioes and IHot Sp)rings of India. 155 Passing now to more recent scenes of volcanic activity, there are two islands, and possibly a submerged third, which claim attention as being of purely volcanic origin, one of them, moreover, having been in a condition of violent eruption within historical times. Of these I have published descriptions already,' and subsequently they were exhauLstively surveyed and described by Mr. F. R. Mallet and Captain Hobday.2 lIere it is only necessary to make a very short reference to them. The more northern of them is now called Narcondam; it is situated in lat. 130 26', long. 940 15', is 2330 feet high, and 2- miles in diameter. It consists mainly of a mass of hornblendic andesite, and there being no signs of a crater or of any alternations of lava and ash, it has been suggested by Mr. Mallet that it owes its origin to the "c extrusion of viscid lava without the accompaniment of crater-forming materials,?" thus resembling in its origin the " domite " of the Puys of Auvergue. Colonel Yule has suggested that the name may have been derived from two Sanskrit words, Naraka kondam, signifying a pit of hell, a not very appropriate title under the circumstances, because there is no crater and no historical record of any volcanic eruption having ever been observed in connection with the island; but passing to the other volcano, which is now called Barren Island, we there find, in lat. 120 15', long. 93? 50' a perfect crater with central cone, rising respec tively to 1100 and 1000 feet, and of this volcano, which is now quiescent, we have abundant evidence that towards the close of the last century and beginning of this, i.e. from 1789 to 1804, it was in an active state of eruption. Mr. Mallet, however, in searching old charts of the bay of Bengal came to the conclusion that the name of: Narcondam may originally have been applied to it before it received its English title of Barren Island, and hence we can see reason for accepting the title "A pit of hell " as having possibly been conferred by native navigators to this basin-like crater from the centre of which the usuial volcanic pheno mena were at the time being manifested. (1 exhibit a photograph which shows how appropriate such a name would have been for 33trrei Island.) On the same line of volcanic activity, further south, there is a reef which may possibly indicate the position of a third volcano. 1 Geological Magazine, yol. vi., 1879, pp. 16-27, and I&amp;, Decade III., vol. v,, 1888, .No. 9, p. 404; and recently Id.} Decade III., vol. x., 1893, No. 349, p. 289, with Plate. 3 Mem. Geol. Suit, of India, vol. xxi., part 4. 112</page><page sequence="6">156 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. It is also recorded that a violent eruption took place in the year 1757 in the sea three leagues distant from Pondicherry. An island formed by it disappeared soon afterwards, having been eroded by the sea,1 as was the case with Graham's Island in the Mediterranean Sea in 1831. A passing reference may be made here to the volcanic phenomena found in Burmah, and to the curious so-called mud volcanoes which are however unconnected with true volcanic action, being more closely related to those which cause hot springs. At Puppa Doung, about fifty miles N.N.E. of Ye-nan-Xhyoung, and thirty miles E.S.E. of Pagan on the Irawadi there is a volcanic crater believed to be of Pliocene age which rises about 3000 feet above the surface. It has long been extinct, as is testified by the vege ation. The crater consists of a breccia of ash, and towards the bas9 there are flows of trachytic lava. the place is regarded by the Burmese as the home of Nat8 or evil spirits, and probably there are traditions and myths connected with it,. though I have not yet succeeded in meeting with any record of them.' The principal mud volcanoes are at Membu on the Irawadi, and on the islands of Ramri and Cheduba on the Arakan coast. Those of Ramri, of which there are about a dozen, are subject to violent erup tions and eject stones and flames. They consist of cones formed of mud which has been ejected by the pressure of gas. The craters at the summits contain mud in a viscid condition. The gas is the ordinary marsh gas (carburetted hydrogen); with it petroleum and saline waters are also ejected, but there is nothing indicating volcanic action, and the ignition of the gas is attributed to electricity induced by friction of the gas and water through the vents. The mud cones exist where the local strata consist of soft tertiary shales which are softened by the action of the gas and water. The gas and petroleum are believed to be derived from the fossil plants and animals in the tertiary rocks in which these mud volcanoes are alone found. As regards the natives' opinions of these phenomena, and the myths connected with them, the records are unfortunately incomplete' -they deserve special inquiry. 1 Asiatic Annual Register, vol. i., 1758, and Jour.

In some parts of the Central Provinces and Western Bengal which I have explored, I was prepared by the writ ings of previous travellers to hear stories of certain peaks from which smoke, and it was generally added flames also, issued. In some cases I saw the so-called smoke rising from the peaks, but it proved to con sist merely of wreaths of misty cloud which, in certain conditions of the atmosphere, clung to the highest points, before disappearing under the influence of the morning sun. I examined these peaks, and in none of them was there the slightest trace of volcanic action. There is before me a somewhat sensational paragraph taken from the Madra8 Mail about a hill in a region I know well, Bhawani Patna, in the Central Provinces, which was said to have emitted loud reports and flashes of fire; this is but an example of au amplified myth founded on native authority, which when embellished with more or less correct references to actual geological phenomena, subsequently obtained a wide cifeulation through the press. Fire, in whatever form it may appear, is an object that arouses the native imagination. It is commonly said that the fires which occur in the jungle in the hot seasons in India, as in the prairies of America, are the result of spontaneous ignition. Although well acquainted with a number of methods by -which a spark may be produced by the labo rious rubbing of two sticks together, having investigated the species of wood that are necessary to produce the result, I venture to tihink that, ready as the dried-up herbage may be to ignite, it does not ignite without human agency, either intentional or accidental. I have seen a fire spread for miles by night-time along a range of hills, which I had myself ignited a few hours previously; and certainly in India the intentional setting fire to dried-up herbage in the jungle. is a common practice, as the grass which immediately springs up affords utiuch needed fodder for cattle, while accidental ignition may take place from the cooking-places of wayside travellers. Spontaneous fires, however, are not unknown in India, and whether in connection with exposed coal seams or jets of inflammable glas, they are much resorted to by pilgrims as sites of divine manifestation. Of the former I have seen several, and of the latter cases are recorded in the following pages.</page><page sequence="8">158 Proceedings qf the Royal I? sh Academy. HOT SPRINGS. Hot springs, like most other natural phenomena, provided they are something out of the common, appeal directly to the respect, nay, even arouse the adoration of the people of India. Whether for its area India is more or less largely provided with hot springs than other countries is a question that cannot be answered off-hand; possibly they are relatively more numerous in Japan; but the point is of no very great importance in connection with the present investigation. Within the limits of India itself they are found more frequently in some areas than in others: this, of course, whatever theory of their origin may be adopted, is only what might be expected to be the case. The actual sites where they occur present, however, coinsiderable varieties in their physical surroundings. They exist in the depths of the sea, in the beds of rivers, in low-lying alluvial tracts where no rocks are exposed, in the strata of many different formations, and at elevations varying from the minus altitudes of sites beneath the sea up to those which are 16,000 feet above it. The total nUmber of recorded sites where hot springs occur in India is about 300, and this, probably, approximates to the total of those which actually exist, and for this reason, being, as has been said above, objects of veneration and, consequently, in not a few instances of annual pilgrimage, they have come under the notice of resident officials and surveyors; long, too, before either appeared on the scene, nmany were heard of and recorded by travellers through the regions where they occur; moreover, the native literature of India is by no means devoid of reference to them. The term " site" has been used advisedly above, because the quoted total is not intended to represent the actual number of outlets, or individual springs; these, at particular sites, may amount to 20 or 30, or even more ; and, as was the case in a particular group of springs which came under my own notice, the number of outlets may vary from time to time, new ones bursting forth, and old ones becoming inactive. The native nomenclature of these springs, taken by itself, would be somewhat confusing as a means of identification, because the names of the deities, after whom they are often called, as Sita, Parvati, -Devi, and Maihadeo, frequently recur; as also do such names as Suraj-Isund (Fountain of the Sun), Chand-Kund (Fountain of the Moon). Further, titles like Garmab, 1tttapani, Jerri'apani, Unari, &amp;c., all signify hot</page><page sequence="9">BALL-On the Volcanoes and Hot Springs of Idia, 159 water, and some others, in which the word gandaJk (sulphur) is incor )orated, are also widely employed. Fence a list, to be useful, requires, for purposes of identification, to be drawn up under the names of the villages nearest to the actual sites, which can, however, be further identified, and with more precision, by their latitudes and longitu.des. Such a list was published some years ago by Mr. iR. D. Oldlbam, of the Geological Survey of India.1 Although to but a limited extent dealing with the particular aspect of the case which I delsire to specially present here, his list has been in many ways most useful in the preparation of the following pages; and in several cases the serial nuLmbers used in it are quoted, together with the names of the springs. As a scientific record it supersedes all the previously published lists; but some of them contain material not quoted by Mr. Oldham, which has been employed in this account. Of the majority of these Indian hot springs, the temperature has not been recorcled; this is due principally to the observers not having provided themselves, beforehand, with thermometers suitable for re cording high temperatures. Of recorded temperatures, 1900I. is very nearly the maximum limit, but a few exceed that amount; thus one of a number which I tested at a site called Tatapani, in Sirguja,2 registered 1960F., and the hottest of the springs in the Pa-luk valley, in Mergui, also registers 1960 F.3 The hottest spring mentioned in 3r. Oldham's list is at Manikarn on the Parvati (83), of which the temperature is given as 2020 F.; another authority, Mr. Edgeworth, has recorded it as slightly higher, namely, 2071F3. It is stated that thte inhabitants of this place, where the " boiling-point " of water at the time the 2020 F. temperature was taken was only 2010 85'YF., cook their food in these boiling springs, wood never being used by them for culinary purposes; and at Jamnutri, where the temperature of the spring is 1940F., rice is cooked easily, as, at the elevation of 11,000, water boils at that temperature. I may remark, on passant, that I have been told by travellers at these high latitudes, that their native servants have manifested considerable uneasiness at the lov "boiling-point," thinking there must be something uncanny about it, and asserting, moreover, that their food could not be properly cooked, which was probably true. 1 Mem.

Gazeteer of India, vol. ix., p. 407.</page><page sequence="10">160 Proceedings of the Royal lrish Academy. From these high temperatures there is a decline, in other springs, downwards, till a point of constant temperature is reached which is independent of that of the surrounding atmosphere; when such is the ease, the natives say of the water that it feels hot in the cold weather, and cool in summer. I know of several in Bengal which are so referred to, and there is one in Kashmir, called Theed (No. 75), which was similarly described in the native chronicle of Akbar's time. That there is any very great constancy of temperature in these hot springs for long periods is unlikely. We know them to occasionaly decrease in size, and ultimately die out altogether; and we have one instance at least, though it differs from the others in the fact that it is in the immediate proximity of a dormant volcano, in the spring on Barren Island, where there is a steady periodic diminution in heat. The facts in connection with this particular spring I have elsewhere recorded; they may, however, conveniently be summarized here as follows: - In 1832 it was described as almost boiling ; in 1857 (Drs. Mouat and Playfair) it was too hot to be borne by the hand (their thermometer was only capable of measuring up to 1400 F.); in 1858 (Dr. Liebig) almost boiling; in 1862 (Rev. C. Parish) scalding hot; in 1866 (Andaman Committee) 158?-163? F.; in 1873 (V. Ball) 1300 F.; in 1884 (F. R. Mallet) 106?-116?F. These observations are not sufficient to establish the ' rate' of cooling, though the later ones indicate that the rate itself has diminished as the cooling has progressed, in general accordance with the well-known law. Many of the hot springs in India, which are fairly warm, are pro 'vided with large masonry reservoirs, in which visitors can bathe. But sometimes the priests or people have not been enterprising enough to construct regular baths. One which I visited at Atari, near Rhurda, in Orissa, flowed with a copious stream, at a temperature of 138? F., into a small basin, from which the water overflowed into a puddle. I was -told that annually, at a particular festival, this spring is visited by numbers of people, and that scrambles take place for betel nuts, which are thrown into the mud by the Brahmins. The scramblers are prin cipally barren women, and those among them who succeed in fiinding a betel nut will, so it is said, have their desire for children gratified ere long. In the meantime a somewhat amusing spectacle is afforded to the rest of the congregation. Of specially prepared baths, with all the devotional adjuncts, that at Sohna (No. 136), about thirty-five miles south of Delhi, may be taken as a fine example. The water in the hot spring there has a temperature of 108? F. ; it is received in a basin cut out of the solid rock, which is 16 feet square and about 30</page><page sequence="11">BALL-On the Volcanoes anid fot Springs of Izdia. 161 feet deep; it is covered by a dome, and surrounded by apartments, with an open verandah, now occupied by the Brahmins. &amp; A site at Sitakund, in Chitagong, in the East, several which are in Sind in the West, and others in the high Himalayas, besides many nearer at hand, are visited by pious Hindus from all parts of India. Not unfrequently Hindu temples, and, in a few cases, Mahommedan shrines, have been erected in their immediate vicinities. A-t Tatapani, in Sirguja, already referred to, I saw a dome-like structure which had been erected over a spring which, when I was there, had ceased to flow, though there were numbers of others in an active condition all round it. Possibly the deserted aspect the place then presented may have been connected with the cessation of that particular spring. The mineral substances which have either been proved to exist in the waters of these springs by chemical analysis, or are manifest to the eye by the deposits which concrete and solidify as the waters cool down, indicate with sufficient clearness the nature of the chemical reactions which have probably given rise to the heat. In some few cases, however, where the water is comparatively pure, or for * other reasons, it may be necessary to invoke the aid of the internal heat of the earth to account for the high temperature.' In general .terms, however, it may be said that such lhot spring's as are here edescribed are int connected with true volcanic phenomena. The explanations given by the natives are not all so extravagant ,or mystical as those which are quoted below; for, in the time of Akbar, the heat of the spring at Sohna, already referred to, was ascribed to a mine of sulphur.2 The following are typical examples of the usual explanations :given by the natives to account for the phenomena. The first presents a striking, rese-mblance to the biblical story of the miraculouts supply .of water which we are told Moses obtained for the Israelites in the wilderness. It refers to a spring near Anaval (No. 23), 60 miles .'south-east of Surat, which is said to have been produced by an arrow, shot by Rama in order to supply 18,000 priests, who had been miracu loulsly transported there by Hunliman, and were in want of water. This locality is the site of a great fair which is held in the month (ihaitro, when the temperature of the water, so it is said is miraculously lowered from its norma height so as to admit of the pilglims bathing in the water. In Sind there are somewhat similar stories of certain 1 " Jungle Life in India," p. 531. 2 See Ayin Akbari, Glad win1 s ed., vol. ii., 1800, p. 88.</page><page sequence="12">162 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. hot springs at Lakhi (No. 36) having been produced by the interven tion of a saintly personage. Here it would seem that if a visitor " plunges in without confessing to the priest [and paying his dues] he comes out covered with boils." 1 Several of the explanations are connected with the story of the adventures of Rama and Sita, the spring called Sitakund, in Moughyr, for instance, being thus accounted for:-'" Sita having been suspected of having been unfaithful to her husband, while a captive to Ravan, underwent the ordeal of fire, but this was not considered sufficient, so she was compelled to throw herself into a pit filled with fire, and when she came out pure from the flames, warm water flowed from the rock and continues to do so to this day.' 2 At Jamnutri, in the State of Garhwal in the north-west Hima layas, near the source of the Jamna river, there are numerous hot springs, from one of which a column of water of considerable size issues, all the springs have their own special names. In the centre there is a reservoir, the heat of which (Temp. 1940 F.) is explained by the Rindoos, who say that in it the monkey god iluniman extinguished his flaming tail after he had set fire to the palace of Ravan in Ceylon. At Jawalamukhi,4 in Dehra, Kangra District, there are six hot mineral springs which are impregnated with common salt and iodide of potassium, there are also jets of combustible gas, which are kept constantly burning as a manifestation of Devi, to whom a temple ha, been erected. According to the local tradition the flames issue from the mouth of the Daitya king or demon, who was overwhelmed by Siva under a pile of mountains. Near the town of Islamabad, in Kashmir, there are one or two springs the temperature of which is only 100 above that of other springs close by; the water is sulphurous and large quantities of gas exhale from it. A legend connects the origin with a creative act of Vishnu. The water swarms with sacred fish. The reservoir used to, be called Anat Nag. Sometimes when there are accumulations of calcareous tuff, or travertin, especially of that variety which presents some resemblance to the cancellous tissue of bones, we find stories about their being the 1 Todd, " Bajasthan," vol. ii., p. 234. 3 Martin, " E.

And here it may be well to add that throughout India deposits of travertin, though not necessarily formed through the agency of hot springs, are called ashakar, or giants' bones. I have seen many cases of this deposit being formed by the evaporation of percolating waters and even of running streams both in India and elsewhere, in fact the phenomenon is not uncommon. In one case near a waterfall in a river flowing from the plateau to the south of the station of Hazaribagh, in Bengal, the spray which struck one of the confining walls of the fall has, by its con tinuous evaporation, left behind it a deposit of calcareous solids, which by long accumulation has formed a mass of several hundred tons in weight. More than one instance might be quoted where geologists in India have been strongly urged and sometimes even induced to make long and fruitless journeys to investigate such deposits of travertin, in the hope of finding a rich harvest of fossil remains of extinct animals.2 The following are a few of the cases where there are considerable deposits of travertin in connection with hot springs. A hot spring near Pir Gazi, in Sind, has deposited what is now a cliff of calcareous tuft, 200 feet high, and several hundred feet in length.3 There is also a considerable spread of calcareous tuft at Shah Ruhi. Besides which there are in Sind various other springs which afford similar deposits. All of them evolve sulphuretted hydrogen.' In Baltis tan the hot springs are accompanied by enormous deposits of travertin, which have even been compared to the deposits in the Yellow-Stone Park in America. They also evolve sulphuretted hydrogen; and one of them at Chongo enjoys a high repute among the Baltis for its medicinal virtues.5 Apart from all superstition there can be no doubt of the medicinal value of many of these springs, and in some cases they have been highly commended by medical men; but to what extent the waters are used internally as curatives has seldom been recorded fully; indeed, in some cases they are regarded, probably from experience, as 1 Masson, " Belochistan," vol. ii., p. 357. 2 Similar stories are told, I believe, about the pumice in some of the South Sea Islands. 3 Blanford, "W.

A curious testimony to the virtues of -one is given in the case of Mat (No. 2), in the Xonkan, where, accord ing to Dr. Duncan,' the people are afraid to drink the water on account of the increased consumption of food it occasions by creating a voracious appetite. According to Gerrard a group of springs at Changrizang (No. 121), near Shalkar, in the northern Himalayas, have " great repute for their curative powers, each being considered specific for some special com plaint, just as it might be at some European spa," and with a cruel indifference to the interest of the " profession " in that part of the world, " the names of the different diseases and directions for bathing and drinking are engraved in the Tartar tongue upon flat stones beside each."2 The water of Sita Kund at Monghyr used formerly, in consequence *of its great purity, to be bottled for export, and indeed is still largely used in the manufacture of soda water. Its purity is attributed to the fact already referred to that Sita once bathed in it.3 According to one writer,' to frequent bathing in a particular hot spring, namely, Sohna, near Delhi, which has already been referred to, an unhealthy and cadaverous appearance among the people is attributable; the bath is said to be crowded by men during the day and by women at night. But it is stated5 that the water is consi -dered a specific for the well known " Delhi ulcers," and that " it possesses remarkable curative properties in rheumatism and skin diseases." At Attaran, in Amherst, there are tein springs which have a tem perature of 130 F.; carbonic acid gas is said to be abundantly evolved by three of these springs which are in active ebullition, a-nd a cold fetid spring yields sulphuretted hvdrogen gas. The water is said to approach nearest in character to that of Toplitz, and it is excellent in many diseases, especially in liver complaints. The Burmese use it in fever and skin diseases.6 Jhilanand, an island in the Rann of Cutch, contains a hot spring, called Blolwa. And Anand, a king, is said to have been cured of leprosy by bathing in it.7 1 Trans. Med. and Phys.

F. The water is believed to be beneficial for skin diseases. The place is held sacred by the Hindus, who assert that Ramna performed the funeral ceremonies of his father there.' So far back as the time of Akbar a spring at Parwa, in Eashmir, was described as being one in which lepers were healed by bathing.' At Belkapi (No. 173), in HTazaxibagh, there is a copious deposit of' socliaum chloride and sulphate, with inclications of iron sulphate, front a hot spring; cattle are said to be very fond of it.3 In the ]Bakh ravine of the Salt Range of the Punjab, sulphuretted hydrogen bubbles up, and the water, which is covered by a thin film of gypsum, deposits a black tenacious mud used as a dye by the. natives for colouring cotton clothes.' In some cases the hot springs are accompanied by outbursts of inflammable gas. Occasionally there are cases too of gas being evolved without the accompaniment of water. At a place, nine and a-half miles from Ka-ma, in the Thayetmyo district of BuLirmah, there is a curious manifestation known as the " spirit fire." It is cansed by the (reputed) spontaneous ignition of gas stored in the subterranean fissures.5 A spring at the WYchongbum stream, in the upper Dehing Basin in Assam, is described by Mr. T. D. La Touche as evolving a considerable amouint of gas in conjunction with a small amount of water at a temperature of 890 F. The gas when ignited burnt freely with a flame three or four feet high?8 In an interesting Faper by Dr. Wadde]1, in which he gives an account of the hot springs of -3ehar, he says that most of them are held in considerable repute by the natives of the neighbourliood as. potent remedles, especialy for itch, ulcers, and other skin a:ffections. B-ut a most essential part of the process consists in the preliminary worship which must be paid to the presiding deity of the spring. " Nearly all of these springs are worshipped by the Hindu and semi-aboriginal villagers in the vicinity; for these strange outbursts of heatedl water, boiling up cauldron-like and wreathed in clouLds of vapour, are regarded by them as supernatural phenomena, and the 1 Hunter, W.

The deity usually worshipped at the springs by the semi-aborigines is Mata or Mai, the mother goddess, one of the forms of Hali, and large melas or fairs are held in her honour. She is especially worshipped by those suffering from itch and other skin diseases; also by the barren, both male and female, who all bathe in the water and drink some of it. Goats, &amp;c., are sacrificed to her, and the rocks are daubed with vermilion or red lead, and pieces of coloured rags are tied to the nearest bush or tree in her worship. At Tat-loi the mela is held in January, and is attended by over 100,000 persons. At Nun-bil the goddess is called .Msn-bil devi, and she is believed to reside in a large sal tree (Shorrea robusta) over the spring; her mela (or fair) is held in December, and is also attended by about 100,000 persons. The melas at the other springs are less numerously attended. At Jhariya, the Bhuniya ghatwals of Dravidian type, with short frizzly hair, worship with a fowl for sacrifice, and offerings of rice, the spirit of Son-mon Pande, a Brahmin priest who is said to have died there. The more Hinduized worshippers, however, believe that their favourite god, Mahadeva, is present at all these hot springs, and to him they offer worship, except at Sita-kund, where worship of Ram and Sita is performed."'I The mention in the above extract of the custom among the abori ginal inhabitants of tying pieces of coloured rags to the bushes will naturally excite the attention of those who are aware of the preva lence of a similar custom in this country, as is also the case, I believe, in certain other parts of Westerm Europe. During the past year I was present on an occasion when this, as being a custom practised in Ireland and among Celtic nations generally, was being discussed, and my statement that it was prevalent in India, at least in those parts with which I am most familiar, and which are largely inhabited by the so-called aboriginal races, was received with some surprise. I could not help regretting that I had not given the subject closer investigation, when I had the opportunity, in India. I have, how ever, frequently noticed rags thus tied to bushes in the regions referred to; and in the Himalayas I have noted near Darjiling the practice of attaching pieces of calico with block-printed prayers in the Tibetan language, on the bushes and planted poles near the temples. This last is perhaps a not wholly analogous practice. The Abbe Dubois' indicates in the following passage that the custom is 1 J. A. S.

He says: -" Among the trees there are some which Hindu supe'rstition has distinguished with particular honours, on account of the good or evil they are capable of producing. Of the mischievous kind there is a prickly shrub, the points of which are poisonous, to avert the effect of which they offer a sacrifice of a particular nature. It consists in sticking rags on its branches, with which it is sometimes wholly covered. Those who have travelled in the southern provinces must have observed many examples of this." It is impossible from so meagre a description to identify the tree referred to, but I think I have seen rags on the babul (Adcacia arabica), a thorny shrub which is common in the neighbourhood of the Grand Trunk-road in Bengal. Where hot springs occur in spots sheltered by rocks or trees it not unfrequently happens that the warm and moist atmosphere of the immediate neighbourhood supports a vegetation unlike that occurring in the surrounding areas. Sir Joseph Hooker thus described the effect of some hot springs with a maximuim temperature of 116? F., which are situated at an elevation of 16,000 feet above the sea, one mile from the foot of Kinchinrjow glacier in Sikkim:-"A few plant s make the neighbour hood of the hot springs a little oasis, and the large Marmot is common, uttering its sharp chirping squeak." A few days after leaving this neighbourhood, Sir Joseph's thermometer was found to be missing, and the servant responsible for the loss voluntarily started back to retrace the marches to Kinchinjow in order to search for it, and spent the whole of a cold October night in the hot water, without fire or shelter at 16,000 feet above the sea," thus affording an instance of how hot springs may furnish the means whereby life may be sustained in localities where it would otherwise perish. Animal life is present, naturally, in the waters of many of these springs. I have seen brightly coloured fish swimming about in the sea near the spring on Barren Island, where the temperature was almost too hot to allow of the hand being retained in it for any time. And the famous Magar Pir (or as it should be Mungal Pir), seven miles north of Karachi, is the prolific home of numerous crocodiles. The animals, however, live principally in the swamp below the hot springs which feed it. But in one of the stone reservoirs which collect the water a large crocodile was seen on one occasion together with a dozen young ones. lie is called the peacock' by the in 1 Himalyan Journals, vol. ii., 1855, p. 140.</page><page sequence="18">168 Proceedings of the Royal I8ish Academy. habitants, who regard him as the progenitor of the race. Goats are. frequently brought as offerings to the crocodiles by those who. come to these springs in pilgrimage from Karachi. The temperature of the springs is 133 F., and the water is considered efficacious in all kinds of disease. I should add, in mentioning the above facts, that the point intended} to be emphasized is rather the maintenance of and veneration paid to the crocodiles by the natives, than that these animals thrive specially under the influence of the hot springs. Dr. Thomson has recorded some remarks on the influence of hot springs on the vegetation and animal life at Pugha, where at an eleva tion of 15,500 feet on the banks of the Indus there are numerous, hot springs, in association with which there are considerable deposits of sulphur and borax. "The hottest spring had a temperature of 174 F. From these springs gas was copiously evolved, smelling strongly of sulphur" . . . " The stream which was perhaps 20 feet wide was usually rather deep. Dense masses of aquatic weeds, chiefly species of Zannichellia and Potamogeton grew in the water . . . A small crustaceous animal was common among the weedsE The stream was full of fish, which swarmed among the weeds and daTted backwards and forwards in the tepid water in immense shoals. They were generally about six inches in length, and appeared to my inexperienced eye to belong to two or three different species. from those which had been found at Hanle. In the hottest water of the hot springs I collected three species of conferva. The existence of the tree Myricaria, in the gorges between Pugha and the Indus, which had appeared to us at the time very remarkable, was fully explained by the occurrence of the hot springs, and the consequent high temperature of the water of the stream, and was peculiarly interesting as an illustration of the influence of temperature on vegetation. It may fairly be considered, I think, as a proof that arboreous vegetation does not cease at great elevations in con sequence of the rarifaction of the air, but only on account of the diminution of the temperature which usually accompanies increasedt elevation. The trees of iyricaria, it must be observed, came abruptly to an end with the ravine, none occurring on the open plain. We cannot suppose that the trifling increased elevation caused their disappearance; it seems probable that the narrow walls of the gorge, by concentrating the heat, prevented its escape, and that therefore the temperature was more elevated than on the open plain, where the action of winds and free radiation combined to lower it."</page><page sequence="19">BALL0- the Volcanoes and Hot Springs of Iadi/a. 169 "The occurrence of fish in the water at Pugha, at an elevation of nearly 15,500 feet above the level of the sea is also very remark able, and still more strikingly demonstrative of the same fact, in asmuch as it would certainly not have been very surprising that air at that elevation should from its rarity be insufficient for the support of life in animals breathing by gills." I To those who may desire to pursue this line of enquiry it may be useful to mention that lists of the species of conferva and diatomaeca which have been found in the hot springs at high altitudes in the Himalayas are given in Balfour's " Cyclopedia," together with refe rences to the literature of the subject, in the article on hot springs. These facts and deductions lead very naturally to the considera tion of what I have elsewhere suggested2, namely, the probability that the evidence which is usually relied upon by geologists in their reconstructions of the climates under which life existed in long past geological periods may require some revision, or at least reconsidera tion. Where the fossils of animals or plants are found which seem to indicate tropical or semi-tropical conditions of the climate at the time when they lived, may it not be possible to suggest, especially if there be any facts tending to prove the existence of different climatic condi tions elsewhere at the same time, that there may have been widespread fumaroles or hot springs sufficient to have produced local hot-houses in which animals and plants may have flourished which could not otherwise have existed in the normal conditions of climate belonging properly to the time and place? 1 Thomson, " Western Himalayas and Tibet," pp. 164-5.
