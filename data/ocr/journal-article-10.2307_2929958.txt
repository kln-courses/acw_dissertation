<plain_text><page sequence="1">CATHERINE DEMURE Montaigne: The Paradox and the Miracle-Structure and Meaning in "The Apology for Raymond Sebond" (Essais I:12) From this essay to the Essays, there is neither any shortcut possible nor any implication from a principle to a consequence: the refusal of an organizing system in this fundamentally open work makes the circle which goes from the whole to its parts interminable. But doubtless it is not unimportant, nor without implications for the reading of the entire work, to be able to show, throughout a text as considerable as the "Apology," the coherence of a system of thought which is the rigorous expression of the possibilities and limits of the philosophical enterprise at the dawn of modern times. The goal of this study is to bring to light the structure of one chapter of the Essays, the "Apology for Raymond Sebond," whose importance the most divergent readings acknowledge in spite of the conflict of interpreta- tions. We know that Villey' sees in the "Apology" the high point of a "skeptical crisis" which Montaigne was then to transcend and repudiate; as for Brunschvicg,2 he uses the "Apology" as a constant, central reference point for his reading of the Essays, but he blurs its tension in order to demonstrate the powers of balance and happiness of a moral subject on the far side of skepticism. We have been obliged to recall these conclusions before proposing a structural reading of the "Apology," that is, very simply, a reading which bases meaning on the formal organization of the text in its literalness and integrality. We shall show, thus, counter to a "humanist" or moderate reading, that This article is a translation of "Montaigne: Le Paradoxe et le Miracle. Structure et sens dans l"Apologie de Raymond Sebon' (Essais, II, 12)" which first appeared in French in Les Etudes Philosophiques, no. 4/1978. It is reprinted here with the kind permission of the author Catherine Demure. 1. Cf. his brief but very clear presentation of the "Apology" in his edition of the Essays, op cit. 2. Leon Brunschvicg, Descartes et Pascal, lecteurs de Montaigne (Paris: La Baconniere, 1945). 188</page><page sequence="2">CATHERINE DEMURE 189 the coherence of Montaigne's thought appears here in the rigor of a maintained contradiction: the model of this paradox, which makes up the very heart of the text, is constituted by the status of theology, a knowledge which is both necessary and impossible. But inversely, against an "antihumanist" reading such as Jean-Yves Pouilloux's,3 we affirm the existence of an "ideological content": in dealing with knowledge and action, Montaigne affirms both the distinction and contradiction of the two orders, and, with a dual fidelity to Christianity and Socrates, asserts that true knowledge is awareness of ignorance: a goal to regain, where all the possibilities of philosophical endeavor are inscribed. I. IN ORDER TO READ, ONE MUST READ EVERYTHING We know that, following his presentation of the "Apology," Villey proposes an outline of it. Without going into detail, we can note from the start that the opening of the text is excluded from the outline, which Villey thereby relegates to the inessential; now, this opening is a rapid presenta- tion of Montaigne's relationship to knowledge and of the conditions of his access to Sebond's text. Speaking in it of knowledge in general, of "letters," Montaigne indeed writes here: (a) "Moy, je les ayme bien, mais je ne les adore pas" (439). (a) ["Myself, I like them well enough, but I do not worship them" (319).] Even if we reserve an understanding of this text, it is clear that it has a slightly different ring from certain affirmations of a total, definitive rejection of knowledge which the ulterior text will present. But Villey also presents the end of the text as a mere prolongation, without connecting it in any way with the context; as for Pouilloux, he says nothing about this ending.4 Is it innocuous, then, or repetitive? Not at all: what is involved is a quotation from Seneca which is difficult and paradoxal in itself: (a) "O la vile chose, dit-il, et abjecte, que l'homme, s'il ne s'esleve au dessus de l'humanite! " (604) [(a) "O what a vile and abject thing is man," he says, "if he does not raise himself above humanity!" (457)] and which Montaigne's commentary takes up again-especially strengthening its paradoxical, even contradictory, aspect-in two additions dating from the (c) manuscript; the two moments of this commentary are in fact the following: the first moment: (c) "Voyla un bon mot, et un utile desir, mais pareillement 3. Jean-Yves Pouilloux, Lire les "Essais" de Montaigne (Paris: Maspero, 1969). 4. Hugo Friedrich, on the other hand, dwells on this conclusion at length; we shall return to this commentary. Hugo Friedrich, Montaigne (Paris: Gallimard, 1968 for the French translation), p. 107.</page><page sequence="3">190 Yale French Studies absurde" (604). [(c) "That is a good statement and a useful desire, but equally absurd" (457)]; and the second moment-and this sentence definitively closes the text of the "Apology": (c) "C'est a nostre foy Chrestienne, non a sa vertu Stoique, de pretendre a cette divine et miraculeuse metamorphose" (604). [(c) "It is for our Christian faith, not for his Stoical virtue, to aspire to that divine and miraculous metamorphosis" (457).] Here again, this diffi- cult text-a real appeal to understanding and a quite manifest return to the problematics of the "Apology" as to the true place of man and his powers in the world-cannot be evaded. Without anticipating the ulterior reading of the text, we can then already affirm that these two texts, the opening and closing of the "Apology," must be understood within and through the context, which will doubtless be illuminated by them in its turn. Limits of a very long text which they enclose, these passages may find in it their meaning, or perhaps a confirmation of their meaning by reflection. One must affirm, then, the absolute necessity of first respecting the external form of the text, which really begins with this opening and which really ends with this conclusion. In short, in order to read, one must read everything. No matter what the "situation" of a text which it claims to reveal and activate, no rigorous reading can abandon what constitutes the material boundaries of that text. This methodological requirement, moreover, is not based only on these criteria of the exhaustiveness of the reading. Every partial reading reaches a second stopping point when it encounters a new difficulty, in this case one so obvious that it is all but forgotten in the most precise readings, and this difficulty will also lead us to problems of meaning. II. WHY THIS SUBJECT: "THE APOLOGY FOR RAYMOND SEBOND "? We know that Pouilloux shows, rightly, that for Montaigne there is "an intellectual, philosophical innovation which makes all subjects possible for him."' Granted, all subjects are possible for him, but: the longest Essay on a text which Montaigne literally destroys! On a text about which he says (a strange compliment for a theological work) that he finds "belles les imaginations" ["the ideas of this author fine"] and that "beaucoup de gens s'amusent a le lire, et notamment les dames" (440); ["many people are busy reading it, and especially the ladies" (320),] on a text which he judges doubly vain, first because no theology is possible for man-a sufficient argument in itself !-and secondly because reason is particularly unsuitable for this task 5. Pouilloux, p. 59.</page><page sequence="4">CATHERINE DEMURE 191 (which is impossible, besides ... .) There is, at the very least, a problem here: why then does Montaigne devote such a long discourse to this work which he could sufficiently refute in a few lines? In other words, why "The Apology for Raymond Sebond"? How can we not see an anomaly, an incoherence, in taking as the object of his reflection a text of which Montaigne will show only the weaknesses, when we know that, no matter how critical, even subversive, his thought may be, it is never polemical? It seems that on one level, however, this contradiction may be, if not completely removed, at least made comprehensible by its presuppositions. First of all, Montaigne tells us, the text is dear to him because he translated it and worked on it, which confers upon it at least a subjective importance, especially since this work was undertaken for Montaigne's father, and at his request: Or, quelques jours avant sa mort, mon pere, ayant de fortune rencontr6 ce livre soubs un tas d'autres papiers abandonnez, me commanda de le luy mettre en Francois. [439] Now some days before his death, my father, having by chance come across this book under a pile of other abandoned papers, commanded me to put it into French for him. [320] This father had died several years before (in 1568), and Montaigne loved him. This is what permits us to understand his choice of Sebond's text among other theological essays. But there is more. In this era of conflicts and religious wars (and we know how overwhelmed Montaigne was to learn of their atrocity, and that this atrocity appealed on both sides to evangelical truth), and even though in other respects Montaigne believes theology to be impossible and dangerous, he still thinks that after the "nouvelletez de Luther" (the "innovations of Luther") Sebond's text could reasonably appear capable of combatting "un execrable atheisme" ("an execrable atheism") which the "maladie" ("malady") of free examination "aysement" ("easily") risked bringing about (439) (320).] But if Montaigne's choice of Sebond's text becomes comprehensible in this way, the essence of the difficulty remains, since the text, dear to Montaigne's heart and possibly useful on the religious and social plane, will nevertheless be totally ruined by him. But this is because we had only seen a superficial difficulty, so to speak historical, which masked a contradiction that will dominate the whole text, to which we shall have to refer the text in its entirety. This dominant contradiction is announced and confirmed by the opening</page><page sequence="5">192 Yale French Studies and closing texts of the "Apology," whose importance we have already emphasized. Radical and definitive, it is presented in the sixth paragraph of the "Apology" when Montaigne takes up an examination of the theological project. What does Montaigne affirm in fact? First of all (and this thesis will be abundantly developed in the continuation of the text, notably at the criticism of anthropomorphic conceptions of God) the radical impossibil- ity of all theology; it is a knowledge which is absolutely out of our power and grasp: Toutefois je juge ainsi, qu'A une chose si divine et si hautaine, et surpassant de si loing l'humaine intelligence, comme est cette verit6 de laquelle il a pleu a la bont6 de Dieu nous esclairer, il est bien besoin qu'il nous preste encore son secours, d'une faveur extraordinarie et privileg6e, pour la pouvoir concevoir et loger en nous; et ne croy pas que les moyens purement humains en soyent aucunement capables. [440-41] However, I think thus, that in a thing so divine and so lofty, and so far surpassing human intelligence, as is this truth with which it has pleased the goodness of God to enlighten us, it is very necessary that he still lend us his help, by extraordinary and privileged favor, so that we may conceive it and lodge it in us. And I do not think that purely human means are at all capable of this. [321] Human intelligence, therefore, cannot gain access to God or theology; only faith in the revealed word enables us to attain the mysteries of religion, but not to understand them, or perhaps even to express them (441). And this determining thesis will weigh on the whole text. Montaigne will conclude his account of philosophical contradictions concerning the soul's immor- tality with these words: "Confessons ingenuement que Dieu seul nous l'a dict, et la foy: car lecon n'est ce pas de nature et de nostre raison" (554). ["Let us confess frankly that God alone has told us so, and faith; for a lesson of nature and of our reason it is not" (415)], words which he had founded earlier with the affirmation that "c'est a Dieu seul de se cognoistre et d'interpreter ses ouvrages" (499). ["It is for God alone to know himself and to interpret his works (369)]. Why then doesn't Montaigne stop there, why this detour through Sebond's theology, through the conflict of philosophical and religious beliefs? Why, if only to demonstrate its inanity, pursue at such length the road of theology? Because this impossible knowledge is nevertheless necessary to man; it is even the highest, most valorized human enterprise;</page><page sequence="6">CATHERINE DEMURE 193 so that after having posited the impossibility of theology, Montaigne affirms that [c'est] une tresbelle et treslofiable entreprinse d'accommoder encore au service de nostre foy les utils naturels et humains que Dieu nous a donnez. II ne faut pas douter que ce ne soit l'usage le plus honorable que nous leur sqaurions donner ... [441] it is. . . a very fine and very laudable enterprise to accommodate also to the service of our faith the natural and human tools that God has given us. There can be no doubt that this is the most honorable use that we could put them to ... [321] Therefore we see Montaigne conclude the paragraph in this way, by legitimating the attempt at thought about the divine which must "accom- paigner nostre foy" [accompany our faith"] even though he knows that "ny ... nos efforts et arguments puissent atteindre a une si supernaturelle et divine science" (441). ["our efforts and arguments can[not] attain a knowl- edge so supernatural and divine" (321)]. In such a way is this fundamental contradiction stated. It refers to a paradox of which neither term will be removed or modified. The whole development of the "Apology," as it has often and truly been said, aims at ruining any claim to establish certain knowledge; the senses and reason, experience and discourse (discours), are deceptive, and human privilege doubtful. Like any other realm of knowledge and more than any other, theological knowledge is impossible. What has been seen less often is the situation of this apology for skepticism in a paradoxical problematics: even if it is impossible, knowledge about God is still necessary. The whole "Apology" testifies relentlessly to the vanity of human knowledge, but we shall only be able to understand this "apogee of skepticism " by enclosing it within theparadox which governs the whole text and which alonepermits it to function. This schema of a paradoxical thought is close to the one which Lucien Goldmann presented as constitutive of Pascal's philosophy in Les Pensees6 and which he related to the notion of "tragic vision" borrowed from the young Lukaics. The proximity of Montaigne's and Pascal's approaches and the difference between them thus become the instrument of a vaster theological enterprise seeking to reveal, before and after the emergence of the Cartesian system, the meaning of this contestation of a rationalist vision of man and the world. 6.

STRUCTURE AND MEANING IN "THE APOLOGY FOR RAYMOND SEBOND" 1) The "Apology" fits into a criticism of learning: more restricted than limited (plus bornee que limitee) Montaigne's reflection begins with an affirmation of principles whose bearing could be vague or could betray an inconsequential "skepticism" were it not for the context and argumentation which support it: C'est, a la verit6, une tres-utile et grande partie que la science, ceux qui la mesprisent, tesmoignent assez leur bestise; mais je n'estime pas pourtant sa valeur jusques a cette mesure extreme qu'aucuns luy attribuent, comme Herillus le philosophe, qui logeoit en elle le souverain bien, et tenoit qu'il fut en elle de nous rendre sages et contens [438] In truth, knowledge is a great and very useful quality; those who despise it give evidence enough of their stupidity. But yet I do not set its value at that extreme measure that some attribute to it, like Herillus the philosopher, who placed in it the sovereign good, and held that it was in its power to make us wise and content. [319] Such are the first lines of this essay which situate us, it seems, in that moderation, that equilibrium to which it would be Montaigne's mission to bear witness.7 Will he not reinforce his moderate and somewhat distant, attitude towards "letters," which are the very body of all knowledge, by writing at the end of this same paragraph: "Moy, je les ayme bien, mais je ne les adore pas"? ["Myself, I like them well enough, but I do not worship them"?] But do we understand the text correctly? It is a question here of nuances, of moderation, of equilibrium? Can one accept a flat, anodyne reading of these lines of exordium when they lead to one of their author's most important essays? Let us go back. And first of all, in order to point out the unexpectedness of this praise of knowledge on the threshhold of one of Montaigne's most violently skeptical texts; what is written (l'6crit) remains, as well as the totality of the text. Being ignorant of knowledge is "bestise" ("stupidity"); loving philosophy and knowledge,8 on the contrary, goes without saying; to 7. Cf. for example Brunschvicg, op. cit., p. 87: "The simply human ideal of balance and harmony has never been expressed more exquisitely." 8. On the sciences and scholastic intellectual techniques, and on the content designated by the vocables "letters," "philosophy," etc., reference to Gilson's works remains irreplaceable. On the French humanist movement in the sixteenth century, and on innovations in matters of education in particular, reference to the works of Robert Mandrou (Introduction a la France moderne, Albin Michel, 1961 and 1974) permits a synthesis which the bibliographical references in Chapter V, section D, complete, especially Franqois de Dainville, Les J6suites et</page><page sequence="8">CATHERINE DEMURE 195 be unaware of them is to deprive oneself of thought itself. No matter what the limits of factual knowledge, they are contested by a movement of thought which is a philosophy and a search for a possible learning. It is the manifest character of the statement-Montaigne being the intellectual that he is-and not any scorn or irony on his part, which makes it so brief and so little argued here: the "will to know" (le "vouloir-savoir") is legitimate if not in its results, at least in its intention to learn and to organize learning into a body of knowledge. Thus when the text turns back upon itself and Montaigne refuses to take this love of knowledge to the "extresme", it is not in order to exhibit a skeptical argumentation on the impotence of reason or the opacity of reality. If he refuses the type of life which will be Descartes', the one which the true moral maxim of the Discours de la Mgthode expresses: "to spend my whole life in cultivating my reason, and to advance as much as I can in the knowledge of truth . . ."9 it is not at all that he "moderates" adoration into simple affection; the difference is not quantita- tive, but qualitative. To love the sciences rather than to worship them, no matter how great the effort which leads Montaigne toward intellectual reflection, is not to be moderate but divided. The postulate which underlies Montaigne's reticences here is neither methodological nor skeptical: it refers to the irreducible difference of orders. What Montaigne refuses is adoration owed to God, to the signifying totality of the world; and he is gently ironical toward his father, infatuated with learned personages; recueillant leurs sentences et leurs discours comme des oracles, et avec d'autant plus de reverence et de religion qu'il avoit moins de loy d'en juger, car il n'avoit aucune connoissance des lettres ... [439] collecting their savings and discourses like oracles, and with all the more reverence and religion as he was less qualified to judge them; for he had no knowledge of letters . .. [3191 More versed than him in letters and intellectual life, Montaigne does not ask for moderation, but the distinction of genres: life cannot be inscribed in a single register which would be that of knowledge. Science-no matter what its scope, rigor, and possibilities are in other respects-cannot "nous rendre sages et contens" (p. 438); ["make us wise and content" (p. 319);] he does not believe, he says, "ny ce que d'autres ont dict, que la science est mere de toute vertu, et que tout vice est produit par l'ignorance (438); 1'6ducation de la soci&amp;t6 fran~aise, la naissance de l'humamsme moderne (Paris: Duchesne et ses fils, 1940). 9. Descartes, Discours de la MWthode, 3rd part. Ed. Gilson (Paris: Vrin, 1926 and 1967), p. 27.</page><page sequence="9">196 Yale French Studies ["what others have said, that knowledge is the mother of all virtue, and that all vice is produced by ignorance (p. 319).] Such is the postulate of Montaigne, who refutes what one may call the search for a theoretical confirmation, an epistemological legitimation of action. Happiness and virtue remain real finalities of human life, different from knowledge. This postulate is clear, and its understated formulation should not deceive us: its position preliminary to the whole development of the chapter marks a refusal of rationalism-if one means by the word, in its Cartesian sense, not the belief in a possible and necessary usage of rigorous reason, but the affirmation of the homogeneity of the world as knowable reality,1o and hence, the homogeneity of learning connaissance itself, completely identified with knowledge savoir, whose model is mathemati- cal science. Thus for Montaigne, beyond any skeptical argumentation, including the one which he himself will develop in the "Apology," the first insuffi- ciency of all knowledge is that it is only knowledge, and for this reason never concerns us entirely as such. For the rupture between orders is first of all a rupture in me; I am a being of mobility and conflict, diverse in the long run (duree) as well as during the moment, and a being whose unity is always in question; so much so that in the first chapter of the second book, Montaigne writes: Cette variation et contradiction qui se void en nous, si souple, a faict qu'aucuns nous songent deux ames, . . . une si brusque diversit6 ne se pouvant bien assortir a un subjet simple. [335] These supple variations and contradictions that are seen in us have made some imagine that we have two souls .. . for such sudden diversity cannot well be reconciled with a simple subject. [2421 Montaigne discovers this shattered subject in himself, such that je n'ay rien a dire de moy, entierement, simplement, et solidement, sans confusion et sans meslange, ny en un mot. DISTINGO est le plus universel membre de ma Logique. [335] I have nothing to say about myself absolutely, simply, and solidly, without confusion and without mixture, or in one word. Distinguo is the most universal member of my logic. [2421 This is why learning (connaissance) is not knowledge (savoir) here, but first of all description, "recitation"; and it is because I am-like the world-a 10. Without wishing to develop this point here, let us say in a word that we do not mean to reduce Cartesian "philosophy" to Cartesian "rationalism."</page><page sequence="10">CATHERINE DEMURE 197 "branloire perenne" (III:2, 804); ["perennial movement" (p. 6 10)] that "je ne puis asseurer mon object" (p. 805) ["I cannot keep my subject still" (p. 610)]. Located here is the origin, in Montaigne, of resistance to (rather than refusal of) the rationalist hypothesis: for the truth can be contradictory: "Tant y a que je me contredits bien a l'adventure, mais la verite . . . je ne la contredy point" (805). ["So, all in all, I may indeed contradict myself now and then; but truth . .. I do not contradict (611).] One sees where this modest introductory paragraph leads us and what a permanent counterpoint it will bring to bear on the whole ulterior argu- mentation of the text; under no circumstances can the skeptical argumen- tation of the "Apology" be considered the sole foundation of Montaigne's criticism of knowledge. The refusal to worship letters, the (real) distance with regard to organized knowledge," are not primarily skeptical attitudes putting the quality of knowledge into question, but the expression of a mistrust whose foundation is practical;12 wisdom and happiness are of a different order, which nothing permits me to reduce or subordinate to that of knowledge. If it is conceivable, such a dependence is at least "subject a une longue interpretation" (p. 438) ["subject to a long interpretation" (p. 319).] Montaigne, for his part, does not believe in it, and the skeptical argumentation will have to be reread in this perspective, which allows us to save the interest of the text beyond that of a rather superficial criticism of organized knowledge which one century would render obsolete. Pascal's thought will also violently express this mistrust and this affirmation of the hetereogeneity of orders without the slightest intrusion of skepticism. Copernicus, Galileo, Descartes will produce a new, rigorous knowledge; but this triumphant reason will stir up in Pascal (who is, however, a beneficiary of its rise) a protestation of all the more forceful in that it is more divided: he goes so far as to write against Descartes: "And even if that were true, we do not consider all philosophy to be worth one hour of pain."'13 ["Even if that were true. . ."I This introduction allows us then to affirm that the criticism of knowledge in Montaigne cannot be reduced to mere skepticism: the plurality of human finalities and the impossibility of reducing the subject to unity are here, explicity or implicity, the point of departure of the reflection. And this contradiction prepares and grounds the paradoxical 11. Cf. H. Friedrich who recalls "the distancing of the contemporary sciences" in Montaigne and who sees there, rightly, not so much the cause as the very effect of his mistrust in regard to human, intellectual, and technical claims to master nature (pp. 151-55). 12. One can see therefore that if we accept with Pouilloux that what is given in Montaigne is "the confusion of orders" (p. 107), we must refrain from concluding with him that there is a renunciation of any search for an "objective reference" (p. 81) to philosophical discourse. 13. Pascal, Les Pensges, ed. Brunschvicg (Paris: Hachette, 1959), fragment 79.</page><page sequence="11">198 Yale French Studies structure of the text: it is a divided subject, perhaps even rife with conflict, which touches upon his entire relationship to knowledge in general, and to theology in particular. This major contradiction organizes the argumenta- tion of the whole ulterior development; it will establish the coherence of a thought which is necessarily in conflict with all unifying dogmatisms. Skeptical argumentation properly speaking-multiform and uneven, besides-is thus only second in relation to this first, irremediable break of which the subject is the bearer. 2) Theology, Exemplary Knowledge Thus we can understand the strange series of reversals which Montaigne effects in his evaluation of the theological enterprise, which is the knowl- edge under consideration here. Montaigne's whole art here consists in encountering theology through personal paths, thereby merging reflection on an essential knowledge with his own story-which seems to be the inessential, the anecdotal, or even the insignificant. For therein, first of all, lies the privilege of theology in relation to Montaigne's project: history confronted him and his father, like all men of their time, and much more than others, with religious problems. Faced with the reality of contrary arguments, and with the reality of actions which take their inspiration from these arguments or which claim to, theology be- comes a personal matter for Montaigne. By choosing Sebond's theological work as the theme of a text as long and important as the "Apology," Montaigne chooses first of all, in accordance with his philosophical project, to speak himself (de se dire lui-meme),14 a theme which is doubly his, both through his personal history and through History itself. No matter what the difficulties or the impossibility for me to invest myself totally in an enterprise of knowledge, I feel myself (me, Montaigne, a Christian, a Catholic and a politically responsible figure) entirely concerned by a problem to which, beyond the properly intellectual interest which it can inspire, the necessities of action and the attempt to live happily lead me back incessantly, and often tragically. The first privilege of theology resides then in the fact that this "knowledge" is, in the sixteenth century, like the locus where all the possibilities of action and happiness converge-or from which they arise. And even though this is not the place to speak of "Montaigne's religion,"'" let us simply remember that the historical reality 14. Cf. "Au lecteur" ("To the Reader"): "Ainsi, lecteur, je suis moy-mesmes la matiere de mon livre. . ." (3); ["Thus, reader, I am myself the matter of my book. . ." (p. 2).] 15. First of all because this would be anticipating what only the reading of the "Apology" and then of the Essays can allow us to perceive. Then because theology and religion are obviously not equivalent.</page><page sequence="12">CATHERINE DEMURE 199 of the religious wars, the strange metamorphoses of the legitimacy through- out the relationships between the royalty and the Catholic and Protestant religions, only serve to dramatize the fundamental importance of the religious question for the whole sixteenth century, and force us-us, belated readers-to take this question into consideration as a constant horizon of this century, as Lucien Febvre has admirably shown in Le probleme de l'incroyance au XVIe siecle.16 But theology is privileged in another way-theology which causes Montaigne to choose it as the model of knowledge for and against which he will argue. This privileged status is not made any more explicit than the preceding one and, unlike the other, is not even alluded to. We feel it necessary, however, to bring it to light because it allows us, among other things, to perpetuate a contemporary reading of this text of Montaigne, and not just a historical one. What is theology for Montaigne, at least the one he discusses, and which he judges here in order to illustrate, let us not forget, a reflection on knowledge? It is a work of reason, entirely separate from the revelation and faith which certainly ground it, give rise to it, and control it, but which never mingle with it. Theology is a human science, an implementation of "utils naturels et humains" (441) ["natural and human tools" (321)1], of "moyens purement humains" (441); ["purely human means" (321)1; it is a work of "raison" ("reason") by means of "efforts et argumens" ("efforts and arguments"); in short, it is the realm of reason, and of human reason alone. It is therefore homogeneous with mathematics or logic and can thus perfectly illustrate the powers and the shortcomings of our capacity for knowledge. But in contrast to the other sciences, it allows us to attribute all its successes and failures to that reason alone; for, unlike all the other sciences, it has all its possible experience behind it: no progress to come, no discovery, no accumulation of results can occur to improve it or to modify it. Founded on revelation alone-which came about historically and was handed down to the man completely in definitive texts-it cannot look to the future for anything. Its field is that of reason alone. This is why skeptical argumentation takes on such a particular tone in this text, one so disdainful of the specific divisions of the sciences. This is not due to a misunderstanding (meconnaissance) of these sciences, but justifies rather this argumentation, as we have already said. For what reason 16. Ed. Albert Michel, 1942 and 1968: "Claiming to make the sixteenth century a skeptical century, a libertine century, a rationalist century, and glorifying it as such is the worst of errors and illusions. Through the will of its best representatives, it was, quite on the contrary, an inspired century. A century which, first of all, sought a reflection of the divine in all things" (p. 427).</page><page sequence="13">200 Yale French Studies cannot do is speak for happiness and the good. It it could, where could we see it better than in theology, a knowledge which, by its very essence, as the French historical context of the sixteenth century demonstrates dramati- cally, is the constant theoretical referent of men's lives? Then Montaigne's entire perspective turns back on itself indefinitely, for this impossible knowledge still remains just as necessary, and reason is its only instrument. And this is why Montaigne's attitude will be paradoxi- cal when he chooses-as he does choose to love, not worship, knowledge in general-to attempt this inevitable but unrealizable search for God through reason: (a) Ii ... faut ... accompaigner nostre foy de toute la raison qui est en nous, mais tousjours avec cette reservation de n'estimer pas que ce soit de nous qu'elle depende, ny que nos efforts et argumens puissent atteindre a une si supernaturelle et divine science. [441] (a) We must ... accompany our faith with all the reason that is in us, but always with this reservation, not to think that it is on us that faith depends, or that our efforts and arguments can attain a knowledge so supernatural and divine. [321] We have sufficiently shown that Sebond's text is not a simple pretext here by linking theology as a model of knowledge to Montaigne's global philosophical project and to the general subject of this essay. The fact still remains that the whole ulterior text will ruin the very claims of Sebond: is it to ridicule him? Could this be the real reason behind Montaigne's choice: a text too naive to resist skeptical argumentation?'7 Such a hypothesis is necessarily reductive, not only because it shows us a cynical Montaigne including his father in his derision, which is highly improbable and would be somewhat distressing, but especially because it masks the very tension of the text-and therefore its meaning, such as the paradoxical structures already pointed out allow us to foresee. For the truth is that Montaigne is both "for" and "against" Sebond, and not only in the relative, manageable harmony of good and bad arguments or of laudable intentions and mediocre results: even if real, these reasons remain abso- lutely accessory to Montaigne's observation. He is totally for and against Sebond, throughout, in contradiction and paradox-in the coherent but contradictory affirmation that we must approach the theological quest as perhaps the most urgent, fundamental pursuit, while at the same time we are convinced of the aporetic result of such a quest. So that no theological 17. Cf. Brunschvicg, op cit., p. 56: "The Apology, which appears to answer for Sebond, never stops talking and fighting against him."</page><page sequence="14">CATHERINE DEMURE 201 text other than Sebond's, even if it were infinitely superior to his, could have escaped Montaigne's criticism-nor be destroyed by it, either, how- ever. In order to see this better, we must take a closer look at the "responses" given by Montaigne to objections to Sebond. We find it particularly interesting to give the text here its complexity and movement against all simplification. Let us follow Montaigne, then: La premiere reprehension qu'on fait de son ouvrage, c'est que les Chretiens se font tort de vouloir appuyer leur creance par des raisons humaines, qui ne se conqoit que par foy et par une inspiration particuliere de la grace divine. [4401 The first criticism that they make of his work is that Christians do themselves harm in trying to support their belief by human reasons, since it is conceived only by faith and by a particular inspiration of divine grace. [321] In answer to this objection, Montaigne gives the response in which he defines the difficult and paradoxical relationship of man to theology. We shall not return to this response except to emphasize that it does not "ridicule" Sebond in any way;'8 it maintains the legitimacy of its (theologi- cal) attempt even while affirming the impossibility of reaching God through human means. But there is more. For Montaigne's text continues beyond this para- graph upon which we have commented at length; and Montaigne adds to this first response a much more extensive text covering several pages. What we find there is surprising, to say the least: Montaigne legitimates theology by the very absence in which we find ourselves of any contact with God. Only revelation can found and give rise to theology, he says, thus clearly defining the distinct fields of religion and theological knowledge. But here this human, rational approach to the subject of God is made all the more urgent and legitimate by the fact that we no longer seem to be able to actualize revelation: theology lets the very essence of the divine escape, but the faith which would exempt us from it, or which is at least able to found it, 18. We can only recall here how Lucien Febvre (op. cit.), after having meticulously and rigorously refuted the very possibility of an atheist Rabelais, and after having rejected all theories of "the masked author," finally exclaims: "One would have to say, without admiration-contrary to the custom of our contemporaries, who are always delighted to show us, in the "rationalists" of yesterday, so many liars and cowards-one would have to say, not without scorn: "He was a scoundrel." But one would have to add, also: "And a proud imbecile." For he went beyond the goal" (p. 244). It is the same with Montaigne: by attributing so much subtlety or cynicism to him, one denies his very thought in its original effort.</page><page sequence="15">202 Yale French Studies is no longer in us. Our only personal and present access to God is therefore, undoubtedly, this path of reasoning, the reference to the divine word remaining more historical than personal. For this knowledge of God, (a) si elle n'entre chez nous par une infusion extraordinaire; si elle y entre non seulement par discours, mais encore par moyens humains, elle n'y est pas en sa dignitd ny en sa splendeur. Et certes je crain pourtant que nous ne la jouyssions que par cette voye. [441] (a) if it does not enter into us by an extraordinary infusion; if it enters, I will not say only by reason, but by human means of any sort, it is not in us in its dignity or in its splendor. And yet I am afraid that we enjoy it only in this way. [321] Faith is difficult and rare; does it really exist? Are there men, even among Christians, other than those whom Montaigne divides (in a surprisingly Pascalian expression) into two equally inauthentic categories: (c) Les uns font accroire au monde qu'ils croyent ce qu'ils ne croyent pas. Les autres, en plus grand nombre, se le font accroire a eux mesmes, ne scachants pas penetrer que c'est que croire. [442] (c) Some make the world believe that they believe what they do not believe. Others, in greater number, make themselves believe it, being unable to penetrate what it means to believe. [322] Thus theology, Sebond's as much as any other, will open up a whole propaedeutic to faith, not by proving the existence of God or by revealing him, but by showing at least "comment il n'est piece du monde qui desmante son facteur" (447) [how there is no part of the world that belies its maker (326)], and in this way theology will serve "d'acheminement et de premiere guyde a un apprentis pour le mettre a la voye de cette connois- sance" (447); [as a start and a first guide to an apprentice to set him on the road to this knowledge (327)] so that theological arguments at least le faconnent aucunement et rendent capable de la grace de Dieu, par le moyen de laquelle se parfournit et se perfet apres nostre creance. [447] fashion him to some extent and make him capable of the grace of God, by means of which our belief is afterward completed and perfected. [327] Montaigne, far from ridiculing Sebond in these responses to the first objection made against him, shows that this objection itself gets carried away in criticizing theology in the name of the powers of a faith which</page><page sequence="16">CATHERINE DEMURE 203 never appears-and which none of us, Christians, including me, Montaigne, can manifest. And yet, against Sebond, the fact remains that theology is impossible-at least if its object really is God.'9 It is of capital importance to see here how Montaigne evades the tragic conflict to which his paradoxical argumentation seems to lead him: this is because the possibility remains of going around the irreducible opposition between God and man, between faith and reason, between necessary and impossible theology, through action-including the intellectual act which is theology. Only true faith, which I do not have, leads to God. And yet, theology is inevitable, de facto and de jure. Montaigne finds a way out of this double, contradictory affirmation which he maintains: 1. by changing the object of theology, which becomes a simple account of the marks of the divine in the world, and even more modestly, of the marks of the possibility of the divine in the world. From knowledge about God we pass then to a purely human propaedeutic to possible belief; 2. by recalling a faith in Christian revelation which is certainly formal-since it is not acted upon by the subject-but nevertheless real. Faith remains, historical, as an acquisition of humanity, even if each particular man today fails to recapture it and live it. There is, therefore, a displacement between the philosophical-or metaphysical-aporia which we unmasked and the possibility-minimal, hazardous, but real-of bridging this gap between the divine and the human, for our forces are not absolutely null, nor God absolutely hidden: Ce seroit faire tort a la bonte divine, si l'univers ne consentoit a nostre creance. Le ciel, la terre, les elemans, nostre corps et nostre ame, toutes choses y conspirent: il n'est que de trouver le moyen de s'en servir. [447] It would be doing a wrong to divine goodness if the universe did not assent to our belief. The sky, the earth, the elements, our body and our soul, all things conspire in this; we have only to find the way to use them. [326] One of the actualizations of this precarious path in the search for a way out of the theological dilemma is precisely the work of Raymond Sebond. 19. We must note two points here (briefly) in order to state the limits of our recourse to the work of Lucien Febvre already cited: 1) This work, centered on Rabelais, studies above all the first half of the sixteenth century-and therefore encompasses a religious life before the religious wars (in France). 2) L. Febvre-like so many philosophers or historians-seems to be unaware of Montaigne as a philosopher. Which is confirmed by this affirmation that sees little but a void from Rabelais to Descartes: "And it is not chance," he says, "if it is only around 1600 that philosophy counted two important men expressing themselves in French, Du Vair and Charron. True philosophy came afterwards: Ren6 Descartes" (p. 341).</page><page sequence="17">204 Yale French Studies The response to the second objection to Sebond remains to be exam- ined: "Aucuns disent que ses argumens sont foibles et ineptes a verifier ce qu'il veut, et entreprennent de les choquer aysement" (448). ["Some say that his arguments are weak and unfit to prove what he proposes, and undertake to shatter them with ease" (327).] Montaigne does not answer this objection, as much as if to say that he would willingly accept this thesis, and we know moreover that he will be opposed to Sebond's arguments in favor of the powers of reason and human supremacy in the world.20 But this is not the essential point. Montaigne's answer will be a radical argument which to be sure also subverts Sebond's thesis, but which aims first at the dangerous naivete of an objector sure of the powers of his reason. Montaigne's argumentation will in fact constitute the rest of the Essay. The whole "Apology" will now be devoted to the criticism of reason, and this so-called "skeptical" development will hold true for the totality of knowledge-thus justifying the choice of the theme announced by the introduction. We see what form the paradoxical coherence of Montaigne's thought takes here: it does not save the value of Sebond's work; it merely confuses its detractors, who are assimilated to Sebond himself and to all humanity in a common misery (how can we avoid using the Pascalian term here?). But this tactical victory is a strategic rout since it carries Sebond with it. What does it matter? What does it matter if we have read well, if we remember that theology cannot aim at a true knowledge-its object is incommensur- ate with knowledge, and no progress can bring it closer to this object; if we also remember that theology was not so much a theoretical possibility as a practical solution to the conflict between the necessity and the impossibil- ity of a relationship with God? If we understand, finally, that theology is valuable for the practice of humility and the search for God which it initiates, and which can only prepare us to believe? And this is why the skeptical tornado which follows will sweep away real or possible knowl- edge much more than a theology already disproved as theoretical knowl- edge. What does it matter whether or not it is rich or even rigorous, if it can be of use to me-or if it can help anyone to reconcile his abstract belief with Christianity through a real faith? The important thing is for me to live in spite of my powerlessness; life implicates me completely, and not only as the subject of knowledge-as a transcendental consciousness or soul: and this is what this theology-a propaedeutic, good or bad-will be useful for: living. Montaigne affirms indeed that 20. On this point-and, in general, on the relationship between Sebond's text and the reading which Montaigne proposes of it-reference to H. Friedrich's text, chapter 3, paragraph 2, will be useful.</page><page sequence="18">CATHERINE DEMURE 205 nous ne nous contentons point de servir Dieu d'esprit et d'ame; nous luy devons encore et rendons une reverence corporelle; nous appliquons nos membres mesmes et nos mouvements et les choses externes a l'honorer. [441] we do not content ourselves with serving God with mind and soul, we also owe and render him a bodily reverence; we apply even our limbs and movements and external things to honor him. [321]21 So that what is under attack is not so much the result of theology-that of Sebond or any other-as its claim to be a science, testifying as much to the powers of man as to divine nature. This is why we must understand the position of Montaigne, who both accepts and refuses theology, and who, even while ruining Sebond's argumentation, considers it just as convincing as any other: for the question no longer has to do with the content-the argumentation and results-of theology, but only with the need for theol- ogy, which paradoxically stems from a deficiency of faith but derives its value only from its anchoring in faith. From personal-absent-faith to revealed faith-in the form alone of dogma. Thus we can, at least schematically, situate the problematic "religion" of Montaigne and his religious "conservatism": without this real and personal faith, by which "nous remuerions les montaignes de leur place" (442) ["we should move mountains from their place" (322)], our belief does not even attain the level of a "simple belief" (une "simple croyance") such as one grants a "story" ("histoire"); religion is but the never really attained horizon of our acts; only dogma permits us to keep its form and possibility. Let us be conservative, then, but tolerant: we have neither true faith nor the intellectual means of attaining it or ruining it.22 Playing the role of a Catholic here is neither hypocritical nor facile; it is becoming entirely accustomed to the possibility of encountering personal faith; theology, on the condition that it remains in conformity with dogma, is an element like any other of this preparation of the self for God; all the same, it must know its limits. 21. "Learn from those who have been bound like you," Pascal will say. "Follow the way in which they began: it is by doing everything as if they believed, by taking holy water, by having masses said, etc. Naturally even that will make you believe and will make you stupid" Brunschvicg, fragment 233). 22. The "we" here refers to an experience which obviously goes beyond Montaigne's, and which renders it exemplary: to escape this collective which includes me in a community where :onservatism is a means and tolerance an obligation, I would have either to argue my real faith- and for what purpose, since our actions then "auroient quelque chose de miraculeux comme aostre croyance" (442); ["would have something miraculous about them like our belief" (332)] )r prove that reason can attain everything and understand everything, in me and outside of me: which the rest of the "Apology" explicitly refutes.</page><page sequence="19">206 Yale French Studies IV. THE PARADOX AND THE MIRACLE This reading of the first pages of the text of the "Apology for Raymond Sebond" has allowed us to bring out a paradoxical structure, that is, a form accounting for a signification which cannot be reduced to either one of the opposing terms constituting it. We have shown that this structure also governs the conclusion of the essay-thus giving shape to a homogeneous and coherent text through the additions of the manuscript. We shall not return to the quotation from Seneca or to the commentary which Mon- taigne makes on it, "utile desir, mais pareillement absurde" ("useful desire, but equally absurd") which now allow us to encompass in a concise form, the very movement of the text. [Let it suffice to point out that Montaigne's so-called disorderly writing demonstrates here a masterful-and durable- organization of free reflection: there is nothing more satisfying, on the level of esthetics as well as on the level of meaning, than this conclusion which offers, in the form of a maxim, the model of the whole preceding argumenta- tion and which strengthens the expression both of the contradictions justifying the opening's reservations-to "love," not "worship" knowledge-and of the particular paradox at the very heart of the text: necessary and impossible theology. Neither our personal faith nor the powers of reason enable us to go beyond humanity: Car (a) de faire la poign6e plus grande que le poing, la brass6e plus grande que le bras, et d'esperer enjamber plus que de l'estandue de nos jambes, cela est impossible et monstrueux. Ny que l'homme se monte au dessus de soy et de l'humanit6. [604] For (a) to make the handful bigger than the hand, the armful bigger than the arm, and to hope to straddle more than the reach of our legs, is impossible and unnatural. Nor can man raise himself above himself and humanity. [457] But we can seek to rejoin the impossible, the living God who must ground revealed texts, so that the paradox moves towards a transcendence: I cannot raise myself above the human condition, either by my faith or by my reason. And yet the whole meaning of the text refers back to this desire which is unrealizable except through the miraculous intervention of God: man s'eslevera si Dieu lui preste extraordinairement la main; il s'eslevera, abandonnant et renoncant a ses propres moyens, et se laissant hausser et soubslever par les moyens purement celestes. [604] will rise, if God by exception lends him a hand; he will rise by abandoning and renouncing his own means, and letting himself be raised and uplifted by purely celestial means. [457]</page><page sequence="20">CATHERINE DEMURE 207 Man is not himself the subject of the transcendence, but is acted upon by God. The paradox is due to the personal and collective displacement between the particular and the historical which traverses this "form" of the human condition from one end to the other, causing man to hope beyond his human possibilities; and therein, for Montaigne, lie man's fragile humanity and his emergence-purely potential-out of nature and animality. Dogma renders such a transcendence, if not comprehensible, at least expressible. The illusion lies in believing that it is humanly or even intellectually realizable. Against Seneca-but also against all theology which believes it is speaking of God-and against all rationalism which would mask our immersion in nature and its multiple orders, Montaigne, to conclude, appeals therefore "a nostre foy chretienne" ("to our Christian faith") for this true "metamorphose" ("metamorphosis") which he de- scribes as "divine" and "miraculeuse" ("divine" and "miraculous") in order to show fully that we are perhaps its beneficiaries, but under no circum- stances its origin or author. Only a miracle, then, permits us to get out of the paradox. Only dogma affirms-and founds-the irruption of the miracle in the order of nature. So that the very situation of paradox is paradoxical, which is to say, human: necessary and impossible for man and for him alone, theology becomes possible and useless if he surpasses himself, if God frees him from his contradictions and his limits723 which "la foy chrestienne" ("Christian faith") allows us to hope (and maybe even forces us to hope).24 Translated by Dianne Sears 23. We know the position Montaigne takes on the question of miracles (cf. especially Essays III:2, "Of repentance") and the works of Pascal: "Montaigne against miracles. Montaigne for miracles" (Brunschvicg, fragment 814). We should not be surprised by this convergence, but invest it with all its meaning. H. Friedrich (op. cit., p. 151) points out this convergence but makes it problematic by including Montaigne's position under the sole rubric of skepticism: "Skeptical, Montaigne knocks down the wall of illusory certitudes from both sides and opens the vast horizon of possibility." In fact, Pascal would not have approved of this any more than Montaigne even if he did find Montaigne "skeptical" (and in fact, he is not skeptical, but paradoxical, both for and against)-the only legitimate attitude according to Pascal, who writes (Brunschvicg, fragment 813): "How I hate those who pretend to doubt miracles! Montaigne talks about it in the right way, in both places" (probably I:27 and III:2). One can obviously add to these references the conclusion of "The Apology for Reymond Sebond": "On voit, en Pun [endroit] combien il est prudent; et neanmoins, il croit en l'autre lendroit], et se moque des incredules" (Pascal, Les Pens6es, ed. Brunschvicg, fragment 813) ["We see how careful he is in one place, and yet in the other he believes and makes fun of unbelievers."] 24. H. Friedrich, in the chapter which he devotes to the study of the "Apology" ("Man humiliated") is perfectly attentive to the very nuances and contradictions of Montaigne's text; but he greatly attenuates their paradoxical character. For Friedrich both questions the seriousness of the object of the text-namely the meaning and scope of the theological enterprise: "Dealing with Christianity ... he uses it in order to reject it later" (p. 108) and refuses</page><page sequence="21">208 Yale French Studies to give full weight to the tension revealed by the conflict between the privilege of human reason and the derision of its acquirements. Rather close to Pouilloux on this point, he affirms (p. 138) that Montaigne gives up the idea of progress in the search for truth, contenting himself with inducing contradictions of reason from the contradictory nature of reason. This is to forget-at least-this text of Montaigne in which first appear the idea that obscurity and ignorance are not uniform and identical for everyone, always, and secondly, the idea of possible progress, if not in knowledge, at least in the formulation of problems: "ce qui estoit incogneu a un siecle, le siecle suyvant lPa esclaircy. . ." etc. (560) ["what was unknown to one century the following century has made clear. . .", etc. (421).J</page></plain_text>
