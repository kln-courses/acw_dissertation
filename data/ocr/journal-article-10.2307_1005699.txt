Miss Flora Diebert, Reference Librarian at the Main Library, University of Pennsylvania, helped with valu- able suggestions. Their assistance is deeply appre- ciated. Drs. Froelich Rainey and Louis Giddings always found time to discuss at length the various problems associated with the many intricate aspects of Arctic archaeology. I have profited greatly from their knowl- edge and experience. To Dr. Loren G. Eiseley, Chairman, Department of Anthropology, go my sincere thanks for securing a grant-in-aid which enabled me to gain field experience in the Bering Sea area and better comprehension of Arctic problems in general. Many members of the scientific staff of the University Museum have given time and thought to the inevitable details which are inherent to work of this nature. Their assistance has facilitated my task and saved me many hours of precious time. I express my deep gratitude for their freely-given help. H. N.

This work will attempt to show that remains from these regions fit into the pattern of a complex cultural interplay with the regions sur- rounding them-China, Central Asia, Eastern Europe, and even distant Western Europe and North America. In the past twenty years much archaeological work was done in Eastern Siberia. More of it was concerned with the Paleolithic and Bronze Age periods than with the Neolithic. Still, finds and analyses of the former clarified some phases of the heretofore elusive Neolithic period of Siberia. Alas, with the exception of a few extracts or statements, dealing perhaps with only a specific site or item, the results of these works remained unavailable to the Western student. It is the purpose of this survey to present, in concise form, the major archaeological findings of Soviet investigators which concern the Neolithic period of Eastern Siberia, and to point out-in a quite preliminary way-some of the problems that these findings create in the present archaeological picture in northern North America. This is by no means a complete archaeological survey of the region loosely known as "Siberia." It deals only with that administrative territory which is known as "Eastern Siberia," the area of which will be de- limited later. It does not include the more complex archaeological picture of Western Siberia or of the territory to the east of Eastern Siberia-the Soviet Far East. It is hoped that some day the important literature dealing with these regions, particularly the Soviet Far East, will be surveyed, so that a miiore com- plete picture may be gained for the purposes of com- parisons with the North American situation. Before surveying publications of work done in the several subdivisions of Eastern Siberia, let us establish a geographic terminology which will be used in this report. The traditional division of Siberia into Western, Cen- tral, Eastern, and Southern parts is not used in this report, since the new political-administrative division now in effect reflects in the reports of Soviet investi- gators. The present political-administrative division separates Siberia into three parts: Western Siberia- longitudinally between the Ural Mountains and the Yenisei River, latitudinally between Kazakhstan and the Arctic Coast; Eastern Siberia-east of the Yenisei River to the watershed between the Pacific and Arctic Oceans, and from the Mongolian Republic to the Arctic Coast; the Soviet Far East-the entire Pacific littoral of the Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic, limited to the west by the Stanovoi, Dzhungzhur, Kolyma, and associated ranges (map 1). In order to avoid the use of long descriptive terms which sometimes arise out of literal translation,1 some direct transliterations from the Russian will be used. Thus, within the Lake Baikal region, the term "Pri- baikal" indicates the area immediately west of the lake, the term "Zabaikal" the area immediately east of it. The term "Lake Baikal region," for the purposes of this survey, should be understood to cover the follow- ing areas: The Angara River drainage between Irkutsk and Bratsk (an air distance of some 500 kilometers), the shores and islands of Lake Baikal, the upper part of the Lena River Valley between its source and Kirensk (again a distance of some 500 kilometers), and the lower valley of the Selenga River in the Zabaikal (map 2). A. P. Okladnikov's name looms large in the Neolithic studies of Eastern Siberia. Some idea of his import- ance in this particular aspect may be gained by exam- ining the titles in such major archaeological periodicals as Kratkie soobshcheniya I.I.M.K., Sovetskaya ar- 1 For instance, "Priuralye"-the "Lands at the Ural Moun- tains," i.e., west of the Ural range, or "Zauralye"-the "Lands beyond the Ural Range," i.e. east of the Urals. 5</page><page sequence="5">6 MICHAEL: NEOLITHIC AGE IN EASTERN SIBERIA [TRANS.

For instance, in the Systemtic Index of Publications 2 for numbers 1-50 of the Kratkie soobshcheniya, we find that twelve of fourteen titles entered under "The Neolithic and Bronze Ages of Eastern Siberia" are Okladnikov's. A similar ratio is seen in the post-World War II issues of the peri- odical Sovetskaya arkheologiya. In the thirty-one volumes of the Materialy . . . now at hand, the only volume which deals with the Neolithic of Eastern Siberia is Okladnikov's. In addition he has published several books, both under the sponsorship of the U.S.S.R. Academy of Sciences, and with Irkutsk and Yakutsk State publishing houses. All in all, I think it is safe to estimate that in post-war years Okladnikov and members of his archaeological expeditions authored approximately ninety per cent of the articles and books dealing with the Neolithic Age in Eastern Siberia. This one-sidedness of authorship may have certain disadvantages as it presents, by and large, one man's opinions. However, this is offset, at least in one of the major regions under consideration, the Lake Baikal region, by the existence of works of others which relate to neighboring territories and with which comparisons are possible. The works of Kiselev on Western Siberia and Gryaznov on the Altai region are notable examples. 2Kratkie soobshcheniya I.I.M.K. 50: 193-225, 1953.</page><page sequence="6">VOL. 48, PT. 2, 1958] THE LAKE BAIKAL REGION 7 A re-evaluation of the Lake Baikal finds was long overdue. The conclusions of previous investigators were for the most part contradictory or too incomplete or generalized to be of much value. Okladnikov did not depend entirely on old excavations or descriptions of them, but did original excavating of his own. Thus, two-thirds of the Lake Baikal material presented here is based on Okladnikov's own work. In the Lower and Middle Lena Valleys, as well as on the Arctic Coast-with the sole exception of Sverdrup's early sur- face finds on Four Columns Island-all of the archaeo- logical field work was done by Okladnikov. In the case of the type-site for the Middle Lena region- Kullata-geological, botanical, zoological, and physical- anthropological addenda were written by specialists who accompanied Okladnikov, or used materials that he excavated. Up to the time of Okladnikov's investigations only two major periods were discerned by most students of the Lake Baikal archaeological materials. At this point we may loosely label them "Neolithic" and "Metal Age" periods. Through additional field work and re-examination of materials collected by earlier investigators, Okladnikov was able to effect refinements in this crude classification of the Baikal Neolithic. Some of his major conclusions may be indicated now: 1. The burial mounds are the only valid media through which the problems of chronology may be approached. The habitation sites are too few and scattered to form a solid base upon which the chrono- logical and general historical values of the Baikal Neolithic could be judged. 2. Most finds-in all of the regions of Eastern Si- beria which are dealt with here-belong to the late stages of the Neolithic and to the Eneolithic. 3. The late stages of the Baikal Neolithic can be divided, on stratigraphic and typological evidence, into three separate phases: the Isakovo, Serovo, and Kitoi. 4. The Eneolithic period which follows the Kitoi can be separated into an early Eneolithic culture, the Glazkovo, followed by a more definite transitional Eneolithic-Bronze Age culture, the Shivera. 5. Although few undisturbed Mesolithic sites are known in the Lake Baikal region, we may suspect that at least two, Khina and Chastye, represent the transi- tional period between the terminal Paleolithic and the "fully" developed Neolithic. 6. The Baikal Neolithic has a firm and documentable basis in a local, autochthonous Upper Paleolithic cul- ture which is represented by the Mal'ta and Buret' sites in the Angara Valley. After establishing a Neolithic base for the Lake Baikal region, Okladnikov continued his archaeological researches in regions hitherto untouched by the inquir- ing spade of the archaeologist, the Middle and Lower Lena Valleys and several localities on the Arctic Coast of Eastern Siberia. In these regions he recognized several typological analogues to the Lake Baikal Ne- olithic but also many local variants. It is of extreme interest to us that one of these variants is expressed in a differentiated type of burin. Others are expressed in scrapers, arrowheads, and so on. Although Okladnikov vigorously objects to whole- sale transfers of populations with their respective types of cultures-this in the case of the Neolithic populations of the Lake Baikal and Lena regions-he does hold that the Arctic Coast, both to the west and east of the Lena delta, was settled by peoples arriving through the natural "channel" of the Lena basin rather than di- rectly from the west, i.e. through Arctic Western Siberia (Chapter XIV). The reader may note seeming inconsistencies in con- nection with transliteration of place names in the Soviet Union. Some are not inconsistencies at all but simply relate to ordered changes in linguistic suffixes. As a community develops from a small one to a progressively larger one, the suffix (if there is one) may change to indicate this progression. For instance, a small com- munity may carry the name of Bratskaya. The name is actually incomplete, but the feminine suffix skaya denotes that it should be associated with derevnya (village) which is of feminine gender. As the com- munity grows in size its name may be changed to Bratskoye (Bratskoe), the neuter ending skoye (skoe) denoting that it should be associated with selo (large village) which is neuter in gender. A final change to Bratskii, or Bratsk, would denote by its male suffix skii (skiy) that it should be connected to gorod (town, city) which is of male gender. Thus, progressively: Bratskaya derevnya, Bratskoye selo, Bratsk(ii) gorod. Of course, there are variants in these suffixes but the gender can be recognized without trouble. The other inconsistencies are real and are tied to various political and economic developments. Gen- eralizations which would account for all changes of this type cannot be readily made and most cases would have to be treated individually. I. THE LAKE BAIKAL REGION: PAST CLASSIFICATIONS The first records of archaeological finds in the Lake Baikal region-finds which today would be classified as Neolithic-came out of a series of investigations initiated by Peter the Great. They were described accurately and attempts were made to explain their origin from a cultural-historical point of view (Strah- lenberg, 1730). In the long period between the travels of Strahlen- berg and the beginning of the twentieth century, a number of historians and "naturalists" speculated about the original dwellers of the Baikal sites who left these remains. However, it was not until 1904 that the first</page><page sequence="7">8 MICHAEL: NEOLITHIC AGE IN EASTERN SIBERIA [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. attempt was made to classify on the basis of then acceptable archaeological technique. Before the past classifications of the Baikal region remains are reviewed, some of the bases on which classifications may be attempted will be discussed. In the Japanese islands the principal support for the classification of Neolithic finds are beach lines formed by coastal fluctuations, i.e., coastal emergence and sub- mergence, and fluctuations in the sea level. Thus, geomorphology enters importantly into the classifica- tions. Geomorphological phenomena such as those found in Japan and also on the Baltic Coast are not discernible in the Baikal region, although we will see that other geomorphological expressions, coupled with the findings of paleozoology, do play an important role in the periodization of the Siberian Paleolithic. In the Angara Valley the only geological factor that comes into play is the relationship of the Neolithic sites to the 4-meter terrace and, in many cases, the relation- ship of Eneolithic sites to the 2-meter terrace in both the Angara and Lena Valleys (Tyumentsev, 1941: 40). Okladnikov states that pollen analysis is not possible in the Baikal region, "since there is little or no pre- served pollen East of the Ural Mountains" in valid association with archaeological sites (Okladnikov, 1950: 53). Thus far, no varve-counting methods have been developed for Siberia. Nor are there any indications in any of the archaeological literature presently in the hands of the writer that Soviet scientists had con- sidered the Carbon-14 method. Thus, when a more detailed classification of East Siberian Neolithic cul- tures is attempted, a purely archaeological method-a cultural-stratigraphical one-must be used. Further- more, because of poorly executed or described excava- tions of many of the habitation sites in the Baikal region-some unpublished-the only reliable means of dating are the burial sites. These in some respects are superior to the habitation sites because they contain the best and often the most complete artifacts of the region. They also tell, in a fragmentary way, of social organization, ritual, and beliefs. Okladnikov's scheme of chronological classification on the basis of burials has its precedent in the well- known and much revised scheme of Montelius who grounded it on the investigation of burial mounds in southern Scandinavia. More recently another chrono- logical sequence based on burial mounds has been worked out for the Bronze Age of Eastern Europe by Gorodtsov (Gorodtsov, 1907; Gorodtsov, 1915: 219, 223). The Early Metal Age classification for the Minusinsk region is still another such instance and of special interest to us, since this region is culturally associated with steppes in the south of Siberia which in turn are contiguous with the Lake Baikal region (Kiselev, 1928). As mentioned earlier, it was as late as 1904 that the first classification of the Angara Valley mounds was developed. The originator of the classification was Ovchinnikov. Those burials which contained in addi- tion to stone artifacts also metal ones and objects of white nephrite he labeled the "Irkutsk" culture. Those that had no traces of metal he assigned to the "Kitoi" culture (Ovchinnikov, 1904: 68-73). Gorodtsov replaced Ovchinnikov's "Irtutsk" culture with the term "Glazkovo." 1 To him the Glazkovo culture was characterized by the presence of metal and stone artifacts as well as those manufactured from "bone paste" and nephrite. The "Kitoi" burials con- tained round bottomed vessels, "sandstone casting forms," polished nephrite axes, and remarkable bone daggers with stone side-blades (Gorodtsov, 1927). Later, in 1935, Gorodtsov changed his opinions on the subject without explanation. As this refers more to the absolute chronology of the Baikal sites, it will be discussed later in that specific connection (Chapter VII). The physical anthropologist Debets, although mainly interested in the skeletal material, proposed a three- period division of the burials: (1) Ochred, extended burials without copper artifacts (e.g. Kitoi, Rasputino, and Tsiklodrom mounds); (2) Extended burials with- out ochre or copper (Khaptsagai); (3) Flexed burials without ochre and occasionally with copper obj ects (Glazkovo mound). Debets is not specific when it comes to establishing a chronology. He only suggests that all three groups belong to the Late Neolithic and that the Glazkovo site is Eneolithic (Debets, 1930: 7-10). In 1929 Konstantinov also evolved a three-phase division, basing it, however, differently from Debets, "on the extinction of the bone and stone industries" and on the presence of copper oxides and, later, of copper artifacts (Konstantinov, 1928: 83-94). He named a new phase, which he placed between the Kitoi and Glazkovo, the "Lishikinsk," after the mound which he excavated in the vicinity of Irkutsk in 1927-1928. Konstantinov's characterizations of the three periods, based on the contents of the graves, may be summarized as follows: The Kitoi. 1. Skeletons rubbed with red ochre, 2. Absence of copper or bronze artifacts or of their traces, 3. Absence of structures (grave linings or cham- bers) either in or atop the mounds, 4. Skeletons extended, arms along body, oriented (i.e. head pointing) to the southwest or some- times to the northeast. Presence of double burials, 5. Unusually rich assortment of bone imiiplements, 1 Glazkovo is a suburb of Irkutsk where most of the early finds were uncovered.</page><page sequence="8">VOL. 48, PT. 2, 1958] BASIS FOR A CHRONOLOGICAL ANALYSIS 9 6.

Stone artifacts revealing high technical pro- ficiency, 8. Parts of skeletons covered with flint flakes, 9. Presence of round-bottomed clay vessels, 10. Conical heaps of stone accompanying burials. Despite these classifications, in 1930, the problems of the periodization and chronology of the Angara Valley mounds remained unsolved. It was quite evident that some of these classifications were mutually contradic- tory and that they were based on incomplete and scattered materials. II. THE BASIS FOR A CHRONOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF THE SIBERIAN NEOLITHIC The number of burials found in the upper part of the Angara River Valley exceeds by far that for the rest of Eastern Siberia. Outside of this valley only a few are reported. To the east of Lake Baikal, i.e. in the Zabaikal, there is the Eneolithic mound near Fofanovo (Okladnikov, 1928: 63-69), the similar Ulan-Ude mound on the lower Berezovka River (Sos- novskii, 1928: 211-215), the fortuitous Neolithic finds near the town of Sretensk and in the Kokui area (Tallgren, 1929: 69, quoting Merhart), and the poorly 2World Aeronautical Chart 200, 4th ed., Feb. 1952, indicates the double name and spelling of "Lisikhe" or "Gerokhovo." documented 1919 find at Tunkin 1 (Podgorbunskii, 1923: 9). To the north and northeast of Lake Baikal, Neolithic burials are found in greater numbers only in the upper part of the Lena Valley, between Biryulsk and Ust'-Ilgi (Okladnikov, 1928a: 125-134). To the west of the upper Angara Valley there are the surface finds in the village of Chadobets on the Angara (Vitkovskii, 1889: 4, 7), a few burials at Krasnoyarsk on the Yenisei (Savenkov, 1886: 26-105), at Bazaikha on the Afontova Gora (Okladnikov, 1950: 61), and the Perevozinsk site (Peredolskii, 1896: 210-214). Still farther west, beyond the Yenisei River, there are only three sites belonging to this particular Neolithic complex: at Stalinsk (Kuznets), in Bateny, and on the Chudatskaya Cora near Barnaul (Gryaznov, 1930). The sites outside the upper Angara Valley often had been disturbed. They cannot give an adequate picture, they cannot be used to establish a solid base. There- fore, the areally more compact and regionally more contiguous Angara mounds must be used to obtain this base, and the outlying ones only occasionally brought in for purposes of comparison. 1 World Aeronautical Chart 200, 4th ed., Feb. 1952, gives the spelling of "Tunka." ratsk 20 0 20 40 60 60 100 KILOMETERS alagansk Irkutsk MAP 3.

There are sixty-nine mounds with the total of 171 burials in the Angara River Valley between Lake Baikal and the city of Bratsk (map 3). Only those burials which lend themselves to the purposes of clas- sification have been counted. Forty-nine of the mounds were excavated by Okladnikov and his co-workers in the years 1932, 1933, 1934, 1936, and 1937.

Isakovo Since most of these mounds are located on flat land near the river, many must have been obliterated with the agricultural settlement of this valley. The farmers would naturally utilize the level ground. As a rule, the mounds are located some fifteen to twenty meters above the mean level of the river, rarely as high as forty or fifty meters (Ushkanka, Tsiklo- drom). In differentiation from the burial mounds, the habitation sites are usually located on a lower terrace, six to fifteen meters above the river. At times the settlement is located on the same terrace as the mound, as is, for instance, Lenkovka. There are three major clusters of Neolithic sites in the Upper Angara Valley (map 3). Generally speak- ing, they reveal the following characteristics of loca- tion: (a) a local westerly course of the river, which protects the sites from the severe northerly winds, (b) proximity of a large tributary of the Angara, (c) presence of elevated floodplains, i.e. terracing, and (d) proximity to rapids (Okladnikov, 1950: 64). The areas between the major clusters, that is the "Ne- olithically deserted" areas, are often occupied by Iron Age sites. Upper Paleolithic sites are also found on the Upper Angara River. III. A BRIEF CHARACTERIZATION OF THE THREE MAJOR TYPES OF BURIALS IN THE ANGARA VALLEY A comparative analysis of the materials from the qualitatively selected mounds reveals three particular and fully independent complexes with conforming types of interments. The particularity of these complexes also enables a chronological division into phases. THE GLAZKOVO PHASE Nineteen sites, in which metal remains (copper and bronze) were founld, form the nucleus which char-</page><page sequence="10">VOL. 48, PT. 2, 1958] BURIALS IN THE ANGARA VALLEY 11 acterizes the Glazkovo phase. In addition to metal artifacts, the following objects were characteristically found in association: (a) ornamental rings of white nephrite (six instances), (b) mother-of-pearl perforated discs (eleven instances), (c) bone or stone cask-shaped shanks of composite fish-hooks (five instances), (d) highly polished flat discs of marble (four instances). Okladnikov terms this phase "Eneolithic," although he cautions that the term "Eneolithic" is not used in this case in the sense of "Chalcolithic"; it does not imply the Copper Age in the narrow meaning of the term, but that period of time during which, in the Pribaikal, for the manufacture of the simpler forms of ornaments or tools, for the first time, copper and bronze begin to be more widely used (Okladnikov, 1950: 72, footnote). The non-metallic artifacts mentioned above were found, either singly or as a part of the complex cited for the Glazkovo burials,1 in twenty-eight additional graves, bringing the total used for the characterization of Glazkovo phase to forty-seven. The Lenkovka mound, one of the richest in the Angara Valley, represents a cross-section of both the metal and non-metal inventory of Glazkovo burials: In this mound the metal artifacts included: (a) bronze fish-hooks--complete and fragmentary-tetrahedral in cross-section, with dentated edges and grooves for fastening the line, (b) flat, leaf-shaped knives with short handle-hafts, with an antler handle hafted perpendicu- larly to the blade, (c) heavy copper and bronze knife blanks. Such assortments of metal artifacts were also found in several other sites, which, in addition, included such metal objects as (1) thin, flattened copper needles with a very small eye (Igirma and Ryutino), (2) thick, bronze wire bracelets with open ends (Usol'ye and others), (3) a cylindrical tube fashioned from a thin copper plate (Ust'-Ude). In addition to large leaf-shaped spear points with a straight base, the major part of the stone inventory of Lenkovka mound consisted of flint arrowheads and knives. The latter occur both as finished artifacts and as blanks. These knives are almond-shaped, some of them quite "pot-bellied" (i.e. thickened in the center), with sharply asymmetric sides. The same type of knife was found in several other localities (Anosovo burial no. 2, Itsygun burial no. 2, Usol'ye burial no. 1, Buret' III burial no. 1, and others). In two cases this type of stone knife was in association with metal. The flint arrowheads of Lenkovka may be divided into four major types: (1) those in form of isosceles triangles with a straight base, (2) isosceles triangles with a slightly concave base, (3) long and narrow arrowheads with slightly convex sides which end in short barbs on either side of the base, (4) long, narrow points with a straight base. These types of arrowheads 1 "Glazkovo burials" used hereafter in the sense of "burials of the Glazkovo period." The term "Glazkovo" will imply "Glaz- kovo period." are common in numerous burials at other sites, par- ticularly so types (1) and (3). The Lenkovka mound, as well as many others, con- tained a number of heavy flint "punches." 2 In two cases they were directly in association with metal arti- facts. Among the bone objects from Lenkovka, the harpoon points 3 are of particular interest. Here, as well as in other Glazkovo burials, they always were found in pairs and in association with metal artifacts. They vary in size, but whether large or small, they are sturdy in construction, with barbs on either side and "wings" flanging at right angles near the base. There is a special type of bone arrowhead from Lenkovka, duplicated in several other sites (Anosovo, Ust'-Ude, Shivera, Buret' III), which also is associated with the Glazkovo complex. In the central portion of its body it is almond-shaped in cross-section. The base is flattened and thinned by cutting of bone slivers from both sides. To typify the Glazkovo phase further, the inventory may be extended to include large bone shanks of com- posite hooks with perforations for the insertion of barbs (Buret' III, Ponomarovo, Lenkovka), small scrapers with a paraboloid cutting edge, i.e. the blade is "drawn out" to one side (Nokhoi, Ust'-Dolgoi, Svyataya, Pono- marovo), and long, thin, bone dagger blades (Nokhoi, Buret'-Sukhaya II). There are other burials where artifacts were not found in association with metal, mother-of-pearl beads, objects of nephrite, etc., but which nevertheless reveal elements such as the typical stone and bone arrowheads, "paste" beads, and other objects which are usually associated with the Eneolithic Glazkovo phase. They reveal enough of a standard to be classified as Glazkovo, and the classification is underlined by their direct, local association with indubitably Glazkovo type burials with external mound structures typical of the period. With the above in mind it will now be possible to examine the Kitoi type burials and separate them from the Glazkovo. THE KITOI PHASE The most characteristic ritual manifestation of the chronologically early Kitoi burials is the custom of sprinkling the deceased with ochre. Perhaps the most characteristic artifact is the "Kitoi" fish-hook.4 An arti- fact which differentiates the Kitoi from other Neolithic phases is the bone harpoon point with a single perfo- rated wing, or with a perforation along the main axis. Such points were never found in the Glazkovo burials. The polished nephrite knives with a wide, triangular 2 These punches, irregularly rectangular in cross-section, could be better described as piercing instruments rather than true punches. 3 Not to be confused with the detachable toggle harpoon head of the Eskimo. 4 To be described and compared in detail in Chapter V.</page><page sequence="11">12 MICHAEL: NEOLITHIC AGE IN EASTERN SIBERIA [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. point are also strongly characteristic of this phase. Less characteristic but still part of the complex are the pebble "palettes"-flat river pebbles with a "pecked" concavity in their centers, large spades of elk scapulae with the bony ridges cut off, and sharp bone points, circular in cross-section. Some of the latter have a beveled and sharpened base for attachment of a handle, others are widened at the base to provide an "incorporated" handle. To the Kitoi complex just described, belong also artifacts which were found only singly or in small numbers but nevertheless in association with it. Such are the elk antler spearheads, troughed, dagger-like bone blades, bone artifacts ornamented with incised circles with a point in their centers, flattened bone sticks with dentations on one edge ("tally sticks"), bracelets made of thin bone or marble plates, and a bone mouth-piece of a flute. THE SEROVO PHASE If the Glazkovo group of burials could be briefly characterized as the one "with metal objects, mother- of-pearl beads, and artifacts of white nephrite" and the Kitoi group as one "with ochre sprinkled interments and 'Kitoi' fish-hooks," then the Serovo group (preced- ing the Kitoi) could be typified as a complex containing "burials with bows." It is only in this group that the remains of the composite bow-the bow braces-are found. In addition to the bow braces, the Serovo phase has also its characteristic stone and bone work, as well as differentiating ceramics. Of the larger stone artifacts, the polished adzes of slate or nephrite are characteristic. These are regularly geometric in form, rectangular in cross-section. In most of the Serovo burials there also occurred large, thin, and finely retouched laurel-leaf spear points of flint and stemmed, triangular arrowheads. In almost all of the Serovo burials there were found clay vessels or sherds. The predominant form of the vessels was that of an inverted "mitre," i.e. rounded bottom, slightly emphasized belly, slightly constricted neck, and very moderately everted lip. There was also another form of vessel: egg-shaped, with lugs for suspension on one side only. The outer surfaces of these vessels are either smooth or net-impressed. In many cases the net-impressions are smoothed and almost obliterated, so that a close examination is necessary to discern the original pattern. The vessel usually carries ornamentations immediately below the rim. The predominant type consists of comb- impressed points or caterpillar 5 tracks. A horizontal line of small pits or lentil-like convexities is also common. Fairly characteristic of the Serovo period-because of their predominance among the ornamental objects-are 5 Created by the "stab-and-drag" technique, employing a straight-edged or slightly convex-edged implement. the small, perforated, cylindrical shell beads and neck- laces of perforated elk and maral teeth. In the Serovo burials there also occur-in separate cases but still often enough to be considered character- istic-sculptured fish representations, among them two- headed, Janus-like, stone fish. In order to prepare the ground for another prelimi- nary comparison-the meaning of body orientation in the various groups of burials-Okladnikov's further refinement of two of the three major phases just described must be mentioned. Even during the excava- tions it became evident to Okladnikov that Serovo mate- rials lent themselves to classification as "earlier" and "later" (Okladnikov, 1950: 71). He labeled the earlier periods "Khina" and "Isakovo"-in that chronological succession (Okladnikov, 1950: 78). He also separated the terminal phase of the Glazkovo period on account of its emphasized development in metallurgy, and called it the "Shivera" period (Okladnikov, 1950: 76). This relationship will be described in some detail in later chapters as will the relationship of the burials and the relatively few known habitation sites. IV. SIGNIFICANCE OF BODY ORIENTATION IN THE ANGARA VALLEY BURIALS Enough skeletal material is available from the Isakovo, Serovo, and Kitoi Neolithic phases, and also from the Eneolithic Glazkovo with its terminal Shivera phase, to give us a large sample which, when analyzed, reveals certain patterns of directional orientation of the burials. For instance, in the forty-five burials of the Isakovo and Serovo periods which lend themselves to this type of analysis, we find the following orientations: 11 to the east, 19 to the northeast, 4 to the southeast, 3 to the southwest, 5 to the south, 3 to the north. The majority of the orientations is to the east and northeast; to these may be added the four southeastern ones as slight abberations, and the three to the south- west as antithetical. Thus, the only "unusual" ones are the five southern and three northern orientations. In regard to these Okladnikov states that the fluctuations of the orientations in the burials from the principal, i.e. eastern and northeastern directions to lateral ones, should be explained through the time of the burial, i.e. through seasonal changes in the location of sunlrise (Okladnikov, 1950: 82). When the geographical latitude of the site is taken into consideration, this interpretation seems correct. On the basis of these orientations, Okladnikov comes to the conclusion that they represent a general "orienta-</page><page sequence="12">VOL. 48, PT. 2, 1958] BURIALS IN THE ANGARA VALLEY 13 tion to the sun." He assumes, of course, that the presence of antithetical burials does not upset, but sup- ports this deduction. The orientations in the forty-eight Kitoi burials come close to those of the Isakovo and Serovo: 5 to the south, 6 to the north, 7 to the east, 2 to the west, 19 to the northeast, 3 to the northwest, 1 to the southeast, 5 to the southwest. The predominating northeast orientation with its southwest antitheses accounts for twenty-four of the forty-eight Kitoi burials, and when the rest are inter- preted in the same light as the Isakovo and Serovo burials, again a definite "orientation to the sun" seems indicated. The sun orientation of the Neolithic burials stands out even more definitely when compared to the Eneo- lithic Glazkovo and Shivera periods. In fifty-five Glaz- kovo and Shivera burials the following orientations are found: 24 to the northwest, 14 to the north, 8 to the northeast, 2 to the southeast, 6 to the west, 1 to the southwest. As evident from the above, the majority of the Glazkovo burials are oriented to the northwest, north, and northeast. With this the Glazkovo burials are strongly differentiated from all others in the Angara Valley. A glance at the map of the Angara River basin will show a coordination of these orientations with the direction of the flow of the river between Lake Baikal and Bratsk. In the main, the river flows in a northerly direction with a slight westerly trend. Where the river flows directly to the west (Buret', Mamyr, Bratsk), the Glazkovo burials are oriented in conformity with the trend of the river valley. Where the river turns slightly off its overall northerly course, to the northeast (Podostrozhnoe, Igirma), the orientation of the skeletal remains conforms to this. Where the river flows di- rectly to the north (Evseyevo, Semenovo), the remains are oriented accordingly. The idea of "river" orientation for the Eneolithic burials is supported by the distinctive arrangements of burials in those few mounds where both Eneolithic and Neolithic graves were found. For instance, in the Ponomarevo mound no. 2, the typical Serovo burials with bows were oriented at right angles to the river- to the north, and Glazkovo burials were oriented parallel with the axis of the river-to the northwest and west. Or, in the Ida River raion (region) where the Angara flows to the north with a slight deviation to the east, the Serovo burials were oriented at right angles or obliquely to the river, whereas the Glazkovo burials were placed parallel to the stream (Gorodishche mound no. 1). Further support for this "river" orientation were the boat-shaped stone structures in some of the Eneolithic mounds. One of the Shivera mounds also contained a boat-shaped artifact. Okladnikov's table, given below, summarizes some of the points discussed thus far (Okladnikov, 1950: 84): PE R IOD SOTENTATION OF PRESENCE OF OCHRE MODE OF DEPOSITION PRESENCE OF METAI ASocIATED STONE SKELETON ~~~~~~OF SKELETON STRUCTURES Isakovo and Serovo "Sun" Rare; in small heaps Extended; rarely No traces Present; within the with flexed legs mound grave pits Kitoi "Sun" Plentiful; sprinkled Extended; rarely No traces Very rare over remains flexed Glazkovo and Shivera "River" Rare; in small heaps, Extended, sitting, Simple metal arti- Usual, sometimes absent in late phase strongly flexed; facts of copper boat-shaped prone and bronze V. ADDITIONAL CHARACTERISTICS AND THE CHRONOLOGICAL SEQUENCE OF THE ANGARA BURIALS Up to this point only those characteristics which differentiated the various Neolithic and Eneolithic periods in the Angara Valley were mentioned. But there are also characteristics in which some of the periods agree, showing clearly that the burials of the Isakovo, Serovo, and Kitoi phases belong-in tradi- tional archaeological periodization-to one lengthy Ne- olithic period. At this time we will only state in a general way that in all of these phases of the Baikal Neolithic there are objects of polished stone, ceramics, triangular arrowheads with a concave base, perforated deer teeth serving as necklace beads, bear tusk orna- ments, and several others. The details of this continuum will become evident in subsequent chapters.</page><page sequence="13">14 MICHAEL: NEOLITHIC AGE IN EASTERN SIBERIA [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. In analyzing the reasons for differentiation among the various Neolithic periods in the Angara Valley, Okladnikov rejects "geographic" and "socio-religious" theories. The geographic theory would propose effec- tive geographic isolation as the reason for each phase to develop in its own way. This could be true only if very great distances separated the various cultural com- plexes. However, when the groups of sites possessing the differentiating characteristics are plotted on separate maps and then the maps compared, it is readily seen that they show no locally isolated groups. The Glazkovo type of burial is disseminated throughout the length of the valley, from above Irkutsk to Bratsk. The Kitoi mounds spread from the vicinity of Irkutsk to far below Balagansk, that is some 400 kilometers below Irkutsk. The Serovo graves are distributed between Irkutsk and Bratsk. Even though there are not many Isakovo burials, they are found in widely separated places-near Irkutsk and at two points near Bratsk (Okladnikov, 1950: 85-86). The socio-religious theory, while acknowledging the geographic proximity of the different types of burials, implies that their particularities are connected to certain social causes. For instance, only leaders or "shamans" could be buried with the "Kitoi" ritual, the "Serovo" ritual being applied to the commoner, or vice versa. Another proposition of this theory would postulate separate types of rituals for men and women. The socio-religious theory is readily repudiated. Dif- ferences in sex and age did not play an important role. In all phases of the Baikal Neolithic, men and women, adults and children, were buried with the same ritual and type of inventory particular for the given phase. For instance, in the female burial at Ushkanka there were found in addition to vessels and a bone needle also an adze, arrowheads, and spear points. In a num- ber of Serovo burials there were bows, and in the male burials, pottery vessels, and so on (Okladnikov, 1950: 86). In those rare cases of some of the Kitoi and Glazkovo burials where some divergencies seem to exist, they do not, in final analysis, exceed or alter the general picture for a particular complex.1 True, there are in all phases "rich" and "poor" burials (as judged by the grave furniture), but the underlying basis-in types of objects-remains the same for all. In the case of the Baikal Neolithic burials it cannot be presumed that the grave furniture was specifically made for the interment. It is utilitarian, nay, shows evidence of use and does not attach to any religious 1 Vitkovskii's statement is referred to here: Vitkovskii re- ported a paired burial from the Kitoi mound in which the female was placed antithetically to the male. He proposed that this implied social inequality (Vitkovskii, 1889: 4, 7). However, Okladnikov thinks this no ground for such an implication: It is the only case reported and it loses significance in a statistical comparison. Also, despite the antithetical positions, the axis of the grave remains oriented in the same direction-from north- east to southwest. "moment." This is well documented, to cite one in- stance, by the composite Kitoi fish-hooks found in the habitation sites and the burial sites. They are the same in both instances (Okladnikov, 1950: 87-88). If it is admitted that the Angara Valley sites are not differentiated on the bases of geographic or socio-re- ligious factors, then the only way to account for the differences which these groups of sites show is to assign them to chronologically separate periods of time with sequential changes occurring within the same territory. But what is this sequence ? This is not as easy to answer as it would appear at first. Only a few chrono- logical studies based on mounds have been done. Within the territory of the Soviet Union perhaps the outstand- ing study is that done by Efimenko. He examined the numerous Iron Age agricultural-herding communities in the Oka River basin.2 In these hundreds of mounds it is easy to spot the changes through generations of artifacts "left in the soil of the villages." Changes in material culture and ceremony may be reliably fixed thanks to the possibility of correlating them with de- velopments in neighboring territories which in turn are more exactly datable (Efimenko, 1937: 49-51). In the case of the Angara Valley mounds, however, there are no artifacts which would allow the fixing of an absolute chronology . . . on the same basis. The simple bone and stone inventory is similar in both cases . . . but here, in the Angara Valley, there are no monies, no complex metal ornaments tied in with this or that generation as an ex- pression of fashion, et al. We have to work with a situation, in the taiga of eastern Siberia, where even in relatively recent times communities engaged in fishing and hunting were sparsely distributed and at the same time they were temporary, seasonal, with very few inhabitants. It is no wonder . . . that the early inhabitants did not leave any large mounds . . . like on the Oka . . . and thus, statistical, quantitative methods which could measure change are not to be readily employed (Okladnikov, 1950: 88). However, there is evidence that changes although slow in pace, did occur in the Angara Valley. For instance, the Kitoi and Ponomarevo mounds, through their stratigraphy, imply the lapse of a long period of time; yet, there is no evidence of change in grave fur- nishings or interment ritual from the deepest to the topmost layers. This does not mean that a detailed solu- tion of the chronology is impossible. Further use of the materials will show that sequential changes did occur throughout the valley and that these carry as much historical import as did the changes in the more extensively studied neighboring regions of Minusinsk and Altai. Wheni, in further pursuance of the chronological sequence, the materials of the Kitoi and Serovo groups are compared with those of the Glazkovo, they reveal a closer general relationship between the Kitoi and the Glazkovo than between the Serovo and the Glazkovo. 2 The central part of European Russia.</page><page sequence="14">VOL. 48, PT. 2,1958] BURIALS IN THE ANGARA VALLEY 15 TYPES OF FISH-HOOKS 0 ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ _ Id I I 2--3 Vq 0 C-0 C ! ll,, CD_~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ FIG. 1. 1.

Therefore, the Kitoi materials must be more recent than the Serovo ones. The fish-hooks illustrate this; they occupy a prominent place in the inventory of the Kitoi mounds, while in the Serovo burials composite fish-hooks are unknown and only one single bone fish- hook was uncovered. True, composite fish-hooks are found in Serovo "non-burial" sites, but here they belong to the terminal phase of that period, in time very close to the Kitoi.3 In the Glazkovo graves we already find shanks with holes for insertion of barbs rather than grooves for simple hafting. These shanks, particularly the Early Glazkovo ones, are comparable in form (except for the holes) to the Kitoi shanks. With them are found copper barbs and barrel-shaped "Lenkovka" stone shanks. The latter illustrate the next step in the development of the composite hook-the acquisition of a side-trough into which a special wooden shank, which holds the barb, is fitted. The successive steps in the evolution of this type of fishing tackle clearly reveal that the Kitoi hooks occupy 3 An outstanding example of this is the insular site of Ulan- Khada in Lake Baikal. It will be described in detail in Chapter VI. a strongly individualistic place between the simpler Serovo types and the adequately differentiated Glazkovo fish-hooks (fig. 1). There are other manifestations of closer ties between the Kitoi and the Glazkovo than between the Serovo and Glazkovo. Numerous flint arrowheads with a rounded base were found in the Kitoi and Glazkovo but not in the Serovo. This pattern also holds for other artifacts-stone daggers, oval in cross-section, knives of nephrite with a polished triangular point, small antler picks. The remarkable white marble "bracelets" from the Kitoi burials should also be included. Not a single one was found in the Serovo, but in the Glazkovo they are common. Thus, the Kitoi "bracelets" may be regarded as direct precursors of the Glazkovo ones, where they are made of marble, mother-of-pearl, white nephrite, copper, or bronze; however, in form they remain the same. This development also applies to the Kitoi mother-of-pearl cylindrical, perforated beads and their Glazkovo analogues (Chapter XII). Although the vessels of all three periods are similar- not analogous-in form, the clay mixtures from which they are made agree in the case of the Kitoi and Glazkovo pots only. In the Serovo the clay paste was made differently. This will be discussed later (Chapter XI). Another point of difference between the Serovo on the one hand and the Kitoi and Glazkovo on the other is the type of raw material used for most of the stone artifacts. In the Serovo it is still predominantly flinty slate and chert; in the Kitoi and Glazkovo it is green nephrite. Undoubtedly this is not so because the Serovo people did not know of nephrite deposits, but because they did not possess the technique to work the harder stone with facility. The closer chronological relationship of the Kitoi and Glazkovo than that of the Kitoi and Serovo finds its expression even in the realm of art. In the oldest Kitoi burials, chronologically close to the Serovo ones, needle cases are ornamented with grooves incised around the circumference of the body, near the ends. Even in the Serovo the needle cases are already covered with orna- mentation but this is in the form of simple, irregular cross-hatching or crude chevrons. However, most of the later Kitoi needle cases are of a fine quality and are ornamented with a complex, rhythmically arranged pat- tern in the form of alternating short incisions and circles with dots in their centers. The cases from the Glazkovo burials are ornamented with checkerboard incisions and hachured triangles, that is, they are even more complex than those from the Kitoi. Still another point which supports the relationship under discussion is the arrangement of the grave furni- ture. In the Kitoi and Glazkovo it is most often ar- ranged in a carefully assembled heap, whereas in the Serovo and Isakovo it is spread all around the deceased. By now the chronological sequence Isakovo-Serovo-</page><page sequence="15">SEROVO _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ~~~~~~~~4____ __ I IV.9 KITOI v. GLA.ZKQVO D 0 @ 0 | $ @ I@.~ HI.

Although the development of the Khina group is more difficult to judge because of scarce materials, it can be never- theless said at this point that it has characteristics of its own, particularly in the unusual arrowheads with one retouched asymmetric barb-a very archaic type. This and the accompanying materials in the two Khina burials suggest that it should be chronologically placed before the Isakovo. This will be considered in a later chapter (Chapter VIII).

These preliminary statements on the sequence of the Neolithic and Eneolithic periods, statements which were derived from a survey of the Angara Valley materials, are reinforced by archaeological finds in neighboring territories-the upper part of the Lena Valley from its source to Kirensk, the Lower Selenga Valley east of Lake Baikal, the extreme upper Angara, that is, that part of the river valley between Irkutsk and the shores of Lake Baikal, and finally the lower course of the Angara between the localities of Bratsk and Strelka.4 As we shall see later (Chapters XII, XIII), many of 4 On older maps the stretch of the Angara between Bratsk and its confluence with the Yenisei is often named the "Upper Tunguska River."</page><page sequence="17">18 MICHAEL: NEOLITHIC AGE IN EASTERN SIBERIA [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. the Middle and Lower Lena sites also show character- istics which tie them chronologically to the terminal phases of the Neolithic and to the Eneolithic periods of the Baikal region. VI. CORRELATION OF NEOLITHIC HABITATION AND BURIAL SITES Stratigraphic and typological comparisons of settle- ments and burials are in some cases possible, although not enough material is available in the Baikal region for an extended comparison. Both single-stratum sites, with materials from one period only, and multiple-strata sites covering a long span of time were found in the Angara, Lena, and Ilima Valleys, as well as on the shores of Lake Baikal. The Ulan-Khada site repre- sented a "classical" example of the multilayered site. A. ULAN-KHADA The site of Ulan-Khada was discovered in 1912 and excavated in 1913 (Mikhailov and Petri, 1913; Petri, 1914). It is located on the northwestern shore of Lake Baikal, on a small bay of Cape Ulan-Khada which separates the Mukhor Gulf from the Olkhonsk Gate Strait (Proliv Olkhonskiye Vorota) which in turn leads to the Little Sea (Maloe More) of Lake Baikal (Sos- novskii, 1934: 286-287, pl. II). The bay is surrounded on three sides by high cliffs, protecting it from all but the northerly winds. These strong northerly winds deposited, over the ages, considerable amounts of sand when their force was suddenly cut by the high cliffs surrounding the site. For this reason the sand was deposited in horizontal strata. In this manner, the air- borne sand accumulated to the depth of ten meters. In these sands remains of habitation sites were found. In some places the cultural deposits reached to the depths of four meters. The cultural horizon was almost three meters thick and was covered with a one-meter layer of sterile sand. It was continuous, i.e. not inter- rupted by sterile strata. Altogether eleven separate layers were discernible within the cultural horizon. These were defined by Sosnovskii on the basis of the following criteria: (a) color (dependent on quantity of charcoal and ashes); (b) compactness (dependent on the amount of organic material present) ; (c) amount of wood, gravel, et al. (Sosnovskii, 1933: 210-223). From these eleven layers 4,249 artifacts were re- moved. Their distribution among the layers, from bot- tom to top, was as follows: XI-587 X-673 IX-675 VIII-1112 VII-131 VI-152 V-127 IV-163 III-1 19 II-164 I-296 The assortment of artifacts in the eleventh, lowest layer, was rather poor. Almost half of the artifacts (265) were blades or blade fragments.1 Only fifteen of the blades were retouched into side-blades. Some of these were retouched on one edge only, others on both edges. There was also one side-blade which had its short edge struck off to form a chisel-like edge which overlapped the adjacent blade and thus formed a con- tinuous and more effective cutting edge. This technique of overlapping was confirmed by finds of such blades at other sites, where they were in situ. The materials out of which the Ulan-Khada blades were fashioned were mostly a green, jasper-like slate, and light-yellow chalcedony. There were also twenty-eight core tools of the usual Neolithic type-both prismatic and conical. Of these, the core gravers are of special interest. They were made from small prismatic cores with a carefully formed platform at one end. The other end of the prismatic core was converted into an abruptly descending poilnt by a series of well-aimed blows. At first these core implements were thought to be drills. However, after examining over 100 of these "drills" from the Baikal region, Debets found no evidence of smoothing 2 at the point of the instrument. To the contrary, scorification at the point of the tool indicates that it was used as a graving tool (Debets, 1930: 154). The Ulan-Khada examples confirm this. The second group of gravers consisted of medium- sized tools made from considerably flattened, thinned cores. There were only three flake gravers in this layer. Two of them had graving points fashioned on both edges, the third had only one spall struck off it. These form the third group of gravers. Other stone artifacts found in the eleventh layer in- cluded: a massive punch 3 made from a thick blade; small scrapers (9), one with a concave working edge, the others with convex edges; a grooved pebble sinker; shank blanks for composite fish-hooks; a fragment of a finished shank; a barb belonging to a composite fish- hook. Also in a fragmentary state were a sandstone whetstone and a piece of polished slate belonging to an unidentifiable artifact.4 Numerous very small pieces of graphite were also found in the eleventh layer. 1 Throughout his various works Okladnikov uses the terms "knife-like blade," "lames," "lamellar blade," "lamellate blade." We will adhere to the term "blade," distinguishing whenever necessary or possible between "macro-blade" and "micro-blade." 2 Literally "washing of the grain." 3 As illustrations in later chapters show, these are really piercing instruments which may have been used to "punch" through a tough hide where a bone awl would not do. 4 The significance of this polished fragment will be brought out later in this chapter.</page><page sequence="18">VOL. 48, PT. 2, 1958] CORRELATION OF HABITATION AND BURIAL SITES 19 The tenth layer of Ulan-Khada contained only one regularly flaked conical core, ten small scrapers, a frag- ment of a spear(?) point, a triangular arrowhead of miniature dimensions, a pestle fragment, and fish-hook shanks, both finished and blanks.5 The ceramics of the tenth layer consisted mostly of fragments of net-impressed vessels. Ornamentation, usually immediately below the rim, was comb-stamped. The pattern of the design varied (herring-bone, ob- lique) but for the majority of the vessels it consisted of horizontal, parallel lines. Sometimes these were deep, continuous lines, and, there was also one sherd with an ornament made with a dentated "wheel" (roulette). One detail is characteristic. Often the sherds contain ornamentations made with a diagonally held smooth- edged stamp in a step-like succession, i.e. with the "stab- and-drag" technique. This technique was widely em- ployed in periods later than the Neolithic Serovo and was well represented at Ulan-Khada, starting with the ninth layer. Graphite was also found in the tenth layer. In the way of stone work, the ninth layer contained four side-blades (two of these with their entire sur- faces retouched), three core tools, among them a scraper with an obliquely cut working edge, six gravers (one of them a core graver). Stone awls made of thin blades retouched at the point and sometimes about the middle of the body to provide a finger grip, were also found, as were various types of arrowheads. The latter may be classified as: (1) triangular, with slightly convex sides and a straight base (rarely a slightly concave base); (2) same general form as (1) but with an asymmetrically curved base; (3) same body form as (1) but stemmed; (4) leaf-shaped; (5) rhomboid. In addition, the ninth layer contained small scrapers of the usual form (v.s.), massive "punches," retouched overall, two small spear or dart points, and also one finely retouched knife of asymmetrically triangular form. The fishing inventory was represented by grooved pebble sinkers (3) and slate shanks of composite fish- hooks. The latter were both complete and fragmentary. Notably, a fragment of a stone fish representation was found in this layer (fig. 3). More will be said about the role and meaning of such fish representations in succeeding chapters. In enumerating the stone artifacts from the ninth layer, the finds of two adzes and some stone fragments must be mentioned, since they have supporting signifi- cance for the chronology to be established in subsequent chapters. The larger adze was made of gray flinty slate, the smaller one of nephrite. There were also nephrite fragments with traces of sawing. Pottery sherds were numerous. Many of them be- long to large, thin-walled vessels. The mode of orna- No attempt is made here to account for all of the artifacts from the different layers. Only those which may have signifi- cance in a later analysis of the materials are mentioned. FIG. 3. Fish figurine and fragments from Ulan-Khada, 2/3 size. (After Petri.) mentation is varied: unusually clear impressions of thin-threaded netting as well as net impressions which have been smoothed before firing; impressions of coarsely woven cloth; comb-stamped and punctate im- pressions arranged in patterns; belts of caterpillar track ornamentations made with the "stab-and-drag" tech- nique (fig. 4). Among these sherds are also sonme with applique ornamentations consisting of thin ridges of a triangular cross-section. In the ninth layer there ap- peared for the first time at Ulan-Khada another type of ornamentation-lineal impressions made with a strongly twisted cord. Many of the 1,112 artifacts found in the eighth layer were small fragments. A brief description of some of the more characteristic or significant stone work follows: A bilaterally re- touched side-blade; massive, semilunar knives of quartz and quartzite; a sharp awl with one side retouched,</page><page sequence="19">20 MICHAEL: NEOLITHIC AGE IN EASTERN SIBERIA [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. 4" r~ 2 FIG. 4. Pottery fragments from Ulan-Khada. (After Okladnikov.) giving it the appearance of a pointed knife; scrapers, among them a miniature one of nephrite, almost circular in appearance; spear( ?) points made of large flakes and crudely retouched, causing the cross-section to be quite uneven; arrowheads of three types: (1) triangular stemmed, (2) almond-shaped, (3) triangular with an asymmetric base; fragments of composite fish-hooks; grooved pebble sinkers. The seventh layer contained the usual side-blades and small scrapers, but also large scraper-like tools made of wide quartzite flakes with one side convex and re- touched. The arrowheads are of two major types: triangular with a straight or slightly concave base, and triangular with a short stem. In this layer a fragment of a fish figurine was also found. A small, flat fragment of a nephrite knife and fragmentary artifacts of green nephrite conclude the significant stone pieces. There were many fragments of vessels similar to those described for the earlier layers. Among them was an unusual rim sherd with shallow, schematic in- cisions portraying two snakes separated by crossed lines in a form of an "X" (fig. 5). There was also one complete, pear-shaped vessel covered with comb-strokes. In the sixth layer the stone arrowheads were of the usual types-triangular with stems or with an asym- metric base, and also rhomboid in outline. There were also small scrapers and one graver. The ceramics were, on the whole, conformant to those of the seventh layer. The fifth layer contained arrowheads which were considerably smaller than those of the previous layers. However, they were of the same general forms: stemmed triangular and also one with an asymmetric base. The usual type of small scraper was also present. A care- fully retouched side blade of striated green jasper con- formed in dimensions and form to one found in situ in the groove of a bone dagger from the Podostrozhnoe burial no. 6. Graphite was also found in the fifth layer. The stone inventory of the fourth layer followed, by and large, the pattern of those immediately preceding it: retouched side-blades; sturdy macro-blade "punches"; fragments of slate knives; the usual types of arrow- heads; the small scrapers as well as the large type mentioned for the seventh layer; pebble sinkers. In this layer a fish figurine fragment was also found (fig. 3). One of the more unusual artifacts from this layer was a roulette stamp in the form of a small oval plate of micaceous slate with dentated edges and a centered perforation. No essential changes in pottery shapes were evident, although the various types of ornamenta- tion became more complex and now represent some of the most involved ornamentation among Siberian Ne- olithic vessels. The third layer contained a number of side-blades with finely retouched edges, so fine in fact, that they give the impression of modern fine-toothed saw-blades. There were also pebble sinkers, small scrapers, a comb-stamp for pottery ornamentation, and the usual types of stemmed and non-stemmed arrowheads. No changes in ceramics were discernible. The stone artifacts of the second layer did not differ FIG. 5. Sherd fragment from Ulan-Khada with stylized repre- sentations of snakes, 1? natural size.

This applies to the arrowheads which were unusually well finished with secondary re- touching and also to a miniature scraper of chalcedony, as well as to fragments of polished artifacts of green nephrite. Among the latter was a fragment of a chisel with a cutting edge set diagonally to the handle rather than at the usual right angle. From the first layer fine-toothed side-blades, among them one of semi-lunar form (an end or point side- blade of a composite row of side-blades) identical with a side-blade from Pad' Glubokaya burial no. 2. There were also the small scrapers, among them a miniature one of chalcedony, a large "punch," arrowheads of the usual forms described earlier, spear( ?) points or knives (asymmetrically triangular in form and very similar to those found in many of the Angara burials). Objects of nephrite included a thin-bladed knife fragment, a small ax, and a chisel. Much of the pottery was comb-stroked. The sherds indicate a predominance of thick-walled vessels, gray in color, with carelessly executed ornamentation. In some cases the surfaces of these vessels seem to have been "plucked," a phenomenon seen often in Bronze Age and Early Iron Age sites. On the surface of the deposited sand-both at Ulan- Khada and the neighboring Bukhta Peschanaya ("Sandy Bay") -there were found remnants of recent dwellings: foundations of yurtas such as were used even in the last century by Evenki and Buryat fishermen. This step-by-step description of the Ulan-Khada ma- terials was necessary to bring out the very important point that the materials from this site are not nearly as archaic as they were once supposed to be, that is, they do not represent the entire length of the Neolithic. This point will be emphasized by comparisons, in sub- sequent chapters, with burial inventories. B. THE ANGARA HABITATION SITES Several dozen habitation sites are known in the upper Angara Valley, but only a few have been excavated. All of those that were investigated are in the vicinity of Irkutsk, on the left bank of the Angara near the railroad enbankment. Very few of the findings have been published. Three sites may be mentioned here as being repre- sentative: (a) The habitation site near Smolenshtino village, about ten kilometers west of Irkutsk. It is located on the second terrace of the river Olkha, 10-15 meters above the stream, and occupies the left promontory at the mouth of the river. The cultural horizon, consisting of three layers, reached to the depth of one meter. Below it, river pebbles were found. The upper layer contained non- Neolithic artifacts. In the second and the third layers Neolithic stonework, ceramics, and fire-pits surrounded by large stones, were found. The stone artifacts in- cluded: cores, both conical and half-conical, core gravers (formerly classified as "core drills"), triangular arrow- heads with a deeply concave and sometimes asymmetric base causing one barb to be longer than the other, blades, and small scrapers with a convex working edge. Net-impressed ceramics were not found at this site. The ornamentations consisted mostly of applique bands, comb-strokes, and punctates. (b) The site near the village of Kuzmikha. This is a disturbed site containing both Neolithic and Iron Age artifacts. The artifacts were separated mostly on the basis of typological comparison with other, either purely Neolithic or purely Iron Age, sites. The varied Ne- olithic stone work of this site was represented by: (1) quartzite axes with a semicircular cutting blade, 12-17 cm. in length; (2) small axes of green nephrite with a diagonally cut working edge; (3) discoid hand scrapers; (4) end-scrapers with a convex edge, made both of flat flakes and (lamellar) blades; (5) large, massive scrapers, often made of naturally formed thick pieces of flinty slate, with only the convex working edge being retouched; (6) conical and semi-conical cores; (7) core gravers; (8) bilaterally retouched side-blades; (9) fragments of flat polished knives of green nephrite; (10) arrowheads-with symmetrically concave, asym- metrically concave, or stemmed bases; (11) composite fish-hook shanks of the Kitoi type; (12) centrally grooved polishing stones of rough-grained sandstone (the "casting forms" of Gorodtsov, mentioned earlier) (13) chipped fragments of bloodstone.6 The ceramics were varied: smooth-surfaced, with applique bands running parallel to the rim, pitted, stroked, paddled, finger and nail impressed, net-im- pressed. Altogether, this site reveals as many pottery ornamenting techniques -as any site in the Angara Valley. (c) In connection with his work on the Pad' Chastye burials, Okladnikov found remnants of a Neolithic settlement below Buret' village on the Angara River (Okladnikov, 1950: 105). Most of the artifacts came from a shallow, sand-filled pit: a small flint scraper, (lamellar) knife blades, a shank-plummet of the Kitoi type composite fish-hook, a large conical core. Net- impressed sherds were also found there. The pit con- tained, in addition, numerous roe bones and stone chips. C. THE LENA SETTLEMENTS During his work on the burial sites of the upper Lena Valley, Okladnikov discovered two habitation sites in the vicinity of Biryulsk 7 village. The first, a short distance upstream from Byk Mountain, on the right bank of the river, contained in its lower layer sherds 6 A form of jasper or chalcedony. 7 World Aeronautical Chart 200, 4th ed., February, 1952, gives the spelling of "Biryulka."</page><page sequence="21">22 MICHAEL: NEOLITHIC AGE IN EASTERN SIBERIA [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. with impressions of crudely woven netting, a few pebble sinkers, and a number of elk bones. The second site, near the river cliff "Yar," revealed the following types of artifacts: net-impressed sherds of typical round-bottomed vessels ornamented, in case of the rim sherds, with incised rhomboids and circular pits; (lamellar) knife blades; small scrapers, among them a miniature one of chalcedony; triangular arrow- heads, stemmed or with a symmetrically concave base; finely polished small bone awls; a single chisel. All of the stone artifacts show considerab'le refinement of tech- nique. An oval pit, about one meter in diameter and filled with scattered roe bones and net-impressed sherds, was also found at this site. D. THE ILIM VALLEY SITES In 1926 Khodukin excavated twenty Neolithic sites on the Ilim River.8 All of these sites possessed well- defined cultural layers ranging in thickness from 60 to 120 cm. and containing animal bone remains, bone and stone artifacts (Khodukin, 1928: 114-125). In 1929 Debets visited the Ilim sites, discovered some new ones, and organized systematic excavations of four: Atalansk, Litvinsevsk, Shestakovsk, and Berezovsk9 (Arkhiv. I. I. M. K., 1930). The materials from Shes- takova, a representative site, will be reviewed here. At Shestakova there were two we'll-defined cultural layers, the upper extending from 0.30 meters to 0.65 meters, the lower from 0.65 m. to 1.00 m. Below these the soil was sterile. The lower reaches of the upper layer contained a burial with a cache of thirteen neatly stacked deer scapulae. (There was also another burial, that of a child, outside the site proper, on ground sloping toward the river.) However, of more direct interest were the contents of the lower cultural'layer. The inventory was characteristic of what we have seen at other habitation sites thus far, although it was not rich. Aside from quantities of animal bones, it contained-in the way of stone work-the following: a large adze of blue-gray slate, almost rectangular in appearance, with the long sides being only slightly asymmetric-one convex, one straight; a polished knife with a curved blade; the typ- ical, irregular'ly triangular ("spear point-like") knives; a flint macro-blade with retouching about the flat sides which almost reached to the sharp edges; arrowheads- (a) narrow, made of a partly retouched blade of tri- angular cross-section (fig. 6, top left) ; (b) elongated triangular arrowheads with slightly convex sides and a deeply convex asymmetric base (fig. 6, second and third from left) ; (c) stemmed, with the stem being offset from the body by a sharp, well-defined step. These were retouched to remarkable thinness (fig. 6). 8 A major right bank tributary of the Angara. 9 World Aeronautical Charts 200 and 127, 1952, give the following spellings and double names: Atalan or Rankova, Litvintsevo or Golikova, Shestakova, Bereznikovo. The bone-work inventory of the lower layer included a small paddle with a long, narrow handle, a fragment of an awl ornamented with a checkerboard pattern, and a complete awl similarly ornamented. In both of the layers, net impressed pottery was well represented. Some of the net impressions had been smoothed prior to firing. These have been described earlier in connection with the burials (p. 12). Other ornamentations were the sharply defined circular pits on rim sherds (such as were found with Serovo burial no. 1), the stab-and-drag caterpillar tracks, and the rare rouletted and comb-pressed ornaments. In general, there was little difference between the pottery of the two layers. The bone and antler artifacts of the first layer were notable because of their fine finish and form. Some of the outstanding pieces were: (1) a flat, long arrow- head, convex on the long sides, with a sudden "swell- ing" at the point; its base was wedge-like; (2) a har- poon, flatly ovoid in cross-section, with short, sturdy, alternately placed barbs; (3) a short harpoon with two curved barbs on one side; (4) a small (10 cm.) but thick pickaxe blade; (5) two antler knife handles, simply ornamented, designed to receive thin copper blades (fig. 7). Only one copper object was found-a barb of a com- en,~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Ia FIG. 6. Stone and bone artifacts f rom the Shestakova site, 1/3.

(After Okladnikov.) posite fish-hook. It was located in the uppermost reaches of the first layer. When the inventories of the habitation sites which have been reviewed here are compared with those of the burials, an essential agreement in the stone and bone work, and in the ceramics, is seen. In order to bring out the significance of this, it will be necessary to ex- amine some of the statements made by earlier investi- gators of Ulan-Khada. Prior to 1934 it was thought that the lowest, eleventh layer of Ulan-Khada represented a transition between the Paleolithic and Neolithic periods. It was proposed that it contained materials of a much earlier era than that manifested by the burial sites. In this year it was Merhart who pointed out the necessity of a revision of the chronology and its correlation with the various periods of the Western European Neolithic. Merhart, who examined the Ulan-Khada materials during his sojourn to Russia in the early 1920's, found no types which could be correlated with the Mesolithic or Early Neolithic of the West. According to him, the upper layers of this site contained ceramics which be- longed to a Metal Age. His analysis pointed out the complexity of the problems pertinent to the Bronze Age materials of Siberia when they are found in con- nection with both Neolithic and Iron Age sites. He also expressed regret over the loss of the original manu- script of the excavations 10 and the lack of detailed publications. Nevertheless, on the basis of his examina- tion of the materials, Merhart resolutely disputed any regular periodization in the development of the Baikal Neolithic and postulated an autochthonous emergence of it (Merhart, 1924: 139-148). We bring out Merhart's views at this time, because they are pertinent to Okladnikov's, who had also re- examined the Ulan-Khada materials in detail. He agrees with Merhart that none of the typical artifacts 10 Apparently Okladnikov has since found it. found in the eleventh layer are of such form that they could be correlated with the Maglemose. The only ex- ception could be the side-blades. But if it is recalled that a large quantity of these was found in the Baikal Neolithic sites, then such a comparison must be re- jected. All of the various types of artifacts in the eleventh layer have their counterparts in the higher layers, and these belong typologically to the "Middle" and "Late" Neolithic. Furthermore, the traditional scheme worked out before the time of Merhart would not admit the existence of polished stone at the time of the formation of the eleventh layer. Yet, from this very layer came evidence to the contrary. There is the whetstone, which indicates not only knowledge of bone polishing but also of slate and harder stones. This type of polishing stone is identical with those of the later, fully developed Neolithic phases of the Lake Baikal region. The whole matter is clinched by the find of a fragment of a well-polished artifact in the eleventh layer (p. 18). There are still other indications which deny the con- siderable antiquity once assigned to the lower layers of Ulan-Khada. The three lowest layers of Ulan-Khada may be considered as one cultural "horizon," since their contents are similar. Together they reach the thickness of one meter. They contain artifacts, such as the com- posite fish-hooks and comb-impressed pottery, which are unknown for the early Neolithic complexes of the West and cannot be thought of as parallel to those of the Danish kitchen middens (Maglemose) of the Littorina phase as, for instance, Sosnovskii did (Sosnovskii, 1934: 203). The find, in the ninth layer, of a small polished ax of nephrite with deep, through-like incisions testifies to the knowledge of advanced techniques neces- sary to handle this hard stone. Again, the traditional scheme, when indiscriminately applied to Ulan-Khada, becomes contradictory, since it proposes that techniques enabling the handling of hard stones do not appear until the late Neolithic, and only the two top layers of Ulan- Khada were assigned to that phase. In order to underline his rejection of the chronological scheme developed for Ulan-Khada by the earlier writers, Okladnikov compared the artifacts of this site with those found in the burials of the Angara Valley (Okladnikov, 1950: 110-113). He shows, for instance, that the net impressions of Isakovo pottery were made with crudely woven nets. Net-impressed pottery of this type was also found among the ceramic remains of the Serovo period but only rarely. However, the net-impressed sherds from the lowest Ulan-Khada "horizon," more specifically from the tenth and ninth layers, are quite different from the more ancient Isakovo sherds, and may be typologically correlated only with those of the later phases of the Serovo period as chronologically determined by materials from the burials (Chapter X). The stone inventory of the tenth and ninth layers</page><page sequence="23">24 MICHAEL: NEOLITHIC AGE IN EASTERN SIBERIA [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. also correlates typologically with the Serovo and, in part, with the Kitoi. In this connection, the fish-hook shanks-both straight and curved-are of special sig- nificance. The straight type of shank with deep in- cisions at its ends and a slight semilunar flare at one end, is typical of those from the Kitoi burials (fig. 1). The curved type, usually described in the earlier litera- ture as a barb of a composite fish-hook, also has its correlations with the Kitoi. Most of them, however, are not barbs but massive, curved shanks of soft stone, more definitely curved at the pointed end and provided with a small trough which received the barb proper. The masterfully executed fish-hooks of Ulan-Khada are analogous with the Late Serovo-Early Kitoi hooks found in the grave mounds and thus represent a period of well-developed stone technique, a period which must belong to the Late Neolithic. This correlation is not contraindicated by the finds in the second "cultural horizon" (the eighth and seventh layers, together 55 cm. thick). In this horizon the ceramics remain es- sentially the same, despite the flowering of paddle-stamp ornamentation, the presence of composite ornaments, and even symbolic ones-such as the representations of snakes. Symbolically ornamented pottery, together with complexly carved bone artifacts and roughly ex- ecuted clay figurines, was found, for instance, in the burials of Mezhovka mound. This is a mound with ochre-sprinkled skeletons again typical of the Late Ne- olithic Kitoi period. The stone inventory of the sixth to third layers of Ulan-Khada and in a general way even that of the second and first layers, largely agrees with that of the deeper layers. This includes also the net-impressed pottery: The presence of net-impressed pottery in the upper layers of Ulan-Khada cannot be interpreted as a "re-appearance" of this type, as Sosnovskii supposed. As was pointed out, net impressions appear even on the most archaic types of vessels; further, many of the Serovo vessels show it, and even the single vessel of the Kitoi "grave" period is so ornamented. There is, then, a continuum of this form of ornamentation until the Eneolithic Glazkovo times. Some of the objects from the second and first layers of Ulan-Khada are closely analogous to Glazkovo artifacts: The polished knife of nephrite, arrowheads, semilunar quartzitic and flint knives, and others. Even small fragments of bronze were found. The "plucked" pot- tery-typical of Iron Age sites-was already mentioned (p. 21). However, the Glazkovo-type finds at Ulan- Khada are not numerous or definitive. When the generalized contents of the Angara burials are compared with those of the Shestakova settlement on the Ilim River (pp. 22), an agreement of the objects from the lower layer of Shestakova and those of the Serovo period becomes apparent. The upper part of the first layer at Shestakova and its child burial belong to the Glazkovo period with its typical bone arrowheads, harpoon heads, and thin copper needles. In retrospect we see that the major points about the Lake Baikal Neolithic are derived from the burials rather than from the settlements. It is the former that reveal a more extensive, more complete chronology. It is the burials which serve as the basis for correlation and evaluation of the material complexes of the numer- ically fewer habitation sites. From them we derive the changes in material culture and glean some aspects of the spiritual culture. Objections to dating from contents of graves-on the supposition that the dead were buried in ancient, traditional style with artifacts manufactured especially for the burial, artifacts which do not express the material culture of the settlements-are met by the fact that the artifacts from the burials show, in most cases, definite signs of previous use. The question of terminology unavoidably comes up, once the chronological sequence of the various periods of the Siberian Neolithic has been established. Okladni- kov's views on the vagaries of terminology are sum- marized below: A three-way division ("Early," "Middle," "Late") of the Lake Baikal Neolithic was formed more than a quarter of a century ago. All the chronology was based on the conventional terminology applied to Ulan-Khada by Sosnovskii. Yet, today, after much additional work, many facts point to the inapplicability of such terminol- ogy. The very site which allegedly furnished the mate- rials upon which the chronological terminology was based negates, after careful re-examination, its validity. We know today that the lowest layers of Ulan-Khada cannot be called "Pre-ceramic" Neolithic. The condi- tions for this, as we have seen, simply do not exist. The term "Early Neolithic," as defined in the conven- tional scheme, is also not applicable in this instance. The definition of it is too abstract to be valid. The same goes for the term "Middle Neolithic." Moreover, those phenomena which are supposed to be character- istic of the "Late Neolithic"-nephrite artifacts, the betterment of stone-working techniques, the presence of "microlithic" flint objects-are also found in the "Middle Neolithic" layers of Ulan-Khada. Thus, when applied here, the term "Middle Neolithic" is as much of a fiction as "Early Neolithic." In view of the factors which form the basis for its classification, it would appear that the only acceptable part of the conventional scheme is simply "Neolithic" and nothing else. Or can the old terminology be pre- served by repudiating the correlations which were its basis? In that case it would be necessary to have a new base, a new set of complexes, which would harmonize with the terminology. But this does not exist at Ulan- Khada. Okladnikov further amplified his criticism of the conventional scheme (as it was applied to the Siberian Neolithic) by pointing out that the term "Late Ne- olithic" may inaccurately imply two diverse ideas-(1) the instant at which metal was first used in the Baikal region, (2) all of those time segments which exhibit,</page><page sequence="24">VOL. 48, PT. 2, 1958] CHRONOLOGY: RETROSPECT AND PROPOSITION 25 after consecutive changes, the presence of flint arrow- heads, ceramics, and polished objects in the inventories of their sites. In view of this, it would seem wiser to use in the place of the term "the late Neolithic of the Baikal region" either the more applicable "Glazkovo period (Eneolithic)," or "Developed Neolithic," 11 with each phase of it having its concrete associations as de- veloped supra. Only one or two sites of the Khina and Isakovo pe- riods which do not happen to contain ceramics, arrow- heads, or polished objects, or do not imply any associa- tions with these, may deserve the term "Mesolithic." Thus, concluded Okladnikov, the present investiga- tions throw entirely different light on these problems. The correlation of nephrite with a Metal Age is un- supportable, at least in the great majority of the cases. The materials from the Neolithic burials do not agree with those of the first and second layers of Ulan-Khada only-there is also much conformity of the Angara mound artifacts with those of the earlier layers of Ulan- Khada. Additionally, many of the burial mound finds are much "deeper," older than the eleventh layer of that site, a layer which was once labeled "Pre-ceramic" (Okladnikov, 1950: 114-116). VII. THE CHRONOLOGY: RETROSPECT AND PROPOSITION In order to appreciate better some of the difficulties connected with the dating of Siberian Neolithic cultures, it seems appropriate to review the conclusions of some of the early investigators (both of the Paleolithic and later periods) and also to allude to some of the his- torical sources. Written references to the Baikal region are found in Arab texts of the first millennium A.D. Chinese sources also cover the first millennium A.D. and some of them even reach into the first millennium B.C. Thus, they deal with the Iron Age of the region only. Bracketing the Neolithic and Bronze Age periods from the other side are the Paleolithic remains. These can be readily correlated with geological phenomena-as mentioned earlier-and also with other Siberian Paleolithic sites outside the Angara Valley.1 The Neolithic of the region remains the most difficult era to date. The dating of the Neolithic was made difficult to many of the earlier writers by the survival of "Neolithic" techniques in the more remote parts of Siberia. We need only to mention the well-known accounts of Krashenninikov and Stellar on Kamchatka or Bogoraz's nineteenth-century account of the Chukchee. Observing these surviving techniques, many of the investigators proposed a recent introduction of the Neolithic into Siberia, or, at any rate, the impossibility of establishing the total span of the Neolithic Age there. Only a little 11 In the sense of "flowering" Neolithic. 1 For a comprehensive treatment of the Paleolithic period in the U.S.S.R. see Gromov, 1948, and Gromov, 1950. more than fifty years ago a number of writers saw manifestations of a "full-blown" Neolithic Age not only in northeastern Asia among the Koryaks, Itelmens, Chukchees, and Eskimos, but also in southern Siberia, in the Baikal region and along the Amur river (Kle- ments, 1895). Grewingk was one of the early writers who investi- gated the Kitoi mound. In his report he stated, in part, that the triangles incised into the blade of one of the daggers from that mound were analogous to the "wolf- tooth" design on some of the Bronze Age artifacts from northern Europe and that the incised circles with a dot in their centers were comparable to the "sun orna- ment" labeled as Celtic. The latter, according to Grewingk, is usual on the antler artifacts of the Neolithic of Denmark and Hannover, as well as on objects from Bronze Age Baltic sites and on bone artifacts from the "Chuda" 2 mounds of the Altai. "The form and orna- mentation of several of the bone artifacts from the Kitoi mound," writes Grewingk, "point directly to the knowledge and imitation of the comparable bronze ob- jects." He also stated that the use of red ochre in the Kitoi burials tied these to Stone Age mounds in western Europe. Grewingk dated the Baikal sites to the early part of the Neolithic and maintained that this Neolithic stage lasted there up to the time of the arrival of the Russians, i.e. until the seventeenth century (Grewingk, 1882: 189-212). Grewingk's statements were made in the spirit of his times. Again, there was the emphasis on the recency of the Siberian cultures in general. Some of the deduc- tions of Grewingk are untenable, others down-right naive, even in his own time when Vitkovskii's work was much more to the point (Vitkovskii, 1881: 1-12), but was silently passed over by Grewingk. Other investigators became interested in a comparison of the cultures of Siberia with those of northern Europe and European Russia. Ailio, Merhart, and Gandert were the most outstanding. Ailio had at his disposition only museum material in Helsinki and in some of the larger European Russian museums. He did not have access to the rich materials of some of the Western Siberian museums. In examining the stone axes, he realized that those found in the basins of the Northern Sosva and Narym Rivers 3 seemed to be typologically the earliest and that they resembled closely the sharp-butted Scandinavian axes. He dated these to periods I and II of Montelius. Other artifacts, like the unilaterally convex adze, he compared to the "Southern Karelian" adzes found in eastern Europe and dated them to the second period of Montelius or, at the latest, to the beginning of Montelius III. The thick-butted axes from Narym and Tara were assigned to Montelius III-IV. From these and similar comparisons, Ailio deduced that the stone inventory of 2 Finno-Ugric. 3 Tributaries to the lower reaches of the Ob in Western Siberia.</page><page sequence="25">26 MICHAEL: NEOLITHIC AGE IN EASTERN SIBERIA [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. the Ob basin developed parallel with that of Eastern Europe and that it had benefited ultimately from the experiences of the latter. The contacts took place through the Beluya, Chusovaya, and Tobol River Val- leys and, in the north, over the Sukhoma, Vychegda, Pechora, and Northern Sosva Valleys. At the same time, noted Ailio, there were influences on Western Siberia arriving from the south (Turkestan) and from the east (the Yenisei basin). In describing the "beautiful" Walzenbeil from Lade- ika on the Yenisei, Ailio stated that "it is unique in its type and the most antique of the Neolithic finds" known to him from that area. This artifact, together with the sharp-butted (thin-butted) axes from the Ob- Yenisei Canal region, he dated to Montelius I-II. To a later period belonged the blunt-butted (thick-butted) axes and those morphologically similar to Viervitz type axes,5 as well as the chisels of the "Russian-Karelian" type and the troughed adzes. The arrowheads and flint saws he assigned to the Late Neolithic. Thus, Ailio proposed for the Ob-Yenisei region the same kind of development as was archaeologically traced for Northern Europe and Eastern European Russia, with the Siberian region manifesting a slight time-lag (Ailio, 1922: 15-24). Aside from these general types of artifacts, wrote Ailio, there are in Siberia a number of local manifesta- tions not found in Europe. Such are the eared ("lobed") axes, troughed chisels with a notch or step on their "backs," stone fish figurines, and stone shanks of composite fish-hooks (Ailio, 1922: 23). Ailio emphasized the wide distribution of comb-im- pressed pottery-from the Bothnia and Riga Gulfs to the Yenisei, from the Arctic Ocean to the Oka River. Only east of the Yenisei and the Baikal region did the influence of Chinese ceramics come into play and replace the comb-impressed type. At the same time Ailio admitted that the Siberian comb-impressed pottery could be compared with the "typical" or "linear" ceramics of Europe and that it must be regarded as degenerate and later in time (Ailio, 1922: 62-75). Ailio presumed, then, that on a basis of a formal typological comparison Montelius' Scandinavian scheme could be applied to the Ural region, and even beyond, to Western Siberia and the Baikal region. In fact, how- ever, the Neolithic ceramics of Siberia had a strongly manifested individual character and their discoverable changes occurred in an entirely different tempo and form than in Finland, Karelia, and even in the center of European Russia. Montelius' scheme simply cannot be applied to Siberia. 4 A thick and oval-butted partly polished ax. It has a wide distribution in Europe, and is dated by Aberg to Montelius I. For details see Ebert, 1927: 9: 33, fig. 23, e, i; Ebert, 1929: 14: 249-250. 5 A local sub-type of a polished, non-perforated ax (Eastern Poland, Western Ukraine). For details see Ebert, 1927: 9: 244 and pl. 187, i. In this connection, Childe's statement is highly perti- nent: . . .Montelius' disciples and imitators have clumsily ex- tended his system beyond the regions for which it was devised and have used it as a frame of reference into which phenomena in Central Europe, South Russia, and even Turkestan must be fitted. From a fog of misconceptions and distortions they have evoked a "Nordic myth." The "Nordic cultures," crystallized in Montelius' II, would have expanded in periods III and IV till they reached the Balkans, Anatolia, and the Caucasus. These fantasies were never accepted in Denmark and have recently been emphatically rejected in Sweden and even Germany. An explicit refuta- tion here is accordingly superfluous (Childe, 1948: 177). Merhart (of the Vienna school) continued the work, basing himself on Ailio's premises. He divided the material pertaining to the subject into "Western" and "Eastern" cultural circles. The Western circle is actu- ally nothing else but a peripheral expression of the "Northern European cultural circle," and it embraces the territory of the European part of Russia, Finland, and Eastern Prussia. The main element of material culture in this particular circle is the comb-impressed pottery. Certain types of stone artifacts accompany the ceramics: adzes of the Russian-Karelian type, troughed adzes with sharp or blunted butts, small chisels of the Finnish type, ax-like scrapers with one or both edges sharpened, slate fish-hook shanks, and so on. The other cultural circle was provisionally named by Merhart the "Irkutsk circle." Its characteristics were: eared (lobed) axes, stone representations of fish, "Kitoi pendants," awls, pendants of boar's tusks, and nephrite objects such as polished knives, rings, and discs. He also acknowledged the presence of rare forms-in the thin and sharp-butted axes. To Merhart these were surviving, vestigial forms. Furthermore, it was his opinion that the ceramics of the Western Siberian Ne- olithic showed "measures of resemblance" to those of the Early Metal Age as expressed in the Andronovo and even in the Ananino cultures. In Eastern Siberia, he claimed, the Neolithic evolved directly into the Iron Age. Merhart's dating should not surprise us. Most of the finds belonging to the "Eastern" or "Irkutsk" circle he dated to Montelius IV, the ceramics to Montelius III-IV. Again, the recency of disappearance of the Neolithic was emphasized, as was the slower tempo of evolvement when compared to the regions west of it (Merhart, 1924: 139-148; Tallgren, 1928: 69, quoting Merhart). Gandert came out even more strongly than Merhart with a proposition of direct migration of the Western cultural circle elements into Siberia. He compared the ceramic complex of the "Eastern" circle with Chinese Neolithic ceramics of Sha-kuo-tun and also with Ne- olithic ceramics of Japan. Gandert accepted the premise of a Far Eastern origin for the "Eastern" ceramic com- plex of Ulan-Khada and with it he opened the more basic question as to whether European chronology is</page><page sequence="26">VOL. 48, PT. 2, 1958] CHRONOLOGY: RETROSPECT AND PROPOSITION 27 applicable to the Orient, or, as he maintains, the isolated Western elements found in the Orient represent a con- siderable time lag (Gandert, 1925). A simple, two-fold division of a really immense territory, without the slightest consideration of economic structure and economy in general, with every change explained through migration, cannot be accepted as a workable theory. The writings of Arsenev, Gorodtsov, and Kiselev express, both in a historical and contemporary sense, the opinions of Russian investigators on the Siberian Neolithic. Arsenev, principally an ethnographer and geographer, arrived at his version of the "metachronological" theory, which, while agreeing that outward manifestations of various cultural phases of Siberia and Europe were similar, proposed that the Siberian cultures were much younger in time. To do this it was necessary to presume an earlier passing of the Ice Age in Europe than in Siberia, since the Paleolithic remains of Siberia are in- dubitably connected to the geological and faunal mani- festations of the Ice Age (Arsenev, 1929: 273-296). More recent investigations have shown that the de- ductions of Arsenev did not have a realistic basis and that the history of the Ice Age is much more complex than it appeared to him. During Glacial and post- Glacial times, much of Siberia was more habitable than northern Europe, where, most geologists agree, the ice cover was thicker. The culture of Paleolithic man in Siberia during Solutrean, Solutrean-Magdelinian, and post-Magdelinian times (as gauged by the Western scale), developed in the same chronological frame as in the West during the Riss-Wiirm, Wiirm, and post- Wiirm eras (Okladnikov, 1950: 119). As early as 1907, Gorodtsov made some comparisons between the Kitoi and Glazkovo finds and those of the Bakhmut River basin of South European Russia (Gorodtsov, 1907: 217-219, 247). He pointed out some parallels: The burials revealed the same type of interment, orientation, and ochre-sprinkling; there were no remains of domesticated animals, no metal artifacts in either locality. The crude, round-bottomed vessels were the same. The arrowheads were also essentially of the same type, although the Donets-Bakhmut points had a better finish. The only composite fish-hook found in the South of European Russia showed affinities, ac- cording to Gorodtsov, to the elongated Irkutsk hooks. The arrangement of the grave furniture was also the same in both localities-along the arms and the head. The above comparisons were made by Gorodtsov on the basis of Vitkovskii's report 6 and through them he dated the Kitoi burials to the beginning of the Metal Age or, in his terminology, the Paleometallic (Gorod- tsov, 1908: 383-384). In the light of the knowledge of the Angara sites in Gorodtsov's time, this was an ad- vance. Twenty years later, Gorodtsov expressed the dating of the Kitoi more definitely. He correlated the Kitoi with the Afanasev of the Upper Yenisei and with the Catacomb of Southern European Russia (not the Pit 7 as formerly). He placed all these cultures in the center of the span of the Paleometallic and dated them to the third millennium B.C. (Soviet Great Encyclopedia, vol. 7, 1927 8). The following Glazkovo culture was dated-on the basis of nephrite discs and rings also found in the Seima culture-to the end of the Paleo- metallic. It was cited as contemporaneous with the Andronovo on the Yenisei and the Seima in Central European Russia and thus placed in the second half of the second millennium B.C. Earlier, in connection with this problem, he had stated more broadly: At the beginning of the second half of the second millen- nium B.C., the Seima culture penetrates into Central Euro- pean Russia, manifesting itself as a strong avant-garde of the Siberian cultural stream which not only made itself felt throughout European Russia but over the whole of Western Europe, even in such places as England, Portugal, Italy, and the Balkan peninsula. In part, the Seima culture played the role of a transient phenomenon, escaping the con- fines of chronological periods (Gorodtsov, 1915: 219, 222- 223). In 1935, without any reference to his previous dating, Gorodtsov re-evaluated the Siberian Neolithic "with cloth-impressed ceramics"-and this includes the Kitoi with its single vessel-to the Iron Age, the first millen- nium B.C. (Gorodtsov, 1935: 105-112).9 A correlation on the basis of one element, and furthermore, used in the dating of a whole complex, is untenable; the basis is too shallow. Even some of the elements which form the basis of Gorodtsov's earlier dating must be rejected. For in- stance, the "metal casting moulds," through which he dated the Kitoi as a Paleometallic culture, turn out to have not been used for that purpose at all. The single (in the time of Gorodtsov's dating), cloth-impressed vessel of the Kitoi period is actually not comparable in form to those of South European Russia. The third element, ochre, escapes the confines of close dating if used alone; it is also found associated with Upper Paleolithic burials (Okladnikov, 1950: 124). Nevertheless, Gorodtsov's deductions had consider- able influence on other investigators, Western (Tallgren, 1938) and Soviet. Of the Soviet writers, it was Kiselev who was under the direct influence of Gorodtsov's earlier statements. He regarded Gorodtsov's correla- tions of the Afanasev and Catacomb as correct and applied them to the Early Bronze Age of the Minusinsk area and to the Baikal cultures associated with them, i.e. he dated these to the second half of the second 6 Alluded to on pp. 9 and 14. 7 "Yamnaya." 8 Not seen. As quoted by Okladnikov, 1950: 123. 9 It is a point of interest that Gorodtsov's dating still appears in the introductory volume to the Soviet Great Encyclopedia, 1951: 154-157.</page><page sequence="27">28 MICHAEL: NEOLITHIC AGE IN EASTERN SIBERIA [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. millennium B.C. He argued that this was supported by his find, in the Minusinsk district, of a petiolate copper knife and a small bowl of the Catacomb type. The Glazkovo burials were dated by Kiselev to the end of the Afanasev and further correlated with the Seima culture of the Volga basin. This was Kiselev's initial dating (Kiselev, 1929: 32-33). Ten years later, in 1938, Kiselev wrote that on the basis of some typical objects found in the steppes north of the Black Sea (censers, cylinders, small wheels), the Afanasev on the Upper Yenisei could be dated syn- chronously with the Pit-Catacomb of southern European Russia (third and beginning of second millennium B.C.). In the Krasnoyarsk district, the Afontova Gora burials near Yudina village-which are similar to the Kitoi and Glazkovo-are expressive of the Afanasev period (Kiselev, 1938: 229). Still later, he expressed his thoughts on the correlation of the Afanasov culture and North Caucasian 10 catacomb burials, that is, on the Europoid settlement of Siberia (Kiselev, 1948: 169- 170). This particular point will be discussed later in this chapter. So much for retrospect. If the chronological sequence of the various phases of the Lake Baikal Neolithic and Eneolithic, as estab- lished earlier, is accepted (and it will be documented in some detail in subsequent chapters), pertinent elements of the material inventory may be selected and compared with importations and imitations from other regions. This will help toward establishing a well-founded chronology. The Shivera culture is closest to the written docu- ments (Chinese and Arabian) mentioned before and its span is determinable in adequately solid chronological boundaries. For instance, the cast representation of a snake from Shivera mound is stylistically and techno- logically closest to Karasuk objects from the Minusinsk area. The nephrite and metal artifacts from Shivera mound have their counterparts also in the Fofanovo mound child burial where the nephrite adzes are ac- companied by Karasuk type metal daggers. Okladnikov does not question the correlation of Shivera and Karasuk, but he does challenge the usual "absolute" date given for the Karasuk culture of the Minusinsk area-tenth-eighth centuries B.C. He points out that the Northern Chinese daggers which represent a fully developed Karasuk style are datable to the second half of the Yin dynasty (thirteenth-twelfth centuries B.C.). "How then," he continues, "can we date the Shivera with its correlative evidence of the Fofanovo dagger, and the Karasuk itself, to a later period ?" Challenging this dating (tenth-eighth centuries B.C.) iS the dagger from Fofanovo mound which differs from the majority of Karasuk daggers and knives in its marked simplicity and primitiveness of form. To the 10 I.e. the foot-hills and lowlands north of the main Caucasus range. contrary, the Karasuk daggers from Minusinsk usually have a massive blade, often with a lens-like cross-section, geometrically ornamented handles, with the knob of the handle carrying zoomorphic representations (Gryaznov, 1929). Okladnikov asserts that both the Karasuk and Shivera are "obviously close in time to the Seima- Turbino of central European Russia and the Urals, and possibly to the Andronovo of Western Siberia" (Oklad- nikov, 1950: 125). In connection with this statement, the relation of the Andronovo and Karasuk periods should be examined. As investigations of these two cultures progressed, it became clear that Teplukhov's sequential arrangement of them in a single area-the Minusinsk region-could not be upheld." Okladnikov proposed that the primary area for the remains of the Andronovo culture is west of the Yenisei. The center of the Karasuk culture lies about the same distance to the east of the Minusinsk basin. The meet- ing of these two cultures could have then taken place in the Yenisei basin without negating the chronological span of either, or, elaborating on this further, the Early Karasuk (and the Shivera as correlated with it supra) could have co-existed with the Early Andronovo to the west of it. For reasons mentioned in preceding para- graphs, the Shivera of the Baikal region could be dated to a period even earlier than the second half of the Yin dynasty (Okladnikov, 1950: 125-126). The Glazkovo period, too, is represented by a number of objects which lend themselves to comparison with those of other cultures. Among them, first of all, are the leaf-shaped knives. They certainly cannot be com- pared with those of Karasuk or Andronovo, but only with the knives typical of the Afanasev of the Upper Yenisei basin. Kiselev described two such knives from kurgans nos. 18 and 19 of the Tesinsk site in the Minusinsk krai. He compared them directly to the knives of Glazkovo mound (Kiselev, 1929: 25-26). The Tesinsk mound also contained another type of knife with a broad, short, triangular blade and a fairly long tang (the leaf-shaped knives were not tanged). It is analogous to the type found in the Catacomb burials in the south of European Russia (Kiselev, 1929: 26- 27; compare with Schmidt, 1929: 9-21). These Tesinsk knives are typologically more recent than the tangless ones, either from the Glazkovo mound or the Tesinsk kurgans. Then, according to Okladnikov, on the basis of the leaf-shaped knives, the following Glaz- kovo-Afanasev correlations may be made: The Early Glazkovo with its simple knives without tangs with the Early Afanasev, and the Glazkovo period burials of the Lenkovo type (where a tanged knife was found) with the Late Afanasev. In his recently published major work, Kiselev also concluded that the Tesinsk and Glazkovo burials cannot be dated as contemporaneous with the Karasuk period: 11 As cited, for instance, by Golomshtok, 1933: 316-320.</page><page sequence="28">VOL. 48, PT. 2, 1958] CHRONOLOGY: RETROSPECT AND PROPOSITION 29 . . . the identity of the Glazkovo knives with the Late Afanesev ones from the Tesinsk kurgans allows us to date them [the Glazkovo knives] not later than the antiquities of Early Andronovo . . . (Kiselev, 1949: 38). This implies a cultural time-lag for the Baikal region.12 Favoring a synchronization of the Glazkovo knives with the Early Andronovo, Kiselev pointed to the pres- ence of cylindrical white beads in the Glazkovo as indi- cators of the post-Afanasev appearance of the Glazkovo knives. This type of bead, he writes, appears in the materials of the steppe regions of Siberia with the be- ginning of the Andronovo period (Kiselev, 1949: 39). However, Okladnikov contends that the Glazkovo beads of pyrophilite and similar stones differ considerably from those of the Early Andronovo and the much later beads of the steppes. They are much smaller, shorter in length and diameter. "They are altogether different beads" (Okladnikov, 1950: 127). They confirm that the Glazkovo knives are historically older because they are not found in the Andronovo and later antiquities. Further, all of the metal objects of the Glazkovo period have the "seal" of local stone prototypes on them and indicate that they are not imported objects from far off regions to the south and west, but products of local artisans. Not a single object revealing a "foreign" technique has been found in the Glazkovo burials. This is not to suggest that the metal objects originated here in isolation from the metal arts of the neighboring dis- tricts or other parts of the Old World. The inhabitants of the Baikal region were not separated from other peoples by such immense areas of taiga, tundra, or ocean as were, for instance, the inhabitants of North America over a wide zone. To the contrary, in the relative nearness of the southern steppes of North Asia, there was developing for a long time a copper and bronze metallurgy. Easy travel down the Angara and up the Yenisei, or vice versa, would bring men or ideas to one of the earlier metal-working cultures within the territory of the contemporary U.S.S.R.-the Minusinsk basin. The steppes east of Lake Baikal were even closer and in turn had ancient ties with Mongolia and China. There is, then, a basic parallelness in the origin an(d evolution of forms in the Baikal and Minusinsk regions during this early metal age. The Tesinsk finds and the late phases of the Glazkovo period may, in turn, be synchronized with the Catacomb, and the early group of Afanasev burials as well as the Early Glazkovo interments with the end of the period preceding the Catacomb in the south of European Russia-the Pit ("Yamnaya"). Other metal artifacts (crudely made spiral bracelets and pins, cylinders fashioned from ham- mered copper plates) and ceramics of the Glazkovo, 12 To the contrary, Gorodtsov asserted a synchronization of the Glazkovo and Tesinsk burials with the Karasuk period. He presented his views in an unpublished paper read before the meeting of the Archaeological Section of the Institute for Archaeology and Art, November 1924 (Kiselev, 1949: footnote on p. 38). although less expressive of the connections, certainly do not contradict the essential correlation given above (Okladnikov, 1950: 129). Of further importance for the dating of the Glazkovo and its correlation with the Afanasev are the few Afanasev burials in the environs of Krasnoyarsk, among them the Afontova Gora burials, those excavated in the city of Krasnoyarsk, and those near Perevozno village (Okladnikov, 1949: 7-13). In all of these the beadwork and the ceramics agree. In addition, the burial from Afontova Gora contained a pointed bone instrument with an anthropomorphic repre- sentation at the end of its handle. It is analogous with the bone idol found in the Early Glazkovo burial near Anosovo village on the Angara. The bone armor scales found near Perevozno village are of the same type as those found in the Glazkovo burial at Ust'-Ilgi on the Lena River. Other support for this dating of the Glazkovo period is revealed in the cultures of pre-dynastic China: The nephrite "bracelets" of Glazkovo are closely analogous to Yuan and Chuan types found in North China in the Pan-Shan mounds of the Tao River basin. They are dated by Anderson, on the basis of ceramics, to the middle stage of the Yangshao culture, although it is possible that a part of the materials may be carried to the end of the Yangshao (Andersson, 1934; Andersson, 1943: 124-126). Nephrite axes were also found at Pan-Shan, but these were not illustrated and it is diffi- cult to judge their importance in this connection. How- ever, other nephrite axes from North China, published by Andersson, show that they are similar to axes found in Glazkovo burials on the Angara, Upper Lena, and Selenga, being convex on both sides and having a narrow butt (Andersson, 1943: pl. 74, 1). The small beads from Pan-Shan-in the form of short cylinders- also remind of the nephrite beads from Glazkovo burials (Andersson, 1943: pl. 72, 3, 4). Andersson dates the Yangshao culture 2200-1700 B.C. and the Ma-shan culture following it, 1700-1300 B.C. The latter is contemporary with the Yin period, or on the Eastern Siberian scale it precedes the Karasuk. The Karasuk, fitted into Andersson's classification, would be contemporaneous with his Hsin-Tien culture which he dates 1300-1000 B.C. Thus, even when compared with its Far Eastern analogues, the Glazkovo culture cannot be carried later than the first half and the very beginning of the second half of the second millennium B.C. Okladnikov's 1947 finds in Buryat Mongolia, east of Lake Baikal, under- line the cultural contacts there with the regions of the Far East (Okladnikov, 1948; Okladnikov, 1952: 40- 47). The Kitoi period lacks the more easily datable metal objects, but contains enough stone and bone artifacts for a comparative study with cultural periods preceding and following it. Among them are the white marble rings. These are circular or rhomboid in cross-section,</page><page sequence="29">30 MICHAEL: NEOLITHIC AGE IN EASTERN SIBERIA [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. sometimes with characteristic incisions or "notching" on the outer edge. Thus far, none have been found in Minusinsk krai or in Western Siberia. However, in the European part of Russia they do have their ana- logues in the Nalchik-type mounds 13 and in the burials of Krivolucha.14 The Nalchik mound contained nine- teen such bracelets made of marl. They have circular or semi-circular cross-sections. In distinction from the Kitoi rings they were used as bracelets and have been found in situ, on the wrists of the buried (Kruglov et al., 1941: 112-113). Chest and shoulder ornaments of bear teeth were also found in the Nalchik mounds and these are analogous to those found in the Kitoi burials of the Baikal region. There were also beads of perforated animal teeth and shell beads analogous to those of the Kitoi and Serovo burials. The latter are cylindrical in appearance and have a varying width, i.e. diameter, ranging from 0.5 mm. to 7.5 mm. The beads were found in the chronologically earliest different groups of burials found in the Nalchik mounds (Kruglov et al., 1941: 116, 119 and pl. II and IV). In this earliest group the skeletons were oriented from east to west and were sprinkled with red ochre. They were usually slightly flexed-in differentiation from the skeletons of the later groups which were more definitely flexed. As we have seen earlier, the Kitoi burials had the same orientation, ochre-sprinkling, and extended position. The early group of the Nalchik burials was dated to the second half of the third millennium B.C. (Kruglov et. al., 1941: 125-126). The Krivolucha burials cor- roborate the above. Materials from other sites support this correlation. Very similar to the bracelets described above were those found at the Neolithic site of Tetramits near Kutaisi.15 With them were found other typical Neolithic artifacts: roughly worked axes (blanks?), polished axes, small- sized flint and obsidian objects, rubbing stones, stone mortars, and a fragment of a clay figurine representing a man.16 Gorodtsov reported a stone ring from a Cata- comb mound near Raikovo village "beautifully made of green stone (malachite?), probably part of a headdress and a relict of earlier times than the Catacomb" (Gor- odtsov, 1907: 227, 229). Heavy marble rings were also found in Late Neolithic burials of Central Europe and dated to the second half of the third millennium B.C. (Buttler, 1938: 51, fig. 22, 1; Lais, 1948: 103- 111). More rarely they were found in the mounds of Italy, France, and other Western European countries (Dechelette, 1908: 1: 521; Ailio, 1922: 48). In Egypt they appeared in the first and second dynasties of the fourth millennium B.c. and continued into the third millennium (Flinders Petrie, 1901: pl. XXXV; Dechel- ette, 1908: 1: 578, fig. 221). To the east of Lake Baikal stone rings were found in the Sha-kuo-tan cave.17 Those illustrated by Anders- son showed the same type of edge incision as the Baikal rings. Andersson assigned magical properties to these incisions which come in groups of three (Andersson, 1943: 252-253, fig. 95). Stone rings were also found in the Neolithic "Pit" sites of the wooded parts of European Russia, Finland, and Latvia. Ailio called them transitional from Stone to Bronze and dated them to Montelius III-IV (Ailio, 1909: 47-49). Foss dated similar finds in Karelia to the end of the third, beginning of the second millennium B.C. (Foss, 1947a: 12, fig. 1). Through all of these correlations, the Kitoi phase of the Baikal region may be dated to the second half of the third millennium B.C. or, at the latest, to the very beginning of the second nmillennium B.C. This dating is further supported by other stone and bone objects of the Kitoi. There are, for instance, the unusual bone pins from Rasputino mound. These are circular in cross-section with two hammer-like projections at the head. This type of pin (fig. 8) was found in the Pit and Catacomb Early Metal Age burials of the south European Russian steppes (Rau, 1929: 47-50; Rykov, 1933: 209). Up to this time they had not been found to the north or east of the Lower Volga region, and to the south not beyond the Koban Valley. The ham- mer pins found by Okladnikov at Rasputino are the only ones, thus far, to be located north and east of their principal region of distribution. Childe's attention was drawn to the problems of the chronological position of the South Russian steppe graves and he tackled these problems in an article (Childe, 1931: 128-129) in which he described hammer- head pins and battle axes as comparable elements. After reviewing Schmidt's and Tallgren's correlations, he pointed out that a solidly founded correlation cannot be reached on the basis of agreement of local products of distant regions but on a basis of realistic imports or copies thereof which belong to a separate, narrowly specialized type.'8 The pins under discussion represent, in his opinion, such a case. They are manifestations of a widespread South Russian type-from the Dnieper to the Caspian-characteristic among other artifacts of 13 In the lowlands north of the Caucasus range. 14 In Kuibyshev oblast, on the Chagra River, a tributary to the Volga. 15 Western part of Georgian S.S.R. 16 Found by Chebukiani.

Tallgren correlated the Early Koban (the Maikop burials and the kurgans near Tsarskoe Station) with the Danish Passage Grave epoch and in "absolute" chronology carried them later than 2000 B.C. The Late Koban phase (Catacomb burials) he correlated with the Long Stone Cist burials of Denmark and assigned them to the period 1800-1400, B.C. Tallgren endeavored to support his conclusions by analogies with daggers and jewelry from Sumer and the Early Minoan (for the Early Koban) and with Danish, Silesian, and Middle Minoan analogues (for the Late Koban).</page><page sequence="30">VOL. 48, PT. 2, 1958] CHRONOLOGY: RETROSPECT AND PROPOSITION 31 *7 I!7 i * Pr*8 FIG. 8.

This type, with its large, heavy head and sturdy shank, radically differs from the bone pins of Bohemia, Switzer- land, England, and France which are mentioned by Tallgren and which appear to be imitations of the metal pins from Remedello in North Italy. He continues: . .. a bone hammer-pin, showing all the peculiarities of the South Russian type was recently found . . . in a passage- grave on Lolland. The pin is almost certainly an import from South Russia; at the worst it is a deliberate and iso- lated imitation of the Pontic type. It lay in a stratified burial deposit associated with pottery . . . (Childe, 1931: 129). Furthermore, the distinctive perforated battle axes of the Middle Koban seem to tie in with the Early~ Mace- donian ones which are dated, according to Childe, about 2000 B.C. In that case the Middle Koban begins in the third millennium B.C. and lasts until the very beginning of the second millennium (Childe, 1931: 129). Among a number of objects which Gorodtsov used to document the chronological proximity of the Kitoi and the Bronze Age cultures of the Black Sea steppes are the "casting forms"; in reality they are semi-cylindrical polishing stones with a trough on the flat side. Such forms are common in Catacomb burials and also in Danubian Neolithic mounds where they are often found together with corded ware (Buttler, 1938: 2: pl. 18, item 10). The burials of the Kitoi period also show specialized traits which agree with those of the burials in the European Russian South and in Northern Europe. In the case of the Mariupol mound the agreement is in the ochre sprinkling, extended position of the deceased, orientation to the "sun,'" antithetically positioned burials, boar's tusks ornaments, necklaces of animal teeth, cylin- drical shell beads, "'smoothing"' stones, and finally bone tubes with diagonal incisions (Makarenko, 1933: 22- 23). In this connection it is interesting that although some of the ornamental artifacts so typical of the Mariupol inventory were not found in the Kitoi, they do appear in the Neolithic materials of Sha-kuo-tan (Andersson, 1923: pl. VIII, figs. 1-5; Makarenko, 1933: 47) and, contrariwise, Sha-kuo-tun arrowheads- close in form to those of the Kitoi and earlier Baikal Neolithic periods-do not appear in the Mariupol mound (Andersson, 1923: pl. VI, items 5-7). Nevertheless, it would seem that the foundations of the chronological structure connecting the Far East and the West would be strengthened by the Kitoi finds. When all of the artifacts of the Mariupol mound are considered, it immediately becomes evident that orna- mental objects prevail over utilitarian ones. We have seen earlier that this was not the case of the Kitoi com- plex. For this reason it is revealing to compare the Eastern Siberian Kitoi materials with those of North European Russia, which also manifest a similar ratio of utilitarian and ornamental artifacts. One such site was investigated by Ravdonikas on Olenii ostrov in Lake Onega (Ravdonikas, 1940: 46-62). The general pat- tern of the burials was the same as that of the Kitoi; use of ochre, extended position of skeleton, orientation to the sun, two or three burials to a mound in a number of cases. In addition the bone daggers from Olenii ostrov were analogous to the Kitoi ones, and the pendants of animal teeth were comparable to those of the Serovo period. Very characteristic of the burials of Olenii ostrov were pendants made of beaver teeth. The type site of Kitoi contained analogous ornamental artifacts, as did the Tsiklodrom site. In turn, the Olenii ostrov mounds had ties, in many instances, with some of the burial sites of Scandinavia which have been mentioned earlier in this presentation as having parallels with the Kitoi one, such as Vasterbjers on Gotland.

These goods consisted of axes, bone points, boar tusks, etc. (Sternberger, 1939: 72). Some of the boar tusks had deep incisions-also common in the Kitoi (Sternberger, 1939: 94, fig. 28 on p. 96). The Vasterbjers "har- poons" with a drilled side flange for attachment of a line (Sternberger, 1939: figs. 18 and 23) were similar to those of the Kitoi. The bone harpoon head of this construction disappeared with the arrival of Glazkovo times and was not found in an earlier period than the Kitoi, i.e. it is typical only of the Kitoi period of the Lake Baikal region (Okladnikov, 1950: 136). The Vasterbjers mounds were easily datable. The thin-butted flint axes, the perforated boat axes, and the ceramics place it in the late period of Passage graves, in time close to the Long Stone Cist burials-2000- 1800 B.C. No direct correlation or overall agreement of the Kitoi phase with the second cultural cycle of Northern Europe, the Megalithic, is proposed here, although the Olenii ostrov and Vasterbjers sites exhibit some general traits common to it. At that, it is curious that the incised circle with a dot in its center found on some of the artifacts at Vasterbjers and the somewhat earlier Megalithic phase (Sprokhoff, 1938: 13, pl. 26, fig. 5) is present on some of the needle cases, bracelets, and other bone artifacts of the Kitoi (Okladnikov, 1950: 138). The comparative scheme expressed in table 1 sum- 19 The skeletons were not dusted with ochre, although ochre was present in three of the mounds. marizes, in condensed form, some of the thoughts ex- pressed earlier in this chapter. It follows that the Serovo period which precedes the Kitoi has to be dated to an earlier part of the third millennium B.C. However, here we do not have the possibility of as thorough a chronological comparison as was the case so far. Nevertheless, as will be shown, the earliest Neolithic remains of the Baikal region-the Khina and Isakovo-are tied in with the late stages of the Paleolithic. Certainly there was not a "hiatus" be- tween the Paleolithic and Neolithic Ages of the Baikal region, or for that matter, of the West, but a slow transi- tion. This transition, however, occurred here in dif- ferent forms and tempo than in the West. This point will be taken up again in subsequent chapters, although this much may be said at the present: the chronology of early stages of the Neolithic in Eastern Siberia is dependent as much on archaeological investigations as on geological, geomorphological, and paleontological data. Studies of others have established the correlation of the Late Paleolithic with the 8-10-meter terraces of the great Siberian rivers such as the Angara, Lena, and Yenisei. Considerable changes in the appearance of the cross-sections of these river valleys have taken place since the 10-meter terraces have been formed. The Angara and Lena Rivers also have a 6-meter, a 4-meter, and a 1.5-2-meter terrace. Relative to the dating of these terraces, Okladnikov specifically stated that the differences in their heights no doubt . . . reflect the passage of a long period of time . . . thousands of years. Alas, we cannot measure with precise methods the entire length of that period extending from the time of the formation of the 8-10-meter terrace- the appearance of Late Paleolithic man in Eastern Siberia</page><page sequence="32">VOL. 48, PT. 2, 1958] CHRONOLOGY: RETROSPECT AND PROPOSITION 33 to present times-as was done in Northern Europe through the employment of varve-dating . . . (Okladnikov, 1950: 138). In spite of this shortcoming, Gromov's studies proved that the geological, paleontological, and archaeological findings, in an overall manner, support considerable parallelism and even direct correlation of Upper Pale- olithic developments in Eastern Siberia on the one hand, and in Eastern Europe on the other. There is no doubt that the Upper Paleolithic remains of Mal'ta and Buret' 20 were close in time to the Late Solutrean of the Eastern European plain or, at least, to the Early Magdalenian sites datable in Eastern Europe to the end of the Glacial (Gromov, 1948: 330, 386, 414; Gromov, 1950: 90-106). Further, the "Late Magdalenian" remains in Siberia, for instance, such as were contained in the upper horizon of the Afontova Gora site or Verkholenskaya Gora or Mal'ta, cannot be chronologically very far from the Late Magdalenian and Azilo-Tardenoisian sites of South Russia or from the Mesolithic of Northern Europe which is contemporary with them. As a rule, this North European Mesolithic is dated toward the end of the last Glacial or the beginning of the post- Glacial. More exactly, this means the eighth-sixth mil- 20 Upper Paleolithic sites in the Angara Valley. lennia B.C.-the period of climatic amelioration in North- ern Europe. On the whole, a similar climatic change can be projected for Siberia where, for instance, the Late Paleolithic cultural remains of the upper horizon at Mal'ta are tied with the upper horizons of loessic deposits, and, in the lower part of this Upper Paleolithic cultural horizon, the remains are associated with a deposit of dark-colored soil. Deposits of loess are manifestations of a drier and colder period. The dark- colored soil represents a different climatic regime, a milder one, analogous to the Boreal and Atlantic eras in the West. There the climatic transition is dated to the eighth-fifth millennia B.C. In this way it is possible to date the later stages of the Siberian Paleolithic, which can be correlated with the Mesolithic of the West, to the eighth-sixth millennia B.C. (Oklad- nikov, 1950: 139). The Khina period which follows the Paleolithic and during which there appear for the first time arrow- heads "with a microlithic tradition," may be condi- tionally and approximately dated to the fifth millennium B.C., the Isakovo to the fourth, and the Serovo, as mentioned earlier, to the beginning of the third millen- nium B.C. (Okladnikov, 1950: 139-140). Table 2 expresses, in a schematic way, the chronology of all the periods which were discussed in this and previous chapters.

Okladnikov is very much aware of the conditional dating of the early phases of the Lake Baikal Neolithic and also of his "heresy" in the dating of the later phases, a dating which is contrary to that of most of the earlier writers and challenging to some of the contemporary writers. He anticipates objections and answers some of them: The dates for the first three stages of the Baikal Neolithic may appear, at first glance, to have been pushed back too far. Also, it could be objected that the first traces of these archaic cultures in Siberia were more belated than those of the West. But, in the first place, the evaluation of the Glazkovo and Kitoi has shown that there can be no place for a proposition of considerably late development of the cultures of the early inhabitants of the Baikal region in the sense of V. K. Arsenov's writings. Secondly, even if this proposition about the late develop- ment is accepted, it would readily fall apart when it is realized that in order to account for the later stages it would have to presume their development in a very short period of time-a century, at the most two or three centuries. To the contrary, it would be more logical and of more common sense to presume that the farther back in time we go, the slower the evolvement of cultures. It is also fully realized that all of the stages of the Baikal Neolithic may not be known today and that future investi- gations may modify the present chronology. However, this could possibly apply only to the pre-Isakovo stage, as far as overall chronology is concerned, or it could subdivide, refine, the post-Isakovo ones. The latter is, however, un- likely because of the close relation of the successive stages, the established overlap of some of the type artifacts.... Also, the Isakovo materials contain objects of such nature that they cannot be very far removed from the Paleolithic (Okladnikov, 1950: 140). VIII. THE ORIGIN OF THE BAIKAL NEOLITHIC AND THE POSITION OF THE KHINA PERIOD The general belief in a "hiatus" between the Pale- olithic and Neolithic, a belief which prevailed in archae- ological circles for many years, made it difficult to assess the transitional period-the Neolithic. But even today, with the "hiatus" theory thoroughly disproved, there is a paucity of materials in respect to the very early phases of the Neolithic. All of the investigators who became interested in the origins of the Baikal Neolithic agreed that it pos- sessed genetic ties with the preceding local Paleolithic. However, these ties were not of the nature that had been assigned to them by the earlier writers who had compared them to evolutionary developments in the regions to the west. Although there was general agree- ment and parallelness of development between Siberia and the West in some respects, the evolution of the Paleolithic into a Siberian Neolithic differed appreciably in tempo and character. The resulting Baikal Neolithic, when it was fully developed, was accordingly differ- entiated from the type of Neolithic cultures that de- veloped out of the Paleolithic of Europe. Obviously, the results of the investigation of these problems in the west of Europe, or even in Europe in general, should not be mechanically transplanted and applied to Siberia. In the Angara Basin and elsewhere in Siberia there are a number of combined Late Paleolithic and Ne- olithic sites which lend themselves admirably to the study of transition in material culture. The character of the early phases of the Stone Age in Siberia was clarified to a certain extent only with the discovery and excavation of the Mal'ta site in the Belaya River Valley (Gerasimov, 1931: 55-56; Gerasimov, 1933: 78-125). In 1936 the Buret' site1 was dis- covered and proved to have ties, in all general aspects, with Mal'ta (Okladnikov, 1939: 290 if.; Okladnikov, 1940: 59-62; Okladnikov, 1941: 16-31). Both of these sites belong to the transitional Glacial- post-Glacial times. The fauna had a decidedly Arctic aspect: mammoth, wooly rhinoceros, arctic fox, white ptarmigan. In addition these sites contained remains of the bison (Bison priscus), the Northern deer, fox, glutton, wolf, snowy ram (Ovis nivicula), and the cave lion. The quantity of the bone remains was enormous and underlined the importance of hunting (Okladnikov, 1950: 142). The stone and bone manufactures from Mal'ta show a general similarity to those of the Upper Paleolithic finds from both the west and east of Europe. This agreement, together with geological facts, would allow the dating of Mal'ta and Buret' to the end of the Solutrean, or perhaps to the Early Magdalenian. This agreement is that more expressive and important since up to 1928 all of the Paleolithic material uncovered in Siberia revealed a quite different character (Okladni- kov, 1950: 143). In the Yenisei Valley, near Krasnoyarsk, there are a number of Paleolithic sites, in time just somewhat later than Mal'ta and Buret'. Geologically they belong to the 15-18-meter terrace and Gromov, in his geological- paleontological classification, placed them in his Group I. Gromov's Group I is characterized by the pre- dominance of Arctic "Wuirm" fauna, although here, on the Yenisei, the wooly rhinoceros has not been found (Gromov, 1948). Gromov's Group II of Yenisei Paleolithic sites is geomorphologically tied to the 9-12-meter terrace. The climate was drier, more continental, the rivers shallow. The mammoth died out, the fox moved to the north. In the fauna there was a predominance of the northern deer, the horse, and wild cattle. Group III belongs in time to the end-formation of the second terrace. The cultural layers belonging to this group were found in the sandy clays which at one time were on the terrace above it and had been washed down. The climate and fauna were essentially the same as in Group II. With the exception of Mal'ta and Buret', the Late 1 On the right bank of the Angara, 120 kilometers downstream from Irkutsk.</page><page sequence="34">VOL. 48, PT. 2, 1958] THE ORIGIN OF THE BAIKAL NEOLITHIC 35 Paleolithic cultures of Siberia-found over the areally enormous territory between Ulan Bator and Biisk- exhibited a unified and stable character during the chronologically long period between the "Group III" sites and the beginning of the Neolithic. The dominant stone artifact which underlined this unity seemed to be a massive scraper of the "Mousterian" semilunar type. However, when these were compared with the scrapers from Mal'ta and Buret', it became evident that at these sites they were not manufactured with archaic "Mouste- rianoid" techniques. These two "monolithic cycles," as Okladnikov terms them, are so different that the latest artifacts of Afontova, which belong to group III in Gromov's classification, differ less from the earliest ones of the same site than do the latter from those of Mal'ta and Buret' (Okladnikov, 1950: 144). Historically, the first impression of the Yenisei Pale- olithic finds was such that they were assigned to the Early Paleolithic. However, later it became clear that the bone artifacts in association with the stone work were characteristic only of the Late Paleolithic and that some of the smaller stone objects belonged to the very end of it (Merhart, 1923: 21-55). To some investi- gators this indicated a disunity rather than a unity and it was explained away by a survival theory, that is, some of the artifacts were relicts of earlier cultures. Gorodtsov, for one, followed this theory most vigorously (Gorodtsov, 1929). Another theory that sought to explain this seeming inconsistency of the Siberian Paleolithic was presented by Bonch-Osmolovsky and Gromov: The outwvard manifestations here are the same as on the banks of the Dnieper and the Don, but the industry, at first glance, is different. It is a mixture of archaic forms of-if we use here the European classification-Middle and even Lower Paleolithic with that of the Upper Paleolithic. . . . The crux of the matter lies in the materials used. Where the "European" used flint, the "Siberian" used river pebbles . . . touchstone,2 quartzite, and all sorts of flinty metamorphized slates which could result in artifacts made for the same kind of job but not in the same form as the original (Bonch-Osmolovsky and Gromov, 1936: 17). Still another theory came with the discovery of Paleolithic sites east of Lake Baikal and in the Ordos. This led Auerbach and other archaeologists to the be- lief that the peculiarities of the Siberian Paleolithic are assignable to influences from the Orient, not to any local development or to the West (Auerbach, 1930: 41). Okladnikov did not accept any of these theories. He objected to the "mineralogical" theory of Bonch-Osmo- lovsky and Gromov on the basis that practically all of the Siberian sites yielded artifacts which were typo- logically both "archaic" and terminal Paleolithic, yet were made of the very same kind of raw material. Even some of the Neolithic sites in the Lake Baikal region 2 Basanite. revealed the use of the same raw materials for the manufacture of typically Neolithic artifacts. For in- stance, river pebbles were used for the manufacture of thin knife blades, miniature scrapers, and arrowheads. The traditional assumption that part of the inventory of the Siberian Paleolithic reflected survivals of the Middle and Lower Paleolithic was dispelled with the discovery and investigation of the Mal'ta and Buret' sites. At the present these are the oldest Paleolithic sites in Siberia and yet there was not a single artifact in them that would reveal even typological connectives with the Early Paleolithic. Therefore, to Okladnikov it seemed more reasonable to propose that these so- called "archaic elements" were actually newly formed elements and, at that, independently formed ones. In examining some of these "archaic elements," Okladnikov paid special attention to the hand ax or "biface." Most of the earlier investigators saw in them derivatives of Chellean and Acheulean hand axes on the order of the coup de poing (Sosnovskii, 1934: 252, 267, 276). Altogether eleven such hand axes were found at Afontova II. They were accompanied by other "archaic" elements: ovoid, discoid, and wedge- like scrapers. Okladnikov examined the Afontova II hand axes with great care and came to the conclusion that they were not copies of Early Paleolithic prototypes, in fact, that they were not handaxes at all but variants of scrapers (Okladnikov, 1950: 148-150 passim). When the bone work of Mal'ta and Buret' was com- pared to that of the later Paleolithic sites on the Yenisei and Upper Lena and further, when both of these groups were compared with European sites, both quantitative and qualitative differences appeared. It was not the bone-working techniques that had degenerated in the Siberian sites. Chipping, cutting, abrasion, boring, were still employed. In addition, the Siberians had learned the technique of inserting stone blades into grooved bone holders. The importance of bone work in their economic undertakings did not diminish, al- though quantitatively the Yenisei sites furnished fewer bone artifacts than did Mal'ta and Buret'. Qualitatively, the only set-back was in the art in the Yenisei locale. Even in the oldest deposits of Afontova II, where there was a relative abundance of worked bone, there was nothing to remind of the finely worked Mal'ta objects. There were no sculptured figurines of women or birds, no engravings of animals. The number of pendants and beads diminished and lost the refine- ment seen at Mal'ta; they were manufactured from common materials, not special ones. All in all, the Late Paleolithic art work on the Yenisei was repre- sented by crudely cut and irregular rings of bone or tusk, stringed beads of primitively cut long bones, pendants of irregular forms, perforated animal teeth, and discs of soft stone with engraved lines, in one case radially arranged. This sort of picture was repeated</page><page sequence="35">36 MICHAEL: NEOLITHIC AGE IN EASTERN SIBERIA [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. in the upper layers of the Angara Valley Paleolithic sites. Much importance should be attached to the appear- ance of the bow and arrow in the Baikal region. Con- trary to the theory that the bow and arrow enabled one individual to excel and consequently caused the dis- integration of large communities and "the weakening of collective labors," Okladnikov held that the employ- ment of this new weapon enabled a higher type of community living, i.e. an economic surplus. In this sense the bow and arrow may be compared to a sort of a "handwheel" (Okladnikov, 1950: 153). The process of gradual change toward the end of the Paleolithic of the West and of Siberia, certainly not a regressive process, was manifested through several specific developments. In Siberia these may be sum- marized as follows: 1. The progressive transition started here relatively early-in traditional archaeological terminology with the Late Magdalenian, not with the Azilian or Mes- olithic. While in Azilian-Mesolithic times the Mediter- ranean cultures expressed a change in increasingly em- phasizing the collecting of mollusks and shells and in the North of Europe fishing gained a more prominent place, in Siberia hunting continued to the near exclusion of other economic pursuits. The earlier beginning of the change and at the same time the continuation of an almost purely hunting economy may be explained through the survival of the large Arctic fauna, including the mammoth, for a longer period of time than it did in the West after the general post-glacial changes in the Old World. This was due to the enormity of the territory and its comparatively sparser population than, say, in Eastern Europe. But at the same time the climatic changes also introduced the smaller animals of the wooded landscape, encouraging, necessitating the development of new hunting techniques, of different types of artifacts. This was the reason why, for in- stance, the late "Magdalenian" layers of Afontova II and of Verkholenskaya Gora contained remains of domesticated dogs (Gromov, 1948: 319, 371). Thus, the earliest instance of the dog being man's helper-this again underlining the high degree of development in hunting-occurred in Siberia earlier than in any other part of the world. 2. The second major point concerns the different line of development in the working of stone. By seemingly returning to "Mousterian" techniques, the Upper Pale- olithic of Siberia escaped the unilateral refinement of making all tools from flakes, a medium which reached its limits in the Tardenoisean microlithic industry of the West. Siberia not only missed most of these micro- lithic developments (at the time of their Western Magdalenian beginnings) but went through a stage of macrolithic technique though in different form from the much later Maglemose and Campignian. In Siberia, the working of large pebbles did not result in the Chellean or Acheulean type of single-pointed hand ax but in a true axe of massive appearance and with a wide cutting edge.3 These axes are not comparable to those of the Western Mesolithic. In Siberia hewing and digging tools, such as pickaxes or trenchers where the blade was formed by a characteristic chipping blow,4 are not found. The earlier Siberian axes and adzes from Afontova Gora and Verkholenskaya Gora had, as a rule, the shape of longitudinally split large pebbles retouched to form a straight edge (Bonch-Osmolovsky and Gromov, 1936: Verkholenskaya Gora axes in pl. 2, 7, 8, 13). 3. This particular type of Late Paleolithic complex, having established itself in Siberia early, retained its forms to the very end, i.e. we find a slowing of the tempo. In this sense it may be said that the Western terminal Paleolithic forged ahead of the Siberian. That this was so was revealed by the contents of two ter- minal Paleolithic sites, one at the mouth of the Belaya River, the other near Olenki village at the mouth of the Ulyashnaya River.5 The inventory of these sites was essentially the same as that made by their remote ancestors at Afontova Gora and Verkholenskaya Gora. Yet, by this time the landscape was changed from steppe to taiga and the fauna was utterly different. The same two sites provided additional information. The upper- most 40 centimeters contained Serovo type ceramics and stone work. Later, with still other information con- sidered, we will see that this had its role in confirming the direct development of the Eastern Siberian Neolithic from a local, earlier, and independent Siberian culture complex. Although the transition between the Paleolithic and Neolithic periods of Siberia started somewhat later than in Europe, it must have progressed rapidly. There are not many Mesolithic sites in comparison with Neolithic and Paleolithic ones. This very paucity of Mesolithic sites-in an area which revealed numerous Paleolithic and Neolithic ones-may be taken as support for a rather rapid transition. Arrowheads, testifying to the presence of the bow and arrow, were one of the principal heralds announcing this transition. They were found in all of the Angara Valley Neolithic and Eneolithic sites-from Isakovo to Glazkovo times. They were so advanced in form and technique that it cannot be presumed that they arose only with the Neolithic. However, up to very recent times the link had been missing. This had not been the case in Europe and Africa. There, the precursors of Neolithic arrowheads were connectable to a number of microlithic artifacts. The trapezoids served, for in- stance, as obliquely edged arrowheads and together with them were found, as early as the Azilian, long-bladed 3Not to be confused with the scrapers described earlier. 4 As described, for instance, by Clark, 1936: 102. 5 Both rivers are small tributaries to the Upper Angara.</page><page sequence="36">VOL. 48, PT. 2, 1958] THE ORIGIN OF THE BAIKAL NEOLITHIC 37 KID~~C CD N~~~~~~~~~~~ FIG. 9. Inventory of the Pad' Chastye burial, 7/12. (After Okladnikov. ) arrowheads. There were many variants of these bear- ers of a Mesolithic technique but all of them were basically thin, knife-like blades with a pointed end, typical microlithic short faceting at the very end of the blade, with at least one shoulder at the base (Clark, 1932: 104-105; 181, fig. 37, items 4, 8, 9; 195, fig. 46, items 20, 21, 22. Clark, 1936: e.g. 56, fig. 16). In the European part of the Soviet Union this type of artifact has been found in a number of places and has been dated to the Late Mesolithic. It would seem, then, that the evolution of the Baikal arrowheads should have the same kind of background as it did in the West and that this background should have taken place in the relative'ly short period between the Paleolithic and the fully developed Neolithic. The link has been finally furnished by Okladnikov's dis- covery of two Mesolithic sites in the Angara Valleya- Khina and Chastye. One of the major reasons why these sites may be dated to a very early period of the Lake Baikal cultures is the presence of arrowheads with specific traits which indicate unexpected agreement with the known Western Mesolithic arrowheads (Okladni- kov, 1950: 157). The Chastye site, unfortunately a disturbed one, was excavated in 1934. Aside from other stone artifacts (slate needles, microblades), it contained two arrow- heads (fig. 9). The Khina site was preserved in toto. In it were found both retouched and unretouched microblades, as well as other artifacts of stone and bone-end-points, a slate needle (fig. 10). The type of inventory in both of these sites was in essential agreement. Of greatest interest were, of course, the arrowheads. Like the Swiderian arrow- heads they were manufactured from thin, considerably long blades, but are appreciably narrower than the Swiderian ones. They were in various stages of re- touching, as the illustrations show. Two from each site had a shouldered base. j~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~I.1 . FIG. 10.

Lower half: Microlithic flint artifacts from Budun Bay. Upper half: Flint artifacts from Zabaikal sites, 1Y2. (After Okladnikov.) In other Baikal sites arrowheads with shoulders of this type were also rarely found, but they were without ties to valid material complexes of defined periods. To the latter belonged the surface finds at the same Chastye site and the Ust'-Tushamsk site.6 Some of the sites on the shores of Lake Baikal also contained similar types of artifacts. Among them was the Budun Bay site where the arrowheads were accompanied by other flint artifacts of Mesolithic appearance including burins and retouched microblades (fig. 11). In the Zabaikal 7 shouldered arrowheads were found in eroded draws in several localities: the Selenga-Chikoi raion (4 arrowheads), the Uda Basin (5), the Onon 8 and Ingoda Basins (7). These Zabaikal sites also con- tained microblade points without retouched shoulders, typologically in agreement with such points from Chastye and Khina. There were also sites, in the Zabaikal region, among them wind-eroded draws, which contained remains (in- cluding ceramics) representative of the fully developed Neolithic. These remains, however, can be readily separated from the typologically earlier Khina artifacts just described. 6 The Tusham is a small tributary to the Ilim which joins the Angara River below Bratsk. 7 The region immediately east of Lake Baikal. 8 World Aeronautical Chart 200, 4th ed., Feb. 1952, gives the spelling "Ona." Further to the east, in the Amur River Valley and on the banks of the Tsitsikar River in Manchuria, blade points and arrowheads similar to those from the Khina and Chastye sites were also found. For instance, in 1903 Gondatti excavated some fifty stone artifacts at Radevskaya Station in the Upper Amur Valley.9 At the time they were classified as "Neolithic" but among them were found two complete willowleaf-shaped blade arrowheads and five fragmentary ones. Similar finds were made by Sergeyev (in the Shilka River dunes near Kokua on the Transiberian railroad) and Shiroko- gorov (at the headwaters of the Amur and near Blagoveshensk).10 In all of these sites, the arrowheads were accompanied by other artifacts of archaic appear- ance, principally scrapers (Okladnikov, 1950: 160). The Zabaikal finds may be tied in with other steppe regions as well-the Lower Povolzhe 11 and Central Asia. Beautiful examples of blade arrowheads were seen among the surface collections from the Povolzhe. Here, as in the Zabaikal, they were accompanied by microlithic stone artifacts of Tardenoisean form-trape- zoids, obliquely cut blade-points, microblades and end- scrapers. True, there were also bilaterally retouched arrowheads. Some of them (as in the Khina burials of the Pribaikal) may have been chronologically very early, others representative of a much later period, perhaps not even Neolithic (Efimenko, 1924: 211- 228). In Central Asia variants of blade arrowheads were found among the remains of the Kelteminarsk culture. There they had two principal forms: (a) blades with a very long, shouldered tang occupying almost two- thirds of the arrowhead's length, (b) blades with an obliquely cut point, such as found in the Tardenoisean (Tolstov, 1940: fig. 14; Tolstov, 1948: 62, pl. II, fig. 3). Could these be traces of a much earlier Epipale- olithic culture ? More recent finds in Turkmenistan, on the Krasnovodsk peninsula, would seem to support this. There, typologically much earlier arrowheads were found. They are very similar to the Azilian arrowheads of Western Europe and the Capsian of Africa. But, in the same localities, there were also found complexes of a later period where, together with blades, miniature scrapers, and gravers, there appear crude ceramics-the earliest in Central Asia (Boriskov- skii, 1947: 3-8; Okladnikov, 1949a: 67-71).12 Analogous Epipaleolithic traditions are apparent even in the "wooded" Neolithic in the North of European Russia where, longer than anywhere else, similar arrow- heads persisted. Of them Foss wrote: 9 Never published according to Okladnikov. Now in the State Historical Museum (Moscow?). 10None were published. Now in the U.S.S.R.

In the south and center of Eastern Europe they are character- istic of the early phase of the Neolithic, in the north they are assignable to the early period of the culture under consideration 13 (Foss, 1947: 69). Finally, the sub-Arctic zone of Yakutia also revealed such relict arrowheads associated with the local Ne- olithic. Okladnikov reported them for the Lower Lena and Kolyma basins (Okladnikov, 1946). A deduction that the Khina arrowhead represented the earliest step in the evolution of the later, bilaterally retouched arrowhead is not contradicted by the associa- tion of these arrowheads with other bilaterally retouched artifacts. The dart and spear points from Khina burial no. 1 are similar to those from the Late Paleolithic sites of Ushkanka and Verkholenskaya Gora where they were also retouched on both sides and were laurel-leaf in shape. The Khina dart and spear points had, then, their precursors in the Upper Paleolithic of Siberia. However, the same deduction could not be applied to the origin of the microblade arrowheads. Among the several thousand end-points from the Upper Paleolithic of Siberia there was not one which revealed similar form or technique, not one which could be called an "an- cestor" to the Khina type. Therefore, Okladnikov proposes that this microlithic form of artifact did not have its roots in the "macrolithic" tradition of the local Paleolithic, but has to be connected to those nearby regions where a microlithic culture could have and actually did develop earlier. He looks to the steppe regions of the Zabaikal and the Upper Amur (where, as we have seen, the archaic type of arrowhead was widely dispersed) as likely furnishing the immediate- not the ultimate-precursor of the Khina arrowhead. He reasons that the necessity for the bow and arrow was more pressing in the steppe regions than in wood- lands where the mode of hunting retained for a longer period of time its Magdalenian cast without radical changes. The penetration of the single-shouldered blade arrowhead into the Baikal region is interpreted by Okladnikov as the earliest contact of the steppe cultures with the very different woodland cultures (Okladnikov, 1950: 162-164). IX. THE ISAKOVO PERIOD In the Lake Baikal region the Khina took the place of analogous cultures in the West: the Tardenoisean, the Maglemose, the Campigne. The Isakovo repre- sented a phase which underlined the earlier position of the Khina in manifesting a thoroughly Neolithic evolvement of its techniques. In part, it also filled the gap between the terminal stages of the Paleolithic and the fully developed Neolithic represented in the Baikal region by the Serovo. 13 I.e. the thirteenth-eleventh centuries B.C. (Foss, 1948: 65; for illustrations see ibid., 62, fig. 29, items 1-3). Up to the time of Okladnikov's archaeological works in the Baikal region, the three periods just mentioned (Khina, Isakovo, Serovo) were unknown to earlier in- vestigators, remained lost, so to speak, among the mass of archaeological material. Okladnikov excavated the first burials of the Isakovo type in 1939 near the village of Isakovo in the vicinity of Bratsk. Burials uncovered since or un- covered before 1939 and subsequently assigned to the Isakovo period, have been enumerated in Chapter V. So far, no habitation sites of the Isakovo period have been discovered in the Angara Valley proper. How- ever, on the Upper Lena there was discovered the habitation site of Biryulsk which, as mentioned earlier, was an Isakovo-Serovo transitional site. Eight kilo- meters upstream from Biryulsk the settlement of Byk was found; here Isakovo type ceramics were found in the lower layers (Okladnikov, 1950: 166). These manifestations are few (altogether twelve burials and two settlements) but suffice to show that the Isakovo spread over at least the same considerable territory as did the culture that followed-the Serovo. It is likely that Isakovo type sites will be found in territory neighboring on the Baikal, i.e. in the basins of the large rivers of East Siberia, since already Serovo type sites have been found there. However, with all their widespread distribution, the relatively few Isakovo sites imply a period of short duration and, perhaps, of sparse population. The pottery of the Isakovo period was an impor- tant element which separated it from other Neolithic periods of the Lake Baikal region. Pottery was found in six of the burials. There were four complete vessels, relatively small, the largest being 23 cm. in height and 20 cm. in diameter. The form is simple, but characteristic: no neck, no lip inversion or eversion, a conical bottom (fig. 12). Sometimes there is a slight irregularity in the thickness of the wall or a departure from a true paraboloid half-section. Sometimes there is a variation in the lip which is brought to a sharp ridge rather than being flattened as shown in the illustrations. In some cases the wall near the mouth of the vessel is slightly thickened, as is the "point of the bottom." The average thickness of the wall is 0.5 cm. When these friable vessels are freshly broken, the break will show a black or reddish-brown color. The clay was admixed with quartz and granite and, in the case of the Bratsk ceramics, local traprock. Additionally, vegetable filler was often used. The inside of most vessels is smooth, although im- pressions of thumbs and other dents are occasionally found in some. The outside of the vessel is completely covered with what has been called "textile" impressions. Actually these are the knots and twisted threads of nets. They are plainly visible, the individual meshes of the net appearing as rectangles or, with the stretch-</page><page sequence="39">40 MICHAEL: NEOLITHIC AGE IN EASTERN SIBERIA [TRANS. AMER. PHIL.

Other ornamentation is simple-usua'lly a series of round, shallow pits arranged to form a horizontal line just below the rim, or, if the lip is flat, directly on that flat surface. Only in one case, instead of the round pits there was a series of "commas" on the outside be- low the lip, and what is unusual, also on the inside wall (fig. 12, upper left). Some of the earlier investigators interpreted these net impressions on Siberian pottery as impressions of baskets in which the vessels were supposed to have been made. This method is well documented and its use was widespread, particularly in the North American Southwest and even in the Far East (Martin, Quimby, and Collier, 1947; Ohyama, 1930: E.11-E.41). How- ever, up to the present no vessels made in baskets have been found in East Siberia (Okladnikov, 1950: 170). Okladnikov regards the use of netting an advance over the use of basketry. He proposes that the pliable net was constructed solely for the purpose of making vessels, whereas the solid basket had a dual role. The making of pottery in a net requires higher skill than the use of baskets, where the clay is mere'ly pressed onto the inner wall of the basket. A modified method may also have been utilized in the making of Siberian net- impressed vessels. A pit may have been fashioned in the ground, "lined" with a net, the vessel completed in it, and then lifted out in the net. This is known to be a contemporary practice in the Andaman islands (Okladnikov, 1950: 171). At any rate, what is known at the present about the ceramics of the Isakovo period allows the conclusion that, from a purely technological point of view, they represent the most primitive and earliest ceramics found in the Baikal region. Incomplete studies of net-impressed ceramics indi- cate that this technique probably did not arrive to the Isakovo people from the west, as Gorodtsov once thought (Gorodtsov, 1935: 111). The shape of the vessels, the mode of net-making, even the materials for making the nets, are too different. Some investigators of cultures of Southeast Asia and of the Far East in general pointed out the antiquity of net-impressed pot- tery there and its westward spread all the way to the Baltic coast (Menghin, 1931). This would include the Baikal area also, but Okladnikov vigorously objects: . . .as far as the "textile ceramics" of the Pribaikal are concerned, and as earlier representatives clearly show, . . . these were original ceramics of the Pribaikal, developing on an autochthonous base from the carrying nets of Pale- olithic hunters, following from the very beginning their singular line of development, and as we shall see later, sticking to it in subsequent times (Okladnikov, 1950: 172). The Isakovo ceramics were characteristic enough in themselves to delimit an important formulative period in the Siberian Neolithic. In addition, the stone work also figures as an important element in the study of the development of another basic technique-the polish- ing of stone. First, the raw materials from which the artifacts were made will be considered. In the Angara and Lena basins there is no stone which could compare, in desirable properties, to the flints from the chalk deposits of Eastern Europe; here are not found even large pieces of silicified limestone, so that from the earliest culture known for the Baikal region-the Mal'ta-the toolmakers had to use other kinds of stones for the manufacture of large-sized arti- facts: quartzite, jasper, and the various schists (shale, slate). For larger tools, especially adzes, the Isakovo people used a dark-gray cherty slate. The properties of this stone no doubt encouraged the development of stone polishing. In this connection it is interqsting to note that the earlier Khina people used a much softer slate. The adzes of the Isakovo period manifest the initial stages of the polishing technique (figs. 13, 14, 15). In these tools there is a tendency for the profile to be asymmetric. The asymmetry is caused by a rounded ridge running along the long edge of the tool (fig. 13) or by a one-sided slant of the cutting edge. A good many of these adzes are troughed almost the whole</page><page sequence="40">VOL. 48, PT. 2, 1958] THE ISAKOVO PERIOD 41 FIG. 13. Large adze from burial no. 10 of the Ponomarevo mound. 1/2. (After Okladnikov.) length of the "underside" while the back of the tool is convex (fig. 13). In the Isakovo adzes the major part of the surface is polished and only rarely are the ridges of the initial chipping preserved. At times the long edges are also smoothly polished but more often they are secondarily retouched. The butt is retouched more often than not. Okladnikov sees in this secondary retouching a pre- served influence of Paleolithic and Mesolithic techniques (Okladnikov, 1950: 176). The numerous arrowheads found in Isakovo sites underline the importance of the bow and arrow. They also reveal very nicely the degree of manufacturing technique that the Isakovo people reached. Generally, they are rather large, carefully retouched on both sides, in form usually elongated triangles with very slightly convex sides. The principal differentiating trait of the arrowheads is the concave, asymmetric base, i.e. the deepest point of the base is not aligned with the long axis. In addition, one of the barbs is usually longer and thicker. These large arrowheads are one of the most characteristic and expressive elements of the Isakovo period. Asymmetrically barbed arrowheads persisted into the Kitoi period but their size became progressively smaller and the manner of retouching changed (Chapter XIII). The type described above was characteristic only of the Isakovo period (fig. 16). We have seen earlier that the Zabaikal finds and the points with unilateral barbs from Khina and Chastye were analogous to the end-points of the Western Mes- olithic. In turn, the Isakovo arrowheads can be evo'lu- tionally connected to the asymmetrically barbed points from Khina and Chastye. An analogous connection was proposed for the "Cantabrian" arrowheads of the Solutrean in Spain (Obermaier, 1925: 106, fig. 43; 206, fig. 91), namely, they were traced to the much earlier Aurignacian points with a notched base. Symmetrically stemmed arrowheads of cherty slate were also found in Isakovo sites (fig. 16, top). This type became predominant in the next period, the Serovo, but here it was found in only two of the burials. In the most archaic burials of Isakovo type-in the Pono- marevo mound-no symmetrically stemmed arrowheads were found. So far, remains of the bow were not found in Isakovo sites. Nevertheless, the presence of arrowheads leaves no doubt that the bow and arrow were used. It must have been a simple, wooden, non-composite bow, not preserved because of the nature of the material. \~~ ~ _ A SW'S~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~I LI FIG. 14.

Like their Paleolithic prototypes, the Isakovo shafts are rounded in cross-section (fig. 17), not flattened like later Siberian side-bladed artifacts. Another similarity between the side-blades of the Isa- kovo and the Paleolithic may be derived from the descriptions of Gorodtsov; he wrote that the side-blades of Afontovo II were not secondarily retouched on the edge that was to be inserted in the groove (Gorodtsov, 1929). Neither were those from Isakovo sites. Judged from a technical point of view, the side-blades may be divided in two groups: (1) those which are secondarily retouched to form a series of small, equally spaced dentations, oriented in one direction, (2) those which, in addition to the dentation, are retouched from one side to form a unilaterally sloping blade (on cross- section). The dentations were added after the side had been retouched (sloped). To appreciate this technique, the Isakovo side-blades should be compared with later Serovo and Kitoi blades which are secondarily retouched all over and then addi- tionally thinned by removal of very thin and narrow chips of the stone material. These later blades are Another element pointing to the antiquity of the Isakovo culture and to its rooting in the Paleolithic is the composite spear point, that is, a point made by fitting carefully shaped stone "insert" blades into a groove cut in a long bone of an animal, usually a rib (fig. 17). This type of artifact was widespread in the Paleolithic of Northern Asia (Gorodtsov, 1929). Bone daggers with stone inserts (side-blades) have been found at Verkholenskaya Gora, Afontova Gora near Krasnoyarsk, and Kamennyi Log on the Yenisei (Sos- novskii, 1935: 125-151; Sosnovskii, 1935a: 152-218). Isakovo spearheads with side-blades are close in form not only to the Verkholenskaya Gora type but also to the spearheads of a much earlier site-Mal'ta. In many aspects they also resemble the classical hunting imple- ments of Magdalenian and earlier times in Western Europe-the well-known javelin points. The form of FIG. 16.

(After Okladnikov.)</page><page sequence="42">VOL. 48, PT. 2, 1958] THE ISAKOVO PERIOD 43 also retouched to a truly rectangular form in contradis- tinction to the Isakovo ones. True, rectangular blades retouched on both sides were also found in Isakovo burials although never as bilateral "inserts" of the archaic type but as separate, unilaterally-bladed knives (fig. 18). The side-bladed spearheads of the Isakovo differ from similarly manufactured daggers of the Late Paleolithic by their greater length (30-35 cm. on the average, 50 cm. maximum), the absence of a handle, and the round- ness of the grooved shaft. Because of this last char- acteristic they could have been used only for spearing, not for cutting or hacking. That these points were attached to spears may be deduced from their position in the graves. They were placed parallel to the body and pointed upward, that is, the preserved points were next to the head, and it may be presumed that the wooden shaft, before it rotted away, was a logical continuation of the point (Ponomarevo burials nos. 10, 13, 16). In two cases (Isakovo mound burial no. 2 and Ponomarevo burial no. 10) the spearheads lay just above the pelvis. Okladnikov proposes that these were short hunting spears on the order of the short spear-axe used by the contemporary Nanaiets and Nikhva, the so-called FIG. 17.

These may have been put into the hands of the deceased or lain across the body (Okladnikov, 1950: 185). The unilaterally-bladed composite knives, just men- tioned (p. 42), also have their roots in the Upper Paleolithic; however, the side-blades of these knives differ in several aspects from the blades of the spear points (fig. 18). The shaft is slightly bent and flattened in cross-section. The grooving in the shaft is much deeper and wider. In differentiation from the spear points, the knife side-blades are wider and retouched overall. The blades, with exception of the distal end blade, have the shape of elongated rectangles. The distal blade usually comes to a point, thus has an ap- pearance of a triangle with one long side convex and the inserted side straight. In cross-section the blades usually have a lensoid shape and the inserted edge is always thinner than the cutting edge-although the inserted edge is not as finely retouched as the cutting edge. There is no space between the individual side-</page><page sequence="43">44 MICHAEL: NEOLITHIC AGE IN EASTERN SIBERIA [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. blades. A smooth junction was achieved by cutting the short ends of the blades in a chisel-edge manner so that when fitted together they overlapped. Upon closer examination, the triangle-like blades illustrated in figure 15 (top left) reveal the same tech- nique of preparation as do the knife side-blades just described. They are also knife side-blades which had been once inserted into wooden shafts, probably more curved than the bone shaft described in the preceding paragraph. Composite adzes were also found. The "inserts" for these are comparatively narrow but massive, the groove in the holding shaft very deep and wide. Isakovo oval and semilunar scrapers (fig. 18) again have their Paleolithic prototypes, for instance, at Verk- holenskaya Gora. Some of the scrapers, like the Pale- olithic ones, have a chisel-faceted edge, or at least part of the edge may be so treated. The presence of utilitarian objects made of mammoth ivory suggests a close time-relationship of the Isakovo and the Paleolithic. Although artifacts of mammoth ivory were found in later Neolithic periods of Siberia, they were always fashioned as ornaments and not as tools of utility like those of the Isakovo period (awl and side-bladed spear point from the Ponomarevo mound). Whether this suggestion has any validity or not, remains problematical. Giddings reported the use of mammoth ivory for utilitarian tools of the Kobuk River peoples of Northern Alaska in recent centuries (Giddings, 1952: 64, 79), as did Nelson (Nelson, 1899). Besides hunting, the Isakovo people gathered vege- table foods and roots. This may be deduced from the find of a bone hoe in the 1932 excavations at Bratskii Kamen'. Okladnikov proposes that the very large adze- like implements (which are more definitely triangular and thinner than the smaller adzes) may have served as hoes (Okladnikov, 1950: 186). "Household" tools of the Isakovo people are not very strongly represented: needles, awls, needle cases, stone knives, semilunar and discoid scrapers. A good illus- tration of a stone knife is given in figure 15. It was thinned to a cutting edge on one side and the other edge was blunted by secondary retouching. The artifact was then polished. In the case illustrated, the handle was fashioned by retouching. In others the handle also may have been polished. The thumb rested on the blunted long edge. The needle cases are cylindrical tubes made of long bones of birds. Some retain the slight curvature of the FIG. 19. A group of Isakovo burials.

The ornamentation is simple-a few "comma" incisions along the edges of the opening, some- times in two parallel "belts." The art of the Isakovo people is poorly preserved or expressed in the known materials. Ornaments are simple and crude. Most often we find boar's tusks which have been split along the longitudinal axis. The edges created by the cutting were then smoothed, polished, and a hole drilled for suspension. In two of the burials complete tusks were found. Deep grooves were cut into the hard material at both ends of the tusk-to hold the string by which it was suspended. Perforated pear-shaped beads of maral antler were also found in the burials. Isakovo graves were not lined with carefully placed stones as were the graves of later periods. After the body of the deceased had been placed in the grave pit, it was simply covered with natural flagstones or large river pebbles. At times parts of these stones showed above the earthen surface of the mound. The stone fill seldom exceeded the approximately two-meter length of the grave pit. All skeletons were found in an extended dorsal posi- tion. The hands were usually placed under the body, although skeletons with the arms simply alongside the body were also found. The orientation of the skeletons was "to the sun." The grave furniture was always evenly distributed alongside the deceased or on top of the body. The large vessels with conical bottoms were usually found at the feet or between the knees. Arrowheads, found most often in a separate heap with the sharp ends point- ing toward the feet, were usually located along one of the legs (fig. 19). The side-blade knives and spear- heads, adzes, awls, and other pointed instruments were deposited at the level of the pelvis or chest. To Okladnikov, the multiple, joint burials found in the Ponomarevo and Bratskii Kamen' mounds sug- gested a cohesiveness of family life, ideas of an after- world and the ultimate rejoining of family units in it (Okladnikov, 1950: 190). From the sparse materials of Isakovo times not much else can be interpreted. However, one thing is clear: the definite ties of the Isakovo to the Paleolithic and through them the underlining of the autochthonous nature of the Siberian Paleolithic which prevailed in those reaches of Siberia long millennia before the evolvement of the Isakovo Neolithic culture. As we have seen, the beliefs of some of the earlier investigators were quite contrary to this proposition. X. THE SEROVO PERIOD Only a few graves which belonged to the Isakovo period were found in the Angara Valley. However, graves of the period which followed, the Serovo, were uncovered in greater numbers. These graves were found at eighteen points between Irkutsk and Bratsk. In the Upper Lena Valley typical Serovo graves were also found between Kachuga in the south and Zhigalovo in the north. Across Lake Baikal, in the Selenga River Valley, Okladnikov excavated a Serovo type mound on Fofanova Gora near Kabansk. Serovo burials were also found far below Bratsk on the Angara River, and on the shores of Lake Baikal. In his Middle and Lower Lena Valley study, Okladnikov also was able to show some Serovo affinities with the Baikal region (Chapter XII). A. GENERAL TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENT The wide distribution of Serovo sites and with it an implied increase in population must have had for its basis improvements in technology with corresponding economic advancements. A progressive surge brought the Serovo people to a level of technique easily com- parable to Neolithic and Eneolithic cultures of most other areas. For instance, the mode of retouching, involving a secondary shallow retouching, reached in some of the Serovo artifacts a very high level of work- FIG. 20. Flakers from Serovo type burials.

(After Okladnikov.) manship which can hold its own when compared, say, to the fine artifacts of pre-dynastic Egypt, of Scandi- navia, or of North America. The technique is well known: initial chipping with a stone instrument, final retouching with bone flakers. No stone-chipping in- strunments were found in the burials but they were present in the habitation sites : split pebbles, 10 to 20 cm. in length, covered with dents at one end. Some- times these pebble flakers were grooved around the center, suggesting that they may have been hafted. The bone flakers are relatively thin shafts, rounded or half-rounded in cross-section (fig. 20). The mode of their usage is well known (cf. Barnes, 1947:p. 101-1 13) . Duiring Serovo times the polishing of stone became a widespread practice. Characteristic of polished ob- j ects were, for instance, the stone representations of fish (figs. 21 and 22). These will be discussed in some detail later in this chapter. Bone and wood were tsually worked with polished stone implements of flinty slate or, more rarely, of green nephrite. The knives used for this work were most often semilunar in appearance with the arc dulled by careful retouching and the straight working edge sharpened. (The "straight" working edge sometimes became slightly curved through use and repeated re- touching.) This type of knife was already present in the Isakovo materials and was so characteristic that it may be regarded as a special local, endemic type. In the Isakovo these knives were more angular than in the Serovo where the majority of them had their corners rounded (fig. 23). There was another type of knife, polished, with its sharp cutting edge curved slightly inwvard through use (fig. 23). Serovo sites contained numerous such knives, this pointing to their usefulness and versatility. Scrapers were almost equally numerous. The Serovo scrapers were usually larger and had fewer facets than those of later periods. They were varied in form: semilunar, almond-shaped, oval. The working edge was always curved. An unusual form was encountered in Bumazhkhino burial no. 1; there a small, semilunar scraper (5.0 x 2.5 cm.) was shaped in such a manner that it provided a "handle" for a firm grasp of the user. Without it, the use of this artifact would be awkward and limited. It has been often proposed by past investigators that scrapers were used in Eastern Siberia by women only. However, there is evidence that this type of artifact was used as often by men. Scrapers and retouched and tin- =~ I _ - m ~~ FIG. 22.

In the case of the males they were usually deposited to- gether with polished knives. There are numerous in- stances of this in Serovo burials (Malaya Mamyr' no. 1, Bratskii Kamen' no. 8, Gorodishche no. 1, Serovo no. 1, etc.). While-in the way of stone tools-knives and scrap- ers may have been the mainstay for most daily chores, other types of tools were needed for specialized tasks. Some of these were revealed through a fortuitous find of a stone workshop on Kamennii-Kezhemsk Island.1 Although it was located outside the main region of Serovo remains, it may be used to illustrate some of the stone techniques. Bones of animals, stone artifacts, and a few boulders were found on a small terrace of Kamennii-Kezhemsk Island. The preserved area was small, most of the terrace having been carried away by river erosion. Charred and broken bones-skulls and long bones of 1 In the Lower Angara Valley. birds with the joints (epiphyses) removed-were found scattered about a boulder-surrounded fire-pit. Mate- rials removed from the immediate vicinity of the fire-pit (some from under the stones) contained: (1) two large cores; (2) an adze-like artifact of flint 2 with a curved cutting edge; (3) a cutting implement of the same material; (4) a semilunar slate scraper; (5) an unusual draw-knife of polished slate. A bit deeper, again among animal bone fragments, there were found fragmented composite points with inserted side-blades of slate and chalcedony. The following may be deduced from an analysis of these materials: (a) The cores were in their initial stage of prepara- tion. The smaller core was actually a blank with a single sliver taken off. The larger was more finished, of conical shape, and had a carefully prepared platform. Similar cores were found in the Lenkovka site.3 There they were found below the general Neolithic level, in a small, separate pit. (b) The adze-like tool was carefully retouched on both sides. It was made of black, semi-translucent flint of high quality. Such flint is not found above the first Angara rapids, i.e. in the upper reaches of the Angara Valley. (c) The cutting implement 4 was also made from the same type of flint. The handle is massive, the sym- metrically curved working edge retouched to fine thin- ness. In appearance this artifact resembles a painter's spatula (9.5 x 3.5 cm.). (d) The unusual slate draw-knife-manipulated with both hands-was polished on both sides and had notches at both ends for hafting to handles. The dimensions: 15.8 x 5.2 cm. (e) The side-blades of one of the fragmented com- posite points were in situ. In addition to the usual grooving for the side-blades, other deep grooves (orna- mental?) were incised on the shaft. (f) The seven long bones of large birds were in various stages of manufacture. Some were straightened by removal of long slivers, probably with a draw knife. Some had the joints removed at both ends, in some only one joint was cut off. Some were ornamented with faint incisions in the form of "commas," others had deep incisions near the ends. In one case there was a deep incision running the length of the blank, ap- parently in preparation for splitting it. These, then, represent the initial stages in the manufacture of such artifacts as awls, sharp points, needles, and needle cases, all of which, as we have seen and will see, are common in the inventories of Baikal sites. Correlations between these unfinished artifacts and the tools found in association with them follow. For instance, the "cutter" and the draw knife are marked, 2 See explanation on p. 48. 3 In the Upper Angara Valley, below Buret'. 4 Okladnikov uses the term "rezak"-"cutter."</page><page sequence="47">48 MICHAEL: NEOLITHIC AGE IN EASTERN SIBERIA [TRANS.

The advanced degree of stone-working techniques in Serovo times is particularly well manifested in the symmetrically shaped adzes (figs. 24 and 25). Some twenty examples of these, recovered from datable graves, reveal advances in technique and new traits which were not present in the Isakovo. Like the earlier Isakovo adzes, they also were often troughed but always symmetrically and without a strong contour, that is, the troughs are very shallow. On this old basis new traits appeared. There was a tendency to more exact parallelness of both the long and short sides; the cross- section of the adze was more truly rectangular, its formerly sharp butt became dulled; the working edge was straight or almost straight in comparison to the definitely convex Isakovo edge. In part, this symmetry of the Serovo adzes was due to the nature of the flinty slate used for their manufacture. In several localities in the Upper Angara and Lena Valleys this type of slate occurs in horizontal slab deposits. ti;.'TT(r7a 114-~~~~ Ae~~~~~~~ FIG. 26. Artifacts from Serovo type burials.

Among such finds were the bone harpoons (fig. 26). They were not numerous, and yet they were strongly differentiated among them- selves. Considering at this time only one element- the mode of fastening to the shaft-five types are recognizable: (1) socketed; (2) unilaterally shouldered (open-socketed); (3) slotted; (4) pointed; (5) bi- laterally shouldered (fig. 26, bottom, right). Among these harpoons there was found also an unique example not duplicated anywhere in the whole range of the Siberian Neolithic: a unilaterally troughed harpoon with a double line of spurs on the parallel edges of the trough (fig. 27). It was made from the lower jaw of an elk (Siberian moose) or Siberian maral. FIG. 27.

Method of making ramrods among the contemporary Dolgans (after Popov). The bone bow-braces from Serovo graves are dis- tinguishable from any other archaeologically or eth- nographically known braces by their unusual length. The shortest braces are about 50 cm. in length; the longest one is 87 cm. (fig. 28a). The most usual raw material for the manufacture of bone artifacts during Serovo times consisted of the long bones of animals. But even the long bones of the then largest animals- the Siberian moose (elk) and the red deer-could not provide for a brace longer than 50 cm. Mammoth tusks are out of question, since without a preservation process they would break when taken out of the ground and cut into slivers. The most logical sources for these long bow-braces seem to be elk or red deer antlers. Fortunately, there is an ethnographic example which supports this projection. The contemporary Dolgans 5 still utilize the antlers of these animals to make ramrods of about one meter in length. The cutting, splitting, and straightening of these antlers is a long and in- volved process (fig. 28b). True, this practice of the Dolgans is comparatively recent (Popov, 1937: 116- 117) but it is the only instance known for Siberia where slivers of such length are manufactured and indicates a possible answer to the mode of making the unusually long bow-braces for the Serovo bows. More will be said about the bows in evaluating the economic pattern of the Serovo period. The ceramics of the Serovo period show a definite break from those of the Isakovo tradition.

(After Okladnikov.) was expressed in changes of form, ornamentation, and even purpose. The older Isakovo form of vessel, "paraboloid" in cross-section, disappeared and was re- placed by one with nearly spherical body, wide bottom, and sometimes a faint indication of a neck (figs. 29, 30, 31). This vessel was smaller than its Isakovo predecessor and was more rationally executed. The awkward Isakovo conical pot which was top-heavy, with a wide opening enabling the "fire-dirt" to get into it easily, was replaced by this new form which also had lugs or holes for suspension. Net-impressed surfaces became less common than in the Isakovo and were of a different finish. Contrary to prevalent Isakovo practice, they were smoothed and at times almost obliterated before the vessel was fired. The walls of many of the Serovo vessels were con- siderably thinner than those of the Isakovo. This was achieved, in part, by the use of improved clay mixtures. The Serovo potter admixed his clay with sand and small-sized gravel thus strengthening the final product. With this improved clay mixture the walls could be thinned by paddling. The uniform surface of the curved paddle left the walls of such vessels smooth and only in a few instances were some of the original net-impressions preserved. The use of a paddle on the outside and an "anvil" on the inside in the final stages of pot-making also made the shaping of new forms possible, forms which could not be made in a net, i.e. could not be finished in a net. Of course, all of this applies to some of the vessels only. The old technique of pasting-resulting in a cruder vessel-persisted side by side with the new one. In the way of ornamentation, the "comb" technique appeared for the first time in the Baikal Neolithic during Serovo times. At first, the comb impressions were separated and consisted of only a few "comb series" applied irregularly to the surface of the pot. Later, the comb impressions were applied in lines or belts which were more or less continuous. Slate was sometimes used for the manufacture of the comb-stamps. Such slate stamps have been found at Ulan-Khada and elsewhere. Some of the stamps, not necessarily the slate ones, were troughed, so that the impression they made in the soft clay was crescentic (fig. 29c). A fairly common mode of ornamentation was the use of lentil-shaped convexities made by pushing the clay above the general outer surface with a blunted stick applied from the inside (fig. 31, items 1 &amp; 2). Also fairly characteristic were the pots with variously shaped perforated and solid lugs. At times these lugs were decorated with comb impressions. Despite these technical advances, ornamentation of pots, on the whole, remained relatively simple, yet more complex than the single or double line of pits placed below rims that we have seen in Isakovo vessels. b FIG. 30.

Serovo type vessel. 4 &amp; 5. Flint tools. The complete vessel is Y4 natural size, the other artifacts 7A6 natural size. (After Okladnikov.) Typically, the entire neck (as faintly as it may have been indicated) was covered with simple incisions or impressions (fig. 29, items a &amp; c). Rarely, the body proper of the vessel was also ornamented. Good examples of a rather unusual Serovo type of suspendable vessel came from the Malaya Mamyr' and Zhigalovo sites. These vessels have the shape of an egg sitting on its wider, spherical end, with the upper third of the more pointed end cut off. The rim is smooth. The unusual characteristic of these vessels is the mode of placing the lugs. There are usually three lugs, all of them placed on the same side of the vessel. Two of them are placed on a horizontal line near the rim. The third is near the bottom, on a vertical line drawn between the two upper lugs. Oklad- nikov suggests that the vessel was hung in a manner preventing it from becoming inclined and spilling its contents. Yet, by grasping the lower lug, it could be readily inclined while still suspended, and the contents poured out. I have experimented with this type of suspension and have found that Okladnikov's sugges- tion works out provided he used the wording "upright" in a freer connotation. With a two-point lateral sus- pension (the lugs being positioned on the vessel as described above) the vessel will incline about ten degrees to one side. This will allow the user of the vessel to fill it up to about four-fifths of its potential volume without danger of the liquid contents spilling while the vessel is suspended. With their two-point lateral suspension, these were unusual vessels. They were found not only in the two burial mounds mentioned but also in habitation sites throughout the region-on the Angara, the Upper Lena, as well as the Baikal shores. Okladnikov states that this type of suspendable vessel is peculiar to the Neolithic of the Baikal region as has been found in no other place (Okladnikov, 1950: 214). The technical progression of the Serovo material cul- ture should be evident from these few examples. There are other facets which indicate further progression. These will be discussed presently, in connection with the economic pattern. B. THE ECONOMIC PATTERN DURING THE SEROVO PERIOD The progression of technique reflected best in the manufacture of tools which were most important in the predominantly hunting economy of the Serovo people. The composite, side-bladed spearheads were improved (fig. 27, left); the shaft was flattened, the groove deepened, the side-blades finely retouched on both edges. Chalcedony and flinty materials were used for the side- blades. The dentations on the edge of the blades be- came larger-more effective for inflicting a wound. The Serovo composite spearheads were longer than their Isakovo precursors. Some may have been actu- ally used as daggers, since in a number of them the side-blades did not reach all the way to the blunt end of the artifact, thus providing it with a "handle." Much smaller non-composite bone points were also found in Serovo graves. They may have been used as dart or javelin points. Aside from bone and composite spearheads, almost every Serovo burial contained a number of leaf-shaped stone points, often with beautifully executed diagonal faceting and secondary retouching about the edges (figs. 32, 33, 34). In this they resemble some of the North American points. These Serovo points are more often flat in cross-section than not. Many of them have a slight narrowing at one of the points, i.e. one point of the leaf is sharper than the other. Sometimes they were made of higher grade imported6 flinty material. Depending on the mode of attachment, these "points" could have served either as "knives-daggers" or spear- heads. In some cases it is possible to tell that an artifact of this form was used as a knife, because its edges were smoothed. A spear point would not show the same type of polishing. That this was the case is 6 From the lower reaches of the Angara.</page><page sequence="51">52 MICHAEL: NEOLITHIC AGE IN EASTERN SIBERIA [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. FIG. 32.

For instance, they were found together with other artifacts of "domestic usage"-among them knives with a curved edge-next to the pelvis of the deceased, a spot typically reserved for such implements. Sixteen examples of composite bows are known from the Pribaikal Neolithic: fifteen from the Upper Angara Valley, one from the Upper Lena Valley. These six- teen bows were associated with fourteen burials. The bows accompanied not only male burials but those of women and children as well; they were always placed parallel to the body. In two cases the bow was broken before interment. The composite bows were usually strengthened with two braces; in one case there were three. With ad- justment for the overlap of the wooden parts considered,' the total length of the bows was considerable: the shortest was one meter, the longest about one-and-a- half meter. With the small-statured Neolithic popula- tion (determined from skeletal remains) this meant that the average bow was approximately the height of a man. The preserved braces are from 34 cm. to 87 cm. long, about 1.5 cm. wide, and from 0.3 cm. to 1.4 cm. thick. FIG. 33. Stone daggers from Serovo period mounds.

Although fine specimens, they were not, however, comparable with the more advanced composite bows of Neolithic and Bronze Age Central Asia or Neolithic Egypt. In many cases the Serovo bows were adorned with pendants as are, for instance, the bows of some of the contemporary Oceanic tribes. The pendants were usu- ally tied to the lower part of the bow (as their position in some' burials indicated). Often perforated elk and maral teeth pendants were found in the proper relative position to where the lower end of the bow would be, were the wooden parts preserved (Verkhne Seredkino burial no. 1, Golomyska burial no. 1). As with many other elements of the Baikal Neolithic cultures, Okladnikov rejected the notion of a single diffusion center of origin for the composite bow. He referred specifically to the work of Luschan (Luschan, 1889: 232) who proposed Sumer as the center of in- vention for the composite bow. From there it was supposed to spread to India, North Siberia, and across the Bering Strait to North America. Direct comparisons of Serovo composite bows with bows contemporary or nearly contemporary to them yield a few interesting points. For instance, the com- posite bow from a burial of the first dynasty of Egypt 4 FIG. 35. Arrowheads from Serovo type burials.

So are those from the bogs of North European Russia 2 Lb.- FIG. 36. Stone representations of fish from Eastern Siberia (1, 2, &amp; 5), Y4 natural size.

(After Okladnikov.) and the Urals (Foss, 1941). In Japan,8 fine lacquered wooden bows of Neolithic times were also found pre- served in bogs. Only one of them was made from two pieces of wood but no bone was involved in their manu- facture (Okladnikov, 1946: 11-33). Thus, archaeologically and ethnographically there are no exact analogues of the Serovo bows, and this underlines anew their independent origin. The excel- lence of the Serovo bow must be explained by the highly developed hunting economy, great dependence on it, and the persistence of this economy far past times when some of the surrounding cultures advanced to animal husbandry or fishing as their principal means of livelihood (Okladnikov, 1950: 229). Arrowheads were found in practically all Serovo burials. Occasionally the asymmetrically barbed Isa- kovo type arrowhead was encountered, as was the symmetrically barbed, stemless type. But by far most typical were the stemmed arrowheads (fig. 35). They were large and heavy in comparison with later Ne- olithic and Eneolithic arrowheads. In the burials the arrowheads were usually found 8The Korekawa site on Honshu. in small heaps and pointing in one direction (fig. 35). A heap usually contained about forty arrowheads-the average for a quiver. At times two heaps, that is, two quivers, were deposited with the interred. The usual place for the quiverful of arrows was next to the hip or leg, seldom next to the elbow. Bone arrowheads, the majority of them blunted, were also found in the burials. As we have seen, the Isakovo graves did not contain any evidence which would point to the systematic practice of fishing. However, the contents of Serovo period sites indicate a change in this respect. The usual fishing implements (hooks, net sinkers, plummets, etc.) were found in association with fish bones. The har- poons,9 found in six of the Serovo graves, were of the usual Neolithic type (fig. 26). They were described earlier in this chapter.

The majority, 66, of the fish representations listed come from the Pribaikal. Some of them belong to later periods than the Serovo, some of them cannot be ac- curately dated. However, there is no doubt that they already appeared during the Serovo period. The docu- mentable Serovo finds are the following: Ulan-Khada, Mamyr', Nizhne Seredkino, and perhaps Korkino. For purposes of classification, stone representations of fish may be divided in four categories: 1. Wide-beamed, flat fish of the genus Cottidae (fig. 37, top and bottom). Some of the representations as- signed to this group are narrow, with a small head. They represent the eel-pout. In most cases the outline of the fish is schematic, general, but in a few instances (figs. 38, 39) the detail is considerable and depicts some of the minor characteristics of the genus. 2. The genus Salmo. In some cases the species can be recognized (lake salmon, etc.). There are not many of these (fig. 40, bottom). 3. Sturgeons. These are easy to separate, despite their stylization, because of the pointed snout, specific for the genus. 4. The "Janus" group, i.e. two-headed fish. There are several examples of these (fig. 21, left; fig. 40, second from top). Within the above categories were found both large (30-50 cm.) and small (15-20 cm.) representations. In the Neolithic burials and such undisputed Neolithic settlements as Ulan-Khada only the small type was found. Most of the large representations were surface finds. Without exception, all of the stone fish were provided with bilaterally drilled holes for suspension. Most often the hole was drilled through the upper, spinal part of the fish and so located that, when suspended on a string, the fish remained balanced in a horizontal position. Less often holes were found also on the sides, at the tail, and rarely on the "abdominal" aspect. The "spinal" hole was the most carefully drilled. In the past, these fish representations were variously judged to be amulets, idols, or ceremonial objects which were supposed to secure a good catch. However, if we examine present-day ethnographic evidence in order to try to explain the use of these objects, it will suggest that they were probably used in a practical way, that they were important artifacts in the everyday task of fishing among the Arctic and sub-Arctic peoples. For instance, Nelson reports numerous examples of small- sized representations of fish (of stone, ivory, and other materials) used as sinkers by the Chukchee and Eskimo and sometimes provided with hooks attached to the front part of the fish. The hooks were either of ivory or iron, large or small, or in combination. They were lashed to the eyeholes drilled into the fish-like sinkers FIG. 41. Bone fish lures of the Evenki. (After Levin.) (Nelson, 1899: 180-183).10 Similar eyeholes were also found in the Neolithic examples. Another category of these fish-like artifacts can be associated with a less known mode of fishing, one that is perhaps close to Neolithic practices. The Essei Yakuts,11 the Kereks,12 and the Aleuts used realistically prepared fish representations-to the point of stretching real fish skin over the artifact and providing it with artificial eyes-as lures attached by a short string to a fish spear. This combination was used in winter fishing through the ice. Members of the 1927 and 1929-1930 expeditions of Levin observed the same practice for the Pribaikal and Lower Tunguska Evenki (Levin, 1936: 76; also, see fig. 41). Earlier ethno- graphic evidence of Pallas ascribed this mode of fishing to the Northern Nentsi 13 (Pallas, 1788: 113). Boas de- scribed this practice for the Central Eskimo, among whom an ivory lure (exalujang) was used when the 10 Similar sinkers, provided with hooks, are also stored in the Siberian Section of the Museum of Anthropology and Ethnology in Leningrad. They were collected by Voznesenskii on St. Lawrence Island in 1845 (Okladnikov, 1950: 252). 11 Essei Lake in Yenisei Krai. 12 The northernmost Koryaks. 13 Samoyeds.</page><page sequence="56">VOL. 48, PT. 2, 1958] THE SEROVO PERIOD 57 salmon did not run "heavy" (Boas, 1888: 514). That the precursors of the Central Eskimos also used fish representations as lures was supported by the archaeo- logical materials excavated by Mathiassen ( 1927: pl. 11, figs. 9, 10, 11, 12; pl. 43, figs. 6, 7; pl. 73, fig. 8). Elsewhere in North America both archaeological and ethnographic evidence points to the use of stone, bone, and wooden lures among the Algonquian peoples. After successful luring, the fish was caught with a net or it was speared (Willoughby, 1935: 48-49). The Neolithic fish representations agree in many respects with the ethnographic examples just cited. The size is comparable, the suspension hole is drilled in the same place, and various "secondary" holes are drilled in the relative positions of the fish's fins, so that they could be used to "dress" the lure. That the Neolithic, or at least Serovo, fish repre- sentations were used as lures rather than as sinkers with hooks or as baited lures, is also suggested by the relationship and types of fish-hooks that were found in Serovo sites. Two types are known: the simple hook and the composite hook. There is only one example of the first type (fig. 26, top), a sharply curved bone hook with no indications in its structure that it was lashed or tied. However, the flattening of the shank- which ends in a wedge-indicates that it was sus- pended by being forced into a slot in a piece of wood or other material. This type of hook is very old; it has been found in the kitchen middens of Denmark, in Palestine, and also in northeastern Japan (Clark, 1936: 113 ff. and fig. 43, items 10, 11, 12; Clark, 1948: 52). Perhaps it is not accidental that only one hook of this type is known from the Serovo. It probably signifies the introduction of a new mode of fishing just as it did in the Baltic area, where, for instance, only 14 such barbless 14 fish-hooks were found in Mesolithic sites (Sverdborg, Holmgaard, Maglemose) against 325 fish spears. The upper layers of Ulan-Khada and Tsar-Devitsa, which have been identified earlier in this work as representing the Late Serovo phase and the Early Kitoi, contained the second type of hook-the composite fish-hook. It also was described earlier. No composite fish-hooks were found in Serovo graves. This is not surprising when we consider the general paucity of fishing gear in the burials of this phase of the Baikal Neolithic. The net-sinkers of the Serovo period (fig. 36) prove, of course, the use of nets in fishing, and, from the evidence collected thus far, point to the earliest mani- festation of net-fishing in Eastern Siberia. C. SOCIAL ORGANIZATION The one element of social organization which is clear from the contents of Serovo graves is the equality of 14 Clark's terminology. a b FIG. 42. a. Remains of Serovo period headgear from Goro- dishche burial no. 1. b. Bratskii Kamen' burial no. 8. (After Okladnikov.) social status of the sexes. All of the graves of adults, both male and female, contained essentially the same inventory and were similarly oriented. Typical Serovo grave furnishings are illustrated in figure 42b. As a rule, a grave included: (a) bow and arrows; (b) clay vessels; (c) polished slate or green nephrite adzes; (d) polished slate knives; (e) side-bladed spearheads (less commonly) or "laurel-leaf" knives. During the Serovo, then, there is no differentiation between male and female burials such as is implied for the Eneolithic Glazkovo period which has its "rich" and "poor" graves. Following the tenets of the Soviet school, Okladnikov went further than this, and asserted that archaeological evidence coupled with known ethnographic examples implies a matriarchal social organization for the people of the Serovo period. He called upon L. H. Morgan's "Ancient Society" with its Iroquois examples for ethno- graphic support 15 and also cited Krasheninikov's and Steller's accounts of the Itelmens 16 as an example of a society in transition from matriarchy to patriarchy (Okladnikov, 1950: 266-271 passim). 15 Since 1950, when Okladnikov's major work on the Baikal region had been published, the Soviet school of ethnological theory has considerably modified its outlook in regard to Morgan's work (Tolstov, 1951: 3-14; Tokarev and Chebok- sarov, 1951: 7-26; et al.). 16 Kamchadals.</page><page sequence="57">58 MICHAEL: NEOLITHIC AGE IN EASTERN SIBERIA [TRANS.

Bottom: Detail from Ponomarevo burial no. 7. (After Okladnikov.) D. ART Boar tusk pendants, so common during the Isakovo, are extremely rare in Serovo sites. Their place is taken by necklaces of beads fashioned from maral ca- nines or pendants of elk incisors, through which a hole was drilled for suspension (fig. 43). In the Serovo there also appeared for the first time small (3-4 mm. in diameter), flat, circular beads with a hole through their centers. Most of these were made from thick sea shells and only rarely were there smaller beads (made from the shells of fresh-water mollusks). They were similar to the "money" shells of Oceania and America. As in North America the beads were sewn onto articles of clothing. Documentation of this came from Gorodishche burial no. 1 (fig. 42a). The beads, with parts of the string still preserved, were found about the head of the deceased; once they had been part of the headgear. Beads were also sewn onto footgear (Perevoznaya village near Krasnoyarsk and Nizhne Seredkino burial no. 1). The simple geometric ornamentation of the clay ves- sels was already described. Bone work was also simply ornamented with incisions-either single or rhythmi- cally grouped (figs. 44, 45). Aside from the representations of fish (which were both schematic and realistic), we find other zoomorphic pieces. Strictly speaking, these did not come from the Pribaikal. They were excavated from a Neolithic grave at Bazaikha on the Middle Yenisei. All were made of elk antler, and, from an esthetic point of view they are quite unusual (fig. 46). Another manifestation of Neolithic art is rock paint- ing, or rather rock drawing. Outstanding examples of this art were found on the face of the Shishkinsk cliff and near the village of Vorobevo-both on the Upper Lena. Rock drawings were also found in a number of places on the Middle Lena and on the Angara below and above Bratsk. The drawings were usually life- sized and chronologically covered the span of several millennia-from the Paleolithic to the fantastically com- plex drawings of the Late Bronze Age. They also nicely reveal the changes in style through the ages. Those illustrated here (fig. 47) are loosely assignable to the Neolithic. The documentation however, is very sketchy and it is based mostly on the "art in the round" _ 2 3 4 FIG. 44. Ornamented awls and needle-cases. 1. Contemporary Dolgan needle-case. 2.

(After Okladnikov.) from the Neolithic burials which reveal such points as the treatment of the eyes, etc. Another point may be gained from the Siberian rock drawings. They underline the importance of the elk through the long cultural span of Eastern Siberia. E. THE MODE OF BURIAL Unlike the Isakovo burial pits-which were simply filled with natural flagstones or large river pebbles after the corpse was deposited-the Serovo graves were, for the most part, carefully lined with flat stones or large river pebbles. These must have been selected for the purpose, since they were of approximately the same size. In some of the Serovo graves flagstones were lain horizontally on top of the interred body and filled the grave pit to the plane of the surface. Most of the Serovo burials were single, although a few cases of joint burials are known (fig. 48). All but two of the bodies were extended. In the two exceptions the lower extremities were only very slightly flexed and cannot be classified as flexed in the true sense of the term. The significance of the orientation of the skeletons was described earlier (Chapter IV). Differ- ences in orientation, as well as in chronology, are nicely emphasized in the case of a Glazkovo grave superim- posed on a Serovo one (fig. 49). The furnishings of the graves suggest a belief in after-life, as is so often the case with contemporary primitives. All of the basic implements for hunting, fishing, preparation of meals, and the manufacture of tools were there (fig. 48). Traces of "cremation," in two cases complete crema- tion, were found in five of the Serovo graves. Other Serovo graves-where partial or complete cremation was not carried out-contained remains of charcoal from fires which must have been lit for some purpose. What this purpose was can be only suggested by anal- ogies with ethnographic findings in the study of con- temporary primitives. Many such analogies are cited by Okladnikov (Okladnikov, 1950: 338-354 passim). For instance, among the Evenki, burial fires are not lit for any practical purpose but because of the belief in the magical properties of fire as a cleanser, protector, companion, and helper of men. This applies both to the deceased and to the survivor. In this connection it was noted by Bogoraz that a Chukchee who died of syphilis or other specific disease, could not be purified by fire, because the fire would become polluted (Bogoraz, 1904- 1909: 523). Many cases of the lighting of fires in FIG. 46. Figurines of elk antler from Bazaikha. (After Okladnikov.)</page><page sequence="59">60 MICHAEL: NEOLITHIC AGE IN EASTERN SIBERIA [TRANS. AMER. PHIL.

(After Okladnrikov.) connection with burials are known for the aborigines of North America (e.g. Tlingit, Algonquians). Many of the mythologies of primitive peoples reveal a close association of fire and the sun. In some of the languages the terms for these are interchangeable. Ideas like these could be applied to the coincidence, in the Serovo burials, of orientation to the sun and the pres- ence of remains from funerary fires. But "actually not enough attention has been paid to this problem in ethnological studies and there is much open territory for investigation" (Okladnikov, 1950: 354). XI. THE KITOI PERIOD In the upper Angara Valley, burials belonging to the Kitoi period were found in eight localities which col- lectively had forty-one graves (p. 17). To this period also belong several other burials and settlements out- side of the Upper Angara Valley: (1) burials near FIG. 49. Glazkovo grave (dotted lines) superimposed on Serovo grave.

(After Okladnikov.)</page><page sequence="60">VOL. 48, PT. 2, 1958] THE KITOI PERIOD 61 Yushino village, near Stepno-Baltaisk ulus, near Zhiga- lovo village-all in the Upper Lena Valley; (2) the habitation sites of Kuzmikha and Ulan-Khada-where, in the case of the latter, Kitoi artifacts are mixed with Serovo objects, particularly in the upper layers; (3) scattered finds of burials and individual artifacts in the lower reaches of the Angara, on the Yenisei near Krasnoyarsk, on the Baikal shores, and also in the Zabaikal. A. LEVEL OF TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT Generally speaking, the Kitoi has closer typological ties with the Serovo than to the period following it- the Glazkovo. Aside from the appearance of new arti- facts and the disappearance of some which had been very much in the fore during the Serovo, the changes are expressed mainly in the technique of manufacture and in the raw materials used. The large polished knives and adzes of dark gray cherty slate, so common formerly, are now very rare. They are replaced with polished adzes and knives of green nephrite. To illustrate this, let us recall that in the forty-one Kitoi graves of the Upper Angara Valley there were found only two slate adzes: one from the Tsiklodrom and one from Kitoi burial no. 6. In the Kitoi mound alone, the ratio of nephrite and slate artifacts is 25: 1. Toward the end of the Kitoi period the slate artifacts disappear altogether. Nephrite is a metamorphic rock usually found among crystaline cherts. The usual colors are the various shades of green and white. Nephrite, and its close mineralogical relative jadeite, is found in only two places in the territory of the Soviet Union, the Pribaikal and the Southern Urals. The mining and trading of jadeite in Alaska and British Columbia and the distribu- tion of the raw materials has been adequately described (Hodge [ed.], 1910: part 2: 55-56). Some of the stone from Jade Mountain in Alaska even reached the Chukchee Peninsula and the Aleutian Islands (Rudenko, 1947: 65, 87) as well as the mouth of the Mackenzie. In the Pribaikal there are two deposits of nephrite in the Kitoi River Valley. The stream of the river crosses one of these deposits and works the nephrite loose from the soft serpentine in which it is embedded. The nephrite is left as very large boulders in the bed of the river. These boulders were probably broken into smaller pieces by heating the rock and pouring water over it. (Some of the nephrite artifacts still retain parts of the water-worn surface of the original boulder.) There are indications that the inhabitants of the region where the nephrite was found prepared from it rough blanks which they then traded with neighboring peoples. Most of the nephrite artifacts excavated from sites on the Kitoi River were in semi-fabricated state. For instance, the Kitoi mound yielded twenty-five nephrite axes of which only four were completely fin- ished, i.e. polished, fifteen were only slightly polished- i1 ti "V ti : ' FIG. 50. Nephrite adzes, axe blank, and polished knife. All from the Kitoi mound. lA. (After Okladnikov.) mostly about the cutting edge-and six did not show any traces of polishing. Figure 50 shows some of these semi-fabricated artifacts. Another point to be made in connection with the nephrite artifacts concerns their size and distribution. The Kitoi mound, closest to the source of nephrite, contained artifacts very large in size-axes up to 40 cm. in length-whereas sites farther away from the source (up and down the Angara River and on the Upper Lena) contained small-sized nephrite artifacts which were nearly always finished, i.e. fully polished. Nephrite artifacts manufactured from the Kitoi stone were also found in distant regions, far away from the source of the raw material: the Lower Tunguska, the Yenisei Valley near Krasnoyarsk, the Minusinsk basin. In the Minusinsk basin the majority of the polished axes were made of local stone, with only a few manu- factured from the imported green nephrite. The Kitoi nephrite penetrated even farther to the west, right into the region of the gray-green Uralian nephrite. There, in the Poludensk site,1 most of the excavated nephrite objects were made from the local variety of nephrite but there were several made from 1 Dated by Bader to the end of the third, beginning of the second millennium B.C. (Bader, 1948: 80-81).</page><page sequence="61">62 MICHAEL: NEOLITHIC AGE IN EASTERN SIBERIA [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. the obviously more valued green nephrite from the Kitoi River deposits (Bader, 1947: 142). To the east of Lake Baikal, Kitoi nephrite axes were found in the Uda and Ingoda River Valleys. The axe from Bukharda in the Uda Valley is one of the best examples of Kitoi work. After these introductory remarks on the deposits of nephrite and the widespread distribution of artifacts made from this raw material, let us now turn to the techniques of manufacture. The "secret" of the in- creased utilization of this hard and tough material must have been the discovery of the Kitoi people that it readily lent itself to abrasive and cutting techniques where chipping techniques would have failed. The cutting and polishing were aided by sand and water. The recovered tools for working nephrite show that the cutting tools were always of harder stone than the polishing tools. Experiments conducted by Gorodtsov in the Irkutsk Museum proved this point as well as the general effectiveness of the process (Gorodtsov, 1935: 80-81). Similar techniques were also used by the Arctic woodland peoples on the Kobuk river (Giddings, '47 FIG. 51. Fragments of green nephrite with traces of sawing.

From the following period, the Glazkovo, there are even better examples in the cut pieces of nephrite from Glazkovo mound and from the villa "Luna" site (fig. S1). These were found in association with the slate saws used for the cutting (fig. 52). Finds at Tsiklodrom, Kuzmikha, and other sites re- vealed the increased use of another raw material- argillite. It is found only in the Jura deposits located on several river islands near USolye.2 Cutting artifacts 2eAbout midway between Irkutsk and Balagansk on the An- gara River. such as saws, made from these thin plates of argillite are retouched only on the edges with short, crude faceting. This simplified the process of manufacture but the resulting artifact was rather crude (fig. 53, left). Various degrees of crudeness of workmanship are seen in other categories of artifacts as well. This cer- tainly applies to the scrapers and some of the larger cutting tools. They were variously made of argillite, quartzite, and even quartz. In their massiveness and partly in their form, some of the scrapers remind of similar Upper Paleolithic artifacts (fig. 53, right). Adzes with flat surfaces and rectangular cross-sec- tions, so typical of the Serovo period, were not found. The Kitoi adzes were usually rounded, with a sharpened butt, and were considerably cruder in form than the Serovo ones. In other stone tools, particularly in those for domestic use, there was little difference from their Serovo counterparts. For instance, the bilaterally retouched and polished knives, irregularly triangular in form and with a slightly curved cutting edge, differ only in the _~~~ '' FIG. 55.

Never- theless, there is a specific Kitoi variant in the nephrite knives with triangular points (fig. 54, top).3 Specific to the Kitoi are also the flat whetstones with the long sides curved, the short sides straight. Not all Kitoi artifacts show crudeness of technique; some reveal technical progression. A good many of the side-blades (fig. 55, left) and arrowheads are thinner and more pleasing to the eye in their careful finish than are the Serovo ones. We note also disap- pearance of the stemmed arrowhead (predominant in the Serovo period) and its replacement with other forms: (1) triangular, with a straight base (a type close to the Glazkovo) ; (2) triangular, with outwardly curved long sides and asymmetric barbs; (3) triangular, with a semi-circular base (in agreement with the Afanasev arrowheads of Minusinsk krai). If the stone-working techniques sometimes take a seemingly contradictory direction,4 this cannot be said of the bone work. The fine objects from, say, Rasputino burial no. 1, are masterpieces of Neolithic art. With their high polish and rich and complex ornamentation they stand out above the bone work of any other Ne- olithic period of the Baikal region or regions neighbor- ing on it. Some of this art work will be discussed later in this chapter. In the Kitoi burials we also find, for the first time, tools for the smoothing of wooden arrow shafts. They are in the form of semi-cylindrical sandstone "grinders" with a trough on the flat side (fig. 55). They were always found in pairs (Kitoi mound, Tsiklodrom, Ras- putino). Since these were also found in the Early Bronze Age archaeological deposits of South European Russia, Gorodtsov mistook them for paleometallic cast- ing forms. However, evidence from various Neolithic cultures of North America (Strong, 1935: 60, 133, 141) and Europe counters Gorodtsov's supposition. B. SOME ASPECTS OF KITOI ECONOMY The hunting inventory of the Kitoi period is repre- sented by relatively few but unusually well made tools. The side-bladed composite daggers and knives do not differ from the Serovo ones (figs. 56, 57). New ele- ments are seen in the bone dart points which are highly polished, sharply pointed, and provided with a wedged base (figs. 55, 56), and, in the dagger-like bone points which are, at times, troughed or have the form of a scoop (figs. 56, 57). The latter could hardly have been used in hunting. The finely retouched laurel leaf-shaped spear points, which were so characteristic of the Serovo, are rare in the Kitoi period. On the whole then, the land hunting inventory of the Kitoi people seems to be impoverished, simplified. 3 Vitkovskii mistook these for arrowheads. 4 The cruder results are, after all, tied to the harder materials used, for the working of which a higher, or at least new, tech- nique had to be developed. :~ ~ ~~~~~~~ i~ I I.'

No. 3 is from the Kitoi mound, the rest from Rasputino mound. 1/2. (After Ok- ladnikov. ) Because of this, the progressive changes in the Kitoi fishing inventory are of special interest. Kitoi harpoons-of various dimensions-differ from the Serovo ones principally by more of them having holes drilled through the side flange located closest to the base (fig. 58). TIn the Serovo period, most often the line was secured to a flanged or shouldered base provided for that purpose. However, the harpoon did not occupy the most important place in the fishing in- ventory. This was taken by fish-hooks of an original Kitol type. For a long time the status of these composite fish- hooks was not clear. This is particularly true of the shanks. The earliest investigators- in the final quarter of the last century-took them for symbolic representa- tions of fish and even for slingshot missiles (Gre- wingk). However, by 1928 such quantities of composite fish-hooks were excavated from the Tsiklodrom site that the nature of their use became unmistakable. The shank of the Kitoi hook was characteristically ovoid in cross-section with one of the sides slightly</page><page sequence="64">VOL. 48, PT. 2,1958] THE KITOI PERIOD 65 I FIG. 57. Daggers of the Kitoi period from the Rasputino mound. 5/12. (After Okladnikov.) flattened, and, the ends of the shank were provided with hemispherical knobs. The barb was made of wood, bone, and sometimes slightly worked-over claws of land animals. (Talons of birds were not used.) At times the curved barbs had dentations incised on the inside of the curve, i.e. they were barbed barbs. Kitoi com- posite hooks varied in length from 2.5 cm. to 20 cm. All were carefully made. The materials used in the manufacture of the shank were soapstone (agalmat- olite), slate, hematite, and other less common stones. One of green nephrite also was found. Some of the Kitoi hooks are illustrated in figure 59. The great importance of fishing hooks in the Kitoi period cannot be overlooked. Their importance is underlined, first, by their being manufactured from less common materials and, second, by the large number of hooks deposited with the deceased-an average of ten per burial. For instance, in 1940 Okladnikov excavated twenty Kitoi burials and these contained, col- lectively, 303 shanks (Okladnikov, 1950: 368). A point of interest is, that during the Kitoi period stone representations of fish were not found in the burials. This does not mean that the luring and spear- ing of fish passed completely out of the picture, but it certainly was pushed into the background in favor of hook fishing. A numerical comparison of arrowheads and fish- hooks brings out another difference between the Kitoi and Serovo economies. In the Kitoi burials the arrow- heads were few and most of them were small. For instance, the 23 graves of the Kitoi mound contained only 79 arrowheads, but 259 shanks. In the burials of the Tsiklodrom and Rasputino sites only one or two FIG. 58. Harpoons of the Kitoi period from Kitoi mound. ?. (After Okladnikov.)</page><page sequence="65">66 MICHAEL: NEOLITHIC AGE IN EASTERN SIBERIA [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. arrowheads were deposited in each grave against the average of ten hooks. When a typical inventory of a Serovo grave was described earlier, we saw how pre- dominant the arrowheads were and how rarely fish- hook shanks were found. In its dependence on fishing the Kitoi period of the Lake Baikal region occupies an unique place even when compared with some of the Neolithic cultures of North- ern Europe, including the North of European Russia, where fishing always held an important place. These stated facts . . . become that much more important from a historical point of view, since up to the present time no complex such as revealed by the multitude of hooks and associated fishing implements of the Kitoi burials has been found anywhere else in Neolithic sites on the territory of the U.S.S.R. or, as far as I know, anywhere in the Old and New Worlds (Okladnikov, 1950: 371). This emphasis on fishing reflects in the location of the habitation sites. They were as close to the river as possible, on elevated floodplain terraces. In com- parison, the Serovo sites were mainly on the opposite, high bank of the river. The thorough excavation of Ulan-Khada enables a visual reconstruction of a fishing village, perhaps a FIG. 59.

Ulan-Khada is certainly admirably located for the purpose.5 Remains locate the boats a few paces from the shore; farther in, the drying frames for the nets are found, and about ten to twelve meters beyond them the habitation 'site proper. Here the fishbones, sherds, vessels, and other artifacts were found deposited around the fire-pits. The specialized digging implements from the Kitoi sites are evidence that roots of plants were part of the diet: there were picks of elk antler and spades made from the scapulae of the same animal. In the latter, the ridges were removed from the shoulder-blade and it was provided with a smooth working edge (fig. 60). 5For a description of the topography of Ulan-Khada see p. 18.</page><page sequence="66">VOL. 48, PT. 2, 1958] THE KITOI PERIOD 67 Other spades of a special, shouldered form were found in many of the Kitoi burials. They may have been used to dig the grave and were then deposited with the body. C. BURIAL PRACTICES AND SOCIAL RELATIONS Burials of the Kitoi period did not contain, in most instances, the large stone slabs or flat pebbles which during previous periods were laid across the chest of the dead. This was so, for instance, in the "classical" Tsiklodrom and Kitoi mounds. In them the stone covering was replaced with a layer of ochre (sometimes mixed with sand) which, in some cases, filled the entire pit. Another trait, peculiar to the burials of the Kitoi period (Kitoi mound, Bazaikha) were posts driven into the ground about the head of the deceased. Apparently, these wooden posts, perhaps structures, extended above the surface of the mound, marking the grave. Oklad- nikov suggested that they may have had totemic sig- nificance (Okladnikov, 1950: 406). Enough differentiation in the inventories of Kitoi burials is evident to imply beginnings of social inequali- ties. There were very "rich" graves such as Tsiklo- drom no. 1, Kitoi no. 7, and Rasputino no. 1. These contained a large number of varied objects.6 On the other side, there were some very poorly equipped graves such as Tsiklodrom burials nos. 2 and 6, the Yushino village grave, and the one at Starii Kachug. The last had no grave furniture at all. Other factors point to social differentiation, namely, the double and triple burials of the Kitoi period. More often, the double burials were of two men rather than of a man and woman. Particularly illustrative was the Tsiklodrom mound. There, of a total of thirteen graves, four contained two skeletons and two had the remnants of three skeletons. All of the fourteen skele- tons were those of men. To Okladnikov this suggests a master-slave relationship during the Kitoi period, the slaves being acquired by military conquest (Okladnikov, 1950: 383-384). Supporting his thesis is the anti- thetical orientation of the multiple burials. A com- parison with the burial mounds in the North of Euro- pean Russia which, as we have seen earlier, approach the Neolithic burials of the Pribaikal in inventory and ritual also supports this thesis. There (for example at Kubenino and on Olenii Ostrov), similar differentia- 6 The Rasputino burial was representative. (The sex of the interred was not stated.) It contained: a necklace of split boar tusks; a stone anthropomorphic figure; three bone harpoons; four small and one large barbed barbs (indented with a single barb) ; two small and three large barbs without indentations; two long bone needles; two small bone needles-one very small, one of medium size; two side-bladed daggers; a side-bladed knife; a thin bone plate; five damaged stone blades or scrapers; two polished stone knives; nineteen damaged arrowheads; twenty composite fish-hook shanks; several fragmentary arti- facts of stone and bone (Okladnikov, 1950: 372). tion in inventories and orientation was evident (Foss, 1937: 78-80, 86; Ravdonikas, 1940: 51). D. ART Boar tusks, sewn onto head-gear or braided into the hair, were widely used. Only seven skeletons from Kitoi graves did not have them. The Kitoi boar tusks differed from the rare Serovo ones by always being split lengthwise and being provided with "suspension" holes at one or both ends. In two cases (both from the Kitoi mound) the tusks were ornamented. One had a dentated, piliated edge, the other had deep incisions on the inner side. Pear-shaped beads made from the teeth of the maral were also found in Kitoi graves, although they occurred less often than during the Serovo period. In necklaces, naral teeth were sometimes alternated with beaver teeth. Bone-plate bracelets were found only in the Kitoi mound (burials no. 1 and 6). Bracelets made from small plates of marble and mother-of-pearl were also rare, and were found only in Pad' Glubokaya burial no. 2. Another type of Kitoi bead is analogous to the perforated cylindrical beads of the Serovo. An- nular rings of white marble, mostly plain, but occa- sionally ornamented with rhythmically spaced cuts or dentations, were used to make up necklaces or head- bands. Lower jaws of beavers were also found in several of the Kitoi graves. However, these may be regarded as amulets rather than ornaments. Since only one ceramic vessel was found in the forty- one Kitoi graves of the Upper Angara Valley, we must ::: 7_: F1.:_ ....... . . ....... ' ..._._ . ... . / i FIG. 61.

In form , the vessels were much the same as those of the Serovo period. In ornamentation, they also had much in common with the Serovo vessels, although a higher degree of development is evident in some. Stamping was the leading ornamental pattern. Some of the stamps had a straight, dentated edge; in some the working edge was curved or even formed a right angle. Depending on how many "dies" were cut into the edge of the stamp and on the force and direction with which they were applied to the wet clay, various ornamental motifs could be made. Applying the stamp vertically seems to have preceded the "stab-and-drag" method (which was done at a sharp angle to the surface of the vessel). Vertically stamped vessels were found already in the Late Serovo (Sobachii Log no. 1, Nizhne Seredkino no. 2) whereas the stab-and-drag method was fully utilized only with the arrival of the Kitoi period. The ornamentation (mostly on the necks of the vessels, as in the Serovo) was strictly geometric and for the most part straight-lined. A new type of orna- mentation, not met with before, was the three-dimen- tional triangle which stood out from the general surface of the vessel and combined with stamped lines to form a unified pattern. Some of the more complex patterns are illustrated in figure 61. This same style was reflected in the ornamentations of the bone work. Of course, the hardness of the mate- rial and the limitations of the surface simplified the style. Figure 62 illustrates the geometric ornamenta- tion on the "scoop" daggers from the Kitoi and Tsiklo- drom mounds. Simple ornamentations on bone work, ornamentations which can be correlated with those of the ceramics, were also applied to some of the Kitoi needle cases. @\ 000 0 00 @00D 000 A - FIG. 63.

(After Okladnikov.)</page><page sequence="68">VOL. 48, PT. 2, 1958] THE KITOI PERIOD 69 Specific to the Kitoi, particularly to its bone work, are the incised circles with a dot in their centers. Some- times the circle is double, i.e. concentric. Plate brace- lets, pointed bone instruments, and particularly needle cases have such ornamentation, either as single circles or groups of circles, evenly spaced (fig. 63). The plastic art of the Kitoi people is represented by a sculptured human head made of white marble and show- ing signs of polishing (fig. 64). It came from the Rasputino mound. Other manifestations of Kitoi three- dimensional art are highly schematized anthropomorphic figurine heads attached to geometrically ornamented shafts (fig. 54) and a very small (2 cm. in length) anthropomorphic figurine from the Tsiklodrom mound entirely covered with geometric incisions. Up to 1948 no sculptured representations of animals were known for the Kitoi period. In that year five zoomorphic objects were excavated from the Tsiklo- drom mound. Unusual are the fish representations made of thinly cut elk antler (fig. 65). All are from the same grave. Their schematized form and mode of representing the eye with a nucleated circle puts them into a class all of their own. A stone representation of a fish was also found. The material was gray slate. The dimensions of this figurine are unusually small, FIG. 64. Sculptured head from Rasputino; marble ring from Yanda village (upper right),^ and the Tsiklodrom mound (lozcer left). 1/2.

(After Okladnikov.) 3 cm. long and 1 cm. wide, against the average of 20 cm. for the antler figurines. The fifth zoomorphic object found at the Tsiklodrom represents the head of an elk. Compared to the realistic elk head carvings from Bazaikha (fig. 46), it is quite schematic. The ears, for instance, are not modelled but merely indicated by longitudinal cuts, and other features are treated similarly. Two unusual categories of "art" objects should be mentioned. In the first category may be included the bone "flutes" and panpipes. Several of these are known from the Lake Baikal Neolithic. The collections of the Irkutsk Museum contain a mouthpiece of a flute made of bone and provided with three stops (fig. 66a). Its length is 8.7 cm. It had been partly polished and traces of ochre are discernible in its surface. No par- ticular provenience was given for this piece except the general labeling of "Examples of Neolithic bonework." However, Okladnikov found a similar flute mouthpiece in the Neolithic layers of the Kullata site near Yakutsk in 1946 (Chapter XII). Bone flutes, although imply- ing considerable sophistication for a Neolithic culture, are not rare finds. They are known from Neolithic cultures of Northwestern Europe (Ebert, 1927: 354 and table 114; Bronsted, 1938: 1: fig. 133 on p. 191), of the South of European Russia (Makarenko, 1933: 43, tables IX and X, figs. 11-40), and also North America (Martin, Quimby, and Collier, 1947: fig. 82, p. 274). The other type of musical instrument is unusual for a Neolithic culture. It is a "many-tubed" instrument usually referred to as the "pipes of Pan" or panpipes.</page><page sequence="69">70 MICHAEL: NEOLITHIC AGE IN EASTERN SIBERIA [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. a b FIG. 66. a. Bone mouthpiece of a flute from the collections of the Irkutsk museum, natural size (after Ovchinnikov). b. Bone tubes of panpipes from Zhiloi Island on the Angara, %s natural size (after Okladnikov). In the Baikal region panpipes were found in three localities: the Tsiklodrom mound, near Potaskui village on the Lower Angara, and on Zhiloi Ostrov below Bratsk (fig. 66b). Only the Zhiloi Ostrov pipes were decorated with geometric incisions. The classification of these objects as "panpipes" might be questioned. There is the possibility of them being tubes for drinking water through the ice, since they are "stopless." However, they were found in groups. This is a deterring point for such a classifica- tion. After comparing them with panpipes of con- temporary primitive peoples, Okladnikov decided to classify them as panpipes (Okladnikov, 1950: 397- 398). The nearest European equivalents are found in the clay panpipes of the La Tene period (Ebert, 1927: 8: 358 and table 116, item 3). The final category of artifacts which may be included among the art endeavors of the Kitoi people are the bone "tally" sticks such as those found in Rasputino burials nos. 1 and 2, and in the Glazkovo mound (fig. 63). These sticks are usually rectangular in cross- section and are "decorated" with a number of parallel incised lines. In one case there are as many as fifty- seven incisions. Drawing from recent practices of Siberian primitive peoples, Okladnikov suggests that these sticks may have indicated the age of the deceased person, or may have enumerated his important deeds (Okladnikov, 1950: 398). In reviewing the ornamental art of the Kitoi people, we note that the complexity of the geometric designs increases, the techniques of carrying it out are on a higher level than in preceding times. In the plastic art, however, we do not encounter the same realistic quality that we have seen in Serovo art. Schematization prevails. With the terminal stages of the Kitoi period we find ourselves at the end of the third millennium B.C. or at the beginning of the second. Contacts of the woodland peoples of the Baikal region with their steppe neighbors to the south and west were accelerated. The ground- work was prepared for a slow but sure change in the economy and social system. This change was partly expressed in the Eneolithic Glazkovo and Shivera periods which followed the Kitoi, but they were not completed until the arrival of the Bronze Age in the Pribaikal. XII. THE MIDDLE LENA VALLEY The entire length of the Lena River was archaeo- logically investigated by Okladnikov and his party in the years 1940-1946. The results of his work in the Upper Lena Valley were incorporated into the part of this report which dealt with the Lake Baikal region proper. As far as the archaeology of the middle and lower courses of the Lena River goes, Okladnikov was the pioneer investigator, that is, he was the first one to tackle the problem systematically, correlatively, and with acceptable techniques. Okladnikov published his findings in three volumes of "Lena Antiquities." Two of these, the first and third, were available to the writer. The second volume, which deals with the archaeology of the Lena and Kolyma Valleys beyond the Arctic circle, is not avail- able at the present, but Okladnikov's preliminary notes on these sites were published in several articles, and, there are some reviews published in scattered periodicals. Out of this investigation came the discovery of three important Neolithic sites. Two of them, Kullata and Ymyyakhtaakh, are located in what we shall later define as the Middle Lena Valley. The third, actually two sites in the general vicinity of Barbatchiki Island, be- longs to the Lower Lena Valley region. Numerous other Neolithic sites were excavated, but most of them could be so identified only on the basis of typology. They will be mentioned briefly. A considerable number of Bronze and Iron Age sites were also excavated and Okladnikov made use of their contents where they could be correlated with the Neolithic remains. These few sites will be reviewed but again the majority of them will not enter into this concise report of Neolithic sites in the Lena Valley. A. THE MIDDLE LENA For the purposes of this report only, we may consider the Middle Lena Valley to extend from the locality of Pokrovsk (61? 29' N.; 129? 10' E.), some sixty kilo- meters south of the capital city of Yakutsk,' to Sottinets 1 Population ca. 50,000 in 1950.</page><page sequence="70">VOL. 48, PT. 2, 1958] THE MIDDLE LENA VALLEY 71 OS' ~~~ ~ ~~~290 130' 1O1' ATAMI~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ at '-Aldon ( Betomoi) W '~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~' o Modern Settlements 63?

(620 34' N.; 1300 02' E.), about sixty kilometers north of Yakutsk 2 (map 5). With the exception of Kullata and Ymyyakhtaakh, most of the datable sites belong to the historical Yakut period (seventeenth to nineteenth centuries). How- ever, the two stratified Neolithic sites do provide us 2 The coordinates of the locations as they appear on World Aeronautical Chart 124, 3rd edition, March, 1951. with a basis to which we can assign some of the other finds-surface or unstratified-to the Neolithic period. Considered separately, they could not stand the test of critical inquiry. Altogether there are six localities in the Middle Lena Valley (one of them the general area of the city of Yakutsk where several sites were uncovered) in which Neolithic remains were found. 1. THE POKROVSK VILLAGE DISTRICT South of Yakutsk, at the confluence of the Pokrovsk and Lena Rivers, there was uncovered a single burial datable to the Bronze Age. At the distance of some eighty to one hundred meters from it, closer to the river and atop the 12-meter terrace, a small site was excavated. Most of the artifacts which came from this site were associated with the sandy layer of soil be- neath the top layer of chernozem. Typologically they were Neolithic: net-impressed sherds, conical cores, blades, an end-scraper, a few chips of white and gray flinty material. 2. THE BESTYAKH (BESTEEKH) DISTRICT Typologically Neolithic fragments of vessels were found on the edge of the 40-meter terrace, on the high right bank of the Lena, some twenty-two kilometers south of Yakutsk. The sherds were net-impressed and some of the rim sherds had additional cross-hatched incisions imitating the meshes of a net. These sherds also had a horizontal line of punctates below the rim. The clay used for the manufacture of the vessels had a considerable amount of quartzite added to it. 3. THE KULLATA SITE The Kullata site has been long known to the natives as a place where one could pick up, or secure by shallow digging, flints for "fire-making." The chance diggings of the natives in pursuit of the hard flint did not, how- ever, disturb the site too much. In fact, they never reached deeper than the first layer. The site is located thirty-five kilometers south of II -~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~A- FIG. 67. Stratification of the Kullata site. (After Grigorev.)</page><page sequence="71">72 MICHAEL: NEOLITHIC AGE IN EASTERN SIBERIA [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. Yakutsk, at the confluence of the Kullata-Yuryakh (river) and the Lena. Like many other Neolithic sites, it is located far enough from the river proper so that it could not be readily spotted from the mainstream. During 1945 and 1946 an area of 168 square meters was archaeologically investigated. Figure 67 indicates the stratigraphic structure of the site. The stratigraphy of the site was as follows: I. Under the turf, which was 5-10 cm. thick, was found the relatively thin first cultural layer extending from 0.00 meter to 0.15 meter. The lower limit of this layer was level. It contained a few fragments of flinty artifacts and a fair amount of sherds. No cultural- economic complex was discernible in this layer. The artifacts were scattered at random. Typologically they belonged to the time span between the Late Bronze and Early Iron Ages. II. On the average, the second cultural layer ex- tended vertically from 0.15 meter to 0.35 meter. Small pieces of charcoal were disseminated thoughout this layer. In its lower reaches often pieces of charred sandstone were found. This was the richest of the cultural layers. Most of the objects were Neolithic in character. In addition, this layer contained a num- ber of fire-pits and storage pits. These account for the irregularity of its lower reaches. III. The third cultural layer, extending on the aver- age from 0.35 meter to 0.75 meter, differed from the preceding two. Its structure was light and loose-a sandy loam, very unlike the tightly packed chernozem of the layers above it. In the lower reaches of this layer, there was an interrupted stratum of buried, dark- colored soil (2-5 cm. in thickness) with which most of the artifacts of this layer were associated. The pits, causing the irregularity of the lower limit of the second cultural layer, penetrated into the third, reaching in some cases the depth of 1.0 meter. The fill in these pits was water-deposited and layered. At the very bot- tom of these pits there was a thin layer of pure sand which contained river shells and fish bones. The largest pit of the site was associated with the third layer (Pit II in fig. 68). It was oval in shape- 4.5 meters long, 2.5 meters wide-and reached the depth of 1.65 meters from the surface. One wall of this pit was steeper than its opposite (fig. 67). The bottom of the pit was covered with pieces of birchbark. Some of the larger pieces measured up to 35 cm. in length and 25 cm. in width. Traces of cutting were visible on some, others had holes drilled through them, still others were rolled into cylinders. Above this layer of birchbark several artifacts were found and in the northwest corner of the pit there was a number of charred river pebbles. However, no other indications of a fire-hearth were found in association with these smoke-blackened river pebbles. The size and character of Pit II suggests that the in- habitants associated with the third cultural layer used the pit as a semi-subterranean hut. After it was I 4 -- -I- I I I 7 - _ 5 _ - _ -. - - P FIRE-PIT _ __ ___ ?UECIOA LINE USED I j * I I I IN FIGURE 67 FIG. 68. Plan of the Kullata excavations. abandoned, the roof collapsed and partly filled the once deep pit. Eventually it was used as a fire-pit by the dwellers associated with the second cultural layer (Fire- pit no. 2 in fig. 68). In comparison with the two upper layers, the artifacts in the third layer were not numerous, although they were definitely Neolithic in character. IV. The fourth cultural layer occupied the vertical space between 0.75 meter and 1.5 meters. Like the first layer, it did not reveal any cultural-economic com- plex. The finds here consisted of scattered bone and stone artifacts. Actually, it cannot be regarded as a well-defined cultural layer in the sense of the three above it. A detailed description and, at this time, partial anal- ysis of the artifacts from the Kullata site will concern principally those which are assignable to the Neolithic period. Bronze and Iron Age artifacts will be men- tioned but briefly. The First Cultutral Layer Most of the ceramic remains found in the upper part of the first layer belonged to the Bronze Age (fig. 69, all items except no. 1 ). Even a fragment of a crucible for the preparation of bronze was found, with traces of the metal still on its inner wall (fig. 70, item 1). However, the sherds of the upper part of the first layer were not numerous compared with the great number taken from the lower part of the same layer. Among these sherds there were a good many which were repre- sentative of Neolithic cultures described earlier for the Pribaikal region. They differed strongly from the sherds of the upper part of the layer. Few of the vessel fragments were plain. The ma- jority was ornamented below the rim with the usual crossed lines or zig-zags, the "caterpillar tracks" created by the stab-and-drag technique, the punctates (some of these penetrated right through the wall of the vessel), and other typical Neolithic designs. Nearly all of them</page><page sequence="72">VOL. 48, PT. 2, 1958] THE MIDDLE LENA VALLEY 73 Vf 1 -2 3 4 FIG. 69. Potsherds from the upper part of the first cultural layer of Kullata. (After Okladnikov.) had a slightly thickened lip. Below the band of orna- mental designs, the body of the vessel was usually treated with net-impressions. Most of the body sherds were covered with impr-essions of fine-meshed nets. Few of the sherds had the rather large, crude, and deep net impressions which we associated with the Isakovo period. Aside from numerous chips, partly worked flakes and blades, the first layer contained the following cate- gories of stone artifacts: a) Whetstones of sandstone (fig. 72, items 2, 4, 8). b) Reworked fragments of slate and jasper axes. These were usually reworked into smaller cutting imple- ments. The comparative paucity of large polished tools, such as axes, may be explained by this practice. Several such reshaped tools were found (fig. 71, item 5). To this category also belongs an adze (fig. 72, item 7a-b) -the result of reworking an axe blank after the tool-maker was forced to abandon his original intention because he discovered that the blank was weakened by a seam. c) A small ring of white nephrite, polished to such thinness (less than one millimeter) that when lain over a printed page, letters could be read through it (fig. 71, item 7). d) Five cores, one conical in shape and of an unusual material-iron-stone (fig. 72, item 3). The others (fig. 72, items 1, 5, 6; fig. 73, item 7) were core arti- facts made of white flinty material. In some the plat- forms were very roughly retouched, in others the re- touching was done with a great deal of care. Some of these cores may have been used as scrapers. One of the core artifacts was provided with a sharp blade at one end and may have been used as a cutting implement (fig. 72, item 1). A small flake, finely retouched on its edges but with the original surface of the core from which it was struck preserved in part, 1qh j2~~~~~~~~A FIG. 70. 1.

They are narrow, not very long, and carefully worked. Very occasionally blades of black flinty slate were encountered 3 (fig. 73, item 10). At Kullata the slate blades were usually larger than the white flinty ones. f) Eleven side-blades were found in the Neolithic stratum of the first layer. Two of these were retouched only at the very edges (fig. 73, items 2, 3), the other nine were over-all retouched, and the cutting edges were secondarily retouched (fig. 73, item 6; fig. 75, items 1, 2, 3). g) Two fragments of large-sized man's knives, re- touched on both sides. One of these (fig. 74, item 12) was similar to the asymmetrically triangular "spear point" knives of the Pribaikal Serovo period. h) Thirteen scrapers of various forms were found. Most of them had the characteristic, curved working edge like those of the Pribaikal (fig. 74, items 1, 4, 8, 9, 10). Two had an irregularly triangular shape (fig. 74, item 7), several were straight-edged end-scrapers (fig. 74, item 5), three belonged to the class of minia- ture scrapers (fig. 74, items 2, 3). i) Four gravers were found. Two of these were prepared from blades of black flinty slate. One end of the blade was broken off in a straight line and then re- touched into a two-sided flake graver (fig. 73, items 4, 8). The spalls were struck off so accurately and cleanly that the resulting artifacts may be favorably compared to the well-known burins of Epipaleolithic times in the West. The third graver was made from a polyhedral core j~~~~~~~~~2 4 ~ ~ ~~~5m 2 ~~7a 7bV FIG. 72. Stone artifacts from the first layer of Kullata. Approximately % natural size.

It is quite massive and was probably held directly in the hand. The material was blue-gray slate. The fourth graver, of white flint, belonged to the category of miniature gravers. It was 1.9 cm. long and 0.6 cm. wide. Like the one referred to in the paragraph above, it also was a one-facet graver. The edge op- posite the facet was blunted by retouching so that, although it is likely that it was set into a handle, it also may have been used directly in the hand. j) There were eleven arrowheads and arrowhead fragments. Three of these had a base with asymmetric "swallow-tail" barbs, which occurred so frequently in the Pribaikal (fig. 75, items 4, 6, 7); one had a straight base (fig. 75, item 5 ), one a concave, curved base (fig. 75, item 11), two others had convex sides and diagonally cut bases (fig. 75, items 9, 10).

Among these arrowheads-common types to the Mid- dle Lena and southernmost Eastern Siberian regions- there were three which were unusual in form (fig. 75, items 12, 13, 14). Two were only partly but carefully retouched. The third, a thick artifact, triangular in cross-section, was similar to the triangular in cross- section, "file-like" Arctic arrowheads found in the Ne- olithic sites of the Lower Lena. They were over-all retouched, with fine secondary retouching on all three edges. Several interesting pieces of bone work from the first layer should be mentioned. Two artifacts (fig. 76, items 1, 2) show the technique of splitting bone and antler with partial incising with gravers. The dagger-like instrument (fig. 76, item 2) was made from a split metacarpal bone of an elk. The incision was not drawn the whole length of the bone, but just in the middle portion. It served as an opening into which a wedged tool could be inserted and the bone split. Of the remainder of the bone work, two fragments of harpoons (fig. 71, items 2, 3), a point with graver</page><page sequence="75">76 MICHAEL: NEOLITHIC AGE IN EASTERN SIBERIA [TRANS. AMER. PHIL.

(After Okladnikov.) incisions (fig. 71, item 1), a fragment of a handle grooved for inserting of side-blades (fig. 71, item 6), and two other fragments with graver incisions (fig. 71, items 4, 9 ) were unusual enough to deserve mention. The Second Cultural Layer In the main, the ceramics of the second layer agreed with those of the Neolithic stratum of the first. There were occasional intrusions of Bronze Age sherds into the upper part of the second layer and, very rarely, sherds belonging to the same Neolithic-type vessel were found both in the first and second layers. This is ex- plainable by the thinness of the first layer and the impossibility to separate it clearly from the second over the entire area that was excavated. Net-impressed vessels of Isakovo and Serovo types were the most archaic manifestations of the second layer. These predominated particularly in the lower part of the layer. Among sherds which had the im- pressions best preserved, a variant not found in the Isakovo was notable. The net impressions did not show the knotting and, at first glance, complete mesh- ing. However, on careful examination it could be dis- cerned that the vertical lines were made by thicker threads around which the thinner, horizontally oriented threads were looped and tied. These thinner threads did not leave as wide an impression, and, in many cases the narrow impressions were filled in with the overlap of the soft clay (fig. 77, items 1, 2, 3). The ornamental treatment of the vessels below the rim was very similar to that observed in Isakovo and Serovo vessels (fig. 77, items 4, 5; fig. 78, items 1, 2, 3, 4; fig. 79, items 2, 3). Many of the vessels were thickened below the rim by the clay being overlapped or by a separate belt of clay being fashioned around the vessel. "Caterpillar track" ornamentation, common in the Baikal region, showed up here also (fig. 78, items 5, 6). Some fifteen bottom sherds were recovered from the second layer. In differentiation from the Lake Baikal sites where the cross-sections of the vessels were either hemi-spherical or paraboloid, the bottoms of the Kullata vessels were considerably thickened and were shaped into a blunt but well-defined point.

Fragments of vessels from the base part of the second layer of Kullata. (After Okladnikov.) the sherds revealed that the point of the bottom was pasted on as a finishing touch to the vessel. This unusual pottery trait (found not only at Kullata but also in a number of other Neolithic sites in Yakutia) is related to similarly treated vessels from Khatanga 4 and "also reminds of the typical vessels from the shell-heaps of Scandinavia" (Okladnikov, 1950a: 59). The stone objects of the second layer were numerous and quite diversified. Among them was also a number of stone-working tools. Tn the Middle Lena district as well as in the North of Yakutia (Bulun, Chokur- ovka), the principal stone-working tool was a large river pebble with inclined platforms on both ends, i.e. these platforms are not at right angles to the main axis of the pebble but slightly inclined ( fig. 80, item 2) . Thus, when they were held upright and a blow struck, the direction of the impact was at a slight angle. The crudely chipped pebbles, probably blanks for adzes 4 Khatanga raioin at the eastern base of the Taimyr Peninsula, near the Arctic Coast of Eastern Siberia. For details see Chapter XIV. (fig. 80, items 1, 3), are results of the use of such stone-working tools. Most of the twenty cores found in the second layer were of white or pink-white calcareous flint (fig. 81, items 1, 2, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15). Their sizes ranged from 6 cm. in length to cores of almost micro- lithic dimensions. They represented different stages of utilization. In two cases the core was fashioned into a "blade" by striking off flakes from the direction op- posite the previously prepared platform (fig. 81, item 15). At times, microblades struck off the cores were retouched into small points (fig. 81, items 3, 4, 5, 6). Side-blades were retouched either over-all (fig. 82, items 2, 3, 4, 6, 10, 11, 14, 17) or on one side only. There were also some, in which only one edge was retouched (fig. 82, items 12, 15, 16). Sixty-one scrapers were found in the second layer of Kullata (figs. 83 and 84). Most of them were end- scrapers analogous in form to those that we encountered in the Lake Baikal region. Fifteen of them may be classified as microlithic (fig. 83, items 1-11, 13-15). 2 IIsV~~~~~ 6 FIG. 78. Fragments of vessels from the second layer of Kullata.

Rim (3) and bottom (1, 4) sherds from the second layer of Kullata. Reconstruction of vessel from sherds of the same layer (2). (After Okladnikov.) All of the latter were made from microblades. The working edge of one was only 0.35 cm. wide! Several blanks intended for scrapers (fig. 86, items 1-6) and for side-blades were also found. In this microblade cate- gory may be included three punches.5 Of the arrowheads, fourteen were complete, twelve were body fragments, six were points of arrowheads, and three were blanks. With one exception, the several categories into which these arrowheads fall are the usual ones that we have encountered in the Baikal region: straight-based (fig. 87, items 10, 11, 14, 15, 16),6 asym- metrically barbed (fig. 87, item 3), with diagonal facet- ing across the body (fig. 87, item 17), symmetrically concave at the base (fig. 87, items 2, 13). The excep- tion, not encountered in the Baikal region, was the presence of over-all carefully retouched single-barb ar- rowheads (fig. 87, items 1, 5, 6, 7, 8). Because of their careful finish, there can be no question of manu- 5 The term "punch" is perhaps not appropriate here. In the original the term "prokolka" implies "piercing," "puncturing." 6 Note the smallness and fine retouching of item 10. facturing "accident" or "break" resulting in this single- barbed form. Twelve gravers were found in the second layer. Four were manufactured from microblades and white flint or black flinty slate was the material used (fig. 88, items 1, 2, 3, 5). A fifth graver was manufactured from a rather massive blade of triangular cross-section (fig. 88, item 4). This enabled the Neolithic tool- maker to strike off two spalls on the same face of the blade, a procedure that must have required stone-work- ing skill of the highest order. The remainder of the gravers were made from "chance" flakes rather than from shaped blades, that is to say, any flake which served the purpose was utilized. Thus, this group of gravers was irregular in over-all form. One of the gravers had a carefully retouched handle (fig. 88, item 7), another had one of its sides retouched into a cutting edge with the opposite edge 7 a 2 3 - FIG. 80.

Two flakes were apparently first provided with cutting edges and a graving point was struck later. The spalling did not destroy all of the original retouch, so that these tools could have served a double purpose (fig. 88, items 6, 11). An unusual find was the "parrot beak" graver (fig. 88, item 9). It was common in the Upper Paleolithic of Europe, but up to this instance, had not been un- covered in Eastern Siberia. One of the gravers may be classified as microlithic. It was formed from a flake with a unilaterally convex, sharp edge which was blunted by retouch. The spall was then struck off the opposite, straight edge. The dimensions (3.0 cm. x 2.6 cm.) and shape of the graver were such that it could have been held with the thumb resting on the blunted convex edge.7 The last of these burins, although core-like in appear- ance, was made from a large, massive flake. At the 7 Not illustrated. point of the flake first a small "shoulder" platform was fashioned and then the spall was struck off (fig. 88, item 10). Of the more unusual stone tools, there were two which might have served as miniature chisels or adzes. One of them is illustrated (fig. 81, item 11). Their shape and slight troughing is similar to the pie&amp;ces ecailees of the European Paleolithic. Most of the bone artifacts of the second layer were fragmentary. Some of them manifested initial steps in bone-working. For instance, the elk metacarpal (fig. 89, item 4) showed traces of the process of splitting the bone into narrow parts which were then used for the manufacture of sharp points and side-blade holders. In other places the technique of bone-chipping is nicely shown (fig. 89, item 5). Fragments of finished side-blade holders were also found (fig. 91, items 12, 14, 15).

The barbs were slightly "hooked" near the end of the barb-point (fig. 90, items 6, 7, 9). There was a number of fragments of bone points. Some of them terminated in a long, narrow point (fig. 89, item 2; fig. 91, items 9, 13), some in a wide and flat spatulate point (fig. 91, item 8). Two of these point fragments-the point being laterally flattened and rounded-could have been used as dart points (fig. 91, items 3, 4). Another point, circular in cross-section and with a deep notch in its base, might have been a bone arrowhead (fig. 91, item 11). Fragments of three small points, circular in cross-section and longitudinally grooved, could have served as shanks of composite fish-hooks (fig. 91, items 5, 6, 16).

Four large bone artifacts completed the category: (1) A large adze of elk antler with its haft set off from the body of the artifact by sharply defined shoulders; the working edge of the artifact was broken in an irregular line (fig. 70, item 2). (2) A large, well- preserved axe or chopping instrument of elk antler; the shape of this tool indicates that it could have been held directly in the hand (fig. 92). (3) An antler adze in a rather fragmentary state (fig. 90, item 10). (4) A poorly preserved flute, probably made from a long bone of a swan. The Th ird Cultural Layer Most of the artifacts from this layer were found at the bottom of Pit II, which was described earlier (p.</page><page sequence="80">VOL. 48, PT. 2, 1958] THE MIDDLE LENA VALLEY 81 72). Associated with this pit and deposited in the sandy loam below the top layer of chernozem, were a number of artifacts made from cores, blades, and flakes. Among them was a side-blade (fig. 90, item 4) and an end-scraper (fig. 90, item 8). Both of these were made of white flinty miiaterial. Blades of black flinty slate were also utilized for end-scrapers. One of these end-scrapers, a rather small blade artifact (3.5 cm. by 1.0 cnm.), and another blade artifact in the shape of the pivces ecailees described for the seconld layer, were truly miniature in dimensions. One is illustrated in figure 93, item 6. There were also fragments of slate side-blades (fig. 93, itemns 8, 9) and arrowheads (fig. 93, items 2, 3, 4). The stone artifacts included a fragment of a grooved whetstone (fig. 93, itemi 7) and a partly worked river pebble which may have served the same purpose (fig. 93, item 11).

AMER. PHIL. SOC. 4. THE YAKUTSK CITY RAION There are some twenty-five Bronze Age and Ne- olithic sites in the immediate vicinity of the city of Yakutsk (map 6). Only a small number of them can be classified as settlements; most of them were camps of temporary nature. The Yakutsk raion sites may be divided into three major groups: (1) those associated with the mouths of the small tributaries to the Lena and located on sandy flood-terraces; (2) those found on "islands of sand" located within the Sergelyakh Terrace (see map 6); (3) those within the city proper, associated with the bed of an old stream which once crossed the ele- vated terrace. Most of the sites were datable to the Neolithic period, although the few Bronze Age sites provided the major part of materials.

THE KIL'DEMETS RAION The Kil'demets district, north of Yakutsk, contained two Neolithic sites with a very poor inventory. The scrapers, side-blades, and ceramics found in them may be typologically connected to the Kullata materials. 6. THE SITE NEAR LAKE YMYYAKHTAAKH Lake Ymyyakhtaakh is a small body of water located some sixty kilometers north of Yakutsk near the right bank of the Lena River. It is separated from the river by a low and narrow wooded ridge. A stratified site of great antiquity was located on the "'river" side of this low ridge. It was discovered by Okladnikov in 1942 and excavated in a preliminary way in the same year. Even the preliminary work indicated the poten- tial importance of this site and the possibility of estab- lishing it as prototypic for the Middle Lena Neolithic and later periods.8 8 In the meantime a better type site was discovered in Kullata.</page><page sequence="82">VOL. 48, PT. 2, 1958] THE MIDDLE LENA VALLEY 83 t 2 6 7 8 .9 1to1 FIG. 88. Gravers from the second layer of Kullata. Approxi- mately 54 natural size. (After Okladnikov.) Most of the excavation was done in 1944, when 150 cubic meters of soil were removed. Only then was it discovered that Ymyyakhtaakh contained four cultural layers. The site was located atop a small spit of the dividing ridge which "spills" onto the floodplain of the Lena. The spit reaches the height of 1.0-1.5 meters above the floodplain. Geomorphologically it was formed in the following manner: . 1. The base of the spit consisted of a layer of yellow- gray clay. In it were captured fragments of vegetation, well preserved because of the inability of air to pene- trate into the clay. 2. Above the clay layer was a stratum of pure sand, probably deposited there during a major flood. The spit now became elevated above the general surface of the floodplain. 3. Over a long period of time, a thin soil layer (on the average 15 cm. thick) was formed over the sand. It was chestnut-brown in appearance and loamy in texture. It was topped by a thin stratum of mixed ashes and sand. The earliest traces of human occupa- tion were found in this layer (not stratum) and archaeo- logically it constitutes the fourth and third cultural levels. 4. Above the chestnut-brown layer, a chernozem, strongly admixed with sand but still dark in color was deposited. It reached the thickness of 25-30 cm. and archaeologically constitutes the second cultural level. 5. Another chestnut-brown layer of soil, very similar in color and composition to the one containing the fourth and third cultural levels, but very thin, was formed over the chernozem layer. It was topped by thin streaks of charcoal, probably the result of a forest fire. In the lower reaches of the spit-on the sides and at the point of it-this layer was covered with river sand. Archaeologically it was sterile. 6. Above it, another chernozem layer was formed. In the center of the spit it reached the thickness of 25 cm. It comprised the first cultural level. 7. The higher parts of the promontory were covered FIG. 89. Bone artifacts from the second layer of Kullata. Approximately 1a natural size.

All of the cultural levels contained fire-pits with which were associated various remains: stone artifacts, charred bones and wood, vessel fragments, etc. The top cultural layer contained four such fire-pits, the second cultural layer had two well-preserved pits and traces of several others, the third layer no less than twenty-seven, some of them quite large (fig. 95). The haphazard pattern of the fire-pits and their vary- ing depths suggest temporary occupation of the site by small groups. This intermittent type of occupation must have been carried out over a long period of time, as suggested by the geomorphology of the site.

The First Cultural Layer A varied array of stone artifacts was found: a) River pebble mauls for the rough preparation of stone. b) Blanks of various types-for scrapers, arrow- heads, and flake gravers. There were also two cores, one conical, probably intended for a graver. c) Four scrapers. Two were almond-shaped, one roughly triangular. d) Five side-blades. One was a blank, another was retouched on the edges only (suggesting a more archaic technique) and the rest were over-all retouched, in the usual manner. e) One flake graver 2.6 cm. in length, roughly tri- angular in cross-section. The thinner haft or handle was set off from the working point by well-defined shoulders. There was also a combined scraper-graver of the type described for the Kullata site.</page><page sequence="84">VOL. 48, PT. 2, 1958] THE MIDDLE LENA VALLEY 85 f) Two polished knives.

All be- longed to the same category: elongated triangles with slightly convex sides and a straight base. Besides the smooth-surfaced sherds and the usual rim sherds with horizontally incised lines and belts of shallow circular pits, there was a number of sherds w ith pseudo-textile impressions, i.e. impressions made by an appropriately incised paddle.

This was however perfectly logical in view of the prevalent economy of the site-fishing. A few pieces of solidified birch sap were also found in the first cultural layer. The Second Cultural Layer The artifacts of the second layer agreed, in general, with those of the first. There were the usual blanks for scrapers, side-blades, and gravers. The graver blanks needed only to have the spall struck off to finish the implement. In addition to the graver blanks, two completed gravers were found. Of the seven "finished" scrapers, one had only the hand part flaked into appropriate shape. The blade part was unfinished and it revealed the smooth, natural surface of the pebble which was the raw material. This occurred again and again in the Lena Valley scrapers and suggests that here the fashioning of the scraper</page><page sequence="85">86 MICHAEL: NEOLITHIC AGE IN EASTERN SIBERIA [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. was begun with the handle, i.e. that part which was to be grasped in the hand, and that the scraping edge was sharpened last. Unique for the Lena region was a small (2.6 cm. x 2.1 cm.), roughly triangular adze blade of black slate. Its working edge was slightly curved and it was polished over-all. Of six arrowheads, two were blanks. All except one had a straight base. The exception was one of the "Arctic" type, i.e. made from a flake of red flint, generally almond-shaped in form, with the base slightly widened and the point drawn out. This category of arrowheads is typical for the Arctic proper of Yakutia, although some considerably larger arrowheads of the same shape were excavated at Kullata in 1946. Worked bone was represented by four pieces only: (1) a fragment of a polished conical point; (2) a frag- ment of a wide massive blade; (3) a fragment of a wedge, possibly the base of an arrowhead; (4) a frag- ment of a tubular bone with traces of longitudinal in- cisions. There were no essential differences between the ceramics of this second layer and the first cultural layer. 7 3 SI 14 5 FIG. 94.

The Third and Fourth Cultural Layers The thinness of these layers and their general agree- ment in content permits description of them under one heading. The number of blanks in these layers was unusual. There were forty-five. Some had only the smooth, water-worn surface removed, others were shaped to a degree which made it possible to determine their in- tended form. To the latter category belonged the blanks for scrapers, arrowheads, dart points, and core gravers. Six of the core graver blanks were of the "graver-drill" type mentioned earlier in connection with the Serovo period of the Pribaikal. Another group of gravers belonged to a category which, thus far, is typical only of the Neolithic of Yakutia. These gravers were manufactured from cores which had been flaked in such a way that a handle or haft of triangular cross- section was formed (below the graving point). The working "head" of the tool was rather short. In "fresh" gravers, the conical head was rather large and many- faceted, in much used ones the number of facets was reduced by the repeated spalling.9 The length of these core gravers ranged from 2.2 cm. to 3.8 cm. There was nothing unusual in the forms of the twelve scrapers, three side-blades, and two "punches" found in the third and fourth layers. Among the eleven arrowheads there was one of the "archaic" form met with before in other Siberian sites: an arrowhead with a single base barb and retouched only about the edges. The usual array of long, hollow bones with longitu- dinal incisions made preparatory to splitting, fragments of polished points, wedge-shaped sterns broken off bone arrowheads, a long (8.4 cm. ) awl fashioned from an 9 Unfortunately, this type of graver is not illustrated.</page><page sequence="86">VOL. 48, PT. 2, 1958] THE MIDDLE LENA VALLEY 87 elk fibula-these constitute the extent of the bone-work from the third and fourth layers of Ymyyakhtaakh. The ceramics show a difference from those of the second layer only in absence of comb-impressed sherds. As in the second cultural layer, sherds with repair holes were found. Several of them had their "inside" walls covered with coagulated birch sap. B. AN ANALYSIS OF THE MIDDLE LENA FINDS The most important point arising out of the study of the sites between Pokrovsk and Sottinets in the Middle Lena region is the possibility of an association of remnains from the Kullata and Ymyyakhtaakh sites with certain geomorphological manifestations. The two upper cultural layers of Kullata were formed within a chernozem 10 formation. This is, as a matter of fact, the case for most of the Neolithic remains of the Lena region and, as we have seen earlier, it was also the prevalent condition for many of the Baikal Neolithic sites. Therefore, it is even more significant to find a site in which artifacts of the lower layers (third and fourth of Kullata) were found deposited in a sandy loam below the chernozem. At Kullata the fourth cultural layer was not well defined and the assortment of artifacts was rather poor. It cannot be validly used for correlations with Baikal sites; its chronology cannot be safely projected. However, the better defined third layer contained enough purely Neolithic specimens to indicate the development of the culture associated with it at a time before the chernozem could form on the denuded floodplains and lower elevated terraces, that is, those immediately above the floodplain. The finds of mollusks (Pisidium sp.) in Pit II confirm this, it being their habit to occupy shallow depressions on flood- plains. Today, there are no such depressions and small lakes on the second terrace atop which Kullata is located, but they are present on the first terrace and on the floodplain proper. It follows then, that during the time when mollusks were still present on the second terrace, the people who left the artifacts found in the fourth layer were already living there. They also dug, or at least utilized, the depression labeled "Pit II"; this pit was later incorporated into the com- plex of the third cultural layer but not until after it had served as a habitat for the fresh-water mollusks (Okladnikov, 1950a: 146; Grigorev, 1950: 176). The remains in Pit II indicate a hunting and fishing economy, but at the same time the construction of a semi-subterranean dwelling implies that the people of the third cultural level were not fully nomadic. The dwelling could have been occupied seasonably, perhaps during the fishing season. At any rate, the smaller Kullata River would have been more conducive to fish- ing with primitive methods than the wide and, at this point, swift Lena. The materials from the various layers of Kullata and 10 "Black earth" formed under a grass cover. Ymyyakhtaakh may be, in part, correlated with similar materials which we have seen to be characteristic for the Lake Baikal region. Thus, the contents of the third layer of Kullata (which implied in their stone-work and ceramics a fully developed, "flowering," Neolithic culture) included the "swallow-tailed" arrowheads, a type which appeared early in the Serovo period of the Pribaikal. On the other hand, the blade end-scrapers and gravers with three-sided hafts or handles from the third cultural layer of Ymyyakhtaakh, were specific to the Middle Lena Neolithic. The materials of the second layer of Kullata were associated, as we have seen, with soils which by their geomorphologic position indicate that landscape changes have taken place since their formation. These materials widen the view of the Neolithic culture which they represent. The accumulation of fish bones and fish scales, the fish spears and a number of small bone points which probably served as barbs or shanks of composite fish-hooks, all testify to the importance of fishing during the period of the formation of the second cultural layer. Hunting was also practiced extensively during this period. This was indicated by the high quantity of animal bones in this layer, particularly those of the Siberian roe 11 the mainstay in the way of animal meat. Among stone artifacts, a conspicuous place was oc- cupied by the large polished tools. The material from which they were made was characteristic for Yakutia, particularly her northern districts: a flinty slate of good quality, dark gray to black in color. In details of form, some of the larger stone artifacts appeared to be nar- rowly local. Such, for instance, was the case of the adzes. These were roughly rectangular in appearance, slightly convex on the upper side (face) and with slightly offset shoulders for more efficient hafting. What differentiated them most from the smaller Serovo adzes was the absence of troughing on the under-side. The almond-shaped scrapers with a strongly curved blade-edge and a thinned "handle" were again local in form and unlike the discoid scrapers of the Pribaikal. Another unusual form in the way of stone artifacts was seen in some of the Kullata flake-gravers ("side- gravers") of archaic form, Epipaleolithic in the sense of Western terminology. These have not been found in the Upper Paleolithic of Eastern Siberia. They were unusual because, as in the Epipaleolithic examples, they were secondarily retouched near the graving point in order to form a straight cutting edge immediately below it. Nowhere else in other Neolithic cultures of Siberia and Eastern Europe do gravers occupy such an important place and they do not possess gravers of this [exact] type. 11 It is interesting that although the bones of the Siberian roe (Caprcoluis Pygargus Pallas) were well represented at Kullata, today the northern limit of the habitat of this animal is some 700 kilometers to the south of Kullata, i.e. the Siberian roe is not found north of the Vitim and Olekhma Rivers- another indication of climatic change.</page><page sequence="87">88 MICHAEL: NEOLITHIC AGE IN EASTERN SIBERIA [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. Gravers of this type are not knovn, at the present, even for the neighboring Pribaikal and Arnur regions (Oklad- nikov, 1950a: 150). The pieces ecailees were another "Paleolithic" re- minder. In the way of cutting instruments, the side blades were of the usual Siberian type. The semilunar pol- ished slate knives from the Middle Lena sites were additional items which served as connecting threads for Kullata-type sites and the pre-Glazkovo sites of the Pribaikal. Some of the artifacts from the upper part of the second layer and the lower-Neolithic-part of the first layer of Kullata also had their analogues in the Baikal region. The smooth-walled ceramics with applique bands and punctates below the rims were of the same type that we have seen in the upper layers of Ulan- Khada, i.e. the layers whiclh represented the Kitoi period. The Kullata perforated discs of white nephrite and the straight-based arrowheads with slight but visible thinning of the body near the base were, as we have seen, fairly numerous in the Glazkovo period burials of the Pribaikal. To the same Glazkovo period belonged most of the finds at Ymyyakhtaakh. The ceramics were particularly expressive of it and so were the straight- base arrowheads. The contents of Middle Lena sites can be also com- pared, and in a good many instances correlated, with those of the Lower Lena region and the Arctic Coast of Eastern Siberia. This point will become more ap- parent with the description of these regions in the two chapters that follow. XIII. THE LOWER LENA VALLEY The Lower Lena Valley (map 7) extends from the confluence of the Lena and Aldan Rivers (630 30' N.; 129? 30' E.) to the base of the delta of the Lena (71? 45' N.; 127? 00' E.) It was archaeologically investi- gated by Okladnikov in the years 1942-1943. The re- sults of this "pioneering"-in an archaeological sense- expedition were gratifying as far as Bronze and Iron Age materials were concerned. However, in compari- son with the relatively rich finds at Kullata and Ymy- yakhtaakh, the Neolithic remains in the Lower Lena Valley were, by and large, poor. It cannot be said that they were entirely disappointing, since some correla- tions with the general picture of the Eastern Siberian Neolithic period can be made. (These correlations were strengthened with the discovery and excavation of the Khatanga River sites. They will be described in Chapter XIV.) In the 760 kilometer stretch of the Lower Lena Valley between the Aldan-Lena confluence and the Arctic circle at Zhigansk, there are only six localities (in some cases pin-pointed sites, in others general localities with scattered finds) where artifacts datable to the Neolithic period were found. The finds from three of these six localities can be correlated only typo- 120? 125? 130? 135M y w? ~~~~~.:.., ......:.. f . . . . .. Tiks t.. . C/HOKUROVKA ....

In materials fromii three other localities there are addi- tional indications of age, such as the superimposition of ml-ore recent deposits above artifact-bearing strata, and these will be treated in some detail. 1. THE KAPCHAGAN SETTLEMENT RAION The oldest (i.e. Neolithic) finds in this raion (dis- trict) were made on a high terrace, some sixty meters above the level of the Lena. This was surprising since hitherto most of the Neolithic finds of the Middle and Lower Lena were located relatively close to the water level. The artifacts from this terrace, site consisted of a number of irregular flakes-some quite large, two cores, and a few sherds. The cores were more care- fully worked than those of Ymyyakhtaakh. The sherds, although considerably worn, were recognizable as net- impressed fragments of vessels such as were found in several other Neolithic sites of Yakutia. 2. THE NEOLITHIC SITES ACROSS FROM BARBATCHIKI ISLAND Barbatchiki Island is used here as a location marker because no other place names are available to serve that purpose. The island is located near the Aldan-</page><page sequence="88">VOL. 48, PT. 2, 1958] THE LOWER LENA VALLEY 89 Lena confluence, 246-248 kilometers north of the city of Yakutsk by river. Across the channel of the Lena, to the west(?), there is a small lake which formerly was connected to the Lena River by a short stream. The stream has now disappeared and only the dry bed remains. Two sites were found on the shores of this small lake: one at the edge of the dry bed, at the point where the stream at one time left the lake, the other-some forty meters distant-on the shore of the lake. The majority of the Neolithic remains came from the site at the edge of the dry stream-bed. Here, below the turf, there was a layer of tightly packed sandy soil, 25 to 50 cm. in thickness, throughout which small pieces of charcoal were disseminated. Within this layer were also sherds of a single vessel, a few flakes, and three stone artifacts. Two of the stone artifacts were worked river pebbles (fig. 96, items 4, 7). They are a mortar and pestle, artifacts commonly found in Neolithic sites. They were used for grinding ochre. The third artifact was a graver, 7 cm. in length and rather massive in appear- ance (fig. 96, item 6). FIG. 96. Stone artifacts and sherds from the site across from Barbatchiki Island. ( After Okladnikov. ) The net-impressed potsherds were rather thin (0.3 cm.) and well fired (fig. 96, items 2, 5). Quartzite was admixed to the clay. Enough sherds were un- covered and the form of the vessel could be recon- structed: rounded bottom, straight rim, lines of circular depressions immediately below the rim spaced about one centimeter apart. Typologically, such vessels be- longed to the Late Serovo-Early Kitoi period of the Pribaikal. Judging from the character of the objects, this was a Neolithic workshop. Gray flinty flakes chipped from river pebbles, the relatively rare flakes of white silicious flint were found here. Among the flakes there were several "rejects"-unfinished or spoiled artifacts. Adzes or chisels were intended in some (fig. 96, items 1, 3). The two rejects which are illustrated had been polished to a degree. Okladnikov tenuously correlated them with Serovo period adzes (Okladnikov, 1945: 47). 3. ZELENOE (UNGAI) The locality of Zelenoe or Ungai is a wind-protected sandy terrace, about twenty kilometers south of Sangar- Khaya. On this terrace surface finds of typologically Neolithic artifacts were made: knife-blades and net- impressed pottery of the "Serovo" type. The more extensive finds at this site, including remnants of dwell- ings, belong to later periods. The majority of the artifacts belong to the Iron Age. 4. FINDS NORTH OF SANGA-KHAYA At a number of points, some eighteen kilometers north of Sangar-Khaya, there were found sherds of typical net-impressed and incised Neolithic pottery. All of the sherds were found on the 6 to 8-meter terrace and were embedded in the upper part of the layer of clayey soil, immediately below the turf. This terrace is not affected by seasonal river floods. 5. FINDS NEAR THE MOUTH OF THE DALGAN RIVER In this locality, there were several sites with remains of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century dwellings of his- toric peoples. Underneath one of these-a stratified site on the shore of the smaller of the Kyustyakhtakh lakes '-Neolithic remains were found. The stratigraphy of this particular "house mound" was as follows: a thin layer of packed clay-the floor of a circular hut of the seventeenth-eighteenth-century Sartols-contained a few cultural remains of these people. Below the packed clay was a 20-25 cm. layer of light yellow sandy loam. Below it was pure sand. The Neolithic artifacts were found in the layer of sandy loam, most of them concentrated approximately in the center of the hut. They consisted of blades of black and gray flinty slate and a few thin-walled sherds. 1 A short distance inland from the Lena, near a settlement called Tongus-Khaya, some 508 kilometers (by river) north of Yakutsk.</page><page sequence="89">90 MICHAEL: NEOLITHIC AGE IN EASTERN SIBERIA [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. The blades were carefully struck off and very regular in shape. This was not the first instance where Neolithic re- mains were found during an investigation of chrono- logically recent dwellings. It also occurred in the case of the Sailyk site.2 Zelenoe (p. 89) was essentially the same type of site, although here the recent dwelling was not actually superimposed on the Neolithic remains. The renewed occupation of the same site at widely separated periods of time was not fortuitous. In this part of the world the people depended to a high degree on fish and water fowl during all of the cultural periods. It was only natural that whenever the circumstances were conducive to it, they would tend to select a pro- tected site in the depths of the taiga, on the shores of small but well-stocked lakes, rather than on the banks of wide rivers where the supply of fish and fowl was less predictable. It is also interesting, in this connec- tion, that many of the sites, both near lakes and on rivers, were located on spruce-covered terraces or promn- ontories rather than in places with a different type of vegetal cover. 6. THE LAKE SYALAKH DISTRICT The settlement of Syalakh is located some ninety kilometers south of Zhigansk,3 about two kilometers inland from the Lena River. Near this settlement a Bronze Age burial and remains of more recent in- habitants were found. In the same locality a chance find of a side-blade (fig. 97, item 7), not associated with the above remains, can be called Neolithic only on the basis of typology. More important remains were uncovered, in this district, on a spruce-covered sandy spit of Lake Syalakh which is located some twenty-five to thirty kilometers (by path) from the Lena River. (The air distance is a much shorter ten kilometers.) The spit is elevated some four to six meters above the level of the water. It contained a very shallow Bronze Age burial and some objects datable to the Iron Age. Because of the shallowness of the burial, it had been much disturbed by Evenki fishermen who still use the spit. But below the burial there was an undisturbed fire-pit, about one meter in diameter and 60 cm. deep. The fire-pit was filled with charred sand and small pieces of charcoal. Within this mixture were also found charred and some- times chipped river pebbles and a few stone artifacts and potsherds. The pebbles must have been brought all the way from the Lena River, since they do not occur locally. All of the sherds found in the pit belonged to a single vessel. They were net-impressed, with the outlines of the meshes and deeply pressed knots well preserved. 2 Sailyk, near the Emis'-Kyuel' Lake and near the settlement of Markha, is located immediately north of Yakutsk. It belongs to the complex of the Yakutsk raion sites, but was not men- tioned by name in Chapter XII. 3 A large settlement on the Arctic Circle. 2.0~~~ FIG. 97. Neolithic and later period artifacts from the Lake Syalakh district. (After Okladnikov.) Grains of quartz had been added to the clay. The orna- mentation consisted of comb-impressions below the rim and below these was a horizontally arranged series of circular pits, sometimes pushed through the wall of the vessel (fig. 97, item 6). Such vessels are typical of the Early Serovo period. Stone artifacts were represented, in the main, by blades and blade fragments of black and gray-black slate. Four of these were fashioned into bilateral flake gravers ( fig. 97, items 1, 2, 3 ). There was also a fragment of a much-used polishing stone and a scraper or knife fragment with traces of retouching. One of the blades showed signs of having been polished, i.e. it was detached from a piece of material which had been polished. At this site, all of the blades were detached from "mined" pieces of slate, not from river pebbles. This was documented by some of the artifacts in which were preserved parts of the original, weathered sur- face (fig. 97, item 8). Neolithic artifacts as well as objects and complexes of later periods were found at other points on sand spits in the northeastern corner of Lake Syalakh. How-</page><page sequence="90">VOL. 48, PT. 2, 1958] THE ARCTIC COAST OF EASTERN SIBERIA 91 ever, the typologically Neolithic artifacts found in them were not associated with any sort of complex. Here are a few examples: a fragment of a large Serovo-type knife (fig. 97, item 9), and a semi-cylindrical whetstone with grooves for the sharpening of bone points (fig. 97, item 4) -an artifact initially mistaken for a casting form in the Kitoi of the Pribaikal.4 In addition to the six localities on the 760-kilometer stretch of the Lena between Ymyyakhtaakh and Zhig- ansk where Neolithic remains were found, there are several other Neolithic sites north of the Arctic Circle. Unfortunately, they cannot be described in desirable detail since the only publication dealing with them in such a way was not available to the writer. There were, however, brief descriptions in Okladnikov's prelimi- nary report (Okladnikov, 1946b: 99-107). 7. NEOLITHIC SITES BETWEEN ZHIGANSK AND THE LENA DELTA Among the early archaeological remains discovered by the 1942-1943 expedition to the Lower Lena region were the Neolithic habitation site and burial at Uolba Lake near Zhigansk. They were characterized by "archaic in form" contents which included large blade arrowheads partially retouched. As a result of the 1943 excavation of this site, it became clear that the top cultural layer represented the terminal stage in the fully developed Neolithic culture of this region. Ex- cavations of two habitation sites at the nearby Kilarets Lake placed these in the same phase. One of the sites at Lake Kilarets contained a fair number of artifacts: arrowheads, spear points, scrapers, and sherds. At the other site several unusual fire-pits were found, unusual in the sense that ashes and charcoal were periodically cleaned out of them. Its artifact content was similar to that of the first site. The arrowheads, analogous to those of the Serovo period of the Pribaikal, and the net-impressed ceramics were important items for the dating of these sites.5 Some of the "work-shops" or quarries located be- tween Bulun and Chokurovka (approximately 710 00' N.; 127? 30' E.) contained a number of semi-fabricated artifacts of Neolithic affinity. Favorite locations for Neolithic quarries seem to be dry places among the high cliffs which constrict the stream of the Lena at this latitude. This brief description of the last three sites is not satisfactory for analytical purposes. However, the better described sites in the Lower Lena region give us an adequate basis for a comparison with the well- studied finds in the Baikal region, the prototypic sites of the Middle Lena, and the one outstanding site of the Eastern Siberian Arctic Coast-Khatanga. Such 4The other items in figure 97 (10, 11, 12, 13, 14) do not be- long typologically or by association to the Neolithic period. 5 Chard described some of these Lower Lena Valley sites recently (Chard, 1956). See Addendum, p. 98. a comparison will be attempted in the next chapter which will deal with the few known archaeological sites north of the Arctic circle in Eastern Siberia. XIV. THE ARCTIC COAST OF EASTERN SIBERIA The Arctic Coast of Eastern Siberia stretches be- tween the mouths of the Yenisei and Kolyma Rivers, an air distance of some 2,400 kilometers. It has been explored archaeologically only in a few localities. Sev- eral sites on the islands which make up the delta of the Lena have been excavated by Okladnikov during his Lower Lena expedition in 1942-1943. All of these be- longed to periods more recent than the Neolithic- Bronze Age, Iron Age, and historical Yakut-and were therefore not mentioned in Chapter XIII which dealt with the Neolithic sites in the Lower Lena region. Actually there are only two general areas with Neolithic sites in the coastal region of Eastern Siberia on which reports have been published. Both are located near the mouths of large rivers-the Khatanga and the Kolyma. The Khatanga sites were well described; only a sketchy description of the Kolyma sites was available. For the sake of completeness, the allegedly earlier Faddeyev Island surface finds will be mentioned, al- though they probably do not belong to a Neolithic complex. SITES NEAR THE MOUTH OF THE KHATANGA RIVER The wide expanse of territory between the Lower Lena and the Lower Yenisei-an air distance of some 1,200 kilometers-had been completely neglected by archaeologists up to 1945. The archaeological silence of this territory was finally broken by Okladnikov's discovery and excavation, near the settlement of Khat- anga, of sites belonging to the Neolithic and later periods (Okladnikov, 1947: 38-45). Khatanga is lo- cated at the base of the Taimyr Peninsula (710 57' N.; 1020 25' E.).' Of course, we will be mainly concerned with the Neolithic finds. The settlement of Khatanga is located on the high right bank of the Khatanga River, at the very edge of wooded tundra. Three river terraces are discernible in most parts of the valley near this locality: the flood- plain proper-about one meter above the mean water level of the river-the 4-meter terrace, and the 10 to 15-meter terrace. The settlement is located on the latter. In this particular locale the river is swift and the terraces narrow. Cultural remains were found, first of all, within the boundaries of the village, near the water's edge. The site was only one meter above the mean level of the river and therefore suffered from the periodic floods. The artifacts were scattered over an area of some 150- 1 This is the northernmost site in the Soviet Union where Neolithic remains were found.</page><page sequence="91">92 MICHAEL: NEOLITHIC AGE IN EASTERN SIBERIA [TRANS.

The finds consisted of animal bones, irregular flakes, blades, and other stone artifacts. At this site, the principal materials used for the manu- facture of artifacts were a semi-translucent chalcedony with milky striations, and a black flinty slate. Obviously not much of a case can be made for a disturbed site like this. The only artifact which can be typologically connected to the Lower Lena sites is an irregularly triangular knife of black slate with diag- onal cross-faceting (fig. 99, item 5). The principal Neolithic finds of this general locality were made a short distance upstream from the settle- ment of Khatanga, on a promontory formed at the junction of a small river (the Kuchchugui-Yuryakh) with the Khatanga. The promontory was formerly used as a reindeer corral. Most of the materials were found in association with two fire-pits located on the prom- ontory. The first fire-pit was shallow (15 cm. deep) and lens-shaped. It was found immediately under the 5 cm. layer of "contemporary" moss. The pit was filled with a reddish sand in which, near the top of the fill, numerous small flakes of chalcedony and black slate were found. The stratigraphy surrounding the fire-pit was as follows: (1) The already mentioned 5 cm. layer of moss. (2) A layer of ash-gray friable soil of ir- regular thickness, peaty and dark-brown in color in its lower reaches. This layer extended to the maximum depth of 15 cm. (3) A fine-grained sandy layer, light- yellow in color. In this layer there were admixed small pieces of "petrified" wood. All of the cultural remains were associated with the peaty part of the second layer and with the uppermost part of the sandy layer. The second fire-pit had been dug in a natural de- pression. It reached, initially, the depth of 80-90 cm., but was subsequently filled with reddish, burnt clay with streaks of charcoal apparent throughout it. Most of the artifacts were found in this fill: scrapers, gravers, arrowheads, dart points, knives, "punches," blades, fragments of large polished artifacts, and sherds (figs. 98 and 99). Of the recognizable bone implements, the handle of a side-bladed implement was of note. The groove was narrow, deep, and carefully cut (fig. 99, item 2). 2 2 FIG. 99. The Khatanga sites. 1.

( After Okladnikov. )</page><page sequence="92">VOL. 48, PT. 2, 1958] THE ARCTIC COAST OF EASTERN SIBERIA 93 Two implements of chalcedony were also found in this pit: a fairly large scraper (fig. 99, item 3) and a small graver (fig. 98, item 5). The assortment of small artifacts from this site, nearly all made of semi-trans- lucent chalcedony and carefully worked, gave it an individuality, so far not found in any other site in Eastern Siberia. Judging from the fragments, most of the large stone artifacts, such as adzes and axes, were made from hard flinty slate, dark-gray in color. Some of these were polished, some merely retouched. Contrary to the situa- tion in the Baikal region, where a number of large tools were found preserved, even though damaged, there seem to be very few large stone implements in the far northern sites of Eastern Siberia. As we have seen earlier, this was also the case in the Lower Lena Valley. Okladnikov's explanation for this is that the inhabitants of these northern regions must have formed a practice of utilizing the fragments of large broken tools for the manufacture of smaller artifacts. That is why some of the smaller slate objects, such as scrapers, knives, and arrowheads, may have a polished surface which seems to be out of place as far as the general typology of the artifact is concerned (Okladnikov, 1947: 42-43). The predominant type of scraper was roughly almond- shaped in outline, a type usual in the Lena Valley (fig. 98, items 3, 15; fig. 99, item 4). Another type of scraper, with an oblique working edge, was secondarily retouched about the edge (fig. 98, item 1). Only one artifact of whitish, opaque flint was found. It was either a dart point or a knife (fig. 99, item 1). The gravers of the Khatanga site are particularly notable because of their small size and careful work- manship, as well as for the high-grade type of semi- translucent chalcedony from which they were made. Three were found. The first was a flake graver with "micro-retouching" 2 at its base; the second was more massive with graving points on either side; the third, a squarish flake with graving points at diagonally op- posite corners (fig. 98, items 4, 5, 6). The latter shows the spalling technique very nicely. The arrowheads of the site were strongly indicative of Neolithic ones-long, thin, diagonally faceted, and with asymmetric barbs. They were made from non- translucent flinty materials (fig. 98, items 13, 14). There was also an unusually shaped cutter 3 (fig. 99, item 8) and a piercing implement (fig. 98, item 7). Both were made of translucent chalcedony. There were enough sherds to allow for reconstruction of a rather large vessel with a pointed bottom-a type found in the Middle and Lower Lena regions. The outer surfaces of the sherds were covered with cord impressions, such as are made by employing a cord- wrapped paddle (fig. 99, item 6). 2 The term is Okladnikov's. 3At first sight this implement could be taken for a graver but it does not show the spalling technique. When all of these Khatanga artifacts are viewed as a complex, it is not difficult to see that they are strongly differentiated from anything that has been, up to the present time, discovered in the inventories of Neolithic sites to the west of the Yenisei and in the southern reaches of Yenisei Krai . . . where in many re- spects they [the Yenisei Krai finds] can be correlated with the Eastern Uralian Neolithic complex. They [the Khat- anga finds] also differ from the Neolithic finds of the Lower Angara, which in turn are in considerable agree- ment with the antiquities of the Pribaikal as was pointed out [by Okladnikov] as early as 1937. The objects found at Khatanga reveal, in all their prin- cipal traits, a full analogy with Neolithic artifacts of the Middle Lena and in part with the Lower Lena regions. They are brought together by type and technique of manufacture. Very revealing, for instance, are the finds of several gravers and punches in the comparatively small Khatanga collection. These are rare artifacts in the nu- merous and well-studied finds of the Pribaikal . . . and of the Yenisei Valley. [To the contrary] gravers are com- mon in the Neolithic sites of Yakutia and are represented by carefully made artifacts from better materials. Punches are also relatively rare in the Pribaikal, but are usual in Yakut sites. As far as the characteristic typological traits of the small stone artifacts are concerned, . . . there is nothing that separates them from the Neolithic antiquities of Yakutia (Okladnikov, 1947: 43-44). The adze blades of dark-gray slate from the Khatanga site-reconstructed from the large fragments-with their diagonally cut working edge and emphasized shoulders, also show typological relationship to the Yakut adzes (Chapter XII). It is not only the Neolithic remains that bring the Khatanga sites close to those of the Middle Lena and of Yakutia in general. The remains from subsequent periods, the Bronze and Iron Ages, also point in the same direction and strengthen the ties. Thus, ... it was from here, from the east [the Lena Valley] that these raw regions in the depth of the Arctic were settled by man (Okladnikov, 1947: 45). THE KOLYMA SITES Sites near the mouth of the Kolyma River (approxi- mately 690 30' N.; 1610 30' E.) were visited over 150 years ago by Sarichev, a co-traveler of Billings. He described some of the dwelling structures and household tools that he found lying about on the north side of "Baranov Stone"-Cape Bolshoi Baranov (Sarichev, 1811). Much later, Sverdrup stopped at the Four Columns Island of the Bear group (Ostrova Medvezhi) where he also observed remnants of ancient Eskimo cultures and collected some artifacts. However, he did not excavate (Sverdrup, 1926). Mathiassen described and illustrated some of Sverdrup's finds (Mathiassen, 1927: 179-180; fig. 12, p. 180). In 1946 Okladnikov visited these sites and excavated two of four house mounds which he re-discovered on the western side of Cape Bolshoi Baranov. The richest of these proved to be the mound visited in 1787 by Sarichev. On the</page><page sequence="93">94 MICHAEL: NEOLITHIC AGE IN EASTERN SIBERIA [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. basis of these new materials Okladnikov came to the conclusion that the study of these early littoral settlements in the vicinity of Cape Baranov indicates that here, during a period of 2000 years, there developed a specific variant of Eskimo sea-mammal hunting culture which expressed itself in three phases: (a) Bering Sea; 4 (b) Birnirk-Thule; (c) be- ginning of seventeenth-eighteenth centuries 5 . . . (Okladni- kov, 1947a: 76). Since a description of these new materials was not available, it is not possible to evaluate Okladnikov's introduction of an earlier phase-the Old Bering Sea- into a locality where hitherto the Birnirk culture was the earliest acknowledged. However, Okladnikov's conclusions have not remained without challenge since Rudenko, who apparently had seen at least some of the material, assigned it to the Birnirk phase: The collection from these excavations has not yet been worked over, but judging from the harpoon heads and other objects, the settlement at Cape Bolshoi Baranov, like the houses on Four Columns Island, belongs to the Birnirk period of Eskimo culture (Rudenko, 1947: p. 13). Besides the Cape Bolshoi Baranov sites, Okladnikov and his party excavated several Neolithic habitation sites and quarry workshops in the Lower Kolyma Val- ley "which indicate that the occupation of this river [valley] was effected from the west, from the Lower Lena (Uolba culture)" (Okladnikov, 1947a: 76). THE FADDEYEV ISLAND SURFACE FINDS The three small islands which make up the Faddeyev group are located about 130 kilometers east of Cape Chelyuskin. During the 1945 investigation of the "landmarks left by seventeenth-century Russian Arctic explorers" there were found, quite fortuitously, four artifacts of an unusual type. The finds were made by Okladnikov and one of his students on the northern island of the Faddeyev group (770 00' N.; 1080 00' E.). The artifacts which Okladnikov illustrated (Okladni- kov, 1951: figs. 17 and 18), were very crudely flaked and all of them retained parts of the original weathered surface of the quartzite from which they were made. Two artifacts were pointed implements, perhaps for the piercing of skins; the third, a "scraper-like" tool; the fourth, a crudely shaped core. Apparently the artifacts were brought to this small island-only 4.5 square kilometers in area-since there are no deposits of quartzite on it from which they could have been made. The roughness of their manufacture, yet a manufacture which shows considerable skill in han- dling these often intractable raw materials, suggested to Okladnikov chronological connectives with the Lingby culture of Northwestern Europe and the terminal Pale- 4 Literally "the synchronous Bering Sea." I take this to mean "synchronous with the Old Bering Sea culture" since it does precede the Birnirk-Thule in this quotation from Okladnikov. 5 I interpret this as "Modern" in the sense of Collins' terminology. olithic of Siberia (Okladnikov, 1951: 80). This is frankly a guess. Typologically, artifacts similar to those of Faddeyev Island were found over wide areas of coastal northern Scandinavia, from Bergen to the Kola Peninsula. Their repeated occurrences in asso- ciation with certain geomorphological manifestations (beach lines) enabled the separation of this culture, the Komsa culture, from a later, definitely Neolithic cul- ture, also occurring in the same area-the Fosna (Clark, 1936: 66-73). By projection, the Faddeyev Island finds may be an indication of a very early-terminal Paleolithic in time and form-settling of the Arctic and of a continuum of the type of "Arctic Paleolithic" found in northern Scandinavia. XV. SUMMARY AND PROBLEMS Before discussing any of the problems which may arise out of intercontinental correlations of the Eastern Siberian archaeological finds and those of northern North America, let us briefly summarize the deductions of the Soviet investigators whose work we have re- viewed and annotated. In the Lake Baikal region, Okladnikov, using mate- rials which were excavated by himself and by earlier workers and which, in turn, were correlated or com- pared with archaeological findings of others in neighbor- ing territories (Andersson's North Chinese finds, Kise- lev's Western Siberian investigations, Gryaznov's Altai finds, etc.), proposed the following: 1. The Upper Paleolithic culture of the Lake Baikal region represented a special variant of the general Upper Paleolithic picture in Siberia and was of an autochthonous nature. 2. The Neolithic cultures of the Lake Baikal region arose from this autochthonous Paleolithic, traits of which were seen in the transitional Khina period and even in the Neolithic Isakovo period. During the latter, pottery appeared for the first time in the Lake Baikal region. 3. The majority of the sites excavated in the Lake Baikal region represented late stages of the Neolithic period. 4. Comparative studies based on typology, stratig- raphy, and cultural traits such as the orientation of the bodies of the deceased, enabled a division and sequential arrangement of these late phases into the following: (a) the Serovo culture, (b) the Kitoi culture. 5. In the Baikal region the first traces of metal arti- facts appeared toward the middle of the second millen- nium B.C. and introduced an Eneolithic period-the Glazkovo. 6. The terminal phase of the Glazkovo was marked by increased activity in the field of metallurgy and may be classified as a separate period-the Shivera. 7. The Bronze Age did not become fully established in the Baikal region until well after the turn of the</page><page sequence="94">VOL. 48, PT. 2, 1958] SUMMARY AND PROBLEMS 95 first millennium B.C. It lasted only about 500 years (800-300 B.C.). 8. Iron was first used in the Lake Baikal region about 300 B.C. Conclusions on the archaeological materials from the Lena basin and the Arctic Coast of Eastern Siberia were not as definite as those for the Lake Baikal region. However, certain points were manifested clearly enough: 1. The Lena basin Neolithic and Bronze Age cultures showed typological affinities-although only in part- to the Lake Baikal region. Affinities to the Amur River region were also seen in the prehistoric cultures of Central Yakutia, although in this regionally delimited work they were not surveyed in any detail. 2. The Neolithic cultures of the Lena basin showed definite local variants in typology, raw materials, and tool-manufacturing practices. 3. One of the outstanding differences between the Baikal Neolithic and that of the other regions of Eastern Siberia surveyed in this report was the type and use of burins. In the Baikal region there were few (con- sidering the number of sites excavated) and mostly of the core variety. In the Lena basin and on the Arctic Coast they were an important element of the material culture and were prepared mostly from blades or cores worked down almost to the thinness of a blade. The latter are a Late Neolithic manifestation. 4. The materials used for stone tools in the Lena and Arctic Coast regions are mostly gray-black and black slate of a high quality and of local provenience. Here, nephrite was not used often. The Khatanga excavations revealed the use of an unusual material- semi-transparent chalcedony. 5. The blade end-scrapers were prominent in the Middle Lena Neolithic. So were almond-shaped scrap- ers with a strongly convex working edge and a thinned, sharpened "handle." 6. The pottery of the Lena basin and the Arctic Coast carried the same type of ornamentation that we have seen in the Baikal region-net impressions, pseudo-net incisions or (paddle) impressions, comb- pressed decorative motifs, punctates, applique bars, etc. However, in shape the Lena and Arctic Coast pots were different, having a thickened and pointed bottom and often a reinforced rim. 7. In the top Neolithic cultural layer of Kullata there were found arrowheads of a completely new type for the Middle Lena and hitherto found only in the northern reaches of Yakutia-in the Zhigansk and Bulun raions and also far to the east of Lena, in the Kolyma Valley. These Kullata arrowheads were made of a thin blade, stemmed, and retouched only at the point and at the stem. The small dimensions of these arrowheads dif- ferentiated them from the larger ones found in the chronologically earliest Neolithic sites of the Lower Lena Valley, but brought them close to their (form) analogues in the late Neolithic-Eneolithic sites of that region-for instance, those from the sites near Lake Kilarets. 8. The three-sided "file" arrowheads from the Late Neolithic site of Ymyyakhtaakh were similar to those from sites in northern Yakutia. They were also a Late Neolithic manifestation. Although the archaeological base in the Lower Lena Valley and on the Arctic shores of Eastern Siberia is still very shallow, there is enough evidence to allow a proposal of a few correlations which will in turn give a general idea of the chronological picture for the whole of Eastern Siberia. The Late Neolithic complex of the upper layers (i.e. the "chernozem" layers) of Kullata and of the Late Neolithic site Ymyyakhtaakh may be chronologically tied to the complex manifested in the Uolba lake sites (p. 91). All three localities contained elements which, in turn, related them to Early Glazkovo sites in the Pribaikal. One of the important elements-or rather complexes-which is emphasized in them, is the in- creasing importance of fishing. This agrees with the situation which we have seen in the Kitoi and Glazkovo periods of the Pribaikal. Thus, it is possible to corre- late-for the first time -the terminal Neolithic and Early Bronze Age remains over a very large segment of Northern Asia-from Lake Baikal to the Arctic Ocean, from Khatanga at the base of the Taimyr Peninsula to the Lower Kolyma Valley. Another point which may be made on the basis of the materials which were surveyed, pertains to a regional subdivision of Yakutia. In Neolithic times there stretched over Southern Yakutia-from the mouth of the Vitim to the vicinity of the present-day city of Yakutsk-a fairly homogenous "Southern" variant, whereas from Yakutsk to the north, we find an "Arctic" cultural variant. The zone of transition was in Yakutsk raion, were the two cultural variants of the Neolithic met and mixed. This was particularly well documented by the contents of Kullata. While the archaeological picture of the Middle and Lower Lena Valleys is fairly clear for the terminal stages of the Neolithic and for the periods subsequent to it, there is very little to go on when it comes to periods that preceded the Kitoi. However, the unusual site of Kullata did indicate, through the materials and soil structure of its third and fourth layers, that people possessing a well-developed Neolithic culture were established-in at least the Middle Lena region-in comparatively early times. As we have seen, some of the manifestations of their material culture could be correlated with the Serovo of the Pribaikal which was dated to the third millennium B.C. Any attempt to apply the results of archaeological investigations in Eastern Siberia would become mean- ingless if we did not accept, at least in part, Okladni- kov's proposed chronology. To the writer, Oklad-</page><page sequence="95">96 MICHAEL: NEOLITHIC AGE IN EASTERN SIBERIA [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. nikov's dates for the late phases of the Neolithic (Serovo, Kitoi) and for the Eneolithic (Glazkovo, Shivera) seem acceptable, particularly since they are checked against the works of other Russian archaeol- ogists-past and present-in regions adjacent to the Lake Baikal area. The slight disagreement with Kise- lev on the Andronovo-Glazkovo correlation does not materially affect the situation. By Okladnikov's own admission, the chronology for the Khina and Isakovo periods is projected and temporary, but even here it is at least bracketed by the better established date for the Siberian terminal Paleolithic (which is based on geological and faunal, as well as typological evidence) and the acceptable Serovo date. The Lake Baikal-Lena basin correlations also seem to be cautious and at that restricted to the last phase of the Neolithic and to the Eneolithic. The sole exception is the earlier-than-ter- minal-Neolithic suggested by the multi-layered site of Kullata. Concerning inter-continental ties, two major sug- gestions seem a natural outcome of a study of the Eastern Siberian materials: (1) correlations of the Paleo-Eskimo cultures about Bering Strait with the end-phases of the Siberian Neolithic and with the Ene- olithic, particularly as they are represented in the newly investigated Lena basin and on the Arctic Coast of Eastern Siberia; (2) correlations of the early Neolithic phases of Lake Baikal (Khina, Isakovo) with some of the recently discovered "Mesolithic" sites in northern North America which are at the present "floating in time." Suggestions of correlations between the Lake Baikal "Mesolithic-Neolithic" and Paleo-Eskimo cultures have been made by Collins as early as in 1943 and again in 1951 (Collins, 1943 and 1951). These correlations have not gone without challenge (Rainey, 1953). If correlation through a typological continuum of arti- facts is implied (as seems to be the case-Collins, 1953: 197-203), then it is an acceptable one. But, in the face of the new works in Eastern Siberia, why should it be necessary to go all the way back to the early Mesolithic-Neolithic phases in the Lake Baikal region, when the results of these investigations show a con- tinuum of the same general type of culture in regions closer to the Bering Sea area or, at any rate, of later Neolithic cultures which could have just as well served as a partial basis for the sea-mammal hunting Eskimo cultures? I say "just as well" because all of the cor- relative elements cited by Collins and Krieger (Collins, 1953; Krieger, 1953) were found in the late phases of the Neolithic not only in the Lake Baikal region but also in the Lena basin and on the Arctic Coast of East- ern Siberia. In Okladnikov's works this continuum was emphasized throughout. With local variations it pre- vailed over a very large segment of Northeastern Asia. The once existing 2,500-mile archaeological gap be- tween Lake Baikal and the Bering Strait has been considerably narrowed and, in addition, Neolithic sur- face finds from the interior of the Chukchee Peninsula (Leveshin, 19501; Chard, 1955), outside the Eastern Siberian region which we examined in the survey, are also known. It is fully appreciated that a proposition of this nature, i.e. that the Paleo-Eskimo cultures have derived an important segment of their material contents from and through the late phases of Neolithic and Eneolithic cultures as they are represented in the Lena and Kolyma basins and on the Arctic shores of Eastern Siberia, will not remain unchallenged. There is no semblance of agreement even on part of the Soviet investigators who have paid attention to the problem in recent times. Both Rudenko and Okladnikov look eventually to re- gions south of Bering Strait, along the Pacific littoral as far south as the Philippine Islands and even to New Zealand, for precursors of the Arctic Eskimo cultures (Rudenko, 1947: 107-113; Rudenko, 1947, quoting Okladnikov, 1941a). However, their docu- mentation of this is extremely sketchy.2 The second point-correlations of the various as- semblages of unusual artifacts found in recent times in widely separated localities in northern North America with Mesolithic-Neolithic complexes found in Eastern Siberia-may eventually prove to be more involved than it now appears to be. The account of these sig- nificant finds is known well enough, so that it will not be necessary to review them here in any detail. In short, the discovery of a flint complex at Cape Den- bigh on Norton Sound (Giddings, 1949, 1950, 1951) prompted a re-investigation of the material contents of sites which were excavated some years before the Denbigh finds were made in 1948. It also stimulated the search for sites which would reinforce the pro- visional interpretations of the Denbigh Flint Complex. To the category of re-evaluated materials-which in- clude cores and blades-belong the Campus site and Dixthada (Rainey, 1939; Rainey, 1953), and the Birch Lake site reported in 1948 by Giddings (Skarland and Giddings, 1948). All of these are in Central Alaska. Another complex which has been re-evaluated in the light of the Denbigh finds was Solberg's "West Green- land Stone Age." In it, there were found not only cores and blades but also true burins (Collins, 1953). Since the time of Giddings' discoveries at Cape Denbigh, other sites have been found that suggest at least some affinities to the Denbigh Flint Complex. The most important of these is perhaps the cave site at Trail Creek in the interior of Seward Peninsula (Larsen, 1953). Other important finds which have bearing on this problem were made on the Arctic slope of Alaska in 1949 and in the Brooks Range in 1940 (Solecki, 1951). In Canada, the Pointed Mountain site near Fort Liard (MacNeish, 1954) promises to be 1 For an account of this find in English, see Krader, 1952. 2 For further details see Chard, 1955a.</page><page sequence="96">VOL. 48, PT. 2, 1958] SUMMARY AND PROBLEMS 97 a very important link in the series of sites with cores, blades, and burins, which now stretch, however thinly, across northern North America. In the summer of 1953 Giddings found a tree-line blow-out site on an old river terrace of the North Knife River which con- tained burins and carefully retouched side-blades (Gid- dings, personal communication). The series continues eastward with Collins' Frobisher Bay Dorset-Thule site where a flaked core was found (Collins, 1953), Meld- gaard's Sarqaq culture on Disko Bay where burins and a micro-core were found, but no microblades 3 (Meld- gaard, 1952) and ends in northeast Greenland with the Zackenberg and other finds of blades and burins (Knuth, 1952). The relationship of the material contents of all of these sites seems unchallengeable; yet the time span which the sites cover may stretch over several thousands of years. In view of the recent archaeological work in Eastern Siberia, it became obvious that concepts about the chronological significance of burins and microblades, as they were established by studies of Western Euro- pean Mesolithic sites, will have to be drastically revised when applied to the burin-yielding cultures of Siberia and northern North America. The time span of burin- using cultures may have to be extended to at least the first millennium B.C. in Eastern Siberia and perhaps to the beginning of the first millennium A.D. in northern North America. Yet, complexities enter into this simple proposition. 3 On re-examination of the Sarqaq materials Meldgaard deter- mined that the micro-core (which was not excavated by him) did not belong to the Sarqaq culture. This would explain the absence of microblades (Meldgaard, personal communication). First, these complexities are manifested through the proposed date for the Cape Denbigh Flint Complex of ca. 6500 B.C. (Hopkins and Giddings, 1953), second, through the proposed ties of the Denbigh Flint Com- plex with Larsen and Rainey's Ipiutak culture (Larsen and Rainey, 1948) which are manifested in the Trail Creek cave (Larsen, 1953). If the geologically-based dating of the Denbigh Flint Complex is correct, then we are faced with a situation which makes it exceed in time-depth the oldest date proposed for the Eastern Siberian "Mesolithic" Khina period of the Lake Baikal region-5000 B.c. If the Denbigh-Ipiutak connections are accepted, then the two separate problems-the ori- gins of the at-the-most 3,000-year-old Eskimo cultures and the chronological role of the Denbigh Complex- become merged into one continuum and a New World center, at least in major part, becomes implicit for the Denbigh Flint Complex. That this could be the case is suggested by the Folsom and Yuma connectives which the Denbigh Flint Complex manifests. However, the field work which has bearing on this problem is still in its embryonic stage and it is certainly not my inten- tion or disposition at this time to propose anything that would imply a finite interpretation. I only hope that this survey of Neolithic archaeology in Eastern Siberia will have contributed to the clarification of some facets of the problem, facets which may be regarded by some as minor, by others as major. Field work being conducted at an increasing pace in northern North America and, to the best of my knowledge, in Eastern Siberia and particularly in the Soviet Far East, will perhaps enable us to point to more concrete associations in the next few years.</page><page sequence="97">ADDENDUM During 1957 the manuscript originally completed in April, 1954, was edited for publication. Since 1954 several articles have been published which have direct or indirect bearing on the subject of this work. I refer specifically to Chard's articles on sites of the Lower Lena Valley and of the Chukchi Peninsula (Chard 1955; Chard, 1955a; Chard 1956) and Collins' descrip- tion of the T 1 site on Southampton Island (Collins, 1956). Chard's 1955 reports deal principally with the work of Rudenko and other Soviet investigators who excavated in the coastal regions both North and South of East Cape on the Chukchi Peninsula, and with the work of Okladnikov whose typologically Neolithic find in the interior of the Chukchi Peninsula (Lake Chiro- voe) is reviewed. (As noted supra, Krader reported, in 1952, the Yakitikiveem River Neolithic find of Leveshin.) In the Lake Baikal region, P. P. Khoroshikh re- ported the finding and excavation of a Late Kitoi burial (Khoroshikh, 1954). The site was located on the second terrace of the Kai River, a right tributary to the Irkut River, some four kilometers distant from the city of Irkutsk. The burial was a composite one; it contained the skeletal remains of a woman and of an adolescent. The bone-work (boars' tusks, maral, bear, and beaver teeth, needle-case, needles, and anthropo- morphic figurine) and stone-work (scrapers, stone shanks of polished slate for composite fish-hooks, pol- ished knives of nephrite, and so on) conform to the outline that has been established, in earlier pages, for the Kitoi period. Also confirmatory, but of added significance because of their locations, were Neolithic sites in the delta of the Indigirka River reported, in 1957, by A. P. Oklad- nikov and I. S. Gurvich (Okladnikov and Gurvich, 1957). Artifacts from the first of these sites-located approximately midway on the Ularov Channel between a point where it leaves the river proper and where it enters into the East Siberian Sea (710 10' N.; 1500 40' E.)-were principally surface finds brought in by reindeer herders. Later examination of the site (in 1951) revealed that the artifacts had been found in loose sandy soil (blowout?). This site contained sherds with rhomboid net im- pressions, lentil-like elevations below the rim, and rounded bottom-sherds. There was a quantity of stone chips, a flint scraper, and a fragment of a spearhead ( ?). The flaking technique was primitive. Around a fire-pit, there was scattered an "enormous" amount of bones-animal, fish, and human. Among these the largest portion consisted of mammoth, bear, walrus, and deer bones. On the basis of these finds and reports of other sites in the delta, an expedition headed by I. S. Gurvich was organized in 1952. The surface finds were obtained from the headmaster of the Chokurdakh (Chekyrdakh) school. Notable among them were: (1) A polished adze of flinty slate (fig. 100, item 7); typologically it is Neolithic and measures 8.8 cm. in length and 2.2 cm. in width. (2) A side-bladed bone point, highly polished (fig. 100, item 10); 17.6 cm. long, 2.2 cm. wide. (3) A chisel of mammoth ivory, circular in cross-section (fig. 100, item 13); a trough, begun with the intention of splitting the ivory, has irregular edges-testimony that it was worked with stone rather than metal tools. Its length, 10.4 cm.; width, 1.8 cm. (4) A drawing knife prepared from a split shin-bone of a deer (fig. 100, item 9); length, 32 cm. (5) A thin, rounded point of antler, probably an arrowhead.

(7) Wedge-shaped bone implement (fig. 100, item 5), highly polished; length, 10.7 cm., width, 2.8 cm.

(9) Four fragments of bone awls. The second objective of the expedition was a site on the left bank of the Kolyma Channel, the easternmost in the system of channels in the Indigirka delta. The site is approximately fifty kilometers from the mouth of the channel and about one kilometer from the channel's bank, on the southern shore of Tatyanino Lake (700 55' N.; 1500 20' E.). Part of the mound, on which the site was located, had been washed away by the waters of the lake (actually a remnant of a former channel). The mound reaches the height of over four meters-a conspicuous landmark in the otherwise per- fectly flat tundra that surrounds it. Materials collected from this mound consisted of bone and stone artifacts, potsherds, and animal bones. The majority of stone artifacts were made from a cloudy-white chalcedony. Rarely, artifacts of a high- quality, milky white flint were encountered. In thin chips, this flint was translucent. There were few finished stone artifacts: two knife- like blades, three scrapers, and four arrowheads. One of the scrapers (fig. 100, item 11) was made of milky- white flint; its dimension was 1.8 x 1.7 cm. Another scraper (fig. 100, item 1) was made of chalcedony and nicely retouched on three edges from both sides; its width was 3.2 cm., length, 2.8 cm. The third scraper (fig. 100, item 12) was analogous in form to the first (item 11); the material was chalcedony and the dimension 2.8 x 3.0 cm. Of the arrowheads, two were complete. One of them (fig. 100, item 2), tri- angular, overall retouched and troughed on one side, "remotely reminds of such troughs of Folsom points from North America" (Okladnikov and Gurvich, 1957: 48). All four arrowheads were made of chalcedony. Bone artifacts were represented by two fragments of chisels or chisel-like wedges, both of mammoth ivory. Sherds of a small vessel were also found. The vessel had a rounded bottom and was not more than 15 cm. high. Ornamentation consisted of five parallel applique bands below the rim and of net impressions over the body (fig. 100, item 8). Two sherds had "repair holes" drilled through them. In 1953 the site was visited by members of a team studying permafrost phenomena, and a member of that team, A. N. Tolstov, found a fairly large piece of worked chalcedony and "a wooden needle for the mak- ing of nets" (fig. 100, item 4). Collin's work on Southampton Island (Collins, 1956) reinforces the line of pre-Eskimo sites which stretches across northern North America and, of course, across subarctic Asia.</page><page sequence="99">LIST OF ABBREVIATIONS Only the more lengthy Russian titles are abbreviated.
