New York: The Sea- bury Press, 1977; xviii, 230 pages, figures, references, $14.95 (cloth). Reviewed by NATHAN GARNER COLIN TURNBULL George Washington University This is a selection of readings which, it is claimed, "covers major areas of conver- gence between aesthetics and social sciences; ethology, play, performance in everyday life, shamanism, ritual, and modern experimental theatre". As it stands, however, the book barely touches on those areas, let alone covers them, and it does little justice to the authors (inclu- ding Schechner himself) or their subject matter. The weakness lies mainly in the format, readings from several different disciplines excerpted not only from articles but also from major books; those not already familiar with the subject or author will miss much of what is being said. Authors and content are often made to look naive, self contradictory, even ignorant, by virtue of the fact that no attempt is made by the editors to describe the theoretical context to which the excerpts belong. Another problem with the format is that the authors are all using key words such as play, game, act, performance, and ritual, in very differ- ent ways. The interdisciplinary nature of this volume, instead of being used construc- tively, is allowed to aggravate the problem. The editors nowhere, from start to finish, deal with the significance of the apparent divergence of usage and understanding even of the crucial words that make up the title of the book;nor do they explore the possi- bility that there is an underlying unity. It is left for the reader to get what he may from each excerpt; the only help he is given lies in the arrangement of the book into five sections: Ethology; Play; Ritual Performance in Everyday Life; Shamanism, Trance, Meditation; and Rites, Ceremonies, Performances. He has to deal as best he can with anthropomorphic tendencies, inade- quate field technique, dated material, and a broad diversity of interests and objec- tives. This brings us to our major criticism of the book which, with proper editorial input, could have made a valuable contribu- tion to both disciplines. Fundamentally, the purpose of the book seems to be to expose the anthropologist and the theatre person to the credo arid validity of experimental theatre, to demon- strate that what anthropologists view as ritual and play in primitive cultures/small- scale societies is in fact performance, and that this sort of performance constitutes what theatre ought to be in our society. For the theatre practitioner this appears to be a justification for Schechner's work with his experimental company, The Perfor- mance Group. Schechner himself contributes an Intro- duction and the final chapter which, rather than serving as a conclusion that draws the book together, is merely a reprint of an article published in 1974. The editors otherwise contribute only a brief, skimpy, totally inadequate "Introductory Note" to each of the five sections. The last such note is a mere thirteen lines long; the longest (thirty-eight lines), for the section on "Shamanism, Trance, Meditation", does not indicate that the editors have learned anything from the many fine anthropolog- 222</page><page sequence="2">223 ANTHROPOLOGICAL QUARTERLY ical interpretations of these phenomena. And their final introductory note indicates that indeed they have little if any under- standing of what contemporary anthropol- ogy is about, for it states that "Too often anthropologists, who came as missionaries, or with trading parties, or as instruments of colonialization and exploitation, saw in the Others only savagery, or a quaintness to be brought back to the British Museum (in one way or another)". What is totally missing is the stimulating, imaginative and dialectical exchange between different points of view that could have justified what is otherwise merely a collection of miscellaneous articles of un- equal quality. The anthropologist might well be stimulated by Grotowski's fine treatment of the elements of sacrifice and transformation that are, for him, the essence of theatre, and might begin to per- ceive as Peter Brook has done a vital simi- larity between the anthropological and dramatic process. A theatre person might equally be stimulated by the comparison Levi-Strauss makes between games and ritual, or by the section on shamanism. But then both would do far better to go to the original, if they want to do more than merely be entertained.</page></plain_text>
