<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> PERSPECTIVES ON TERRORISM Volume 12, Issue 1 which consists of a crisis of confidence stage, a conflict of legitimacy stage, an upswing in political action (i.e.  violence) stage, and the final stage, the crisis of legitimacy, in which the activists make a complete transfor- mation into violence. This theory is then applied by the author to examine whether and how the eco-militant  organizations and groups followed the Sprinzak trajectory into violence. To examine this thesis, following the  introductory overview, the book discusses the nature and trajectories of groups such as the Animal Liberation  Front, Earth First!, the Earth Liberation Front, and the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society. The author con- cludes that “While time will tell if Sprinzak’s conception of political violence is correct and ecoterrorist groups  will progress to the third ‘crisis of legitimacy’ stage, with the exception of the ALF there appears little evidence  to date that the groups examined, except in isolated instances, have reached that threshold.” (p. 308). He ends  the book on a warning note that if these activists perceive an imminent “global environmental catastrophe or a  perception that the problem of anthropomorphic climate change is not being suitably addressed, and despair- ing of mainstream political solutions, they may choose to adopt violence against fellow humans as a legitimate  tactic.” (p. 308). This book is an important contribution to the literature on eco-terrorism and the application  of radicalization theories to explaining possible trajectories into violence.

This account explores the academic culture of jihadist clerics in general, and the factors that drive them to turn  to such a religiously extremist theology at early points in their careers. To explain their pathway to becoming  leading advocates of extremist violence, the author tests the hypothesis, which is adapted from Ted Robert  Gurr’s notion of “relative deprivation,” that, for clerics turned jihadists, the mechanism of blocked academic  ambition early on in their careers within established Muslim religious institutions plays a major role in their  adopting militant jihadism. As the author writes in the book’s blurb, which well summarizes his argument,  “As long as clerics’ academic ambitions remain attainable, they are unlikely to espouse violent jihad. Clerics  who are forced out of academia are more likely to turn to jihad for two reasons: jihadist ideas are attractive  to those who see the system as turning against them, and preaching a jihad ideology can help these outsider  clerics attract supporters and funds.” To test this hypothesis, the author utilizes evidence from sources such as  large-scale statistical analysis of texts and network data obtained from the Internet, case studies of clerics’ lives,  and ethnographic participant observations at sites in Cairo, Egypt. Despite the book’s excellent application of  qualitative and quantitative methodologies to generate new findings, the author’s thesis can be questioned,  since it ignores the fact that some of the clerics under examination may have been blocked academically due to  their own professional shortcomings and that their turn to jihadist militancy was due to their susceptibility to  be drawn to extremism in the form of such imperialistic ideologies to begin with. The author’s conclusion can  also be questioned as utopian when he writes that a successful counter-radicalization program should be based  on co-opting such extremist-inclined clerics as opposed to arresting and imprisoning them, since it would pro- vide them “with access to better educational networks and, ultimately, the possibility for fulfilling and secure  career prospects.” (p. 177). The book’s appendices include valuable syllabi of instructional materials on jihadi  theology and the methodology used by the author to conduct his empirical research.

This is an important selection of writings by leading anarchist theorists over the past 150 years. As explained  by the volume’s original editor, anarchists believe “in a society in which all individuals can do whatever they  choose, except interfere with the ability of other individuals to do what they choose. This ideal is called anarchy,  from the Greek anarchia, meaning absence of government” (p. 2). Besides this meaning, anarchy “is also used  to mean unsettled government, disorderly government, or government at its crudest in the form of intimida- ISSN  2334-3745 109 February 2018 </page> </plain_text>
