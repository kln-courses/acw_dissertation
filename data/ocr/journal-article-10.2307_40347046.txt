<plain_text><page sequence="1">"Strokes of havoc": Tree-Felling and the Poetic Tradition of Ecocriticism in Manley Hopkins and Gerard Manley Hopkins MARIACONCETTA COSTANTINI Hopkins' formative influence on his son Gerard has long been recognized by critics. A successful businessman and amateur writer, whose eclectic interests ranged from science to literature, Manley "possessed certain qualities which it is possible also to see in Gerard, the most obvious being voracity of mind."1 Hopkins biographers have suggested that the young poet derived from his father a strong intellectual curiosity, which accounts for the variety of his pursuits. It is most likely that his inquiring attitude was fostered by the learned environment in which he grew up. But the full ex- tent of Manley' s influence is yet to be explored. One aspect of neglect is the relevance of the model of poetic creativity provided by the father, who was endowed with a talent for poetry. During his long life, Manley acquired public reputation as an intellectual figure with many interests. Known to the Victorian readership for his works on maritime insurance and other non-literary topics, he also wrote poetry and published three collections of verse. As a child, Gerard must have read and listened to his poems (some were musical pieces and nursery ballads) and certainly knew the poem written to celebrate his birth: "To my child, Gerard Manley" (White, pp. 1041). His interest in his father's verse did not abate with adulthood. On January 23, 1879, when he was a curate at St. Aloysius' Church, Gerard wrote to his friend Robert Bridges and sent him a new poem by Manley: "I enclose some lines by my father, called forth by the proposal to fell the trees in Well Walk (where Keats and other interesting people lived) and printed in some local paper. See what you think of them. And return them, please."2 The closing sentence, in which he asks to receive the poem back, is a testimony to the appeal that Manley's poetry still held for him. Although he would prove to be a more gifted poet, Gerard drew constant inspiration from his father's verse, which contributed to shaping his artistic imagination. But how pervasive was this influence? And how far did he depart 487</page><page sequence="2">488 / VICTORIAN POETRY from the model offered by Manley? Critics generally agree on the presence of the father's "fanciful vein" in his early poems,3 but some maintain that "it is difficult to be precise about the nature of the influence" since Gerard "did not emulate him directly."4 More scrupulous is the comparative analysis conducted by Joseph Feeney.5 After giving an outline of their personal rela- tionship, Feeney shows that both Manley and Gerard had a lively sense of humor, were fond of puns, used similar images, and enjoyed combining ideas and words in eccentric ways. His arguments, which are copiously supported by quotations from the father's and the son's works, invite a critical reflection. If it is true that the Hopkinses shared some tastes and linguistic habits, why were they so unequal in their poetic skill and vision? Feeney himself suggests that Manley's poetry lacks the visual appeal, the shaping force, and the musical intensity of his son's. This gap in style and thought, which is unanimously acknowledged by critics,6 is not only ascribable to the poetic genius of Gerard. It is also the result of important differences in their aesthetic choices, their approaches to reality, and their sense of continuity with the poetic past. By pondering on the formative role played by Manley, which merits recognition, we can discover new hermeneutic paths to explore some aspects of the poetic experimentation carried out by Gerard. A new impulse to compare their poetry has come from a recent essay published by Jude Nixon, which uncovers the text of the Manley poem on the Well Walk trees that for years had remained speculative. The poem, entitled "The Old Trees," first appeared anonymously in the weekly Hampstead &amp; Highgate Express (December 28, 1878) as a response to a public controversy over the decision of the Trustees of the Wells Charity "to cut down the trees on one side of the avenue in Well Walk."7 There is little doubt that "The Old Trees" was an important source of inspiration for the son. A few weeks later, Gerard wrote "Binsey Poplars," a "little lyric" which also connotes tree-felling as a brutal act of devastation. In this case, the "historical" event that triggered the composition of the poem was the felling of some aspens at Godstow, which Gerard described in a letter to Dixon dated March 13, 1879: "I have been up to Godstow this afternoon. I am sorry to say that the aspens that lined the river are everyone felled."8 The closeness of the dates of composition has encouraged Hopkins critics to assume that there is more than a thematic connection between the two poems. But their arguments are entirely speculative. It is only with the discovery of the text of "The Old Trees" that the intertextual link with "Binsey Poplars" has gained full evidence. By reprinting the long-lost poem, Nixon made it possible for us to sharpen the focus of our criticism. As will be shown, a comparison between the two poems not only clarifies the nature of the father's influence but also throws light onto the formal and conceptual elements introduced by Gerard, who consistently revised the centennial</page><page sequence="3">MARIACONCETTA COSTANTINI / 489 tradition of nature poetry from which Manley's images are drawn. The aim of this essay is to demonstrate that "The Old Trees" is a litmus test of the poetic experimentation carried out by Gerard Manley Hopkins, who departed from the paternal cliches and "ornaments" to weave his own ecological discourse. As a "precursor" or father-poet, Manley handed down his poem to his "belated" son-poet, who recast it in an innovative fashion.9 The result was an autonomous poem, in which Gerard's response to "The Old Trees" was combined with a personal experience of loss and rendered in a figurative language that significantly rejects established modes of poetic expression. From a thematic viewpoint, "The Old Trees" stands in direct line of descent from the genre of topographical (or locodescriptive) poetry, which was largely practiced in the eighteeenth and early nineteenth centuries.10 This poetic tradition conceived the life of nature as a source of health and integrity, in utter contrast with the corruption wrought by human beings. Local topography inspired the poet-observer, who captured natural details to create appealing landscape pictures. Trees, in particular, were represented as beautiful objects, whose vitality and harmonious shape testified to the existence of spiritual energy in nature. But the modes of representation used in this genre changed in the course of the two centuries. If Neoclassical poets made large use of classical allusion and personification, the Romantics tried to engage directly with natural detail and related landscape to the inward motions of the observing consciousness. In the mid-nineteenth century, topographical poetry reflected the ontological concerns of the Victorians, who could no longer share the Romantics' delight in nature. Confronted with the consequences of scientific and industrial progress, Victorian poets wavered between determinism and naturalistic metaphysics, between the post- Darwinian view of an indifferent nature and the attempt to detect signs of spirituality in a rigorously examined landscape. The variety of their attitudes is evidenced by the wide range of tropes and strategies they adopted. Pathetic fallacy and pastoral stereotypes still abounded in the verse of the imitators of antiquated models, who contravened Ruskin's aesthetic precepts. Other Victorians chose allegorical or typological modes of expression that reduced the semantic potential of Romantic symbolism. But there were innovators, like Gerard Manley Hopkins, who enhanced this potential by combining objective perception with linguistic inventiveness. Unlike his son, who carried out experiments with poetic language, Manley derived his diction from his predecessors. "The Old Trees" is a good example of his indebtedness to the poetry of the past. Decidedly Victorian for its ecological discourse and its concern about modernization, the poem exhib- its cliches and devices that are typical of Classical, Neoclassical, and Romantic models. In line with these models, Manley does not focus his attention on</page><page sequence="4">490 / VICTOR/AN POETRY the "reality" of the old lime trees mentioned in the title, but turns them into emblems of his wife and himself. Their anticipated destruction11 becomes a pretext to dramatize an anguished sense of personal and generational loss. The allegorical quality, the classical inter textuality, and the illocutionary force of the text all contribute to this end: The Old Trees Remember, we were girl and boy- Ah me! 'tis fifty years ago- When 'neath these limes we sat, in joy- The West was red with day's last glow: Eve stirred the foliage with her breath: The nightingale sang on the Heath. Under these trees, in married love, We paced so oft when day was o'er Since that blest eve; while dim above The shadowing foliage, more and more, Brought peace with darkness; and the breast Found, midst a busy world, its rest. Alas! 'twas fifty years ago. The God-made world, the man-made town Have changed their limits. Time's stern flow Has cast some domes of fancy down. It is not that our hearts have ranged, But scenes that nursed our love have changed. We miss some land-marks of our life; "Progress" our cherished haunts invades. We feel how useless were the strife To oppose. The Dryads fly their shades. All, now, we ask, a little space Ere these trees fall beside their race. Once more to find th' accustomed seat, Close-sitting, feel our ancient love: Once more the gushing Spring to greet, Verdure around, below, above. Not now to scan hope's faery glass- The years on memory's mirror pass. Grant us, sweet heaven, that one more Spring May glad our eyes with old delight;</page><page sequence="5">MARIACONCETTA COSTANTINI / 491 Greeting the birds' returning wing, When tassel'd lindens scent the night: Our slower steps this Walk may tread With shade, grown solemn, overhead. Then say good-night! and leave the stage For those who choose to shift its scene, And modernise a by-gone age, Unreverent to what has been. We, also, past unvexed in heart, Not seeing all we prized depart. Hampstead, December, 1878 (Nixon, "Fathering Graces," p. 207) The opening address to his wife, the pathetic interjection uAh me!" and the memory of their early meetings immediately decrease the referentiality of the locus amoenus overshadowed by the lindens. The spatial markers "these" and "Heath" (a topographical reference to Hampstead Heath) do not change the impression of a sketchy description. Instead of offering details of the trees and their location, the poetic voice highlights his own feelings (conjugal love) and emotions (the pleasure of remembrance) in returning to the idyllic place. Self-referentiality is enhanced by the Edenic allegory in line 5. The personi- fied figure of "Eve" conveys the idea of a transformation of adolescent love into "married love" (1. 7) which anticipates the strengthening of the bond of affection between the speaker and his spouse.12 A similar effect of self-centered- ness is created by two Romantic topoi: the "revisited scene" (evoked by the time marker "'tis fifty years ago") and the "nightingale." Like Wordsworth in "Tintern Abbey,"13 Manley turns the natural view into a token of his thoughts and emotions, but unlike the Romantic poet he brings his own story and feelings into focus at the expense of locodescriptive details. Less pervasive but still central is the speaker's presence implied by the reference to "Ode to a Nightingale." In the Keatsian ode, the song of the "immortal Bird" becomes a symbol of the poet's wish to fly the actual world. Manley uses the objects of nature in a similar way, although he deprives them of the lushness and overabundance of details that characterize Keats' poetry. Broadly outlined in the verse (what does the nightingale's song sound like? what are the color and the shape of the lindens?), the trees and the bird are given an evocative and symbolic quality, which is meant to emphasize the speaker's emotional response to the passing of time. In the following stanzas, the poet continues to revive happy memories of the past. The function fulfilled by the lime trees is even more limited here: they only provide an ideal refuge from the "busy world" and form the "dim" background against which the speaker's emotions stand out. In line 14, the vague image of their "shadowing foliage"- one of the few signs of their physi-</page><page sequence="6">492 / VICTORIAN POETRY cal presence on the remembered scene- is superseded by the abstract picture of a deeply changed world. The time dichotomy "fifty years ago" vs. "now" introduces the opposition "God-made world" vs. "man-made town," which suggests that man's conflict with nature has dangerously blurred geographi- cal and ontological borders. In describing the new world contaminated by progress, the speaker expresses a deep anxiety for the future. The sense of an epistemic crisis that is stifling imagination (the collapsed "domes of fancy" imply the decline of Romantic sensibility14) is combined with the disorienta- tion consequent on the disappearance of familiar "land-marks" (1. 19). Unlike Matthew Arnold, who connoted the "signal-elm"15 as a spiritual landmark in the dreary mid-Victorian landscape, Manley Hopkins laments the cancella- tion of any points of reference in an age that is characterized by the demise of Romantic values. Another emblem of the past are the "Dryads" that fretfully leave the scene (1. 22). Their departure does not only sanction the end of the Arcadian myth, whose ideal of innocence, harmony and rustic happiness is annihilated by the aggressive conduct of modern men; the disappearance of the nymphs is also an intimation of mortality to the speaker and his generation, who are confronted with a deterministic view of reality. Deprived of the soothing melodies of the "light-winged Dryad of the trees,"16 they are forced to recognize the uselessness of "the strife / To oppose" and to reject the Romantic dream of escaping to an uncorrupted dimension. The conclusion of the fourth stanza seems to announce the beginning of a new era, in which traditional myths and beliefs are replaced by the prospect of a Darwinian struggle for life. Whereas Arnold rekindled the figurative meaning of the elm-tree by cheer- fully announcing its discovery at the end of his quest ("the Tree! the Tree!" 1. 160), Manley foresees the martyrdom of the lime trees, which are all doomed to "fall beside their race" (1. 24). But the poem does not close with such a disheartening note. In the following stanzas, the speaker finds a short-term solution to the looming threat of "Progress": deferral. What he asks the divinity ("Grant us, sweet heaven") is to postpone change for "one more Spring," to preserve the natural scene intact and thus enable the elderly couple to continue to enjoy their past pleasures ("old delight") and habits ("Close-sitting," treading the shady "Walk"). The illusion of stopping time by supernatural intervention is not dispelled in the last stanza. Although he claims to be ready to "leave the scene" for the worshippers of modernity, the speaker cherishes the hope of dying before the advent of the new world- a hope that contrasts with his previous acknowledgement of the on-going process of transformation (11. 15- 16). The "little space" (1. 23) overshadowed by the lime trees is nothing but a symbolic niche into which he seeks refuge to deny the reality of change. His wish not-to-see the future is actually a refusal to see the present, to accept the</page><page sequence="7">MARIACONCETTA COSTANTINI / 493 modification of his environment and culture, which the survival of the trees can neither delay nor prevent. By projecting ideal values onto the natural setting, Manley reveals a conservative attitude to life and art. His reluctance to accept the new reality is in line with a poetic tradition that idealizes or nostalgically evokes natural beauty to counteract the prospect of human mortality. Apart from using Romantic topoi, Manley draws inspiration from classical mythology to recall an ideal of harmonic interaction between humans and nature. The explicit mention of the Dryads is coupled with another hint at the imaginative world of the ancient Greeks: the indirect reference to the myth of Philemon and Baucis. A positive example of married love, the aged couple who hosted Zeus and Hermes was rewarded by the gods with the fulfilment of their wish to die together. When their time was up, the loving husband and wife underwent a simultaneous metamorphosis into trees, respectively an oak and a linden, and continued to live close to each other in their new arboreal form.17 The con* nection Manley establishes with the ancient myth is confirmed by a number of textual elements, such as his choice of traditional emblems of married love (the lime trees), his preservation of conjugal bliss in his old age, and his final wish to disappear together with his spouse from an unreverent world (notice the repetition of the plural pronoun "we" in the last stanza). This mythological link is emblematic of Manley's use of troped language, which never acquires the vitality of metaphorical polysemy18 but preserves two distinct meanings, the literal and the spiritual. A similar effect is produced by the biblical and pastoral imagery (the connection Eve-trees, the Dryads) and by the occasional recourse to prosopopeia (the female attributes acquired by the "eve" and "hope," the humanization of the trees suggested by the term "race"). All these examples of episodic allegory give a classical flavor to the language used by Manley, a flavor that is reinforced by the presence of poetic archaisms ("Verdure," "faery"). There is also a sustained historical allegory created by the personification old trees = old couple/ generation. Anticipated in the title, where the only reference to the age of the trees is given, this personification has much in common with the devices adopted by two earlier nature poets, who attributed human qualities to the victims of tree-felling: William Cowper's "The Poplar-Field" (1784) and John Clare's "To a Fallen Elm" (1821). In "The Poplar-Field," Cowper makes extensive use of pathetic fallacy and personification to describe the felling of a "cool colonnade"19 of poplars and the spoliation of their natural setting. By means of visual and auditory suggestions, the poet first humanizes the trees, the wind, and the river (stanza 1), and later traces a comparison between the poplars' death and his own mortality. The simile in line 14, "And I must ere long lie as lowly as they," draws attention to the speaker and to mankind at large by introducing the memento mori theme. This process is carried on in the last stanza. In line 18,</page><page sequence="8">494 / VICTORIAN POETRY the speaker's musing "on the perishing pleasures of man" gives primacy to an egotistical discourse, while the natural landscape has blotted out the view. The recourse to pathetic fallacy and personification is even more evi- dent in Clare's "To a Fallen Elm." Tenderly addressed by the speaker from the beginning, the "Old elm"20 is conceived as a friend and a family member, whose safety is jeopardized by the enclosure of common land. The personified elm is the pivot of the historical allegory elaborated by Clare, who laments the erosion of traditional rights and the diffusion of a "knavish" concept of freedom (11. 68-69).. Both connected with the Romantics (respectively, as a precursor and as a contemporary nature poet), Cowper and Clare were less daring than the former in their use of figurative language. Although they employed Roman- tic expedients, such as the revisited scene21 and the tendency to dissolve the distinction between self and not-self, they preferred allegory to the "vitally metaphorical" language exalted by Shelley.22 The same unwillingness to carry out linguistic experiments can be detected in "The Old Trees." The ecological motifs that Manley derived from his predecessors were developed in a diction that privileges one-to-one semantic relations over polysemy. What Manley left to Gerard was thus an ambiguous poetic legacy. On the one hand, he, no doubt, "fathered his son's own love of nature" (Nixon, "Fathering Graces," p. 193) and inspired his composition of "Binsey Poplars" by sending him a poem that depicts a well-known natural landscape (Gerard had lived at Hampstead as a child). On the other hand, the father did not provide a model that invited uncritical imitation. Rather conservative in language, "The Old Trees" is also limited in its ecocriticism, as shown by the extensive personification of the lime trees. The real concern of the author is to express his own disorientation in a rapidly changing society. Instead of coping with the social, ethical, and artistic transformation of his world, he takes refuge in a pastoral illusion and disclaims all responsibility for the future. The final message he conveys is that of an irreconcilable generational gap. If his age-group is condemned to extinction, the new generation is abandoned to an equally harsh fate, since they are deprived of both inner (reverence) and outer (natural beauty) grace. A marked difference in tone and worldview characterizes "Binsey Pop- lars." In responding to his father's bitterness and escapist yearning, Gerard took on more responsibility for the destruction of nature and the experience of loss that awaited the future generations. The ontological commitment he shows, in describing the felling of the poplars, is proof of his particular ap- proach to the world, which was fuelled by two main drives: spirituality and intellectual curiosity. A fervent believer in God's immanence in creation, he was also animated by a keen interest in science, which encouraged him to look at the world objectively. The epistemological framework he developed,</page><page sequence="9">MARIACONCETTA COSTANTIM/ 495 which pivoted on the concepts of "inscape" and "instress," was meant to rec- oncile these conflicting modes of apprehending reality. In his view, natural observation was the first step to validate the presence of the numinous with scientific exactitude. A careful examination of the objects of nature could reveal the unifying force which made each single object itself and communi- cated its unique design. Once he had perceived the marks of individuality and understood his relation to otherness, the observer could ascertain the presence of divine energy in the world and see how this coalescing force kept all the discrete "selves" together. No doubt Gerard's holistic ideal and epistemology were inspired by the Romantics. Like Wordsworth, he "experienced moments of transcendence in nature,"23 which contributed to shaping his ontological and poetic visions. And he was certainly influenced by the Romantic theory of "dynamic organicism,"24 which substituted the static concept of natura naturata with the kinetic view of a world in constant transformation (natura naturans). Plants, in particular, were exalted as emblems of natural vitality, because of their power to turn inorganic substances into organic matter. It suffices to think of Coleridge, who compared their life-sustaining functions to the creativity of imagination which was best incarnated by metaphorical language. His definition of the symbol as a biological organism which "'abides itself as a living part of that Unity of which it is the representative"'25 anticipates Gerard's attempts to cre- ate a language that embodied spiritual truths, by grafting the Catholic dogma of the Incarnation onto Romantic organicism. Unlike his father, who adopted Romantic topoi but lacked the insight of his predecessors, Gerard situated himself more clearly in the wake of Word- sworth, Coleridge, and Shelley. Their natural imagery and philosophy were potent sources of inspiration for the young poet, who revived their linguistic and epistemological strategies to counteract the Victorian sense of spiritual drainage. His Catholic faith contributed to strengthening his perception and representation of the divine in nature. But he also felt the influence of Ruskin's post-Romantic sensibility.26 Since his undergraduate years, Gerard had learned to observe natural landscapes with Ruskinian precision. His sketch-books, early diaries, and journal bear full evidence of his eye for detail, which is particularly evident in his studies of trees. Fascinated by the complexity of vegetal structures, Gerard sketched and described the peculiarities of the trees he watched while walking in rural Oxfordshire. His approach to them was both scientific and artistic. Like a proper botanist, he learned to notice the physical details of trees (the structure of their branches, the color, shape, and texture of their leaves, etc.) and to distinguish varieties. The following descriptions of poplars, which display a marked Ruskinian touch,27 are a testimony to his accurate percep- tion of tree differences:</page><page sequence="10">496 / VICTORIAN POETRY White poplars most beautiful in small grey crisp spray-like leaf. Aspens thick in leaf but not so the sycamores even yet. . . . Lombardy poplars built high and with dice-like leaves. There were planes and various kinds of oak and by the stream a very tall poplar- not Lombardy: I cannot be sure of what kind- with the stem a long way bare.28 Fascinated as he was with the complex organization of trees, Gerard strove to uncover the natural laws that gave each variety its distinctive character.29 At the same time he was attracted to the mystery of individuality, which he explored by detecting the identifying marks of discrete trees (and objects in general). The attention he paid to individuality was the first step toward a holistic perception and representation of the world. With a never quenched desire to understand natural laws, Gerard looked for the key to the ontological dilemma of the incommensurable "pied beauty" of the world, in which self and not-self, human and divine were closely bound together. Romantic in its origin, this sense of natural spiritualism was increased by Ruskin's lesson, which taught him to shun subjectivism and find "delight in simply what the eye perceives" (Jonnson&gt; P- 98). Against "pathetic fallacy" and other examples of "d- d subjective rot,"30 Gerard trained his eye and his mind to explore and reproduce the complexity of the world. By approaching reality objectively, he meant to discover the secret correspondences between the physical and the metaphysical, to solve the mystery of the unity and infinite variety of nature- a mystery which he effectively rendered with another vegetal metaphor: the "pomegranate. "31 First developed through sketching and note taking, this integrated epistemological approach was refined in his poems, and especially in his 1877 sonnets, where the presence of divine energy in nature is actualized by powerful linguistic strategies. In "Pied Beauty," for instance, the chromatic and phonetic parallels give concreteness and liveliness to the natural world, whose joyful variety is originated and renewed by a "fathering-forth" divinity.32 Neither an allegory nor a projection of subjective feelings, nature is here a self-contained symbol, which incorporates the human and the spiritual into its harmonic whole. In other sonnets, such as "God's Grandeur," the poet introduces a disruptive element, human actions, but he still relies on the self-regenerative power of a world "charged" with spiritual energy (1. 1). The 1877 sonnets offer remarkable examples of his natural tropes. To convey an all-encompassing worldview, the poet combines different isotopes, reinforces their semantic links through sound parallels, and incorporates the speaker himself into the variegated reality he depicts. The result is a figurative language that brings into existence- albeit momentarily- an ideal of wholeness. Semantically rich and oblique, his tropes incarnate the mystery of a "dappled"</page><page sequence="11">MARIACONCETTA COSTANTINI/ 497 natural world, whose components partake of the same essence in spite of their discrete "inscapes," colors, luscious tastes, and complex shapes. After 1877, Gerard continued to explore the semantic potentiality of natural tropes. Their frequency and variation depended on his wavering between conflicting thoughts.33 But the impressive image of the arching elm that incorporates light and shadow in the late poem "That Nature is a Heraclitean Fire and of the comfort of the Resurrection" (1888) proves that natural symbols were still used to render the mysterious interfusion of elements: "Down roughcast, down dazzling whitewash, wherever an elm arches, / Shivelights and shadowtackle in long lashes lace, lance, and pair" (11. 34). Unlike the "signakree" described in "Thyrsis," which was a means to establish one-to-one relations between the world of sense and a yearned-for mythical dimension, the Hopkinsian elm is a living, almost palpable, symbol with multiple meanings. A single tree and a representative of a tree variety, the arching elm is physically present on the scene but also incarnates the idea of a nature governed by a divinely oriented flux. Whereas Arnold revived pastoral myths and privileged a subjective approach to natural objects (the "signal-elm" is the trigger of his personal and artistic meditation), Gerard Hopkins potentiated the Romantic view of nature by training his senses to perceive "real" correspondences between matter and spirit. The novelty of his poetry emerges by contrast with other Victorian poets, who still admired their predecessors but were affected by the growing cynicism of their age. Their use of Romantic topoi was not sustained by a firm belief in the ideals of their predecessors, which tended to appear rather naive and unworldly. In the case of Arnold, for instance, the divergence of themes and strategies is emphasized by some contextual elements he shares with Gerard Hopkins. Set in the rural area around Oxford where the Binsey poplars grew, the Arnoldian elegies "The Scholar-Gipsy" (1853) and "Thyrsis" are character- ized by a self-centered attitude and a tendency to replace physical observation with abstraction (not surprisingly, the Arnoldian "elm" is preceded by the term "signal" which highlights its semiological function). Another case in point is that of Manley Hopkins, whose wish to preserve the past intact clashed with a bitter awareness of the inevitability of change. As we will see, like his father, Gerard responded to the destruction of his environment. But in "Binsey Poplars" his dismay at the ecological disaster is tempered by the cogency and forcefulness of his figurative language which warns men against the plundering of trees, while at the same time keeping alive hope in the resilience of natural life. His deviations from the linguistic and conceptual patterns of "The Old Trees" are immediately perceivable in the exactness of the spatial and temporal markers given in the title and subtitle, "Binsey Poplars / felled 1879." Whereas Manley omits to mention the specific location of the lindens, which is not clari-</page><page sequence="12">498 / VICTORIAN POETRY fied by the deictics and toponyms ("these limes," "the Heath," "these trees," "this Walk"), Gerard introduces the unambiguous topographical reference to Binsey. Equally precise is the indication of the date of the poplar-felling.34 In contrast with his father, who opts for a subjective measuring of time and a vague location, Gerard is careful in delineating the context in which the trees used to be perceived by a well-detached observing self. The idea of referentiality that is thus conveyed makes their loss more tragic, because it historicizes the annihilation of their beauty and the shedding of their life-giving sap. The reality of the poplars is reinforced by the opening expression "My aspens dear." Apart from laying stress on the specific trees watched and loved by the speaker, the apostrophe offers a botanical detail (the poplars are classified as "aspens") which adds to the overall effect of verisimilitude. This effect is not decreased by the pathetic tone adopted by the speaker, who avoids replacing the objects of his grief with his subjective emotions. Significant, in this regard, is the choice of an expression that sounds like a direct address. By greeting the poplars as if in a love letter, the speaker establishes an interactant relationship with the vegetal beings.35 The difference with "The Old Trees" is evident. In the initial apostrophe, Manley addresses his wife and reconstructs their love story while keeping the trees in the background (as personifications of their human feelings). On the contrary, Gerard manifests his wish to interact again with the poplars by nostalgically evoking their beauty and vitality. The trees he addresses are no mirrors of his emotions: they are distinct natural entities which once raised his admiration. On this view, the poet's grief at the cut- ting down acquires an ontological, rather than a purely subjective, meaning. What he regrets is the breaking of a positive relation between men and natural objects, which guaranteed their harmonious coexistence.36 The consequences of this ontological collapse are well rendered by two complex images around which the first stanza hinges: the "airy cages" that "quelled in leaves the leaping sun" (11. 1-2), and the dandling "sandalled / Shadow" projected on "meadow and river" (11. 6-8). Both ambiguous and fascinating, these images resurrect the trees in all their vigor onto the poetic scene. To achieve this scope, the poet loads the nouns "cages" and "shadow" with a metaphorical charge which is not attenuated by their referentiality. Although they indicate the real objects perceived by the observer, the leaves and their shadow acquire multiple "translated" meanings through substitu- tion, contiguity, onomatopoeia, and syntactic manipulation. Neither pure referents nor proper metaphors, they are close to the Romantic notion of symbols, since they incarnate the heterogeneous and mysterious essence of the world with their semantic opacity.37 Let us first examine the "airy cages." To describe the positive function fulfilled by the poplars, the poet equates their foliage to cages that imprison the aggressive sun (equated to a "leaping" wild beast) and thus guarantee the</page><page sequence="13">MARIACONCETTA COSTANT1M / 499 safety of their ecosystem. In line 3, however, the ideas of hostility and protec- tion are suddenly reversed: the trees become the victims of human beings, who mount an assault against the very creatures that used to screen them from excessive light and heat. Deeply ironic for its implications, this reversal of roles is anticipated by the verbs "quelled" and "quenched," whose ambi- guity of form, tense, and meaning prefigures the destruction of the trees. A first element that connotes the trees as vulnerable is the "potential" passivity of the two verbs, which is suggested both morphologically and phonetically (i.e. as regular verbs, they might be either simple pasts or past perfects; and their rhyming with "felled" transfers to them the idea of suffering violence). On the semantic plane, the sense of helplessness is reinforced by the primary meaning of "quelled" and the archaic meaning of "quenched," which both imply that the poplars are suppressed by their human antagonists. Quite effec- tive also is the Miltonic intertextuality of "quenched," which anticipates the simile of the blinded eye in lines 14-15 (compare the link "quenched"- "sleek and seeing ball" with the following quotation from Samson Agonistes: "why was the sight / To such a tender ball as th' eye confin'd / So obvious and so easie to be quencht"38). By laying stress on the agon offerees, the poet achieves a double scope. First of all, he suggests that nature is not monolithic, but consists of a large variety of elements, whose interaction grants the continuity of life on earth. In spite of its warfare connotations, the contest between the sun and the trees is a generator of positive energy which contributes to preserving the en- vironmental balance. This idea is strengthened by the intricate web of sound parallels, such as the paronomastic game "leaves"- "leaping," which audibly renders the transfer of energy from the sun to the vegetation. In Hopkins' view, it is only human beings who interfere with or break seasonal cycles. Tree-felling, for example, proves to be a dangerous activity, since it annihilates the beings that draw life from various inorganic substances. This latter idea is suggested by the juxtaposition of images that connect the poplars with the four basic elements (air, fire, water, and earth are respectively evoked by the "airy cages," the sun's heat, the idea of a liquid that "quenches" thirst, and the soil into which the trees are rooted). A further shade of meaning is added by the underlying reference to photosynthesis. As Brian J. Day convincingly argues, the "airy cages" can be interpreted as vegetal "lungs . . . transform- ing one form of energy into another."39 Such a view is intriguing, because it confirms the idea of a continuous exchange and transformation of matter in the natural world. The polysemy of the initial trope demonstrates the poet's ability to represent the complexity of the trees and their environment. The same impression is given by the semantic intricacy of the "sandalled Shadow." Musically announced by the insistent alliteration and other sound patterns,</page><page sequence="14">500 / VICTORIAN POETRY the coalescing function of this image is potentiated by the kinetic quality of the shades ("swam or sank") and of the three elements mentioned in line 8 (the "wind," "river," and "bank" representing air, water, and earth). Taken together, their sinuous movements convey the idea of a varied, life-palpitat- ing nature. Especially noteworthy is the compound "weed-winding." The isophonic and isomorphic connections it establishes between the winding plants and river highlight the crucial function fulfilled by water in favoring natural growth. It is scarcely possible to avoid comparison with the closing lines of "Inversnaid" (1881), in which the nexus water-plants is seen as the germinating nucleus of nature: What would the world be, once bereft Of wet and of wildness? Let them be left, O let them be left, wildness and wet; Long live the weeds and the wilderness yet. (11. 13-16) The final prayer "Let them be left" confirms the ecological preoccupations of the poet, who advocates the protection of vegetal life as requisite for the survival of the world. With the same convinction, Gerard brings into focus the sense of human responsibility in "Binsey Poplars." To the prospect of erasing the "inscapes" of the world, of sparing no trees ("not one"), he opposes an alternative course of action: the preservation of natural beings. If people make the right choice, they can live in accord with nature and become part of its harmonic whole, as signalled by the "sandalled" human foot that merges into the tree shade. Such a reading is not in contrast with other interpretations of the past parti- ciple "sandalled," which might also suggest "a personal incarnation of some nature-spirit, either fairy or elf."40 The two implicatures of "sandalled" merge together with interesting results: they both convey the macro-idea of a physical world imbued with spirituality. Another aspect that requires attention is the anthropomorphic quality of the verb "dandled," which equates the poplars to a group of mothers fon- dling their babies. The verb seems to anticipate the feminine personification of the countryside in lines 12-13. But its figurative use is more complex than it appears. First of all, it evokes an idea of parental strength which questions nature's vulnerability. In comparison with the human creatures they "dandle," the trees acquire the authoritative status of parents that protect and forgive their misbehaving children. This reading is validated by a popular tradition which, from time immemorial, has associated poplars with various myths of death and resurrection. Because of his keen interest in folklore and etymol- ogy, Gerard must have been familiar with a number of these legends. He was probably aware that in most European countries the aspen is connected with the crucifixion of Christ. And he must have known that, in the pagan world, white and black poplars were funereal symbols associated with dif-</page><page sequence="15">MARIACONCETTA COSTANTINI / 501 ferent images of death and rebirth. Apart from indicating the threshold of Hades, poplars were also sacred to the Great Mother, the cosmic dispenser of death and life,41 These legendary elements enhance, rather than weaken, the life-giving quality of the Binsey poplars. The "maternal" role they perform biologically is given an imaginative support by the set of traditional stories. Once again, Gerard distances himself from Manley, whose recourse to myth decreased the actuality of the lime trees. To the anthropocentric attitude of his father, who foresaw ecological disaster only to lament a change in human values, the son opposes a genuine preoccupation for the survival of natural life. It is no coincidence that the first stanza of "Binsey Poplars" opens and closes with images of luxuriant vegetation. To fight the sterility of tree-felling, which is linguistically reproduced by the tautological statements in lines 3 and 5, Gerard elaborates two powerful images of nature that englobe and subsume mankind itself. A marked shift in tone and imagery is introduced in line 9, where the plural "we" problematizes the relationship between the speaker and the poplars. After manifesting his sympathy for the felled trees, the poetic voice joins the ranks of the exterminators and involves the reader himself in the experience. Their sense of responsibility is increased in line 19, where the materialization of other sufferers, the "After-comers" (1. 19), complicates the actantial dichotomy "we" versus "they." Confronted with the human victims of their actions, the speaker and the reader have a clearer view of the negative consequences and are more easily persuaded to avoid damaging their descen- dants. The perlocutionary effects produced by the pronominal pattern are also evident in lines 13 and 17, where the pronoun "her" equates the countryside to a violated or slaughtered woman. A traditional device, which Darwin himself was at pains to avoid, the female personification of nature makes its desecration more painful to con- ceive.42 In this regard, Gerard seems to follow his father's model Like Manley, who feminized the trees with classical allusions (the Dryads, the mythical significance of lime trees), Gerard applies gendered connotations to the conflict man/nature, which is turned into an intraspecific struggle between strong and weak human beings.43 This process is synecdochally continued in lines 14-15, where the simile of the eye turns landscape into a body part (the deictic "this" and the Miltonic echo contribute to our perception of the eye as human). The erotic connotations of the blinding, which is achieved through penetration ("But a prick will make no eye at all"), consolidate the frightful meaning of the prosopopeia of country to woman to eye. Metaphori- cally dwindled to the size of an eye, nature appears an easy prey of its human antagonists. But the latter are also injured by the effects of their own aggres- sion, since they deprive themselves and their descendants of the pleasure of</page><page sequence="16">502 / VICTOR/AN POETRY "seeing" natural beauty. A further shift in figurative language occurs in the last five lines. Here the speaker uses incremental repetition to restore the centrality of nature. But his scope is only partly achieved. The threatening noises of the "strokes of havoc" and the dimness of the "sweet especial rural scene" make a stark contrast with the initial images of vegetal life. Considerably limited in its referentiality (notice the absence of locodescriptive details, while the number of the strokes is accurately indicated), the scene is also devoid of metaphorical vividness and complexity. The vague qualifiers "sweet" and "especial," and the negative affixation of "unselve," give it an indefinite quality, which is at variance with the imposing, gorgeous beauty of the poplar-lined "weed-wind- ing" bank. Critics have different interpretations of the natural landscape outlined at the end of "Binsey Poplars." A poetic image that resuscitates the dead trees on the written page, according to Green and Lang-Graumann, the "rural scene" has been read as a setting of irredeemable loss by Nixon ("'Sweet especial rural scene/" p. 55) and praised by Carson for its realism, which is achieved by unifying "the sylvan and the feminine" through "incantatory repetitions."44 All these interpretations can be endorsed. The "rural scene" is indeed a recollection of the landscape spoiled by the "strokes of havoc," a landscape that is poetically recreated but retains little of its original mul- tifarious beauty. The sense of loss is confirmed by the disappearance of the poplars from the scene. Not only their charming physical details are lacking. Their whole shapes have been wiped out, as implied by their grammatical substitution in line 22 (notice how they are replaced by the noun "scene" in their function of objects of "unselve"). The descriptive and figurative gaps with the first stanza raise some ques- tions we cannot avoid facing. Why does the poet introduce sudden changes in the modes of poetic representation? How can we explain the switch from the complexity of the initial tropes to the simplicity of the intermediate fig- ures (the personification of the woman and the simile of the eye)7. And what are the reasons for the final switch to a descriptive language that is neither metaphorical nor accurate? Before answering these questions, we should consider other signals of linguistic simplification that can be found in the second stanza. Shorter and syntactically plainer than most lines in the first stanza, lines 9-24 are character- ized by a higher recurrence of the same words, clauses, and sounds. The overall impression is that of a shrinking of linguistic variety and expressivity. The many examples of incremental repetition (11. 16, 20, 22-24), and the repetition with variation "When we delve or hew"- "When we hew or delve" (11. 10, 18), are indicative of this tendency. Both devices give a monotone quality to language, which becomes almost claustrophobic in the latter case. With their tautologi-</page><page sequence="17">MARIACONCETTA COSTANTINI / 503 cal structure and meaning, the repetitive clauses decree the inescapability of nature's doom, which is already suggested by the two tropes they encircle (the personification and the simile). At a phonetic level, moreover, the pun "mend"- "end" (1. 17) confirms the curtailing of linguistic and ontological scopes. In spite of its pungent irony, which exposes the paradox of human agency, the pun is not remarkable for its wit or complexity. What it conveys is a dull image of waste which overshadows the healing possibilities implied by the verb "mend." In a similar way, the repetitive sound sequence in line 11 delineates a clear-cut dichotomy between mankind and nature. To emphasize the annihilation of natural beauty, the poet juxtaposes the straightforward pun "Hack and rack" with the alliterative sequence "growing green," whose linearity of meaning and structure substantiates the idea of devitalization (notice the contrast between its simplicity and the intricate pattern of growth represented in the first stanza). A loss of intensity is also signaled by the vague temporal and spatial markers "where" and "when" (11. 16, 18). The indistinct chronotope formed by their interconnection dissolves the contextual precision of the title. A similar effect of non-specificity is produced by the brusque change in tense in line 9, where the simple pasts are replaced by generalizing simple presents. This reduction of sharpness and referentiality parallels the above-mentioned shift in figurative language. By adopting a plainer syntax, vocabulary, and sound pattern, the poet confirms his intention to carry out a multi-levelled process of linguistic simplification. To the convoluted tropes of the first stanza, which convey meaning through juxtaposition and implication, he opposes two linear figures that are based on explicit predication and clear-cut divisions between the literal and the figurative. Quite puzzling if we consider Hopkins' linguistic inventiveness, which is ubiquitous in his oeuvre, this simplifying process must be read as an in- tentional device that should render the devastation of nature in its grimmest reality. In other words, Gerard manipulates language to give more actuality to the consequences of human actions. By limiting the creativity of his poetic medium, he lays stress on the ecological and ontological loss caused by the spoliation of landscape. Emblematic, in this sense, is his choice to close the poem with the unexpressive clause "sweet especial rural scene," which actual- izes the void left by the poplar-felling. To say this is not to imply that the poet yields to despair. His combative attitude is testified by the responsibility he takes for the destructive effects of human agency, as well as by the vitality of the initial tropes. By devising a number of strategies that gradually devalue the expressive power of language, he poetically recreates the effects of the historical erosion of natural beauty. The reader is thus forced to make a personal experience of deprivation, which reduplicates the poet's own experience of loss and stimulates a wider reflection</page><page sequence="18">504 / VICTORIAN POETRY on the consequences of human agency. As is well known, "Binsey Poplars" was not published during the poet's life. Excluded from the Miles anthology in 1893,45 it could never exercize its persuasive function on the poet's contemporaries. The irony of its belated publication is increased by comparison with "The Old Trees," which was (anon- ymously) printed and probably helped to rescue the lindens at Hampstead Heath. Although he was not endowed with his son's gift for poetry, Manley Hopkins raised his voice in defence of nature and took an active part in the public discussion of ecological issues. Gerard was never given such a chance. Unknown to the wide Victorian readership, he could not even experience the joy of saving his favorite trees. But he drew inspiration from his father's concerns to weave a passionate environmental discourse, which fascinates us with its topicality and its elaborate language. Like Manley, Gerard inherited a number of topoi and figures from a long-established tradition of nature poetry, which had tree imagery at its core. Their debt is evident in "The Old Trees" and "Binsey Poplars." Apart from using the Wordsworthian expedient of the revisited scene, father and son made recourse to personification, gendered natural images, and classical allusions that were common among their predecessors. They also dramatized a personal experience of loss (real or imagined) to represent the dismantling of the social and spiritual foundations of their world. But these similarities are overshadowed by a number of thematic and structural differences. While Manley privileged a subjective approach to nature and saw the lime trees as emblems of an alarming generational change, Gerard described the "slaughter" at Binsey to warn his fellow beings against the deterioration of a landscape infused with divine energy. The poplars that are brought back to life in the first stanza are the pivots of this spiritually imbued world, which risked be- ing drained by man's behavior. To recreate their essence and restore their ontological value, Gerard exploited a figurative language that owed much to Romantic theories. From this legacy, he derived the forceful images of the "cages" and the "shadow," whose fertile polysemy recreates the multifarious beauty of the endangered naturescape. The symbolic richness of the first stanza makes a sharp contrast with the derivative simile and the colorless personification of the second stanza. By suddenly changing his linguistic strategies, the poet strives to highlight the sense of natural spoliation that was consequent on the felling. First used to incarnate the beauty and vitality of the poplars, his figurative language is later sapped of its strength to convey a gloomier, and authentic, sense of waste. Quite different from Manley's stereotyped, "ornamental" figures, Gerard's images of tree-growth and tree-felling confirm the originality of his nature tropes. From this angle, it is somewhat ironic that the father outlived the son. Despite his wish to "leave the stage" before the collapse of his value system,</page><page sequence="19">MARIACONCETTA COSTANTIM / 505 Manley passed away eight years after Gerard, whose ecocritical discourse had opened up new paths of philosophical and poetic experimentation.

On the basis of archival documents, this essay offers a full-detailed account of the Well Walk controversy and the role played by Manley Hopkins. In information not provided in this essay, Nixon sent me the following: "Manley Hopkins was elected a trustee at the Thursday, 11 December, 1873, meeting of the Wells Charity and Board of Management. . . . The following list of the names of Gentlemen residing in the Hampstead District was then agreed to as being the most proper persons to be suggested by the Trustees to form the new Board for carrying out the new Scheme.' Thus duly elected, Manley Hopkins served the Charity with great distinction. He attended almost all of its meetings, chaired one of them (19 March, 1879) and was secretary in another (19 July, 1879). He also served on the Wells &amp;. Campden Charity Scholarships Committee to award tuition to Hampstead's bright but needy students. The last meeting on record that Manley Hopkins attended was the one for June 15, 1881, at which time he had served for some eight years, a truly remarkable record of civic duty judged by any standard. At the 20 November, 1878 meeting, 'An amendment [was] moved by Mr. Smith and seconded by Mr. Hopkins unmending the adoption of a plan (No. 3) by which the greater part of the central line of trees in Well Walk would be preserved was put &lt;Sl lost.' At the very next meeting, on December 18, 1878, the petition signed by the 548 inhabitants of Hampstead was read 'protesting against the removal of the trees in Well Walk.' A letter from Mr. Henry Sharpe of 30 Well Walk was also read. It was at this meeting that Plan No. 3 was adopted because it was felt that 'the proposed removal would rather diminish than increase the attractiveness of the estate for building purposes.' Understandably disappointed over the earlier lost vote and now invigorated by the strong parish support emerging from the signature campaign, Manley Hopkins went home and fired off his poem, 'The Old Trees,' which was published ten days later in the Hampstead &amp; Highgate Express for 28 December 1878" (Wells Charity and Board of Management Minute Book 1857.

The expression "little lyric" is used by the poet himself in a later letter to Bridges {Letters, p. 78). 9 Harold Bloom, The Anxiety of Influence (New York: Oxford Univ. Press, 1973). Although he did not exhibit many symptoms of "anxiety of influence," Gerard felt the need to make his own aesthetic choices and avoided direct "borrowing" from his father- poet. 10 Aidan Day, Romanticism (London: Routledge, 1996), particularly pp. 39-64. 11 The trees were indeed saved by the public protest staged by Hampstead residents (Nixon, p. 207). 1 2 The connection between Eve and married love is explored in different terms by Manley in the poem "Eva," in which a tragic story of seduction and abandonment is juxta- posed with the joys of wedding (Spicilegium Poeticum: A Gathering of Verses by Manley Hopkins [London, 1892], pp. 90-94). Another poem included in Spicilegium Poeticum, "I Trembled So," is strongly reminiscent of "The Old Trees": "I trembled so, that eve, when in the gloom / Of tassel'd limes, you first revealed your love! / The air faint with the linden's perfumed bloom, / And summer-warm, no zephyr dared to move" (p. 61, 11. 1-4). By comparing the two poems, we will find a number of contextual and linguistic parallels (the lovers' meeting under the lindens, the reference to the lime- tree scent, the temporal marker "eve," the adjective "tassel'd") which confirm Nixon's claim that Manley was the author of "The Old Trees." 13 There is a clear numerical connection between the span of fifty years mentioned in the "The Old Trees" and the five years elapsed before Wordsworth's return to Tintern Abbey. From a biographical viewpoint, Manley's choice of the time marker is rather implausible, since he only moved to Hampstead with his wife and his family in 1852. 14 It is easy to hypothesize an intertextual link with the "dome of pleasure" and the visionary experience described by Coleridge in "Kubla Khan" (1797-1798). 15 "Thyrsis" (1866), The Poems of Matthew Arnold, ed.

The expression "dynamic organicism" is applied to Hopkins by Jude V.

A good insight into the Romantic legacy that Hopkins received through Ruskin is offered by Patricia M. Ball, who thus sums up the outcome: "We see then how Hopkins draws on the highly developed Romantic awareness of identity, with its emotional force and sense of relationship, and infuses this into his Ruskinian scrutiny of the object" (The Science of Aspects: The Changing Role of Fact in the Word of Coleridge, Ruskin and Hopkins [London: Athlone Press, 1971], pp. 108-109). For a detailed analysis of Ruskin's influence on Gerard, see also Catherine Phillips, Gerard Manley Hopkins and the Victorian Visual World (New York: Oxford Univ.

In the first passage, Ruskin reconstructs a brief history of Western painting by laying stress on the differences among pictorial representations of aspens. In the second passage, he makes an accurate description of some aspens he saw in France (The Works of John Ruskin, ed. E. T. Cook and Alexander Wedderburn, 39 vols.

It is significant that the letter dates to March 19, 1879, a few days before Gerard started to write "Binsey Poplars." A few months later, on June 22, 1879, he would speak of "d- d subjective rot" in a letter to Bridges {Letters, p. 84). 31 '"Magnam capacitatem et ambitum mundi'- This suggests that 'pomegranate,' that pomum possibilium" (The Sermons and Devotional Writings of Gerard Manley Hopkins, ed.

On this point, see also an essay by Dennis Sobolev, who dismisses the idea of ideological incongruities in Gerard's oeuvre and lays stress on the constant oscillation of his thoughts. A consequence of the poet's exposure to "diverse and heterogeneous dis- courses," the tensions articulated in Hopkins' writing are neither logically contradictory nor poetically limiting, since they originate the "semantic multiplicity" that marks the distinction of his poetry (Sobolev, "Semantic Counterpoint and the Poetry of Gerard Manley Hopkins," VLC 35, no. 1 [2007]: 103-119). 34 It seems that the cutting down at Binsey was not recorded in the Oxford newspapers of the time (Nixon, "'Sweet especial rural scene,'" pp. 42-43). But the lack of historical documents is no reason to question the date indicated by GMH. Although it might only refer to the time of the poet's discovery of the poplars' fate, the year 1879 is deliberately indicated to contextualize the felling, which was certainly carried out between 1867 and 1879. 35 For a definition of the "actant" and different models of actantial arrangement see the works of Algirdas Julien Greimas, in particular "Les actants, les acteurs et les figures," Semiotique narrative et textualk, ed. Claude Chabrol (Paris: Larousse, 1973), pp. 161- 176. 36 A similar effect is produced by the felling of an ashtree which Gerard describes in a journal entry dated April 8, 1873. Apart from expressing his anguish at the violent sight, the viewer underlines the ontological implications of the event, which destroys "the inscapes of the world" (Journals, p. 230). 37 The complexity of Hopkins' figurative language has always posed theoretical problems to scholars, whose views range from extended to cautious definitions of his metaphoric- ity. See, among others, Robert Boyle, Metaphor in Hopkins (Chapel Hill: Univ. of North Carolina Press, 1960); James Milroy, The Language of Gerard Manley Hopkins (London: Andre Deutsch, 1977); Cary Plotkin, "Ametaphoricity and Presence in Hopkins's Poetics," HQ 31, no. 1-4 (Winter-Fall 2004): 43-68. 38 John Milton, The Complete Poems, ed.

But her insistence on the manliness of the aspens is questionable. Although the clause "folded rank" might apply to a row of soldiers, the simile of the blinded eye does not suggest castration, but rather evokes an image of female violation (A Queer Chivalry: The Homoerotic Asceticism of Gerard Manley Hopkins [Charlottesville: Univ.
