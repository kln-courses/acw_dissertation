<plain_text><page sequence="1">"The fact of firstness": A Preface William V. Spanos that we are only as we find out we are - Charles Olson, The Maximus Poems No forms less than activity - Robert Creeley, Pieces This special issue of boundary 2 on the work of Robert Creeley represents, for me, a first gathering of a continuing dialogue with Creeley's writing that began in the spring of 1965 on the occasion of his visit to Knox College to read and to talk on the contemporary literary scene. At that time, I, like most everyone else in the academy, was disseminating in my classrooms the established New Critical doctrines of the autonomy of the poem, the priority of the whole over its parts, and the "intrinsic" or 1</page><page sequence="2">AiAi !!!iii!ii! iiii!i l,,-d i~t ,,; ,;, i! ;i~i! ....,? ti/ 7 i~ltL4tt 4/4</page><page sequence="3">"objective" method of reading. The good poem was interpreted as an ironic or paradoxical construct and the tradition was seen as teleological historical order, the beginning and end of which was Europe, I mean the idea of Europe. Creeley came to Knox as bearer of a new word - or rather of words. Perhaps it would be more accurate, at least in my case, to say that he came to disperse the Word, thus disclosing what the Word encircled, fixed - and concealed: the things themselves. And his text was, generously, Charles Olson's Maximus Poems: Holes in my shoes, that's all right, my fly gaping, me out at the elbows, the blessing that difficulties are once more "In the midst of plenty, walk as close to bare In the face of sweetness, piss In the time of goodness, go side, go smashing, beat them, go as (as near as you can tear In the land of plenty, have nothing to do with it take the way of the lowest, including your legs, go contrary, go sing ("The Songs of Maximus") Or in a different but equally dislocating modality: ... I'll put care where you are, on those streets I know as well (or better: I have the advantage I was a letter carrier, read postcards, lamped checks, talked 2</page><page sequence="4">at the back doors I'll meet you anywhere you say (the beer's best - the pipes are kept cleaner - at the Anchor Inn (as the old captain called his bar, with an old name. You see I can't get away from the old measure of care ... I'll try once more to meet you (what about Sterling's Drug, is that where you are? Surely, not at the Library, or you'd at least show that correction which so many of the other little magazines now so show, the school-boy Renaissance The mind, Ferrini, is as much of a labor as to lift an arm flawlessly Or to read sand in the butter on the end of a lead, and be precise about what sort of bottom your vessel's over ("Letter 5") My immediate response to Creeley's quietly insistent proposal of a new, a projective, an open, verse, a verse one was given to write, a verse that was the measure of its occasion, was active resistance. I could not see how the measure of such a "willess" poetry could be a measure at all, at least as I then understood the word. But when, on that first evening in the reading room of Seymour Library, Creeley read from The Maximus Poems and For Love in that subdued and faltering voice - which was also intensely tentative and awesomely articulate . . . explorative, I want to say - I heard however faintly something I had the feeling I already knew. I heard a kind of music that my expectations vis-a-vis poetry, my received perceptual habit of seeing the sound of words, had previously closed off from my ear, a music from the edge: I think I grow tensions like flowers in a wood where nobody goes. 3</page><page sequence="5">Each wound is perfect, encloses itself in a tiny imperceptible blossom, making pain. Pain is a flower like that one, like this one, like that one, like this one. ("The Flower," For Love) Or again: To and back and forth, direction is a third or simple fourth of the intention like it goes and goes. No more snow this winter? No more snow. Then what replaces all the faces, wasted, wasted. ("To And," For Love) And once more: My lady fair with soft arms, what can I say to you - words, words as if all worlds were there. ("A Token," For Love) 4</page><page sequence="6">My luminous "golden" image of "the poem" somehow came through this quietly powerful assault intact. But the instrument, the hammer, that had shaped that image - "to keep a drowsy Emperor awake," as it were - was broken. Like it or not the measure I heard had forced me to leap into the hermeneutic circle "wholly and primordially," as Heidegger would say. Despite my reluctance to let it happen, Creeley's poetry, and through it the poetry of those on the edges of "the American tradition" from Whitman to Williams, Zukofsky, Pound, Olson, Duncan, Ginsberg, Snyder, Dorn and Antin, had suddenly been transformed into voices that insisted on being heard .... That was the beginning. Precisely because Creeley's poetry evoked my resistance, my extended dialogue with it eventually made explicit to me that the New Critical understanding of measure as spatialized sound, as pictured words, implied a poetics behind which lies the will to power over existence. This poetics makes writing and reading a privileged act of coercion of "the things themselves": the occasion and the words which are the cry of their occasion. "I am given to write poems," Creeley was insisting, contrary to the traditional Western idea of poet as privileged author. "That body," Creeley says, referring to Allen Ginsberg's "Song," yes, yes, that's what I wanted, I always wanted, I always wanted, to return to the body where I was born. - "That body is the 'field' and is equally the experience of it. It is, then, to 'return' not to oneself as some egocentric center, but to experience oneself as in the world, thus, through this agency or fact we call, variously, 'poetry' " (A Quick Graph, p. 69). My dialogue with Creeley's poetry, in other words, was - and continues to be - a process of learning how to listen. Or rather, it has been a process of re-learning, of remembering, how to listen. For it has also helped make explicit to me that the privileged status of visual perception and the consequent covering up and forgetting of the possibilities of the other senses - the invisible, as it were - in modern criticism constitutes the "end" of a literary history analogous to the history of Western thought (and, indeed, a particular expression of that thought) as described by the phenomenologists: What [by way of the influence of Husserl and Heidegger] is being called visualism here as a symptom [of Western 5</page><page sequence="7">philosophical thinking] is the whole reductionist tendency which in seeking to purify experience, belies its richness at the source. A turn to the auditory dimension is thus potentially more than a simple changing of variables. It begins as a deliberate decentering of a dominant tradition in order to discover what may be missing as a result of the traditional double reduction of vision as the main variable or metaphor. This deliberate change of emphasis from the visual to the auditory dimension at first symbolizes a hope to find material for a recovery of the richness of primary experience which is now forgotten or covered over in the too tightly interpreted visualist traditions. It might even be . . . suspected that precisely some of the range of phenomena at present most difficult for a visualist tradition might yield more readily to an attention which is more concerned with listening. For example, symbolically, it is the invisible which poses a series of almost insurmountable problems for much contemporary philosophy. "'Other minds" or persons who fail to disclose themselves in their "inner" invisibility; the "Gods" who remain hidden; my own "self" which constantly eludes a simple visual appearance; the whole realm of spoken and heard language must remain unsolvable so long as our seeing is not also a listening. It is the invisible that listening may attend. (Don Ihde, Listening and Voice: A Phenomenology of Sound [Athens, Ohio: Ohio University Press, 1976], p. 14) However accidental, this relationship between Creeley's poetry and contemporary phenomenological thinking is not, I think, an arbitrary one. I have been persuaded that Creeley's impulse to destroy or, what is the same thing, to de-center the tradition and thus to retrieve the voice of poetry from the Platonic eye of Modernist criticism - the eye that overlooks the minute particulars, the processes, of existence in its effort to comprehend them - is part of a larger goal. Perhaps more than others of that "company" who, as Olson says in The Maximus Poems, "hark back to an older polis" than the pejorocracy of our time, Creeley is expressing an impulse remarkably at one with and equally compelling as that which lies behind the essentially postmodern project of Husserl and especially Heidegger - a project, by the way, initiated by William James in his commitment to a "radical empiricism" and thus as American as it is European. I am, of course, referring to what Heidegger has called the 6</page><page sequence="8">"surpassing" of the hardened Western humanistic tradition and its disastrously coercive anthropomorphism by interrogating, by opening up that which the tradition, in its very nature, closes off. To be more precise, this project lets the be-ing of Being show itself: Things come and go. Then let them. ("A Step," Pieces) or, what is virtually the same thing, retrieves the beginning. Here in his commentary on Olson's celebration of nakedness in "Maximus, to Gloucester" is Creeley's version of this retrieval: in the fact of our lives we are brought to primary situations, primary terms of experience - what they might have meant by "first things first" but probably didn't. "Nakedness" is to stand manifestly in one's own condition, in that necessary freshness, however exposed, because all things are particular and reality itself is the specific content of an instant's possibility. In poems we realize, not in discursive or secondary manner, but with this implicit and absolutely consequential fact of firstness, terms of our own life, manifestations of that life which, otherwise, are most awkwardly "ack- knowledged." It is, again, that "field" that Robert Duncan speaks of as being "permitted" to enter. First things. We arrive in poems at the condition of life most viable and most primal in our own lives. (A Quick Graph, p. 68) And here, in his de-struction of the metaphysical tradition, is Heidegger's: To ask "How does it stand with being?" means nothing less than to recapture, to repeat (wieder-holen) the beginning of our historical-spiritual existence, in order to transform it into a new beginning. This is possible. It is indeed the crucial form of history, because it begins in the fundamental event. But we do not repeat a beginning by reducing it to something past and now known, which need merely be imitated; no, the beginning must be begun again more radically, with all the strangeness, 7</page><page sequence="9">darkness, insecurity that attend a true beginning. Repetition ... is anything but an improved continuation with the old method [read "measure"] of what has been up to now. (An Introduction to Metaphysics [New York: Anchor Books, 1961], p. 32) At the heart of this beginning, it is crucial to insist, is not, as a Derridean analysis of speech would have it, the something of illo tempore, but the nothing - the absence of presence, the infinitely deferred end - which is precisely our case, our occasion, and which calls forth our fallen and dispersed measure: words. It is, finally, this fragile and grand cosmic resonance that I have come to hear over the years in what has been called Creeley's "minimalist" poetry: One and one, two, three ("A Piece," Words) And it is the delicately sublime resonance of this measure - so different yet finally so similar, in its refusal to be taken hold of by the mind's hand, to the bardic magnitude of Olsons's, of Duncan's, of Ginsberg's line - that has convinced me that Robert Creeley is one of the most important poets - if not the most important - writing in America today. He was then, when I first heard him read, and still is, as Olson observed, "the figure of outward." This issue of boundary 2 is, therefore, both a gesture of personal gratitude and an act of gathering that will begin the process' of making the still obscure sources of that gratitude more explicit. To be sure, not all the essays by any means conform to my reading (or misreading) of Creeley's writing. Nor, in the process of inviting the contributions, did I intend them to. The critical orientations and disclosures are as diverse as the occasion of a first gathering demands. As such they constitute a tribute to the poet's elusiveness, his postmodern resistance to being named. Within this pluralism, however, there runs a thread, a thread that perhaps leads nowhere in either direction - to the minotaur at the center or to the light beyond the circumference - but nevertheless a thread: an awareness of a poet who always and, to appropriate once more a favorite word of Creeley's, insistently is a man-in-the-world, who says in the generous measure that emerges from that "fact of firstness."
