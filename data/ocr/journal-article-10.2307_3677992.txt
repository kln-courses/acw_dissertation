<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF IDEALISM AND REALISM. BY GUSTAVUS GEORGE ZERFFI, Esq., Ph.D., F.R.S.L., Fellow of the Royal Historical Society. II. ROMAN PERIOD. THROUGHOUT the whole of man's mental development, which word in itself excludes any repetition or stagnation in history, we can trace action and reaction, or rather, according to Hegel's dialectics, "progress by contrasts." Certain ideas take root in humanity. They blossom, bear fruits, and then die away. Similar ideas shoot up again; not the same, but full of a new vigour and vitality, rooted in an altogether changed soil; composed of the intellectual blossoms and fruits of a previous era, nourished by the totally different mode of thinking, the increased or decreased amount of knowledge of new genera- tions. This was the case with the acting and counteracting movements of idealism and realism in Greece. The ideas of Demokritos or Hippokrates were superseded by the idealistic arguments of Sokrates, whose principles formed the basis of the philosophies of Plato and Aristotle in the following cen- tury. The supernaturalism of Plato and the realism of Aris- totle both had their followers, who read and understood them differently. We have first the celebrated physicist Strato, who looked upon the vou^s of Aristotle as a mere conscious- ness of impressions. The activity of the soul was with him simply motion. He explained all existence and life as ori- ginating in the natural forces with which matter is endowed. Strato led to Epikurus, who was counteracted by the Stoiks, who, despite their professed idealism, were the most prominent materialists in physical science. We can trace an analogous</page><page sequence="2">HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF IDEALISM AND REALISM. 305 phenomenon in our own times in which it often occurs, that men with theologically biased minds in metaphysical matters are the most pronounced realists where natural sciences are concerned. Like the ancient Greeks of the times of Plato and Aristotle, we too stand at the beginning of a new period that is about to detach itself from the past, and to seek a new basis for our mental, social, and philosophical development. Wherever we find such a transition state in history, we see men leaving the path of speculation, and devoting themselves unconditionally to the study of outward nature. To know at such a moment is to know the properties of stones, plants, gases, elements, and nothing further. All speculation is avoided as mere waste of time. Ethics and esthetics are considered mere outgrowths of crude matter, over which the individual has no control. Whilst men repeat the outward formulae of metaphysicians, they counteract what they often call dreamy and useless speculations. Generalisations begin to be neglected as mere arbitrary assumptions of some over- heated imagination, and all fly to particular individualisations, to technical specialities. They try to separate and to detach the different branches of science, and instead of philosophers and thinkers who can grasp different phenomena with broad minds as connected wholes, we see ourselves surrounded by numbers of isolated electric, geological, biological, chemical, botanical, zoological, and mineralogical rattling word machines, in whom every higher intellectual conception is smothered by a heap of specialities, who may sometimes be brimful of details, but who, from a philosophical point of view, stand at Reau- mur's freezing-point-ZERO. This phenomenon we can also trace in Greece. The support afforded to the consciousness of the individual by state and religion was broken to pieces; and the philosophers, despite their contempt for idealism, studied matter only for the purpose of securing for them- selves happiness, freedom, and peace of the mind, the very highest idealistic goods of humanity. Like some expounders of Ecclesiastes, the Stoics at first sight were the most consequent materialists. God and the soul, U</page><page sequence="3">306 TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL HISTORICAL SOCIETY. virtue and passions, were all bodies. There could scarcely be a greater contrast than that between Plato and the Stoics. Yet the Stoics were, after all, greater idealists than either Plato or the commentators on Ecclesiastes, who exclaim: "I know there is no good in them, but for a man to rejoice and to do good in his life. And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the good of all his labour. I said in my heart con- cerning the estate of the sons of men that God might mani- fest them, and that they might see that they themselves are beasts. For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them; as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath, so that a man hath no pre-eminence above a beast; for all is vanity. All go unto one place, all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again." This is a far less exalted view than that of the Stoics, who assumed that the different forces working in matter were directed by a force of all forces-the Deity. They did not propound spirit and matter as absolutely sepa- rated entities, but their matter was in all its smallest particles endowed with a soul, which soul pervaded also the universe, and was identical with it. At the same time the Deity was with them more than mere matter set into motion; it was " the fiery reason of the world," producing what is reasonable, teleological, as Diogenes of Apollonia asserted, according to general laws, which are inborn in man's consciousness, and which he cannot acquire by mere contemplation, or by experi- menting on visible and tangible objects. Whilst pessimism, con- tempt of every higher aspiration, satisfaction with that which has been, and is, and shall be for ever, was the outgrowth of a philosophy based on the misunderstood principles of Ecclesiastes, the Stoics paved the way to anthropomorphism, teleology, and optimism, for the fundamental idea of their philosophy was a mighty pantheistic conception. Whilst by some ancient Jews we were classed with mere beasts, and were advised to eat well and drink well, which was the old Egyptian Epikureanism, divested of all philosophical beauty, the Stoics taught that all our actions were the direct</page><page sequence="4">HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF IDEALISM AND REALISM. 307 manifestations of our will; which will, in its turn, is the purest, innermost essence of every man, the efflux of necessity and Divine Providence, pervading the universe in its smallest parti- cles. Man is responsible even for his innermost thoughts, for thoughts engender words, and words deeds; and the purity and morality of our thoughts must produce purity of words, and morality in deeds. These are undoubtedly the ethic principles of Zoroaster which are here brought into a philoso- phical shape. The soul with the Stoics, though of a material nature, was thought to live on after death. The wicked and unwise souls, composed of a less pure essence, were to perish more quickly; whilst the good and virtuous souls raised them- selves to an abode of bliss, where they would rest till the great destruction of the universe by fire, when everything would flow back to the Divine source whence it emanated. However exalted the ethic principles of the Stoics were, those of Epikurus surpassed them, in so far as they estab- lished a greater union between ethics and physics, between our moral and material nature. Zeno, the founder of Stoi- cism, tried to bring union into the dualistic notions of Aris- totle, whose assumption of a transcendental Deity in opposi- tion to the visible world acted upon by Him, and separation of the animal body and its vivifying immortal spirit, served during the whole period of the Middle Ages as a powerful support for the Christians' broken consciousness, striving up- wards from the dust, and thirsting for eternal salvation. This was not so with the proud antarchy of the Stoics. With them all bodies were spirits, or all spirits, even with the moving force in them, were mere bodies. Bodies were assumed to be mere expansions in space, and thus the distinction between body and spirit was not very great. The deeper speculations concerning space and time, however, belong to the nineteenth century; and we may pass to an inquiry into the principles of Epikurus. This greatly misunderstood and calumniated philosopher was the son of a poor shoemaker of Athens, who gained by lot a colonial share in Samos, where Epikurus was born, 342</page><page sequence="5">308 TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL HISTORICAL SOCIETY. or 341 B.C. When fourteen years old he read Hesiod's " Cos- mogony" at school, and when he came to the passage, that all things originated in chaos, he asked quickly, "And where did the chaos come from ?" His master could not answer the question, and from that time Epikurus began to think for himself, that is, from that time he became a philosopher, for a philosopher is one who dares to think independently. When eighteen years of age Epikurus went to Athens, and there heard Xenokrates, a pupil of Plato, whilst Aristotle, who had been accused of blasphemy and ungodliness, awaited the end of his life at Chalkis. Thebes was destroyed, Demosthenes languished in exile; from Asia joyous news of the glorious conquests of Alexander the Great resounded. The East was once more brought into relation with the Greeks, who began to lose their national particularism, and to influence humanity at large with their mighty philosophical ideas. But Alex- ander died suddenly at Babylon, and a last convulsive effort at freedom was made by the Athenians, but at once sup- pressed by Antipater. Epikurus retired from Athens, and is said to have lived at Kolophon, Mitylene, and Lampsakus, and only returned to Athens when an elderly man. He bought himself a garden, and lived there with his disciples. On the entrance to this garden the following inscription could be read: "Stranger, here you will feel delighted; here the highest happiness is joy." Epikurus was a perfect pattern of a wise and worldly man. He loved his country, though he never took office. He observed the usual religious ceremonies without ever believing in the gods, as the masses did. He taught that the gods must be honoured, since they never interfere with the eternal laws, according to which the phe- nomena of nature must happen. Some consciousness of the gods appeared to Epikurus a necessity for the higher develop- ment of man's nobler nature. The deities were to him beings of perfection; to honour them as such, not merely to believe in them, was essential with him. He was no hypocrite-his gods stood above care and pain, passion and wretchedness, therefore he worshipped them as representatives or as "eidola"</page><page sequence="6">HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF IDEALISM AND REALISM. 309 of the fundamental principles of his philosophy. Thus, whilst he tried to free humanity from foolish superstitions, he was able to promulgate theories which were to serve humanity as a truthful basis for a sound philosophy. Eternal order pervaded the phenomena of creation and destruction. To trace this order was to be the duty of the physicist. A merely historical knowledge of the phenomena of nature had with Epikurus as little value as the knowledge of isolated facts in man's history could have, if both studies were not based on an endeavour to ascertain the causes of the phe- nomena. The more we strive to become conscious of the causes that produce changes in the outer and inner phe- nomena of our religious, social, or natural conditions, the more surely do we attain the "peace of contemplation," which must be the highest delight of a thinking, self- conscious being. His most important theory bore upon the belief in a future state of things. The question resolved itself into the possibility of personal consciousness after death, and the possibility of sensations for a soul without the organs of our five senses. " Death ought to be utterly indifferent," for it deprives us of sensations and consciousness. "So long as we are, death is not there; as soon as death sets in, we are no more." "There is no evil for him in this world who has convinced himself that it is no evil not to live." This apparently hopeless theory did not, with Epikurus, lead to mere sensual enjoyment. On the contrary, he clearly declared that only virtue could give us the highest delight and pleasure, and that we ought to love and practise virtue for its own sake. Ethically, Epikurus stood on the same level as his opponents Zeno and Chrisippus. The starting-points undoubtedly dif- fered. With Zeno virtue was to be our aim to enable us to become good; with Epikurus wisdom was everything, so that we might become virtuous. The more we study and dive into the historical development of humanity, the more we become convinced that idealists and realists aim at the same goal, their differences consisting only in their starting-points. With Epikurus, physics (natural philosophy) was to lead to 48</page><page sequence="7">310 TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL HISTORICAL SOCIETY. ethics; whilst with Zeno ethics were to lead to goodness. Epikurus wished to free humanity from ignorance, which is based on fear and restless hopes. Research and study must lead to the conviction that everything, not only in the material, but also in the world of impressions, sensations, and consciousness, must be subject to order and law, both of which must be universal. The advantage of this assertion is immense; it must produce a more correct appreciation of facts, which, if they can with probability be explained as natural, ought never to be explained by an assumption of the supernatural. The assumption of the supernatural must obstruct the path of every searcher for truth, and lead us to the same result as the assumption "that there is nothing new." The intellectual or dynamic force working in humanity is, however, more and more bent upon discarding the super- natural, and strives to give intelligible answers to the most mysterious questions. Like Demokritos, Epikurus also asserted that of nothing nothing could come; for if the contrary were true, out of everything everything might be formed. "Everything existing must be a body, only space can be bodiless. Some bodies are composed, others are simple, forming combinations. The universe is boundless, and so must be the bodies filling it. Atoms are in eternal motion-there was no beginning of this motion, nor will there be an end of it. Atoms possess no other qualities but those of size, form, and weight." We see that our most advanced materialists or realists have continually to use Demokritos and Epikurus. "Atoms" are assumed by Epi- kurus "as smaller than any measurable or ponderable quantities. Time, in which the atoms move in the empty space, is relatively immeasurable. So are the atoms, and their number is infinite, though the forms into which they unite are not infinite, although their variety is immense. Thus in a limited body the number and difference of the atoms is limited. There can be no absolute above or below in empty space. Though the relative directions of bodies may be innumerable, there may be assumed a re-</page><page sequence="8">HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF IDEALISM AND REALISM. 311 lative above and below. The soul is a refined air with an admixture of fire pervading the whole body; part of the living body, an organ, not an extraneous something that can exist by itself after the dissolution of the body." He further assumes that the body encloses the soul, and furnishes it with sensations and participates in them. Epikurus also tried to explain the origin of languages and sciences through natural laws. "Sensual perceptions are the basis of all con- sciousness." This one sentence explains many a curious phe- nomenon in the gradual development of humanity. If a mad- man sees a ghost, the ghost, so far as the perception of the madman is concerned, is a reality for him individually. If a philosopher explains certain phenomena in nature, and a theologian certain propensities of our moral nature, and if both assign to the relative phenomena certain causes, both may be true so far as the observers are concerned, and yet they may be at the same time utterly false in reference to the observed objects themselves. Epikurus served, more than many a modern metaphysician would like to admit, to further the propagation of individual visions as general truths. Epi- kurus was the propounder of what he called "canonical doctrines," and we must not be astonished to see his principles revived at a later period by the scholastic philosophers; for a distorted realistic Epikureanism and the most mystic idealism are often found in close and incomprehensible union. His system may be reduced to the following three fundamental principles: I. Self-knowledge. 2. Knowledge of the laws of nature. 3. Knowledge of the true laws of society. The accusation of atheism which has been launched against Epikurus is mere verbiage. To study nature and its laws, history and man in history, is not denying the Deity, but simply assuming our incompetence as finite beings to deal with the infinite. At the time when Epikurus ended his life in joyful happiness amongst a large circle of his disciples,</page><page sequence="9">312 TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL HISTORICAL SOCIETY. Alexandria was the centre of a new philosophical develop- ment. This new school is often looked upon as a mere pedan- tic dialectical outgrowth of the elder Greek philosophy; but this is far from a truthful appreciation of the vigorous and genial activity of thought which spread from Alexandria over the whole of the world. The collection of books, the earnest studies that were made in grammar, astronomy, history, geometry, statics, and anatomy, by thinkers like Aristarchus, Hipparchus, Polybius, Euklid, Archimedes, and Herophilus, are so many proofs, that though philosophy took a more realistic and less idealistic turn, it neither died out nor alto- gether slumbered. Alexandria was at that period the focus of all the intellectual powers of humanity. Indian, Hebrew, Egyptian, Greek, and Roman philosophers exchanged ideas, built up systems, and though divided into innumerable sects and schools, may all be classified as either strict idealists or strict realists, the Epikureans being their connecting links. He who once became an Epikurean was one for ever; once convinced of the realistic elements upon which the theories of Epikurus were founded, the cultivated reason of the sec- tarian could never see the good of any other disturbing, horrify- ing, or spiritually tormenting system in philosophy. This naturally leads us to the contemplation of Roman philosophy, which, in spite of the unphilosophic and super- stitious character of the Romans, was entirely Epikurean, with a gentle admixture of Stoicism at a later period. The Romans, notwithstanding the practical part which they played in the historical development of humanity, were exclusively idealistic, and their idealism may serve to explain the rough and coarse realism that obtained such hold on their minds in counter-action to their idealism. Their very state was founded on a mere abstraction; their laws were framed a priori; the formula, "Salus reipublicae suprema lex," is an ideal assumption. What did the word "salus" mean, and when did any Roman find it possible to bring this welfare of the republic into union with his individual happi- ness, without a thorough absorption of his own concrete</page><page sequence="10">HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF IDEALISM AND REALISM. 313 identity into the general abstraction of the commonwealth? These abstract Roman ideas made it possible that at a later period the most refined spiritualisation of our social organisa- tion could develop into the most terrible and sanguinary despot- ism. As it is, and always must be, the case with superstitious, and at the same time practical, matter-of-fact people, arts and sciences had little charm for the Romans. Politics and warfare absorbed their whole mental and bodily activity. Cicero himself, towards the end of the republic, protested publicly in the senate against the accusation that he loved arts or had any sympathy for "allotria," as he called matters of higher taste. Professor Mommsen says of the old Romans, with great truth, that they were without the passion of the heart, the longing to idealise what was humane, and to incar- nate, or rather humanise, what was lifeless, and thus they were in want of the most sacred elements of poetry. This was also the case with their philosophy. In poetry, art, and philosophy they were close imitators of the Greeks. Greek Epikureanism and Stoicism were the principal philosophical schools of the Romans, and Professor Lange points with great justice to the fact that both parties plunged their daggers with equal fury into the bosom of Caesar, because the Stoic Brutus and the Epikurean Cassius were both swayed rather by politics than philosophy. The only philosopher, in a very wide sense of the word, whom the Romans produced, was Titus Lucre- tius Carus (b. 99 B.C., d. 55 B.C.). Seneca was no philosopher, but merely a moralist. The philosophy of Lucretius revived in Gassendi and Descartes in entirely different forms. It is in itself characteristic that the only Roman philosopher should have clothed his ideas in a poetical form, and presented us with a discussion "On the Nature of Things" (DeRerumNatura) in verse. The formation of the cosmos out of eternal matter, the impossibility of a final end of the universe, atoms and their infinite divisibility, empty space, and gravitation towards a centre, are treated in hexameters, often in terse, dogmatic sentences, a characteristical feature of all poetical composition, in which the writer is generally more a prophet than a 48*</page><page sequence="11">314 TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL HISTORICAL SOCIETY. philosopher, who tries in prose to reach truth on the thorny and prosy path of reasoning. The mechanical creation as such was most peremptorily advocated by Lucretius. Man, in his composition and development, in all his worldly rela- tions, is but the product of material outer circumstances, over which the individual has very little, or, in fact, scarcely any control. Lucretius asserts that "atoms have not combined after mature deliberation, nor have they decided what motion to take; but they have been brought into their phenomenal forms by mere chance; having once assumed certain forms in time and space, they continue the regular production of phenomena; the streams nourish the seas; the earth heated by the rays of the sun brings forth new creations; the living generations germ, bud, and flourish; and the gliding sparks of ether remain alive." * Teleology with Lucretius was a mere abstraction; he reduced all design in nature to its own aim (" Zweck ist sich selbst Zweck "). This question forces itself upon us: " If the universe be a mere product of chance, if its whole design be but a design of atomic force, whence do our moral and ideal conceptions come ?" Are we to assume, with Dr Carl Vogt, "that our thoughts stand in the same relation to our brain as the bile to the liver?" Demokritos, Lucre- tius, and our modern realists or materialists, merely explain with more or less ingenuity the material combination of phenomena, and entirely omit the first dawn of self-conscious- ness from their calculations. With self-consciousness, how- ever, our higher moral and intellectual life begins. It would be exceedingly difficult to prove that this self-consciousness is not the effect of a particular combination of atoms, gases, elements, and chemical substances; but this effect is as varie- gated in its independent mode of working as are the rays of the sun in their influence on this globe. That the inorganic and organic products of the earth are the effects of the life- giving influences of heat and light may be granted; but the rose, through an absorption of cosmical, solar, and telluric elements, is still a rose and not a thistle, and the mere tracing * See Professor Lange, p. 107, who gives the passage in full.</page><page sequence="12">HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF IDEALISM AND REALISM. 315 of causes, without a study of the effects as such, must natur- ally lead to misunderstanding and misrepresentation. Lucre- tius tries to explain sensations and consciousness by asserting that atoms do not feel separately, but only as combined totals. He, however, overlooks the altogether new world which these combinations of atoms create through their being cap- able of impressions; these impressions produce sensations of which we become conscious, and these impressions, sensations, and effects of consciousness, are again subject, not to a material law of causation, but to a mental or ideal law of reasoning. Lucretius dimly felt the contradiction in his system; for a combination of feelingless, unconscious atoms could never produce totals of feeling and conscious beings. He then is forced to assume a soul (anima), which he distinguishes from spirit, or rather intellect (animus), and he assumes the two as connected elements in man. Just as our hands, feet, and eyes are organs of the living being, so also are intellect and soul. Heat and breath are the soul, and the most refined essence, having its seat in our bosom, is the spirit or intellect. How Platonic these realists grow whenever they approach the ideal in us! Soul and spirit are bodies, and consist of the most minute, roundest, and most movable atoms. We cannot understand and grasp this. In answer to the question: By what means do the insensible and unconscious atoms suddenly become sensible ? we can expect no other assertion but the one that is most dogmatically thrown out by our modern automa- tists-motion. But motion is not sensation, and least of all consciousness. Lucretius gives us no answers to the following questions: What feels ? How do we feel? What is that which we feel ? Where do we feel ? In what way do impressions pro- duce sensations, and what becomes conscious of these sensations? The whole teaching of Lucretius may be summed up in the one sentence-" There is no immortality of the soul." Death ought to be utterly indifferent to us. Whatever we may hold of the philosophy of Lucretius, it was the natural product of his times, and ultimately produced a wholesome reaction against the sickening and whining sentimentalism that altogether</page><page sequence="13">316 TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL HISTORICAL SOCIETY. neglected reality, and saw and regarded nothing but the phantoms of a wild, unbridled imagination. Lucretius, who closely followed Hesiod, Demokritos, and Epikurus in his poetical work, made many a trenchant remark which had no meaning at the time, because the emancipation of women, and their rights to the same education and callings as men, were not yet made articles of faith, or systematised theories for philosophical essays. The origin of language and the development of trades and arts are touched upon, as well as the political formation of society and states. He sternly opposes ambition, and praises "obedience" above all as the principal virtue of a citizen. Submission to authority is always one of the favourite topics of theologians and political leaders. This was the more natural at the time of Lucretius, when the republic was shaken to its very foundations, when the wars of the republic had exhausted the state force, and political dis- sension turned the weapons of Romans against Romans. The mighty sanguinary activity of the Romans was followed by internal exhaustion, rottenness, and despair, producing a counteraction in an indescribable longing for peace, quietness, and a dreamy forgetfulness of reality. The questions that trouble the mind of humanity-the "wherefrom," "whatfor," and "whereto," or the "whence" and the "whither"-con- stantly forced themselves on the attention of Roman society. The old gods lost their concrete forms, and as abstractions they were powerless, or mere poetical fancies. The dry and contradictory theories of the philosophers interested only the higher educated classes, whilst the masses still believed lightning and thunder, hailstorms and inundations, clouds and winds, to be the direct actions of the gods. Lucretius tried to explain all these phenomena from natural causes, but he led to an idealism that suddenly absorbed the entire intel- lectual faculties of ancient humanity, and buried classicism in the night of superstition, forcing humanity to find new paths, new methods to climb again the heights of clear and unbiased reasoning. Semi-culture, even amongst the most instructed Romans, was the bane of their philosophical and historical</page><page sequence="14">HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF IDEALISM AND REALISM. 317 progress. Even the rich and powerful devoted themselves to an exclusive genealogical knowledge of their gentes, a biased and narrow-minded acquirement of the fascia. They practised elocution in order that they might shine with rhetorical elegance, made themselves acquainted with the principles of agriculture in order to amass riches. They despised all higher training, as leading to crime and sin, and turned the sublime ideas of Epikurus, who had discarded every form of superstition, and sought delight and happiness in virtue for its own sake, into a doctrine of wild debauchery, devoting themselves to utter unbelief, sarcastic scepticism, and rude negation. It is a fact " that ignorance is never the consequence of knowledge, fantastic arbitrariness is never the result of methodical study, and free thougkt never leads to superstition." Only where knowledge is the sequence of imaginary assumptions, based on meaningless formulae, where a methodical study of generalisations is neglected, where free thought is oppressed or concealed behind hypocrisy, where life is assumed as a business that ought to pay, and where it is thought that were there no reward or punish- ment, life would not be worth living, only there and then philosophy must lead to superstition, and superstition to in- credible crimes and misdeeds, perpetrated under the cover of religiousness. Tartarus, with all its torments, was an inven- tion to overawe the restless masses of the Greeks and Romans, and the philosophers, in doing away with the idea of a future life, became dangerous " demons," as they might be called in certain circles, who assumed that the world was made and ruled on mechanical principles, that the universe was a mere scheme of illusion, and that "humanity had been persuaded to toil and to suffer upon a lie." Semi-cultured people with such ideas readily turned to the mystic teachings of the priests of Isis, or any other mystic deity; they believed in thauma- turgi and prophets, incantations, conjurations, visions, and dreams; and whilst they believed and worshipped occult powers, they gave themselves up practically to the grossest materialism. In such a sense nothing is more despicable</page><page sequence="15">318 TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL HISTORICAL SOCIETY. than a so-called believing people, with its credulous supersti- tion on one side and its practical realism on the other. When the practical spirit is bent upon the search after truth, an improvement of the social and consequently also of the moral condition of the masses in general, and of every individual in particular, must follow. When an energetic national spirit drives the great thinkers of a nation to discoveries and inventions, to an equal culture of the ideal and real, then we shall see the same results as at Athens, during the time of Perikles, and as we have seen in England for the last three centuries. The ideal will then become the force that will master matter, and matter will be used to promote the very highest ideal good of humanity-peace, love, and happiness, which Demokritos, Epikurus, and Zeno attempted, but for which the times were not yet ripe. The seeds that were sown by the mighty thinkers of the Periklean period matured dur- ing the two centuries preceding the birth of Christ, but as yet brought forth only fragrant blossoms; the fruits were still to come. Mysteries and incomprehensibilities intoxicated the masses, and led them to despise all real knowledge. Mystic worships promised comfort to the "sin-tormented " people. Matter became an abomination. The new-Platonists and new-Pythagoreans mingled Oriental, more especially Egyptian and Indian, speculations and dogmas with the idealistic dreams of Plato, and assumed the position of prophets and priests, instead of that of philosophers. It is often asserted that unbelief produces superstition; we are, however, warned by the greatest writers on the history of philosophy not to allow ourselves to be misled by this dazzling antithesis. Any stern and scientific system, based on solid principles, detaching faith from knowledge, must exclude with still greater force any form of superstition. We generally find that idealism based on unproved or impossible assumptions, produces phenomena* of the most contradictory nature. The secret and charming mysteries of Isis, the riotous processions in honour of Bacchus, accompanied by symbolic performances, turned the people into gloomy ascetics. The morbid cravings to fly</page><page sequence="16">HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF IDEALISM AND REALISM. 319 reality, to seek death, or in abject self-abnegation to retire from this world, were the sequences of a misunderstood real- ism; but history teaches us the fact, that the most sublime idealism of Christianity led in the first instances to the same results. Christianity, as the most abstract doctrine of an empire "that is not of this world," opened a new vista to sunken humanity. Christianity was to be the religion of truth and spiritual exaltation, but above all of general brotherhood, coun- teracting the wretched egotism into which mock-philosophers, false prophets, and necromancers had plunged humanity. Miracles, though not the chief means of propagating Chris- tianity, were of great use in furthering the progress of the new faith at an age when people craved after miracles and believed only in the supernatural. The magi, and priests of Isis, and Apollonius of Tyana, endeavoured to compete with the Chris- tians, as also did the philosophers who attracted the masses with delusions and prophecies. The old world had to yield to the pure and divine ethic principles of Christianity, because it taught a higher spiritual universalism, embracing poor and rich, learned and unlearned, in one mighty circle of mutual love. The grandeur of this intellectual revolution which led to the destruction of the ancient world and its all-important historical bearing, is often overlooked by narrow-minded bigots, who cannot see that in spite of deceit, treachery, and the incredible horrors of all kinds that disgraced the propagation of the Christian faith in utter contradiction to the principles of its founder, Christianity had a mighty germ of vitality in it. This germ was the monotheistic idea which led humanity first on the path of authoritative belief, and at a later period on that of scientific inquiry, to a higher, slow, but gradually progressive development. This movement was assisted by Judaism, in the shape of a set idealism with extremely concrete notions in reference to the personality of the Deity, and Moham- medanism with very practical notions of existence in this world to the honour of an "Allah," who promised infinite</page><page sequence="17">320 TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL HISTORICAL SOCIETY. earthly blessings in a heavenly abode. Under this three-fold monotheism the heathen gods and incarnations of the powers of nature passed away, and left to the thinkers of all future ages the possibility of differing or agreeing on special points, and trying to find out the laws of nature under the sway of their relative conceptions of a Deity, who, in spite of the difference of their creeds, remained one. The Jews believed in a creation out of nothing, but this nothing could be turned into innumerable somethings. The nothing did not exactly mean nothing at all, but only nothing so far as forms or dis- tinct phenomena were concerned. Heaven and earth were produced at once, and so were light, day, and night. In these assertions there was nothing that checked philosophical in- quiry, for though the "nothing theory" enabled theologians to stop progress for a time, this only remained possible so long as the old Greek philosophical principles were unknown. The "Monotheos" of the Jews was not altogether freed from the most concrete conceptions; he was not allowed to assume a visible form in stone, bronze, marble, or colours, but notwith- standing this restriction,the God of the Pharisees was not yet the invisible, all-pervading Spirit of the Universe, as with the Chris- tians, but an irate, revengeful, sometimes kind Autocrat, who had His dwelling-place in Jerusalem, and His only favoured children the Jews. This, however, was a disputed point, and Philo Judaeus already had loftier ideas, approaching, to a cer- tain extent, the conception of Christ's Deity. The statement, " I am thy God," he explains, is made " by a certain figurative misuse of language rather than with strict propriety; for the living God, inasmuch as He is living, does not exist in rela- tion to anything; for He himself is full of Himself, and He is sufficient for Himself, and He existed before the creation of the world, and equally after the creation of the universe; for He is immovable and unchangeable, having no need of any other thing or being whatever, so that all things belong to Him, but, properly speaking, He does not belong to any- thing." Christianity was founded on a still broader basis; it superseded all anthropomorphism, which, however, introduced</page><page sequence="18">HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF IDEALISM AND REALISM. 321 itself in time, step by step, during the historical development of the Romish Church, as a dogma in different but always disputed forms. For Christianity in its first origin, as pure ethics, took root in the lower, and worked itself gradually into the higher instructed classes, as the best means to educate the heart and to bring about a perfect balance between our moral and intellectual natures. During the crystallisation of the second phase, especially when Christianity became a state religion with a mighty hierarchy, and the spiritual kingdom of God in heaven was represented as a powerful priesthood on earth; when Greek casuists, Roman dialecticians, Hebrew exegists, Egyptian mystics, and Indian fanatics, each contri- buted their special component elements towards the forma- tion of dogmatic Christianity, the purity of Christ's principles of universal brotherhood and love was lost, and any higher intellectual life or philosophical inquiry was silenced for cen- turies. The Jewish God of egotism was set up and surrounded by innumerable angels as His courtiers; the ancient gods and goddesses were revived in different shapes and forms as male and female saints. Religion again became symbolic in its ceremonies. The exclusive God of Israel was looked upon as the only God of the Catholics, and matter was cursed and accused of being the work of evil. The dualistic tendency of the Zend-Avesta was revived. The visible world and matter were assumed as the principles of sin, engendering weeping in man's home, anguish in his heart, inducing him to wickedness and leading him to perdition. Nothing could be more revolt- ing to men swayed by such assumptions than a philosophy which occupied itself with a study of the properties of matter, trying to reduce even the phenomena of the intellectual and moral world to the rational laws of causation. In opposition to, or rather between, Judaism and Chris- tianiity stood the third monotheistic religion, Mohammedan- ism. Allah was to be Allah and only Allah, but He did not forbid believers to study His creation for His glorification. It followed, therefore, that before the Arabs and Persians had made themselves acquainted with Greek philosophy, they x</page><page sequence="19">322 TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL HISTORICAL SOCIETY. already spiritualised Allah to so broad an abstraction, that they could build up different realistic schools under the Abasides, in the endeavour to bring about a union between reason and faith. Averroes revived the principles of the peri- patetic school of Athens in the twelfth century, and gave a new impulse to the study of Aristotle in a direction differing from that of the scholastics of the Christian Church. He propounded the eternity of the universe and of matter; taught that God's relation to the world was so near that God without a world or the world without a God was impossible, thus lead- ing to pantheism; and finally treated of the essence of reason, which was assumed by him to be the divine universal force that manifested itself in single individuals. This theory com- bated the Christian and Mohammedan dogma of the individual immortality of the soul. In Averroes we have the connecting link between the ancient Greek philosophers and the schol- astics of the Middle Ages. In addition to the revival of philosophy we are indebted to the Arabs for the sciences of mathematics, astronomy, geography, botany, chemistry, and the art of medicine. The Arabs were the propagators of a firm faith in the order of the universe. In opposition to the Greeks they founded this order, not so much on the properties of concrete matter, as on the eternal, immutable wisdom of the one and indivisible Deity and His spiritual nature. To trace in plants, animals, and men analogous phenomena; to find a connection between the apparently different products of the Creator, and to see in all of them a common source, was the fundamental principle of Arabian philosophy, and this could not remain without influence. The three monotheistic religions approached each other on the field of speculation and experience; they began to interchange ideas, to find analogies where they formerly found only hostile divergencies; and arts and sciences, after a long and dark night, became again possible. The theological idealism of Christianity, tempered by the realistic tendencies of the Mohammedans and the purified reflection of Hebrew monotheism, intermixed with Greek philosophy, served as a new starting-point. Man</page><page sequence="20">HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF IDEALISM AND REALISM. 323 was thus enabled to understand the oneness not only of ideal- ism and realism, of science and art, of man and man, but of the whole universe, which he saw as one grand acting and reacting whole, in the sense of that masterly cosmical poem, the Io4th Psalm, in which light or reason is called the gar- ment of the Deity, who is ministered to by spirits and flaming fire-the spirits of thinking men and the flaming fire of the search for truth. God "stretched out the heavens like a curtain; He laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be removed for ever; He sendeth the springs of the waters from the mountains into the valleys; He assigns to the fowls of heaven their habitation; He plants trees full of sap; He appointed the moon for seasons, and the sun to make day and night; He sends man forth to do his work; for the earth is full of His riches." The greatest riches, how- ever, are those which we gather on the field of study, in trying to trace in the historical past the ever-changing and ever- flowing springs of information, forming those immense streams of thoughts, theories, systems, discoveries, and inventions, which have all led gradually, despite their manifold modifica- tions, to that immense spiritual ocean of knowledge, which will form the subject of my next paper on the historical development of idealism during the Middle Ages, under the special influence of Aristotle, beginning with Plotinus and ending with the immortal Bacon, the founder of modern philosophy.</page></plain_text>
