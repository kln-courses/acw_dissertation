<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE PARADOX OF MAN AND NATURE: REFLECTIONS ON MAN'S ECOLOGICAL PREDICAMENT* Hwa Toi Jung Infinity is ended, and mankind is in a box; The era of expanding man is running out of rocks; A self-sustaining Spaceship Earth is shortly in the offing And man must be its crew—or else the box will be his coffin! —Kenneth E. Boulding1 I THESE WORDS WERE A BRIEF BENEDICTION Spoken by the economist at a conference on the ecological aspects of inter national development in which some aired the view that technology-induced ecological havoc is perhaps more serious in the developing areas than the developed ones. Boulding's warning about the predicament of humankind, with which we are quite familiar by now, can no longer remain unheeded. If humankind is to survive, the warning must be translated into immediate action. This was the urgent task of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment in Stockholm in 1972. Perhaps we are trying—to borrow the phrase of Ludwig Wittgenstein—"to repair a torn spider's web with our fingers."2 * An earlier version of this paper was written for a conference on "Problems of the Human Environment and the Third World" which was held concurrently with the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment held in Stockholm, Sweden, June 5-17, 1972. Part of this paper was also presented at a Miljoforum (Environment Forum) during the Stockholm conference. 1 "A Ballad of Ecological Awareness," in The Careless Technology: Ecology and Inter national Development, ed.

Having studied five major categories of accelerating industrialization, rapid population growth, widespread malnutrition, depletion of non-renewable resources and a deteriorating environment, the report comes to a rather dismal projection that, if the pre sent pace of growth, depletion, and consumption is un checked, the world or humankind will be faced with a sudden, catastrophic collapse within a century. In order to avert the impending disaster and to reverse the collision course with a catastrophe, it recommends "a Copernican revolution of the mind" at national and global as well as individual levels. This revolution of the mind, I take it, is nothing short of a basic change in our values and life-styles in relation to nature, land, and the earth, for our values and attitudes, that is, our Weltanschauungen, are the root causes of ecological problems. If this reasoning is correct, then science and technology alone cannot save us from an ecological catastrophe although they may serve us as temporary palliatives. If the universalization the direction of creating a better human and natural environment and symbolized the globalization of ecological awareness, I cannot help but share the sentiments of the American poet Gary Snyder in the prologue of his poem "Mother Earth": "No one came to the U. N. Conference on the Environment to give anything—they all came to take. Not to save the planet, but to argue about how to divide it up and stretch it out—how to prolong the agony. People thought and spoke in terms of political divisions and human needs. No one spoke for the actual biological and ethnic zones of the planet, and the interrelated needs of all beings. Except the Hopi Indian delegation from the Southwest. But it was a start." The New York Times, July •3. '972&gt; P- 35 3 (New York: Universe Books, 1972). Cf.

Norton, 1972); and Friends of the Earth, The Stockholm Conference: Only One Earth (London: Earth Island Limited, 1972). The economic philosopher Robert L. Heilbroner stresses the fact that the fundamental problem for ecological survival is a social as well as a technical one and concludes that an "additional element" for human survival is "the cultivation and gradual dissemination of a changed attitude to the environment—indeed, to life itself: an attitude based on a wholly new awareness of the fragility of our planet as a life-supporting vehicle."

Many, perhaps too many, blindly accept economic acquisi tion as something good in the name of modernization in the Third World. Its unequivocal, myopic meaning comes from the mere statistics of GNP, the number of dams, power plants, heavy industries, automobiles, and television sets. When western scholars, and many non-western scholars too, for that matter, speak of development, economic and political, and modernization, they mean vaguely but invariably that the developing nations are becoming more and more like one of the western nations, especially like the United States. The acceptance of the analytical framework and assumptions of Walt Rostow on economic growth and politics, for example, is indicative of the tendency of this thinking.4 To reach a high mass-consumption economy accompanied by the maximum application of science and technology is the universal desire and the ultimate goal of every nation. So, contrary to Oswald Spengler's prognostication for the decline of western civiliza tion, the twentieth century has unmistakably shown the cultural domination of the West over the non-western world. For so-called modernization is westernization. Following the western invocation of Faust to justify man's conquest of nature (and space) by science and technology, Soetan Sjahrir, the eminent leader of the Independence Movement and the first Prime Minister of Indonesia (who was by no means alone on the matter of nation-building among Asian political leaders and intellectuals), heralded the "dynamic" spell of Faust as 4 See The Stages of Economic Growth (Cambridge: At the University Press, i960) and Politics and the Stages of Growth (Cambridge: At the University Press, 1971).

For Sjahrir, as for many other political leaders, the Faustian soul sym bolized the spiritual vitality of the West worthy of emulation in conquest of nature for the benefit of humanity.5 The technological and industrial revolution kindled in the sixteenth and seventeenth century West has produced a chain reaction and is yet an unfinished revolution toward the uni versal goal of mass-consumption economy; and the scientific and technological world-view, whose shortened name is technomorphic culture, now caught the imagination of the entire world. Technological and industrial rationality permeates every soul in every nation and every continent, which, if un checked, must lead us to the brink of disaster and a collective suicide. Accordingly, the evangelism of economic growth in the context of ecology is not an unmixed blessing. As technomorphic culture prevails in the modern world, so ecology is the problem of modern man everywhere. The ecological crisis is rooted in modern man's moral, spiritual, and cultural crisis. To cope with it, we must start with the most fundamental problem: the problem of our way of thinking or, as the ancient Chinese philosophers had it, "a rec tification of names." We must rekindle for the sake of ecology the spiritual legacies of the ancient world. Recently the Ira nian philosopher Seyyed Hossein Nasr has shown the value of the Oriental way of thinking in coping with the spiritual poverty of modern man in relation to nature.6 The spiritual legacy necessary to harmonize man with nature that the 5 Out of Exile, ed.

In Martin Heidegger's "A Dialogue on Language," there is an interesting encounter between a Japanese and a European in quirer concerning the European domination of man and the earth and the Europeanization of Asian thought. Instead of seeking their indigenous thought, Japanese are chasing "ever more greedily after the latest news in European philosophy" and therefore "a true encounter with European existence is still not tak ing place, in spite of all assimilations and intermixtures." The Japanese in this dialogue admits that "In the face of modern technicalization and industrialization of every continent, there would seem to be no escape any longer."

II Technomorphic culture is the Zeitgeist of modern man everywhere, and the ecological crisis reflects this spirit of time. Modern science, especially mechanics, has directly or indirectly contributed to the formation of this culture. Science is no longer the travelogue for a minority of intellectuals but has indeed become a popular thaumaturgy or magic for modern man, both the intellectual and the layman alike. The ecological crisis itself is the disharmony or imbalance of relationships between man and nature. Man is alienated from nature and uprooted from the earth, his household (oikos), that is, his natural habitat. Technology, the supreme artifact of man himself, finally served as the instrument to cut off man's umbilical cord from nature and the earth. Man no longer is passively in the temporal continuum of evolution but has become an active, chief agent of the evolution of all living creatures on earth. As an active modifier, man affects the evolutionary processes of nature. Broadly speaking, technology affects not only man-nature relationships but man-man relationships: the problem of technology becomes the problem of technocracy. As the philosopher of counter culture Herbert Marcuse (whose militant political activism has no liking for the alleged quietism of Zen Buddhism) so forcefully points out, modern man is thoroughly one dimensional: technological; and technocracy is the result of transferring the domination of man over nature to the domination of man over man. Thus domination perpetuates and extends itself through and as technology which legitimizes the expansion of political power in absorbing all spheres of culture.7 In a genuine sense, technocracy or technomorphic culture 7 One-Dimensional Man: Studies in the Ideology of Advanced Industrial Society (Boston: Beacon Press, 1964), p. 250, For a treatment of "the domination of nature" as a social category, see William Leiss, The Domination of Nature (New York: George Braziller, '972)</page><page sequence="6">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW represents the spiritual impoverishment of modern man. It respects no living creatures and organisms and no things on earth as sacred in themselves. Whereas the sacred mode of ex istence belongs to primitive man—the ancient Near Eastern, the Hindu, the Taoist, the Zen Buddhist, or the American In dian—the profane mode of existence is the exclusive property of modern man.8 Only in the modern world-view is nature completely mechanized and thus desacralized and—as in the modern philosopher of history, Hegel—pitted against freedom, the source of history. His elderly contemporary Fichte un reservedly asserted that "I will be the lord of Nature, and she shall be my servant. I will influence her according to the measure of my capacity, but she shall have no influence on me."9 Unlike his predecessor, primitive man, modern man is incapable of having a sacramental coexistence with nature as something sacred or of having an "I-Thou" relationship. The universal, ancient belief that "human beings were born from the Earth"10 is discredited and disavowed by the modern man of technomorphic culture. Modern man has forgotten that the sacred is not the exclusive attribute of man alone. To put this matter differently as does Loren Eiseley: when man, nature, and the world become "natural," that is, demystified, they become totally expendable and are readily subject to exploita tion, despoilation, and finally destruction. By devouring everything "natural" in his way, modern man becomes literally the "world eater."11 8 Here I am using Mircea Eliade's phenomenological insights on comparative religion.

It would be interesting to examine the correlation between the degradation of femininity and the ecological crisis (that is, the degradation of nature).

For his survival man had to invent artifacts to meet the necessities of his daily life. Technology in a very rudimen tary sense is not a modern invention. It is basically the result of man's impositions of changes on nature. In this sense, then, his technology and his welfare go hand in hand. However, the technology, that is, modern mechanicomorphic technology that despoils and destroys nature and dehumanizes man himself is the invention of the modern age. And the exploitation of nature by man and of man by man is truly a modern phenomenon. Intellectually René Descartes's philosophical dualism and Francis Bacon's philosophy of scientific culture supplied the fuel to the dichotomization of man and nature which coincides with the rise of technomorphic culture, the root of the ecological crisis. For Descartes, there is a duality of two sub stances (res): mind and body on the one hand and mind and nature or thing extended on the other. Not only is nature a mindless or soulless network of the gigantic Machine which, through the cultivation of knowledge, man is entitled to master and possess. But man himself is visualized as the grandest machine of all. This is a grand mechanicomorphic design of man, nature, and the cosmos. In this way, Descartes paved the way for the cybernetic theory of man—the image of man taken after the mechanism of artificial intelligence. When man and his mind are elevated to the level of "higher" substances at the expense of "lower" substances of nature and body, there is a serious consequence: the latter are treated as epiphenomena. By dichotomizing mind and body on the one hand and man and nature on the other, the dualistic Cartesian mechanicomorphism denigrates nature and body as lower re alities and, moreover, denies man himself as a natural being, that is, a bodily and sentient being. When nature is demythologized and man denaturalized, then the way is open for the exploitation of nature and man by man. Unlike the philosophical intricacies of Descartes, Bacon's thought is direct and straightforward in advancing an thropocentric utilitarianism. For Bacon science is a prac 7</page><page sequence="8">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW tical and efficacious enterprise by the cultivation of which man is to exploit, utilize, and conquer nature for the improve ment of his lot. In the anthropocentric utilitarianism of Ba con, knowledge becomes the cult of power: knowledge is the power to transform nature for human uses—the perfect justification for the coming of "energy civilization." Unlike the religions of primitive man in Asia, the Near East, Africa, and the Americas, Christianity, the religion of Oc cidental man, has not served well for the cause of ecology. Instead, it has contributed to man's domination and conquest of nature. According to the medieval historian Lynn White, Jr., Christianity is the most anthropocentric religion that the world has ever known.12 The attitude of the ancient Israelites toward the earth and nature in biblical times was certainly anthropocentric. According to Johannes Pedersen,13 the an cient Israelites regarded man as the "owner" of the earth and the "ruler" of nature (animals, domestic and wild, plants and trees), although they believed that earth and stones, for exam ple, are "alive, imbued with a soul" and observed sabbath to the land which restrained them occasionally from en croachments on living creatures and things on earth. The place of nature (animals in particular) was determined by their serviceability to man, "the goal of all created things." Domestic animals like the cattle were designated as "the property of man." By a "covenant," man made the cattle his "slaves." Man the "absolute ruler" dictated his relation to nature. The rights of the "wild beasts" in the fields to "wilderness" were acknowledged, but once they entered into a "covenant" with man at his own dictate, then they were to serve him as domestic animals.Therefore, the beasts were wild due to "the impotence of man," that is, they were deemed wild because they had not yet come under the influence of man or had not yet become domesticated. Even the celestial bodies (the sun, the moon, and the stars) have "a covenant with the 12 "The Historical Roots of Our Ecologic Crisis," Science, CLV (March 10, 1967), pp. 1203-7. For an alternative approach, see Conrad Bonifazi, A Theology of Things (Philadelphia: J. B. Lippincott, 1967). 13 Israel: Its Life and Culture, 2 vols.

Although they were "living beings" which had their own "nature" and followed their own laws, they belonged to "the totality of the world of man." The sun, the source of light, for example, was valued for its utility to the land of man, for fertility. Coupled with the Cartesian dualism of soul and things extended and Bacon's anthropocentric utilitarianism, Christianity has long provided a forceful justification for scien tific, technological, and industrial civilization in the West for man, God's vicar on the apex of creation, to subdue, exploit, and conquer "soulless" nature. Before other creatures, man's alleged monopoly on spirituality enshrines him in the temple of arrogance. Moreover, Judaeo-Christian linear, non-cyclical millenarianism (unlike the religion of primitive man based on "the myth of the eternal return") ensured western man, historical man, of the birth of a faith in infinite progress for myriads of years to come. To assure and elevate his sacrosanctity, modern man denies the sanctity of other living creatures and non-living things on earth. There is evidence, moreover, that Christianity, especially Calvinism, has rein forced the acquisitive ethos of Occidental man. It has been a source of inspiration for the development of science and technology as well as of capitalism, the beginning of modern quantitative economy. The Puritan ethic of strenuous work (or "work ethic") for the well-being of humankind is to glorify God by predestined man, which is not far removed from the Baconian ideal. For it is only by work that man is capable of transforming nature and of dominating it for his uses and profits. Marxism was meant to be an antithesis of Christianity and the bourgeois culture of technocentrism. However, Marx both secularized the vision of the Judaeo-Christian millenarianism and messianism and inherited the vision of Hegel's historicism. He attributed to the "chosen" proletariat a soteriological role and the eschatological hope of the last revolutionary battle between Good and Evil: by ending once and for all the evil of the old historical order (capitalist bourgeois culture), he hoped to initiate a new historical order 9</page><page sequence="10">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW (communism). Thus Marxism is often mentioned as an alter native thought to capitalism. However, Marxism is also an in tegral chapter in the continuous flow of western intellectual history.14 It is true that Marx, the young Marx, spoke of his "future society" as "the union of man with Nature, the veritable resurrection of Nature, the realized naturalism of man and the realized humanism of Nature."15 For him, the resurrection of human nature meant the resurrection of man as a natural being, an embodied and sentient being who is capable of aesthetic experience—a rejection of the Cartesian dualism. This ideal society would eventually emancipate man from the sense of domination and possession and replace work with the free play of leisure. Nonetheless, Marx's an thropocentric "humanism" has in the end failed fully to over come technocentrism. In his comprehensive study of Marx's concept of nature, Albert Schmidt comes to the conclusion that Marx, the mature Marx, "no longer wrote of a 'resurrec tion' of the whole of nature. The new society is to benefit man alone, and there is no doubt that this is to be at the expense of external nature. Nature is to be mastered with gigantic technological aids, and the smallest possible expenditure of time and labour. It is to serve all men as the material sub stratum for all conceivable consumption goods."16 Marx was not concerned with the naturalness of nature but with the productive and technological order, the interaction of man and his social environment in relation to nature, that is, in sofar as nature affects man's relation to man as a social be ing. He was then preoccupied with the question of nature's instrumentality or the "human significance of nature." Technology is the human mode of dealing with nature, and 14 In its revisionist emphasis on the role of the peasantry and ruralism rather than the industrial proletariat and urbanism, Maoism has so far saved China from becom ing a frenzied battleground for a technomorphic culture. 15 Karl Marx: Selected Writings in Sociology and Social Philosophy, trans.

The transformation of nature by human labor is, Marx emphasized, "the confirmation of man as a conscious species-being." Thus Marx's primary concern was the idea of man as homo faber, the worker who shapes nature and is being shaped by it. To abolish private property as the source of human misery and alienation for Marx was to liberate one group of men (workers) from the domination of another (capitalists) and finally to end the exploitation of man by man (not primarily the exploitation of nature by man). As the notion of the transformation of nature by man as a species-being or "the manipulation of inorganic nature" suggests, the thought of Marx represents predominantly the liberation of man from human domination and bondage, not the reconciliation of man with nature. For him the "dematerialization of labor" was then to end the labor of a worker as a commodity or thing. He focused on the problem of human alienation and man's inhumanity to his fellow men which had emerged from a particular arrangement or dis arrangement of productive and technological forces. All in all, Marxism is an attempt to humanize man and to make man a natural, embodied, and sentient being; however, his ideal of humanizing nature, unlike the ideal of Zen or Taoism, as will be shown, is an ominous sign of anthropocentrism. For all practical purposes, official Marxism as a political ideology has become and still is (and will seem to remain) in essence an ideology of industrialization. Its chief aim is over whelmingly economic, involving of course the ruthless ex see Martinjay, The Dialectical Imagination (Boston: Little, Brown, 1973), pp. 253-80. In analyzing the phenomenological foundation of Marxism and the Marxist foundation of phenomenology, however, Enzo Paci states that for Marx "Nature must not be only a means for life: true life is always free material and spiritual nature rooted in the in organic. Work is not work-in-order-to-satisfy-another-need: it is the human need to live in nature and to give a meaning to itself and nature.

Following the footsteps of Marx's technocentric humanism, socialist nations in the West have become firmly entrenched in the technological and industrial ethos. Like capitalist nations, socialist nations too are the source of dismay among ecologists. Ill The preceding pages hve been an attempt to show that anthropocentrism in Descartes, Bacon, Christianity, and Marxism all promoted directly or indirectly a technomorphic culture which polarizes man and nature. What is then an alternative ecological way of thinking which would harmonize man and nature? What is an alternative ideology that would tip the balance in favor of an ecologically viable ethic? Though allusions to the harmony of man and nature are abundant in Oriental religions and philosophies (Indian and Chinese), especially Zen (Chan) Buddhism must be singled out as an alternative to the technomorphic ethos of modern man.17 It is characteristic of Chinese cosmology or, as Herrlee Creel calls it, "Sinism" whether it be Confucian or Taoist to emphasize the triadic unity of man, heaven, and earth.18 As 171 am most indebted to the writings of Daisetz Teitaro Suzuki for the Zen concep tion of man and nature.

Earth models itself after Heaven. Heaven models itself after Tao. And Tao models itself after Nature."19 "Heaven and earth," Chuang Tzu reiterates, "were born at the same time I was, and the ten thousand things are one with me."20 In an attempt to restore the authentic harmony of man and nature, so far the thinking of Zen (and also Taoism) and its hidden meanings and implications for an ecological ethic have not received the attention they deserve in the Third World and the West. Except for thinkers like Alan Watts, Christmas Humphreys, and Thomas Merton, Zen is not taken too seriously in the intellectual circles of the West. For the or dinary Occidental mind, Zen still is completely foreign and associated at best with the "esoteric culture" of "nature freaks" and a few far-out practitioners of counterculture. The true relevance of Zen for an ecological ethic lies exactly in that it is not merely an abstract system of thought or speculative conundrum but is a practical guide for everyday living for the proverbial man in the street, well-informed citizens, intellec tuals and scientists alike. As Paul Wienpahl puts it, Zen is not a body of doctrine but is teaching (or a teaching of wisdom) and the enlightened life it teaches is everyday life itself.21 Tao or Journal of Ethics, XXXII (April, ig22), pp. 237-63 and H. and H.

It exists beyond the highest point, and yet you cannot call it lofty; it exists beneath the limit of the six directions, and yet you cannot call it deep.

Intellectual ar ticulation or verbalism alone, impbrtant as it may be, does not measure man's spirituality, nor does it alone assure us spiritual profundity.22 Like the Kierkegaardian Christian faith, Zen must be lived. In the beginning of Zen is not the Word but is the Deed. Zen is singled out here because it is singularly important to the foundation of a new philosophy of life in harmony with nature. Zen is the most precious spiritual gift of Asia for modern man who is embattled by ecological degradation and is looking for survival. It is truly an Asian gift because it is a unique hybrid of the spiritual heritages of the two great civilizations—Indian and Chinese.23 The Zen message for an ecological ethic is found in a few words of Daisetz Teitaro Suzuki: "the problem of Nature is the problem of human life. "24 Zen is an ethology of nature. A Zen attitude is revealed in a poignant little episode which the American composer John Cage narrates: while he attended Suzuki's lectures on Zen at Columbia University, he failed fully to grasp what Suzuki was trying to say. A week later, however, while he was walking in the woods to gather mushrooms, it all dawned on him.25 This episode of Cage has two significant implications: first, to un derstand Zen one must also understand nature and, secondly, Zen emphasizes the lived or experiential side of human life. How, according to Zen, is the harmony between man and nature to be achieved? To harmonize man and nature, Zen 22 It is interesting to note that the spiritual legacy of the American Indian to which a reverence for life and nature is central is profound though not formulated in a systematic, scholastic and doctrinal presentation.

To end this dualism, we must cultivate aesthetic and reverential sensitivity toward nature and regard man as a natural being. In so doing, we would restore our ecological conscience and responsibility. By the aesthetic I mean that part of human experience which deals with the appreciation of "natural beauty" rather than a philosophy of art objects or art criticism.26 To be reverential means to treat nature for its intrinsicality rather than for its extrinsic utility or "cash value." Accordingly, what is aesthetic coincides with what is reverential. In essence, the actual and potential contributions of Zen to the ecological crisis of today are the replacement of a technomorphic ethos and an ethic of affluence by an aesthetic and reverential ethos and an ethic of simplicity and frugality. Whereas a technomorphic ethos is possessive, manipulative, and exploitative (that is, anthropocentric), an aesthetic ethos is not. If technology, modern technology, is a result of man's imposition of his will on nature or is the reformation of nature by man, we must minimize it and eliminate its careless use. The minimization of technology and elimination of careless technology are necessary in order for man to survive with other living species on earth. The Gresham law of economics seems to be working also in technology: bad technology tends to drive out good technology. If "nature knows best" is a basic ecolog ical law, then the intervention of the nuances of natural proces ses by man, that is, by his technology, is ipso facto unecological. The exploitative attitude toward nature inherent in the technomorphic ethos of modern man stems from the anthropocentric, utilitarian dualism of man and nature. This dualism, as has been pointed out previously, polarizes man from nature by separating the "superior" being of the former from the "inferior" being of the latter. For when nature becomes mindless or soulless, that is, merely inert matter as 26 See Ronald W. Hepburn, "Aesthetic Appreciation of Nature," in Aesthetics in the Modern World, ed. Harold Osborne (New York: Weybright and Talley, 1968), pp. 49 66. 15</page><page sequence="16">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW in Cartesian intellectualism, then the way is open for its ex ploitation by man exclusively for his purposes. Therefore, the technomorphic ethos denies to nature an intrinsic value.27 Instead of speaking of "the human use of the earth" in cultural geography and "the human use of human beings" in cybernetics, Zen "lets things be" as they actually are, as the etymological root of the Chinese ideograms tzu-jan (self thusness) suggests, by accepting the naturalness of nature and "the way of things" in it and by relegating to it "spon taneity." The way of Zen is not to manipulate and ap propriate nature solely for utilitarian and economic purposes but is simply to disclose its inherent worth. In other words, as Albert Hofstadter expresses it, "to let things be" means to let them be their own actuality, not to change what they actually are (that is, non-interference).28 By letting things be in their actuality, in their inherent worth, man relegates to nature finality. To relegate to nature finality is to regard man and nature as "co-tenants"29 of the household called the earth, as ecology is the management of the earth as a household. As a co-tenant man does not own or possess the earth, he is merely a tem porary wayfarer on borrowed time. By the same token, nature ceases to be a piece of property to be possessed and then ex ploited by man. For man to be spatial is to be an earthly creature. The popular expression of man's "conquest of space" symbolizes his "homelessness" as an earthly creature. To overcome his alienation from nature and the earth, his in dwelling place, man must restore the idea of kinship with nature and the earth. Only in kinship are man and nature 27 In contrast to the cognitive and the moral mode, according to C. I. Lewis, the aesthetic mode of value apprehends the given in its native qualities whether it be the beauty of nature, a piece of music, or a painting. In empathetic infusion with a thing, aesthetic delight or enjoyment is at its height "unself-conscious," that is to say, it in volves an absorption unqualified by cognitive or pragmatic intents. The aesthetic mode is a direct inspection (inspection). It involves a "contemplative release" or "pause" as distinguished from an instrumental or utilitarian mold.

In kinship then there is no place for egocentricity between man and man and anthropocentrism between man and nature. The American conservationist Aldo Leopold's "land ethic" that assures the lasting place of land (or nature) in man's ethical configurations is close to the way of Zen. For it affirms the intrinsic value of land, a state of har mony between man and land, land as a biotic community, and the biotic right for every living creature on earth. In short, Leopold accepts nature's intrinsic value—its finality.30 The aesthetic appreciation of nature is to be compared with the poetic vision or contemplation that is inscribed in the poetry of the English romanticists, especially William Blake and William Wordsworth. They saw "the ten thousand things" (of nature) for their own sake rather than their poten tial use. As the first stanza of Blake's Auguries of Innocence reads: To see the world in a grain of sand, And a heaven in a wild flower; Hold infinity in the palm of your hand, And eternity in an hour. For Blake's or Wordsworth's poetic vision as for Zen, nature "is not an 'object' but a presence and a power; a motion and a spirit; not something tó be worshiped and consumed, but always a guide leading beyond itself."31 This is the meaning of nature's mystery or finality rather than, as is Hegel's view concerning the aim of art, stripping "the outer world of its stubborn foreignness."32 To the mute language of nature's wonders and secrets is man's sensibility open. It is the intrin sic wonder rather than the extrinsic use of nature that generates man's aesthetic and moral vision whether nature be a lean blade of grass, a butterfly with dancing wings, the 30 A Sand County Almanac (New York: Ballantine, 1970), especially pp. 237-64. 31 Geoffrey H.

Since the seventeenth century this affinity has evoked the admiration of many Euro pean minds and often created the image of the Orient as the "paradise on earth." As the aesthetic is the harmony between man and nature, so is the good the harmonious relationship between man and man: not only is the ethical grounded in the aesthetic, but also harmony is the unifying theme of the aesthetic and the ethical. Harmony, therefore, is the essence not only of the aesthetic but also, unlike the persistent tradi tion of western social and political thinking, of the social. It is the essence of relationships between man and nature on the one hand and between man and man on the other. Heidegger speaks of "meditative thinking" (besinnliches Denken) and "releasement towards things" (Gelassenheit zu den 33 Suzuki, Zen and Japanese Culture, pp. 232-33. 34 Hepburn says that "The Wordsworthian nature was man's aesthetic and moral educator: whereas the characteristic image of twentieth-century man, as we all know, is that of a 'stranger' encompassed by a nature which is indifferent, unmeaning and 'absurd' " ("Aesthetic Appreciation of Nature," p. 49). 35 Tagore, Towards Universal Man (New York: Asia Publishing House, 1961), p. 72.

Man is confluent with earth, sky, and gods—the free spontaneous interfusion of the four.37 Earth, sky, gods, and mortals are together "betrothed" and "belong" to one another.38 For Heidegger, meditative think ing as found particularly in poetry (Dichtung) will make us en dure in the world which is already threatened by the near monopoly of "calculative thinking" (rechnendes Denken) as typified in mathematics and science. When calculative thinking dominates the terrain of human thought, the very essence of man is threatened. Moreover, calculative thinking annihilates the autochthonous status of things in nature and reduces them to mere instruments: in it the earth is a "planet" and the wine a "liquid." Meditative thinking is characterized by "releasement 36 For Heidegger's writings in the present context, see Discourse on Thinking, trans. John M. Anderson and E.

In the spring the rock dwells, and in the rock dwells the dark slumber of the earth, which receives the rain and dew of the sky. In the water of the spring dwells the marriage of sky and earth. It stays in the wine given by the fruit of the vine, the fruit in which the earth's nourishment and the sky's sun are betrothed to one another.

Releasement is non-willed, non-forced, and non-concerned activity, that is, an active responsiveness in man to the "natural light" of a thing. It is then "a will-less let ting in of everything," the spontaneity that sets a thing "free to be nothing but itself."39 "A higher acting," Heidegger writes, "is concealed in releasement than is found in all the actions within the world and in the machinations of all mankind."40 Here Heidegger's notion of releasement parallels the Taoist idea of wu wei and the Zen way of thinking and do ing, that is, the way of refraining from thinking and doing contrary to the natural and spontaneous way of things.41 It is this Taoist teaching of wu wei that Martin Buber in 1928 ex alted as the living spirituality of China that counterbalances the Faustian power of the West.42 Just as Heidegger's release ment is "a higher acting," so wu wei is more active than action itself. Releasement or wu wei is then a non-anthropocentric (as well as a non-intellectualistic) way of apprehending things in nature and the world. It is like the flow of a river that meanders unconcernedly along the contours of the landscape or the splitting of a bamboo with its grain. The Zen way of perfecting archery, for example, lies in unconcernedness or "pur poseless detachment." It is the "artless," effortless, and self forgetting immersion of the archer in his performance without any ulterior, utilitarian ends in view (for example, to strengthen the archer's physique).43 The mechanical and the aesthetic are two contrasting poles.44 Not only is direct experience to be had in the har monious interplay between man "the live creature" and his environment but also harmony is the consummation of an order akin to the aesthetic. Harmony and disharmony (or 39 Heidegger, Poetry, Language, Thought, p. 64. 90 Ibid., p. 61. 41 In his critique of Heidegger's ontology, Stanley Rosen suggests in passing that Heidegger's conception of Being is the Chinese conception of Tao rather than the Greek conception of physis.

In order to survive, it is necessary for an organism to have a harmonious interaction with its en vironment, which is to say, to have "an aesthetic ecology."46 There are then two contrasting ways of relating man to nature. There are two contrasting "forms of life" (Wittgens tein) or modes of "Being-in-the-world" (Heidegger): one is the technomorphic way which appropriates and exploits nature exclusively for human purposes; and the other way, in contrast to the technomorphic way, is the aesthetic way which ap preciates and cares for nature as it is, for its intrinsicality. While the former polarizes man and nature, the latter har monizes the two. Whereas the way of appropriation is intellectualistic and objectifying, the way of appreciating is sensible, affective, experiential, and intuitive. While in intel lectual thinking man becomes a passive spectator leaving a dis tance between him and nature, in feeling or sensiblity man becomes an active participant allowing him to be in contact with, nature. Sensibility adds aesthetic delights to "the cold, dry, colorless world of science."46 As man is inseparable from raw nature, wilderness, according to Leopold, the "aesthetic harvest" of things natural is as inalienable as free speech.47 His poetic narratives of life in nature in seasons, moreover, delight his reader as does Zen-inspired poetry. Zen stirs an aesthetic mood in man in communion with nature. In feeling rather than in thought alone it inspires aesthetic delights and inner contentment in the beauties and mysteries of nature. The technomorphic way of life—industrialized, urbanized and commercialized life—snatches modern man away from "the bosom of nature" and deprives him of his aesthetic delights. In contrast, like Henry Thoreau's "life in the woods," Suzuki describes a vivid picture of living in a hut built somewhere in the mountain woods of Japan, a hut thatched with straw, a part of nature itself. Here man in his 45 The phrase "aesthetic ecology" is used by John J. McDermott in "Deprivation and Celebration: Suggestions for an Aesthetic ecology," in New Essays in Phenomenology, ed. James M.

Man, the hut, and nature are blended into a harmonious whole and compose a "poetics of space."48 This is the Zen way and the Oriental way of appreciating nature. Chinese painting, es pecially landscape painting, as it often embodies the spiritual legacy of Taoism and Zen, is man's spontaneous response to the plenitude and nuances of nature.49 Since time im memorial, Chinese poetry, too, vividly captures man's aesthetic feeling of harmony with the rhythm and pulsation of nature. The She King, the ancient Book of Poetry, for example, portrays an indivisible and interminable bond between natural events and human affairs, affirming that, as Rachel Carson puts it so well, "there is something infinitely healing in the repeated refrains of nature."50 Harmony is man's attunement to nature (and other men). This attunement of man to nature is enjoyment, which is so well described in the phenomenological thought of Emmanuel Levinas.51 Enjoyment is found in man's active, immediate im mersion with the formless, contentless, and non-possessible "element" like wind, earth, sea, sky, and air. It is a "bathing in the element." Therefore, what is "elemental' is not an "ob ject." As enjoyment requires the complete immersion of a participant in the presence of a thing as it is, its mode belongs to the order of sensibility, not the order of thought which always represents a thing as an object (that is, the mode of ob jectifying). For example, we may enjoy the earth as an "element" but think of it (or represent it) as a "planet" or a gigantic "energy station" as in science and technology. We may enjoy the earth as an "element" in its immediate presence, whereas we may possess or exploit it as an object. Feeling or sensibility belongs to the world of enjoyment 48 Jen and Japanese Culture, pp. 331-44. 49 See Michael Sullivan, The Birth of Landscape Painting in China (Berkeley, Calif.: University of California Press, 1962), especially pp. 1-24 and Mai-mai Sze, The Tao of Painting: A Study of the Ritual Disposition of Chinese Painting (New York: Pantheon Books, 1963), especially pp. 3-32. 50 The Sense of Wonder (New York: Harper and Row, 1965), p. 89. 51 Totality and Infinity, tr.

Moreover, the spirit of abstraction, which is inherent in objectifying thought, breeds the spirit of distance and alienation. There is then the difference between "Being" and "Having." "To be" is to accept things as they actually are, to "let things be" which blends into the world of enjoyment, whereas "to have," in contrast, robs things of their "wilderness," of their finality and thus makes them open to ex ploitation. Only by way of participation does man enjoy nature and harmonize himself with it, whereas its opposites, possession and exploitation, alienate man from nature. To bring harmony in the interplay between man and nature, we must also envision man as a natural, sentient being, as an embodied being whose body is the subject of sensibility and inhabits the natural and social world. By envisioning man as an embodied being, we end the Cartesian dualism of mind and body, of man and nature, and assert the primacy of sensibility as embodied consciousness. As a Zen saying goes, "better to see the face than to hear the name." To see is Zen do, the way of Zen. The tao of Zen is to see nature in its nakedness: as a Zen master remarked, "When I began to study Zen, mountains were mountains; when I thought I un derstood Zen, mountains were not mountains; but when I came to full knowledge of Zen, mountains were again moun tains."62 The idea of man as embodied consciousness brings him close to the natural world. To say that I am my body is to say that my body is not an object among other objects in the physical world but is a medium of organization, the carnal field by which I participate in and inhabit both the natural and the social world.63 Sensibility intertwines my flesh with 52 "The Role of Nature in Zen Buddhism," p. 240.

The flesh of nature is my flesh. In reading the subject of man's ecological conscience, one often encounters some reserved and unfavorable reactions to the relevance of Zen to the West.54 In the first place, the most common reaction is that Zen is a foreign ideology. As such "it won't work for us, for it's Oriental." However, because ecology is now a global problem, the relevance of Zen, though an Asian or Oriental phenomenon in its historical origin, transcends and must transcend the narrow confines of geography and culture. In the second place, the idea of "man in nature" in Zen is sometimes criticized because it allegedly sacrifices the uni queness of man—his individuality. To answer this criticism, it must be simply pointed out that Zen does not attempt to achieve the harmony between man and nature at the expense of the individuality of man. The idea of "man in nature" or "man as a Being-in-the-world" does not imply man's un differentiated submersion in nature or in the world. For man exists (ex-ists). He stands out from, not stands over or against, the other earthly creatures and things. Since man exists in the world, moreover, his mode of existence, spatially and tem porally, is not the same as the mode of a thing as simply being here or there. The human mode of existence is ecstatic. As Suzuki emphasizes, Zen and the existential thought of Kierkegaard coincide :truth is subjectivity. Only where vision (outer seeing) and insight (inner seeing) coincide, is there the true meaning of "a biotic community" between man and nature and of "a human community" between man and man. The Zen idea of harmony between man and nature is the coming together of the two as distinctive elements in their own right in the cosmic processes. The Zen idea of "man in nature" implies the principle of plenitude in nature, that is, each in its own way contributing to the making of the whole 54 See, for example, McHarg, Design with Nature, pp. 27 ff.; White, "The Historical Roots of Our Ecologic Crisis," p. 1206; and Frederick Elder, Crisis in Eden (Nashville, Tenn.: Abingdon Press, 1970), pp. 139-40.

Harmony, therefore, is not the affirmation of the One but a unity-in-differentiation of the Many, a unity of the Multiple. In this way, Zen rejects both anthropocentrism and anthropomorphism in man-nature relationships. From an ecological perspective, moreover, the one-sided emphasis of man's individuality to the point of narcissism in western social and political thought will not produce a happy result. The possessive individualism of man-man relationships affects man-nature relationships (and vice versa). As Martin Buber says, the twofold attitude of man toward the world creates the twofold relations: "I-Thou" and "I-It." The "I" of man in "I-Thou" (man and man or man and nature) is radically different from the "I" of man in "I-It." Man's image of himself is reflected in each of the two basic relations differently: by objectifying the other (that is, nature) man in fact objectifies himself. In man-nature relationships, anthropocentrism open the way for man to absorb or aggran dize nature into his own possession and exploitation to infinity. However, man alone does not own the earth; he is only one of the living species that belongs to it. So we must speak of co ownership or mutual ownership: not only do I, you and, not the least, the unborn but also other living species belong to the earth. As Hofstadter says, "mutual ownness" and the act of "belonging" imply each other.66 The authentic in dividuality of man is gained, not lost, precisely because he participates in a nexus of relationship with his fellow men and women. As I and you together belong to the same social world, man and other creatures belong to the same household called the earth. Man and nature co-inhabit the earth. Separately, they are doomed to perish. IV The paradox of man and nature is the paradox of economic development and ecology. This paradox is shown so clearly in the ecological crisis humankind is facing today.

It started out with the domination of man over na ture for his noble purposes, but it—and its careless use in particular—created the effect of a boomerang. The technomorphic culture of modern man created not only "eco logical backlashes" but also nightmarish tensions between man and man. Technology and industrialization neces sarily accompany economic development as we under stand it today. For the sake of ecology, for the sake of ecologically viable development, we must glance anew at the oracles of so-called progress inscribed in the economic temple of every nation in the world. The ideology of modernization is an economic determinism. A blind, intemperate zeal to accelerate the tempo of economic growth at whatever cost is incompatible with the ecological injunction. Because it is the reformation of nature by man one way or another, technology by its very nature intervenes and interferes with the normal processes of nature. To save humankind and other living creatures and things on earth, there seem to be no other con vincing alternatives than those which dampen our evangelical zest for material acquisition, our interminable desire for more and more things (that is, pleonexia). It has been maintained in this paper that the ecological crisis is rooted deeply in the way in which we organize our vi sion and thought of the world, that is, our world-view. So most urgently we must grapple with the politics of the mind. The most basic change for the sake of ecology must lie in a change of our world-view, the technomorphic cult of modern man. As ecology has become a global concern, as humankind is becoming "a family," and as the world is becoming "a global village," we all must compare each other's notes in har monizing man with nature and strive to create what might be called an ecological ecumenism both in theory and in practice as envisioned in the perennial theme of "Great Unity" in Chinese thought from Confucius to K'ang Yu-wei.56 In 56 This is the way to read the modern relevance of Confucius and Confucian philosophy. Herbert Fingarette writes that "When I began to read Confucius, I found him to be a prosaic and parochial moralizer; his collected sayings, the Analects, 2 6</page><page sequence="27">MAN AND NATURE awakening planetary conscience and responsibility for ecology, we need in the family of humankind a mutual shar ing in thought and action in creating ecologically viable development, in eradicating hunger and poverty, and in bridging the gap between rich and poor nations and between developed and developing nations. For, as both ecology and the principle of synchronicity in the I Ching (the ancient Chinese Book of Changes) have it, in the cosmos everything is related to everything else.57 This ecological ecumenism is then the planetarization of the ecological conscience of modern man, which requires the forgetfulness and forgiveness of our past sins. It comes only from gathering of all noble forces, sen timents, opinions, and thoughts. The purpose of ecological ecumenism is to create a united, world-wide front. In the spirit of ecological ecumenism, we must together make the world safe and secure not only for us in this generation but also our posterity in generations and generations to come.

Environmental degradation largely results from the introduc tion of new industrial and agricultural production technologies. These technologies are ecologically faulty because they are designed to solve singular, separate problems and fail to take into account the inevitable 'side-effects' that arise because, in nature, no part is isolated from the whole ecological fabric. In turn, the fragmented design of technology reflects its scientific foundation, for science is divided into disciplines that are largely governed by the notion that complex systems can be understood only if they are first broken into their separate component parts.
