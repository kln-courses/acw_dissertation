<plain_text><page sequence="1">God's God's Willing Knowledge. The Influence of Scotus' Analysis of Omniscience.Omniscience. By Douglas C. Langston. Pp. 145. Penn sylvania State University Press, 1986. $18.95. This is a short and unpretentiously written book. But it covers a great deal of ground in a lucid and philosophically impressive manner. Its subject is the ancient problem of omniscience and contingency (more specifically, omniscience and human freedom), which the author approaches by expounding the teaching of John Duns Scotus (chaps. 1-3) and by tracing its influence in the work of later writers, principally Molina, Leibniz, Alvin Plantinga, and Nelson Pike (chaps. 4-6). Langston suggests that Scotus's theory of omniscience is important both philosophically and historically. He also finds it consistent, unlike the theories of Molina, Leibniz, and Plantinga. In his view, however, it is, in the end, open to question (though not necessarily to be ruled out) for three main reasons. First, it is incompatible with a libertarian notion of freedom.</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 233 Secondly, it is in some ways incomplete. Thirdly, like all accounts of omniscience which go with a rejection of libertarianism, it is open to moral objections (i.e. ones which challenge God's integrity as a moral agent). There are a number of things in the book with which one might take issue. Does it, for instance, make sense to say that anything could call into doubt the moral standing of God? Or is talk of God's moral status merely a form of (unacceptable) anthropomorphism? And is it really certain that a libertarian (even on Langston's definition of 'libertarianism') cannot intelligibly think of omni science and freedom along the lines of Scotus, as Langston depicts him? Here, it seems to me, Langston's discussion moves too quickly and could have been improved by further reflection on (a) the relationship between causation, determinism, and necessitation, (b) the notion of 'possible person', (c) the concepts of 'ability' and 'opportunity', and (d) the meaning and implications of divine causality in the light of the doctrine of creation ex nihilo. It also seems to me that Langston could have usefully dug deeper into certain questions of a historical nature. The cause for concern here lies in an impression conveyed about the originality of Scotus in the light of his predecessors, especially Thomas Aquinas. Although he judiciously qualifies the verdict in some places (e.g. on p. 21 and p. 131 n.), Langston strongly suggests (and sometimes directly implies) that Scotus has something new to say since (a) he clearly sees that God's knowledge of our free actions must depend on his creative will as well as on his intellect, and (b) since he thinks that our actions can be free even though they are caused by God. But this suggestion is misleading to say the least. And, if we simply concentrate on Aquinas, it is misleading in view of two things. The first is the Thomist doctrine of divine simplicity, according to which will and intellect are not distinct in God (cf. Summa Theologiae,Theologiae, la, 3. 37; Summa Contra Gentiles, i. 20-5; De Potentia, vii). The second is Aquinas's often repeated insistence (a charac teristic of Thomism, but also an ancient doctrine) that God operates in every operation, including the free actions of his creatures, which derive the whole of their being from God, just like everything else (cf. Summa Contra Gentiles, iii. 67 and 89; Summa Theologiae, Ia2ae, 79. 2; De Potentia, iii. 7). I do not dispute Langston's reading of Scotus as such. But I should be deeply reluctant to credit Scotus with the sort of originality which Langston's emphases seem to ascribe to him. On the other hand, however, Langston has much of value to offer, and he presents it with clarity and rigour. And there are many places in his book where he seems to establish some very solid conclusions.</page><page sequence="3">234 REVIEWS In this connection it is particularly worth drawing attention to the detailed analysis of Scotus on freedom (chaps. 2 and 3), in which a good job is done to tease out of Scotus a position more complex than is usually attributed to him. Also worth highlighting is the cogent critique of scientia media offered in chapter 4. Langston makes profitable use in this of some arguments of Robert Adams ('Middle Knowledge and the Problem of Evil', American Philosophical Quarterly,Quarterly, xiv (April, 1977)). He then goes on to show that Molina is committed to the very view of freedom which he is out to oppose. There is, perhaps, a more pertinent criticism to be made of scientia media,media, for its defenders assume that God can know what someone would do as created, without knowing the person as created and, therefore, as doing what he or she does. As Anthony Kenny has put it: 'If it is possible for God to know which world he is actualizing, then his middle knowledge must be logically prior to his decision to actualize; whereas if middle knowledge is to have an object, the actualization must already have taken place' (The God of the Philosophers Philosophers (Oxford, 1979), 71). But it still remains that Langston has put his finger on a real difficulty for Molina. And, as he goes on to note, it is one which affects some conclusions of Plantinga, on whose 'free-will defence' {The Nature of Necessity (Oxford, 1974)) Langston also has other interesting things to say (chap. 6, esp. pp. 106-10). In general, therefore, this is a book to be recommended. There is plenty in it to satisfy and engage the professionals. But it could also prove particularly helpful to those approaching the problem of omniscience and freedom for the first time. Considered as an introduction to the problem, and considering its historical perspec tive, I know of nothing to equal it. Brian Davies OP Brian Davies OP</page></plain_text>
