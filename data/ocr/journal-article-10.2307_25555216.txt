Mark Roper, Even So: New and Selected Poems (Dedalus Press, 2008), 14. Here are three seminars on how to be mellow without being cosy. The poets were all born in the early 1950s. Fred Johnston's lament for Beatle George Harrison is also a lament for lost youth, richly suggestive of images and sounds that aren't actually in the poem's text - bell-bottomed trousers and Liverpudlian accents filling out his inscribed arena of 'girls shy-legging it', lank hair and all manner of late 1960s/70s accoutrements which we just assumed would always be with us. 'The flash-Harry wee lads now fat and fifty / Swinging on your every word.' Coyle-Greene's very title Snow Negatives - surely a poem in itself - sets the tone for much in these collections. You don't necessarily have to be of the poets' (and my) generation to go with this. Let's say you're under c. 40 and still possess an unreconstructed (great-)grandparent or you otherwise love hanging out in junk shops: then you, too, will feel a shock of recognition at Coyle-Greene's references, in 'Radio Geography', to the old stations of Athlone and Hilversum that were displayed on the wireless as one (i.e. we oldies) twiddled knobs to position the dial right where one wanted it. Nostalgia? Yes, and why not. Today's current thirty-somethings, or the more alert among them, will recognise their own equivalents of what is past, and passing, and to come. I found Mark Roper's book full of eerie echoes, intentionally or otherwise: take this, the opening of his 'Goldcrest': Fair enough its thin pheet-pheet in a conifer; fair enough a glimpse of yellow crest. But this one flew straight into this glass door and dropped on this metal balcony at my feet... I couldn't get out of my mind the Venerable Bede's celebrated image of the bird which flies into the hall then out of it: image, that is, of transience. I infer that Roper, like Bede, has a background as a Geordie, so maybe that shared geocultural space has something to do with it. In Roper's poem, though, the bird's flight is interrupted, violently, before it unexpectedly recovers and flies off again. Twenty-first century equivalent? Roper is no-nonsense, anti-anthropomorphic about it. The bird 'Got on / with its business. So I got on with mine.'

Roper offers the tribute of poetry to that most eloquently mute of arts, painting, in 'Manet's "The Fifer"' and 'Van Gogh's "The Farm"'. I wouldn't downplay these poets' responses to nature, but my own view is that there is greater resonance in responses to culture. Poet as subtlest form of art critic? That was the possibnity held out (and vindicated) by the likes of Baudelaire and Rilke. It seemed fitting that, more than half-way through Roper's volume, I encountered 'Palm: after Rilke. RUkean tropes - even on one occasion an echo ('You must learn how to love') rather than an actual translation of a certain Une ('Du muBt dein Leben andern') - animate this book. 'Palm' is in fact a superb summing-up, in English, of the preoccupations of that great pan-European poet. 'Inner sheU shaped / to a fruit formed in prayer': Rilke, friend and interpreter of Rodin, understood the calmly powerful gestures of the human hand. 'Broken home of wholeness': there we have that terrifying antithesis, omnipresent in The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge, pertaining to a Europe just a few years away from war. Roper's Co Kilkenny expands beyond his time and its space. Not dis similarly, Coyle-Greene deploys a late photograph of F Scott Fitzgerald: so that later, in the studio, there was nothing left of him, no trace of his stare to be sieved through hard glass by the aspic glare of the camera's hooded, sudden eye. - 'EARLIER THAT DAY' With such a range of cultural reference, the melanchoUc vibes of these books can't be dismissed as posy self-indulgence. Yet - and this is where Fred Johnston draws us up - certain silences are far from benign. Good anger requires a voice to be clearly heard, though even here it's the subdued tone that works, more effectively sure ly than any decibeUed rant (however justified that might be). Johnston rages measuredly and devastatingly against an Ireland whose windows were not so much squinting as boarded-up, where child abusers in high places were aUowed to flourish while would-be whistle-blowers were at best ignored and at worst threatened. Moreover, it's not aU past tense nor for that matter is it Umited to home-grown malevolences: Now that the poetry's over There's Gaza and Iraq, And the crooked politicians Doing deals behind our back. 84 I POETRY IRELAND REVIEW 96</page><page sequence="3">The Yanks still dump their soldiers In our airports and hotels: No poet worth a travel-grant Dare sound the warning bells. - 'LINES WRITTEN AFTER A POETRY FESTIVAL' That's a street poetry looking for a street.
