<plain_text><page sequence="1">FORMS OF THE GODDESS LAJJAGAURÍ IN INDIAN ART by Carol R. Bolon; Motilal Banarsidass, Delhi; 1997; Pp. 89 with 130 figs.; Price : Rs. 350/-. Nude, headless female figures, generally known as Lajjägauri, have attracted the attention of art historians in recent years. Stella Kramrisch identified them as the representations of Aditi uttãnapõda whereas the late Professor H. D. Sankalia branded them as €t shameless women " and com- pared them with the * Baubo ' figurines in Roman Egypt. R. C. Dhere gave them the sobriquet * Lajjägauri ' He marshalled a vast mass of evidence - literary, epigraphic and ethnographic - and underlined their association with fertility. In the book under review, the author has dealt with most of the available figurines, has discussed their typology and has also illustrated them profusely. She has meticulously classified them and has examined their chronological position., Since most of the figurines are from surface</page><page sequence="2">214 Annata BORI , LXXX ( 1999) collections, dating them precisely is a hard task which is rendered more difficult because they cannot be studied stylistically as they are headless. The author has grouped the figurines into the following four classes : i) Uttãnapad pot, ii) Lotus-headed without arms, iii) Lotus-headed with arms, and iv ) Anthropomorphic. The distribution of the figurines shows that they occur almost all over the country, but their heavy concentration is in the Deccan- Maha- rashtra, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. A vast majoiity of them belong to Ca. 400-1000 A. D. Those beloning to the early centuries of the Chri- stian era are rather small plaques, whereas large stone sculptures came to be fashioned from the 6th cent. Aa D. In some cases bull is associated with the goddess suggesting a combination of fertility with virility. Siva-linga too is present in very rare cases. Only one image is inscribed, that from Nagar- junikonda which records the name of an IksvSku queen and her husband, the king as well and can therefore be dated to the first half of the fourth century A. D. Larger stone images were made in the Chalukyan period ( 6th-8th cent. A. D. ). Many of them are presently worshipped by barren women for procuring an affepring. The exact function of these nude figurines is hard to explain. This reviewer is inclined to identify them as representations of Šákambhari, a form which goddess Durgã assumed to ward off a hundred year drought as described in the Devi-Bhãgavata section of the Mãrkandeya Purãna. She is described as headless and as having a lotus in the place of head. The anti- quity of the headless goes to the second and even third millennium B. C. The author has referred to this reviewer's other papers but not that on áâkam- bharî which is publshed in ABOR1 , vol. 68 ( 1987). It is noteworthy that headless godess ( Palghat ) is still worshipped by the Warlis of Thana district near Mumbai : she is also associated with fertility. M. K. Dhavalikar</page></plain_text>
