<plain_text><page sequence="1">Towards an Expanded View of Nature in Women's Psychology Stephanie Lahar One area in which feminists with diverse orientations have agreed upon is that women as a group have had and continue to have a different subjective experience than do men as a group. To what degree women's subjectivity is different and particular has been an issue of marked, and sometimes divisive, disagreement among feminists. Within this debate are varying theories about the sources of women's differences and the means by which a female subjectivity is learned and passed on, as well as discovered independently. As female stereotypes have been rejected, points of orientation that serve to explain women's unique experience have ranged from an analysis of social history and oppression, to theories that center on biological differences and the capacity to bear children (often either trivializing or elevating this capacity), to a type of essen- tialism in which women are specific carriers of a transcendental female principle. I believe, along with Ynestra King and Anne Fausto Sterling, that a more complex analysis is called for "in which an individual's capacities emerge from a web of interactions between the biological being and the social environment."' Simply saying, however, that female subjectivity is the product of both nature and culture is not enough and even perpetuates a dualism between these two concepts that has historically been at least as de- structive as gender stereotypes. I believe that in most feminist analyses up to this point a coherent natural framework has been lacking in which to ground social and psychological models. The question of whether or not there is some universal and particularly female "nature" has not been adequately resolved. A related question, of interest particularly to ecofeminists, is how either female subjectivity or "nature" exists in relationship to nature in its larger sense, which includes both humanity and the nonhuman environment.

I also argue for the extension of some of the woman-centered perspectives and psychological theories developed during the 1970s and 1980s into wider networks of relation- ship. It is possible to look at some key issues that have emerged out of feminism in the last twenty to thirty years and make some generalizations about views on female nature that have emerged historically. In the 1960s and 1970s there was a strong movement to free women once and for all of notions of biological determinism, which was implicit in traditional justifications of women's oppression and exclusion from eco- nomic and political opportunities. This project reached its most radical, and perhaps reactionary, vision in Shulamith Firestone's The Dialectic of Sex, in which Firestone advocated that women disidentify with all ster- eotypically "feminine" qualities and eliminate social meaning from bi- ological facts of genital differences and reproductive capacities through reproductive engineering. In Ynestra King's words, this androgynous ideal for women's self-identity implied that for a woman to become fully human, to become a person, she must cease to be a woman. . . . Many feminists have found nothing much worth retaining in traditional female socialization and they have argued forcefully and effectively that it is against the long term interests of women as a class for us to use female stereotypes in political action, or to organize separately as mothers or peace activists.2 The idea of female identity as purely a social construction, "an artifact of patriarchy" in Firestone's words, was, in a sense, a direct opposite to the idea of biological determinism. I believe that this idea heralded a profoundly liberating stage in women's social history and has also served as a philosophical foundation for a number of feminist psycho- logical theories. Just as the theory of a biological determination of women's nature, however, did not account for the reality and power of social norms and institutions in structuring women's experience, social constructionism left women with no validation for particularly female experiences - no core images with which to identify. In the late 1970s and 1980s, a movement of woman-centered per- spectives emerged, with the central tenet of celebrating rather than obliterating women's unique qualities. The goals of woman-centered perspectives have ranged from the creation and sustenance of com- munities and forums where women may share their experiences to a 2Ynestra King, In the Interest of Peace: Feminism, Women, and Politics (unpublished paper, 1986), 2.</page><page sequence="3">Nature in Women's Psychology 185 largely separatist philosophy and lifestyle. Woman-centered philosophies have served as a rich ground for new models of female identity, often through artistic expression (i.e., Judy Chicago's "Birth Project" and "Dinner Party," and Adrienne Rich's poetry); yet a celebration of dif- ference and a rationale for separatism have not always been distinguished. Two ways in which a feminist ideal of egalitarianism falls short are in the romanticization or reification of women's inherent qualities or ex- perience and in the reversal, rather than deconstruction, of traditional hierarchies. In Mary Daly's work, for example, this reversal is especially evident in that she portrays women as an essentially separate species, graced by transcendent psychological and spiritual qualities that serve as a base for superior moral values and actions. The idea of a Goddess or spiritualized "female principle," central in a number of cultural feminist philosophies, is a similar form of an essentialism which could be interpreted as a mystical version of biological determination. Cultural feminists have often been criticized for these views by socialist feminists, who see them as abdicating political and economic programs in favor of an inward journey. Socialist feminists further argue that such an abdication obscures the differences between women which sometimes results in a kind of colonialism whereby some women speak for the needs of all women. In contemporary feminist theory, it is clear that definitions of what makes a woman a woman are still unsettled and contradictory. Linda Alcoff writes: The concept and category of woman is the necessary point of departure for any feminist theory and feminist politics, predicated as these are on the transformation of women's lived experience in contemporary culture and the reevaluation of social theory and practice from women's point of view. But as a concept it is radically problematic precisely for feminists because it is crowded with the overdeterminations of male supremacy, invoking in every formulation the limit, contrasting Other, or mediated self-reflection of a culture built on the control of females.' By consciously choosing to do so, we can refuse both traditional and contemporary female stereotypes, escaping the constraints created by essentialist beliefs. The limits of our own acculturation are harder to see. I concur with Alcoffs challenging thought that "our very self- definition is grounded in a concept that we must deconstruct and de- essentialize in all of its aspects."4 Women's psychology, which takes female identity and experience as its point of departure, is a prime 'Linda Alcoff, "Cultural Feminism Versus Post-Structuralism: The Identity Crisis in Feminist Theory," Signs 13 (Spring 1988), 405. 4Alcoff, "Cultural Feminism," 406.</page><page sequence="4">186 Stephanie Lahar ground for the creative work of making models and images of who we are and will be. What does feminist psychology have to say about women's inherent and/or learned qualities, and relationships within human society and the natural environment? Feminist psychologists, with a few exceptions, have not taken on large philosophical questions about women's "nature" and relationships to the natural world. Instead, women's psychology has largely followed traditional psychological concerns about the experience of the individual in relation to family and the world of human society, even as it has incorporated a feminist social analysis and critique. Feminist psychologists agree that traditional psychology has primarily studied and described a composite subject who is male and that women's experience has been inadequately represented. The task of feminist psychology has been the study of the female subject, her development and experience. Specific inquiries have included the psychological effects of historical oppression, theories of moral and intellectual development, and theories on the nature and effects of the mother-infant bond. In this discussion, I will touch on just two of these topics: the nature and effects of the mother-infant bond and women's developmental stage theories. In its biological reality and its social institutionalization, motherhood has been one of the most disputed topics in feminist discourse. From Shulamith Firestone's emphatically antimaternal stance to Phyllis Ches- ler's transcendentalization of mothers and mothering, the various di- mensions of motherhood - social, historical, biological, and psycholog- ical - have been difficult to disentangle, and the relationship of mothering to women's oppression has remained ambiguous.5 Heather Jon Maroney notes that some feminist theorists have seen in sexual asymmetries with respect to birth and childcare a material key for understanding not only masculine and feminine char- acter differences but also constituent features of dominant Western cultural developments, including the coded relation between "man" and 51n Mothers ont Trial (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1986), 410, Chesler elevates maternity to an almost divine quality. She writes, "the bond between a mother and her child is naturally sacred. It is physical, psychological, and spiritual." Later, she quotes Denise Nadeau: "[The mother-child bond is] indelible and ineffable. In it lies a passion and a drive for truth and life that is unique and cannot be replaced by any father-child bond. A feminism that denies the primacy of mothering denies the core of our power" (439). Although I am very sympathetic to Chesler's portrayal of the very real injustices which women encounter in parenting and custody battles, I believe that her philosophical assumptions are ultimately disempowering to women in making social changes that would remedy these violations.

Both saw the critical factor in understanding the perpetuation of gender roles and social dis-ease as women's primary role in early child care. Chodorow's attention focused on how the infant received messages from mother that he or she was either the same or different, depending on gender, and how this fostered focusing on relationships and continuity for girls, and autonomy and separation for boys.7 Dinnerstein looks particularly at how ambivalence directed towards mother - who was not only a nurturer, but also an all-powerful, larger- than-life figure - was later projected onto women in general. She theo- rized that this ambivalence took different forms for girl and boy children but argued through a somewhat different analysis than did Chodorow. Both Chodorow and Dinnerstein, however, believe that oppression and cultural pathology are rooted in early child-care arrangements and that sharing child care more equally would foster less polarized gender identities for males and females, which would constitute a prescription for major social change. I agree that attention on child-care arrangements in Western society would be beneficial, but I think that their analyses promote overly simple solutions and obscure some assumptions in the psychoanalytic interpretation of infancy that as feminists we might do well to examine. The first is that the infant, from birth to about six months of age, is in a virtually complete symbiosis with the mother or primary caregiver. In effect, psychoanalytic theory begins with the image of a nonperson, without subjectivity, who then differentiates and develops a self. The only impetus for development that is theorized as originating within the infant is a kind of biological readiness, spurts of brain growth that give the child the "hardware" to enable him or her to receive the "software" of gender identity and culture. The computer/machine metaphor cap- tures the mind/body split inherent in this view, which lacks a concept of a true subjectivity in the infant. Even the most current feminist inquiries seem to assume this view of the infant as less-than-a-person which, if directed toward an adult of any gender or culture, would certainly be regarded as an incomplete perception/conceptualization and an objectification of him or her. For example, in a national conference on feminist psychology in 1988, Luise Eichenbaum described a major theme for women's psychology as the study of the environment "in 6Maroney, "Embracing Motherhood," 399. 7Nancy Chodorow, The Reproduction of Mothering (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1978); Dorothy Dinnerstein, The Mermaid and the Minotaur (New York: Harper Colophon, 1976).</page><page sequence="6">188 Stephanie Lahar which the sexed neonate can become a gendered person.8 A concept of true subjectivity and personhood in the infant would not only need to be rich with potentials for development but also actually present - not acquired or even immanent. It would be unfolded, rather than con- structed. If we are to disengage from a mind/body dualism, we must regard subjectivity as originating simultaneously in relation to biological life. Psychologist and father Michael Watson describes an experience he had in a hospital elevator which illustrates the strength of prevailing cultural attitudes: On my way to visit a friend, I stepped into an elevator along with several nurses, one of whom was holding a 2 or 3-week old baby. I was drawn to the baby's face, and smiled as I lifted my hand up in front of my face and let it drop from the wrist. The baby lifted its hand to the same position, imitated my movement exactly - and smiled! I laughed. I vividly remember the looks of disapproval and boredom from the nurses, who "knew" that real interaction and communication were not possible with such a young infant.9 It is worth noting that the work of some researchers including Tom Verny and Stanislov Grof would place the beginnings of selfhood even in intrauterine experience.'0 Chodorow, Dinnerstein, and other feminists working from an object- relations perspective understand social hierarchy and oppression as a distorted reflection of the true power relations between parent and child. In this view, the parent is all-powerful, and the child is helpless and unformed. I would suggest that we also need to look backward with a more interactive view: that our social realities also color the lens through which we see childhood development. We are not "pure" observers (in the mythos of science), and I believe that our experience of social inequities, along with a mechanistic scientific and positivistic philosophical heritage, cannot help but color our views of infantile experience. A second keystone of both Chodorow's and Dinnerstein's theories is that the father is universally and functionally absent. Hester Eisenstein comments on this assumption: Even in households with very conservative gender arrangements, surely the father would have some regular physical contact with a baby from the day it arrived. Dinnerstein's (and Chodorow's) account assumed that 8From a plenary panel discussion at the conference for the Association of Women in Psychology, "New Directions in Feminist Psychology," in Bethesda, Maryland, March 1988. 9From a conversation with Michael Watson.

Certainly, the social imbalance of responsibility in male and female roles in early child care is an important determinant in personality formation. Surely, too, special aspects of the physical bond between mother and child from intrauterine experience and breastfeeding, when that takes place, have both a real and symbolic meaning. It is my view, however, that personality formation is much more complex than much of psychoanalytic theory would have us believe and requires at least two expanded concepts. The first is a view of the self based in both biology and an original subjectivity which are inseparable. The second concept entails a more dimensional representation of the environment in which we live. Harold Searles, a psychoanalyst and object-relations theorist who studied with Melanie Klein, probably developed the most explicit analysis of the role of the nonhuman environment in human development. He writes that identity "embraces, at once, one's unique self and the world with which that self is one." Studies of personality that look beyond social factors and link human experience to the natural world have not been completely absent from psychological theory; hints of an expanded view of human nature appear in the works of Klein, D.H. Winnicott, and John Bowlby. Paul Shepard and Edith Cobb also articulate excellent descriptions of how the internalization of nonhuman "others," objects, and landscapes comprises a critical part of identity formation and per- sonality development.'2 Self and world, as psychological terms, are complex constructs. As feminists, we must understand the "world" to include other people, organisms, objects, and many different layered and intersecting envi- ronments. These environments comprise not only the physical and emo- tional but include ethnic, religious, political, and economic realms of experience that women and men interact with through many stages of development. An element of fragmentation exists by isolating infancy and very early childhood and elevating their importance to the degree that psychoanalytic theories do. Because of this distortion, Chodorow's and Dinnerstein's works are valuable in the analysis we need to make but require considerable extension.

But they have also suffered from an inadequate account of differences among women of diverse races, classes, religions, or sexualities. Studies in women's psychology that have concentrated more exclusively on later stages in psychological development include Carol Gilligan's work on women's moral development and the collectively authored Women's Ways of Knowing, which outlines identity and cognitive development. I will now focus on the points at which these theorists frame or give meaning to their findings about women's experience. Gilligan makes a case for patterned and describable ethical frameworks particular to men and women and for the need to hear and value women's experience and ethics. In attempting, however, to relate these two orientations and better envision "maturity," she takes, unexamined, an almost alchemical model of combining complementary opposites to- ward a more perfect whole. She concludes In a Different Voice with the thought that "a marriage between adult development as it is currently portrayed and women's development as it begins to be seen could lead to a changed understanding of human development and a more gen- erative view of human life."'" A general androgynous model, such as the one with which Gilligan concludes her study, has been criticized on several counts by Hester Eisenstein and many other feminists. First, although it is an emotionally appealing image of unification, it tends to perpetuate masculine and feminine stereotypes, "a static concept, in which traditional notions of the masculine and the feminine [are] simply stitched back together." The implications of Gilligan's work are that if we add together women's relational abilities, which are a result of an infantile experience of continuity with mother, and men's ability to differentiate, based on an infantile experience of difference, the sum will be "health" or even, "intimacy." These ideals, however, are considerably more complex and integrated than the sum total of continuity and differentiation. The genderization of these human qualities makes it difficult to imagine their incorporation into a more integrative dynamic in a person who also retains her or his gender. Second, the androgynous model tended to "ignore or gloss over issues of power" - as well as, I would add, issues of diversity in both women and men.'4 Most important, this model puts together two frameworks of identity and ethics that emerge out of far-from-ideal developmental processes and social environments for both women and men. Simply adding these frames together to make a whole prevents us from fully examining either "Carol Gilligan, In a Different Voice (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1982), 174. '4Eisenstein, Contemporary Feminist Thought, 62; 63.</page><page sequence="9">Nature in Women's Psychology 191 one or a different potentiality altogether. It is as though we are skipping some steps. How are we to combine or alternate these frames of ethics in an integrated model? Where do they come from? Is there something biological or inherent about either the male or female frame, or do men and women favor these constellations only because of current child- care arrangements and socialization? If these distortions did not exist, would it be possible to think of a human ethics developed whole, or would the transcendence of gender obliterate necessary differences? I believe that Gilligan's study works well as a phenomenological description of a current, historically specific orientation that many women have in regard to identity and ethics, and this seems to have been her primary purpose; yet the ways in which complementary qualities would be in- tegrated into a more complete ethics needs to be specified and mediated in order to be usable in a practical way. In Women's Ways of Knowing, Mary Belenky, Blythe Clichy, Nancy Goldberger, and Jill Tarule also outline a stage development theory of cognition. The authors state at the beginning of their work that they are not attempting to speculate on why women's intellectual development seems to be different than men's but instead are offering a phenome- nological account of that difference. They take their task as describing "the ways of knowing that women have cultivated and learned to value, ways that we have come to believe are powerful but have been neglected and denigrated by the dominant intellectual ethos of our time.""5 The most complex and integrated cognitive orientation these authors describe is that of "constructed knowledge," in which the subject has the agency to choose the framework through which she will understand a particular situation. In this orientation, "truth is seen as a process of construction in which the knower participates." They also emphasize the liberatory aspects of this orientation, noting that "to see that all knowledge is a construction and that truth is a matter of the context in which it is embedded is to greatly expand the possibilities of how to think about anything."'96 In my reading of this study, I was struck by the degree to which the authors allowed their research subjects to speak and by the recognition I felt in response to their descriptions of cognitive orientations. Their ending place, however, seemed to me to be uncomfortably ambiguous. The implication is that truth is simply relative and that meaning is purely a social construction. This lack of a referential context in Women's Ways is in part a result of the authors' attempts to remain descriptive and phenomenological and to avoid speculations about the origins or '5Mary Belenky, Blythe Clichy, Nancy Goldberger, Jill Tarule, Women's Ways of Knowing (New York: Basic Books, 1986), preface. '6Belenky, Women's Ways, 138; 140.</page><page sequence="10">192 Stephanie Lahar larger implications of the differences they are able to portray so well. But as both humanistic and feminist critiques of science have pointed out, there are no "value-free" descriptions in science or psychology. In this study, the most integrated form of subjectivity and cognition that the authors describe, that of "constructed knowledge," implies a social construction of truth that is relative, but there is no speculation about the origins and meaning of this construction. Like Gilligan's theory, this one becomes to a degree an extension of the psychology of the male subject, thus leaving the basic presumptions of that psychology unex- amined and unchallenged. At an ecofeminist conference at the University of Southern California in 1987, an overriding theme in the analysis of cultural dysfunction was the splitting of human experience and knowledge into isolated pieces lacking holistic or unifying images. Ellen Gaup-Dunfjeld stated that "the western world has specialized in fragmenting everything." Susan Griffin, Charlene Spretnak, and Carolyn Merchant echoed this critical perspective on the Western scientific paradigm of an objective reality. The paradigms and perceptual frameworks for reality structured by Western science are a feminist issue, since many theorists see categories of gender as either causative or parallel to a dualistic division between a value-free objectivity and an irrational and devalued subjectivity. This is also the perennial problem of a nature/culture dualism. Some feminists like Carolyn Merchant feel that the recovery of or- ganismic models or contexts is critical to a more viable social theory and propose that feminism and ecology can be linked toward this end.'7 I believe that there is a danger in too quickly adopting organismic models; however, global images, although they offer two important qualities, a context for creating meaning and a feeling of belonging that gives rise to hope and optimism, are empowering by themselves only in the sense of fostering an internal and perceptual shift. These images can be reductionist by trivializing differences and obscuring a devel- opmental process that works through mediated stages to derive meaning and images of potentiality from female, and human, experience. The struggle to develop such a process is identical with the struggle to develop not only understanding but also agency or creative power to act in the external world. In the work of all scholars who are attempting to reincorporate an organismic and developmental world view into social theories, the con- cept of nature appears as a ground or context for human society. An "7Carolyn Merchant, The Death of Nature, Ecology and the Scientific Revolution (San Francisco: Harper &amp; Row, 1980).</page><page sequence="11">Nature in Women's Psychology 193 explicit consideration of nature is lacking in most feminist psychology, although Dorothy Dinnerstein does outline a nondualistic paradigm for understanding human behavior: It is senseless, I shall argue, to describe our prevailing male-female arrangements as "natural." They are of course a part of nature, but if they should contribute to the extinction of our species, that fact would be part of nature too. Our impulse to change these arrangements is as natural as they are, and more compatible with our survival on earth. 18 The question is, do we have to engage in nature philosophy in order to make psychological studies? Psychology's limitation of observation and analysis to social realms gives us an overly narrow view of the factors in personality formation and subsequent development. Psychology's em- phasis on human relationships, with the nuclear family as the principal structure for internalizing social norms, has reflected the recognition of a crucial aspect of human experience. But if we accept the illusion that this is a complete description, we miss the opportunity to develop modes of perception and cognition that more accurately reflect both external and internal worlds. There are several factors that have prevented a more radical extension of psychological inquiry on the part of many feminist theorists. First, because the consciousness of individual feminists emerges from and is embedded in Western culture and society, even as it finds new loci of identity within that culture, it is, therefore, subject to some of the same perceptual and cognitive filters. Second, without the working out of a mediated continuum of humans and nature, the incorporation of non- human elements into theories of women's psychology is simply too dangerous. Unwittingly, a nature-culture dualism could be perpetuated in which women are put on the side of an irrational nature, and biological determinism and oppression are justified. The third factor limiting feminists is that they first theorized on social and interpersonal oppres- sions that were, to many women, most immediate and intolerable. As these oppressions have begun to change and as environmental imperatives become more pressing, it is not only appropriate but also necessary to incorporate a wider model for human experience into an ongoing project to create a liberatory and livable world. In thinking about models that might more accurately reflect and give room to developing understandings of internal and external reality, it is important to begin with a naturalistic basis for human, and female, experience. I follow Murray Bookchin in preferring "naturalistic" to '8Dinnerstein, The Mermaid and the Minotaur, 9.</page><page sequence="12">194 Stephanie Lahar "material" -avoiding the connotation of inanimate substance set in opposition to a purely subjective, psychic, or spiritual quality. By nat- uralistic, I mean a monistic but mediated worldview in which there are varying degrees and types of subjectivity present in natural phenomena, which include (but are not limited to) human life and mental processes.19 Although many cultural and individual variations exist to describe how humans have viewed their place within, in relation to, or opposed to nature in its larger sense, two paradigms have predominated in the history of Western culture and played out a kind of polarity with each other. The first, which values and primarily perceives specialization and differentiation, is represented historically in archetypal images such as the heroes of Greek mythology, Homer's wily Ulysses, for example; and by systematizations such as Darwinian evolution. It can also be understood as a key theme in a traditional or patriarchal scientific view. Through this lens, human beings have reached a unique degree of complexity in relation to the nonhuman world, which makes us distinct and separate. This basic construction can be discerned as underpinning a wide range of individual and social projects, from "self-actualization" techniques to genetic engineering for frost-resistant strawberries to a nightmarish "racial purity." The other view values and primarily perceives inclusion and sees human beings as one species, or even one element, in a much larger whole held together by a complex web of relations. It incorporates us into the natural environment. Currently popularized by the ecology movement and some feminist theorists, this view also has a history that is both light and dark. Implicitly, this paradigm has been the shadow side of "traditional" atomistic science and an occasional intrusion or welling up of animistic images and ideas from Native American and other cultures - perhaps carried, in some places and times, primarily by women. Organismic images of the world which, according to Carolyn Merchant, prevailed in Europe during the Middle Ages and in many religious systems, some of which have been extremely oppressive, also partake of this construct of human life fitting into a larger framework of existence. Concepts of nature that appear in New England Tran- scendentalist philosophy, especially the writings of Thoreau, also see us through the perspective of a small individual in the face of a much larger and more complex environment.20 In conceptualizing human purpose and potential, these two perspec- tives of human beings/nature or self/world foster different types of thinking and imaging. The view that values specialization and differ- '9Murray Bookchin, The Ecology of Freedom (Palo Alto, Calif.: Chesire Books, 1982). 29See Merchant, The Death of Nature.</page><page sequence="13">Nature in Women's Psychology 195 entiation usually favors linear developmental stages, and the view that prefers inclusion tends toward organismic contexts. To simplify and clarify fundamental perceptions of the interface of human and nonhuman nature, I am detaching the different perspectives from the power relations and disjunctions that, in reality, are thoroughly entangled. Also layered into this polarity are individual and cultural projections and anthropomorphism. That images of nature/earth/the universe as a machine, father god, mother, or grandparent are equally distorted can be argued although the ethics that arise from these different images may result in actions that have very different effects on human and nonhuman environments.2' In using the word "nature," I am attempting to assemble a particular family of meanings that encompasses several ideas but is differentiated from popular connotations, the most dualistic of which are a nonhuman environment of plants, animals, and rocks and a transcendental being or mind. Nature could be said to be all of the world, both as we know it and as we do not. In my definition, I see nature to be both subjective and material, and both its subjectivity and materiality are, perhaps, more complex than we can imagine. When we try to make nature into a mother, transcendental intelligence, or god, we confuse the vast and varied subjectivity(ies) of the world with human consciousness and in- tentionality and blur the diversified forms of the natural world in its entirety with our experience of human bodies. Nature as a whole defies a static image, although images are useful resting points in our own growing subjectivity. I am also defining nature as a full range of potentials and possibilities for lived experience within a given realm, as limited by the physical constraints of that realm. For example, "men's nature," in my sense of the term, shares many possibilities for lived experience with "women's nature," but there are also some differences; for example, men do not have the potential for giving birth. They do, however, have the potential for fertilizing an ovum and for experiencing the symbolic transformation of that act as a direct agent. And obviously, biological specializations and symbolic transformations exist that are exclusive to women - men- struation, childbirth, lactation, menopause. The particular form of cog- nition and thought characteristic of human beings would be a shared possibility in the realm of human nature, although its actualization might have some different overtones as it is lived through women's and men's corporeal experience. Human nature is also a realm in which social and collective possibilities can be lived and chosen and in which many 21The issue of power relations, though outside the scope of this paper, is one that must be continually addressed as we create psychological and social models which work on not only perception and thought, but personal agency, social, and economic opportunities.</page><page sequence="14">196 Stephanie Lahar diversifying factors in addition to gender can be developed and lived. Importantly, "nature" is in no way an essential or transcendent quality but simply a realm of possibility and constraint - in philosophical terms, freedom and necessity.22 Human nature is an aspect of nature in its larger sense. We must imbue our concept of nature with both materiality and subjectivity if we are to include ourselves in it; otherwise, we cannot get out of a dualistic split. Within these nested realms of nature, we can then explore the differentiating quality of gender, which has in a similar way to nature/culture been thought of in terms of an opposition. Feminists have long noted that human qualities have been stereotyp- ically categorized as either masculine or feminine but have speculated only on sociological bases for this division. I am suggesting that a naturalistic basis for this dualism between the two views of humans' place in nature also exists. An embodied participation in both of these realities allows for a relationship to larger realms of nature, mediated by a differentiated self, which serves as a basis for a more complete subjectivity and is neither an unspecified and pell-mell combination of qualities typed as "masculine" and "feminine" nor a denial of an entire dimension of experience. Feminism has described many of the effects of the splitting and division of human experience into gender roles and has speculated on reasons for the origins of gender roles. These arguments have ranged from a principle of evil embodied in males and a social patriarchy to distortions in identity formation caused by a female monopoly on early child care. But such speculations on the splitting of human subjectivity must take into account a struggle to understand one's place in the world and in nature, and the multiple realities of being both an autonomous entity and a complex of living organisms imbedded in a larger environment and ecosystem. In addition, the common, unquestioned assumption is that some kind of complete subjectivity existed in the past: our myths are of a lost paradise, the garden of Eden, or infantile omnipotence. Perhaps we also need to consider the possibility that such images could just as well be inklings of future potentialities. When fully developed, the model I have outlined could be more fundamental, that is, more inclusive, than purely sociological explanations in offering a coherent theory of female, male, and human history and possibility. Some of the social constructions developed by many feminists, however, are more cogent in analyzing the ways in which the splitting of subjectivity has been perpetuated. The analysis of difference and power relations developed by Jean Baker Miller, the descriptions of the 22For an excellent discussion of the concepts of freedom and necessity, see Murray Bookchin, "Freedom and Necessity in Nature: A Problem in an Ecological Ethics," Alternatives 13 (1986): 29-38.</page><page sequence="15">Nature in Women's Psychology 197 effects of women's role in child care developed by Chodorow and Dinnerstein, the patterns of moral and cognitive development outlined by Gilligan, and the work of Belenky, Clichy, Goldberger, and Tarule all add to our understanding of psychological and social dynamics. Some of the woman-centered analyses of the last twenty years also have treasures to offer for understanding the unique female possibilities in- herent in biological differences and the symbolic transformations of these possibilities, although these have sometimes been woven with romanticism or mystical belief systems.2" I believe that a psychology of women needs to incorporate some aspects of experience that have been omitted for lack of a framework of relation to larger realms of nature. Furthermore, the relationships of individuals and communities to the entire family of environments in which people live and move is an area of study that has been largely ignored in feminist psychology and in psychology as a whole. As a result, models for adequately contextual self and world views are thin, and theories about the development of subjectivity and personhood are missing key pieces. To redress this, we need to naturalize symbolic systems that mediate both individual and group experience and locate their sources in the human body and the natural environment, as well as in familial and social relationships. Such phenomena as gods and archetypes, imbued with occult powers and parental projections, would be transformed into images of future potentialities - still beautiful, awe- inspiring, and mysterious but recognized, as well, as versions of the self. Not only will a naturalization of symbolic worlds give us a larger model for analyzing factors in identity formation and personality development, but it will also offer a rational and naturalistic basis for understanding commonalities and differences among men, women, and nonhuman life. When combined with an awareness of social factors which shape per- sonality and development, a more complete picture of our own limitations and possibilities will be available. The causes of individual and social dis-ease are more complex than has generally been acknowledged in psychology and in feminist and other social critiques. As I have noted elsewhere, factors that individuals experience as damaging include dominating and negating relationships with other persons, the loss of ethnic and regional affinities and a sense of community, and environmental destruction. Feminism has primarily created projects that deal with human relations and the building of meaningful communities; however, a mediated and rational understand- ing of women in relation to more inclusive realms of human and "Jean Baker Miller, Toward a Newv Psychology of Women (Boston: Beacon Press, 1976).</page><page sequence="16">198 Stephanie Lahar nonhuman nature can provide a place to work out psychological and social models that reflect our experience with increasing accuracy, giving us room to work out both theories of development and meaningful contexts. In this, my hope is that individual women and men can construct sensibilities that are linked and yet differentiated, possessing a fuller subjectivity and creative agency to act in the world.</page></plain_text>
