<plain_text><page sequence="1">Israel and Iran: Bilateral Relationships and Effect on the Indian Ocean Basin. By Robert B. Reppa, Sr. New York: Praeger, 1974. 187pp. $16.50. Shahrough Akhavi The literature on the foreign policy of small pow- ers continues to evolve, with some recent material from the Middle East field. Among these should be cited Shah- ram Chubin and Sepehr Zabih, The Foreign Relations of Iran (Berkeley: University of California, 1973); Rouhallah K. Ramazani, Iran's Foreign Policy, 1941-1973: A Study of Foreign Policy in Modernizing Nations (Charlottesville, Va.: University of Virginia Press, 1975); and Michael Brecher's two important volumes: The Foreign Policy Sys- tem of Israel (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1972), and Decisions in Israel's Foreign Policy (London: Oxford University Press, 1974). Numerous essays have also come out of some of the strategic studies "think tanks," in- cluding the International Institute for Strategic Studies, in London; the American Enterprise Institute, in Washing- ton; the Center for Strategic Studies at Georgetown Uni- versity in Washington; and this is not to mention the efforts of the international relations institutes in Israel and Iran--the Leonard Davis Institute in Jerusalem and the recently organized Institute for International Political and Economic Studies in Tehran. Although the quality of the writings of the authors writing about Iran and Israel varies and differs in terms of their analytical approaches and general scope, they are mainly characterized by the attempt to be systematic. Among the variables that are central to these studies-- especially the books mentioned above--are the structure Shahrough Akhavi is Associate Professor of Government and International Studies of the University of South Carolina. IRANIAN STUDIES 96</page><page sequence="2">of the Middle East regional international system, inter- actional analysis, elite perceptions, penetration, strati- fication. In a word, they go beyond the traditional method used by observers of Middle East foreign policy: descriptive narrative. Therefore, this is a disappointing book. There are three reasons for this: (1) the title is misleading, as the discussion deals with Israel and Iran discretely and seldom in terms of their bilateral relationship; (2) it is analytically weak; (3) its tone and style, at least in the early part of the book, are jejune. To begin with the last item first, Reppa employs a breezy rhetoric that can be very disconcerting. On p. 68 the 1963 riots in Iran are considered "this mullah-inspired rebellion." Such a characterization glosses over the very real involvement of urban professionals, bureaucrats, in- tellectuals, tribal'-elements and the bazaar. On p. 45 he gratuitously makes a distasteful comment about the word, Aryan "--a name well-known in Europe in the 20th century after Adolph Hitler made it synonymous with 'master race."' And again, on the same page: "It gives one a start to-be thinking of Iran today as a relatively insignificant less- er developed country and then notice on the cover of an Iranian's passport the French words: 'L'Empire d'Iranl"' [sic]. Errors also mar his presentation, such as his as- sertion on p. 68 that the January 1963 referendum on the Shah's "White Revolution" resulted in the acceptance of "the twelve reforms." In fact, the referendum was called to decide six reform projects, and the others have been added gradually in the years since. On p. 111, Stalin is credited with arming the Arabs, and although the Jerusalen Post, May 25, 1970, is cited as evidence, no further ex- planation is given. It is normally considered that Sta- lin's attitude toward Middle East regimes was that they were either the creatures of the British or that they were fascist. Certainly it was not Stalin's policy to arm Arab governments. On p. 66, Dr. Reppa oversimplifies in re- porting that the Shah's third marriage consolidated his 97 WINTER-SPRING 1977</page><page sequence="3">ties with the military because his bride's family had an army background. This might be so if the family were highly regarded by the officer elite, but how is one to know if this be the case? Indiscretions of this kind do not necessarily lurk on every page. They appear often enough, however, to cause the reader to wonder what the author was thinking of, where was he getting some of his data, and what happened to the editors? The analytical weakness of the book stems from the author's consistent implicit utilization of the state-cen- tric model of international relations without ever spell- ing out his reasons for its relevance for the study he has embarked upon. In other words, he does not explicit- ly adopt a methodology and apply it. Instead, states are implied to be the actors in Middle East politics, and lit- tle, if any, attention is given to the political behavior of decision makers. This comes close to anthropomorphic characterization, of the sort conveyed by "Iran is inter- ested in security" or "Israel needs petroleum." Political interaction in the Middle East and beyond is treated as just so many billiard balls darting among and colliding with one another. Dr. Reppa's main thesis is that Israel and Iran have common interests in oil and security, but his presentation of data supporting this is brief and too reliant on secondary sources. Perhaps he is at a disad- vantage on this score, since much of Iran-Israel relations remains obscure owing to the deliberate withholding of in- formation by both sides. In consequence, he is detoured from exploring Iran-Israel relations into historical sketch- es of each country that are unproductive, given the intent of the book. In separate chapters entitled the "Indian Ocean Basin" and "Israel, Iran and the Major Powers" he dis- cusses the evolution of geopolitical theory (Mahan, Mac- kinder, Spykman, et al.) and the interests of a variety of Indian Ocean powers. However, he unaccountably does not relate this discussion to Iranian and Israel policy and relations except for two short paragraphs on American IRANIAN STUDIES 98</page><page sequence="4">policy. In fact, as the pages turn, his preoccupation with Soviet and Chinese actions becomes the dominant mo- tif. And this brings us to our third point about the irrelevance of his title. This seems less a work on Iran-Israel relationships and more of a sort of geopolitical primer on the Middle East and South Asia. Neither does it address the effect that the bilateral relationship of the two Middle East states has on the Indian Ocean area--although the sub- title of the wo-k appears to hold out the promise of do- ing so. Dr. Reppa's background includes experience in the Defense Intelligence Agency of the Department of De- fense. He may have intended his manuscript to be read by a military audience being introduced to Middle East and South Asian politics. If this is the case, one wonders why the particular forum of the Praeger Special Studies Series was selected. This series has gained the reputa- tion of providing analytical research in international relations and international economics and is thus not the appropriate vehicle for this book. In conclusion, this book is unfortunately not the one to read if one is in- terested in foreign policy relationships between Israel and Iran, the claims of its author notwithstanding. 99 WINTER-SPRING 1977</page></plain_text>
