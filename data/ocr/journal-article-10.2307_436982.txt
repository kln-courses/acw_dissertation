<plain_text><page sequence="1">The History and Development of the Chester Cycle' Lawrence M. Clopper For most of the sixteenth century the antiquarians and citizens of Chester believed that the city's Whitsun plays had been established in 1327-28 by their first mayor, Sir John Arnewaye; moreover, even after it had been shown that Arnewaye was neither the first mayor nor mayor in 1327, the antiquarians continued to associate the institution of the plays with him.2 Similarly, modern scholars have called Chester's Whitsun plays medieval even though they have found no evi- dence for their existence before 1422, when they were performed on Corpus Christi day, or any reference to them as Whitsun plays until 1521; at the same time, scholars acknowledge that the plays continued to be performed until 1575, well into Elizabeth's reign and within fifteen years of Marlowe's Tamburlaine and Shakespeare's first dramatic efforts.3 The historians of English literature seem to imagine that the medieval cycle at Chester was complete in the early fifteenth century, that it was elaborated and enlarged by the end of the century, but that it continued more or less unchanged from the late fifteenth century until its demise in 1575.4 To the contrary, the sparse evidence of the fifteenth century suggests that the Corpus Christi play was more a Passion play than a cycle; the evidence of the sixteenth century is that the cycle as we know it was largely an li/The research on the dramatic records of Chester was undertaken with generous assistance from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the American Council of Learned Societies, and the American Philosophical Society; the records are to be published in the second volume of the series, Records of Early English Drama, based at the University of Toronto.

The earliest lists (e.g., BM Harl 2125, fol. 23v; BM Add 29779, fols. 11 rv) date Arnewaye's mayoralty to 1328-29; however, in 1594 Mayor William Aldersay corrected these lists on the basis of documents in his and the city's possession and showed that Arnewaye was not the first mayor-Sir Walter Lynnett was-and that Arnewaye had been mayor about 1268-78 (see Aldersay's preface to his list, in BM Add 29780, fol. 93r). BM Add Charters 50004-6 confirm the Aldersay list. Both the Early and Late Banns, as do David Rogers's Brevaryes, attribute the authorship or the establishment of the plays to Arnewaye.

There was a Corpus Christi play at Chester by 1422, for in that year there was a dispute between the bowers, fletchers, and coopers on the one side and the ironmongers on the other over their respective obligations for the Flagellation and the Crucifixion. There are other references to the Corpus Christi play, includ- ing the rental of city lands to guilds for places to store their carriages, up to 1472 when the saddlers were issued a forty-year charter to sustain their occupation and their costs for the play.5 Except for a document which records a dispute in 1474 about the Corpus Christi procession,6 there are no other records which refer to the Corpus Christi play or procession; indeed, the period from 1474 to 1521 is almost totally devoid of references to guild dramatic activities. On Feb- ruary 4, 1521, the pewterers, founders, and smiths decided to remain separate guilds in all respects except that they "agreid to berre &amp; drawe to whitson playe &amp; Corpus christi light." 7 Subsequent to the making of this agreement, in 1531-32 Thomas Newhall wrote a new proclamation for the plays and, in the same year or the year following, the goldsmiths and the masons entered into an agreement to share a carriage with the vintners and the dyers, two guilds which had shared a carriage in the past.8 The most significant change during the hundred years from 1422 to 1532 may have been the one which resulted in the practice of referring to the "play" as the "plays." All the documents which include references to the Corpus Christi play use the singular form of the word; moreover, the 1521 pewterers' agreement uses the singular for the "whitson playe," whereas the Newhall Proclamation of 1531-32 and all subsequent documents use the plural.9 In addition, the Early 5/The rentals, primarily from the time of Edward IV, were copied by Randle Holmes III in the seventeenth century (BM Harl 2158, fols. 33v-65r); they were, according to Holmes, much disordered and decayed. The earliest specific references to carriage houses are those in 1467-68 for the mercers, bakers, tailors, shearmen, and drapers, and those in 1478-81 for the saddlers. There are rentals of lands for unspecified purposes as early as 1437-38 for the mercers and 1438- 39 for the fishmongers. The saddlers' charter is enrolled in the Recognizance Rolls of Chester (Public Record Office, CHES 2/144, mb. 7). 6/The Bowers' and Fletchers' agreement, M/B/5, fol. 216r (Morris, p. 572). 7/See n. 3 above. 8/Newhall Proclamation, Assembly Files, Ch Arch, A/F/l, fol. 12r (hereafter cited as A/F).

Between 1521 and 1532 the play was sufficiently altered that it came to be designated by the plural. The decade 1521-32 proves, in fact, to be of great significance in the history of the cycle. The shift to Whitsuntide seems to have involved-either at the time of the shift or subsequent to it-a change in the route of the guild procession. The route that the Corpus Christi procession took in 1474 is identical with the one which preceded the clergy's Corpus Christi play in later years. The bowers' and coopers' 1474 agreement says that the procession marched from Saint "maire kirke opon the hill of the Cety aforesaid vnto the Colage of Seint lohns.. ." and the Early Banns say that Appon the day of corpus christi The blessed sacrament caried shalbe And A play sett forth by the clergye They come from saynt maries on the hill the churche of saynt lohns vntill. [Lines 160-69] The documents of the 1560-70s and the Rogers antiquarian descriptions of the seventeenth-century indicate that the Whitsun plays took a different route.l" Though they may have assembled at the Barrs outside Eastgate, they first per- formed before the clergy at Abbey Gates and then moved to the Pentice where they played before the mayor and Common Council. There is some evidence they subsequently performed in Watergate and Bridge Streets. It is very likely that the change in the route of the procession coincided with the decision to perform the cycle in more than one location; consequently, the Whitsun play must have adopted new techniques of production which resulted in their being described as the Whitsun plays. The alteration in terminology may have been occasioned by the three-day performance schedule and by the use of movable stages for the performance of each playlet at four places in the city, for, as long as the "play" was performed at one location, St. John's, or on one day, of the cycle; in all other cases Newhall refers to the Whitsun "playes" (cf. also the revised proclamation which precedes the Early Banns, BM Harl 2150, fol. 86r). In the Late Banns, the Trever and Webster disputes of 1568, the smiths', the painters', and the coopers' accounts, and other documents which can be dated after 1531-32, the plural is always used. 10/The Early Banns, BM Harl 2150, fols. 85v-88v (Greg, pp. 130-39; Salter, "Banns," 16:137-41) declare that the guilds will bring forth their "playes" in the prologue, but at the conclusion the writer refers to "this godely play / In the whitson weeke" and to the "play sett forth by the clergye" on "the day of corpus christi." In the final sixteen lines the poet speaks of "these playes" three times, but it is equally plausible that he is referring to both the Whitsun play and the clergy's play as that he is using the locution "plays" to specify the Whitsun plays. See below for a discussion of the date of composition of the Early Banns. 11/Clopper, pp. 77-78, and "The Staging of the Medieval Plays of Chester: A Response," Theatre Notebook 28 (1974): 65-70.</page><page sequence="4">222 Modern Philology (February 1978) it could still be regarded as a single play even though various guilds were respon- sible for individual segments of it. Once the play was broken up into units and placed on movable stages, it may no longer have been regarded as a play, but may have been seen as a series of plays. There is the possibility, therefore, that the Corpus Christi play was shifted to Whitsuntide before 1521 but that it remained much the same; after 1521, the play began to be performed on movable stages over a three-day period at more than one location in the city. If there were major alterations in the means of production during the period 1521-32, we might expect to find evidence other than this change in terminology. The goldsmiths' agreement with the vintners seems to provide that evidence.12 In August 1531 or 1532 the goldsmiths and the masons made an agreement to share the pageant wagon owned by the vintners and the dyers. As Professor Salter has pointed out, the three guilds were able to conclude their agreement because the vintners performed on Monday, the goldsmiths on Tuesday, and the dyers on Wednesday.13 But the agreement may be more significant than this; it may indi- cate that the cycle had only recently moved to a three-day schedule. The point that needs explaining is not why the agreement was feasible, but why the agreement had not been made earlier. What occasioned the agreement between these guilds at this particular time ? The goldsmiths apparently did not have a carriage prior to this time, and it is quite possible that other guilds did not have wagons of their own during the time that the cycle was known as a play. As long as the play was performed in one place, or on one day, it was not necessary that each guild have a carriage of its own, because guilds who had contiguous plays and similar sets could share. Indeed, the guilds may have originally constructed wagon-stages not for the purposes of ambulatory performances but for the ease of moving the sets from a storage area to a designated location, where they could be amassed to form a place-and-scaffold stage and where each guild could use the set most appropriate for its segment of the cycle. When Chester shifted to ambulatory production, each guild had to have a pageant of its own; still, it was not necessary that they own a wagon as long as they could share one with another guild which performed on a separate day or with one which performed on the same day. If the latter were the case, the pageants would have had to be separated by a sufficient period of time to allow the wagon to move through all of its performances and return to its first location for the second series of performances. The goldsmiths-vintners agreement seems to satisfy all the conditions of the hypothesis stated above. First, the vintners already had an agreement to share a wagon with the dyers before they made the second agreement with the goldsmiths. The vintners' and the dyers' mutual ownership is eminently reasonable: the vintners produced Herod and the Magi and the dyers the Antichrist; each needed a tyrant figure, each needed a palace; indeed, the Antichrist is modeled on Herod. Since the dyers had the penultimate play, the two guilds could share a pageant regardless of whether the cycle were performed in one location on the 12/See n. 8 above. 13/Salter, MDC, pp. 58-59, and "Banns," 16:3-4.</page><page sequence="5">Clopper/History and Development of the Chester Cycle 223 same day or in several locations on the same day or in several locations on different days. But the goldsmiths' Slaughter also had a Herod and needed a palace; since the set for the three plays is very much the same, why was the agreement not made until 1531-32? It is conceivable that at some period in the cycle's history the vintners, the mercers, and the goldsmiths produced one play, or that the vintners and mercers performed a Magi play, and the goldsmiths the Slaughter."4 In either case the goldsmiths could have shared the vintners' and mercers' pageant, for, as long as the performance occurred in one place on one day, the goldsmiths could have used the vintners' pageant without hindrance. The making of the agreement, therefore, must indicate that there was a new impediment to the sharing of the pageant; the most likely possibility is that the shift to a three-day schedule necessitated the making of an agreement between the goldsmiths and another guild. The obvious choice was the vintners because their wagon was suited to the goldsmiths' play and because there would be no difficulty readying it for the performance on the following day. When we consider that the Newhall Proclamation was newly written in 1531-32, that the goldsmiths concluded their agreement with the vintners about that time, and that there were a number of changes, as we shall see, in the cycle and in the Early Banns at about the same time, then we are forced to realize that the period from the first reference to the Whitsun play in 1521 to the announce- ment (1531-32) that the plays would be performed on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday in Whitsun week is a significant period in the history of the Chester cycle. The two documents which can help us distinguish the Corpus Christi play and the Whitsun play from the Whitsun plays are the Harley 2104 List of Guilds and the Early Banns, both of which are undated (see table 1).15 The Harley List of Guilds is a thin strip of paper which Salter discovered in a manuscript unrelated to the drama but which he recognized as relevant because of its reference to "pe Wyfus of pe town assumpcion beate marie." There is no heading to the list, but on the basis of "the order in which the names occur and the inclusion of the Wives," Greg decided that the document was "a list of companies producing pageants in the Whitsun plays," and, on the basis of the handwriting, he dated it to 1500. Though it is not possible to date it more precisely, we can assign it to the period before the composition of the Early Banns because the Banns include guilds (e.g., tanners, cappers, and painters) which are not on the list but which are in the Late Banns and the extant texts.16 14/Salter, "Banns," 16:3-5. 15/The Harley 2104 List has been published in Greg, pp. 170-71. 16/This is the most important distinction between Salter's analysis and mine; as a consequence, we arrive at radically different interpretations of the significance and date of the Early Banns. Despite the fact that the Harley list does not begin with the tanners but associates them with corvisers and that it does not include the painters at all, Salter ("Banns," 16:9-10) accepts the dating of the Harley list to 1500 at the same time that he claims that the tanners' and the painters' plays date from 1467. His discussion of the tanners' play is particularly illustrative of his failure to heed the documents and the logic of his own argument. He cites Morris-!,who must always be checked-to the effect that the tanners were separate from the shoemakers by 1410 but fails to note their association with the corvisers in the Harley list. He notes that the tanners paid eightpence to the city in 1467-68 "pro consilium" in which to house their carriage. However, I have been unable to find the entry, and, in his later discussions of carriage houses</page><page sequence="6">224 Modern Philology (February 1978) TABLE 1 A COMPARISON OF THE HARLEY LIST OF GUILDS AND THE ORDER OF COMPANIES IN THE EARLY BANNS HARLEY 2104 EARLY BANNS (HARLEY 2150) List of Guilds Order of Guilds Stanza B-Rhymes ... ................................................ .. 1 say/pray 2 tyde/while* Tanners 3 best/prest Drapers .....................................

He isolates the work of the poet who revised the tanners' play ("Banns," 15:452-53); identifies similar revisions in the painters' Shepherds, the smiths' Christ and the Doctors, and other plays; and states that the tanners' reviser inserted the stanza at the end of the cappers' play, which indicates that the cycle stopped on the first day after the cappers' play (5). He dates the tanners' reviser's work to the period 1467-68 (pp. 14-16) at the same time that he argues that the cappers' play entered the cycle in 1521 (p. 455). Finally, if the painters do not appear in the Harley List of 1500, then it is impossible that their play could have been revised in 1467-68.</page><page sequence="7">Clopper/History and Development of the Chester Cycle 225 The list, therefore, probably comes from the period 1474-1521 when there are no longer references to the Corpus Christi play or yet any to the Whitsun play. I believe, however, that the list is neither a list of guilds in the Whitsun plays nor in the Corpus Christi play but of their order in the Corpus Christi procession. The puzzling feature of the list is that it separates the "Cokus" from the "Tapsters and hostlers," guilds which are associated in the Harrowing of Hell by the Early Banns, the Late Banns, and the extant texts.17 Further, these two guilds are preceded in the list by the ironmongers, who had the Crucifixion as early as 1422, and are followed by the skinners, who are responsible for the Resurrection in all the later documents. The only conceivable action between the Crucifixion and the Resurrection is the Harrowing; consequently, the list cannot describe separate pageants in the play or plays but must record the position of the guilds in the procession. From the 1474 bowers' and coopers' agreement we know that some guilds who shared the costs of the procession wished to retain their identity by marching together."8 The cooks and tapsters, who apparently shared the expense of the Harrowing, may have wished to retain their separate identities by marching one after the other. Since the guilds who took part in the procession also took part in the play, the list gives us some indication of the contents of the play; at the same time we should keep in mind that other guilds in the list may have co- operated in a segment of the play but may have been listed separately for the procession (e.g., the vintners, the mercers, and the goldsmiths; the bowers and coopers; and the ironmongers). The Early Banns are included in a transcription of the "white booke of the pentice," which begins on folio 49r of Harley 2150, but which itself is part of a Holmes manuscript compilation entitled "Deedes &amp; customes with other notes conserning the Citty of Chester." Many, but not all, of the entries in this section of the manuscript are identical with those preserved in the Chester Assembly Book (AB/1) and generally appear in the same order; consequently, Harley 2150 and the Assembly Book, each leaving parts uncopied, must have been compiled from a common prototype, or Harley 2150 is a copy of a city record kept at the Pentice and the extant Assembly Book is a separate, nearly duplicate record kept at another location."1 Two hands are evident throughout the section: one is a legal hand of the last half of the sixteenth century and the other is the loose secretary hand of Randle Holmes II, an antiquarian who transcribed numerous records during the period 1630-68. Most of the Banns entry is in the 17/For a discussion of the text of the extant cooks' and tapsters' play and their long association see R. M.

My examination of Harley 2150 has led me to essentially the same conclu- sions as did Greg's; the manuscript is a copy of a record nearly parallel to that of the White Book which was kept in the mayor's coffer in the Pentice. I think the notations in Randle Holmes's hand indicate that he collated this manuscript with the White Book and added material that was in the White Book but not in the Harley manuscript.</page><page sequence="8">226 Modern Philology (February 1978) legal hand; the remainder-lines 136-210 and some of the marginalia-is in Holmes's hand.20 There are three items in the entry: the List of Companies and the parts they had in the plays, a revised Newhall Proclamation, and the Early Banns them- selves.21 The proclamation is a Protestant version of the Newhall Proclamation of 1531-32 from which have been deleted all references to Henry Francis, a monk and supposed author of the plays, Pope Clement's Bull, and the granting of pardons. The revised proclamation puts the extant version of the Banns in post- Reformation times, and the inclusion of the entire entry amid items from Henry Gee's mayoralty in 1539-40 establishes the terminus ad quem for the document as a whole. There would be no reason to suspect that the proclamation and Banns did not describe the cycle in 1539-40 were it not for the presence of the List of Companies. The Banns and the List of Companies differ at several points in their assignment of plays, and thus the list could neither be derived from the Banns nor could the two describe the cycle at one time. The Banns indicate that the mercers had the Presentation and that the wives played the Assumption, whereas the list omits the latter and shows the former to have had the extant Magi play.22 The list and Banns give the smiths the Purification; the play texts, though they retain this title, are composed of the Presentation of Christ and Christ and the Doctors. Since the List of Companies does not include guilds and plays which are in Harley 2104 and the Early Banns themselves, but does corre- spond to the extant texts and the Late Banns, it must have been compiled after 1548 when the Assumption may have been suppressed, and added to the entry by the scribe who copied the rest of the Early Banns entry; indeed, a list similar to this one was in circulation as a separate document among the antiquarians of Chester in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries.23 20/Greg, "Bibliographical and Textual Problems of the English Miracle Cycles," Library, 3d ser. 5 (1914): 181, says that the manuscript was copied by the first scribe earlier than 1547; and Salter, "Banns," 15:450, says it is copied on watermarked paper in use in 1548. I think it may have been copied later than that, for the manuscript includes an ordinance against mumming which is dated "3 &amp; 4 Phillip and Mary" (1556-57); furthermore, the handwriting is very much like examples 2A and 12 in Giles W. Dawson and Laetitia Kennedy-Skipton, Elizabethan Handwriting: 1550-1650 (New York, 1960), pp. 31, 51. These are dated 1571 and 1572, respectively. 21/The List of Companies is not to be confused with the Harley 2104 List of Guilds. The List of Companies enrolls the guilds on the left side of the page and the part each had in the Whitsun plays on the right; in addition, it divides the cycle into nine plays for Monday, nine for Tuesday, and seven for Wednesday. 22/Greg, "Bibliographical and Textual Problems," pp. 184-85, says that the Assumption was omitted from the List of Companies because it was never an integral part of the cycle (see also E. K. Chambers, Mediaeval Stage [London, 1903], 2:409); however, the argument ignores the inclusion of the wives' play in both the Harley 2104 List and the Early Banns. Chambers's and Greg's argument seems to be based on the fact that the Assumption may have been played separately in 1499 before Prince Arthur (BM Harl 2133, fol. 36r) and possibly once before in 1487-88 (BM Add 29777, item 163; see Salter, MDC, pp. 49-50); the Assumption and the Shepherds alone were performed in 1515-16 (Harl 2125, fol. 33v). The occasional performance of a play by itself does not force the conclusion that the play was not an integral part of the cycle. 23/Similar lists can be found in all five copies of Rogers's Brevaryes and in other antiquarian collections (e.g., BM Harl 2125, fols. 14r-15r; BM Add 11335, fols. 16r-17r; BM Add 29779, fols. 8r-8v).

The Banns are composed in an eight-line rime couee stanza (aaabaaab) which allots a half-stanza to each guild's pageant. The mercers, on the other hand, receive eleven lines and several other guilds eight lines each; the deviant stanzas are those which describe the tanners' Lucifer, the wrights' Nativity, the vintners' Magi, the mercers' Presentation, the goldsmiths' Slaughter of the Innocents, and the shearmen's Prophets of Antichrist. The least disturbed sequence is that from the smiths' Purification through the weavers' Doomsday, and we know this to be the oldest stratum of the cycle because it agrees with the Harley List of Guilds.24 Con- spicuous in their absence from the Harley list are the tanners, the cappers, and the painters.25 Included on the Harley list and in the undisturbed four-line half-stanza of the Early Banns are the following guilds: drapers, drawers of Dee, barbers, smiths through the cooks, skinners through the wives, hewsters, and weavers and walkers. The cappers and painters are also included in the undis- turbed portion of the Early Banns but did not enter the cycle until after the Harley list was drawn up. Since both the oldest and youngest strata of the plays are in the uniform stanza, we may conclude that the Early Banns were written after the cappers' and painters' plays entered the cycle and that the tanners', wrights', vintners', mercers', goldsmiths', and shearmen's plays were subsequently added or underwent revision.26 The earliest possible date for the entry of the cappers' play into the cycle is 1505; the first reference to the painters' Shepherds occurs in 1515-16.27 In 1523-24, lists describe the vintners' play as "king herod &amp; the mount victoriall" and that, since there is no reference to the "mount victoriall" in either set of Banns or in the heading of the pageant in any of the extant play manuscripts, the lists are not independent of each other but copies of a common original. 24/See table 1. 25/The tanners do not begin the Harley list; instead, they are associated with the corvisers. 26/There is a major difference here between Salter's analysis and mine. Salter, "Banns," 15:451, assumed that the disruption of a stanza indicated that a play entered the cycle or that an older one was divided. He did not consider the possibility that a disruption might indicate that a pageant had been recomposed, expanded, or otherwise rewritten and that these alterations necessitated a revision of the Banns. Because he did not consider revisions of the pageants important, he allows himself to argue, on p. 454, that the eight-line deviant stanza of the wrights' Nativity does not indicate a change in the wrights' play but that it substantiates the entry of the cappers' play into the cycle. The cappers' description, however, is part of a regular stanza. 27/Cappers' Petition, BM Harl 1996, fol. 120r (Morris, p. 316, n. 4). The petition is undated. Morris, without comment, transcribes the opening line of the document as follows: "Shewing that wheras they of late tyme by the right worshipfull Thomas Smythe, 1520-21, in tyme of his mairaltie ... ." Salter, "Banns," 15:455, accepts the date. Morris, p. 582, however, lists David Middleton as mayor in 1538-39 and Edward Middleton as mayor in 1523-24. Fortunately, a copy of the response to the petition survives; in 1534, Mayor Henry Gee was forced to reissue the response of "Dauid Middleton Maire" (A/F/I, fol. 19r). The petition therefore can be dated to 1523-24. In 1515-16, "the shepards play &amp; the Assumption of our lady was played in Saint Johns churchyard" (BM Harl 2125, fol. 33v); the painters were given a charter in 1534 (BM Harl 2054, fol. 87v; P.R.O., CHES 2/323, 13-14, Chas 2, mb. 4). Randle Holmes II noted that the painters "Before H7 tyme . . .were a society of paynters &amp; barbers." The performance at St. John's may indicate that the painters' play was new and that the cycle was still being performed at St. John's in one location.</page><page sequence="10">228 Modern Philology (February 1978) the cappers petitioned Mayor David Middleton to restrain the mercers from meddling with the cappers' trade, for they had been granted sole rights to the retailing of coarse wares by Mayor Thomas Smyth in order that they might "brynge forthe A playe concernynge the store of kynge balak &amp; Balam the proffet." Thomas Smyth was mayor in 1504-5, 1511-12, 1515-16-the year the Shepherds was performed-1520-21--the year the pewterers' agreement was made-and 1521-22.28 The cappers must have gotten their play, therefore, sometime between 1505 and 1522. Furthermore, if the title to the Early Banns entry is a vestige of the days when the Whitsun plays were the Corpus Christi play, then we can conclude that the Early Banns were written when the play was performed on Corpus Christi day.29 They would have been revised by 1521 when the play was called the "Whitson playe" in the pewterers' agreement, and perhaps again when they were performed "in the whitson weke... vppon monday tuysday and wen- nysday" (lines 151-53). The terminus a quo for the Early Banns, therefore, is 1505-21, when they were written for the Corpus Christi play; between 1521 and 1532 they were revised to make them conform with the shift to Whitsuntide and the performance over a three-day schedule. Some of the revisions in the Early Banns must have occurred after the cappers' and painters' plays entered the cycle but before the Newhall Proclama- tion of 1531-32. In the proclamation, Newhall says that the plays will begin "with the creacion &amp; fall of Lucifer" and end with the "iugement of the world." Therefore, the tanners, who performed the Fall of Lucifer but who are associated with the shoemakers in the Harley list and who have a deviant stanza in the Banns, must have received their play after the cappers and painters entered the cycle.30 The lengthiest disruption in the Banns appears in the section which describes the vintners', mercers', and goldsmiths' pageants.31 Despite the oddity of the assignment of eight lines each to the vintners and the goldsmiths and eleven 28/Morris, pp. 581-82. The Aldersay Lists of Mayors also note that the Sheriffs' Breakfast Shoot began in Smith's term in 1511-12; thus, Smith seems to have been responsible for a number of changes in the city's customs during his successive terms of office. See BM Add 11335, fol. 23r; there are similar entries in BM Add 29780, fols. 63r and 126r, and BM MS Stowe 811, fols. 20v and 49r. 29/Since the scribe substituted the List of Companies for whichever list originally followed the title of the Early Banns entry, we can only conjecture that the title refers to the entry as a whole and not just to that part which pertains to the clergy's Corpus Christi play; nevertheless, it seems possible that the plays continued to be performed on Corpus Christi day into the early sixteenth century and that the growth of that play encouraged the shift to Whitsuntide. 30/Salter, "Banns," 15:454, recognizes that the tanners did not introduce the Lucifer play until after the composition of the Early Banns; however, he concludes that the tanners produced their play before 1467 (see n. 16 above). 31/The descriptions of the vintners', mercers', and goldsmiths' plays appear at the beginning of the section copied by Holmes (lines 136-210). The original scribe ceased copying near the bottom of fol. 86v, left fols. 87rv blank, and resumed his transcription with the wives' Assump- tion. One might be suspicious of the original scribe's failure to copy the vintners', mercers', and goldsmiths' descriptions if he had not also omitted to copy the apparently undisturbed section which describes the pageant of the smiths through that of the fishmongers. Greg, Trial, p. 127, argued that the original scribe lacked the copy for this section and that Holmes copied this portion from another source. There is no basis for the argument (Greg, Trial, p. 127, and Salter, "Banns," 15:450) that Holmes added the sheet of paper on which he copied the missing portions.</page><page sequence="11">Clopper/History and Development of the Chester Cycle 229 lines (a defective twelve-line stanza) to the mercers, we can safely conclude that the mercers and the vintners were joined in one pageant and the goldsmiths in another at the time that the Early Banns were originally composed because the stanza divisions before and after the entire section are either regular or their irregularities can be accounted for otherwise.32 The first two stanzas in the Banns provide a prologue to the descriptions and are followed by an inserted stanza which describes the tanners' play. Stanzas 4 and 5 are regular and describe the drapers' Creation and the drawers of Dee's Noah, and the barbers' Abraham and the cappers' Balaam, respectively. A full stanza is given to the wrights' Nativity and suggests that this stanza was originally the first half of a stanza whose last four lines remain as the description of the painters' Shepherds.33 The vintners-mercers-goldsmiths' section follows and is followed in turn by a regular stanza devoted to the smiths' and butchers' plays. Since all the stanzas are regular except for the wrights-painters' section and the tanners' insertion, we can conclude that the vintners and mercers and the goldsmiths formerly shared a stanza. The vintners were once part of the guild mercatory before they separated from the mercers; there is no known connection between the goldsmiths and either of the other two guilds. Though there is the possibility that the three guilds per- formed at one time a single play of Herod and the Magi and the Slaughter, it is probable that the vintners and the mercers performed a Magi play and the goldsmiths the Slaughter at the time the Early Banns were composed.34 Subse- quently, the vintners and the mercers separated their plays into the present Herod and the Magi and the Offering of the Magi. 32/See table 1. In the List of Apprentice Fees, 1475-76, the mercers but not the vintners are included; consequently, the guilds may not yet have been separated (see Salter, "Banns," 16:10-11, and M/B/6a, fol. 3v). 33/Salter, "Banns," 15:451, and Greg, Trial, p. 128, observe that the painters' half-stanza (lines 132-36) has a b-rhyme ("wyll") which rhymes with "skyle", the b-rhyme of the first quatrain of the mercers' stanza. They conclude that the vintners' eight-line stanza is, therefore, a disrup- tion of the original painters-mercers' stanza and indicates that the mercers and vintners had split into two. This line of reasoning, however, fails to recognize that we are left with the wrights' and the goldsmiths' two eight-line stanzas and no guilds with whom to pair them. The implication is that the wrights entered the cycle after the cappers and painters, the guilds immediately before and after them, and that the goldsmiths entered the cycle after the vintners and mercers split their play. Such a development ignores the presence of the goldsmiths and the wrights in the Harley 2104 List and contradicts Salter's assertion that the wrights' play is one of the oldest in the cycle (p. 1) and that it entered the cycle "possibly, in 1422" (p. 16), whereas the goldsmiths' play "shows some of the work of the Tanners' reviser [ca. 1467-68], but it may have been done before the separation of the Goldsmiths from the Mercers' organiza- tion... a separate play by 1531" (p. 17). I think the mercers' first quatrain is a remnant of an older stanza which was replaced by the eight-line stanza which follows it. If these correc- tions were made in the Pentice Book, then we can argue that Holmes copied the four canceled lines as well as the substituted eight-line (actually seven-line) stanza; this train of events would account for the uniqueness of the eleven-line description of the mercers' play. The four-line half-stanza may have rhymed with a four-line description for the vintners' pageant, a half- stanza now missing, or it may have described the vintners' and mercers' pageant and rhymed with the missing half-stanza which described the goldsmiths' pageant. In any case, we would have had two eight-line stanzas which used the same b-rhyme, a practice the poet adhered to in stanzas 13 and 14 and probably in the original stanzas 16-19. 34/If the goldsmiths were associated with one or both of these guilds, they may have separated themselves in 1523. The Goldsmiths' Company Book (CH Arch) has an eighteenth-century binding with the dates 1523 and 1723 stamped on the front and back covers, respectively.</page><page sequence="12">230 Modern Philology (February 1978) The wrights' Nativity and the shearmen's Prophets ofAntichrist also apparently underwent revision or expansion during this period. In 1429-30 the weavers, walkers, chaloners, and shearmen agreed to bear the costs for the procession and lights of the Feasts of Saint Mary and Corpus Christi and for the "Iwe [Jeu] de Corpus christi."35 In the Early and Late Banns and the extant texts the shear- men are no longer associated with the weavers and walkers, who produced Doomsday, but precede the hewsters and dyers, who produced Antichrist.36 The extant play is not solely concerned with the prophecies of Antichrist, but also makes numerous prophecies about and gives the fifteen signs before Doomsday; indeed, the Early Banns's List of Companies and other related lists describe the pageant as the "profettys Afore the day of dome." Since the shearmen precede the hewsters in the Harley 2104 List, and since the description of the hewsters' pageant in the Early Banns is undisturbed, we may assume that the shearmen had a play which preceded the hewsters' before the Early Banns were written, but that the play was revised in some way subsequent to the writing of the Banns. The stanza divisions seem to substantiate the revision; immediately preceding the shearmen's eight-line stanza is a half-stanza devoted to the wives' Assumption, a play we know to have been in existence in the last decade of the fifteenth century."3 It is reasonable to assume that the wives and the shearmen originally shared a regular stanza in the Early Banns and that the shearmen's half was elaborated into its present eight-line form.38 The wrights' Nativity also shows signs of revision in the extant texts. The Banns description says the play included the Nativity, Octavian, and Sybell; therefore, the play may have been expanded in order to include the sections with the imperial tyrant. We might reconstruct the writing of the Early Banns as follows. They were originally composed for the Corpus Christi play in or after 1505, the earliest date by which the cappers' play could have entered the cycle, and no later than 1521, by which time the play had been shifted to Whitsuntide. They were revised at 35/MR 4/85. 36/Salter, "Banns," 16:5-6, argues that the shearmen must have separated from the other com- panies as early as 1467-68 because they were paying for a carriage house by that time. This is certainly possible, but it does not force us to conclude, as Salter does, that the writing of the eight-line stanza in the Early Banns occurred at that time. 37/There is some discrepancy among early antiquarians about when the performance occurred. The List of Mayors in BM Add 29777, item 163, assigns it to 1487-88, that in BM Harl 2125, fol. 31r, to 1488-89. Late Lists note a performance in 1498-99; see BM Add 11335, fol. 23r; BM Harl 2133, fol. 36r, for example. Salter, MDC, pp. 49-50, discusses these discrepancies and concludes that the 1499 performance was of the smiths' Purification. 38/Since neither Salter ("Banns," 15:451 and 16:6) nor Greg (Trial, pp. 128-29) considers the possibility that an eight-line stanza may have replaced a four-line half-stanza, Salter concludes that the wives' half-stanza indicates that the Early Banns had to have been composed before 1488, the year of our first reference to the play; and they both suggest that one of the two pre- ceding plays, that of the fishmongers or of the tailors, must have entered the cycle after the wives' play and that the description of the second originally rhymed with that of the wives'. The argument ignores the simpler explanation that the shearmen's description originally rhymed with the wives' half-stanza and that the poet used the same b-rhyme in these three stanzas (16-19). Further, it ignores the rental of a carriage house to the tailors in 1467-68 and of a piece of land to the fishmongers in 1438-39 (see n. 5 above), sometime before our first reference to the wives' Assumption.</page><page sequence="13">Clopper/History and Development of the Chester Cycle 231 least once between 1521 and 1531-32, when the Newhall Proclamation was written, in order to make them conform with the three-day performance schedule, the entry of new plays into the cycle (e.g., the tanners' Lucifer), and the division of others (e.g., the vintners' Herod and the mercers' Magi). Other revisions may have been made subsequent to this period. The Banns in their present state were copied into the White Book of the Pentice and a parallel record during Henry Gee's second term of office, 1539-40, and remained unchanged until perhaps 1548 when several erasures were made in order to make the Banns conform to the suppression of the Corpus Christi feast. In the late sixteenth century the Harley 2150 copy was made by a scribe who inserted the List of Companies before the Banns entry and who left uncopied the descriptions of fifteen pageants; in the seventeenth century Randle Holmes II collated Harley 2150 with the White Book of the Pentice, copied the omitted lines, and marked the passages which had been erased. The evidence of the Harley List of Guilds, the Early Banns, and the various guild agreements suggests that the Corpus Christi play was largely a Passion play and that the Old Testament and Nativity sequences of the cycle underwent their greatest expansion between about 1505 and 1532. In the Harley list the sequence which runs from the smiths (Purification) through the weavers and walkers (Doomsday) is identical with that in the Early Banns except that the cooks are separated from the tapsters in the list and except that the Banns indicate that there were some revisions in the shearmen's play. Among the Old Testament and Nativity subjects only the drapers (Creation), drawers of Dee (Noah), barbers (Abraham and Isaac), and the smiths (Purification) appear in the Harley list and in the original stanza of the Early Banns. All the other guilds in the sequence either entered the cycle in the sixteenth century or their plays were revised during that time: the Harley list omits the tanners (Fall of Lucifer), the cappers (Balaam), and the painters (Shepherds); the revisions in the Early Banns suggest that the wrights' Nativity, the vintners' Herod and the Magi, the mercers' Presentation, and the goldsmiths' Slaughter of Innocents all underwent revision subsequent to the writing of the Early Banns. The addition of the tanners', cappers', and painters' plays and the revision of the other plays do not prove that the Corpus Christi cycle was only a Passion play; however, these alterations suggest that the play was primarily a Passion play and that the cycle may have had a truncated prologue which briefly dramatized some of the Old Testament and Nativity events and prophecies. Taken together, the evidence demonstrates that the Old Testament and Nati- vity sequences of the Chester cycle underwent considerable growth through addition and revision within the period 1505-32 and possibly within the decade 1521-32. During the same period the plays were shifted to Whitsuntide and almost certainly they began to be played over three days on wagons which were drawn to several stations within the city. No doubt it was because of these many altera- tions that William Newhall composed a new proclamation in 1531-32. The content, the shape, and the techniques of production which we associate with the plays at Chester, therefore, are early sixteenth century rather than medieval in date.</page><page sequence="14">232 Modern Philology (February 1978) Since the version of the Newhall Proclamation which precedes the Early Banns deletes all references to Catholicism, we might expect to find other evidence that the cycle and Banns had been revised in accordance with the change in religion; to the contrary, there is no evidence of other-such alterations until the reign of Edward VI.39 The smiths continued to produce the Purification and the wives the Assumption and the clergy their Corpus Christi play at least until 1539-40, when the Banns were copied into the Pentice book. Randle Holmes notes that the section which describes the play at Corpus Christi was erased, but this probably did not occur until Corpus Christi celebrations were suppressed in 1548; it certainly seems unlikely that the Pentice book scribe would have copied the section if it had already been erased before 1539-40. During the reign of Edward VI there is evidence of one major alteration in the cycle which must cause us to question whether the extant versions of the plays can safely be dated before the 1560s. The bakers had been issued a charter in 1462 in which they agreed to pay for the expenses of the Corpus Christi play; they were issued a second charter in 1552-53 which no longer included any reference to their play.40 Indeed, their obligation for the Last Supper seems to have been taken over by the shoemakers by 1550 and performed by them perhaps as late as 1561.41 Both the Early and the Late Banns refer to the shoemakers' play as the Jerusalem Carriage, and the List of Companies describes it as "the comyng of crist to Ierusalem." The extant text includes the Magdalene episode at Simon the Leper's house, the entry into Jerusalem, the cleansing of the temple, and Judas's decision to betray Christ. In the 1550 account there are payments to "the lad for leydeng the as" and the "vj chelder of esaraell," both of which indicate that the entry into Jerusalem was represented, and the payment to the Magdalene suggests that the anointing episode was included. There are additional payments to "god," "martha," "Iodas," "keyffase," "anas," "the to kneythtes," "the geyler," and the "geylers man." The absence of Simon the Leper and the presence of Martha demonstrate that the anointing episode occurred at the sisters' house after the raising of Lazarus (i.e., the extant text follows Mark 14:3-9, whereas the 1550 performance followed John 12:1-8). Annas and Cayphas, along with two Pharisees who report Christ's actions, appear in the scene of Judas's betrayal at the end of the extant play, but the cast list in the guild account suggests that the 1550 version ended with the Captivity. A single play covering events from 39/This finding is generally in accordance with Harold Gardiner's conclusions in his Mysteries' End (New Haven, Conn., 1946), pp. 61-62. 40/A seventeenth-century transcription of the Bakers' Charter can be found in BM Harl 2054, fol. 36v. A later note in the same hand, probably Randle Holmes II's, indicates that the charter was amended: "vide post 60 a grant from the Citty in tyme of william glasior maior 6 E 6 wherin the words about whitson pleas are put out" (fol. 38v). The Second Bakers' Charter (fols. 39r-40r), dated "6 Edward VI," contains no reference to the plays. 41/The only extant shoemakers' account of expenditure on the plays is undated (their accounts begin on St. Martin's day, November 11) but comes at the end of those for 3 Edward 6 (1549- 50) and before those begun in the term of Edmund Gee, 1550-51; the account, therefore, is probably for a performance in 1550 (Shoemakers' Account Book, Ch Arch, G 8/2, fols. B4r-4v).</page><page sequence="15">Clopper/History and Development of the Chester Cycle 233 the entry into Jerusalem up to the Captivity would account for payments to the two knights, "the geyler," and the "geylers man." Additional support comes from an expenditure at Midsummer, 1558, for "mendeng the tormentors heyds" (fol. C6r). These payments may have been for the Jews, Malchus, and another knight who participate in the scene of the Captivity at the end of the extant bakers' play. The Last Supper was represented, perhaps, in a shortened or Protes- tant-sanctioned form, for though there are no payments to the disciples-doubling would be possible-there is a large payment of four shillings and eightpence "ffor bakyng of godes brede." This sum and an additional ten shillings and three- pence for three "stryke of wyete" hint at the use of the bread as a token presented to the onlookers much as favors are thrown to the crowds at Mardi Gras.42 Though there are no more complete accounts of expenditure for the shoemakers' play, there is an expenditure in 1561 of twopence for going "ouer the shote at the makynge op of the playe" (fol. D3v). Since the shoemakers still had the tormen- tors' heads in 1558, they may have continued to perform the 1550 version until they made up a new play in 1561. That play, presumably, is the one which the extant manuscripts have passed down to us. The meager evidence for the period 1548-61 suggests that (1) the cycle remained more or less unchanged throughout the early Reformation period, but (2) in 1548 the clergy's Corpus Christi play was put down and (3) the bakers' play was suspended, if not in that year, certainly by 1550. It is also possible that the wives' Assumption and the smiths' Purification were suppressed; however, there is no concrete evidence to substantiate this supposition. There may have been other alterations in the texts; unfortunately, we do not have any records of expenditure on the plays, except for the shoemakers' account, that are earlier than 1561, and, thus, we cannot be certain that there was any systematic rewriting or revision of the entire cycle during this period. With the accession of Mary many customs which had been suppressed were revived. The guild and churchwardens' accounts show a resumption of the Corpus Christi procession and its continuance into the late fifties and early sixties.43 The cycle of plays undoubtedly also got a new lease on life; however, during the last twenty years of the cycle's existence, it came under pressure from within and without the city. The city's response was at various times to discontinue perfor- mance, to alter the production, and to rewrite some of the plays. During the period 1561-75 guild and civic records become continuous enough that we can say that performances of the cycle occurred only in the years 1561, 1567, 1568, 1572, and 1575; this fitful schedule indicates that there was antagonism toward the plays throughout the period, an antagonism that became even more 42/According to the Late Banns, by which time the bakers' play had been reinstated, the bakers were encouraged to "caste godes loues abroade with accustomed cherefull harte." 43/The smiths' accounts (BM Harl 2054, fols. 15r-16r) include expenditure for "lights" and "myn- strells" on Corpus Christi day in 1546, 1547, and 1548; the expenditure recurs in 1554, 1555, and periodically until 1560. The churchwardens' accounts for Trinity Church (BM Harl 2177, fols. 21v-27r) include expenditures for 1546, 1547, 1557, 1559, and 1560. The shoemakers' accounts include expenditures in 1547 and 1548; but, unexpectedly, they also appear in 1549 and 1551, when they cease until 1556.</page><page sequence="16">234 Modern Philology (February 1978) outspoken in 1572.44 When the city council, under Mayor John Hankey, decided to perform the plays that year, some discontented parties must have complained to the archbishop of York, for he attempted to have the plays halted.45 It is important to note, however, that not even all of the local clergy were opposed to the performance of the plays; the Dean and Chapter of Chester Cathedral built a mansion over the Abbey Gates and gave beer to the players that year, as they had done in 1568.46 Despite the attempt to halt the performance in 1572, a majority of the council felt it was meet to produce the plays in 1575 if they were amended.47 The city attempted in other ways to reckon with potential clerical displeasure: they performed only a selection of the pageants; they did not perform at all before the Abbey Gates; and they tried to neutralize the situation by moving the per- formance from the Christian feast of Whitsuntide to Midsummer, a civic holiday and the time of the Midsummer Fair.48 Subsequent events prove they misjudged 44/L. M. Clopper, "The Chester Plays: Frequency of Performance," Theatre Survey 14 (1973): 46-58. The evidence for performances before 1561 is meager; we know that the shoemakers performed their play in 1550, and it is probable that there were performances in 1546 and 1554 or both. There is no evidence for annual performance in this period; indeed, the evidence is strongly against it. 45/According to Mayor Aldersay's List of Mayors (BM Harl 2057, fol. 29r) "an inhibition came from the Archbushop of Yorke, to stay them [the playes], but came not in time." Another List indicates that the objection was only to some of the plays: "In this yeare the whole Playes were playde thoughe manye of the Cittie were sore against the settinge forthe therof" (BM Add 29777, item 246 [my emphasis]). 46/Chester Cathedral, Treasurer's Accounts, Dean and Chapter, vol. 2, pp. 52, 120: from 1568, "Item paid for a brode clothe againste the witson pleaes vjs viijd"; "Item for a barell of bere to yeue to the pleares to make them to drinke vj""; and from 1572, "Item for the hyre of a clothe for the mansyon ouer the gates vjS"; "Item for a barrell of byre to the players viijs." These expenditures effectively disprove Nelson's contention that the plays were performed indoors during Elizabeth's reign (see The Medieval English Stage [Chicago, 1974], pp. 154-69, esp. 159-62 [hereafter cited as MES]). 47/City Council Minutes, A/F/3, fol. 25r.

The minutes were later corrected to read that the plays were "meet to be plaid and to begyn sonday after midsummer day next 1575." An inserted stanza at the end of the cappers' play (lines 448-51) indicates that the cycle stopped after play 5 that year rather than after play 9 as was the usual practice. 48/According to Aldersay's List of Mayors (BM Harl 2133, fol. 43v; BM Add 29780, fol. 131r), "The whitson playes were plaid at Midsoummer, and then but some of them leauinge others vnplaid which were thought might not be lustified for the superstition that was in them." Some guildsmen apparently objected to paying their assessments: Andrew Taillir was imprisoned (M/B/12, fol. 187v; Morris, pp. 304-5); Roger Framwall still owed the guild "iijs iijd" "for the pleayse" when the painters ended their accounting year (Printers' Accounts, fol. 60r); and six smiths, who each owed fifteenpence "for the please," did not pay their assessment until 1576-77 (BM Harl 2054, fols. 21r-21v). The terminology of the latter entry indicates that these payments were for the city's cycle of "please" and not for an indoor performance of the smiths' "play" as Nelson, p. 162, has argued. "Superstition" was not the only objection some citizens made against the performance; according to a note made by Randle Holmes II, the Whitsun plays were played "at midsomer to the great dislike of many because the playe was in on part of the Citty" (BM Harl 2125, fol. 40v). The first two viewing sites were normally</page><page sequence="17">Clopper/History and Development of the Chester Cycle 235 the archbishop's intentions; he would not allow performance even of an amended text because he was opposed, according to one witness, to the cycle's association with Catholicism: This year the said Sir Iohn Sauage caused the popish plaies of Chester to bee playd the Sunday Munday Tuesday and Wensday after Midsummer day in contempt of and Inhibition and the primates letters from yorke and from the Earle of Huntington, for which cause hee was serued by a purseuant from yorke, the same day that the new Maior was elected, as they came out of the common hall, notwithstanding the said Sir Iohn Sauage tooke his way towards London, but how his matter sped is not knowne. Also Master Hanky was serued by the same Purseuant for the like contempt when hee was Maior, diuers others of the Citizens and players were troubled for the same matter. [BM Harl 1046, fol. 164v] Sir John wrote from London requesting the council to verify that the performance had taken place with the consent of the city's governing body.49 After the city had discussed the matter, they sent a certificate clearing both Sir John and John Hankey. There is no record of Sir John's appearance before the Privy Council; perhaps official charges were never brought, and the unofficial inquiry dropped upon receipt of the certificate. He returned to Chester and took up his civic and military obligations again, so we can assume no punishment was meted out to him.50 Despite the absolution of the city authorities, however, it was quite clear there were to be no more plays, and, indeed, there were none. The four extant copies of the Late Banns are the documents essential to any analysis of the cycle's content during the period 1548-75; however, before we can assess their value, we must determine the date and stages of their composition.51 David Rogers's versions include a history of the plays (lines 1-63), a description of each guild's pageant (lines 64-186), a short concluding prayer (lines 187-90), and a "Conclusion of the Banes" (lines 191-214). George Bellin's copy omits the "Conclusion" altogether, and William Bedford's copy lacks the first seventy lines-it begins with the description of the drapers' pageant-and includes only the first six lines of the "Conclusion." the Abbey Gates and the Pentice at High Cross, where the mayor and council watched; since the Midsummer Fair was held outside the Abbey Gates, it is likely that the "on" place at which the plays were performed in 1575 was the Pentice. The Dean and Chapter, significantly, made no provision for a mansion over the gates and did not provide the players with beer. Nelson's alternative explanation (pp. 164-65) that only the procession went and that it marched in "Eastgate and Northgate Streets, and not in Watergate or Bridgegate Streets," overlooks the presence of the fair in Northgate Street and assumes that there were no longer outdoor per- formances. 49/Savage's Letter: CHB/3, fol. 28r (Morris, p. 319); the City Certificate: Assembly Book, Ch Arch, AB/1, fols. 165v-66r, and CHB/3, fol. 28v (Morris, pp. 319-22). 50/On November 10, 1577, Sir John sent a Certificate of Musters for Leicestershire to the Earl of Leicester (Calendar of State Papers: Domestic [London, 1856], 1:565). 51/Two were transcribed for David Rogers's Brevaryes in 1609 and 1619 (Ch Arch, Unnumbered MS, fols. 18v-21v; BM Harl 1944, fols. 22r-25r); George Bellin's version precedes his 1600 copy of the plays (BM Harl 2013), and William Bedford's his 1604 copy of the plays (Bodley 175). The version in the Huntington Library MS 2, formerly Devonshire, is ignored here because it is a nineteenth-century copy made from BM Harl 2013. Greg, Trial, pp. 147-60, printed the version in BM Harl 1944; Salter, "Banns," 16:142-48, printed the Huntington version.</page><page sequence="18">236 Modern Philology (February 1978) The Late Banns, like the Early ones, show signs of revision and multiple authorship. There are two basic stanzas: a four-line stanza (A) rhyming abab and a rhyme royal stanza (B).52 The longer stanza is used throughout the introductory material, in describing seven of the pageants and in the "Conclusion"; however, the absence of all or part of the "Conclusion" in Bodley 175 and Harley 2013 suggests that a Continuator (C), who may not be identical with the B-poet, wrote the rhyme-royal stanzas in the "Conclusion" or that he is identical but added the conclusion at a later date or for a special purpose.53 Whereas A must have written the original version after it became apparent that the Early Banns needed thorough revision, writers B and C probably made their revisions when the plays came under renewed attack in Elizabeth's reign. We should not assume, therefore, that the different versions of the Late Banns represent the inaccurate and incomplete transmission of a single document; rather, we should allow the possibility that the Rogers, Bellin, and Bedford copies represent the cycle at, perhaps, three different times or for three different occasions and that the original Late Banns (A), now lost, represented the cycle at a fourth time. The work of writer A is simply descriptive but that of B and C is apologetic. In the prologue, reviser B outlines the origin of the plays, much as the Newhall Proclamation had done, and then apologizes for the performers, the production, and the mixing in of unwarranted material. Most of the rhyme-royal stanzas in the lists of pageants seem to be made up of four lines of description-perhaps the original cross-rhyme stanza-and three lines justifying the retention of the pageant. For example, the reviser seeks to excuse the "Author's" Interminglinge therewithe onely to make sporte Some thinges not warranted by any wrytte Which glad the hartes he woulde men to take hit. [Brevaryes, lines 11-13] The passage has been interpreted as a condemnation of the mingling of comedy with the serious matter of religious drama; however, a later comment on the Nativity indicates that the objection was to the inclusion of legendary or non- canonical material: The birth of Christe shall all see in that stage In the scriptures a warraunte. not of the midwiues reporte The author tellethe his author. then take hit in sporte. Related comments imply that the reviser of the Banns examined other plays for similar intrusions: he says that the tanners' play has been checked and allowed to proceed, that the Shepherds contains few true words "ffor all that the author had to stande vppon" was the Gloria, and that the cooks' play contains unsubstantiated information about the events in Hell during the Harrowing. 52/Unlike the linked four-line units of the Early Banns' rime coude stanza, those of the Late Banns are discrete units; it is simple, therefore, to construct a rhyme-royal or B-stanza out of an A- stanza. This eventuality makes it impossible to establish whether the presence of a rhyme-royal stanza indicates that a play has been added to the cycle or whether the B-reviser has added a tercet to an A-stanza. 53/The "Conclusion" consists of twenty lines of which there are two regular rhyme-royal stanzas and one defective one of six lines.</page><page sequence="19">Clopper/History and Development of the Chester Cycle 237 The rationale for the comments on the barbers', bakers', coopers-ironmon- gers', dyers', and weavers' plays is less obvious. The three lines added to the barbers' entry describe the Melchisedeck episode and raise the possibility that this is a late addition to the cycle or that it called for some defense because of the Catholic interpretation of Salem's king as the prototype of the priest. The poet seems to be groping for a comment on the bakers' Last Supper; perhaps the comment indicates the reentry of the play into the cycle, or it may arise from some nervousness about the exposition on the Last Supper. The coopers' and iron- mongers' entry has been badly rewritten; there is a four-line addition at the end- perhaps made of three garbled lines-and a line at the beginning which does not rhyme with any of the ones which follow. The original rhyme scheme seems to have been abab, now xbab, to which was added bcc, now bcxc.54 The lack of rhyme in the first line suggests that the coopers' and ironmongers' plays were associated in some way subsequent to the composition of the A-version of the Banns but certainly by the time of the B-revisions.55 The final three lines of the dyers' entry give the Antichrist a possibly anti-Catholic orientation. The descrip- tion of the weavers' pageant has a concluding prayer asking that all who view it may be gathered to heaven as are the good souls at Doomsday; the extra lines, 54/Salter, "Banns," 15:438-39, observes that the last two lines should be written as one in order to preserve the rhyme and the stanza; however, this will create an incrdinately long line and obscure the fact that the lines are somehow corrupt. 55/The issue of the relationship between the bowers' and coopers' Flagellation and the iron- mongers' Crucifixion may never be resolved unless we find some additional evidence; on the other hand, it may have been unnecessarily complicated by the assumptions that scholars have made about the play manuscript H (here and elsewhere I use Lumiansky and Mills's designa- tions for the five play manuscripts, HmABRH; see their Chester Mystery Cycle, EETS, S.S. 3 [London, 1974], p. ix). If, as Lumiansky and Mills suggest in their introductory notes (p. xxvii), the H manuscript is a presentation rather than an acting copy, the two plays may never have been amalgamated in the sense that we have used that term to date; i.e., the guilds may not have had one seamless text, yet they still may have shared the costs of the plays. One can see that these companies had a close association as early as 1422 and that in :hat year there was some confusion over their responsibilities in the Corpus Christi play. How could this confusion arise ? It is easier to understand if one realizes that the conditions of performance of the Corpus Christi play were different from those of the Whitsun plays, for the former was acted in one place and thus the distinction between the two segments of the Passion may not have been as clear as it would have been once the plays were mounted on separate wagons. The Early Banns devoted eight lines to the two groups' plays, but the quatrains are not separated as they are with other guilds; nonetheless, the eight lines are not a stanza but half-stanzas of those which precede and follow the section, and the two guilds are mentioned in separate parts of the section. This fusion, however minor, might suggest that the two groups had a closer relationship than that of other companies. The Late Banns clearly join the companies together, and the extant texts (MSS HmARB) number both plays as 16. All of the evidence suggests that the bowers and coopers and the ironmongers remained separate companies and even, perhaps, retained separate texts of their portions of the play-as they must have done in 1422-but that they cooperated in the performance of the Passion. Indeed, the extant texts support this interpreta- tion. The Lists of Companies always distinguish the two companies and call the first play the Scourging and the second the Crucifixion; nonetheless, the texts describe the coopers' play as the Passion and the group MSS HmABR note at the end of play 16 that "This storye is finished in the leaves followinge" (MS Hm). Even though the ironmongers' play is entitled the Cruci- fixion, it is clear that the scribes believed the two sections to be one story; therefore, it is reason- able to assume that from 1422 until the final performance in 1575 the two groups of companies retained separate identities and separate texts but cooperated in one long play called the Passion. Since the cooper's records do not contain enough payments to actors to fill the roles in their part of the play, the two companies may have shared actors who performed in both sections of the Passion (see Clopper, "Rogers' Description," p. 80).</page><page sequence="20">238 Modern Philology (February 1978) however, could be a rounding off of the final entry rather than an editorial comment like those above. An alternative explanation for the revision of the last few entries is that the B-poet recomposed them after the Assumption was dropped from the cycle. The entry for the shearmen's play contains only three lines; a line may have been omitted in all copies of the Banns but it is possible that the three lines form a seven-line stanza with the preceding fishmongers' entry. If this is the case, reviser B may have rewritten the entire section (lines 166-86) to smooth over the deleted Catholic Assumption and to give the Antichrist a Protestant orientation. The work of revisers B and C must have been completed before the 1575 performance. Salter argued that the Late Banns were written for the final per- formance in 1575 on the grounds that the Banns combined the descriptions of the coopers' and ironmongers' plays of the Scourging and Crucifixion, a fusion which Salter believed represented the amalgamated text preserved in the H MS.56 Since the introductory material and the four-line stanza at the conclusion indicate that the Banns were revised for performances which were to take place at Whit- suntide, whereas the 1575 performance occurred at Midsummer, then they must have been written for a performance in 1572 or earlier. The "Conclusion" may have been written to offset objections from civic officials who were opposed to the late performances. The poet, conscious of antagonism toward the plays, seeks not only to excuse their crudity but also to counter objections to the anthropomorphic representation of God.57 Moreover, he invites those who might be offended to leave: And if anye disdayne then open is the doore That lett hime into heare.... [Brevaryes, lines 207-8] 56/Salter, "Banns," 15:444-49; Greg, Trial, pp. 25-28. Salter assumed that the plays were amal- gamated in 1575 because there was no account of expenditure for the coopers in 1575; however, he misunderstood the coopers' method of dating their accounts (see my article in Theatre Survey, pp. 50-52). Greg, Trial, p. 81, n. 1, challenged Salter's assertion by pointing out that the Late Banns envisioned a Whitsuntide, not a Midsummer, performance (see also Nelson, pp. 161-62); therefore, if there were an amalgamation, it had to have occurred whenever the Late Banns were written. Salter countered that the Banns' author could not have known that he was writing the Banns for the last performance or that it would be shifted to Midsummer; however, his argument is untenable because it assumes that their author wrote the Banns before the decision to perform the plays was made, a decision that was not made until two weeks after Whitsuntide. 57/ Of one thinge warne you now I shall That not possible it is these matters to be contryued In such sorte and cunninge &amp; by suche players of price As at this daye good players &amp; fine wittes coulde deuise ffor then shoulde all those persones that as godes doe playe In Clowdes come downe with voyce and not be seene ffor noe man can proportion that godhead I saye To the shape of man face. nose and eyne But sethence the face gilte doth disfigure the man that deme A Clowdye couering of the man. a Voyce onlye to heare And not god in shape or person to appeare. [Lines 193-203] This Theseus-like criticism of Chester's rude mechanicals does not distinguish itself by the quality of its verse; nevertheless, the objection is apparently to the anthropomorphic represen- tation of God the Father-and perhaps of Christ at the Last Judgment-for the companies continued to gild Christ's face in those plays which dramatized his earthly presence.</page><page sequence="21">Clopper/History and Development of the Chester Cycle 239 This reference constitutes Nelson's primary piece of evidence for indoor perfor- mances; on the basis of it, he dates the composition of the Late Banns to the early 1560s when, according to his argument, the plays first began to be performed indoors.58 To the contrary, the Treasurer's Accounts of the Dean and Chap- ter of the Cathedral prove that there were performances before the clergy outside Abbey Gates in 1568 and 1572; consequently, Nelson's rationale for the 1560 date is vitiated. If the plays were not performed indoors in 1572 or earlier, and if they were staged in at least one place outdoors in 1575, then either they were produced indoors sometime after 1575 or the reference must have some meaning other than that attributed to it heretofore. Salter argued that it was David Rogers who added the continuation for a proposed revival; but if David were so antago- nistic to the plays, a point Salter argues elsewhere, then it is hardly likely that he composed verses for a revival.59 There is, in fact, evidence neither that the plays were ever revived nor that there was an attempted revival between 1575 and 1609, the year that David Rogers copied the Banns.6o It seems reasonable to assume, therefore, that the "Conclusion" must have been composed for some other purpose. I think that this version of the Banns was read in camera before the mayor and the city council in order to counteract antagonism to the performance. We know that twelve of the aldermen voted against the 1575 performance and it 58/Nelson, pp. 161-62. His other two pieces of evidence depend upon a misreading of the Webster case and a mistranscription from the smiths' accounts. On p. 162 Nelson states that the "Smiths' play was performed indoors on at least one occasion after the lapse of the cycle in 1575. In 1576 the Smiths gathered money 'for the please,' and then paid 16d 'an ouer plas at Alderman Mounforts on midsomer eve."' Nelson's transcription is indebted to Morris (p. 322, n. 1) who, under the date 1576, records the payment "on our plas." However, the account, for 1576-77 rather than 1576, actually says that they "payd an ouerplus," that is, that the guild spent more money than they had collected for drink. The money for the "please"-not the "plas"-was probably for assessments which had not been paid in 1575 (see n. 47 above); furthermore, if it were money for a performance, it would read "payd for" or "spent on," not "payd an." The terms of the Webster case are similarly obscured. Nelson argues that Whitmore sued Webster, the tenant of Ireland, to keep Webster from having the plays performed in his house; however, the case is not simply between Whitmore and Webster but between Whitmore, Webster, and the other tenants of Ireland. If Webster were sponsoring the plays in Whitmore's residence, he would not have sued Ireland's other tenants as well. Moreover, we should note the unresolved settlement: Webster is sustained because she had the "mansion" for the plays in the recent past; however, if it is determined that Whitmore's claim is better, then Webster is to pay him compensation. This resolution indicates that the controversy is not over whether Webster is to be allowed to have the plays performed in a house she is renting, but over whether Whitmore has a better claim to use the mansion to see the plays. If Whitmore's claim is substantiated, Webster is to compensate him for occupying the place rightfully belonging to Whitmore. Whitmore certainly had a claim; he was a landholder in Bridgestreet-his property was within a block of Bridgegate (BM Harl 2054, fol. 83r)-whereas Mistress Webster lived in St. Peter's parish, north of Eastgate and Watergate Streets (M/B/19, fol. 81r). Last, it seems contradictory to claim, as Nelson does, that Whitmore, a Catholic (p. 162), objected to the plays in 1568 and then to cite documents (pp. 162-63) from 1572 and 1575 that demonstrate that the plays folded because the Protestants regarded them as popish plays; indeed, Whitmore's Catholicism would seem to undermine totally Nelson's contention that he brought the case against Webster because he did not want the plays to be performed. 59/Salter, "Banns," 15:444; yet on pp. 433-34 he doubts that such a performance could have occurred during Hardware's mayoralty in 1600. On David Rogers's supposed authorship of the "Conclusion," see Nelson, p. 161, and Clopper, "Rogers' Description," pp. 71-73. 60/The tradition that the plays were revived, or were to be revived, in 1600 has not been accepted by modern critics (see Salter, MDC, p. 46; A. C. Baugh et al., A Literary History of England, 2d ed. [New York, 1967], 1:278, 282).</page><page sequence="22">240 Modern Philology (February 1978) is probable that others objected in 1572; indeed, they may have been the ones who made the complaint to the archbishop which resulted in the attempt to halt the plays. We also know that the mayor and aldermen used to watch the plays from the Pentice at High Cross."6 The "Conclusion," therefore, may have been intended to quash criticism by asking those who found the plays objectionable to leave the Outer Pentice. Perhaps the "Conclusion" was written specifically for the 1572 performance, but, without additional evidence, we can only observe that the "Conclusion," as well as the B-revisions, must have been written no later than 1572. Neither the terminus a quo of the B-revisions nor that of the original version (A) can be established with certainty because the crucial piece of evidence, the description of the bakers' pageant, is open to several interpretations. Since the rhyme scheme of the first four lines of the reviser's stanza is identical to the A-stanza, it is impossible to substantiate that the B-reviser wrote all seven lines; instead, he may have added three lines to the original four-line description. There is no way of determining, therefore, whether the rhyme-royal stanza devoted to the bakers' play indicates that the B-poet revised the Banns when the bakers' play reentered the cycle-possibly as late as 1561-or whether the reviser added three lines when the plays came under increased opposition in the last years of produc- tion. If the shoemakers continued to perform the 1550 version of their play until 1561, then the revisions of the Late Banns may not have been made before 1561. The original version of the Late Banns could have been composed for the 1550 performance; but, in any event, the A-version must have been composed sometime after the suppressions of 1548 which made the Early Banns obsolete. The compo- sition of the original version may be placed in the period 1548-61, but may have been as late as 1561 if the A-poet composed the description of the bakers' play; the revisions may have been made as late as 1572, or as early as 1561, if the B- reviser wrote the entire bakers' entry. We might reconstruct the writing of the Late Banns as follows. Though the plays had never been totally suppressed during the reigns of Henry and Edward, there had been a number of alterations in the cycle, including the deletion of the bakers' Last Supper. During the period 1548-61 composer A wrote the Late Banns in an abab stanza; in 1561, but certainly by 1572, the B-reviser provided a "history" of the cycle's antiquity and excused the mode of representation and the inclusion of questionable material. In response to hostility within the council, perhaps in 1572, the Continuator (C) added the final lines for a version of the Banns which were to be read before the mayor and council. 61/David Rogers says that a "pagiante was played at the Abbaye gates then it was wheled from thense to pentice at the highe crosse before the maior ... ." There might be some question whether the mayor and council could view the plays from their meeting room except for an early seventeenth-century record which indicates that there was an inner pentice (the meeting chamber) and an outer pentice (a porch?). On October 2, 1620, during the annual bullbaiting "for master mayors farewell," a fracas broke out between the butchers and the bakers which necessitated the intervention of the mayor: "master mayor beinge in the vtter pentise came hym selfe in person Amonge them: but the lyttell regardinge hym in theire Rage. master mayor broke his staffe. the Cryer hys mace / and after the offendors were Commytted to prison" (BM Add 29779, fol. 39r [my emphasis]).</page><page sequence="23">Clopper/History and Development of the Chester Cycle 241 Neither the Early Banns, nor the List of Companies, nor the Late Banns describe the cycle as it exists in our texts; consequently, the texts may include late additions to the cycle or be copies of registers from which plays were selected for performance. The list is the only document to include references to Moses and the "woman of Canan," and it describes the shearmen's play as the Prophets of Doomsday, a more accurate title for the play than the Prophets of Antichrist. The Late Banns are the first to mention Cain and Abel, Melchisedeck, the Mid- wives, the Doctors, and Enoch and Eli; neither of the Banns refers to the Moses episode or the Procession of Prophets in the H MS of the cappers' play, the Woman Taken in Adultery, or the Caecus episode in the glovers' play.62 Some of the descriptions are general: the corvisers' pageant is called the Jerusalem Carriage, and we cannot be sure, particularly since there is an intervening version, how much of the extant play was included in a performance. Other descriptions indicate revisions in the cycle. Both the Early and Late Banns assert that Octavian is a cruel tyrant; to the contrary, in the extant Nativity he refuses emperor wor- ship (6.313-36) and prostrates himself before an image of the child (651-74). The description of the saddlers' play recalls an incident that is not included in the Emaus pageant: there are no scenes which dramatize the events described in the Banns as Christ's "often speeche to the woman [women MSS BR] &amp; his desiples Deere"; if Mary Magdalene and the other Marys are the women involved, the reference may be to scenes which now appear at the end of the skinners' Resurrection in MSS RH but not in HmAB.63 Last, the Late Banns say that the hewsters will bring out Antichrist "ffirste with his Doctor that godlye maye expownde / Whoe be Antechristes..."; however, there is no such scene in the extant play. Since the Late Banns were written before but not used for the 1575 performance, it is possible that the 1575 skinners', saddlers', and hewsters' pageants were different from those described in the Late Banns and that they are the ones preserved in MSS HmAB. We cannot be absolutely certain, of course, that the Banns ever noted each incident dramatized in any given text; however, the absence of full descriptions implies that the cycle in performance may have differed from the texts we have. According to the Early Banns the guilds had assigned parts in the cycle "Prouided Alwais that it [was] at the libertie and pleasure of the mair with the counsell of his bretheryn to Alter or Assigne any of the occupacions ... to any play or pagent as they shall think necessary or conuenyent." Both the discrepancy between the description of the saddlers' play and the extant text and the textual variants in the skinners' Resurrection suggest that this practice was continued. Further- more, the omissions from the Late Banns of episodes preserved in the texts may indicate that the "Regenall" was a master text which included more scenes than were normally performed. The Late Banns may, therefore, be a record of the cycle as it was usually performed or as it was performed at the time of the revisions made by the B-poet. Not only is there evidence that the cycle continued to be revised, but there 62/There are two versions of the cappers' play; however, it is difficult to establish the priority of one over the other. 63/Lumiansky and Mills, pp. 486-90.</page><page sequence="24">242 Modern Philology (February 1978) is also documentation that the "Regenall" was rewritten or recopied several times in the final years of dramatic activity. Guilds continued to return to the "Regenall" to copy their plays: in 1564 the shoemakers spent three shillings and fourpence "ffor the copynge out of the oregenall" (Shoemakers' Account Book, fol. D10r); in 1556 the smiths paid twopence "for the Reggenall" and in 1561 they paid fivepence "for paper to Coppy out the parcells of the booke" (BM Harl 2054, fol. 16v). If these guilds had such often recourse to the "Regenall" during these few years, then we might suppose that other guilds for which we have no records did likewise; moreover, the continuous usage of the "Regenall" may account for its disappearance in 1568. In April of that year Randall Trever was called before the mayor to answer charges that he had taken but not returned the "originall book of the whydson plaies." 64 It is not clear why Trever had the book or what happened to it; its loss, however, occasioned the making of a new copy for which the smiths and painters each gave twelvepence, respectively, "to master mere to wards the makinge of a new booke" and "for Coppyng of oure orygenall." If each guild kept a copy of its play, then it would have been easy to reconstruct the city's copy of the "Regenall" from the guild copies.65 The only purpose of the "Regenall" would seem to have been to preserve the individual texts against loss and to serve as a safeguard against unauthorized revisions as well as, in later years, against unorthodox religious opinion. The frequent consultation with the "Regenall" and the return to it to copy out parcels suggests, however, that the guilds could not be assured that their text would remain the same from year to year. Indeed, the smiths, in 1572, again paid "for parchment to make a new orriginall booke" (BM Harl 2054, fol. 19v); consequently, we know that the original kept by the city was "recompiled" in both 1568 and 1572. In 1575, furthermore, we know that the smiths had two plays which they tried out "before the Aldermen to take the best" (ibid., fol. 20v), and we know that the council had agreed that year to allow the mayor to make whatever amendments he deemed necessary. Whatever inferences are to be drawn from an examination of the Late Banns and these charges for the "Regenall," there is ample evidence to demonstrate that the plays were being revised and rewritten up to the time of their suppression. The Chester plays, we must conclude, are medieval only in conception and perhaps in representation, not in date of composition (see the summary in table 2). Much of the history and development of the Chester cycle is probably not radically different from that of other northern cycles: the plays may have been established at the end of the fourteenth century when there was a single perfor- mance at the end of the Corpus Christi procession; the cycle was apparently expanded during the early sixteenth century; and the city attempted to preserve 64/M/B/19, fol. 45v (Morris, p. 315). Salter, MDC, pp. 50-51 discusses the case. 65/Trever's forgetfulness remains puzzling. It seems unlikely that he would have deliberately stolen the book and perjured himself if the book could be so easily reconstructed. One might suppose that he had borrowed the book a long time before the demand for its return except that we know that the plays were performed in 1567 and the city, presumably, had its copy then. It seems too rash to conclude, as Salter did, that Trever appointed himself the executioner of the city's plays, so we must assume that he returned the text, as he testified, and that it was subsequently misplaced.</page><page sequence="25">Clopper/History and Development of the Chester Cycle 243 TABLE 2 A SUMMARY CHART OF THE CYCLE'S HISTORY AND DEVELOPMENT Year Guild Play Period 1: Corpus Christi Passion Play: 1422-74 1422 ...................

The Chester cycle may have differed from some of the others insofar as it may have originally been a Passion play; but it certainly differed from the York, Wakefield, and Coventry plays in that it was performed at Whitsuntide over a three-day period and in that the city officials attempted to continue the perfor- mances even after the Archbishop of York had specifically forbidden them. The shift from Corpus Christi day to Whitsuntide, however, was the most remarkable change in the cycle's history, particularly if that shift also occasioned or coincided with the use of movable stages and the expansion of the cycle over a three-day period.

Why did they decide to perform it over a three-day period? Why did they perform their plays on moving wagons and thus create technical problems which would not exist with fixed stages ? No doubt we could argue that Chester expanded its cycle of plays to the greater glory of God; however, the performance at St. John's could have satisfied this desire reasonably enough. Similarly un- tenable is the argument that the plays were placed on movable stages and per- formed around the city in order to accommodate the larger audiences of later years. If the city desired space larger than that at St. John's, all they had to do was to move to the Roodeye outside Watergate.66 The key to the alterations must lie in the producers, the guilds. The shift to Whitsuntide and the subsequent alteration in the procession route may have arisen from the city's desire to separate its play from the ecclesiastical auspices of the Corpus Christi celebrations in order to emphasize civic sponsorship. I do not mean to suggest that there was some kind of "secularization" occurring; from our earliest record we see that the city has primary control over the guild play, yet as late as 1572 we see that the play is performed first before the clergy at Abbey Gates. Therefore, the city and the church were both involved with the play from its inception until 1572, when the archbishop of York forbade the per- formance. Nevertheless, the guild authorities, who were responsible for the costs of the plays, may have wished to escape being overshadowed by the clergy and the Corpus Christi festival and thus may have encouraged the move to Whitsuntide and the separation of the ecclesiastical and civic viewing sites at Abbey Gates and the Pentice, respectively. The desire to avoid being overshadowed by the clergy might have occasioned many of these changes; however, it, too, does not seem a sufficient cause in itself, for the guilds could have found some other way to emphasize their responsibility. A more substantial motivation may have come out of the relationship which existed between the guilds and the city. The guild mercatory was associated with the granting of important freedoms to the city; the production of the plays, therefore, celebrated the prestige of the city and the guild government and probably accounted for the insistence that the plays were devised by the supposed first mayor, John Arnewaye. Further, the display of civic pride brought material rewards. Whenever there was a play, there was a great influx of visitors to the city. At some point the council must have realized that they could increase the number of visitors to their city if they did not perform their cycle on the same day that the famous play of Coventry took place."7 Furthermore, they must have 66/The city did perform plays on the Roodeye: in 1564 the "historie of Aeneas and queene Dido" was performed there, and in 1577-78 the "sheppards play was plaied at the high Crosse and other Tryumphs on the Roods eye" (BM Harl 2133, fols. 42v, 44r). 67/Even royalty had come to Coventry to see the plays in 1484, 1486, 1492, and 1511, and in 1519 or 1520 "new playes at Corpus Christityd" were performed (see Hardin Craig, ed., Two Coventry Corpus Christi Plays, 2d ed., EETS E.S. 27 [London, 1957], pp. xx-xxi). The last royal visit and the production of the new plays coincide with one of Thomas Smith's terms of office in Chester; and, since he was also mayor when the pewterers-founders' agreement was made, the Sheriffs' Breakfast Shoot was originated, the cappers' play was commissioned, and the painters' play was performed, he may have been the one who initiated the move from Corpus Christi to Whitsuntide.</page><page sequence="28">246 Modern Philology (February 1978) desired to rival Coventry-and other cities-in spectacle, in mechanical contriv- ances, in sheer theatricality. Plays had been performed on fixed stages; the spec- tacle could be increased by mounting sets on more confined, movable stages. Indeed, part of the theatrical effect at Chester must have come from the fact that great feats were performed on small movable pageants. If Chester wished to celebrate their special status as a Palatinate, if they wished to compete with Coventry and to draw large crowds, then it was important that they find a different day for their production, hence the shift from Corpus Christi day to Whitsuntide; and they may have decided to extend the period of production in order to benefit from the commerce during the three-day period. Finally, they may have decided to place the plays on wagons not to increase the size of the audience's viewing area-they could have remained at St. John's or moved to the Roodeye-but because performances on moving stages were more spectacular than performances in one place.
