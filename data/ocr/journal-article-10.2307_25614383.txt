<plain_text><page sequence="1">[ PMLA War and Representation FREDRIC JAMESON FREDRIC JAMESON, professor of French and comparative literature at Duke Uni versity, is the author of three forthcom ing books: Valences of the Dialectic, The Hegel Variations, and Representing Capi tal Volume One. A vast entity, a planet, in a space of a hundred million dimensions; three dimensional beings could not so much as imagine it. And yet each dimen sion was an autonomous consciousness. Try to look directly at that planet, it would disintegrate into tiny fragments, and nothing but consciousnesses would be left. A hundred million free consciousnesses, each aware of walls, the glowing stump of a cigar, familiar faces, and each constructing its destiny on its own responsibility. And yet each of those consciousnesses, by imper ceptible contacts and insensible changes, realizes its existence as a cell in a gigantic and invisible coral (polyp). War: everyone is free, and yet the die is cast. It is there, it is everywhere, it is the totality of all my thoughts, of all Hitlers words, of all Gomez's acts; but no one is there to add it up. It exists solely for God. But God does not exist. And yet war exists. ?Sartre, The Reprieve Stalingrad is like a painting that cannot be observed from close up, but from which one must step back in order to do it full justice. ?Joseph Goebbels WAR OFFERS THE PARADIGM OF THE NOMINALIST DILEMMA: THE abstraction from totality or the here and now of sensory im mediacy and confusion. For Tolstoy, as for almost everybody else, the representational consequence was most memorably drawn by Stendhal in The Charterhouse of Parma: Fabrice unaware that he is an involuntary witness to the emperors last stand ("fm off to the Battle of Waterloo" would be a modernist replay of the exit line Walter Ben jamin claimed to have found in one of his baroque tragedies: Tm off to the Thirty Years' War"). Yet in both novelists the aesthetic is already 1532 l ? 2009 BY THE MODERN LANGUAGE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA j</page><page sequence="2">1 2 4 5 ] Fredric Jameson 1533 one of what the formalists called ostranenie, or defamiliarization (estrangement), in which a stereotype is dismantled and brought before us in all its nameless freshness and horror. Whether this is an essentially modernist op eration or, on the contrary, something all the realisms are by definition called on to do is a question we will for the moment leave open. Still, it suggests that there exists some stereotype of war for such passages to defa miliarize and that there must then also be representations of war that are content to con firm the stereotype. Indeed, one often has the feeling that all war novels (and war films) are pretty much the same and have few enough surprises for us, even though their situations may vary. In practice, we can enumerate some seven or eight situations, which more or less exhaust the genre. If so, and despite experience that confirms this opinion, this would be an astonishing fact, given the radi cal changes in warfare historians document since the hand-to-hand combat in the plains before Troy (Hegel's prototype of that human and unalienated form, the epic, as opposed to the modern "prose of the world," denatured by money, commerce, and industry): there is then, marked by technological advances (gun powder, machine guns and tanks, aircraft, unmanned cybernetic weaponry), a whole pe riodization of structural changes in warfare and its accompanying strategies that needs to be combined with the narrative typologies we are about to enumerate and to examine in more detail. Add to this complication a pe riodization of properly aesthetic modes and transformations (allegory, realism, modern ism, postmodernism), and we confront a combination scheme of no little complexity that may strike us ultimately as serving less to explain these representations than simply to classify them. But perhaps such possibili ties, which account for the organization of the notes that follow into a sampling of exhibits rather than a unified and systematic theory, may be reduced and simplified by the rather different consideration cutting across all of them?namely, the suspicion that war is ulti mately unrepresentable?and by an attention to the various forms the impossible attempt to represent it may have taken. As for the narrative variants, which seem to me to hold for film as much as for the novel, I enumerate eight of them: (1) the ex istential experience of war, (2) the collective experience of war, (3) leaders, officers, and the institution of the army, (4) technology, (5) the enemy landscape, (6) atrocities, (7) attack on the homeland, and (8) foreign occupa tion. The final category does not include the related subject matter of spies and espionage (now largely settled into a generic category of its own); nor does it exhaust the phenomenon of guerrilla warfare, from the current United States occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan all the way back to the Vendee and indeed to the earliest institutionalization of armies: for guerrilla warfare?the result of uneven development and of the incursion of an "ad vanced" mode of production into an "under developed" one?can also offer the prototype of war itself and not its savage exception. Yet these very exclusions suggest a different way of cutting across the plot types, for the typical events of foreign occupation (and of espionage, for that matter) take us back to in stitutions and to the state as actor and agency, while the horror of guerrilla warfare (whether urban or rural) seems rather to lie in the un identifiability of its actors, who emerge from their surroundings without warning and just as unexpectedly disappear again. What may prove most helpful here, then, is Kenneth Burke's "dramatistic pentad," which differentiates between act, agent, agency, purpose, and scene as so many distinct media through which the narrative material can be focused. To use a more structural terminol ogy, we may say that each of Burkes catego ries constitutes a different kind of dominant and thereby produces a somewhat different projection of the material, it being understood</page><page sequence="3">1534 War and Representation | PMLA that there is no correct or true, photographi cally accurate rendering of such multidimen sional realities. Still, narrative semiotics, by identifying Burkes first three categories with one another?an act always somehow imply ing an agent and the agent in turn implying an agency?suggests a different ordering of these perspectives, in which purpose some how withdraws (as a feature of interpretation rather than of representation), while scene emerges as a new element in its own right: in scene, the anthropomorphic is eclipsed and some new and as yet unrecognizable narra tive reality comes into view. For the act and its accompanying actantial categories always presuppose a name, and thereby a preexisting concept of the event identified (as already with the word war), while action and agency seem to be determined in advance by this or that in stitutionalized and organized agent. Scene, however, remains unnamed at this level of narrative complexity, becoming con crete in the course of the representation. Spati ality is only one possible dimension of scene, to which anthropomorphic elements are subordi nated in unaccustomed and estranged ways. Technology, meanwhile, as alienated and reified human labor and energy, is always a slippery category, moving back and forth be tween allegory and external (or proto-natural) doom yet sometimes also celebrated as the triumph of human inventiveness and an ex pression of human action (or its prosthetic ex tension). It wanders across all our tale types, sometimes organizing their periodization (as I suggest above), sometimes generating a uniquely nightmarish experience, as in the terror and panic aroused by the appearance of the first tanks at the Battle of the Somme in World War I or by the V-2 rockets in that war's sequel. Yet technology is truly the apotheosis of a properly modernist teleology, a direct line from the slingshot to the megaton bomb, as Theodor W. Adorno put it. Each innovation is also the same in its embodiment of radical dif ference: witness Ermanno Olmis wonderful film 77 mestiere delle armi (2001), on the devel opment of artillery in the sixteenth century. The first category of war narrative, that of the existential experience of war?which has its classical literary realization in Stephen Cranes Red Badge of Courage (1895)?most often expresses the fear of death and, a some what different thing, death anxiety: as such, although this category is surely the quintes sential form the representation of war takes in most peoples minds, its content (personal danger, decisions and hesitations, contin gency, apprenticeship) can be transferred to other generic frameworks. War then becomes the laboratory in which, like the bullring for Ernest Hemingway, such experiences are most unfailingly aroused and observed. Yet it tends toward the bildungsroman to the de gree to which it is generally a question of a young and inexperienced soldier, whom the experience does not leave untouched. With the collective focus, everything changes; yet here also we find ourselves in the presence of a content fully interchangeable with several other familiar and well-defined genres, which call the generic specificity of the war film back into question. For the col lective war story turns on the interaction of various character types apparently gathered at random. The experience is the national one, of universal conscription as the first occasion in which men from different social classes are thrown together, at least until the public high school dramas of more recent memory. In the Europe of emergent nationalism, the experi ence was called on to level the old regional cultures (Sicily, Brittany) and to standardize language and the states claims of authority? to encourage discipline, obedience, and recog nition of the national system. American war films, taking class difference for granted and only gradually absorbing racial difference, found their originality psychologically, in the typology of personalities thrown together in a group (or war machine). The intelligent upper class figure, the sociopath, the weakling, the</page><page sequence="4">12 4-5 ] Fredric Jameson 1535 bully, the fixer, the jokester, the trickster, the Don Juan, the ethnic type (generally southern European; but a black man, a Chicano, or a Native American gradually follows), the reli gious fundamentalist, the nice guy, the nerd: the list is endless, but the combinations?that is to say, the fundamental dramatic conflicts and clashes?are probably statistically limited and certainly generically predictable. The crucial thing about this collective sys tem is that it is itself the abstraction of some thing else. We may focus the action in terms of male bonding or the psychology of hierar chical institutions, with the problem of au thority figures (incompetent, psychotic, etc.) added later on. The first versions of the form emerge in what we may call a prefeminist world, and certainly the absence of women is a significant structural part of the form later women will be admitted as yet another variation on the male character types?but the crucial feature here is the absence of the family and of peacetime, indeed of wage la bor. This is why a juxtaposition with the heist or caper film is so interesting: for in this last we find the same abstract structure, the same variety of character types and their clashes, the same as it were sealed social world, but in which the legitimacy of the institution of the army and the declaration of war has been stripped away, yielding a different kind of defamiliarization, where the overall aim of the collective action is not even war aims (defeating the enemy, defending freedom, or some other such socially plausible motive) but rather simply money itself?the ultimate abstraction, the ultimate "axiomatic" emp tied of concrete content. Yet the absence of wage labor or commodified labor is here re tained; and as in many other kinds of crime films, there is a Utopian overtone in which the characters live in a disalienated world and in which activity is akin to play (I have else where tried to show that these Utopias can be invested with very different valences: for ex ample, the Mafia film quintessentially appeals to nostalgia for the family by way of collective envy of the southern European clan system). Thus, what both war films (of the collec tive buddy type) and caper films abstract from and yet dramatize in their own specific generic ways is the division of labor itself: each of the character types stands for a certain compe tence, something brought out much more strongly in the caper films, where each charac ter is selected for a specific specialty. The small or micro group is the Deleuzian nomadic war machine, literally or figuratively?that is to say, an image of the collective without the state and beyond reified institutions. Still, such "groups-in-fusion," as Jean-Paul Sartre calls them in The Critique of Dialectical Rea son, become forerunners of the institutional as such as they ossify. Indeed, when the peace time army (or indeed the police force, in cur rent procedural) comes into its own mode of representation, it is rather bureaucracy whose epic is sung before us (without being named as such, except in socialist realism), and the col lective structure of the nomads is appropriated for the celebration of the state. Both are after images of the social, and we make a more pro ductive use of Gilles Deleuze when we grasp his dualism as an alternating possibility and realize that libidinal investment in the nomads can be no less reprehensible (but also no more so) than libidinal investment in the state. As for the third category, that of leaders and institutions, it initiates a shift of grav ity toward the exterior of the experience of war, whether individual or collective, for the officers are ordinarily as much a part of the soldier's external environment as the enemy itself; and are indeed equally often objectified into what gets identified as the bureaucracy or the state. Initially, however, such characters furnished the staple of the older chronicle his tory, with its great men and world-historical figures?what Georg Lukacs assigns to the potentialities of the stage, as in Schiller's Wal lenstein, Strindberg's Gustavus Adolfus, or Shakespeare's war-riddled history plays (and</page><page sequence="5">1536 War and Representation | PMLA the shorthand German imitations that come out of them, like Goethes Goetz von Berlich ingen or even dramas of Kleist and Buchner). This is, on one traditional yet rather narrow acceptation of the term, the place of politics as such; and it cannot be doubted that the various populist representations of the sim ple soldier and the common man in uniform are dialectically later than these less and less glorious figures striding about the stage and vocalizing their decisions, with or without a note of human, all-too-human pathos. Tolstoy s notorious loathing for Napoleon is in that sense merely the other face of his hero-worshipping portrayal of the uniquely Russian bluffness and acumen of Kutuzov, a historical figure Tolstoy himself had not many years before this characterized as "sen sual, cunning and unfaithful"?just as he had in earlier times called such patriotism "a fairy tale which aroused national feeling" (Eikhen baum 149,144). Perhaps the classic defamiliar ization of the "great general" comes closer to Tolstoy's representation of "world-historical" decision making and his inveterate resistance to it (a stance to which we owe the concluding "theory of history" in War and Peace): But at that moment an adjutant galloped up with a message from the commander of the regiment in the hollow and news that immense masses of the French were coming down upon them and that his regiment was in disorder and was retreating upon the Kiev grenadiers. Prince Bagration bowed his head in sign of assent and approval. He rode off at a walk to the right and sent an adjutant to the dragoons with orders to attack the French. But this adju tant returned half an hour later with the news that the commander of the dragoons had al ready retreated beyond the dip in the ground, as a heavy fire had been opened on him and he was losing men uselessly, and so had hastened to throw some sharpshooters into the wood. Prince Andrew listened attentively to Bagrations colloquies with the commanding officers and the orders he gave them and, to his surprise, found that no orders were really given, but that Prince Bagration tried to make it appear that everything done by necessity, by accident, or by the will of subordinate commanders was done, if not by his direct command, at least in accord with his inten tions. Prince Andrew noticed, however, that though what happened was due to chance and was independent of the commander's will, owing to the tact Bagration showed, his presence was very valuable. Officers who ap proached him with disturbed countenances became calm; soldiers and officers greeted him gaily, grew more cheerful in his pres ence, and were evidently anxious to display their courage before him. (163) This pretense of freedom in the face of neces sity, however, pales in comparison with the criminality of the officers' decisions in World War I, so memorably exemplified in Stanley Kubrick s Paths of Glory (1968); and it is to be remarked at this point that many mass cul tural genres?the police procedural, the spy novel?end up turning less on the pursuit of the enemy or the official Other than they do on their own institutional framework, with its ineffective and ill-informed command system and internal subversion, by moles and double or triple agents. Perhaps the abstract theoretical debates on strategy and tactics are relevant here in a new and more formal way: the debate on the influence of Carl von Clausewitz, for ex ample. His notion of war as a duel is as an thropomorphic as the conceptions of Hegel or Homer, his notion of the decisive final bat tle is a thoroughly narrative one (which has wrongly been criticized for omitting the very different dynamic of guerrilla warfare), and even the famous maxim of war as the con tinuation of politics by other means is a way of translating warfare and its specialized per sonnel back into more familiar peacetime and civilian realities amenable to the techniques of the more conventional realist novel. Behind all such discussions lies a narra tological problem and a challenge to anthro</page><page sequence="6">124.5 ] Fredric Jameson 1537 pomorphic representation and to the mimesis of human actions and characters, which ques tions whether such possibilities are not alto gether obsolete in the age of nuclear weapons, drones, and suicide bombers. These debates are waged back and forth across history by generals and commanders, dictators (in an cient and modern senses), and other war leaders. They reenter the narrative representa tions of war in the form of unwarranted hero worship and blind allegiance, or a sense of betrayal, or the contempt of footsoldiers for stupid officers or cowardly generals. These are all what semiotics terms actantial questions, issues of action and human agency; and even our fourth category, that of technology, seems to move uneasily in and out of the whole area of personification and anthropomorphism. When it comes to the next set of catego ries, however, my sense is that the focus of the war narrative subtly changes and that in Burkes dramatistic pentad we have begun to move from the first four categories to the fifth, which he called scene and to which he attrib uted a different and perhaps more diffuse kind of rhetorical and representational power. For even atrocities might seem to us today to belong rather to the malignant properties of evil or cursed landscapes than to the savagery of individual actors; and it is as though with this and our other later plot types we pass from a world of acts and characters to one of space: scene, landscape, geography, the folds of the earth that determine military campaigns by introducing contingency or the main chance? a heterogeneous element as much Stimmung or affect as it is a mere stage or context for human gestures. Bombs falling out of the sky are part of it, along with the lunar landscape of trench warfare; the silence of deserted vil lages is a narrative player in such tales, along with the menace of empty windows and the complicity of nature in ambush or pursuit? in concealment as well, camouflage being a way that humans acknowledge the primacy of scene, just as maps are another. This category abolishes or suspends the distinction between the enemy's landscape and our own, the latter no less fraught with peril than some unknown, hostile terrain. Here the great hand-to-hand duels of the armies (Napoleon versus Kutuzov, Wallen stein versus Gustavus Adolfus) give way to imagery of penetration (the first glimpse of a sea of tanks at the battle of Kursk, the smell of sweating armies miles away in World War I, the screaming of dive bombers, the first exposed steps in an abandoned hamlet). The space of modern warfare is vulnerable by def inition and no longer belongs to anyone. That was also the case in the Thirty Years' War, whose most extraordinary literary doc ument begins in full incursion and horror, as mercenaries (of whatever affiliation) loot vil lages and torture peasants for food and gold: Da ring man erst an, die Stein von den Pistolen und hingegen an deren Statt der Bauern Dau men aufzuschrauben, und die armen Schel men so zu foltern, als wenn man hatt Hexen brennen wollen, massen sie sich einen von den bereits in Backoven Steckten, und mit Feuer hinter ihm her waren, ohngesehen er noch nichts berkannt hatte; einem anderen mach ten sie ein Seil um den Kopf und rettelten es mit einem Bengel zusammen, das ihm das Blut zu Mund, Nas und Ohren heraus sprang. (Grimmelshausen 17) Then they used thumbscrews, which they cleverly made out of their pistols, to tor ture the peasants, as if they wanted to burn witches. Though he had confessed to nothing as yet, they put one of the captured hayseeds in the bake oven and lit a fire in it. They put a rope around someone else's head and tight ened it like a tourniquet until blood came out of his mouth, nose, and ears. In short, every soldier had his favorite method of making life miserable for peasants, and every peasant had his own misery. (Schulz-Behrend 7)</page><page sequence="7">1538 War and Representation | PMLA The period has virtually become defined by such atrocities, which I am tempted to count into scene, into space itself as one of its prop erties during this long war, in which most of central Europe is consumed, at all scales from macroscopic to microscopic: armies pursuing each other from one end of Europe to another, enemy battalions unwittingly colliding in marshes during the night, bands of maraud ers burning villages, a deserter ransacking an empty house. "Noses and eares cut of to make hatbandes." ... "The robbers and murderers took a piece of wood and stuck it down the poor wretches' throats, stirred it and poured in water, adding sand or even human faeces. . . ." "They tied our honest burgher Hans Betke to a wooden pole and roasted him at the fire from seven in the morning until four in the afternoon, so that he gave up the spirit amidst much shrieking and pains." (Clark 32-34) With such nightmares, one has the sense that the two categories of internal invasion and in tervention and of war carried to foreign, un familiar territory coincide and dialectically reinforce each other. This is not so much the pseudo-synthesis of a "civil war" (an oxymoron if there ever was one) as an utter transmogrifi cation of the familiar into the alien, the Heim lich into the unheimlichy in which the home village?the known world, the real, and the ev eryday?is transformed into a place of unimag inable horror, while the neighbors of the home country (the eternal peasants, the stock charac ters of village life) become sly faces of evil and of menace, ambushing the soldier who strays from his company and lynching the few they can safely overpower, concealing food, and hid ing in the woods like savages (anachronistically to redeploy that Fenimore Cooper imagery Balzac so relished). But this is something that happens, not so much to individuals, to charac ters as such, as to the landscape, which fades in and out of nightmare, its mingled dialects now intelligible, now the gibberish of aliens. Some such gestaltlike metamorphosis from familiar to unfamiliar, from the anthro pomorphic to the micro- or macroscopic play of material elements, can be observed in what the Thirty Years' War imposes on our at tempts to conceptualize it as a whole. On the one hand, the great strategic trajectory of the armies of a Wallenstein or a Gustavus Adol phus, of ferocious condottieri like Ernst von Mansfeld or the Bavarian general Tilly, or of the Spanish armies of intervention, in search of the enemy and of some decisive bone jarring clash. On the other, a well-nigh optical enlargement, an eyelash-brushing approach in which the seemingly intelligible units of the official armies disintegrate into minute bands of individual marauders spreading across an everywhere-identical landscape of fields and woods, huts and paths, and offering the same scenes of carnage and flight over and over again, beyond history, beyond narrative. This effect is caused not solely by the complexity of this block of historical time, with its innumerable agents and actors (who constantly change position and swap their functions with one another), a multiplicity only momentarily simplified by the conven tional stereotype of religious war and the climactic struggle between the Counter Reformation and Protestantism. For the Counter-Reformation is already divided and multiplied by the triple centers of the papacy, Madrid, and the Habsburg emperor Ferdi nand II (more Catholic and fanatical than the pope and than his Spanish relatives), while what is loosely called Protestantism?already locked in internecine warfare between its two branches, Lutheran and Calvinist, both of them anathematized by innumerable mil lenarian sects?is itself susceptible to infinite fission and the propagation of innumerable subsidiary local and foreign conflicts. To assign the guilt of striking the first blow is a philosophical quandary of the first magnitude. Even the most warlike of the participants?Wallenstein, for example?can</page><page sequence="8">1 2 4 5 ] Fredric Jameson 1539 also be read as embodying a humane will to peace, to the ending of the indefinite prolif eration of the war and an establishment of central European unity on a new basis. (Even Schiller's Hamlet-like version of the great generalissimos assassination leaves us with multiple interpretations of his motives: Does he want to found a dynasty and make him self emperor? Does he want to unite Germany in some prefiguration of nineteenth-century nationalism? Is he, against all appearances, a moderate and a peacemaker? or even a Prot estant sympathizer? Etc., etc.) In fact, although Ferdinand would like to repeal many of the confessional compro mises of the preceding century, it is the Prot estant side that provides the provocative and incendiary pretext: the Protestant elites of Prague, dissatisfied by Habsburg sovereignty, persuade the elector of the Palatinate, a son in-law of James I of England, to assume the throne of Bohemia, normally a prerogative of the emperors dynastic lineage. But the elec tor only wins the mock title of Winter King, owing to his brief tenure, cut short by the de cisive battle of White Mountain (1620), and leaves the unhappy Friedrich to wander from ally to ally in search of a renewal of fortune, in a hapless quest that turns him into the very allegory of weakness and indecision. Here is a modern version of this uninspiring and vac illating figure, perking up somewhat at the prospect of meeting his mercenary generals, themselves revived by the intermittent and sluggish streams of cash flowing reluctantly into The Hague, "refreshed by the sums like flowers in the dew," as they ride out to greet their sometime employer: His heart beat strongly in his breast as he saw powerful hooves drive these armored and un disciplined men toward him. They told of the Danish king, Christian, and of Lower Saxony, magnificent in its prosperity; told also how the emperor lusted to swallow up Magdeburg, and gave news of the latest effort of the dis tinguished house of Habsburg to acquire a re liable mooring, namely a certain Wallenstein, the three making merry over this unknown name. And the slack Friedrich felt himself awakening to life again, swept back into the old excitement by the proximity of these two stormily galloping, heavily ironclad warriors. (Doblin 248)1 The stereotypical vacillation (shared by the emperor) does not equip this personage to be a protagonist, any more than the grim but in distinct determination of the true instigator of this war, the Bavarian elector Maximilian, en titles him to be the villain of the piece (Mann 299-300). But we must also pause here a mo ment to register the existence of that extraor dinary literary document, the novel entitled Wallenstein, an untranslated and visionary nightmare dreamed and written up by the young surgeon Alfred Doblin in evenings dur ing the bloody trench warfare of World War I and published in 1920, nine years before Ber lin Alexanderplatz made him world famous. No background in Doblin, no preparation, no perspective, it comes before us as a perpetual present that is at every moment, on every page, in every sentence, filled space, without a pause or backward or forward glimpse. The armies are in movement even when at rest in their temporary quarters. The army's pauses are movement; they hint at some sly signal by Wallenstein, who rebukes the kaiser by not following his directions, feints the enemy, pretends to obey the commands to stop (says one of the imperial counselors, "[E]s ist mir nicht klar, gegen wen der Herzog Krieg fiihrt" [254]). Yet the space is filled at every moment with names, with all the characters of history, some known, some only mentioned in pass ing, and with place-names as well?not even the map is enough to accommodate them all. It is a pulsing interminable uninterrupted flow, true textuality (not mere form without content) in which everything is in perpetual change back and forth across central Europe yet driving forward temporally so that time, the passing instants, becomes invisible. Only</page><page sequence="9">1540 War and Representation [ PMLA the events are generated, and they never stop; the writer never stops (he thereby disappears also); and the sources are so thoroughly used up that nothing is anymore allusion. Schiller has long since vanished. There is no longer any competition with this unending flow of text but only the affect that pulses through it and changes color from pallor to flush, purple to sallow yellow. All the tonalities of the af fective spectrum stream through the intermi nable moments, none of them truly fulfilled or effectuating any lasting pause or destiny. Not the least interest of this novel is in deed the recurrence in its form of an allegori cal habit profoundly consanguineous with the baroque content of its setting in the Counter Reformation. Thus, here it is money itself that ultimately revives the unhappy Winter King: the lifeblood of the money that runs through the immense continental expanse of the conflict, feeding it locally and organiz ing its forces into impermanent groups, from foraging deserters and guerrillas up to offi cial and unofficial warlords and the leaders of the royal and imperial adversaries. The great and bloody rhizome of the war then becomes a representation of money, riches, wealth, taxes levied, the very sustenance of potatoes impounded from villages in flames and from peasants dead or in flight. Everything here from the penniless imperial court, which counts on Wallenstein to raise forces for it at the same time that it tries to give him orders, down to the brutal soldateska who live off the countryside?has to do with money and with an immense coral polyp that refuses to starve or die away but keeps itself alive for unforesee able years by the very strength with which it draws money out of its hiding place, like mag nets drawing, or blood from a stone, soaking it up interminably, reproducing itself, using its population of generals, peasants, priests, bur ghers, kings, lepers, the landless, heiresses, as so many divining rods, so many instruments for draining the last drops of wealth from the devastated land. Wealth then becomes the conduit of energy, whether blood, sexuality and libido, activity, irritability, sensation, im pulse, drive, propulsion; it is what makes the sentences pound forward like horses' hooves as well as the human individuals themselves to their otherwise incomprehensible yet ir repressible heat-seeking clashes. The libidinal apparatus of the war?of this extraordinary, unique war?thus ensures the most fully re alized representation of finance and its net works and capillary extremities, making wealth in its "early modern" sense appear be fore us as a phenomenon in its own right, in the strong Heideggerian sense of the phaines thaiy the appearance of Being, in ways frontal narratives of trading companies and usurers were unlikely to convey, or the abstractions of religious moralizing or economic philosophy. All this eventuates in blood and land scapes of dead bodies, the world of Jacques Callot anachronistically revived in that of World War I, which reproduces it only for reasons of historical underdevelopment, be cause its generals failed to grasp the proper use of machine guns or of tanks. Still, we may wonder what forms the representation of agents and agency can take under the regime of the scene, in this interminable narrative of events and sequence of grotesque or night marish figures, more human in their caricat urality than any of the genuine human beings of realism or of our acquaintance. No causes, to be sure, and yet immense allegorical fig ures, like the famous frontispiece of Hobbes's Leviathan or, better, Giuseppe Arcimboldo's vegetable portraits, in which the sovereign is called on to be his own multiplicity and his own multitudinous subjects. But here the "world-historical figure" allegorizes not sub jects or a people, not even the collectivity of the men under his command, but rather his own victims and the corpses he has in effect become. Here is Tilly, one of the more fear some of these legendary imperial warlords, as he entertains an audience with the equally fearsome Wallenstein himself:</page><page sequence="10">124.5 ] FredricJameson 1541 The Brabanter [Tilly], stiff and ghostly, with a white scarf, two pistols and a dagger in his belt, and short white hair; at the hairs' tips like ears of wheat there waved the corpses of a thousand men cut down. His pale, sharp fea tures, bushy brows, stiff brushlike moustache rippled with the mutilated regiments of a whole generation; they clung in slippage to the buttons of his jerkin, to his belt. His gnarled fingers each one testified to the annihilation of whole cities; with every knuckle a dozen exterminated villages. Over his shoulders there crowded forward, writhing, the bodies of slaughtered Turks, Frenchmen, Palatiners, and yet someday he would meet his judgment with them on himself along with their horses and dogs, hanging every which way in front of each other and one on top of the other, a bur den so immense his very head and little hat vanished beneath it. Necks ripped open and scabby, stomachs with white and livid colors, veined and dripping on the slit and restrained arms and the spastic legs. Guts in loops of in testines in which he was wrapped, sloshing and flabby over the braced knees encased in leather, an interminable limp wormlike rippling train that as he dragged it creaked with every step. He weighed the earth down like a mammoth but bore himself icily, deaf to the screams of the men and those, bone shattering, of the swine, the shrill cries and piping of the horses, all of them holding to him, seeking to suck their life out of him, out of the most minute hairs on his head; horses' necks straining, their nostrils trembling, pie bald, black; dogs shot to pieces and yet snuf fling at his mouth and nose, greedily sucking up his breath. He should have long since been drained; they were sucking dry wood; he clicked and clattered around inside and yet could not be brought down. Behind him four teen regiments of infantry and six of cavalry. In front of him Friedland [Wallenstein], a yellow dragon emerging from the bubbling bogs of Bohemia, plastered with black slime to the hips, drawn back onto his knobby hind legs, sulfur pressed into the earth ringing him, waving his broad elastic rump in the air behind him with his big jaws wide open, bliss fully and with the fury of a serpent exhaling hot breath in intermittent blasts, with a pant ing and grunting that struck fear. (243-44) These portraits, which we may characterize as rehearsing the modes of allegory and symbol respectively, are drawn into an uninterrupted stream of filled time and space, of a visual writing only occasionally punctuated by dra matic scenes, by a showing that mainly takes second place to the telling of the visionary nightmare, which feeds on the interminable war as on indefinitely renewable fodder. Wallenstein's biographer gives us a more articulated picture of the perpetuum mobile of this infernal machine, which seems un able to run down and stop (and indeed Wal lenstein's function, for good and ill alike, is to have been able to supply the gradually less and less enthusiastic kaiser with ever-renewed reserves of troops): After not much more than a year [after White Mountain], people began to fear that the rapid exhaustion both sides felt was premature. A definitive victory would have had to be a uni versal one and could never have existed. Par tial victories, however, each of which related to the whole in a different way, called new ene mies into the field, who then gave new energies to the old adversaries, humiliated and pillaged. Bohemia, although isolated in its captivity, re mained a part of Europe, and Germany even more so owing to its size. This is not merely an individual opposition, a struggle between two power centers, or the aggression of a single one of them. It is a tidal succession of wills in con flict, some of which claim to be able to form them into a single unified will and campaign against another one, and yet never do com pletely subsume the wills of their individual allies. A fencing court. Individual pairs joust. Suddenly they form two fronts which begin to move in opposition to each other. Yet as they do so, the ballet of betrayal sets in within each. One party withdraws into a corner, exchanges meaningful looks with its former adversary, maneuvers between the two fronts, seeking to mediate. Another tries to entice this or that</page><page sequence="11">1542 War and Representation [ PMLA participant out of both fronts and to form a third. All this is laden with illusion, mis takes, deception. No one knows enough about the other, and some don't even know their own minds. (Mann 287-88) This fencing ballet of the war as a whole, as in an aerial shot, stands in sharp contrast to the horrors on the ground, as recorded by Grim melshausen and others?a kind of no-man's land in which all spaces are identical and all the atrocities as well, a kind of nightmarish repetition moving from Bohemia to the Baltic and back, a triumph, as it were, of space and identity over time and its differentiations, a virtually nonnarrative flow for which the only appropriate registering apparatus or point of view would seem to be the eyes of an idiot or of a child, as in Ambrose Bierce s terrifying story "Chicamauga." [m] And this is indeed how Der abenteuerliche Simplicissimus begins?the supreme liter ary monument produced by one of the par ticipants in this war, its six books published in 1668 and 1669, some 150 years after Don Quijote and Lazarillo de Tormes and 50 before Robinson Crusoe (1719). Yet it is clearly incor rect to characterize Simplicissimus as a pica resque novel or even as a bildungsroman (the hero is certainly a naif, who seems to main tain his innocence even during the episodes in which he has technically become a trick ster figure). Not only is this enormous text episodic in the extreme, it is also rhizomatic, a kind of hypertext throwing off all kinds of ancillary episodes, at least one of which, Cou rasche (1670), has known a prodigious afterlife in Bertolt Brechts theatrical version. But we will argue that Simplicissimus is more than episodic; it is an extraordinary ma chine for generic production, for the narrative progression tirelessly generates one new genre after another, from the war novel and the lives of saints to the final Utopia and desert-island narrative. How to account for this unparal leled literary autopoesis, this nonteleological proliferation of generic exercises, which goes well beyond what has been identified under the term generic discontinuities! Is it possible that it is precisely out of that undifferentiated space of local yet universal conflict, whose fever chart runs from the plundering of vil lages to the sacking of whole cities and back, that in the absence of ready-made narrative microforms the various genres are themselves summoned into existence? At any rate, we begin virtually in the state of nature, in which the youthful protagonist scarcely has language?in particular, he does not know his own name or has none?and is being ordered around the field by his bru tal father (whose very status is registered in dialect?"knan"?equally bereft of a family name). He flees into the woods during the mer cenaries&gt; sack of the village from which I have quoted above and there meets a pious hermit who instructs him in religion and, even more remarkably, in the classical languages and their rhetorical traditions (the causes of this saintly hermit s withdrawal from the world, a premo nition of Simplicius's own eventual destiny?it is indeed the hermit who thus baptizes him? will be related in a later discovery, which reca pitulates the different genre of unhappy love). On the death of the hermit, the boy returns to the world of social beings, becoming page to the governor. Then, abducted by Croatian mer cenaries, he is incorporated into the imperial troops, where, after a number of humiliations, he reemerges generically as the trickster figure mentioned above, a Yager supremely gifted in warfare and plunder or theft of all kinds, after which he marries and then, in a more magical episode, discovers treasure. Yet these potential destinies are all abruptly broken off, whether out of impatience or boredom or owing to the serial production of the various books, if not the fermentation of new genres at work in Grimmelshausens</page><page sequence="12">124.5 ] FredricJameson 1543 feverish imagination. There follow a salacious episode in Paris, a spell as a traveling sales man, a fall into the bad company of a real thief who tries to teach him the way of the real world ("du bis noch Simplicius, der den Machiavellum noch nit studiert hat" [353]), a religious conversion, his founding of a new landed estate and family, a Vernian journey to the center of the earth, and finally travels that lead to his shipwreck and a hermitlike existence on a desert island, where his auto biographical notes are found by a Dutch sea captain, who brings them back to Europe and to publication. Finally, it is not so much the narrative quality of the episodes that strikes the reader as rather the restlessness of the characters ex ploration of his possible destinies and that of the authors experimentation with the various narrative genres they carry within themselves. We are here, in the German principalities of the empire, still very far even from the sophis tication of the Spanish monarchy, in which the first realisms flourished so many genera tions earlier and in which the urban world liness of commercial life and colonial and military power generate the picaresque, along with an extraordinary theatrical culture. Ger many is here still profoundly prenovelistic, and indeed the first crystallizations of form in Grimmelshausen s seemingly intermina ble text take the form of immense allegori cal dream frescoes?most strikingly, that of the class divisions and struggles of the feudal world, with its prelates and nobles at the top of the allegorical tree and the nameless peas antry at its base (45), along with the dream transformation into an animal, reminiscent of The Golden Ass, of Apuleius. But it would be equally incorrect to read such allegorical epi sodes as the self-indulgence of an autodidact reveling in his classical education. For in this great laboratory of forms, baroque allegory is closely affiliated with Utopia as such, which one may perhaps indeed in hindsight identify (in Thomas More) as an allegorical form. The devastated landscape, indeed, calls out for the relief of Utopian transfiguration. Such is the first crossing of the border into Switzerland: The landscape struck me compared with other German lands, as strange as Brazil or China. I saw people trading and strolling about in peace, barns full of cattle, courtyards full of chickens, geese, and ducks. The streets were used by travelers in safety, taverns full of people making merry, no fear of the en emy, no worry about plundering and sacking, no anxiety about losing land or life and limb. Everyone lived safely under his grape arbor or fig tree and, in comparison with other Ger man lands, in pleasure and content, so that I took this country for an earthly paradise, although it seemed primitive enough. (391) Later on, among the hallucinations of the desert island, this earthly paradise will be transformed into a vision of primeval bliss?"so we lived like the first men in the golden age, where a bountiful heaven lets all the fruits of the earth flourish without work" (582)?until the devil in the form of a woman shatters the vision and sends the text itself, in the generic reversion, back into the anchoritic withdrawal of its own beginnings. I want to draw the conclusion that war, perceived at this existential proximity of scene, is virtually nonnarrative and that this raw material seeks to appropriate its missing protagonist from any number of narrative paradigms, ranging from the conventions of generic war films and novels enumerated at the outset to the multiplicity of generic exper iments in Grimmelshausens peculiar text. [IV] It is a hypothesis we may now test on the aerial warfare of World War II, about which it will be recalled that the most famous representa tion of its most famous (European) atrocity? Slaughterhouse-Five?sets the firebombing of</page><page sequence="13">1544 War and Representation [ PMLA Dresden offstage, behind the sealed door of the protagonist s eponymous cellar. About this kind of warfare, W. S. Sebald, who grew up in a part of Germany untouched by the air war and exiled himself to England at an early age, has oddly maintained that the Germans have repressed its experience and indeed that of the defeat in general. He excepts from this accusa tion one of the most remarkable writers (and filmmakers) of modern Germany, Alexander Kluge, whose portrayal of the Battle of Stalin grad (Schlachtbeschreibung) already presents many of the features to be noted in the later account of the bombing of his native city, Hal berstadt, on 8 April 1945 (1: 509-791). It was indeed Kluge from whom we se lected the remark by Goebbels that figures as a motto to the present essay; and it is in pre cisely this sense that Stalingrad seems to dis integrate into a host of unrelated colors and brushstrokes as we gradually approach our eyes and faces to the canvas. It would be facile to characterize this text as a deconstruction, either of the traditional narrative account of the battle or of the battle itself. Yet in some literal sense the word is apt, provided that we take it backward, as referring to an account of the elements and raw materials that went into the building of the phenomenon hereby unbuilt: indeed, the Stalingrad book has as its suggestive subtitle The Organizational Con struction of a Catastrophe. Kluge redistributes the building blocks of the defeat in what may be called nonexistential segments, which is to say nonnarrative units set side by side in a kind of collage. We here find extracts from an army manual on winter warfare side by side with historical accounts, pictures of the land scape, interviews with survivors, medical de scriptions of the most characteristic wounds and mutilations, a chronology, the propa ganda rhetoric of pastors and preachers on the subject, the language habits of the officers and staff, press clippings and conferences, dis patches from the front, the whole interlarded with anecdotes and other stray observations and testimonies, among which Hitler's vac illations and tactical inattentions are duly registered in passing?in what could, I sup pose, be called a nonlinear "narrative" if one still likes that kind of terminology. It should be understood that Kluges interest lies in the enumeration of destinies and the deployment of anecdotes, not in any sustained or novelistic storytelling or longer narrative breath. It may be said that he practices a unique type of di dactic abstraction, in which a given outcome is x-rayed for the components it incorporates of life-promoting or lethal energies respectively. "The Bombing of Halberstadt" is another such collage (2: 27-82), in which individual ex periences, in the form of anecdotes, are set side by side less for their structures as the acts of traditional characters (Burkes agents) than as names and destinies, the latter being reduced in many cases to peculiar facts and accidents, of the type of Ripley's Believe It or Not. The juxtaposition of these anecdotes with quota tions from academic studies on the history of bombing and on RAF techniques, from schol arly conferences on the relation between aerial strategy and ethics ("moral bombing" is, for ex ample, specified as a matter, not of morals, but of morale), and from interviews with the allied pilots who participated in this raid?all these materials, which we take to be nonfictional (although they may not be; the interviews in particular bear the distinctive marks of Kluges own provocative interview methods), raise the question of the fictionality or nonfictionality of the personal stories of the survivors as well. Halberstadt is, to be sure, Kluges hometown, and he is perfectly capable of having assembled a file of testimonies and eyewitness documen tation and of using the names of real people. On the other hand, these stories, with their rich detail, afford the pleasures of fictional nar rative and fictional reading. Is this text (written in the 1970s) a non fictional novel? I believe that we must think our way back into a situation in which this question makes no sense and in which?as</page><page sequence="14">12 4 5 ] Fredric Jameson 1545 with the storytelling that precedes the emer gence of the so-called Western novel?the distinction between fiction and nonfiction (or history) does not yet obtain, any more than that (so closely related to it) between figurative and literal language. This is to say not that Kluge marks a regression to precapi talist storytelling but rather on the contrary that postmodernity as such has now rendered those distinctions obsolete in the other direc tion: now it is not so much a question of all narrative being fictional as it is of a reading process that is always literal, even when we are reading what is technically a fiction. At any rate, it can be argued that the opening section of "The Bombing of Hal berstadt" is less a matter of assembling the personal experiences of the survivors, the mo ments of the first bombs?in what amount to six successive waves of bombers?than it is of a use of named individuals to map the small city itself (64,000 inhabitants) as they try to make their way across streets increasingly blocked by fires and rubble. (Indeed, we will learn shortly that such attacks follow a specific and intentional pattern: first, strikes calcu lated to identify targets by columns of smoke identifiable from the aircraft; then the system atic blocking off of streets so the fleeing popu lation is trapped; then an initial destruction of roofs and top storys, with a calculated time lapse to allow a later wave of bombers to drop new explosives through the holes and set fire to the buildings as a whole?these procedures carefully designed to produce the so-called firestorm characteristic of the raids.) A certain amount of curious detail is amassed here, such as the effort of the civilians to get rid of flam mable materials such as the stocks of paper in the newspaper offices or hosing groups down to survive the heat. Mainly, however, these opening chapters document the regression of the civilians into their private obsessions and neuroses and their decidedly meaningful and intentional yet aberrant activities, as with the random scattering of an anthill. Thus, in the opening section, which, so characteristically for this writer-filmmaker, deals with the local movie theater, the Capitol, and its manager, Frau Schrader (the owners are on vacation in the country), this particular character is at first worried about the next matinees at three and six o'clock (the first bombs begin to fall at 11:20 a.m.) and only later about the bodies of the initial spectators. Her emotional low point is reached, however, when she finds nothing to do and "feels herself'useless'": not deadly danger but the blockage of activity is the phe nomenon that interests Kluge here. The agitated movements of these named and presumably real-life characters serve to map out the streets they attempt to negotiate, the routes in and out of town, and the posi tions of key buildings?the institute for deaf children, for example, or the church tower, on which civilian volunteers are stationed to ob serve and report the attacks, which of course exceed anything they had expected and at the same time destroy any number of telephone lines and other channels of communication. Both these situations will be given a turn of the anecdotal screw in the second part, in which the postwar interviewer inquires into the pos sibility that a white flag of surrender had been shown on the tower ("surrender to whom?" the American pilot asks; "how do you surren der to a squadron of bombers?"), while a colo nel attempts to get information by telephone about the state of things around his sisters' home outside town (from Magdeburg, owing to the destruction of the lines, he has to "make connections via Croppenstedt, Groningen, Emersleben, and Schwanebeck and then back through Genthin, Oschersleben, and, further south, Quedlinburg"; he never gets through, although the operators realize that this is not official but rather private business). From the two parts, we may retain (and compare) the initial attempt of Herr Gramert to rescue his twelve thousand tin soldiers, which repre sent Napoleon's winter campaign in Russia; the episode of the "unknown photographer"</page><page sequence="15">1546 War and Representation [ PMLA (characteristically, the surviving photographs are here reproduced, along with much other visual material in part 2); and the episode in part 2 in which a teenager succeeds in master ing his piano lesson but not in persuading his piano teacher to reschedule his lesson for the next day, on which, escaping the burning city, he takes refuge in a village, where he practices nonstop so energetically that the owners have to tell him to give it a rest. Part 2 lets us into the formal secret of this work (I will not say its message or its mean ing, exactly), with its differentiation of a strat egy from below and a strategy from above (the latter, to be sure, outlines the bombing techniques and conveys what it would be im proper, as we shall see, to call the point of view of the American pilots). Thus, Gerda Baethe has learned that the pressure from the bomb blasts will damage the lungs; she tries to make her small children hold their breath during the explosions. Meanwhile, Karl Wilhelm von Schroers, a convalescent veteran in charge of the prisoner-of-war camps in Halberstadt, ea gerly visits key points in and out of the city, giving and taking orders but above all satisfy ing his keen scientific curiosity. This charac teristic, like Baethes "strategies," is not to be understood in any subjective way, even though the two are vivid personalities succinctly con veyed in a page or two. In keeping with the neutrality of this text and with the generic fo cus of the anecdote as a form, these are exter nal or objective traits, of the type one registers in other people, as when we note that some one (a proper name) is "quick to anger" or that some other proper name is "indecisive." But Schroers is more significant than that, insofar as his "scientific curiosity" con stitutes something like an "aspiration to to tality," which his position on the ground can scarcely satisfy. He is indeed a "collector of strong sense impressions" (66). His capacity to feel increasingly curiosity rather than anxiety is not based on any lack of imagination. To be sure, with his physical eyes he only sees this particular tavern, a partial view of Wherstedter Bridge (and nothing of the torn-up rails), and perhaps a few houses, but he can imagine the whole city. What he doesn't know [we are still in the night before the bom bardment] is that this will be the last conscious glimpse of the cityscape intact. (68) Like Frau Schrader, he has his later moments of depression (owing to the absence of goals and intentions to be fulfilled, activities to be carried out), but at length he recovers his original energy and curiosity. Another cameo appearance is made by the head of the fire brigade, who deplores the ignorance of the city officials and their haste to extinguish fires that will be control lable only at a later stage of their chemical life and development and who takes a reasoned decision to allow the city's archives and its museum contents to go up in flames: "I was virtually the last person in this city to see its valuable memorabilia, to say farewell, to esti mate the value of the collection" (78). Here the micro perspective, the view from beneath, dwindles to its vanishing point. Yet it should not be imagined that the view from above, that of the pilots and crew, is more comprehensive or reliable. Indeed, as has already been hinted, there is in fact no view from above insofar as the pilots are ex pected not to see but rather to determine their movements by map and by mathematical calculation, by radar rather than by "sight" (an expression that here in any case signi fies strategy, not the personal organs of the participants [54nl2]). All the studies of aerial warfare and its techniques foreground the depersonalization of the individuals involved and their assimilation into the larger machin ery first of their own aircraft and then of the squadron as a whole. "Here there do not fly individual airplanes as in the Battle of Brit ain but rather a whole conceptual system, an intellectual construction in metal" (to quote one of the discussants at a symposium [51]).</page><page sequence="16">124.5 ] Fredric Jameson 1547 Abstraction versus sense-datum: these are the two poles of a dialectic of war, incom prehensible in their mutual isolation, which dictate dilemmas of representation navigable only by formal innovation, as we have seen, and not by any stable narrative convention. It is not to be imagined, however, that we can return to some earlier state of wholeness, in which, as in Homer, individual hand-to hand combat would at one and the same time somehow epitomize the totality. On the other hand, the contradiction can be exacerbated even further, and continues to be in contemporary warfare. Michael Hardt has evoked a kind of dialectic of the body in the most recent American wars, in which the solitary body of the suicide bomber, on the one hand, finds itself opposed, on the other, to the smart bombs and pilotless drones of an aerial warfare visible only on monitors at thousands of miles of distance?a contradiction itself re produced in the distance between the conven tional duel of armies ("mission accomplished") and the house-to-house urban resistance of guerrilla warfare (Hardt and Negri 45). Does this opposition then not correspond to what I previously identified as a distinction between the named (or institutionalized) action and the blooming, buzzing confusion of scene, from which as yet no formalizable actantial categories have emerged? The abstract cate gory may also stand in constitutive opposition to what I called the existential experience of war, through which an equally undefined sub ject or consciousness finds representation. But scene is in its fullest reality necessarily collec tive, and it is the multiplicity of the collective that marks the difference between the repre sentational problems we have rehearsed here. The language of the existential individual al ready possesses an elaborate history with all kinds of stereotypes that it can be the task of representation to correct, disrupt, undermine, or metaphysically challenge. That of the col lective does not yet exist. Group, nation, clan, class, general will, multitude?all these re main so many linguistic experiments for des ignating an unimaginable collective totality, a manifold of consciousness as unimaginable as it is real. War is one among such collective realities, which exceed representation fully as much as they do conceptualization and yet which ceaselessly tempt and exasperate narra tive ambitions, conventional and experimental alike: unless, of course, this particular reality ceases to exist.
