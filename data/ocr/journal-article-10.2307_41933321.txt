<plain_text><page sequence="1">CHARLES KWONG (Lingnan University, Hong Kong) NATURE AND RELIGION IN ANCIENT CHINESE POETRY What is usually understood as "Nature" refers to the physical world existent before and functioning beyond the constructions of human cul- ture. It is within Nature that human life and ideas began to take shape, and to study ancient perceptions of Nature is to explore the roots of hu- man culture. In the Chinese context, discussions of nature poetry or the cultural conception of Nature usually take their earliest point of departure from the first collection of Chinese verse, the Classic of Poetry ( Shi jing, c. 1 1 th-6th century BC).1 As humanity's cradle and source of livelihood, however, Nature has played an important part in Chinese poetry from its ancient beginnings. What is referred to as "ancient" here does not entail any fixed time boundary or definition of periodization in literary history; suffice it to say that as a working concept, ancient Chinese poetry may be seen as the earliest stages of Chinese versification, from the first attempts at rhythmic language to more formalized ways of expression that include a few early pieces in the Shi jing. As an oral poetry initially transmitted without written records in its gradual process of formation, much of an- cient Chinese poetry is lost to us, and the few extant pieces that claim to ' See for instance Wolfgang Kubin, Der durchsichtige Berg: die Entwicklung der Naturanschauung in der Chinesischen Literatur (Stuttgart: Wiesbaden, 1985) (also translated into Chinese by Ma Shude as Zhongguo wenren de ziran guan [Shanghai: Shanghai renmin chubanshe, 1990]); Wang Guoying, Zhongguo shanshuishi yanjiu (Taipei: Linking Publishing Co., 1986); Li Wenchu et al, Zhongguo shanshuishi shi (Guangdong: Guangdong gaodeng jiaoyu chubanshe, 1991); Zhu Defa, ed., Zhongguo shanshuishi lungao (Jinan: Shandong youyi chubanshe, 1994); Zhang Shangzheng, Zhongguo shanshui wenxue yanjiu (Shanghai: Xuelin chubanshe, 1997); Tabei Fumio, Chūgoku shizenshi no keifu: Shikyõ kara Tõ shi made (Tokyo: Taishukan shoten, 1995); Donald Holzman, Landscape Appreciation in Ancient and Early Medieval China: The Birth of Landscape Poetry (Hsin-chu: Program for Research of Intellec- tual-Cultural History, National Tsing Hua Univ., 1996).

Such rhythmic accompaniments to labor do not necessarily express any substantive content, but are probably repeated in order to harmonize work effort, much like what is recorded in the Huainanzi in later times: "Nowadays when people lift huge logs, those in front would cry 'ye-hu', while those behind would echo the cry. This is a song that facilitates physical exertion when lifting something heavy."7 Prompted by and initially heard during the act of labor, such "labor-facilitating" sounds form part of the working process, with the ef- fects of coordinating group motion, focusing attention, relieving fatigue, lightening the spirit and offering a shared emotional release, all with the ultimate purpose of raising functional efficiency and productivity.8 6 He Xiu's comment in his annotation of the Gongyang zhuan , 15th year of Duke Xuan (594 BC); see Xu Yan, annot., Chunqiu Gongyangzhuan zhushu , ed.

(Beijing: Zhonghua shuju, 1989), 1:380-81. In the Liishi chunqiu , ch.6 "Shenying Ian - Yinci", "yu-xu" is given instead of "ye-hu"; see Chen Qiyou, annot., Liishi chunqiu jiaoshi , 4 vols. (Shanghai: Xuelin chubanshe, 1984), 3:1187. Whether "ye-hu" or "yu-xu", what is referred to is a sound uttered in the exertion of physical effort. Even today, one can hear work songs or chants with a similar purpose; see for instance the "Taimu ge" (literally a "log-lifting song") collected in Long Yu- cheng and Wang Jiying, eds., Guizhou minjian geyao (Guiyang: Guizhou renmin chu- banshe, 1997), 257-58. The song consists of brief and colloquial lines mostly ending with an interjectory "hei-zha" or "hei-la", occasionally in combination with a trisyl- labic interjection like "hei-zha-he" or "o-he-yi", or even a quadrisyllable one like "hei- la-yo-he" or "hei-luo-yo-he". In uncovering the archaic meaning of xing , one of the most basic clues to the poetic construction of the Shi jing songs, Shang Chengzuo observes that the word "xing" de- picts "four hands each holding up the corner of a tray," and concludes that "xing" is an interjectory cry in the category of "ye-hu", uttered while people were lifting up something heavy together. This observation lends additional support to the argument that poetry originated from collective labor. See Shang Chengzuo, ed., Yinqi yicun , 2 vols. (Nanjing: Jinling daxue Zhongguo wenhua yanjiusuo, 1933), "Yinqi yicun kaoshi," 2:62a. Quoting Shang in his "The Shih-ching : Its Generic Significance in Chinese Literary History and Poetics," Shih-hsiang Chen adds the premise that this cry is "a primitive 'heave-ho' or 'hurrah,' ejaculated in joy and high spirits"; Chen bases his argument on Guo Moruo's argument that "xing" (more specifically, the cen- tral element in the ancient graph for the word) involves a dynamic sense of "turning J AH 37/1 (2003)</page><page sequence="4">36 CHARLES KWONG But the acts and cries of labor do not just facilitate material subsis- tence; in the gradual evolution of ancient culture, they serve as a focal ground for the growth of the human mind, spirit, and emotions as well. This, along with the proliferation of practical and communicative needs, fostered the development of language in due course, and there gradually crystallized primitive verse that re-creates and transmits practical experi- ence, with a form, content and style related to the activities of primitive livelihood. Thus the cry of "ye-hu" quoted above consists of a two-beat rhythm, reflective of the fact that the primitive act of labor is essentially a two-part motion, namely the focused build-up and release of physical force. As an inteijectory cry "ye-hu" does not contain any specific con- tent, but if words of substantive meaning are put into the expression,9 one can see the natural formation of a primitive labor poetry with a two-beat rhythm. As Yang Gongji observes, "this type of two-beat verse is the prototype of poetry, and features in the primitive literatures of various peoples."10 One good example is the "Catapult Song" (Dan ge): Cut bamboo, g(f Yi ' Tie bamboo; Ktt ' Shoot earth, fféi: ' Chase game. ÒE 7'? ( fi ) ° No longer a mere accompaniment to a general laboring motion, the two-beat lines of the song summarize the actual process and purpose of a labor act. Using a direct, factual language, a clean, unadorned style and a simple, forceful rhythm - all embodied in four verb-object expressions without adjectives - the song captures a logical sequence of scenes and actions with a crisp and concise vividness.

As far as its subject matter is concerned, stone arrowheads were among the relics unearthed at a late paleolithic (about 40,000-10,000 years ago) site in Shiyu (Shanxi province), proving that bows and arrows were already used for hunting in China about 28,000 years ago.12 In addition to archeo- logical evidence, ancient texts also attest to the use of bows and arrows in primitive hunting pursuits. For instance, the Classic of Changes (Yi jing) writes of how "the Yellow Emperor, Yao and Shun... bent wood into bows and sharpened wood into arrows,"13 while Shang (c. 1600-c. 1046 BC) oracle bone inscriptions abound with records of having "captured shot deer", "shot pig", "shot doe", "shot buffalo", etc.14 It is obvious that the use of earth pellets is an even more primitive method of shooting than the use of sharpened stone or wooden arrowheads,15 which is why the WuYue chunqiu observes that "the crossbow developed from the bow, and the bow from the catapult".16 In form the song's two-beat rhythm not only mirrors that of primitive labor, but probably forms the prototype of the line rhythm in the Shi jing, with its basic 4-character line typically consisting of two 2- character halves, e.g., "Cut-wood ding-ding;/ Bird-cries ying-ying" (#165 "Fa mu" [Cutting Wood]). And in terms of style, the song is perhaps as simple and unadorned as substantive poetry can be. In sum, although the "Catapult Song" is recorded only in the WuYue chunqiu written by the 12 See Xu Shunzhan, Zhongyuan yuangu wenhua , 28-30; Zhang Chuanxi, Zhongguo gu- dai shigang , vol.1, 3rd rev. ed.

Marking a succinct and imagistic re-creation of the hunt from weapon-making to target pursuit, the "Catapult Song" both depicts the stages of a livelihood process and condenses work experience into rhymed language, which can be transmitted for fixture reference. No re- ligious sentiment or imaginative language is visible yet: the poem does not show any conceptual consciousness of natural objects, let alone any expansive or holistic idea of Nature. Instead, there are only individual items directly related to livelihood and expressed in a down-to-earth manner. One can expect the Nature-Humanity relationship in ancient China to be more fUlly revealed in other labor songs now lost, but glimpses of it may be found in the divinatory Classic of Changes, where individual parts of primitive songs similar in content to "Dan ge" seem to have been recast as hexagram judgements and line statements:19 There is no game in the field. P9 ° (Hexagram 32 "Heng," nine in fourth place) At the wellhole one shoots fishes; the jug is broken and leaky. ' SlteSt ° (Hexagram 48 "Jing nine in second place) One shoots pheasants, and loses an arrow. ° (Hexagram 56 "Lii," six in fifth place) 17 Ibid, 152, 157n24. 18 On this point literary historians are generally agreed. See for instance Zhang Songru, ed., Zhongguo shige shi-XianQin liangHan , 12; Nie Shiqiao, XianQin liangHan wenxue shigao , 8; You Guoen et al., eds., Zhongguo wenxue shi , vol.1 (Beijing: Ren- min wenxue chubanshe, 1963), 19; Jin Qihua et al, eds., Zhongguo wenxue shi (Nanchang: Jiangxi jiaoyu chubanshe, 1989), 22. The text of the Yi jing consists of materials accreted over almost a millenium, the earli- est parts of which date back to late Shang and early Zhou times. The judgment of the "Appended Remarks" is a sound one: "Didn't the Classic of Changes arise during the final years of Yin and the flourishing virtue of Zhou? Isn't it about the affairs of [King] Zhou and King Wen?" (Pt. II, ch. 11; in Gao Heng, Zhouyi dazhuan jinzhu , 593). Cf.

The recurrence in the divination state- ments of objects close to human subsistence needs - animals needed for food and other purposes - underlines the attempt by the early Chinese to manage their destiny through probing the secrets of Nature. Dependency on Nature, of course, had led the primitive Chinese to ne- gotiate a relationship with Nature ever since they entered the evolutionary scene, long before any written language came into being to record their experiences.20 The findings of anthropology and ethnology inform us that the first human economic mode was food-gathering (of fruits and plants, bird eggs and small animals, etc.), and that hunting became a source of livelihood over a million years ago during the early paleolithic era (c. 3,000,000-200,000 years ago).2' Probably out of a closer instinctive sense of affinity with animals, an admiration for certain animal attributes such as strength, ferocity, size and speed, and an ignorance of basic physio- logical matters like procreation and death, primitive humans came to re- gard animals - and, by extension, plants, heavenly bodies and natural forces - as kin or even ancestors. Thus totemism, based on a feeling of kinship for other objects in Nature, gradually took shape during the mid- paleolithic era (c. 200,000-40,000 years ago) as the first conceptual link which humanity established with Nature. In point of fact, the totem22 was not originally taken as a deity. But confronted with existential and psy- chological experiences they could not understand (e.g. dreams, loss of consciousness, hallucination, sickness and death), our primitive ancestors began to develop a speculative sense that something invisible but sensible 20 Though the precise point of origin of the Chinese language is often a matter of contro- versy, the written language probably dated back to no earlier than the 3rd millennium BC. See Su Bingqi, ed., Zhongguo tongshi , vol.2, 276-82, 341-44; Luo Kun and Zhang Yongshan, Zhongguo xiao tongshi: yuanshi shehui, 472-84. See Xu Shunzhan, Zhongyuan yuangu wenhua, 246, 262-63. In the language of the North American Indians, "totem" refers to a natural object con- sidered to have a close connection with a family group and with which it identifies; regarded as a special symbol of the group, the totem may be a plant, an inorganic ob- ject, a heavenly body, a natural force, and especially an animal. The Chinese version of totemism is seen most clearly in ancient clan surnames, which are derived semanti- cally from animals, birds and insects; see Zhan Yinxin, Shenling yu jisi - Zhongguo chuantong zongjiao zonglun (Nanjing: Jiangsu guji chubanshe, 1992), 113-19. In ad- dition, the descriptions of half-human, half-animal creatures given in the Shanhai jing also point to totem worship. J AH 37/1 (2003)</page><page sequence="8">40 CHARLES KWONG - a soul or spirit - inheres in the depths of the human being, capable of leaving the bodily form temporarily or permanently. By extension, this speculative sense further evolved into a general animistic belief that all objects, phenomena and forces of Nature, large and small, are alive with spirits or souls. Blending with this animistic conception, Nature's totems became deified into guardian spirits, while a supernatural belief in ill- willed nature goblins also arose out of a fear of the unknown. These de- velopments, according to the estimation of anthropologists and ethnolo- gists, probably took place during the late paleolithic era.23 These various sentiments find expression in a few religious incanta- tions and sacrificial songs recorded in later texts, which reflect the super- natural visualization of a natural world mixed with concrete work experi- ence. Witness an incantation given in the Classic of Mountains and Seas (Shanhai jing) meant to expel the drought spirit, and a prayer recorded in Carving Dragons with the Literary Mind (Wenxin diaolong), purportedly made by the sage-king Shun to the field god: "Go north, spirit!" r WtíŤ !

EJjßfJWi* ¡ "Sacrificial prayer to the field god"25 Addressing basic concerns of arable farming, both songs represent a convergence of ardent wish and proven experience (with one mentioning actual husbandry and the other the removal of harmful factors), reflecting a primitive attempt to deal with Nature through language. In the incanta- tion, the irrigation method and water management used to overcome arid conditions (11. 2-3) is transformed from a means of production into verbal magic meant to subdue the nature goblin of the drought (1. 1).

Under the drive of psychological longing, the rhyme-words si, mu and you (which all belong to the zhi rhyme in ancient Chinese) set up an internal resonance within the song that amplifies the power of the language. What one finds is a consistent fusion of effort and desire aimed at harnessing Nature through magical language and ritual. Such an effort is even more evident in the incantatory "Zha [Sacrifice] Song" found in the Record of Rites (Li ji): Will the earth go back to its abode [zhai], ! Water return to the gully [he], tKUwÄÜ ! Insects not stir [zuo], ! And wild plants return to the marshes [ze]! 26 ! If labor songs are the first form of poetry to arise out of labor experi- ence, then the "Zha Song" points to the primitive prototype of a farming labor song. Animistic in its perception, the "Zha Song" first articulates the factors bearing on agricultural production, then converts them into voli- tional actions, and finally calls upon rhymes (zhai, he, zuo and ze all be- long to the duo rhyme in ancient Chinese) and an imperative tone to trans- form experiential statements into a wishful summons of Nature. Like other examples discussed above, the song demonstrates how sacrifices, prayers and incantations all register a complicated relationship between Nature and humanity. On the one hand, the empirical agents of Nature affecting liveli- hood - earth, water, insects, plants - seem potent and important enough to take on the status of spirits, so that humankind appears helplessly depend- ent and must make offerings to Nature in order to secure its blessing. But on the other hand, the "Zha Song" also shows the ancients exerting their will to harness Nature and protect their livelihood. Hope and volition combine with a magic vested in the song to transform helplessness into momentum, reversing the power equation and calling upon the pertinent spirits to obey human wish. Nature's spirits are supposed to bow to an in- cantatory language with an authority to direct them back to their places and perform their proper roles for the benefit of humankind. Thus began with totemism and animism a religious perception of the natural universe, where Nature transcends its raw physicality to become a symbol of something beyond. Like the "Catapult Song", the three pieces discussed above can be taken as reliable transcriptions of primitive oral 26 Ch. 1 1 " Jiao te sheng", "Zha ci", in Zhu Bin, Liji xunzuan, 1 :398.

The word "religion" itself is de- rived from the Latin religio , referring to a sense of fear or awe felt in the presence of a spirit or a god. It has been said that " Nature is the first, original object of religion ,"27 which is probably hard to refute as a general statement if the latter is broadly understood as encompassing totemism, animism and nature worship as they unfolded in the course of cultural evolution.28 Indeed, as wild Nature became domesticated into an agricul- tural and pastoral domain around the turn of the neolithic era, a height- ened wish to live in accord with the environment elevated a supernatural belief in Nature to an even more reverential plane - that of nature wor- ship. Where totemism is a belief corresponding to an appropriation mode of livelihood, nature worship addresses the needs of a production mode of life through personalizing, mythologizing and deifying the major bodies and phenomena of Nature. Where (late paleolithic) nature goblins are conceived out of fear of harmful spirits, (neolithic) nature deities are visualized out of awe and hope for divine cooperation. The development of the primitive imagination toward nature worship, then, was catalyzed by a shift in economic mode from food-gathering and hunting to animal rearing and farming,29 which is more subject to the vaga- 27 Ludwig Feuerbach, Das Wesen der Religion [The Essence of Religion], para. 2, quoted in Van Harvey, Feuerbach and the Interpretation of Religion (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1995), 164; Feuerbach' s text has been translated into Chinese as Zongjiao de benzhi , trans. Wang Taiqing (Beijing: Commercial Press, 1999); see p.2 for the quoted line. The same perception that "nature is the first object of religion" is reiterated in Feuerbach' s Lectures on the Essence of Religion , trans.

(Beijing: Zhonghua shuju, 1988), 561, who expresses a similar view citing an unidentified source. Totemism is not necessarily followed by the emergence of animism in all cultures. For instance, some native peoples in the contemporary world still subscribe to totemism without having developed any animistic belief. See He Xingliang, Zhongguo ziranshen yu ziran chongbai , 3-4, 11-20 (esp. 16-17), for a brief discussion of the relationship between totemism, animism and nature worship as they developed successively in time.

By Shang times, especially after the relocation of the capital to Yin around the 14th century BC, agriculture has become the primary mode of economic production in China.30 The varieties of grain recorded in Shang oracle bones include paddy, millet, barley, beans, sorghum, etc.,31 and their importance to the early Chinese can be seen in the following examples: 32 1.

Other crops planted include mulberry, hemp, turnip, etc. A word of explanation may be needed for the term "nian". According to the Shuowen jiezi under the radical "he", "'nian' refers to grains being fully grown"; similarly according to the Guliang zhuan , "having the five grains fully grown is to have a 'nian'" (3rd year of Duke Huan [709 BC]). Both see "nian" not as a kind of grain but as the maturity of grains. Chen Mengjia's investigation, however, leads him to observe that "nian" refers to a specific kind of grain (millet) when mentioned by it- self (e.g. "shou nian", "yu zu nian"), and to grains in general when it forms part of a compound (e.g. "shunian", "daonian"). Ma Rusen also accepts this view. 32 The Chinese system of numbering days (and subsequently years) is based on two sets of characters, the so-called ten "heavenly stems" and twelve "earthly branches"; these combine to yield a 60-term cycle of two-character designations, with each consisting of one stem and one branch.

Di indicates its merit in nourishing life."40 In other words, shelving for a moment the historical meanings that the terms acquired over time, what is "Heaven" in being and position is "Lord-on-High" in function. In point of fact, the worship of an overlord in Nature was preceded by the worship of nature deities like the sun, moon, thunder, rain, mountains and fire; primitive rock pictures have shown that where the concept of such an overlord began to take shape, he was initially visualized as a composite of the sun, moon and stars.41 It has been speculated that the concept of an empyrean overlord by the name of Tian (Heaven) has taken root by Xia times;42 the lack of firm evidence aside, it is logically possible that a sense 39 See Chen Mengjia, Yinxu bud zonghsu , 561-603 (ch. 17), esp. 562, for an account of the world of deities seen in Shang oracle bones. Cf. Lin Yuqing, Jiaguwen de shijie (Taipei: Changchunshu shufang, 1987), 47-85; Yinxu de faxian yu yanjiu , 184-88; Wang Yuxin and Yang Shengnan, eds., Jiaguxue yibai nian , 592-603. In the oracle bones "Di" appears more frequently than "Shangdi", though the latter term probably reflects His supreme status more fully; see ibid, p.592 for a few instances of the occur- rence of "Shangdi". Note that there is no record of any pre-Shang belief in Shangdi. During Shang times it is possible that "Shangdi" and "Tian" may have been inter- changeable terms; see for instance Poem 303 "Xuan niao" in the Shi jing , and the "Tang shi" chapter in the Shang shu. Quoted by Kong Yingda in his annotation of the Record of Rites ; see Liji zhengyi , eds. Li Xueqin et al., 3 vols. (Beijing: Beijing daxue chubanshe, 1999), 2:766. It may be noted that some homonyms of "Di" share a meaning of "origin" or "basis" - di (root of tree), di (base of fruit), di (base) - suggesting that "Di" (Lord) may refer to the world's "originating ancestor". See the drawings given in Zhan Yinxin, Shenling yu jisi - Zhongguo chuantong zong- jiao zonglun , 26, 45. Cf. He Xingliang, Zhongguo ziranshen yu ziran chongbai , 30-31, 47. 42 See He Xingliang, ibid, 54. In support of his interesting if inconclusive speculation, He quotes a statement from the "Oath at Gan" (Gan shi) in the Shang shu - "Heaven thus terminates its charge [given to the Youhu]; now I just carry out Heaven's punish- ment" - which is also cited by Mo zi in ch.31 "Ming gui: xia" and ch. 16 "Jian ai: xia" J AH 37/1 (2003)</page><page sequence="14">46 CHARLES K.WONG of the varying importance of Nature's deities,43 and the development of a commanding monarch on earth, both encouraged the idea of an ultimate lord in Heaven. In any case, the idea of Shangdi (Lord-on-High) was firmly in place by Shang times, as an absolute transcendence with both socio-political authority and power over Nature. Of the two aspects, it is the latter that had greater existential bearing on Shang society (a brief words will be said on the former later), and so inspired the primitive imagination more actively. Now if the potency, mystery, importance and capriciousness of Na- ture's elements led the ancients to visualize it as a realm controlled by deities with will, it would be possible to coax the right agents to behave appropriately and seasonably through respectful supplication on multiple fronts. The excerpts cited above, for instance, show the Shang people ap- pealing to Lord-on-High, river and mountain gods as well as ancestors (1) for Nature's cooperation: most basically, praying for sufficient as well as seasonable rain so that all cultivated regions may yield an abundant crop (4, 10, 2, 9, 6).44 Since the timing and amount of rainfall affect the variety of crop to be planted to suit the weather conditions,45 there are divinations about whether or not the rainfall will facilitate the growth of a particular crop (5). If rain does not come seasonably, the Shang people will wonder if Lord-on-High or their own ancestors have sent down calamity (3, 7); of the book that bears his name. As supplementary evidence, He also uses ancient Xiongnu, Turk and Mongol concepts to argue that the term describing a heavenly re- ality above one's head is the same as that designating a heavenly overlord. From speculating that the Xia people worship Tian, He goes on to say that the Shang people worship Shangdi as their overlord because they did not want to worship the overlord of a people they conquered (p. 55). 43 No doubt because of its commanding position in the sky and its functional importance to human life, the sun often took precedence over other heavenly bodies and agents in the pantheon of nature deities. 44 Many Nature deities were worshipped because of their relationship to the central issue of rainfall: clouds and wind, which bring rain; mountains, where clouds and wind may reside; rivers, where the dragon god as rain-bearer resides. 45 Dong Zuobin has concluded that during Shang times the weather was rainy in summer and dry in winter and spring. See "Zaitan Yindai qihou"(1946), collected in his Dong Zuobin xiansheng quanji , 1st and 2nd series in 12 vols. (Banqiao: Yiwen yinshuguan, 1977), vol.8, 518-40. Cf. Yinxu de faxian yu yanjiu, 436, which tabulates the number of divinations about rain made in different months of the year as recorded on the ora- cle bones. The table shows the highest divination occurrences during mid-spring to mid-summer, which, of course, does not necessarily indicate the relative amounts of rain fallen during those months. J AH 37/1 (2003)</page><page sequence="15">NATURE AND RELIGION IN ANCIENT CHINESE POETRY 47 conversely, they also appeal to Shangdi and the earth gods to stop exces- sive rain and pray for the weather to clear up (8, 11). In short, weather conditions from drought to flood were regarded not as natural meteoro- logical phenomena, but as willed decisions made by Lord-on-High and his assistants. The divination statements show the Shang people deeply awed by a deified Nature, while at the same time trying to understand, adapt to, and even influence supernatural will. As a mystical response attempting to gauge the unknown, divination was practised long before the Shang era.46 By Shang times divination was used in combination with sacrificial appeal. For if divination represents a relatively passive mode of probing Nature's operations, sacrificing, as we have seen, signals an active endeavor to manage Nature in order to pro- tect human livelihood. Sacrificial songs and incantations, music and dance, are all means employed to this end. For instance, the Spring and Autumn Annals ofLü (Lüshi chunqiu) relates how "in the ancient times of Zhuxiang... winds roared and the yang air built up, so everything fell apart and no fruition came", and how a person named Shida "devised a five-stringed zither to bring forth the yin air and stabilize life." The same text also describes how "in the early times of [Yinkang] the yin force lay stagnant and amassed, water channels were blocked up and unable to flow through the plains, people were depressed and stagnant in spirit while cowered in body; so dance was created in order to release the force."47 In other words, the invention of musical instruments and dance was prompted by a need to harmonize the yin and yang forces and to di- rect climatic changes, so that fruits and grains will ripen and all forms of life can thrive normally. Whatever their actual utility may be, such con- ceptions reflect an imaginative endeavor to adjust the operations of Na- ture with the power of magic. Having developed music, dance and poetry during group labor and feeling the need to contend against Nature's in- clemencies, the ancient Chinese conceptualized a sense of collective in- spiration and strength experienced in the acts of singing, dancing and po- etry chanting, imagining these as generating a power able to overcome Nature's agents. It was probably under these circumstances that sacrificial rituals gradually took shape. 46 Oracle bones using animal scapula have been found in various culture sites of the 3rd millenium BC; see Su Bingqi, ed., Zhongguo tongshi, vol. 2, 340-41 . See Chen Qiyou, annot., Lüshi chunqiu jiaoshi, 1 :284, with "Yinkang" emended for "TaoTang"; ibid., 1:290, n.15.

For while "Dark bird" suggests the totemistic worship of an original ancestor50 reminiscent of Poem 303 "Xuan niao" in the Shi jing ("Heaven bade the dark bird/ To descend and bear the Shang"), it is unlikely for notions of Lord-on-High and Heaven to have taken root during the times of a ruler supposedly predating Fuxi; both ex- amples exhibit an anachronistic mixing of elements that comes from ret- rospective narration. Still, one can see from the structural outline of the "Getian compositions" that they include dancing with oxtails, music with foot-stepping to measure the beat, and song words covering various as- 48 Ibid, 1:284. In his Liishi chunqiu jiaozheng , Bi Yuan emended "da" as "jian" (establishing) (6th song) and "wanwu" as "qinshou" (animals) (8th song), which does not alter the main tenor of the songs; ibid., 1:289, nn.14-15. For discussions of the "Getian Compositions", See Yang Yinliu, Zhongguo gudai yinyue shigao , 2 vols. (Beijing: Renmin yinyue chubanshe, 1981), 1:56; Wu Zhao and Liu Dongsheng, Zhongguo yinyue shiliie (Beijing: Renmin yinyue chubanshe, 1983), 3-5; Zhao Peilin, Xing de yuanqi - lis hi jidianyu shige yishu (Beijing: Zhongguo shehui kexue chuban- she, 1987), 141-59, 165-78. Getian is a legendary ruler of remote antiquity. For instance, the first song "Zai min" has been interpreted to mean "[the Earth that] sustains people"; see Luo Kun and Zhang Yongshan, Zhongguo xiao tongshi: yuanshi shehui , 445. Apart from Zhan Yinxin's Shenling yu jisi noted above, other discussions of totem worship in primitive-age China can be found in Xu Shunzhan, Zhongyuan yuangu wenhua, 406-37; Zhao Peilin, Xing de yuanqi, 132-40; Zhang Songru, ed., Zhongguo shige shi-XianQin liangHan , 23-33. Note that totem worship far preceded any belief in Tian or Shangdi, which represents a more abstract and sophisticated visualization.

They sing of the origin of their ancestors, recapture the process of labor, pray for the growth of plants and grains, affirm their respect for Nature's laws, and convey their wish to actualize Lord-on-High 's blessing by bringing everything to fruition: in sum, the ancients express a range of hopeful sentiments and beliefs arising from their experience with Nature. As the purpose of the music, dance and poetry was to communicate with Lord- on-High in order to fulfill human wishes, the compositions can be legiti- mately seen as sacrificial rituals in spirit. The motive behind such activities is evidently pragmatic. This is re- flected in a passage in the Record of Rites, which explains in unambigu- ous terms the purpose behind the important "Zha" sacrifice in ancient ag- ricultural society: The Zha sacrifice was begun by Yiqi [Shennong]; "zha" means to seek. It takes place in the twelfth month of the year51 and brings together all the spirits, making of- ferings to them and seeking their blessing. The Zha sacrifice is made first to the god who founded agriculture, and then to the god in charge of it. Offering is made to the god of the hundred grains in gratitude for the harvests; to the spirits of field officials, farm sheds, field paths, birds and animals as a matter of benevolence and justice. The lords of old always requited those they made use of. The spirit of the cat is received because it devours field voles; that of the tiger is received because it devours field boars. ... Offering is made to the spirits of the dykes and water ditches because of their 52 contribution to husbandry. 51 The 12th lunar month of the Zhou calendar is equivalent to the 10th lunar month of the earlier Xia calendar which is still in use today; see Yang Bojun, Chunqiu Zuo- zhuan zhu , rev. ed., 4 vols. (Beijing: Zhonghua shuju, 1990), 1:302, 310, comment on 5th year of Duke Xi (655 BC). This equivalence can be seen in references to the Zha sacrifice in the "first month of winter" in ch.6 "Yue ling" of the Li ji' see Zhu Bin, Liji xunzuan , 1:276. Other references to the Zha sacrifice can be found in the Zuo zhuan (Yang, op. cit., 1:310), the Zhou li (under "Chunguan disan", statement on "Yuezhang"; "Xiaguan disi", statement on "Luoshi"), and other places in the Li ji (ch.9 "Li yun" and ch.21 "Za ji: xia", where Confiicius's student Zigong notes how the people of the whole state become wildly excited during this sacrificial festival; re- spectively in Zhu Bin, ibid, 1:331, 2:650). 52 Ch. 11 "Jiao te sheng"; see Zhu Bin, ibid, 1:397-98. The Li ji is a collection of Confu- cian treatises accumulated during the 4th to 2nd centuries BC, and scholars have long observed that its descriptions of ancient institutions in Zhou and earlier times need to be used with caution. See Zhang Hequan, Zhoudai jisiyanjiu (Taipei: Wenjin chuban- she, 1993), 3-4; for a detailed discussion of the formation and dating of the three ritual texts of the Ti li , Zhou li and Li ji, see Qian Xuan, SanLi tonglun (Nanjing: Nanjing J AH 37/1 (2003)</page><page sequence="18">50 CHARLES KWONG « mm ' ñ+~ñ - • ±;$fe^f7níŘH]#{h, &gt; - M9¿ ' ' iSïfR ' ' H Žffitil • írži^ř ' ÍĚŽ&amp;ÍRŽ : fflfœ • ÄÄÄEaÄÄ » Ä » ». ' »til • The most remarkable thing about the worship ritual here is perhaps the inclusion of humanly constructed objects like field paths and farm sheds, underscoring both an animistic perception of the world and a close con- cern for agricultural matters. For simply stated, sacrificing to the found- ing and supervising deities of agriculture, to the gods of the soil, grains and fields, even to the spirits of animals, dykes and ducts, is all because of their perceived contribution to agrarian livelihood. As a general obser- vation on religious rituals in the Conversations of the States (Guo yu) ex- plains even more explicitly, [We sacrifice to] the gods of the land, grains, mountains and waters because of their merit to the people; . . .to the three bodies of Heaven because people revere them; to the five agents of Earth because they are the source of production; and to the famous mountains, rivers and lakes of the nine regions because they are the source of wealth and utility. If not for these reasons there would be no sacrificial ceremonies.53 ; • Rřmmím * Rmžī.n ' ' ÄÄM&amp;UJjilü ' 1 » » Primitive sacrifices are essentially sacrifices to various elements and agents of Nature, originating from humankind's subsistence needs and hopes for a secure livelihood. If we keep in mind the above explanations of sacrifices, we will realize that while Nature seems to have taken on a supernatural flavor in primi- tive China, the purity of the religious perception is far from certain. On shifan daxue chubanshe, 1996), 3-52. Nevertheless, the Li ji still offers valuable in- formation on many ideas, rituals, and practices in ancient China, especially when cor- roborated by other reliable historical records or known cultural-historical contexts. For instance, concepts of the Five Agents' operations and of appropriate actions to be fol- lowed during the seasons can be traced back to the Shang oracle bones.

As noted above, primitive religious poetry in China can be rightfully seen as an extension of the labor songs inspired by early agrar- ian experience. Even the "musical compositions of Getian", with only their titles extant, can be properly taken as sacrificial songs derived from labor experience; pieces like "Letting the grasses and trees grow" and "Rousing the five grains" can be expected to resemble the "Zha Song" and "Sacrificial prayer to the field god" in import, with Nature's spirits being both objects of worship and agents of utility. Originating thus from the hopes and needs surrounding primitive liveli- hood, religious rituals and poetry in ancient China reflect a dual attitude to Nature rooted in pragmatism. As the examples cited above variously dem- onstrate, Nature is visualized as a host of awesome yet manageable spirits, which must be worshipped and appeased but may be harnessed through ritual and language to fulfill the wishes of humans, to protect them from harm and guarantee their livelihood pursuits. As the labor songs vividly transmit knowledge and production experience, it is not difficult to see how they can be intensified and elevated to a religious level. Keeping in mind the oxtail dance and song sequence in the "Getian musical composi- tions", one can imagine how singing and dancing to them around a fire, perhaps under a bright moon, twinkling stars or even a resonant setting, easily conjures up a magical atmosphere that seems to exude some collec- tive power, which can be used not only to supplicate but to call upon Na- ture's spirits to facilitate human purposes. It is likely that a number of labor songs thus came to be modified into sacrificial songs or incantations and in- tegrated into religious rituals. Along with music and dance, poetry enabled the ancients to incorporate a supernaturalized Nature into the human mode of life, maintaining with it a relationship of mutual respect and benefit. This fusion of experience and longing into a pragmatically religious outlook on Nature is even more evident in some of the earliest poems in the Shi jing. Indeed, there are a number of poems in the xiaoya, dynastic songs in the daya, as well as hymns and eulogies in the song sections that reflect a religious consciousness of Nature more coherently developed and clearly expressed. These poems show that like their Shang predeces- sors, the Zhou (c. 1046-256 BC) people held certain religious beliefs in relation to their agricultural existence. Central to these is the conception of a supreme deity in Nature called Di or Shangdi, who has appeared in Shang oracle bones as an anthropomorphic tribal Lord (possibly the chief god of the ruling family) actively regulating the operation of human af- JAH 37/1 (2003)</page><page sequence="20">52 CHARLES KWONG fairs.54 For the early Zhou people, Shangdi continues to perform such wide-ranging functions as bestowing Heaven's charge (#235 "Wen wang" and #241 "Huang yi"), dispensing blessings and calamities (#245 "Sheng min"), giving protection in battles and sanctioning undertakings (#236 "Da ming"). But it is above all in his protection of the agrarian economy that his principal role is to be found. In fact, the Zhou people try to bond themselves with Nature by claim- ing direct descent from Lord-on-High, through the dynastic legend of their first ancestor Hou Ji (#245). The latter is supposed to have been mythically conceived when his mother treaded on the big toe of Shangdi's footprint,55 and his semi-divine stature is confirmed when he is shielded by animals, birds and humans from successive attempts to abandon him in his infancy. It can be seen that the distinction between humans and animals is not very sharp yet (one recalls early Han visual representations of Fuxi and Niiwa as half-human, half-animal creatures,56 and how in 54 See Chen Mengjia, Tinxu buci zongshu , 561-73, esp. 571. As Chen notes, the Shang people made divinations about a comprehensive range of topics, including agriculture, war, settlement, and the king's actions. Sarah Allan groups the oracle bone inscriptions into 3 general categories by content: divinations about ritual offerings, the future (including divinations about Nature, divinations about proposed activities of the king and his associates, and divinations stating that misfortune will not occur within a given time period), and calamities which have already happened. See her The Shape of the Turtle: Myth, Art, and Cosmos in Early China (Albany: State Univ. of New York Press, 1991), 114-20. Cf.

See their Zhongguo xiao tongshi: yuanshi shehui , 411-12.

The earliest textual documentations can be found in Wang Yi's annotation of "Tian wen" in the Chu ci: "Niiwa has a human head and a snake's body", and in Wang Yanshou's "Lu Ling- guangdian fu": "Fuxi has a scaly body, while Niiwa has a serpentine one." As the Ling- guang Palace belonged to Li Yu, Prince of Lugong (154-127 BC), Wang's description is of a decoration in a Former Han structure, pointing to the considerably earlier origins of the myth about the half-human, half-animal forms of Fuxi and Niiwa.

Since the intractable agents of Nature may not function according to human wish, humanity can "bypass" them and link up directly with the ultimate deity who reigns over all, appealing to him to deal with the inclement aspects of Nature beyond human control. In Poem 275 "Si Wen" Hou Ji is further elevated to an agricultural deity whose "virtue is worthy of Heaven", and whose achievement lies precisely in Giving us wheat and barley, [ jH À] ^ ' Following Di's command to nurture all, » Without concern of frontier, MjtbitW J?- ' But spreading them throughout Xia [China]. ° J AH 37/1 (2003)</page><page sequence="22">54 CHARLES KWONG In other words, Hou Ji is visualized as one who follows divine com- mand in spreading the blessing of husbandry to all. Di is the directing de- ity who sustains humankind, while in both identity and achievement Hou Ji is the embodiment of a unity between cosmic-religious Nature and hu- manity.57 The longing has expanded in scope to cover all Chinese, but the basic pragmatic impulse remains the same. It was established practice by early Zhou times for the king alone to of- fer sacrifices to Shangdi or Heaven; statements like "the Son of Heaven offers sacrifices to Heaven and Earth, while princes offer sacrifices to gods of the soil and grains" can be found in a number of texts.58 Beneath Heaven, of course, in an effort to strengthen their ties with Nature, the pantheistic Zhou king and feudal princes also sacrificed to their ancestors and a host of natural bodies and agents bearing on agricultural life,59 both 57 As a "historical" figure, Hou Ji is identified as the agricultural minister of Emperors Yao and Shun, being more or less contemporaneous with them as well as with Yu (ancestor of the Xia) and Xie (ancestor of the Shang). In particular, Yao, Xie, and Hou Ji are all supposedly sons of Emperor Ku (or Jun), great-grandson of the Yellow Em- peror.

Such sacrifices were held throughout the seasons,60 and the natural objects of worship include gods of the sun, moon and stars, wind and rain (heavenly deities), mountains, rivers, forests and lakes in the king's and princes' respective territories, and, most visibly in the Clas- sic of Poetry , gods of the earth and grains (earthly deities). Poems 290 "Zai shan" and 291 "Liang si", for instance, are generally taken as sacri- ficial songs entreating the earth and grain gods in spring and offering thanks to them in autumn: They clear the grass, they cut the trees, ScîÊÎIcfë ' Their tilling loosens up the ground. ° In a thousand pairs they weed and plow, » Along the lowlands, along the ridges.

Mao's prefaces to the individual poems regard the theme of "Zai shan" as "turning the fields and supplicating the earth and grain gods in spring", and that of "Liang si" as "offering thanks to the earth and grain gods in autumn".61 Whether the two poems can be so dis- 61 See Wang Xianqian, Shi sanjia yi jishu , 2 vols. (Taipei: Shijie shuju, 1957), 2:360b and 362a; Wang also observes that the other three early commentators are agreed on the theme of the poems. For an overview of previous discussions of the poems' J AH 37/1 (2003)</page><page sequence="25">NATURE AND RELIGION IN ANCIENT CHINESE POETRY 57 tinctly designated in this way is a matter for discussion.62 In terms of tex- tual attention, though, one finds ten out of thirty-one lines (11. 22-31) in the former and four out of twenty-three lines (11. 20-23) in the latter re- lated to sacrificial praying, so that the sense of supplication is stronger in "Zai shan". On the other hand, descriptions of grain harvesting and stor- ing occupy three lines in Poem 290 (11. 19-21) and seven lines in Poem 291 (11. 13-19), so that the sense of bountiful return is more visible in the latter. This secondary difference in focus is in line with Mao's view of the poems as complementary pieces that address the whole agricultural cycle. In fact, these poems seem to have kept the flavor of primitive sacrificial songs such as the "sacrificial prayer to the field god" quoted above. For apart from their prayer-like endings, these poems are essentially realistic re-creations and celebrations of agricultural life, suggesting that they too may be outgrowths and refinements of primitive labor songs, preserved because they came to form part of a religious ritual.63 Whatever tough challenge Nature may offer humankind from year to year, she is depicted here as an orderly and benevolent reality chiming in with the human labor cycle. Nurturing a religious sense of reverence for farming work and pro- duction64 while linking agricultural to human fertility, the sacrificial songs meanings, see Cheng Junying and Jiang Jianyuan, Shijing zhuxi, 2:980-81, 985; Chen Zizhan, Shijing zhijie, 2 vols. (Shanghai: Fudan daxue chubanshe, 1983), 2:1130-32, 1135-36. Note that there are three identical stock lines in the poems: 11.12-14 in #290 and 11.2-4 in #291. 62 It has been argued, for instance, that "Zai shan" is a sacrificial song offering thanks to ancestors; see Li Shan, Shijing de wenhua jingshen (Beijing: Dongfang chubanshe, 1997), 44-45. Since supplication and thanksgiving are equally important and mutually succeeding elements in the continuing agricultural cycle, they often appear together in the same sacrificial song, and it is not always easy to determine conclusively whether a particular song is written for a spring or autumn ritual. Nor is it easy to tell if a sacri- fice is meant for Shangdi or for ancestors, since the latter are typically seen as part of the celestial pantheon. When a primitive labor song is integrated with music and dance to form a component of a sacrificial ritual, the song will be better preserved as part of a religious tradition. To Yang Gongji, this is similar to the fact that "the 'Song of Songs' sung during Catholic rituals [today] is similar to its old form 1200 years ago, showing the conser- vative nature of sacrificial songs. Thus the preservation of primitive sacrificial songs in the Zhou period is really nothing surprising." See his Zhongguo wenxue , vol. 1, 54. This is also found in Poems 276 "Chen gong" and 277 "Yi xi." Cf. a passage in the "Zhou documents" in the Shang shu , which imparts a similar ethical and socio- political message: "Prince, do not indulge in pleasures. Know the hardships of plant- ing and harvest before you enjoy pleasures, then you will know the suffering of the people ("Wu yi")." J AH 37/1 (2003)</page><page sequence="26">58 CHARLES KWONG represent a ritualistic attempt to perpetuate a sense of cooperation be- tween Nature and humanity, fortify a positive work ethic,65 as well as strengthen a feeling of solidarity among social classes. The Nature- humanity relationship carries at once material, religious, ethical, and so- cio-political significance. This humanistic shift in the Nature-humankind dynamic is worthy of attention. Arising from an intensified wish to guarantee an agrarian mode of livelihood, the visualization and worshipping of an ancestor-overlord of Nature offered in turn a sacred underpinning to agriculture: it was "Di's command to nurture all" with "wheat and barley" (#275 "Si Wen"). By extension of thought, this vision of Nature also came to sanction an ethical, social and political code that, like agriculture itself, calls for in- dustriousness, vigilance, and cooperation. The pragmatic sentiment be- hind the religious perception of Nature thus assumed multiple dimensions and an increasingly rational character; witness the ardent prayer in Poem 2 1 1 "Fu tian", another sacrificial song:66 Far-stretching are those large fields; P9 &gt; Every year we obtain tons.... Some are weeding, others are hoeing; ' The millets are lush and dense.... IIS®!! With our sacrificial grains 9 And our bullocks and sheep, » We honor the gods of the earth and the quarters.... We play zithers and beat drums ' To welcome the Field Progenitor,67 P9ÍH. ' To beg for sweet rain ' That helps our millets grow, ' So we may feed our children. ° 65 Such a refrain runs through contemporary farming songs as well, which often sing of industrious effort and a clement Nature combining to produce bountiful harvests, hence invigorating and uplifting the working spirit in the process. For some examples of such songs, see Long Yusheng and Wang Jiying, eds., Guizhou minjian geyao , 217 ("Haoyang ge"), 231-34 ("Jijie ge"), 235-38 ("Zhongdao ge"), 243-44 ("Jijie ge"); lines like "families all work hard at production" or "with favorable wind and rain the barns are filled with grains" are representative in import. 66 Among other agricultural poems in the Shi jing , #209 ("Chu ci"), #210 ("Xin Nan- shan"), #212 ("Da tian") and #279 ("Feng nian") are also sacrificial songs. Possibly the "Divine Farmer" Shennong or "the previous harvest". See respectively Cheng Junying and Jiang Jianyuan, Shijing zhuxi, 2:670; Arthur Waley, trans., The Book of Songs, ed.

' ••• The field supervisors are most happy .... pg ļ£ ° • • • The Descendant is not upset, ' The farm laborers have worked nimbly. ° This poem typifies a number of celebratory songs in which assiduous labor, conscientious supervision, hierarchical concord and Nature's blessing combine to deliver happy rewards and lives. Stable harvests (when they are not disrupted) and religious rituals fortify an already close sense of affinity to Nature, while to celebrate harmony with Nature is to affirm harmony within humanity.68 With the development of a multidimensional outlook on Nature both religious and rational in spirit, human situations are often gauged on the basis of natural phenomena, as the poems in the Shi jing variously dem- onstrate. On one level, for instance, the strength of rulership and the sta- bility of society are often expressed in terms of Nature's celestial order; the king's virtue and the people's happiness in terms of the vegetation's lushness, the mountains' stature and the rivers' flow. The natural imagery employed in Poem 166 "Tian bao", a ritualistic song praying for Heaven's blessing on all and its guardianship of the king's virtue, offers a clear ex- ample of such a perception: May Heaven guard and support you, ' Let everything about you flourish: Like the hills and the plateaus, #p |JL|#P-Ķ ' Like the ridges and the mountain ranges; #p |S]#p » Like a river with swelling water, #pj 1 1 ' With nothing that does not add fortune.... ° ••• Like the waxing of the moon, ' Like the rising of the sun; #p g ; Like the lastingness of the southern mountains, #PS[ll/¿!f ' That knows no ruin or decay. o Like the lushness of the pine and the cypress - #p ' May all your blessings go on! ° 68 One modern scholar is of the view that in the course of the Western Zhou, the rulers' emphasis on agriculture increasingly became a conservative cultural strategy serving the purpose of social and political administration; see Li Shan, Shijing de wenhua jingshen , 39. J AH 37/1 (2003)</page><page sequence="28">60 CHARLES KWONG Through a series of analogies drawn with the human situation, natural phenomena have taken on a symbolic significance beyond their agrarian relevance. It will also be noticed that in "Tian bao" the notion of an ultimate tran- scendence overseeing Nature and humankind has shifted from Shangdi to Tian, marking another aspect of a growing humanistic reading of Nature. Some scholars are of the view that "Lord-on-High" and "Heaven" are similar in their providential nature and roles: creating the myriad things in the world, determining the destiny of society, deciding the ruling man- date, setting the standards of conduct, and arbitrating human fortune or calamity.69 The relationship and evolutionary dynamic between Shangdi and Tian is a complex subject that properly calls for a separate study.70 Suffice it to note that in his human concerns as envisioned by the an- cients, the Shangdi of Shang is more of a tribalized ancestral deity over- seeing the welfare of a specific group,71 whereas the Tian of Zhou is a more universalized and impartial entity governing the destinies of all, at once a cosmic moral order and an active transcendence upholding right and justice. In Poem 303 "Xuan niao", one of the Shang people's sacrifi- cial hymns, Shangdi is simply cast as having decreed His "chosen peo- ple" in socio-political terms: Heaven bade the dark bird ' To descend and bear the Shang, ... ' • • • Of old Lord[-on-High] bade the soldierly Tang ífrfriftÃSI ' To conquer the four quarters .... 'mýj ° Yin received a charge that was all fitting; ' A hundred blessings it bore. H'fftílípj ° Whereas the focus here is on the special status (rather than the merits) of Shang as chosen by Heaven or Lord-on-High, the Zhou deity's bless- ing is a more universal one that exceeds tribal bounds: it was "Di's com- mand to nurture all/ Without concern of frontier " (my emphasis). More importantly, it appears that in the course of the early Zhou, the concept of a religious Nature manageable through a personal deity was 69 See He Xingliang, Zhongguo ziranshen yu ziran chongbai , 55-58. 70 For a detailed discussion of the Chinese religious outlook before Zhou times and the concepts of "Tian" and "Di " in the Shi jing and the Shu jing , see Fu Peirong, Rudao tianlun fawei (Taipei: Taiwan xuesheng shuju, 1985), 1-70. In their Zhongguo gudai de jisi (Beijing: Shangwu yinshuguan guoji youxian gongsi, 1996), Liu Yeyuan and Zheng Huijian characterize the Shangdi of Shang as one of force, and the Shangdi of Zhou as one of morals (pp. 38-45). J AH 37/1 (2003)</page><page sequence="29">NATURE AND RELIGION IN ANCIENT CHINESE POETRY 6 1 gradually supplanted by a cosmic Nature of a humanistic temper, at the bidding of a transcendence guided less by claims of descent than by con- siderations of virtue and effort.72 Poem 235 "Wen wang" describes King Wen "shining bright in Heaven.../ At the side of Lord-on-High", and writes at once of "Heaven's charge" and "Lord-on-High's charge", re- flecting a time when "Tian/Tianming" and "Di/Diming" were used inter- changeably as terms inherited from the Shang. Yet even here one can see a universalizing expansion of perception and a shift in understanding from religious belief to philosophical conception.73 Note the praise of Hou Ji for carrying out Di's blessing on all, and the tone of self- vigilance in the general exhortation in "Wen wang": Heaven's charge is not constant, . . . ' ••• Cultivate your virtue. ° Always accord with the charge, TklíljEfà ' And seek blessings for yourself. ... § The charge is not easy to keep, J? ' Do not bring ruin on yourselves. MíSWJB ° Make goodness shine bright and far, jĒBgļifn] » Consider Heaven's treatment of Yin[-Shang]. g ^ ° The actions of High Heaven ' Come without sound or smell. Il ° Such a religio-philosophical conception (the two senses are not yet clearly distinguished) of "Tianming " or "Diming " has extended far be- yond tribal protection to include general ethico-political judgment. Feel- ing that "Heaven watches the world below" (#236 "Da ming"), the Zhou people remind themselves to "Respect the wrath of Heaven,/ Dare not be trivial;/ Respect the shifts of Heaven,/ Dare not venture wild" (#254 "Ban"). As many of the "Zhou documents" in the Shang shu emphasize and reiterate, Heaven can always transfer its charge from a bad king claiming celestial descent, to an "outsider" with the virtue to honor a ruler's responsibility. "Wen wang" reveals a mode of thinking that per- ceives the world in ethical terms; the entire domain of Nature under 72 This shift in emphasis is best understood in a relative sense. For instance, Shang 's conquest of Xia and relocation of its capital to Yin are consistently justified in terms of Heaven's moral decree, which may or may not have been an interpolated addition by later Confucianists. See, inter alia , pieces like "Tang shi", "Tang gao" and "Pan geng" in the Shang shu. 73 One is reminded of Auguste Comte 's positi vistic observation that human thought moved from a theological to a metaphysical stage, before progressing to a positive or scientific stage. J AH 37/1 (2003)</page><page sequence="30">62 CHARLES KWONG Heaven has become, if not a universe of moral determinism, at least a transcendence-directed reality with a keen moral sense and will.74 On a cosmological plane, this humanistic perception of Nature also means that natural phenomena came to be seen as messages conveying Heaven's will. Especially given their awareness that "the actions of High Heaven" can "come without sound or smell", the Zhou people become even more "respectful of the shifts of Heaven" concretized by natural phenomena. Poem 193 "Shiyue zhijiao", for instance, demonstrates the Zhou belief in a resonance between the celestial and terrestrial worlds, so that disintegration of the human order will call forth natural calamities from Heaven: The sun and moon foretell disaster; 0 ft ļķ[XJ » They have left their normal course. ÂÍT ° The four regions are not well-governed; El ' They do not use their good men. ... ÄJl ° * * * Lightning flashes, thunder roars, 9 There is no peace, no order. ° The hundred rivers swell and overflow, ~S) 1 1 ' Mountain peaks shatter and crumble. ° Lofty cliffs become valleys; » Deep valleys turn into hills. ° Alas, people of today - ' Why do you not stop? ? Increasingly, Nature's agents and manifestations are more than agri- culturally pertinent; they are morally and politically significant as well. Solar and lunar eclipses, thunder and lightning spurts, roaring seas and shattering mountains, earthquakes and land shifts - these are caused by misrule and the suppression of worthies. Whether the human chaos has mechanically upset the larger balance of the natural order or ideologi- cally caused Heaven to dispense punishment, Nature's abnormal and ca- lamitous manifestations have become both symptoms of evil rule and a medium of Heaven's warning, awaiting the ruler's amendment before they will cease.75 74 Most of the "Zhou documents" in the Shang shu also reflect this moral vision of Heaven. Poem 264 "Zhan yang" exhorts King You of Zhou "not to bring shame to your august ancestors,/ To save those after you", showing that matters can always be amended, and that Heaven's favor can still be won by reformed conduct. This reflects a common moral impulse shared by the Shi jing poets. J AH 37/1 (2003)</page><page sequence="31">NATURE AND RELIGION IN ANCIENT CHINESE POETRY 63 Famine, likewise, is seen as a result of bad government. Amid frustra- tion and despair, one is often prompted to cry out to Heaven: Vast and vast is august Heaven, » Yet it does not extend its grace, 'FiítÂííl ° But rather sends down death and famine, ftÄMÄ ' Razing and ruining the four quarters. tfftffi H ° Heaven is storming with its might, ' It does not ponder, does not plan. ° It leaves the guilty ones alone, ilríStíífl ' Covering up their sins and crimes. o As for those who are blameless, » They are mired in suffering. Ôfôi° (#194 "Yu wu zheng") Heaven is storming with its might; * It has sent down grievous ruin. ° We are struck by hunger and famine; íSífelÜfi ' People are fleeing one and all, ° Homes and borders are all forlorn. ° Heaven has cast down a web of blame, » Pests are fighting among themselves. ° (#265 "Shao min") Where the ruler inverts right and wrong, good and evil, Heaven's jus- tice will "raze and ruin the four quarters"; where people are tyrannized by "harsh punishment" and "pests [i.e. ministers] fight among themselves", Heaven will make "people flee one and all."76 In the understanding of the ancients, natural disasters are cosmic echoes of the human condition and manifestations of Heaven's will. Although innocent people seem to be suffering for the evil conduct of their rulers, so that the two poems are not without tones of complaint and bewilderment, the overall sentiment is not one of bitterness against Heaven (or Nature). As Poem 264 "Zhan yang" observes, "Chaos is not sent down from Heaven, /But bred by... women" and other human "pests".77 Sima Qian (140-90 BC?) says one cries out to 76 There are also poems in the Shi jing which appeal to Heaven to relieve drought condi- tions without implying political criticism, e.g. #258 "Yun han" writes of the Zhou King praying to the gods for rain. Cf. similar views expressed in Poem 193 "Shiyue zhi jiao": "The suffering of the peo- ple below/ Is not sent down by Heaven", and in Poem 192 "Zhengyue": "Brilliant is the House of Zhou, /Baosi destroys it!" Stephen Owen sees the world of the Shi jing as "a world with anxiety but without terror: there is no incomprehensible divinity, god J AH 37/1 (2003)</page><page sequence="32">64 CHARLES KWONG Heaven in suffering and to parents in pain,78 and indeed in the Shi jing one often hears voices crying out to "vast, vast Heaven" or to "azure Heaven far and high". Whether the "Heaven" in such contexts refers to celestial transcendence or to the ruler,79 often "crying out to Heaven is speaking out against the king",80 directly or indirectly conveying the poet's indignation or sadness over a state of affairs. Far from being an inimical transcendence and an object of bitterness, Nature as "azure Heaven Far and high" often becomes the final listener to whom human- kind pours out his grief against the executive of Heaven's charge - the last authority to whom people appeal for justice and mercy to remedy an intolerable situation.81 To sum up, we can see from the limited number of extant poems that the earliest Chinese response to Nature began on a pragmatic level, with attention only to those specific items directly related to livelihood pur- suits. With the expansion of the human imagination, a strengthening of humanity's wish to direct its own destiny, and a shift in subsistence mode from food appropriation to food production, supernatural visualizations of Nature developed along with rituals of divination and sacrifice, but the basic outlook on Nature remains pragmatic. We have seen how primitive sacrificial songs and incantations are outgrowths of labor songs, for stripped of their religious prayers or magical ritualistic edifice, they rep- resent crystallizations of practical experience, attempts to overcome natu- ral disasters, and imaginative wishes to manage an awesome world. Using poetry as a tool, the ancient Chinese endeavored to overcome the intrac- the hunter, who tracks men down"; see his "Foreword" in Arthur Waley, trans., The Book of Songs , xxii. While not every natural disaster could be explained in morally comprehensible terms, the ancient Chinese certainly did not see the transcendental overlord of Nature as cruel, vengeful, or irrational. 78 Shi ji , ch. 84 "Biography of Qu Yuan and Jia Yi": "Human beings return to their roots in destitution. Thus one always cries out to Heaven in extreme suffering and weari- ness, and to parents in pain and grief'. See Sima Qian, Shi ji , 8:2482. In some poems of the Shi jing "Heaven" is sometimes only a cover-name for the ruler. In #194 "Yu wu zheng", the "Heaven" that "sends down death and famine" is cosmic Heaven, while the "Heaven" that "leaves the guilty ones alone" is the ruler. In #265 "Shao min", the "Heaven" that "sends down grievous ruin" is cosmic Heaven, while the Heaven that "casts down a web of blame" is the ruler. In #264 "Zhan yang" quoted above, there is also a "Heaven" which is but a cover-name for the ruler, and which is not the main concern here. See Wang Xianqian, Shi sanjiayi jishu , 2:251a (comment on #200 "Xiang bo"). There are many such examples in the Shi jing , e.g. #65 "Shu li", #121 "Bao yu", #191 "Jie Nanshan", #200 "Xiang bo", and #257 "Rou sang". J AH 37/1 (2003)</page><page sequence="33">NATURE AND RELIGION IN ANCIENT CHINESE POETRY 65 table forces of Nature by employing experience and invoking a mysteri- ous power through religious ritual and language. By the early songs of the Shi jing the Chinese imagination has expanded in both scope and depth, and the Nature-humanity relationship has grown in affinity: earlier notes of fear and contention have been replaced by a sense of harmony and co- operation, while tribally-conceived religious sentiments have given way to a more cosmic vision of Nature. Shifting from Shangdi to Tian with an added moral function besides protecting the agrarian economy, the lord of Nature has become a reality that serves as the last resort for humankind and the ultimate defender of justice. While as yet devoid of aesthetic con- sciousness, such a vision of Nature has extended from a localized percep- tion of practical needs to a macroscosmic outlook in religious and philo- sophical terms. In short, from initial attempts to master an awesome envi- ronment through utilizing experience and a felt magical potency in ritual language, the ancient Chinese have come to see in Nature a transcenden- tal reality to which they can link themselves and belong. Underlying their hopes in practical livelihood and their perception of the ruling mandate, encompassing both the material and supra-material domains, this vision of Nature is perhaps most notable for an emerging humanistic spirit. For even at their most imaginative the early Chinese were never over- religious or pastorally romantic: even in the song hymns, where a be- nevolent Nature, bountiful harvests and happy folks all form parts of an exultant ambience and thanksgiving tone, human effort and a spirit of self-reliance always remain the primary emphasis.82 In the final analysis, the constitution of the early poems serves as a parallel and as testimony to the consciousness of Nature informing them, as a blend of religious and secular, empirical and imaginary elements. Indeed, one cannot find in the Shi jing poems any passive appeal to Tian or Shangdi for blessing, without acknowledging the prerequisite of human effort itself.
