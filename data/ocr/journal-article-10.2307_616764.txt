Paris: Socidt6 d'Ethnographie, 1980. The area around Lake Chad was once charac- terized by A. W. Lawrence as 'the Carfax of Africa'. This was to draw attention to its crucial position on the east-west corridor south of the Sahara and at the southern terminus of the shortest north-south crossing of the desert. For the last 45 years Jean-Paul Lebeuf, to- gether with his wife, has been concerned with the archaeology and ethnography of that part of the area which lies to the south-east of the lake, around the lower valleys of the Chari- Logone system, lying principally in the Republic of Tchad, but also in northern Cameroun and north-eastern Nigeria. It is an area where, over the last three thousand years or so, sites of human occupation have tended to remain upon the same spot, partly on account of seasonal flooding. The practice of importing clay from elsewhere to build houses, and then to rebuild them after a comparatively short interval, has resulted in the creation of mounds after the fashion of Middle Eastern tells. Such sites have for long attracted the archaeolo- gist-but they need to be excavated with great care if erroneous conclusions are not to be drawn from the results. Schliemann was one of the first to investigate such a tell, when he dug into the mound of Hissarlik, the ancient Troy; but as he did not understand the prin- ciples of stratigraphy, he treated it as a one- period piece and was puzzled by finding neolithic stone axes along with examples of Bronze Age metallurgy. It was before World War II that Lebeuf began his excavating career in the Chad area, as assistant to Marcel Griaule, professor at the Sorbonne. Together they dug many cuttings and irregularly-shaped pits into the mounds and recovered a wealth of new and exciting material-large quantities of pottery, small anthropomorphic and theriomorphic figurines of terracotta, some iron work, bronze objects, less common than iron, worked bone and ivory, clay smoking pipes, and many human skele- tons. All these were carefully recorded and inventoried. Unfortunately the stratigraphical control of the digging was not all it might have been, and proper section-drawings were not made. At the same time ethnographic work was carried out among the modern inhabitants of the area and oral traditions collected from them, as a result of which the archaeological finds were attributed to the civilization of a rather mysterious legendary people called the 'Sao'. It has since been suggested that ' Sao ' is simply a generic name given by Muslims to a considerable variety of non-islamized inhabi- tants of the area. Nevertheless, the name has been retained, and indeed refined into a num- ber of' periods ' in Lebeuf's work. There was said to have been a series of invasions, of spear-carrying hunters from the north, of hunters armed with bows and arrows from the north, and of fisherfolk from the east. How the material culture discovered in the mounds was correlated with these different peoples remained obscure. After World War II the Lebeufs continued their work, resulting in a number of publi- cations, including the magnificently produced Carte archeologique des abords du Lac Tchad, published by C.N.R.S. in 1969, and which record a valuable and impressive quantity of field-</page><page sequence="2">202 REVIEWS work. The number of sites known in the area has now reached over 700, of which 637 are designated ' Sao'. Archdologie tchadienne in 1962 was principally an account of diggings and ethnographic work at the site of Makari, together with an essay on the chronology of the 'Sao ' sites, but without benefit of radiocarbon dates. The Sao were said to be a well- organized people establishing themselves in the area from the tenth century A.D. onwards, but who 'disappeared' under the Kanem/ Bornu kingdoms, or alternatively are repre- sented by the present-day Kotoko, said to be descended from the Sao. The time of Sao supremacy in the area was divided into three periods, not so much on the basis of strati- graphy as on the character of the mounds. A quarter of the mounds was attributed to a pre- Islamic Sao I period, being small mounds with no encircling defensive wall; the majority of the remaining mounds were Sao II--large mounds, still inhabited and with a surrounding wall, pre-Islamic at first, later Islamic; the Sao III period was said to be represented by small uninhabited mounds containing similar material but without surrounding walls. Because numbers of indigenously-made clay smoking-pipes were found in the mounds and a local tradition was collected that Datura metel was smoked before tobacco was intro- duced, Lebeuf asserted that the Sao were smoking before the discovery of America brought the habit to the Old World. A number of archaeologists were dissatisfied with Lebeuf's periodization into Sao I, II and III, and felt that it was not soundly based in stratigraphy. This dissatisfaction was in- creased after Graham Connah's careful excava- tions in the Daima mound in north-east Nigeria, which Lebeuf classified as a Sao site. Lebeuf's fellow-countryman, Raymond Mauny, expressed it thus in 1970: 'Non dat~es avec certitude non plus sont les trouvailles trbs importantes effectubes par J.-P. et A. Lebeuf en pays "sao" au Tchad: les plus anciennes statuettes peu- vent remonter au Moyen Age mais tant que nous ne connaitrons pas par le C 14 mais surtout par la stratigraphie des buttes et la d~couverte de "fossiles directeurs" ad&amp;- quats, la date du "Sao I, II et III ", il ne sera pas possible d'8tre fix4s h ce point de vue. Les fouilles effectubes tout pros de lh par G. Connah &amp; Daima sont venues h point nous apporter les donn~es stratigraphiques et les datations au C 14 correspondantes qui manquent plus h l'est, comme nous l'avons vu plus haut.' (Les siicles obscurs de l'Afrique noire, p. 205.) In fact, during the late 1960s a couple of dozen radiocarbon dates were obtained, seventeen of them from excavations carried out at Mdaga (also called Midigui, 14 km. north of Ndja- mena; not to be confused with two other sites in the area called Midigu6, one 8 km. north- west of Ndjamena and also called Madaga, and the other 32 km. south-south-seast of Man- delia). The publication under review is the excavation report of five seasons' excavations, and a subsequently-dug control pit, carried out at Mdaga. Part of its intention appears to be as a response to previous criticisms such as those quoted from Mauny. Schematic section drawings of most of the cuttings are provided, but their orientation does not always tally with the cutting plan, it is not clear whether undisturbed ground was always reached at the bottom, keys to symbols are sometimes absent or inconsistent, scales are sometimes lacking or inadequately indicated, and the table collating the different archaeological layers suggests intervening sterile layers not shown on the section drawings. The latter table (Tableau I) is of questionable value as all depths are taken from the surface of each particular cutting, regardless of the fact that the height of the surfaces above original ground level differs by as much as 3 m. Although there is an aerial photograph of the site it is difficult to identify it; and the caption does not help much; there is no general view of the mound from the ground, and one would have liked to see more excavation photographs of the kind which would help the reader to picture it and make his own evaluations. The mound was over 300 m. long, some 185 m. broad, but the height is not stated or clearly indicated; it appears to have been over 6 m. high, but the artificial accumulation may have occurred over a slight natural rise in the ground. Thirteen discontinuous excavation points were dug, but one does not know how reliable is the attempt to correlate their different levels in Table I. The radiocarbon samples, all of wood char- coal except one of' carbonised material ', were taken from four of the excavation points and were processed by two different laboratories, with the following results: Point IV Depth m 3.20 1040 ad ? 100 4.20 690 ad ? 100 4.90 425 be ? 125 Point VII Depth m 1 50 1620 ad ? 120 1.60 969 ad ? 117 1-80-2.00 567 ad ? 125 3.15 200 be c 135 Point VIII Depth m 0.90 1780ad ? 90 3.50 1156 ad ? 120 Point XII Depth m 1.00 1666 ad a 109 3 .80 1200 ad ? 95 4.20 1270 ad 95 This is a good set of radiocarbon dates, with no outstanding anomalies or serious inversions. However, they should be interpreted with caution when read against their depths, taken from different heights in different parts of the mound. The excavator supposes that the whole area of the mound was not occupied throughout its history, but that different areas were occupied by different groups at different times. Clearly, the elucidation of the complete history of one of these large mounds</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS 203 like Mdaga is a complicated business, requiring very large resources to do properly. Many burials were found in the mound, in urns, in habitations and away from habita- tions; but it was not possible to construct a chronology for these three different forms of disposal. Some thirty small terracotta figurines occurred, of animals from about 200 be and of humans after 1200 ad. (Compare Daima, where cattle figurines occurred from about 400 be, sheep from about 800 ad and humans from about 600 ad.) At Mdaga neither sheep not cattle could be positively identified, but there were fish, turtles, 'aquatic mammals' (? otters) and a hyaena. Clay smoking pipes came from levels attributed to the eleventh, twelfth and thirteenth centuries, and Lebeuf sticks to his contention that they were used for the smoking of Datura metel before the intro- duction of tobacco. Either the claim must be taken seriously or the stratigraphy and its dating must be regarded as unreliable. Curiously enough, the evidence on smoking pipes at Daima can be used to argue either for or against pre-Columbian smoking. Evidence for an iron technology came from a second-century be level, and would appear to confirm Connah's revised interpretation of the Daima radiocarbon dates in relation to the beginning of metallurgy (Three thousand years in Africa, pp. 146-7). Copper alloys do not make their appearance until the twelfth/ thirteenth century. The analyses given interestingly suggest a confirmation of a trend noted elsewhere in West Africa that ' bronze is earlier, brass is later '. Mdaga is claimed as the only mound in the area to have produced a considerable bone industry-but this dis- regards Daima, where the 'harpoons' were early in the sequence. All five harpoons from Mdaga came from the 'middle layers' of excavation Pointe XI, but we have no radio- carbon dates for this cutting, it is discon- tinuous from Pointes VII and IV, and so we have at the moment no satisfactory means of dating the harpoons. The approach to interpreting the excava- tions is more related to the finds and to oral traditions than to economy and ecology. The faunal remains are said to be too few to justify giving the numbers for each identified species, since, apart from 'les Boeufs et les Cobes de Buffon' each species is only repre- sented by a single individual. Nevertheless 'several dozen teeth can be attributed to cattle of the size of Bos taurus brachyceros'. Teeth of horse also occurred, but I could not discover where in the excavations these occurred nor what date was attributed to them-a matter of no little historical interest. From the evidence of the spindlewhorls, weaving is said to have been practised from the twelfth century. There seems to have been more evidence of fishing than of hunting; it is said that 'the inhabitants doubtless practised agriculture.' No comment is made on the implications of the material of three stone axes having come from Tibesti. Mdaga is called a Sao II site, but the issues raised by the radiocarbon dates in relation to the Sao I, II and III periodization is not tackled at all. The dates of the building of the enclosing wall at Mdaga, and of its abandon- ment, do not seem to have been established. THURSTAN SHAW</page></plain_text>
