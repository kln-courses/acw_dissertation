In many respects, this movement stemmed from the seemingly long-forgotten ideas of the na- tional avant-garde of the 1920s. It was not just the ideas them- selves that were revived, but the spirit of a search that had been a natural expression of the first postrevolutionary years in the Soviet Union-an all-embracing urge to discover new ways in both art and life. The constructivist tradition drew particular attention in the Soviet Union of the 1920s. The process of form-building, the specific peculiarities of the existence of a form in space and the interaction of form and color were among the problems that attracted most of the artists of that period. A trend to- ward experimentation with mobile forms manifested projects such as the 1919-1920 Monument to the Third International-or Tatlin's Tower-and the 1929 monument to Christopher Co- lumbus by K. Melnikov (both of which were never built). These projects, beyond concentrating on the basic problems that were being tackled by constructivists at the time, also paved the way for an entirely new sphere of plastic art. How- ever, it took no less than 30 years for the practical implemen- tation of the solutions these projects offered to materialize. Among the avant-garde artists in 1960s' Moscow who were con- cerned with kinetic form-building, those belonging to two factions known as the "Movement" and "Peace" groups were the most prominent. I belonged to the Peace group, which was comprised of young architects, engineers, art- ists and composers, including en- gineer Gennady Rykunov and Leon Theremin (Lev Termen), one of the founders of electronic music. In 1967 a project of the Peace ABSTRACT The artist comments on a series of his artworks that show an evolution from minimal self- tensile constructions to the artis- tic exploration of the principles of visual perception. Various kinetic and transformable structures, in- cluding 'self-erected" construc- tions, are described. His tech- niques of manipulating flat images are shown in a series of collages in which geometric pat- terns define the forms of cut ele- ments and phantom objects emerge inside the source picture. Working with new constructive or visual principles, the artist looks for the most elementary ways of realizing methods of achieving particular forms. group realized the idea of monumental compositions with Vyacheslav F.

In Moscow's Kurchatov Square, we constructed a plastic form 6 meters wide and 12 meters high, which we named The Atom (Fig. 1). The work was composed of three bearings sup- porting a sphere that could rotate freely in space. The sphere itself consisted of duralumin rods connected to a steel frame. The duralumin's cold, silvery color, enhanced by a color-music device reproducing Theremin's "inhuman" melodies, created a truly enchanting im- pression. The Atom was, for us, the birth of an essentially new understanding of plastic art. It reflected new forms of aes- thetic comprehension; it evoked a world that was neither anthropomorphic nor anthropocentric-as it had been tradi- tionally perceived by Europeans since the Fig. 2. Space-Plane, stainless steel, alu- minum, mirrors and light, 5 x 7 m, 1980. (Realized in 1981 for the Memorial Museum of Cosmo- nautics, Moscow) the times of antiquity and the Renais- sance-but technocratic and industrial. This world had no room for human feel- ings and emotions. This became particularly obvious after the first wave of enthusiasm for the in- dustrial era, bordering on the deification of engineering and mathematical thought, began to wane. Moreover, the historical experience Russian artists have gathered at the close of the twentieth century has set us above the construc- tivists of the 1920s: we now know only too well the price of deification. Starting in the 1970s, definite changes began to take place in my creative system as a result of this understanding. My work has become more organic, seeking to satisfy as fully as possible the human need for an ideal living environment. My designs over this period-such as the net- like roofing for the Soviet pavilions at EXPO '75 in Okinawa and EXPO '85 in Tsukubo-are close in form to natural structures. The former priority of engi- neering problems in my work has given way to my search for a form that can en- sure the simplest mobile and durable construction. To quote L. Nervi, the ac- cent is on "durability through form." My use of traditional art forms is also a result of this shift. Though inherent in artistic design, the kinetic aspect is latent in traditional art. My series of polished bronze "M6biuses" and "impossible"-ob- jects-made-possible are a testimony to this effect. The very perception of these forms violates all tradition, and thus they contain a strong dynamic charge (Fig. 2). Another link in my creative chain was the development of self-producing forms, from my projects for a self-build- ing house (Fig. 3)-ideal for areas espe- cially subject to seismic activity-to the simple self-erecting structure of a radio- telescope project (Fig. 4). One of my latest inventions-self-col- lage-introduces kinetics onto the flat surface of a sheet. Self-collage is a tech- nique for obtaining qualitatively new vi- sual structures from an integral image by singling and cutting out elements en- dowed with a certain symmetry and join- ing these elements through interchang- ing repetitions and combinations. This singling and cutting out of elements is intended to do more than merely ex- tend the traditional images I have cho- sen as subjects, such as the well-known painting The Moon-Night by Aivazovsky (which became Sphere, 1983) or the popular Savrasov canvas The Rooks Have Come, reproduced as a postage stamp (which I turned into Greetings from Kiev, 1988). The viewer is shown the "bricklay- ing" procedure that went into the mak- ing of the image, which gives a clear un- derstanding of how an image can be easily manipulated to result in new forms and new images.

I' Cutting out and replacing parts of the image within each of the reproductions, I obtained a series of different phantom situations created within the source im- age. The soft tonal and colour grada- tions of the sea and sky contrasted with the acuteness of the geometric patterns. I called this series Seacape Inserts, stress- ing my interference with the original idyllic picture (Color Plate A No. 1). After being invited by film director Georgi Danelia to produce the props for his allegorical comedy Kin-dza-dza?!, whose main characters are people from outer space who need "their own" household appliances, instruments and the like, I became a designer of "outer- space" objects. One of my inventions, the Biotecton, is reproduced in Fig. 5. Its actual useful qualities-as well as its abil- ity to travel in every direction-could be explained only by a "genuine" represen- tative of "another world." Some of my most recent work in- cludes a new series of fashion objects- composed of netting, string and rods- that give the impression of wrapping the figure in a misty cloud (Figs 6, 7). Cer- tainly this sort of dress requires a new type of underwear! I showed this strange fashion at the opening of my last exhibition in January 1994 at the Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow. The exhibition was almost entirely dedi- cated to stereographics, the principles of which I first experienced while polishing aluminum plates. I noticed that the scratches on the surface of the metal cre- ate tiny reflections that form three-di- mensional pseudo-holographic images. I explored the nature of this effect in 1993 and will discuss it in a future article. For more than 30 years I have been exploring the visual aspects of culture, technology and human perception. These aspects influence the develop- ment of visual thinking in art, architec- ture, design and science, and result in the better understanding of nature. 398 Koleychuk, Kinetic Work</page></plain_text>
