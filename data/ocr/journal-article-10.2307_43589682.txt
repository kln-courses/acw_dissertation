Collins St. Norbert College Of the many discourses of narrative being practiced either tangentially or exclusively by writers all across Latin America from the end of the last century, crime or detective fiction emerges at the forefront amongst a diverse collective of authors. To illustrate this point, one only needs to list the names of established contemporary writers who, at some point in their career, have succumbed to the temptations of the detective novel and have published one or more works that incorporate enough discursive elements to identify them as detective stories.1 In particular, women authors like never before are not only experimenting with detective fiction and the unique narrative strategies that it offers, but are carving out new paths for the genre.2 *For example, Gabriel García Márquez's Crónica de una muerte anunciada (1980), Manuel Puig's Buenos Aires Affair (1973), Ricardo Piglia's Respiración artificial (1980), Mario Vargas Llosa's ¿Quién mató a Palomino Molero? (1986), Juan José Saer's La pesquisa (1994). 2In the United States and Great Britain, women have enjoyed a rather successful history of detective fiction writing. In terms of women authors of classical detective fiction, we cannot help think first and foremost of the English writer Agatha Christie - one of the most successful authors of detective fiction of all time. Christie wrote over thirty novels featuring the meticulous, yet slightly quirky detective, Hercule Poirot. Among the most well-known of these novels are The Murder of Roger Ackroyd (1926), Murder on the Orient Express (1934), and Death on the Nile (1937). In 1930, Christie introduced a second and equally beloved detective character, Miss Jane Marple, who protagonized twelve novels. After Christie, we think of, for example, Josephine Tey, pseudonym for the Scottish author Elizabeth Mackintosh; and the English writers Dorothy Sayers and P.D. James, short for Phyllis Dorothy James. Mackintosh is the author of several very successful detective novels such as The Man in the Queue (1929), Miss Pym Disposes (1946), The Franchise Affair (1948), and The Daughter of Time (1951). The English writer Dorothy Sayers published the acclaimed Lord Peter Wimsey series about a brilliant amateur detective. Some of Sayers 's titles in the series are Strong Poison (1930), Murder Must Advertise (1933) and Gaudy Night (1935). P.D. James, also an English writer, began her long and prolific career of detective fiction writing in 1962 with Cover Her Face , a 73</page><page sequence="2">74 Feminizing the Detective Novel: Marcela Serrano Margaret Kinsman refers to this revitalization of detective fiction when she states that "the [detective] genre has a great vitality at the end of this century, enjoying a second "Golden Age" of reader popularity, publishing success, and critical acclaim." Furthermore, she claims that "it is women writers, protagonists and readers who play key roles in defining the vigor and variety to be found in today's crime fiction novel [...]" (5). In Hispanic literature, we see this same revitalization of the genre happening and, again, it is largely due to the contributions of women writers across the Spanish speaking world.3 One recent case that illustrates not only the draw of detective fiction writing on Latin American women novelists but also their innovative approach to the genre is the 1999 novel Nuestra Señora de la Soledad by Chilean author Marcela Serrano.4 As Kate Quinn points out, with the publication of Nuestra Señora , Serrano enjoys the unique distinction of becoming the first female Chilean author to write a detective novel and the first Chilean to create a female detective ("Cases" 303).5 In general, Serrano's novels explore the social world of women. With Nuestra Señora , the author does not abandon themes of friendship, identity, the repression of women and the search for utopia that she develops in her other novels, but rather repackages them within the context of a detective story. novel featuring the investigator and poet Adam Dalgliesh of New Scotland Yard. She is best known for her Adam Dalgliesh series, publishing her most recent addition, The Private Patient , in 2008. In the United States we see a shorter, but equally successful, tradition of detective fiction written by women. Authors such as Sarah Paretsky, Faye Kellerman, Susan Grafton, and Marcia Muller feature more independent, hard-boiled types of detectives. Paretsky has written fourteen novels starring the Chicago private investigator, V I Warshawski; the latest came out in July of 2010. Susan Grafton writes the Kinsey Millhone series, starting with A is for Alibi (1987) and is now on U is for Undertow (2009). Marcia Muller started the popular Sharon McCone series, in 1977 and is still writing in it; her latest novel will come out in October of 2010 (Muller is also the creator of the Elena Oliverez series; see note 3). Other women who are currently writing more classical-type detective fiction are English author Laurie King and American author Carolyn Gold Heilbrun, who writes under the pen name Amanda Cross. 3 This process began a bit earlier in Spain as women writers were quicker to exploit the possibilities of detective fiction and have been actively writing in this style for the past twenty years. In Latin American literature, the Latina and Chicana writers in particular such as Marcia Muller, creator of the Elena Oliverez series, Edna Buchanan and her investigator Brit Montero, and Lucha Corpi with her Gloria Damasco series, have made names for themselves through the creation of their detective series that, in recent years, have received much deserved critical attention. 4It is not certain whether Serrano is familiar with the detective novels of other Hispanic and Latina woman writers, but it is clear by intertextual references made in Nuestra Señora that she is very familiar with the canonical Anglo writers of both the classical and hard-boiled traditions of detective fiction and the distinctive differences between the two models. 5Unlike many of the male detective writers at that time who to a great extent gained their international prominence with the success of their detective series, Serrano had already gained her readership and fame as a novelist before trying her hand at the detective genre. Serrano published her first novel, Nosotras que nos queremos tanto in 1991, which won the Premio Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz in 1994, an award given to the best Latin American novel written by a woman, followed by Para que no me olvides (1993), which won the Premio Municipal de Literatura in Santiago in 1994. She published two other novels before Nuestra Señora de la Soledad. The rest of her novels published to date are La llorona (2008), Hasta siempre, mujercitas (2004), El cristal del miedo (2002), Lo que está en mi corazón (2001 - finalist for the Premio Planeta in the same year), Un mundo raro (2000), El albergue de las mujeres tristes (1997), an à Antigua vida mía (1995).</page><page sequence="3">Shalisa M. Collins 75 Much of the criticism published on Serrano's novel focuses on the modifications it makes to the detective genre and attempts primarily to classify the text into the appropriate category of detective fiction. P. Eric Henager argues that Nuestra Señora de la Soledad seems at first to adhere more to the traditional analytical detective style because most of the investigation of the case "departs little from the conventions of the genre" (136) and exhausts itself in one reading upon the revelation of the enigma (139). Henager continues on to state that a closer analysis of the novel, however, would reveal that it is a " novela negra disguised as a detective novel" because its ending, in which the investigator decides to provide a falsified version of the truth to her client, supports rereading (139). For Henager, then, what fundamentally constitutes a novela negra is that it begs for rereading. In similar terms, Sara Roseli sustains that Nuestra Señora is a "novela antidetectivesca" because it subverts the traditional resolution of the enigma.6 In this essay I would like to offer my reading of Nuestra Señora de la Soledad , which builds on Henager 's and Rosell's understanding of the novel, but also suggests a third possibility. I will show how Serrano's novel aligns itself with the neo-policial latinoamericano tradition, made popular during the 1980s and '90s, in three essential terms that Ana Maria Amar Sánchez states are reconfigured in each tradition of detective fiction: crime, truth and justice. Moreover, Serrano's novel appropriates and particulates what I consider a constitutive element of the neo-policial - the elaboration of physical space and its poetic configuration within the discourse. If we look closely at the discursive elements of a handful of neo-policial novels we observe that these writers both privilege the development of spatial description over other discursive elements and use it poetically to point to abstract levels of meaning. In the case of Serrano, however, the spaces she focalizes in her narrative and their characterization reveal a very different narrative project than that of male neo-policial writers. Whereas male writers at this time are primarily interested in exploring issues of violence and criminality associated with a dysfunctional state or afflicted contemporary society, in Nuestra Señora , Serrano uses the trappings of a detective story to explore issues related to mechanisms of power, of female identity and of the social role of women in Hispanic society (Lattassa). Because of the uniqueness of Serrano's spatial poetics in this novel, I would contend that in Nuestra Señora de la Soledad the author establishes a new category of detective fiction that I would propose calling the neo-policial femenino. Before I can show how Serrano employs and alters traits of the neo-policial , it is essential to first discuss the primary characteristics of this mode of de- tective fiction. Contemporary Detective Fiction in Latin America and the neo-policial One characteristic shared by the majority of practitioners of contemporary detective fiction in Latin America is that to some degree or another they demonstrate a critical irreverence toward the classical detective formula, as it was developed in Europe and the United States. Whereas traditional writers such as Arthur Conan Doyle, S.S. Van Dine and Agatha Christie remained faithful throughout 6Sara Rosell's article makes use of Stefano Tani's argument that the antidetectivesca is a generic mode of postmodernism. The three types of antidetectivesca novels are determined by the way in which the author deals with the solution of the enigma. They are: innovative, deconstructive and metaficticious. Roseli states that Serrano's novel seems to correspond to the innovative and deconstructive. In the innovative, the investigator cannot separate herself from the issue she investigates and, therefore, the solution can be a projection of her own desires and can be real or partial (Tani 52-53). In the deconstructive, reality is much more ambiguous and the investigator has to realize that if she has not solved the issue, she has learned a lot about herself, or she may have found the solution, but has to withhold it (Tani 76-77).</page><page sequence="4">76 Feminizing the Detective Novel: Marcela Serrano their careers to the established models of classical golden age detective fiction writing, which they themselves created,7 practitioners of contemporary Latin American detective fiction use the canonical form freely; they systematically deconstruct the discourse of the classical detective story, concurrently integrating certain conventions of the genre while parodying others.8 This iconoclastic modus operandi places the genre within the precepts of postmodern narrative. Not only does it elucidate the aesthetic diversity of its practitioners, it also conveys the distrust they feel toward modernist representations of certain constitutive elements of the genre - truth, justice, the detective, the criminal - that, in canonical and even hard-boiled fiction, present themselves as totalizing and absolute. Moreover, these authors are aware that these representations do not accurately depict their referent - contemporary Latin America.9 One group of novelists in particular formed a sort of heterodox school of detective fiction. Authors such as Paco Ignacio Taibo II in Mexico, Leonardo Padura Fuentes in Cuba, Mempo Giardinelli in Argentina, and Ramón Díaz Eterovic in Chile, from their different latitudes and without consultation, have inscribed into a common, unwritten understanding of what detective fiction should look like in Latin America at the end of the twentieth century and the beginning of the twenty first. Within the parameters of absolute diversity, they have appropriated conventions of the canonical and of the North American hard-boiled detective models, with notable thematic and structural modifications, and have Latinized them, creating a hybrid genre that is commonly referred to as the neo-policial or neo-policiaco latinoamericano style.10 The hallmark of the neo-policial has been 7 In general, writers of Golden Age detective fiction were very particular about how good detective fiction should be written. Several of them, including S.S. Van Dine and G.K. Chesterton wrote critical essays establishing the rules of detective fiction writing and proclaimed that "every respectable and every self respecting concocter of literary mysteries lives up to them" (Van Dine). See S.S. Van Dine 's "Twenty Rules for Writing Detective Stories" and also G.K. Chesterton's "How to Write a Detective Story." 8See chapter II of Amar Sánchez for a detailed explanation of this phenomenon. 9Glen Close provides an example of this trend in his recent study of the contemporary literary detective, "The Detective is Dead. Long Live the Novela Negral " He states that one of the characteristic traits of Latin American crime stories in this new millennium is the collapsing of the detective and the criminal, a separation that was held sacred by writers of classical detective fiction. The detective is no longer the seeker and defender of truth and justice, but, rather, bears an increasingly striking resemblance to the criminal in his "guiltless and alarmingly free exercise of violence" (155). 10Taibo II popularized the term neo-policiaco, which is the one used in Mexico. In Cuba, Chile and South America the term neo-policiar is more common, but both refer to the same phenomenon. Also, critics frequently use the generic term novela negra hispanoamericana to talk about the same thing. For the most part, the difference between these terms is regional although they are often used as synonyms. José Promis offers further insight into the nuances of the term. He states: El neo-policial latinoamericano no puede ser identificado llanamente con el relato policial tradicional, característico de la cultura europea y anglosajona, ni con el llamado género hard-boiled estadounidense. [...] El neo-policial latinoamericano sería un discurso narrativo característico de la cultura hispanoamericana, comparable, en este sentido, a otros tipos de discursos identificados también como propios de esta misma cultura, como, por ejemplo, el discurso de 'lo real maravilloso' de Alejo Carpentier, o el discurso hiperbólico de Gabriel García Márquez. (153-54)</page><page sequence="5">Shalisa M. Collins 77 experimentation and deviation from the generic norms, coupled with a critical view of society. Amar Sanchez points out that, especially since Borges, the manipulation of the established codes constitutes the practice of the neo-policial in Latin America (46). Taibo II argues that: "[...] el 'neo' introduce un montón de material de experimentación literaria y le da un nuevo soplo de calidad literaria y contenido, de profundidad narrativa a la novela que se había estancado" (Nichols 228). Similarly, Díaz Eterovic claims that the neo-policial "refleja la intención de sus exponentes de darle una calidad literaria que trascienda sus expresiones más espúreas y que la proyecten más allá del simple y tradicional juego deductivo" ("La novela policial"). Consequently, the discourse of the neo-policial constitutes a redefinition as well as a reorganization of the formal and aesthetic elements that are identified with traditional ways of writing detective novels and of conceiving society. In this reorganization, neo-policial authors privilege the development of physical space. In fact, it is in the neo-policial latinoamericano variant where the spatial element is most extensively and artfully elaborated, as compared to earlier forms. As Diaz Eterovic argues, in the neo-policial "el enigma [...] cede terreno, importando más el entorno en que se desarrolla un crimen y las reflexiones que ese entorno provoca en los personajes, de modo tal que la investigación del delito asume una condición de pretexto para explorar en las carencias de la sociedad" ("La novela policial"). Because of its permissive approach to the formula, the neo-policial provides the framework for the creative artistic expression earnestly sought after by writers of the postmodern era. Because of its marked critical function, it has been a privileged instrument for confronting the corruption and violence that has been institutionalized in Latin American countries with the rise of despotism and due to issues of a social, ecological and economical nature caused by the rampant modernization of contemporary society. As we will see further on, in the neo-policial in general and in Nuestra Señora de la Soledad in particular, spatial description provides a venue for artistic expression while functioning symbolically to contribute to the criti cal message of the text. Nuestra Señora de la Soledad and the Notions of Crime, Truth and Justice As I mentioned earlier, Henager has observed that Nuestra Señora seems on the surface to adhere to the conventions of the traditional analytical mystery novel that requires only one reading. He makes this judgment based on the fact that the novel follows a simple and linear plotline, at times "falls into cliches or rather forced moments constructed to advance the plot" and ends with what seems like the traditional wrap-up scene of series detective novels (136-37). The novel centers on two female characters, Carmen Ávila, a famous Chilean author of detective novels who has disappeared after attending an international book fair in Miami, and Rosa Alvallay, a middle-aged, divorced mother and lawyer who investigates Carmen's disappearance. Serrano's use of a female investigator who narrates in the first person facilitates an exploration of the feminine psyche of the disappeared author. Rosa employs traditional and non-traditional methods of investigation, relying heavily on female intuition and feelings of identification with the missing author, which she develops during the investigation. For Rosa, an astute "female" reader, Carmen's novels and her last interview before her disappearance reveal motives for wanting a different life and provide answers to her whereabouts. As Rosa reconstructs the clues that lead to the truth about Carmen, she and the reader come to discover that Carmen has not been abducted, but rather has staged her own disappearance in order to escape the constraints of a domineering husband, a distinguished and imposing university rector. Carmen married the Rector because he offered the initial stability and grounding she needed as a young, almost nomadic woman abandoned by her parents, and because he proved a strong father figure for her son from a previous relationship. After marriage, however, Carmen's husband treats her as a trophy wife and forces her to suppress her authentic nature in order to conform to societal expec- tations of a good wife, a charge that she is unable to master. Additionally, during their marriage, the Rector develops an inclination for young women, and engages in a string of affairs often facilitated by his daughter Ana Maria, who disdains her stepmother. As the mystery unfolds, Rosa is led to Oaxaca,</page><page sequence="6">78 Feminizing the Detective Novel: Marcela Serrano Mexico, where she finds a very different looking Carmen living a clandestine life under the guise of a Colombian woman named Lucia Reyes. By reading Carmen's novels and secretly exploring her home, Rosa pieces together enough clues to determine that this is indeed the missing author. After identifying the author's whereabouts, as Rosa is flying back to Santiago, she confesses to the reader that she has determined to protect Carmen and not divulge the truth about her to the Rector or her boss. Instead, she will write a false version to be handed over, what she calls a " novela negra" (247). After his initial reading of Nuestra Señora , Henager offers further insight into Serrano's novel and concludes that it is not a traditional mystery novel as it might seem at first, but rather a novela negra1 1 because the ending instills distrust in the reader and compels him or her to reread the novel more carefully. However, if we use Amar Sánchez 's theories on the detective genre as a theoretical framework, we see that the novel fits more precisely within the tradition of the neo-policial. She has shown that in all forms of the detective novel, including the neo-policial, certain essential terms of the genre are reevaluated (47). This is part of a natural process of evolution that occurs in literary produc- tion; as the social-historical referent changes, so do the forms of literary production that reflect these changes in the referent. José Promis refers to this phenomenon when he states, "las modificaciones progresivas que se manifiestan ineludiblemente en el desarrollo de la estructura social producen efectos correspondientes en el modo de conceptualizar y asumir la responsabilidad de la producción literaria" (151). This evolution can be especially appreciated in genre fiction. As Amar Sánchez explains, the notions of crime, truth and justice are paradigmatically redefined (47) in each tradition of detective fiction as is the configuration of those characters that are legitimized by their discourses: the criminal, the police and the detective. These terms are articulated by a new form of legality established by the genre: "Crimen y ley juegan en posiciones de complementariedad: la ley decide si hay crimen, si hay verdad y si se hará justicia" (47). Whereas in the canonical novel these essential notions - crime, truth and justice - constitute concrete and irrefutable signs, in Nuestra Señora as in the neo-policial their meanings are arbitrary and problematic. Crime in the neo-policial is of political or social nature and is understood as a manifestation of a corrupt or defunct system. Although the immediate crime, usually a homicide, is carried out by individuals, they are representatives of the system. Therefore, crime and violence are usually state sponsored and politically sanctioned by the government and its individual branches. The investigation of the case allows the detective to discover that the real crime is a product of the exploitation of power at the institutional level and, therefore, the apprehension of the delinquents is insufficient for restoring order and balance in the social system. In Serrano's novel, Carmen's disappearance is voluntary and, therefore, we cannot point to a physical agent of criminal delinquency. What is clear in the novel is that Carmen's motives for staging her own disappearance stem from expectations placed on her by her husband, her stepdaughter, the servants in her home and others, to conform to certain societal expectations of women, especially of a woman married to a traditional social figure such as a university rector. For example, Carmen's stepdaughter, Ana María, comments on what she perceives as Carmen's ineptness in this role: "Carmen no ayudaba a que Papá progresara en la vida. Nunca comprendió que él debía frecuentar a ciertas personas por conveniencia, no por gusto. No, ella jamás le dirigió palabra a nadie por ninguna razón que no fuera su solo antojo. 1 1 A lot of confusion stems from the vast numbers of terms floating around in both English and Spanish that attempt to classify detective fiction. Generally, the term novela negra is used in Spanish to refer to the North American hard-boiled variant but also is used ubiquitously to refer to any detective novel, both Latin American and Spanish, that models itself after the North American hard-boiled. Many authors and critics who use the term novela negra for both the North American and Hispanic variants are mostly concerned with distinguishing this model from the canonical model and not with elaborating on the various nuances of contemporary detective fiction written in Spanish.</page><page sequence="7">Shalisa M. Collins 79 ¡Pésima mujer para un hombre público!" (85-86). The crime in this novel, then, is social in nature and is the oppression of women. The "criminar' is the patriarchal system and those who act as its agents, such as those mentioned above who constitute some of Carmen's most immediate relationships. In the neo-policial , the revelation of the truth leads to the disclosure of the mystery and apprehen- sion of the immediate agents of the crime. Truth, however, is negotiable: what is discovered by the detective is generally not the official truth that is made known to the public. The reader is given the special privilege of knowing the truth as the detective knows it, which then creates solidarity between detective and reader and legitimizes the provisional justice the detective, who operates as a vigilante, must impose as the only acceptable alternative given that the system is incapable of imposing an official form of justice. Truth in Serrano's novel is undoubtedly negotiable. The revelation of the truth about Carmen leads to the resolution of the mystery, but the official truth, like in the neo-policial , remains between the detective and the reader. Although Rosa never makes contact with the missing author, because of her feelings of empathy for Carmen and the strong bond of solidarity she has formed throughout the investigation, Rosa violates the hallmark of her profession, the disclosure of truth. Instead of revealing Carmen's whereabouts to those who have charged her with finding the truth - the Rector and her boss - Rosa decides to protect Carmen's freedom by writing a falsified account of the results of her investigation. She states: "comprendo que debo rendir cuentas, que el prestigio que adquiriría al resolver esta investigación es elevado, que la verdad en esta profesión mía es el más apreciado intangible. Pero yo no quisiera que algún día otra mujer me delatara si en mí se llegara a aventurar la esperanza" (246). Justice in the neo-policial is unofficial and partial. It is left in the hands of the detective figure to define and impose because the official institution charged with this duty is unable to render true justice, as it is understood by the detective. The detective, although unorthodox and often violent in his method of investigation, nonetheless, adheres to a code of ethics, which keeps him on the good side of the law. Justice is partial in the neo-policial because although the immediate perpetrators of the crime are punished, the official system, which sanctions the crime, remains intact. Moreover, justice usually outranks truth in the neo-policial Indeed, the truth authorizes the detective to impose justice, but a direct correlation between truth and justice does not exist. In a case in which the system is corrupt or incompetent, true justice would be the removal of that system and the imposition of a just and effective one. This is not the case in the neo-policial in which the detective imposes a provisional form of justice that lines up with his personal ideological views. Nuestra Señora fits this characteristic of the neo-policial insofar as justice is unofficial and partial. When Rosa makes the decision to falsify the truth in order to protect Carmen, she automatically removes herself from the legal institution that authorizes her, which is legitimized by the discourse of absolute truth. Justice is partial because, although patriarchy suffers a minor blow when Carmen is allowed to triumph over the Rector, the patriarchal system remains intact. Moreover, as in the neo-policial, justice outranks truth in this novel. The investigator, Rosa, upon discovering the truth of Avila's disappearance, magnanimously sacrifices her own fame, which would be virtually guaranteed by discovering the whereabouts of a national celebrity, rather than sabotaging another woman's liberation from social and cultural expectations. The truth is concealed so that justice, in the eyes of the investigator, may prevail. As we have seen so far, the essential elements of detective fiction - crime, truth and justice - are defined similarly in Serrano's novel and in the neo-policial. I would make the argument that although this is essential, it is the novel's treatment of space that ultimately distinguishes it as neo-policial Serrano dedicates a notable amount of attention to the development of physical space in this novel, and, like the neo-policial , uses space poetically. That is to say, spatial characterization does more than provide a mere frame for narrative acts, rather it contributes to the message of the text. We must keep in mind though that because Serrano's narrative project is distinct and distinctly feminine in focus, so too are her spatial poetics. Noticeable differences occur as Serrano's particular narrative project shapes the way in which space unfolds. The author's articulation of the spatial element marks a crucial point in which the novel explores new possibilities for imagining the detective genre. In the remainder of this essay, I will discuss how Serrano re-envisions spatial poetics within the detective</page><page sequence="8">80 Feminizing the Detective Novel: Marcela Serrano genre by focusing primarily on the types of spaces the author focalizes and how she utilizes them symbolically compared to writers of the neo-policial. Each of these authors present their own nuances, however, we can observe some commonalities in their spatial poetics, which will serve as points of comparison with Serrano's novel. Serrano's Creation of Feminine Spatial Poetics Writers of the neo-policial have been largely concerned with configuring descriptions of urban spaces that metonymically incriminate dysfunctional or oppressive governments.12 For one thing, because of the critical function assumed in the neo-policial , the majority of these authors position their stories in precise and identifiable places and historical moments. In most cases, they are concerned with their own country's issues and therefore concentrate the action within the borders of their respective country and often within the same city.13 Let us take for example a couple of the most well known of these practitioners. In the majority of Ramón Díaz Eterovic's novels, the action takes place in Santiago, Chile, especially in the colorful Mapocho neighborhood where the protagonist detective Heredia lives. Similarly, Paco Ignacio Taibo IPs Hector Belascoarán Shayne series takes place in different parts of México, though much of the action occurs in Mexico City, which is home to the detective. Within these loci, neo-policial authors strategically focalize spaces and configure them in such a way that they point to a variety of institutional problems, such as deficiencies or crimes that result from corrupt or misguided governments, or immanent hostility and violence prevalent in the referent. Moreover, they use spatial description to point to long-lost socialist utopias in the face of authoritarian regimes and unbridled neoliberal economic systems.14 Gender negotiations and the struggles that Latin American women face under patriarchal dominance, while not issues of concern in the neo-policial per se, figure at the forefront of Serrano's narrative project and, therefore, influence how space is codified in Nuestra Señora. For this reason, rather than describing urban settings, she focalizes domestic spaces that Lefebvre calls "representational" spaces because they "are full of symbolism" (33) and meaning. In fact, much of the message of the novel - the symbolic redemption and liberation of woman in the face of patriarchal dominance - is articulated through spatial configuration. 12It is not the intention of this essay to give an extensive analysis of spatial poetics in the neo-policial. For a detailed explanation see chapters 1 and 3 of my doctoral thesis. 13 Writers in exile such as Mempo Giardinelli are often an exception and may place the action of their stories in other countries, particularly in their country of exile. 14Note the nostalgic tone in the following quote from one of the later novels of Ramón Díaz Eterovic, Los siete hijos de Simenon. In this novel, and several others of his, Diaz Eterovic is concerned with a Santiago that is destroying itself and its collective memory in the onslaught of neoliberalism, a legacy of the Pinochet regime: El mundo cambiaba de prisa y yo me resistía a cambiar con él. [...] Era un extraño en mis propias calles y recorrerlas era un ejercicio cada vez más exigente para la memoria. Mi barrio cambiaba; crecían edificios nuevos, antenas y avisos de neón que ocultaban el azul del cielo. La vieja cárcel había sido demolida y en su reemplazo se alzaban dos torres de concreto. A diario los instrumentos de comunicaciones eran mejores y sin embargo, la gente cada día estaba más incomunicada y sola. La perfección de lo nuevo contenía un inevitable sentimiento de pérdida y las banderas de la rebeldía se arriaban en beneficio de la conformidad. (217)</page><page sequence="9">Shalisa M. Collins 81 One way in which Serrano redeems woman through space is by privileging feminine space over masculine space. First of all, feminine spaces are evoked more often than masculine spaces and are always celebrated while masculine space is scrutinized. With few exceptions, most of the loci focalized and elaborated in the novel are associated with Carmen: her study, her dressing room, and her walled home and garden in Oaxaca. Through contact with these feminine spaces, Rosa becomes endeared to Carmen. She "reads" these spatial signs positively and little by little vindicates Carmen's nature in the face of critical testimonies of her. We see this played out textually in Rosa's descriptions of the Rector's and Carmen's studies respectively, which are strategically juxtaposed within the narrative. We are presented with the Rector's (masculine) space when Rosa meets with him for the first time to discuss his wife's disappearance. Her descriptions of his mansion in the barrio alto of Santiago and of his private study are concise, giving just enough information to illustrate his rigid and conventional character. Rosa's first impression upon seeing the mansion was relief that she had decided to wear formal, "severe" attire (19). Once in his study, Rosa notes that the objects in the room were ordered with "la más estricta convención" (19). She feels uncomfortable in this space and resists every temptation to smoke a cigarette or sit back in the sofa. In fact, each time she mentions a part of the mansion that is associated with the Rector, she emphasizes its rigidity and imagines Carmen to be uncomfortable in these spaces. Rosa's description of Carmen's study appears textually right after that of the Rector's and demonstrates her preference for this space over his. Rosa enthusiastically inventories and describes the objects of Carmen's study, which function as signs of life - partially burned candles and incense and well-used furniture. Rosa immediately feels comfortable in this space in which she senses that "los objetos están vivos, más allá de posar como simples ornamentos" (25). Here Serrano introduces the theme of woman as life giver through the anthropomorphic quality of the objects and by metonymically associating Carmen with nature and trees, which appear as a motif in the novel. The central decoration of the room is an enormous Mexican árbol de la vida , which, because of its size, placement, and symbolism, inescapably represents Carmen. In Mexican culture, the árbol de la vida was often given to newly-weds, symbolizing fertility and an abundant harvest in their marriage. Rosa is careful to describe the árbol to the reader before deciding to return her focus back to the investigation: Un enorme árbol de la vida mexicano color arcilla es la decoración central de la habitación. Me detengo en la figura del diablo, que burlón espera a la serpiente, enroscada contra el tronco cual amante ardorosa; Caín y Abel luchan por quitarle el protagonismo a Adán y Eva que se deslizan a través del follaje seguidos por una calavera que ríe a sus espaldas. (25-26) It is curious to note here also that, although most of the first half of the novel is narrated in the past tense, narrator Rosa switches to the present tense to relate her experience in Carmen's study, giving immediacy to the narration and reinforcing the sense of life and presence of Carmen in that space. Because Rosa celebrates this space, this room takes on a redemptive quality. Not only is it a place where feminine qualities are celebrated, it belies critical assumptions made about Carmen and therefore redeems her in the eyes of the reader. At the same time that space functions symbolically to vindicate woman by enshrining feminine space, it also illustrates gender politics and the subjugation of woman under patriarchy. While at the Rector's mansion, Rosa has the opportunity to observe the author's large dressing room, which was designed and built for her by her husband. This room may, at first, seem a private space for Carmen, and therefore a space of liberation, but in fact it is a place where gender struggles have long been negotiated. Nicole Pohl points out that in early modern literature a man's closet was a place of great privacy, but a woman's closet, although it contained her personal effects, was not and could be constantly invaded by the master of the house (26). In this novel, Carmen's closet is a feminine space, but it is by no means liberating. In fact, it functions more as a sort of prison because it was created not with her interests in mind, but rather with the intention of restricting and normalizing her "savage" (108) nature and turning her into the "Rector's wife" (65). The content of the dressing room symbolizes in</page><page sequence="10">82 Feminizing the Detective Novel: Marcela Serrano microcosm Carmen's struggle for authenticity and autonomy in the face of patriarchal expectations. When Rosa describes the dressing room, she focuses only on Carmen's clothing and their placement in the closet. On one side hang formal, constrictive clothing, which the Rector bought for his wife and expects her to wear when she is out in public or receiving his guests. On the other side hang loose, flowing, ethnic clothes - tunics, as they are described in the novel - that Carmen prefers but only dons when she is free from wifely duties. The clothing is not anthropomorphized as are the objects in Carmen's study, but they are powerful images that symbolize Carmen's struggle for authenticity and autonomy alongside the Rector. Because of marriage to the Rector, Carmen is constantly forced to negotiate two identities, the false identity of the Rector's domitable wife and the displaced, authentic reality of a free-spirited, uninhibited woman who is longing for freedom. It is significant to note, furthermore, that the mere positioning of these rooms, both Carmen's study and her dressing room, function, as well, as structures of male dominance and female subordi- nation. These rooms are insular, this is to say they are "separatist female spaces" (Pohl 95) that are closed off from the rest of the world by masculine space. As Christophe Martin points out, these types of cloistered rooms "enforce the ideals of domesticity, intimacy and retirement" (qtd. in Pohl 2). They are reminders that space is ultimately connected to power and, as Pohl suggests, "[t]he enclosure of women [and of women's "space"] in men's physical space reaffirms women's enclosure in a masculinist conceptual world" (1). Even though these rooms are pockets of feminine space that at first seem liberating, they are engulfed by oppressive masculine spaces that threaten to overtake them. Moreover, in the case of Carmen's study and her dressing room, they contain symbolic reminders of the pervasiveness of patriarchal repression. In the study, even though the árbol de la vida - equated with the Biblical tree of life - reminds the reader of Carmen's life-giving qualities, Rosa points out that the figures of Cain and Abel and Adam and Eve - symbols of patriarchy - fight for the role of protagonist. Moreover, the serpent, winding its way up the tree, seems to threaten the life-giving power of the tree (26). In the dressing room, Carmen's loose and vaporous tunics (19) must share the space with the rigid, Western suits that hang alongside them. As we have seen, throughout Nuestra Señora the spatial element plays an important role in illustrating gender politics and the redemption of woman; at the end of the novel it becomes the dominant discursive element for communicating the message of redemption. Rosa, led by her feminine instinct, travels to Oaxaca, Mexico, and discovers that the author is living there clandes- tinely. While in Santiago, Rosa offers few descriptions of the urban setting; on the few occasions when she does, Santiago is represented critically.1 However, upon arrival in Oaxaca, her eye begins to register for the reader the external wonders of the city of Oaxaca and domestic spaces associated with the woman she suspects is Carmen, though her physical appearance is significantly altered. Indeed, long passages of text are dedicated to celebratory descriptions of the city, the interior of Carmen's home and the garden park that surrounds it. Carmen's adoptive city in Mexico sits textually in opposition to Santiago, which is presented in the novel as a place of subjugation. Oaxaca is presented as a place of redemption and liberation because it is here, under the benign influences of the patron saint Nuestra Señora de la Soledad, that Carmen escapes patriarchal subjectivity and attains agency. 15For example, Rosa comments on the Santiago traffic while treating herself to a taxi ride upon receiving her new case: Contemplé el horrendo tráfico de la ciudad de Santiago, sintiéndome por completo ajena, excluyéndome con todo desparpajo de las incomprensibles corrientes que van y vienen sin detenerse entre sus habitantes, como víctimas de los vaivenes de un carrusel infernal. Era una tarde de enero y el calor parecía un murmullo. Vibrante y permanente. (12)</page><page sequence="11">Shalisa M. Collins 83 Two spaces in Carmen's home in Oaxaca, the dressing room and the garden park, are of particular interest to this study because they illustrate the culmination of redemption and liberation of woman through space. First of all, when Rosa has the opportunity to secretly search Carmen's home, she pauses once again to describe the content of the author's dressing room. The clothing hanging there are convincing signs that the woman Rosa is following, in spite of her changed physical appearance, is most likely Carmen. The closet has very few garments, but almost all of them are ethnic clothing like those Carmen used in Santiago when she was not playing the role of Rector's wife. Only three garments, hanging off by themselves in a corner are '"western" attire. Rosa points out that these clothes are barely used and seem to be "visiting" as do a couple pair of high-healed shoes that also seem out of place. Moreover, the dressing room, like the entire house, belongs to Carmen. More than just functioning as indicators that the owner of these clothes is truly the missing author, the clothes and the dressing room symbolize a reversal of Carmen's life of subjugation in Santiago. Symbols of patriarchal dominance - the westernized clothing - are only allowed visiting rights, not possession of this space. Likewise, the garden park that surrounds Carmen's home also enshrines a feminine value system and functions as a redemptive space. Rosa is enchanted by the garden - a conventional form of feminine representation from classical literature - and bestows upon it the virtues that had been oppressed in Carmen when she functioned as the Rector's wife. She describes a seemingly wild garden park, "solitary, haughty and self-sufficient" - "un sorpresivo lugar secreto" (192) - and takes particular note of the distribution of the trees, which, to her relief, are growing "desordenadamente" and seem to embrace each other as a sign of solidarity (192). Within the novel, this garden, like the árbol de la vida in her Santiago study, redeems certain virtues that Serrano associates with wom- en - nature, life-giver, caprice, autonomy-that had been stifled in the Rector's masculine space. Moreover, the garden represents a small utopia where feminine values prevail, where female solidarity and friendship, as represented in the trees, protect and sustain, where silence abounds and intrusion is prohibited, and finally were stability is provided but where the natural reigns over the conventional. Through appropriation of this home and garden, Carmen ultimately lays hold of what she could not possess under the Rector's dominion, a space and a place of her own. Conclusion Classification of postmodern texts is always problematic given the fact that they obliquely or directly defy classification. Although we could perhaps single out other characteristics of the novel and make the argument that Marcela Serrano's Nuestra Señora de la Soledad is not in fact neo-policial, as we have seen the novel lines up with the neo-policial in the essential elements as explained by Amar Sánchez. Moreover, the novel utilizes what is perchance the definitive element that defines the neo-policial detective novel - the privileging of physical space and its poetic configuration - and feminizes it. While the neo-policial focalizes primarily urban spaces and uses spatial configuration to communicate abstract truths about oppressive institutions and social deficiencies of Latin American countries, Serrano's novel privileges feminine spaces and uses spatial configuration to illustrate the redemption of Latin American women in the face of their struggle to find their own space and recover their displaced authentic nature albeit in a hidden home and garden in Oaxaca. Still, with the alterations that Serrano has offered to the genre in her novel Nuestra Señora de la Soledad , the term neo-policial does not seem sufficient to communicate the subtleties and nuances of her spatial poetics. This brings us back to the age old question of what do we call it? Does it even merit a distinctive title? I would offer as a possibility the neo-policial femenino. The term neo-policial would identify her novel with the variant of detective novels that presents a critical position of society and that, at the same time, exploits the possibilities of spatial configuration to communicate abstract levels of meaning. The qualifier femenino would then set her novel apart as one that uses poetic</page><page sequence="12">84 Feminizing the Detective Novel: Marcela Serrano spatial configuration to explore the concerns of female writers who are looking for authentic modes of feminine expression within a discourse traditionally practiced by men.
