Priya Prasad Ford Motor Co. Shashl M. Kuppa Conrad Technologies Richard M. Morgan and Rolf H. Eppinger US DOT/NHTSA ABSTRACT Axial loading of the calcaneus-talus-tibia complex is an important injury mechanism for moderate and severe vehicular foot-ankle trauma. To develop a more definitive and quantitative relationship between biomechanical parameters such as specimen age, axial force, and injury, dynamic axial impact tests to isolated lower legs were conducted at the Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW). Twenty-six intact adult lower legs excised from unembalmed human cadavers were tested under dynamic loading using a mini- sled pendulum device. The specimens were prepared, pretest radiographs were taken, and input impact and output forces together with the pathology were obtained using load cell data. Input impact forces always exceeded the forces recorded at the distal end of the preparation. The fracture forces ranged from 4.3 to 1 1 .4 kN. The specimen pathology identified using palpation, radiography and detailed dissection, included extra/intra-articular fractures of the distal tibia/ calcaneous with or without extensions into the anatomic joints. Results from these tests conducted at the Medical College of Wisconsin laboratory were combined with the data from the studies by Wayne State University and Calspan Corporation. The total sample size available was 52. Statistical analysis of these data were performed using Weibull techniques. Age and dynamic axial force were the most significant discriminant variables that defined the injury risk function. Consequently, the probability of foot-ankle injury was described in terms of specimen age and force. Our findings are a first step towards the quantification of the dynamic tolerance of the human foot-ankle complex under the axial impact modality. BACKGROUND Lower limb injuries have been reported to be a frequent cause of permanent disability and impairment secondary to motor vehicle crashes [1, 2]. Epidemiological data have been gathered and analyzed using databases and clinical information 1887</page><page sequence="2">in a retrospective mode. The earlier study conducted in 1979 by Gloyns et al., emphasized the need to protect the human lower extremity [3]. The investigation was conducted on 101 frontal impact occupants with lower extremity trauma (the abbreviated injury scale) AIS rating of &gt; 2 [4]. For drivers, the foot-ankle complex on the right was more likely injured than the left side. It was postulated that a direct transmission of the load via the pedal and the footwell is the cause for foot- ankle trauma [3]. In another study, Backaitis and Roberts, from two occupant injuries in air bag equipped vehicles, concluded that the ankle trauma was due to a contact loading from the foot control of the automobile [5]. Morgan et al., examined 1979-1986 NASS files for frontal impact and found that lower extremity injuries are about 26 percent of the total moderate or greater injuries (AIS &gt; 2 category); contact with foot controls was the cause of 45 percent of foot- ankle injuries, while contact with the floor pan accounted for 24 percent of foot-ankle trauma [6]. Thomas et al., examined real-world data collected in the United Kingdom [7]. In the presence of footwell intrusion, the risk of leg injury increased separate from and to a greater extent than the "delta v" measure of crash severity. Although the risk of AIS &gt; 2 leg injury was determined to be high at high levels of intrusion, the exposure was low resulting in fewer leg injuries under high severity conditions. In a recent study, Kuppa and Sieveka examined vehicle frontal crash tests to associate the dynamic behavior of the brake pedal/toe pan with the axial loads transmitted through the feet of the Hybrid III anthropo- morphic dummy [8]. Maximum lower tibia axial loads highly correlated with peak floor pan accelerations. Kallina et al, from the Mercedes Benz Corporation, recognized that axial loads and high toe pan acceleration caused foot-ankle trauma [9]. Other studies have implicated direct loading to the foot-well or toe pan to be a cause of foot- ankle injuries [1, 10-15]. From a hospital based epidemiologic point-of- view, Dischinger et al., in 1994 examined lower extremity injury data from 42 frontal seat occupants under non ejection and non rollover crash conditions [16]. There were 22 males and 20 females. Foot-ankle complex injuries accounted for approximately two-thirds of all lower extremity trauma. The injury mechanisms were postulated based on clinical discussions, crash reconstruction, and experience. Axial load due to direct contact with the vehicular interior (floor pan and/or foot control) was the major injury mechanism (approximately 70%). Other modes such as inversion-eversion and dorsiflexion were the less predominant mechanisms of injury. These findings, determined using the U.S. population, parallels a more recent study from Australia wherein Fildes et al., also reported that compression and crushing - are the frequent mechanisms of foot-ankle injuries [17]. These foregoing literature data clearly indicate the external axial compressive impact load applied through a vehicular interior, to be a predominant mechanism of injury to the foot-ankle complex. Neither the previous non exhaustive review nor the present study encompass the totality of foot-ankle trauma due to automotive crashes. The authors of this study believe that direct axial loading is only a portion of the matrix of foot-ankle trauma mechanisms, albeit an important part. Other injury mechanisms are not addressed in this paper. To summarize, since lower extremity injuries occur frequently, are disabling, and contribute to a large portion of the cost of injury in the United States, vehicular modifications to create a more crashworthy environment for the lower extremities would be an effective means to reduce the incidence and severity of these injuries. PURPOSE As noted earlier, various research efforts have suggested axial loading through the feet to be a 1888</page><page sequence="3">major mechanism of foot-ankle injuries. Consequently, to obtain a better understanding of the biomechanical response of the human foot- ankle complex under dynamic axial loading, a research program involving component testing of human cadaver lower extremities was initiated at the Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW) laboratories. ORGANIZATION Based on this paradigm the text is organized as follows: a. Dynamic impact tests at MCW laboratories using intact unembalmed human cadaver lower extremities are described. b. A synthesis of these data with similar dynamic tests conducted by Wayne State University (WSU) and Calspan Corporation (Calspan) is presented. c. Combined fracture probability distributions are developed using all the above data. f. Salient conclusions from the study are given. PROCEDURE a. MCW Specimen Tests: This section presents the cadaver preparation and the experimental setup used at the MCW [18, 19]. Unembalmed human cadavers were used in the study. Their selection included an evaluation of medical records and radiography to ensure the absence of pre-existing degenerative disease or trauma. They were also screened for the human immunodeficiency virus, and Hepatitis A, B, and C. The guidelines suggested by the Centers for Disease Control were followed during testing and evaluation. The preparation of the specimen for the axial loading tests included the following procedures. The knee joint was disarticulated such that the entire lower extremity distal to the knee joint remained intact. The proximal tibia was rigidly .fixed in polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA). Steinmann pins were passed transversely through the tibia complex to achieve rigid fixation. During these procedures, the foot-ankle complex was placed on a flat horizontal surface. The vertical alignment was defined in the coronal plane from the tip of the lateral malleolus to the insertion site of the posterior cruciate ligament. In the sagittal plane, it was defined from the center of the insertion of the Achilles tendon into the calcaneous distally to the posterior cruciate ligament insertion proximally. For applying the dynamic axial load to the specimen, the line between the second toe and the center of the heel was held vertical and the plantar surface of the foot was upright. The specimen was fixed to the mini-sled. The equipment consisted of two precision ground stainless steel rails (2.5 m long) rigidly attached to a steel frame. Four linear ball-bearings formed the interface between the rails and the cart assembly which were used to connect the specimen to the mini-sled. A six-axis load cell was attached to the cart assembly; the leading edge of which was fixed to the proximal end of the preparation. The plantar aspect of the foot which defined the distal end was loaded axially by the pendulum impactor. The alignment of the impactor was optimized by minimizing the magnitude of the off-axis loads so that the specimen sustained predominantly axial impact forces. Initial developmental tests (not included in this paper) were used to arrive at this neutral positioning of the specimen. The cylindrical pendulum impact assembly was attached to a synthetic rubber padding at its leading edge to serve as the impacting surface with the plantar surface of the foot. All specimens were ballasted to 16 kg. The mini-sled pendulum device and the below knee-foot complex specimen are illustrated (Figure 1). Load cells were fixed to the pendulum impactor and to the proximal PMMA fixation to record the input and output force-time histories. The signals were gathered 1889</page><page sequence="4">Figure 1: Schematic illustration of the mini-sled-pendulum setup with the below knee-foot complex specimen oriented in the neutral position for the MCW tests (see text for details). using a digital data acquisition system (ODAS, DSP Technology, San Francisco, CA) at a sampling rate of 12,500 Hz. They were collected according to SAE J21 lb standards. The specimens used in the Medical College of Wisconsin tests ranged in age from 27 to 67 years. The anthropomorphic details are provided in Table I. The input impact forces recorded by the pendulum load cell always exceeded the forces recorded by the proximal tibia load cell for both fracture and non fracture tests. Fracture forces measured by the tibial load cell ranged from 4.3 to II.4 kN. The biomechanical results from this study are summarized (Table 1). The pathology obtained by palpation, radiography, and detailed gross dissection following the experiment included extra/intra-articular fractures of the distal tibia/calcaneous with or without extensions into the respective anatomic joints. b. Data Synthesis: WSU and Calspan Tests: As indicated earlier, the preceding data obtained from MCW laboratories were combined with impact test results from WSU (this section) and the Calspan Corporation (the following section) to examine the compatibility and derive the combined risk curves for injury to the human foot-ankle complex. WSU Specimen Tests: Human cadaver lower legs from ten subjects were used [20]. The specimen was prepared such that the lower legs were fixed approximately at the mid length of the tibia. The skin was removed on both sides of the ankle joint to expose the ligaments attaching to the tibia and fibula. The leg was initially horizontal and the foot was at 90 degrees to the tibia. The proximal end was potted with Ceralow in an aluminum cup which was then bolted to a six-axis load cell. The force delivering device consisted of an air pressure reservoir wire, a fast acting valve, a pneumatic piston, and an adjustable mounting restraint. The six-axis load cell was attached to this restraint. An uniaxial load cell to measure the total applied load, and an uniaxial accelerometer to measure the acceleration were connected to the end of the piston rod. This instrumentation system was adopted to compensate for the inertial effects on the measured loads, and to calculate the velocity profile of the applied displacement. Attached to the load cell on the end of the piston was a u-shaped bracket through which the force of the piston was applied to the foot plate. This was effected through two ball-bearings, one 1890</page><page sequence="5">Table 1: Summary of Data No. Source Test Age Height Weight Sex Velocity Force Fx / non (yrs) (cm) (kg) (m/s) (N) Fx 1 MCW HOR 27 175 66 M 2.2 2669 No 2 MCW 110R 27 175 66 M 6.7 10159 No 3 MCW U4Ļ 46 183 102 M 2.2 2718 No 4 MCW U4Ļ 46 183 102 M 7.6 11454 Yes 5 MCW 115R 46 183 102 M 7.6 11236 Yes 6 MCW 116R 27 180 77 M 3.3 4493 No 7 MCW 116R 27 180 77 M 7.6 9750 Yes 8 MCW U7Ļ 55 175 82 M 4.5 6227 No 9 MCW U7Ļ 55 175 82 M 6.7 8269 Yes 10 MCW U8Ļ 27 180 77 M 2.2 2802 No 11 MCW U8Ļ 27 180 77 M 6.7 9265 Yes 12 MCW 119R 55 175 82 M 6.7 7815 Yes 13 MCW 120R 60 178 75 M 5.6 6685 Yes 14 MCW 121L 60 178 75 M 4.5 5934 Yes 15 MCW 130L 64 166 70 M 6.7 10204 Yes 16 MCW 131R 64 166 70 M 2.2 2749 No 17 MCW 132L 50 185 93 M 3.3 4154 No 18 MCW 133R 50 185 93 M 5.6 7281 No 19 MCW 128L 67 178 82 M 5.6 6654 Yes 20 MCW 129R 67 178 82 M 3.4 5529 Yes 21 MCW U1Ļ 27 175 66 M 7.6 6203 No 22 MCW U3Ļ 27 175 66 M 7.6 7510 No 23 MCW 106R 74 185 104 M 2.2 508 No 24 MCW 109L 58 183 73 M 7.5 1162 No 25 MCW 126R 67 163 57 F 6.7 4559 Yes 26 MCW 127L 67 163 57 F 4.5 4328 Yes 27 WSU 438L - ax5 70 49 M 6110 No 28 WSU 438L - ax6 70 49 M 6990 Yes 29 WSU 335L - axlO 68 55 F 6440 No 30 WSU 335L - axil 68 55 F 6880 Yes 31 WSU 386L - axl5 43 69 F 7440 No 32 WSU 386L - axl6 43 69 F 8650 Yes 33 WSU 629R - 128 53 101 F 8030 Yes 34 WSU 629L- 130 53 101 F 8315 No 35 WSU 629L-131 53 101 F 8690 Yes 36 WSU 306L - 22 63 82 M 3430 No 37 WSU 306R- 23 63 82 M 5480 No 38 WSU 008L - 26 52 53 F 4000 No 39 WSU 503L - 27 65 93 M 6050 No 40 WSU 222R - 28 63 64 M 5970 No 41 WSU 222L-29 63 64 M 6840 No 42 WSU 493L-31 65 69 M 6260 No 43 WSU 360R - 33 59 64 M 7550 No 44 CALSPAN 2 52 165 74 M 4.6 9928 Yes 45 CALSPAN 5 68 183 75 M 4.6 8541 Yes 46 CALSPAN 6 78 177 74 M 4.6 12206 Yes 47 CALSPAN 7 76 168 80 M 4.6 10640 Yes 48 CALSPAN 8 76 170 75 M 4.6 8562 Yes 49 CALSPAN 1 1 68 165 75 M 4.6 12964 Yes 50 CALSPAN 3 67 164 64 F 4.6 7854 Yes 51 CALSPAN 4 72 166 59 F 4.6 8377 Yes 52 I CALSPAN I 85 | 159 | 70 | F ļ 4.6 | 8694 [ Yes 1891</page><page sequence="6">on either side of a 12 mm thick foot plate. The two-point loading restricted the specimen from inversion or eversión. When the line of force was in line with the ankle joint, this system produced an unstable loading situation and therefore, an additional restraint was added to the foot plate to prevent rotation during axial loading tests. The plate which was originally secured to the specimen's foot with twine, was also fixed with screws into the calcaneous because of slippage with the twine alone. The axial load was applied to the aluminum plate using the pneumatically generated force. The reader is referred to the above referenced citation for illustrative details. The fracture forces ranged from 6.9 to 8.7 kN. Other pertinent data are included in table 1 . Calspan Specimen Tests: A total of nine specimens were tested using a constant velocity compression device [21]. Details of the specimen preparation, mounting, instrumentation, and the testing device and the protocol are given in the reference. Briefly, each specimen was placed in the test fixture with the foot placed in 20 degrees dorsiflexion and tested at a velocity of 4.6 m/s. The foot was retained at this angle throughout the test by means of a loading plate which was continuously in contact with the specimen. The central line of the test device was aligned with the foot in the sagittal plane and the tibia axis was parallel to the impact direction. The proximal end of the preparation included the excised mid length femoral shaft which was held captive and restrained during impact. A load cell placed in contact with the foot plate recorded the axial impact forces. Radiographs were taken before the test and an autopsy was conducted following the experiment. Fractures occurred in all specimens. The dynamic data indicated the fracture forces to range from 7.8 to 13.0 kN. A summary of data from these studies is also given in table 1 . c. Fracture Probability Distribution: All data from these specimens (Table 1) were used to develop the human cadaver injury risk curve. The resulting sample size of 52 specimens (26, 17, and 9 respectively from MCW, WSU, and Calspan) had 25 fracture and 27 non fracture data points. After testing for the effects of each variable, a Weibull probability curve based on the specimen's age and fracture force versus injury, was found to best represent the data set (Figure 2). This curve had a p- value of 0.0001. This generalized two- parameter risk function can be used to derive the probability of injury with respect to axial force above for specific ages (Figure 3). For example, a 50% injury risk occurs for a 65 year old specimen at a dynamic axial force of 6.2 kN. The force value raises to approximately 8.0 kN for a 45 year old specimen. If one is interested in a more simplified risk function with axial force as the only discriminant variable (without regard to age), the Weibull curve (p=0.0001) indicates a force of 6.8 kN to represent a 50% probability of injury (Figure 4). The closed form equation for the risk based soley on dynamic axial load curve is (Figure 4): Ρ = 1 - exp [-exp {(w-2.036057)/0.3323456}] where Ρ indicates the probability of injury, w = In (χ), χ represents the force in Newtons. The rationale used to analyze the combined data set was as follows: The biomechanical force data indicated, in general, no fracture pathology at low levels of load, and fractures at high levels of loading; in the intermediary levels of force, the pathological outcome was mixed. This spectrum demonstrating low, transition, and high zones with non, mixed, and obvious injury patterns, respectively, is termed as left and right censored data. Koch proposed a method of developing risk function for such censored data using maximum likelihood techniques with the Weibull function as 1892</page><page sequence="7">Figure 2: Probability distribution for foot-ankle injury as a function of age and dynamic axial force derived from specimen tests. Experimental data were obtained from the Medical College of Wisconsin, Wayne State University and the Calspan Corporation. Plus/minus one standard deviation limits are shown in dotted lines. Solid circles represent the fracture and non-fracture data points. the underlying distribution [22]. Hertz adopted this method to develop risk functions for left and right censored data using a two-parameter Weibull curve, which has been implemented in the Sixth Version of the SAS manual [23]. This method was therefore, chosen in the present study. It should however be noted that the risk curve developed using logistic techniques [24], another method which can be used to analyze such data, essentially provided the same risk curves. Age and peak force were identified by the statistical analysis to be the most significant parameters for fracture probability distribution. Weight and height of the subject were found to be non discriminant variables for injury. It must be emphasized that the present data from 52 tests are 1893</page><page sequence="8">Figure 3: Probability distribution for foot-ankle injury as a function of the dynamic axial force derived from specimen tests for three discrete ages. biased towards the male population (Table 1). There was an insufficient number of female samples to derive a meaningful risk function. Consequently, the data from both genders were grouped. The objective of including axial loading data from tests conducted at three different sources was to increase the sample size to better describe the probability distributions, obtain an improved tightness-of-fit in the analysis, and differentiate the effects of various factors such as age on the injury analysis. Obviously, this method of analysis will introduce certain variations in the 1894</page><page sequence="9">Figure 4: Probability distribution for foot-ankle injury derived from specimen tests. Experimental data were obtained from the Medical College of Wisconsin, Wayne State University and the Calspan Corporation. See text for details. Plus/minus one standard deviation limits are shown on the plot. In addition, solid circles represent the actual fracture and non fracture (along the abscissa) data points from which the probability curve was developed. biomechanical data. Factors such as specimen fixation and type of loading device may affect the outcome; the previously described methods provide testing details from each source. The range of forces for fracture (Table 1) from each source overlapped. In addition, fractures produced 1895</page><page sequence="10">by all the three sources were found to be representative of real-world trauma. These fractures are demonstrative of the axial loading mechanism. Furthermore, the anthropomorphic specimen measurements from each source were found to fall within the range of the normal distribution of the entire ensemble. These factors clearly demonstrate the feasibility of using the combined data set for statistical analysis. As can be appreciated from table 1, the forces for fracture and non fracture are conditioned by variables such as the specimen's age and gender. For example, a 27 year old male specimen did not fracture at a load level of 10,159 Ν (No. 2, Table 1). However, a 67 year old female specimen demonstrated fracture at a force level of 4559 Ν (No. 25, Table 1). This result compares favorably with the general observation of the relatively greater force to injury of the younger male skeleton relative to the older female skeleton. Although the present analysis separated the effects of age, as discussed earlier, further differentiation based on gender was not possible. Another issue which may also affect the risk analysis, is the type of loading and boundary conditions, and the multiplicity of impact involved in the testing protocol. Despite the differences in the input conditions (pendulum loading at MCW versus constant velocity load device at Calspan, and pneumatic piston at WSU), specimen orientation and proximal attachment, and impact velocity, fractures were associated with a consistent axial loading mechanism. Further, the protocols from the three sources also represent the variations in axial input conditions found in real-world trauma. Care was taken to ensure that only one non fracture and one fracture data point (if two or more tests were conducted on the same specimen) per specimen were included in the probabilistic analysis. All tests at MCW consisted of either one impact (Nos. 5, 12, and 13 through 26 in Table 1) or two impacts (the remaining specimens in Table 1) with the first being a non fracture experiment followed by a fracture test. All Calspan tests (Nos. 44 through 52 in Table 1) were single impact fracture tests. Although tests 3, and 36 through 43 from WSU were single impact non fracture experiments, tests 27 through 32, and 34 and 35 were conducted with more than two impact loadings per specimen. Regression analysis computed by including first-impact only tests essentially provided the same results indicating that the multiple loading tests for this series did not influence the outcome. Furthermore, an unique advantage of including data from these three different sources, despite the individual laboratory protocols, may permit a more real- world condition with a likely congeniality for the development of the injury risk curve that can be applied in a vehicular crashworthiness assessment. From this point-of-view, the authors of the present study believe that the selected approach is practical, logical, and robust. d. Conclusions: Since literature indicates that a significant percentage of the foot-ankle injuries are associated with axial loading of the calcaneus- talus-tibia complex, a method was presented to conduct controlled tests at the MCW laboratories using intact human cadaver lower extremities under axial impact forces. Biomechanical results along with the specimen details were summarized. Pathology identified by palpation, radiography and detailed dissection included extra/intra-articular fractures of the distal tibia/calcaneous complex with or without extensions into the respective anatomic joints. The combined human cadaver dynamic axial loading foot-ankle data from the Medical College of Wisconsin, Wayne State University, and the Calspan Corporation were included in the analysis. The statistical relationship between axial force and incidence of injury to the foot-ankle complex was determined. The data (sample size of 52) resulted in the axial force and age-based risk curve for human cadaver foot-ankle trauma. 1896</page><page sequence="11">ACKNOWLEDGMENT This research was supported in part by DOT NHTSA Grant DTNH22-93-Y-17028, PHS CDC Grant R49CCR 507370, and the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center Research Service.
