<plain_text><page sequence="1">388 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST . VOL. 97, NO. 2 . JUNE 1995 of the tlahuelpuchi. Based primarily on detailed, firsthand descriptions (collected by Nutini) of 47 cases of infant or child death (one case was that of a seven-year-old boy), the authors use what they term an "epistemological method" to analyze the belief system in rural Tlaxcala that permitted the culpability for certain infant deaths to be attributed to the bloodsucking witch. They then attempt to determine the "actual" causes of the deaths (in several cases Nutini was aided by local physicians). In doing so they are effecting a comparison of the local epistemology with the Western naturalistic epistemology, the blood- sucking witch having ontological reality in the former but not, of course, in the latter. The book is somewhat unusual in its layout. Chapters 1 through 4 give great detail about the belief system in rural Tlaxcala that supports four anthropomorphic super- naturals, the tezittlazc (a weatherman or conjurer), the nahual (an individual who transforms into an animal and is basically a sort of trickster), the tetlachihuic (sorcerer), and the tlahuelpuchi, as well as their historical develop- ment and distribution in Mesoamerica. Chapters 5 and 6 present a finely detailed account of an epidemic of blood- sucking witchcraft that occurred in a rural Tlaxcalan village on December 9, 1960, plus information about the 40 other cases in the sample. Chapter 6 includes a number of tables that summarize important particulars about the 47 cases and lead into the explanation of bloodsucking witchcraft as an explanatory system that competed with naturalistic modes of explanation. Chapter 7 presents a theoretical background, while chapter 8 is fundamentally an exposition of what really happened to the 47 victims of the tlahuelpuchi. Nutini and Roberts indicate that the infant deaths actually were due to (1) asphyxia that re- sulted when their mothers breast-fed them at night and fell asleep, (2) suffocation under blankets or other items as they slept, (3) choking as a result of not being burped after breast-feeding at night, (4) infanticide, or (5) crib death. Chapter 9 describes the mutually reinforcing as- pects of ideology and the bloodsucking events. To summarize (and simplify, for there is an enormous amount of data as well as intricate and detailed analyses in this volume), the authors (1) present an ethnography, including 47 case studies, of bloodsucking witchcraft in rural Tlaxcala; (2) interpret the actions of the tlahuelpuchi and the social and psychological consequences of the suckings in terms of both Tlaxcalan and Western episte- mologies; (3) summarize and critically discuss the anthro- pological literature on witchcraft, sorcery, and the distinc- tion between the natural and the supernatural; (4) chronicle changes in the belief system of rural Tlaxcala related to bloodsucking witchcraft from around the turn of the century up to the present (and in particular between 1960 and 1986); and (5) develop a theory of change in folk systems of witchcraft and magic supernaturalism under the influence of diffusion and acceptance and utilization illness. Part 2 traces the history of Mexican gender rela- tions from the time of the conquest to the present. It also provides an aggregate view of the larger clinic population from which the ten case studies that follow were drawn and compares those sick women with a population of healthy ones who live in the same neighborhoods. Part 3, the heart of the book, presents detailed por- traits that reveal how life's lesions shape the conscious- ness and experience of ten disparate women. The por- traits reveal the resilience often seen in individuals who must build lives with few economic resources, difficult marriages, and sparse social support. Interestingly, al- though most have been ill for many years, several see improvement during the course of Finkler's research. The author attributes this to the fact that those who improve have taken some control over their lives by, for example, opening a business, taking up karate, or emotionally ex- tricating themselves from destructive family ties. It is in the life's lesions concept that the book's strengths and weaknesses are revealed. Finkler's para- digrn is richly holistic, shunning the reductionism that has historically characterized biomedical research. Yet its breadth restricts its analytical value. Although the lives of the ten women we meet appear typical of their culture and class, we never learn why they have developed debilitat- ing "lesions" while most of their neighbors have not. In this context Finkler could have more fully developed her interesting ideas about anger as the hypothesized bridge between experience and sickness. But while the role of anger in these women's lives is occasionally mentioned, it is not systematically explored. The value of the book lies in its poignant stories and the insight they offer into their tellers' views as to what brought their suffering about. Still needed, however, are more systematic data on how life's lesions cause illness and suffering, particularly for women. Finkler is to be congratulated for identifying a most promising research direction. A Bloodsucking Witchcraft: An Epistemological Study of Anthropomorphic Supernaturalism in Rural Tlaxcala. Hugo G. Nutini and John M. Roberts. Tucson: University of Arizona Press, 1993. 476 pp. GARRY E. CHICK University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign As recently as a generation ago, belief in anthropo- morphic supernaturals, including the tlahuelpuchi, a per- son who was born with the capability to change into animal form and an uncontrollable thirst for the blood of infants, was widespread in rural Tlaxcala, Mexico. Though the matrix of beliefs that include the bloodsuck- ing witch has dramatically weakened since the 1960s, occasional infant deaths are still attributed to the actions</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 389 of alternative kinds of knowledge. Each of these efforts is executed with precision and care, but, unquestionably, the first is the most important and will be the most endur- ing contribution for it is virtually certain that no similar data will, or even can, ever be collected again. This book is probably longer than it needs to be, and while some sections (probably chapters 5 through 9, where the deaths are described and analyzed) often read like a good mystery novel, other parts of the book are sometimes turgid. Nevertheless, in this monograph, Hugo G. Nutini and the late John M. Roberts add to the Tlaxcala- Puebla corpus to which the former has now contributed six books and numerous articles. Along with his coauthors and students, Nutini has rendered the Tlaxcala- Puebla valley and surrounding areas among the ethno- graphically best known in Mesoamerica and, indeed, all of the world. 1 Sastun: My Apprenticeship with a Maya Healer. Rosita Arvigo with Nadine Epstein. San Francisco: Harper San Francisco, 1994. 190 pp. HILARY EUSE KAHN State University of New York at Buffalo Nearly everyone who has spent time in Belize has had the opportunity to meet or has at least heard of Rosita Arvigo, the North American woman who learned herbal traditions from Don Elijio Panti, a Mayan bush doctor. Sastun, a narrative record of Arvigo's apprenticeship, is a sensory return to Belize for those with connections to this little country and is a substantial introduction for those without. Vivid descriptions of the flora, fauna, geography, air, and aromas of the bush create a text that allows for immersion and reminiscing. However, this enveloping spirit is an illusion. Most of us will read Sastun not in the field but in our more secure habitats, where we participate in roles distinct from those we inhabit while conducting research. These shifting iden- tities, which are clearly inherent in anthropological field- work, are exposed by the author and experienced by the reader. With the help of a well-versed editor, Arvigo shares her strain in the field as she copes with the need to assume multiple roles as apprentice, mother, wife, friend, daugh- ter, and doctor. The honesty with which she reveals her field experience in Belize makes this book unique. She takes us to the field and puts us in the contradicting and conflicting position of being a participant and an observer at once. Arvigo recounts wonderful stories (although one tends to wonder how she remembers exact conversations from over a decade ago) and detailed descriptions of gathering and using herbs. Simply by following the taxo- nomic structure of the book, we become apprentices ourselves. Each chapter begins with different names and medicinal uses of a specific herb, followed by Arvigo's description of how she gained her knowledge of the par- ticular species. The spirited anecdotes serve as mnemonic devices as she talks us through the methods of her own induction into the world of bush medicine. Rosita Arvigo is not an anthropologist by training, although her experience in Belize is equivalent to ethno- graphic research. Don Elijio Panti clearly resembles an ethnographic informant. Though, while discerning the dialogue between these two individuals, the reader does wonder whether Rosita and her editor realize the politics and ethics involved in producing what could be defined as a salvage ethnography. Innocence and idealization creep into this text as Arvigo praises ancient traditions, Mayan cosmology, and her Mopan bush doctor while scomning the introduction of plastics and the naivete of environ- mentally unaware Mayan milpa farmers. Fortunately, this romantic innocence does not detract substantially from the book overall and can be overcome by taking on the role of apprentice rather than critical student or anthro- pologist. In addition to briefing the reader on the fruits and frustrations of fieldwork and apprenticeship, Sastun of- fers brief images of Belizean and Mayan history and the subsequent interaction between them. It would be an exceptional book for anyone unfamiliar with Belize and the practice of ethnographic fieldwork. Undergraduates would receive a substantial, yet informal, introduction to anthropology's narrative underside, to Belize, to ethno- pharmaceuticals, and to Mayan culture and history. Yet because of its well-written, candid, and interactive text, Sastun has something for everyone. The professional and the personal are successfully bridged in this work as well as in the audience intended to read it. - Pushing Boundaries: Language and Culture in a Mexi- cano Community. Olga A. Vasquez, Lucinda Pease-Al- varez, and Sheila M. Shannon. New York: Cambridge Uni- versity Press, 1994. 220 pp. NORMA GONZALEZ University of Arizona This book is a composite of three independent stud- ies of the language experiences of Mexicano children and households in Eastside, the name given by the authors to a barrio of Lincoln City in the San Francisco Bay area The opening chapters provide a rich, contextualized portrait of the largely immigrant Mexicano community, which resonates with a vibrancy and resilience belying "deficit" models of children's out-of-school experiences. The authors expertly paint a portrait of a community actively and strategically engaged in continuously drawing from an array of multiple sources in order to make sense of their surrounding contexts.
