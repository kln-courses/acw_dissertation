<plain_text><page sequence="1">Sign and Symbol in Hegel's Aesthetics Paul de Man The ideological shrillness of the polemics that surround the advent of literary theory in our time cannot entirely conceal that these debates, however ephemeral and ad hominem they may be, are the external symptom of tensions that originate at the furthest remove from the stage of public debate. Yet their apparent remoteness from common experi- ence does not make them less pressing. What is at stake in these ex- changes is the compatibility between literary experience and literary theory. There is something bleakly abstract and ugly about literary theory that cannot be entirely blamed on the perversity of its practi- tioners. Most of us feel internally divided between the compulsion to theorize about literature and a much more attractive, spontaneous en- counter with literary works. Hence the relief one feels whenever a method of literary study is proposed that allows for a measure of This paper is part of a work in progress on the relationship between rhetorical, aesthetic, and ideological discourse in the period from Kant to Kierkegaard and Marx.

This is the satisfaction with which one encoun- ters the work of a master of literary history such as Renato Poggioli or Ernst-Robert Curtius or a master of formal and structural analysis such as Reuben Brower or Roman Jakobson: the rigor of the method confirms the beauty of its object. But in the craggy field of literary theory one should not be too easily satisfied with one's own satisfaction. Pru- dence is the main virtue of theoretical discipline, and prudence dictates suspicion when one feels too pleased with a methodological solution. The alacrity with which one rushes, as by instinct, to the defense of aesthetic values indicates that the source of one's suspicion should be the compatibility of the aesthetic dimensions of literature with whatever it is that its theoretical investigation discloses. If it is indeed the case that a difficulty exists between the aesthetics and the poetics of literature and that this difficulty is inherent in the matter itself, then it would be naive to believe that one can avoid or dodge the task of its precise description. It is not easy to discover the element, in literature, that can be suspected of interfering with its aesthetic integrity. The urge to conceal it is inscribed, so to speak, in the situation, and this urge is probably strong enough to block direct access to the problem. One has to turn, therefore, to the canonical texts of aesthetic theory that offer the strongest reasoned defense for the equation of art with aesthetic experi- ence. For reasons that have to do with this particular occasion but hardly stand in need of a less personal justification, Hegel's Aesthetics offers perhaps the most arduous challenge to such an enterprise. Nowhere else does the structure, the history, and the judgment of art seem to come as close to being systematically carried out, and nowhere else does this systematic synthesis rest so exclusively on one definite category, in the full Aristotelian sense of the term, called the aesthetic. Under a variety of names, this category never ceased to be prominent in the development of Western thought, so much so that its being left nameless until the end of the eighteenth century is a sign of its overwhelming presence rather than of its nonexistence. And although the posthumous collection of Hegel's Lectures on Aesthetics, suffering as it does from the stylistic in- Paul de Man, Sterling Professor of the Humanities at Yale Univer- sity, is the author of Blindness and Insight and Allegories of Reading and is currently completing a book tentatively titled The Resistance to Theory.

Whether we know it, or like it, or not, most of us are Hegelians and quite orthodox ones at that. We are Hegelian when we reflect on literary history in terms of an articulation between the Hellenic and the Christian Era or between the Hebraic and the Hellenic world. We are Hegelian when we try to sys- tematize the relationships between the various art forms or genres ac- cording to different modes of representation or when we try to conceive of historical periodization as a development, progressive or regressive, of a collective or individual consciousness. Not that such concerns belong exclusively to Hegel; far from it. But the name "Hegel" stands here for an all-encompassing vessel in which so many currents have gathered and been preserved that one is likely to find there almost any idea one knows to have been gathered from elsewhere or hopes to have invented one- self. Few thinkers have so many disciples who never read a word of their master's writings. In the case of the Aesthetics, the persistent power of philosophical synthesis is concentrated in the work's ability to bring together, under the common aegis of the aesthetic, a historical causality with a linguistic structure, an experiential and empirical event in time with a given, non- phenomenal fact of language. In Hegel's well-known and in essence unchallenged division of the history of art in three phases, two of these phases are designated by historical terms-the classic and the Romantic (which in Hegel designates any post-Hellenic, i.e., Christian art)- whereas the third period is designated by the term "symbolic," which we now associate with linguistic structures and which stems not from historiography but from the practice of law and of statecraft. The theory of the aesthetic, as a historical as well as a philosophical notion, is predi- cated, in Hegel, on a theory of art as symbolic. The famous definition of the beautiful as "the sensory appearance [or manifestation] of the idea [das sinnliche Scheinen der Idee]" does not only translate the word "aesthetics" and thus establishes the apparent tautology of aesthetic art (die schionen Kiinste or les beaux-arts), but it could itself best be translated by the statement: the beautiful is symbolic. The symbol is the mediation between the mind and the physical world of which art manifestly par- takes, be it as stone, as color, as sound, or as language. Hegel says so in no uncertain terms in the section on symbolic art. After having stated casually that the symbol can be considered a sign (das Symbol ist nun zundchst ein Zeichen), he goes on to distinguish between the symbolic and the semiotic function and leaves no doubt as to what side of this di- chotomy art is on: "In the case of art, we cannot consider, in the symbol, the arbitrariness between meaning and signification [which characterizes</page><page sequence="4">764 Paul de Man Hegel's Aesthetics the sign], since art itself consists precisely in the connection, the affinity and the concrete interpretation of meaning and of form."' Aesthetic theory and art history are thus the two complementary parts of a single symbolon. Whoever dares, today more than ever, to challenge this article of faith in any of its numerous guises should not expect to get away with it unscathed. Hegel's Aesthetics thus appears to be, traditionally enough, a theory of symbolic form. Yet a disturbing element of personal inadequacy in Hegel himself seems to prevent the tradition of the Aesthetics' interpreta- tion from resting content in this assurance. For one thing, next to the familiar-sounding assertion, which we think we easily enough under- stand, that art partakes of the beautiful and is therefore a sensory man- ifestion of the idea, stands, in the same text, Hegel's more disturbing statement that art is, irrevocably, for us a thing of the past. Would this then mean that the sensory manifestation of the idea is no longer acces- sible to us in this form, that we are no longer able to produce truly symbolic forms of art? And is it not something of an irony of literary history and a concrete disavowal of Hegel that he declared art to have ended at the very moment that a new modernity was about to discover and to refine the power of the symbol beyond anything that Hegel's somewhat philistine taste could ever have imagined? It must have been a poor symbolist indeed who thus declared nineteenth-century Romanti- cism and symbolism stillborn when it was about to write a new chapter in a history which he proclaimed to be over. The contemporary interpretation of the Aesthetics, even when it emanates from writers favorably inclined toward Hegel such as Hans Georg Gadamer, for instance, or Theodor W. Adorno, keeps encoun- tering this difficulty and finds Hegel useless for the understanding of post-Hegelian art and literature. His theory of art as symbol may have prefigured some of what was to come, but his lack of sympathy for his own contemporaries makes him shortsighted and inadequate for the all-important task of our own self-definition, of understanding our own modernity. The attitude is well exemplified in the statement of an astute and sensitive interpreter of nineteenth-century literature who certainly cannot be reproached for an overhasty dismissal of Hegel. In a volume entitled Poetics and Philosophy of History, Peter Szondi (who until his un- timely death directed the seminar for comparative literature at the Free University of Berlin) describes the feeling one cannot help but share upon coming to the section in the Aesthetics where Hegel discusses the 1.

He expects, at long last, to find what he has been looking for-but a great disappointment awaits him [Es wartet eine grosse Enttausch- ung auf ihn]. One will have to say, without further ado, that this is one of the least inspired sections in the entire work. [P. 390] From the point of view of contemporary poetics, which certainly tends more and more to imagery and metaphor as an essential trait or even as the essence of the poetic, Hegel's considerations on metaphor and on figuration must seem truly shallow [recht iusser- lich]. ... He does not reach an adequate understanding of meta- phor and simile. [P. 395] When Proust compares a moon which is already visible in daylight to an actress who has entered the theater well before making her entree on the stage, and who, not yet made up or dressed, merely watches her fellow players, then we may well ask if it is legitimate, in a case like this, to distinguish between the abstract and the con- crete, between meaning and image. The secret meaning of such comparisons must be sought in the discovery of analogies, of correspondences-the very correspondances which Baudelaire cele- brates in his famous poem. To the poetic outlook they appear as the guarantee of the unity of the world. . . . One can certainly not reproach Hegel for his inability to notice such correspondences (although they do not appear only in modern poetry), but one cannot deny that it is his inadequate conception of the essence of language which is the cause of his failure. [P. 396] From this point on, we can begin to see the limitations of Hegel's aesthetics. [P. 390] Hegel, then, is a theoretician of the symbol who fails to respond to symbolic language. This does not allow us to dismiss his aesthetics en- tirely, since he was at least on the right track, but it allows us to say that we no longer need him, since we have travelled so much further along the same road. And it is certainly true that Hegel's theory of the symbolic seems halfhearted compared to that of contemporaries such as Georg Friedrich Creuzer (whom he mentions critically), Friedrich Schelling (whom he does not mention at all in that context), or Friedrich Schlegel (about whom he never has a kind word to say). Could it be that Hegel is 2.

The answer to this question takes us on a circuitous route, first away from and then back to the Aesthetics, a route on which I only have time to point out some stations in an itinerary that is not, I am afraid, an entirely easy walk. Hegel's assertion that art belongs unreservedly to the order of the symbolic is made in the context of a distinction between symbol and sign that in the realm of art does not seem to apply. A great deal hinges on this distinction which recurs, though not very conspicuously, throughout the Hegelian corpus, most explicitly in a paragraph of the earlier Ency- clopedia of the Philosophical Sciences of 1817 (the Aesthetics is from 1830). It occurs in a section where Hegel is concerned with the distinctions be- tween the faculties of the intellect, more specifically, the distinction between perceiving, imagining (or representing), and thinking (Anschauung, Vorstellung, and Denken); the discussion of language is a subsection of the discussion of representation. Here Hegel offers a characterization of the sign which stresses the arbitrariness of the re- lationship between the sensory component necessarily involved in any signification and the intended meaning. The red, white, and green flag of Italy bears no actual relationship to the color of the country which, as seen from the air, is predominantly ochre in color; only very naive chil- dren are supposed to be cute enough to be amazed that Italy actually does not have the same uniform color it has in their atlas. The symmetri- cal obverse of this observation is that of Roland Barthes reflecting on the naturalization of the signified in his analysis of an advertisement for spaghetti, in which the white pasta, the red tomatoes, and the green peppers are so irresistibly effective because they convey, at least to the non-Italian, the illusion of devouring, of interiorizing the very essence of italianite--and very cheaply at that. As such, in its arbitrariness, the sign, says Hegel, differs from the symbol, a perception whose own determination [or meaning] more or less corresponds, essentially and conceptually, to the content it expresses as a symbol, whereas, in the case of the sign, the proper content of the perception [the red, white, and green of the flag] and the content of which it is a sign [Italy] have nothing to do with each other [Enz. III, p. 270, par. 458]. There is nothing unusual about this characterization of the sign since the stress on its arbitrariness has numberless antecedents well be- fore Ferdinand de Saussure. Somewhat less common are the value judgments Hegel derives from his analysis; although it would not be</page><page sequence="7">Critical Inquiry Summer 1982 767 correct to say that Hegel valorizes the sign over the symbol, the reverse would be even less true. "Das Zeichen," says Hegel, "muss fiir etwas Grosses erklirt werden [the sign must be proclaimed to be something great]." What is it then that is so "great" about the sign? To the extent that the sign is entirely independent with regard to the objective, natural properties of the entity toward which it points and instead posits prop- erties by means of its own powers, the sign illustrates the capacity of the intellect to "use" the perceived world for its own purposes, to efface (tilgen) its properties and to put others in their stead. This activity of the intellect is both a freedom, since it is arbitrary, and a coercion, since it does violence, as it were, to the world. The sign does not actually say what it means to say or, to drop the misleading anthropomorphic metaphor of a speaking sign endowed with a voice, the predication involved in a sign is always citational. When I say, "The red, white, and green flag is Italian," this predicative sentence is always what in scholastic terminology is called an actus signatus: it presupposes an implicit subject (or I) which frames the statement and makes it into a quotation: I say (or I declare, or I proclaim) that the red, white, and green flag is Italian-a specification which does not have to occur when, in ordinary conversation, I say, "The city of Rome and the Apennines are Italian." The sign is so "great," so crucially important, because it touches upon the question of the relation- ship between subject and predicate in any declarative sentence. From the question of the sign we are taken, then, by the logic of the passage itself, to the question of the subject-a topic on which Hegel has a great deal to say, perhaps most strikingly of all in a much earlier section of the Ency- clopedia. Paragraph 20 of the Encyclopedia has to do with the definition of thinking or with the conditions necessary for a science of logic. It states Hegel's equivalence of the Cartesian cogito by establishing the link be- tween the general predicates of thought and the thinking subject. In order to understand thought, to think about thought, thought has to be represented, and this representation can only be that of the thinking subject: "the simple expression of the existing subject as thinking subject is I," says Hegel in a passage rich in Fichtean resonances. But this rela- tively straightforward and traditional, Cartesian, if you wish, or, at any rate, specular conception of the subject leads at once to less predictable complications. The thinking subject is to be kept sharply distinguished from the perceiving subject, in a manner that is reminiscent of (or that anticipates) the distinction we have just encountered in the dif- ferentiation between sign and symbol. Just as the sign refuses to be in the service of sensory perceptions but uses them instead for its own pur- poses, thought, unlike perception, appropriates the world and literally "subjects" it to its own powers. More specifically, thought subsumes the infinite singularity and individuation of the perceived world under or- dering principles that lay claim to generality. The agent of this appro-</page><page sequence="8">768 Paul de Man Hegel's Aesthetics priation is language. "Since language," says Hegel, "is the labor of thought, we cannot say anything in language that is not general"-a sentence with which Kierkegaard will take issue, in an ironic mode, in Fear and Trembling. Thus the sign, random and singular at its first posi- tion, turns into symbol just as the I, so singular in its independence from anything that is not itself, becomes, in the general thought of logic, the most inclusive, plural, general, and impersonal of subjects. As such, it is also the most disinterested and self-effacing of subjects. Certainly, since the validity of thought resides in its generality, we cannot be interested, in thought, in the private, singular opinions of the thinker but will expect from him a more humble kind of philosophical self- forgetting. "When Aristotle," says Hegel, "demands [from the philoso- pher] that he live up to the dignity of his calling, then this dignity consists of his ability to discard particular opinions.., .and to leave things to be what they are in their own right" (Enz. I, p. 80, par. 23). When philos- ophers merely state their opinion, they are not being philosophical. "Since language states only what is general, I cannot say what is only my opinion [... so kann ich nicht sagen was ich nur meine]." The German version is indispensable here since the English word "opinion," as in public opinion (6ffentliche Meinung), does not have the connotation of "meaning" that is present, to some degree, in the German verb meinen. In Hegel, the assimilation of "meaning" to "me" (or I) is built into the system, since the generality of thought is also the appropriation, the making mine of the world by the I. It is, therefore, not only legitimate but necessary to hear, in the German word meinen (as in the sentence: Ich kann nicht sagen was ich nur meine) a connotation of meinen as "to make mine," a verbalization of the possessive pronoun mein. But that makes the innocuous pronouncement about the philosopher who, in humble self-effacement, has to progress beyond his private opinion, into a very odd sentence indeed: "Ich kann nicht sagen was ich (nur) meine" then means "I cannot say what I make mine" or, since to think is to make mine, "I cannot say what I think," and, since to think is fully contained in and defined by the I, since Hegel's ego cogito defines itself as mere ego, what the sentence actually says is "I cannot say I"-a disturbing proposi- tion in Hegel's own terms since the very possibility of thought depends on the possibility of saying "I." Lest this itinerary by way of the signifier meinen appear too arbitrary to be taken seriously, the sequel to the passage makes explicit what one can already choose to hear in the original sentence. Hegel goes on to discuss the logical difficulty inherent in the deictic or demonstrative function of language, in the paradox that the most particular of des- ignations such as "now," "here," or "this" are also the most powerful agents of generalization, the cornerstones of this monument of gener- ality that is language-a paradox perhaps inherent in the Greek word deiktik-os, which means "to point to" as well as "to prove" (as in the French</page><page sequence="9">Critical Inquiry Summer 1982 769 word demontrer). If this is so for adverbs or pronouns of time and place, it is even more so for the most personal of personal pronouns, the word "I" itself. "All other humans have in common with me to be I, as all my feelings, representations, etc., have in common with each other to be distinctively my own." The word "I" is the most specifically deictic, self- pointing of words, yet it is also "the most entirely abstract generality." Hegel can therefore write the following quite astonishing sentence: "When I say 'I,' I mean myself as this I at the exclusion of all others; but what I say, I, is precisely anyone; any I, as that which excludes all others from itself [ebenso, wenn ich sage: 'Ich,' meine ich mich als diesen alle anderen Ausschliessenden; aber was ich sage, Ich, ist ebenjeder]" (Enz. I, p. 74, par. 20). In this sentence, the otherness of'"jeder" does not desig- nate in any way a specular subject, the mirror image of the I, but pre- cisely that which cannot have a thing in common with myself; it should be translated, in French, not as autrui, not even as chacun, but as n'importe qui or even n'importe quoi. The contradiction between "sagen" and "meinen," between "to say" and "to mean," between dire and vouloir dire is an explicitation of the previous sentence "Ich kann nicht sagen was ich (nur) meine" and a confirmation that it also has to be read, next to its ordinary meaning, in the sense of "I cannot say I." Thus, at the very onset of the entire system, in the preliminary consideration of the science of logic, an inescapable obstacle threatens the entire construction that follows. The philosophical I is not only self- effacing, as Aristotle demanded, in the sense of being humble and in- conspicuous, it is also self-effacing in the much more radical sense that the position of the I, which is the condition for thought, implies its eradication, not, as in Fichte, as the symmetrical position of its negation but as the undoing, the erasure of any relationship, logical or otherwise, that could be conceived between what the I is and what it says it is. The very enterprise of thought seems to be paralyzed from the start. It can only get under way if the knowledge that renders it impossible, the knowledge that the linguistic position of the I is only possible if the I forgets what it is (namely, I), if this knowledge is itself forgotten. The way in which the passage we are reading (par. 20 of the Encyclo- pedia) forgets its own statement is by describing the predicament it states, which is a logical difficulty devoid of any phenomenal or experiential dimension, as if it were an event in time, a narrative, or a history. At the beginning of the paragraph, after having apodictically asserted that the act of thought predicates generality, Hegel adds, as if it were a word of caution, that these assertions cannot, at this point, be proven. We should nevertheless not consider them, he says, as his own opinions (meine Meinungen) but should take them to be facts. We can verify these facts by way of the experience of our own thought, by testing them, trying them out upon ourselves. But this experimentation is only accessible to those "who have acquired a certain power of attention and abstraction," that is</page><page sequence="10">770 Paul de Man Hegel's Aesthetics to say, who are capable of thought. The proof of thought is possible only if we postulate that what has to be proven (namely, that thought is possible) is indeed the case. The figure of this circularity is time. Thought is proleptic: it projects the hypothesis of its possibility into a future, in the hyperbolic expectation that the process that made thought possible will eventually catch up with this projection. The hyperbolic I projects itself as thought in the hope of re-cognizing itself when it will have run its course. This is why thought (denken) is ultimately called by Hegel Erkenntnis (which implies recognition) and is considered to be superior to knowledge (wissen). At the end of the gradual progression of its own functioning, as it moves from perception to representation and finally to thought, the intellect will refind and recognize itself. A great deal is at stake in this anagnorisis which constitutes the plot and the suspense of Hegel's history of the mind. For if "the action of the intellect as mind is called recognition" in an all-inclusive sense, and if the mind has invested, so to speak, all its chances in this future possibility, then it matters greatly whether or not there will be something there to be rec- ognized when the time comes. "The principal question for modern times depends on this," says Hegel, "namely, whether a genuine rec- ognition, that is, the recognition of the truth, is possible" (Enz. III, p. 242, par. 445). The truth is all around us; for Hegel who, in this respect, is as much of an empiricist as Locke or Hume, the truth is what happens, but how can we be certain to recognize the truth when it occurs? The mind has to recognize, at the end of its trajectory-in this case, at the end of the text-what was posited at the beginning. It has to recognize itself as itself, that is to say, as I. But how are we to recognize what will neces- sarily be erased and forgotten, since "I" is, per definition, what I can never say? One understands the necessity for the mind to shelter itself from self-erasure, to resist it with all the powers of the intellect. This resistance takes a multitude of forms, among which the aesthetic is not the least efficacious. For it is not difficult to see that the problem can be recast in terms of the distinctiveness between sign and symbol. As we saw, the I, in its freedom from sensory determination, is originally similar to the sign. Since, however, it states itself as what it is not, it represents a determined relationship to the world that is in fact arbitrary, that is to say, it states itself as symbol. To the extent that the I points to itself, it is a sign, but to the extent that it speaks of anything but itself, it is a symbol. The re- lationship between sign and symbol, however, is one of mutual oblitera- tion; hence the temptation to confuse and to forget the distinction be- tween them. The temptation is so strong that Hegel himself, who knows the necessity for this distinction with all possible clarity, cannot resist it and falls back into the confusion he has denounced, offering a theory of art as symbol which, except for being somewhat halfhearted, is quite traditional. But this does not prevent the symbol from being, in Hegel's</page><page sequence="11">Critical Inquiry Summer 1982 771 own terms, an ideological and not a theoretical construct, a defense against the logical necessity inherent in a theoretical disclosure. This ideology of the symbol is very familiar to us in the common- places of our own historical discourse on literature. It dominates, for example, the discussion of Romanticism in its relation to its neoclassical antecedents as well as to its heritage in modernity. It determines the polarities that shape the value judgments implicated in these discussions: such familiar oppositions as those between nature and art, the organic and the mechanical, pastoral and epic, symbol and allegory. These categories are susceptible to infinite refinement, and their interplay can undergo numberless combinations, transformations, negations, and ex- pansions. The commanding metaphor that organizes this entire system is that of interiorization, the understanding of aesthetic beauty as the external manifestation of an ideal content which is itself an interiorized experience, the recollected emotion of a bygone perception. The sensory manifestation (sinnliches Scheinen) of art and literature is the outside of an inner content which is itself an outer event or entity that has been inter- nalized. The dialectics of internalization make up a rhetorical model powerful enough to overcome national and other empirical differences between the various European traditions. Attempts, for instance, to mediate between Hegel and English Romantics such as Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Keats often turn around the distinctive topoi of inter- nalization: secularized versions of the Fall and the Redemption of man as a process of consciousness, for example, or the subjectivism associated, at least since Kant, with the problematics of the sublime. In all these instances, Hegel can be invoked as the philosophical counterpart of what occurs with greater delicacy in the figural inventions of the poets. For Hegel is indeed, from the relatively early Phenomenology to the late Aesthetics, prominently the theoretician of internalization, of Er-innerung as the ground of the aesthetic as well as of the historical consciousness. Erinnerung, recollection as the inner gathering and preserving of experi- ence, brings history and beauty together in the coherence of the system. It is also an integral part of the ideology of the symbol which Hegel both espouses and undoes. The question remains, however, whether the ex- ternal manifestation of the idea, when it occurs in the sequential devel- opment of Hegel's thought, indeed occurs in the mode of recollection, as a dialectic of inside and outside susceptible to being understood and articulated. Where is it, in the Hegelian system, that it can be said that the intellect, the mind, or the idea leaves a material trace upon the world, and how does this sensory appearance take place? The answer takes a hint from the same section (p. 271, par. 458) near the end of the Encyclopedia in a discussion on the structure of the sign, with which we began. Having stated the necessity to distinguish between sign and symbol and alluded to the universal tendency to con- flate one with the other, Hegel next makes reference to a faculty of the</page><page sequence="12">772 Paul de Man Hegel's Aesthetics mind which he calls Geddichtnis and which "in ordinary [as opposed to philosophical] discourse is often confused with recollection [Erinnerung] as well as with representation and imagination"-just as sign and symbol are often used interchangeably in such modes of ordinary parlance as literary commentary or literary criticism (Enz. III, p. 271, par. 458). Gediichtnis, of course, means memory in the sense that one says of some- one that he has a good memory but not that he has a good remembrance or a good recollection. One says, in German, "sie or er hat ein gutes Ged~chtnis," and not, in that same sense, "eine gute Erinnerung." The French memoire, as in Henri Bergson's title Matiere et Memoire, is more ambivalent, but a similar distinction occurs between memoire and souvenir; un bon souvenir is not the same as une bonne memoire. (Proust struggles with the distinction in his attempts to distinguish between memoire volontaire-which is like Gediichtnis-and memoire involontaire, which is rather like Erinnerung.) The surprise, in Hegel, is that the progression from perception to thought depends crucially on the mental faculty of memorization. It is Gediichtnis, as a subspecies of representation, which makes the transition to the highest capacity of the thinking intellect: the echo of denken preserved in the word "Gediichtnis" suggests the close proximity of thought to the capacity of remembering by memorization. In order to understand thought, we must first understand memory, but, says Hegel, "to understand the place and the meaning of memory in the systematic study of the intellect and in its organic connection with thought is one of the most readily ignored and most difficult points in the study of the mind" (Enz. III, p. 283, par. 464). Memorization has to be sharply distinguished from recollection and from imagination. It is entirely devoid of images (bildlos), and Hegel speaks derisively of peda- gogical attempts to teach children how to read and write by having them associate pictures with specific words. But it is not devoid of materiality altogether. We can learn by heart only when all meaning is forgotten and words read as if they were a mere list of names. "It is well known," says Hegel, "that one knows a text by heart [or by rote] only when we no longer associate any meaning with the words; in reciting what one thus knows by heart one necessarily drops all accentuation." We are far removed, in this section of the Encyclopedia on memory, from the mnemotechnic icons described by Frances Yates in The Art of Memory and much closer to Augustine's advice about how to remember and to psalmodize Scripture. Memory, for Hegel, is the learning by rote of names, or of words considered as names, and it can therefore not be separated from the notation, the inscription, or the writing down of these names. In order to remember, one is forced to write down what one is likely to forget. The idea, in other words, makes its sensory ap- pearance, in Hegel, as the material inscription of names. Thought is entirely dependent on a mental faculty that is mechanical through and through, as remote as can be from the sounds and the images of the</page><page sequence="13">Critical Inquiry Summer 1982 773 imagination or from the dark mine of recollection, which lies beyond the reach of words and of thought. The synthesis between name and meaning that characterizes mem- ory is an "empty link [das leere Band]" and thus entirely unlike the mutual complementarity and interpenetration of form and content that characterizes symbolic art (Enz. III, p. 281, par. 463). It is not aesthetic in the ordinary or in the classically Hegelian sense of the word. However, since the synthesis of memory is the only activity of the intellect to occur as sensory manifestation of an idea, memory is a truth of which the aesthetic is the defensive, ideological, and censored translation. In order to have memory one has to be able to forget remembrance and reach the machinelike exteriority, the outward turn, which is retained in the Ger- man word for learning by heart, aus-wendig lernen. "It is in names that we think," says Hegel (Enz. III, p. 278, par. 462); names, however, are the hieroglyphic, silent inscriptions in which the relationship between what one perceives and what one understands, between the written letter and the meaning, is only exterior and superficial. "Visible, written language," says Hegel, "relates to voice, to sounded language, only as a sign" (Enz. III, p. 277, par. 459). In memorization, in thought and, by extension, in the sensory manifestation of thought as an "art" of writing, "we are dealing only with signs [wir haben es iiberhaupt nur mit Zeichen zu tun]." Memory effaces remembrance (or recollection) just as the I effaces itself. The faculty that enables thought to exist also makes its preserva- tion impossible. The art, the techne, of writing which cannot be separated from thought and from memorization can only be preserved in the figural mode of the symbol, the very mode it has to do away with if it is to occur at all. No wonder, then, that Hegel's Aesthetics turns out to be a double and possibly duplicitous text. Dedicated to the preservation and the monumentalization of classical art, it also contains all the elements which make such a preservation impossible from the start. Theoretical reasons prevent the convergence of the apparently historical and the properly theoretical components of the work. This results in the enigmatic state- ments that have troubled Hegel's readers, such as the assertion that art is for us a thing of the past. This has usually been interpreted and criticized or, in some rare instances, praised as a historical diagnosis disproven or borne out by actual history. We can now assert that the two statements "art is for us a thing of the past" and "the beautiful is the sensory manifestation of the idea" are in fact one and the same. To the extent that the paradigm for art is thought rather than perception, the sign rather than the symbol, writing rather than painting or music, it will also be memorization rather than recollection. As such, it belongs indeed to a past which, in Proust's words, could never be recaptured, retrouv4. Art is "of the past" in a radical sense, in that, like memorization, it leaves the interiorization of experience forever behind. It is of the past to the</page><page sequence="14">774 Paul de Man Hegel's Aesthetics extent that it materially inscribes, and thus forever forgets, its ideal content. The reconciliation of the two main theses of the Aesthetics occurs at the expense of the aesthetic as a stable philosophical category. What the Aesthetics calls the beautiful turns out to be, also, something very remote from what we associate with the suggestiveness of symbolic form. Before dismissing it as simply, or merely, ugly, one should perhaps bear in mind what Proust has to say in Swann's Way about symbols which, unlike metaphors, do not mean what they say. "Such symbols are not represented symbolically [le symbole (n'est) pas represente comme un symbole] since the symbolized thought is not expressed but the symbol represented as real, as actually inflicted or materially handled [puisque la pensee symbolisee (n'est) pas exprimee, mais (le symbole represente) comme re'el, comme effectivement subi ou materiellement manie]." This symbol that is not symbolic is much like the theory of the aesthetic which, in Hegel, is no longer aesthetic, like the subject which has to say "I" but can never say it, the sign which can only survive as a symbol, a conscious- ness (or subconsciousness) which has to become like the machine of mechanical memory, a representation which is in fact merely an inscrip- tion or a system of notation. Such signs, says Proust, may have a special beauty, "une etrangete saissante," which will be appreciated only much later, at a degree of aesthetic and theoretical remove so advanced as to be always "of the past" and not our own. The passage in Proust from which I am quoting deals with Giotto's allegories of the Vices and of the Virtues in the frescoes of the Arena at Padua. If we then wonder, as we should, where it is, in Hegel's Aesthetics, that the theory of the sign manifests itself materially, we would have to look for sections or art forms which Hegel explicitly says are not aesthet- ic or beautiful. Such is the case for the brief chapter, at the end of the section on symbolic art, on allegory. Allegory, in conforming with the received opinion of Hegel's day which was, not unproblematically, as- sociated with Goethe, is dismissed as barren and ugly (kahl). It belongs to the belated, self-consciously symbolic modes (Hegel calls them "com- parative") which, "instead of presenting things or meanings according to their adequate reality, only present them as an image or a parable" and which are therefore "inferior genres [untergeordnete Gattungen]" (Aes, p. 488). Before allowing Hegel's dismissal to dismiss the problem, one should remember that, in a truly dialectical system such as Hegel's, what appears to be inferior and enslaved (untergeordnet) may well turn out to be the master. Compared to the depth and beauty of recollection, mem- ory appears as a mere tool, a mere slave of the intellect, just as the sign appears shallow and mechanical compared to the aesthetic aura of the symbol or just as prose appears like piecework labor next to the noble craft of poetry-just as, we may add, neglected corners in the Hegelian canon are perhaps masterful articulations rather than the all too visible</page><page sequence="15">Critical Inquiry Summer 1982 775 synthetic judgments that are being remembered as the commonplaces of nineteenth-century history. The section on allegory, apparently so conventional and dis- appointing, may well be a case in point. Allegory, says Hegel, is primarily a personification produced for the sake of clarity, and, as such, it always involves a subject, an I. But this I, which is the subject of allegory, is oddly constructed. Since it has to be devoid of any individuality or human specificity, it has to be as general as can be, so much so that it can be called a "grammatical subject." Allegories are allegories of the most distinctively linguistic (as opposed to phenomenal) of categories, namely grammar. On the other hand, allegory fails entirely in its purpose if one is unable to recognize the abstraction that is being allegorized; it has to be, in Hegel's words, "erkennbar." Therefore, specific predicates of the grammatical subject will have to be enunciated, despite the fact that these specifications are bound to conflict with the generality, the pure gram- maticality, of the "I": Our reading of paragraph 20 of the Encyclopedia threatens the stability of the predicative sentence "I am I." What the allegory narrates is, therefore, in Hegel's own words, "the separation or disarticulation of subject from predicate [die Trennung von Subjekt und Pradikat]." For discourse to be meaningful, this separation has to take place, yet it is incompatible with the necessary generality of all meaning. Allegory functions, categorically and logically, like the defective cor- nerstone of the entire system. We would have to conclude that Hegel's philosophy which, like his Aesthetics, is a philosophy of history (and of aesthetics) as well as a history of philosophy (and of aesthetics)-and the Hegelian corpus indeed con- tains texts that bear these two symmetrical titles-is in fact an allegory of the disjunction between philosophy and history, or, in our more re- stricted concern, between literature and aesthetics, or, more narrowly still, between literary experience and literary theory. The reasons for this disjunction, which it is equally vain to deplore or to praise, are not themselves historical or recoverable by ways of history. To the extent that they are inherent in language, in the necessity, which is also an impossibility, to connect the subject with its predicates or the sign with its symbolic significations, the disjunction will always, as it did in Hegel, manifest itself as soon as experience shades into thought, history into theory. No wonder that literary theory has such a bad name, all the more so since the emergence of thought and of theory is not something that our own thought can hope to prevent or to control.</page></plain_text>
