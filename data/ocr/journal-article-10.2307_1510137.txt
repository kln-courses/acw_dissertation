<plain_text><page sequence="1">From Mythic Motifs to Sustained Myth: The Revision of Rabbinic Traditions in Medieval Midrashim Jeffrey L. Rubenstein New York University ecent years have witnessed a growing interest in the mythic dimension of rabbinic thought. Much of this work emerged from debates between scholars of Jewish mysticism over the origins of kabbalistic myth.1 Should 'The standard (albeit dated) works on rabbinic theology of George Foot Moore (Judaism in the First Centuries of the Christian Era [Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1927- 29]) and Solomon Schechter (Aspects of Rabbinic Theology [New York: Schocken, 1961]) hardly mention myth, although Schechter sometimes designates as "mystical" or as a "legend" what would now be classified as mythic (Aspects, 128-35), and Moore cites a few relevant sources without designating them as mythic (Judaism, 266-69). Efraim E. Urbach (The Sages: Their Concepts and Beliefs [Jerusalem: Magnes, 1979] 193) recognized that certain sages transmitted "mythological teachings concerning the creation of the world" and "introduced remnants" of ancient biblical myths (pp. 194, 230; compare pp. 171, 198, 201 n. 175). Urbach nevertheless consistently balked at accepting myth as any kind of living force in amoraic thought: "the Amoraim absorbed remnants of the myths about the creation of man that were current in their neighborhood, voided them of their mythological content, and superimposed upon them the principles of their faith" (ibid., 230; my emphasis; compare 166, 228). In an extensive discussion of Torah, Urbach (ibid., 198-99, 287) notes sources of a mythic charac- ter, but does not pursue the matter in depth. See also Louis Ginzberg (On Jewish Law and Lore [Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 1955] 63) on "mythological elements" in rabbinic literature: "The hostility of the Jew to myth was continuously on the increase, and that which was objectionable to Israel in Biblical times became still more so in the rabbinic period. We shall not err greatly if we maintain, therefore, that they are faded fragments of very old 89:2 (1996) 131-59</page><page sequence="2">132 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW these origins be sought in external traditions that influenced medieval Ju- daism or within the rabbinic tradition? As is well known, Gershom Scholem claimed that the rabbis rejected myth in order to forge a Judaism based on rationality and law.2 Moshe Idel, on the other hand, argues that mythic conceptions and specifically the mythicization of Torah appear in rabbinic literature.3 While the medieval kabbalists elaborated and developed these ideas, they inherited a mythic worldview from the rabbis. Scholars are now increasingly likely to characterize many classical rabbinic sources as mythic.4 Medieval myth need not have been due to external influence, but should be seen as an internal development within Judaism. Despite the appearance of mythic thought in rabbinic literature, however, a tremendous gulf remains between rabbinic and kabbalistic myth. The full-blown theogonic and cos- mogonic myths of the kabbalists, the complex divine structure of the Sefirot, and the detailed expressions of the theurgic effect of ritual (that is, the effect that specific rituals have upon God or the Sefirot) represent a mode of mythic thinking far more comprehensive than that of the rabbis. In myths." Yitzhak Baer (Yisra'el Ba'amim [Jerusalem: Bialik, 1955] 103-12) argues that rab- binic halakha was of "mythic-magical" character. In his voluminous writings, Jacob Neusner also employs the term "myth" periodically (although not consistently). (See, for example, Torah: From Scroll to Symbol in Formative Judaism [Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1988] 118.) Raphael Patai, finally, has written extensively on biblical and rabbinic myth from a folklor- istic and anthropological perspective. (See Man and Temple [New York: Ktav, 1947] and Hamayim [Tel Aviv: Devir, 1936].) 2Gershom Scholem (On the Kabbalah and Its Symbolism [New York: Schocken, 1969] 88) wrote: "Judaism strove to open up a region, that of monotheistic revelation, from which mythology would be excluded. .. the tendency of the classical Jewish tradition to liquidate myth as a central spiritual power is not diminished by such quasi-mythical vestiges trans- formed into metaphors." He wrote again (On the Kabbalah, 94-95): "For what in rabbinical Judaism, separated the Law from myth? The answer is clear: the disassociation of the Law from cosmic events." On Scholem's position, see Moshe Idel, Kabbala: New Perspectives (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1988) 156-57; and idem, "Rabbinism versus Kabbalism: On G. Scholem's Phenomenology of Judaism," Modern Judaism 11 (1991) 281-97. Actually Scholem uses "myth" in a loose fashion. When he denies that the rabbis thought in mythic terms, he usually refers to myths of theomachy or theogony, or to the hieros gamos ("sacred marriage"). Scholem generally plays off kabbalah against medieval Jewish rationalist philoso- phy, which he sometimes calls "medieval Rabbinical Judaism" (Scholem, On the Kabbalah, 88) or "Rabbinical tradition" (p. 90), and which was indeed antimythological. 3Idel, Kabbala, 170-72. 4See, for example, Michael Fishbane, "'The Holy One Sits and Roars': Mythopoesis and the Midrashic Imagination," Journal of Jewish Thought and Philosophy 1 (1991) 1-21; and Elliot R.

RUBENSTEIN 133 rabbinic literature one finds mythic motifs-succinct, independent, and self- contained expressions-not fully developed myths. How exactly did rab- binic myth develop into medieval mystical myth? An intermediate stage in the development of Jewish myth appears in medieval midrashim such as the Tanhuma, Pirqe de-Rabbi Eli'ezer, the later portions of Midrash Rabba, and Midrash Tehilim. These texts contain more developed mythic conceptions than does rabbinic literature,5 and they reflect the beginnings of the transition to medieval myth. To understand the development of kabbalistic myth it is necessary to appreciate the first phase of this process, the appropriation and transformation of rabbinic myth in the medieval midrashim. Yet scholars have paid these texts scant atten- tion.6 In this article, I compare mythic traditions of the Tanhuma and Pirqe de-Rabbi Eli'ezer, compositions dating to the eighth or ninth century CE, to those of rabbinic literature.7 To anticipate my conclusion: changes do not occur in the basic mythic perspective but in the expression of mythic themes. The Tanhuma and Pirqe de-Rabbi Elicezer revise rabbinic sources to create their myths; they contain few ideas not documented in classical rabbinic texts. The innovation of these midrashim is in the use of narrative, a de- velopment that several scholars have documented.8 The medieval midrashim 5By "rabbinic literature" I mean "classical rabbinic literature," which includes the Talmuds and amoraic midrashic compilations but not medieval midrashim. 6See Joseph Dan, Hasipur Ha'ivri Bimei Habeinayim (Jerusalem: Keter, 1974) 21, 135-36 (although Dan tends to attribute the resurgence of myth in these texts to external influences). And see Gershom Scholem, Origins of the Kabbalah (1962; reprinted; ed. R. J. Zwi Werblowsky; trans. Allan Arkush; Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 1987) 17. 7My selections come from the standard edition of the Tanhuma, the Tanhuma nidpas. Tanhuma-Yelammedenu collections include the standard edition of the Tanhuma, the recen- sion of the Tanhuma published by Solomon Buber, Midrash Tanhuma Cal Hamisha Humshe Torah (Vilna: Romm, 1885) (based on MS Oxford Neubauer 154), Pesiqta Rabbati, Deuteronomy Rabba, Numbers Rabba 15-23 and Exodus Rabba 15-52. Efraim E. Urbach and others pro- posed that these compilations drew from an earlier source, but copyists/editors treated the texts freely-adding, subtracting, and changing at will. That is, Tanhuma traditions represent a genre rather than a specific document. See Efraim E. Urbach, "Tanhuma-Yelammedenu Fragments," Qobes 'alyad 16 (1966) 3 [Hebrew]; and Chaim Milikowsky, "The Status Quaestionis of Research in Rabbinic Literature," JJS 39 (1988) 209-10.

Exegesis in rabbinic sources often becomes story in the medieval midrashim. When the sources contain mythic motifs, the story will be an extended myth. In this way the later midrashim constitute a link in the transition from rabbinic to kabbalistic myth. The emergence of the latter was an internal Jewish development attributable, at least in part, to the appearance of new literary forms.9 Before entering a detailed discussion, I must briefly comment on my definition of myth. The definition of myth has received much scholarly attention but is still a source of major debate.10 This is not the venue to enter into an extended discussion of this intractable topic. I use myth in one of its widely accepted senses: myth is a mode of perception that un- derstands phenomena in terms of their essential and cosmic significance and locates their origin in a time outside of history. Myth generally re- counts how things came to be, and tells of the paradigmatic acts of the gods (God) or the ancestors.1l The Transformation of the Akedah," Prooftexts 6 (1986) 97-117; idem, "Rhetoric, Motif and Subject-Matter-Toward an Analysis of Narrative Technique in Pirke de-Rabbi Eliezer," Jerusa- lem Studies in Jewish Folklore 13/14 (1991-92) 99-126 [Hebrew]; and Ofra Meir, "Hasipur Hadarshani Bemidrash Qadum Ume'uhar," Sinai 86 (1980) 246-66.

See also the , iscussion of the Tanhuma a,ld its relationship to its sources in Kensky, Midrash Tanhuma, 46-76. 9The development of narrative may, of course, have been influenced by outside cultures. See Dan, Hasipur Ha'ivri, 135-36. "'John W. Rogerson (Myth in Old Testament Interpretation [Berlin: de Gruyter, 1971]) thus writes an entire book surveying theories of myth as applied to the Bible. Geoffrey Stephen Kirk (Myth: Its Meaning and Functions in Ancient and Other Cultures [London: Cambridge University Press, 1970] 8-31) surveys general theories of myth. Ivan Strenski (Four Theories of Myth in Twentieth-Century History: Cassirer, Eliade, Levi-Strauss and Malinowski [Iowa City: University of Iowa Press, 1987] 1-12 and 194-99) concludes that myth is used in so many ways that it is "everything and nothing." Given this scholarly morass one might well say-to paraphrase what James Kugel ("Two Introductions to Midrash," Prooftexts 3 [1983] 144) has written about midrash-that since many other studies have not defined myth ad- equately, there is little purpose in not defining it again. IMircea Eliade championed this view.

RUBENSTEIN 135 I Mythic Views of Temple and Torah A place to begin is by comparing the famous myth of the temple as cosmic center found in the Tanhuma with its antecedent rabbinic traditions. Rabbinic Traditions (1)13 R. Eliezer says, "The world was created from its center, as it is said, 'When the earth melts into a mass, and its clods stick to- gether.' 14 The sages say: The world was created from Zion, as it says. .. "[God the Lord spoke and sum- moned the world from east to west.] From Zion, perfect in beauty."15 (2a) After the ark was taken [from the Holy of Holies], a stone was there from the time of the first prophets, and it was called mrnc ["foundation"].16 (2b)17 R. Yose says: "From it the world was founded (nn3:),18 as it says, 'From Zion, perfect in beauty.' 19 Tanhuma Qedoshim ?1012 (A) The Land of Israel sits in the middle of the world, and Jerusalem in the center of the Land of Israel, and the temple in the center of Jerusalem, and the Sanctuary (~:'n) in the center of the temple, and the Ark in the middle of the Sanctuary, (B) and the foundation stone (p1n mrn), from which the world was founded, in front of the ark. 99.

According to R. Yose (2b), the world was "founded" upon the foundation stone that lay in the Holy of Holies in the center of the temple. The stone was the beginning of creation, the first establishment of order. The temple thus marks the start of created order in the face of chaos and the foundation upon which that order rests. The Tanhuma offers a highly developed expression of the mythic con- ception of the temple as axis mundi. It has combined two sets of earlier rabbinic traditions. The first traditions concern the initial point of creation. R. Eliezer claims that the world was created from its center, while the sages state that the world was created from Zion. The Talmud presents these as rival opinions: for R. Eliezer the center of the world need not be Zion, while for the sages Zion is the beginning point of creation, not nec- essarily its center.21 The Tanhuma harmonizes these opinions and makes Zion both the center of the world and the initial point of creation. The Tanhuma makes the site of the temple the beginning of creation by appro- priating a second set of rabbinic traditions about the foundation stone at (B). According to these traditions, the world was founded from the "foun- dation stone" (mrin p:) located in the sanctuary of the temple.22 The Tanhuma places the stone in front of the ark in the temple, at the center of the world. Zion/the temple is thus both the center of the world and the beginning of creation.23 While this vision may be implicit in the rabbinic traditions, the Tanhuma explicitly combines and fleshes out the themes.24 The concentric circles focusing in on the stone make not only Zion, but also Israel, Jerusalem, the temple, the sanctuary, and the foundation stone a center. No longer do we have scattered and independent traditions, but a sustained description of the temple as center and the foundation stone as axis mundi. The Tanhuma 20See Eliade, The Sacred and the Profane, 36-47; Levenson, Sinai and Zion, 115-22. 21The Talmud presents the sages as disputing with R. Eliezer. See, however, the tradition immediately following in b. Yoma 54b and Tosafot, ibid., s.v. 'elu. This tradition suggests that the sages considered Zion both the center and the point at which creation began. 22m. Yoma 5.2; t. Yoma 2.14; y. Yoma 5.4, 42c. 23The foundation stone traditions do not express the idea of geographic center as such, but rather the motif of the temple as a fulcrum or "center" of order against chaos, and the idea of the beginning point of creation. See also m. Kelim 1.6-9 which lists ten concentric spheres of increasing holiness, from the land of Israel to Jerusalem, the temple courtyards, and ultimately the Holy of Holies. This geographic scheme essentially duplicates that of the Tanhuma. 24Compare Pirqe de-Rabbi Eli'ezer ?35 (Warsaw: Bomberg, 1852) 82b (= Yalqut Shimoni [Jerusalem: Hatehiya, 1960] ?120 to Gen 28:18): "therefore it is called the 'foundation stone,' for there is the navel of the earth, and from there the whole world spread forth, and upon it the sanctuary stands."

RUBENSTEIN 137 eliminates the interpretation of the verses that link rabbinic ideas to scrip- ture. The Tanhuma tradition is not exegesis, but an independent composi- tion, a myth. It cannot quite be called narrative, since it recounts no sequence of events, but it comprises an extended and well-integrated expression of several disparate ideas. While the earlier rabbinic traditions and the Tanhuma express the same mythic trope of the temple as center and beginning of creation, the latter's formulation is far more developed.25 From mythic views of the temple we turn to mythic views of Torah. An impressive example of the Tanhuma's transformation of earlier mythic motifs appears in Tanhuma Bereshit ?1: Rabbinic Traditions Tanhuma Bereshit ?126 (1) "[And I was with him as a] [A] It [Torah] was the artisan confidant (pl1n)."27 An artisan (IltR)28 of all of creation, as it says, (lmtn).

RUBENSTEIN 141 Leviticus Rabbah details the process of creation in even more concrete imagery. Promulgation of the divine law was not only a legislative act, but also a physical-material process. The divine artisan used the laws as tools to hew out the borders of the cosmos much like the sculptor chisels with carving implements. With the laws of the Torah God molded the elements of space and time: the heavens, sea, sand, Depth, and the celestial bodies that determine the reckoning of days, months, and years. The next tradi- tions (3 and 4) make the creation and endurance of the world contingent on the Torah. This devolves from the common mythic view of creation in which the subjugated forces of chaos are always poised to renew their attack on creation and return the cosmos to its primordial state. The cycli- cal, mythic view of time requires creation constantly to be maintained and reactualized through ritual. Only if Israel observed the Torah would God allow the world to exist. Without observance of Torah the world would revert to the primordial chaos, the tohu vavohu. The Tanhuma cites the tradition of the Torah as "artisan" of creation from Genesis Rabbah at (A), but then diverges from its source, the parable of the architect and his diagrams, and instead offers an adaptation of the midrash from Leviticus Rabbah 35.4 in which God etches the elements of creation with the laws. This omission significantly enhances the role of Torah in the process of creation, for the juxtaposition now turns the Leviticus Rabbah material into the explanation and description of the Torah as arti- san. The Torah served not as diagram or model, as in the parable, but as the physical implement that produced the world. By eschewing parabolic discourse the Tanhuma dispenses with the original nimshal, the decoding of the parable, which relates "so God looked into the Torah and created the world." Rather than invite the interpreter to make an imaginative leap to decipher exactly what this means, and so open the door to metaphoric and symbolic understandings, the Tanhuma details the process of creation in no uncertain terms. With Torah God spread forth, founded, sealed off, crushed, and created the cosmos. The Tanhuma has therefore formulated a myth by understanding the midrash to mean that the Torah was the "artisan" liter- ally rather than parabolically. In combining the two rabbinic sources the Tanhuma jettisons Leviticus Rabbah's exegetical link to Lev 26:3, the base verse of the midrash. It therefore loses the wordplay of 'npn ("my laws") and ppn ("etch"), while retaining the prooftexts based on these roots. This move is necessary be- cause the Tanhuma wishes to build on Genesis Rabbah, which speaks of it says, 'God in his wisdom founded the earth (Prov 3:19)'" (Gen. R. 1.4 [Theodor and Albeck, Midrash Bereshit Rabbah, 7]; 1.10 [Theodor and Albeck, Midrash Bereshit Rabbah, 9] and parallels). y. Pe'a 1.1, 16a emphsizes the motif with due hyperbole: "R. Berechia and R. Hiyya of Kefar Tehumin: One said, 'Even the whole world is not worth even one word of Torah,' and one said, 'Even all the commandments of Torah are not worth even one word of Torah."'</page><page sequence="12">142 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW Torah, not "laws," without interrupting the narrative flow.60 So the Tanhuma splices in this second tradition without quoting its point of departure. This results in a minor discontinuity in that the prooftexts are all based on the root pin and play on the now-deleted verse, and therefore appear to be missing their anchor. The continuity of narrative flow, on the other hand, results in a more sustained and extensive mythic composition.61 Freedom from the immediate exegetical context allows greater creative license. Lib- erated from the wordplay on Inprn = laws and ppn = etch, the Tanhuma need not monotonously restate that each part of creation was "etched," but can employ instead a colorful series of verbs-"spread forth," "founded," "sealed off," "crushed," and "created"-to describe the construction of the world. The forging of the cosmos shifts from a magical "etching" to a progression of construction activities appropriate to the phenomenon cre- ated. The combination and reformulation of earlier motifs renders the Torah's role in the creation process more concrete and ultimately mythic. This change in verbs not only renders the passage more vivid, but adds to the mythic texture. The "etching" of Leviticus Rabbah suggests either creatio ex nihilo or creation from the primordial tohu vavohu-the "chaos and formlessness." In the Tanhuma the sea and Depth are "sealed off' and "crushed," not created. These entities of anti-creation existed, but God confined them in order to fashion a realm for the ordered cosmos. The Tanhuma, indeed, acknowledges the danger that the forces of chaos may "pour forth" and "flood the world." This formulation derives from the fa- miliar cosmogonic myth of God triumphing over the primordial waters and restraining them to allow room for creation. They are not "etched" as static features of the world, but temporarily restrained so that the created world can develop. Like the creation account of Genesis 1, Leviticus Rabbah incorporates primordial forces into the created world, while the Tanhuma tradition portrays God/Torah as defeating the powers of chaos. In this way the Tanhuma alludes to mythic cosmogonies that have left traces elsewhere in biblical and rabbinic literature, including the very prooftexts employed by the passage. Job 38:8 recounts that God closed the sea behind doors and commanded "you may come so far and no farther; here your surging waves will stop."62 According to Genesis Rabbah, "the mountains crush the Depth 60Meir ("Hasipur Hadarshani," 260) calls the genre of the Tanhuma material "the homileti- cal story" to reflect both its homiletical-exegetical and narrative character. She points to the "expansion of the narrative fabric" and the "replacement of short, fragmentary stories and the awareness of the verses of the biblical story with a unified and expanded composition." See her analysis of a paradigmatic Tanhuma passage (ibid., 256-66). See also Elbaum, "From Sermon to Story," 105-9. 6iCompare Fishbane, "The Holy One Sits and Roars," 11. 62In Prov 8:29, God "assigned the sea its limits, so that its waters never transgress his command." See also Ps 104:7-9; Job 26:12; 1 Enoch 69.17-19; b. Hag. 12a. In Mekhilta de-</page><page sequence="13">JEFFREY L. RUBENSTEIN 143 so that it not rise up and flood the world," while in other traditions God personally crushes the rebellious waters.63 The almost identical phrase in Job and Genesis Rabbah indicates the rich mythic background of the texts. The motifs of "spreading forth" the heavens and "founding" the earth like- wise derive from mythic cosmogonies: thus Prov 8:29, "When he fixed the foundations of the earth," and Job 9:8, "Who by himself spread out the heavens."64 All these motifs, scattered in disparate earlier sources, have merged into a sustained cosmogony, fully coordinated with the Torah. Torah sets the boundaries that separate sea monsters from the inhabited land, primordial matter from the created world, and chaos from order. The "sealing" parallels a corresponding theme that appears in myths about the temple in which God "sealed off" the Depth with the foundation stone located at the temple's base.65 A concrete image of plugging a chasm with a stone becomes a "magical" sealing with the Torah. The stone, some- times called a "shard," is similarly said to "crush" the Depth and prevent it from flooding the earth, just as the Torah does in the Tanhuma.66 The Rabbi Yishma'el. ba-Hodesh ?6 (ed. Jacob Z. Lauterbach; 3 vols.; Philadelphia: Jewish Pub- lication Society, 1933) 2. 240 and Gen. R. 23.7 (Theodor and Albeck, Midrash Bereshit Rabbah, 2. 228-29) the sea rises and floods the earth at God's command. In later midrashim the sea rebels against God and attempts to break out of its confinement. See the following note. 63Gen. R. 33.1 (Theodor and Albeck, Midrash Bereshit Rabbah, 300); Pesiqta de-Rav Kahana 9.1 (Mandelbaum, ed., 147); Lev. R. 27.1 (Margoliot, Midrash Vayiqra Rabba, 615). See the discussion of Pirqe de-Rabbi Eli'ezer ?5 below and the tradition of God kicking and killing the Prince of the Sea in b. B. Batra 74b, also cited below. If this reflects the origin of the "crushing" image-a notion of God physically restraining the rebellious sea-this is a mythic theomachy. Since in Job 9:8 God "trod on the back of the sea," the motif is undoubt- edly ancient. Ultimately it can be traced back to remnants of theomachies between God and primordial monsters such as Rahab, as evident from the b. B. Batra 74b; see Ps 74:13-14; 89:10; compare Gen. R. 5.2 (Theodor and Albeck, Midrash Bereshit Rabbah, 33). Midrash Tehilim 93.5 (ed. Solomon Buber; Jerusalem: Romm, 1976) 415 contains a related "crushing" motif. To create space for the earth God had to restrict the waters, so he "crushed them down and the air came out of them," thus diminishing their size. (Compare Gen. R. 5.2 [Theodor and Albeck, Midrash Bereshit Rabbah, 33].) In Pesiqta R., 194b: "were it not that he [Leviathan] lies upon the Deep and crushes it, it would rise and destroy the entire earth by flooding it." 64Ps 24:1 reads, "He founded it [the earth] upon the ocean." Job 38:4-6 has, "When I laid the earth's foundations. . . Onto what were its bases sunk?" Prov 8:25-26 says, "Before the mountains were sunk, before the hills I was born, he had not yet made earth and fields, or the world's first clumps of clay," suggesting that mountains were first sunk into the oceans, and the earth founded upon them (compare Ps 136:6). Job 26:7 reads, "He it is who stretched out Zaphon (=heaven; compare Isa 14:13; Ps 48:3) over chaos." See also Ps 19:1, 104:2; Isa 40:22, 44:24. 65Thus Tg. Ps.-J. Exod 28:30 reads: "The foundation stone with which the Master of the World sealed the mouth of the Depth at the beginning." 66See y. Sanh 17.2, 29a: "When David began to dig the foundations of the temple, he dug down fifteen hundred cubits but did not find the Depth. Finally he found a shard (r'u) and tried to lift it. It said to him, 'you cannot.' He said to it, 'Why?' It said, 'Because I crush down</page><page sequence="14">144 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW Torah, not the temple, thus serves as the "protological" foundation of cos- mic order.67 It is important to note that this sealing process also appears in a famous passage of Sefer Yesira where God seals the six spatial dimen- sions by different combinations of letters of the tetragrammaton.68 Where the divine "etching" of Leviticus Rabbah parallels one motif of this mys- tical text (Sefer Yesira also mentions creation by etching with the sefirot), the Tanhuma passage relates to a second scheme-the sealing. The nonmystical context of the Tanhuma renders the concept mythic rather than mystical, but there is clearly an overlap in the cosmogonic perspective. These homologous myths posit the foundation stone of the temple, the Torah, or the Hebrew letters as the ultimate grounding of the ordered cos- mos.69 At [C], the Tanhuma explicitly articulates the point of the preceding material: Torah alone is the foundation of the cosmos-the goal, instru- ment, and essence of creation. In contrast with the suggestive but restrained parable of Genesis Rabbah, the Tanhuma's uninhibited proclamation of mythic conceptions endows it with a highly mythic character. The line serves at the same time as a transition to the following sections, which also use foundation imagery, and which the Tanhuma has borrowed from else- where. The remaining sections develop the motif of the "endurance of the world," which appears in various rabbinic traditions, and then deepen the mythic conceptions by slightly revising these traditions and adding at [D] the theme of the ritual aspect of Torah. Having set forth the mythic view of Torah, the passage now relates that the associated ritual-observing the command- ments and studying the Torah-is crucial to the maintenance of the cos- the Deep here.' He said to it, 'From when were you here?' It said to him, 'From when the All Merciful made his voice heard from Sinai, "I am the Lord your God" (Exod 20:2). Then the earth shook and sank, and I was placed here to press down the Depth.' Even so he did not listen to it. As soon as he lifted it the Depth rose and tried to flood the earth." This tradition nicely illustrates the coexistence of myths of the temple and the Torah by integrating the two con- ceptions. In this temple myth-the temple, the axis mundi, sits above the primordial Depth and prevents it from flooding the world. Yet the shard claims to have occupied its place since the revelation of the Torah at Sinai, not from the moment of creation. It suppressed the forces of chaos only when the Torah was given, for the Torah signals the "creation" of the ordered cosmos. The hybrid conception results from combination of motifs of both temple and Torah myths. 67I have borrowed this felicitous term from Levenson, Sinai and Zion, 103. 68Sefer Yesira 1.13; and see Midrash Aleph Bet 2.2 (ed. Deborah F. Sawyer; Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1993) 36. 69The Tanhuma-Yelammedenu fragments published by Urbach ("Tanhuma-Yelammedenu Fragments," 20-21) contain a tradition related to this mystical conception of the letters of Sefer Yesira. At the outset of creation, God said to the preexistent Torah, "'I need workers.' The Torah said to him, 'I am providing you twenty-two workers'-and they are the twenty-two letters of the alphabet that are in the Torah."</page><page sequence="15">JEFFREY L. RUBENSTEIN 145 mos. The rabbinic traditions did not state this idea explicitly, although it is perhaps implicit in the notion of accepting the Torah. The Tanhuma bluntly states, however, that day and night Israel must study the Torah through which and for which the world was created, since the world endures only on that account. Those who busy themselves with Torah are accordingly designated the "pillars of the world." While the theme of "pillars of the world" also appears in the rabbinic tradition (3), the Tanhuma revises it. In the rabbinic tradition, God kept the pillars firm when Israel accepted the Torah. In the Tanhuma's retelling, Israel sustains the world directly and is therefore identified with the pillars. This subtle shift again enhances the mythic character by removing God and any associated theological elements such as disobedience, sin, and reward. Performance of the necessary ritual maintains the world, and so its practitioners can be designated "pillars." The Tanhuma then moves from the language of "endurance" to that of "founding," providing a prooftext that the world depends upon Torah. The phrase draws on the terminology used of the foundation stone, "from which the earth was founded," which further enhances the mythic perspective.70 Section [G], in yet another version of the pillars motif, identifies the Torah, not Israel, with the pillars. This again deepens the myth by portraying the Torah itself as the world-sustaining element. God does keep other pillars firm when Israel accepts or studies the Torah. Rather, study and observance directly keep the pillars strong and ensure the continuation of the cosmos. The image of the Torah as the pillars unambiguously expresses the motifs of sections [A] and [B] that the structure and order of the world derives from the Torah and depends upon it. Section [F] continues the theme of the endurance of the world, but does not add much to its parallel (4). By citing it after the previous material the Tanhuma has, however, packed a mass of mythic conceptions into one sustained passage, and that is the crux: the composition is much more than the sum of its parts. Every individual motif appears in earlier rabbinic sources. Yet a passage this extensive, or fashioned from such disparate conceptions, is unprecedented. Rabbinic sources contain numerous mythic conceptions; the Tanhuma reveals full-blown myth.71 While rabbinic traditions display mythic features, the Tanhuma does so in a far more pronounced way. The Tanhuma combines discrete earlier rabbinic traditions and creates extensive, sustained compositions. In classic midrashic manner, the Tanhuma fills in the gaps in the rabbinic formula- tion of myths by drawing on other mythic traditions and by combining disparate sources to fashion more complete accounts.

Joshua b. R. Nehemia said: "The waters as- cended mountains and descended into the depths (nlmn) until they reached Oceanus."74 Pirqe de-Rabbi Eli'ezer 5 [A] On the third day all the earth was flat like a plain and the waters covered the surface of the earth. When the word of the Almighty was uttered, "Let the waters be gathered together,"75 the mountains and hills arose from the ends of the earth and they were scattered over the surface of all the earth, and val- leys were formed over the inner parts of the earth; and the waters were rolled together and gathered into the valleys76 as it is said, "And the gathering of the waters he called seas."77 72I have used Gerald Friedlander's translation (Pirke de Rabbi Eliezer, 27-30) and intro- duced minor modifications based on the manuscripts where noted. (I have also replaced Friedlander's archaic biblical translations with contemporary language.) Friedlander based his translation on "a valuable unedited MS belonging to Abraham Epstein of Vienna" (p. xiv) and various other manuscripts and Geniza fragments.

Makor bought the manuscript and published it in a facsimile edition (Pirke de-Rabbi Eliezer: A Critical Edition, Codex C. M. Horowitz [Jerusalem: Makor, 1972]). Michael Higger published the variants from the three main manuscripts Horowitz used in "Pirke Rabbi Elicezer," Horev 8 (1944) 82-120 in a more congenial format. A description of a few of the manuscripts appears in the introduction to Friedlander's translation. 73Gen 1:9. 74Gen.

Sections [A]-[E] of Pirqe de-Rabbi Eli'ezer reflect upon the gath- ering of the waters and sections [F]-[H] on the earth bringing forth plants. Sections [I]-[N] depict the hydraulic system connecting the now-separated waters and the dry land, describing how ocean water enters the clouds, '21Friedlander translates "fructifying rain."

While this third block does not correspond directly to the biblical narrative, it provides closely related and important supplementary material illustrating the relationship of the two main creations of the third day. It is almost superfluous to note that both Pirqe de-Rabbi Eli'ezer's ac- count and the rabbinic traditions are highly mythic. The subject is the primordial creation and ordering of important elements of the cosmos such as vegetation, rain, streams, and clouds. There appears the common mythic theme of the rebellion of the forces of chaos, namely the primordial waters. God is depicted with bold anthropomorphic metaphors. The earth and waters seem to be sentient entities, and graphic sexual imagery describes the male waters impregnating the female earth. Pirqe de-Rabbi Eli'ezer, like the Tanhuma, weave these mythic motifs into an extended narrative.127 This narrative is not completely smooth. There is a clear discontinuity at [D], which introduces the theme of the depths. The transition from [E] to [F] is abrupt. The traditions contained in [G] are not well integrated. The redactor attempts to relate how water from the depths reaches earth and provides for the needs of humans and animals, but the data about the thickness of the earth and Gehenom seem to hang in the air. The following sections actually repeat the description of the hydraulic system in a slightly different form. These units nevertheless form a sus- tained narrative composition. It may be poor narrative, but it is narrative. This protracted narrative flow endows the passage with a highly mythic character and transforms the individual motifs into a consummate myth. Are the mythic motifs new in Pirqe de-Rabbi Eli'ezer or extant in rab- binic literature? To compare the passage with its antecedent traditions: one should notice that [A] imagines what happened as the waters flowed from the surface of the earth and gathered together at God's command. Moun- tains and valleys appeared as the waters receded. Water remained in the valleys, and thus lakes were formed. It is not clear whether the water created these features as it receded, whether God now created them, or whether these were features of the land that had all been submerged and now simply surfaced.128 While this scenario does not find an exact parallel in the rabbinic traditions, a related exegesis of Gen 1:9 is offered by R. Joshua b. Nehemia (1). He focuses on the flow of the waters rather than the emergence of the features of the earth. In order to reach their collecting point, the ocean (Mediterranean), the waters had to flow over terrain that '270n Pirqe de-Rabbi Eli'ezer's revision of rabbinic motifs see Elbaum, "Rhetoric, Motif and Subject-Matter," and Joseph Heinemann, Aggadot Vetoldotehem (Jerusalem: Keter, 1974) 181-99.

RUBENSTEIN 153 included both mountains and depths. The traditions have a common theme: the gathering of the waters defined the contours of the earth. Pirqe de- Rabbi Elicezer clearly provides a more detailed description of the process, but the motif is rabbinic. Pirqe de-Rabbi Eli'ezer continues with the term "forthwith" ('nn) to introduce the next section, the rebellion of the waters. The medieval mid- rashim routinely use this term to connect independent traditions and place them in chronological sequence.129 The parallels demonstrate that this is a common rabbinic motif. In (2a), R. Yehuda personifies the waters as the Prince of the Sea who refuses to remove the waters, while in (2c) the sea itself attempts to expand beyond all limit. Pirqe de-Rabbi Eli'ezer takes the theme of God's rebuke (2b) and assault with his feet (2a) directly from rabbinic sources. As the prooftexts show, these themes ultimately derive from the interpretation of biblical sources, themselves reflexes of ancient Near Eastern myths. Pirqe de-Rabbi Eli'ezer dispenses with the prooftexts and transforms exegesis into narrative, just as the Tanhuma does. The additional trope of God measuring the waters by hand derives directly from Isa 40:12, "Who measured the waters with the hollow of his hand." In this way Pirqe de-Rabbi Eli'ezer combines various motifs to produce an en- hanced myth. Note that Pirqe de-Rabbi Eli'ezer places the rebellion of the waters after they obey God, retreat, and allow the earth to appear at [A]. This makes little sense: the rabbinic traditions more logically have the waters rebel immediately upon being commanded to recede. This section of Pirqe de- Rabbi Eli'ezer is at odds with [A], which portrays the waters obediently carrying out God's order.130 The modified chronology and internal tension results from the Pirqe de-Rabbi Eli'ezer's attempt to forge its narrative out of independent-in this case, contradictory-rabbinic traditions.131 The connective "forthwith" sets them in temporal sequence, but cannot mask the disparate sources in the background. Section [C] continues with the tradition of God making the sand a bound- ary for the sea, a motif that also figures in the Tanhuma passage cited above.'32 This motif seems to be an extension of Leviticus Rabbah which depicts God etching the sea and the sand with the laws. Pirqe de-Rabbi Eli'ezer describes God himself making the boundary and adds a vivid an- 129See Elbaum, "On the Character of the Late Midrashic Literature," 59; Meir, "Hasipur Hadarshani," 260-61; and Kensky, Midrash Tanhuma, 30.

Louis Ginzberg (Legends of the Jews [7 vols.; Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 1909-38] 5. 26) notes that "the eagerness of the waters to obey God's command is. .. a protest against the mythological account of the rebellion of the waters." 13'See Heinemann, Aggadot Vetoldotehem, 182-83, for another example. 132See above, 137-40 for the full source.</page><page sequence="24">154 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW thropomorphic image, comparing God to a man making a fence for his vineyard. The waters are also personified: they return when they "see" the sand. That Pirqe de-Rabbi Eli'ezer jettisons the base verse of its source, Num 26:3, perhaps allows this freedom. Pirqe de-Rabbi Eli'ezer need not have God create with the laws, and so portrays God constructing more tangibly as in the simile. It is also possible that Pirqe de-Rabbi Eli'ezer is simply providing a creative, mythic exegesis of the image of Jer 5:22. This is an excellent example of the minor yet significant development of mythic themes in the late midrashim. The parallel demonstrates that the motif is rabbinic. Section [D] introduces the depths, a motif that appears in the next tra- dition Pirqe de-Rabbi Eli'ezer wishes to introduce and in the ensuing cos- mology. Owing to Pirqe de-Rabbi Eli'ezer's crude narrative abilities and fidelity to antecedent traditions, the brief note backtracks to the time before the gathering of the waters recounted in the previous sections. The midrash does not take complete liberty to retell the story and so must weave to- gether earlier sources. The depths are a common rabbinic trope, as can be seen in (8a), (8b), (9), and the Tanhuma passages above.133 Section [E] continues the account of the gathering of the waters and the emergence of land. At the end of the process the earth floated upon the waters. This cosmology is consistent with rabbinic traditions (5a) and (5b) as can be seen from the common prooftext, Ps 136:6.134 Again Pirqe de- Rabbi Eli'ezer enhances the image by adding a vivid simile that compares the earth to a floating ship. Section [F] proceeds to the creation of vegetation of Gen 1:11. I find no clear rabbinic parallel, although the idea that the Garden is the source of the fertility of the earth appears.'35 This section seems to be straightfor- ward exegesis and constitutes an imaginative anthropomorphic retelling of the biblical motif. Pirqe de-Rabbi Eli'ezer portrays tangible actions: God "opened" an entrance and "brought forth" and "planted" vegetation. Where Genesis 1 has God create through speech, Pirqe de-Rabbi Eli'ezer depicts the process in physical terms. The motif of the garden of course derives from the second creation story in Genesis 2.

The idea, of course, is an extension of the biblical motif, as the prooftext demonstrates. 134See too b. Hag. 12b: "R. Yose said... 'On what does the earth stand? On the pillars, as it is said, "Who shakes the earth from its place, till its pillars shake (Job 9:6)." The pillars stand on the water, as it is said, "To him that spread forth the earth above the waters" (Ps 136:6).'" And see Ginzberg, Legends, 5. 27. 135b. Ta'anit O1a: "The whole earth is watered from the draining of Eden as it is said, 'And a river issues from Eden (Gen 2:10).'" This too emerges directly from the Bible.</page><page sequence="25">JEFFREY L. RUBENSTEIN 155 monizes the accounts by making the garden of Genesis 2 the source of vegetation in Genesis 1. At [G] Pirqe de-Rabbi Eli'ezer explains that the purpose of the creation of vegetation was to provide food for humans. This idea borrows directly from rabbinic tradition (7) which interprets the "table" as a reference to Genesis 1:11. Pirqe de-Rabbi Eli'ezer substitutes Ps 23:5 for Prov 9:2 because Proverbs ascribes the table to Wisdom (nn:n) whereas Psalms at- tributes it to God. Pirqe de-Rabbi Eli'ezer here again revels in graphic descriptions of God's actions. Pirqe de-Rabbi Eli'ezer continues by explaining how water reaches earth so as to irrigate vegetation and provide for human needs, for the previous traditions emphasized the gathering and separation of the waters.136 [H1] paraphrases the rabbinic tradition (8a) that the depth is the ultimate source of water. This explains the necessity of introducing the depth in [D] and [E]. The relevance of the precise thickness of the earth [H2] is debatable. It adds little to the narrative and actually interrupts the flow. Pirqe de- Rabbi Eli'ezer in this case is extremely loyal to the wording of its source.137 The real point comes in the continuation, which apparently derives from a rabbinic tradition (8c) that the depth conducts heat from Gehenom so as to produce the hot springs humans enjoy. In this way Pirqe de-Rabbi Eli'ezer builds a coherent cosmology from rabbinic motifs. It describes how water flows from the depths, rises through the mass of the earth, and even causes the hot springs. The remainder of the chapter, sections [I]-[N], supplements the creation account by detailing the hydraulic system of the world. [I] offers a fasci- nating portrait of the working of the natural world. R. Yehuda's statement [I1] parallels that of R. Levi at (8a), which Pirqe de-Rabbi Eli'ezer already paraphrased at [H1].138 [12] then fleshes this out: the clouds signal the seas, who signal the depths, who call to each other to let waters flow forth. This has no exact parallels in rabbinic sources, but the ideas are there. In (9a) R. Eleazar suggests that the two libations poured during the festival of Sukkot signal to the depths to begin the flow of water to the world. The term "sound" in (9b) is interpreted to refer to rain. Both of these traditions '36On the rabbinic conception of rain and water, see the excellent studies of Raphael Patai, Hamayim; idem, Man and Temple: Ancient Jewish Myth and Ritual (2d ed.; New York: Ktav, 1967) 59-66; and idem, "The 'Control of Rain' in Ancient Palestine," HUCA 14 (1939) 251- 86. '37The difference between fifty and sixty years is trivial. Rabbinic sources themselves are not consistent.

The later midrash provides more detail as to how the process occurs. Where rabbinic traditions personified the depths, Pirqe de-Rabbi Eli'ezer extends the personification to the clouds and seas. Because it describes the regular rain cycle, not the specific Sukkot libations, it has the clouds give the signal and not the Sukkot libations. Once again Pirqe de-Rabbi Eli'ezer develops a rabbinic motif into a more extensive myth. This role of the clouds also derives from rabbinic tradition (10), which Pirqe de-Rabbi Eli'ezer now cites at [J]. The clouds receive from the depths the water for which they have signaled. Note how Pirqe de-Rabbi Eli'ezer slightly modifies its rabbinic source. Whereas Resh Laqish states that the clouds come from below, Pirqe de-Rabbi Eli'ezer has the clouds draw water from the depth in order to integrate the source with its narrative of the rain cycle. 139 Pirqe de-Rabbi Eli'ezer contrasts two types of rain. The first, described in [J]-[L], results from clouds receiving the water from the lower depth and eventually raining it down on earth. The second, described in [M]-[N], results from the initiative of God, who opens the "good treasuries" in heaven. This "male water" derives from the upper depth. The fructifying result of the first type of rain is compared to "debauchery" (rmr), the second type to proper sexual relations. The sense of these similes is not exactly clear to me. The point seems to be that God does not command the first type of rain. The clouds take the initiative, draw water from the depth, and produce the rain. Since rain fertilizes the earth this type of "impregnation" is com- pared to illicit sex (although at [K], God does decide where the rain will fall). The second type of rain, initiated by God from the proper male prin- ciple, the upper depth, is fully licit. These conceptions draw extensively from rabbinic traditions. That God orders the rain to fall where he wills [K] is standard biblical and rabbinic theology.'40 b. Ta'anit 8b (11), in any case, emphasizes that God com- mands (ips) rain, employing the same verb as Pirqe de-Rabbi Eli'ezer. The sexual metaphors of rain copulating with and impregnating the earth are common in rabbinic literature, as seen in the parallels at (12), (13), and elsewhere.'41 R. Yehuda, for example, said that "rain is the husband of the earth."142 The play on iru'' (rainfall) and .unl (impregnate) in (12) could 139In Gen. R. 13.11 (Theodor and Albeck, Midrash Bereshit Rabbah, 120), Resh Laqish disputes with R. Yohanan, who expresses the opposite opinion: that the clouds receive water from above.

RUBENSTEIN 157 not be more explicit. That ~m2- typically has the sense of forbidden or illicit sex may be the source of Pirqe de-Rabbi Eli'ezer's image of debauchery, although that is not the sense in the antecedent rabbinic tradition. The mythic view of the upper waters as male is rabbinic (13).143 Pirqe de-Rabbi Eli'ezer again slightly modifies its source by designating the earth rather than the lower waters as the female principle, as in the rabbinic tradition, but this too coheres with the imagery of rabbinic literature. I find no ex- plicit rabbinic tradition about the "good treasury" as the source of male waters, although several rabbinic traditions consider it the optimal source of rain. In b. B. Batra 25b R. Hisda states, "When Israel occupies their own land the rains descend from the good treasury, but when Israel does not occupy their land the rain does not fall from the good treasury."144 Pirqe de-Rabbi Eli'ezer thus coordinates the male waters with the optimal rains of the good treasury. Both motifs are rabbinic. Pirqe de-Rabbi Eli'ezer's main innovation is the similes in [L] and [N], the contrast between the fertilization of the widow and bride, of debauch- ery and licit sex.145 Both these images are introduced by "forthwith" (nrn) clauses, the typical connectives of later midrashim.146 The usage here dif- fers slightly, however, for the clauses do not function so much to introduce disparate traditions and place them in chronological sequence (see section [B]), but rather to depict the effects of the causes described in the previous sections. The compiler of Pirqe de-Rabbi Eli'ezer seems to have adapted this technique of juxtaposing rabbinic traditions to introduce his own ma- terial. He amplifies the rabbinic motifs of gendered waters and sexual metaphors with the personification of the earth and the graphic sexual images of his similes. When viewed as a whole, there is little in Pirqe de-Rabbi Eli'ezer that lacks rabbinic precedent. In rabbinic sources the mythic motifs are brief and often undeveloped. Pirqe de-Rabbi Eli'ezer appropriates the motifs, expands them, adds imagery, and weaves them into a sustained and elabo- rate composition, a consummate myth. In contrast to the Tanhuma, Pirqe de-Rabbi Eli'ezer seems to have taken more liberty in paraphrasing and rewording its sources. While the Tanhuma cites many of its sources verba- tim or adapts them by deleting phrases or biblical prooftexts and adding terms to connect the sources to one another, in Pirqe de-Rabbi Eli'ezer, many of the "parallels" are of content rather than wording.147 It is indeed '43See too y.

Of course, Pirqe de-Rabbi Eli'ezer may be citing lost sources verbatim, but that is pure speculation.</page><page sequence="28">158 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW not clear that Pirqe de-Rabbi Eli'ezer draws specifically on the sources I have cited; it may have drawn on other sources or on oral traditions. But the basic motifs are attested in rabbinic texts. What is new in both Pirqe de-Rabbi Eli'ezer and the Tanhuma is the extended narrative that trans- forms independent motifs into a sustained myth. B Conclusion As recent scholarship has shown, the style of the Tanhuma and Pirqe de-Rabbi Eli'ezer differs substantively from earlier midrashim, and its genre is much closer to "story" or "narrative" than to "exegesis" or "homily."148 Where the content of the traditions is nonmythic, for example, in traditions about the lives of biblical figures, the later revision approaches a simple narrative, an embellished retelling of the biblical account. When the con- tent includes mythic ideas such as the cosmogony or the powers of the temple, however, the revision emerges as a myth in its own right. The increased mythic quality of the Tanhuma and Pirqe de-Rabbi Eli'ezer should be seen as an internal Jewish development rather than the result of external influences or the "infusion" of myth from outside culture. Woven into larger narratives, the formulations begin to resemble the myths of other cultures and the kabbalah. If there is external influence, it is the influence on literary forms and the development of narrative, perhaps adopted from ambient cultures. The Tanhuma and Pirqe de-Rabbi Eli'ezer do not reflect new ideas as much as a new style. At the same time, the narrative style and freedom from rabbinic midrashic form does allow for creativity and more vivid and daring mythic expressions. No longer subordinate to the prooftext and its language, the later midrashim offer colorful descrip- tions, employ graphic verbs, and compose unrestrained descriptions. These techniques taken together produce a fundamentally different myth than that of rabbinic literature. The medieval midrashim represent a step between the mythic perspec- tive of the rabbinic period and the pervasive mythic thinking of kabbalah. The succinct mythic motifs of the rabbinic period grew into the more pro- nounced expressions of medieval midrashim and subsequently into the thor- '48See the literature cited in n. 8, especially Meir, "Hasipur Hadarshani," 260; and Elbaum, "From Sermon to Story," 109: "The literature of the Tanhuma represents a step, albeit a hesitant and not very successful one, towards the creation of a new type of midrashic litera- ture-an aggadic literature of narrative freed from homily. .. the fact that their work was less than successful cannot blind literary historians from recognizing a revolutionary development in the history of a literature when it actually took place." Elbaum's comparison of the Tanhuma versions of the Akedah midrashim beautifully illustrates this "step." I would say the same of the transformations of mythic traditions in the Tanhuma and Pirqe de-Rabbi Eli'ezer, which was an important, if not "revolutionary," development in the history of Jewish myth.</page><page sequence="29">JEFFREY L.
