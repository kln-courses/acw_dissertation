<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Earliest Dancing Scenes in the Near CEat By Yosef Garfinkel Examining and interpreting the motif of dancing on various artifacts presents two major difficulties. First, dance by its very nature is a dynamic and multi-dimensional activity that takes place in a certain space and time, while drawing and engraving are both, necessarily, static and two dimensional. Second, dancing is usually characterized by the positioning of body parts, dress and make-up, accessories and accompanying objects, whereas painting and engraving, especially when executed on a small scale, can convey only a . .$."._ limited range of qualities variou and, therefore, are highly iE schematic.

Depictions of dancing figures, often misconstrued by archaeologists, are among the earliest representations of the human figure found in the ancient Near East and southeast- ern Europe. On various surfaces, particularly ceramic vessels, a proliferation of dancers appear over a vast geographical expanse from the eighth to the fourth millennia BCE. circumference of the item in a single line and parallel to the rim, regardless of the number of images shown in the vessel. If the figures are shown holding hands, the circle is always a closed one. The dancers' movement in each scene is often uniform and each image faces the same direction. The rhythmic effect that is so characteristic of dancing is illustrated by the spacing of the images at a constant distance from each other. The dancers' bodies are frequently depicted with hands folded upwards and feet folded downwards, a dynamic position that evidences a special effort.

Certain body positions and items of apparel like hats, belts, shoes and masks are portrayed to enhance the ceremonial and dramatic features of the dance. All of these devices are em- ployed to transmit complex messages with an economy of artistic expression. Some of the earliest scenes of dancing in the Near East come from sites in the Levant-all dating from ten thousand years ago. Three Pre-Pottery Neolithic B sites have produced dancing figures either engraved or painted on plaster floors.

Single dancers exhibit certain traits in body posture, the positions of hands and feet and, quite often, unusual "dancing accessories" such as elaborate hairstyles, hats, masks and costumes-sometimes made to resemble specific animals. All of these factors indicate that in Prehistory, as in modern dances prevalent in the tribal societies of Africa and Papua-New Guinea, dancing was an event that required extensive preparation and attention to detail in its presentation. This was not, however, a "performance art" but a highly functional one-and it served the needs of the community rather than the creative impulses of the dancers. Dancing scenes were almost the exclusive way in which the interactions between human beings in the Prehistoric and Protohistoric periods were depicted. The form of the dance (circular, linear or coupled), the dancers' relationships with each other (without physical contact, holding hands, facing rows, grasping images or standing shoulder to shoulder), the gender of the dancers, the direction of their movements (clockwise or anti-clockwise direction), the dance venue (building, tree) and the time of the dance (day or night) clearly attest to the communal nature of the dance ritual. How did dance function in tribal village society, before the advent of the state and written communication, and why did the dance ritual appear to lose its significance with the foundation of urban society? Undoubtedly, human beings continued to conduct ritual dance ceremonies and there are a few dance scenes from the Bronze and Iron Ages, but these are extremely rare. The dance motif reached its zenith in the Near East during the period when the lifestyle in large villages, supported by the controlled production of food, crystallized. The transition from hunting and gathering to the controlled production of food, i.e., the beginning of agriculture, in the Neolithic changed perceptions of time, space and human relationships. Hunters and gatherers work in small bands, exploit an indefinite, wide-ranging territory and obtain their food immediately in exchange for the work invested. In contrast, farmers exploit a defined and smaller territory and produce is received only after a number of months or years. There is no immediate connection between the work invested and the receipt of the product at the end of a lengthy process. The harvest may be under threat from climatic problems, pests and even robbery by other people. As soon as a direct dependence between agricultural work and the seasons was created, agrarian societies had to manage themselves accordingly. Societies that knew how to organize the members of the community during the critical times of the agricultural season succeeded in producing more food, gained an evolutionary advantage and survived. Concentration into large communities spurred a transition from settlements with tens of inhabitants to settlements with hundreds of inhabitants and, even later, settlements that housed thousands of people. Population pressure stressed the intimate networks that characterized small communities, provoking suspicion, competition and alienation. When individuals meet growing competition, the solidarity of the group progressively disintegrates. In order to prevent the disintegration of the social framework, the ranks have to be bound together and the communal ties strengthened. In the circle of dancers, all holding hands, the individual disappears and the circle, in which everyone is identical in body movement, rhythm of movement, dress and accessories, is created. The immense energy required here is directed not to the productive work of hunting or food production, but rather to unity and formulating a sense of identity. Dancing in pre-urban and pre-state societies is an activity that organizes individuals and collectively disciplines them. Those who participate in the dance accept the rules of the community and its rules. As collective values became enshrined in laws and the enforcement of those values invested in authority, the physical activity, or group bonding if you will, diminished in power.

The prehistoric dancers of Mesopotamia and Iran are most likely to be painted on pottery, in a naturalistic, linear or geometric style, while relief decoration is more often used in the west, from the Levant to Anatolia and Armenia, 2 where excavations at prehistoric 3 2 sites produced many of these depictions. They have also been discovered at sites in Greece, the Balkans and elsewhere in southeastern Europe. A painted plastered floor from Tell Halula. Some parts of the painting are badly preserved, but there are twenty-three clear human figures and possibly the outlines of another one. in the position shown here some of the figures are presented on their side (nos. 17-24) and others upside-down (nos. 1-3). On the left side of the scene, the human figures are presented in profile (nos. 1-16, 24) and on the right side the figures appear en face (nos. 17-18, 20-23). The figures in profile are organized in six groups. In each group the figures are standing in a line, one behind the other, with their hands lifted horizontally to shoulder level. The badly preserved figure, no. 24, is also presented in profile near the square shaped element in the center. The pelvic area of the figures is exaggerated, indicating that they are female. After Molist (1998: 84). By the end of the sixth millennium BCE, potters at sites as far north as the Iranian plateau, southern Iran (Fars and Kerman) and as far east as Pakistan began to employ the motif often. In the Balkans and the Danube basin, pottery vessels embellished with dancing figures, in relief or incised, continued to be produced.

We also have a dancing scene from Predynastic Egypt on a unique textile. Nevertheless, by the third millennium BCE the dancing motif is confined to sites in the Levant and is found mainly on seals. As sites in the Near East entered a phase of incipient urbanism, the popularity of the dancing motif began to wane even as it achieved its widest geographical distribution throughout Southwest Asia and into Europe. Dancers from Prehistoric Heartland of Mesopotamia and the Levant A very early depiction of dancers, a scene representing men and women dancing together, was found at Nevali Qori, located in the middle Euphrates region of southeast Turkey (Hauptmann 1993: 66). This large Pre-Pottery Neolithic B village, dated to the eighth millennium, evidenced an unusually rich assemblage of highly decorated artifacts of many types. A rare engraved stone basin fragment from this site shows a curious central figure schematically engraved with a head shaped like a rhombus with two eyes and a body rounded in a very exaggerated way. When first published, this figure was identified as a turtle although it is completely lacking in the characteristics of that animal, having neither a tail nor a shell. The central figure can more reasonably be interpreted as that of a woman in a typical dancing pose with arms raised diagonally and feet point downwards. Excavations of a multi-period site located in the Euphrates Valley in Syria, Tell Halula, uncovered part of a Pre-Pottery Painted pottery from Samarra. The figures are presented en face, with long flowing hair, bent arms, fingers and broad hips. The long hair and the broad hips could be considered gender characteristics, indicating female figures.

In one of the houses the plaster floor was painted with a dancing scene. The figures are drawn from three different perspectives; thus it is not clear how one should approach this scene as it is clearly lacking the common visual perception of one point of observation. If it is interpreted as an attempt to represent a circle dance on a flat surface, the various components can be understood as an arrangement of human figures moving around a geometric element in the center (Molist 1998: 84). In central Mesopotamia, near the bank of the Tigris, excavators at the well-known site of Samarra and at the lesser known Choga Mami have found painted dancing figures in several styles. At Samarra, shallow bowls were painted with four, five or six identical large standing human figures in their interiors. The excavator of this site emphasized the long neck and the absence of a clear head and designated these figures "demons" (Herzfeld 1941: 29-42). However, there are no other features suggesting that these figures are supernatural. The flowing hair and bent arms rather indicate movement, and the direction of the hair to the left of the heads indicates that the figures are moving counter-clockwise. One item from Choga Mami with dancing figures painted in the naturalistic style had been reported (Oates 1969: 131). This is a sherd with a row of four figures, both males and females, dancing together. At Tell Halaf, in the Khabur Valley of northeastern Syria, a number of painted pottery vessels depicting dancing figures were found. These included a painted sherd in a naturalistic style and other painted items in a linear style. The latter style includes very schematic human figures, presented en face in a horizontal row, holding hands. Figures with a similar costume have been reported from other Halafian sites and in the famous hunting scenes from Qatal H6yiik. On classical Halafian objects, each figure is represented by a triangular head, one to three vertical lines for the torso and legs, and two diagonal lines for the arms. In some items the triangular heads were not portrayed at all (Oppenheim 1943: pl. XC). Tell Sabi Abyad in the Balikh Valley of northern Syria evidences a large quantity of pottery depicting human figures from an early Halafian phase (Akkermans 1989: 210). The Wadi Rabah culture, found in both Jordan and Israel, is generally considered contemporaneous with the Halafian culture of Mesopotamia. At the Wadi Rabah site of 'Ein el-Jarba in the Jezreel Valley of northern Israel, a complete holemouth jar associated with a grave shows large identical human figures on both sides of the upper part of the jar. The dynamic body position of the figures indicates dancing activity, and the positions of the two figures on the vessel create a circle-the elemental dance formation shown on early pottery (Kaplan 1969: 2-33). Dancers from Prehistoric Iran and Pakistan Some of the first examples of painted pottery with dancing figures known in the Near East, dating to the second half of the sixth millennium BCE, were excavated from Khazineh on the Deh Luran Plain of western Iran and the nearby site of Tepe Musiyan (Hole et al. 1969; Gautier and Lampre 1905). A large assemblage of items decorated in a fashion that has been designated as the "Khazineh Painted Style" were discovered at these sites (Garfinkel 2000: 58). The basic unit in this style is a human figure represented by a triangular torso and bent arms. This unit can be multiplied in two different dimensions. Up to six such units can be placed together horizontally. When more than one figure appears, only the arms of the outer ones are portrayed. This gives the impression that the figures are standing shoulder to shoulder, a position more clearly depicted on some items drawn in the naturalistic style. The basic unit can also be multiplied vertically, one on top of the other. Some scholars have interpreted this situation literally, as "a motif which shows stylized human dancers standing on each others' shoulders" (Hole et al. 1969: 157). However, the examples in which four, five or six such units appear one on top of the other clearly indicate that this interpretation is an unlikely one. Rather it appears that this is a highly stylized representation of figures standing in a row portrayed from a "bird's eye" perspective. One of several painted sherds depicting human figures, discovered at Djaffarabad located on the Susiana plain in Khuzistan, Western Iran, is outstanding for its preservation and artistic quality (Dollfus 1971: fig. 9). Dated to the second half of the sixth millennium BCE, this painted scene is on a deep bowl and is an exceptional representation of dynamic movement. Similar but less spectacular finds from Tepe Sialk, located in the central Iranian Plateau, are seven painted sherds with dancing figures from Layer III, dated to the mid-fifth millennium BCE. All the items are painted rim fragments illustrating tall dancing human figures in a naturalistic style (Ghirshman 1938: pl. LXXV). In most cases they depict a row of broad-hipped figures holding hands and represented in profile. Chigha Sabz in Luristan, western Iran has yielded two examples of dancing figures in the naturalistic style from the middle of the Chalcolithic period (late-sixth millennium BCE). One of them, a relatively well-preserved fragment of a small cup has a scene drawn near its base and not, as usual, near the rim. Tchechme Ali Rayy, on the central Iranian Plateau, near Teheran, from the mid- fifth millennium BCE, evidences one sherd with dancing figures, which was uncovered when the site was briefly examined in the 1920s. Tall-i Jari A, a fifth-millennium BCE site near Persepolis in Fars, Iran, produced several artifacts with dancing motifs, including an unusual scene on a tall fenestrated pedestal bowl that was discovered in a grave (Vanden Berghe 1952: pls. XLIX-L). The dance movement is clearly indicated by the bent stance of the figures. The state of preservation and the quality of the painting make this item the best example of a dancing scene from the proto-historic Near East. Mehrgarh, located in Baluchistan, which today is Western Pakistan, is the eastern-most example in this survey.

The dancers do not appear to be arranged in circular fashion around the rim. Thus, it is possible that another form of dance-a line dance-is shown in this example. The combination of horizontal and vertical dimensions may indicate an arrangement of couples dancing and even of groups of three individuals dancing in a row. This bowl is painted near the rim with a row of three human figures presented en face. The figures are holding hands and their legs are bent and are bordered by a frame of parallel lines at the sides and above them. This could represent an architectural element in front of which the dancing is being performed. After Dollfus (1971: fig. 9: 71). Examples of painted pottery from Tepe Sialk.

The Dancers of Prehistoric Southern Europe The early agricultural communities of southeast Europe in the sixth, fifth and fourth millennia BCE produced large quantities of art and cult objects, including figurines, statues, anthropomorphic and zoomorphic jars, architectural models and decorated pottery vessels. Dancing figures are a common motif on decorated pottery vessels and have been reported from quite a number of sites. From a technical point of view, most of the items from southeast Europe were decorated with plastic applications. Only a few items were incised and still fewer were painted.

In addition, the differences between the figures can be understood as gender-related: a female with a prominent rounded pelvis and a male with a relatively narrow torso. These figures may represent a couple's dance because of the related assemblage of six male and six female figurines, which were also in postures that can only be interpreted as dancing. Another big jar with both a male and a female has been reported from Painted pottery from Tchechme Ali. A row of five identical tall human figures, three almost complete and two partially complete, is depicted on the preserved part.

Dancing figures are known from sites in the Nile Valley as well as sites in the Eastern Egyptian Desert. All of them are located in Upper Egypt. In addition numerous vessels of unknown origin are spread in museums all over the world. Most of the Egyptian depictions are on pottery vessels, decorated by paint, applied plastic relief or incisions. Another group of dancing scenes is known from rock carving. In addition there is one example of dancing for each of the following: a linen shroud, a clay model and a wall painting. From the Badarian phase of Egyptian prehistory come the earliest known examples of Predynastic Egyptian dancers. In the fifth millennium BCE, these figures appear on pottery vessels in applied plastic or incised decoration. This is much later than the earliest dancing scenes from the Near East or southeast Europe. Nevertheless, as in these regions, the earliest depictions were not painted. A typical body gesture was formulated for the expression of dancing: the arms are lifted upwards with incurving hands in a most non-utilitarian pose. This gesture is typical of ritual depictions in Predynastic Egypt, and is found on many clay female figurines (Needler 1984: 29; Crowfoot Payne 1993: fig. 7). Some have suggested that this positioning of the arms imitates bovine horns and that the female figure represents the goddess Hathor. The Naqada I phase, dated to the early fourth millennium BCE, is stylistically characterized by the painted pottery vessels in the white cross-lined style. One example of this style is an unusual pot from Umm el Qaab, one of the Predynastic Naqada cemeteries in the vicinity of Abydos. Either it represents two age groups, or the larger figures are more important and were thus depicted as bigger, while the other figures are less important, and thus represented as smaller. More than likely, both explanations are correct. Notably, the tall, elaborately dressed figures are females, while the small, naked images are male. Does the scene therefore involve adult women and young boys? Towards the mid-fourth millennium BCE, during the Naqada II phase, the dancing motif reached its peak in Predynastic art. A relatively large number of elaborate painted vessels as well as incised rock-drawings in the Eastern Egyptian Desert is known. Dancing is now associated with either Nilotic landscape (boats and aquatic fauna) or less frequently with a desert environment. By the late Naqada period, in the second half of the fourth millennium BCE, the dancing scenes lost their importance and became a rare subject in Egyptian iconography. Dancing Figures: Symbols in Action It should be remembered that we have not found objective "photographs" of dancing activity, but rather drawings that, in addition to the dance activity itself, reflect an artistic perception. Two factors appear to me to be central here, since they are characteristic of most dance scenes from western Pakistan to Greece and from the northern Balkans to Egypt for about five thousand years. In each scene, the images are identical to each other. Differences occur only when men and women dance together. The absolute similarity between all the dancers in dress and body movement stresses the unity and equality of all members of the community. No single image is emphasized in relation to the others. This perception is markedly expressed in the linear style of painting, in which the isolated images are so schematic that the major emphasis is the circle itself. On the one hand, this approach is completely different from the perception that appears in the art of the historical periods, in which the important image, e.g., a king or priest, is depicted as larger than the images around it. On the other hand, it is also completely different from the artistic perception of the rock paintings of the Bushmen of South Africa (an egalitarian society of hunters and gatherers), in which large and small images appear next to each other, without maintaining a uniform direction of movement or identical body poses. Therefore, the consistent presentation of images as uniform and equal in the art of the ancient village societies is an exceptional phenomenon and stands out in its uniqueness. From a cognitive aspect and on an ideological plane, our dancing scenes express equality and integration between the members of a community. On a practical plane, during this period there are revolutionary changes in social organization where human societies become increasingly stratified. Disparities between people deepen over the period, until the formal crystallization of monarchy, nobility, priesthood, civil service, army and police is completed. In the egalitarian Bushman society, it is unnecessary to stress the relative equality between people, since this is a natural situation. Similarly, with the establishment of centralized kingdoms in the ancient Near East, social stratification was already set in rigid patterns and backed up by power and the physical force represented by the army and police. Here, there is a clear contrast between the actual situation and the ideology reflected in artistic artifacts. Dancing scenes are used as a means of concealing and camouflaging the increasing social stratification. There is a clear preference for drawing dancing images on circular objects such as pottery vessels and cylinder seals. The inhabitants of ancient villages perceived dancing in a circle as the most outstanding symbol of ritual. From a cognitive aspect, the essence of the process and the ritualistic experience is a circle of dancers. This is supported by iconographic and linguistic analyses. In ancient agricultural societies, dance was invested with special importance on a number of parallel levels, and this was the secret of its success. On an individual level, it enabled self- expression and active participation in ritual. It enabled entry into trance states, which are the core of religious-mystical activity, and the creation of a relationship with divine powers. It was utilized as a method of creating social solidarity. Religious ceremonies were also a means of coordinating agricultural activities. The need for timely plowing, sowing and harvesting 94 NEAR EASTERN ARCHAEOLOGY 66:3 (2003)</page><page sequence="12">to prevent the agricultural community from facing starvation and death was a central existential requisite and consequently dance was a dominant element of human society for thousands of years. In periods before schools and writing, community rituals, symbolized by dance, were the basic mechanisms for conveying education and knowledge to the adult members of the community and from one generation to the next. The long- term popularity of the dance as a dominant artistic motif, together with its broad geographical dispersion (from west Pakistan to the Danube basin), clearly suggest that it is one of the most powerful symbols known to early human societies.
