Reviewed by Edith Wyschogrod When skepticism and enlighten ment run counter to the spirit of Torah observance their incursion upon a cohesive practice-centered Judaism is met with vigorous coun terattack. A deepening attachment to the Torah as a means of drawing closer to the Divine source of life is evoked as the only appropriate response to the assault upon Jewish religiosity. Thus it was in the pale of settlement when Judaism, tainted by Haskalah culture, provoked the pious into bitter reaction against various manifestations of secular non-belief, or earlier still, when ra tional speculation as embodied in Graeco-Islamic philosophy was seen by some as the basis for a mass flight from Jewish faith. In a series of monographs on representative thinkers of religious anti-rationalism as it took shape in Italy from the thirteenth to the sev enteenth centuries, Isaac E. Barzil ay presens a continuous history of the intellectual ferment that follow ed in the wake of Maimonidean rationalism. Between Reason and Faith also meticulously documents the historical context in which this speculation took place. Among the more important figures discussed are Hillel Ben Shmuel Ben El'azer of Verona, one of a group of "en lightenment" thinkers of the thir teenth and fourteenth centuries, whose admiration for Maimonides was nevertheless colored by some negative criticism of Maimonides' view of prophecy; Joseph Ya'aves, a fifteenth century anti-rationalist to whom an anthropomorphic con ception of the Deity appeared theo logically more appropriate than that of "self-styled wise intellectuals," to use his terms, and Judah Mos cato, a true Renaissance universal man whose neo-Platonism led him to assume that human beatitude consisted in contemplation of the Divine and who was one of the great musicologists of his time. 138</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews Essays on Joseph Ibn Yahya, Azar iah Figo and Judah del Bene are also included. Perhaps the key essay in this volume is one on the Abravanel. It discusses among other matters the locus classicus of this conflict between rationalist and anti-ration alist thought, the Commentary of Isaac Abravanel on Maimonides's Guide. We see at once that both thinkers share a belief in the Scrip tural doctrine of creation as over and against the view of the Islamic Aristotelians that matter is eternal. Where then is the difference? Why is Maimonides a rationalist and Abravanel an opponent of rational ism? While he praises his predeces sor's refutation of the Aristotelian position as a "protective wall," the Abravanel considers Maimonides's replies weak and unconvincing. In deed the chain of reasoning which leads to the opposite conclusion, namely that matter is eternal and that the creado ex nihilo is impos sible, presents a more formidable case. Abravanel is forced to con clude: "In view of the strength of the arguments on behalf of etern ity, and the weakness of the argu ments in support of creation, I have reconsidered my way and re turned to the path of the holy sages of the past ... I have chosen the way of faith; speculations I hate, and theorizing about things incon ceivable by sense, I consider non sensical and misleading." Both thinkers are interested in conferring the strongest possible certainty upon the conclusion that God created the world out of noth ing. What the Abravanel doubts is that such certainty can be estab lished by demonstrative reason, for it is precisely demonstrative reason which is fallible. If trusted too far, reason which is a mere accessory of faith might rebel against the truths of faith itself. The contrast between so-called rationalist and anti-rationalist thought emerges most clearly in the field of Biblical exegesis. The book of Ezekiel have provided the sub ject for extensive commentary by both Maimonides and Isaac Abrav anel. The Maimonidean reading in sists upon translating the Biblical imagery into Aristotelian terms: the "wheels" of the chariot signify prime matter and the four elements, the "living creatures" refer to the heavenly bodies, the hashmal are the detached intelligences. While Abravanel points to some fail ures in terms of the literal cor respondence of the philosophical to the Biblical entities, his criticism reverts to a more basic issue, that of the existential plight of the Jew ish people at the time of the de struction of the Temple. Rejecting metaphysical and astronomical ex planation, he argues that if it were the Divine intention to communi cate speculative truths, these truths would have been revealed in a form appropriate to their content. As for Ezekiel, "... his prophe cies are concerned with the sins of Israel, the destruction of Jerusa lem, or the exile of the people and their future restoration. What possible interest could Ezekiel have had in spheres, elements, and in telligences, to place them at the beginning of his prophecies? And what bearing do they have alto gether on the problem of the de 139</page><page sequence="3">TRADITION: A Journal of Orthodox Thought struction and the exile?" Finally the approach of Isaac Abravanel differs from that of Mai monides in the realm of ethical teaching. Why do Jews perform the mitzvot? According to Maimon ides one obeys the commandments not for the sake of reward or pun ishment but "for their own sake since one should love truth for the sake of truth." Is this stand a plea for the autonomy of reason as, let us say, Kant understands it? Does he hope to establish, to bor row a phrase from Kant once again, "religion in the light of rea son alone?" Does the virtue of the Divine commandment lie in its being commanded or in its inner reasonableness? Abravanel senses a painful ambiguity in the Guide. His own position is quite undialectical: we owe allegiance only to the he teronomous law which the com mandment expresses. He contends that Maimonides's appeal to the Aristotelian mean as a standard of human action leaves man at the mercy of a rationality which, at best, serves divinely ordained ends, at worst leads man seriously astray. "The path of the Torah which God has set for his people is the only right one . .." Isaac Barzilay is a formidable scholar. He is both judicious and subtle in his presentation of the rationalist and anti-rationalist think ers with whom he deals, engaging them in a kind of running dia logue. The anti-rationalists are not vague obscurantists. More often than not they are clear and clever exponents of the way of faith. But if this controversy is to engage us beyond the level of mere historical 140 curiosity we must try to understand it in terms developed by contempo rary philosophy and theology. The designations "rationalist" and "anti rationalist," which we have used up to now to distinguish those who have one standard of truth to which both Judaism and secular learning can be accommodated from those who wish to separate the realm of faith from that of philosophical speculation, must be re-examined in the light of what we mean by Reason. Let us turn for a moment to a distinction drawn by a modern thinker, Paul Tillich, between "on tological" (profound) reason and "technical" (shallow) reason. The former enables the mind to seize and transfigure reality. It is strong ly charged with an Eros for truth which hurtles consciousness for ward in its quest for reality. Tech nical reason is mere "reasoning"; it is ontological reason truncated and bereft of its aesthetic and emo tive elements. Obviously all thought must use technical reason or it would degenerate into incoherence. But, can the existence of God, for example, ever be adduced by tech nical reason alone? When shallow reason replaces profound reason it tends to reason away the most significant aspects of human exist ence. In the light of these modern dis tinctions what can we say of Mai monides's rationalism? Does his view of prophetic vision reason away the life world of the prophet? Or does his view that the perfect form moves all things, that we love truth for the sake of truth, confer a power upon his use of reason that elevates it to an ontological</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews level? Does the Abravanel's concern for the sin of Israel and his re jection of Islamic Aristotelianism as a means for the interpretation of holy truth represent a deep use of reason? Or does he merely re treat from asking basic questions? Does Maimonides's Guide represent a form of hybris in the religious arena like that of modern positiv ism in the secular? Barzilay as a careful and conscientious scholar quite rightly deals only with inter nal questions, questions raised and answered in the texts themselves. In this sense his book is first-rate and indispensible to anyone inter ested in the history of Jewish phi losophy. However, it merits close reading not only for its intrinsic historical interest but also for the questions it provokes in the broad er context of Jewish thought.</page></plain_text>
