<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE USE OF BIBLICAL IMAGERY TO INTERPRET THE HOLOCAUST ZIVA AMISHAI-MAISELS One of the problems artists encountered in dealing with the Holo caust was how to express their reactions to it without actually depict ing it. For this reason, from 1933 on, they turned to Biblical image ry, evolving an iconography that closely paralleled developments in the way the struggle with Nazism was perceived. At first it was seen sim plistically as a conflict between good and evil, and three archetypes were developed: the hero, the evil enemy, and the victim. After the war, two new archetypes dealing with mourning and resurrection were added. To make the Biblical themes fit the Holocaust context, their iconography was often changed in far-reaching ways. In the following account, the main lines of this development will be traced.* The major Jewish hero to be treated in this context was David, and Lipchitz1 David and Goliath of 1933 was, in fact, a reaction to Hit 1er's rise to power. Lipchitz chose this theme to disprove Nazi the ories on the weakness of the Jewish character as opposed to the mascu line superiority of the Aryans: not only does the Nazi Goliath fall, but he is killed by a supposedly weak Jewish boy. Yet the iconography here is unusual: crying out in despair, Goliath clutches at the rope around his neck on which David pulls back sharply, strangling the giant. This is not the story told in the Bible, where David fells Go liath with his slingshot and cuts his head off with the Philistine's sword (I Samuel 27: 49-51). Lipchitz explained that he feared that a literal interpretion might be considered parochial; by changing the ac tion, he wished to broaden the implications of the theme. He ex plained this duality in 1934: "I reacted with my Jewish skin for my dispersed and persecuted blood-brothers. But the monster that we kill is not only anti-semitism. It is also everything that prevents man from advancing."2 However, to make his meaning clear, he carved a swastika on Goliath's chest. On another level, his response stemmed from his belief in sympathetic magic: "I was angry and afraid, and al so hopeful that tomorrow Hitler would be finished. That is why I made my Goliath this way. It was my prayer.At the moment Hitler as sumed control, Lipchitz went to work praying for his downfall by actu ally depicting it, hoping that he could influence the course of history and strangle Nazism even as David strangled Goliath. Lipchitz' attempt to relate this theme to current events is also 7ז</page><page sequence="2">Ziva Amishai-Maisels found in Mané-Katz' David and Goliath of 1944-45. His David wears phylacteries and is unarmed; he is an emaciated Jew, possibly a camp survivor, who has triumphed over Goliath by force of faith alone.י Adler's King David of 1945 who sings a song of victory on his lyre gives the subject a different twist. This work celebrates the end of the war, yet David looks unhappy, his arras tense, his eyes staring at the spectator in shock and his lips barely open in song. Although this ambiguous combination is inherent in David the Psalmist, whose psalms are recited both on festive occasions and in memory of the dead, here Adler gives it a Holocaust meaning: David is triumphant, but deeply conscious of the tragedy that has taken place.^ Although the image of a Biblical hero presupposes the defeat of a Biblical villain, figures like Goliath did not fill the need for an ar chetypal evil character symbolic of Fascism and relevant to events. For this role, Grosz proposed Cain, the first murderer. In Thus Cain Killed Abel of 1936, Cain is a Nazi guard sitting exhausted beside the dead Abel, whose striped pants identify him as an inmate. The barbed wire, the fortress-like prison and the German guard in the background reinforce this meaning.*י In 1944 , Grosz reworked this theme: Cain is now the defeated Hitler sitting in front of a destroyed Germany, at tacked by the Lilliputian corpses of his victims.^ Although Grosz tried to evoke hatred for Cain, the image works against him: the spec tator tends to sympathize with the unhappy Cain rather than with the repulsive skeletons who attack him. But the theme created a more basic problem of which Grosz—as a German—was not aware. The relationship of brotherhood between oppressor and oppressed was not palatable to non-Germans dealing with the Holocaust. They therefore evoked the theme verbally, leaving its meaning ambiguous. Thus Gropper uses the Biblical accusation Your Brother's Blood Cries Out as the title for his 1943 series on the Warsaw ghetto. But whom is he addressing, the Ger man Cain or the American "brother" who must avenge the victims' death? To avoid this problem, artists sought other Biblical prototypes to represent evil. Rattner suggested that the camp full of corpses is So dom and Gomorrah. In his Six Million series of 1962-64, he depicted semi-abstract corpses whose meaning was given by the words "six mil lion", written repeatedly across the surface of the work. This concep tual method of identifying the subject and the figures themselves also appeared in contemporary works entitled Sodom or Gomorrah, along with flames, swastikas and inscriptions of the names of the camps. Yet the title of these works remained Sodom or Gomorrah, indicating symbolical ly the place of evil where such a horror could take place.® In these works, the evil-doer is still human. Yet the Holocaust seemed the result of a thoroughly monstrous evil, and the gas chambers and crematoriums themselves suggested an obvious archetype: Moloch, the Ammonite god to whom children were sacrificed by being placed on the idol's arms, rolled into the furnace in his belly, and cremated alive. This was one of the rare Biblical themes used by the inmates. In 1945, 18</page><page sequence="3">The Use of Biblical Imagery to Interpret the Holocaust Wiesenthal—just released from Mauthausen—created works which use the imagery of Moloch, although not the term itself. In Transport, inmates packed in box-cars go to their death in the crematoriums. Rather than entering the ovens, they disappear literally into the mouth of Death, who wears a gestapo hat and reaches forward covetously to hurry them along. The same idea appears in The Crematorium, where the inmates are being marched into a flaming oven located in the belly of Heinrich Himmler, chief of the Gestapo, who extends his grasping hands and ta loirlike nails towards his victims.^ Non-inmates also used this imagery. In his Buchenwald series of 1945, Paris entitled his depiction of the gas chambers The Moloch Eats Every Day. As opposed to Wiesenthal, Paris does not depict Moloch, but only the interior of the gas chamber itself. However, in Thoughts about a Sculpture of 1959-60, he expressed his ideas more symbolically. He joined Moloch to Malach Hamoves, the angel of death, and the more positive symbol of Judaism, Malach, an angel whose head is composed of the Ten Commandments. Moloch's body is made up of a monstrous face and his arms push a helpless child into his maw in a way that recalls Wei senthal's version of the theme. Through the Jewish imagery and that of Moloch, Paris returns here to his point of departure — Buchenwald. This is reinforced in the sculptured Walls he developed from these drawings in 1960-62. Although the forms are abstracted, the Walls con tain shapes suggesting furnaces out of which flow bodily remains.11* Lipton's versions of the theme also developed in 1945 at a time when he began to use mythic archetypes to symbolize the modern world. Using "sharp, jutting discontinuous forms and masses" which he felt had "a demonic character," he chose Moloch as a symbol of the Holocaust. His Moloch is a bestial killer with hollow eyes, sprearing his victim with his predatory beak before devouring him in his gaping mouth with its razor-sharp teeth. He developed this image further in 1946: Moloch no. 2 resembles a bird of prey greedily devouring its victim, and Mo loch no. 3 is an insatiable monster with huge tusks, sharp teeth and an enormous gullet which gapes open to reveal a bottomless pit.11 Lipton emphasized the meaning of this image when he developed it into Panorama of Judea of 1947, later called Exodus: "The Exodus pieces were part of a tragic mood of history and reality that has always concerned me. The pyramids, the fiery furnace used in these works were related to the horns and primordial forms used in the Molochs. It is possible that Israeli history and emergence entered... The underlying mood is tragedy...a kind of wailing wall to human suffering."12 Executed at a time when there was no solution for the survivors, Lipton's Pano rama of Judea is one of Jewish suffering from the pyramids to the Holo caust furnaces. Only after 1948 could he give it the more optimistic title Exodus. To understand the development of symbols for the "evil enemy", one must realize that artists not only sought a hate-figure, but someone to blame. Grosz and Rattner used Cain and Sodom to put the blame on man 19</page><page sequence="4">Ziva Amishai-Maisels himself, and many artists claimed that evil was a component of man's character. But in preferring Moloch, a non-human idol invented by man, most artists blamed an uncontrolled force of evil rampant in the world. Yet there was another answer to the question of guilt: one could blame God Himself! This answer was profferred not by depicting God as a kil 1er, but through the iconographical development of the two major Bibli cal archetypes for the Holocaust victim—Job and Isaac. As archetypes, the stories of Job and the sacrifice of Isaac have much in common. In each case, a devout, innocent man is tested by God, and after suffering the threatened or actual extinction of his family, affirms his faith and is rewarded: Isaac is spared and Job prospers and fathers a new family. Yet there are major differences between the sto ries which should supply important nuances within a Holocaust context. Job is not asked to sacrifice his family; they are suddenly and sense lessly killed, and he himself suffers physically. Yet Job not only re fuses to "curse God and die" (Job 2: 9), but will not accept the blame for what has befallen him. On the contrary, he demands justice of God, an explanation of the evil that has overtaken him in his innocence. This protest is a major part of the story, even though the only answer Job gets is that God's ways are inscrutable. Abraham, on the other hand, is asked to make the sacrifice, and it is his willingness to kill Isaac, and Isaac's willingness to be killed that is rewarded. Thus while Job clings to life and confronts God, Abraham humbly accepts the divine decree. We should therefore expect them to symbolize two dis tinct types of Holocaust victims: Job, the argumentative inmate or sur vivor, as opposed to Isaac, the willing martyr. This prognosis is only partially fulfilled by the art-works. Job seemed to many artists to be the perfect paradigm of the inno cent Holocaust victim who has no control over the evils that befall him, from the loss of his family to his physical suffering from starva tion, overwork and disease. This aptness led the inmates of the Warsaw ghetto to portray Job's suffering in a large mural.13 At the same time, ca. 1941, Bergner depicted Job crouching on the ground in a foet al position, his tzitzith barely covering his skeletal chest. Closed in upon himself, he looks upwards, his eyes sad and blank, his mouth shut. Silently, he listens to God's answer, hopelessly accepting his own nothingness.1^ Artists who had tasted the Holocaust reacted more strongly. In 1941-42, Mestrovic, jailed by the gestapo in Yugoslavia, spent his time in prison drawing Job, executing the motif in sculpture in 1945. Naked and emaciated, his Job, whose hooked nose suggests his Jewish ness, sits legs akimbo on his dung heap, hunched over, screaming his unavailing protest at God. Like the artist in his cell, he cries: "Be hold I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard" (Job 19: 7). In a contem porary painting, an equally ungainly suffering Job confronts his three comforters: they calmly preach God's justice to him, but he clutches his head in bewilderment, unable to accept their words. Here, too, 20</page><page sequence="5">The Use of Biblical Imagery to Interpret the Holocaust Mestrovic drew on his prison experience, as he told of "listening to the psychotic yelling, talking, arguing of fanatics in the halls" out side his cell. Yet these fanatics are treated calmly here: they speak reasonably, while Job reacts "psychotically," unwilling to disbelieve his own sense of justice.^ The pose used here—head thrown back and mouth crying out in an guish against God—became a standard detail in Holocaust iconography. Yet even this clearcut gesture of protest assumed other meanings as the pain of the Holocaust receded. Thus Rapoport's Job of 1967 is neither angry nor resigned—he is rapt in prayer. His eyes closed, his mouth barely open, he clutches his arms—one of which bears a camp number—in entreaty. The artist explained that he portrayed Job "ready to go to his death for Kiddush Hashem...with the eternal prayer of the Jewish people attesting to their faith in the one God, ,Shma Yisrael.'" Here Job, the survivor who demands justice of God, has become a traditional willing martyr. Rapoport based himself on the end of the story, where Job is restored to wealth and family: "I think...that the rebirth of Israel and of the Jewish people are an echo of the book of Job. Our people kept faith. We did not change our beliefs, our ethics, and we came out stronger from our ordeals." Here again, as in the change in title of Lipton's Exodus, the establishment of the State of Israel transformed Holocaust iconography.^ The two basic ideas conveyed by Job—the innocent victim accepting his fate and the protest against God—are also expressed in art through the Sacrifice of Isaac. Here, however, the artist had many problems to resolve because the usual visual iconography conflicted with the liter ary development of the theme. Although official Judaism held that Ab raham's and Isaac's willingness to perform the sacrifice is accepted by God as though it had been performed, and is remembered by Him when the Jews are being persecuted, there were Jewish traditions in the Midrash and throughout the Middle Ages which referred to Isaac as having actu ally been sacrificed on the altar. In this guise, the story penetrated into prayers and fostered comparisons between martyred Jews and the slaughtered Isaac. ^ It was the latter who became one of the major literary symbols of Jewish martyrdom in the Holocaust. But the tradi tional visual portrayal of the Sacrifice is of the dramatic moment of reprieve: an angel appears to stop Abraham from killing Isaac. In this guise the theme could be used, as had David and Goliath, only as a prayer. Thus when Abraham Walt wrote in 1934 that the Sacrifice of Isaac happens in every generation, and that he feels the sword at his own throat and awaits the voice of the angel which will save him, Cha gall illustrated the poem with the traditional iconography: the angel arrives to save Isaac and, symbolically, all the modern martyrs threat ened by Fascism.^ In 1947 , Ardon changed this iconography to conform to a more real istic view of events. In Sarah, Isaac's pale bloodless body lies dead on the altar, while Abraham sits helpless in the background, a tiny 21</page><page sequence="6">Ziva Amishai-Maisels figure of despair, his sleeves bloody from the sacrifice. Sarah domi nates the foreground, mourning her dead son. Ardon explained that he based himself on a legend that Satan brought Sarah to witness the sac rifice, thus causing her death.19 This is borne out in the paint ing: Sarah is as pale as her son and her bright red dress underlines the pallor of both figures. Here Ardon comes close to the Hebrew poet ry that was being written at this time. He stressed Isaac's death, Ab raham's helplessness, and the perversity of God against which Sarah cries out horrified, blaming Him for the murder of her son! Another attempt to adapt this theme to the Holocaust was made by a survivor, Frederick Terna. Searching in 1973 for a way to symbolize his experiences, he made several traditional sketches of the theme which did not satisfy him. As he worked, he found that the angel's gesture changed: rather than arresting Abraham's motion, the angel guides the knife towards Isaac, causing the boy to raise his arm in protest. By having the angel look and point towards heaven, Terna shows that he is acting under divine guidance: God has sent him not to save Isaac, but to kill him! As he realized the implications of this change, Terna concentrated on Abraham who, understanding that Isaac will not be spared, turns his knife against the angel, stabbing it and —through it—God. The smouldering revolt Terna had harbored all these years against God's cruelty finally burst forth, and he used Abraham to express his own anger: to save Isaac, Abraham will kill the God who dared to order his death! By 1980, however, Terna felt that he had gone too far: he now has Abraham deflect the knife towards himself, preferring suicide to the murder of his son or of his God.20 An even more pessimistic view was taken by another survivor, Be zem, who adapted the story to a new Israeli reality. In 1975, a Pales tinian bomb exploded in Jerusalem, killing Bezem's eldest son, Yitzhak. The bereaved father immediately painted a series on the Sacrifice of Isaac in which neither Abraham nor Isaac appear. Instead, he placed on the altar objects he had used to represent Holocaust survivors, setting them beside a tallith to show that the victim is killed because he is Jewish. In Sacrifices , a black anthropomorphic shape lies on the altar recalling the dead Isaac. On it, Bezem placed himself and his wife in a boat, suggesting that although he had survived the first sacrifice— the Holocaust—now he is sacrificed again. Surviving one horror, Bezem saw his future destroyed through the murder of his son.21 In depictions of Job and the Sacrifice of Isaac, one of the most compelling motifs was the cry of anguish directed at God, signifying mourning and the assigning of blame in Ardon's Sarah, and anger and re volt in Mestrovic's Job. These feelings were also expressed in other Biblical themes. Mourning was especially popular after the war, and was conveyed through the allegorical figure of Rachel mourning her "children", the people of Israel. Yet Rachel, who appears only to be promised that her children will be redeemed (Jeremiah 31: 14-lb), never attained the anguish of Ardon's Sarah, a specific woman mourning her 22</page><page sequence="7">The Use of Biblical Imagery to Interpret the Holocaust only son. This low-keyed approach to Rachel is used in Shahn's And mine Eyes a Fountain of Tears of 1965, where the silent mourning woman can be explained in a number of ways as Shahn substituted another quo tation from Jeremiah for the text on Rachel: "0 that my head were wa ters and mine eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people" (Jeremiah 8: 23). Thus the woman can be interpreted as the mourner whose blank eyes fill with wa ter, or the "daughter of my people" whose dead are being mourned.22 Whereas Rachel passively accepts the death of her children, anger against God is expressed by the prophet who cries out in protest or as sûmes a protest of silence. This imagery is clearest in Steinhardt's works from the mid-thirties on, especially in his highly personal view of Jonah. In a 1939 sketch and a 1945 painting, Jonah—like Job—turns his head up, his mouth open, as he points an accusing finger at God. This unorthodox image expressed only one aspect of Steinhardt's con flict with God; the other is found in his rendering of Jonah's refusal to preach: he hides from God, holding his ears and covering his eyes. In 1946, when Steinhardt realized the full enormity of the Holocaust, his anger led him to stress the breaking off of communication with God in a series of woodcuts. The strongest of these, Outcry, combines the two sides of his Jonah symbolism. The erstwhile "seer" throws his head back, covering his eyes, not just because he cannot bear what he sees, but to break his "sight", his contact with God, while he screams out his revolt against Him. This breach with God is further developed in Saul, who covers one eye in mourning and gazes blankly before him. Here Steinhardt suggests that like the ill-fated king, the Jews have been abandoned by God.23 On the other hand, after the establishment of Israel, many art ists expressed their hopes for the future through themes of Resurrec tion. Thus Steinhardt painted people coming out of their graves in his 1950 Resurrection, and in the same year, Rattner began working in that direction in his Figure in F lames. 2^ Here a young man stands re laxed amidst the flames, his body covered with dots which recall Job's sores. He is one of the three Hebrews in the fiery furnace (Daniel 3), as is suggested by the two heads on either side of him, and by the fact that he is not consumed by the flames. Rattner, who had been involved with fire imagery in a Holocaust context since the late 1930's, gives it a more positive meaning here: at least one of the three Hebrews will emerge alive. This painting prepared the way for Rattner's versions of Ezekiel's vision from 1953 on, in which the Holocaust flames merge with the Valley of Dry Bones. In his 1963 version of the theme, he related it to the Holocaust by using corpses and inscriptions similar to those in the Six Million series. The main differences are the figure of Eze kiel on the left, raising his arm and head in prayer, and the shape re calling both .yearning hands and a menorah on the right. By entitling his variations on the Six Million, Gomorrah and The Valley of the Dry Bones , he represented two opposite poles of the Holocaust—the place of evil as opposed to the place of Resurrection. In Up from the Wilder 23</page><page sequence="8">Ziva Amishai-Maisels ness of 1963, he further pin-pointed his meaning: skeletally thin fig ures reach out of the flames towards salvation. This idea was repeated in Resurrection: They will Awake and Sing of 1969 , where skeletons rise from the flames of the Holocaust towards the sun, led by Ezekiel and the trumpeting angels. Here the visual image of evil—burning people— becomes one of Resurrection.25 In this paper, we have seen how a few artists expressed their ap proach to the Holocaust by means of Biblical imagery. They are merely an example of a much more widespread phenomenon: despite their indivi duality, they show a consensus of opinion with many other artists on which Biblical themes should be used, how they should be changed to conform to events , and what new messages they should convey. 1.
