<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE TENT OF MEETING JULIAN MORGENSTERN HEBREW UNION COLLEGE, CINCINNATI, OHIO SOME YEARS AGO, in a monograph entitled 'Biblical Theoph- anies', I advanced the hypothesis, and supported it with to me seemingly incontrovertible proof, that Ex. 33.12-34.28 and Num. 10.29-32 contain the oldest document of the Hexateuch. Because of its manifest parallelism with the laws and narrative contained in Ex. 20.23-24.8 I have called this the Little Book of the Covenant, and labelled it C2.2 That was merely a first, provisional attempt to separate this ancient writing from its present Jahwistic setting. From the outset it was clear that Ex. 34.1-5 were from J. and altogether out of accord with the more ancient narrative. Likewise, vv. 6-9 have been considerably amplified by the Jahwistic editors who incorporated the ancient writing into the J code. Further- more, vv. 10-26, consisting for the most part of the so-called 'Ten Commandments', have been considerably expanded by hortatory, Deuteronomic additions. What I did not realize at the time was that Ex. 33.12-23, the main narrative portion, con- tains considerable secondary matter, the work of the Jahwistic editors. This secondary, Jahwistic matter is characterized by repeated reference to Jahwe knowing Moses by name, and Moses having found favor in Jahwe's sight, and by Moses daring to seek to induce Jahwe to alter His purposes. This exaltation of Moses is characteristic of the secondary stratum of J.3 Accordingly in Ex. 33, vv. 12b, 13, 15-17 and 19b as well as 34.9 belong to this secondary J source. With these verses I Zeitschrift fiir Assyriologie 25. 139-193; 28. 15-60. 2 The Larger Book of the Covenant, contained in Ex. 20. 23-24. 8, I have labelled C1. Actually, since the Little Book of the Covenant is the older, and the other is clearly dependent upon it in part, it would have been more logical to call the older writing C1 and the younger C2. But since scholars had long before applied the term 'Book of the Covenant' to Ex. 20. 23-24. 8 (although not within these exact limits), I naturally applied the label C1 to this younger writing and C2 to the older. 3Cf. Ex. 32. 11-14, 31 f.; Num. 14. 13-25, and the picture of the veiled Moses with the shining face, upon which no man can gaze, Ex. 34. 29-35. 9 JAOS 38</page><page sequence="2">126 Julian Morgenstern removed, the unity of the story becomes immediately apparent. Time does not permit consideration of all details here. I must therefore refer to my earlier monograph. There I have shown, among other things, that in the remaining verses 013:3 is used in a two-fold sense. When, in 33.14, Jahwe answers Moses' complaint that He had bidden him lead the people away from the mountain without telling whom He would send with him to lead the people further, 'My D'3 shall go, and I shall let thee rest', He means Jiobab ben Reuel, Moses' brother-in-law, appar- ently the priest and mediator between Jahwe and the Kenites, His original worshipers. Here DIJ3 is manifestly a technical term for 'representative', 'priest'. But Moses misunderstands this technical meaning of DIUD, and interprets it literally as Jahwe's face. So he asks naively, 'Let me see Thy face'. But the prompt answer is, 'Thou canst not see My face, for no man can see My face and live'. Nevertheless Jahwe will grant as much of Moses' request as possible. He will place Moses in the cave upon the mountain top,4 and will pass before him and will call out His true name. The obvious implication is that this true name was as yet unknown. He will also cover the mouth of the cave with His hand as He passes, and will then remove His hand, so that Moses may look upon His back, even while His face remains invisible.

Not only has He allowed Moses to see His back and to learn His true name, but He will also make a covenant with Moses and Israel upon the basis of a little code of laws, the so-called 'Ten Com- mandments', which He now reveals. Moses writes these down at Jahwe's bidding upon two tablets of stone, and brings them to the people. The narrative must have told further, just as does the parallel narrative of C1 in Ex. 24.3-8, of the people's acceptance of these laws, and of the solemn ratification of the covenant between Jahwe and the people. It concluded with Moses' request of Hobab ben Reuel, the true 012 of Jahwe, to lead them onward from this mountain. Hobab at first refused, but was ultimately persuaded. So he and his people, the Ken- ites, journeyed on with Israel, and at last they came to the Promised Land (Jud. 1.16; 4.11); and be it remarked in pass- ing, the manifest implication is that they entered the country from the south. This little document is manifestly older than J, and older also than C1. We shall see that it probably antedated Elijah by about a generation. The work is clearly prophetic in character and purpose, the product of an early, prophetic attempt to define the fundamental principles and institutions of the religion of Israel. The dominantly pastoral character of the rites enjoined in the ten laws, even despite the recognition of the three agri- cultural festivals and of the Sabbath, as well as the pointed association of the narrative with the Kenites, and the fact that the writing was incorporated into J, all argue a southern origin for this booklet. Undoubtedly the later, prophetic, Deutero- nomic code and covenant in 621 B. c. were modelled upon this 10 JAOS 38</page><page sequence="4">128 Julian Morgenstern earlier code and covenant story. And just as the Deuteronomic Code and covenant were designed to pave the way for a practical and far-reaching reformation of religious belief and practice, so also, in all likelihood, this older, prophetic record of a religious code and covenant. I infer therefore, that this little booklet constituted the basis of the reforms attributed to Asa (1 Ki. 15.11-15; 2 Chron. 14.1-3; 15). Reading between the lines, it is apparent that there were two parties in the southern kingdom when Asa ascended the throne, the party of foreign culture and religious influence, headed apparently by the queen-mother, and consist- ing, in all likelihood, of the nobles and the wealthy, commercial class, and the prophetic party, seemingly the party of the masses of Jerusalem and of the rural, pastoral population. These sought to purge the state religion, centering in the Temple at Jerusalem, of all seemingly non-Jahwistic elements, particularly, in this instance, of the use of images and idols. The funda- mental principles of this reform, stated in the first two of the ten laws of the code, the only two really negative laws in the code, were NlrK '2b illrV Mb and N' ;o1DO 'Alar at '37r1. Asa cast in his lot with the prophetic party. Not inconceivably, he may have been influenced, as was Josiah, almost three centuries later, by the representation that this law code came from Moses. With his support the reformation suc- ceeded. Both 1 Ki. 15.9-13 and 2 Chron. 14.1-3 and 15.16 tell that the queen-mother was deposed, and that the image which she had set up in the Temple, and all other images, were destroyed. 2 Chron. 15 tells likewise that these reforms were due to prophetic activity and influence, under the leadership of a certain Azariah ben Oded, while v. 12 states explicitly that the entire people entered into a solemn covenant with Jahwe. A specific covenant such as this unquestionably implies a definite basis in an actual code of laws. V. 10 states that this covenant was solemnized in the third month, presumably on the festival of first-fruits, in the fifteenth year of Asa. If this date may be accepted, and just here the account of Chronicles seems fuller than that of Kings and more in accord with all the details of the C2 narrative of the covenant between Jahwe and the people, this would fix the date of the composition and promulgation of</page><page sequence="5">The Tent of Meeting 129 C2 as 899 B. c., and make it, as we have claimed, the oldest document of the Hexateuch. The antiquity of C2 is likewise attested by the primitive nature of its contents, and particularly of its God-conception. Jahwe is represented as having human shape, with face, back, hands, voice and name. Apparently He is of gigantic size, for with His hand He covers the mouth of the cave.5 He dwells upon the mountain. There there is a sacred cave, spoken of at its very first mention as '11YM 1V1i, the cave of the mountain. However, Jahwe does not dwell in this cave, but moves to and fro in the open space before it. The cave itself serves a differ- ent purpose. In it the worshiper who seeks a divine revelation stands. At the entrance to the cave is the meeting-place with Jahwe. The worshiper stands just within the mouth of the cave, and Jahwe passes by just without, and calls out His name and message as He passes. The person of Jahwe is sacrosanct. Upon His face no mortal, not even Moses, may look. The eyes of the worshiper must be covered, and only after Jahwe has passed may the covering be removed and Jahwe's back be seen. That we have not read into this ancient narrative more than is actually implied there, is proved by an analysis of 1 Ki. 19.1-14. Elijah's life is threatened. In distress, and in the saddening conviction that his labors have been fruitless, he seeks out his God in His own dwelling-place, not in the Temple at Jerusalem, but, in accordance with the ancient, pastoral and prophetic conception, on the mountain far out in the desert, where, he clearly believed, his God still dwelt. He spends the night in the cave on the mountain. Here, too, at the very first mention, and without further qualification, this cave is designated by the article, t~rtilU, the cave. Towards morning, presumably, the word comes to him to stand at the entrance of the cave. And there Jahwe passes before him, attended by the whirlwind, the earthquake and the fire. But Jahwe is in none of these. Then Elijah hears a still, small voice, and he hides his face in his mantle. Why? Contrary to popular opinion, we have not to do here with an unanthropomorphic, purely spiritual conception I Similarly Yaqut tells in the Mu'gan (2. 100) of a god in the Eladhra- maut, called Al Galsad, who was a gigantic man (cited from Bent, Southern Arabia, 134); but cf. Wellhausen, Reste2, 53-56.</page><page sequence="6">130 Julian Morgenstern of the Deity, represented only by a still, small voice. If so, why the local setting of the mountain abode of the Deity and the sacred cave? And why must Elijah cover his face before the voice? No, clearly the prophet recognizes this as the voice of Jahwe approaching; and that he might not court death by presuming to gaze upon Jahwe's countenance, he covers his face, while Jahwe passes by in the open space before the cave. And there, at the mouth of the cave, the eagerly sought revelation comes to him. A moment's consideration shows that the backgrounds of the two stories are identically the same. There are the same moun- tain in the wilderness, the dwelling-place of Jahwe, the same well-known, sacred cave on the top of the mountain, in which the expectant worshiper stands with eyes covered, that he might not behold Jahwe's face, the same open space before the cave, in which Jahwe passes by and utters his divine word.6 The Elijah story adds the incident of the whirlwind, the earthquake and the fire, implying thereby that Jahwe controlled these forces of nature. But this expansion may be due to the fact that this incident in Elijah's life, the historicity of which there is no reason to doubt, happened some thirty or more years after C2 was written; and these thirty years, particularly in the northern kingdom, were years of change and expansion of social, economic, and, above all, religious thought and concept, by which not even an Elijah could remain altogether uninfluenced. Furthermore, the incident was not recorded even in its original literary form7 until at least a half century after Elijah's death. This expansion may be due entirely to the literary or theological inclinations of the authors of the present form of the story. At any rate it does not affect the story proper, nor weaken in any way the complete corroboration which it offers, of our interpre- tation of the narrative of C2. Lack of time forbids detailed consideration of the manifold and far-reaching import of C2 for the early religious, economic 8 Jewish tradition, too, has identified the cave of Elijah with that of Moses, and told that this cave was one of the ten things created by God at twilight of the sixth day. Cf. Ginsburg, Legends of the Jews, 1. 83. 7That the original account has been reworked by later hands, is clear from the numerous repetitions in vv. 9b-lla; cf. Benzinger, 106 if., Kittel, 152.</page><page sequence="7">The Tent of Meeting 131 and political history of Israel. That must be reserved for treat- ment elsewhere. In this particular investigation I wish only to emphasize the fact that both C2 and the Elijah story speak of the cave as well-known and requiring no further explanation nor designation other than that furnished by the article, :pO~t, and the definite construct state, fl, 1;:: that, furthermore, this cave is not the dwelling-place of Jahwe, but is merely the place in which the worshiper remains while await- ing a revelation, a characteristic form of incubation; that, fur- thermore, during the act of revelation he stands at the entrance of the cave, while Jahwe passes by just in front of him, in the open space before the mouth of the cave. Ex. 33.7-11, the verses immediately preceding the beginning of the C2 narrative give an account of the tabernacle in the wilderness. Moses used to take the tabernacle, or, more cor- rectly, the 'tent of meeting', and set it up outside the camp and some distance removed. Whoever would commune directly with Jahwe would go out to this tent of meeting. Whenever Moses himself would go thither, all the people would stand at their tent-doors and watch. And when Moses would enter the tent of meeting, the pillar of cloud would descend to the door and speak with Moses. And all the people, seeing the pillar of cloud at the door of the tent of meeting, would prostrate them- selves. And Jahwe would speak to Moses face to face, just as one man speaks to another. Then Moses would return to the camp. But his attendant and apprentice, the lad Joshua, would never leave the tent of meeting. Obviously this account of the procedure with the tent of meet- ing cannot be a part of C2, which follows immediately. That knows nothing of such a tent as the place of revelation, but only of the sacred cave on the top of the mountain in the desert. On this mountain Jahwe dwells, apparently in human shape. Here, however, Jahwe dwells somewhere above, whence He descends, not in human form, however, but in the pillar of cloud. And here Moses speaks to Him face to face, while in C2 he can- not look upon Jahwe's face and live. With unanimity most surprising in view of the scanty evi- dence, Biblical scholars have assigned these verses and all related references to the tent of meeting outside the camp (Num. 11.16</page><page sequence="8">132 Julianr Morgenstern ff.; 12.4) to the Elohistic document. But, as I believe I have shown conclusively in my previously mentioned monograph, this passage must be the work of J. The Elohist tells consist- ently that Israel was led through the desert, not by the Deity Himself, but only by the 07l7'* J n, the angel of God, in whom God's name was (Ex. 23.20 ff.; cf. 32.34; 33.2, 5), that God revealed Himself to Israel in thick darkness (Ex. 20.18-21), and that the people dared not look upon His face lest they die (ib. 19). Furthermore, in the Elohistic narrative, Joshua is no longer a boy and the apprentice of Moses, but a full-grown man and warrior, leading the hosts of Israel against the Amalekites (Ex. 17.9 ff.). Likewise Ex. 18 gives the Elohist account of the institution by Moses of judges and officers, and is the Elohistic parallel of the Jahwistic version of the institution by Moses of the seventy elders as judges in Num. 11.16 ff. In this latter story the tent of meeting outside the camp is the place where the seventy elders are selected and ordained. Here, too, the lad Joshua is the apprentice of Moses in the tent of meeting. In significant contrast to the Elohistic narrative and theology, the Jahwistic writers told that Israel was led through the wilder- ness by Jahwe Himself, in the form of the pillar of cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night (Ex. 13.21 f.); furthermore, that Moses stood upon the most intimate terms with Jahwe, beheld Him constantly, and even, according to J2, ventured frequently to expostulate with Him. Another significant dif- ference between the Jahwistic and Elohistic conceptions of the Deity and the manner of His worship, will become clear shortly, and will confirm the distinction we have drawn. There can be no further question, that, despite the practical unanimity of Biblical scholars in assigning Ex. 33.7-11 to E, it is nevertheless the work of J, and the product of the southern kingdom. This, too, may explain, or even be further borne out by the fact that these verses stand in immediate proximity to C2, likewise the product of the southern kingdom, and incorporated by secondary J writers into the J code. Now it is significant that this tent of meeting outside of the camp is never represented as the place of sacrifice, but only as the place where Jahwe meets with Moses or with Israel and reveals His divine will. Apparently sacrifices might be offered</page><page sequence="9">The Tent of Meeting 133 in any suitable place. Apparently, too, in the simple desert cult, the role of sacrifices, while undoubtedly important, was nevertheless secondary rather than primary. Just this is stated explicitly by both Amos (5.25) and Jeremiah (7.22). The only sacrifices of unmistakably desert origin mentioned in C2 are those of firstlings and firstborn (Ex. 34.19 f.) and the annual Passover sacrifice (ib. 25). Seemingly the enlargement of the role of sacrifices in Israelite religious practice was due in the main to the influence of Canaanite agricultural religion, with its frequent,. annual festivals, numerous occasions for sacrifice, many fixed and well equipped altars and shrines and elaborate priesthood. In the desert, it is well-known, animals were and are killed, even for sacrifice, only very rarely. Moreover, the Arabic Kaihin, priest, related to the Hebrew BUD, was primarily a diviner.8 At any rate, even though the references of the J code to the tent of meeting without the camp be comparatively few, they suffice to indicate that sacrifices were not offered there at all, but that it was only the place for communing directly with Jahwe, receiving the oracle and ascertaining the divine will. In fact just this is implied by the statement of Ex. 33.7, that who- ever wished to seek Jahwe, would do so at the tent of meeting, and by the additional statement that Moses would go out thither, not to offer sacrifice, but to meet and converse with Jahwe. It is clear, too, why Joshua remained constantly in the tent of meeting. Divine will is supreme, and cannot always be antici- pated. Whenever Jahwe should choose to speak and to utter His oracle, some one, duly qualified, must be present to receive it. 1 Sam. 3 furnishes a similar picture of the lad, Samuel, the apprentice of Eli, remaining constantly in the sanctuary to receive the oracle, whenever uttered. Now it is significant that the actual meeting-place of Jahwe with Moses was not within the tent, but at the tent-door. There Jahwe would descend in the pillar of cloud, and speak with Moses. It is noteworthy, too, that in the oldest stratum of the Priestly code, the tabernacle is still called the 1tB71 AR, the tent of meeting, because there Jahwe meets with Israel; and the 8 Cf. Wellhausen, Beste2, 134.</page><page sequence="10">134 Julian Morgenstern meeting-place is still the door of the tent, and not yet the holy of holies (Ex. 29.42). Jahwe descends from on high; clearly, therefore, He does not dwell in the tent. It is merely the tent of meeting, the -TV7 F and not yet the dwelling-place, the P)Wn - That conception is the product of a later age and theology. Returning to Ex. 33.7-11, we can easily picture the scene. Moses stands within the door of the tent of meeting, and Jahwe, in the pillar of cloud, stands without, just before the door. Obviously the conception of this tent of meeting, not the dwell- ing-place of Jahwe, but the place of revelation, is based directly upon the older picture of the sacred cave upon the top of the mountain in C2 and in the Elijah story. There, too, the wor- shiper stands inside the entrance to the cave, and Jahwe passes by in the open space in front. Further corroboration of this conclusion will be forthcoming. Here the question is naturally suggested, what was the rela- tion between this tent of meeting, the place of the oracle, and the ark? According to tradition, and to this practically all modern Biblical scholars subscribe unreservedly, the ark was deposited within the tent of meeting. This tradition is based chiefly upon the account of the tabernacle and its contents in the Priestly code, upon the picture in 1 Samuel of the sanctuary at Shiloh with the ark as the main cult object, and upon the picture of the tabernacle set up at Jerusalem by David to receive and house the ark (2 Sam. 6). All these pictures are, however, the products of religious syncretism in Israel, which culminated in the evolution of a national religion out of the earlier, inde- pendent, tribal cults. Originally the tent of meeting and the ark could have had absolutely no relation. For, regardless of the divergence of opinion of modern scholars, as to whether the ark originally contained a sacred stone, a betyl, or even two such sacred stones, or whether it was an empty throne of a deity, this much is certain, that the ark itself was the deity, or contained the deity, or symbolized the actual presence of the deity there, at the spot where the ark stood. The presence of the ark then within a tent or building of any kind implied that the deity of the ark was actually resident within that place. This is the implication of every passage of the Bible, where the ark is repre-</page><page sequence="11">The Tent of Meeting 135 sented as deposited within a tent, a house or a sanctuary.9 This conception is particularly graphic in the final picture of the Priestly code, where the ark is deposited within the holy of holies, and Jahwe takes up His permanent residence there, upon the mercy-seat above the ark, and there, now, meets with Israel, through its representative, the high-priest, once each year, on the Day of Atonement (Ex. 29.45 f.; 40.34 ff.; Lev. 16). But since the tent of meeting, as originally conceived, was in no sense the dwelling-place of Jahwe; since only the priest of the oracle entered within it, and Jahwe would only descend and meet with the priest at the door of the tent, and impliedly Him- self never entered therein, it follows that the tent of meeting and the ark represent absolutely contradictory, unharmonizable, and totally unrelated concepts. Certainly the ark was originally the palladium of the tribe of Ephraim, and due to the eventual ascendency of this tribe over the northern, agricultural tribes of Israel, it became finally the palladium of all the northern tribes. The tent of meeting, on the other hand, was manifestly pat- terned after the sacred cave on the top of the mountain, men- tioned in C2, the document in which the Kenites play so conspicuous a role. The Kenites in turn were intimately related to the southern tribes, and eventually came to be regarded as 'With the possible single exception of 1 Sam. 3. There vv. 4 and 10, particularly as emended according to LXX, imply that Jahwe comes, pre- sumably from some remote place, to speak with Samuel. This conception accords but poorly with the statement of v. 3, that the ark was in the room. Possibly these words are a harmonistic gloss. As has been already remarked, the picture here of the lad Samuel, the apprentice of Eli, remaining constantly in the sanctuary to receive the oracle, whenever it might be uttered, parallels that of the lad Joshua, Moses' apprentice, also constantly in the tent of meeting. Furthermore, this picture of Samuel as the apprentice of Eli, impliedly therefore in training to become Eli's successor, contradicts the picture of Eli's two sons, who represent their father in the undoubtedly older tradition of 1 Sam. 2. 12 if., and are naturally regarded as the normal successors of their father. 4. 4 and 19 ff. depict Hophni and Phineas as primarily priests of the ark. Furthermore 1 Sam. 4-6, the chapters which give the most graphic picture of the ark as the palladium of Ephraim, are absolutely silent as to Samuel. This may well indicate that Samuel had primarily no connection at all with the ark, but was from the beginning conceived of as the future priest, still in training, of the oracle of a sanctuary, modelled by the J authors of 1 Sam. 3. 1-19 after their picture of the tent of meeting.</page><page sequence="12">136 J'ulianr Morgenstern an integral part of Judah, even although at least one of their clans, the Rechabites (1 Chron. 2.55), maintained uncompro- misingly its nomad mode of living throughout the entire period of the kingdom. That they exerted a powerful, determining influence upon the prophetic movement is evidenced, not only by this little booklet, C2, and the dependent work, C1, but also by the stories of the relations of Elisha and Jeremiah with the Rechabites (1 Ki. 10.15 ff.; Jer. 35). Furthermore, the tent of meeting plays a role in the J document parallel to the role of the ark in the E document. We must conclude, therefore, that in the early tribal days before David and before the evolution of a syncretistic national religion, the tent of meeting had been the palladium or cult object, or at least the nearest approach thereto, among the south- ern tribes. It was not a cult object in the strict sense of the word, for a cult object possesses a direct sanctity, either as the deity himself, or as containing the deity, or as the immediate symbol of the deity, and therefore is itself an object of worship. But this the tent of meeting was not. It was sacred only because of its use, because it was the place where Jahwe would descend and meet with His people or His priest and reveal His will. That deities, conceived of as actually dwelling upon a distant mountain, were none the less thought able to come to the aid of their distant people, is proved by Jud. 5.4 f. and Deut. 33.2. The tent of meeting was the visible symbol that, wherever the tribes might be, Jahwe could come to them, whether only to reveal His will, or to protect them and lead them through the desert. Nevertheless He still continued to dwell upon His desert mountain. And there, although Israel had long since estab- lished itself in Canaan, and probably within the more advanced and cultured circles, so-called, Jahwe was thought to have taken up His residence in the Temple at Jerusalem, Elijah, animated by ancient shepherd ideas, brought from his old home to the east of the Jordan, shepherd ideas closely akin to those of the pastoral southern tribes, still sought out Jahwe. Manifestly, too, this very institution of the tent of meeting, with its implication that no matter where they might be, Jahwe could always come in person to answer His people's call, pre- cluded the idea of idols or cult objects of any kind. There was</page><page sequence="13">The Tent of Meeting 137 no need to symbolize Jahwe's presence, or to represent Him in concrete, tangible form, when He could always be summoned, or else came of His own accord when needed. The very conception of the tent of meeting made the use of idols and cult objects illogical and impossible among the southern tribes. On the other hand, all the northern tribes seem to have employed idols and cult objects regularly in their worship. That, in the syn- cretistic national religion, despite the preponderance of the num- bers, wealth and superior culture of the northern, agricultural tribes, the principle became firmly established that Jahwe should be represented by no image nor cult object, must have been due entirely to the dominating influence of the southern tribes under David at the time when the Philistine yoke was thrown off and the united nation came into existence. This principle was constantly reinforced by the prophets and prophetic codes, as witness C2 (Ex. 34.17), C1 (Ex. 20.23) and Deuteronomy. Images or cult objects in the religious practice of the nation, or of the southern tribes or kingdom, were always the result of non-Jahwistic influences, and were regarded by the southern prophets as altogether discordant with the true worship of Jahwe. This was a part of the great contribution of the south- ern tribes to the religion of Israel and of the world. With the establishment of the united kingdom by David, a conscious policy of religious syncretism was inaugurated. The old conception of separate tribal gods had finally given way to the new conception of Jahwe as the national god, the god of the entire nation. This conception, fostered by many and various influences, had been evolving slowly but surely since the entrance of the tribes into Canaan. Now that it had at last become a conscious reality, it required some definite, concrete expression. Accordingly David planned a new national sanctuary at his new capital, and actually erected a tabernacle there as a temporary shrine. Into this he brought, with considerable pains and with all due honor, the ark, the ancient palladium of Ephraim and the northern tribes, which had been lying for a half century or more, apparently half forgotten, at Kiriath-yearim. Undoubt- edly he deposited likewise in this temporary national sanctuary, the ephod, the ancient cult-object of Benjamin, which Ebiathar had brought with him when he escaped from Nob, and which had</page><page sequence="14">138 Julian Morgenstern served David so well in his early years as an instrument of divination. Not impossibly he deposited also within this national sanctuary whatever other ancient tribal idols and cult objects he could lay his hands upon. In all likelihood, the brazen ser- pent, accorded divine worship until the days of Hezekiah, and therefore destroyed by him (2 Ki. 18.4), was originally a tribal cult object, which had found its way into the national sanctuary in the days of David. The purpose of the great king is self-evident. By thus install- ing as many as possible of the ancient tribal cult objects in the new national sanctuary, he sought to express concretely to the minds of all the tribesmen, that their old tribal gods were all summed up in this new national god; that actually he was no new god, who had supplanted their old gods, but that in reality all the old, tribal gods were contained in him, and he was a kind of composite picture of them all. In other words, the new, national sanctuary was a kind of tribal Pantheon. Whether the original tent of meeting was included among the sacred objects deposited in the national sanctuary cannot be determined with certainty. Actually 1 Ki. 8.4 tells that in the Temple of Solomon there was deposited with solemn ceremony, not only the ark, but also the tent of meeting, and all the sacred objects. If the passage may be relied upon, it is, of course, conclusive. Probably, however, we must agree with the major- ity of Biblical scholars, that the historical accuracy of the verse should not be insisted upon too strongly.10 However, the verse manifestly implies a clear-cut distinction between the original 'tent of meeting' and the other, totally unrelated tent, which was merely the matter-of-fact house of the ark. Naturally, however, the national religion, with its funda- mental and deep-rooted opposition to idols and cult objects, could not long countenance the presence of cult objects per se in the national sanctuary. Eventually the ark ceased to be an object of veneration in itself, and came to be regarded as sacred only because tradition had reinterpreted it as the receptacle of the two tablets of the Decalogue, and, in the Priestly code, as 1 In his commentary to this verse David Kimchi says that Solomon brought up the ark from David 's temporary sanctuary on Zion, but the tent of meeting from Gibeon, where it had stood all these years. Of course by the tent of meeting he meant the tabernacle of the Priestly code.</page><page sequence="15">The Tent of Meeting 139 the seat or throne of Jahwe. Tradition sought also to reinter- pret the old brazen serpent, by representing it as having been made by Moses to relieve a plague of serpents in the desert. But here, apparently, tradition did not succeed in its purpose. The people persisted in according the brazen serpent divine honors, and so it had ultimately to be destroyed. Similarly the old tent of meeting was naturally, and apparently quite speedily transformed into a tent or tabernacle, within which the Deity actually dwelt. This evolution was fostered by the fact that the ark, which, in the syncretistic national cult, came early to be regarded as the most sacred object in the national sanctuary, had actually in the olden days of Shiloh, and also during the campaigns of David (2 Sam. 11.11), been deposited within a tent. With this ancient tabernacle of the ark the equally ancient and originally totally unrelated tent of meeting came naturally to be identified. From now on 'the tent of meeting', OR'7N Vl37, designated the sacred tabernacle or shrine in which the ark was deposited, and in which also the Deity was thought to dwell. However, the original nature and meaning of the tent of meet- ing were not completely forgotten. Apparently the l'ln- of Solomon's Temple and the holy of holies of the tabernacle of the Priestly code actually symbolized the ancient sacred cave, with, however, the added syncretistic idea that this cave was the abode of the Deity, rather than only the place of the revela- tion of his divine will. Similar sacred chambers seem to have been regular and integral parts of the great shrines of the west- ern Semites, as is, in fact, implied by the consideration that Solomon 's temple was patterned after Phoenician models. From the Phoenicians the idea seems to have passed to the Greeks, among whom the Ey'-apov, etymologically a Hellenization of the Semitic 111p7, was the sacred, oracular cave chamber of the large Greek sanctuaries.1" 1' Cf. Chwohlsohn, Die Ssabier und der Ssabismus, 2. 332-337. That the tent of meeting could originally have had no connection with the parakk'^, the cells or chambers of the Babylonian pyramid temples, in which a deity was thought to have taken up either temporary or permanent abode, or with sacred tents in other Semitic cults in which a deity was thought to dwell, is self-apparent. Those structures belong rather to the class of the tent in which the ark or some similar cult object, that symbolized the presence of the deity, stood.</page></plain_text>
