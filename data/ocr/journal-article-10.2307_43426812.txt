By William Ridgeway, Sc.D., F.B.A. [pp. xv + 448, with 92 illustrations.] (Cambridge : at the University Press, 191 5. Price 15.f. net.) It will be remembered that three or four years ago Prof. Ridgeway published a book on The Origin of Tragedy , in which he advanced the theory that Tragedy originated not in the worship of Dionysus, as had been hitherto supposed, but in the rites in honour of deceased " heroes." This new theory was subjected at the time to severe criticism by scholars who adhered to the older opinion. The present work is Prof. Ridgway's reply to his critics, being in fact, as he explains, an expansion of a short chapter in The Origin of Tragedy , in which he had briefly given "some evidence from the dramatic performances of Asiatic countries in support of his doctrine of the origin of Greek Tragedy." The body of the work is preceded by an introduction, defending his view and taking the offensive against the theory, started by Mannhardt half a century ago and made familiar to British readers by The Golden BougĶ attributing the periodic celebrations in Europe and elsewhere to the observances of the agricultural seasons, the worship of trees, and of amore generalised "Vegetation-Daemon." After this preliminary recon- naissance in force, the distinguished author begins his serious attack by a lengthy but interesting account of the Passion Play of Hassan and Hussein, still performed by the Shiah Mohammedans of Persia and India. He goes on to argue that Adonis, Attis, and Osiris had, before entering on godhead, been as real human beings as Muhammad, Ali, Fatima, Hassan and Hussein, and that the quasi- dramatic representations periodically given in their honour were performances having reference to the adventures and sorrows of their earthly life. He turns to India and argues in like manner concerning Rama and Krishna, describing the Hindu drama and elaborately discussing its origin and development. After dealing with</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 353 Burmah and China, he devotes a long section to Japan, urging that the indigenous religion, called Shinto, was chiefly a worship of the dead, and " that the No , or serious drama, is the lineal descendant of the ritual which from remote ages had been used in the Shinto temples to propitiate the spirits of the dead, in the hope that they would vouchsafe all kinds of blessings to their descendants and wor- shippers, and especially that of abundant harvests." He concludes by reviewing the dramatic dances of other parts of the world, where, it need hardly be said, he thinks that evidence to a similar effect is to be found. There is no room here to consider, as it deserves to be considered, a theory so far-reaching and revolutionary. Prof. Ridgeway's thesis, as originally enunciated in The Origin of Tragedy, was at least arguable : possibly it was sound. But he seems to have been stirred by criticism into going greater lengths than he intended, or than were at all necessary to support his argument. For if not asserted in so many words, it is implied that all dramatic performances grew out of rites at the graves of deceased chieftains and heroes, and that all gods are deceased human beings. It is true that the author does not commit himself in words to universal euhemerism, but, in asserting the universality of ancestor-worship, he assigns the cult of a dead man or woman as the origin of one great god after another, he resolves nature-spirits into deified human beings ; and, forgetting how impossible it is for the human mind to overleap the boundaries of anthropomorphism, he con- tinually interprets anthropomorphism as a proof that the divinity is regarded as having been literally once a man. We ask at length in bewilderment, Where then are the gods that were not once men, and to what origin would Prof. Ridgeway refer them ? Happily we need not accept his theories to value his book. It is written with all his verve and directness. Its impeachment of " the solar and vegetation theories of Kuhn, Max Müller, Mannhardt, and Sir James Frazer" is vigorous and effective, though the solar theory of Kuhn and Max Müller was already as dead as Antinous. By its masterly presentation of evidence it compels opponents to review and restate their own position. Thus it will be of material use in reaching definite results, which the present writer believes will not be those arrived at by the author, at all events in the extreme form here advocated. Meanwhile it is a delight to read ; and the numerous illustrations from photographs and other sources enliven its pages, and many of them help to render the descriptions of dances and dramatic performances vivid and comprehensible.
