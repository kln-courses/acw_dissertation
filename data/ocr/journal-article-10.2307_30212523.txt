<plain_text><page sequence="1">Hardy's Shelley By PHYLLIS BARTLETT VERYONE who knows Hardy at all well is aware that he loved Shelley, and he appears to have loved him for himself as well as for his poetry. Mrs. Hardy tells us that he cherished even the most remote approaches he had made to the footsteps of Shelley: as the fact that in childhood he and his mother had once put up at the Cross-Keys, St. John Street, Clerkenwell, where Mary Godwin and Shelley used to meet. He cherished the one meeting he had with Sir Percy and Lady Shelley, the visit he had paid to Mary Shelley's grave in Bournemouth, and to Shelley's grave in Rome.1 At Max Gate he kept a portrait of Shelley near the chimney-piece.2 Sir James Barrie, who knew him intimately, at a dinner immediately after his death, speaking of the copy of Shelley's poems that Hardy carried in his pocket when a young man, declared: There are a hundred, a thousand, pencil marks... that look now like love messages from the young poet of one age to the young poet of a past age. What in human experience can be more stainless? I think Hardy's first words in the Elysian Fields were, "Which is Shelley?"3 It has been my good fortune to examine closely these very pencil marks, an investigation I was all the more eager to undertake since for years I have wondered just why Hardy with his tragic and ironic sense of life responded so warmly to the optimistic Shelley. Hardy's pocket Shelley, bought and carried in his pocket when he was twenty-six years old working in the architect Blomfield's office, is owned by Mr. Frederick B. Adams, Jr., who most generously allowed me to copy Hardy's mark- ings.4 It is a small, squat, cheap little book titled Queen Mab and Other Poems by Percy B. Shelley, published in "The Cottage Library" series at Halifax in 1865. Its contents, in addition to Queen Mab, are Alastor, 1.

Hardy wrote his name in it twice: on the title-page and on the fly-leaf where he gave all the particulars, T. Hardy 16, Westbourne Park Villas 1866 He would have hoped the book might be returned to him if mislaid. After 1882 Hardy owned the Buxton Forman edition of Shelley's complete Poetical Works in two volumes,5 but the little Cottage Library book remained on his shelves. It is wonderfully revealing of what Hardy particularly noted in the days when he was studying the craft of poetry more diligently than that of architecture. There is only one marking in Queen Mab and two in Alastor, but with The Revolt of Islam (around the title of which he wrote, "Hyde Park-morning") his pencil got busy, and by the time he reached Pro- metheus Unbound it was unstinting. No one marks poetry systematically unless he is preparing an academic paper, and I neither expected nor found a system in Hardy's underlining and marginal markings. By far the greatest number of markings are of separate words and phrases. Some of the passages are clearly doctrinal and reflect points of agreement between the two poets; a few of these will be cited later. But there are also lines and passages that I guess to be "heart messages"-Shelley the man speaking to Hardy the man, as Barrie said the markings were Hardy's messages to Shelley, and I begin by mentioning a few of these. It seems evident from Hardy's dated poems that he was in love in the same year or years, 1866 or 1866-1867, that he was marking his Shelley, and his own amorous feelings may well have been attracted to Shelley's identification of ideal love with light. In The Revolt of Islam he double- scored a whole stanza in which Laon first describes Cythna as a "shape of brightness," "Most like some radiant cloud of morning dew . . ." (II.xxiii). And, although he seldom marked a whole lyric, he did the "Life of Life!" song in Prometheus (II.v.48-71). He also cherished the concept of the true union of lovers, marking as one of only two passages in Alastor the lines describing the voice in the Poet's dream of the "veiled maid" that "was like the voice of his own soul/ Heard in the calm of thought" (153-154). He liked the idea that, at twelve, Cythna was Laon's "sole associate" willingly wandering over the earth with him (II.xxv). Later in the poem, when Cythna is supposed dead, he marked Laon's neo-Platonic notion that his own face 5.

(IV. xxx. 8-9) And when she is rediscovered, three stanzas that describe the meteor- illumined lovers reunited in their ecstasy appealed to him (VI.xxxi- xxxiii). Finally, Hardy marked Cythna's resolution that, when they have accomplished all they can for freedom, they share an "undivided tomb."6 It was a trying year for him, discouraged as he was by the refusal of all editors to accept any of his poems, and a few of the underlinings probably reflect this disappointment as well as his determination not to let it deflect him from his purpose. It was almost predictable that Hardy would mark the phrase, "the wisdom of a high despair," which the percipient speaker at the end of The Revolt of Islam says is "lent/ To man" when the bearers of high hopes are destroyed (XII.xxviii.8), and that the one philosophical phrase he would underline in the opening speech of Prometheus would be the four words, "misery made me wise." But part of this wisdom is never to give up hope even as those Who bear the untransmitted torch of hope Into the grave .... (P.U.III.iii.170-172) So, in the several solemn precepts of Demogorgon in the concluding stanza of Prometheus Unbound, Hardy double-scored just one: To love, and bear; to hope till Hope creates From its own wreck the thing it contemplates. This "spell," the last words scored in Hardy's pocket Shelley, may have stood him in good stead while he waited for literary success. It would be pointless to cite all the separate words and phrases that attracted Hardy, but two or three observations about them may be of interest. He underlined scores of verbs, even some very ordinary ones. It seems likely that he felt his own verses lacked variety of verbs. Equally often he underlined participial adjectives. He was aware of adjectives with the suffix "-less": such as "herbless," "loveless," "moveless," and- three times-"foodless." He was attracted by Shelley's way of describing eyes, a forecast of his own interest in eyes when he came to write novels. For a tired child he liked the phrase, "her waning eyes"; for Prometheus while still on the rock, his "lidless eyes"; for corpses, their "horny eyes"; and for eyes unaccustomed to weeping, the same startling adjective. Far and away, though, Hardy's greatest interest in Shelley's text at 6. IX. xxix; cf. the last line of Hardy's poem "1967."</page><page sequence="4">18 KEATS-SHELLEY JOURNAL this time was his mastery of natural description. Hardy, who had spent the first two decades of his life in the country, was well qualified to judge the accuracy of Shelley's observations. He marked passages that describe winds and waters, meteors and tempests; and evidently antici- pated Carl Grabo's appreciation of Shelley's scientific information, for in the antiphonal chorus of The Earth and The Moon in the last act of Prometheus, the only stanza he marked in its entirety is the one that employs "the phenomena of cloud formation and atmospheric elec- tricity to symbolize the creative round of life."7 Hardy marked many more short phrases or single words within Shelley's descriptions of natural scenes or phenomena than he did whole passages, far too many to quote, but it can be said that he was most steadily impressed by Shelley's ability to recreate the effects of wind, of light, and of shade. Just as a sample, Hardy liked the "cold lips" of breezes, "winds that die in wastes," "the silence of a tempest's birth," and "curdling winds." From the images of light and the many more of shade or darkness that he underlined, his consistent interest in Shelley's verbs and participles can be illustrated. For example, he underlined: "Darkness ... was poured upon the ground"; "the hue/ Of the white moon . . /Suddenly stained with shadow did appear"; the shade of a forest covered "The waning stars prankt in the waters blue"; "the sphered light" of Earth; a "storm-extinguished day"; and the "burning threads/ Of woven cloud." In spite of all these markings and what they may have taught Hardy about diction, Shelley can scarcely be said to have been a direct "in- fluence" on his poetic technique. The closest point of poetic contact seems to be between Prometheus Unbound and The Dynasts. When thinking out the best form for this epic-drama Hardy would almost certainly have reread Prometheus and Hellas as well as the Greek tragedies. In fact, as William R. Rutland pointed out, he quotes from Hellas in his Preface.8 Hardy was questioning "Whether mental per- formance alone may not eventually be the fate of all drama other than that of contemporary or frivolous life .. . ," and went on to say: The mind naturally flies to the triumphs of the Hellenic and Elizabethan theatre in exhibiting scenes laid "far in the Unapparent," and asks why they should not be repeated. But the meditative world is older, more invidious, more nervous, more quizzical, than it once was, and being unhappily per- plexed by- 7.

Here Hardy gives us a lead, but a reading of Hellas leaves one convinced that the management of the chorus in relation to the historical events has no kinship with the construction of The Dynasts. I'm afraid that we must all yield to the discoveries of Hoxie N. Fairchild and John A. Cassidy and acknowledge that in Robert Buchanan's "philosophical- historical drama on the Napoleonic tradition," The Drama of Kings (1871), has been found "The Immediate Source of The Dynasts."9 It is fruitless to push the more tenuous influences of Shelley on points of structure. We need not, however, abandon the thought that Hardy's Spirits were descendants of Shelley's creation. Buchanan's supernatural Chorus breaks up and speaks in different voices, but they are "not differentiated Spirits" as were Shelley's in Prometheus Unbound and Hardy's in The Dynasts. As a reminder, the Spirits in The Dynasts are those of the Years, of the Pities, of Rumour, and the Spirits Sinister and Ironic, each of these having its attendant Chorus; in addition to which there are the Shade of the Earth, Spirit-Messengers, and Recording Angels. Of all of these only the Shade of the Earth bears resemblance in name to any of Shelley's more complicated array of Spirits in Prometheus Unbound, and the resemblance is in name only. The Shade of the Earth in Hardy's scheme is the least vocal of his Phantom Intelligences. The Spirits all know something, but this Shade exists to ask them questions. It opens the drama by asking: "What of the Immanent Will and Its designs?" and describes itself as "but the ineffectual Shade" of Earth "the Travail- ler," who herself is a thrall to the Will. The role of uninformed ques- tioner has nothing in common with any of the three different but equally vocal manifestations of Earth in Prometheus Unbound. Some of Shelley's Spirits are seen by the other actors in his drama and participate in the events. Some are seen only as impersonal shapes: "airborn shapes" like "flocks of cloud" or "fountain vapors"; "dark Forms and Shadows"; or "visions of strange radiance." Many others are never seen, only heard. With the exception of Rumour, who occa- sionally slips on the guise of man and mingles with the throng to spread his advanced news, none of the Phantom Intelligences in The Dynasts is seen by the human actors. Even the reader is not invited to visualize them. We have only the one conventional touch afforded by the Spirit Ironic who refers to the Spirit of the Years as "grey" and "old." And we 9. PMLA, LXVII (March 1952), 43-64.</page><page sequence="6">20 KEATS-SHELLEY JOURNAL know that the Spirit of the Pities is "young." Occasionally the Spirit of the Pities and the Spirit of the Years whisper in the ears of the real, his- torical personages who are startled because they do not know where the voice is coming from. The device is a valid dramatization of the psycho- logical experience that we usually express in the phrases, "Something warns me," or "Something tells me." These whisperings are deviations from Hardy's general plan of allowing the unvisualized Intelligences to speak and sing only to each other for the reader to overhear. They could not mingle among the real participants of the Napoleonic drama as Shelley's could among his mythological characters. Yet they have the honor of opening and closing the vast epic-drama, conversing in an Overworld as unvisualized as themselves, and are omnipresent throughout the action, bearing all the weight of how his- tory, dispassionate time, malice, and Thomas Hardy might look on the scenes the poet chose to create. For, no matter how truly these Intelli- gences are all alike creatures of his own fancy, Hardy clearly takes sides among them. His heart is with the Pities. These Intelligences are de- scribed in the Preface as the only ones who approximate to "'the Uni- versal Sympathy of human nature-the spectator idealized' of the Greek Chorus." They "sway hither and thither as wrought on by events." These Pities are forever touched by small calamities as well as large. Their youthful eyes rest on the individual. They lament that it took Nelson three hours to die. In this fundamentally human trait they resemble Shelley's creation of the Spirits "Whose homes are the dim caves of human thought" (P. U., 1.659). Shelley's Spirits note the soul of love in revolutionary warfare; the gallantry of a man who in a sea disaster "gave an enemy/ His plank, then plunged aside to die"; the "Pity, eloquence, and woe" that are known to the sage; and the creative imagination of the poet. These are all specific evidences of man's good qualities. Likewise the Pities note in one of the grimmest scenes of the winter retreat from Moscow, when an improvised bridge over the Beresina broke, plunging those who were on it to an icy death: Then women are seen in the waterflow-limp forms upbearing their infants between wizened white arms stretching above; Yea, motherhood, sheerly sublime in her last despairing, and lighting her darkest declension with limitless love. (Dynasts, III.I.x) They alone of the Phantoms sing in aerial music about this pathetic calamity. Shelley's Spirits who dwell in the human mind are given the power of prophecy and explain lyrically in the first act that their foresight of a better world to come rests on the struggle of "Wisdom, Justice, Love,</page><page sequence="7">HARDY'S SHELLEY 21 and Peace" to increase themselves. Appropriately, these Spirits base their faith in human powers. Hardy's Pities, however often they have been delivered lectures by the other Intelligences as to the blindness, the nescience of the Immanent Will, end the drama with a Chorus of hope. They ask whether the heart of the Will may not awake Promptly tending To Its mending In a genial germing purpose, and for loving-kindness' sake? They have not forsaken their human attitude, their belief in the exist- ence of a Heart in this indifferent Will and its potential ability to feel simple human kindness. If this does not happen to the Will, all that lives might as well die. But no sooner have the Pities so declared than, in full Chorus, they exclaim over a Shelleyan vibration: But-a stirring thrills the air Like to sounds of joyance there That the rages Of the ages Shall be cancelled, and deliverance offered from the darts that were, Consciousness the Will informing, till It fashion all things fair! This sudden, supernatural, lyric conclusion is much more in the mood of the last act of Prometheus Unbound than are the grave, but more uplifting words of Demogorgon that end Shelley's drama. Demogorgon is older than time whereas the Pities are young, so it is artistically ap- propriate that they respond sensitively to the stirring that thrills the air, just as Ione and Panthea did before the closing utterance of Demo- gorgon: IONE There is a sense of words upon mine ear. PANTHEA An universal sound like words: Oh, list! The final insight of the Pities is intuitive, and in this respect they re- semble Shelley's daughters of Ocean. In the second half of this essay I turn to the heart of my topic: those aspects of Shelley's thought and feeling that Hardy would have found most congenial. Since Prometheus Unbound and The Dynasts are in mind I start with pity. Compared to other emotional experiences it is young, the latest acquired of our human endowments, and so far only imperfectly acquired. This is one of the meanings in the philosophical allegory of Prometheus Unbound. Until the Titan, chained to his rock, experi-</page><page sequence="8">22 KEATS-SHELLEY JOURNAL enced complete pity he was powerless to overthrow Jupiter. This im- portant theme is stated in the opening speech of Prometheus when he exclaims about his attitude toward Jupiter: "Disdain! Ah, no! I pity thee." (I.53) A moral transformation has happened to him, for with the advent of pity has fled the capacity to hate. Prometheus can no longer even remember what hate was like. What is more, he has learned that pity is the attribute of justice and makes this clear to Mercury: For Justice, when triumphant, will weep down Pity, not punishment.... (I.403-4o4) Yet Prometheus does not need Mercury's pity and tells him to Pity the self-despising slaves of Heaven, Not me, within whose mind sits peace serene. (I.429-430) Since he has come to the point of pitying Jupiter, naturally he also pities the Furies who come to torment him: I weigh not what ye do, but what ye suffer, Being evil. (I.480-481) The greatest torture to which a Fury submits him is an account, marked by Hardy in his 1866 text, of the sad plight of men-terror in their hearts, hypocrisy and custom instead of reason in their heads, evil and good confused. These are the men Prometheus had tried to help, and the fearful picture of their suffering brings him to the consummation of his own: Thy words are like cloud of winged snakes; And yet I pity those they torture not. Fury: Thou pitiest them? I speak no more! (I.632-634) With which the Fury vanishes. These lines are the climax of the first act. I stress the all-important role of pity in this act because some critics of Shelley write as if this were a new revelation to him and a rather awkward grafting of Christian doctrine onto his Platonic thinking. It is true, as Carl Grabo1o and others have said, that since the days of Queen Mab, Shelley had come to accept the ethics of Christ, but he is quite careful in the first act of Prometheus not to make Prometheus' expres- sions of pity sound specifically Christian. Prometheus does not "forgive" Jupiter and the Furies, he "pities" them. The words are not synony- mous. "Pity" is involuntary and may be impersonal, "Forgiveness" is voluntary and personal. The word "forgive" appears only once in the whole drama, in the last stanza of Demogorgon's closing speech where his second precept to mankind is to "forgive wrongs darker than death lo. Grabo, pp. io, 15.</page><page sequence="9">HARDY'S SHELLEY 2 or night." I think Shelley's avoidance was deliberate, because the verb "forgive" bears the indelible impress of Christian prayer, whereas "pity" has more universal connotations. In sacred Athens, near the fane Of Wisdom, Pity's altar stood; Serve not the unknown God in vain, But pay that broken shrine again Love for hate, and tears for blood. Thus the chorus of Greek captive women implored in Hellas (733-737). It was a shrine at which Shelley had always worshiped, and I make the point because some readers of Shelley in their distaste for his expres- sions of self-pity have failed to appreciate his abiding capacity for pity- ing others. He pitied anyone who suffered from oppressors: the girls Harriet Westbrook and Emilia Viviani, the victims of the Manchester Massacre, the Greeks under the domination of Turkey, even Keats whom he thought slain by a cruel review. A lastor is his pitying lesson on "those who attempt to exist without human sympathy"; The Revolt of Islam is alive with pity, and Cythna in her ode links Pity with Peace and Love as the attributes of good men and free (V, song, stanza 2). In his Preface to that poem Shelley stated as one of the "pictures" of en- lightenment it contains: "vice not the object of punishment and hatred, but kindness and pity"; the idea was not new with Prometheus. Shelley pitied all who are weak, as he did the weak ones in love in a lyric Hardy knew well, "When the lamp is shattered." He even pitied the weak plants, especially the "companionless Sensitive Plant," that were choked by rank growths after their fair gardener died." I quote one stanza from The Sensitive Plant. The winter was bitter, And under the roots of the Sensitive Plant The moles and the dormice died for want; The birds dropped stiff from the frozen air And were caught in the branches naked and bare. (III.g8-1ol) And then from another poem: Yes, the coneys are scared by the thud of hoofs, And their white scuts flash at their vanishing heels, And swallows abandon the hamlet-roofs. The mole's tunnelled chambers are crushed by wheels, The lark's eggs scattered, their owners fled; And the hedgehog's household the sapper unseals. iI. Compare the third part of The Sen- sitive Plant with Hardy's description of a wood in winter in The Woodlanders (VII).</page><page sequence="10">24 KEATS-SHELLEY JOURNAL This is the opening of a song of the Chorus of the Years (Dynasts, III. VI.viii) in answer to the Pities' sentient comment on the wet field of Waterloo the night before the battle that The green seems opprest, and the Plain afraid Of a Something to come.... In rhythm, in detail, in pity for the weak and defenceless, this poem of Hardy seems to me closest of any of his poems to being an echo of Shelley. I have felt the need of underscoring Shelley's sense of pity because it is not felt by all his readers. To argue the point of Hardy's would seem a work of supererogation. It too is everywhere, as I think his read- ers have finally understood. One remembers immediately his passionate pity for Tess and Jude, but that is because they are its most outstanding objects. He created character after character in his novels and poems who were weak, duped, deserted; and his pity for his own creations is often so strong that it overweights his prose. He managed it better in verse; "To an Unborn Pauper Child" is an excellent example. Or take his treatment of the death of Nelson in The Dynasts where Hardy adds a speech to the recorded words of the dying man. Down in the cockpit of the Victory Nelson is informed that the gunner who shot him has been picked out and killed "stone-dead." He exclaims: 'Twas not worth while!-He was, no doubt, a man Who in simplicity and sheer good faith Strove but to serve his country. Rest be to him! And may his wife, his friends, his little ones, If such he had, be tided through their loss, And soothed amid the sorrow brought by me. (I.V.iv) The Hardy who struck that note for Nelson would not fail to respond to the same note in Shelley. In pity they were most attuned. But beyond this emotional affinity there were ideas that they shared. There is their common view of custom, traditionally held social and religious beliefs. The insidious power of custom to ruin men's lives is a revolutionary tenet that Shelley never forsook. Following the overt versification of Godwin's doctrines in Queen Mab, The Revolt of Islam and Prometheus Unbound are full of it, and in his 1866 copy Hardy marked several passages that allude to Traditions dark and old, whence evil creeds Start forth, and whose dim shade a stream of poison feeds.12 Marriage institutionalized by church and state, formalized in vows, and indissoluble was one of the worst of these traditions.

The husband in the poem "The Burghers" asks himself, as Phil- lotson did in Jude, about his relation to his wife and her lover: And I may husband her, yet what am I But licensed tyrant to this bonded pair? Says Charity, Do as ye would be done by. Hardy inveighed against the cruelty of custom as ardently as Shelley and was as vitriolically attacked. In Dowden's Life of Shelley, Hardy's marked copy of which is also in the possession of Mr. Frederick B. Adams, Jr., he found a sentence from one of Shelley's letters, "The immediate fruits of all new opinions are indeed calamity to the promul- gators and professors; but we see the end of nothing, and it is in acting well, in contempt of present advantage, that virtue consists,"13 against which he wrote in the margin, "cf. Milton's Doctrine of Divorce." Hardy's allusion is to words he knew well, for he versified them at the end of "Lausanne: In Gibbon's Old Garden" (1897) where he has Gib- bon's spirit ask: "Still rule those minds on earth At whom sage Milton's wormwood words were hurled: 'Truth like a bastard comes into the world Never without ill-fame to him who gives her birth'?" Social and religious customs, which are so often brutal in their effect, blunting the mind as an instrument for new thought, the heart for natural love, are man-made. And man, according to Voltaire and his followers, made his own God. Cythna in The Revolt of Islam phrased this theory well. She is instructing the mariners who rescued her from her lonely rock and asks them challengingly whether an "immortal power," withdrawn, has care for their human needs. What is that Power? Ye mock yourselves, and give A human heart to what ye cannot know: As if the cause of life could think and live! What is that Power? Some moon-struck sophist stood Watching the shade from his own soul upthrown Fill Heaven and darken Earth, and in such mood The Form he saw and worshipped was his own. (VIII.v.i-3,vi.i-4) 13. Edward Dowden, The Life of Percy Bysshe Shelley (London, 1886), II, 338. The letter is to Southey, August 17, 18-o. Southey had written Shelley that his opin- ions must have "brought immediate misery upon others, and guilt which is all but ir- remediable on yourself." He implored him to study the Christian faith.</page><page sequence="12">26 KEATS-SHELLEY JOURNAL The sophist's dream has led to man's endowing the Power with human concepts of tyranny that lead him to accept "Priests and Kings, Custom, domestic sway" as his ministers. This is Shelley's conception of a per- sonal, anthropomorphic God. Hardy has deep pity for this God. He imagines Him explaining to man how futile it was for man to have made Him and telling man that the truth had better be faced: The fact of life with dependence placed On the human heart's resource alone, In brotherhood bonded close and graced With loving-kindness fully blown, And visioned help unsought, unknown. These lines are from "A Plaint to Man," and the theme is pursued in "God's Funeral" where the same quality "loving-kindness" that appears in the "Plaint" and at the end of The Dynasts is named as key to what man wanted his created God to possess.4 Thus for similar reasons Shelley and Hardy repudiated the tradi- tional Judaeo-Christian God, but that did not free them from the necessity of confronting the eternal problem of evil. Both of them looked at it squarely. "... if way to the Better there be, it exacts a full look at the Worst," so Hardy in In Tenebris (II). And Shelley in the Preface to The Revolt of Islam said that as part of his education "I have seen the theatre of the more visible ravages of tyranny and war, cities and villages reduced to scattered groups of black and roofless houses, and the naked inhabitants sitting famished upon their desolated thresholds." Like Hardy, he knew the look of the Worst. In Queen Mab he had used Godwin as his spec- tacles; in Prometheus Unbound he saw it without assistance and it looked much the same way. The Spirit of the Hour is his spokesman at the end of the third act, which on his first writing was the close of the drama. Man suffers guilt and pain because "his will made or suffered them" (III.iv.199). In the fable, before he was enlightened by pity and quickened to power by his reunion with love, Prometheus, the human principle, had given Jupiter all he had; hence he was ultimately respon- sible for Jupiter's power, though not for his evil mind (I.380-381, 389). It will be remembered that Demogorgon, in answer to Asia's question- ing, named God as the creator of the living world and all the good things it contains but refused to name the creator of "terror, madness, crime, remorse," and other woes and evils (II.iv.19-28), answering only, "He reigns." This is an extremely difficult point on which A. M. D. 14.

Rader are particularly helpful.1'" They see the imageless, unnamed "He" as "inherent in the world of Time." It is the temporal world of nature that accounts for the "chance, and death, and mutability" named at the end of the Third Act as The clogs of that which else might oversoar The loftiest star of unascended heaven, Pinnacled dim in the intense inane. Rader calls this "inescapable evil" objective and opposes it to the sub- jective evil in men's minds. It is the "mind-created evil" that might in "An hundred ages" (IV.61) be willed away if, as Spinoza believed, the mind could be liberated from the bonds of time. Mary Shelley's oft- quoted Note to the Drama on Shelley's theory of evil in which she wrote dogmatically that he "believed that mankind had only to will that there should be no evil, and there would be none," is thus probably best read as an over-statement of this concept of subjective evil. Hardy's view of the problem of evil is perhaps clearer. Men are pushed about against their wills by a power over which they have no control. Their very helplessness leads them to do wrong. In his novels this power is usually named in classic fashion, as the gods or chance; in his short poems and The Dynasts in contemporary fashion, as the Im- manent Will. This impersonal Force or Will must in time acquire human attributes, and that means intentions which are loving and kind, since by nature human beings want what is fair and good. This is the gist of all the Pities' utterances in The Dynasts. What is more, there are signs of hope that the Will may be in the process of gradually becoming humanized. They are perhaps best expressed in the poem, " 'AI'NQITOt EQLt." Hardy has said that mortal man cannot know "How much of consciousness informs" the Willer, and in the last two stanzas suggests: Perhaps Thy ancient rote-restricted ways Thy ripening rule transcends; That listless effort tends To grow percipient with advance of days, And with percipience mends. For, in unwonted purlieus, far and nigh, At whiles or short or long, May be discerned a wrong Dying as of self-slaughter; whereat I Would raise my voice in song. 15. I am indebted to Mr. Frederick A.

Every once in a while one of these extraordinary improvements that Shelley foresaw does take place. The myth of Prometheus Unbound necessitates a sudden change to the Better, but Shelley found ways of reminding the reader that in reality there will be no such sudden Earthly Paradise, "veil by veil, evil and error fall" (III.iii.62) says Prometheus after his reunion with Asia and his unbinding. And the last words of Demogorgon return us to earth and its imperfections. Shelley's optimism is not unrealistic.'6 Hardy in his "Apology" of 1922 repudiated the term pessimism as applied to his thinking and writing, quoting In Tenebris to the point. He said that all his explorations of reality were made "with an eye to the best consummation possible: evolutionary meliorism." I think Shelley would have been delighted to call himself an evolu- tionary meliorist if he had thought of the term. After all, he was deeply affected by the evolutionary theories of Erasmus Darwin who predated Lamarck in his belief that each species of plant or animal evolves out of the necessity of responding to its environment, in other words that its own vital reactions bring about its changes. Erasmus, a daring thinker, went so far as to utter the following imaginative speculation: . . that all warm-blooded animals have arisen from one living filament, which THE GREAT FIRST CAUSE endued with animality, with the power of acquiring new parts, attended with new propensities, directed by irrita- tions, sensations, volitions, and associations: and thus possessing the faculty of contriving to improve by its own inherent activity, and of delivering down those improvements by generation to its posterity, world without end! 7 This is evolutionary meliorism on an exalted note, pitched to Shelley's ear. On the contrary, Charles Darwin's theory that the various species evolve by the survival of the fittest did not sound so agreeable to Hardy, for if the fit are to survive and improve they can only do so by force of hardship or disaster. It is significant that in The Dynasts a Chorus of the Ironic Spirits explains what happens to the human race within the framework of the later Darwin's findings. They have Beheld the rarest wrecked amain, Whole nigh-perfected species slain By those that scarce could boast a brain; Saw ravage, growth, diminish, add, Here peoples sane, there peoples mad, In choiceless throws of good and bad.

So, if in conclusion I may return to James Barrie's fancy and leave Hardy where, in a sense, I invited Barrie to introduce him, looking up Shelley in the Elysian Fields, let us hope that after agreeing on evolu- tionary meliorism Hardy will have neglected to tell him about the Survival of the Fittest and will instead have concentrated on his hope that the Immanent Will may grow in percipience and thus in loving- kindness. Shelley would have been a sympathetic listener. Queen's College Flushing, New York</page></plain_text>
