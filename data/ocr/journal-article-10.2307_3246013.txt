<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2003-2004 INTRODUCTION Material evidence matters. Singly or cumulatively, material evi- dence changes our view of ancient society - even of ancient political structures. The simple truth of this assertion can be illustrated reference to the 150 or so 4th Ct BC inscribed bronze tablets recently recovered from a sanctuary in Argos. One of the texts that have not come down to us from antiquity is the Aristotelian Constitution of the Argives, but these finds may remedy this deficiency, once cleaned, read and published, since they describe, in some detail, Classical Argive institutions other- wise unattested. Similar tablets have been found at Lousoi in anc. Arcadia (modem Achaia) and, according to newspaper reports, at Thebes. This example is straightforward, and one that most ancient historians can easily appreciate. More difficult to see, perhaps, is the cumulative effect of new material evidence which has been changing our view of periods from the Palaeolithic to the present. Neanderthals are not normally associated with Greece, but every year evidence of extensive MPal occupation in the Greek mainland increases. This evidence is no longer confined to the usual cave sites. Neolithic Greece too is much better known. In the Cyclades and Crete, we are now beginning to grasp the extent of the Late and Final Neolithic settlement pat- tern. In Macedonia, it is clear that not all Neolithic occupation is confined to the usual toumbes or magoules. Many Macedon- ian Neolithic sites are flat - so flat that they have often been completely obscured by later alluvium. Such sites consist of complexes of postholes and pits, filled with quantities of bone, pots and lithics (for the significance of this, see below). Changes in our view of the Bronze Age, the period that contin- ues (particularly in Crete) to occupy the lion's share of the attention of foreign prehistorians working in Greece, have not been quite so dramatic - though the number of newly discov- ered neopalatial 'palaces' on Crete has fundamentally changed the terms of the debate on Minoan political structure and insti- tutions. Our view of the EIA, Ar and EC1 periods has however been revolutionized. Let me illustrate with reference to two regions, Crete and Macedonia. One of the longstanding problems associated with Archaic Crete is what happened in the 6th Ct BC. There is no particular lack of written sources, or of inscriptions. But the material evi- dence - including cemetery evidence - for much of the island for the period ca 600 to ca 530 BC is almost absent. This is in itself as much an historical as an archaeological problem. Recent excavations in Azoria have shown what many have sus- pected - that the 'gap' is not of material evidence per se, but of 'artistic' material evidence. What these excavations have revealed is a complex with several Ar phases, the last of which clearly dates to around 500 BC, with pottery far plainer than anything else in Ar Greece. Such clearly stratified evidence confirms earlier hints from Elefthera, Afrati and Praisos. At the opposite end of the Aegean, in Macedonia, the accumulation of evidence presents a diametrically opposite picture. Over the past twenty years or so, the EIA 'type site' of Vergina and the Ar to EC1 'type site' of Sindos have been supplemented by numerous other cemeteries, of which Archontiko Giannitson is perhaps the most important. More significantly, human osteo- logy has not been neglected, and so it should be (and sometimes already is) possible to undertake the kinds of social and sym- bolic analyses of burial practices that we simply cannot under- take for the S Aegean. Even before analysis, certain patterns are clear enough. EIA cemeteries are extensive but generally poor in grave goods, gender symbolism is muted and imports rare. Female graves seem to be 'richer' than male. By the 6th Ct, this has all changed. The 6th Ct is the heyday of the Macedonian 'warrior grave', equipped with arms, an Illyrian helm, a gold mask and considerable quantities of imported Attic and Cor pot- tery. Such material expression becomes more muted in the 5th Ct, though the Macedonian 'warrior grave' makes a spectacular comeback in the 4th Ct. It is not so much the specific content of each grave, or the fact that Ar Macedonians deposited their valuables in graves and not in sanctuaries, but the contrast with Central Greek and Cretan practices that tells us something important about Cretan and Macedonian societies, even as it raises questions that are not amenable to simple answers. Similar considerations apply to Macedonia in the LC1 period - the time of Philip and Alexander. One pattern that seems clear is the number of sites which can be dated to the period 350-275 BC, as contrasted to the paucity of MHel sites. This too must be telling us something significant about the population and man- power of C1 Macedon that contributed to Macedon's spectacu- lar military success. These patterns have a spatial dimension. A careful reader of the section on the Nomos of Thessalonike would be able to con- trast the strongly 'Macedonian' symbolic patterns evident in the cemeteries to the W and N of the city with those to the SE (par- ticularly Souroti) that fell within the territory of the Chalcidian League, where burial practices have much more in common with the S and Central Aegean. Similarly, a careful reader inter- ested in ethnic and cultural boundaries within the early Roman Empire could not fail to notice that the Rom trench graves near Amphipolis are quite distinct from the 'Thracian' tumulus burials, a practice which continues to be found in areas to the N and E of the colonia at Philippi until at least the time of Trajan (if not later). I labour this point because these spatial patterns can only be discerned in 'Archaeology in Greece' if sites are, generally speaking, arranged geographically, rather than alpha- betically. Many have voiced objections to this innovation, but I think such objections are misplaced. Alphabetic ordering may seem convenient, but is in fact arbitrary. Names change in Greece, and sites may go by several names - the ancient name of the site, the modem (contemporary and 'hellenized') name of the largest village or town near the site, the topothesia name of the site itself, and the older name of the village or town (often an Albanian, Slavic or Turkish name) by which a site was (espe- cially in northern Greece) first known to archaeologists and topographers. It is not clear which of these names should be preferred in an alphabetic ordering of names, and any such pref- erence would (necessarily) have 'political' overtones. Second, alphabetic ordering does no service to the student of ancient topography and obscures the kind of spatial patterns which are themselves a form of archaeological evidence. The larger the area covered, the greater the distortion. So, to cite another Macedonian example, there is near Asprovalta in the Gulf of Strymon (but in Central Macedonia) a farmhouse that is remarkably similar to the Vari house in Attika. Spatial ordering makes it clear that this house is found at the E extremity of the Nomos of Thessalonike, that it lies between Stageira in Chalkidike and Amphipolis in 'E Macedonia'. Alphabetic ordering would completely efface this fact, and might lead the reader to suppose that such rural farmsteads are typical of set- tlement within the kingdom of C1 Macedon (which they are not). For these reasons the organizing principle, where sites are listed geographically within a nomos, and are generally listed from S to N and W to E, has been retained. There is less evidence from Central Greece this year, since the information comes almost entirely from newspaper reports. Noticeable however is an increasing concern with the conser- vation and presentation of sites. In part this is due to the Athens 2004 Olympic Games - sites in Attika and in the Peloponnese</page><page sequence="2">2 JAMES WHITLEY have been spruced up in advance of the Games, and this has raised questions in the press of whichperiods should be empha- sized. The old assumption, held to apply to Attika in particular, that only the Cl period really matters has been increasingly questioned. Another welcome trend is the increasing attention given by the EBAs to monuments of the Ottoman period. Only a few years ago such monuments were largely neglected, but they are now increasingly valued, studied and even restored. Just as archaeology in Greece is changing, so are archaeolo- gists working in Greece, and these changes have a major effect on the kind of information 'A in G' provides. Generally speak- ing, archaeologists (particularly prehistorians) have a better training in scientific techniques and 'theory' than they used to, and they also have a more international approach. It is not unusual to find references to sites elsewhere in Europe - the comparisons with Flag Fen and the Somerset Levels with the site of Dispilio in W Macedonia, for example, are those made by Greek archaeologists, not by me. It is no longer unusual to encounter archaeologists working for the 1st, 2nd and 3rd EPCAs in Attika who have experience of working in British prehistoric sites, such as Barnhouse in the Orkneys. These effects are most noticeable in Macedonia, where the archaeology department of the University of Thessalonike, a department with strong British links (particularly to Sheffield) has now educated a new generation of Greek archaeologists. These archaeologists have applied a whole battery of scientific techniques (faunal and plant analysis, soil micromorphology) to prehistoric (particular- ly Neo) sites in the region. The impact of this generation has also been felt outside prehistory - the human osteology of the cemetery of Amphipolis is probably now the best studied in Greece, with important implications for our understanding of Cl and Hel social structure and demography. All this ought to provide British scholars interested in the ancient world with a unique opportunity to re-write the history of those regions (Macedon, Argos, Crete) that our ancient texts have neglected. But this is an opportunity that is, I fear, likely to be missed, at least by British scholars. To be sure, there are now plenty of archaeologically-minded historians around, and material evidence must always be examined in the light of ques- tions of general historical interest. But material evidence also requires material scholars (archaeologists and epigraphers) with 'hands on' expertise, and there are now too few of either in Classics departments in British universities. There is, to be sure, no lack of interest in Bronze Age Crete, and no lack of Classical iconographers involved in the re-interpretation of Attic black figure and red figure vases, in much the same way as Classical scholars have always provided new 'readings' of ancient texts. But very few Classical art historians of this kind see any need to come to Greece to look at material at first hand when so much is available through the CVA or the Beazley archive. Autopsy is a dying art. To turn to more practical matters, as in past years, 'A in G' has been compiled from various sources; this year we have used: the third volume ofADelt B Chron 52 (1997), which cov- ers an area from E Macedonia to Crete, including the islands), newspaper clippings from 1st April 2003 to 31st March 2004, individual contributions from Greek and foreign archaeologists, and from AEMTH 15 (2001) and 16 (2002), a fact which should partly explain the emphasis on Macedonia in this introduction. Eleni Hatzaki was solely responsible for the section on Crete, as she has been for the past five years. I have written up the pre- historic and Classical evidence for the rest of the article. This year Sophia Germanidou, of the 5th EBA based in Kalamata, has compiled the Byzantine sections, replacing David Turner. Dr Graham Oliver has helped on epigraphic matters. Sarah Strack has been responsible for translating the German contri- 1 Athens, anc. agora: late Roman period butions, and Maria Elena Gorini for the French and Italian. Thanks are due to many Ephoreias and all foreign schools for their contributions - and I hope they will forgive the sometimes heavy editing. In all this, I have been greatly helped by staff here in Athens, Penny Wilson, Helen Clark, Michael Boyd and Vicki Tzavara.

Professor John Camp (ASCSA) provides the fol- lowing report (see also Ethnos 12/12/2003): 'Excavations in the Athenian agora were carried out in June and July of 2003. As in the past few seasons, the work was con- centrated largely in the NW comer of the agora, known locally as section BZ. The area was divided into two parts: the N-S road and areas to the W and E of the road. After several years of exploring the Byz houses of the 10th Ct AD which overlay the area, we began this season to strip away their foundations and made substantial progress into the underlying Rom remains. Much of what was exposed dated from the 3rd to the 6th Cts AD (Fig. 1 shows the area in LRom times). At this early stage the full plan, the chronological phases, and the probable functions of the Rom buildings are uncertain. The main topographical feature was the N-S street which divided the area into two parts. The LRom walls on both sides of the street are recognizable from the use of the hard white lime mortar used to bond the fieldstones and assorted ancient blocks with which these rubble walls were constructed. Three threshold blocks, one W of the road and two to the E, give the approximate ground level in use at the time, some 50m lower than the floors of the overlying Byz houses. Where the Rom walls rose above this level their exterior surfaces were also plas- tered with lime mortar. Individual features encountered include a rectangular water basin to the W, and a well, terracotta water channel and settling basin to the E; drains and waterlines began to appear in the street during the final week. A seat block for a latrine suggests the possible use of at least one of the hydraulic installations in the area (Fig. 2). Three successive invasions left their mark on the area. W of the road, just to the S, we have the excavated remains of a bath built in the 3rd Ct AD. Dozens of tegulae mammatae (wall tiles with breast-like protrusions designed to allow the free circula- tion of heated air) were found this season and almost certainly come from this bath. Pottery found in the subterranean service passages to the S (I-J/2-3: 1) suggests that the bath went out of use when Alaric and his Visigoths attacked Athens in AD 396. A hoard of 431 bronze coins found just above, at J/1-2/17, indi- cates that the area was further threatened and/or damaged when the Vandals attacked Athens in the 470's AD. Final abandon- ment in the Rom period will have come as a result of the Slavic invasion of 582/3 AD. E of the road, a well (K 1: 2) of the 3rd Ct AD, excavated sev- eral years ago, seems to have occupied an open area and to have provided water for more than one building, including the one exposed this season. As it produced 24 coins and 6 bone dice, unusual finds for a well, it may be that one of the buildings was a taver or some other recreational centre. Evidence of occupa- tion of the area during the 4th Ct was found this year at the extreme N, where a shallow, unlined well (K 1: 4) produced abundant material of the mid 4th Ct AD (Fig. 3). It appears that this well, like the W bath, also went out of use as a result of Alaric's visit in AD 396. Previous work nearby had produced indirect evidence of activity by coroplasts, makers of teracotta figurines, from the 1st to the 4th Cts AD (deposits J 1: 1 and J 1: 5). Figurines, rejects, and moulds were found, though in limited concentrations and 2 Athens, anc. agora: latrine seat with no evidence thus far of any kilns. The pattern was contin- ued this season with the discovery of several terracotta pieces, one a plaque with a helmeted female deity, presumably Athena, though she is uncharacteristically burdened with wings, a cor- nucopia and a quiver; also noteworthy is a large figurine of a snub-nosed, pot-bellied Silenos (Fig. 4). To the E, excavations were carried out under #3 0. Astingos, demolished in March 2003. Almost immediately beneath were the tops of Med walls of rubble construction, following the NW/SE orientation set very early on by the line of the Eridanos River. As usual, they are of fieldstones, tiles, and reused ancient material set in clay and presumably are of private houses, IF Im 3 Athens, anc. agora: 4th Ct AD pottery</page><page sequence="4">4 JAMES WHITLEY m 4 Athens, anc. agora: terracotta figurines similar to those which have been encountered all over the sec- tions to the SW. Toward the W, heavy layers of ash and frag- ments of slag suggested that some industrial activity was car- ried out nearby. The uppermost fill had fragments of pottery of the 11th and 12th Cts (brown-and-green painted ware and sgraf- fito wares) and perhaps somewhat later. It is still too early to tell the dates of the walls. From this upper fill we also recovered a battered votive relief showing a mounted horseman, probably dating to the 4th Ct BC (Fig. 5). Work in the Eleusinion was completed this season with the excavation of two wells. One, on which work started last year, dates to the years around 500-480 BC and proved to be 12m deep, some 3.00m deeper than the average for the period. Near the bottom we recovered the staves of a wooden bucket but almost no period-of-use fill, suggesting that the well may have been unsuccessful in producing water, a situation not unparal- leled on the acropolis slopes, where the subterranean water tends to follow well-defined seams. Close by we excavated a second (Rom) well. This was also unlined, though collapsed tiles and stones suggest that the upper part of the shaft, where it passed through fill rather than bedrock, may have been lined originally. The well was some 6m deep and a distinct period-of-use fill was encountered at the bot- tom, consisting of about a dozen largely intact jugs and mugs, many with wheel-ridging and gouged decoration (Fig. 6), along with large fragments of several micaceous water jars. The clos- est parallels, from Robinson's groups L and M (H. S. Robinson, Pottery of the Rom Period: Chronology, Agora V (1958)), sug- gest that the well was in use in the latter half of the 4th Ct AD. As it lies just within the protection of the LRom fortification wall it is not clear whether or not its abandonment was the result of Alaric's attack in 396 AD. Also from the lower levels of the well came a small some- what battered marble head of a sleeping infant or child (Fig. 7). Eyes closed, he lies with his head tilted to his left; his left cheek bulges out and the entire right side is far more carefully finished than the (largely concealed) left. The pose is familiar as that of a figure of a sleeping Eros. Almost 400 examples are known, both in stone and terracotta (M. Soldner, Untersuchungen zu liegenden Eroten in der hellenistischen und romischen Kunst, Frankfurt (1986)). Unusual is the fact that our head is carved separately from the rest of the figure; normally the head rests on the child's hand, a pillow or some drapery, carved from the same piece of marble. Here, the head is finished in the round and there is a small round dowel-hole under the left side of the chin. Also surprising is the large hole, filled with lead and traces of some iron attachment, in the top of the head. A possible orig- inal location for this piece is the sanctuary of Eros and Aphrodite, excavated by Oscar Broneer in the 1930's on the N slope of the acropolis, some 250m to the SE. From the lining of the well we recovered a fragmentary inscription of the 4th Ct BC (Fig. 8). Parts of ten lines of text are preserved, with no more than eight letters surviving on any one line. Because the letters are vertically aligned however, and _ In 6 Athens, anc. agora: jugs, 4th Ct AD 5 Athens, anc. agora: 4th Ct BC relief</page><page sequence="5">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2003-2004 5 7 Athens, anc. agora: marble head much of the language is formulaic, it is possible to restore a line length of 21 letters per line.

The formulae are identical to IG 112 116, passed in the same year, and the decree may have to do with a treaty between Athens and the Thessalians.' Recent publications on the agora include John M.

At the SE another road led on to the Hippeios Kolonos, bounded by small workshops and washeries. Nearby at O. K.

Stroszeck (DAI Athens) report on work undertaken in May-July 2003, concentrating on the vicin- ity of the Sacred Gate and the road outside the Dipylon Gate: '(1) In the area of the Sacred Gate, under the direction of W.-D. Niemeier, the aims were (a) to complete the excavation of the strata in which the Ar kouros had been discovered in Spring 2002 (AR 2001-02, 10-11) and to search for further Ar remains, (b) to examine the road strata (and associated pottery) which relate to the building phases of the Sacred Gate (to be published by G. Kuhn), and (c) to confirm the date and function of the limestone base found in the proteichisma in November 2002 (AR 2002-03, 8). (a) The left arm (without hand) of the kouros was found in the same stratum as the other Ar sculpture. The fragment joins the torso (Fig. 9) and represents an important gain for the over- all appearance of the statue, which will be put on display in spring 2004 in the renovated Kerameikos Museum. No further fragments of Ar sculpture were found as the stratum in question was disturbed by later building activity. However, a Hel tile drain contained the fragment of an Ar marble head dating to the 1st half of the 6th Ct BC; the curls are covered by a veil, sug- gesting a female figure (Fig. 10). To date, no remains of Ar grave plots have been identified. (b) According to Thucydides (1.90-93), the Sacred Gate was built in the winter of 479/78. K. Kiibler demonstrated in 1943 that the gate had been built in two phases: the first, in 479/78, comprised the NW part of the gate; in the second phase the gate was extended towards the city and two passages with gateways were added. Kiibler dated the second, main phase of the gate to the Themistoklean period (470s BC). In front of the Sacred Gate, successive Ar to Cl road strata were found. Precise dates await study of the associated pottery, but it is clear already that the second phase of the gate is later than previously thought, possibly dating to the beginning of the Peloponnesian war. (c) The extension of excavation in the proteichisma demon- strated that the limestone base (Fig. 11, left) was surrounded on three sides by a wall made from large rectangular ashlar blocks. The wall was of H-shape and was built very close to the base. The structure opened towards the Sacred Way, and in its SW comer there was a clay slab, underneath which were found ani- mal bones (including those of suckling pigs) and Attic red-fig- ured pottery dating to 410-400 BC. The limestone block must therefore have been the base for an altar used for animal sacri- fice and the dedication of votives. Grooves and traces of wear provide evidence for the dimensions of the original altar, which was placed on the base. A re-measuring, conducted by G. Kuhn and N. Hellner, of the so-called LRom marble monument, which in 2002 was removed from the proteichisma (AR 2002- 03, 8) demonstrated that this monument was indeed the altar originally placed on the base. The altar was removed from its base when the proteichisma was built at the beginning of the 3rd Ct. BC and subsequently placed at successively higher levels until, in the 3rd Ct AD it was finally placed on top of the prote- ichisma which by that time was covered by earth. Following suggestions from the DAI, the Ministry of Culture has decided to replace the altar on its original base. The altar is the earliest</page><page sequence="7">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2003-2004 7 altar in Athens as well-preserved as this (see also Eleftherotypia 27/11/2003). (d) A subterranean arched structure was found underneath the Sacred Way (in front of the altar and below the Hel drain) which contained the sculpture fragment illustrated in Figs 10 and 11, right). The structure branches off from the wall of the river bank at a level of 0.80m above the bed of the Eridanos, and terminates in a shaft 6m further on. The structure has two marked changes in level, one 1.90m after the branching, and another im before the shaft. The floor of the shaft is made from four slabs of Naxian marble, probably spoliae taken from Ar tombs. The side-walls (1.3m h) are made from four roughly- hewn conglomerate orthostates supporting a wall of small stones set in mud mortar and covered with limestone slabs. A vertical marble slab creates a 1.2m-long basin beneath this opening. Above the shaft there was a well built from tiles (Fig. 11 shows the situation with slabs and well removed). No clear evidence for the construction date of the subter- ranean structure was found. However its end can be dated by its use fill, whose latest pottery is of the late 4th Ct BC An ampho- ra handle with a stamp of the Thasian official Deinopas dates to the first decade of the 3rd Ct BC. Accordingly, the subterranean structure was abandoned at the same time as the altar, coincid- ing with the construction of the proteichisma. Among the pot- tery from the structure and from above the altar were 'cult' vases, such as miniatures and Eleusinian kemoi. Apparently, the subterranean structure was used for the purification of the water that flowed into the basin from the Eridanos. The marble slab kept back the dirt, and the clean water could be extracted from the tiled well, water which was then probably used during cult activities at the altar. This might be an explanation for a passage in Strabo, Geographica IX.1.19 quoting Kallimachos who described Athenian girls drawing clean water from the Eridanos (Strabo questions that the dirty Eridanos river could ever pro- vide clean water). The altar and the subterranean structure apparently represent a stop along the processional way which ran from the altar of the Twelve Gods in the agora to the sanc- tuary of Demeter and Kore in Eleusis. (2) The two trenches begun in 2002 along the street in front of the Dipylon Gate, NE and SW of the modem drainage chan- nel, were continued under the direction of J. Stroszeck. The NE section (8.1 x 3.3m) comprises a sequence of 15 street levels from the 5th Ct BC to late antiquity. The street levels consist of thin, very hard layers. Between the street levels there are strata of fill, repairs and wash levels, and numerous drains. The drains were filled with sandy wash levels, demonstrating that they were abandoned once they clogged up. It was apparently cheap- er or safer to construct an entirely new drainage system than to clean existing drains. The first, very narrow road leading towards the Academy is probably situated under the modem drainage channel. In the later 5th Ct BC the street was widened considerably, the terrain which rises towards the E being levelled with a stratum of amphora sherds. Along the E border of the road, postholes were dug at a regular distance through this stratum and the later (4th Ct BC) layers. Their position and the regular spacing suggest that the postholes were used to set up platforms (ikria) from which the Athenians could watch the festivals of the polis tak- ing place in this area. The Cl and Hel street levels in the SW section (3 x 2.7m) correspond with those of the NE section. Here, the street was narrowed in the 1St Ct BC and a wall was built on its edge. A life-size male marble head, which originally belonged to a LCl tomb relief, was found included in this wall. From a stone struc- ture within the Rom street levels comes a marble border stone (horos) of the 4th Ct BC. It was set up as the result of a valua- tion conducted for the children of Nikeratos of Hagnous. According to the inscription, the plot concerned was worth 7000 drachmae.' ATTIKA AND THE MEGARID WESTERN ATTIKA AND THE MEGARID (3rd EPCA; 1st EBA) Eleusis. To Vima (17/08/2003) discusses conservation plans at the sanctuary. Naftemporiki (21/10/2003), Kathimerini (16/10/2003), Ethnos (16/10/2003) and Eleftheros Typos (16/10/2003) report on a section of the Sacred Way discovered 400m W of the sanctuary of Demeter. This 30 x 5.5m section, last repaired in Rom times, is surrounded by graves, the earliest (some MH and two Myc chamber tombs) having no clear asso- ciation, the later (LGeo, Arc, Cl and Hel) being grouped in roadside cemeteries. Two LRom cisterns, datable by coins to the 6th-7th Ct AD, and a Rom apsidal structure were also found.

Plateia Terpsitheas. Ethnos (24/12/2003) reports on exca- vation of a complete Rom insula (block or housing complex), complete with drains and cisterns. The 1850 coins found include one gold stater. Harbour of Zea. Bj0rn Loven (Danish Institute) reports on work undertaken in conjunction with G. Steinhauer (2nd EPCA) and D. Kourkoumelis (Underwater Ephoreia): 'The colonnade dividing shipsheds 1 and q was fully exca- vated. The rock-cut foundation cuttings accommodating the last two column bases in the colonnade provide especially impor- tant information on the architectural layout of the superstruc- ture, since these structures are not illustrated on Dorpfeld's 1885 plan of Shipsheds 1 and fl. An erosion line passing through the N side-passage of ship- shed ri continues through the W end of r's ramp structure, and a condition assessment of the area W of this line showed that this part of the ramp is severely damaged by erosion. Two foun- dation cuttings for column bases in the colonnade dividing ship- sheds qr and x were excavated. It was decided not to excavate 11 Athens, Kerameikos: limestone base</page><page sequence="8">8 JAMES WHITLEY the area to the W of the foundation cutting until a method of consolidating the crumbling bedrock has been developed. Evidence of different building phases was found. In 2002 a closed deposit in the upper end of shipshed rl's ramp was exca- vated, dated provisionally to ca 350-325 BC. On the basis of structural evidence, an earlier building phase was identified at the lower end of shipshed X's ramp. The superstructure of the shipsheds underwent major rebuilding at some point, but the chronology of the building phases has not yet been established. Several remains of roof-tiles similar to those found last year in the deposit on the ramp of shipshed rl were excavated in the submerged part of this building. Their distribution indicates that they probably belong to the roof the shipsheds. In addition we have found rock fragments with chisel marks, which provide information on the tools used for constructing the rock-cut parts of the Zea shipsheds. During the underwater survey in areas 1 and 2, we found evi- dence that strongly indicates that the slipways were longer than anticipated. Previously it was thought that the slipways were 50.50m, but cleaning the lower part of shipshed X (on which slipway the 50.50m measurement was based) proved that the lower end of this slipway had suffered considerable erosion. In area 2 we discovered two shipshed building phases on top of each other at different angles. Apart from the two different phases of shipsheds, the architectural structures clearly show that this section of the shipshed complex changed orientation at some time. We intend to excavate these shipsheds in 2004. The diving conditions in Zea are very difficult, and the Mark II design of the clear water enclosure system invented by Mr Charles Pochin proved essential for our ability to excavate the submerged part of the shipsheds.' Elliniko (Old Airport). Kathimerini (7/08/2003; 28/12/2003) and Eleftheros Typos (18/07/2003) report on excavation of an extensive cemetery of 150 graves, dating from Geo times through the 7th to 4th Cts BC. Finds include 250 whole pots, two bronze lebetes and a bronze hydria. The principal discovery was of a C1 funerary peribolos (family grave plot), with impressive marble grave monuments dating to the 2nd half of the 4th Ct BC, comprising two marble lekythoi, one anthemion stele and two monuments with sculpture in high relief, one with the figure of a man, the other showing one seated and one standing figure greeting one another. Demotics on the associated inscriptions identify the cemetery as belonging to the anc. deme of Euonomos. LAVREOTIKI (2nd EPCA; 1St EBA) Lavrion. Ta Nea (19/02/2004), Rizospastis (19/02/2004), Eleftherotypia (19/02/2004) and Kathimerini (19/02/2004) report on plans to create an archaeological park incorporating the major C1 mines and washeries in the area CENTRAL ATTIKA (MESOGEIA) (2nd EPCA; 1St EBA) Koropi. Ta Nea (20/03/2004) notes the discovery at Lambrika, on the Koropi-Vari road, of 1000 EH fragments of lead oxide, waste products from the processing of silver ore, dating to around 3000 BC. This represents the earliest evidence for the processing of silver in the Aegean. Kalyvia. Ta Nea (5/07/2003) notes the find of a textile fragment from an (undated) grave, now in the newly established Centre for the Study and Conservation of Textiles. Merenda Markopoulou Olympic 'Hippodrome' or race- course. Eleftherotypia (25/11/2003) and Kathimerini (20/12/2003) note discoveries over the last four years of rescue excavation near Merenda in advance of the construction of the new Olympic racecourse. These include a Neo settlement on a small hill, Neo occupation at the cave of Choni-Liangki (hill of Merenda), an EH settlement, Myc graves and a Geo-Ar-Cl cemetery (though this may be the same as one mentioned below). A Cl (4th Ct BC) sanctuary of Aphrodite, with a com- plex of small rooms, baths and garden invites speculation that this served as an anc. brothel. A slab outside the complex bears the name of the priestess, Nanion. Markopoulo-Paiania area. Ethnos (31/01/2004) reports on a number of finds which came to light during construction of the Attiki Odos, linking the airport to Athens and Eleusis. These include a LC1 sphinx, C1 cemeteries with fimerary periboloi at Pousi-Ledi and at Agios Andreas; another cemetery at Patima and a Cl sanctuary (established in 5th Ct BC) at the road inter- section to the new Airport. It is not clear whether this is the same sanctuary as the one near Merenda (see above). Spata - New Airport (Eleftherios Venizelos) Ethnos (1/07/2003) and Risospastis (1/07/2003) note an exhibi- tion of finds discovered in the course of the construction of the new airport. The 172 exhibits date from the Neo/EH until MByz times. Rafina. To Vima (11/09/2003) notes the discovery of a small Ar (ca 600 BC) sanctuary built over an earlier MH structure; finds include terracottas. Stavros Geraka (anc. Pallene). Kathimerini (20/12/2003) dis- cusses the significance of the location of the temple of Athena at Pallene (AR 2002-03, 11) for identifying the site of the Battle of Pallene in 546-5 BC (Hdt. 1.62.3-4). An anc. road linking Athens to the Mesogeion has been found at Cholargos, parallel to the modem 'Leophoros Mesogeion'. NORTHERN AND NORTHWEST ATTIKA (2nd EPCA; 1St EBA) Marousi, New Olympic Stadium. Risospastis (8/08/2003), Ta Nea (2/07/2003) and To Vima (12/09/2003; 17/09/2003) note discoveries in two locations. In the stadium (Kalogreza), exca- vation of a LRom (3rd Ct AD) cistern/bath complex with a mosaic floor also revealed an earlier Rom headless marble stat- ue of a woman, apparently Hadrianic (2nd Ct AD). Close by was a grain storage complex of MByz (9th-11th Ct AD) lined pits and storage pithoi, containing coins of 1075-79 AD and incor- porating one earlier C1 horos stone, and an MByz kiln. In anoth- er location nearby, a (Cl-Hel?) 'athlete's burial' was found, consisting of a marble cremation urn. Finds include two lekythoi and some gold leaf. Kifissia. Kathimerini (15/01/2004), Ta Nea (24/09/2003) and To Vima (25/09/2003) note the opening of a new archaeological museum at the junction of 30 Georganta and Kassavetis. Finds date from the 8th Ct BC onwards. Marathon, sanctuary of Isis at Brexiza. To Vima (21/10/2003; 9/01/2004) notes the discovery of two Rom (2nd Ct AD) marble hawks, undoubtedly representing Horus, from this complex, first investigated in 1968. The sanctuary seems to be associated with the estate of Herodes Atticus. Plans exist to open this com- plex to the public.</page><page sequence="9">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2003-2004 9 Soros of the Athenians. Kathimerini (26.06/2003) and Eleftheros Typos (26/06/2003) note conservation plans. Tsepi. M. Pantelidou Gofa (ASA) reports (Ergon 2003, 17-20) on conservation and study of finds from this EH ceme- tery, excavated in 1999-2000 (AR 2002-03, 12). While some EHI pots (e.g. the amphoriskos) can be closely paralleled with Cycladic types, others display local peculiarities, and seem to be the products of a local workshop. Rhamnous. B. Petrakos (ASA) reports (Ergon 2003, 12-15) on geophysical work undertaken on his behalf by D. Blackman (former BSA director), on two inlets, one or both of which may be identified as the harbour of Rhamnous, mentioned in the decree of the archon Menander (225/4 BC). The Geoscan RM- 15 results from the E inlet produced the clearest indications of harbour installations. Results from the W inlet (Tsonali/Agia Marina) are less clear. See also Eleftheros Typos (9/07/2003). Skala Oropou. B. Petrakos (Ergon 2003, 15-16) notes the dis- covery of a Hel Athenian decree, presumably from Rhamnous, later re-used as a grave cover and datable to the archonship of Menekles (267/6 BC). It honours Aristeides, son of Mnesitheos of the deme Lamptrai who, we are told for the first time, was general for the coastal countryside in that year; we also lear that his embassies included one to Antigonos Gonatas in Asia. The find throws light on the role of Rhamnous in relations between Athens and Macedon in the 3rd Ct BC. A. Mazarakis Ainian (ASA) reports (Ergon 2003, 21-25) on excavations of the Geo-Ar settlement. Work concentrated in the E sector on the Ar houses parallel to the anc. road leading towards the sea. Five rectilinear (orthogonal) house complexes have so far been distinguished. Raised stone thresholds in each of the doors undoubtedly served to prevent rainwater from the road from flooding the interiors. The find, in room Z, of a pithos (lekane) filled with oyster-shells dates this structure to the early 7th Ct BC. A further small circular structure, IE, was found beneath H (damaged by the 2002 rains), dating to ca 700 BC. The purpose of such structures remains unclear. ISLANDS OF THE SARONIC GULF, TROIZEN AND KYTHERA (2nd EPCA; 1St EBA) Salamis Cape Kynosoura. A. Simosi (EMA) reports, in ADelt B Chron 52 (1997), 1196, on a 'watching brief' undertaken in advance of the installation of a waste pipe. Further (underwater) remains of the tumulus of the 'Salaminomachon' were revealed. To Vima (30/1/2004) notes problems about the conservation of this mon- ument. Prof. Y.G. Lolos (Ioannina) reports on work at Kanakia: 'In 2002-2003 excavations continued at the site of Mycenaean Salamis (Kanakia), on the SW coast of the island (Fig. 12). The Myc urban complex, consisting of an acropolis, lower town and 'satellite' hamlets has already been identified with Old Salamis, referred to by Strabo in his Geographica (IX. 1.9) as being 'desolate' at his time (see AR 2000-01, 14-15; AR 2001-02, 14-15; AR 2002-03, 13). In 2002, a new building, designated IA, was excavated immediately S of building IA and E of building IB. It is a strong structure of impressive size, measuring 28 x 17m, with rooms arranged at three or four levels on a slope, and with walls built, to a large extent, of stone. It has now become evident that, architecturally and functionally, this building is connected to both building IA and building IB (Fig. 13). All three of them form a solid industrial compound comprising 41 rooms and other areas (workshops, storerooms, auxiliary rooms, corridors and passages), aptly established at the highest level of the coastal acropolis, with a main access from the NW. As with the other two elements of the large industrial unit investigated in 2001, the contents of building IA, mainly pres- ent in the destruction layer in rooms of its upper levels, consist principally of everyday stone tools (quems, grinders, whet- stones) in relatively limited numbers, as well as steatite spindle whorls and beads, and common pottery of LH IIIB2/LH IIIC:early type. These finds are not in keeping with the size, plan and architectural standard of the building. Also striking is the fact that several rooms in the W part of the building were</page><page sequence="10">10 JAMES WHITLEY E ..... ; Sv f { g 14 Salamis, Kanakia: bronze hoard 13 Salamis, Kanakia: building B found empty. The bulk of the material, here as elsewhere, appar- ently represents the final phase of occupation in the building, probably early in the LH IIIC: E period, marked by alterations in its plan, including the construction of rough blocking walls at three points. A find of special importance, marking as it does the f1nal stages in the use of building IA, is a small hoard of bronzes, hid- den in the floor of a niche in the upper wing (Fig. 14). This comprises a bronze sheet, initially folded, two chisels of differ- ent types and a sickle-like curving knife, closely matched in well-known hoards, of ca 1200 BC, from LMyc citadels and other sites. In 2002 excavation also progressed in sectors A and r, fur- ther W, on the saddle between the two heights, where rooms and other areas of two large adjacent compounds or complexes, pos- sibly comprising living quarters, were cleared. The main archi- tectural element that emerged in sector r, was a long building, roughly oriented E-W; access was possible through a propylon, marked by a single column base of stone, already identified on the surface of the ground in the preliminary campaign of 2000. Of exceptional interest among the contents of room 3 in building A, providing clear evidence of destruction by fire in LH IIIC:early, were a 'prestige' spindle whorl of highly pol- ished black steatite (Fig. 15), bearing incised decoration of lin- ear and whirling motifs, and very likely of Cypriot origin; a fragment of a flattened handle, with a suspension hole, belong- ing either to a brazier of LMyc type, hitherto unknown in our material, or more likely (on account of its fabric) to a charac- teristically Cypriot wall-bracket; and also a complete coarse ware stirrup jar (FT 164; Fig. 16), with band decoration on its body, a painted potter's mark on the shoulder and two horizon- tal incisions on the one handle, made after firing and very prob- ably in the spirit of a distinctly Cypriot marking system current at the time. On a lower terrace on the N slope of the acropolis, close to the course of the 'Kychreian Road', stands the autonomous building Ir, of (?)apsidal plan (inner dimensions 13.5 x 7.5m), with a main entrance on its W side; it was only partly excavat- ed in 2002. The rooms in its S wing may have been used for cult purposes, on the evidence of a group of ten clay figurines recov- ered from them, mostly of the &lt;&gt; and v types. In September-October 2003 work was mainly concentrated in sector r on the acropolis. A substantial part of the oblong building located in previous years, and set on an E-W axis, was 15 Salamis, Kanakia: steatite spindle-whorl 16 Salamis, Kanakia: coarse-ware stirrup jar</page><page sequence="11">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2003-2004 11 excavated. It is no doubt one of the largest com- pounds on the upper levels of the acropolis, measur- ing now 30 x 9m and certainly extending for another 13m to the W. Within its known limits, 13 rooms and other areas have already been investigated in all. The excavated part of the building, W of the propylon, comprises rooms in two parallel rows, or wings with an E-W orientation, arranged at slightly different lev- els. Communication between the two wings was achieved through transverse passages and a staircase. The initial plan (first phase) is characterized by entrances of unusual form, on the E and S side, func- tioning as 'check-points', and also by a long corridor, running E-W, in the N wing of the building. A second architectural phase, apparently associated with the final use (by newcomers or remnants of the popula- tion?) of building F in LH IIIC:early, is marked by the existence of hastily built walls, blocking both entrances and corridor. A corresponding phase has already been discerned in buildings IB and IA of the industrial unit further E. The excavation of building F has yielded a quan- tity of common pottery of LH IIIB/IIIC:early date and a considerable number of stone implements of usual types. Other finds of interest include: the lower half of a closed clay vessel functioning as a rhyton; a fragment of a vessel of Lapis Lacedaemonius; a T- type clay figurine and some pieces of other anthropo- morphic and animal figurines; fragments of two or three clay tokens; a hoard of 16 spindle whorls and buttons and several other isolated specimens of steatite or clay; also a large 'prestige' spindle whorl of black steatite, with incised decoration of thickly spaced flower and whirling motifs, comparable to that found in the adjacent building A, and plausibly of Cypriot provenance. In addition to a large fragment of a Cypriot copper oxhide ingot of type 2b, found at a point on the steep S slope of the acropolis at Kanakia in 2000 (for which see Y. Lolos, in Enalia VI (2002), 73-80), the recent Cypriot finds from buildings A and F may be taken to highlight some special connection between Old Salamis and Cyprus within the complex E Mediterranean milieu of ca 1200 BC, sustained even into the years of crisis and decline, shortly before the final abandonment of the Salaminian capital in L H IIIC:early, i.e. between 1190 and 1150 BC.' 5- 5m H- geometrisch Aigina Kolonna. F. Felten and St. Hiller (Austrian Institute/ University of Salzburg) report on excavations between the 18th August and 19th September 2003: 'Work included continuation of excavation of the so-called Attaleion at the W end of the hill, trials in the S hill, restoration works in the PH city, recording of possible structures in a 390m2 area S of the S slope by ground penetrating radar (GPR). The aim of work on the W complex (Fig. 17) was the com- plete recording of the N-S extension of the partly excavated structure. The most important finds were: An almost square building, built mostly from spoliae, in the N part of the area. The W wall was destroyed almost complete- ly by a LRom/EByz water channel. The S wall door, set off cen- tre, suggests a dining room, built during the Hel reorganization.

However, ProtoGeo/EGeo strata with two child buri- als (one cist and an enchytrismos in hydria - Fig. 18) excavat- ed W of the tiled channel, indicate that settlement activity (extending up to the W end of the cape) resumed after a gap in occupation in the 10th Ct BC. a ?2 x4960</page><page sequence="12">12 JAMES WHITLEY 18 Aigina, Kolonna: hydria 19 Aigina, Kolonna: terracotta figure In the central area of the complex, an area not included in the old excavations was studied stratigraphically. Part of a wall, interpreted as an altar by Furtwangler, appears to be the remains of a (votive?) shaft dug down from the Hel use level. The shaft probably coincided with the addition of two rooms at the N side of the complex. Below were identified two floor levels belong- ing to a open yard which originally opened towards the W, but was later reduced in size by the building of the W wall. The fill below the floors contained Attic black figure and L Cor pottery and dates the floor levels to the LAr period. Underneath those strata, an earlier use level was also identified here, containing fragments of ProtoGeo and EGeo pottery. The EIA horizon comprises also a paved area set on the bedrock which might be connected to the burials found in the N area. In the S area, the maximum extension of the complex could be defined as an open yard area with two rooms along the N side. The trapezoidal shape of the area was determined by the street running along the W side. Also here, the date of the foun- dation and use indicated by finds of LAr and EC1 pottery and terracottas (Fig. 19) from a succession of floor levels. In con- trast to the previously studied areas, here the pottery indicates continuity of use into the advanced phases of the Cl period, dur- ing which the E, S and W walls of the area underwent extensive repairs. The function of the area did not change during this peri- od as is demonstrated by two small chambers, containing roughly walled bothroi, in the S part of the yard. The earlier chamber to the N dates to the foundation period of the complex while the S chamber coincides with the repairs in C1 times. Both bothroi contained earth mixed with ash and fragments of bones and pottery, with the fragments found in the S chamber being clearly later. The S area was abandoned and filled in at some later date and was partially covered by a MHel pavement. The excavations of 2003 confirm the idea that the W com- plex was a coherent sacred space, initially built in the LAr peri- od and used continuously in the same function throughout the Cl period, subsequent to extensive repairs. It can be assumed that the function of the complex continued into the Hel period as demonstrated by the addition of rooms and a shaft in the cen- tral area picking up on the earlier structures. However, connec- tions with the Pergamene kings could not be proven so that the term 'Attaleion' coined by G. Welter should be abandoned. Work in the S hill area concentrated in the vicinity of the PH kiln discovered in 2002. The investigation yielded new evi- dence both for the sanctuary of the Cl/Hel period and the set- tlements of EIA and particularly M and LBA date. In the Cl/Hel sanctuary the S wall of the kiln is cut at a higher level by a stone foundation which can be interpreted as an altar according to its situation E of an antae building with which the foundation corresponds in length and orientation. The original width could not be established due to disturbances in late antiquity. However, the S comer cuts an earlier (votive?) shaft which contained, in the top layers of the fill, terracotta fig- urines and black glaze pottery. It remains unclear whether an L- shaped structure SE of the shaft can be interpreted as another shaft, however, a third shaft was identified W of the 'altar'. The latter shaft has a paved floor and contained ash, murex shells and a group of apparently deposited, intact LC1 vases. EIA settlement. Immediately W of the kiln there was found a cist tomb, dug down from a higher level, covered by slabs and containing the remains of a 25-30 year old man buried in a supine position with contracted legs (Fig. 20). The only offer- ings were fragments of an iron pin with finial disc and a bronze sphere. The pin and the amphora covering the tomb date the burial to the ProtoGeo period. This carefully built adult burial is novelty for Aigina-Kolonna as to date only child burials have been found, as is common for contemporary settlements.</page><page sequence="13">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2003-2004 13 M/LBA. The pottery kiln found in 2002 was further studied with regards to its structure and chronology (Fig. 21). A floor connected to its construction was found at the E side of the kiln and suggests a construction date in MHIII/LHI. The pottery found below this level comprised Cyc and Cretan imports as well as local ware. After abandonment, the kiln was filled in and built over by a wall running E-W. The pottery found in the fill, as far as can be told after preliminary study, dates the end of the use of the kiln to LHIIIA. The central support which held the grate was found, while of the grate itself only fragments could be identified along the walls of the kiln. Due to the long use of the kiln, at least three burnt floors could be identified inside the firing chamber; also the opening to the fire XXX was elevated several times. It is evident consequently that at Aigina, pottery was being produced locally long into the Mycenaean period. Immediately below the kiln the remains of a very large building were identified. The structure measured at least 20 x 20m and was made from very large blocks. The building technique, size and uncommonly thick walls demonstrate the importance of the building ('Grolsteinbau', large stone building). Underneath a floor which preceded the building of the kiln, a very thick fill stratum containing numerous pottery fragments was found. The stratum contained locally made matt-painted and burnished ware and a high percentage of locally made and imported M pottery and imported Cycladic pottery. Particularly fragments of M kitchen ware and conical cups made from local fabric, in connection with M artefacts found in previous seasons, leave no doubt that at some point Cretans were settling in Aigina. Preliminary study suggests that the M finds date to MM IIB to MM III. Consequently there is a chronological and probably also historical connection between the shaft grave of Aigina and the 'GroBsteinbau'. Restoration work in the PH city centre. The structure of the MBA house walls W of the temple of Apollo which were exca- vated in 1925 and later by G. Welter and have been exposed since has suffered substantially from wash and weathering. Consequently, the entire area was filled in as far as possible while it was attempted to preserve the unique picture of the MH settlement structures. In particular, care was taken not to alter the PH walls in any way and to preserve them in the state they were found. 20 Aigina, Kolonna: EIA grave 21 Aigina, Kolonna: BA kiln The survey in the area S of the Colonna hill using GPR had only limited results due to the large number of stones in the ground. Mostly, walls of the most recent Byz settlement were recorded. It can also be seen that the 5m w. Hel-Rom fortifica- tion wall (port wall) continues in a straight line to the S from where it is visible on the surface. The wall however is almost completely robbed.' Methana To Vima (5/11/2003) notes excavations at the hill of Agios Kon- stantinos, which may be a Myc 'peak sanctuary'. Two 'megaron structures' and Myc terracottas have so far been identified.

The building was constructed in the second half of the 4th Ct BC and housed at least two dining rooms in its central part, and in the E an altar in a presumably open space, perhaps associated with a</page><page sequence="14">14 JAMES WHITLEY 22 Poros, Kalauria: decorated pottery naiskos. In 2003, excavations were continued in both E and W parts of the building. In the W new evidence came to light con- cering not only the assumed stoa in front of the building (area D4 at the NW comer of the building) but also the earlier histo- ry of the site (area Dl inside the building) and the possible use of the structure in the first half of the second Ct BC (area D3 at the SW comer of the building). The excavation in area 4 revealed that what S. Wide and L. Kjellberg interpreted in 1894 as a stoa cannot have been one. Also, it became obvious that the construction in front of build- ing D could not have been an integrated part of the said build- ing. Instead, what was presumed to be the back wall of the stoa, and its SW wall, must have been an Ar terrace wall, dated through the pottery in strata 4 and 5 (area D1) below building D. It thus seems that the area to the S of this wall was filled in to create a terrace large enough for building D to be built on it in the L Cl period, which undoubtedly also meant an extension of the sanctuary towards the S. Below stratum 5 in area Dl the remnants of a N-S orient- ed, well-built wall were found, together with its floor layer stra- tum 6. The pottery found here (Fig. 22) can be fairly closely dated to around the middle of the 8th Ct BC, and comprises fragments of many small drinking vessels and some large, dec- orated amphoras and kraters. The assemblage is of a type gen- erally associated with cult in the EIA. This would seem to sug- gest continuity in the use of this specific area from at least the 8th Ct BC and into LCl times. Stratum 7, underneath the floor level, produced more pottery of LGeo type with an admixture of a few ProtoGeo sherds and perhaps some MGeo ones. In area D3, situated outside the SW corer of building D, a very large deposit of pottery datable to the 1st half of the 2nd Ct BC was found. A wall bounded the area towards the S, through which an entrance led into it; yet another wall was aligned with it to the S. The pottery in the deposit consisted mainly of plates, drinking vessels, cooking pots and other domestic pottery such as amphoras and lekanes. Fragments of lamps and loom- weights, and a large number of animal bones were also found, as well as at least two coins from Kalauria's own mint. Notably, no whole vessels were found, and only a few joining fragments among the more than 10,000 potsherds found in the deposit were retrieved. Possibly the material in the deposit originated in building D, where facilities for both cooking and dining in the latter half of the 4th Ct BC have been previously established. The fact that no material from the 2nd Ct has so far been found within building D can probably be attributed to the fact that lev- els later than the 4th Ct were removed during the 1894 excava- tions. The conclusion, of course, presupposes that the building continued in its original use for more than a hundred years. The stratigraphy in area D3 was simple. Stratum 2, which was the deposit, was superimposed by stratum 1. This stratum contained mixed material, some of it apparently originating in the deposit, but also a very large amount of tile fragments, cer- tainly once part of building D. Underneath the deposit nothing but bedrock was found. This would seem to mean that the area was completely cleared in order to receive the deposit and that this happened before the walls bounding it were built. We have to do with a single-occasion deposition, where the preliminary study of the bones indicate that the meat consumed was not grilled on the spit (they are in some cases only slightly burnt) but prepared in the many cooking-pots included in the deposit.' Kythera Ethnos (14/7/2003), To Vima (11/7/2003), Kathimerini (11/7/2003) and Apogefmatini tis Kyriakis (14/9/2003) note recent finds from the island. At the cave of Chousti Diakoftiou (Neo/EH?) occupation begins in the 4th millennium BC, and in Cl times became a shrine of Aphrodite. Neo pottery from the cave of Agia Sophia, Kalamo indicates use from the 5th mil- lennium BC , whereas finds from the cave at Agia Sophia, Agia Pelagia seem to indicate an ECh shrine. At the caves of Katafygadi Mermikari and Katsifadi M and Myc finds sug- gest some ritual use. At Kambi Karava and Mitata 'M' and LMyc chamber tombs have been identified, and at Viaradika a Myc tomb. At Palaiopoli, a Cl sanctuary of Athena Alea has been identified. Finds of 'M houses' in the area are consistent with a pattern of 'Second Palace' settlement outlined by the Kythera Island Project (see below). Hel finds from the islet of Antidragonara (see AR 2002-03, 15), including the 216 coins from 54 cities from all over the Mediterranean, have been inter- preted as coming from a sanctuary of Poseidon. Kythera Island Project (KIP). C. Broodbank (University College, London/BSA) and Vangelio Kiriatzi (BSA) report on the 2003 study season: 'Kythera Island Project completed its archaeological field- work in 2002 and dedicated the 2003 season to the study of material collected by the intensive survey. Cyprian Broodbank was joined, as the co-director of the Project, by Vangelio Kiriatzi, Director of the BSA's Fitch Laboratory. The principal aims of the study season were to advance study of the pottery and to complete that of the lithics. Work on the survey pottery concentrated on the material collected by tract-walking. In terms of overall distribution, this provides the most even sample of patterns of activity in the landscape through time, though it needs to be combined, as here for the Second Palace (Neopalatial) period, with information from gridded site collection in order to obtain a full picture. Tract pottery also provides much of our richest information concern- ing more recent periods of the past. For example, the origins, expansion and international trading connections of the post- antique port of Avlemonas are becoming clearer thanks to Vroom's study of the tract pottery from its vicinity, which itself forms part of a wider analysis of the rise and fall of specific anchorages around the section of the Kytheran coast that lies within our survey area. At another level, the sherd-by-sherd recording of tract pottery from the surroundings of Mitata vil- lage reveals different discard patterns over the last two centuries for different classes such as table-wares, cooking vessels, pithoi and water jars in different parts of the landscape. More period-specific detailed analysis focused on two phases. Broodbank and Kiriatzi refined their characterization of later Neo and EBA pottery, whilst a good start was also made by the Romanists on defining their local fabrics and imports, revealing especially dense activity around the former embayment adja- cent to Kastri. The ongoing process of up-dating our interpreta- tion of the material excavated at Kastri itself in the 1960s also continued. In 2003, this involved an in-depth re-analysis of the earliest Final Neo to EBA phases at Kastri, as well as prelimi- nary re-study of Second Palace levels by Eleni Hatzaki and Oliver Dickinson, and completion of a re-investigation of the Third Palace levels by Jeremy Rutter. The above studies were</page><page sequence="15">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2003-2004 15 combined with the re-processing of the unpublished pottery notebooks. Archaeometallurgy was also represented in the form of scientific analysis of artefact scraps and production debris from Second Palace, Cl and Rom levels. Both Tristan Carter and Tania Gerousi met their target of completing overall analysis of (respectively) the chipped and ground stone from the survey. The former's material includes definite LNeo, and possible MNeo types, arguably the earliest artefacts known from Kythera, and illuminates the fluctuating importance of obsidian in time and space. Gerousi's results present a very interesting picture of a ground stone industry overwhelmingly reliant on local materials, some only used close to their likely source area, and also almost entirely PH in date. Other research in 2003 included ongoing analysis of archival sources by John Bennet, Siriol Davies and Debi Harlan within a GIS environment constructed by Andrew Bevan. The poten- tial information here is remarkable. Here, for example, you see the contrastive distribution of two common Kytheran surnames in the 1724 Venetian census: Kasimatis in the S, and Koroneos in the N. Wider GIS analysis continues through the work of Bevan and James Conolly, as does our geoarchaeological research by Nancy Krahtopoulou and Charles Frederick. 2003 also saw the completion of the project's botanical fieldwork by Jenny Moody and Oliver Rackham.' Palaiochora-Kythera survey. S.A. Paspalas (Australian Institute) and Tim Gregory (Ohio State) report on the 2003 sea- son: 'The fifth field season of the APKAS project was conducted in July 2003. The first area surveyed by the team in 2003 was Ammoutses. The work conducted last year clearly showed that the area was a focus of human activity during various phases of the BA. This picture was further substantiated by the work car- ried out in July 2003; in particular the pottery collected shows a heavy concentration of E H and M-type ceramics. This result ties in well with surveys conducted to the S. The other major area of activity in 2003 was the region of Phoinikies in the far W of the island. While local lore makes mention of the discovery of numerous antiquities in this region, the obvious agricultural potential of the area and its possible exploitation in past times rendered it a region of prime interest to the team. Intensive field-walking documented the extensive spread of BA material in this part of the island as well. This finding significantly increases the area of the island which saw human activity during this early period, and furthermore, in a part of the island at a great distance from the one known settle- ment of the period, M Kastri, which lies on the E coast. The finds made at Phoinikies are by no means restricted to the BA; significant material of Rom and E Modem/Modem date was also documented and collected. The other focus of the work carried out in 2003 was the height of Agios Demetrios (Aroniadika). Survey work had been carried out here in 1999, and it had been noted that the pot- tery collected was practically all dated to the 16th Ct AD, the century which saw the destruction of Paliochora (the main pop- ulation centre of the region) by Barbarossa's fleet and, subse- quently, great turmoil on Kythera. Interestingly, the site is also characterized by what appears to be a rather rudimentary, though not insubstantial, fortification system. Given the date of the accompanying pottery and the known historical event of Paliochora's destruction it may be that Agios Demetrios (Aroniadkia) was an initial place of refuge for the inhabitants of the N part of the island who survived the sack of Paliochora. As a first step towards understanding this site a plan of the remains of Agios Demetrios was completed. Further work was carried out during this season on the pre- 20th Ct road network of the N part of the island. The most note- worthy discovery was made N of Potamos, where a stone built road was located. This runs along the flat land N of this major centre towards the coast, and then descends in a series of switch- backs in the direction of Agia Pelagia. Geological and GIS work, particularly on the modem cemeteries, also continued.' Antikythera To Vima (3/9/2003), Kathimerini (3/9/2003) and Apogevmatini tis Kyriakis (14/9/2003) note the results of excavations at the walled LCl-Hel site, identified as anc. Aigila. The site is 300 stremmata (30ha) in extent, its walls standing 5m high in places. Finds dating to the 4th to 1st Cts BC include iron spear and arrow heads and lead and stone balls (for slings). Four ECh/EByz (7th Ct AD) trench graves were found nearby. KORINTHIA (4th EPCA; 6th EBA) Isthmia. E. Gebhard (University of Illinois, Chicago/ASCSA) reports on the 2003 season of conservation and study: 'Notable discoveries include indications for the use of a crane/hoist in the Archaic temple and evidence for food prepa- ration (cooking vessels and grinders) and thus probably dining in the Hiera Nape (Sacred Glen) where dedications of the 4th Ct BC point to a shrine of Demeter at that period. The final disman- tling of the Palaimonion seems to have been completed almost a century after construction was begun on the Hexamilion across the Isthmus. Consolidation of the site and preparation of mate- rials for museum displays were carried on jointly with Alexander Mantis and Panaiyota Kassimi of the 4th EPCA. Archaic temple (F. Hemans, J. Stevens). Oscar Broneer interpreted the lines of post-holes cut into bedrock as receiving scaffolding for construction of the temple (Isthmia I, 7-11). Further analysis of the diameter, spacing and position relative to the walls of the temple makes it clear that they were not used for scaffolding but rather to help support cranes/hoists that were used to lift wall blocks into place. The idea finds support from the leveling of bedrock over an area three times the size of the structure. Such a space would have been used for delivery of stone and the operation of hoists. Cleaning operations uncov- ered a shallow, right-angled cutting that appears to be a bedding for piers placed against the walls at the NW comer of the cella. Thus, with two points accurately placed, the N wall can be restored with confidence. LAr, Cl and EHelpottery (M. Risser). Visual examination of cooking wares led to the identification of nine fabrics that are similar to 4th Ct and Hel wares from the Rachi Settlement but with fewer and smaller inclusions and a smoother surface. The greatest concentrations belong to the 4th Ct BC in the area of dining caves above the theatre and in a region W of the main temenos that has yielded dedications to Demeter. The similari- ty of shapes and date with cooking wares from the Rachi sup- ports Virginia Anderson-Stojanovic's suggestion that, with establishment of the settlement, an early shrine to Demeter on the Rachi was moved down to the Sanctuary of Poseidon. Dining would have played a prominent role in the cult, as it did in the Sanctuary of Demeter and Kore in Corinth, where simi- lar cooking wares have been found. Oscar Broneer (Isthmia II, 113-16) identified the area where the dedications were found with the Hiera Nape (Sacred Glen) mentioned as receiving a temple of Demeter in the 2nd Ct AD (IG IV.203.15-16). For the period ca 550-450 BC deposits with dining materials from the sanctuary of Poseidon yielded fewer cooking wares in compar- ison to fine drinking vessels.</page><page sequence="16">16 JAMES WHITLEY 23 Isthmia: Roman lamp Late Hel and Rom pottery (J. Hayes). An unusual oversized two-nozzled lamp was reconstructed from pieces previously unrelated, two of which appear in Isthmia III, nos. 2337, 2338 (Fig. 23). The ware seems closest to that of a Late Republican class noted in S Italy and Rome (Dressel's lamp type 1) and its long nozzles suggest a date around 120-70 BC Such a lamp implies other than everyday use, and may be evidence for minor cult activity during the pre-Rom abandonment period. Arms and armour (A. Jackson). Study focused on helmet fragments with perforated rims, weapons from the Rachi (with Virginia Anderson-Stojanovic), and iron weapons (with conser- vator Stella Bouzakis). Rachi Settlement (V. Anderson-Stojanovic). New research suggested that production of surplus oil in the settlement was linked to the endowment of oil for Isthmian athletes at the games. Description of the physical remains was completed. Palaimonion (E. Gebhard). Detailed analysis of the mason- ry makes it likely that the S building and curved entrance gate are contemporary with the enlargement of the shrine in phase III ca AD 100/120 instead of being later additions (as Broneer in Isthmia II, 104-06). The significant number of sherds and coins in destruction deposits belonging to the L 5th and 6th Cts points to completion of the dismantling of the shrine some time after construction of the trans-Isthmian wall, which is currently placed in the second decade of the 5th Ct (T. Gregory Isthmia V, 142). Faunal remains (D. Reese). Sacrificial and dining practices were investigated through completion of the analysis of fauna in the Great Circular Pit. In the Palaimonion the nature of the pyre on which the holocaustic sacrifice of a young bull was made and the pits in which the remains were found were con- sidered in relation to the logistics of such a holocaust. Worked Stone (I. Gotsov and assistants; C. Hayward). Tools for food production, floats for plastering Cl masonry, and frag- ments of five gaming boards are included in the study of stone from the sanctuary and a separate catalogue was prepared for the Rachi Settlement. Christopher Hayward is investigating the sources of the stone. On the basis of their context most of the 41 grinding stones and quems and the gaming boards from the sanctuary can be assigned to the period before 146 BC Four grinders from the Hiera Nape lend support to food preparation in the area (cf. Risser above). Site conservation and re-organization of the apotheke (F. Hemans, supervisor). Hemans installed new shelves and a new storage facility for inventoried ceramics and re-organized the conservation area. In response to a request from the 4th EPCA he cleared space for construction of a laboratory for research on the glass panels from Kenchreai. Digitalphotography (Chloe Wardropper). To increase acces- sibility for study, all un-inventoried metal objects are being photographed in digital format and entered in a database. This season 361 bronze and a few iron pieces were processed; con- tinuation is planned for 2004.' Tim Gregory (Ohio State/ASCSA) reports on study and conser- vation in July and September 2003 connected to the Rom baths of Isthmia: 'Fikret Yegul (University of California, Santa Barbara) com- pleted his manuscript on the architecture of the baths. Michael Mills (University of New Brunswick) completed the first draft of his study of the stamped tiles from the building. Karen Soteriou drew objects from the baths, mostly the Rom pottery. Timothy Gregory continued work on the stratigraphic history of the building. Panayiotis Elias continued his work on the con- servation of the monochrome mosaic in room VI of the Rom baths. During September of 2003 we cleaned and cut back the edge of the S part of the excavated area, in order to stabilize the earth and even out this line. This edge was excavated for a distance of 15.5m from the SE comer of the excavated area, toward the W. This operation cleaned out old trenches that had been exca- vated in 1976 and 1978 and evened the S edge of the excavated area, which has now been stabilized by construction of an unob- trusive dry-stone wall. In the E part of this area, on a line direct- ly S of the middle of room VII of the baths, the foundations of what was presumably the entry area of the baths were discov- ered, disturbed by a series of Byz pits. To the W of this a dump of material from the destruction of the baths was discovered, lying directly on the upper floor of the Cl bath (which was thus apparently exposed when the E end of the Rom baths col- lapsed). The robbed foundation trench of a large N-S wall was found to the W of this and along the S edge of the excavated area the N wall of a substantial Rom reservoir, presumably con- nected with the use of the Rom baths, or more likely its prede- cessor. A wall made of local dry stones was built along the E and S sides of the excavated area.' Kenchreai, Koutsongila. Professor J.L. Rife (ASCSA/ Macalester College) reports on the 2003 season of study and conservation of the ERom-ECh cemeteries here (Fig. 24) (see AR 2002-03, 17-18, fig. 30 on 2002 season): 'Field activities were dominated by the intensive documen- tation of all surface remains in the area of the cemetery and the initiation of a programme to study and conserve the wall-paint- ings in several tombs, under the direction of Alix Barbet (ENS- CNRS, Paris) and a team from the Centre d'etude des peintures murales romaines, Soissons. Major accomplishments included a more precise understanding of the topography and chronology of the cemetery, the discovery of evidence for funerary rituals, and the illumination of the content and condition of the wall- painting. Examination of the surface remains led to several important discoveries. The number of looted cist graves and subterranean chamber tombs now totals at least 48; two or three more tombs have been destroyed by cliff erosion as the coastline has changed dramatically since antiquity. Significant variation in the plan and design of the graves and tombs seems to represent either separate phases of use, social differentiation within the</page><page sequence="17">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2003-2004 17 local community, or both. Artefacts from the surface, from dis- turbed fills, or from undisturbed funerary contexts previously excavated by Americans (1969) and Greeks (1988-1990) include lamps, unguentaria, coarseware and fineware drinking vessels, coins, and fragmentary epitaphs. The drinking vessels occur throughout the chamber tombs, in loculi or in cist graves alongside corpses, or in large deposits outside tombs, perhaps debris from graveside banquets or commemorative rites. Prior excavations had also uncovered from one of the chamber tombs a movable stone altar with a circular top surface and acroteria, and a crude portrait bust. The chronology of this assemblage shows that the primary phase for the use of the chamber tombs was ERom (lst-3rd Ct AD), but the addition of numerous corpses and inscribed crosses to the chamber tombs point to their continued later use by Christians, a phenomenon widely noted in Rom tombs across Korinthia. The cist graves were used during at least two phases, ERom (1st Ct AD) and LRom or EByz (5th-7th Ct). We also documented the form and distribution of illicit dis- turbances and artificial features apart from burials. We located and recorded 253 discrete cuttings made by looters using both hand-tools and large machinery, an activity which continues to the present, as witnessed by an ERom tile-covered cist contain- ing six bulbous unguentaria opened early this summer. In addi- tion, we located and recorded 66 discrete features, mostly foun- dation cuttings in bedrock or the fragmentary remains of brick, ashlar, rubble, and poured concrete construction around the main burial zone. These remains reveal that the ridge was either fortified or settled during several (ras, including Ar-Cl, Rom, LByz-Ott-EMod, and 1 /od (WWII). Dr Barbet's study of the wall-p tinting in the chamber tombs involved the detailed visual inspec- tion and description, photography, and drawing of the well-preserved remains in three tombs (T4, T9, T20) and the poorly preserved remains in another (Ti). Stylistic analysis concentrating on the paint- ings in T4 is underway, but initial findings suggest parallels between the decorative motifs at Kenchreai and those at Corinth and Italian sites. Moreover, the examination of intact and collapsed plaster led to tOMAN several conclusions concerning methods of manu- METERY facture and the system for enclosing loculi for inhu- mation, probably using screens or grills. The French team also evaluated the structural and natural factors influencing the preservation of the wall-painting (geological matrix, humidity, fungal- and floraltur- bation) and drew up a plan for its total consolidation and permanent protection.' Eastern Korinthia Survey. Tim Gregory (Ohio State/ASCSA) and D. Pullen (Florida State/ASCSA) GULF report on the 2003 study season: 'The Eastern Korinthia Archaeological Survey completed fieldwork in 2002. Study of the artefacts continued in the museum in Kyra Vrysi. A major focus was the rationalization of the project data, and preliminary attempts to isolate areas of significant artefact densities in the areas previously surveyed. Members of the project also visited many of the LOCAs identified in previous years, among these Ano Vayia, Lakka Skoutara (near Sofiko), Ano Vayia, Kromna, and the fortresses on the summits o100w of Mt Oneion. At Lakka Skoutara, for example, we created a detailed map of the area, including the threshing-floors, cisterns, and early modem houses. At Ano Vayia we created a detailed plan and eleva- tion of a rectangular structure and a presumably associated round feature (tower or threshing floor), apparently of Ar or Cl date. We produced photographs of various features at Kromna, and completed a plan of the LC1 and/or Hel fortifications.' Athikia. Eleftheros Typos (26/11/2003) notes the recovery of finds, including Myc terracotta animal figurines and a Byz bronze jug, previously looted by archaiokapeloi in the area. Anc. Corinth. G. Sanders (ASCSA) reports on the 2003 exca- vation season in the Panayia field: 'Successive layers of the road bounding the three rooms to the E of the urban domus were removed, revealing a sewer line running N. The sewer was constructed and covered by large cut blocks and it underwent occasional modifications in the 2nd, 5th and 6th Cts AD, when new outflow lines were installed from adjacent properties. This involved digging tunnels under the sidewalk and road beds. Two of the tunnels were not backfilled and despite a measure of slumping in the superimposed layers did not collapse. Water supply lines were installed in the side- walk. Since Corinth water is so calcarious, these water pipes rapidly developed thick calcium carbonate deposits reducing the water flow. Frequent repairs and replacements were under- taken through the course of the 1St through 3rd Cts AD. These required attendant excavation and resurfacing of the sidewalk. As the depth of sidewalk and road bed fills grew deeper, the curb dividing the two had to elevated by extra courses of stones. Road and sidewalk beds above the 3rd Ct level were not preserved.</page><page sequence="18">18 JAMES WHITLEY Rom construction work, especially of the late 3rd and 4th Cts AD, cut back preceding phases severely. ERom, Hel and earli- er phases are represented only by features cut into 'stereo' such as graves, pits, foundations and cellars. Two large test cuts revealed the compact, pebbly red 'stereo' to contain small quan- tities of LNeo and EBA pottery and chipped stone. It complete- ly lacks cultural horizons and has every appearance of having been re-deposited from the S by natural agencies rather than being a huge filling operation. The material culture is further indication of the extent of early occupation in the area of Ancient Corinth. LNeo and EBA material is relatively plentiful on the flanks of Temple hill, Cheliotomylos, the gymnasium and the tile works. Immediately to the N of the EGeo grave found in 2002 under domus room All, now considered to date ca 900-875 BC, a second grave was revealed (2003-12). The grave measures 2.83 x 2.25m and its cut is preserved to a depth of 1.72m below the extant surface of the 'stereo'. It contained a massive monolith- ic sarcophagus of oolitic limestone measuring 1.88 x 1.23 x 0.85m with interior measurements of 1.42 x 0.88 x 0.62. It was fashioned using an adze, with a blade 8cm broad, by chopping down repeatedly on a vertical axis. The much decayed bones of the deceased indicate that the body was placed on its left side with the head to the S and legs retracted. Two small undecorat- ed lekythoi were found to the W of the head, an iron knife and an iron stylus with a bone handle were found to the E of the torso and the deceased wore bronze finger rings, one still in place on a finger of the left hand. After placement of the body the sarcophagus was covered by a cut slab 1.97 x 1.29 x 0.25m. The cover broke in the process and the cracks were repaired with white marl which was also used to seal gaps between the sarcophagus and the lid. A plain shallow bowl was found com- plete in the grave backfill at the N E comer and sherds which, when mended up, preserved two-thirds of an E ProtoGeo high- footed skyphos, came from the fill W N and E of the sarcopha- gus. The grave assemblage does not permit accurate dating of the grave other than it is approximately contemporary with, and perhaps slightly earlier than grave 2002-11. The juxtaposition of the two suggests that the location and orientation of the ear- lier monument was certainly known to the excavators of the later grave. The sarcophagus has thicker walls than that of grave 2002-11 and this may be an indication of an earlier stage of development. Sherds painted with concentric circles and possi- ble EGeo fragments in the grave fill suggest a date late in the 10th Ct or very early in the 9th Ct BC. The sarcophagi in these two graves are as large as even the largest later examples. Together the four LProtoGeo and EGeo Cor sarcophagi now known are perhaps the earliest known in the Greek world and they amply demonstrate an ability to adapt woodworking techniques to fashion stone. Although we have no evidence for the use of fashioned limestone for architectural purposes until the later 8th Ct the sarcophagi now mark the ori- gins of Cor stone working by ca 900 BC. At an estimated weight of 2.3 tonnes (2003-12) and 1.4 tonnes (2002-11) trans- port of the sarcophagi and their lids (1.2 and 0.8 tonnes respec- tively) represented considerable effort. Only small contexts of ProtoCor date were found in depres- sions in the stereo but Cor remnants were slightly more sub- stantial. Postholes of the period suggested no particular arrange- ment but a rectangular cutting 2.5 x 1.8 x 0.8m was backfilled in this period. The cutting was later bisected by a wall of the 4th Ct urban domus. Part of a Hel cistern, 2.3m w., was found at the N edge of room in the domus. All but the S 0.6m of this structure was destroyed by the late 3rd to 4th Ct construction of the stylobate of a colonnade flanking the long pool in domus room A16 and further by the robbing out of the stylobate in the 6th Ct. The upper portions of the cistern were cut back by Rom construction. A built subterranean room was found on the E side of the excavated area covered by the Rom road. This structure is rec- tangular, 2.00 x 1.56, preserved to a maximum depth of 1.62m, and built of dry stone walling. A series of five steps descends the E side from the NE corer and the floor is paved with large cobbles. The room was not a cistern since only the E wall and the SE corer are plastered, although the material used is the hydraulic variety used for cisterns. The fill of the cellar consist- ed of a mass of pottery including W Slope Ware, fragments of relief ('Megarian') bowls, cooking vessels and basins. The quantity of cooking ware lids in different sizes far surpasses the number of chytras and casseroles. The latter come in different sizes. The latest identifiable material suggests a date for the deposit ca 200 BC. There are indications that the cellar is part of a larger com- plex that apparently lies under unexcavated portions of the Rom road to the S and under the properties to the E and N. The cel- lar strongly resembles subterranean structures associated with buildings I and II N of the S stoa (Williams and Fisher 1972) also filled with quantities of pottery. These buildings dated to the second half of the 4th Ct BC and their function was thought to be public rather than private. The amounts of cooking lids and vessels suggest that the assemblage was designed more for public than for domestic dining. It is possible that here too was a building of similar function to buildings I and II. Some of the lids are distorted by firing but they were conceivably still func- tional. One of the small chytras was completely distorted and appears to be unusable. Without physical evidence for a kiln, one is reluctant to suggest the dump is waste from a potter's workshop on the strength of these few wasters. Resistivity survey undertaken by M. Boyd (BSA) and G. Sanders to reveal the course of the LRom city wall continued in fields at the base of Acrocorinth. The results showed that the S line of the wall followed the course proposed by Professor Timothy Gregory (Hesperia 48 (1979) 264-280) for only 300m before turning N. The LRom wall therefore appears to have excluded the Rom forum from its enceinte and to have been about one quarter of the size originally envisioned. Reconsideration of the evidence available now suggests that the wall was built in the mid-6th and not early 5th Ct AD.' Kleonai. A. Mantis (4th EPCA), J. Marchand and T. Mattern (DAI) report on excavation and study of the so-called temple of Athena in 2003: 'On a hill below the acropolis, with steep slopes on three sides, a terrace running E-W was found. The rather massive construction is supported to the E by a terracing wall. Foundation walls join the terracing wall towards the W. On top of the foundation walls stone slabs, measuring 0.9 x 1.2 x 0.3m, were preserved, joined to the foundation. The entire platform measured at least 15 x 31m. The building technique and shape of the mason's marks suggest a LAr date. The function of the structure is unclear to date, but a use as terracing for a sanctu- ary can be considered. Thus the terrace is one of the few Ar structures closely connecting architecture and landscape: the terrace presents a wide view of the surrounding countryside up to Acrocorinth, the terrace or the sanctuary situated here on the other hand was visible from afar. Continuation of the excava- tion in 2004 will provide further information on the structure. On top of the LAr structure was found a late antique foundation built from spoliae. This may have been a sacred structure of the L 5th Ct AD.'</page><page sequence="19">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2003-2004 19 Nemea. S. Miller (Califoria Berkeley/ASCSA) reports on the 2003 season of conservation and study at the sanctuary of Zeus: 'Final publications: Nemea III: The Coins, by Robert C. Knapp and John Mac Isaac is scheduled to appear in June, 2004. Work at Nemea this year focused on the preparation of Nemea IV: The Shrine of Opheltes, the Early Stadium, and the Hippodrome by Jorge Bravo and Barbara Rieger. It is hoped that the manuscript will be finished and ready for checking in the summer of 2004. A new and updated edition of Nemea: A Guide to the Museum and the Site is in press. Site: A significant discovery was made thanks to a record rainfall last winter. The Nemea River, which had been dug out in 1996 and 1997 to the width and depth of its ECh phase, was dug out again to improve drainage at the site and keep the sanc- tuary of Zeus from flooding. Flooding nonetheless took place. Our trenches to the W were totally filled when we arrived in May, and the deeper ones had not dried out by the time of our departure in August. The reason for this failure to drain the W part of the site into the river was clear: the long, N-S artificial mound constructed in the 6th Ct BC as a part of the Hero Shrine of Opheltes (see the report for 2002) was impenetrable and served as a dike. This was, it would seem, at least a part of the reason for its shape and location. It protected the core of the sanctuary, and it ensured that the area to the W became a flood plain (hence the many lay- ers of gravel discovered last year) suitable for the hippodrome. In other words, our colleagues at Olympia who have insisted that the Alpheios River had washed away the hippodrome may actually have been looking at the flood plain that formed the horse track. Work on the reconstruction of the temple of Zeus also con- tinued, with the help of Professor Nicos Makris. Professor Makris is a member of the Earthquake Engineering Research Center at Berkeley, and is especially interested in learning what the ancient Greeks knew about seismically sound construction. He is now preparing engineering reports preliminary to adding to the two new columns already re-erected.'

Elefiheros Typos (7/10/2003) reports an exhibition of this hoard of 312 LBA (1500-1400 BC) objects in the Nemea Museum. Nemea Valley Archaeological Project. J. Wright (Bryn Mawr/ASCSA) and E. Pappi (4th EPCA) report on work at Barnavos, anc. Nemea: 'The goal of research in 2003 was to test for evidence of chamber tombs on both sides of the ravine. On the W side, where a robbed chamber tomb was excavated in 2002 and where the property in which it is located had been purchased, three long trenches were excavated. On the E side the entire field E of the agricultural road was tested using ground pene- trating radar (GPR) and through two test trenches. All tests were negative for evidence of any archaeological remains. There is little probability of there being any other tombs in the immediate vicinity of the robbed tomb in EU 21. The only possible area was the E-facing slope on the E side of the ravine, facing the settlement on Tsoungiza. The single chamber tomb of LH IIIA2 date at Barnavos seems to be the only evidence of Myc activity in this area.' Kryoneri, Lechova cave. L. Kormazopoulou and Io. Zygouri (EPS) report in ADelt B Chron 52 (1997), 1177-78, on excava- tion here. Finds include some PH pottery; LAr-ECl Attic and Cor kotylai, pyxides, kraters and skyphoi. Also terracotta fig- urines, including representations of Pan and satyrs; lamps and some bronze clasps and finger-rings. Three inscribed sherds suggest the cave may have been a shrine to a nymph. ARGOLIS (4th EPCA; 5th EBA) Lerna. Professor M.H. Wiencke (ASCSA) reports on the 2003 study season, and on progress towards final publication: 'Elizabeth C. Banks sent her 740-page Lerna IV (Architecture and Stratification) manuscript to Professor Rutter and Dr Wiencke; she has since concentrated on her volume on the Neo settlements and small finds. Brice Erickson's work this year focused on Ar and Cl well deposits. The contents include a small percentage of Cor, Lakonian, Argive, and Attic figural and plain pottery and vast quantities of coarse and cooking wares. Imported amphoras, large concentrations of loomweights, and a ceramic beehive point to industrial activities. Lera at this time appears to have been a small village with several households. It may be possi- ble to relate well groups to different households. Michael Lindblom re-catalogued and re-bagged material from Lerna VI. The results are now available on CD-Roms. Dr Lindblom is impressed by the way the two shaft graves were excavated, with test trenches within the shafts and separate cleanings of the walls. Sherds have suffered from much han- dling over the years, especially the Matt Painted sherds; and some of the pottery from SG1 and SG2 has been mixed. David Reese reexamined the Lerna IV and V animal bones and most of those of Lerna II. He did a preliminary sorting and analysis also of the Lerna VI animal bones for Dr Lindblom's study. K.D. Vitelli completed the revision of her Lerna Neo pot- tery manuscript and submitted it to the ASCSA Publications office in December. Revision for publication will be completed by December 2004.Carol Zerer has continued to edit the man- uscript of Lerna V. This year she completed the account of the stratigraphy and the pottery catalogue of area DE. The Lerna apotheke in the Argos museum was completely re-organized, as required by the Nauplion Ephoreia. We were able to engage Nikolaos Liaros, highly recommended by Professor Vitelli and the ASCLS, to do this work with the help of several assistants and of Ms A. Banaka from the Ephoreia. All the pottery on the shelves and in the cupboards was recorded electronically by inventory number. A new cata- logue of the post-Mycenaean finds is now available on CD- Rom.' Argos. Dr Charalambos Kritzas (Epigraphical Museum, Athens) reports on an important discovery of Cl bronze inscribed plaques (pinakes), which will undoubtedly change our view of the institutions of Cl Argos (see also Investor World 5/10/2003): 'In late 2000 / early 2001, a rescue excavation of the 4th EPCA, under the direction of Dr Alkestis Papademetriou, took place in the small property of Evangelos Smymaios, on O. Korinthou 48, some 200m to the N of St Peter's square at Argos, and 900m NE of the theatre and agora. This area, until now, was thought to lie outside the city's walls. A modest structure, which appears to be an annexe to a sanc- tuary was discovered. It had probably been constructed in the second half of the 5th Ct BC and was abandoned towards the end of the 4th Ct BC. In this structure a series of stone 'chests'</page><page sequence="20">20 JAMES WHITLEY 25 Argos: stone chest with big terracotta and bronze vases were found in a row, buried in the floor and (those found intact) covered with huge stone slabs (Fig. 25). Some of them had been emptied in antiquity, but four contained an estimated 120 to 150 inscribed bronze plaques (Fig. 26). The poor condition of these plaques, many of which were fused by corrosion, required considerable conservation work at the Epigraphical Museum of Athens. Many of the plaques were perforated so that they could be stored in bunches. The size of the plaques varies; some are strips 15-30cm 1. and 3-5cm w., others are larger rectangular or trapezoid shapes 15 x 30cm or more. So far some 65 plaques have been cleaned and studied. On palaeographic grounds the majority of the plaques could be dated to the 2nd half of the 5th Ct BC, but internal evidence points to a dating in the first decades of the 4th Ct BC, with the exception of some plaques, which could perhaps belong to the third quarter of the 4th Ct. All the inscriptions are of financial nature, accounts that seem to relate to the treasury of goddess Pallas (Athena). They provide important information about Argive institutions and identify administrative responsibilities concerning the goddess and the city. In all cases, the texts record sums of money either as deposits or withdrawals to or from the goddess. The transac- tions are made by civic or religious bodies, some of which were previously unattested. More than 600 persons are recorded to have taken part in the transactions. The provenance of the money deposited is not always specified, but in most cases it must come from the income of public and sacred lands or from interest on money lent. In other cases it comes from fines, from the selling of confiscated properties or from booty of war. The purpose of the withdrawals, when specified, is mostly for financing the athletic games and the festival of Hera, for serv- ing various needs of the state, or for the construction of public works. In some cases the money is destined to finance the war at Corinthia, which took place between 394 and 386 BC, or 26 Argos: inscribed bronze plaque other military purposes. It is certain that, according to a well- known model, the sanctuary of Pallas, the main goddess ofArgos, played the role of central bank to serve various needs of the state. A preliminary report on the plaques by Ch. Kritzas will be published in the Proceedings of the Symposium on 100 years of archaeological activities at Argos 'Sur les pas de W. Vollgraff', organized by the EFA and the 4th EPCA (25 Sept. 2003). An article on the unattested or rare personal names of the plaques by the same epigraphist is in press in the Proceedings of the Symposium 'Nommer les hommes' (EFA, Dec. 2002).' Karmoyiannis plot ('agora necropolis'). L. Hapiot (EFA/Paris Sorbonne) reports on anthropological and paleodontological study of skeletons of 'historical' date from this plot, excavated by Anna Pariente in 1990, 1998, 1999 and 2000. Analysis of the skeletons noted the degree of conservation, dimensions, evi- dence of degenerative illnesses (many cases of arthritis of vary- ing degrees were observed), and anatomical variations, includ- ing deformities, and injuries. Nannopoulos plot. A. Pariente (Lyon/EFA) and Ch. Piteros (4th EPCA) report on work undertaken in collaboration with the 4th EPCA here in 2003: 'The area of investigation, which is situated in Od6s Theatrou, was occupied by a marble atelier up to the destruction of the building in 1999. The principal purpose of this project is to complete the cleaning of the public area in order to open the site to visitors. More generally, it seeks to contribute to the uni- fication of the archaeological sites of Argos and the eventual of re-evaluation of the agora of Argos. Following the removal by mechanical excavator of the layers of landfill, and the clear- ing of modem detritus, the excavation focused on the N half of the plot. Four trenches were dug, following the division of the site into squares by the EFA on the agora site (AL 79, AL 80, AM 79 and AM 80). In the central-W part of the plot (AN 79 and AO 80) the upper archaeological layers, particularly the layer of the huge 'agora necropolis' have been irredeemably damaged by the presence of two masonry basins. Structures partially unearthed on the nearby Karmoyannis plot allow us to suppose that the Nannopoulos plot contains (from N to S) the continuation of krepis K, the continuation of the central basis of the Ar (?) structure 0, and the continuation of the concreted floor and of the bench of this structure itself. Excavation inside the ancient house concentrated on unearthing structures and identifying strata connected with workshop activities. The following characteristic features were revealed in this area: (a) a wall constructed of large pebbles without mortar or binder, oriented N-S (trial-trenches AL 80 and AM 80) lies on top of an extremely compact gravel floor, while along the N limit of the gravel soil itself (AL 80) the same wall lies on a layer datable to the 6th Ct AD (EByz); (b) a trench filled with brown earth, which has yielded a consider- able amount of dross or slag as well which is modem, has been identified in the N part of AL 79 as well as in the N-W comer of AL 80, and could have been dug in the earlier disturbed layer mentioned above. The gravel soil noted above (in AM 79, the N half of AM 80, the SE part of AL 79 and NE of AL 80) has been interpreted as a street surface, oriented NE and 4.5m w.</page><page sequence="21">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2003-2004 21 Preliminary study of the remains of the external wall of the Nannopoulos building, which is located in the W border of the plot, has allowed us to recognize the two distinct parts of this building (already visible above ground) at ground level. We also documented the existence of two types of masonry in the stone base of the external wall, the junction between them observed at the level of the N berm of AN 79. The two types are (a) rub- ble embedded with mortar (employed in the S part of the wall and the partition wall, which returns in an easterly direction) and (b) pebbles without mortar (used for the construction of the N area of this structure and for the internal walls). Even if the differences indicate two distinct building phases, it remains impossible to determine their relative chronological sequences. Further cleaning of krepis K and the central basis of struc- ture O allowed us to confirm the sharp chronological division (already identified in previous excavations) between the inter- nal zone of the building to which this krepis belonged and the area of the Geo centre of structure 0, which had been reshaped, one or more times, in a late epoch. To the N of the krepis (in AL 79), three strips of soil rested on many layers mixed with splinters of poros, which suggest a ECh context. The strips covered the following: (a) a structure (lm 1. x ca 30cm w.) associated with LGeo pottery; (b) a strip of crushed poros splinters in the centre of the trial trench, at level 10,97; (c) a block of carefully cut poros in the NE comer of the trial and sinking in line with the external wall of the workshop. The flat layers of orange earth mixed with poros splinters confirm that Geo strata are only found in the internal area of the 'porch' (which is markedly different from the soil of the remaining areas). We have still to determine if these strata are in situ or not. Near the N side of the poros foundations of the krepis, a layer of pale grey-brown earth, mixed with an amalgam of splinters of limestone and poros, probably indicates the disintegration of the krepis blocks. At the level of the central base of structure O a number of indications suggest that this structure has been modified: (a) The limestone euthynteria was interrupted by blocks of well-cut poros (smaller than those previously mentioned); this arrange- ment enters into the area of the Nannopoulos plot. (b) In the N berm of AM 79 a curious device comprising two amphora necks was found. This (LRom) device crowned a small structure over- hanging the facade (made from one block of limestone) of the krepis. (c) In AM 79, the modem surface layer was covered with a layer of debris ca 30cm thick which contained many ani- mal bones tentatively dated to the 6th Ct AD. This layer rested on a further layer of light brown earth, which yielded abundant destruction material. At level 10,81 the top of the central base appeared; the fill, datable to a second phase of modification, consists of broken fragments of architectural elements (column shafts - non fluted in marble, fluted in plastered poros; Cor capitals). These fragments testify to a violent occurrence and probably indicate a willingness to destroy proximate buildings: should they be related to the rampages of Alaric? What is the relation between these acts of vandalism and the destruction of the exe- dra building (also dated to the 5th-6th Ct AD) of the S part of the Karamoyannis plot? In the S part of AM 79, (S of a strip of soil) the debris layer yielded huge quantities of animal bones and tile fragments, mixed in with a few sherds from the end of the 6th Ct and other ceramics, mostly datable to the 5th and 6th Cts. In 2003 excava- tion work ceased at the bottom of a semicircular trench into which the layer just mentioned entered. At the S limit of the base (in AN 79, S of the triglyph- metopes-block of the Cl altar) under a layer rich in fragments of columns shafts and other broken architectural elements, we found the usual layer of dark brown debris composed of car- bonized wood and other abundant debris. Excavations stopped on a paler layer, mixed with fine gravel and small stones. In the berm (N of AO 79) and under a grey-brown layer rich in debris, we unearthed the S fagade of the central base which was found to be coated in hydraulic cement. We also found the concreted floor of theatron-basin O.' Terracottas. M.F Billot (EFA) made a further study of the Ar fragments from the agora excavations. There seem to be many points of comparison between the Argive series and those from Lousoi (in Arcadia). Many pieces from Lousoi could be classed as Argive in terms of type and manufacture. Mycenae. To Vima (29/7/2003; 2/8/2003) and Ta Nea (29/7/2003) report on the opening of the new Museum, which has three rooms and holds finds (1680 in all) from Greek and British excavations at the site, transferred from the Nauplion museum. The finds from Schliemann's excavations however remain in the National Museum in Athens. Sp. Iakovidis (ASA) reports on excavations in 2003 in two locations (Ergon 2003, 26-9). On the acropolis, between com- plex BA and room A, a mixed stratum of Myc and Hel sherds was reached. Beneath this stratum was a half- destroyed structure, the foundation trenches for room A and a Myc deposit including a pithos. Work also contin- ued at Petsa's house. Another comer of the large building was found, whose extent is still not known. Excavation of the large circular hole (a well?) in room II was completed. Finds from here include fragments of wall paintings (Fig. 27) and LH IIIA2 pottery, includ- ing a rhyton (Fig. 28). The Mycenae Survey is now pub- lished: S.E. Iakovidis, E.B.

K. Demako- poulou reports for the Greek (4th EPCA) excavations: 'The Greek excavations were conducted in the SW part of the acropolis N of the west gate. Furthermore the cleaning and the investigation of the Cyclopean ramp, identified in the 2002 season outside the E Gate of the acropolis, continued intensive- ly as a joint effort by both the Greek and the Swedish teams. The work of this season provided more information concerning the construction and the line of the ramp. The work of the Greek team concentrated on an extensive plateau on the SW slope of the acropolis, where a large space was excavated in previous seasons. Parts of two buildings were found constructed one beside the other and defined to the NW by a long wide road. The excavation in 2003 brought to light part of a third building opposite them on the other side of the road, and more rooms associated with the SW of the two buildings. Of the new building, a large rectangular room and small part of another were uncovered. Neither room is very well preserved and their walls are mostly damaged. The large room has a wide doorway at its SE side leading to the road. The floor of the room was of trodden earth. Two stone slabs found in the middle of the room were probably used as column bases. At the NE side there is a bench made of large and small stones. In front of the bench the neck of a large linear jug, was found, with the handle and part of the shoulder. On the floor of the room many pithos frag- ments were found, as well as abundant LH IIIB2 pottery, of which some fragments of group A deep bowls are worthy of mention. Many small fragments of painted plaster were recov- ered, as well as two rounded pieces of lead -probably lead bun ingots to be used as raw material; the large one bears traces of cutting. Of the bronze objects found, notable are a needle, an awl and a fibula of violin-bow type. Other finds include terra- cotta human and animal figurines and relief beads of glass. Investigation was extended outside the room to the SW, where no structural remains were discovered. Fragmentary pottery was recovered, mostly of LH IIIB2 date. The most important finds from this space, however, are the fragments of a large lead vessel and the head of a terracotta wheelmade female figure with painted decoration and preserved height of 4cm (Fig. 29). Excavation brought to light three more rooms which belong to the SW building. They are built next to each other on a SE/SW axis. They are spacious, rectangular rooms, all of rough- ly the same dimensions. The first room preserves only its S part, with two walls forming a comer. Of the abundant LH IIIB2 pot- tery recovered from the floor deposit, quite a few vases were partly restored, including a rosette bowl, a plain high-stemmed conical kylix and a coarse bridge-spouted krater. The second room was much better preserved, with well built walls and a floor of trodden earth. On this floor a number of broken vases and other vase fragments of LH IIIB2 date were found, such as a ring-based krater decorated with tricurved-arch (Fig. 30), two handmade miniature hydrias, a jug with linear decoration, a small stirrup jar and other fragmentary storage and cooking ves- sels. From the same floor deposit a great quantity of carbonized figs was recovered, as well as olive stones and grain, fragments of painted plaster and two stone pounders. The third room was not so well preserved: its walls are very damaged and its interi- or was full of stones fallen from the collapsed parts of the walls. For this reason the floor level of the room has not yet been reached. However, the deposit above this level was rich in LH IIIB2 pottery, including many fragments of deep bowls, of which worthy of mention are a large fragment of a group A deep bowl decorated with quirk pattern, fragments of group B deep bowls, decorated with scale pattern and triglyphs, a fragmentary stemmed-bowl, as well as many fragments of coarse ware stor- age and cooking vessels. A large fragment of a millstone was also found. Some interesting finds were recovered from the upper layers of the rooms. These are a lentoid sealstone of black steatite depicting an animal, two well-preserved bronze arrow- heads, one pointed and the other leaf-shaped, a fragmentary ter- racotta figurine, which could be interpreted as a rider or a char- iot driver, and some sherds with pictorial decoration showing birds and an animal. From all excavated areas quite a few pieces of mother-of- pearl were recovered; some of them seem to be finished and may well have been used as decorative inlays. Many unworked pieces of semiprecious stone were also found, such as rock- crystal, agate and fluorite. The numerous pieces of these stones and the mother-of-pearl inlays and fragments strongly suggest the existence of specialized workshops operating on the acro- polis of Midea.' Ann-Louise Schallin reports for the Swedish excavations in the E part of the east gate sector: 'Outside the East gate, trench 4 with extensions and clean- ings, this season's work consisted of extended excavations over most of the gate plateau and intensive cleaning over the slopes immediately below. Further, the lower terrace was cleaned from bushes and surface growth. The main objective this season was to thoroughly investigate the ramp line set out by the large</page><page sequence="23">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2003-2004 23 boulders in the original trench 4, and thus to support the sup- posed layout and direction of the ramp structure. Another aim was to clean a greater extent of the slopes and lower terrace below the immediate gate area. Excavation in the area of trench 4 with extensions uncovered a stone packing, consisting of fairly large boulders, 20-40 cm in size. In trench 4C an upper stone packing was observed. It served to level the area above the large stone packing. A two-tiered structure of somewhat larger stones appeared along the W ramp line. It seems highly probable that this is the continuation of the W ramp face. This part of the face consists of smaller stones, possibly more apt for filling up the gaps in the line between several bedrock outcropping. No real stratification could be discerned. The soil was gritty with many smaller stones but poor in (principally MH and LH) pottery, consider- ing the amount of soil removed. Ar and LRom sherds indicate later activity in the area. Interpretation. Work this season has provided further infor- mation concerning the construction of the ramp leading up to the east gate, the supposed main gate to the acropolis of Midea. It now seems that this large stone packing was aimed at filling out the ground between the many bedrock outcroppings to cre- ate a preliminary level ground. Excavation in trench 4D shows that this level was then covered, at least in parts, with a packing of smaller stones forming a pavement of some sort, probably with a layer of soil between and perhaps above. The upper stone packing could thus have continued (and it seems likely that it did) over the whole area, which since its assemblage has been subject to strong eroding forces. The line of the ramp is now clear as it extends from the boul- ders in the original trench 4, gently curving in a NE direction. This direction seems clear along a length of approximately 10m from the citadel wall. Two possibilities remain: that the road, after the first and now evident ramp line, forked W towards the citadel wall along the lower terrace, and downwards from there; or, that it instead turned E towards an area which today is char- acterized by a large number of bedrock outcroppings. This year's work inside the East gate of Midea was con- centrated on two different areas within the gateway and the inner entrance of the gate. Some stones were removed and the soil in between was cleared away at the E side of the east gate entrance, directly S of the threshold. The result of this cleaning indicates that the stones had fallen from the E entrance wall dur- ing a post-Myc destruction phase. Trench 11 was opened at the W inner citadel wall, ca 2.50m from the east gate entrance. The main goal of work in this trench is to investigate the inner gate area close to the entrance, particularly the phase connected with the construction of the east gate. Three distinct layers were recognized. The third layer can be characterized as the same clay floor excavated last year within the gateway (in trench 7). The LH floor level seems undisturbed. East of the East gate. Excavation of trench 3 on the upper plateau continued. In between and below stones and large boul- ders were pottery fragments from both pithoi and vessels of fine ware, including a monochrome deep bowl (Fig. 31) that appear to have been stored in the room. In the NE comer was a quem and a number of hand stones were collected in the area.' Tiryns. J. Maran (DAI/Heidelberg) reports on the 2003 season: 'A final excavation campaign was carried out at the N gate of the lower citadel. Furthermore, a sounding was opened at the foot of the N tip of the fortification wall, in order to clarify the situation at the blocked lower entrance of the sloping N passage discovered in 2002. The excavation led to the surprising con- clusion that in the N part of the lower citadel a fundamental 31 Midea: monochrome deep bowl change in architectural planning occurred from the earlier sub- phase of LH IIIB2 (LH IIIB Developed) to the later (LH IIIB Final). It was ascertained that the whole architectural configu- ration consisting of the N gate and the buildings to the S of it (buildings XI and XV) was created during a hitherto unknown L phase of rebuilding in LH IIIB Final. Originally, at the time of the construction of the Cyclopean wall in LH IIIB Developed, none of these structures existed and the N passage was intended to be the only link to the N lower town. During the use of this passage the zone immediately to the SW of its upper entrance was covered by supporting walls which belong to a system of terracing already noticed in other areas of the lower citadel. In our excavation there were no traces of houses con- temporary with these supporting walls. Beneath room 78c of building XI a massive rectangular stone platform (min. 1. 3.80m, w. 2.9-3m) appeared; this is slightly later than the supporting walls, but still dates to LH IIIB Developed (Fig. 32). The platform stands obliquely to the inner side of the fortification and shows on its N and S side set faces, while the core consists of a stone fill. To the W the platform 32 Tiryns: stone platform</page><page sequence="24">24 JAMES WHITLEY ends on a slightly lower level in a step-like, narrow extension which reaches almost to the fortification wall. In 1982, K. Kilian found a similar stone platform only 10m to the S (AA 1988, 114; fig. 15). Both structures have in common that they date to LH IIIB Developed, are built in a similar way and are situated near the inner side of the fortification. In the case of the newly-discovered platform, the date of the construction can be narrowed down to the time immediately preceding the building programme at the beginning of LH IIIB Final. It may be, there- fore, that these structures served as foundations of wooden plat- forms, on which lifting devices and other technical means used in the partial rebuilding of the cyclopean wall were placed. In LH IIIB Final the initial architectural plan was abandoned and substituted by a new arrangement. In order to fill a cavity in front of the upper entrance of the N passage, and to create an approximately horizontal building surface, a layer of earth and stones was spread along the inner side of the fortification. At the same time parts of the Cyclopean wall in this area underwent a reconstruction, during which the N gate was added. Thereafter, the old N passage was used only for drainage. For this purpose a narrow water outlet was left open in the stone fill blocking the former lower entrance, while the upper entrance of the passage was almost closed by the earth fill and by inserting the head of a canal passing through the N room of building XI. The replacement of the N passage by the N gate points to an upgrading of the connection between the N lower town and the lower citadel. Whereas the N passage, due to its form and dimensions, could be used mainly as a sally-port and at most as an inconvenient exit, the relatively wide N gate running hori- zontally through the fortification facilitated significantly the access to the citadel. The change of plan and the decision against the N passage show that such a sally-port was regarded as unnecessary. This in turn contradicts the notion that the pro- gramme of rebuilding was triggered by a crisis, and rather points to quite stable political circumstances shortly before the all-out destruction at the end of LH IIIB. In addition, the proof of a very late date for the N gate within the palatial period may also explain why this gate lacks a proper system of access from the outside: the gate may simply not have been entirely finished when the catastrophe occurred. New insights into the period after the destruction were gained by the investigation of the W part of the large pit with skeletons discovered in 2002 and assigned to phase 1 of LH IIIC. Again, three skeletons without any grave offerings came to light, which raises the minimum number of individuals in this pit to six. The pit was not only cut into the ruin of building XI, but also into the E part of the earlier stone platform. All three newly-discovered burials, one of which is that of a child, were aligned along a W-E axis, either in an extended or in a crouched position. Two of the burials were so placed inside the pit to allow the reuse of stones of the earlier platform as a substruc- ture for stone enclosures. In one case a skeleton was surround- ed by a cist-like stone construction which integrated parts of the stone platform. Remarkably, the preserved part of the stone cov- ering of this construction exhibits a rudimentary technique of corbel vaulting. Among the many burials found over the last 50 years in the lower citadel, this pit represents a special case, inasmuch as six individuals were buried closely together. The find resembles especially the groups of burials without grave furnishings found since the 1960s in different places on the N lower citadel. The burials uncovered in 2003 emphasize that in spite of the lack of grave furnishings, the dead were not buried haphazardly. Only after a thorough anthropological analysis may we gain addi- tional clues concerning the causes of death and the reasons underlying the deposition of these burials.' Kandia Mesolithic Survey. Curtis Runnels (ASCSA/Boston) and Eleni Panagopoulou (EPS) report: 'A survey of Mes sites was conducted in the Kandia region of the N Argolid. Our model predicted that the location of Mes sites was determined by a preference for coastal locations in the E Holocene to exploit the abundant marine and riverine resources available in embayments, estuaries, lagoons, and river valleys. Sites were predicted to be in caves and rockshelters in river valleys near the coast. The Kandia region was selected for survey because this area was close to the sea in the E Holocene. In the Mes, sea level rose rapidly from a depth of ca 52m at 10,500 BP to a depth of 6m at 6000 BP. This rise, approximate- ly 30-32m during the Mes, inundated the coastal plain of the Argolic Gulf and pushed the shoreline landward. Mes sites in Kandia were expected to be no more than 2-6km from the coast. To find these sites, a survey was carried out by a team of six, searching mainly caves and rockshelters in a region of ca 30km2. Four areas were selected: the Kandia valley, the Bay of Drepanon in the vicinity of Vivari, the inland valley of Marathia, and the Palamidi-Karathona coast S of Nauplion. We examined all likely caves or rockshelters, but caves were not inspected if they were too high above the valley floor to be reached safely, were filled with breakdown or exposed bedrock, or the surface was obstructed by sheepfolds, dense vegetation, or buildings. We collected all PH artefacts. Where artefacts were very numerous, duplicates of undiagnostic debris were discarded. We examined the surface inside and in front of caves and shelters where we expected to find artefacts exposed by erosion or other disturbance. Sites with uneroded archaeologi- cal layers or deposits may not have been recognized. For prac- tical reasons it was possible to examine only areas accessible from roads, and some remote or difficult to reach areas in the interior were not searched. One inland valley, Marathia, was examined and evidence of Mes activity was discovered. Inland valleys at elevations greater than 120m asl and more than 4km from the sea were not investigated. The discovery of Mes arte- facts at almost every coastal cave site confirmed our hypothesis of extensive Mes activity in this region. Twenty-one sites were recorded (tables 1-2): 15 are Mes, three are of unknown age, and three are MPal to E Upper Pal. TABLE 1.

Although a handful of artefacts of MPal to E Upper Pal type were found at some Mes sites, three sites had only Pal artefacts. Of the 1713 artefacts collected, the majority (94%) are typologically and technologically Mes. Upper Pal artefacts of gravettian and Epigravettian type are completely absent. Lithics of Neo, BA, and historical periods, which are well known in this area, are rare. A handful of L Med sherds was noted at two or three sites. The Kandia Mes assem- blages are similar to the Mes assemblages from Klisoura cave near Argos and Franchthi cave in the S Argolid, which are dominated by microlithic flakes and retouched tools. Most sites are represented by small numbers of artefacts, typically fewer than 75 pieces. Of the 1713 artefacts collected, 1048 came from just one location in the Kandia valley where two sites, Adami 2 and Adami 3, are separated by less than 100m. The distribution of Mes sites preserves part of a fossil Mes landscape with the occupation of shallow caves and rockshelters at low elevations within 2-4km of the E Holocene shoreline. There was a prefer- ence for caves with S-facing mouths overlooking valleys and coastal plains. Several sites are located near outcrops of flint. No open-air Mes sites were identified, although the large size of the topographic study area may have biased our results. The Kandia valley had the largest number of Mes sites. The valley provided a convenient passage for people and animals from the coast to the interior. Local faulting of the limestone, downcutting by the Yiannakakis River, and an abundance of springs created many good rockshelters and caves with S expo- sures here. These are also found in side valleys that open into the main valley and connect Kandia with the interior uplands. Side valleys funnelled animals into predictable locations, making ambushes possible as animals moved between the interior and the coastal plain for grazing. The caves and rockshelters in the Kandia valley are ideally placed to provide access to the decidu- ous oak and pine forest on the hillslopes that provided forage and cover for game, wood for fuel and tools, and acorns for food. The caves are spaced about lkm apart, and the site farthest from the sea was no more than a one or two hour walk away. Mes sites were also found in Vivari, which overlooks the Drepanon Bay. Flint was available at Vivari and in Marathiai. Vivari is also a natural passage between Kandia and Asine. Farther to the W, Karathona is an enclosed unit unconnected with the interior or higher elevations. The three sites here had few artefacts. The Palamidi area has good caves and one site, Palamidi 1, demonstrates that some of these caves were occu- pied in the Mes. The Kandia Mes assemblages have small flakes and formal typological tools such as end scrapers, notches, denticulates, combination tools (with two or more retouched edges), backed blades (usually microlithic bladelets), atypical and geo- metric microliths, and flakes with marginal retouch. The assemblages are classified as Lower to Upper Mes. Final Mes (in Franchthi terms) was no identified. The sites were probably occupied throughout the Mes, ca 9000 to 10,500 BP. The number and types of lithics are mn the same at all sites, and in the absence of features, ithic non-lithic artefacts, and organic remains, it is not pos- in sible to distinguish the different activities that took ithic place on these sites. One site, Adami 2, a rockshelter in In the Kandia valley, has a large surface assemblage with ithic a number of cores and flintknapping debitage. It appears to be a base camp. The remaining sites in the survey area are probably special-activity sites or sea- sonally-occupied sites. We presume that the sites in the Kandia valley were part of the territory of a single band or group of foragers, but it is not possible to say if the sites in Vivari, Karathona, and Palamidi were connected with the Kandia base camp or if there might be other base camps in the region. The Kandia sites were evidently not occupied or exploited in the Upper Pal but were first occupied by Mes foragers. All of the sites in the survey area were abandoned before the begin- ning of the Neo. A pressing question about the origins of the Neo in Greece has been whether Neo communities were estab- lished in the Mes or whether they emerged from native Mes societies that developed agricultural techniques independently of farmers in Anatolia and the Near East. Interpretations are complicated by a lack of research, and it is an open question whether Mes sites are rare in Greece or have simply not been detected in surveys and excavations. The Kandia survey con- firms that Mes sites are present and can be discovered by cur- rent survey methods, and our site-preference model is useful for constructing research designs for the detection of Mes sites in parts of Greece where similar environmental conditions were found in the E Holocene. The Argolid supported a relatively large and successful native population in the Mes, but our data do not support the hypothesis of an independent development of the Neo from Mes communities. Lower Mes foragers with a culture very different from the Upper Pal made use of previ- ously unoccupied sites in the Kandia area, supporting the hypothesis that Mes foragers may have been part of the demic diffusion that brought later Neo farmers to Greece. Equally sig- nificant is the abandonment of the Mes sites at the end of the period. Neo sites in the Argolid are found elsewhere, and there is no evidence for continuity from the Mes to the Neo in Kandia. Thus the Mes foragers were gone before the arrival of the Neo farmers who succeeded them.' Epidauros, sanctuary of Asklepios. To Vima (29/5/2003) and Kathimerini (29/5/2003) note that cleaning and restoration of the 2nd Ct AD Rom building equipped with (cultic?) wash- basins, identified by Kavvadias in 1892 at the stoa of Kotys, seems also to have served as a small shrine of the Egyptian gods, Osiris, Isis and [H]arpokrates. To Vima and Ta Nea (9/05/2003) note restoration and conservation of the stadium. M.F. Billot (EFA) continued her study of the terracottas from the Sanctuaries of Asklepios and of Apollo Maleatas. All the decorative elements from the sanctuary of Apollo Maleatas have been studied. All the tiles of Cor type conserved in the old storeroom near the Museum have also been cleaned, numbered and classified. Many of them have also been photographed. In a general way, evidence of a unity of decoration style between the two sanctuaries has continued to increase. From that the synchronism of the building programmes is possible to be derived.</page><page sequence="26">26 JAMES WHITLEY 33 Megalopolis: 'fish's well' Anc. Epidauros, town. Apogevmatini (18/1/2004) notes restoration work in the small C1 (4th Ct BC) theatre. Halieis. James A. Dengate (ASCSA) reports on the 2003 season of study and survey: 'Work continues on the series The Excavations at Ancient Halieis to be published by Indiana University Press. The first volume to be completed, Bradley A. Ault, The Houses: The Organization and Use of Domestic Space, (Halieis 2), Marian H.

Some chapters for Halieis 1, The Acropolis and Upper Town, have been completed; the target date for publication is now spring 2005. In April 2003, at the request of the 4th EPCA, a complete cleaning of the Halieis storerooms (Leonardou Storage building in Nauplion and at Porto Cheli), including a reordering, and recording of the materials therein, was undertaken. Nikos Liaros reorganized the entire collection and created an electron- ic database (Microsoft Office-Excel) that lists all the storage boxes by location and describes their contents. CDs and hard copies of this database were given to the 4th EPCA and to the ASCSA. In May 2003, Bradley Ault (ASCSA) and Michael Boyd (BSA) conducted a day of magnetometry survey in the lower town of Halieis. Analysis of the results is in progress.'

Fors6n and B. Fors6n, The Asea Valley Survey. An Arcadian Mountain Valley from the Paleolithic Period until Modern Times. Swedish Institute at Athens Series 4, 51 (Stockholm, Paul Astr6ms F6rlag, 2003). Megalopolis. Hans Lauter (DAI/ Marburg) and A. Panayiotopoulou (5th EPCA) report on work in 2003 in the agora: 'The season concentrated on measuring and drawing the building remains. Stone by stone plans in the scale 1:25 were completed for the Stoa of Philip, for the Government building ('demosia oikia') on the W side of the market place and for the excavated parts of the so called Archeia E of the Philippeios (T. Mattem, P. Becker, V. Grieb). Supplementary, limited cleaning in the pillar peristyle of the Government building led to the dis- covery of the original drainage system of the courtyard. It con- sisted of only one rather narrow channel in the middle of the W side, which evidently soon proved to be insufficient for its pur- pose; this explains the otherwise strange, partial and irregular cobble paving of the SW peristyle as an additional and makeshift measure (see e.g. AntW 33, 2002, 380 fig. 6). Special attention was also paid to the study of certain pieces of small elaborate architecture ('Kleinarchitekturen') in the wider con- text of the peristyle and the adjacent sanctuary of Zeus. One of them is the extensively plundered platform and stomion of the 'fish's well', which takes its name from a stonemason's mark (Fig. 33). This once formed an integral part of the portico con- struction dating from ca 350 BC and was destroyed with it in the sack of Megalopolis by Kleomenes of Sparta in 222 BC. The eschara in the sanctuary of Zeus was covered with earth for temporary protection. Based on the large-scale detail plans, a new general plan of the whole agora site was outlined (Fig. 34). Another main objective of the 2003 season was to continue with the documentation, identification and examination of the Cl to Hel architectural members which have survived without their original building context, and some of which offer an extraordinary interest because of their peculiar, non-canonical forms. Special mention will be made here, however, only of the Stoa of Aristodamos (E side of the agora), since everything of its architecture above the foundations seemed altogether lost until the beginning of our investigations. But again in 2003 it was possible to attribute successfully a great number of scat- tered or reused elements to this large, apparently two-storied, portico of 262-252 BC which underwent a thorough rebuilding process, presumably as a result of the destruction of 222 BC, during the first half of the 2nd Ct BC There is nonetheless still not enough material to provide a clear picture of the first phase, which was built of a light, travertine-like stone. The colonnades of the second phase were of a hard, white limestone breccia with few veins; the column drums and the capitals of this restoration show different stages of unfinished workmanship. Column shafts, oval in section, which were rescued in 1996 from an Ot structure ('Spolienbau') in the centre of the Agora, could belong to the upper storey of this second building.' LAKONIA (5th EPCA; 5th EBA) Pellana. The decision by KAS (Central Archaeological Council) not to allow further excavation at this site, claimed by its excavator, Th. Spyropoulos (AR 2002-03, 28) as the 'Palace of Menelaus', has caused great controversy (To Vima 23/10/2003; 24/10/2003; 19/11/2003; Eleftheros Typos 17/10/2003; 30/10/2003; 23/3/2004; Ta Nea 3/11/2003, Ethnos 24/10/2003, Eleftherotypia 24/10/2003).

Both wheelmade and handmade cooking vessels were found in the same contexts, a fact which has major implications for the argument that handmade cooking pots are related to Slavic influence.' Kouphovouno. C. Mee (BSA/Liverpool), W.G. Cavanagh (BSA/Nottingham) and J. Renard (EFA/Clermont Ferrand) report on the third (2003) season of excavations: 'Areas B, C and G were extended further to the W and a new area (area H) was opened to the S of B and to the E of G. This gives us the potential to link the excavation of all three areas should that prove appropriate. Furthermore a deep sound- ing (2 x 2m) was opened in area C, located to incorporate the core taken in 1999, which had revealed archaeological deposits to a depth of 2.6m above the natural sediments. In all the exten- sions and in the new sounding undisturbed archaeological lev- els were reached very close below the shallow plough zone. In area B wall fragments, post holes and post pads were dif- ficult to reconstruct into an architectural whole, though they may be from a lean-to, and a thin lens of dark and organic soil with much pottery could have marked its floor. A deposit with a quantity of large animal bones could be butchery debris, and with evidence of milling activity in the E of the trench, suggests that during LNeo/Final Neo the area was largely dominated by the processing of foodstuffs and was possibly divided up into specific functional areas. Two burial features, of MH date, were discovered in the S part of the 2003 excavations. Each consist- ed of a rectangular pit orientated ENE-WSW with a ring of stones marking its edges. One contained a burial crouched on its right, the other had two levels, the upper with remains from two disturbed skeletons, the lower, better preserved, contained a crouched burial accompanied by a MH kantharos (Fig. 35). The extension of area C aimed to clarify the MNeo architec- tural complexes by opening up the excavation.

Within the first building there was a small rectangular structure associated with the 'area of food preparation' found in 2002. Fills with much burnt clay, pottery and carbonized seed remains may indicate levelling dat- ing to the end of the MNeo period. The E part of the building was destroyed by a large EH pit (-2m in diameter and I m deep), which was packed with medium to very large stones, pot- tery clearly dating to EH II, animal bones and used stone tools. The deep sounding, measuring 2 x 2m, is being excavated to investigate the 2.6m of stratigraphy indicated by the 1999 core taken here. By the end of the 2003 season, the sounding had been taken down 1.06m (ca 1.3m from the surface as the topmost levels had been excavated in 2002). A sequence of burnt mud-brick features, sediments and dumps with car- bonized remains as well as some architectural features (post- holes and wall foundations), eventually overlay a massive, hard yellow clay mud-brick construction which came to fill much of the 2 x 2m trial. The sounding has produced an important strati- graphic sequence with abundant MNeo pottery (Fig. 36) and rich environmental remains. Area G has also produced deposits important for under- standing the cultural sequence, including a stone-filled pit with EH I pottery (Fig. 37), and a sequence of deposits spanning much of the LNeo. Wall foundations and floors of LNeo build- ings were also uncovered. It is intended to extend the excava- tion in future years to get a fuller picture of the LNeo architec- ture in this part of the site. The original aim in opening area H was to establish whether the EH material found nearby in trench A, and indicated in this general vicinity by the surface survey of 1999, was also present here. Excavation has shown this not to be the case. A number of burials thought to be MH were found but there was no evidence for any EBA settlement or structures, though some EH II pot- tery was discovered in a number of contexts, probably residual material included in with the MH burials. The four burials thought to be MH cut into features which were probably Nco. Two burials were discovered at a lower level than these contexts suggesting they might be earlier. The programme of complementary studies intensified in 2003. All contexts were sampled for physical and chemical analysis of sediments (under Peter James), sieved as a control on recovery, and water sieved (under Amy Bogaard) for envi- ronmental remains. Much progress has also been made with the study of chipped-stone artefacts (Anna Karabatsoli) and pottery (Christopher Mee).' 38 Geraki: 'duck askos' Geraki (anc. Geronthrai). J. Crouwel and M. Prent (Amsterdam/ Netherlands Institute) reports on the 2003 season: 'In the summer campaign of 2003, systematic excavations continued in the NW part of the summit of the acropolis. An area of ca 160m2 was newly opened up, while some excavation was also carried out in the trenches/rooms dug earlier. The Hel street previously explored was traced further eastwards, and the W, NW as well as the E perimeters of the Hel building in area I were clarified. A small part of a new Hel building and a street were also identified in the E corner of the site. The excavation produced several more votive objects, including terracotta miniature pots, figurines, bone and bronze pins and parts of metal vessels. Most of these come from mixed fills that served as foundation layers for the latest, Hel to ERom settlement. As to the PH periods, the W continuation of the EH II defensive wall was found; it was noted that it still (partially) stood into LA/ECI times. Some additional work was done in the EH 11 casemate room. From this storage area we retrieved more sherds of a so-called duck askos, other parts of which had been found in 2000-2001 (Fig. 38; Inv. 1696/SF 2), and more burnt sealing fragments. Elsewhere, a depression in the bedrock yielded an interest- ing collection of Final Neo, EH II and a little MH and Cl-Hel pottery. In the newly discovered street, a thick deposit was encountered, consisting mainly of Hel street wash in the upper levels and of a fill with much EH II and especially MH sherds in the lower levels. Finally, work on the programme of wall consolidation was continued.' Gytheion, Lakonia. E. Papagopoulou, P. Karkanas, E. Kotza- mbopoulou, K. Charvati and G. Tsartsidou (EPS) report in ADelt B Chron 52 (1997), 1174-76, on excavation in a complex of rockshelters, 3km NE of Gytheio, on the E slopes of Selinitsa. Excavation reached a maximum depth of 8m through deposits dating from the Upper Pleistocene through the Holocenc. Finds include MPal Levallois flake tools, made from many types of stone. Tools in dark flint and quartz are relatively uncommon. Other finds include jaws and teeth from deer and bovids, and traces of fire, possibly from 'hearths'. Samples were taken for dating by ESR, C14, U/Th and OSL techniques, results of which will be forthcoming from the Dcmokritos lab. Areopolis, Kalamakia cave. A. Darlas (EPS) and Henry de Lumley (French Museum of Natural History) report (ADelt, 1182-84) on the 1997 season of excavation (for later seasons, see AR 2002-03, 33). Finds include MPal (Moustcrian) Levallois cores and flake tools, some of flint, others of andesite. Bones include those of Capra ibex, Dama dama and wild boar (Suis scofra), and possibly also of bovids (bison?). One human (Neanderthal?) tooth was also found.</page><page sequence="29">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2003-2004 29 MESSENIA (7th EPCA; 5th EBA) Anc. Messene. P. Themelis (ASA) reports on the 2003 excavation season (Ergon 2003, 30-47) in var- ious locations in this Hel/Rom city: 'The full extent of the Hel/Rom theatre is now revealed (Fig. 39). Points of interest are: small gates in the W retaining wall; stone steps in the outer wall; I limestone seats; the drain for the orchestra and, from the orchestra area, the base for a statue of a Messenian philosopher (2nd/3rd Ct AD, unfortunately without its statue) inscribed: H noko;/ Tt(peptov) ()Xkptov [...]/ Kpca'c, rppoa, / Xocpov, veov, nH[a]T'ova, ap?Tq; t/orI/G ?V?K?CV. The N retaining wall for the spring/fountain of Arsinoe was cleared. To the S, at the sanctuary of Sarapis and Isis, a series of rooms and an under- ground stoa were revealed. One of these rooms was used as a dump in late antiquity, and from this deposit household pottery and numerous fragments of Rom statues were recovered, including a Hadrianic (2nd Ct AD) example of Perseus holding the head of Medusa (Fig. 40) which may be a copy or version of the famous bronze statue by Myron (Pausanias 1.23, 7; see AR 2002-03, 34). Another Hadrianic statue, of Isis suckling the infant Horus, (Fig. 41) confirms the identification of this complex. The narthex of the ECh basilica (7th-8th Ct AD) was cleared. Built from spolia from both the theatre and the sanctuary of Isis, this remained in use until the 14th Ct AD. Further investigation of the temple of Zeus Soter revealed three inscriptions. The first (Fig. 42) was on three sides of a base which supported the central akroterion on the short E side of the temple, and reads: Aooqapov Otiinio[u] K o) to [] K 0 / [] Kpcorlpto acv?[0rlKav Atd, / O]ot T? riacut Kat [toc] / noEXt. It therefore reveals that the famous Messenian sculptor Damophon and his sons dedi- cated the akroteria. The best parallel for this inscription is the (much earlier, but 'Messenian') inscribed Cl base for the Nike 40 Messene: fragments of statue of Perseus and Medu 39 Messene: theatre of Paionios of Mende at Olympia (Dittenberger, Inschriften von Olympia no. 259), which also refers to akroteria on a temple of Zeus. Two further complete inscriptions, found on the N side of the temple, are Hel (2nd Ct BC) arbitration documents in the form of stelai detailing the judgements of three Messenian arbi- trators at (respectively) Smyrna and Demetrias in Magnesia. 41 Messene: Hadrianic statue, Isis suckling Horus</page><page sequence="30">30 JAMES WHITLEY I ^ /W _ ,AB 1^ &gt; 4- ^S^ an PVII,l ~c.?- ..7.- ?

The hall thus clearly forms the centre of a Rom villa, whose insula is surrounded on all sides by streets (Fig. 43). In the street to the W a further (Rom?) inscribed base served as a dedication to Eileithuia by an (unnamed) woman of three small marble statues of her grandsons, Damophon, [Xenoti]mos and Damalis, by her daugher Isodamida and her son-in- law Xenophilos. In the sanctuary of the Hero, a (headless) Hel marble statue of Eros was found. Further cleaning and restoration took place at the Arcadian gate. At a point 300m NW of the sanctu- ary of Artemis Limnatis, on the steep slopes of Mt Ithome, another small sanctuary (first investigated in 1989) was explored. This consists of a small (Hel?) Ionic tetrastyle temple (5.45 x 5.15m) outside of which was a rich votive deposit. This comprises numerous large terracottas, of bulls, horses, sileni and women, some holding pigs, some bearing hydrias. This has led to the interpretation of the shrine as a sanctuary of Eileithuia (To Vima 14/9/2003), the altar of which has not yet been found. Ta Nea (10/9/2003) reports the find of a head of Cybele, from a sanctuary of Cybele. To Vima (25/9/2003) announces that the heroon of Saithides is to be restored.

Davis and S. Stocker (ASCSA/Cincinnati) report on the 2003 study season on finds from Blegen's excavations: 'P. Halstead and V. Isaakidou note that the faunal assemblages they examined in 2003 were over- whelmingly dominated by sheep and pigs, with goats, cattle, dogs and wild animals occurring in smaller numbers; they observe that, for the most part, these relative frequencies are consistent with the Linear B record, although the abundance of pig is a clear and recurrent discrepancy. J. Davis and S. Stocker made considerable progress in examining the archaeological contexts from which faunal remains were retained by Blegen's team, concentrat- ing on an extensive deposit of 11th CtAD pottery and glass from the NE gateway. Miniature kylikes found inside the Palace of Nestor at the time of its destruc- tion were also re-examined. Those found in the throne room and in room 7 near the large deposit of burnt cattle bones are the only examples from the Palace of Nestor that are actually burnt. Examination of human remains was completed by L. Schepartz and S. Miller-Antonio in a fifth season. Study this year concentrated on bones from the Vayenas grave circle and the Kokkevis chamber tombs. From the grave circle a minimum of 28 and a maximum of 31 individuals were provisionally iden- tified.

Pylos (mod. Town), Phrourio. D. Kazianis (EMA) reports in ADelt B Chron 52 (1997), 1196-7, on limited excavation under- taken in advance of conservation and restoration work in this castle. ELEIA (7th EPCA; 6th EBA) Eleftherotypia (29/1/2004) summarizes recent finds from the region, not all of them entirely new. These are: At Epitalio a Rom kiln; at Koryfi a Myc settlement, with two deposits containing tools and pithoi; at Skyllountia a tem- ple of Athena surrounded by a C1 (4th Ct BC) cemetery; at Platiana a walled acropolis and an anc. theatre; at Alipheira a temple of Athena; at Phigaleia a 4km 1. wall surrounding the sanctuaries of Zeus Soter and Athena; at Samiko an anc. (Cl?) 'hypaethral' structure, a stoa and cistern; and at Lepreo the E sector of the (Cl-Hel?) defensive wall with two towers and a cistern, l1 m in diameter. Olympia. W. Niemeier (DAI) reports on the 2003 season of excavation and study: 'The excavations of the foundation NE of the temple of Zeus, which had been termed 'building 7' by D6rpfeld, were completed; the excavations started in 2002 under the direction of H. Kyrieleis in cooperation with J. Rambach. As the apse of the building overlies a wall of the EH settlement, building 7 has to be later in date, but an exact stratigraphic date is not available because of disturbance caused by earlier excavations. According to the excavator, the general development of the sanctuary suggests a construction of the building in the EIA. The theory that the building might be a monumental apsidal building could not be substantiated. The incomplete plan prob- ably has to be reconstructed as an oval house. Conservation work conducted by the Greek service on the mosaics preserved in the area of the excavation necessitated examinations in the Rom building N of the prytaneion. Soundings in the NE annexe were conducted by C. Leypold (Wiirzburg) and C. Schauer (Austrian Institute) as part of a research project on 'Olympia during the imperial period and late antiquity' directed by U. Sinn (Wiirzburg). A square basin was cleared in the centre of the area. Its use is dated to the 2nd Ct AD. Remains of a Hel bath were found on a lower level. Two 44 Olympia: bath tubs tubs for seated baths (Fig. 44), complete with the typical basins for drawing water were discovered in a round room (5.75m di.) which had a pebble floor. They apparently belong to a larger ensemble with nine more tubs to be expected in the E part of the room, which has not yet been excavated. W of the large round room there is a heating channel on top of which the remains of two water basins have been preserved. In the S there are traces of the foundation walls of a second, smaller round room which probably served as a sweating bath (Laconicum). According to stratigraphy the structure is to be dated to the middle of the 2nd Ct BC; this newly-found bath is therefore a link between the first baths with subterranean heating from the early 3rd Ct BC and the perfection of heating systems in the st Ct BC In the area of the festival street S of the temple of Zeus, K. Herrmann studied the foundation remains of the so-called wall of the Herulians which had been discovered by the ephorate in the previous season. However, the wall contained nothing of note apart from some column drums and parts of the entablature of the Leonidaion. Surprisingly, a statue base was found in a pit while clearing the foundation in front of and S of the altis wall (Fig. 45). The base, made from shell-limestone, is 0.91 x 0.53 x 0.35m and holds the base of a two-thirds life-size bronze statue of which only the right foot and the heel of the left foot are pre- served; the right foot is set forward (Fig. 46). The bronze base carries a two line inscription specifying that the statue was a votive from the loot of the Byzantines and was made by the for- merly unknown artist Pelanidas from Aigina. According to the character of the letters, this is a LAr votive to be dated to the end of the 6th or the beginning of the 5th Ct BC. As the statue must have been buried at the latest in the 4th Ct during the con- struction of the altis wall, it cannot have been mentioned by Pausanias. Probably this was one of the statues which had to be removed when the temple of Zeus was built. Further examina- tion of the pit showed it to be a simple open well, constructed for the spectators of the games. Similar wells are known from the stadium and the SE area. Underneath the base, contained in the fill of the hole, were found further bronzes, such as a well preserved Cor helmet and a miniature greave. On the floor of the well shaft (5.30m d.) were found fragments of a number of jugs which, once restored, may aid the dating of the well. Two restoration projects were continued under the direction of K. Herrmann, H. van de L6cht and K. Zambas. Reconstruc- tion of the column N 12 of the temple of Zeus has progressed up to the eighth drum. In addition, the remaining original drums were reconstructed and replacement material was purchased for</page><page sequence="32">32 JAMES WHITLEY 45 Olympia: statue base as found 46 Olympia: statue base righted the two missing pieces. The partial reconstruction of the foun- dation of the Philippeion (see Eleftherotypia 16/3/2004) with artificial stone was completed. Following that, the preserved and reconstructed marble steps of the lower two tiers were put in place. As only one each of the shell-lime ashlars which were set behind the marble steps was preserved, the remainder were reconstructed from stone quarried in Didymoteicho in N Greece.' Anc. Olympia is of course of paramount relevance to the 2004 Athens Olympic Games, and has made the site particular- ly controversial this year. The Greek press has commented on a number of issues; the refusal by KAS to allow the ancient sta- dium to be used for 'shot put' events at the 2004 Olympics (To Vima 31/10/2003); whether the programme of conservation and restoration will be finished by August 2004 (Ethnos and Eleftherotypia 15/7/2003); and whether the 'Doryphorus' from Messene should be transferred to the proposed new 'museum of the Olympic Games' at Olympia (To Vima and Eleftherotypia 31/10/2003).

Ladstatter (Austrian Institute) reports on the 2003 season of excavations: 'Work concentrated on the Solon plot, a terrace immediately in the N below the acropolis, focusing on the banquet-house, the W building and a geological survey. The public function of the banquet-house is demonstrated by the andron with 11 klinae, the bath with four tubs for seated baths and the lack of an oikos. The results of excavations so far suggest a mid-4th Ct BC building date, with a number of subse- quent phases of use until abandonment in the LHel period. Study in 2003 concentrated on the SW part of the building where a concentration of walls, use levels and disturbances in a comparatively small space (8 x 4m) provide detailed informa- tion on the building sequence. The central building (18 x 15m) of the LC1 foundation peri- od includes a flight of rooms for maintenance purposes to the S, and heating and water regulating installations for the bath to the SW. A water reservoir identified in 2002 was examined in its entirety. The rectangular shaft was lined with lime mortar and is disturbed by the S wall of the room with the basin which was constructed later; consequently, the original N end of the shaft is lost. The reservoir (1.3 by at least 1.3m; 1.45m d.) could hold at least 2.45m2 of water and provided for the adjacent bath room. The finds comprised broken roof tiles, fragmented cook- ing pots and fine pottery and suggest the filling-in of the reser- voir in the LHel period. A number of foundation walls indicate the continuation of this part of the building towards the E. During the 3rd Ct BC and after the taking down of its prede- cessor, a rectangular room (4 x 2.5m) with a levelling stratum of hard clay and small pebbles and a well was constructed in the E of the reservoir. Apart from chronologically indicative Hel pottery and tile fragments, the fill contained an intact male clay figurine dating to the LGeo-EAr period. The round well (1.2m di.) is sunk into the levelling strata and the local red loam and was originally dug to a depth of only 1.4m. The fill contained tightly-packed fragments of Hel Lakonian roof tiles above large pieces of conglomerate stone, followed by a hard layer of clay with some roof tile fragments and small stones. This layer con- tained few small fragments of household pottery, a clay model of an altar and a feline creature and fragments of a Cor terra- cotta sima. The entire depth of the well is estimated to be 10m, so the finds excavated to date cannot yet indicate the date of abandonment and filling in of the shaft. The bath with four tubs was abandoned at the end of the 3rd Ct BC and a smaller room with only one tub was built in the area of the maintenance rooms. This led to the partial covering</page><page sequence="33">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2003-2004 33 of the cistern and destruction of the walls of the well room, while the well itself continued in use. If the sequence of events of the SW area can be applied to the entire building, its history was the following: the publicly- used banquet house from the middle of the 4th Ct BC underwent major architectural changes in the 3rd Ct. The large bath room with four tubs was replaced by a smaller room with only one tub. This suggests decreased use and possibly a change from public to private use for the house. The reconstruction is relat- ed to the enlargement of the building by including the S flight of rooms. The building was abandoned at the end of the Hel period or the E imperial period. W of the banquet house, separated from it by a NS street, is the W building, where excavations in 2003 in the SE area revealed a rectangular room (2.5 by at least 2.5m), the walls of which contained numerous spoliae. The conglomerate bedrock was levelled for the construction of the walls while the slope towards the N was filled with a levelling deposit. The fill, which had been partly excavated in 2002, was examined down to bedrock and proved to be a closed context. Finds included frag- ments of pithoi and amphoras, household and cooking ware, black-glaze shapes such as skyphoi, kantharoi, phialae, plates and terracotta lamps of the 3rd Ct BC. Furthermore there were fragments of Hel Lakonian tiles and fragments of painted ridge tiles of LAr/ECl date which are clearly different from the con- temporaneous roof identified in excavations on the acropolis. The fragments consequently suggest a presently unknown building of this period. There are as yet no indications relating to the plan and function of the W building. The examined part was constructed not before the 3rd Ct BC and shows later changes. The geological survey continued, examining the hydro-geo- logical conditions for wells on the so-called terrace of Solon. The profile at the W end of the plateau shows an 8m thick stra- tum of conglomerate over a layer of waterproof marl. The con- glomerate, which is furrowed with water-bearing cracks, slopes down to the E in the direction of the well. The well's location was well chosen. The well, which is the first one found in the area of the city, is of particular importance on the basis of previous examina- tions of the water supply of Aigeira. The Hel lower town was situated on waterproof layers of marl which are unsuitable for the construction of wells. Consequently the lower town is pro- vided with water by a Hel system of channels by which water is conducted into the city over a distance of 1.5km, partly below ground, from a spring in the S. The settlement on the Solon ter- race, which is situated some 40m above this channel system, therefore used the conglomerate spur of the acropolis which retained water above the marl. The water could be accessed by the digging of wells. Study of finds concentrated on material from the completed excavations on the acropolis and comprised the LMyc find complexes and a smaller complex of Geo and Ar bronze finds.' Lousoi. V. Mitsopoulos-Leon (Austrian Institute) reports on the 2002 and 2003 seasons of excavation: 'Work concentrated in the so-called stadio area (1km SW of the sanctuary of Artemis and 600m SW of the settlement remains of the Phoumoi area), which rises in three successive levels from the bottom of the high plateau of Sudena towards the E (Fig. 47). Excavations continued in the area of the stoa at the bottom of the valley and included soundings to identify the foundations of the building and to explore the open space to the E of the building. The entire foundation of the stoa (65.29 x 12.05m and ori- entated roughly N/S) has been preserved, as well as the bottom tier on the width and the E length and three orthostate blocks of the wall at the SE corner. The bottom tier of the E front, which was excavated in nine sec- tions, suggests an open colonnade with closed lateral wings. Over a foundation of ashlars there is a layer of square slabs (1 x lm) held together by iron clamps cast in lead. The surface of the slabs shows a regular system of cuttings and dowel holes. From these the stylobate of the colonnade can be reconstructed as a system of evenly sized isodomic stone slabs. No slabs of the stylobate have been preserved; the presence of iron clamps cast on lead however suggest that the construction of the layer was completed. At its S and N ends and the short ends, the bot- tom tier was constructed in a different manner. The square stone slabs (1 x lm) were finished only to a width of 0.50m, there are no vertical dowels and only few clamps. On the other hand there are cuttings for lifting and channel-like grooves in the sur- face, which remained unfinished. The preserved blocks at the SE corer suggest the reconstruction of a closed wall made from orthostate blocks. The interior of the hall was divided into a central room with two naves and two closed wings to the N and S. Individual foundations were found for the interior colonnade along the centre of the building, consisting of limestone slabs at a dis- tance of 4.50m. The foundation of a wall running EW divides a closed, almost square area (9 x 10.90m), off from the central naves. This area is divided into two rooms (5 and 4.50 x 9m) by a wall running NS, in line with the central row of columns. Also, at the N end there seems to have been a closed wing, as indicated by the foundation of a wall running EW; here, the room was slightly larger (12.50 x 10.90m). In contrast to the S wing, the N room had two interior supports in line with the cen- tral row of columns of the central naves; the limestone founda- tion of the S support could be identified. As the dividing walls of the wings correspond exactly with the transition from the colonnade to the orthostates on the E front, and as they are also in line with the distances between the interior supports, the following planning system can be deduced. On the basis of the intercolumniations of the exterior and interior colonnades (2.25 and 4.50m), the length of the hall was 28 intercolumniations, with a width of 5 intercolumnia- tions. The wings follow the same pattern in that the S wing measures two, the N wing three intercolumniations. The appear- ance of the front is dominated by the open colonnade and the closed wings. It is remarkable that the colonnade with 17 recon- structed columns amounts to less than two-thirds of the length of the building. In the interior, a long rectangular room with two naves and eight reconstructed interior supports, is combined with two closed rooms of differing layout. In the N there is a large room with two interior supports, while the S wing is divid- ed into two smaller rooms. Even though the function of the rooms cannot be gleaned from the excavation results, the diverging plans of the wings suggests differences in use. The period before the building of the hall is until now repre- sented only by a pit in the SW. In connection with the building of the hall, two layers of fill levelling the area could be identi- fied. The foundation trenches to both sides of the bottom tier of the E front contained, among the limestone chips from the working of the slabs, the fragments of an EHel cup of probably local production and sherds of black-glaze pottery. The finds from the fills connected with the building of the stoa therefore indicate a Pre- to EHel date and date the building itself to the EHel period. A trial trench in line with the stoa suggests the existence of a hard clay floor covering the open space to the E. Further to the S, immediately to the E of the hall, a shallow rectangular pit (4 x 4.20m or more) was cut and its floor paved with tile fragments. The pit was dug after the abandonment of</page><page sequence="34">34 JAMES WHITLEY 47 Lousoi: plan | ., -0 o&gt;, + 0 o -o 3 t*,c : ?? irr,, i''?'* I?1?. ? , . ,, ,, } ! | 'i- " ! t I . t i5,^wt' l I ' 4 0 c , + - . .... t.. . 1:.</page><page sequence="35">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2003-2004 35 the stoa. In almost all fills preceding and succeeding the stoa the presence of pottery workshops is indicated by firing supports, clay slag and fragments of kiln lining. The pit may have served as basin for the purification of clay. On a higher level, 80m to the E of the hall, the foundations of a peripteral temple were excavated. The temple was identi- fied in 2001 during cleaning activities (Fig. 48) and two preparatory soundings were made in 2002 along the axis of the S peristasis and the transverse axis of the building. In 2003 the W half of the sekos was excavated and the section in places extended to the E. The entire foundation of the building and parts of the floor have probably been preserved, facilitating a comparatively clear interpretation of the plan. For the peristasis, large limestone slabs, which were laid over a foundation of ashlars, placed at a regular distance of 2.90m indicate six columns along the width and at least 14 columns along the length of the building. The exterior meas- urements of the temple were at least 15.70 x 39m. The E end is unknown for the time being, due to the large amount of fill on the E end; more columns might have been located here. The sekos, with an interior width of 7.9m, is aligned exactly with the second and fifth column of the width. In the W there is a transverse room 2.8m d., followed to the E by an almost square room (7.9 x 7.7m) which is divided into three naves by two rows of three columns each. This is indicated by the six limestone slabs on top of the ashlar foundation. Also the next room to the E, which has been investigated over a length of 6.5m only, is divided into three naves by two rows of columns; accordingly, two limestone slabs were excavated to the S and one to the N. Abutting the W wall of this room aligned with the longitudinal axis was found a limestone block which probably represents the substructure of the base of the cult statue. Consequently, the sekos with three naves was divided into a rectangular cella opening towards a pronaos in the E. To the W of the cella, and separated by a wall, there was the square six- column-hall which was entered from the W through the opisthodom. Pottery fragments from the lower strata in the N pteron which are related to the construction of the foundation of the sekos and the placing of the limestone slabs supporting the columns suggest a date in the LAr period, as does the plan of the temple itself. In the S pteron, in line with the eighth column, five bronze tablets were found in 2002. Four of these were intact, one was corroded. In 2003 a heavily corroded iron tablet was excavated, inscribed with proxenia decrees in the Arcadian alphabet, dat- ing over the entire 5th Ct. BC. Even though Lousoi is mentioned as the city to grant these honours, there is no information about the cult or the sanctuary. In the cella, the floor of square clay slabs has been pre- served. The raised borders on the edges of the underside suggest an origin of the slabs in the Hel period. In the vicinity of a lime- stone slab placed on the clay slabs immediately in front of the statue base, two lamps of Broneer type XVI were found. Therefore the cella appears to have been in use at least until the LHel period. If the current interpretation of the temple plan with a two- part sekos and without adyton should prove correct, it has to be noted that the peripteral temple resembles the LAr temple of Apollo at Corinth much more closely than other temples in Arcadia. The situation of Lousoi in the contact zone of N Arcadia between Arcadia and the N coast of the Peloponnese therefore becomes apparent once again. The temple has to be interpreted as the polis sanctuary of the city of Lousoi even though the identity of the deity is still unclear. The monumental form of the public centre with a stoa on the other hand was not completed until the EHel period. 48 Lousoi: peripteral temple In 2003 wall remains visible on the surface of terrace I were cleaned; these were situated to the E of the stoa and to the W of the temple. A rectangular building (8.25 x 5.75m) preserves the greater part of the foundation and a layer of orthostates with blocks that were probably spoliae. Some blocks tumbled down the NW slope belong to the same building; 2.8m to the S there is a wall made from small irregular blocks of limestone which has no apparent relation to the rectangular building. The exact alignment of the building with the EW axis of the peripteral temple suggests that the building was part of the polis sanctu- ary. If the blocks used in its construction are indeed spoliae this would suggest a connection with the Hel phase of the temple. The geological survey continued in 2002, mapping the topography of ancient Lousoi and the surrounding mountains, examining the stones used in the building of the sanctuary and localising possible quarries. The classification of building mate- rial from the temple of Artemis, the stoa and the peripteral tem- ple and subsequent comparison with the local geology shows that the various types of limestone and poros were quarried locally. Corresponding quarries were found without however identifying traces of activity in antiquity. The marble used in the building of the temple of Artemis is not native to the valley of Lousoi. Parallel to the ongoing excavations, material from complet- ed excavations was studied and documented. The examination of the votive figures from the sanctuary of Artemis was contin- ued. In 2003 the study of the roofs found in the sanctuary of Artemis and in the settlement at Phoumoi was started.' 'Gremoulias' (Chelmos) Kalavryton. G. Ladstatter (Austrian Institute) and G. Alexopoulou (7th EPCA) report on a short sur- vey conducted in 2003: 'G. Alexopoulou located ancient remains on the ridge (1200m asl) located 3km to the E of Kalavryta and 7km to the NE of anc. Lousoi. The remains suggest monumental building activity and present the starting point for archaeological exam- ination which was initiated with the measuring of the area and mapping and documentation of the building remains. To the N of a terrace running EW (60 x 25m) which is delim- ited to the E and W by rising ground, to the N by a cliff and to the S by a downward slope, a foundation (6m 1.) orientated E/W was located. The foundation was made from regularly-worked blocks of local conglomerate stone. In addition, numerous dis- carded architectural elements were examined on the terrace and the S slope. An almost intact Doric geison (Fig. 49) made from poros (1 x 0.81 x 0.34m) suggests a pre-Hel Doric building with an intercolumniation of 2.50m. In addition, fragmented archi- tectural elements of non-local marble were found which had</page><page sequence="36">36 JAMES WHITLEY city wall. In the deeper horizons, below levels of Rom date, well-built foundations for mud brick constructions, indicated as red clay structures, were uncovered. Material from floor levels indicate that the constructions must derive from the 5th Ct BC. On the S slope of the mound where the sanctuary for Artemis Lauria was positioned, excavation of the so-called bouleuterion (in fact almost certainly a theatre) was continued from previ- ous years. A larger part of the orchestra has now been cleared, showing it to be a rectangle of ca 16 x 14m (Fig. 50). A paro- dos on the W part was further excavated this year and so was a construction first traced in 2002; in 2003 it was unambiguously shown that this belonged to a stage with a proscenion in front. The positions of six columns were clearly indicated on a plinth, and in one instance the stucco covering of one of these columns was found in situ. Two fragmentarily-preserved capitals in Ionian order were found in the f1llings, and two well-preserved capitals from the proscenion building were identif1ed in the Museum of Agrinion. Finds in the area around the stage clearly indicate that the f1nal phase belongs to the Hel period, while the dating of earlier phases is still not certain. It has thus been shown beyond any doubt that the building, at least in its f1nal phase, was a theatre. In the area inside the west gate of the town, where the sacred way from the sanctuary of Artemis Lauria ends, excavations were initiated in order to detect the position of the Kalydonian Mint. The building selected is the biggest one in the area, placed along the central street in this part of the town. The town plan is preliminarily known from the geomagnetic surveys conduct- ed during 2001 and 2002. At the N long side a stone-built stair- case connected the building with the by-street N of the house. Parallel to the N wall, a row of square pillars with superstruc- ture of mud bricks were found, and a plinth showing the posi- tion of columns seems to indicate that a square structure had existed in the central part of the building. These preliminary considerations need further investigation. A room placed in the corner between the main street and the N by-street was also excavated, yiedling, among other interesting f1nds, two f1gures of Pentelic marble, a goddess (35cm h.) with a 'crown' of tow- ers (Fig. 51) placed close to a seated lion (55cm h.). There were also a preserved Herm and two large terracotta sculptures, a sundial and many lamps and coins. Stamped Cor tiles showed that the roof came from the work shop of Bargathis.

Papapostolou T:iiqs (ASA) reports on the 2003 season of excavation (Ergon 2003, 50-1). Investigations concentrated on 49 Gremoulias: Doric geison smoothed fronts and anathyrosis and lifting holes on the joining sides. Architectural elements made from local limestone and poros were also found, comprising small fragments of fluted Doric columns. The foundation and the architectural elements suggest the existence of a large (sacred?) structure of Doric order on the ter- race. Possibly this was a sanctuary which was related to the road system connecting the plain of Kalavryta with Achaia via the high plateaus of the Chelos mountains.' AITOLIA-AKARNANIA (6th EPCA; 8th EBA) Kalydon. S. Dietz (Danish Institute), L. Kolonas and I Moschos (6th EPCA) report on the 2003 season of excavation, conducted in the following areas: 'In the S part of the central acropolis, excavation of walls from succeeding occupations during the Ar, C1, Hel and Rom periods was continued from 2002. The excavation of the Ar/Cl levels reached bedrock. A few painted architectural members were found and a considerable number of miniature vessels still points to cult activities in the area. In the N part of the acropo- lis two trenches (4.5 x 4.5m) were opened in order to get an impression of the cultural activities in the area close to the N 50 Kalydon: theatre</page><page sequence="37">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2003-2004 37 the SW comer of megaron B. A curved wall (Fig. 52), built of small stones, was found to underlie this comer. Over this wall was a deposit which included LH IIIC pottery, into which the foundations of megaron B had been laid (and which therefore provides a clear tpq for megaron B and a taq for the earlier structure). The wall therefore must be part of a large LBA (13th-14th Ct BC) structure, probably apsidal (a 'megaron'?). Playia Survey. F. Lang, E.I. Schwandner, P. Funke (DAI) and L. Kolonas (Director General, Greek Archaeological Service) report on the 2003 season of the German-Greek survey project of the Playia peninsula. The survey concentrated on the centre of the peninsula and the area in the N around the village of Ag. Nikolaos. A W/E ridge of mountains runs though the middle of the Playia peninsula and at the highest elevation (503m asl) Sterna is the site of fortification structures with gates and towers. While measuring the structures it became apparent that the for- tification walls showed several building phases. The hill top, originally enclosed by a more or less circular wall, was later enlarged by a wall to the W. In the interior were found a large cistern and another, much smaller one. In the E of the area, foundations of large houses with multiple rooms are preserved, but the area was probably not a normal settlement. The unusual function of the site is indicated by pyramid-shaped cuttings in the stone, by exedrae cut into the rock and by fragments of stones with grooves which might come from bases of stelae. Also the fragments of Cl sculptures do not fit the context of a typical fortification structure. This is underlined by the large amount of Cl and Hel pottery collected this season, comprising kantharoi and skyphoi, some of which was of high quality. I 51 Kalydon: marble head of a goddess 52 Thermon, sanctuary of Apollo: megaron B Numerous tiles bore a stamp with the letters 'AA' (Damos). Similar stamps were found during the excavations at ancient Leukas. On the ridge continuing towards the W, in at times difficult terrain, several new sites were identified by concentrations of tiles and pottery (including an almost complete handmade ves- sel with an applied face). The narrow ridge then widens towards the Ixus plateau. In the E, where the mountain descends towards the plateau, the tumble of a wall was discovered - more than 3m w. and showing a rather carelessly built exterior and widening towards the N to a tower-like structure. Originally this wall probably presented an insurmountable barrier. About 300m to the W of the wall, down the slope, another wall (ca 2m w'.) appears to be the E end of a previously unknown enclosure of the plateau on the N and W side. On the N side of the plateau there is a gate leading, via a well-built road, to the village of Archaia Playia, situated on the N slope of the Stera mountain (see below). The foundation of the village dates back at least to the 19th Ct, and the fortification of the plateau according to first estimations is to be dated to antiquity. On the plateau were found house foundations of various periods and material col- lected includes finds from antiquity to moder times. On the steep N slope, outside the plateau, an area with a concentration of pottery and tile was identified. Here a large number of black- glaze pottery vessels, some of high quality, and terracottas of C1 date was collected. As the nature of the terrain precludes the building of structures in this place, and as the finds are scattered down the slope, the impression is that the material was thrown down from the plateau. On the plateau above this area there are some scanty wall remains but no indication as to the function of the area. The formerly unknown Ixus fortification was well suit- ed as a retreat in times of crisis. Another focus of attention was the valley of Archaia Playia. The valley opens at the W towards the strait of Leukas and is nowadays the largest agricultural area of the Playia peninsula. The valley shows numerous areas with concentrations of pot- tery and tiles. The composition of the material, mostly utilitari- an pottery, amphoras and pithoi, suggests that the occupation consisted of farmsteads. This hypothesis is supported by finds of fragments of mills and oil or wine presses. The surface in the middle of the valley was covered with worked slabs of lime- stone with cuttings, suggesting the existence of an ancient cemetery. Stone slabs of Im 1. set into the ground parallel to each other probably belong to graves postdating antiquity. Large numbers of stone artefacts can be found on the surface in many parts of the NE area of the valley. On the Chironisi promontory in the W of the Playia penin- sula were found cuttings in the rock, house foundations and</page><page sequence="38">38 JAMES WHITLEY large amounts of Lakonian and Cor pottery (amphoras, pithoi) and tiles. Some of the amphora handles were stamped (E or M). On the highest point of the promontory (22m asl) there was a small building, possibly a tower, with part of a polygonal wall being preserved. On the N side of the slope, between the rocks, large amounts of pottery (particularly Cl black-glaze skyphoi and kantharoi, amphoras of 4th Ct date, tiles, pithoi and a Cl lamp) were found, with some of the fragments being restorable to complete vases. The thick layer of material might indicate a dumping ground. Also the promontory yielded stone artefacts. In the vicinity of the promontory were found numerous founda- tions of farmsteads and pottery and tiles from antiquity and the subsequent periods. In the bay of Makelari, the next bay S of Chironisi, were found the foundations of a Cl-Hel watch tower on the top of a hill. The tower was built from polygonal stones and had a diameter of ca 5m. On the hill, continuing towards the E, remains of structures of possibly ancient date can be seen. Surface finds date from antiquity to the Byz period. The struc- ture at Chironisi as well as the tower near Makelari were previ- ously unknown. However, there are no coherent settlement remains identified in this area. The area around the modem village of Ag. Nikolaos was another focus of the project. On a hill SW of the village, the remains of a previously known ancient watch tower are situated, offering views across the sea towards Actium. The edges of the hill are encircled by a Med wall. In the W of the hill were found numerous anc. and Med wall remains which might indicate a small settlement. The surface finds predominantly date to the Rom and Byz periods. In the S, the terrain rises steadily from the sea. In this rather overgrown area, there are house remains of E mod. date. House foundations were identified in exposed situations on some of the hill tops which are not ancient, according to the small stones used and the presence of mortar in some of the walls. The foundations of a previously known Cl farmstead with associated well were seen in an area on a high- er level. A road leading across the ridge of the hill towards the S connects this site with the valley of Archaia Playia. SE of the village of Ag. Nikolaos the remains of a previously discovered Rom bath are situated, which now is almost completely destroyed. The nearby channel is spanned by an Ot bridge. On the opposite bank a dense scatter of Terra Sigillata, dating to the E Rom empire, can be identified. The area around Ag. Nikolaos for the first time provides a high density of Rom finds and con- texts. Isolated lime stone slabs suggest the existence of graves. A profiled Hel grave stele showed traces of letters which can be restored to read 'TIMOFENEOX'. Numerous lime kilns were found in this area, but their date is difficult to determine. This year's season has so far yielded the largest number of ancient sites, the majority of which were found in the valley of Archaia Playia. It is here that the settlement centre of the Playia penin- sula has to be located.' KEPHALLENIA AND ITHAKA (6th EPCA; 6th EBA) Kephallenia Poros. Ethnos (27/9/2003) reports that investigations of the cave of Drakaina have demonstrated (discontinuous) use from 5600 to 188 BC. The earliest (Neo/EBA) use indicates human habitation. Finds include pots, sea shells, stone tools, faunal/botanical data relating to diet. Of particular interest are the successive floor levels, many coated with lime wash, and the successive hearths, all datable by radiocarbon. Human habi- tation ceased in the 3rd mill. BC, and there is no sign that the cave was used at all between the 15th and the 7th Cts BC. From the 6th Ct BC onwards the cave became a shrine to Pan and the Nymphs, a cult which abruptly came to an end with the Rom conquest in 188 BC. Argostoli. Kathimerini (23/7/2003) reports on the opening of the new archaeological museum on 27/6/2002. Ithaka C. Morgan (BSA/King's College London) and A. Soteriou (6th EPCA) report on the 2nd (2003) season of survey, study and lim- ited excavation: 'On the SE slopes of the Stavros valley, two worked blocks from a monumental public structure were investigated. The bur- ial of an adult female in a tile grave of typical local form (dated by an early 3rd Ct BC kantharos set beside the cranium) was cut by these blocks, and thus provides a tpq for, their insertion. Investigation showed that the blocks were damaged during dressing, discarded and subsequently placed to create a small terrace, bridging a wide gap between two outcrops of bedrock. This lies at the S edge of the Stavros S cemetery, and aligns with the likely course of a footpath from the coast. Cuttings confirm the existence of at least one further course of blocks; two defi- nite and two possible pieces of superstructure have been identi- fied in local terrace walls. The blocks are not from any local quarry so far identified. On the Roussano acropolis, a fortification wall was cleaned and drawn, and local quarries located and described. Erosional features on the slopes of the Kastro were also studied. Limited excavation was undertaken in two areas of the principal terrace in the upper Roussano valley, to the W of the Kastro and at a slightly higher elevation. These revealed the N/S axes of the ECh settlement (dating confirmed by comparison with the ear- liest phases of the deserted Med village of Anogi); the blocks used were likely derived from one of several nearby quarries. The gradient of the road was shallower than the present terrain. A study of terracing and erosion in the vicinity of the excava- tion revealed how the creation of these streets changed the drainage of the area and promoted rapid erosion, countered by underpinning which resulted in the creation of a formal terrace system. Roussano should thus be added to the limited number of post-Rom upland settlements, populated via migration from the valley lowlands. We continue to investigate this movement, focusing especially on the immediately preceding, LRom phase for which we have rich evidence from the 2002 survey. Trackways linking Roussano with Kalyvia (on the NW slope of the Stavros Valley) and with Exogi, were mapped and pho- tographed. Geomophological research in the Stavros valley concluded with a GPR survey of the valley bottom. Coring was undertak- en in the coastal zone, and a control pit excavated. In the Polis cave, final observations were plotted onto the first full map of the site and re-checked against observations of geology and geomorphology. The geological features of the area and their impact on the evolution of the landscape around this location are now understood. This in turn has provided valuable infor- mation with which to interpret the evolution of the site in terms of cliff collapse and erosion, and hence to make better-informed judgements about the form and function of the site during antiq- uity. The conclusion drawn in 2002, that is unlikely that any major cave-like structure could have existed at the site of the Polis 'cave', is confirmed. Instead, a preliminary reconstruction suggests a small, mostly open, sheltered area, protected from the sea by a large collapsed section of the S cliff face. Contrary to Benton's assumption that this was the roof of the cave, col- lapsed since antiquity, it has fallen from the cliff wall and was almost certainly in its present position throughout the life of the 'shrine'. The resulting sheltered area is oriented NE towards the Stavros ridge, and examination of the evolution of the coastline</page><page sequence="39">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2003-2004 39 indicates a viable land-route in antiquity along the coast from the valley bottom. Benton's trenches have been located to with- in 20cm on the present ground surface, with their positions marked out and photographed in preparation for 3-D plotting of the location of her finds Finally, systematic study was undertaken of finds from the 1938 excavation of the Polis kiln. In addition to two substantial dump deposits of mostly E-L Imperial amphoras and LRom tablewares, a small quantity of kiln furniture (bars and temper- ature tests) was identified, along with further fragments of tile waster and a large piece of antefix. The 1938 notebook record of the chamber roof construction and flue system permits detailed reconstruction of the kiln structure.' BOIOTIA (9th EPCA; 1 t EBA) Thebes. Ethnos (13/5/2003), Kathimerini (15/5/2003) and Eleftherotypia (15/5/2003) report on further rescue excavations to the NE of the city (in the area of the railway and the National Road). Finds include Cl/Hel houses, part of an EHel fortifica- tion wall (well outside the area of the 'Cadmeia'), datable to the time of Kassandros (Cassander). A striking find is a number of (Cl?) inscribed bronze plaques, deposited in a stone cist (see recent finds from Argos). Preliminary study reveals new infor- mation about the tribes of anc. Thebes. The principal finds came from the cemetery here, where 850 of the 1200 graves from Thebes have now been revealed. Finds include (Cl/Hel?) funer- ary stelai, and the head and knee of a LAr kouros, found re-used in a Hel grave. This kouros, the first such found in Thebes, is very similar to those from the sanctuary of Apollo on Mt Ptoon, and dates to around 510-500 BC. EUBOIA (11th EPCA; 1St EBA) Chalkis. To Vima (12/12/2003) notes plan for a new archaeo- logical museum. Lefkandi. I.S. Lemos (BSA/Edinburgh) reports on the 2003 season of excavation and study: 'Twenty hectares on Xeropolis were bought, most of them located to the E of the plot of the 'old excavations' of the 1960s. Renewed area excavations took place in August-September under the direction of I. S. Lemos, with D. Evely as assistant and A. Gounaris as the architect of the excavation; A. Livarda and G. Kotzamani organized bio-archaeological sampling; Kathy Hall (INSTAP, E. Crete) was the conservator. Two areas were selected: the E Sector located in the area of Trial trench W (excavated in 1965) and the W Sector immedi- ately to the E of the fence of the plot where the 'old excavation' is located. During the excavation, some twenty 5 x 5m squares were opened (500m2 in all), to an average depth of just short of a metre. Though excavation began within the familiar trench systems, these were transformed into open areas as soon as the underlying archaeology was understood. In the N part of the W sector a complex of LGeo apsidal and circular buildings was found, and in the central area a large LGeo/EAr building I was exposed (Fig. 53). To the S of build- ing I were rectangular LGeo (or later) houses (the E houses). Excavation in the S part of the sector revealed part of an apsidal structure dated to the E/Middle ProtoGeo period, confirming that Xeropolis was occupied at the time the Toumba building was built. A complex of LH IIIC retaining walls was excavated. Similar walls were built in the E IA to prevent the soil slipping in the area. Several LH IIIC (Lefkandi, phase 2) houses were 53 Lefkandi, Xeropolis: building I located; from this area comes a sherd from a LH IIIC phase 2 krater decorated with the image of a warrior (Fig. 54). In the E sector, Sub-Myc/EProtoGeo structures and finds (such as the jug shown in Fig. 55) suggest that this area was used in the transition period from the LBA to the EIA. The dis- covery of two pits establishes the eastern limits of the use of this area during the EIA, and the discovery of LH IIIC (Lefkandi, stage 3) structures and pottery indicates that this stage was bet- ter represented on Xeropolis than previously thought. The exis- tence of well-built LH IIIC (Lefkandi phase 2) houses under later construction shows that the settlement of this period was extended to the E part of Xeropolis. 54 Lefkandi, Xeropolis: | ~:~'~ ~ LC IIIC krater fragment 55 Lefkandi, Xeropolis: jug</page><page sequence="40">40 JAMES WHITLEY Special care was taken at the end of the excavation concern- ing the preservation and protection of the site. The whole area which was excavated this year has been fenced from the old excavation plot to the track at the E limits of the land which was bought this year. Work towards publication of material from Lefkandi- Toumba took place in Spring 2003 in the Eretria museum. Local and imported pottery from the tombs has been studied by I.S. Lemos, who is preparing the local pottery for publication, and by J.N. Coldstream (University College, London) who will publish the Attic, Cypriot and Phoenician imports. Dr N. Coldstream drew the Attic vases and some pendent semicircle skyphoi for the plates volume. Professor J. Kroll (Texas-Austin) studied the weights from tomb 79. Finally an electronic version of the catalogue of all finds was completed. This catalogue also incorporates those finds which have only recently been returned from the National Museum. In August, Professor T. Rehren (Institute of Archaeology, London) and I.S. Lemos made a pre- liminary list of metal and glass objects for scientific analysis.' Eretria. S. Fachard (Swiss School) reports: 'The Ministry of Culture decided in 2002 to cover up the ancient excavations of the sanctuary of Apollo Daphne- phoros, in particular the Geo structures that are regularly sub- merged by water during the winter. Limited excavation (by S. Verdan, Lausanne) in 2003 provided important information concerning the stratigraphy and the Geo structures of the sanc- tuary. In front of building 5 was found a foyer that seems to have been used in a domestic context, although we cannot exclude a link with metal-working (already attested in the area of the sanctuary). The major discovery is an Ar well, underneath the founda- tions of the stylobate of the Doric temple. The material from the well included tile fragments and bones, as well as abundant pot- tery including several dozen complete miniature hydrias, very similar to the ones already found in the sacrificial area N of the sanctuary. The well may have been in use with the temple of the 7th Ct and abandoned during the construction of the 6th Ct tem- ple. Although this is not the first time that miniature hydrias have been found in the sanctuary of Apollo, they were never in such abundance nor in such a well-defined context. In terms of religious patterns, their presence naturally raises the question of the relationship between the sanctuary and the nearby sacrificial area.' Amarynthos. S. Fachard (Swiss School) reports: Since 1969, Denis Knoepfler (University of Neuchatel) has tried to locate the Artemision of Amarynthos (or sanctuary of Artemis Amarysia), which occupied the first place in the Pantheon of the Eretrian State, but whose remains have never been located precisely. A geophysical survey, conducted by D. Knoepfler, P. Gex (Lausanne) and S. Fachard, was undertaken in the surroundings of the Paleoekklisies hill. The area under investigation has been heavily disturbed by modern construc- tion in the past decades, but the team was still able to prospect and take measurements in more than 120 different parcels of land. The archaeological remains were described and the sur- face pottery was studied directly on the field.' Karystos. J. Wickens (Canadian Institute) reports on a season of study towards the publication of the SE Euboea Project (SEEP): 'The primary focus this season was the extensive survey of the peninsula forming the E side of Karystos bay. Work pro- ceeded on two fronts: study for publication of the finds stored in the apotheke of the Karystos Museum and revisiting sites to verify map coordinates, architectural plans and measurements, and to take photographs for publication. Initial results from study of the pottery by Professor Susan Rotroff (Washington University in Missouri) and Dr John Hayes (Oxford) indicate that most of the 75 sites in the peninsula E of Karystos at which pottery was recovered were used in the Cl-Hel and LRom peri- ods. Nearly all the pottery is plain household ware, as would be found on agricultural establishments. Notable is the frequent occurrence of beehives and also some kiln equipment or pot stands. Loomweights, spindle whorls, and a few millstones/ grinders, as well as roof tiles, make up much of the non-pottery small finds, further indicating a domestic-agricultural function of most of the sites.' PHTHIOTIS AND EAST LOKRIS (14th EPCA; 7th EBA) Atalanti. To Vima (17/10/2003) reports on the find, in the cen- tral street of the town, of a building with Rom wall paintings still with vivid colours.

Coleman (Corell/ASCSA) reports on the 2003 study season: 'Study continued on the Neo architecture and finds from the acropolis of Halai. Cleaning and limited conservation measures on Neo remains in area F also took place. Professional staff con- cerned with the Neo remains included: J.E.

Coleman (Cornell/ASCSA) reports on the 2003 study season: 'Margaretha Kramer Haj6s and Kerill O'Neill continued studying the pottery and small finds respectively from our sur- face survey at the BA islet of Mitrou. In addition, topographical and geophysical surveys were carried out during the summer and autumn of 2003 by the Lamia Ephoreia.' PHOKIS (10th EPCA; 1St EBA) Delphi. In 2003, J.F. Bommelaer (EFA) studied architectural blocks and prepared drawings in preparation for a further vol- ume on the topography and architecture of Delphi. J. Oulhen and D. Rousset (EFA) report on further epigraphic work, as part of a general programme of re-checking all inscriptions from Delphi. During the course of this year they verified all of the inscriptions which had been inscribed on the blocks scattered around the sanctuary of Apollo as well as those which had been inscribed on blocks belonging to larger structures or buildings (with the exception of the theatre). The team also completed the inventory of the inscriptions which are located to the E and the</page><page sequence="41">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2003-2004 41 S of the sanctuary (including the S baths, peristyle house, Eastern baths and the terrace of Attalus) and those which are located in the area which spreads from the sanctuary to the Museum (the 'Ephoreia garden' and the storeroom around the church of Ag.

Further architectural members (both Doric and Ionic) testify to the existence of other public buildings, which have not yet been identified. Finds in the vicinity, which include imported 4th Ct BC Attic pottery, javelin heads, bronze coins and a gold earring, date the original construction of both buildings to the late 4th, early 3rd Cts BC. A destruction/abandonment horizon can also be dated by pottery to the 2nd Ct BC. The anc. name of the site is not known, but it may belong to the Tymphaian Land, which features in the campaigns of Philip II and Alexander the Great. Ancient roads. G. Pikoulas reports, in AEMTH 16 (2002), 669- 78, on the first phase of a project trying to identify the anc. and Med routes over the Pindos mountains. Spilaio. K. Drossou reports in AEMTH 16 (2002) 679-688 on the survey and restoration work conducted at the katholikon of the monastery of the Dormition of the Virgin which stands at the E end of the village. The katholikon (19 x 11.70m) belongs to the complex tetrastyle cross-in-square Athonite type, with a dome and a narthex. The masonry consists of stones and lime mortar. The exterior of the apses are built of poros blocks and bricks, decorated with smaller arches. The domes of the naos and of the narthex are octagonal. The katholikon was built in 1633, according to an inscription on a stone slab in the S wall. The frescoes of the naos are dated to 1640 (dome, side apses) and 1641 (sanctuary) and were executed by the painters Nikolaos and loannis. The narthex was painted in 1659 by Michalis and Elias from the villages of Zerma in Epiros and Eptachori in Kastoria. In 1910 a three-storey bell tower was built at the NW comer and an outer narthex (lite) was added and painted one year later by G. Pitenis. The wooden carved, gilded templon dates from the first half of 17th Ct. A survey for the restoration of the church was prepared in 1995 so as to record the state and the pathology of the monument. The structure was analysed in models, representing its condition during each phase. The most serious problem was that of cracks caused by the earthquake of 1995, and the first step was to support the walls with buttresses. The joints were filled with mortar where needed, and metal tie-rods were added alongside the old wood- en ones; the roof slates were cleaned and replaced, the concrete roof of the lite was removed, the window of the N apse was re- opened, the original wooden carved door in the W wall was restored and the metallic or plastic frames were replaced by wooden ones. The surrounding area was cleared, after undoing recent interventions, and a drainage system was put in place along the most sensitive N wall. The restoration of the frescoes is yet to be completed, in order to reveal an important church monument of W Macedonia. Servia (upper Haliakmon valley). A. Chondroyianni-Metoki reports, in AEMTH 16 (2002), 557-68, on the excavation of two ENeo-MNeo toumbes in the area, which is already known for its Neo activity, especially Servia V, see C. Ridley and K. Wardle, Servia I (BSA Suppl. 32, 2000). Most of the finds from the excavation of the low toumba of Paliambela, Roditi came from trench A. These comprise house remains defined by postholes, with three successive circular floor levels. Finds included clay objects (perhaps used in weav- ing, though not loomweights), chipped and ground stone tools, bone tools and 'proto Sesklo' (ENeo) pottery, principally closed spherical vessels, comparable to that from levels I and II from Achilleion in Thessaly. In the SW corer of the trench, a small cairn covered an infant inhumation. A more complex picture emerges from the excavation of the larger toumba of Varemenoi, Goulon. In layer A, finds were mostly MNeo (contemporary with Achilleion III); in layer B, two rectangular post-hole structures were revealed (trench A5), one containing an early MNeo deep vessel (Fig. 57). In layer F, a destruction horizon is associated with 'proto-Sesklo' pottery, and datable to the end of ENeo. Beneath this horizon was a cre- mation of an infant, found with a single pot. A layer of burnt logs may be the remains of a pyre. Unambiguous evidence for houses with clay floors came from layer A in trenches H6, 07. Finds from here included chipped and ground stone tools, 25 bone tools, 41 pieces of ornament made in stone or from snail- shell, 30 clay spool-shaped objects and 36 anthropomorphic and two animal terracotta figurines. The associated pottery is again 'Proto-Sesklo', of the transition between ENeo and MNeo. Aiani. G.

Various reports have been made on this lake settle- ment built on an artificial island, whose earliest phase (excavat- ed by Hourmouziadis) seem to date to Neo times. T. Giangoulis and A. Hourmouziadi report, in AEMTH 16 (2002), 641-8, on the results of geophysical prospection directed towards finding clay floors and hearths. The reconstruction of 1880 MNeo clay fragments has also proceeded. A. Almatzi and E. Voulgari, in AEMTH 15 (2001), 593-9, and S. Chatzitoulousis and E. Mavromataki, in AEMTH 16 (2002), 649-62, describe the means used to remove and con- serve the large quantities of waterlogged wood from the site. The wood was used both in the construction of buildings and (as at the Somerset levels) of wooden pathways. K. Touloumis and S. Chatzitoulousis, in AEMTH 15 (2001), 601-9, report on the excavation of a massive stone construction, 90m 1., close to the Byz church, built of large and small river pebbles. The structure does not appear to be defensive, but rather acted as a bulwark to provide extra stability for the arti- ficial island and perhaps to serve as a symbolic 'boundary'. Hel, Rom and Byz pottery was found above the stone structure, and bone and stone tools (including axes), flint, clay (weights, spin- dle-whorls, figurines) and bronze (fibulae and a finger-ring) were found in the strata underneath. These objects seem to be PH but post-Neo, and provide a taq for the stone structure of around 1100 BC (i.e. latest LBA/earliest EIA). Suggested par- allels for such a structure include Wasserburg-Buchau (in Switzerland) and Flag Fen (England). Kathimerini (16/1/2004) notes plans to turn this whole area into an archaeological park. Kolokynthou. Ch. Tsouggaris, Th. Salonidis, A. Douma and Ch. Sarriyiannidou report, in AEMTH 16 (2002), 625-36, on the excavation of this riverside Neo settlement, 6km from Dispilio, investigated in advance of the construction of the Egnatia Odos. Features comprise mainly pits, of varying shape and size, from the small and circular (ca 0.5m di.) to the long and oval (ca 4.5 x 2m) and 70 or so post holes. Finds include MNeo and LNeo 'rippled', 'black-burished' and 'black-topped' wares, chipped stone (from local flint) and ground stone (from local serpen- tine), jewellery (including bracelets) and terracotta figurines, including two animal and 18 anthropomorphic examples, good parallels for which can be found in the Balkan sites of Anzebegovo, Karanovo and Vinca. NOMOS OF PELLA (17th EPCA; 11th EBA) Aloros Almopias (demos of Aridaia). A. Chrysostomou reports, in AEMTH 15 (2001), 537-48, on investigations of the anc. settlement SE of Aloros. A 155m stretch of the W surviv- ing fortification wall was excavated, as well as the entrance (7 x 7.8m). The wall was bonded with lime, and so must be LRom; no evidence of an (expected) earlier wall was found. Apsalos-Aridaia area. Rescue excavations were undertaken in two locations in advance of the construction of the new road between Apsalos and Aridaia. A. Chrysostomou and A. Georgiadou report, in AEMTH 15 (2001), 525-35, on PH and LRom/ECh remains at the Apsalos Junction. Neo structures include a kiln (Fig. 58 shows fragments of the oven floor), post- holes, two pits and two trenches, containing flint axes and cores. At least four LBA pits were investigated, mostly contain- ing plain wares, but one had a kantharos with good parallels from Albania. One pit yielded two C14 dates: 1680-1529 BC 58 Apsalos-Aridaia area: fragments of kiln floor and 1428-1324 BC. Later finds include LRom/ECh sherds and amphoras, and three LRom cist graves. A. Chrysostomou, Ch. Poloukidou and A. Prokopidou, in AEMTH 15 (2001), 513-24, report on another Neo settlement at Grammi. Structures include pits, post-holes and trenches (size range 11.1 x 0.8m to 5 x 4.2 m), one well (4.2m d.) interspersed with burnt clay. One trench contained burnt clay (plaster?) and burnt wood, which yielded a C14 date of 5701-5622 BC. One area of burnt clay (plaster), 2 x 2.5 could be clearly associated with post-holes, giving some idea of house forms. Stone finds include quers, axes, pounders and blades. Pots include two closed vessels; other finds (principally terracotta) include clay 'tripod lamp',one anthropomorphic figurine, spindle whorls, (loom?) weights and bone beads. Archaeobotanical and archaeozoological study has so far identified bones of deer, hare and wild pig. Giannitsa area. P. Chrysostomou, in AEMTH 15 (2001), 489- 500, reports on excavations of three Neo-EBA settlements. At Aravissos, 1.5km S of the town of Aravissos and 10km NW of Giannitsa, LNeo and EBA levels, dwellings and a clear destruc- tion horizon were defined. At Ambelia, 1.5 km NW of Giannitsa, a 1.3ha Neo site was investigated and post-hole structures belonging to two phases (ca 5250-5000 BC) were isolated. Finds include pottery, stone and bone tools and ca 500 terracotta figurines. Excavations took place in two locations within the Neo tell of Giannitsa B. In the Drossos plot, a sec- tion of a large ditch was found. In the Parissis plot a deep sounding (8 x 8m) yielded evidence of three phases of occupa- tion represented by post-hole structures with clay floors, the middle phase can be dated by C14 to 6450-6250 BC. Finds include bone and stone tools, pottery (especially 'fruit bowls'), and both human and animal terracotta figurines. In the upper levels, an engraved stone 'seal', 2.5 x 5.5cm (Fig. 59) and data- ble to the 5th mill.

In AEMTH 15 (2001), 461-70; 16 (2002), 457-64, A. Papaeuthymiou-Papanthimou, A. Pilali- Papasteriou, G. Giangoulis, D. Basoyianni, E. Papadopoulou, E. Tsangaraki and I. Phappas report on the overall results of ten years of excavation of this E/MBA site, dated by C14 to 2200-1980 BC. The clay floors and post-holes can be grouped into five (A-E) houses (households?). A clear destruction hori- zon has preserved clay structures (including a clay oven in house A) and a remarkable number of whole vessels (lekanes, amphoras, storage vessels and 'kantharoid' drinking vessels with high, looped handles) which provide good evidence stor- ing, cooking, eating and drinking practices. Numerous clay loomweights provide evidence for the use of 'secondary prod- ucts'. Neo sherds hint at earlier occupation, but no Neo struc- tures have so far been identified. Palynological study of the E/MBA phases by N. Drivaliari, reported in AEMTH 15 (2001), 471-6, indicates an environment of mixed woodland (pine, oak, ilex, juniper, alder, maple and ash) and some open country (chenopods and plaintain). A. Chrysostomou and P. Chrysostomou report, in AEMTH 15 (2001), 477-88; 16 (2002), 465-78, on further excavation of the extensive EIA-EHel cemetery on 'hill 69', lkm W of the anc. settlement. The 70 EIA inhumations (chiefly trench, some cist) are the poorest, grave goods consisting of one, two or three (no more than four) locally produced, hand-made vessels placed by the head or foot. The picture changes radically in Ar (6th Ct BC) times: the bulk of the 153 Ar burials are inhumations in wooden coffins in trenches, with only two cremations. The 75 female burials have produced rich finds; faience and glass objects; gold necklaces, pendants, clasps, finger-rings and masks (T. 198; Fig. 60); bronze pins, fibulae and finger-rings; silver and bronze 'omega' earrings. Imported Attic black figure pottery includes a Siana cup from T.225, a 'Little Master' cup from T. 234 and a Cor exaleiptron from T. 197 (the very rich grave of a 7-8 year old girl). Though some of the 70 male graves are unfurnished, a large number can be classed as 'warrior' graves. The usual iron swords, spearheads (usually in pairs) and knives are sometimes accompanied by bronze armour, a shield in T.131, and helmets in T. 136, 189 and 194 (Fig 61). Helmets are usually of the 'Illyrian' type, though the helm from T. 189 combines Illyrian and Corinthian features. Gold ornaments (diadems) are also found in many male graves. Imported pottery from male graves consists mainly of Ionian and Rhodian per- fume flasks, one in the shape of 'Dionysos as symposiast', and one 'Atticizing' column krater, apparently imitating the prod- ucts of the workshop of Lydos. The 30 (15 female, 13 male) Cl-EHel graves (chiefly trench, some tile) are generally less richly furnished, though the young girl interred in T. 148 had a gold earring. A terminus for the use of the cemetery is provided by a coin of Philip II in T. 149. Pella. P. Chrysostomou reports, in AEMTH 15 (2001), 441-50; 16 (2002), 446-56, on further excavation in the area of the palace, built on the fortified acropolis, the central of the three hills that overlook Pella from the N. Investigations concentrat- ed on a memorial gateway (BoctXcetoq Kapa3os) in the N side of the fortification wall. The stone gateway (18 x 14m) consists of three entrances set within a tower. Two coins of Alexander III (the Great) provide a tpq of 334 BC and date the main phase of construction to the reign of Kassandros. Outside to the W there is a destruction horizon of Lakonian tiles. The inner gateway may date to a second phase, ca 168 BC. I. Akamatis reports in AEMTH 16 (2002), 437-46 on inves- tigations in the S side of the anc. agora. A row of eight double (16) rooms had been built against the S wall of the S stoa. A ter- minus post quem for this structure is provided by finds from the 17 Cl adult trench inhumations found beneath it. Late 5th/4th Ct finds from these graves include local pottery (aryballoid lekythoi, olpes, oinochoai, skyphoi, pyxides), a few figurines, bronze and silver coins and bronze, iron and silver fibulae. A silver tetradrachm of Alexander the Great (minted after his death, ca 280-275 BC) from the E side of the building provides a taq. The road which forms the S boundary of the agora was also excavated. This was covered by a (fire?) destruction hori- zon of Hel fallen tiles and 50 M/LHel stamped amphora handles from Thasos, Rhodes, Knidos, Kos, Chios, Corinth, Kerkyra, S Italy and Brindisi. These, and a denarius of M. Furius Philus, date the destruction to ca 119 BC. Cl finds from the fill beneath the road comprise bone, ivory and faience objects, female ter- racotta figurines and red figure kraters and drinking vessels. M. Lilimbaki-Akamati reports in AEMTH 15 (2001), 451- 460 on the discovery of a new EHel painted cist grave from the E cemetery. The tomb was a large (4.4 x 1.95 x 3m) stone cist, covered by stone plaques which had originally been supported by wooden beams, slots for which could be found in the side. The plundered tomb yielded only some pottery datable to the late 4th Ct BC. The floor was of plaster, and the plastered sides were painted with (from below upwards) a frieze of plants on a dark ground, an Ionic cymation, a frieze of male figures crowned with wreaths (who may represent philosophers) and (above) scenes of horse racing.</page><page sequence="45">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2003-2004 45 NOMOS OF IMATHIA (17th EPCA; 11th EBA) Kopanos-Lefkadia, anc. Mieza. V. Allamani, E. Koukouvou and E. Psarra report, in AEMTH 16 (2002), 571-80, on the exca- vation of a large LCl-EHel complex, over 100 x 100m, the exact purpose of which remains unclear. In the E of the com- plex, two thick walls create a space for a long roofed area. One of these walls has an internal row of pilasters over a low bench, and was covered by destruction debris (Fig. 62). Just to the W is a stairway leading to a higher level, and just to the NW a tem- ple-like structure, with two Doric columns in antis above a ramped entrance. Further to the W is an internal Doric colon- nade (peristyle court), in the NW comer of which are five rooms whose offset doors indicate they were used for symposia. Each of these five rooms has space for seven (probably wooden) kli- nai, evidence for which is also provided by the finds of colour- less glass, which often served as decoration in such klinai. Four of these rooms were approached through a shared antechamber, one only seems accessible by ladder. To the S of this was a large rectangular hall. A taq for the complex is provided by the destruction level, full of pottery of the end of the 4th/beginning of the 3rd Ct BC, and by the finds from the apothetis associated with the temple-like structure. Finds also include imported Attic Panathenaic amphoras of the 5th and 4th Cts BC. The function of the complex remains unclear. Parallels can be found both in sanctuaries, such as the Asklepeia in Athens and Epidauros and in the Macedonian palaces, such as that at Vergina. Polyplatanos, Toumba Polyplatanou. N. Merousis, in AEMTH 16 (2002), 519-30, undertook a statistical analysis of the LNeo pottery from this site. Vergina (anc. Aigai). S. Drougou, in AEMTH 15 (2001), 549- 58; 16 (2002), 491-96, reports on the finding of tile fragments stamped with the image of a goat, especially that from the Goultidis field (see AR 2002-03, 60), to support the identifica- tion of Vergina with Aigai (= 'goats'). A. Kottaridi, in AEMTH 15 (2001), 509-512, reports on the excavation of two cemeteries. Thirty-six, largely plundered, LAr-LHel trench graves were investigated just W of the so- called tomb of Philip II. Two of the four LAr-EC1 graves had traces of weapons; there was only one (LCl) cremation, only four (Hel) infant burials (1 neonate, 3 infants); and most of the LHel graves were very poorly furnished. The only unplundered grave provides clear evidence that Cl Macedonian males wore cloaks fastened with two iron pins. At Rovia 11 EIA/EAr (7th Ct BC) graves were investigated. Most graves were inhuma- tions in trenches covered by schist slabs, with one enchytris- mos. Most graves were poorly furnished, with drinking vessels set near the head or feet. Other finds include bronze fibulae and tubes, and some faience and glass. Ch. Saatsoglou-Paliadeli (Thessaloniki) reports in AEMTH 16 (2002), 479-90 on the investigation of the sanctuary of Eukleia in the anc. agora. A Cl/Hel peristyle structure enclosed another rectilinear setting (altar or temple?) whose purpose remains unclear. Both peristyle and structure seem to have been built in the 5th/4th Ct BC, with a clear destruction horizon in the 2nd Ct BC. Traces of earlier EIA/Ar occupation were found beneath. Other indications of EIA occupation in the vicinity were an EIA trench inhumation (the only find being an iron knife) and an EIA storeroom/cellar with at least one pithos. In the NE comer, another LHel storeroom/cellar contained seven pithoi; finds include a terracotta of Artemis the Hunter. A Cl inscription, reading [AoaK?]6atulovIot was found by the theatre. 62 Kopanos-Lefkadia: LCl/EHel structure Veroia area. A general account of Byz and later sites is now available: Th.

The most substantial find was a large rectangular Rom kiln, com- plete with firebox, but perhaps the most important the LCl-EHel poros quarries, which can be dated by finds in the overlying strata.See also AR 2002-03, 60-61. Asomata, Mavromouria. A. Tsilipakou and M. Polatidou- Bizeta in AEMTH 16 (2002), 585-596 report on a rescue exca- vation of a Post-Byz settlement 500m SE of the village under- taken in advance of the Egnatia Odos. Fourteen buildings were found in an area of 14, 400m2 which belonged to a Post-Byz settlement (15th Ct), as shown by the coins and the ceramic finds. The buildings had two or three rooms, courtyards among them, fireplaces and small apses at the W walls - constructions intended for cooking and heating - and other depressions on the ground surface for deposit reasons. The floors were made of beaten earth and the roofs were covered by tiles. The houses probably had no storage units. The objects found were artefacts of daily life, connected mainly with food preparation. The settlement can be identified either as the village Rodia, totally destroyed by the Turks in 1822, or with the first location of the Asomata village, which was inhabited by the end of 14th-beginning of 15th Cts. The site was near important roads and had communication with big cities like Veroia, as pottery finds proved. It also offered access to water sources as well as the security of proximity to mountains. The settlement has sim- ilarities (absence of urban plan, common courtyards, fireplaces, use of mud and stone construction) with other mountain vil- lages in Greece (Geraki, castle of Platamon, Crete) and the Balkans (Shumen in Bulgaria, Kotor in Serbia, Byz Pergamon) all characteristic of late secular Byz architectural tradition. Tzamala, Vermiou. A. Kottaridi, in AEMTH 15 (2001), 501-7; 16 (2002), 501-8, reports on investigations in six locations undertaken before construction of the Egnatia Odos through the Haliakmon valley, with finds ranging from the EIA until LHel times. The sites are: Tzamala I, a LHel house, and Tzamala Ia, a small EIA cemetery; Tzamala II, a small EIA settlement, with circular and elliptical structures; Tzamala III, a settlement,</page><page sequence="46">46 JAMES WHITLEY 100m S of Tzamala II with thrww EIA and two E-MHel phases. The bulk of the EIA finds came from a pit, and include a bronze pin, a gold clasp, and local pottery (but very few drinking ves- sels). In the area around Tzamala II &amp; III are some large enclo- sure walls and stone caims, whose precise purpose is unknown. Tzamala IV is an LBA-EIA cemetery, consisting of inhuma- tions in stone cists covered by low stone caims/tumuli. Close parallels for the burial practices can be found at the nearby EIA cemetery of Vergina, excavated by M. Andronikos. The graves here however are not particularly rich, adult graves being noticeably poorer than those of some children. Extensive work has however been undertaken on the osteology and palaeopathology of these burials (see L.W. and Th.G. Antikas, in AEMTH 16 (2002), 509-18) and some interesting patterns emerge. Individual burials seem to be those of men, or 'war- riors' around 35-45 years old, in two cases buried with iron knives (one with a handle of goat hom), and one with an iron sword. There is also at least one double grave of a man and woman in the same cist, and one of a 'family group', consisting of a 30-year-old woman, with an infant, one 12-13 year old male, and one 7-8 year old girl, who who was buried with bronze objects and two gold clasps. Tzamala V and VI were two small EIA habitation sites, the only finds being pots. Lefkopetra, Kallipetra. L. Stefani, in AEMTH 15 (2001), 559- 74; 16 (2002), 531-43, describes rescue excavations in this site in advance of the construction of the Egnatia Odos along the banks of the Haliakmon river. Occupation in the area seems to last from the fourth mill. BC until the Rom period. LNeo/EBA occupation is confined to a single stratum to the W of the site. An MBA phase, associated with finds of clay with reed impres- sions (indicating 'wattle and daub' structures?) can be dated by C14 to 1880-1600 BC. An LBA phase is also associated with clay with reed and wood impressions and with finds of ground stone tools. Evidence for stone structures (including a stone- built road) only begins with the EIA phase, which lasts until the 7th Ct BC. Occupation now covered an area of 0.7 ha. The bulk of the associated pottery (including an askos of the 10th Ct BC) is locally produced and hand made, but there are some painted sherds with Geo decoration which seem to have been imported from Chalkidiki. The succeeding Ar-Cl phase lasts from the 6th to the 4th Ct BC. At least seven structures, 7m long, can be iden- tified. Associated finds include loomweights, iron tools, bronze jewellery, a silver neck-ring and gold earrings. The bulk of the pottery consists of local and hand-made black wares. Imports include 'Pre-Persian' incised ware from Chalkidiki and a very few Cor and Attic black figure and rf. It is curious then that, just before the end of the 4th Ct BC three kilns were built on the site. This phase is brought to an end by an earthquake destruction, a tpq for which is provided by coins of Amyntas III (389-3), Perdikkas III (365-59) and Philip II (359-336). After perhaps a 70-year gap, occupation resumed in the penultimate EHel-MHel phase, consisting of two complexes equipped with hearths, ovens, benches, semi-circular objects which may have been mills, and one clay bath. Finds include painted pottery and numerous terracotta figurines, usually of known local types (from the workshop at Veroia). These complexes were destroyed sometime in the mid 2nd Ct BC, a taq being provided by coins of Philip V (220-179 BC), Amphipolis (187-31 BC), Pella and Thessalonike (187 BC). Associated with both these are 16 LCl-Hel graves (14 pit and 2 tile). The final Rom phase is represented by a complex of baths and workshops, and by the temple of the 'Autochthonous Mother of the Gods', first inves- tigated by Petsas in 1966. Recent cleaning has revealed that this structure is larger than first thought, being 20m 1. in all. Mikri Santa. L. Stefani, in AEMTH 15 (2001), 567-69; 16 (2002), 545-56, reports on investigations in three locations undertaken in advance of the construction of the Egnatia Odos in the Haliakmon valley. At Arapi, a small LCl-Hel farm was investigated. Finds from a pit include loomweights, iron tools, Hel pottery and eight bronze coins (of Alexander III, Kassandros and Demetrios Poliorketes) of the 4th and 3rd Cts BC; the farm seems therefore to have been abandoned thereafter. A similar complex with three structures was excavated 300m to the E, at Galanovrysi, where structure A comprises two small rooms (6.8 x 5m; 6.5 x 6m) and finds include LCl-EHel plain, monochrome and household wares; loomweights; metal tools; and a bronze han- dle. There were also two small coin hoards containing in all 12 bronzes and one silver of Alexander III (the Great) and Philip II. Structure F was larger, being 16.8m I. with four rooms. In the W part of structure B another hoard, with 10 bronze coins of Alexander II (369-68 BC), Philip II and Alexander III. The sequence at Kryoneri is more complex. Occupation here begins in the EIA, represented by large enclosure walls and (less cer- tainly) apsidal or elliptical structures. The LC1-EHel phase seems to represent not a farm, but a workshop. Structures include workrooms (with three identifiable architectural phas- es) and three kilns. Finds include sparse household pottery, ter- racottas, iron tools and bronze and silver coins. The final phase is represented by a Rom kiln and an LRom cemetery. CENTRAL MACEDONIA NOMOS OF KILKIS (16th EPCA; 9th EBA) Palatiano, S of Heroon. E. Anagnostopoulou-Chatzipolychroni, in AEMTH 15 (2001), 149-60, reports on further excavation within and around the principal street of this known Rom set- tlement, which has revealed levels of the EIA through Hel peri- ods. The EIA phase is represented by pits, one rectangular store- room and an apsidal/elliptical structure. Hand-made pottery dates this phase from the 10th to 8th Cts BC. A destruction hori- zon marks the beginning of an Ar (7th-5th Ct) phase, compris- ing two structures. A further LCl-EHel (late 4th/early 3rd Cts) phase comprises one house complex, enlarged in the subsequent LHel (2nd Ct) phase. The more extensive Rom occupation lasts from the 1st to 3rd Cts AD. Karathodoreika. Ethnos (25/7/2003) reports on the excavation of 60 EIA-EHel (10th4th Cts BC) graves, 23 found underneath a cair, and others probably covered by tumuli. Finds include a horse burial; bronze jewellery from 'female' graves, and iron weapons from male 'warrior' graves. Kilkis. D. Makropoulou, in AEMTH 16 (2002) 361-374, reports on the Byz topography of Kilkis prefecture. The research start- ed years ago by Sotiris Kissas (t), has been continued by D. Makropoulou and A. Tokmakidou and has resulted in the fol- lowing new site locations: ECh basilicas: in Koromilia village, municipality of Hersos (with three aisles and mosaic ground floor); in Gerakario vil- lage, municipality of Krousson (identified with the monastery of Roslovou, dedicated to the Theotokos. Architectural mem- bers of this basilica are built into the walls of the nearby church of Saint Paul); at the site Gavra, municipality of Krousson (ruins of a triconch church and nearby, remains of a PH (BA) settlement); at the site Monastiraki, Ano Sourmena village, municipality of Mourion; in Kolchis village (remains of two</page><page sequence="47">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2003-2004 47 basilicas, parts of fortifications and of the cemetery); 3 km S of Kolchis; at the site Livadia, Terpyllos village; in Anthophyto, municipality of Pikrolimni; and at the site Monastiri, Ryzion village, municipality of Axioupolis. EChfortifications: on the hill Kastelli/Prophitis Elias, 3 km NE of Koromilia (with remains of houses and of a cemetery); at the site Palaiokastro, Melanthiou village (together with a church and tombs); at the site Monastiri, Plagion village, dated from the reign of Justinian. Byz fortifications: the old Gynaikokastro, built by the emperor Andronikos III (1328-1342), at the site Tranos Lofos (= big hill), Metalliko village; at the site Batsovo/Kastri, Polykastro village; at the sites Kastri and Kastrakia, Pontoerakleia village (with remains also of prehistoric settle- ments); at the site Kastri, Kotyli village; at the hill of Hissar Tepe, Pedino village; at Korou dere/Spanish river, near Kolchis. Remains of Rom or ECh buildings, together with potsherds and coins were found in the villages of Terpyllos, Leipsydrio, Mikrokambos, Limnotopos, Gorgopi, Goumenissa, Skra, Euzonon and in the church of Agioi Konstantinos and Eleni in Mesia village. Architectural members of Rom and ECh periods are built into the fountain of Filyria village, the church of Agios Georgios in Chorygi village, and the church of Agios Georgios in Kambochori village. Other architectural members, and Byz coins were found in several other locations. Cemeteries are associated with settlements at the site Ambellia, Anabryto village; in Europos, which was aban- doned in the 6th Ct; at three locations in Pedino village (a good engraved, glazed cup of the 12th Ct was found in one of them); and at the site Katounisti, Karpi village. Ruins of monasteries are known at the site Pentalofos, Goumenissa village, on the hill ofAgios Georgios in the city of Kilkis and on the hill Agios Antonios, Griva village. Post-Byz buildings include Ot baths in Kilkis and Polykastro, the mosque in Mesia (15th-16th Cts, now the church of Agioi Konstantinos and Eleni), several fountains, bridges and watermills. NOMOS OF THESSALONIKE (16th EPCA; 9th EBA) Thessalonike (western environs) Anchialos, 'twin table'. In AEMTH 15 (2001), 299-308; 16 (2002), 223-32, M. Tiverios (Thessalonike) and St. Gimatzidis (Freie Universitat, Berlin) report on further excavation of section AO in the 'upper' table, reaching a depth of 6.5m. A succession of floor levels has been revealed. In the deepest, only local hand-made pottery was found, but levels above contained import- ed finewares (ProtoGeo Thessalian kantharoi, an 'atticising' cup and SubProtoGeo Euboean pendent semi-circle skyphoi) all datable to before 750 BC. These layers were sealed by the con- struction and subsequent destruction of an LGeo house. Pottery in the destruction horizon includes LGeo imported finewares, both Euboean (skyphoi-kraters and skyphoi, Fig. 63) and Attic (kantharos, Fig. 64) as well as locally produced wheel-made pottery and hand-made lekanes. Other finds include numerous querstones, local cooking wares and equipment, spindle whorls and bone tools, including one tool for decorating the flat rims of local lekanes. Sindos. A. Keramaris, S. Protopsalti and St. Tsolakis in AEMTH 16 (2002), 233-40 report on further excavation in two locations: BI.IE.O (O.T. 55, Skaziki/Marangou plot): thirty further Ar-LCl (6th-4th Ct BC) graves, all adult inhumations of known type (trench with circular peribolos, rectangular trench and cist) were investigated. Finds from female graves (e.g. gr 19) include bronze arm-rings, bronze bow fibulae, amber and faience objects. Male graves include the 'warrior grave' 15, an extended inhumation. Grave goods include an Illyrian helm, iron sword and two spear heads, a gold neck ornament (also found in two other graves), and imported Attic pottery. These include black-glazed 'Rheneia' cup and exaleiptron, a black figure lekythos, and an red figure column krater attributed (by M. Tiverios) to the Syriskos painter. Also notable are the five horse burials, principally of the 6th Ct BC, some with grave goods. Control Air Balkan (O.T. 54): further evidence of Cl-EHel rectilinear structures, in the form of two rooms (5 x 3.4m) were found. Coins of Amyntas II and Demetrios Poliorketis date this structure. A later MHel (2nd Ct BC) female grave with five fig- urines and glass perfume flasks provides a taq. Thessalonike (centre) Palace of Galerius. M. Karaberi, in AEMTH 15 (2001), 205- 13, summarizes the results of rescue excavations since 1950. M. Karaberi and E. Christodoulidou, in AEMTH 16 (2002), 307-15, also report on rescue excavations at junct. of Gr. Palama and Plateia Navarinou. Here 28m of a ceremonial roadway 10m w., paved with marble slabs, runs NW/SE. Angled symmetrical pier-like structures of brick would have borne arches for stoas lining the way, and a 15cm h. footing defined a kerb 40cm w. A large waste pipe ran along the centre of the road, connected to a much wider system of drains. Finds from the stratum below the road include figurines, clay masks and lamps from known workshops (e.g. C. Valerius Tyrannus, rIoOos), pyramidal loomweights, and coins of Augustus, Claudius I, Antoninus Pius, Alexander Severus, Gordian, Aurelian and Probus, thus providing a tpq in the late 3rd Ct AD. The drains had also col- lected earlier Hel material including Rhodian stamped amphora handles, W Slope Ware, 'Megarian' bowls and 'Ephesos' lamps. 63 Thessalonike, Anchialos: Euboean skyphos 64 Thessalonike, Anchialos: Attic kantharos</page><page sequence="48">48 JAMES WHITLEY Further investigation in the S stoa of the palace revealed a hall with wall paintings and a mosaic floor, decorated with Geo and marine designs, all sealed by a destruction layer of the 3rd Ct AD.

Tsimbidou- Avloniti and K. Theodoridis report on Hel and Byz finds in a tri- angle formed by O. Tsimiski, Dangli and N. Germanou, just to the E of the city walls. In one section, a complex of four Byz kilns, cisterns and wells indicates industrial or workshop activ- ity; marble grave stelai from an Ot cemetery were also found. In another area, an EHel complex of two wells, trenches and one structure was revealed. Finds from one well include stamped amphora handles, perfume flasks, black-glazed kan- tharoi and W Slope ware of the early 3rd Ct AD. Similar finds were recovered from the structure (building 1), as well as a coin of Demetrios Poliorketis. There is also clear evidence of suc- cessive marine flooding in both the Rom and Byz periods. Byzantine Thessalonike Ch. Bakirtzis, in AEMTH 15 (2001), 425-431, reports on 28 res- cue excavations in the city. One of the most valuable finds was a marble sarcophagus of 10th Ct kept in a small Paleologean church in O. Valaoritou. The most important rescue excava- tions took place along the N side of O. Lambrou Koromela, at the courtyard of the Delasal High School and mainly in the upper part of the city and the citadel. The site of the Trigonion and the fortified church of Saint Matrona were located in this area. While digging for the water supply net across O. Agiou Dimitriou street, interesting remains came to light -such as roads, buildings of LRom and ECh periods, cisterns, wells, con- duits and a large two-storeyed house identified as the guest room of the Agios Demetrios basilica. Work has also been car- ried out on the mosaics and the murals in the churches of Agia Sophia, Agios Demetrios, Acheiropoietos, Agia Ekaterini and Agioi Apostoloi. The wall paintings of Agios Athanasios in Evosmos (1818), which represent a popular secular art rather than a religious one, were fully restored. During 2001 final restoration of architectural details in the Acheiropoietos church, the Rotonda, Eptapyrgio and the castle of Platamon was com- pleted. Byz W cemetery. E. Marki, in AEMTH 15 (2001), 321-330, reports on eight rescue excavations carried out in the W necrop- olis of Thessalonike. Uncertainty remains as to whether or not the cemetery was abandoned during the Slavic raids, or used during the DA, and when it was finally abandoned. In 2000 the excavation of the plot in O. Agathonos and 0. Leonida Spartiati, conducted by A. Hatziioannidi, E. Mauroudi and G. Skiadaresi, revealed six 4th Ct barrel-vaulted tombs, one more of the 6th Ct, two cisterns with a funeral chapel of later date and two infants' tombs inside and outside of the chapel. The six tombs (1.30 x 1.90m each) were in a rectangular enclosure. [50] They had flat roofs, shared common walls and an open area among them provided space for ritual suppers. Most were covered by earth, rarely with marble slabs. One tomb was painted with geometrical subjects and the common motive of a Christogram in the middle of rose petals was depicted on the roof. The burial complex is dated to the 4th Ct and ceramics indicate that it remained in use until the 7th Ct. Members of a rich family or of a particular business class seem to be buried there, the nature of their religious faith is still unclear, but the presence of the Christogram suggests that at least one of them was Christian. One tomb seems to have been later than the 6th-7th Ct and did not have a flat roof, belonging to a time when ceremonial suppers were forbidden. A cistern and a single-aisled funeral chapel built of spolia, with inscribed marble tombstones cover- ing the ground, were also found. An infant's tomb was discov- ered inside the chapel, which was dated by ceramics and coins to the 8th-9th Cts. On the basis of the excavation evidence, the archaeologists conclude that the necropolis of Thessalonike was not aban- doned after the raids of the 7th Ct, but at the same time, burials took place inside the city or in the courtyards of churches. The cemeteries of Thessalonike were visible, although abandoned, by the 10th Ct, as may be supposed from a text of Kaminiates. The increase of infant mortality during the DA and the belief that children were angels until the age of seven, created a ten- dency to construct children's tombs around funerary chapels. O. Iassonidou 6. E. Marki and D. Kommatas, in AEMTH 16 (2002), 327-336, report that in 1995 Elli Pelekanidou and B. Boulioni carried out a rescue excavation in the foundations of Thessalonike's State School, which was demolished in 1979 due to an earthquake. A supplementary excavation was con- ducted in 2002, in order to include the antiquities so revealed in the new school building. At the SE part of the site, the founda- tion stone of the school was found. Its inscription reports the names of the local civil and church authorities. A pit containing an ampulla of holy water and fourteen coins was also found underneath it. All these finds date to the 19th and 20th Cts. Other antiquities discovered in the site belong to at least six chronological phases, with ruins of constructions that were altered many times. Phase A' (Rom Imperial): to the S, the ruins of a house with its impluvium and a bath, of which parts of the hypocausts, conduits, pits and cisterns were found. Phase B' (ECh): the bath was repaired and a second pit was opened to the E. Especially interesting is a rectangular cistern (6 x 3.50m) with seven pointed amphoras built into the width of its walls, in an attempt to improve the rigidity of the structure -a solution unrecorded before. Phase C' (4th Ct): to the W, ruins of a house with three rooms and a triclinium were discovered. Below the triclinium, the headless statue of a muse was found. The ground was partly decorated with crude mosaics, with geometrical sub- jects. In the 5th Ct the house was repaired and the roughly- shaped mosaic tesserae were replaced by thinner ones, of better quality. Phase D' (6th Ct): tp the S, the ruins of a house with mosaics on the walls and on the ground floor, with parts of its courtyard, triclinium and the peristyle stoa were excavated. Two rooms were added to the house of the first phase and the ground floor paved with high quality marble slabs. Phase E' (DA): the large rooms of the houses were divided into smaller ones. Phase F' (Byz-LByz): the houses fell into ruins and were converted into workshops for dyeing textiles. Study of the excavation finds revealed that the site belonged to the new urban insulae which were created when the city was extended at the time of Galerius. Four houses were built (approx. 35 x 28m) with courtyards and openings between them that allowed access to the communal bath. The open area was gradually covered by subsequent new construction.</page><page sequence="49">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2003-2004 49 Area of O. Agia Sophia and 0. Gyzi. N. Karydas, in AEMTH 16 (2002), 337-344, reports work on several building plots: At O. Ouranias 3: to the NE, 21 tombs of Paleologean and post-Byz period were found. At the centre, parts of conduits which start from the large barrel-vaulted Byz cistern in 0. Olympiados were discovered. To the S and E, a landfill with ceramics of 1St BC-lst AD Cts came to light. At O. Agia Sophia 98: landfills with ceramics dated as above, five mud-built walls and tombs of LHel period were revealed. At O. Vlahava 8: ruins of LByz workshops and the foundations of a watertower and a well were excavated. Landfill with ceramics dated as above was also found. At O. Gyzi 5: antiquities of seven periods were found: two mud-built walls and part of a conduit (Hel), ceramics and other artefacts (1st Ct BC-1st Ct AD), a house (5.10 x 1.40m) deco- rated with wall paintings (Rom), a wall (Rom Imperial), a con- duit and a cistern (4th Ct), a large, strong enclosure, probably a protective structure of an important building (Ech), workshops with a fireplace, conduits, a pit and a well (DA). Study of these excavations showed that the area W of O. Agia Sophia was residential, with houses built on the Hippodamean grid plan, as is the rest of the city. The area was abandoned after the Romans occupied the city, indicated by the landfill with ceramic finds. During the Imperial and ECh peri- ods, the N part was still deserted, but the W part was developed, as shown by the remains of houses with wall painting and brick paving. The area was destroyed after the earthquakes of the 7th Ct and re-inhabited during the Post-Byz period. It is remarkable that only workshops were built during the M and LB periods. During the Rom and ECh periods the need for water storage becomes of high concern, as attested by conduits, cisterns and the water tower. The tombs at the N part of the site must be related to a monastery cemetery complex still unknown to us. N. Karydas, in AEMTH 15 (2001), 309-320, reports on the excavation of the building plot at the junction of O. Pasteur and O. Agiou Dimitriou which has yielded foundations of build- ings from LRom to Byz: at O. Pasteur 5 and 0. Ioakeim Sgouros, foundations of buildings dated to the time of the Tetrarchy, revealed in 1973; at the junction of O. Pasteur- Makedonikis Aminis and 0. Kassandrou, foundations of a LRom building with three phases from 3rd to 5th Cts and of a house dated to the 1St Ct AD; at O. Makedonikis Aminis 18, an ancient road, a large conduit, an ECh building and a Rom house with mosaic floors with geometrical designs; at O. Pasteur 7 and 0. Ioakeim Sgourou, a large ECh house with courtyard and mosaic floor, above the remains of a Rom house; conduits and pits belonged to LByz workshops; at O. Pasteur and 0. Agiou Dimitriou 63-65, a building with four rectangular rooms with mosaic floor and S peristyle dated from LRom to ECh. The building was part of the ancient insula and was destroyed in the 7th Ct; its material was re-used in MByz constructions; ancient wells, used until Post-Byz, and conduits were also found. This evidence suggests that this part of the city was the industrial centre and had been monumentally constructed, with stores, public services, sanctuaries. The cardo traversing the area was constructed with peristylia (= porticos), forming a cer- emonial way, characteristic of LRom Greek and Roman cities. These structures are of Tetrarchic date, when Thessalonike was developed as the political, administrative and economical capi- tal of the emperor Galerius. (See Palace of Galerius, above.)

K. Soueref, in AEMTH 15 (2001), 241-8; 16 (2002), 277-89, reports on investigations in four loca- tions around the 'table' surrounding the BA/EIA toumba. At O. Ortansias 2 (upper table) several rooms of a LCl-EHel (4th Ct BC) house with stone foundations and clay floors were investi- gated. Rooms include a kitchen and a storage area with amphoras and other closed vessels. Associated finds include ter- racotta roof tiles, black-glazed pottery of the 5th and 4th Cts, and coins of Philip II and Alexander III. At O. Empedokleous 21 (edge of table) stone foundations and cairs, probably repre- senting house remains, associated with Ar-EHel (6th-4th Ct) pottery were found. At the Alana plot, aside from some pits with EIA pottery and 4th Ct BC house foundations and roof tiles, this area seems to have served as a cemetery in Ar-EHel (6th-early 3rd Ct BC) times. Of the 56 graves investigated, the majority (91%) were trench graves covered by schist slabs, the major exception being four rectangular clay pits used for cremations in the 4th Ct. The preponderance of graves (51%) were of children, mainly buried without grave goods. Gender differences in adult graves were clear from grave orientation (men with head to N, women with head to S.) Finds include imported pottery: Ar Cor exaleiptra, Attic Cl (5th-4th Ct) black-glazed cups (e.g. 'Rheneia' cup), local wares, bronze jewellery, gold 'mouth-pieces' and (in one child's grave) terracotta figurines (Fig. 65). Triandria (O. Amorgou 27). Ten Ar-EHel (6th-early 3rd Ct BC) graves (7 trench, 1 poros sarcophagus), very similar to those from the Alana plot, were investigated. Finds include sil- ver earrings, bronze jewellery and imported pottery, such as the LAr Ionic cup and globular aryballos from grave 5. Thessalonike/Pylaia boundary K. Soueref, in AEMTH 15 (2001), 249-54, reports on excava- tions at O. Plastira 69. Under a layer of rooftiles, a deposit of EHel local cooking wares (e.g. lekanes) and finewares, such as oinochoai, krater-kantharoi and skyphoi, is interpreted as evi- dence for a workshop (though no kiln structure was revealed). Some imported W Slope ware dates the deposit to the 3rd Ct BC. There is also evidence for Rom (terra sigillata) and LRom/ECh activity, the latter in the form of a rubbish pit probably associ- ated with the basilica and cemetery in the neighbouring plot. Karabournaki Kodra (old army camp). M. Tiverios, E. Manakidou and D. Tsiaphaki, in AEMTH 15 (2001), 255-62; 16 (2002), 257-66, report on further excavation of this EIA-EC1 toumba. The earliest 8th Ct BC finds consist of local pottery, including local imitations of SubProtoGeo pendent semi-circle skyphoi. Imported Ar-EC1 wares from later levels come from all over the Aegean and beyond, and include Lesbian and Attic SOS transport amphoras, Ionian cups, Chian oinochoai, a G2-3 kantharos from the Troad, a trefoil lip of a Phoenician oinochoe and a LAr Lakonian black-glazed stirrup krater (Fig. 66). ProtoCor and Cor imports predominate earlier, but Attic (par- ticularly black-glaze) predominate from ca 500 BC onwards. Attic fineware imports include a 'Sophilan' fragment, and a 65 Thessalonike, toumba: figurines and pottery</page><page sequence="50">50 JAMES WHITLEY 66 Thessalonike, Karaboumaki: Lakonian krater (black figure?) lekythos 'close to the Edinburgh painter'. Local Ar-ECl finewares comprise 'silvery' ware and 'ionizing egg- slipped ware'. Ar-EC1 architecture comprises walls, pebble floors, semi- subterranean beehive structures and the occasional store-room. The most complete of these was covered by a layer of roof tiles, contains three pithoi, and is dated by a silver coin of Perdikkas II (454-413 BC) Southeastern environs of Thessalonike Thermi. M. Pappa, Ph. Adaktylou and S. Nanoglou, in AEMTH 15 (2001), 271-8, report on selective investigations of this MNeo-LNeo flat site covering an area of 6ha. Architectural evi- dence comprises numerous pits of varying size (2-5m w., up to im d.), some associated with post-holes and (sometimes) paved areas, some filled with animal bones (chiefly of cattle), and some associated with the production of artefacts in chipped stone, pit 46 alone producing 11000 pieces of debitage. Other finds include 30 pounders, 20 clay (loom?)weights and cooking wares. Finewares include MNeo chestnut burnished wares with white inlay and LNeo I black burnished and painted wares, dat- able to the middle of the 6th millennium BC. Souroti (O.T. 40, Polygyrinou plot), in the municipality of Vasilika. K. Soueref and K. Chavela, in AEMTH 16 (2002), 267-76, report on the excavation of 29 Ar-EHel graves. These are of known types (mainly trench, some cist, one tile), and mainly of adults (only five of children). Gender differences amongst adults in the 20 Ar graves are emphasized by orienta- tion (men's heads to S, women's to N) rather than grave goods (the only weapon being an iron spear-head in grave 2). Grave goods are not particularly rich, and consist of finewares both local and imported, such as an Attic black figure lekythos of the 'Beldam workshop' in grave 9, and an Attic type C kylix and Cor exaleiptron in grave 12. The five LCl/EHel graves are dated by coins of Perdikkas III and Alexander III. The authors under- take a statistical analysis of both shapes and imported vs local wares. The associated Ar-EHel settlement is unusual in that it seems to be neither a toumba nor a trapeza. Though the anc. name of the site remains unclear, its position must form part of the debate as to the location of anc. Strepsa and Anthemous. Epanomis, Byadoudi. Th. Pazaras, in AEMTH 15 (2001), 289-298, reports on the excavation of an ECh three-aisled basil- ica, begun in 1998 at the site Byadoudi, W of the village. In 2000 and 2001 the adjacent structures of the church were revealed. At the NW, built as annex to the narthex, a large rec- tangular hall, divided into two rooms, is identified with the bap- tistery, the construction of which proves the importance of the church in the area. In the S side, a cruciform font was found. At a later stage - perhaps by the time of Justinian, when the bap- tism of babies was established - the arms of the cross were filled in, creating a square basin. At the E side of the baptistery, another hall with two cisterns was revealed, thought to be a production unit for making wine. The combination of industrial and religious buildings is not unusual (i.e. the basilica in Kolchis of Kilkis and the basilica of Olympou Laureotikou), as churches were the centre of social and economical life in Byz times. At the S end of the production unit, a barrel-vaulted tomb with good murals depicting a foliate latin cross and an inscrip- tion was excavated; the tomb was probably that of an upper class member of the church. Ceramics from ECh to postByz were found, together with coins, parts of mosaics, glass lamps and an interesting inscribed, bronze cross which can be connected with the proce- dure of baptism. Northern and northeastern environs of Thessalonike Oraiokastro. E. Lambrothanasi-Korantzi and E. Papayianni, in AEMTH 15 (2001), 263-70, report on further excavation of this EIA (8th Ct) cemetery, probably associated with the local toum- ba. Of the 150 graves in the Palaiokastro plot, 80% are inhu- mations in trench graves with schist-slab cover; there are nine cremations in local hydrias; 60% of the graves are without grave goods, which are generally poor, with rarely more than four objects per grave. Finds consist of local hand-made pottery (phialai and cups), and bronze and (some) iron jewellery (fibu- lae, earrings and bronze omphalia covered with gold leaf). Grave 21 is the richest with 14 objects, including glass beads and bronze and iron jewellery. The enchytrismos of a sub-adult, accompanied by an iron dagger, spearhead and a flint arrow- head, is the only 'warrior grave'. Derveni, 'Gates of Liti'. Kathimerini (31/3/2004) and Ethnos (30/3/2004) report the discovery in the course of the construction of the Egnatia Odos, of an unplundered Hel (3rd Ct BC) Macedonian tomb, similar to those excavated in the early 1960s. The tomb had two chambers (2.9 x 3m; 1.7 x 2.9m), the larger having three klinai, and contained bronze phialai and oinochoai. Pots included black glaze skyphoi and W Slope ware. Stavroupoli. Ethnos (10/2/2004) provides a summary to date of excavation at this Ar-Hel cemetery, associated with the settlement (trapeza) of Lembet (see AR 2002-03, 64). Of the 278 cist, trench and sarcophagus graves excavated, 70 were of children, and 150 of women and men (many 'warriors'). Female graves include two Hel cremations with gold fibulae and earrings, one male LAr (c. 500 BC) 'warrior' grave with an Illyrian helmet, two iron spearheads, a silver pin, red figure skyphoi and one Cor exaleiptron. One (looted) sarcophagus is inscribed KQMAIO. Nea Efkarpia. E. Lambrothanasi-Korantzi, E. Papayianni and Ch. Poloukidou, in AEMTH 16 (2002), 249-56, report on the excavation of this EIA (10th8th Ct BC) cemetery in seven locations within the town. Of the 437 graves excavated, 423 are the usual 'trench' type and 14 are cremations in urns (chiefly amphoras); 40% of the graves are of children, and only 40% have grave goods. These comprise mainly hand-made local wares (e.g. one-handled cups), one painted with ProtoGeo-style pendent semi-circles. The only fineware import from S Greece is a 9th Ct BC MGeo skyphos. Metal finds include bronze and iron jewellery (finger-rings, 'spectacle' finger-rings, arm-rings, earrings and bronze omphalia covered with gold leaf), the rich- est grave being that of an adult female.

Alluvial cover in the basin of Lake Koroneia has hitherto largely obscured surface indications of Neo activity. The pits contained red monochrome, chestnut and black- burnished pottery (including two whole vessels) and (stone?) tools. Liti I: K. Tzanavari and K. Philis, in AEMTH 16 (2002), 197-210, report on excavations in two loca- tions (A and B) within the modem village, almost -i certainly the E-MNeo site previously investigated by Gardner and Casson (BSA 23 [1918-19], 13-15). In plot A (Vasileiou plot), two pits yielded quartz debitage, flint tools (blades, arrowheads and axes) and pottery. In plot B (Georganta/Despoudi), 80m SE, three small pits yielded querstones and pottery. No postholes giving any indication of any associat- ed structures were found. A statistical analysis of the copious pottery reveals a predominance of red bur- nished (42% A, 35% B), chestnut burnished (32% A, 25% B) and black burnished (15% A, 5% B) wares, painted pottery (in particular 'brown on cream') forming only 1% of the total. Perivolaki Langadas. A. Lioutas and St. Kotsos, in AEMTH 15 (2001), 195-204, report on investigations undertaken in advance of construction of the Egnatia Odos in the area of the EIA trapeza 70m S of the toumba of Saratse, excavated by Heurtley - see BSA 30 (1928-30), 113-50. Two architectural phases with stone foundations could be distinguished. Finds include stone axes, clay spindle whorls, bone tools and pottery. Pottery (all local) included hand-made jugs with cut-away necks and wheel-made 'skyphoi' decorated with pendent semi- circles. Investigations lkm W of the toumba indicated Neo activity. Nearby twelve LRom graves (6 trench, 6 tile) half those of children, yielded a variety of oinochoai and cups. Prophitis Langadas. A. Lioutas and St. Kotsos, in AEMTH 15 (2001), 187-94, report on the excavation of a sanctuary to an unknown deity, excavated in advance of the construction of the Egnatia Odos between lakes Koroneia and Volvi. Architecture comprises two phases of walls, the earlier one associated with an apothetis from which 90% of the finds were recovered. These are mainly of LAr-EHel (late 6th-late 4th Cts BC) date, and comprise pottery (principally black-glaze), terracotta fig- urines, bronze jewellery (fibulae, pins, earrings, finger-rings and pendants) and coins. One LAr (late 6th Ct) sherd is inscribed To]l) Kuapat[cK]&amp;a Etit - though this does not appear to be the name of a deity. The 10 silver coins comprise early (late 6thCct) issues of the 'Oreskioi' and 'Ichnaioi'and 5th Ct coins of Alexander I of Macedon (one inscribed TPIH). The 10 bronze coins (of Philip II, Kassandros and Antigonos Gonatas) are later. Stray finds of Rom coins (of Thessalonike and Philippi) testify to the later use of the site. Kalamoto (anc. Kalindoia). Angeliophoros (15/2/2004) notes two Rom sculptures; one a marble head of Athena, another a stone base for a bronze statue inscribed AYTOKPATOPA OEON OEOY YION TPAIANON / XEBAITON H HOAIZ.

W. Orphanos Gulf/Asprovalta. A number of sites have been investigated in advance of the construction of the Rendina-Nea Kerdyllia section of the Egnatia Odos. 67 Liotopi tou Routscheli: LCl-EHel rectilinear complex P. Adam-Veleni, in AEMTH 15 (2001), 167-79, reports on the excavation of two farm complexes. The first, at Liotopi tou Routscheli is a LCl-EHel rectilinear complex (Fig. 67), 0.35ha in extent, similar to the Vari house in Attika. The stone founda- tions of three architectural phases can be distinguished. Rooms include a 'bedroom', hall, tower, and rows of rooms arranged around an internal courtyard. The roof was of Lakonian tiles, and finds include storage pithoi, black-glaze and W Slope wares and lamps datable to the time of Antigonos Gonatas. A second, much later (LRom-EByz) and smaller (0.2ha) farm complex was found 1.5km to the E (Fig. 68). This had six architectural phases, from the 4th to the 6th Cts AD, the most elaborate being the last. The structure was well built, and furnished with a cen- tral hall (with hearth), a bath area, and outhouses, and could be dated by the associated lamps and coins. A general account of these and other farm structures in Central Macedonia is now available: P. Adam-Veleni, E. Poulaki, K. Tzanavari, Apoai?S; caypotKic?t oE ?ZyXpovo; 6p6toi);. KevcptprI MaKceovia.

Four LNeo, 2-3 EBA (including one at Liotopi tou Routscheli, see above) and 13 LBA-EIA sites have so far been identified. Excavation concentrated on the LNeo site on the hill of .. : 68 Liotopi tou Routscheli: LRom-EByz farm complex</page><page sequence="52">52 JAMES WHITLEY Platoma (wrongly located in AR 2002-03, 67). Twenty-three pits were dug over this 1.5ha site. In only one area, 120m S of the main site, were three pits associated with any architecture (stone walls). Of the 60,000 potsherds recovered, most could be paralleled with Sitagroi II and III. Grey incised and black bur- nished wares were rare, grey burnished and pale burnished wares much more common. Rarer still (ca 300 sherds) were examples of graphite painted, barbotine and Speckled and Impressed wares. There was a single 'black on red' painted amphora. Other finds include chipped (flakes and blades) and ground (axes etc) stone tools, 55 figurines (50 anthropomor- phic, 5 animal) and 16 clay stamps. Archaeobotanical investi- gation by G. Kotzamani identified wheat (triticum dicoccum), varieties of barley, grape and millet. Pig, cattle, sheep/goat and tortoise could be identified in E. Samartzidou's study of the sparse faunal material. One of these EBA settlements at Vrasna, Kakia Skala is noted by Ethnos (14/2/2004). There is mention of house remains, and a date of ca 3000 BC. NOMOS OF PIERIA (16th EPCA; 9th EBA) Makriyialos, Anc. Pydna. M. Bessios, A. Athanasiadou, et al. report, in AEMTH 15 (2001), 363-77 and 382-3, report on investigations in and around this Cl-Hel city. N cemetery (Makriyialos field 951). EIA, C1 and Hel graves are reported. The EIA graves are widely spread, and of all types (chamber, cist, and trench graves with schist plaques). In the 5th Ct BC, trench graves (some with wooden coffins) predominate, with some stone sarcophagi. Few if any graves are early 4th Ct, but in the late 4th and early 3rd Cts trench graves again predom- inate (some of children in wooden coffins), with some cist and tile graves. Finds include gold, glass and silver ornaments, one coin of Philip II and an Ar coin of Aigina, the first found in Macedonia. Apart from some 2nd Ct BC and late antique graves, the cemetery ceases after this point. Field 951. an andron with a pebble mosaic floor was found in a LC1-EHel house. Within the mosaic was the inscription YATYP[O, but it is not known whether this is the owner or the artist. Elsewhere, five deep ditches were investigated, probably part of siege works - but of which siege (432, 410, 357 or 316/15 BC) is not clear. S cemetery. In Makriyialos plot 587, twenty Hel (3rd-2nd Ct BC) graves yielded 32 bronze coins of ca 168 BC. Trench graves predominate, with 2 tile, 1 cist and one cremation in a re- used Ionic column drum. At Alykes Kitrou, 79 LCl-Hel graves in all have been investigated, all but one from the Chrysochoidi plot. Most are trench graves with wooden coffins, with some cists, and two chamber tombs, dating principally to the late 4th and early 3rd Cts BC. It is the cist tombs that stand out: tombs 47, 48, 56, 62, 70 and 71 had interior walls plastered red and white. Finds from here include gold wreaths and diadems, and glass tiles and eyes from wooden klinai. Another cist tomb had a bronze hydria of the 4th Ct BC, and another (T.66) bronze symposion vessels and a gold coin of Philip II. The most impor- tant finds came from cist grave 52, outside of which was evi- dence for a pyre laid on bricks and terracotta decoration of a wooden kline showing the departure of a warrior. Inside the chamber were a lead vessel and clay vessels, a bronze phiale, and, used as the cremation urn, an red figure Attic 'Kerch' vase. With the cremated remains (of a young woman) were a pair of gold earrings depicting griffins, a necklace of gold lions' heads and a finger-ring with a chalcedony sealstone engraved with a sheepdog. Gold ornaments were also found in two other female graves, 57 and 68. Weapons in male graves are by contrast rare, the only example being the three iron spear-heads in T.47. The only evidence for burials from the late 3rd Ct BC comes from one of the chamber tombs, constructed in the early 3rd Ct. A few 2nd Ct BC graves were also found. Makriyialos and Louloudies. E. Marki, in AEMTH 16 (2002) 427-435, reports on two Byz excavations in N. Pieria, at plot 535 in the site of anc. Pydna. These excavations revealed the following: the MByz bishop's residence of Kitros (end 10th Ct), and beneath it, the remains of two basilicas of the 6th and 4th Cts; the tower of the Lombard ruler,Wirich von Daum, which was incorporated into the sanctuary of the bishop's church, burned by the Franks in 1204, together with an under- ground gate, a cistern and workshops; parts of the N and W enclosures of the castle, dated to the 6th and 10th Cts; houses and a ceramics workshop from the Byz settlement S of the cas- tle; close to the port, a bath and an inn of 11th-12th Cts, as well as a cemetery church of the 13th Ct. Only the area around the castle, approximately 22m2, has been expropriated, so as to pro- tect the revealed antiquities from illegal constructions. Eight km further to the S, at the site of Louloudies, the opening of the new railway line in 1993 led to the discovery of two twin, barrel-vaulted tombs; the remains of a basilica and a large house -thought to be the bishop's residence; an enclosure with four towers, and remains of industrial units producing wine and oil. The site is believed to be the Rom station Mansio Anamon, on the way from Thessalonike to Larissa. The bish- opric and the local inhabitants were transferred here after the Goths occupied Pydna. Some of the antiquities found are now covered or removed, as also are the mosaics of the bishop's house. Korinos and N Pieria. M. Besios, A. Athanasiadou, I. Gourtzioumi, Z. Karanikou, E. Noulas and M. Christakou- Tolia, in AEMTH 15 (2001), 379-84, report on investigations in four locations, as a result of work on the National Road. At Makriyialos junction, a Rom drain was found. Other investiga- tions took place near Korinos. At Toumba further evidence of the BA settlement and cemetery investigated in 1993 was revealed. Settlement remains include store-rooms with settings for pithoi, BA graves being trenches with few grave goods. The investigation of five LCl-EHel graves (3 trench, 2 cist) pro- duced evidence of funerary periboloi. At Krania a LCl-EHel pottery workshop, a well, and a LCl-Hel furnace were found. At Revenia, an ENeo settlement with pits was investigated. Surface finds to the N include MNeo and LNeo sherds. Anc. Dion. D. Pandermalis and S. Pingiatoglou, in AEMTH 15 (2001), 355-61; 16 (2002), 417-25, report that a 30 x 4.9m sec- tion of an EHel stoa was uncovered, S of the sanctuary of Demeter and open to the N, with an intercolumniation of 1.9m. Finds, including coins of Philip II, Antigonos Gonatas and Kassandros, red figure kraters and lekythoi, black-glazed drink- ing vessels and terracotta figurines date the 1st phase of con- struction to the late 4th/early 3rd Ct BC. The structure was sub- sequently modified in LHel times, when transverse walls were built inside. It was destroyed in Rom (early Imperial) times. Just to the S, two rectangular Rom kilns, one of the 'Cuomo di Caprio' type, were investigated. The kilns were for firing bricks and tiles. Later investigation of the associated workshop confirmed a Severan date. Investigations of the forum area of the 'Julian colony of Dion' continued. The area is 180 x 120m in all. Within it are a basilica and several bath complexes. The N complex had a polygonal (twelve-sided) centre, approached by a large hall with apsidal niches on its narrow sides. At the entrance was a 3rd Ct AD mosaic depicting two pairs of wrestlers (see AR 2002-03,</page><page sequence="53">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2003-2004 53 67). Another bath complex was revealed at the area known as Agathi Tychi, and another with an impluvium lined with hydraulic cement on the W side. This structure had a lead drain, one of whose sections was stamped EHIFENOYE. Finds, including 97 coins, date most if not all of these structures to the Severan period. Little remains of the earlier agora of Kassandros. D. Pandermalis, inAEMTH 15 (2001), 347-54, dis- cusses the techniques of the production of the Rom (Severan, late 2nd-early 3rd Ct BC) glassware found in nearby tombs (Fig. 69). Eleftherotypia (3/11/2003) notes the discovery of a (Rom?) inscription on marble (60 x 35cm) found in the sanctuary of and in front of the statue of Zeus Hypsistos which appears to be the Macedonian (sacred?) calendar. The first Macedonian month was 'Xandikos'. S Pieria, E slopes of Mt Olympos E. Poulaki-Pandermali, in AEMTH 15 (2001), 331-46, reports on rescue excavations conducted as a result of improvements to the National Road. At Pigi Athinas an anc. road, a Rom cemetery, a Rom farm (4 rooms and a colonnade), and a Cl deposit were found. Finds from M/LBA graves include three adults buried in a tumulus, an enchytrismos, and a child's grave. Grave goods include a bronze pin, matt-painted ware, flint blades and a spindle whorl. Angeliophoros (14/2/2004) speculates that the animal buried here might be a lion. At Tria Platania a LCl-Hel farmhouse, first built in late 4th/early 3rd Ct BC and re-built in the 2nd Ct BC comprised a store-room and a kiln. Finds include black-glazed and W Slope ware and iron tools. At Kiramario a (Rom?) rectangular kiln for roof tiles was found, and at Valtos Topolianis a BA pithos burial; with finds including stone tools, an axe, blades and bronze javelin head. At Litochoro, Plaka, ten Rom (Severan) inscriptions were found, with predominantly female names (Julia Isidora, Claudia Xenariste and Ulpia) and predominantly in Greek. There is one Latin honorary inscription to the emperor (CAESAR[I A]UGUSTO OPTIMO). At Leivithra, Vakoufika, ten looted LBA (Myc?) tombs yielded Myc-style pottery, principally aryballoi. At Leivithra, Komboloi-Douvari, a LCl-Hel complex in three phases was investigated. A mid 4th Ct hearth is followed by the major con- struction phase in the late 4th/early 3rd Ct, comprising a farm- house and store-room. This phase was ended by a fire destruc- tion and roof collapse, indicated by burnt tile, clay and plaster. This horizon preserved the 32 pithoi in the storeroom, most stamped KO, one containing 8000 ytyapto. This and the finds of lekanes (for pounding), amphoras and hydrias show clearly that the complex was for grape harvesting and wine production. Other finds include black-glazed drinking vessels and olpai, lamps, lead weights and loomweights (some stamped). The complex was re-built and re-modelled in the 2nd Ct BC. Krania, Neos Panteleimonas. K. Loverdou-Tsigarida, V. Messis, E. Mastora, V. Karagianni, and M. Kontogiannopoulou, in AEMTH 15 (2001) 415-423, report on the completion of a rescue excavation that took place over four years (ended in 2001) at the so-called Hill of the Cemetery, 200m. N of the Platamon castle. The area excavated covered approximately 5,000m2 of the E and part of the S slope. An ECh cemetery and 19 LRom limekilns, part of an interesting industrial complex, were discovered. They comprise three main parts: (a) the cylin- drical firing chamber (h. 5m, di. 4m) with the grid, in which the material was placed and heated; (b) at its centre, an elongated pit that collected the ashes and funnelled them towardsan open- ing; (c) a channel carved into the slope for the deposition of the 69 Dion: Roman glassware material and free circulation of the workmen. The walls were built of rubble and bricks, to withstand the heat when the limekiln was in use. It can be estimated that 30m2 of lime were produced per firing. The complex can be dated to the end of the 4th Ct by two coin hoards. Such an industrial unit can only be explained by production intended for large-scale constructions of a big city, such as Thessalonike at the time of Galerius. Only three limekilns remained in situ, because of the opening of the new railway line. At the cemetery, 76 ECh pit- and tile-tombs were excavated. A few oil lamps, unguentaria and clay lekythia were found. The ruins of the settlement connected to the cemetery, are likely to be in the nearby area, now covered by the forest. Platamon (anc. Herakleion). Excavations have proceeded in both the PH/C1 and Byz areas in and around this site. E. Poulaki-Pandermali, in AEMTH 15 (2001), 335-40, reports on anc. Platamon Krania: deep excavation in three locations revealed a complex stratigraphy, from BA to ECh times. EBA levels comprised two enclosures and 'workshop' pits, and LBA enclosures, finds and post-hole structures have been interpreted as a bronze-working workshop. The two Geo (8th/early 7th Ct BC) structures (one apsidal) have been similarly interpreted. Finds include one trench (storage pit?) full of barley, wheat and olives and Geo pottery, principally of Thessalian-Euboean but also of Cor and E. Greek types. In the Ar phase, the area was used solely as a cemetery. The C1 phases are marked by two 5th and mid 4th Ct (probably earthquake) destruction horizons; 5th Ct finds seem consistent with a wheelwright's workshop. Four kilns were found in 4th Ct levels, at least one of which produced lekanes with relief decoration. Other C1 finds include imported Attic black glazed and red figure pots (bolsal skyphoi, 'Pheidian' cups) and 2800 coins. The Hel phases begin with walls and floors of the late 4th/early 3rd Cts BC, ending with a mid 3rd Ct destruction horizon (attributable to the Gauls?). A further destruction took place towards the end of the 3rd Ct. The final Hel phase saw the construction of a building with a peri- style interior court. To the final, 2nd Ct BC Hel destruction belong 150 stamped amphora handles (Parmeniskos group), animal and female terracotta figurines and a bronze Artemis. Finds from the Hel phases comprise loomweights, jewellery, arrow- and spear-heads. The Rom levels indicate occupation from the 2nd Ct BC destruction horizon to the 4th Ct AD and beyond. K. Loverdou-Tsigarida, B. Xanthos, A. Tokmakidou and P. Fotiadis, in AEMTH 15 (2001) 401-414, report on research in the Castle of Platamon. Because of work on the new railway</page><page sequence="54">54 JAMES WHITLEY line, excavations and restoration work took place on the S and E walls of the citadel, on the NW side of the comer tower and on the NE walls of the city. The S walls of the citadel were at first wider, built of bricks and lime, proving that an early phase may be Justinianic. An older cister, with continuous use from Cl to Hel, was also found. The need for water storage in the area of the citadel is shown by the presence of three cisterns. Above these were located two tombs of infants and, in the upper layer, remains of Post-Byz buildings. At the E walls, two amphoras found in situ identified the space as a storage room of Hel period. Near the corer tower of the citadel, two tile tombs were connected with a larger cemetery used from the 11th to 14th Cts, as shown by the ceramics. Along and inside the walls of the city were discovered a Justinianic gate, walls of an older house and most important of all, a small single-aisled church (5.50 x 3.40m), the third of the castle complex. Its murals date the church to two phases, of the 14th and 17th Cts. A narthex was added in the 17th Ct and later enlarged to accommodate tombs. In the courtyard of the new church of Agia Paraskevi, another cemetery consisting of 33 graves was revealed, one of them remarkable for containing a mother holding her baby in her arms. Of special interest is jewellery dated from MByz peri- od. In order to preserve the walls of the castle, more than 70 cracks were filled in and more than 5,800m2 were cleared. NOMOS OF CHALKIDIKE (16th EPCA; 10th EBA) Nea Kallikrateia. A. Bilouka and I. Graikos, in AEMTH 16 (2002), 375-81, report on excavation in three locations within this anc. (LAr-Cl) settlement on the coast of Krousis. At O.T. 40 foundations of a C1 large structure (11.75 x 3.5m), perhaps a stoa, were revealed. Finds of Attic red figure and black-glaze pottery, and coins of the Chalkidian Alliance, the Koinon of the Chalkidians, Bottiki [?] and Amyntas III suggest a construction date in the late 5th Ct BC. Earlier trenches suggest the area was used as a cemetery in LAr-ECl times. Some of the contents from the cleared graves may have been placed in apothetis II, including a pithos stamped with an image of an ithyphallic satyr. At O.T. 33 excavation revealed a 4th Ct BC stone-paved road, a tpq being provided by finds of a coin of the Bottiaioi, an Attic red figure fragment of the Kerch group and black-glaze lamps. A semi-subterranean 'beehive' structure contained earli- er 5th Ct material. Re-deposited EIA and Ar material (e.g. Euboean Geo sherds, an Attic black figure kylix) indicates ear- lier use as a cemetery. At O.T. 21 another large structure was built in the late 5th Ct and covered by a tile destruction horizon of the mid 4th Ct, datable by coins of the Dikaiopolitai, Akanthos and Mende. Five pits contained earlier LAr material, such as Attic black figure type C and Droop cups, a black fig- ure kalpis and a bronze vessel handle (perhaps too from cleared graves). In all, investigations suggest the anc. Ar-Cl settlement covered 15ha at its greatest extent. Siviri Kassandras. E.B. Tsigarida, Ch. Augeros and I. Mavroeidi, in AEMTH 16 (2002), 385-90, report on excavation of an EBA settlement on the small hill of Vayia (Triandaphyllidi plot). Both trenches revealed stone wall foun- dations. Pottery (principally phiales, cups and pithoi) and flint blades and cores find their best parallels in other EBA sites in N Greece. Valta (mod. Kassandreia), Prophitis Ilias (S of village). L. Toska and G. Chatzakis, in AEMTH 15 (2001) 161-166, report on the excavation of a Byz cemetery here. Valta is known from the 16th Ct when it was granted to the eunuch of the Ottoman palace Gazanfer Aga. From that time, it became an important commercial and religious centre. Rescue excavation has revealed 71 tombs. The dead were buried in pits covered with stone or brick slabs, and normally oriented E-W, with the hands crossed across the chest. In a few circumstances, a tile was used as a pillow and the sides of the tomb were marked by stones. Some of the female skeletons had jewellery dating to the 15th Ct, such as bronze earrings, rings, bracelets and accessories of dresses and shoes. Ceramics were also found, dating from ECh to the 15th Ct, as well as coins of the 15th Ct -only two of them belonged to the time of the Komnenian dynasty. Inexplicable and hitherto unrecorded are the nails tacked to the teeth of four skulls. The excavation finds led to the conclusion that the ceme- tery was used for over ten centuries (ECh-15th Ct). It is believed to be connected with a possible 'Kato Chora' village, which may be the older settlement of Valta, inhabitants of which came from Apano Chora. Further research will demon- strate this assumption, upsetting the recent theory that the Kassandra peninsula was almost deserted. Mt Athos. I. Papangelos and S. Paliobeis, in AEMTH 16 (2002), 391-405, report on Pre-Ch antiquities found on the Athos Peninsula. It is known that the anc. Athos peninsula was named Akti, and Herodotos, Thucydides and Skylax refer to six anc. cities -Dion, Olofyxos, Akrothooi, Kleonai, Thyssos, and Haradrous that the writers try to identify, following the route of Herodotos, from lerissos to Ouranopolis. Platys Limen is a secure port on the Akanthios gulf, with ruins and potsherds of Cl period, and may be identified as the city of Dion. Mikre Samareia on a hill above Hilandar monastery, where there are ruins of buildings, fortifications, potsherds and tombs can be identified as the city of Olophyxos. The area of Vatopedi Monastery must have been an important ancient city, judging by the great number of anc. architectural members which are built to the walls of the monastery con- structions. Kaliagra, the coastal area between Stavronikita and Iviron monasteries is full of ruins of house walls, potsherds and small artefacts of Cl or Hel periods. Statues and ruins of a tem- ple of Neptune have been located near to Iviron monastery, and can be identified with the city of Kleonon. The Great Lavra can be hypothetically identified with the city of Akrothooi. At Vigla, on a hill above the hermitage of Agios Ioannis Prodromos there are ruins of ancient fortifications and pot- sherds. Many architectural members are also found in the area of the Hermitage of Agia Anna. Important objects found in the sea include two LAr (late 6th Ct) Cor bronze helmets, possibly connected with the Persian expedition of 492 BC (Hdt. 6.34). The port of Kastamonitou monastery must have been an important city, perhaps Thyssos, as suggested by the ruins of fortifications, foundations of houses and the surface ceramics. A great number of C1-Hel objects (statues, coins, tomb- stones, ceramics, sarcophagi, architectural members, inscrip- tions, oil lamps, marble slabs) are to be found in the monaster- ies of Vatopedi, Great Lavra, Saint Panteleimon, Docheiariou, Hilandar, Iviron, Saint Paul, Xiropotamou, Gregoriou, Koutloumusiou, Stavronikita, Esfigmenou, Pantokratoros, Kastamonitou and the Athonias School. Apogevmatini (25/1/2004), Eleftheri Ora (21/1/2004), To Vima (26/1/2004) and Kathimerini (13/11/2003) note underwater investigations by the EMA on possible Ar wrecks around the peninsula, possibly assocated with Mardonios' expedition of 493/2 BC (see Agia Anna above).

Valla, in ADelt B Chron 52 (1997), 844-5, reports on joint Greek-Bulgarian excavation and geophysical prospection at this LNeo site (see AR 2002-03, 67). Posthole structures of phase III (with hearth) and phase II were revealed. For the 2001 season, Ch. Koukouli-Chrysanthaki, I. Aslanis and M. Valla, in AEMTH 15 (2001), 75-82, report that more posthole structures with hearths of phases I and II were excavated. Sherds from a phase II destruction horizon include bitumen-painted, trichrome painted and 'black-topped' graphite wares. Other finds include quemstones, flint blades, small mar- ble fragments, male and female anthropomorphic terracotta fig- urines and Spondylus shells. Of particular importance are clay crucibles, securely dated to phase II (1St half of 5th mill. BC), providing early evidence for copper working. Phaia Petra Siderokastrou, Kokkina Vrachia. M. Valla and S. Triandaphyllou report in AEMTH 16 (2002), 157-70 on excava- tion and osteological study of the LBA cemetery. Two rectilin- ear stone settings with stone coverings were excavated. The first contained a central inhumation covered with cloth remains set with small bronze nails buried with four pots. The inhuma- tion in the second was accompanied by a bronze spearhead, three arrowheads and nine vessels (pots), including an import- ed Myc (LH IIIB1) stirrup jar (Fig. 70). One of these vessels contained the remains (cremated at 800? Celsius) of a 30-year- old woman, and a 'kantharoid' vessel contained a child accom- panied by an amber necklace. There are indications that sec- ondary burial was practised here. Demetritsi. S. Doukata (ADelt, 889) reports on Demetritsi, one of the few settlements of Serres that kept its original Byz name. The site was first mentioned in Niketas Choniates text about the battle of Alexios Komnenos against the Normans. The Byz location of the village is situated 1km NW of modem Demetritsi, as numerous glazed potsherds from the 12th-6th Cts attest. Serres, Museum. M. Valla (ADelt, 847) notes the acquisition of three Rom inscriptions from churchyards in Serres. Two are tombstones of the 3rd-2nd Cts AD, one a stele giving details of the boundaries of the Rom colonia of Philippi. A. Bakirtzis (ADelt, 884-885) reports on restoration work on the porch of the Ahmet Bey mosque where an attempt was made to place some architectural members in their original positions (the large marble stones of the comer, the columns with their capitals). The insulation of the dome of the Tzitzinrle mosque against water was completed, as well as restoration of the roof. S. Dadaki (ADelt, 891-2) reports on excavations at the med. fortifications. Due to the replacement of the old drainage net of the city, excavation research had to be carried out at two points: at the junction of Orpheos and Constantinople, where part of the wall of rubble and brick which belonged to the E part of the enclosure was revealed to a length of 7m; and at O. I. Dragoumis, where part of the wall was discovered. Trenches revealed a LRom, ECh and LByz layers. To a depth of 1.70m a steady layer of small stones, sand and lime formed a kind of insulation and a way to strengthen the structure, dated to the LByz period. Among glazed potsherds of 12th-14th Cts found, bases of bowls with a hole at the bottom, opened in a later stage, were notable. 70 Kokkina Vrachia: grave goods E of Serres. Eleftheros Typos (11/12/2003) notes 51 Ar-Hel graves at Neos Skopos. M. Valla (ADelt, 845-6) notes recent discoveries at Pentapoli, Peristergia: 10 Rom graves (1 cist, 1 tile, 8 trench), seven with coins of 3rcL4th Cts AD; at Nea Zichni, Kokkoras, a MHel trench grave with black-glaze kan- tharos; at Langada, a LCl-EHel trench grave with W Slope ware; and 500m NE of the toumba, six pits with Hel-Rom tile and pots; at Mesorrachi, an anc. drain; at Gazoros, ten LAr-Cl graves (7 cist, 3 trench), the single unplundered LAr cist grave containing a Cor exaleiptron, gold mouthpiece, iron belt and dagger, and coins (including Thasian stater). Nearby, a PH set- tlement with posthole structures and a clay hearth yielded sparse finds (flint, clay spindle whorls). Incised pottery suggest links with the Balkan EBA Baden culture. Angista. S. Doukata (ADelt, 888-889) reports the discovery of a part of an underground barrel-vaulted arcade which was located near the hill Paliokostra, 1km NE of Angista village. It is likely to have belonged to the drainage system of the village; the walls were built of mortar and brick. Similar constructions are usual at a number of medieval sites. Amphipolis, city. D. Malamidou (ADelt, 839-41) reports on excavation in five locations: at the Kyprianidou plot, a house with two phases, the former (LCl-EHel, late 4th early 3rd Cts) having an eschara, settings for for pithoi and a lime-plaster floor, the latter MHel (3rd-2nd Cts) with few finds; at the Kochliaridi plot, an M-LHel house and four LRom tile graves; at the Museum a Cl (5th-4th Cts) complex. Further investigation of the Hel house, on the S slopes, yielded plaster wall decora- tion in low relief (Fig. 71) and more evidence for wall paint- ings. The Rom cemetery yielded 14 more graves (7 cist, 7 tile), one cist grave containing a bronze medical instrument and sil- ver ring with sealstone. Of the two Rom grave stelai, one depicted a funerary perideipnon, another showed a gladiator named Zooxapt in low relief and can be dated to 165 AD. P. Malama and A. Salonikios, in AEMTH 16 (2002), 145-55, report on the excavation of a further LCl-LHel house close to the Kyprianidou plot: though there is no outside wall, the struc- ture was clearly a courtyard house, first built in the late 4th Ct and well-supplied with drains. Its central court had a well and plain mosaic (pebble) floor, around which rooms (including an andron) were set. Tile collapse in many areas had preserved much painted plaster from the walls. Associated finds, princi-</page><page sequence="56">56 JAMES WHITLEY 71 Amphipolis: plaster wall decoration pally of the 2nd-lst Cts BC include stamped amphora handles (all from Amphipolis and the N Aegean) and multiple nozzle lamps. A seated terracotta Cybele, clay altar and marble figures of Artemis (?) and Asklepios (?) suggest domestic cult. Dates are provided by coins, principally bronzes of Thessalonike and Amphipolis, but also ofMaroneia. Pella and Rhodes. Coins also include issues of the following kings of Macedon: Philip II, Alexander III, Demetrios Poliorketis, Antigonos Gonatas, Philip V and Perseus. A. Bakirtzis (ADelt, 885) reports on restoration works in the Byz tower, built in 1367 and part of the N wall of which fell into ruins in the spring of 1997. The tower (10.70 x 10m) had spolia of ancient architectural members incorporated in its walls. The Ephorate managed to save the W wall of the tower, which was the only one left at a height of 5m. The masonry was fully restored, with new joint fillings. E cemetery. P. Malama, in AEMTH 15 (2001), 111-26, reports on further excavation of the Cl-ERom cemetery, to the N, E and SE of the anc. town. More sections of the Rom acqueduct to the N were uncovered. Two Hel-Rom inscrip- tions, one a grave stele inscribed IIOAA NIKANQPOE, another of the 3rd Ct AD written in both Latin and Greek, ALFIA- CLUCE AA4IA T... AIEA/ AAIOY FAYKYTATH. 700m to the S a LRom complex (buildings A and B, building B covered with tile collapse) had been built over earlier Cl-Hel graves. The only datable find from a rectangular Hel kiln nearby used for making tiles was a Megarian bowl. The 117 graves (of over 800) excavated in 2001 came from three locations: Section H: 82 principally Cl-EHel (late 5th-early 3rd Cts) graves include cremations, one (T45) in a bronze hydria inside a hollowed limestone setting, and containing a gold ivy wreath, others (T44 and T84) interred in Attic red figure pelikai, others cremations in trenches, T25 containing Attic white-ground lekythoi. Two inhumations bear important inscriptions. The (looted) LCl-EHel (late 4th/early 3rd Ct) limestone sarcophagus T45 contained a gold ring, coin of Philip II and a gold strip inscribed: EYAFHE IEPA AIONY / EOY BAXXIOY EIMI / APXEBOY ... H / ANTIAQPOY. Similarly the EHel (early 3rd Ct) cist grave T63 was inscribed on the inside with: STPYMOKAHE XOIPQNOE / EATYPOE ETPYMOKAEYE. Nearby was a grave in an Attic style (4th Ct BC) with a repre- sentation of a nude male, and inscribed: KPATQN MYPTAAH / XAPIKAEIOE. Section Z: The 14 MHel (3rd-2nd Cts) graves include trench cremation T7 containing a pair of gold earrings, 12 perfume flasks and a Megarian bowl. Section A: of the 16 graves here, four were 'Macedonian' style cist graves, two (Ti and T2) with wall paintings. Only the LCl/EHel T1 was unplundered. The human bones were placed on a kline, with grave goods comprising a gold stater of Philip II, a clay alabastra, a black glaze skyphos, clay beads and a bronze wreath (both covered with gold leaf), a gold olive leaf, terracotta female fig- urines and protomes, all datable to the late 4th Ct. The interior was painted with (from the bottom up) bands of yellow, white, red and black. The figures above (on the S wall, a seated woman, on the N a dove) stand on an Ionic cymation. There are also "I holes for iron nails all over the painted area, possi- bly for suspending the grave goods, but also perhaps : ,. . to help to create the illusion that the room is a 'women's quarter' (gynaikonitis). Only gold earrings were found in T2. The wall paintings from both tombs find there best parallels in those from Aineia. T93 was a Rom grave with a clay mask. Osteology: S. Triandaphyllou and P. Malama, in AEMTH 15 (2001), 127-157, present an osteological study of the human remains from 186 (17%) of the 800 recently excavated graves. Notable is the high mortality in the 30-40 age range, the rela- tively higher mortality in Cl females, the apparent absence of Hel-Rom neonates, and the higher incidence of disease in men than in women. The low incidence of caries in teeth, and high tartar levels in Cl times, probably indicates high meat con- sumption. Mouth of the Strymon River/Orphanos Gulf area Argilos, acropolis (wrongly located in Nomos of Kavalla in AR 2002-03, 68). Z. Bonias (ADelt, 837-9) reports on excavation of (Hel? or Rom?) building A (9 x 10m), whose walls survive 3m h., with a stairway, olive press, cistern and trapetum. No data- ble finds were reported. Nea Kerdyllia, Kryoneri. D. Malamidou (ADelt, 841-4) reports on rescue excavation at this LNeo-EBA settlement. Structures from the principal LNeo (Sitagroi III) phase include pits, a clay hearth and a kiln (?). LNeo finds include flint blades and arrowheads, ground-stone axes, clay spindle whorls and (loom?)weights and bone and shell jewellery; 60% of the paint- ed pottery was 'black on red', 15% 'brown on cream' (Fig. 72). Archaeobotanical and archaeozoological study confirms the use 72 Nea Kerdyllia, Kryoneri: 'brown on cream' pottery</page><page sequence="57">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2003-2004 57 of wheat, barley, pulses, cattle, birds, fish and molluscs. The sparser EBA finds include hand-made pithoi, phiales, cups and flint blades. Nea Kerdyllia, Strovolos. P. Malama and K. Darakis, in AEMTH 15 (2001), 137-48, report on excavation of 191 graves (over 60 of which had been looted) of this E-MRom cemetery 14km W of Amphipolis, excavated in advance of construction of the Egnatia Odos. The majority of the graves were inhuma- tions, 77 of them in rectangular trenches. Incomplete trench graves were used for children, who were often buried with ter- racottas (18 female, 4 bovine). There were 11 trench crema- tions, but few examples of tile, cist or larax burials. Grave goods were sparse - clay and glass vessels and simple jew- ellery. The 1500 coins found (bronze issues of Pella, Thessalonike, Amphipolis and Philippi) date the use of the cemetery from Augustus to Gordian III (238-44 AD), with a sole issue of Constantius II (337-361 AD). NOMOS OF DRAMA (18th EPCA; 12th EBA) Exochi. A. Yialouri (ADelt, 889) reports on a mosque which was located near the Greek-Bulgarian border. It consisted of a main room and an arcade at the N side; there was probably a minaret at the NW corer-now fallen into ruins. The main room (8 x 8m) had an entrance to the N. Its roof was formed by a low semispherical vault with octagonal blind tympanum. To the S wall, the mihrab was opened. The walls were built of stone and brick. The mosque was decorated inside with wall paintings depicting flowers in many colors and medallions with inscrip- tions in Arabic. From the evidence of its architecture and paint- ings, it is dated to the early Ot period. Sitagroi. A further report on this Neo toumba is now published: E.S. Elster, C., Renfrew (eds) Prehistoric Sitagroi: Excavations in Northeast Greece 1968-1970, Volume 2: Final Report. (Monumenta Archaeologica 20. Cotsen Institute of Archaeol- ogy, Los Angeles, 2003). Arkadiko (next to Drama), Chatziyiannidi plot. K. Peristeri, in AEMTH 16 (2002), 131-6, reports on further excavation of this MNeo settlement. An apsidal, two-roomed house with a clay floor, very similar to the 'burnt house' from Sitagroi, was furnished with an oven near the entrance, near to which was a circular structure. Finds include female figurines (Fig. 73), tools in flint and quartz and pithoid jars. Painted pottery includes 'brown on cream', 'black on red', graphite painted and black topped wares. 73 Arkadiko: female figurine ....... ~~~~ . - .. . I ......... &gt;| g2 Drama. K.

Potamoi Nevrokopis (N bank of Nestos river). K. Peristeri, in AEMTH 16 (2002), 137-44, reports on the excavation of three ERom (1st Ct AD) tumuli, very similar to those further E in Thrace. Tumulus 3F (26m di., 1.5m h.) was badly disturbed. Tumulus 3A (25m di., 5.5m h.) contained layers of burnt animal bones and pyre debris, beneath which were two cremations in rectangular trenches. Finds include plain pottery and a coin of Trajan. Further investigation of tumulus 3B produced four child cremations, probably secondary, in tile graves. NOMOS OF KAVALLA (18th EBA/12th EBA) Anc. Philippi. S. Provost (EFA) reports on the 2003 season of excavation and survey: 'The campaign had three aims: the completion of the geo- physical and topographic surveys of the site, and the continua- tion of excavation at the Maison des Fauves (House of the Deer). Previously reported geophysical survey at the site (AR 2001-02, 84-5; AEMTH 16 (2002), 94-106), carried out by M. Boyd of the BSA's Fitch Laboratory, consisted of a resistance survey covering most of the areas W and S of the forum. The aim for 2003 was to complete the survey E of the forum, S of the theatre. This aim was achieved, adding a further 3ha to the 14.5ha already surveyed. In tandem S. Gondet (University of Dijon) carried out a magnetometer survey of part of this area, and a part of the area already surveyed in 2001 (2.5ha in total), with the aim of comparing the results of the two techniques and hopefully adding to the information obtained from the resist- ance meter alone. Results of both techniques were generally excellent, and have allowed us to reconstruct the ancient street system com- pletely (Fig. 74). To the S of the forum, magnetic survey con- firmed the existence and internal planning of a large building, first detected in 2001, occupying an area two insulae wide, with large rooms and apses (at '7 Ouest' on Fig. 66). At the E end of the survey area, S of the Via Egnatia, detailed anomalies describe the easternmost two insulae (Fig 66: '7 Est'). South of these areas, the last row of insulae before the southern stretch of the city wall are less well defined. In the triangle formed by the theatre to the N, basilica A to the W and the Via Egnatia to the S, the interface between the two city grid systems has been detected (area 9 on Fig. 66). At the E end, four insulae are oriented according to the southern grid system, while W of these parts of three insulae on the northern grid system are visible. Between them lies a triangular area which forms the junction between them, taking up the width of two insulae toward the road. The topographic survey, carried out by L. Fadin, had as its main goal the completion of the plan of the circuit walls. Measurements were also taken on the Byz kastro on the acrop- olis and the main monuments on the slopes: the diateichismata, aqueduct, and theatre. Several areas remain to be recorded. The third excavation campaign in the Maison des Fauves (House of the Deer) (Fig. 75, see AR 2001-02, 84-5; AEMTH 15 (2001), 107-18) aimed to complete the excavation of rooms opened during recent years and to continue the exploration of wing C (east, Fig. 76). Emphasis was placed on the later MByz occupation layers, hitherto poorly recorded. In C10, the room in the NE comer of the building, the exca- vation of the balk on the northwest side revealed the continua-</page><page sequence="58">58 JAMES WHITLEY 74 Philippi: site B3 75 Philippi: 'House of the Deer' tion of this MByz level, discovered in 2002 in the S half of the room and containing a circular hut with a fireplace. The continuation of the MByz level com- prised a row of post-holes and a floor covered in ^ reused marble slabs, lying flat, above the entrance of the anc. building. Complete cleaning of the geometric mosaic with irregular tesserae, which constitutes the floor of C10, has revealed a great variety of decorative motifs, including interwoven circles and, to the N, a more colourful motif of crosses and octagons. This room was evidently decorated with particular care, because the N wall bore traces of plaster with red and white geometric decoration. This wall plaster is :' i :i contemporary with the mosaic and represents the last main phase of reconstruction of the house, ten- t I tatively dated to the mid 4th Ct AD. t : ~ Excavations proceeded anew on the central court of wing C3 (Fig. 77) in order to restore the cistern (C31), which occupies the greater part of this area (whose E side had collapsed since excavation in 1935). The removal of bricks, previously thought to i?'t i: I. be the remains of a floor in the NE comer of the room, showed that these were in fact the dismantled bases of pilettes (i.e. small pillars of tile used in hypocausts) which belonged to a row of another 6 pilettes, discovered in a very poor state of preserva- tion. This group ofpilettes is located in a rectangu- lar area (in the background in Fig. 69), between the doors to C1 and C4, and is bordered by a small rough wall, of which almost nothing remains. The floor is cov- ered by hydraulic plaster. This hypocaust has an opening towards the S, but the presence of a very late lead conduit in situ prevented further excavation. Only further excavation will explain the presence and the function of this unexpected instal- lation, which does not seem connected to the cistern. Trenches were opened in three new rooms (from N to S: C4, C7 and C9) at the E fagade of the building, along the side street RS2. None of these rooms is connected to the street and their only entrances are sited to the W, i.e. the court C3 and the cor- ridor C32. Their stratigraphy is very similar to that of C10, with a sequence of thick layers (either colluvial or destruction layers) resting on the LRom floor, of beaten earth, which represents the level at which excavation work ceased in the three rooms. A MByz occupation level was found in C4 (as was the case in C10 and at an equivalent level), consisting of a trench along the E wall of the building, and several post holes whose arrangement suggest the existence of a cantilever roof (?) or of a shelter which leaned against the remains of the same wall. The pottery which has been found is comparable with that of C10. C7, the adjacent room towards S, contains identical material in small quantities but has no identifiable associated structures. Nevertheless, near the partition wall which divides this room from C4, we found, in the same occupation level, a lead seal, which belongs to a drongarius of Rhodes. Typologically this bulloterion is probably earlier than 850 AD. The discovery of the seal and the limited duration of the occupation suggests that these huts were elements of a military camp inside the anc. city at the time of the Bulgaro-Byzantine wars.' A. Yialouri (ADelt, 884-886, 892) reports on an excavation carried out N of the phiale of basilica B at Phillipi in 1992. Workshops, stores and part of a cemetery were revealed. Further restoration of the monuments of the baptistery, the bath and the atrium of the guest-houses around the octagon contin- ued. The upper surfaces of the walls were made steadier by fill- ing in with new material.</page><page sequence="59">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2003-2004 59 G. Karadedos and Ch. Koukouli-Chrysanthaki report excavation and restoration work at the theatre in Philippi, in AEMTH 15 (2001), 83-109; see also AR 2001-02, 85; 2002-03, 68. A section (B) through the E wall confirms the following architectural ? ' sequence: the earliest (LC1) phase of the theatre dates to the 2nd half of the 4th Ct BC, contemporary with the earliest fortification, confirmed by finds of black glaze pottery, bronze coins of Philippi and a 'I coin of Philip I. At this stage the cavea was no more than stone seats on the slope above the orchestra. A ,'-.aL coin of Philip V and a Megarian bowl fragment (3rd-2nd Ct BC) seem to represent an MHel rebuild- ing. A stone skene was added in the 2nd Ct AD (Rom phase 1), and in the 3rd Ct (Rom phase 2) the orches- 1 tra was turned into an arena and the cavea extended upslope. The cavea was further extended in the 4th - j i Ct AD (Rom phase 3), cutting the earlier city wall. In ECh (early 5th Ct) times the arena was re-con- . verted to an orchestra (i.e. to a theatre, not an arena). The theatre was badly damaged in the late 6th Ct AD, and not used (as a theatre) thereafter. Reconstruction work also took place on the E. Parodos and S Stoa. Ch.

The monument has suffered the consequences of a high volume of traffic, as it is on the main route to Xanthi. New joint-fillings were made and the old mortar removed. Podochori. S. Doukata (ADelt, 889-890) reports on the Ot bath, part of an Ot building complex which included a medresse and a mosque (now demolished), located at the NW of Podochori village. The bath (6.60 x 4.50m) consisted of a rectangular hall (3.10 x 1.60m) roofed with a barrel vault, and a main room. The two entrances were at the S and E sides, decorated with brick pointed arches. There were many niches in the walls for placing soaps and clothes. The room was used as a sogukluk, a place where the visitors remained before taking their bath. It was heated by clay conduits allowing hot water to circulate in the walls. The main room (3.05 x 3m), the so-called if hamam, was covered with a vault built of brick. Here too there were niches 76 Philippi: 'House of the Deer', wing C 77 Philippi: 'House of the Deer', central court in the walls to hold the necessary bath.

W of the city, in the Zagorianou plot, two LRom structures, the first with two rooms and an early 4th Ct AD destruction horizon of clay floor plaques, seem to belong to a single complex of the 3rd-4th Cts AD, as does a section of mosaic floor. The principal find here is a LRom (early 4th Ct AD) inscribed statue base honouring one Julius Aurelius Valerius Herakleonas. Near the Gate of Zeus and Hera (Geka plot) a room and yard of a LHel-MRom work- shop with an (olive? vine?) press was in use from the 2nd Ct BC until the 2nd Ct AD.

Markus Kohl, Arthur Muller (EFA), Giorgos Sanidas and Marina Sgourou (18th EPCA) report on re-investigation of trench G in the Kokkinos plot: 'Finds from the 1960s excavations were re-examined. Olivier Picard (EFA) identified 19 coins predominantly from filling 02.101. The coins constitute a heterogeneous group, which goes from Cl to LRom times. Valerie Pichot (EFA) re- examined the EAr slags produced by metallurgic activities. These slags seem to represent a blacksmith's forge and result from the fabrication of iron objects). The question of the uti- lization of shells (to help with the process of fusion) is still open. Laurent Lespez (EFA) undertook analysis of the thin sec- tion samples (taken in October 2002 from the deep strata of the trench) and micromorphological analysis. Layers W2 and Y (earthy and dark in character), like layers W1, X and Z (so labelled in the 1960s, since they were predominantly of gravel and sand), may also have been of colluvial origin. Gilles Sintes (EFA) has compared the data from Laurent Lespez's report with data concerning the natural environment before the occupation of the site. And finally, Francois Poplin (EFA) has identi- fied the bone remains collected in the trench. Limited cleaning (particularly of the section), was undertaken, and also consolidation and re-exca- vation of trench G (Fig. 78). The topographical rela- tionship to the adjacent Valma plot was re-assessed and re-planned. New architectural plans were under- taken, and the stratigraphical sequence re-assessed. This required verification of the stratigraphical read- ing of the elevated sections of the visible walls and analysis of the late antique layers. We have been able to highlight the existence of two robbed walls which explain the stratigraphical breaks, and identi- fy two phases of recovery (the first one in late antiq- uity, the second much more recent). We also gained a detailed impression of the micro-history of the site, in relation to the contemporary phases which have been observed in the Valma plot (i.e. a history of the the- atre street and of its Eastern nearby constructions). On the other hand, for the more ancient periods, we observed a chronologi- cal interruption between the Greek period (Hel?) and the LRom period (to which the construction of the drain-pipe is datable). Lastly, we have not been able to solve the problem of the floor of the first room, bordered by wall A, for which the stratigraphy remains mute.' Limenas, Macellum of Thasos. Jean-Yves Marc (Universit6 Marc Bloch /EFA) reports: 'The main aim of the campaign was to complete the expo- sure of the borders of the courtyard of the macellum, so we car- ried out extensive, mechanized clearing operations. The SW and NW sides have now been entirely exposed, giving complete plan of the building (Fig. 79). We also cleared the important sector between the SE building and the Court of 100 Flagstones and did more modest excavation in the courtyard proper. The macellum comprised a square court, ca 28m 1., bordered at the SE and SW by five-room buildings, at the NW by a more modest and undoubtedly later wing, and at the NE by the back wall of the porches surrounding the agora; the courtyard was surrounded by an Ionic colonnade (on the NW, SW and SE sides). We exposed the foundations of the colonnade and the blocks of the stylobate have been identified with the great mar- ble blocks re-used in the late group of structures forming the NW wing. Scraping of the entire sector up to the Court of 100 Flagstones revealed a series of walls, probably of the macellum itself, which allow us to see this building in its monumental form; it also renders the function of the Court of 100 Flagstones more comprehensible.Of the rooms of the SE side, only room 2 was cleaned this year; we left in situ the berme against the back wall of the first room. After emptying the filling of an old trial trench we found that room 2 had the same stratigraphical sequence as the nearby rooms: a series of sand sediments derived from the decomposi- tion of gneiss, which piled up after the destruction of a part of the elevations. Some scattered elements indicating destruction (fragments of painted plaster and remains of marble slabs) were found below the ground level, composed of a layer of opus signinum resting on a covering of pebbles distributed in a hedgehog pattern (as is the case with the ground level found in the other rooms of the S-E side). A dumping ditch was cut into</page><page sequence="61">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2003-2004 61 this soil in the SW corner of the room. We were able to deter- mine, as with the rooms on the SW side, that the walls in opus caementicium (datable to the Tmperial phase of the building) rested on regular courses of marble and gneiss, an additional indication of an anc. occupation of this sector. Every room of the SW side was investigated anew this year, but given the nature of the discoveries, we were unable to com- pletely explore this side of the macellum. In room 6, we used a gap in the terracotta floor slabs to excavate a small trial trench along the fagade wall. Directly below the floor we found a floor in opus signinum, almost identical to a similar feature found in the SE rooms, made of a layer of tile mortar, with rough inclu- sions of crushed terracotta resting on a stratum of pebbles. Although the level of the water-bearing stratum inhibited deep- ening of the trench, we could nevertheless note that, under these floors, the wall masonry was dramatically different from the opus caementicum of the walls still visible. The masonry under the floors was, in fact, composed of regular courses of marble and gneiss, again indicating Hel occupation. In the nearby room 7, the entire fagade wall had been revealed during the excavation of a modern trench, and it only remained for us to excavate the archaeological layers in place. We were unable to do this, but cleaning the layers allowed us to recognize the remains of a collapsed roof and ceiling. Regular traces of rafters and wooden thatch formed a depression in the centre of the room, as if the roof had been perforated at its centre 80 Limenas, Macellum of Thasos: room 8 before collapsing, causing the tiles to fall in a funnel formation - and suggesting why, during the previous campaign, we found a great pile of tiles in the central part of the room but not along the walls. Lastly, we found traces (in form of post holes, which may be associated with the rough wall built against the facade of the rooms) of the late occupation of this sector under the destruction layer. Excavation of this destruction layer has been postponed for another campaign. In room 8, we began emptying a modern trench (probably an archaeological trial trench of the 1 920s AX g which explored the SW corner of the building). The X archaeological layers in place were only preserved / in the SE half (Fig. 80) and the sequence (from the W top to the bottom) consisted of: the destruction of g the roof (tegulae and imbrices) and the collapse of / the walls; a thin layer of abandonment; a floor in &lt; terracotta slabs. These two stratigraphical entities, / the destruction layer of the fallen roof and the col- f ^ apsec wa s, were separatecl ty a sanc W c eposlt, con- X firming the complex nature of the late phases of the \ building and the difficulty of assessing successive &lt; \ phases of occupation, rearrangement and abandon- % &lt; ment. :i; t X At least two other rooms were located in the SW :0050:0000zi0tf corner. Previous excavations conducted in room 9 d i&lt;ERERERERERERES,9f i i iE*;Cv :0 revealed the walls but often did not reach the level r* iEEEEEEEEiEEEEE! i #!:: of the terracotta slab floor.

We wanted to identify the limits of the marble flooring and to establish a relation between the stratigraphi- XXXXXQ tt cal sequences close to the rooms and those of the 3 ; 0 centre of the court. Although the presence of water 79 Limenas: Macellum of Thasos</page><page sequence="62">62 JAMES WHITLEY 81 Thasos, Artemision: votive objects prevented us from making any stratigraphical observations we were nevertheless able to discover, at each end of the trench, a foundation block parallel to the walls of the rooms. This impor- tant discovery directed our attention to the great marble blocks of the stylobate, distributed along a line parallel with the NW wall of the macellum. Although these blocks (set with more or less care in front of some of the very late partition walls) had already been identified as reemployed, we had no reliable evi- dence concerning their function or their original position. The foundation blocks found this year indicated their possible posi- tioning. This hypothesis, which cannot be confirmed until clear- ing work is completed, allows us to suppose that there was a colonnade on at least two sides (NW and SE) of the central courtyard of the macellum. There is no doubt that there was a similar structure in front of the rooms, on the SW side; we have still to explore the NE side. Judging from the traces left by the column bases it appears that this colonnade (to which we could assign the fragments of a denticulate cornice discovered in the courtyard) was Ionic in style. We may add then, to our reconstructed image of the Thasian macellum a well-appointed court with porches on at least three sides, paved in marble, linked conceptually as well as material- ly with the nearby Court of 100 Flagstones. The scattering of a thick layer of topsoil between the rooms of the SW side of the macellum and the Court of 100 Flagstones suggests that the two structures form part of a unique and unified building pro- gramme. Before we could excavate the last comer of the macel- lum it was necessary to to remove this soil layer, an operation that, though unplanned at the start, produced important results. In addition to the discovery of 10 supplementary rooms, it gave us a better understanding of the relation between the court dis- covered in the 1930s and the building that we have been exca- vating since 1996: an architectural complex, comprising at least two courts of different dimensions (but of similar style) and rooms for commercial or craft activities. Only exhaustive exca- vation of this sector will clarify these structures and, above all, indicate a chronology for the walls in a site where occupation of six or seven centuries has made analysis and interpretation problematic. Preliminary analysis of the plan of the rooms discovered this indicates two structures: the first opening onto the macellum, the second onto the Court of 100 Flagstones, separated by a rec- tangular area (possibly opening into the corridor connecting the Court of 100 Flagstones with the macellum) and today repre- sented only in a very late phase during which it was divided by a partition wall. The principal results of this year's campaign are that we have been able to identify the plan and function of successive buildings from Hel to late antiquity in this part of the monu- ment. It has now been proved that during the Early Empire the monumental centre of Thasos was the civic square surrounded by a continuous colonnade, to the S of which lay an important craft and/or commercial sector, including the SE shops (along the street of the Charites sanctuary), the macellum and the Court of 100 Flagstones which connected the macellum with the street and with another complex of rooms, SE of the street. The utilitarian nature of the complex during the Imperial period is beyond question because of the typological data (court build- ing with a pit in its centre and rooms behind a colonnade), the architectural data (floors or thresholds characteristic of shops) and the archaeological data (discovery of sekomata throughout this sector). This year's campaign also allowed us to establish that an earlier building had been integrated into the Imperial building, since elements of walls of Hel masonry appeared almost every- where under the walls in opus incertum and that during the pri- mary monument phase the area of the agora may have extend- ed up to the area of the Court of 100 Flagstones. During the ECh period, however, commercial activities were at least partially terminated and replaced by craft-based activities, as is indicat- ed by the hearths discovered in some rooms, the characteristic joints of pieces of wood in some walls and the mill-stone coun- terweights. Among incidental discoveries may be noted a very well-preserved phallus in marble, which probably belonged to a choregic monument.' Clarisse Pretre (EFA) and Fr. Poplin (Natural History Museum, Paris) report on further study of votive objects in ivory and bone (of deer and other animals) from the Artemision (Fig. 81): 'Following a preliminary microscopic analysis of all 120 objects, and having ascertained the compositional character of each piece, we completed a detailed description of each object (in terms of process of manufacture and function) in order to generate a comparative stylistic context for the purposes of study. We found serious errors in the previous account of these objects (compiled during the period of the excavations), since only one-third of the pieces were made of ivory and not two- thirds, as was stated in previous reports. This fact completely changes our perception of the votive practices of this sanctuary, where the value of the offering is determined not by the materi- al of which it is composed but by the manufacturing process. We have also determined that it was apparently common prac- tice to reproduce, in bone and deer-horn, ex-votos which were originally made of ivory. In parallel to determining the provenance of imported pieces (Melian, or, more generally, oriental in style) our study of the working (i.e. cutting) of these pieces has demonstrated that though there may not have been actual workshop installations for the production of pieces there were, at least, some areas (of a shop-type) in which the artisans cut and adjusted small objects which were to be offered as ex-votos in the sanctuary of Artemis. We have yet to establish whether ivory was imported on a regular basis or whether there were resident artisans. Furthermore, we have still to determine whether pilgrims arrived at the site with prefabricated pieces or if, conversely, they arrived with the primary materials from which an ex-voto of their choice would have been cut. It is in fact surprising to note the variety of original pieces which have been unearthed by the excavations. We also identified some production techniques that were not previously well known. It seems that the Thasian artisans used an elliptical lathe, since a great number of pieces in deer horn and bone were of a very clean ovoid shape which cannot be</page><page sequence="63">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2003-2004 63 attributed to later deformation or damage. Although most of the objects are characteristic of female sanctuaries (we have exact parallels in other sites), a great number of pieces are quite inno- vative in character. At the conclusion of the study of the mate- rial from the Artemision, it will be interesting to speculate as to whether or not dedications were produced locally and, conse- quently, to determine whether the artisans of Thasos specialized in the working/production of votive offerings. Publication of these objects is scheduled to appear at the end of 2003.' Yvon Garlan (EFA) reports on further study of amphora stamps: 'An article provisionally entitled 'Deriers regards sur les ateliers amphoriques de Thasos', completed in draft, covers four topics: the workshop of Molos (with Marina Sgourou and Stratos Papadopoulos); the amphora workshop of Chioni (with Chrysa Karadima-Matsa); re-examination of the Thasian work- shops (with Michele Brunet) and, lastly, the chronology of the main Thasian workshops.' Agios Ioannis (SE of the island). S. Papadopoulos, G. Aristodemou, D. Kougioumtzoglou and Ph. Megaloudi, in AEMTH 15 (2001), 55-65, report that at Agios Ioannis, after the removal of historical layers (6th Ct BC-6th Ct AD) Final Neo levels were reached. Architecture consists of an oven with clay floor and cooking equipment and curved stone walls. Two stone built (schist and gneiss) graves contained no grave goods. Apart from some ground-stone axes and clay (loom?)weights there were few tools of any kind. The pottery, mainly plain spherical vessels, sometimes with applied decoration, is contemporary with Sitagroi phase IV. C14 samples provide dates of between 3600-3000 BC. Skala Sotiros (NW of the island). S. Papadopoulos, G. Aristodemou, D. Kougioumtzoglou and Ph. Megaloudi, in AEMTH 15 (2001), 55-65, report that a new trench was opened close to the church/small hill of Prophitis Ilias. A 12m stretch of the 2m w. outer wall of the settlement was traced, and EBA clay floors reached. The plain phiales and other pottery is con- temporary with Emborio (Chios) phases IV and V and Thermi (Lesvos) phases III and IV and should date to ca 2400-2100 BC. An unusual find is an engraved stone axe. Limenaria, Liouda plot. S. Papadopoulos and D. Malamidou, inADeltB Chron 52 (1997), 836-7, report on further excavation of this LNeo settlement. The pits, pots, clay hearth and post holes seem to date to the earliest phase. L. Lespez and S. Papadopoulos, in AEMTH 16 (2002), 47-56, report on the results of geomorphological and palaeoenviron- mental work on these and other sites on Thasos. THRACE NOMOS OF XANTHI (19th EPCA; 12th EBA) Anc. Abdera. K. Kallinitzi and D. Triandaphyllos, in ADelt B Chron 52 (1997), 851-68, 877-9, report that in the anc. ceme- tery in the region of the mod. village of Veloni, 61 LAr-MHel graves have been fully explored, and 98 more revealed, but not fully described. Of the 61 graves, types include inhumations in cist graves (13 examples), stone sarcophagi (9), clay sarcopha- gi (15, including some examples of 'Clazomenian sarcophagi'), pithos burials (3), tile graves (6), clay larakes (2), simple trenches (6), trench cremations (2) and one enchytrismos. Most finds date from the late 6th to 4th Ct BC. Grave goods are gen- erally sparse, and include Ionian cups and black figure lekythoi. Osteological examination reveals a distinct bias toward males of the 30-45 age group. Of the Cl graves, the richest is a 4th Ct pithos burial (96.05 grave 1) of a 30-35 year old male accom- panied by a gold crown, iron objects, iron knife and a coin of Maroneia (398-85 BC). But the outstanding grave is a MHel male'warrior' inhumation (97.25) in a cist grave, accompanied by gold olive crown, perfume flasks, iron sword and spearhead, and datable to 200-150 BC. Objects of glass, clay and two mar- ble grave stelai from the cemeteries have also been discovered and handed in by local people. An anc. road was investigated. Lophos ton Skinon. Surface investigation suggests anc. (Cl?) house remains. Polystylon. S. Doukata (ADelt, 893-894) reports on the exposure of the lateral wall of the Byz fortification that sepa- rates the city into two parts. It stood up to 2.50m at its highest point and it was preserved for 1.45m 1. and 3.10m w. Six tow- ers strengthened the outside surface. This was the third protec- tive wall, as was usual in the medieval system of fortification. Foundations of walls from buildings related to the settlement were excavated. Glazed pottery of 12th-13th Cts and spolia from ancient buildings were found. Mangana, Dasyllio. K. Kallinitzi (ADelt, 877-8) reports on sur- face investigation. Finds of tile and glass suggest that this is a Byz cemetery. NOMOS OF RHODOPI (19th EPCA; 12th EBA) Paradimi (near Komotini). D. Matsas &amp; D. Triandaphyllos (ADelt, 868-71, 880) report on survey and limited excavation in this Neo toumba, from the surface of which Neo figurines have been recovered. Beneath a thick clay layer containing LNeo flint blades, perhaps representing fallen walls, a clay floor level with a hearth and some painted pottery was reached. Anc. Stryme. D. Triandaphyllos (ADelt, 871-2) reports on excavation in two locations. Within the archaiologikos choros, a LRom (4th-5th Cts AD) stratum contained Cl sherds as well as LRom pots and coins. Beneath this was a rectilinear structure covered by a tile destruction layer, dated by coins of Maroneia (398-365 BC). Underneath the foundations were late 6th-early 5th Ct potsherds. At Mitriko, a Cl tumulus (44m di., 5m h.) was found to have two looted cist graves and a trench grave con- taining the bones of a young woman. Grave goods included black glaze pottery, a lead pyxis, glass beads and a bronze ring. Burnt animal bones probably represent the remains of a funer- ary perideipnon. Another pit contained 5th Ct BC Attic red fig- ure pots and white-ground lekythoi. D. Terzopoulou (ADelt, 879-80) noted two marble gravestones, one inscribed APIETAI HPOBOAO. Nea Stryme. D. Triandaphyllos (ADelt, 880) notes the dis- covery of a marble statue. Maroneia, Polemos. D. Triandaphyllos (ADelt, 880) notes a Hel marble grave stele, inscribed HpaoS / [A]pugotox) / yovr. Agios Charalambos. N. Kokkotaki (ADelt, 872-3) reports on excavation of several walls of a M-LRom structure; square (1 x lm) stone settings are probably roof supports. Finds include tiles, iron nails, glass vessels, lamps of the 3rd 4th Cts AD and 22 Rom-Byz coins. Kambana. G. Karadedos and Ch. Karadima, in AEMTH 16 (2002), 9-33, report on study and conservation of the Hel-Rom theatre. The architectural sequence resembles the theatre at Philippi. In the first Hel phase, the seats for the cavea were built</page><page sequence="64">64 JAMES WHITLEY 8 3 l^S^ro: 4Po6 82 Petrota: MPal flake tools into the natural slope of the hill. The orchestra was equipped with a substantial stone drain around its edge, behind which was a row of stone seats (with backs and armrests) for dignitaries. No evidence of the first skene survives. In the 2nd (Rom) phase, a stone skene was built and the seats were demolished and replaced by a row of upright stone slabs supporting iron rail- ings. The orchestra seems then to have had a dual function as both theatre and arena (certainly for beast fights, if not for glad- iatorial combat). In the 3rd (Rom) phase, the front of the skene was demolished and the parodoi blocked off with walls, which made for a better arena but brought an end to the site as a the- atre. Paliochora. S. Doukata (ADelt, 887-888) reports on restora- tion works that took place at the ECh basilica. The mosaics of the N and part of the W arcade of the atrium of the basilica were restored, photographed and studied after their detachment in 1996. The colorful tesserae (1 x 1.5cm) were made of stone and in few cases, of clay; their condition was poor, as they had suf- fered from humidity. The mosaic floor consisted of three layers, the first covered with stones and LRom potsherds, the second with lime mortar and the third with crushed tile mortar. The mosaics of the N arcade were in better condition. The damage to their surface was caused by the construction of houses and tombs at a later date. The finds of the excavation in the MByz church in Paliochora were recorded and preserved. Petrota. M. Fotiadis (Ioannina), D. Papayianni and N. Efstratiou (Thessalonike) report, in AEMTH 15 (2001), 9-18, on survey and surface collection of lithics around the Vrachos location, interpreted as a PH flint quarry. A dense lithic scatter of the local 'Vrachos silex' covers an area of almost lkm2. The main components are MPal Levallois cores and flake tools (Fig. 82) and Neo pyramidal cores (blade cores) and blades, but it seems likely that there is also an Upper Pal component. NOMOS OF EVROS (19th EPCA; 12th EBA) Mesimvria-Zoni. P. Tsatsopoulou (ADelt, 873) reports on a sin- gle trench taken through the 'Lesbian' W. wall, N of the Neos Pyrgos. Finds comprised Cl (5th-4th Ct BC) sherds. M. Vavelidis, V. Melphos, P. Tsatsopoulou and E. Kiourtzoglou report, in AEMTH 15 (2001), 33-45, on survey and geological study of two local limestone quarries to the W of the anc. city, at Vrysi Mousa on the coast, and another site (at OOm asl) inland, 3km NW of the city. Makri. P. Karkanas and N. Efstratiou, in AEMTH 15 (2001), 1- 8, undertake micromorphological examination of the clay floor levels from this Neo site. N. Efstratiou (Thessalonike) and M. Dinou (Nicosia) report, in AEMTH 16 (2002), 1-8, on what seems to be a stone axe workshop in trench D8 in the centre of the site. Finds come from within a postframe structure on a lime plaster floor (with hearth and two pots), dating to Makri II, i.e. the middle of the 6th mill. BC. All stages of the production process are represented: the raw material (a block of local green schist), a granite hammer, and twenty or so finished and semi- finished stone axes. Nipsa, Agios Georgios. D. Triandaphyllos (ADelt, 880) notes recovery of some bronzes. Pherres. K. Tsouris (ADelt, 888) reports on restoration works in the monastery of Kosmosoteira. The conservation of the W side of the murals in the katholikon was continued. Didymoteicho, Plotinopoli. M. Koutsoumanis, in ADelt B Chron 52 (1997), 873-4; AEMTH 15 (2001), 19-31, reports on further excavation of this city, re-founded as Plotinopolis in the 2nd Ct AD, in an area where a structure with an impressive Rom mosaic floor had been found. In trench A, a M-LRom complex (2nd-6th Ct AD) was revealed. In trench B, evidence for a pos- sible Hel house and a system of 2nd Ct BC drains was found. These drains were later linked to an impressive Rom stone built well, over 7.5m d., built of ashlar blocks and probably con- structed in the 2nd Ct AD. To the NW, a wall was associated with coins of the 3rd-6th Cts AD; and in the SE there was anoth- er LRom mortared wall and a coin ofAntiochus II of Syria. This LRom wall overlay a LNeo structure consisting of 35 post holes in two parallel rows. Finds include LNeo pots, flint blades and ground stone axes. In trench F, two walls of a Cl-EHel struc- ture contained 4th Ct BC transport amphoras (some stamped) of Thasos, Ainos and Akanthos, together with black glaze and W Slope sherds mixed with local 'Thracian' handmade wares. The structure was dated by coins dating from the 4th Ct BC to the 6th Ct AD, beginning with an issue of Kypsela (ca 400 BC), and including those of Amadokos, Philip (II?), Alexander III, Antiochus II, Aurelian, Licinius II and Justin II. K. Tsouris (ADelt, 888) reports on restoration works at the castle. The N side of the fortifications was cleared and restored; between gate 6 and tower 15, the older, ECh phase of the walls came to light. Kyani Didymoteichou. D. Triandaphyllos (ADelt, 874-5) reports on excavation of a Hel tumulus (26m di., 1.75m h.). The central trench contained the cremated remains of a 30-40 year old male, accompanied by an amphora, gold finger ring, iron rings from a mail cuirass, fragments of bronze helm, bronze sword hilt, bronze vessels and a bronze fibula, datable to the 2nd Ct BC. To the W, 'Thasian' stamped transport amphoras (4th Ct BC) were associated with an earlier cremation of a 40 year old male.</page><page sequence="65">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2003-2004 65 Spilaio. D. Terzopoulou and D. Triandaphyllos (ADelt, 875-6) report on the excavation of two Rom tumuli, both of which overlay trenches filled with earlier EIA material. At the centre of tumulus A (30m di., 4.5m h.) was a cremation in a trench, accompanied by iron chariot fittings, iron nails from leather boots, gold leaf, clay lamps and glassware datable to the late 1St-early 2nd Cts AD. Upper layers contained burnt bones of pig, sheep, goose and other animals from a funerary feast. Another trench cremation was found in tumulus B (35m di., 4.5m h.) accompanied by clay vessels (Fig. 83), glassware and a coin of Elegabalus (3rd Ct AD). To the E, nine tile graves contained a gold earring, clay vessels and glassware of the early 4th Ct AD; 25 MByz trench inhumations contained silver earrings (Fig. 84), glassware and a lead seal (?) of Marianos, brother of the Byz emperor Basil I, datable to 868-69 AD. Samothrace. Ch. Karadima and D.

A. Dova (ADelt, 911) reports on surface investigations of (principally) BA sites on Lemnos: at Agios Georgios Zematas (metallurgical debris); at Kotsinas, inside the Med kastro (EBA pottery similar to the 'black' period on Poliochni); at Keros (a PH settlement with EBA pottery, flint and obsidian); and at Poliochni tou Kaspaka, another EBA settlement. Hephaisteia. E. Greco (SAIA) reports on the 2003 season of limited excavation and geophysical survey: 'At the circuit walls, with the small tower (pyrgos), a deep trial trench was opened, enabling us to ascertain the important prior existence of Myc structures. Investigations conducted in the area of the baths (where we unearthed a paved structure and the N perimeter wall) revealed evidence of kiln structures; it is now possible to date the bath complex to around the end of the 4th Ct BC. Excavation of a detailed trial trench, in the area of the houses on the slopes of the hill, begun in the previous year, was completed; it revealed pre-existing LHel levels. Late antique houses on the axis of the road from the baths to the upper part of the hill were also investigated, and the foundations were found of a very extensive house (abandoned in the 7th Ct BC) which is flanked by two roads; these roads have shed new light on the plan of this settlement. Geophysical surveys con- ducted by the University of Siena in the area between the exca- vations and the theatre hill have also revealed further details of the city plan. Further geophysical surveys of the axis of the cir- cuit wall W of the small pyrgos also yielded interesting results, where anomalies revealed the presence of a wall extending at least an additional 100m.' 83 Spilaio: tumulus B grave goods 84 Spilaio: MByz silver earrings Lesbos Mytilini. A. Archontidou (ADelt, 900-07) reports on excava- tions in twelve locations. Evidence of occupation from the 6th Ct BC to the 4th Ct AD was revealed, as well as earlier BA lev- els: At O. Agraphiotou (Gentzi plot): ERom (1st Ct BC/1st Ct AD) architecture was found, associated with cooking ware, fig- urines, transport amphoras and 19 coins. At the junction of Charitos and Kratinou (Grammi/Stylianidou plot) the Rom mosaic floor was removed to reveal earlier LHel structures, including rooms with staircases, three storerooms and a drain. At O. Kioutacheias (Karageorgiou plot), a Hel wall and marble floor overlay earlier levels, including a LCl/EHel (L 4th/E 3rd Ct) destruction horizon with black-glaze pottery and coins. At O. Theophrastou (Koukelli plot), a (Hel?) pseudo-isodomic retaining wall associated with a well filled with pottery (black- glaze, 'grey-ware') of the 3rd-lst Cts BC was found. At O. Nafmachias Ellis (Malliaka plot) were found Hel pottery, walls and floors. At O. Giannitson (Protopsalti plot), occupation phases from 600 BC until the 1st Ct AD have been uncovered. A Rom mosaic floor overlay Hel levels, including retaining walls and an earlier LCl/EHel wall. The earliest pottery dates to the 6th Ct BC. At Epano Skala/O. Lasiou kai Sigeiou (Tzimi/Douroudi plot), Hel-Rom walls and associated pottery and figurines were found. At Sourada/O. El.

Archontidou (ADelt, 896-98) reports on excavations in six locations revealing evidence of occupation from the 4th Ct BC until LRom times. At O. Agion Apostolon (Dimitriou plot) LCl (4th Ct BC) house remains were found; finds include tile, amphoras and red figure pottery. At O. Agiou Iakovou (Maistrou plot) there was a LHel/ERom destruction horizon (tile and signs of burning) over Hel walls; finds include black-glaze pottery, lamps and loomweights and one Rom coin of Chios. At O. Anthesterion 23 (Kikili plot) there were EHel (3rd Ct BC) house remains and three MHel (2nd Ct BC) cist graves con- taining perfume flasks. At Agia Anna Kapela (Margouni plot) there were ERom stone floors and a drain overlying Hel and LC1 (4th Ct BC) strata. At Panayia Letsaina (Koutsoulia plot) there were five Hel-Rom tile graves; finds include iron scrapers and perfume flasks. At O. Agiou Ioannou Prodromou, of three cist graves, one (grave I) contained a i :, LHel/ERom perfume flask; the other two were mul- tiple inhumations (5 inhumations in one, 12 in the -: - - other), dating from ERom to LRom/ECh times; finds include glass perfume flasks, coins and iron swords. Eleftherotypia (4/9/2003;9/9/2003), Rizospastis (9/9/2003) and To Vima (3/9/2003) report on the dis- covery in a Hel cist grave (250-150 BC) at O. Kanellaki, with the skull of a 50-year-old with two holes trepanned into its left side, a find which may shed light on 'Hippocratic' medical techniques. P. Valakou (ADelt, 968-970) reports on the excavation of Byz material that took place in the Vayiannou plot. The pottery found came from local workshops of Chios, Canakkale (1750-1850); some was older (Byz 13th Ct; LRC ware if the 5th_7th Cts, and Hel. A third layer (d. 2.40-2.55m) was charac- terized by the absence of glazed pottery, in contrast to the great number of bones and tiles. Potsherds (LRA and LRA 1 ampho- ra, LRC and (andarli ware, an unguentarium) dated this layer to ECh times (5th-7th Cts). Remains of an ECh basilica were located in the nearby plot of S. Charitou. A fourth layer, with remains of rubble construction, was also excavated, but not in detail because of lack of space and the presence of water. Kastro (Patetsou plot). 0. Vassi (ADelt, 970) reports on the excavation of a building dated to the years of Ot domination which was abandoned in 1566, when the Turks occupied Chios. Iznik pottery, N Italian maiolica as well as two Venetian coins (quarciae) of 16th Ct were found. The oldest phase of the build- ing belonged to the Hel period. P. Valakou (ADelt, 970) reports on the excavation of a large Genoese building on the Tyre plot; post-Byz remains were also observed. O. Vassi (ADelt, 972) reports that antiquities were discov- ered in 17 sites during the construction of a new drainage sys- tem; most of them were re-buried. The late 19th Ct Turkish con- duit was found at a number of places. In O. Pagalaki and 0. Theokritou, part of the sea fortress was located, its masonry carefully constructed from spolia. Other finds included: archi- tectural members providing evidence of a monumental building (O. Agios Georgios); pavements (O. Kalothetou and 0. Navarchou Nikodemou); a Turkish fountain (junction of O. Patrikiou and 0. Navarchou Nikodemou). The most important object found was part of an ambo (pulpit) from the Med cistern of the castle. In the N side of the church of Agios Nikolaos were found the remains of the older church, in which the treaty between the people of Chios and Simone Vignoso was agreed in 1346. Two trenches at the sea walls were opened, the first close to the W side of the bastion of Antonio Zeno, which dates from the Genoese period with, at its base remains of a tower from Hel period. Slabs with heraldry, mainly of Justinian's family, are still visible in its walls. The second trench was opened in the ambulatory, which proved to be covered over with a pavement.

O. Vassi, K. Skabavias and P. Valakou (ADelt, 960- 2, 973-974) report on excavation and restoration. Three trench- es were opened in the S side of the katholikon, to check the con- dition of the foundations; a 15th Ct Genoese coin was found. The courtyard was cleared and the ground, paved with stone slabs, was revealed, and in front of the entrance, brick patterns resembling trees and a sun. At the E side, remains of walls seemed to belong to the cells of the monastery. Pottery from Byz, Ot and Genoese periods was found. The tower, trapeza and S and W walls of the monastery were cleared. Removal of the lime plaster from the N wall of the katholikon revealed rich decorative patterns in brick (fish bones, suns, heart-shaped and other geometrical designs). The original masonry imitated the Cl-Hel 'pseudo-isodomic' style. Inside the katholikon, the wall painting of the Second Coming in the S apse and the mosaic scenes of the Baptism and Transfiguration were preserved. Cleaning in the N apse revealed an earlier painting of the Presentation of the Virgin in the Temple. Komi. A.

In all, 30 Cl-EHel graves (12 cist, 1 'beehive', 11 trench) were excavat- ed, and the remains of 20 adults, 7 children and 2 neonates recovered. With one exception, all graves were single inhuma- tions. Finds of the early 5th to late 4th Cts BC include an Attic red figure pelike and white ground lekythoi, lamps and black- glaze wares.

Marthari (ADelt, 918-24) reports on topo- graphical survey and excavation at this site, probably the anc. polis of Syros, which is dominated by the two acropoleis of Vounaki and Agia Pakou. On the summit of Vounaki, surface finds of EBA pots and obsidian suggest a small ECycII (Keros- Syros culture) settlement. Walls, rock-cut features and surface finds (loomweights, spindle whorls) found all over the site sug- gest dense Cl occupation. A system of roads could be traced. On the W slope of Vounaki, two Ar-Cl structures were excavated. Building A, partly cut into the rock, had several rooms and was covered by tile collapse. Finds inside included Ar Cor and Island pottery and a clay wash-basin. The fill of a nearby well included Attic Geo-Cl (4th Ct BC) pottery, loomweights, fig- urines and animal bones. Building B, immediately below, had three rooms. These houses, together with finds of MGeo, LGeo (Fig. 88), Ar and Cl pottery from trench VI, and 6th-5th Ct black-glaze from trench VII, indicate that the site was inhabited by the 8th Ct and extensively occupied by the 6th.

Delos Claire Hasenohr (EFA) reports on excavation and study at the agora of the Competaliasts: 'Study of the pottery from earlier seasons continued. Drawing and study of the 'porch of the pillars with half columns' of area XIIb permitted the identification of many con- struction phases. It has been possible to determine the existence of three sizes of pillars and capitals. The discovery of a new capital, not in situ in area XI, is significant, given that its dimen- sions are identical with those of the only capital of small size which was known up to this point; the upper face of the capital is marked by symmetrical cuttings. Our computer-generated reconstructions suggest three phases: a porch was initially planned but never completed and there were two subsequent phases of reuse. Excavation took place in five locations, four (trenches I-IV) in area XIIb in order to find the foundations of the porch with half-column pillars, and to draw its plan. Trial trench I was opened as a S extension of trial trench 2002-III (room w). We were not able to find the extension of the porch foundations which was uncovered in 2002, because it stopped at exactly the border between the two trenches. On the other side, we exca- vated a drainage canal (gutter) orientated in a N-S direction (Fig. 89) which was covered and destroyed by the porch foun- dation. The material we collected should provide us with a ter- minus in order to date the porch construction. Trial trench II was opened in the W part of room z10, in order to find the porch foundation under the western wall of the ilot and, eventually, to discover the comer of the back wall of the porch, if this porch returned southwards. In fact, the aspect of the foundation of the western wall is identical with that of the wall for which we were looking. At any rate, it was impossible to clarify the situation in the SE comer of the trench because of ground water and the accumulation in this area of big blocks of gneiss which obscure the comer of the wall. Trial trench III, located to the South of room z7 and at the SW comer of the ilot, was opened in order to discover the final extension of the foundations of the porch toward the S. The presence of a circular structure of 0.90m di. (Fig. 90) prevent- ed us from observing the foundations of the W wall. Nevertheless, we continued excavating this well-preserved structure (identifiable as a kiln/oven or perhaps a silo) which is formed by a circle of terracotta slabs, surrounded by a small cir- cular wall of bricks and sherds which served as the support of a clay vault which was fired on the spot. To the N, a small half- circular cavity was preserved at the bottom of the vault and the radier continued outside the structure between two poros blocks. We found two stages with debris covered by a later and less painstakingly constructed radier. The study of the pottery connected with this structure will give us terminus date for the abandonment and later reutilization of the porch. Trial trench IV (1 x 2 m) was opened on the 'sea front street' against the W wall of room z7, and led to the discovery of the foundations of the porch which were impossible to identify in trench III. We extended this trench southwards, then towards the E, in room x. This has allowed us to note that the founda- tions of the porch continued southwards for a 1. of only 1.40m. This foundation did not return toward the E, where, beyond a 4t. 89 Delos: drainage canal 90 Delos: circular structure great slab of gneiss which we were unable to lift, we discovered a wall built according to a technique which is too unusual to be identified. Trial trench V, opened S of room x in the supposed exten- sion of the area of the foundations of the porch, showed that the porch foundations did not in fact reach this point. In conclusion, although we were already aware of the E and S borders of this porch (which skirt the S front of the agora of the Competaliasts and the N part of the 'sea front street') we were unable to find the foundations of the back wall or the shorter side to the S; this may confirm the hypothesis that the building was never completed.'</page><page sequence="70">70 JAMES WHITLEY Helene Siard (EFA) reports on further study of Sarapieion C. Work concentrated on pottery, glass fragments and architecture: 'The glass was examined by M.D. Nenna, who confirmed that the finds were discarded pieces from a glass workshop and identified many fragments of vases datable to the 2nd or early 1St Ct BC. Among these objects are also two fragments of glass souffle, of Imperial date; they confirm other testimony that the sector of the High Inopos Valley continued to be frequented until a late date. Study of the pottery by C. Casiez has clarified the chronolo- gy of the debris associated with the construction of temple C: the presence in the layers of many sherds of Eastern terra sig- illata type A confirms the quite recent date of the arrangement of the Souther terrace (after 150 BC). Study of the architecture has progressed along two lines. First, analysis of the topography and general organization of Sarapieion C. The entire area of the sanctuary was surveyed, and Fr. Muller created the first 3D computer-generated recon- struction of the monument. Second, the Sarapieion buildings have been given detailed study and the theoretical reconstruc- tion of the Ionic porch of the N courtyard was continued. Several blocks from the architrave as well as from the frieze have been identified among the scattered blocks on the ground. The Doric porch of S terrace has also been reconsidered. A study has also been made of the architecture of the altar which was discovered to the E of temple C (trenches 3 and 5). It was not difficult in general to reconstruct this very poorly pre- served building, but the prickly issue remained its relation with the terrace (the problem concerns the reconstruction of the ground level E of the temple). We attempted to compare the altar to the E of temple C and the altar of the N court (G altar, according to the Roussel plan) because of their similarities. Finally, we drew plans of the facade of I chapel.' B. Bourgeois and Ph. Jockey (EFA) report on study of 'poly- chromy and surface treatments of the Delos marbles', under- taken in collaboration with A. Karydas (Demokritos) and Ch. Brekoulaki: 'Both stone and terracotta sculptures were examined using video microscope; work concentrated on completing the photo- graphic catalogue, continuing graphical reconstruction and beginning analysis of pigments using X-ray fluorescence. The initial results of analysis of 106 statue-points using X- ray fluorescence are promising. The pigments, which were found to be in a rough state during the excavations, were first measured and found to represent the total range of pigments available in Delos. An important result of comparison between the pigments identified on sculptures and the reference pig- ments is the discovery that sculptors made use of a only a small range of colours in relation to the total palette of colours avail- able on Delos at the time. For instance, although it is possible for us to observe a large spectrum of yellow on the reference palette, the Delian sculptors, up to this point, seem to have used only yellow ochre. The blue colour range, up to this point, is represented only by Egyptian blue and contains no other pig- ment. We have already observed (via video-microscope) that the different tones obtained were differentiated, or distinguish- able from each other, according to the degree to which this famous pigment was crushed. Our analysis suggests the exis- tence of a unique pigment, crushed and diluted with great care, which represents considerable technical ability. On Delos the green colour is derived from malachite, rather than through the mix of yellow ochre and Egyptian blue, which represents an extraordinary practice if we consider the high cost of malachite. We have been unable at present (through the use of current methods of analysis) to identify the characteristics of the pink colour which, given that it is derived from an organic colorant, cannot be identified without the taking of samples (due to be carried out in 2004). Lead white is omnipresent and is most commonly used (as suggested by video-microscope examina- tion) as an under-layer. It has a double function: apart from making the surface of the marble uniform, it emphasizes the brilliancy of the colours that are then applied. The white of lead, mixed with other pigments, also helps to obtain the desired colour shade. We also discovered that lead white was present in the composition of compound colours like mauve (a mixture of a pink of organic origin) and in an Egyptian blue Lastly, the first campaign has allowed us to determine (as always, via video-microscope) the character of the gilding methods. On Delian sculptures, gold leaf was applied onto a yellow background, which was in turn layered over a ground of white of lead. X-ray fluorescence analysis has revealed the composition of the gold leaf used, which may be characterized as having high levels of purity (of between 92.4% and 98.8 %) with very low silver percentages. The thickness varies to a greater extent, from 12 microns (Apollon, Inv. A 4135) to only 1.7 microns (Anoubis, Inv. A 5280 b).' H. Sarian (EFA) reports on the re-study of the Geo-Hel pottery from the Heraion: 'Three seasons of study have revealed the presence of ceramic sherds of the LGeo period (750-700) which in turn strongly suggest that the cult of Hera in this sanctuary should be assigned an earlier date. The campaigns also revealed Attic red figure pieces, which are of a later date than we had previously considered - even after 480. These findings are of great signif- icance as they bring into question the dates of the beginning and of the end of the sanctuary and allow us to suggest an earlier date than previously believed for the Heraion I, and a later one for the Heraion II. Finally, the trial trenches that were first opened by myself during the 2002 season yielded, among other finds, a great quantity of Hel pottery which demonstrate a cul- tural continuity to the Hel period, a fact that was previously known only through the evidence of a few inscriptions at Delos.' A further report on the 'Melian' pottery has been published: Ph. Zapheiropoulou, La Ceramique 'melienne'. Exploration Archeologique de Delos, Fasc. XLI. (Paris, 2003). M.-F. Billot (EFA) reports on further study of the architectural terracottas: 'The aim of this study is to create an inventory of pieces pro- duced in, or brought into, Delos, to suggest a few attributions and to be able to complete the reconstruction of the buildings. The dispersion of the series among different sectors has allowed us to distinguish the different building phases as well as the repairs, which are sometimes quite precisely dated. On the other hand, the chronology of the Attic pieces should be lowered. The study of the tiles as well as of the couvre-joints started, and the study of the tiles with the relief meander (in a minimum of 13 series) continued; most of these pieces come from the internal facades of the agora of the Italians.' Paros Paros town, Agios Pandeleimon. Eleftherotypia (29/12/2003) and Express (24/12/2003) note two further discoveries from this Ar-Hel cemetery, thought to be reserved for the city's more dis- tinguished citizens, where earlier an Ar kouros and kore had been found. New finds include a (Cl-Hel?) marble stele, (1 x 0.41m) inscribed with an athlete's name and a list of his victo- ries, and an Ar circular marble monument (base 3.12m di.) very similar to the monument of Theagenes on Thasos.</page><page sequence="71">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2003-2004 71 A. Mitsani (ADelt, 975, 976, 979) reports on an exhibition of Byz and post Byz art works at Naousa and on restoration work in the church of Semptemvriani in Paroikia, where the old wooden roof was replaced and the original masonry was revealed. At Katapoliani the ECh sculptures from the basilica of the Three Churches and the basilica of Boutacu were record- ed and photographed. Siphnos Kastro (Georgakopoulou plot). St. Samartzidou-Orkopoulou (ADelt, 924, 951-2) investigated this plot on the NE slopes, close to where Brock and Young (BSA 54 (1949), 1-92) had found Geo levels. A deposit with principally late antique (LRom-ECh) pottery, but also black-glaze wares and one Megarian bowl, was found. Surface finds include numerous examples of Rom, LRom and ECh lamakes, inscribed stelai and columns. Milos Rivari. Ch. Televantou and M. Efstathiou (ADelt, 924-5) report on the excavation of several EBA rock-cut chamber tombs at Phatourena Rivariou, too far from Phylakopi to form part of that site's cemetery. No tomb had any human bones and only one contained grave goods; these comprised one bronze pin and 55 ECyclI-ECycIIIB pots. Shapes include 28 red-slipped bowls, 11 krateriskoi with impressed decoration, 4 jugs with cutaway mouths, 2 krateriskoi with plastic bands, 2 askoi (one with grooved spirals), 1 pyxis, 2 wide-mouthed spherical ves- sels and one triple kemos with impressed and incised decora- tion; 12 potter's marks could be recognized on these vessels. Phylakopi. M. Boyd (BSA), N. Brodie (BSA/Cambridge) and R. Sweetman (St Andrews/ BSA) report on topographical and geophysical survey of this extensive BA site, undertaken in order to assist conservation plans for the site by the 21st EPCA of the Greek Archaeological Service (3rd Community Support Framework): 'The work was undertaken in cooperation with and under the general direction of the Ephor of the Cyclades, Dr Marisa Marthari. Detailed archaeological cleaning of the excavated Phytakopi, 2003 I wart :!:;: Wail, relat~ve phasing areas took place, which helped reassessment of the architecture. The site was then carefully planned (Fig. 91). A digital photo- graphic archive has been created with images of each side of every existing wall. A high resolution Global Positioning System survey was carried out. Geophysical survey was under- taken in order to assess the extent and nature of the unexcavat- ed areas of the site as well as to study the site boundary and fea- tures outside the enclosure walls. The survey suggests that the edge of the site is very clear, which fits with previous theories that a sea inlet or harbour existed to the E and S of the site.' Kimolos St. Samartzidou-Orkopoulou (ADelt, 952) notes new sites dis- covered through survey. PH tools, obsidian blades and cores were noted at Nychia and Provarma, and LCyc and 'historic' potsherds at Kalamitsi. Sikinos Sykia. A. Mitsani (ADelt, 977, 980-1) reports on the restoration of the building and conservation of murals in the church of the Panagia in Sykia and on conservation of murals in the churches of Agios Stephanos in Chorio, the Naos tou Christou in Chora. Further conservation work was undertaken on the 17th Ct AD icons in all these churches. Thera (Santorini) Akrotiri. Ch Doumas (Ergon 2003, 65) and various newspa- pers note the completion of the new roof over the site. E. Gerousi (ADelt, 975-976, 978-9, 981-3) reports on con- servation and excavation on the island. The collection of icons and holy relics from Pyrgos was exhibited in the new church of Agia Triada in Kastelli village. Many of these icons were also conserved. Excavation of the LRom/ECh cemetery in the Karamolegou plot in Perissa continued to the S and to the E of the plot. From 1993 at the SE part, a complex of six more tombs was discovered. Four of them had two phases of use, as they were constructed during the 3rd and 4th Cts above an older layer of the lst-2nd Ct AD; the cemetery continued in use till the 7th Ct. The tombs were built of rubble and lime mortar, barrel- 91 Milos, Phylakopi: site J - (. .4 rsrt ~~ Jr - 1 4 . - .... .. . : .

Inside the tombs the walls have small niches for the placing of sepulchral objects, such as oil lamps, glass unguentaria, and clay vessels, most of them date to the 5th-7th Cts. The most remarkable find was a golden ring decorated with a precious green stone and embossed heart patterns. Of special interest is a tomb with very small dimensions and unlike the others, an E-W orientation. All graves were pillaged, but six inscribed tombstones were found. Anaphi Ch. Televantou (ADelt, 954-5) reports on a preliminary survey of the island's antiquities. Important finds include Rom cham- ber tombs with stepped entrances and funerary sculpture at Kasteli (Fig. 92) and the foundations of the temple of Apollo Anaphaios under the foundations of the Monastery of the Panagia at Kalamiotissa. Altars to other deities (Artemis, Aphrodite and Asklepios) could also be identified here. DODEKANESE AND AMORGOS (22nd EPCA; 4th EBA) Amorgos Minoa. L.

Venizelou (Hospital) and anc. roads at Agiou Nikolaou. S sector (Chatzithoma plot): a rectangular Rom cistern lined with hydraulic cement. Wsector: a drain and (Rom?) structure at the junction of Vasileiou Pavlou and Kountouriotou and a Rom complex at O. Argyrokastrou. Major finds come from the junct of Argyrokastrou and Korytsas (Thalassinou plot). In the SE corer were Hel walls and pots, and in the SSE a damaged Myc tholos tomb (chamber 4.5m di., dromos 7.5m), probably robbed in Rom times. The chamber contained two trenches with human cremated remains (one skull) and a horse tooth. Gold jewellery included an earring with bucrania (Fig. 96), spirals and beads from a necklace. I. Volanakis (ADelt, 1164-5) reports on Byz finds at the junc- tion of Kouroukli and Ioannidis (O.T. 63, Psiri plot) (LRom/ ECh walls and pottery). At the baptistry of Agios Ioannis Prodromos, in the cemetery of the city, trenches revealed pave- ments of mosaic, clay and stone slabs. Cemeteries. D. Grigoriadou and E. Skerlou (ADelt, 1112- 1115) report on Geo-Rom tombs excavated in the Ethnikis Antistaseos, Plateia Plataniou, Platani and Marmaroto. In all 67 Rom graves were found (38 tile, 5 trench, 13 cist and 6 other); the principal grave goods were glassware. Thirteen Hel graves (8 cist, 2 trench, one enchytrismos and two other) contained black-glaze olpai and perfume flasks. Three Geo adult crema- tions and one child's cist grave were also noted at OT 321 on Ethnikis Antistaseos. At the junction of Asklepiou and Australias, a LRom/ECh funerary complex contained four chil- dren's enchytrismoi and three adult graves. The complex had disturbed earlier Hel-Rom graves (5 tile, 2 cist) with associat- ed grave stelai. Quantities of Attic red figure and earlier Ar pot- tery suggest that earlier Ar-Cl graves had been disturbed by the construction of this LRom complex. Psalidi, Herakles. E.

The most important discovery was the location of an ECh church at the W part of the site, with tombs inside dating to the 7th Ct. Kephalos. E. Militsi and A. Didioumi (ADelt, 1162-64 ) report on excavation in four locations. At the Hatziyianni plot, ECh walls and an apse came to light, with a mosaic pavement of an earlier phase. To the NE of the apse, a second larger pave- ment was located, together with architectural members. At the Afendouli plot, a rectangular space with a layer of ashes and floors continued to deeper levels. To the E and N side, a stone- built well and constructions with quantities of lime were dis- covered. The finds, mostly storage jars, dated to the Rom, Hel and ECh periods. At the Papaelia plot, NE of the Kamari basil- ica, a rectangular space built of mortar was revealed. Pottery dated to the ECh period. At the Papastamatiou plot, also NE of Kamari, foundations and walls built of mortar and lime were found. The pottery and coins date to the ECh period. Nisyros Paloi, Pantelidi plot. S.

Kasdagli (ADelt, 1075-8) note a rock-cut square chamber, 4.5 x 3.5m (probably an underground spring chamber or cistern) reached by a series of steps at Isle Adam, just W of the med. for- tification wall, and a Hel structure probably belonging to the agora at Hippodamou 65-7. Finds here include inscriptions, pots, terracotta figurines and coins. N and W sectors: Ph. Zervaki, K. Bairami, Ch. Phantaou- tsaki and N. Christodoulidis (ADelt, 1078-82) note 12 inhuma- tions (9 young adults, 1 child, 2 neonates) LCl-EHel at Akti Miaouli, with sparse finds. At the junction of Ammochostou and Lochagou Phanouraki, a Hel cistern was filled with tile and amphoras (2 stamped) of the 3rd-1st Cts BC, providing a tpq for the associated system of drains and well. In the Wsection at the junction of Themistokli Sophouli and Mesolongiou,three phas- es of an anc. road could be distinguished. S and E sectors: Ch. Phantaoutsaki, P. Triandaphyllidis, S.

Distinctive forms include the Hel chamber tombs with niches for inurned crema- tions, and 'sliding' trench graves. W cemetery. M. Chalkiti, E. Kaninia, Ch. Giakoumaki (ADelt, 1085-9) note the following: at the juntion of Kameirou and Isiodou, a large LHel funerary complex with four compart- ments held 17 graves; finds include clay 'fruit' covered in gold leaf, a cylindrical marble altar, inscribed osteothekes and funer- ary stelai. At O. Kameirou (Toutsi plot): four LCl-EHel (4th Ct BC) trench graves; sparse grave goods include black glaze 'bol- sal' skyphoi. At O. Galinou (Alvanaki plot): a sculpted figure with a himation (Hel?), presumably from a grave. At O. Parthenopis (Atsidi plot): a total of 79 LCl-EHel graves were excavated, principally cist graves but at least 12 trench graves and one underground chamber tomb containing 'guttus type' askoi. Finds from cist graves include a glass vessel (grave 33; Fig. 97), bronze mirrors (graves 4, 33 and 69), 'Rhodian' amphoras (graves 33 and 69) and a red figure lekythos and stone ring setting (grave 69). Grave 73 was marked by a circu- lar marble altar with a male figure inscribed (AA / IIOPAKPY.

The first (plundered) contains osteothekes, one inscribed ZQ4DPO- EYNAE, and one inscribed marble altar with bucrania. The sec- ond (unpludered) contained seven burials on the E side, and four on the W. Burials comprised both inhumations and crema- tions in hydrias, sometimes inside osteothekes. Finds include one Attic red figure vase of the Kerch group with a representa- tion of an Amazonomachy, attributed to the Amazon painter, and a number of funerary stelai. In a niche the SW of this sec- ond chamber was a cremation in a kalpis containing beads, a bronze scraper and a gold earring. Finds from other graves include W Slope ware. At O.

Finds include inscribed gravestones and a marble tripod table for a 'perideip- non'. Also found: at O. Stockholm, three Hel trench graves; at 0. Helsinki 4-6, two chambers of another spring chamber; at Atavyrou, grave stelai and two cinerary urns in a single grave of the 3rd Ct BC. At Dodonis, three multi-chamber Hel trench graves contained a cremation in a hydria and cremations in osteothekes. Five more 'sliding' graves, two more trench graves and two rock-cut chambers for multiple burials of the 3rd-1st Cts BC were found nearby. One of these contained 13 osteo- thekes, three infant inhumations in kalpides and 15 further burials. Finds included 'guttus' askoi and heart-shaped bronze leaves covered in gold and clay 'pebbles' in gold, probably from some kind of wreath. At the Korakonerou plot one LCl/Hel trench grave contained a gold mesomphalic phiale and silver alabastron of the late 4th Ct BC. Nearby was a cremation in a Hadra hydria (3rd Ct BC). Three uninscribed bases of grave stelai were found 25m away. Medieval fortifications. K. Manousou-Della and A.M. Kasdagli (ADelt, 1127, 1148-50) report on the restoration and excavation of Agios Georgios Bastion. During the restoration of the bastion, the older gate of the 16th Ct was revealed by removing the layer of landfill. The interior space of the bastion was made water-tight. The stone masonry was restored and replaced where necessary. A more careful recording of the suc- cessive chronological phases of the monuments was made. The two ground floors were designed so as to function as exhibition halls. At the S wall of the N ground floor hall a door frame of the period of the Knights was revealed. The stone masonry of the N side of the central tower of the Great Magister Fluvian came to light after excavation research. Ruins of a stone bridge outside the gate of the early bastion were also found, together with many stone and clay finds. Two ancient, rectangular conduits that went across the moat NNW of the bastion were revealed. The excavation of the moat exposed remains of ancient buildings and pottery of the Rom period. Of special interest were the foundations of a cylindrical tower that was demolished in 1500. Traces of quarrying were located in the natural rock surface. The stone masonry and the interior of the Heredia tower were conserved. K. Manousou-Della (ADelt, 1129-30) reports on restoration works that took place in the bastions of Agios Ioannis, Agios Athanasios and the space of the medieval moat, (sections that were the responsibility of Provence and Italy). A complete restoration of this section of the walls was made and a new drainage system was installed. Of special interest was the reconstruction of the W side of the 'barbacane', where the her- aldry of the Great Magister d' Aubusson was depicted. The same author reports on the restoration Byz ramparts at the junction of Panaitiou and Theophiliskou. The E entrance was moved to the S of the Souleiman mosque, the scarp of the Byz rampart was revealed and masonry was replaced where needed. Medieval city (interior). M.

Zerlendis (ADelt, 1132) report on the restoration of the church and its chapels. A. Psarologaki (ADelt, 1151-2) reports on exca- vation works conducted at the W side of the church. At the N wall inside the church, four tombs covered with arcosolia came to light. A marble slab and parts of paintings which decorated the arcosolia were found, possibly dating to the end of the 14th Ct. In the NW chapel, a tomb complex was discovered, togeth- er with glazed pottery and bones of animals. An interesting find was a tomb slab of the Comeillan family, decorated with their arms. Agioi Apostoloi (O. Sokratous). M. Sigala (ADelt, 1150) reports that the church, also known as Sissitio, belongs to a larg- er complex of buildings. Excavation revealed columns, evi- dently part of a cross vaulted church with three aisles, of the 14th or 15th Ct. At the NE side, ruins of buildings were identi- fied as tanneries. A great number of tombs was also excavated, most important among them that of Jacob Priolis or Priuli, who died in 1476, and the marble stone of which is inscribed and decorated by a shield. Agia Aikaterini (O. Thiseos). K. Manousou-Della (ADelt, 1133) reports that the restoration of the E side of the Knight's Guest room, which was destroyed in the past by bombing, has been completed. P. Psarri (ADelt, 1152-4) reports on the church of unknown dedication on O. Thisseos, at the SE part of the medieval city of Rhodes. The church was bombed during the Second World War and survives as ruins; it was of inscribed cross type and the finds -potsherds and coins-covered a long period, from Hel to Ot. Part of murals in two layers, and the pavement, date the church to the 14th-15th Cts. At the N side, outside the church, the foundations of two rectangular rooms came to light. G.

Karabatsos (ADelt, 1147-8) reports on excavation work between the apses of the S and central aisles of the church. It was discovered that at least the E part of the church had three construction phases, the later dated to the period of the Knights. To the S of the church the ruins of two small buildings were revealed, possibly to be identified as chapels. In one of them, which was decorat- ed with murals, a bronze coin of the Gavalades family was found. O. Antifanous (Anastasiadou plot). M.

Triandon revealed a layer of (Theran?) volcanic tephra and burnt wood. This had sealed a layer of fallen plaster including fragments of LM IA wall paintings with rosettes, sim- ilar in many ways to the paintings in Xeste 3 at Akrotiri on Thera. The tephra layer had been cut through by LM Ib walls, and overlain by a LM IIIA burnt deposit. This building was sep- arated from another LM IA structure (the S. Polythyron) by an LM IA road. Four bases in a 3.85m section of this structure were investigated, also partly covered by tephra. Beneath the LM IA floor were MBA levels, including the remains of a wooden column and a destruction horizon containing three Triton shells. Parodos Grigoriou Lambraki. Two parallel LM IA walls and a floor level were investigated. The floor was decorated with dots imitating multi-coloured pebbles. Fragments of wall painting were noted. Parodos Ierou Lochou.

Area 1: along the NE end of the central court, in the area where a E-W stone staircase had been constructed by Evans a 1.80 x 5.70m test trench was opened, which reached bedrock after 7.90-7.94m from the surface of the central court. Levels closer to the surface produced mixed Neo and M sherds, with plaster fragments, animal bones and stone tools, but from 1.75m onwards Neo levels had the ususal alternation of black charcoal with hard yellow soils. Thirty-nine levels were defined, corre- sponding to J. Evans's ten (I-X) and running from aceramic to LNeo, which included architectural remains. Unbaked but frag- mentary mudbricks bear imprints of a reed plant. Area 2. N of the current entrance to the archaeological site a large foundation trench (40 x 1.20m) for a retaining wall was opened to a d. of 0.40m. It revealed mixed M and Rom pottery but after removal of the surface level pure Rom levels were reached. South house. A monograph has now been published: P.A. Mountjoy, Knossos. The South House. BSA Supplement 34. (London, BSA, 2003). Little Palace North. E. Hatzaki (BSA) reports on the 2003 study season: 'This season's work has confirmed that immediately N of the Little Palace, the succession of open-air surfaces starting at LM IIIA1 from bedrock went up to LM IIIA2 and LM IIIB early. The non-joining upper body fragment of an inscribed coarse ware transport stirrup jar is associated with a LM IIIB early context. The next major phase is associated with the construc- tion of the Re-used Ashlar Building founded partly on top of the now partly demolished Little Palace. The architectural and stratigraphic sequence continues with LM IIIB early, LM IIIB late and LM IIIC early levels, the latter associated with hand- made burnished pottery co-existing with local wheel made imi- tations in a buff clay. The architectural and stratigraphical sequence revealed at the Little Palace North matches in com- plexity the results from the nearby Stratigraphical Museum extension site, excavated in the 1980's by Peter Warren, as both sites have revealed a series of dramatic changes in the urban landscape from the Final palatial to Postpalatial periods. As a result, Arthur Evans's vision ofNeo-palatial Knossos remaining largely unchanged well into the Post-palatial period is now challenged and the model of a continuously but drastically transformed urban landscape emerges for BA Knossos. Members of the publication team concentrated on the study of different aspects of the excavation: D. Evely worked on the study of the stratigraphy from trenches 1 and 3; A. Livarda con- tinued her work on the coarse floats from the ca 600 bio-archae- ological samples collected; Stuart Throne worked on the post- BA stratigraphy whereas Peter Callaghan concentrated on the study of the pottery from a late Cl building and of the subse- quent 2nd Ct AD building.

Banou (23rd EPCA) reports in ADelt 52 (1997) 991 on the discovery of poor- ly-preserved Hel-Rom building remains 4m below the present surface. A plastered pit was associated with layers of ash, frag- ments of unbaked pottery, clay stands to assist the firing of pot- tery, various small tools of iron and parts of a clay potters wheel. Nearby, a Rom drain was associated with clay wasters. Although no kiln was discovered the finds suggest the area was part of a pottery workshop. Pottery dates to the end of 1St Ct BC-mid 1St Ct AD and consists of storage vessels (amphoras), cooking pots and finer wares including footed cups, eastern sig- illata B, local pottery imitating terra sigillata A and N Italian grey ware. The excavator associates the pottery from the pit with ceramic production, predominantly amphoras from the times of Augustus until the mid 1St Ct AD. Gypsades. E. Grammatikaki (23rd EPCA) reports in ADelt 52 (1997) 987 on further excavation in the Papadakis field. A large SM-PG chamber tomb was found looted but eight skulls, dispersed human bones, fragmentary clay larakes, a feeding bottle and a small jug were recovered. At the S end of the tomb, three skulls and a few sherds were retrieved. Three LM IIIA2 cist graves were discovered, one was looted but contained frag- ments of a clay lamax, another contained a single burial associ- ated with a piriform jar and razor. To the N of the excavated area a square rock-cut cenotaph tomb was discovered, which was associated with a LM IIIA1 piriform jar and a jug. Hellenika (Kamaritis plot). E. Banou (23rd EPCA) reports in ADelt 52 (1997) 989-91 on the discovery of Rom building remains 100m E of the Villa Dionysos. This building complex consists of six areas including a paved road and a square stone drain. Finds include fragmentary sculpture, bronze coins, iron nails, fragmentary glass vases and bone pins; the associated pot- tery dates to the 2nd-3rd Ct AD. A test trench revealed only poor- ly preserved Geo stray finds. Venizelio Hospital. E. Grammatikaki (23rd EPCA) reports in ADelt 52 (1997) 987-9 on further excavation at the hospital site and the discovery of a large funerary monument (large square Rom house tomb set on a stepped foundation course) dating to the 1st Ct AD, constructed out of large poros limestone blocks. Along the S side of the monument the names of the deceased were inscribed: CLUATIUS and CLUATIUS C.f.CONINUS. A subterranean cist grave was located below the funerary monument, which was approached from the E end. The tomb was found looted and only two clay perfume bottles and bone pins were discovered. The monument was dismantled and re constructed immediately N of the hospital. W of it a Hel child burial was discovered in a rock-cut grave containing a compartment constructed out of tiles. Two figurines were dis- covered outside the grave, together with decorated marble pyx- ides and three glass alabastra. During the opening of a new road N of the hospital buildings A and B a LR-ECh monument was only partly excavated. At a lower level square pit graves dating to the 1 st3rd Ct AD were discovered. An important change find (out of context) was the discovery of a cippus, which presum- ably originated from the nearby Geo cemetery. DAIDALOS programme. D.

Kanta (Archaeological Institute of Crete), and Costis Davaras (for- merly 24th EPCA) report on the first two study seasons on mate- rial deriving from Davaras's 1962 excavation: 'The artefacts from Davaras's excavation come in part from several areas at the very back of the large and open entrance chamber of the Skoteino Cave but mostly from a discrete and impressive area, the 'room with the altar-like formation,' deep- er in the cave. In all areas excavated, the artefacts had been thoroughly mixed by looting and probably also by clearing in antiquity to provide space for subsequent events. Rom sherds and lamp fragments were mixed with BA sherds in each area, indicating both the extent of mixing and the similar preferences for event locations. The Rom material is being examined by Jane Francis (Concordia University). The fabrics, both BA and R, are being analysed macroscopically by Harriet Robinson (ASCSA) and petrologically by Eleni Nodarou (INSTAP, East Crete Study Center). From our study so far, we can provide a number of broad conclusions about the ceramics from the Skoteino Cave. The major period of cave use is the Neopalatial period (ca 1,700-1,450 BC). The cave (perhaps with an initial gap) con- tinues in use, but less frequently, to the end of LM IIIB (ca 1,200 BC). Earlier sherds, both Pre- and Protopalatial, are rare. We have not positively distinguished any post-BA ceramics ear- lier than R. The Rom pottery indicates a second, major period of cave use from the mid-second Ct AD through to the mid-3rd. The precise beginning and end points have yet to be established, but all recognizable vessels fall within this chronological range. Several sherds of a single, glazed medieval pot are the latest sherd material from the excavation. The ritual nature of the Skoteino Cave assemblage is confirmed, not only by the pres- ence of figurines typical of LM sanctuaries (especially caves) but also by both the specific range of ceramic forms as well as the find context in dark areas deep within the cave. In the Neopalatial period, a simple type of chalice or 'communion cup' is the most common ritual vessel. The lack of a greater variety and quantity of bronze votives, similar to those from the Psychro Cave, might be due to intense pillaging, reported since Evans' time (PM I, 163). At least in terms of the quantity of ceramics and the presence of bronze human figurines, it is clear that the Skoteino Cave was a major Neopalatial religious site that continued into the LM IIIB period. Skoteino was also one of many caves revisited during the Rom era.' See also ADelt 18 (1963, B2) 312 and BCH 89 (1963) 887- 88. DEMOS CHERSONESOS Chersonissos (Karantzi plot). G. Rethemiotakis (23rd EPCA) reports in ADelt 52 (1997) 991-2) on the discovery of two M sites located E and W of the Hotel Nana. The E trenches revealed worn EM and MM pottery and two fragmentary fig- urines but bedrock was close to the surface. Architectural remains were discovered to the W. An E-W strong wall, locat- ed some 50m from the coast, probably extended to both ends of the small Drapano promontory at the edge of which a small anchorage point is located. The wall was made of flattened and chipped stones, whereas pottery collected from the wall make- up dates it to MM IB-II. The wall may have protected the small promontory located in the vicinity of Chersonissos and Malia. DEMOS THRAPSANOU Galatas. G. Rethemiotakis (23rd EPCA) reports on the 2003 excavation season: 'In the area of the processional way and the N entrance of the N wing, the loose fill over the paved road was removed so flagstones of the pavement remaining in the original position were uncovered. During consolidation works new evidence turned up concerning the phases of the tripartite facade and the form and function of the rock cuttings in the open space in front of it. It became clear that the wall of the middle recessing, part of the facade and the projecting sections at both sides were not built simultaneously. The middle part is later and was built in order to block an originally open space, a kind of recess, shaped between walls and a rock cutting along its W side, which framed a wooden platform. Traces of the wooden floor of the exedra are preserved under two walls belonging to the period of the provisional repairs in the palace during the LM IA period. Depressions into the plastered floor in the comers of the tripar- tite facade mark the place where the wooden supports of the exedra stood, or, possibly, of wooden masts, or flagpoles like those seen along the facade of the Zakros rhyton. Last year we came across two odd fixtures in front of the tripartite facade. The first has the form of a rectangular, shallow pit, hewn into the rock, with a limestone block along its W side. It seems to be the base of a wooden rectangular altar, like that depicted on the Agia Triada sarcophagus, standing on three oblong blocks along the three sides of the pit, of which only one remains in place while the position of the others is indicated by the shape of the rock cutting The second, which has the shape of a circular stone-lined, funnel-like pit, obviously served as a libation pit ('bothros') aimed to receive liquid offerings and lead them into the ground. Trenches opened further eastwards revealed the continuation of the exterior wall of the N wing made of courses of stepped ashlar masonry. Two projecting sections of this impressive wall seem to respond to specific configurations and functions of the outer space. The first projection incorporates an extension east- wards of the upper terrace (the one supporting the plastered court with the altar and the libation pit referred to), which has the form of an oblong platform with a retaining wall along its N side and three steps at its E end. It was obviously intended to convey circulation flow downhill, to a lower terrace in front of the second projection of the exterior wall. Configurations and constructions both in and outwards, along both sides of the facade, confirm the outstanding religious significance of this part of the palace. Though much destroyed by cultivation and erosion, the lower projecting section of the facade seems to have had the form and function of a raised stone-built platform having direct access from the side of the stoa of the adjacent M Hall. This platform supported what seems to be the base or the</page><page sequence="79">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2003-2004 79 lower part of a free-standing self-contained tripartite construc- tion. A probable religious function may be proposed, on account of a plastered channel, partly preserved along its W side. This channel, which contained black, oily soil with remains of organ- ic materials, apparently served to collect and convey liquid offerings somewhere in front of this structure. Numerous frag- ments of painted plasters, including frames of panels, which were found between the walls in the loose fill, is possibly all that remained from the rich decoration of this construction. The following rooms were excavated inside the N wing: Room 68. Excavation under the MM IIIB floor uncovered walls and an earth floor of an earlier room dating to MM IIIA. As happens in the E wing, some of the palace walls step on walls of a MM IIIA building. The fill contained much pottery of good quality and some fragments of fine wall plasters with painted imitation of dadoes and possibly pictorial decoration including curvilinear designs in red, deep and light blue and yellow. Room 72 proved to be a narrow space used as a deposit, con- taining plentiful vases, mainly cups, some plates and kalathoi. All these date from MM IIIA to LM IA. Among the cups of the lower layer an example of the so-called wavy-cups confirms strong links to Knossos. Room 71. A stratigraphic test in the loose fill under the MM IIIB floor proved once more that the floors in the E part of the N wing rest upon a deep fill composed of rough stones and abundant MM IIIB pottery. In addition to sherds, a clay vessel in the form of horns of consecration was found. The only rea- son for filling in space between the walls was to raise the level of the floors in the E part to that of the rooms in the W part of the wing; the stratigraphic sequence is therefore different in the two parts of the wing. In the eastern the deep fill has saved some remains of the first MM IIIA palatial phase, while in the west- ern part these were totally erased since the bedrock comes close to the surface so that only scanty remains of MM IB walls have been preserved directly under the MM IIIB floors of the palace. Rooms 67, 69, 70. Three rooms to the W of the M hall pre- serve wall plasters in place and paneled patterns on the floors of broad and narrow strips of plaster. A standard feature in all three cases is a broad band on the axis of the rooms from which nar- row bands start framing rectangular panels. The panels con- tained pieces of carbonized wood, apparently the remains of wooden planks. Actually the floor pattern is all that remained from the plaster filling of the interstices between the wooden planks, which was used in order to fix them on the floor and make up a decorative effect. Obviously a similar method was employed in the case of the more complex patterned floors in the ceremonial hall of Zakros palace. The surface of the strips in Rooms 69 and 70 was left unpainted while those of room 67, which is the largest and apparently the most official, were paint- ed red, but obviously due to wear sometimes were covered by a thin coat of white plaster. Some jugs and cups, which were found in this room, date to the period of the final destruction in LM IA. The same date is confirmed by a fine Vapheio cup with mid-rib and ripple decoration and some fragments of reed cups excavated in the adjacent room 47' G.

Rethemiotakis (23rd EPCA) reports on the rescue excavation at the peak sanctuary located on the top of the Kephala hill, near the village of Liliano and 2km S of Kastelli, which date to MM IIIA and MM IIIB early: 'It seems that religious use was taken up on this hill after the abandonment of the Sklaverochori peak sanctuary. The total volume of figurines vs. pottery does not exceed a 1/10 ratio in comparison to the Sclaverochori peak sanctuary which suggests that outdoor cult activities are declining during MM III. At the same time, when the 'Central Building' was constructed at the large settlement of Kastelli, where presumably the main focus of religious expression on a massive scale was transferred. Deposits of figurines amongst the rocks had been made mainly along the small 20m2 plateau along the N side of the peak whereas the main volume of pottery, mainly drinking vessels with offerings, was located along an adjacent niche in the rock. There are fragmentary offerings of vessels with attached horns of consecration or birds, a symbol of epiphany, but also fig- urines of worshipers within their interiors. Of special impor- tance is a rectangular model of which the back and sides are preserved. It depicts a rectangular H-shaped peribolos with a rectangular niche at its back accommodating a three-stepped construction inside. On its steps disc and conical projections of clay were attached, showing offerings - possibly pies or bread. The act of deposition is symbolized by the presence of a human figure, of which the feet are preserved along the left side of the niche and abutting the wall. 'Rock' reliefs and arched-shaped attachments on the outer walls may be compared to a similar painted formations depicted in frescos. This model possibly depicts a real three-dimensional image of the perivolos of the sanctuary with stepped construction amongst a rocky landscape, an image which resembles the peribolos and the mountainous landscape of the Zakros rhyton.' Lyttos (SE of site). S. Madalaki (23rd EPCA) reports in ADelt 52 (1997) 1000 on the excavation of a hut-shaped tomb which did not contain any skeletal remains or other finds. The same report covers the Miradorakifield, where there was excavation of a Rom peribolos associated with inscriptions and other mar- ble architectural members re-used as building material. These imply the existence of an important Rom building which was destroyed prior to the construction of second Rom building. The latter could be contemporary with the peribolos, which howev- er could be of a more advanced date; also in the same report, the discovery of fragments of an Ar or Hel sarcophagus at Porous (Borboudaki field). Sklaverochori, Kastelli. G. Rethemiotakis (23rd EPCA) reports on the rescue excavation at the peak sanctuary located on the top of the hill 'stou Mameloukou' located near the village of Sklaverochori, some 1.5km W of Kastelli: 'A circular building (2m di), with an entrance to the SW, was excavated at the top of the hill, a plateau 30 X 15m. Within the structure large quantities of obsidian flakes and cores were found, together with small quantities of MM IA pottery, pre- dominantly cups. The circular building probably housed an obsidian workshop, the production of which was intended for the nearby large settlement of Kastelli. Around the plateau four deposits were excavated, containing pottery together with human and animal figurines. The largest of these deposits is along the W side, with the other three along the S and E. It seems that the plateau was the main cult/worship area and was probably equipped with additional structures of perishable materials which would have given it the shape and the usabili- ty of the peribolos. This is the only area suitable to receive large numbers of participants. Fragments of mudbricks, one with an impression of rounded wood, suggest the presence of built structures. After the performance of ritual, pottery and figurines were either thrown along the sides of the plateau or gathered at rock</page><page sequence="80">80 JAMES WHITLEY crevices, where they were found. The fragmentary preservation of most of the objects is due to the very small quantities of top- soil covering the site. The W deposit is the earliest and dates to MM IB, whereas the other three contain MM II pottery. The most common shapes are tumblers and carinated cups, while in the later pits the cylindrical and hemispherical thin-walled cups and footed goblets that appear here for the first time are more numerous. These types become popular amongst Pediada deposits in MM III, as confirmed by the contents of the 'central building' of Kastelli. The animal figurines are present in large numbers and in dif- ferent sizes, but almost entirely of bulls with clearly defined genitalia. Some figurines are exceptionally executed but most, and especially the small and medium sized solid ones, are schematic. The larger figurines are hollow, handmade and assembled of many different parts, some are over 0.50m h., which make them the largest animal figurines of the Old Palace period. Of particular importance is the discovery of fragments of an exceptionally large human figure. The anatomically- shaped 13cm-long foot, with a hollow interior, was fastened to a base. Also preserved is the right arm with the fist, which was positioned on the chest. It is estimated that the height of this fig- ure would have been over 70cm. The presence of at least one male figure in the context of a shrine and dating to the Old Palace period (MM II) is unique. It is the oldest human figure so far discovered in Crete and earlier than the slightly smaller figures from Kophinas which date to MM IIIB/LM IA. Most of the human figurines usually wear a phallus-sheath and rarely a loin cloth. Some heads are exceptionally well made, often with shaved head or locks of hair. A female head is wearing a coni- cal hat with side-long locks on the side of its face, whereas another figurine depicts a pregnant woman. Of particular importance is the discovery of numerous clay models, which seem to be copying the architectural form of the building or a circular enclosed space. Unique is one type of a two-storied building, badly preserved, with external doors on the ground floor and windows with vertical divisions located below the roof lintel. Of utmost importance is the fact that for the first time we have a three-dimensional representation of the roof of a M building. The roof is flat and has a rectangular open- ing probably for adjusting the staircase, whereas a raised ledge along the sides serves for maintaining rain water. It has oblique holes along its comers associated with projections probably depicting roof drains. Another unique category of models depicts rocks and rock formations. Some are well preserved and show clearly traces of having a flat surface underneath in order to stand on a base, a fact which suggest that they may have been parts of a three dimensional composition on a base or stand with a flat surface. These are conical or hor like in shape and have a rough rugged surface with conical shaped projections and per- forations. Attached wavy lines or tooth shaped clay projections portray details the natural environment and adhere to character- istics of landscape scenes with rocks in stone vases in relief and frescoes, such as the Zakros rhyton and the frescoes from the West House at Akrotiri. On many of these models small animals are attached. In this way mountainous landscapes are depicted with animals scattered herding amongst the rocks. This is a unique way in rendering pictorial compositions and may sug- gest that such representations were first depicted on clay in the form of three dimensional syntheses before they were trans- ferred to the iconographic medium of frescoes and stone vases in relief. The sanctuary was abandoned in MM II.' Smari. D. Chatzi-Vallianou (Archaeological Institute of Crete) provides a detailed report in ADelt 52 (1997) 1053) of the small-scale excavation at the acropolis, which concentrated both within and outside the peribolos. The areas II-V outside the peribolos wall were investigated and evidence in support of the construction of the peribolos wall in LM IIIC was revealed. At the E side extensive domestic installations were revealed. Evidence for workshop installations was confirmed and the entire complex dates to LM IIIC. Further excavation within the peribolos (area XXII) revealed a LM IIIC destruction deposit associated with pottery, including pithoi, a stirrup jar and cook- ing pots. Along the N end of area Zo sections of earlier M walls were exposed. Voni, Orphanou Marathia site. G. Rethemiotakis (23rd EPCA) reports in ADelt 52 (1997) 1001 on the discovery of MM III-LM I and LM IIIA-B pottery, possibly associated with a large farmstead badly damaged by deep ploughing. E of Voni along the Sfakokephala hill, many recently-destroyed building remains were traced, associated with MM III-LM IA pottery, including pithoi, smaller vessel, stone pestles and grinders. DEMOS ARCHALOCHORIOU Archalochori (Danalaki plot). A. Vasilakis (23rd EPCA) reports in ADelt 52 (1997) 998 on the excavation of a LHel building, of which two storage rooms for grain were investigat- ed. They contained three large Ar pithoi, which were heirlooms amongst the otherwise Hel pottery. Stone grinders and pounders were also found. Tsoutsouros (anc. Inatos), Kephalakis plot. S. Madalaki (23rd EPCA) reports in ADelt 52 (1997) 995-6 on the 2nd-3rd Ct AD Rom cemetery consisting of 10 tombs. Eight are tile graves, one is a rectangular pit cut into bedrock while another is of the hut- shaped type, which is also the earliest of all tombs. Five of the tombs, located along the W side of the plot, were separated from the rest by a wide corridor. The remaining tombs were enclosed by three square and one round periboloi. The tombs contain either primary or secondary burial and tomb offerings, including glass vessels, bronze coins bone pins (22 associated with a single female burial), miniature helmet, gold rings and earrings. Such finds suggest that the cemetery was associated with the upper classes of anc. Inatos. Vlastos plot. S. Madalaki (23rd EPCA) reports in ADelt 52 (1997) 996-8 on the excavation of a LRom building with a total of five building/occupation phases. The earliest, located below room 1, is associated with a wall constructed out of pebbles. The subsequent LRom (3rd Ct AD) building had six rooms, one of which was equipped with a mosaic floor, and was repaired in the ECh period, when most parts of it were destroyed (with the exception of a room containing a pithos where occupation con- tinued). Subsequently the area was used as a cemetery and six ECh burials were discovered, containing poorly preserved skeletal material, none of which was associated with finds. DEMOS AGIAS VARVARAS Prinias. It is reported by Professor Giovanni Rizza that in 2003 SAIA in collaboration with the Mission of the University of Catania and the CNR of Catania, continued excavations on the Patela of Prinias: 'Excavation and survey work, conducted in July and August, focused on the area of temples A and B, as well as on the inside of the fortress which dominates the S slopes of the area. In the area of the temples, excavation was re-started on temple A, which had not been examined since the investigations conduct- ed by Pemier in 1906-8. In situ deposits were discovered with- in the pronaos as well as certain structures predating the con-</page><page sequence="81">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2003-2004 81 struction of the building. Through an extension of the excava- tion area (to the E, in front of the temple) the team was able to establish the perimeter of the square which was first unearthed during excavations after 1969. It has been possible to establish the existence of a street which led to the square from the N and which, in a later time, contemporary with the construction of the temple, served to demarcate a respect area. Recovered items include material from the collapsed roof and certain decorated fragments. At a distance of l1 m to the S of temple B, excava- tion was restarted of a significant building first identified in 2000, parallel to temples A and B. The external walls of this structure, whose internal w. is 6m, have been fully identified. This structure is23m 1. and divided into three rooms. The E room (6 x 3m), has been fully explored, whereas the W room has been only partially investigated. The perimeter walls of the central room, 12m 1., have been brought to light. The dimen- sions of this structure, as well as the very careful building tech- nique, allow us to conjecture that these are the remains of an important public building. Further excavation was done between the above mentioned building and temple B. At the conclusion of the excavation season of 2000 it began to appear that this area was occupied by another great precinct which was separated from the S building by a (newly discov- ered) corridor. The trial trenches revealed consistent mural structures which were likely to have been a part of the Western section of the precinct, which opened on the square and into alignment with temple B. The presence of the two great build- ings in parallel and aligned to the S with temple A and temple B doubles the size of the public area on the Patela, which had first been recognized during the excavation conducted by Perier. The perimeter of the square in front of buildings A and B, as it is now recognized, suggests that temple B and the struc- ture immediately to the S of the temple occupied a central posi- tion. In the fortress area we opened four trial trenches, two along the Eastern wall, two along the SE tower. We detected the presence of an intermediate construction, dating from the peri- od between the destruction of the Ar city and the construction of the fortress discovered by Perier. The date of this structure does not seem to be later than the late classic period.' DEMOS TIMBAKIOU Kamares Cave. A. Van de Moortel (University of Tennessee) and L. Tyree (CAIA) report on the 2003 study season: 'This season began the re-examination and study, with the goal of republishing, the pottery and non-ceramic artefacts from Italian and British excavations of the Kamares Cave, conducted by A. Taramelli in 1894 (AJA 1 (1897) 287-312 and by R.M. Dawkins and M.L.W. Laistner in 1913, (BSA 19 (1912-13) 1- 34). The study includes material from the cave housed in the Herakleion Archaeological Museum as well as pottery sherds studied by Dawkins and Laistner but left behind in a pottery dump at their base camp, a 15-minute walk SE of the cave, which is located high on the Mt Ida range in Central Crete. The dump, in its present state, is a light scatter of sherds over a ca 10 x 10m area. Over 120 registered vases and sherds are in the museum's study collection and 10 boxes (separated by find con- text) of ca 4,000 unregistered fragments, mostly of high quali- ty and well preserved. In addition to these, the pottery dump on Mt. Ida contains ca 13,000 sherds, of which only a few (now stored in the Herakleion Museum) were selected for publica- tion. Other objects from the cave (except for a few fragments of terracotta animal figurines) include bone and stone tools, ani- mal bones (anc.?), and six iron spearheads that may be post-M in date. From the preliminary study of the Kamares Cave pot- tery carried out in the museum and validated at the dump, a broad range of conclusions has already been reached. The lim- ited range of ceramic shapes confirms Dawkins and Laistner's observation and reinforces their conclusion about the special nature of activities at the cave. Regarding chronology, the major period of cave use coincides more closely than expected with the duration of the First Palace at Phaistos, MM IB-MM IIB. Thereafter, the cave declines in use from the Neopalatial period (though not as much as expected) to LM III. Evidence for early (Neo, EM, and MM IA) as well as post-M use of the cave is scanty. The Kamares Cave is important both for the history of M cave cult - as it is the only sacred cave with confirmed use for every phase of the Protopalatial period - and for its rela- tionship to the political situation in central Crete during the transition from the Protopalatial to the Neopalatial period'. Kommos J.W. Shaw and M.C. Shaw (ASCSA) report on the 2003 study season: 'Work this season concentrated on the processing of materi- al from the Neopalatial M house X located just N of the road separating the civic buildings from the town. J. Rutter has been studying for some time the character and stratigraphy of the house's rich deposits ofLM I-IIIA2 pottery, including its LM II levels of occupation. M. Shaw has now begun the study of the architecture and room use. She also studied the frescoes, dis- covering in the process major new joins between parts of the lily fresco. J. Shaw continued the study of finds from the house, including bronze and stone tools, loomweights, and other arte- facts. Additional progress on identifying foreign ceramic imports to Kommos was made in 2003 thanks to the expertise of several visiting scholars. Proposals for consolidation of the site and preparation of walkways were approved and further work is planned for 2004.'

La Rosa (SAIA) reports on the 2003 season: 'The campaign of survey and study in Hagia Triada concen- trated at the structures immediately N of the 'muraglione a denti' (toothed massive wall). It has been possible to reconstruct a sequence of architectural phases for LM IIIA2 which are cru- cial for determining the history of this site. The stratigraphic sequences identified have thrown greater light on the chrono- logical phases of the surface level in the area of the courtyards which succeeded each other in the area of the so-called agora. A pithoid olla, which had not been noticed by Halbherr's exca- vations, was interred in the floor of a house. It probably con- tained tools for the production of necklaces and, generally, poor quality jewels. Using non-destructive examination with portable X-ray fluorescence instruments, a team from the University of Catania began analysis of about 60 obsidian sam- ples which come from stratigraphic contexts of Phaistos and Hagia Triada, in order to establish the concentration of trace elements. Primary results allow us to recognize the provenance of the obsidian, which in one case comes from one of the caves of Melos whilst in an another may come either from the small island of Yali or the area opposite on the Anatolian coast'. Pitsidia. D. Chatzi-Vallianou (Archaeological Institute of Crete) provides a detailed report in ADelt 52 (1997) 1057-63 on the continued excavation at the M farmstead, which was destroyed by earthquake. Traces of fire were limited to certain parts of the site. Ground floor deposits and upper floor collapse material were found in various rooms. Highlights include: (room II) the stone tools, decorated pottery and a pithos com-</page><page sequence="82">82 JAMES WHITLEY parable with Neopalatial examples from Phaistos and Agia Triada; (room X) a staircase with fine stone steps preserved in situ. Pottery dates to LM IB. In room XI finds included a seal- stone, conical cups, stone pounders, obsidian blades and a per- forated shell suggest that this area was used for storage and workshop activities. In corridor XXIII tests revealed Old Palace period pottery including conical cups, a bridge spouted jar and amongst other finds a lump of pumice, all of which suggest the existence of a structure on the site comparable to the Neopalatial farmstead. DEMOS MOIRON Moni Odigitrias. A. Vasilakis (23rd EPCA) and K. Branigan (BSA) report on the Greek-British intensive survey of the area immediately N of the Moni Odigitria: 'The principal objective was to try to identify the human landscape which was contemporary with the prepalatial ceme- tery of Moni Odigitrias. A joint publication project for the cemetery is presently in progress and the survey was intenced to place the tombs in their context. The secondary objective was to place the Prepalatial history of the area into the broader pic- ture of PH settlement in the area. In addition it was intended to record all traces of human occupation in the area from the post- M to the end of the 19th Ct AD. The survey was conducted on a 100m grid, each hectare square of which (a 'field') was walked by a team of four super- visors and ten collectors. The collectors, at 10m intervals, each collected surface material from a 1m w. strip, so that a 10% sample was collected in each field. Records were taken of sur- face visibility in each field, and of any surviving structural remains. Sixty-one fields were surveyed, from which almost 6.000 sherds were collected. Minor finds included 12 pieces of chipped stone, 2 pieces of Rom glass, and a coin of 1659 AD. From this first rapid study of the pottery, probable sites and locations for more intensive work were identified. As a result of this rapid study, six fields were re-walked to produce a 20% sample and a more precise definition of concentrations of mate- rial within a field. Five sites were also selected for further inten- sive survey and planning. Finally, an important section cut by the recent making of the tarmac road to the monastery was iden- tified and drawn, and stratified material recovered from its eroding face. The earliest pottery recovered dates to the FNeo/EM I. There is not much of it, but it is concentrated around, and on, a hill S ofAgios Andoni. On the summit of the hill there are the remains of a circuit wall and house-walls; in the absence of other diag- nostic sherds, this site is tentatively dated at this stage to the FNeo/EM I. In any case, the pottery of this period confirms set- tlement in the area at the time that tholos A at Moni Odigitria was constructed. A little fine pottery of EM II was recovered at three locations to the W, NW and N of the tholos cemetery, together with coarse wares which may belong to this period. Comparison with fabrics from better-preserved material from the excavated tholos tombs may help to define this mate- rial. At present, indications are of small dispersed EM II settle- ments (farmsteads?) rather than one large nucleated settlement. Two of the locations with EM II material produced much larg- er quantities of MM I-MM II pottery, spread over areas large enough to suggest groups of buildings rather than isolated struc- tures. These settlement areas were about 500m apart. At the same time a house about 10m? with six or seven ground-floor rooms was built on a hill overlooking both of the settlements. Detailed collection on a 1m grid suggests that its storage rooms were probably on the N side of the building. This building and the settlement W of the monastery may not have survived the Old Palace period, but that N of the tombs was occupied through the LM I and in LM III. Domestic occupation of this upper area of the Ayiofarango catchment therefore extended well beyond that of the lower catchment (surveyed in 1970) which ended in MM I. There was no recognizable material of the Geo, Ar, or Cl periods, and only a small quantity of Hel and ER. This came from a flat shelf of land in the NE corer of the survey area, close to the course of the river. In the later Rom period this same area appears to have seen intensive use and occupation, with a spread of Rom pottery over a distance of 400m. Beyond its southern end the foundations of a small building, also apparent- ly Rom, survived on a hill. Further Rom material was found on flat ground (now an olive grove) W of the tholos cemetery, and included both fines wares and two pieces of fine glass vessels. Their survival might suggest the location of rock cut tombs used by the population of the settlement 400m to the N. Little mate- rial was found of the first Byz period, but the period from the 12th to the late 19th Ct was represented in most parts of the sur- vey area, but particularly in the vicinity of the monastery. Many fragmentary walls and a good spread of pottery indicated a heavily utilized area on the E facing slope 150m due W of the monastery. A substantial wall over a metre wide was also noted here and traced for about 70m in an E-W direction before it turned abruptly northwards. It was traced for a further 100m, at which point it had swung eastwards again and was running downslope towards the steep, deep valley that runs around the N side from the monastery and climbs up the opposite side of the valley before turning westwards. It appears that there was a substantial wall enclosing an area of about 6-7 hectares around the monastery at some point in its history'. DEMOS GORTYNAS Gortyna, Mitropolis Mandres. A. Vasilakis (23rd EPCA) reports in ADelt 52 (1997) 999 on the discovery of a subter- ranean Rom mausoleum, rectangular in shape (2.62 x 3.17m). Its walls were constructed of gypsum whereas the vaulted ceil- ing was of poros limestone. The mausoleum contained frag- mentary pottery and glass vessels, three bronze coins, a frag- mentary silver pin, a faience pendant and badly-preserved skeletal material. The mausoleum was surrounded by paving. In its immediate vicinity hut-shaped tombs were discovered but also burials within large amphoras. Finds include a coins of anc. Littos and the emperor Hadrian. The mausoleum and surround- ing tombs date to the first half of the 2nd Ct AD. In 2003 the works in Gortyna, conducted by SAIA and of the University of Milan, focused on the area S of the so-called Praetorium, between the Palaistra of the Gymnasium and the Byz aqueduct. This entire area is now flat, but a trial trench, 10m 1., has revealed that this situation is the result of a consid- erable mod. agricultural levelling, which has smoothed out the original curve or slope of the hill which corresponded to the lay- out of an anc. street, which has been already recognized further W. Excavations have also revealed that the original gradient of the slope was further interrupted by the collapse of a great struc- ture, which may have taken place during the 4th Ct AD. A trial trench (15 x 6m) demonstrated that this building leaned against a great polygonal basin, which was accessible via a stone stair- case. The building also included an apsidal room, which has been only partially excavated, built from large blocks of reused masonry. This building, of significant dimensions, extended in an E-W direction inside a group of houses which were orien- tated immediately S of the so-called Praetorium block. It seems likely that the two blocks were separated by the above men- tioned street. Part of the aqueduct was built upon the destruction</page><page sequence="83">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2003-2004 83 levels of this 4th Ct building; the aqueduct was still able to use the water of the cistern. In the area of the aqueduct we discov- ered a small area of the Byz city of the 7th Ct BC. The team unearthed three rooms which show signs of destruction and of the subsequent arrangement of the collapsed material, during the 7th-8th Ct AD, similar to those already noted elsewhere. The entire area is marked by the presence of large, post-anc. 'spoli- ation' trenches which were dug in order to recover architectur- al elements for reuse. The area of the Byz houses. In 2003 SAIA, in collaboration with a team from the University of Siena, carried out the second campaign of excavations in the area between the temple of Apollo Pythios and the so-called Praetorium, an area which is conventionally known as the 'Byzantine quarter'. Through a continuing series of investigations (geo-physical surveys con- ducted in 2001 were followed by a campaign of excavation in 2002) during which the area examined has been gradually expanded, the team has been able to assemble new data con- cering the events surrounding this section of the city during the last centuries of its life. It now seems likely that the urban plan of this area was significantly rearranged during EByz (Justinianic period). This was marked by the construction of a great rectangular two-story building whose levels were con- nected by a monumental staircase. The building opened towards the area of the temple of Apollo through a street or small square of paved pebbles. Towards the Praetorium area, on the other side, the building was linked with a large, unpaved, courtyard. The comprehensive plan as well as the function (possibly pub- lic) of this building remain unclear and they will have to be investigated further. For the moment, two phases of the build- ing are clearer, datable on the basis of conspicuous findings of coins, pottery and glass, to the first half of the 7th Ct and towards the middle/end of that century, when the great building was partially transformed into a workshop or production area. In one of the ground floor rooms we have in fact discovered a probable workshop for the production of knives and (goat)horn- handled saws. Dozens of these objects were discovered in asso- ciation with evident traces of fire to forge metal. Other craft activities (possibly connected to the production of glass objects) appear to have been carried out in the adjacent open spaces. A further occupation phase of the area could be dated to the late 7th/early 8th Ct AD. During this period the urban landscape was again subject to significant transformation. New workshops, largely devoted to tile production, were established among the anc. buildings, which were perhaps in a ruinous state by this time, and burials began to take place in the anc. courtyard (which by this point was probably abandoned). Praetorium and Byz houses. In 2003 SAIA in collaboration with Macerata University opened three excavation trenches in the Praetorium area. The first trial trench, which was opened to the S of the altar dedicated to the Supreme God, allowed us to clarify the problem of the connection between the occupation- levels of the stadium and those of the altar. Two perfectly-pre- served cippi were discovered beside the altar: the first was quadrangular, of the horns type, and bore a Latin inscription (a dedication ofVipsana Irena), while the second was of the small- column type. A second trial trench has been opened to the E of the stadium, in order to discover the location of NE corer of this structure. Here we have identified a structure made of blocks, which opened onto a paved courtyard, and which fol- lowed the axis of the road flanking the E side of the stadium. The Colini trenches (of 1971-74) of the so-called Hel temple have been cleaned, and accurate surveys of the monument have been conducted. We have also recovered significant elements of the temple which have allowed us to gain a clearer understand- ing of the plan of this structure. Further architectural elements pertinent to the temple were also collected. At the same time, we conducted a campaign of survey and study related to the materials which have been derived from the excavation of the Byz houses with a view to publication. Pythion theatre. In 2003 SAIA and the University of Padua carried out the second season of excavations of the Pythion Theatre of Gortyna, continuing work begun in the previous year, in order to produce an overall study of both the monu- mental complex itself and the nature of its relations with the surrounding urban context. Surface cleaning operations conducted in the cavea area, in which many wall elements were recognizable at surface level (lying on the ground or protruding from the earth) focused for the main part on the sector formerly occupied by the founda- tions of the media cavea. In the sector occupied by the ima cavea, we removed a great accumulation of mod. and contem- porary material and unearthed approximately half of the length of the extension of the surface of the praecinctio, which was placed on top of the first ambulacrum. Almost all of the revet- ment slabs of the praecinctio appear to have been plundered. The all-encompassing nature of the investigation has enabled us to begin study of the architectural structure of the cavea and to offer tentative reconstruction using two- and three-dimensional virtual computer models. In the sector of the scenic building of the theatre the excava- tion area of 2002 has been enlarged by opening a contiguous trial trench in a westerly direction, towards the temple of Apollo. In this sector our investigations revealed a sequence of deposits substantially similar to those discovered in the adjacent area. This sequence is very clearly marked by the presence of massive blocks in situ, which are remnants of the collapsed structure of the theatre. The great numbers of structural ele- ments that we discovered in situ indicate the excellent state of preservation of this monument (more than 6m in h.). It is of par- ticular note that, during the course of this campaign, the eastern aditus maximus has been revealed. It was limited by the first radial of the cavea, and constructed from great blocks of lime- stone, opus caementicium, facing bricks and small stone blocks. It was also decorated with a niche, with a protruding corbel to support a statue. From the study of the pottery, directed by F. Veronese, the start of the transformation of the complex may date to the 5-6th Cts AD, the collapse of the building to the 7-8th Cts AD, with the last phase of occupation occurring in the following centuries.

A. Lembesi (ASA) reports (Ergon 2003, 61-4) on the small-scale excavation which took place during restora- tion work. The western access to the Old Palace period building U was found: a long corridor from the main entrance to the largest room of the wing. Along the W wall of the corridor a poros limestone threshold 1.10m w. was found; its size and good construction suggest that the associated room was an important one. Other rooms had plaster-coated stone thresholds. New study has made it possible to link the NW and SW sections of the paved processional road on the plan. Drains alongside this road protected the interior of the peribolos from floods, so that cult activities on the krepidoma and ritual dining between the krepidoma and the peribolos could take place uninterrupted. EASTERN CRETE (Prefecture of Lasithi) (24th EPCA; 13th EBA) DEMOS MALION Malia, palace. V. Apostolakou (24th EPCA) reports in ADelt 52 (1997) 1050-1 on restoration work at the palace. O Pelon (EFA) reports on the 2003 study season: 'The study of pottery from the early excavations suggests a drastically different date for the last occupation phase of the palace. The first excavators proposed MM III (ca 1600 BC) whereas others have suggested LM IB (ca 1450 BC) as is the case with many Cretan sites. This phase of occupation, and sub- sequent destruction, is now dated to around LM IA (ca 1500 BC), contemporary with the great eruption of the volcano of Santorini. M. Seferiades studied 2000 pieces (nodules, nuclei, sherds, splinters, lamellae) from the Palace. Most of the pieces of cut obsidian come from the earliest level (EM) and special emphasis was given to the nature of the raw materials, the cut- ting process and the typology of the pieces.' AMe: tWMI AOFER-UROEr ArdPl?k: X* WILLES ECOLE FRCWE DATfAENES 0 1 2 3 4 Sm Area E. I. Bradfer-Burdet and K. Gilles (EFA) report on the 2003 excavation season: 'This year's aim was to complete the architectural study of house E and to begin the investigation of the other two build- ings to the E. Houses E, Ea and Ep were cleared and a clear view of the organization of the access routes in relation to the three small streets which surround house E has been gained. Other houses which seem to belong to this complex include on one side, several buildings situated to the E of the Ruelle Nord as well as house Ea (although only a course of great blocks, ori- ented N/S, is visible today) and, on the other side, a house cor- ner NW of house which fills a gap in the existing plans. The final cleaning of house E has allowed completion of the study of the rooms situated W of the courtyard-porch (rooms 4 and 5) near the road which leads to the site. The three outlying rooms to the S (20-22) jut out from the facade and are the product of a late construction which extended over the little blocked street. A stone canal which follows the line of the S wall provides water, redirected through several terracotta canals, for two rooms with a well-preserved thick 'terrazza' floor. Walls dating to the Myc reoccupation phase on the E side at the junction of the E limit and house Ea, has prevented any detailed observa- tion of these structures (rooms 30-37). This complicated area was used as a public space before access from the Northern Street was blocked. Houses Ea and El were cleaned (Fig. 98). The walls situated S of house Ea were incorporated into this structure and increased its surface coverage by a third. The plan of house Ep, S of Ea, was completed this year. The general ori- entation is slightly different, because it corresponds to the ori- entation of the small street which separates this building from house E and from the structures discovered between the street to the E and the rooms of house E which jut out in a southerly direction. The discovery of a stuccoed ground floor, and of a paved light well inside this Protopalatial house, prompted urgent conservation. The good preservation of this building makes this house a study case for M urban organization. Although geophysical survey work has already revealed the maximum extension of the city of Malia during the MBA, the extent of the Neopalatial city is still largely unknown. The architectural observations that we have been able to make, in terms of building techniques, functional organization or chronology, testify to the "j~. value and usefulness of this form of project.'

Kelly began a study of Rom pottery as well as of the architectural remains of this period which were unearthed during successive campaigns of excavation from 1989-96. The aim of her work is to produce an integrated analysis devoted to this period in the Malia plain. E. Coqueugniot began a study of the stone tools (mainly obsidian); 5000 pieces were studied, deriving from archaeological zone A (of the 1989-91 cam- paigns). In the context of a study on the Pre-palatial period in Malia and its surroundings, Y. Papadatos iden- ) tified EM pottery among the sherds collected in 1995-6. S.

Ph. Betancourt (ASCS) and E. Stravopodi (EPS) report: 'The 2003 season was the third year of work with the mate- rial from the M secondary burial cave at Hagios Charalambos, in the plain of Lasithi in E Crete. The project is investigating a cave used as an ossuary for bones and burial goods ranging in date from Neo to LM IA. Most of the objects were deposited within a short period during MM IIB. Coordination between the excavation and the geological studies by P. Karkanas con- tributed important new information on the history of the cave and the sequence of events associated with its use. Millions of years ago, the cave formed at the contact between a deposit of dolomite and a deposit of limestone, where a crack between the two types of bedrock allowed water to flow down into the ground and dissolve the rocks to form a cavern. It was original- ly a swallow-hole that drained the Lasithi plain, before erosion and tectonic movements lowered the plain to its present level. After the cavern no longer functioned as a drain for rainwater and melted snow that collected in the plain, travertine forma- tions (stalactites, stalagmites, and crusts) formed inside it. When the Minoans arrived in MM II, the cave was empty and clean, with no soil inside. The sediment history suggests that they placed human bones in some of the upper rooms first. For the lower room (room 5), they built two terrace walls on a thin crust of travertine that covered the slanting floor. One wall was built across the room, and another was at the lowest part of the chamber, where a hole led down into room 7. Bones were care- fully laid behind the terrace walls. A brief time passed, and the deposition was then completed, and skulls and long bones were collected and placed on top of the deposit. At a later time, the crust at the back of the room (the mod. area 3) collapsed, and both bones and artefacts settled into a crevice and spilled down into room 7 below. The terrace wall at the entrance to room 7 also collapsed, causing more movement of bones and artefacts. Pottery and other objects found in 2003 contribute to our knowledge of the people who were buried in the cave. As the work last season confirmed, the cave was an ossuary where a secondary deposit of bones and artefacts was placed in MM II after the items were collected from their previous burial place. The earlier burial place was probably a large tomb or a series of tombs. The main deposition ended in MM IIB, but a few visi- tors continued to visit the mouth of the cave and leave artefacts until early in LM I. Probably the rooms inside the cave were no longer accessible after MM IIB. The earliest material in the cave consists of pottery from the Neo period. Most of the pieces from the EBA (Hagios Onouphrios Ware from EM I and EM IIA; Vasiliki Ware and a few contemporary pieces from EM IIB) were deposited in the cave's upper rooms (1-4), which were excavated by Davaras between 1976 and 1983. A majori- ty of the objects from the lower room (5), excavated in 2002 and 2003, are from EM III to MM II. The latest M objects con- sist of a very few pieces from LM IA to LM III, all found at the entrance of the cavern and outside it, suggesting that the site was visited by a few people many years after the time of its use as an ossuary. A series of four small trenches excavated just outside the original entrance to the cave showed showed that the dynamit- ing that exposed the cave in 1976 had removed almost all traces of what was in front of the cave mouth. Only a small lens of original black soil (in situ at original ground level) and a few lenses of similar but displaced soil remained to supply informa- tion on the events when the cave was in use. This soil was care- fully excavated and retained for study. The soil contained MM pottery, large amounts of charcoal, and many animal bones, . ..i .14 * - l. 3 I I I.2 2 4 99 Crete, Agios Charalambos cave: figurines with butcher marks on many of the small pieces. Among the animals represented were sheep or goat, pig, cattle, and a small mammal, possibly hare. Some of the animal bones were burned. This evidence suggests that the deposition of the bones in the underground ossuary was probably accompanied by ritual feast- ing at the mouth of the cave, and that the worshippers consumed the meat from several different species of animals. When the entrance was discovered in 1983, it was a nearly vertical hole leading down toward room 1, filled completely with black soil. Like the lenses found in 2003, this suggests that the worship- pers filled the front of the cave with the soil after the cere- monies that commemorated the closing of the cave. Important finds include two hippopotamus ivory female fig- urines, a monkey figurine also made of ivory, beads of rock crystal, serpentine and other stones, stone vases, both whole and fragmentary clay vases, and other objects. These artefacts help reconstruct the life of the community buried in the cave. New fragments of the Egyptian musical instrument called the sistrum were found in 2003. One complete instrument and several fragments were discovered in 2002, and the new frag- ments now complete two additional examples of the instrument. Additional fragments suggest the cave may have had as many as five sistra. They are all made of Cretan clay, but not a type local to Hagios Charalambos. A reconstruction of the type of clay sistrum used at Hagios Charalambos indicates the clay objects are fine musical instruments and not necessarily sym- bolic examples used only for the grave. The discovery of two new female figurines in 2003 (Fig. 99) brings the total number of human figurines from the site to seven. This is a substantial corpus for a small inland site, but more remarkable is the variety of materials and styles. The two figurines found this year are made from hippopotamus ivory, as is one other figurine. The others are of marble, shell, animal bone, and green volcanic stone. Several styles of carving are represented. A carved stone bull's head used as a pendant was found dur- ing the excavation. The carving is of interest for its relatively naturalistic style and its rare material, a mottled pale blue and white stone. It is of interest for its early date, as MM IIB carv- ings are usually more stylized, so that it represents an early example of the naturalism that would be more prevalent in MM III and later. Most of the pottery from the site consists of cups and small pouring vessels. The majority of the pieces are locally made,</page><page sequence="86">86 JAMES WHITLEY either in Lasithi itself or in the adjacent Pediada.

Agios Nikolaos Archaeological Museum. V. Apostolakou (24th EPCA) reports on museum and conservation work in ADelt 52 (1997) 1043. Azoria. D. Haggis and M.S. Mook (ASCS) report on the 2003 excavation season: 'The primary target areas of excavation were the peak, S slope, and NE area of the S acropolis (areas A and B) (Fig. 100). The goals of excavation are (a) to understand the form of the Ar Cretan city by extensive exploration of the 7th, 6th and early 5th Ct BC levels of the settlement, which in size and formal fea- tures indicate an urban structure (city planning, monumental architecture, an andreion complex with centralized food storage and processing areas); (b) to recover stratigraphic evidence for changes in economy and sociopolitical systems in the transition from the EIA to the Ar period; (c) to explore the FNeo, Late Prepalatial, and LM IIIC-Late Geo levels; the study of the early pre-Ar history of the site contributes to our understanding of settlement systems in the broader region, while providing use- ful comparative contexts for analyzing the political economy of the Ar town. Four areas were explored in 2003: The SE slope (B600; B 1100; B 1300) Excavation conducted in B600 (N of the corridor house in B300 excavated is 2002) recovered a 1 Om segment of a megalithic terrace wall that runs N-S from the E end of B200. The wall borders a wide street along its E side, which appears to bank up the slope on the N and to continue around the E side of the peak, connecting the buildings on the S slope with those on the NE. The street, about 3-4m w., is supported by the E extension of the spine wall which runs around the E side of the hilltop, forming the back wall of rooms of a building below in B 1300 and B 1100. B 1300 and B 1100. Excavation E of the street in B600 revealed a series of three connected rooms, on a level lower than the street and utilizing the E segment of the megalithic spine wall (B 1300 and B 1100). The architecture and the earliest preserved floor deposits suggest that the building was constructed in the Ar period, but was reused in the 3rd Ct BC, since there are several significant Hel constructions built directly on top of Ar roofing material. One addition, in the N room of B 1100, is a refuse pit which was retained by a small single-faced screen wall. The preserved depth of the dump is about 1 .Om on the W, sloping to about 0.50m on the E where the building's E wall and surface have eroded away. The material included animal bones, shells, pottery, terracotta lamps, three iron points, a piece of copper, a terracotta bull figurine, three loomweights, four iron nails, one bronze nail, one bronze pin, and two stamped amphora handles. SW Terrace (B800; 1200; 700 and 1500). Excavation in four trenches on the SW side of the S acropolis revealed a series of three rooms forming parts of two buildings: from N to S, B1500, B700 and B1200. The buildings were constructed in the 7th Ct, remodelled in the 6th, and abandoned at the end of the 5th</page><page sequence="87">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2003-2004 87 Ct. The Ar builders, however, altered the topography of the area, destroying earlier LM IIIC-Geo buildings, but preserving an LM IIIC surface under the 7th Ct floor packing in B 1200. The two N rooms (B1500 and 700) both suffered catastrophic destructions. Burnt debris, carbonized wood and burnt plant material is found among the roofing material and habitation debris throughout. Frequently the yellow-green clay floor and roofing clay are burnt red with patches of ash and carbon. The largest N room, B1500, is about 22 m2 in area (ca 4.30 x 5.00m), with a stone bench in the SW corner and a rectangular hearth in the middle of the room. In the hearth itself was found a terracotta strainer, and next to it, outside the hearth, a cookpot. The room's contents include nine pithoi, 23 stone tools, six lekanae, an exaleiptron, a black glass oinochoe, a black-figure skyphos, a small mortar, a lekythos, four amphoras, two cookpots, one small pithoid jar, two hydrias, four high-necked cups, as well as bowls, terracotta loomweights, spindle whorls, and stone and terracotta lids. Also found were a terracotta bull figurine, a bronze balance pan, two bronze fishing hooks, a bronze nail, an iron ring; an iron nail, a terracotta bead, and a calcite bead. Botanical remains include olives, grapes, wheat, and possibly barley. A doorway, through the N wall leads into yet another room left unexcavated in 2003. A doorway in the E end of the S wall leads into a room in B700, a storeroom of smaller dimensions (2.50 x 4.50m) that contained seven pithoi, four amphoras, three hydrias, a lamp, two high-necked cups, one plate, one spouted cookpot, and one bowl, as well as two large stone mortars. While the destruction date of the room in B700 is late 6th or E 5th Ct, the neighboring room to the S (B 1200) went out of use at the end of the 7th Ct. The room is the smallest by far (2.20 x 4.50m) and its function is not certain. A test below the floor of this S room revealed that it was con- structed on top of a surface of LM IIIC date, and below this, a sequence of four FNeo surfaces associated with at least two architectural phases. The extant Neo architecture consists of two walls, the back walls of two separate buildings. The walls run at oblique angles, roughly E-W, converging on the E side of the terrace, creating a rather narrow triangular exterior space between two separate buildings. In addition to pottery, a large number of dark gray, black, and red chert blades, flakes, pro- duction materials was recovered, in addition to a bone awl and several basalt beads. The NE area (A1700; 2300-2400; 1800; 2100-2200). Work in the NE area of the peak was a continuation of excavation that began in 2002. The initial aim was to complete the excavation of the building in A300-400, exposing the SE quarter of the room, and two rooms to the SW in A1700 and A2300. The megalithic spine wall forms the NE limit of the rooms along this terrace. The doorway near the SW corner of the room in A400 (E wall) leads into yet another large room of similar dimensions (A1700), with a central pillar base and two pithos stands in the SE corer. Finds from the room included an agrimi horn, a sil- ver pin, and at least two pithoi. The E wall of the room has a doorway on the N which leads into a narrow corridor in A2300, 1.20m w., formed by the spine wall on the NE and a small stair on the S. The stair, a single course of stones about 1.10m w., ascends SW into a small triangular shaped room, about 2.00m N-S by about 1.50m E-W, utilizing the back eastern wall of A1700 as its western limit; along this wall is stone-built bin. The corridor continues E, past the stair, and then turns a sharp corner SW up a bedrock cut ramp bordered neatly on the E by a curving wall. Finds in the corridor, ramp and bin room consist of terracotta loomweights, a spindle whorl, a strip of bronze, and a large saddle quem. At the top of the ramp is a street that runs SE along the contour of the hill to a small bedrock court- yard or open area in front of the doorway of A2100, which is a kitchen. From the courtyard one could descend the steep slope of the hill in NE direction down to a curved stair that leads to a landing and street, which is preserved for a distance of some 7m along the inner face of the spine wall. The kitchen in A2100 is very well preserved, exhibiting the evidence of the ubiquitous burnt destruction. The room conforms to the contours of the slope, utilizing bedrock extensively in E, W, and S walls. The S wall is unusual, curving with the natural terrain. Two limestone post bases were found in the centre of the room, and a small hearth in the SE corer. A single worked limestone block forms a small bench, seat or work platform in the NW corer of the room, utilizing a rise in the bedrock at this location for its foun- dation. Finds in the room include a small pithos, a set of five ground stone tools, including a small quern, a strainer (set against the SW post base), a fine cup, a coarse skyphos, and a large lekane with reflex handles. Other finds include a large ter- racotta weight, three pieces of iron, and a piece of lead. Botanical remains from the room include weed seeds, olives, grapes, wheat, and a number of unidentified grains and pulses. The W Slope (A 1900 and A2000). Work on the W slope in 2003 explored the area S of A800, in efforts to expose more of the andreion complex excavated in 2002. While a doorway in the S wall of A800, suggested the existence of another room to the S, excavation focused on the southernmost room of the andreion complex in A2000. Here, a megalithic wall, construct- ed up against the fill and retaining wall of the W slope, formed the back wall of a spacious room, exactly 9m 1., and about 3m w. The S wall of the room is constructed of large boulders on a bedding of smaller boulders and cobbles. The room's N wall leads through a doorway into A1900. Thus A800, A1900, and A2000 form a series of rooms connected by doorways. Finds from A2000 include a terracotta krater stand, similar to those recovered in A800 and A1400 in 2002, a pithos, several cups, a terracotta loom weight, and an iron nail. While the floor was well preserved across the room, the western edge was severely slipped and eroded. As was the case in A800, this room does not appear to have suffered the burnt destruction apparent across so much of the site. The lack of burning may indicate that the room was reoccupied and reused until the final Ar abandonment in the first quarter of the 5th Ct BC.' Lato. A guidebook is now available: V.

Whitley (BSA) reports on the 2003 study season: 'Material picked up in the 1993, 1994 and 1998 fieldwalking seasons of the Praisos survey was studied. Work concentrated on material from 'sites' located in 1993 and 1994 (sites 1-63). Points worth noting are: M Tripod legs: most of our tripod legs should be characterized as 'thin ovals', which would, in most typologies, place them firmly in the EM III-MM III peri- od. Final Neo/EMI sites: we can infer that there are four of these (40.1, 40.2, 17 and 18). Re-occupation of sites: the MM 'guard tower' at site 27 was re-occupied in LM III times. Site 18 has Final Neo and Or-Ar phases, not Cl as previously thought. Site 52 is a rich deposit just below and to the SW of the Third acropolis of Praisos. Material identified here includes what may be a fragment of a paw from a terracotta lion, similar to two Ar examples found by Bosanquet now in the Heraklion museum. There is also abundant C1 and Hel material from this site. There are two possible interpretations. First, it may be part of a destruction deposit, or it may represent Halbherr's and Bosanquet's excavation dump. Site 14 (Prophitis Ilias): B. Erickson looked at this material in 1999, and identified much of it (particularly the bases) as Ar (Fig. 101). The apparent uniformity of the assemblage and the presence of two wasters led him to suggest that the material was not from a sanctuary but from a kiln. Re-examination of some of the fabrics by J. Moody does not support this interpretation. The fabrics of the pottery are not uniform. Some Ar bases have distinctive inclusions of 'sponge spicules' which can only come from clay beds of late Tertiary date, that is beds much closer to the sea than those close to Praisos. It seems this is a sanctuary (to Zeus?) after all. Cl and Hel periods: re-study of material from site 55, the area of the city's necropolis to the S of the first acropolis, con- firms that the vessels were clearly made for burials, and could have had no 'domestic' use.

Professor Didier Viviers (EFA) reports: 'The 2003 campaign was entirely devoted to an archaeolog- ical survey of the territory and the study of material from the various sectors of the excavation. Study of the necropolis data has allowed us to distinguish phases of utilization of the necrop- olis and a graphical reconstruction of the funerary monuments has been proposed. Progress was made in the examination of Ar, Cl, Hel and Rom ceramic material; precise observations on the Ar and Cl material were made and the proportion of the Hel and Rom material over the entire survey area was noted. The locally produced pottery (which, for these periods, is relatively ill-known) was examined in relation to the stratigraphy. We have been able to identify almost 20 Ar settlements (some EAr, from the late 8th /early 7th Ct BC) as well as 20 Cl sites; only a few of these sites had been recognized previously. The wide dis- tribution of these finds (Atzikiari, Itanos, Kalamaki, Soros, Stephanes, Travouni, Vamies) confirms that the whole of the surveyed area was used during the Ar and Cl periods.'

J. A. MacGillivray, H. Sackett and J. Driessen (BSA) report on the 2003 excavation season: 'Stratigraphic tests were made in buildings 4, 6 and 7 (pre- viously excavated in 1986-96) to provide important supple- mentary information for the final publication. New light was thrown on the early history of each building. Building 4 had been excavated only to the well-appointed LM IIIA2/B stage. The new tests exposed the LM I phase of the building and showed that its occupation went back to the beginning of the NeoPalatial period (MM IIIA). Earlier strata (MM II) predate the present structure. Due to the steep rise of the ground from SE to NW, the stratigraphic sequence at the W was concentrated within ca 35cm, floor levels being tightly superimposed or re- used, whereas at the E deep fills occurred, including a rich LM IB burnt destruction deposit in a pillar basement (Fig. 102). Dining and kitchen equipment found here, much of it fallen from an upper floor, included ogival cups (Fig. 103), cookpots, a grill, two beehive 'kalathoi', a bronze lamp and evidence for diet (bones of piglet, sheep and goat). The early history of building 6 was clarified: a MM II build- ing was replaced in MM IIIA by the fine court complex now known. After suffering episodes of earthquake and flooding, this was deliberately looted and dismantled and the latest (LM IA) phase can be characterized as minimal (even 'squatting'). A very large area of Santorini tephra (up to 25cm deep and con- centrated in a wide hollow or pit) was associated with LM IA pottery, and micromorphological profiles were taken, as in a number of other areas. These should provide useful new evi- dence for the history of the site by identifying climatic condi- tions and sequences in some detail.

Building 7 was re-examined by means of deep soundings in several rooms. Below the re-occupation floors, without inter- mediate Neopalatial strata, was found an important sequence of early levels (EM I-MM II), which has added greatly to our knowledge of the early history of this part of the town site. Finds include a large MM IIA bowl, and a jug found inside it. A test in the area immediately adjacent to building 5 revealed a strong Neopalatial retaining wall, as much as 2m high, the original SE limit of building 5. This shows that build- ing had been terraced deeply, at the time of its foundation, into the early strata of an adjacent hill, and in the Re-occupation periods following the LM IB destructions the property line of building 7 had been moved N to encroach on the now burnt-out shell of building 5.' Zakros, Palace. L. Platon (ASA) reports (Ergon 2003, 66) on the continued study of finds from the palace in preparation for publication. On site, remains dating to the Old Palace period, located below the E wing of the later palace were cleared. S.

WESTERN CRETE (Prefecture of Chania) (25th EPCA' 13th EBA) DEMOS CHANION Chania. M. Andreadaki-Vlasaki (25th EPCA) reports in ADelt 52 (1997) 1003-4 on museum and conservation work in 1997. Splantzia quarter. M. Andreadaki-Vlasaki (25th EPCA) reports in ADelt 52 (1997) 1004-8 on the 77 x 8.90m area on O. Daskalogianni excavated in preparation for the installation of a sewage pipeline. The area excavated is adjacent to the Papadopoulos plot reported in ADelt 44 (1989) 449-51, AAA 21 (1988) 56-76, AR 1995-96, 47) and the Kaniamou plot reported in ADelt 47 (1992) 566-71, AR 1997-98, 122-3 which had revealed important M building remains, including a frescoed lustral basin and the exterior comer of a Neopalatial building associated with deposits of conical cups, cooking vessels and animal bones. Apart from the extensive and important M remains (to be incorporated into the Old Town's archaeological park), a Cl pit, a Venetian drain, and a few wells and small Ot installations were found. Along the S end of the excavated area and near the Venetian church of St Rocco, sections of a LM IIIA-B building was located, with traces of an earlier MM IA structure incorporated into the former. There is evidence that the building was associated with storage but its largest section had been destroyed by a 4th Ct BC pit which contained large quantities of pottery, many figurines and loomweights, associ- ated with a yet undiscovered contemporary kiln site. The LM IIIA-B building had earth floors and in one of the rooms five bronze stone mason's tools were found. Building remains dat- ing to LM III were limited to this region, apart from isolated instances such as the large pit and pottery kiln. N of the LM III building the most important building of M Kydonia was located. Its construction dates to MM III and its final destruction by fire to LM IB. The frescoed lustral basin, located at the Papadakis plot, belongs to the same structure. The entire S end of the building was badly damaged by a pit con- taining pottery attributed to the Kydonian workshop and dating to LM IIIA, B and C. The pit is probably associated with the LM III kiln located further to the N. In the same region three wells had been cut into bedrock. The S entrance of the building had a monumental threshold which opened up to a polythiron room with two light wells, one paved, the other with a plaster floor. The polythiron room is linked to an exterior space associ- ated with a square platform like feature at its centre. Along the SE side deposits of complete conical cups were discovered. The area was much disturbed due to the LM III pottery kiln which had been built on top of the platform structure. Further to the NW, additional exterior areas are associated with deposits of conical cups and faunal material. The N half of the excavated area has a series of rooms, some of which are basements, one with a pillar, and associated with deposits of conical cups. The excavator considers that the entire area was associated with ritual practices which took place at interior and exterior parts of this important building, palatial in character.

Andreadaki-Vlasaki notes work at other sites: sidestreet Siphaka (Naxakis plot) (Venetian and mod. fills but also traces of earth and pebble floors dating to LM IB, LM II and LM IIIA1, a foundation pit for an LM III wall and rubbish pits dating to LM IIIA2 - ADelt 1008); 0.

The two main architectural phases are associated with MM IA and B pot- tery. The walls of the building were covered by white plaster, large quantities of which was collected from the destruction deposit. Some floors were covered with red plaster, others were of earth. Along the W sector food preparatory areas were defined by the presence of cooking vessels and large hearths which were associated with ash and charcoal. The second archi- tectural phase is associated with the addition of a second floor. In the S area several rubbish pits associated with various phas- es were excavated and contained pottery, animal bones, shells, obsidian blades fragmentary stone vases and stone tools. LM IIIC1 occupation is defined by the discovery of pits cut into bedrock which contained black soil, ash, pottery, bones, stone and bone tools and obsidian blades. M. Andreadaki-Vlasaki and E.

E. Papadopoulou (25th EPCA) reports in ADelt 52 (1997) 1040-1 on an important LM III tholos tomb, of 4.60m di. and 4.31m h. Structurally intact, the entrance is 1.95m h., 0.86m w. and 1.10m 1., and its dromos 13.70m 1. and 1.90 w. The tholos was found robbed. Apart from the much-dis- persed and poorly preserved skeletal material, fragments of two larakes with lids were found. There are fragmentary remains of bronze knives, or daggers, but also of clay vessels such as kylikes, conical cups, stirrup jars and cooking pots. Small finds include an amygdaloidal sealstone, beads of various materials and shapes, bone inlays, presumably attached either to a bronze knife or wooden box. Pottery dates the use of the tomb to LM IIIA2 and LM IIIB. Mylopotamos.

At least one of the rooms was covered with a mosaic floor. with the sealing of the earliest ritual ditches, which are dated to the initial phase of LM IIIC period. Lastly, a trial trench opened on the S plateau has allowed us to clarify the plan of the Rom building A2. We have discovered the floor level in the area in front of the step-shaped structure as well as clear indications, in the N part of the W wall, of a door space which is symmetrical with a similar aperture on the eastern wall of the building.' DEMOS KOURITON Apodoulou. Professor Louis Godart reports: 'The combined Greek-Italian Mission continued the excava- tion of the M settlement. The campaign of 2003 focused on the SW side of Goures hill, where four rooms dated to around the end of MM IIB were unearthed during the excavations of 2001-2002. Five new rooms excavated. This work has allowed us to connect the four previous rooms discovered in 2001-2002 with the group of structures brought to light during previous seasons (1985-2000). In particular, we have been able to reveal a long corridor flanked by a terrace wall which divides the set- tlement in two sections. The group of structures can be dated to the last phase of MM IIB. The end of the settlement could be attributed to a fire destruction which may, in all likelihood, be related to an earthquake or other seismic disturbance'.

Karamaliki (25th EPCA) reports in ADelt 52 (1997) 1041-2 on the excavation of Rom tombs set in two rows and consisting of tile graves and built cist graves, associated with a variety of offerings; some of the graves had been robbed or badly damaged. DEMOS SYBRITOU Thronos/Kephala (anc. Sybrita). Dr Anna Lucia d'Agata reports: 'In 2003 a joint project between the CNR/ICEVO and the 25th EPCA carried out a new excavation campaign on the site of Thronos/Kephala (anc. Sybrita). In building 3 the excavation mainly concerned the Western Room. Here the archaeologists removed, almost entirely, the filling levels below the most anc. level of use, where, in 2002, an exceptional krater (THK02/1.1) was discovered. Along the W wall there are indications of the presence of hearths in association with occupation levels which at present cannot be traced beyond the western wall, and relat- ed to an occupation layer which predated the construction of this building. This occupation is dated to the LM IIIC period. In the E area of the room a trial trench has been dug, to bedrock. Below the most anc. filling stratum, associated with the foun- dations of the Western Room, we excavated a level whose mate- rials have been dated to the LM IIIC period. Lastly, on the rocky bank immediately NE of building 3, we discovered cistern 922, whose period of use seems to coincide with the most anc. phase of the building itself. The cistern seems to have been abandoned in an early phase of the PG period. The results of the excavations conducted in building 3 are very important for the reconstruction of the site. They confirm, as hypothesized by the author of the report, that on the N plateau of Kephala the beginning of the settlement coincides SOURCES OF ILLUSTRATIONS ARF (TAP) ASA (B.
