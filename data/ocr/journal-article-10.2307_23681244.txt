<plain_text><page sequence="1">Charles W. Collier*, Gainesville (FL) A Legal Theory of Tolerance and Perspective Abstract This article first sketches out the broad intellectual background to the problem of disa greement, with special reference to the varied meanings of tolerance in philosophy, polit ical theory, and law. Each of these intellectual contexts of tolerance is then explored in greater depth. In the philosophical context, the project (common to Descartes and Husserl) of „transcending perspectives" is interpreted as the basic precondition for a theory of toler ance. In the context of political theory, the historical and conceptual underpinnings of the neutrality principle (particularly as represented in John Rawls' recent Political Liberalism) are analyzed and criticized. The final part of the article presents the essentials of a legal theory of tolerance and perspective. Here, the philosophical and political concepts of tol erance are modified in light of the special characteristics and requirements of a legal system. I. Introduction Many scholars of constitutional law have despaired of articulating a „general theory" of the first amendment. I think that they have not gone deep enough. Admittedly, one will not find such a theory at the level of caselaw. Professors Shiffrin and Choper, for example, state on the first page of their casebook that „The first amendment... embod[ies] a variety of competing values [that] are best studied in notes and questions as they emerge from concrete cases rather than from an ab stract characterization and classification."1 They go on to say that „The Court has approached ... the first amendment.. . without a commitment to any general theo ry."2 Professors Farber, Eskridge, and Frickey argue that „none of the foundational theories inspired the writing of the First Amendment, none of them reconciles most of Professor of Law and Philosophy, University of Florida; Alexander von Humboldt Research Fellow, University of Frankfurt.

Collier the decided cases, and none of them is even a satisfactory overall normative theo ry."3 One will also not find a „general theory" at the level of the many and varied „ration ales" that have been offered for protecting free expression.4 Other commentators - for example, Professors Stone, Seidman, Sunstein, and Tushnet - discuss the „phi losophy underlying the first amendment,"5 but what they describe is not really philos ophy. The „marketplace of ideas" or „search for truth" notion belongs to the sociology of knowledge and perhaps economic theory.6 The „self-governance" rationale for pro tecting speech is really social or political theory.7 And the self-fulfillment or autonomy rationale might best be described as social psychology.8 But there is a true philosophy of free expression, and it serves historically and conceptually as the basis for the subsequent legal concept of tolerance. It is „philo sophical" in the sense of concerning basic issues of perception, belief, and cognition. According to the standard account of the development of knowledge, it progressed from a „subjective" to an „objective" view of the world. There is some truth to this account if we concentrate, first, on primitive „animism," „anthropomorphism," and mythology; then on, say, modern physical science. But this progression leaves out at least two important steps in between: an equally primitive „objectivism," and the Ren aissance discovery of the subjective „point of view" as a scientific and artistic truth. After these developments, the emergence of modern physical science, its infinite uni verse, and its attempt to transcend all perspectives represent something of a step backward. But my mission is not primarily directed to the development of science, or even to the growth of knowledge; my subject is the concept of tolerance in its historical emer gence and self-definition. The concept of tolerance provides the „deep background" to the first amendment's protection of expression, opinion, and religion. Tolerance consists, paradoxically, first in recognizing that all perception, belief, and cognition arise out of a specific, particular, individual, and limited perspective on the world; and, second, in transcending that perspective. In other words, the subjec tive point of view first had to be discovered, before it could then be overcome. Con ceptually and historically prior to the idea of tolerating different opinions and points of Daniel A. Farber, William N. Eskridge, Jr. &amp; Philip P.

Bollinger, The Tolerant Society (1986), that free speech symbolizes our con frontation with the impulse to intolerance, is so general as to be fully compatible with the position articulated below and probably with many others as well.

But the development of a concept of tolerance also has in common with „liberal science" the project of surmounting or transcending perspec tives, which is why the growth of knowledge also cannot fail to be an integral part of the development of tolerance. In what follows, therefore, I shall treat the problem of tolerance in progressively more external and institutionalized contexts, ranging from the theoretical (Part II), to the practical (Part III), and finally to the legal context (Part IV). II. The Theoretical Project of Transcending Perspectives A. The Prehistory of Tolerance and Perspective The problem of intolerance, and the need for tolerance, arise out of the fact of disa greement. But conceptual or intellectual disagreements over matters of fact or opin ion are themselves only a highly refined subset of more basic differences in points of view or perspective. „Differences of perspective" - understood informally, metaphor ically - suggest and reveal differences of perspective in a deeper and more literal sense that encompasses, inter alia, our perception and knowledge of the physical world. Differences of this sort are truly radical in scope and dwarf in importance mere differences of opinion. Indeed, it is not immediately clear how we could even come to have different perspectives on something so basic as the physical world. And in fact an immense intellectual exertion and a lengthy historical development were required before even the conditions of that possibility could be discovered, acknowledged, and eventually enshrined as the „subjective point of view." Prior to that development - which in the case of spatial perspective can be traced roughly to the representational art of the Renaissance, and in the case of temporal perspective to Kant's critical philosophy - the conditions for the possibility of radical, perceptual disagreement had not even been articulated. Instead, through long „prehistories" of spatial and temporal perspec tive, the novel idea that there even was, or could be, a „point of view" on the world only gradually emerged out of more or less „objective" conceptions of space and time.9 Once the idea of a radically perspectival point of view appeared in full force, how ever, it posed stunning problems for epistemology, political theory, and (eventually) law. Only the most serenely detached of philosophers could countenance the possi bility that just as one and the same city, looked at from different sides, appears entirely different and is as if multiplied perspectively; so also it happens that, as a result of the infinite multitude of simple substances, there are as it were so many different universes, which are nev ertheless only perspectives of a single one, according to different points of view... .10 And only the most resolutely pessimistic of political theorists could calmly accept that such is the nature of men that . . . they will hardly believe there be many so wise as themselves; for they see their own wit at hand and other men's at a distance.... ... For every man looks that his companion should value him at the same rate he sets upon himself; and upon all signs of contempt or undervaluing naturally endeavors, as far 9 These issues will be elaborated in a forthcoming work tentatively entitled „The Prehistory of Toler ance and Perspective." 10 G.W. Leibniz, The Monadology § 57 (1714).</page><page sequence="4">62 Charles W. Collier as he dares ... to extort a greater value from his contemners by damage and from others by the example.... Hereby it is manifest that, during the time men live without a common power to keep them all in awe, they are in that condition which is called war, and such a war as is of every man against every man.11 Thus, the problems of radical differences in perspective urgently required resolution, usually by some means of „transcending" those differences. Ironically, the long and difficult recognition of the „point of view" led directly to its own transcendence, with the emergence of modern physical science being only the most prominent example.12 As a matter of intellectual history, the issue of tolerance emerged when it did in Western philosophy under certain specific social and historical conditions, notably disputes in religious thought.13 Montaigne and Locke, for example, maintained that our inability to attain shared, certain knowledge in religious matters was the strongest argument for religious toleration.14 Skepticism in these matters - as an epistemolog ical stance - commends tolerance as a political stance. Skepticism in this context has implications for disagreement as well. If differences (disagreements) in perspective cannot be resolved with certainty, perhaps one should be tolerant of all such perspectives. But transcending those perspectives, or other wise rendering them irrelevant, is also a means of dispelling disagreement. If per spectives no longer matter, one can tolerate them in the sense of being systematically indifferent to them. Thinkers like Leibniz, Descartes, and Husserl may be viewed as pursuing this line of reasoning in the realm of epistemology; John Rawls may be viewed as their suc cessor in political theory. Of course, these thinkers are nominally considered the great „internalists." They present arguments designed to break out of self-imposed condi tions of solipsism; their arguments are intended to yield certainty, not skepticism. Yet, as I shall emphasize in what follows, these arguments are designed above all to lead the reader out of conditions of entrapment within particular, limited, partial, and sub jective perspectives that no one else could be expected to share. In this way, these thinkers address the basic preconditions for a theory of tolerance. B. Transcendence Theories The problems of transcending perspective in philosophy, political theory, and law present a converging series of progressively narrower concerns. In philosophy, an array of transcendence theories suggest themselves: the view from no perspective („the view from nowhere"15); the view from all perspectives (God's point of view?16); the view from any perspective (intersubjectivity and convergence17); the view from 11 Thomas Hobbes, Leviathan ch. 13 (1651). 12 See generally Alexandre Koyré, From the Closed World to the Infinite Universe (1957); Martin Kemp, The Science of Art: Optical Themes in Western Art from Brunelleschi to Seurat (1990); John White, The Birth and Rebirth of Pictorial Space (1967); Samuel Y. Edgerton, Jr., The Heritage of Giotto's Geometry: Art and Science on the Eve of the Scientific Revolution (1991); Hubert Damisch, The Origin of Perspective (1994). 13 See Richard H. Popkin, The History of Scepticism from Erasmus to Descartes (1964). 14 See Michel de Montaigne, Apology for Raymond Sebond, in Complete Essays (Donald M. Frame trans. 1958); John Locke, A Letter Concerning Toleration (1689). 15 See Thomas Nagel, The View from Nowhere (1986). 16 See G.W. Leibniz, Discourse on Metaphysics § 14 (1686). 17 See Edmund Husserl, Cartesian Meditations §§ 42-62 (Dorion Cairns trans. 1970); Charles Sand</page><page sequence="5">A Legal Theory of Tolerance and Perspective 63 „the place of the other"18; and a principled, consistent indifference to perspective.19 One lesson Hegel derived from the difficult prehistory of perspective is that transcending a point of view cannot itself be a simple, one-sided negation, or the mere substitution of one perspective for another; rather, it must resemble what he termed an Aufhe bung: a transcending that retains some core of truth from that which is transcended - a subsuming and partial incorporation of it - in order to attain a more adequate view point. As Thomas Nagel has more recently, and repeatedly, insisted: „Reality is not just objective reality."20 There is an undeniable reality to the subjective point of view, as evidenced, for example, in the possibility of mistakes about one's own experiences and in the difficulty of conceptualizing a private language.21 The first stage in the development of a concept of tolerance is the recognition that there are indeed different and incompatible viewpoints on such fundamental matters as perception, belief, and cognition. The second stage consists in transcending that which is merely personal, partial, or subjective in these different viewpoints and attaining an impersonal, impartial, or objective vantage point. The main problem in articulating a realizable ideal of tolerance is to do justice to both the personal, partial, or subjective perspective and the impersonal, impartial, or objective perspective. The difficulty in conceiving of a legal regime of tolerance is the difficulty - writ large - of reconciling these contradictory standpoints within particular Individuals.22 A supremely objective, impartially conceived ideal of tolerance is use less if it does not and cannot command the personal assent of those individuals who would be governed by it, and that implies striking some sort of balance between deep ly competing standpoints that are represented, in microcosm, within each individual. C. Philosophical Responses to Theoretical Disagreement A major goal of eplstemology - in addition to the goal of dispelling skepticism and uncertainty - is that of dispelling disagreement. The theoretical ideal of agreement is the formulation of arguments that will convince others of the substantive truth of dis puted beliefs. The main problem of epistemology, as conceived by Descartes, is that the evidence for our beliefs might be nothing more than a function of our own particu lar, limited perspective: ers Peirce, How to Make Our Ideas Clear, in 1 The Essential Peirce 124,138-39 (Nathan Houser &amp; Christian Kloesel eds. 1992); Stephen Toulmin, Human Understanding: The Collective Use and Evolution of Concepts 135-44 (1972); Karl R. Popper, Objective Knowledge: An Evolutionary Ap proach (rev. ed. 1979). 18 See G.W. Leibniz, La Place d'Autrul, in Sämtliche Schriften und Briefe, Vierte Reihe, Politische Schriften, Dritter Band (1677-1689) 903-04 (Akademie der Wissenschaften der DDR, 1986) („Ev erything which we would find unjust if we were in the place of others, must seem to us to be suspect of injustice. ... [Tjhe sense of the principle is: do not do or do not refuse lightly that which you would not like to be done to you or which another would not refuse to you."); cf. Immanuel Kant, Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals (1785). 19 This possibility was suggested to me by the audience at a lecture sponsored by Prof. Dr. Ralf Dreier, University of Göttingen (Dec. 1, 1993). „Indifference" may be a synonym for the forms of transcending perspective I discuss next, in the context of political and legal theory. 20 Nagel, supra note 15, at 26, 27. 21 See id. at 36-37; Ludwig Wittgenstein, Philosophical Investigations §§ 199-363 (G.E.M.

Collier Not only can a particular experienced thing suffer devaluation as an illusion of the senses; the whole unitarily surveyable nexus, experienced throughout a period of time, can prove to be an illusion, a coherent dream.23 Descartes' methodological innovation was to subject all beliefs (including, for exam ple, the belief in the existence of the natural world) to a radical critique - the principle of „absolute indubitability" - and not to assume or accept the existence of anything that could admit of any conceivable doubt, however unwarranted or unsubstantiated. Descartes proceeds to treat all evidence for our beliefs „just as if I had discovered that it was absolutely false ... until I have met with something which is certain."24 And he makes clear that his is an affirmative doubt: I suppose, then, that all the things that I see are false; I persuade myself that nothing has ever existed of all that my fallacious memory represents to me. I consider that I pos sess no senses; I imagine that body, figure, extension, movement and place are but the fictions of my mind.25 (In a reassuring aside, Descartes notes that „I cannot at present yield too much to distrust, since I am not considering the question of action, but only of knowledge."26) As is well known, the course of Descartes' Gedankenexperiment led him to the principle cogito, ergo sum as an absolutely indubitable starting point for philosophical reflection. But the method of systematic doubt itself, rather than any particular doctri nal result, is of more interest for the problem of transcending perspectives in political theory and law. ,,[T]he demand for a philosophy aiming at the ultimate conceivable freedom from prejudice"27 resonates also in contemporary demands on the political and legal sciences as they address the increasingly unavoidable facts of pluralism and intolerance. The political striving for neutrality among disputed conceptions of the good, and the legal stance of indifference among unreasonable but lawful subjects of disagreement, answer to the same methodological needs that inspired the philosoph ical program of systematic doubt. But rather than actually doubt - however briefly or provisionally - the existence of everything that is normally assumed in the natural attitude, contractarian political theory attempts merely to abstract from our controver sial and disputed beliefs, without necessarily denying them. This procedure is akin to the method of Husserl, who sought to „put out of play" or „disengage" the potentially misleading evidence for our natural beliefs, in order to concentrate on the conscious acts and objects of believing as such.28 ,,[T]he philosophically reflective Ego's absten tion from position-takings, his depriving them of acceptance, does not signify their disappearance from his field of experience. . . . Likewise everything meant. . . (the meant judgment, theory, value, end, or whatever it is) is still retained completely - but 23 Edmund Husserl, Cartesian Meditations § 7 (Dorion Cairns trans. 1970). 24 1 The Philosophical Works of Descartes 149 (Elizabeth S.

III. The Practical Project of Transcending Perspectives Whereas theoretical reason concerns the knowledge of objects presupposed as giv en, practical reason guides the construction of appropriate objects of the will.30 The subfield of practical reasoning with which I shall be most concerned is political phi losophy, which addresses basic institutional issues of governance and the structure of society. Within the practical realm, political philosophy may be located on a contin uum between moral philosophy - which, it may be said, looks to the indefinite future - and „normal" politics, which looks only to the next election.31 In the practical political realm, the transcending of perspectives is undertaken for a reason, with a purpose, and to solve a problem: the practical problem of disagree ment, where there is an urgent need for a minimal basis of social cooperation. One of the main goals of political philosophy is to arrive at reasonable terms of social agree ment. Indeed, the practical political realm may be defined as that realm where, in the face of disagreement, we cannot always simply „agree to disagree." „We turn to po litical philosophy when our shared political understandings . . . break down,"32 and when that breakdown is intolerable. In the practical political realm, however, we can and may do whatever we like to solve our problems of social disagreement. In the relatively short term of political philosophy, whatever we agree to „works," in the sense of dispelling disagreement - it is ipso facto a solution.33 There is thus no external perspective or vantage point, no independent order of values from which our political solutions may be judged „true" or „false," nothing else „out there" to which our political judgments could fail to corre spond: What justifies a conception of justice is not its being true to an order antecedent to and given to us, but its congruence with our deeper understanding of ourselves and our aspi rations, and our realization that, given our history and the traditions embedded in our public life, it is the most reasonable doctrine for us.34 Id. at 20; cf. id. at 19-20 („[T]he world . . . goes on appearing, as it appeared before; the only difference is that I, as reflecting philosophically, no longer keep in effect (no longer accept) the natural believing in existence involved in experiencing the world-though that believing too is still there and grasped by my noticing regard."); see generally Edmund Husserl, Ideas: General Intro duction to Pure Phenomenology (W. Boyce Gibson trans. 1952). According to Kant, „[w]e can come to know pure practical laws in the same way we know pure theoretical principles, by attending to the necessity with which reason prescribes them to us and to the elimination from them of all empirical conditions, which reason directs." Immanuel Kant, Cri tique of Practical Reason 29 (Lewis White Beck trans. 1956) (1788). See John Rawls, The Idea of an Overlapping Consensus, 7 Oxford J. Legal Stud. 1, 24 (1987); on the distinction between „normal" politics and higher lawmaking, see Bruce Ackerman, 1 We the People: Foundations 230-94 (1991). John Rawls, Political Liberalism 44 (1993). In the long run, nevertheless, it may be true that „stability is best achieved and longest lasting only when the citizenry's shared beliefs are rationally, rather than irrationally, held."

Phil. 515,</page><page sequence="8">66 Charles W. Collier Where the problem of transcending perspectives is at issue, the relevant political criterion of success is thus reasonableness, as opposed to truth or objectivity.35 „[Bjeing reasonable is not an epistemological idea (though it has epistemological elements). Rather, it is part of a political ideal."36 Trying to arrive at a theoretically defensible version of truth is not only unnecessary; it may even „interfere with the practical aim of finding an agreed public basis of justification,"37 because the truth is supposed to be one, and the search for it - if insisted on - would be inherently divisive.38 Similarly, different conceptions of objectivity are appropriate in the widely diver gent spheres of theoretical and practical reasoning.39 In the political realm, the most appropriate form of objectivity is, in effect, intersubjectivity: To say that a political conviction is objective is to say that there are reasons, specified by a reasonable and mutually recognizable political conception ... sufficient to convince all reasonable persons that it is reasonable.40 Ultimately, then, the pursuit of social agreement may result in a circular or tautological notion of „reasonableness" itself. In a certain sense, „perspective enters into what is reasonable."41 I shall have more to say about that in section B.3. A. Political Constructivism The problem of intolerance arises as one descends from the rarefied heights of phi losophy to political conflict. „Philosophical intolerance" is merely a synonym for igno rance, theoretical willfulness 42 and unscientific methodology;43 political intolerance 519 (1980); cf. Rawls, supra note 32, at 119 („[W]hether such claims are in general reasonable, can only be shown by the overall success over time of the shared practice of practical reasoning by those who are reasonable and rational."); id. at 120 („[B]eing able to .. . state sufficient reasons for judgment... is already the best possible explanation of the beliefs of those who are reasonable and rational."); id. at 243 („The only comprehensive doctrines that run afoul of public reason are those that cannot support a reasonable balance of political values."). 35 See Rawls, supra note 32, at xx, 44-45, 62-63; see also id. at 111 (correct theoretical judgment as true, correct practical judgment as reasonable). Id. at 62. Id. at 153. See id. („The reason for this restraint is to respect, as best we can, the limits of public reason."). See id. at 117-18. Id. at 119; cf. id. at 120 („given a background of successful practice over time .. . considered agreement in judgment, or narrowing of differences, normally suffices for objectivity"). Thomas Nagel, Equality and Partiality 172 (1991). „[WJillful implies obstinate and perverse determination to follow one's own will despite influences, arguments, advice, etc. in opposition ...." Webster's New World Dictionary 1636 (College ed. 1966). See Nagel, supra note 41, at 98 („When a theoretical discovery contradicts the appearances we simply allow it to overrule them .... Deceptive appearances don't continue to demand our belief, unless we are superstitious. Personal desires, on the other hand, remain effective for the most part, and cannot be rendered inactive at will."); but see also Thomas S.

Kuhn, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions 79, 147 (2d ed. 1970) („[Tjhere is no such thing as research without counterinstances ... because no paradigm that provides a basis for scientific research ever completely resolves all its problems.... All historically significant theories have agreed with the facts, but only more or less.").</page><page sequence="9">A Legal Theory of Tolerance and Perspective 67 is a practical, and practically insoluble, problem.44 But where perspectives cannot be reconciled, may they not at least be „bracketed," so to speak? May they not be dis counted - for purposes of argument, regarding urgent matters of mutual concern - and abstracted from? This is the main contention of John Rawls and like-minded contractarian theorists; their project is to articulate a (generally acceptable) concep tion of social justice that does not depend on any specific, and thus divisive, notion(s) of the good life. This method amounts to transcending perspectives by abstracting from what is unique and particular about them; tolerance means transcending differ ences without necessarily resolving them.45 The „veil of ignorance" cannot, however, quite conceal what it obscures. Consider the following criticisms, from opposite ends of the political spectrum: Because recent political philosophy in the Anglo-American mode remains for the most part animated by the hopes of the Enlightenment, above all, the hope that human beings will shed their traditional allegiances and local identities and unite in a universal civiliza tion grounded in generic humanity and a rational morality, it can not even begin to grapple with the political dilemmas of an age in which political life is dominated by renascent particularisms, militant religions and resurgent ethnicities 46 Rawls' theory of justice fails because of its choice of disembodied abstraction as a mode of inquiry. [Fjeminist theory derived through consciousness raising . .. includes multiple visions of human nature. . . . Rawls' assumptions about human nature drawn from his analysis of the „original position" fail to account for the richness of human experience, particularly that of disempowered groups.47 These objections do not address the central claim that what is lost is worth the price, that the virtues of tolerance are advanced by raising rather than lowering the level of abstraction, and that bringing in „the richness of human experience" will only bring in its wake more (and more richly nuanced) differences. So of course Rawls is not trying to „account for the richness of human experience" at all; quite to the contrary, that „richness" is itself the problem. Or is a less „generic" approach (perhaps strengthening „traditional allegiances and local identities"?) to the problems of „renascent particularisms, militant religions and resurgent ethnicities" likely to succeed, where the ultimate objective is some sort of (relatively) peaceful coexist ence or at least an incremental lowering of the volume of warfare to the proverbial 44 See, e.g., Nathan Glazer &amp; Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Beyond the Melting Pot (1963); Stephen Macedo, Toleration and Fundamentalism, in A Companion to Contemporary Political Philosophy ch. 37 (Robert E. Goodin &amp; Philip Pettit eds. 1993). 45 By analogy, the difference between the corpuscular and wave theories of light has been „tran scended," in the sense that neither view turned out to be quite right. But the debate over the exist ence vet non of microorganisms was definitively „resolved" - with the help of the microscope - in favor of one side. Most cases in which tolerance is at issue cannot be resolved that easily or that definitively. 46 John Gray, Against the New Liberalism, Times Literary Supp., July 3, 1992, at 13; cf. John Gray, Why the Owl Flies Late, Times Literary Supp., Oct. 15, 1993, at 11 („[T]he liberal ideals of the European Enlightenment project... of subjecting all human institutions to a rational criticism and of convergence on a universal civilization whose foundation is autonomous human reason ... are taken as unproblematic, even axiomatic, in virtually all recent Anglo-American political philoso phy."). 47 Richard Delgado &amp; Jean Stefancic, Critical Race Theory: An Annotated Bibliography, 79 Va.

Collier „dull roar"?48 These considerations have - in a climate of newly lowered expectations for consensus49 - increasingly driven political theorists to ask, not how specific, divi sive, and intractable issues of public policy should be decided or conflicting private duties resolved, but how the basic institutions in a just society should be structured. Some sort of general agreement on the latter ought to be possible; as for the former sorts of issues, disagreement is, at worst, tolerable. Often, the problem of transcending perspectives in the political arena is approached by addressing only „rationality," in the sense of instrumental fittedness to self- (and perhaps group) interests.50 But a more complete conception would also include the attempt of political reasoning to attain „reasonable" terms of social agreement. The most interesting and influential such conception is Rawls' theory of the „original posi tion" and the „veil of ignorance," which add the constraints of reasonableness to the process of rationally autonomous deliberation.51 For, whatever else it represents, the „original position" is essentially a means of transcending perspectives: [W]e must find some point of view, removed from and not distorted by the particular fea tures and circumstances of the all-encompassing background framework, from which a fair agreement between persons regarded as free and equal can be reached.52 Rawls' original position is a radical thought-experiment in the practical realm that is fully comparable to the programs of Descartes and Husserl in the theoretical realm. Thus, in lieu of abstracting from our belief in the existence of the natural world, Rawls seeks to disengage what might be termed our system of social and political beliefs - at least in the sense of removing the knowledge that it is „ours." He accomplishes this by stipulating that the parties in the original position remain behind a „veil of igno rance," such that they do not know anything specific about themselves - their own personal or psychological propensities, their natural assets and abilities, their position in society, or even their conception of the good - as they debate the terms of an ideal polity.53 They are „in temporary ignorance of [their] race and class, religion and gen der, aims and attachments."54 As Rawls explains, „[t]he arbitrariness of the world must be corrected for. . . while at the same time any knowledge that is likely to give 48 Gray himself notes elsewhere that the „conviction that cultural difference would, or a least could, cease to be a source of divisive social conflict as the species converged on a universal civilization . . . looks increasingly Utopian toward the end of the 20th century."

In what follows, the terms „rational" and „reasonable" are systematically distinguished, in accordance with Rawls' usage. Rationality refers to the instrumental fittedness of means to ends and the faculty of autonomous deliberation in the service of self- and group interests, narrowly defined. Reasonableness refers primarily to constraints or restraints on what might otherwise amount to enforced agreement or the imposition of one's views on others. Reasonableness in this sense is virtually a term of art, suggest ing agreeableness or tolerance more than reason. 52 John Rawls, Political Liberalism 23 (1993) (hereinafter Rawls, Political Liberalism). 53 The full elaboration of the veil of ignorance involves „a series of points of view from which the different problems of justice are to be settled, each point of view inheriting the constraints adopted at the preceding stages."

Rev. 1765, 1772 (1994).</page><page sequence="11">A Legal Theory of Tolerance and Perspective 69 rise to bias and distortion and to set men against one another is ruled out."55 In this way, one's whole system of socio-political „beliefs" is imaginatively disengaged - at least in the sense of abstracting from whose beliefs they are - to provide a radically neutral basis for „an order of cognition, proceeding from intrinsically earlier to intrinsi cally later cognitions."56 In short, „the original position procedure tests conceptions of justice by forcing the deliberator who uses it to consider what society would be like for him if he were anyone in that society."57 The theory of the original position allows for the interplay of two basic but contrast ing moral powers. The parties are assumed to deliberate with only their rational self (and perhaps group) interests in mind, but they are constrained by conditions of rea sonableness such that their own interests can be conceived only very abstractly.58 In this way „the reasonable frames and subordinates the rational" by imposing „condi tions that appropriately limit what they can put toward as good reasons."59 The „original position" may thus be conceived as an application of procedural jus tice to the problem of social disagreement.60 The parties to its debate over political justice „do not know how the various alternatives will affect their own particular case and they are obliged to evaluate principles solely on the basis of general considera tions."61 „Political constructivism" may likewise be understood as a methodology of tolerance with respect to results or outcomes: The intuitionist regards a procedure as correct because following it correctly usually gives the correct independently given judgment, whereas the political constructivist regards a judgment as correct because it issues from the reasonable and rational procedure of con struction when correctly formulated and correctly followed.62 The enduring significance of political constructivism (applying the veil of ignorance in the original position) is that it „models" or „represents" the workings of practical polit ical reason under specified assumptions about „the appropriate conceptions of socie ty and person."63 It is primarily those assumptions I wish to reexamine, not the meth ods of constructivism as such. As Rawls himself acknowledges, „not everything ... is constructed; we must have some material, as it were, from which to begin," and among those significant starting points are „the basic conceptions of society and person."64 Rawls' position is narrow in scope but ambitious in aim: it „aims to be the focus of an overlapping consensus," „hopes to articulate a public basis of justification," and „seeks common ground - or if one prefers, neutral ground - given the fact of plural Rawls, A Theory of Justice, at 141, 200.

Collier ism."65 Part of the problem Is that very ambitiousness itself, which leads Rawls to idealize the „well-ordered" society as one „in which everyone accepts, and knows that everyone else accepts and publicly endorses, the very same principles of justice."66 In opting for a conception of tolerance that requires far less in the way of agreement, I shall, paradoxically, seek to cover wider ground. The other part of the problem is the narrowness of the perspective within which Rawls pursues his aims: „to connect a particular understanding of freedom and equality with a particular conception of the person" under „the reasonably favorable conditions that make a constitutional democ racy possible."67 As I shall argue in more detail below, this narrowness of focus makes Rawls' aims incapable of realization under anything like the reasonably foreseeable circumstances of the contemporary world in which they would be pursued. B. Neutrality as a Response to Practical Disagreement The real problem with the constructivist political project of transcending perspectives is not that it goes too far (in abstracting from, for example, „the richness of human experience"), but that it does not go far enough in addressing the irreducible incom mensurability of viewpoints. As a practical matter, [wjhen two parties disagree, they can adopt a neutral stance by setting aside, for the time being, the opinions in dispute and continuing to converse on the basis of the rest of their beliefs. The sensible strategy for achieving neutrality is not to assume that the conflicting views will themselves share some common denominator.... Instead, the strategy is to abstract from what is in dispute.68 Abstraction is an integral part of „the retreat to neutral ground," which in turn is dictat ed by the overall political goal of arriving at reasonable terms of agreement. 1. Abstraction „[Tjhinking," remarks Hegel (in a parenthetical aside), „is always the negation of what we have immediately before us."69 To abstract is to ignore; it is to disregard the most obvious aspects of that which is presented to us and consider only its general, univer sal, intelligible - in short, non-perspectival - features.70 In Hegel's example, to see in a murderer nothing except the abstract fact that he is a murderer is to ignore the fact that he might also be strong, interesting, handsome, etc.71 For the work of abstraction that is „set in motion by deep political conflicts," certain features are singled out as 65 Id. at 192. 66 Id. at 201. 67 Id. at 369, 155. 68 Charles E.

Hegel, Who Thinks Abstractly?, in Hegel: Texts and Commentary 116-17 (Walter Kaufmann ed. 1966) („The populace finds this remark terrible: What? A murderer handsome?

An actual, historical agreement is too heavily influenced and determined by the natural contingencies and social accidents of the status quo, by the personal concerns and private interests of the contracting individuals, to tend toward or preserve justice.75 „We cannot by actual agreements get beyond happenstance or specify a suitably independent standard."76 Abstraction „suitably evens out the contingencies."77 Abstracting from possible sources of disagreement is a way of observing neutral ity with respect to those possibilities. The discussion of abstraction thus leads directly to the issue of tolerance, e.g., among competing comprehensive doctrines.78 We may abstract from - and thus remain (politically) neutral or tolerant with respect to - com peting religious, philosophical, and moral doctrines. 2. Neutrality It will be useful to distinguish different levels or forms of „tolerance as neutrality" with respect to the following sources of disagreement: 1. Tolerance as neutrality among competing „appetites," desires, motives, and immediate interests, narrowly defined. 2. Tolerance as neutrality among competing determinate conceptions of the good. 3. Tolerance as neutrality among competing theories of the good, i.e. (reasona ble) comprehensive religious, philosophical, and moral doctrines, each with its own associated conception of the good. 4. Tolerance as neutrality among competing unreasonable comprehensive doc trines. 1. Tolerance as neutrality among competing „appetites," desires, motives, and immediate interests, narrowly defined: These are presumably all neutralized as a matter of course in the original position.79 In a similar vein, Mill remarks on what might be termed the lack of „intellectual" perspective - i.e., the unexamined assumption that one's own „feelings," „preferences," or „likings" (as opposed to reasons) are not sim 72 See Rawls, Political Liberalism, at 44, 154-55 n.20. 73 See id. at 157. 74 Rawls, A Theory of Justice, at viii; cf. id. at 11; see also Rawls, Political Liberalism, at xv. 75 See Rawls, Political Liberalism, at 285-87. 76 Id. at 272. 77 Id. at 272. 78 See id. at 241-43 &amp; n.31. 79 See id. at 82-84; cf.

Collier ply perspectival but form perfectly satisfactory bases for general standards of con duct.80 2. Tolerance as neutrality among competing determinate conceptions of the good: This condition is satisfied by the veil of ignorance in the original position (as described in A Theory of Justice).81 „[T]he parties do not know the content of these determinate conceptions ... [b]ut... they must try to adopt principles of justice that... advance some determinate (but unspecified) conceptions of the good over a complete life."82 3. Tolerance as neutrality among competing theories of the good, i.e. (reasona ble) comprehensive religious, philosophical, and moral doctrines, each with its own associated conception of the good: This condition is arguably also satisfied by the veil of ignorance in the original position, broadly interpreted (as in Political Liberalism).63 „[Pjolitical liberalism applies the principle of toleration to philosophy itself,"84 whereas the dominant philosophical and political traditions do not allow for a plurality of rea sonable though opposing comprehensive doctrines, each with its own conception of the good.85 This is a genuine advance by Rawls: [l]t is vital to the idea of political liberalism that we may with perfect consistency hold that it would be unreasonable to use political power to enforce our own comprehensive view, which we must, of course, affirm as either reasonable or true.86 We may reasonably argue for public political values without necessarily deducing them from our own comprehensive doctrine(s). For the limited purposes of tolerant discussion, we „disengage" that sort of deductive support, while retaining it for other purposes. Thus, we do not „pluck out" our religious convictions, as Kent Greenawalt suggests,87 in the sense of negating or denying them; that objection suggests a mis application of abstraction. The parties in the original position simply reason „as if they know very little about themselves . . . and in abstraction from contingencies," which have been „left out of account"88 but not negated or denied 89 However (and here I follow Greenawalt), we do „disregard" our personal, private contingencies - at least temporarily - and „start from scratch" in that sense.90 Like wise judges, in their official capacity as legal decisionmakers („exemplars" of public reason, says Rawls91), are expected to view their own personal morality, and even „the ideals and virtues of morality generally," as irrelevant.92 80 See J.S. Mill, On Liberty 27, 28, 37-38 (John Gray &amp; G.W. Smith eds. 1991) (1859). 81 See Rawls, Political Liberalism, at 74-75, 305-06, 310, 315, 324 (good summary), 370; cf. id. at 19-20, 81 (a determinate conception of the good is „interpreted in the light of a (reasonable) com prehensive view"), 310 („understood ... by reference to"), 311 (comprehensive views „give rise" to conceptions of the good). 82 Id. at 74. 83 See id. at, e.g., 59-61,311. 84 Id. at 10; cf. id. at 154. 85 See id. at 134-35. 86 Id. at 138. 87 See Kent Greenawalt, Religious Convictions and Political Choice 155 (1988). 88 Rawls, Political Liberalism, at 272-73 (emphasis added). 89 See section II.C. supra („Philosophical Responses to Theoretical Disagreement"); Larmore, supra note 68, at 53 („[Abstracting from a controversial belief does not imply that one believes it any less, that one has had reason to become skeptical toward it.

But Rawls does not advance to the next logical level: Tolerance as neutrality among competing unreasonable comprehensive doctrines. There clearly are some doctrines that on anyone's definition are „unreasonable."93 Should toleration extend to these? When all parties to a disagreement are „reasonable" in their disagreement (e.g., by not insisting that others share their views or die), there are good grounds to hope that the matter may be rationally „resolved" - not necessarily in the strong sense of actual agreement on the substantive matter in dispute, but at least in the weaker sense of an affirmative agreement to place the disputed matter beyond the calculus of social interests and majoritarian political control.94 But when parties to a disagreement insist „unreasonably" on their disputed and controversial views (e.g., by insisting that the state require conformity to them), the most that may be hoped is that agreement (or reasonable disagreement) on other matters can be reached and that agreement (or reasonable disagreement) in those other areas will tend to make the remaining areas of unreasonable disagreement less intolerable. Fanatics typically do not agree to take their disputed and controversial beliefs off the agenda of „normal" politics: to that extent they are „unreasonable." But even those who are unreasonable in one respect may be induced to behave reason ably in other, related respects. Thus, three levels of handling social disagreement may be distinguished: the the oretical ideal of arguments that will actually convince others of the substantive truth of disputed beliefs; the political project of affirmatively placing some areas of disagree ment beyond majoritarian control; and the legal goal of finding other, less disputed areas in which agreement (or reasonable disagreement) tends to mitigate the disad vantages of any remaining unreasonable disagreement. Tolerance in the political sense is concerned with reasonable disagreement; tolerance in the legal sense is concerned with unreasonable disagreement. This analysis merely draws a conclusion that seems to be lurking in Charles Lar more's admirable discussion of the practical norms of rational dialogue. He writes: When two people disagree about some specific point, but wish to continue talking about the more general problem they wish to solve, each should prescind from the beliefs that the other rejects, (1) in order to construct an argument on the basis of his other beliefs that will convince the other of the truth of the disputed belief, or (2) in order to shift to another aspect of the problem, where the possibilities of agreement seem greater. In the face of disagreement, those who wish to continue the conversation should retreat to neutral ground, with the hope either of resolving the dispute or of bypassing it.95 It seems clear that „bypassing" disputes or „shifting] to another aspect of the prob lem, where the possibilities of agreement seem greater," corresponds to what I have analyzed as the legal goal of transcending (without necessarily resolving) unreason able disagreements. But when Larmore states that „[a] liberal political system need Cf. Rawls, Political Liberalism, at 138-39 (example of an „unreasonable" comprehensive doctrine). Is there a bias against comprehensive views that include the idea, or requirement, of their being politically „enforced" or that state power be used „to gain everyone's allegiance to it" (e.g., militant Islam and fundamentalist Christian crusades vs. Zen Buddhism and solipsism)?

Collier not feel obliged to reason with fanatics; it must simply take the necessary precautions to guard against them,"96 he seems not to draw the conclusion implied in his position: There is indeed a unique way of reasoning with the unreasonable, and there are important legal goals to be attained by pursuing it. I return to these issues in Part IV. 3. Reasonableness As noted earlier, political constructivism „models" or „represents" the workings of prac tical reason under specified assumptions about persons and society.97 A key require ment informing the contractualist ideal is that agreement be secured only by „princi ples that no one could reasonably reject."98 This is essentially what I have referred to above as the theoretical ideal of agreement.99 Rawls, for example, views this strong sense of agreement as connected with the demand for legitimacy: [Jjustice as fairness is not reasonable in the first place unless in a suitable way it can win its support by addressing each citizen's reason.... Only so is it an account of the legiti macy of political authority as opposed to an account of how those who hold political power can satisfy themselves, and not citizens generally, that they are acting properly.100 Elsewhere, this theoretical ideal of agreement is even compared to the reasonable agreement that has been attained in the natural sciences.101 The resulting conception of reasonableness is impossibly narrow and restrictive. „[Reasonable persons," writes Rawls, „have an enduring desire to honor fair terms of cooperation and to be fully cooperating members of society."102 This conception of the person takes the capacity for social cooperation as fundamental and attributes to persons the two moral powers which make such cooperation possible.... Thus citizens are regarded as having a certain natural political virtue without which the hopes for a regime of liberty may be unrealistic.103 Rawls' heavily idealized citizen sounds somewhat like a cross between a Kantian puritan and an English gentleman,104 who exhibits „the virtue of reasonableness and a sense of fairness, a spirit of compromise and a readiness to meet others halfway, all of which are connected with the willingness to cooperate with others on political terms that everyone can publicly accept."105 If anything is „unrealistic," it is this picture of 96 Id. at 60; cf. id. at 66. 97 See Rawls, Political Liberalism, at 90, 95, 96. 98 Id. at 123 n.30; cf.

Consider the following list of eight „basic elements of the conceptions of citizens as reasonable and rational," some with multiple sub-compo nents: 1. The capacity for a sense of justice and for a conception of the good; 2. The intellectual powers of judgment, thought, and inference; 3. A determinate conception of the good interpreted in the light of a (reasonable) comprehensive view; 4. The requisite capacities and abilities to be normal and cooperating members of society over a complete life; 5. A readiness to propose fair terms of cooperation it is reasonable to expect others to endorse, and a willingness to abide by these terms provided others can be relied on to do likewise; 6. A recognition of the burdens of judgment as limiting what can be justified to others, and the affirmation only of reasonable comprehensive doctrines; 7. Above and beyond being normal and fully cooperating members of society, the further desire to be, and to be recognized as, such members; 8. A „reasonable moral psychology."106 According to Rawls, the ideal of „public reason" makes it unreasonable even to vote on fundamental political questions on the basis of private or personal considera tions that not everyone could reasonably be expected to endorse.107 (So much for the rationale of the secret ballot.) On these premises, he demonstrates that no one could reasonably vote against the Roe v. Wade doctrine.108 Rawls also suggests as a test of reasonableness: ,,[H]ow would our argument strike us presented in the form of a supreme court opinion?"109 An imposing test indeed! If that were really the test of public reason, then much if not most of the world's political debate would simply be „out of order." For Rawls, the paradigmatically unreasonable person is one who would reject „one or more democratic freedoms" and whose arguments would strike us as „outra geous" if presented in the form of a supreme court opinion.110 Such people we should treat as we would treat „war and disease."111 (Elsewhere Rawls says that they „ap proach being psychopathic."112) I think we can do better than that.

By contrast, the leading diagnostic manual for the mental health sciences cautions: A clinician who is unfamiliar with the nuances of an individual's cultural frame of reference may incorrectly judge as psychopathology those normal variations in behavior, belief, or experience that are particular to the individual's culture. For example, certain religious practices or beliefs (e.g., hearing or seeing a deceased relative during bereavement) may be misdiagnosed as manifesta tions of a Psychotic Disorder. Applying Personality Disorder criteria across cultural settings may be especially difficult because of the wide cultural variation in concepts of self, styles of communica tion, and coping mechanisms. American Psychiatric Association, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders xxiv (4th ed. 1994); cf. id. at 298-99 („An individual's cultural and religious background must be taken into account in evaluating the possible presence of Delusional Disorder. Some cultures have widely held and culturally sanctioned beliefs that might be considered delusional in other cultures."). The manual goes on to describe some 25 other „culture-bound syndromes," id. at 843-49. For example, in Ethiopia, Somalia, Egypt, Sudan, Iran, and other North African and Middle Eastern societies, „the</page><page sequence="18">76 Charles W. Collier agreement is what raises the specter of oppressive (state) power, not disagreement as such.113 But Rawls' gloss on this truth takes away with one hand what it grants with the other: „There is no reason why any citizen, or association of citizens, should have the right to use state power to decide constitutional essentials as that person's, or that association's, comprehensive doctrine directs ... and reasonable comprehen sive doctrines recognize f/?/s."114 Consider the following definition: Reasonable: does not offend against the principles of practical reasoning that make agreement possible. For example, not insisting that the state enforce my religious views would be „reason able" in this sense. If this definition seems circular or tautological (since „reasoning" is used in the definition of „reasonable"), consider the following equivalent reformula tion: Reasonable: does not offend against the principles that make it possible for agree able people to agree. And this is really Rawls' sense. His project is to explain the possibility of agreement (or reasonable disagreement) among „reasonable citizens who affirm reasonable com prehensive doctrines."115 This means that there are reasons, specified by a reasonable and mutually recognizable political concep tion ... sufficient to convince all reasonable persons that it is reasonable,116 In short, Rawls casts an impossibly narrow net as to what is included in „reasona bleness" (i.e., he requires too much of it), but those conceptions once admitted are then accorded great and generous toleration, e.g. as to the prospect of reasonable disagreement.117 Reasonableness in this sense is one of „the cooperative virtues of political life."118 And „reasonable," as the term is used by Rawls and like-minded contractarian political theorists, already includes connotations of „agreeable" (or „agree ment-prone"). Ultimately, then, this use of reasonableness obliterates the distinction between agreement and disagreement. „Reasonable disagreement" already includes such substantial agreement on fundamentals that it does not differ appreciably from what would ordinarily be termed, simply, agreement. And reasonableness has become in distinguishable from what would ordinarily be termed, simply, tolerance. Given that understanding of reasonableness, disagreement among the reasonable does not amount to much. Either a less circular notion of reasonableness, or an analysis of disagreement among the unreasonable, seems therefore to be called for. experience of spirits possessing an individual" may lead to dissociative episodes that include shouting, laughing, hitting the head against a wall, singing, or weeping.

The Legal Project of Transcending Perspectives In what follows I shall argue for a minimal, strictly „legal" concept of tolerance, one that limits itself to policing the outer boundaries of procedural fairness and does not even assume agreement on the basic institutions of government or the structure of society. Some such minimal notion of tolerance is practically a necessity if the prob lems of legitimacy, acceptability, and the „search for an unforced solution" are taken at all seriously. A supremely objective, impartially conceived ideal of tolerance is use less if it does not and cannot command the personal assent of those individuals who would be governed by it. ,,[W]e are looking for principles to deal with conflict that can at some level be endorsed by everyone," notes Nagel, „principles that will both moti vate and command respect and that will therefore give authority to results which are reached in accordance with them, even if those results do not in themselves com mand unanimous support."119 Obviously, everything turns on the phrase „at some level" and, as I have suggested, that level may be very low (and thus very abstract) indeed. But enforced tolerance of minimally acceptable procedural principles may ultimately be more vital than even liberalism and democracy, as these are conven tionally conceived; or, rather, it may (since it does not promise much) be possible where they are not. In my attempt at a more satisfactory position I shall emphasize four elements: A. Our conception of tolerance should be a negative one that repudiates the great evils instead of trying to secure affirmative agreement on „primary goods."120 The great evils are few and almost universally condemned; the goods are many and di verse and disputed.121 B. Such a conception will be limited largely to neutral notions of procedural justice, not divisive conceptions of substantial justice. The legal requirements of tolerance should extend only to enforced agreement on minimal procedural principles that can then be broadly applied and accepted. The strength of the legal principle is a function of its minimalism. C. Legal tolerance is also a function of our rationality, broadly defined, as opposed to „reasonableness" in the contractarian sense discussed and criticized above. There are rational interests in toleration. D. The legal basis of social agreement lies somewhere between a deeply shared moral commitment, on the one hand, and a mere „modus vivendi" on the other. The necessary „low-level" consensus is broad but shallow. 119 Nagel, supra note 41, at 23-24; cf. id. at 145 („The only unanimity that makes sense must be based on a combination of such impartial and perfectionist values as It is reasonable to expect everyone to share, together with respect for those large differences in value and conception of life that inev itably remain."). 120 See, e.g., Rawls, Political Liberalism, at 76, 180-81. 121 This point is reminiscent of Ronald Cass, The Perils of Positive Thinking: Constitutional Interpreta tion and Negative First Amendment Theory, 34 UCLA L. Rev. 1405 (1987), except that where Cass wants to avoid philosophy altogether, I adopt a philosophy that is itself „negative." But it does show that there is an historical basis for this approach.

Legal Tolerance Rawls' concept of tolerance clearly falls short of the claims that a legal concept makes on us; he does not or cannot argue that his ideal of „public reason," for example, could be legally enforced: That public reason should be... understood and honored by citizens is not, of course, a matter of law. As an ideal conception of citizenship for a constitutional democratic re gime, it presents how things might be, taking people as a just and well-ordered society would encourage them to be.122 I think one can go beyond this sort of wishful thinking and vaguely hopeful imagining. I think it is possible to develop a notion of tolerance that makes stronger (because more minimal) claims, has more general applicability (covering a narrower range of issues), and thus merits legal enforcement. The legal problem of tolerance is narrower than the (largely political) problems of social justice. It concerns the minimal acceptable rules and boundaries of social inter action, not the substance or content of even a neutrally (and in that sense „tolerantly") agreed-upon regime of distributive justice. The rule of law, due process, and the first amendment circumscribe much narrower and more minimal considerations of toler ance than, for example, the claim that „individuals have a right to equal concern and respect in the design and administration of the political institutions that govern them."123 Legal tolerance does not even connote „mutual recognition,"124 much less „accept ance,"125 and these limitations may explain some of its (limited) success in a largely intolerant world.126 It is no accident that most legal and constitutional mandates are framed as prohibitions,127 since it is much easier to insist simply that „Thou shalt 122 Rawls, Political Liberalism, at 213; cf. id. at 253 („I stress that the limits of public reason are not, clearly, the limits of law or statute but the limits we honor when we honor an ideal: the ideal of democratic citizens trying to conduct their political affairs on terms supported by public values that we might reasonably expect others to endorse."). 123 Ronald Dworkin, Taking Rights Seriously 180 (1980); cf. Parekh, supra note 47, at 13 („The liberal is in theory committed to equal respect for persons. Since human beings are culturally embedded, respect for them entails respect for their cultures and ways of life."); Rawls, Political Liberalism, at 157, 158, 303 (mutual respect means „without resentment"), 319 („By publicly affirming the basic liberties citizens in a well-ordered society express their mutual respect for one another as reason able and trustworthy, as well as their recognition of the worth all citizens attach to their way of life."), 337-38, 369 (toleration based on „mutual respect"); Larmore, supra note 68, at 59-66. 124See, e.g., Guyora Binder, Mastery, Slavery, and Emancipation, 10 CardozoL. Rev. 1435,1440-41 (1989) („The desire for recognition fundamental to individual identity requires us to affect and be affected by the desires of others. Hence, it is inconsistent with the mutual tolerance of and indiffer ence toward the preferences of others that circumscribes the civic obligations of the citizen of any liberal society."). 125 See, e.g., Margaret O'Brien Steinfels, Letter to the Editor, N.Y. Times Book Rev., Jan. 16,1994, at 35 („No nation is one big happy family, least of all our own.

The entrance ticket is tolerance, not approval."); but see also Bruce Bawer, A Place at the Table (1993) (arguing for acceptance, as opposed to mere toleration, of homosexuality). 126 See, e.g., Nagel, supra note 41, at 88-89 („The institutions through which . . . constitutionally basic equalities are guaranteed owe much of their strength to the fact that their aims are limited."). 127 See, e.g., U.S. Const, amend.

Tolerance in the legal sense suggests only „a thin, procedural concept of justice,"128 one that is familiar in discussions of process-based constitutionalism.129 So long as the institutions to implement and regulate social and corrective justice meet basic but minimal standards of procedural fairness, legal and constitutional re quirements have been met. This is perhaps the ultimate stage of „indifference" to differences in perspective. This somewhat abstract discussion may be illustrated with examples drawn from two very different arenas for the regulation of disagreement in which quasi-legal solu tions have been put forward. The first example is drawn from etiquette, on the topic of „Advance Preparation for Conversation." And yet, a paradox: If you care too intensely about a subject, it is dangerous to allow yourself to say anything. That is, if you can only lecture about your fixed point of view, then you should never mention it except as a platform speaker. But if, on the other hand, you are able to listen with an open mind, the chances are that you need put no barriers what ever on any subject. At the present moment Mrs. Oldname and Mrs. Kindhart, really the most devoted of neighbors, are so violently opposed to each other on a certain political question of today that their neighbors have made a rule to which both have amiably agreed: the first person who mentions the forbidden topic must pay a fine.130 Though etiquette, like law, is a system of rule-governed behavior, the level of agree ment that can be assumed there is naturally much higher.131 My second example is therefore drawn from the other extreme, from The Law of Land Warfare, where com batants share so little in the way of common understanding that they have taken up deadly weapons for the purpose of killing each other. Yet, even here, the outer bound aries of disagreement can be discerned, and with them a rudimentary basis for the procedural regulation of combat: Absolute good faith with the enemy must be observed as a rule of conduct; but... a belligerent may resort to those measures for mystifying or misleading the enemy against which the enemy ought to take measures to protect himself.... Treacherous or perfidious conduct in war is forbidden because it destroys the basis for a restoration of peace short of the complete annihilation of one belligerent by the oth er.132 This common interest provides a basis for submitting some aspects of even warfare to „legal" treatment. For example, feigning surrender by flying a flag of truce in order to secure an advantage is strictly prohibited, but „it is a perfectly proper ruse to sum mon a force to surrender on the ground that it is surrounded and thereby induce such surrender with a small force."133 The paradox is only apparent, and it illustrates the 128 Hampshire, supra note 79, at 137. 129 See, e.g., John Hart Ely, Democracy and Distrust (1980); MarkTushnet, Darkness on the Edge of Town: The Contributions of John Hart Ely to Constitutional Theory, 89 Yale L.J. 1037 (1980); Lau rence H.

Collier extraordinary rarity of situations in which there is absolutely no basis for any sort of agreement or for any procedures governing the orderly regulation of disagreement. B. Procedural Justice The legal discussion of procedural justice can be traced back to the Carotene Prod ucts case of 1938, in which the Supreme Court pondered „whether legislation which restricts those political processes which can ordinarily be expected to bring about repeal of undesirable legislation, is to be subjected to more exacting judicial scrutiny," „whether similar considerations enter into the review of statutes directed at particular religious ... or national... or racial minorities," and „whether prejudice against dis crete and insular minorities may be a special condition, which tends seriously to cur tail the operation of those political processes ordinarily to be relied upon to protect minorities."134 Here, what might be termed the structure of politics is tentatively taken off the agenda of „normal" politics and placed beyond the calculations and vicissi tudes of interest-group bargaining - in the name of preserving, regulating, and setting outer limits on pluralist political bargaining, perhaps, but not as part ofthat process.135 Some of the basic political and legal „process rights" thus entrenched include the right to vote, freedom of political expression and association, and content- and viewpoint neutral administrative procedures and adjudicative safeguards - all of which reflect „neutral values . . . such as impartiality, consistency in application of general princi ples to all reasonably related cases . . . and equal opportunity for the contending parties to present their claims."136 These neutral process values potentially inform the entire range of tolerance-re lated problems: entrenching rules for moderating political rivalry; negotiating, arbitrat ing, and adjudicating competing claims; and establishing a framework for free rational dialogue and intellectual inquiry. Given the facts of both reasonable and unreasona ble pluralism, the „adversary principle" of argument is central to the public and politi cal versions of practical reasoning.137 „Audi alteram partem" („Hear the other side") is thus a fundamental principle of practical reasoning under conditions of inevitable con flict and disagreement. Extending this argument, Stuart Hampshire even maintains that in public practical reasoning „the disposition to follow a procedure which is an instance of the adversary principle, that is, the principle of both sides of a case being presented and heard," is synonymous with rationality itself.138 This view is based on a critique of the doctrine, common to Plato, Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas, and others, that the „parts of the soul" naturally form a personal and social hierarchy in which reason alone not only rules but sets the rules.139 Just as for Plato a person's soul has three parts, governed by rea those mentioned in the preceding sentence who are descending by parachute from disabled air craft may not be fired upon. 134 United States v.

But thoughtful human activity also includes memory, imagination, desires, emotions, hab its of feeling, and linguistic capabilities - as well as their incarnations in language, literature, history, religion, morality, custom, culture, ritual, and the arts.142 These activities, equally central to human identity, „we expect to vary vastly in form and content in different places, in different social groups, at different times in history, and in distinguishable cultures. We not only expect the diversity, we positively demand it."143 In the face of this inevitable conflict and disagreement, moral enemies are driven finally to come together from their separate corners to build political and legal institutions temporarily acceptable to all of them as arenas for fair nego tiation, because they know that the substance of political and social morality can never in principle be melted down into a few self-evident principles. Diversity of moral conviction is as natural to humanity as is the habit of hearing evidence and argument from two or more sides before settling a conflict.144 C. Rational Interests in Toleration How can this recognition of diversity at the heart of „reason" itself be reconciled with the urgent need for a minimal basis of social agreement? Given the weakness and circularity of contractarian „reasonableness," a more promising approach would di rectly address the long term, considered, and enlightened self- and group interests in tolerance - i.e. its rationality. There is a rational interest in tolerance, and it can be defended on the basis of procedural neutrality. One need not appeal to „reasonableness" (i.e., the characteris tic of being agreeable or agreement-prone), other imagined „natural virtues," or the sense of fair play culturally ingrained in the English gentleman, in order to make the case for tolerance. Such an argument can be formulated purely on the basis of ration al self- and group interests in procedural neutrality.145 First, it is only rational to insulate liberty of conscience from majoritarian political control, in order to guard against the possibility that one's own religious, philosophi cal, or moral convictions might turn out to be in the minority and suffer accordingly. Those who gamble that their views will probably remain dominant show that they did not take their convictions seriously „and, in effect, did not know what a religious, phil osophical, or moral conviction was."146 A truly serious comprehensive doctrine is in 140 See generally Plato, The Republic. 141 Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics 1169a2. 142 See Hampshire, supra note 79, at 30-48. 143 Hampshire, supra note 137, at 23. 144 Id. at 26; cf. Rawls, Political Liberalism, at 71 (outlining the „narrow role" of a political conception of justice); id. at 146 &amp; n.13. 145 Indeed, Rawls' own theory provides the elements of such an argument; see Rawls, Political Liber alism, at 310-15. 146 Id. at 311.</page><page sequence="24">82 Charles W. Collier this sense „non-negotiable" and will not be given up in exchange for other social goods.147 Second, it is only rational to reserve the option of revising our conceptions of the good. But for that option to make sense, it is necessary to allow for the possibility that our conceptions might at least theoretically be made more rational or brought into closer conformity with rationality, which implies the possibility of mistakes and the need for interpretive freedoms to recognize them as such.148 If it were, in principle, impossible to imagine any reason for ever revising our present determinate concep tions of the good, then there would be no place for the notion of a „mistake" or for intellectual freedom (since we could not possibly be wrong and would therefore never need to change our minds). In other words, it is only rational to reserve the right to think for ourselves. Similarly, it is only rational to strive to understand „why our beliefs are true, our actions right, and our ends good and suitable for us."149 If it were, in principle, impos sible to imagine any alternatives to our views, then we could not really understand or rationally justify to ourselves our own beliefs, actions, and ends. One cannot truly understand one's own views without understanding what they are opposed to, what alternatives they exclude, and why (in some specificity and detail) those alternatives are inferior.150 For that, one must allow for at least the theoretical possibility of „falling into error" and for the intellectual freedom (and, indirectly, freedom of expression and association) to recognize it as such. Today, restraints on freedom of expression and opinion are usually viewed in the context of restrictions that have been governmentally imposed or judicially upheld in the name of public safety or welfare. But historically this discussion has ranged much wider, encompassing such fields as religion, science, philosophy, and politics. Be neath the scattered notions of „political," „legal," „religious," and „cultural" tolerance there subsists an underlying general notion of what might be termed „intellectual" tolerance. In this sense, tolerance and freedom of expression are already structurally implied and assumed in the notion of intellectual methodology, in what it means to be „rational" or scientific, and indeed in reason itself. The whole modern concept of rea son, developed since the Renaissance, is itself fundamentally tolerance-based.151 One does not „decide" - and historically it has not been so decided - that tolerance is only reasonable and that therefore freedom of expression should be protected and promoted. Rather, the process works the other way around: Only on the basis of tolerance and free expression is truly reasoned argumentation even possible. One should say, not that it is reasonable to be tolerant, but that it is (so to speak) tolerant to be reasonable. 147 See id. at 311-12. 148 See id. at 313; cf. J.L. Austin, How To Do Things with Words 12 (1962) („If we never made mistakes how should we correct them?"). 149 Rawls, Political Liberalism, at 313. 150 See John Stuart Mill, On Liberty ch. 2 (1859); cf. Immanuel Kant, Critique of Pure Reason, at A 575 (1781) („Those born blind cannot have the least notion of darkness, since they have none of light. The savage knows nothing of poverty, since he has no acquaintance with wealth. The ignorant have no concept of their ignorance, because they have none of knowledge, etc."). 151 See, e.g., John Milton, Areopagitica (1644); John Locke, A Letter Concerning Toleration (1689); John Stuart Mill, On Liberty (1859).</page><page sequence="25">A Legal Theory of Tolerance and Perspective 83 D. Low-Level Consensus on Legal Tolerance In a seminal and revealing example, highly relevant to contemporary concerns, Rawls considers the fundamental disagreements between Catholics and Protestants at the time of the Reformation: At that time there was not an overlapping consensus on the principle of toleration. Both faiths held that it was the duty of the ruler to uphold the true religion and to repress the spread of heresy and false doctrine. In such a case the acceptance of the principle of toleration would ... be a mere modus vivendi, because if either faith becomes dominant, the principle of toleration would no longer be followed.152 In such a case, toleration would be „merely" an unstable modus vivendi instead of the deep agreement on principles of justice that Rawls desires.153 But what is prefer able, failing that sort of overlapping consensus (1st choice): outright warfare (3rd choice), or toleration as a mere modus vivendi (2nd choice)? What is Rawls saying, for example, about the seemingly intractable conflicts in present-day Northern Ire land? Is it rational to settle for the third-best solution when one's first choice is not affirmed - as it often will not be - by „the vast majority in society"?154 A „modus vivendi" may be defined as a convergence of rational self- and group interests capable of sustaining - at least temporarily - a tolerable legal system.155 In a modus vivendi (as opposed to a deeply overlapping consensus), citizens affirm the ideal of public reason merely as a result of political compromise, not from within their own reasonable doctrines.156 By contrast, an overlapping consensus is endorsed „as a matter of principle, not merely as a vectored compromise .... [Tjhe overlapping consensus is distinguished from a mere modus vivendi by the fact that these commit ments are sincere."157 In summary, the deficiencies of a modus vivendi are said to be: (1) it is unsta ble;158 (2) the object of consensus is not itself a moral conception and is not affirmed on deep or sincerely held moral grounds.159 With a mere modus vivendi, „social unity is only apparent, as its stability is contingent on circumstances remaining such as not to upset the fortunate convergence of interests."160 At the other extreme, however, an 152 Rawls, Political Liberalism, at 148 (footnote omitted). 153 See id. at 149. 154/d. at 148. See Charles W. Collier, Intellectual Authority and Institutional Authority, 42 J. Legal Educ. 151,177-80 &amp; n. 153 (1992). 155 See Rawls, Political Liberalism, at 147; but see also Larmore, supra note 68, at 74-75. 156 See Rawls, Political Liberalism, at 218. 157 Waldron, supra note 51, at 5, 6; cf. Rawls, Political Liberalism, at 147-48 (emphasis added): An overlapping consensus ... is not merely a consensus on accepting certain authorities, or on complying with certain institutional arrangements, founded on a convergence of self- or group inter ests. All those who affirm the political conception start from within their own comprehensive view and draw on the religious, philosophical, and moral grounds it provides. The fact that people affirm the same political conception on those grounds does not make their affirming it any less religious, philosophical, or moral, as the case may be, since the grounds sincerely held determine the nature of their affirmation. 158 See Kurt Baier, Justice and the Aims of Political Philosophy, 99 Ethics 771, 773 (1989) („[A] modus vivendi admittedly can secure agreement but not one that is .stable with respect to the distribution of power'.") (quoting John Rawls, The Idea of an Overlapping Consensus, 7 Oxford J. Legal Stud. 1,12 (1987)); Rawls, Political Liberalism, at 148 (the stability of a modus vivendi depends on „hap penstance and a balance of relative forces"). 159 See Rawls, Political Liberalism, at 147. 160 Id.</page><page sequence="26">84 Charles W. Collier overlapping consensus „expects more agreement than is attainable or even desirable in a constitutional democracy."161 In the one case, lack of stability (or simply its „con tingency") is the problem; in the other, lack of agreement. Between these extremes lies the middle ground that I shall refer to as „low-level consensus" on principles of legal tolerance. In most practical contexts, a shallow con sensus covering only the structure of politics and legal „process rights" should be sufficient to dispel the specter of social instability; and it is of course much easier to obtain than a deep moral commitment to a specific theory of justice. For most pur poses today, we already do have such agreement on „the workings of the legal proc ess which we allow to adjudicate those of our disagreements on which we cannot simply agree to differ."162 In the practical political context, lack of agreement is much more telling than lack of stability, which is essentially a constant of the human condi tion. A series of „contingent" agreements that are „not... grounded in certain ideas of society and person of a political conception, much less in a shared public concep tion,"163 may be an unsatisfying theoretical or philosophical solution; but it may well be the best that we can realistically hope for in the practical political world. Consider the following example suggested by Kurt Baier: Suppose you and I disagree on the validity of the claims we both advance to the owner ship of a particular horse and that we finally agree to toss a coin to settle the issue one way or the other rather than let the dispute drag on forever.164 This example highlights the importance of the distinction introduced earlier between „resolving" differences and merely „transcending" them.165 In neither case is our „rea sonableness" at issue (at least not in the peculiar Rawlsian sense of „agreeable ness"). The issue is, rather: How important is our disagreement? What lies beyond it? What kind of social life will be possible after it? What, in the little time we have, is truly worth engaging our faculties of disagreement? Is the dispute one that raises intracta ble moral dilemmas that must be immediately, definitively, and „correctly" resolved? If so, we may conclude that the matter simply must be decided our way, by force if necessary, and even at the great risk of social instability.166 If not, however, there are ways that the dispute may be left unresolved without rending asunder the fabric of society. We may arbitrarily „settle" the issue without insisting upon any claims of sub stantive justice, e.g. by tossing a coin. This would be an „agreement" to the effect that any real agreement was in principle unattainable, strategically impractical, or tactical ly not worth the trouble. Or we may „abide by the established legal procedures, which embody at least some (though perhaps confused or inconsistent) principles of sub 161 Baier, supra note 158, at 773. It should be noted that Baler is referring to „philosophical (as op posed to political) liberalism." Id. But in my view Rawls' „political" liberalism also „expects more agreement than is attainable or even desirable in a constitutional democracy" and thus lies closer to the „philosophical" extreme. 162 Id. at 774; cf. id. at 775 („[Although there seems to be no consensus on a conception of justice, there is a consensus on something else, namely, on the procedures for making and interpreting law and, where that agreement is insufficiently deep to end disagreement, on the selection of persons whose adjudication is accepted as authoritative."). 163 Rawls, Political Liberalism, at 158. 164 Baier, supra note 158, at 775. 165 See sections III.A. and III.B.2. supra. 166 Of this possibility Rawls says only that „whenever someone insists... that certain questions are so fundamental that to insure their being rightly settled justifies civil strife ... we may have no alterna tive but to deny this, or to imply its denial and hence to maintain the kind of thing we had hoped to avoid."

This approach suggests that we may agree on the value of some sort of neutral adjudicative proce dures and institutions, even if we agree on this for different reasons, and even if we agree on nothing else. That sort of agreement - lying beneath or beyond our overt disagreement - provides the basis for a regime of legal tolerance. The fact that such a modus vivendi still resembles the plight of the Reformation does not constitute a counterargument to this position.168 In many ways, and in many parts of the modern world, we have not in fact advanced much beyond the Reforma tion in our appreciation of the „simple truths" of tolerance and perspective - simple truths such as: [l]f one may say „God exists" then another may also say „God does not exist";... if one may say „I loathe this book" then another may also say „But I like it very much."169 A theory of tolerance and perspective pitched at a level any higher than this is not likely to succeed. And in fact, the limited legal notion of tolerance cannot realistically go much be yond what might be termed „playground rules."170 But one could do worse than base principles of legal tolerance on „the most subversive politics of all: a child's instinctive desire for fair play."171 One could do much worse. Indeed, it would represent a great and unprecedented advance in human affairs if the principles of justice intuitively recognized by small children could someday be observed in the world of adults. 167 Baier, supra note 158, at 776. 168 See Rawls, Political Liberalism, at 148, 159, and (more generally) xxli-xxvi. 169 Salman Rushdie, Simple Truths and Apostles of Death, N.Y.

But in subsequent sections I analyzed tolerance under the rubric of „transcending perspectives" as a project common to philosophy, political theory, and law. Differences as well as similarities must therefore be noted. A contemporary proponent of pluralism complains that even in these rare cases, when there is sufficient common ground to begin to argue, the argument is bound to end in an impasse, because there is no moral authority, no value, that both sides are willing to accept. If the issue is pressing, there will be a contrived legal or political compromise, but it will leave everyone dissatisfied.172 „Dissatisfaction" is indeed a hallmark of legal and political solutions to moral impasse; and it would of course be preferable to reach deep philosophical agreement on the fundamental issues that divide us. But, failing that first choice, legal or political solu tions represent a worthy „second choice" that is presumably less dissatisfying than moral impasse. Deep moral or philosophical agreement involves transcending the „objective" per spectives of perception, belief, and cognition. Political or legal agreement makes lesser claims to objectivity in return for greater chances of success. The mere facts of agree ment on basic institutional issues of governance and the structure of society consti tute, ipso facto, political „success." Legal agreement is narrower still, since it limits itself to policing the outer boundaries of procedural fairness without even assuming political agreement. Despite such differences, these progressively narrower approaches to the prob lem of social disagreement all share a common root: the method of abstracting from disputed or controversial perspectives on the world. Cartesian-style epistemology plac es affirmatively in doubt our belief in the existence of the natural world, at least until such doubt can be overcome by absolutely indubitable, logical proof. Similarly, in abstracting from disputed or controversial conceptions of the good, contractarian po litical theory constructs conditions for the possibility of a radically neutral debate on the terms of an ideal polity. Finally, a legal system abstracts even from the „reasona bleness" of contending parties and requires only that they appreciate the rational vir tues of minimal neutral procedures for regulating unreasonable disagreement. The first amendment doctrines of content- and viewpoint-neutrality are thus but distant echoes of a tolerance principle long implicit in the intellectual development of philos ophy, political theory, and law.173 Author's address: Prof. Charles W.
