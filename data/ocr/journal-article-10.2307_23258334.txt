Durand and the Nonconducting Image JENNIFER L. ROBERTS The cosmic impact of the electromagnetic telegraph became evident as soon as Samuel F.B. Morse first successfully demonstrated his apparatus in 1844. Both popular and literary outlets began musing on "the epoch of annihilated space," and the New York Herald was typical in announcing that the telegraph had "originated in the mind an entirely new class of ideas, a new species of consciousness."1 The advent of the telegraph was the decisive opening onto a new world of instantaneity, of dematerialized, detemporalized, and despatialized transmission. Information could now move more quickly than matter. Prior to the telegraph, the words transportation and communication were effec tively synonymous; afterward, for the first time, the process of long distance communication was dissociated from the physical movement of material bodies, and the two concepts diverged.2 Despite the palpable sense of astonishment about this situation emanating from the nineteenth-century sources, the telegraph received little scholarly attention in the twentieth century. As recently as 1983, the communications theorist James Carey lamented that the telegraph was the least-studied communications technology and that its inter section with modernity had "scarcely been explored."3 Since the 1980s, and particularly over the last decade, this neglect has slowly begun to be redressed. Historians, media theorists, and literary scholars have begun to demonstrate that the telegraph had a profound and sweeping impact on nineteenth-century literature, politics, and informatics.4 But what did the telegraph do to the visual arts? The short answer to this question is: nothing. For all its radical reorganization of spatio temporal syntax, Morse's telegraph had no direct impact on images because it simply could not reach them. While the apparatus could translate and transmit verbal inscriptions instantaneously and nearly immaterially over vast distances, it was impotent in the face of visual inscriptions—it could not cleave their informatic qualities from their material qualities; it could not translate the visual field into its ribbons of code. Prior to the telegraph, pictures and letters had moved along the same routes, at the same speeds. With the telegraphic transforma tion, however, images were, for all practical purposes, left behind.

This question also has a long answer, however; one that focuses on the deeper implications of the nonnegotiability of the visual arts in the face of the telegraphic apparatus. An analysis of the recalcitrance of images to telegraphic coding in the nineteenth century opens new per spectives on much broader problems of reproduction, transmission, and embodiment during this period. Stephen Bann explores "the dis cursive space opened up by the parallel practices of printmaking, painting and photography, and their shared involvement in image reproduction" in the nineteenth century.5 What if we were to pry open that discursive space still further by introducing the telegraph? Even if telegraphy could not "reach" pictures, how might it have intersected with existing problems in visual reproduction and transmission? Although rarely considered as a form of reproduction technology, such is the telegraph: a tool for copying-at-a-distance. When introduced in the nineteenth century, it radically destabilized traditional relation ships between reproduction and transmission. If we accept that the telegraph altered the media ecology of the nineteenth century in this way, what reconfigured niche would images occupy within that new system? The best way to answer these questions is not by attempting to locate some direct causal impact of telegraphy on picture making but rather to begin delineating a set of concerns about coding, replication, and trans mission shared by both telegraphy and visual media. This essay explores these shared concerns by examining the work of Asher B. Durand, a nineteenth-century American painter and reproductive engraver. Durand worked in the thick of the nineteenth-century American culture of expansion, itinerancy, and technical innovation, a milieu in which the visual arts were closely tied to the development of trans portation, communication, and exchange technologies. Although Durand has left us no overt documentary statements of his response to the tele graph, he was a close colleague of Samuel F.B. Morse, and his work was saturated from the start with themes of replication, displacement, and materiality—all themes that Morse's telegraph directly engaged. One might object that the most fruitful place to look for the outlines of a theory of telegraphic-era painting would be the work of Morse him self. Not only was Morse the inventor of Morse code and the key fig ure in the introduction and standardization of electromagnetic telegraphy; he was also a professor of painting at New York University and the founding president of the National Academy of Design (NAD) in New York. Morse left behind many suggestive artifacts—his first working model of the telegraphic receiver (1837), now at the Smithsonian Institution, for example, was built into a canvas stretcher. This device raises many questions—almost all of which remain unanswered— 14 Grey Room 48</page><page sequence="4">about the confounded relationship between painting and telegraphy in mid-nineteenth-century America. But Morse himself never fully confronted these questions as an artist, because he essentially stopped painting when he turned his attention to the development and mar keting of the telegraph in the 1840s.6 Durand, on the other hand, kept working through the telegraphic transformation of the 1840s and 1850s and was thus compelled to respond at the pictorial level to the new conditions established thereby. Along with Morse, Durand had been one of the founders of the NAD in 1826, and when Morse stepped down as the president of the organization in 1845 in order to pursue his telegraphic activities full time, he passed the baton to Durand. Durand in a real sense inherited Morse's position and also, perhaps, Morse's own unresolved relationship to the visual arts. Durand is best known today as a landscape painter, but he began as an engraver. Growing up on a small farm in New Jersey in the early 1800s, he was fascinated by the prints he saw in books and taught himself the rudiments of line engraving by tracing out the linear patterns they comprised: "On examining these with a strong magni fier," he later wrote, "I could not refrain from trying to imitate their, to me, wonderful mechanism."7 He fashioned his own engraving tools and taught himself the rudiments of the art from scratch.8 He was already something of a prodigy when he was apprenticed to an engraver in Newark in 1812 at age sixteen, and he came to be recog nized as the most talented engraver in the United States before switch ing fully to painting in the late 1830s.9 A constant preoccupation throughout Durand's engraving career was the production of banknotes. In 1824 he cofounded a firm with his brother Cyrus that became the leading banknote firm in the United States and set new artistic and technical standards for the practice. While the scholarship on Durand tends to bypass this sector of his production, the challenges of banknote engraving placed Durand in an extremely sensitive relationship to problems of visuality, multi plicity, and transmission. Moreover, he continued to work through these problems in his later fine-art engraving and painting. Asher's primary responsibility in the banknote partnership was to design and engrave the pictorial vignettes for the currency. He devised a wide range of commercial-allegorical tableaux for this purpose, each derived from his careful study of the set of classical casts at the American Academy of Fine Arts (see figure on p. 12).10 This work is today easily dismissed as banal specimens of a vast field of neoclassical banking cliches. But Durand was the first to invent and deploy such figures on American banknotes. Durand's brother Cyrus produced the elaborate machine-engraved ornamentation that surrounded the vignettes and was intended to prevent Roberts | Post-telegraphic Pictures: Asher B. Durand and the Nonconducting Image 15</page><page sequence="5">counterfeiting.11 Machine-lathed anticounterfeiting ornament on currency is now ubiquitous, and Cyrus Durand was largely responsible for perfecting the geometrical lathes that made these patterns possible (the modern descendants of his lathes are still used today for banknote engraving and security printing).12 The burin on Durand's lathes, driven along the plate by mechanical motion, produced an exact, dena tured, unwavering line that could not be replicated by a handheld burin. And the sheer intricacy of the designs, produced with encrypted combinations of compound geometrical formulae that were set by a series of interlocking cams whose configuration was known only to the engraver, was meant to produce veritable labyrinths for the counterfeiter, who would be unable to decode the construction of the design's contours.13 Anthropologist Alfred Gell's writing on the mate rial function of ornament is useful in thinking through these remark able early nineteenth-century designs. Gell describes ornament as a "topological snare."14 Confounded by the pattern, unable to replicate, trace, or "solve" the design, viewers are trapped in and along the material plane of the inscription. More generally, decorativeness, for Gell, creates adhesions between persons and things—it is literally "tacky," enforcing a delay or lag in the negotiation of the object.15 The Durand banknotes are not only the most technically and aes thetically accomplished steel engravings produced in early America; they are also among the most productive objects for thinking about the broader implications of print reproduction and transmission in the early nineteenth century. If the most influential discussions of nine teenth-century mechanical reproduction focus on the breach of aura produced by the separation of original and copy (Benjamin), the generative space of difference that opens up between equivalent iter ations (Deleuze), and the translational complexities of the medial shift between painting and engraving (Bann), the imperatives of banknote engraving highlight a different and equally salient cluster of problems: the challenges involved in the simultaneous origination and termina tion of reproductive chains.16 The paradoxical goal of the banknote engraver is to produce a large series of identical reproductions but also to ensure that those reproductions cannot be further reproduced (coun terfeited). Propagation and termination must somehow inhere within the same process. Each note must be identical but also inimitable. The paradoxical imperative of the banknote designer is to devise a visual form that both produces and confounds its own replicability. The circulation of banknotes also reveals particularly starkly the geographical implications of visual reproduction. Two basic forms of transmission must be embodied in any successful banknote: reference 16 Grey Room 48 Above: Cyrus Durand. Lathe design, n.d. Machine engraving. Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.

A primary task of the banknote is to produce a credible reference back to the ground of its value—either the exact quantity of specie that it supposedly represents or, more generally, the solidity of the political body that guarantees that representation. This was necessary in Durand's day because in the heated debates about monetary standards every one could see that paper bills themselves were worthless—"insubstantial" or "insensible" tokens of some other value to which they could only gesture referentially.17 Thus, downplay ing the paper—the pulpy material support of the note itself—was imperative to securing its credible connection to the values "behind" it. At Durand's firm, the production of reference value was largely Asher's domain—the alle gorical figures and founding-father portraits place each note within a paradigmatic, con tinuous chain of founding connections through resemblance and allegory. At the same time, each individual banknote I VL LXXO OCIXXXO LXXXXO, OCIA.IX niuxvxuuax uclxxivjla*_»i.o must also attest to its credible referral—its physical passage through real space as a unique object whose continuous propagation has not been hijacked by unauthorized replication. As the banknote is passed through space, each holder must be confident that this is the same banknote that was first issued by the faraway bank, not an unautho rized copy. Thus, if the referential system required that the tangible note as object be downplayed in favor of the symbolic value "behind" it, the referral system demanded the opposite: that the note announce itself as a unique material thing. This form of negotiability was pri marily Cyrus's domain—and it was secured by the abstract, ornamental qualities of the mechanical interlace, which highlighted the surface materiality of the note, guaranteed its singularity, and testified to its continuous movement through the world. The central tension between real and virtual motion, surface and depth, exhibited in these banknotes had a long and complex afterlife in Asher's later work. As the 1830s and 1840s progressed, Asher began increasingly to absorb the functions of his brother's graphic labyrinths—adhesiveness, material singularity, and resistance to ref erence—into certain of his own more traditional prints and paintings. Durand's most aesthetically ambitious engraving project, a project that marked both the apogee and the conclusion of his career as an engraver, was his reproductive engraving of John Vanderlyn's painting Roberts | Post-telegraphic Pictures: Asher B. Durand and the Nonconducting Image 17</page><page sequence="7">Ariadne Asleep on the Isle ofNaxos.18 Vanderlyn's Ariadne had been painted in Paris between 1809 and 1814 and exhibited at the Salon of 1812. But when Vanderlyn brought it back to the United States in 1815, it met with a mixed reception among a public that was squeamish about nudity and generally skeptical about academic history painting. Vanderlyn was unable to sell the work, and the painting has ever since been something of an emblem for the difficulties facing academically ambitious painters in early America. Even so, in 1831, Durand stepped in, purchased the painting directly from Vanderlyn for $600, and spent the next four years painstakingly preparing an engraving of the work.19 18 Grey Room 48</page><page sequence="8">Opposite, top: John Vanderlyn.

From a few feet away, the print faith fully mimics the painting on which it is based and seems to require little further investigation. Up close, however, the technical brilliance of the image reveals itself, demanding its own act of appre hension and appreciation. This is par ticularly true of Ariadne's body, which dissolves into the pulsings of the abstract notational code of line engraving: arcs, dots, dashes, and lozenges, all tracking along the independent linear paths of the burin. Every fleshy swell and hollow is summoned from slight variations in the pressure and direction of this grid or net of line. As viewers we might look through Durand's marks to the narrative image they con jure, but we might just as easily be trapped, losing ourselves in the meandering filigree, trying to trace or reconstruct the logic and order of the figure's mysterious construction. According to legend, Ariadne was the daughter of King Minos of Crete, whose labyrinth contained the Minotaur. When the Athenian Theseus was brought to Crete in order to be thrown into the labyrinth as a sacrifice to the monster, Ariadne fell in love with him. She gave him a sword with which to kill the Minotaur and, crucially, a thread or "clew" with which to negotiate his escape from the labyrinth. Upon escaping, Theseus sailed with Ariadne to the island of Naxos. Unfortunately, Theseus then abandoned Ariadne while she slept (in the background of Durand's print, Theseus is in the process of getting into his bark and sailing away). The tale does have a happy ending— Ariadne is later discovered by Dionysus and becomes his bride. But whereas Titian and many other artists make that moment of discovery the focus of their versions of the legend, Vanderlyn and Durand isolate the moment of abandonment. Although Durand's Ariadne is widely recognized as one of the most ambitious and accomplished engravings of the early nineteenth cen tury, a "masterpiece in line," scholars have nonetheless puzzled over his seemingly inexplicable turn to the project.20 His purchase of Vanderlyn's work was outrageously risky; $600 was an enormous sum (roughly equivalent to $15,000 today) for a young engraver in a still ten uous financial position. Durand could not have considered his engrav ing a good financial investment, given the demonstrated nonfungibility of the original—and, indeed, the engraving did not sell well.21 Why did Durand invest so much time and energy in the production of this particular print? One possible explanation is the Ariadne story's serviceability as a master legend for themes of linearity, repli cation, decoding, and negotiability that govern the practice and Roberts | Post-telegraphic Pictures: Asher B. Durand and the Nonconducting Image 19</page><page sequence="9">theory of line engraving. Even from an early age, Durand understood the "wonderful mechanism" of line engraving as a process of decoding through translation and replication.22 Similarly, the thread or line that Ariadne gives to Theseus is a tool for negotiating a complex spatial fig ure by simultaneously translating, replicating, and escaping it. As Theseus unravels the thread, it copies the figure of the labyrinth in linear form; as he retraces his steps to the opening, he is able to separate himself from the labyrinth and escape. Ariadne's thread, as such, is a fair analogue for the adventure of reproductive engraving, which translates and copies artworks in line, permits the separation of those copies from the body of the original, and therefore allows the trans mission of the original image through reproductive delegation. The scene on Naxos as presented by Durand, however, also addresses the worrisome consequences of this "wonderful mechanism." Once Ariadne has provided Theseus with the linear mechanism of escape, she becomes its victim. She helped Theseus escape from the Minotaur's labyrinth, and now Theseus escapes from hers. As David Lubin points out, Vanderlyn's original composition presents the body of Ariadne as a defeated labyrinth. As Ariadne sleeps, her finger gestures at her own ear and its inner cochlear labyrinth and also anchors the spiraling configuration of her arms.23 But Vanderlyn's conceit does not reach its full potential until it is taken up by Durand, who concentrates and essentializes the motif of the labyrinth at the level of inscription. Because his own engraving work so clearly adopts the patterns of the labyrinth, his Ariadne print superimposes the qualities of line engraving as a medium onto the larger drama of materiality and aban donment in the image. J. Hillis Miller argues, in the context of narrative studies, that Ariadne's thread is a motif of interminable repetition and displace ment. The line that replicates and defeats the labyrinth creates a replica labyrinth ready to be replicated and defeated in turn. This is clarified in many versions of the myth that stipulate that after Theseus has escaped Ariadne's labyrinth, he sails to the island of Delos, where he institutes the ritual performance of a dance that "in its intricate turnings is another ... copy of the labyrinth."24 Durand highlights this endless redoubling-and-separation process by matching the contour of the island of Delos in the background to the contour of Ariadne's left breast. By so thoroughly investing the Ariadne composition with the con cerns of his own material practice as an engraver, Durand demon strates that he understands Ariadne in a way that Vanderlyn does not. Ariadne is a figure of identification for Durand because, like a repro ductive engraver, she makes decoding possible but cannot stop the chain of further decodings. The engraver's code allows images to 20 Grey Room 48</page><page sequence="10">Asher Brown Durand. [One of] Nineteen bank-note vignettes, n.d. Engraving. Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. Harvey D. Parker Collection. escape their material boundaries but is not treasured or appreciated for its own material qualities. The fundamental anxiety in Durand's Ariadne is thus the anxiety that the "wonderful mechanism" of engraving, its material beauty and workmanship, dissolves at the point of perception into pure code. Engravings will be seen through rather than seen. Durand's print protests this situation, as if in an attempt to revisit the body of Ariadne as an unsolved labyrinth rather than an already decoded configuration of lines. While always acknowledging the inevitable pull of reference and replication, the entire premise of the composition, with its focus on Ariadne's abandoned form and its emphasis on the foreground and surface of the picture plane, is that the viewer should not follow Theseus so quickly into the background but should linger awhile in Ariadne's labyrinth, which is to say Durand's labyrinth, this labyrinth of lines, this print, this wonderful mechanism of Durand's own work. Inasmuch as the Ariadne engraving implicitly questions the project of coded transmission, inasmuch as it encourages the viewer to linger on the print's material plane, it departs markedly from the clean and rapid movement into the depth axis that Durand had produced in the referential vignettes of his currency designs. Compare the Ariadne to one of his earlier vignettes in which a banknote figure is based on a Roman sculpture of none other than the sleeping Ariadne. Both Durand's Ariadne and Durand's commercial goddess are supine seaside figures with sailing ships behind them. The banknote figure inhabits a fully active and continuous symbolic axis that corresponds with the depth axis of the vignettes: she is connected to the ship behind her, not only because her own lilt matches that of the ship or because she lounges on the same bales of commodities that presum ably populate the ship, but because the dematerialization and gener alization of her own flesh via the allegorical function aligns with that of the depersonalized exchange value of the commodities she super vises. As a figure, she authorizes the project of departure, exchange, and propagation. In the Ariadne, however, the symbolic and pictorial relationship between foreground and background, body and ship, has been frag mented. The allegorical link between foreground and background is in crisis. Ariadne's body, its materiality as flesh, threatens to remain untranscended. She is an abandoned allegory, an obstruction rather than an abstraction. She sleeps through the sailing that her banknote counterpart perkily supervises. Relative to her commercial sister, Ariadne is a nonconducting figure.25 In the Ariadne, Durand's bank Roberts | Post-telegraphic Pictures: Asher B. Durand and the Nonconducting Image 21</page><page sequence="11">note goddess has absorbed into herself some of the ornamental functions of the filigrees that had previ ously surrounded her. The Ariadne story gave Durand a narrative matrix through which his brother's graphic labyrinths—with their associated powers of nonconduction, singularity, and resistance to decoding—could be displaced onto the allegorical female flesh that had been his own domain. Durand's print articulates a desire for, in fact equates desire with, the abandoned signifier, the terminated replicative chain. That the Ariadne was Durand's last engraving project is perhaps not surprising given the print's profound ambivalence about the very project of print ing, its mission of replication and displacement. After finishing this "valedictory to the burin" in 1835, Durand abandoned engraving and moved into a career in oil painting.26 Two years later, in 1837, Morse began constructing his models for an electromagnetic telegraph. As the technology was adopted and seized the imagination of the world in the 1840s, the discursive field that it rapidly generated among the scientific and general press was eerily similar in its thematic and technical concerns to the questions of linearity, transmission, flight, and materiality with which Durand had grappled in his Ariadne engraving. How might we define the inter sections between Morse's telegraph and Durand's print? What are the contours of the conceptual and aesthetic territory they share? First: throughout early discussions of the new technology, the telegraph triggered associations with printing. The telegraph was frequently described in early articles as if it were a miraculously long range printing press.27 Morse's receiver worked by producing inden tations or gouges on the strip of paper, just as in the printing process.28 In court cases surrounding Morse's patents, his telegraph was com monly compared to the printing press as a way of establishing prece dent for Morse's invention.29 More generally, the telegraph was often compared to the printing press in the revolutionary magnitude of its impact on society.30 The technology evoked not only the printing of text but also, specifically, reproductive line engraving in the visual realm. While Morse code may have seemed alien to some, it would have had an air of familiarity about it to anyone involved in line engraving. Just as the task of the line engraver is to translate a pictorial prototype into lines and dots, so the task of the telegrapher is to trans late a verbal prototype into lines and dots.31 Second: from the outset, the telegraph was associated, like the Ariadne 22 Grey Room 48 Asher Brown Durand after John Vanderlyn. Ariadne, 1835. Detail. Etching and engraving. Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. Gift of Miss Mary Woodman.</page><page sequence="12">A — M A N B ? C—- ° D — P E - Q E R F S 0 T H U 1 - u J V K W T.

Information could now, for the first time, move more quickly than material bodies, and this astounding fact was quickly dramatized in narratives of flight and capture that explored the newly conspicuous ponderous ness of the human body and its traditional modes of transportation. One outlet for this i i .i l • r . • p i • new interest in differential speed was the proliferation of narratives about the telegraph's ability to aid in the capture of fleeing criminals. Hitherto it has been thought that a man having the start for any object by railway was secure from pursuit, but now this new agent will arrest his progress or anticipate his arrival at any point with more ease than a man on the fleetest horse could overtake another on foot.32 Seemingly every day, some new spectacular demonstration appeared of the fact that bodies would now forever lag behind the pace of infor mation—abandoned or overtaken, like Ariadne, as transmissions passed them by. Third: the telegraph was frequently connected to labyrinths and ornaments, or rather the undoing of such patterns. The technology was quickly hailed, for example, as an antilabyrinthine force in the field of language. An 1848 article in the United States Democratic Review, "Influence of the Telegraph upon Literature," predicted that the terse, condensed, and economical form of telegraphic communi cation would finally allow literature to escape the digressive labyrinths of ornamental rhetoric and approach its immaterial destiny as the vehicle of pure thought. Language, for the review, had too often "been beguiled from its direct course into some untrodden bye-path"; its "every useless ornament.. . [was] but a troublesome encumbrance."33 The telegraph would free written language from the tangles of rhetoric in which it had for too long been snared. If we were to map the telegraph back onto the Ariadne print, it would plug neatly into place as a kind of super-Thesean force, infi nitely accelerating and attenuating the powers of decoding, demateri alization, and displacement already articulated by the myth and by Durand's mediation of it. Inasmuch as the telegraph could be imagined to be a faster, variant form of reproductive engraving, as a principle of the bypass or abandonment of matter, and as a force that untangled labyrinths, it was a technology whose implications were continuous with the drama of displacement on Durand's island of Naxos. But the shared concerns of the telegraph and the print made their radical differences only more evident. First, because the codes of Roberts | Post-telegraphic Pictures: Asher B. Durand and the Nonconducting image 23</page><page sequence="13">telegraphy were carried instanta neously over long distances by elec tricity, telegraphy obliterated the indexicality assumed of printing. There was no longer any presumed adjacency between original and copy, no longer any question of spa tial contiguity (beyond the tenuous thread of the telegraph line itself). Unlike line engraving, the telegraph raised the specter of a total deracination of information, a vaporization of the spatial and material relationships between inscriptions and copies. Second, in practice, the telegraph was simply unable to exercise its dematerializing powers in the sphere of the visual. Morse code could not decode and transmit images, although the basic outline of the scanning fax machine would soon be imagined. By 1848 Alexander Bain had announced his "Copying Telegraph" capable of transmitting and reproducing line drawings as well as text: The "Copying Telegraph" is capable of transmitting the fac simile of any communication in writing or printing, or of any other figure, including a profile of the "human face divine," so that the physiognomy of a runaway could be sent to all the outposts of the kingdom in two or three minutes.34 But this technology remained undeveloped in the United States and did not become widely used even for specialized purposes until the turn of the twentieth century. For now, telegraphic technology was unable to engage with the visual arts. Its failure to do so had enormous significance for the history of media in the nineteenth century. After the telegraph, the "Ariadne complex," the imagination of a material body abandoned by code and transmission, could apply to the full spectrum of visual arts, whether painting, engraving, drawing, or photography. All of these visual formats were now "left behind" by the telegraph, unified in their shared resistance to the incursions of telegraphic code. Suddenly the materiality of visual configurations, crystallized by their recalcitrance to electronic translation and the continued indexicality required of their reproduction, became con spicuous in a new way. In the mid-1840s, just at the point of introduction of Morse's apparatus, Durand began producing a strange series of nature studies that had no precedent in American art. Painted during the summers and continu 24 Grey Room 48 Above: Asher Brown Durand. Ariadne, n.d. Etching, before engraving and chine colle, early state. Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.

During the 1840s and 1850s, Durand was the leading figure in the perfection and promotion of the plein-air oil study among American artists. Although he did produce grand, showpiece studio landscapes throughout these years, his studies can not be dismissed as merely subsidiary or preparatory to those more traditional paintings. He considered the studies to be unique, finished works in their own right, and exhibited them as such at the National Academy of Design and elsewhere.35 These studies represent the continuation and distillation of the "Ariadne complex" in Durand's work after the introduction of the tele graph. Strong connections exist between the figure of Ariadne and the similarly recumbent geological configurations that populate Durand's nature studies. This uncanny alignment is most evident in Landscape: Creek and Rocks, a plein-air study from sometime during the 1850s. Both Ariadne and her sandstone substitute are supine figures that exhibit a partial torsion upward addressing the picture plane. Both stretch out to occupy nearly the entire horizontal extent of the picture surface, serving to intercept the connection between foreground and background while also establishing the essentially horizontal stratifi cation of the composition as a whole. The figures repose in similar relationships to the shallow embankment of a creek running in front of them and a forested area hemming in the area behind them. There are nearly identical outcroppings and sprays of foliage in the lower left corners of the two images. The compositional relationships become especially striking when we consider the first state of the print, where the blank block of space that will become Ariadne and her robes has an especially stark con tour. This allows us to see the similarities between the stepped upper contour of the boulder with the rise and run of the robe as it corners Roberts | Post-telegraphic Pictures: Asher B. Durand and the Nonconducting Image 25</page><page sequence="15">and deviates around Ariadne's hip, feet, and ankles; the hooklike pattern taken by the light as it strikes the left section of the main boulder, and a similar point in the edge of Ariadne's blanket; and the dark diagonal striations in the small rock at left, coupled with its lighter face turn ing leftward, and the hair and crooked forearm of Ariadne's left arm. Where the painting differs from the print is in the near-total sup pression of the depth axis; that is, the "Thesean" axis with its conno tations of decoding and transmission. The painting gives the slightest hint of an opening to depth in the upper right-hand corner of the canvas, erstwhile or previous location of the departing boat—but it is cancelled by an arboreal tangle. Landscape: Creek and Rocks gives us a petrified Ariadne returned to a condition of undecodable material ity, primary tactility, and direct spatial adjacency. Many theoretical vocabularies might be deployed to engage this retrospective concretion or petrifaction, but perhaps the most indis pensable is the language of fetishism. The painting exhibits almost all of the general historical characteristics of the object category of the fetish as enumerated by William Pietz in his seminal articles on the history of the concept. Durand's studies work like fetishes in their material irreducibility, their nontransparency to reference, their apparent randomness, and their strongly locative or territorialized quality.36 They also embody the Freudian fetish's project of disavowal, inasmuch as they attempt to recover a spatial materiality in the land scape that had already been threatened by the regime of code. One thing is certain: these geological formations are also wish formations and compromise formations. Against the threat of its dematerializa tion and deterritorialization in code, Durand highlights and preserves the materiality both of landscape and of painting, its literal presence as and in real space. As Pietz writes, "The fetish is precisely not a material signifier referring beyond itself, but acts as a material space, gathering an otherwise unconnected multiplicity into the unity of its enduring singularity."37 The painting provides just this material space. Instead of a visual rhetoric of conductivity, Durand substitutes a visual rhetoric of insulation, adhesion, and gathering. In Creek and Rocks, Ariadne's qualities as material territory, as labyrinth, as delay and diversion, all tied to a principle of foregrounding, surface address, and refusal of the turnstile function of the depth axis, are made coter minous with painting itself. Most of Durand's other studies follow this pattern: quasi-anthropomorphic geological subject matter arranged in the extreme foreground, suppression of depth, intensely particularizing detail, found rather than composed arrangements, plein-air production, and reduction of allegorical reference. Durand's nature studies raise questions about the degree to which we might understand the development of a veritably materialist 26 Grey Room 48</page><page sequence="16">Asher Brown Durand.

Durand. painterly practice as related to the newly conspicuous materiality of the visual arts in the wake of the telegraph. If the telegraph gathered verbal language up into a realm of instantaneous and disembodied transmission, but left pictures—especially paintings—behind; if paintings were abandoned remainders of this telegraphic rapture, objects that still needed to be hauled physically from place to place; if paintings now seemed heavier, slower, and, for lack of a better term, stickier than they had before, then Durand's studies imagine how painting might unapologetically embody this status. Durand's studies announce their own weight and slowness, their noncommunicability, by performing those properties at the level of content and materiality. The general spatial structure of the paintings draws attention to the surface of the canvas as a material presence. Consider the foregrounding function of Study of a Wood Interior, painted around 1855, an intensely particularizing image of mossy, jumbled rocks and tree trunks, pictured in filtered forest light and arranged as found, without evident compositional adjustment. A fore ground study, it focuses exclusively on textures and surfaces encoun tered at close range. The heap of boulders directly blocks the viewer's imaginary path into the space, the branches and brambles tangling across the picture plane keep the eye close to the surface of the paint ing, what passes for a background is an undifferentiated mass of feath ery brushstrokes, and the net-like or lattice-like disposition of the main compositional lines, which fall in chiastic patterns, seems designed to cancel forward movement. The facture also has a strangely unfocused quality, its even, soft brushwork lending all objects an equivalent focal weight. The work offers no sense of a focal plane or point, no sharpness that might suggest an object sitting at any precisely measurable distance. The painting is thus not just a passive foreground study but evinces an active process and principle of foregrounding. In his "Letters on Roberts | Post-telegraphic Pictures: Asher B. Durand and the Nonconducting Image 27</page><page sequence="17">Landscape Painting" (the closest thing we have to a theoretical plat form from Durand), published in The Crayon in 1855, Durand posi tions such close, adjacent study as the founding process of all landscape painting.38 Distances must only be tackled step by laborious step, after grounding perception in the study of the foreground. "The study of fore ground objects," he claims, "is worthy whole years of labor."39 By experimenting with various techniques in these studies, Durand found a way to take all of the per spectival indicators and spatial illu sions of landscape painting and neutralize them by holding them to the foreground in a state of material suspension. The geological subject matter of the studies permits him to develop a foreground temporal ity, an exploration of duration that does not depend upon proces sional sweeps and atmospheric perspective. The mosses and lichens further emphasize this, adding a layer of biological time to the miner alogical but not requiring any recessional temporal triggers. The boul ders also provide a perfect geological analogue for the glaciated or precipitated or diluviated matter that is now also painting. And the moss along the stones functions as an index of stasis and performs a logic of adhesion and gathering (as in gathering moss). This material ist foregrounding operates even in pictures that do allow a peek into the background, a glimpse of atmosphere. In Landscape with Birches, for example, the mountains in the background are painted with a vaporous touch indicating distance, but so are the mosses in the very near foreground. The mosses are both densely material and aerial (as Robert Morris says of Paul Cezanne's paintings)—a materialization of air, a tactile version of aerial perspective.40 In a picture like this, Durand conflates distal and proximal phenomena, bringing aerial per spective into the foreground, making it an additive, material, sedi mentary principle. That these precipitations are carried out in the genre of landscape is significant. The telegraph (and the acceleration with which it was associated) was frequently described as having erased the landscape. Not only did the telegraph redefine the material form of painting gen erally as ruin or remainder; it destroyed the structure of gradual 28 Grey Room 48</page><page sequence="18">Professor Morse's Great Historical Picture.

Yankee Doodle, 1846. space that held both real and depicted landscapes together. Something of the antagonism between telegraphic space and landscape painting, for example, is evident in a cartoon published in 1846 in the first volume of Yankee Doodle. Key to the satirical thrust of the image is the caustic way in which the telegraph con sumes and overwrites the landscape. The landscape is barren, reduced to an almost notional or cartographic sta tus. This is the polar opposite of landscape as labyrinth or material space. The annulled landscape was a common trope at midcentury for the status of both nature and vision in the era of accelerated commerce and exchange. On the first page of the first number of the first volume of The Crayon (in 1855), just inches above Durand's first letter on land scape painting, the editors chastise men of business by asking, "Does the world of nature absolutely lie around them a waste desert—only so much space to be got over, where they travel with blinded eyes?"41 The telegraph and its associated operation of spatiotemporal collapse gained cultural potency through alignment with an entire spectrum of other anxieties in antebellum America: the speed and abstraction of commercial exchange, the erosion of social distinctions and gradations through democracy, the figuring of unnatural sociabilities through the rhetorics of mesmerism and magnetism. In speaking of "the telegraph" here, I am naming not just a technology but also the entire problem (to borrow a phrase from Edgar Allan Poe) of the "misadmeasurement of . . . propinquity" of a society struggling with rapidly collapsing dis tances and differences.42 In contrast, Durand's letters on landscape return again and again to tropes of slowness and gradualism and its associated values of material presence. These tropes emerge primar ily in his discussion of building depth slowly from foreground study but also find other deployments. For example, he writes about prefer ring the slow gathering of light in a landscape to the instantaneous effects of lightning: "The faint blush of morning light that calls up the sleeping mists of the valley, may declare its presence as surely as the lurid flash."43 Lightning was also a ubiquitous term for the action of the telegraphic message, and it was common to refer to the tele graph as a "lightning machine" and Morse as a "lightning man." Given Durand's emphasis on weight, slowness, and real space, the completion of the studies as plein-air paintings is especially signifi cant. The development of pleinairism in nineteenth-century painting is normally associated with technological advancement and particu larly with speed (inasmuch as it was encouraged by advances in paint formulation and packaging and by rapid rail travel to and from the Roberts | Post-telegraphic Pictures: Asher B. Durartd and the Nonconducting Image 29</page><page sequence="19">countryside in France and elsewhere). But in Durand's practice it serves more emphatically as a mark and strategy of deceleration. Durand's plein-air landscape studies offer views carried directly, like fresh pro duce, from the forests to the city. The direct physical transmission of the completed painting from the wilderness to the gallery became part of its production process and its rhetorical positioning. The point is not just that these images were gathered on site but that they were car ried back, along the ground, their configurations intact as a material transmission. Unlike telegraphic messages, they were brought to the receiver without electronic vaporization or transformation. Like the boulders throughout Durand's paintings that were carried to New England by Ice Age glaciers, the painting holds and tells its history, binding both time and space through its objective status. The picture's own weight is thus emphasized by loading up the picture plane and treating it as a surface of contact and adhesion—as a physical object capable of capturing and preserving the imprint of the world through which it passes. These paintings preserve the reality of distance—not the mystical, idealizing illusion of distance that Benjamin names the aura, but real distance, the real space between things, the delay and opacity built into the communication of matter. This principle of delay was earlier embodied by the labyrinth in Durand's banknotes and in his Ariadne—now it was both embodied and performed by the slow movement through space of his undecodable paintings. The telegraph demonstrated the limits of visual reproduction and thereby revealed a set of terms by which the nonconducting image could be imagined. In Durand's case, that form of imagining emerged when he adapted the labyrinthine motifs he had previously used in reproductive engraving to retard the force of replication and dis placement inherent within the image and redeployed them as aspects of painting and visual inscription generally. Durand's case is just one case of post-telegraphic painting, and I do not want to imply that it is generalizable to all. But the issues it raises might be broadly productive for the study of nineteenth-century visual culture and reproduction. Most crucially, Durand's rocky pictures remind us that if one wanted to communicate an image in the nineteenth century, this meant that a picture—a physical thing—had to be floated, hauled, rolled, or dragged across the surface of the earth; it would be subject to the friction of distance and the burden of intrinsic belatedness. This was true of paintings as well as prints, photographs, and visual ephemera of all sorts. Phrases like "the rapid dissemination of print" slip easily from the art-historical tongue, but the fact is that the land speed of a lithograph was essentially no different than that of a paint ing or a sculpture or a lead weight. Not until the advent of the tele graph does a truly cosmic split in the mobility of media occur; when it 30 Grey Room 48</page><page sequence="20">does, the sudden instantaneity of verbal media reveals the shared visual sluggishness of prints, photographs, and paintings. Telegraphy brought the weight of visual culture into stark relief. How might our art-historical models of the nineteenth century better engage this state of affairs? How, for example, might we see transmission challenges as among the factors encouraging the modernist exploration of the mate riality of the signifier? How might we process the profound divagation between visual and verbal media in the mid-nineteenth century? How might we acknowledge that, for all its frantic replications, foliations, and multiplications in the reproductive media of the mid-nineteenth century, visual culture had been left behind?

Because Morse made this blunt transition in his own career, scholarship on him has tended to be segregated between approaches based in the history of art and those based in the history of technology. While we have many important studies of Morse as an artist and many more studies of Morse as a telegraphist, as yet no sustained studies have worked to understand the intersection between these two roles.

Durand purchased the painting along with an unfinished oil study of the same subject by Vanderlyn. The study is now at the New York Historical Society, and the original painting is at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts. On Durand's difficul ties in producing the print (problems finding a qualified printer, trashed impressions, etc.), see Newlin, 170. 20. Newlin, 169. The standard approach to the question is to appeal to Durand's "poetic" nature and his desire to work with elevated subject matter. As Newlin wrote in 1943, "Buying a huge painting he could ill afford and engraving two nude prints seem aberrations from Durand's long career of rather literal industry, but in his youth he wrote poetry" (170). 21. The nonnegotiability, the material weight and persistence of both the original painting and the prints after it, became more and more conspicuous as the years went on.

"This Telegraph has not yet been put in practice, from the circumstance of its requiring greater accuracy in the machinery, and more perfect insulation of the wire, than has yet been attainable for great distances; but these are not insurmountable, and daily progress is making towards the necessary perfection in this department of the yet infant science of Electric Communication." Alexander Bain, letter to the editors, Scientific American, 29 July 1848, 357. Bain never performed a fax transmission. Frederick Bakewell demonstrated a related machine at the 1851 World Exhibition. Giovanni Caselli followed up on the idea and developed a "pantelegraph" that was used by the French Post from 1856 to 1870, but the technology, which was used only sporadically, was primarily deployed to transmit signatures rather than images per se. 35. The complicated relationship between Durand's studies and his large studio paintings is addressed in detail in my book Transporting Visions: The Movement of Images in Early America (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, forthcoming). Durand's studies bear comparison to developments across the Atlantic, particularly the geological landscapes of Gustave Courbet and the Barbizon group in France and John Ruskin and the Pre-Raphaelites in England, but, as Barbara Novak pointed out in the 1970s, they cannot be reduced to provincial subsidiaries of these works. Durand knew of Courbet and read Ruskin, and he did go to England and Europe in 1840-1841. But his studies reached their full articulation as foreground landscapes long before Courbet's (the 1860s), and while traveling through England and France he did not, at any rate, focus on contemporary paintings—or, if he did he did not comment upon them in his voluminous letters home.

Durand's nine "Letters on Landscape Painting" were published in separate issues of The Crayon from January to July 1855. They have been reprinted as an appendix in Kindred Spirits, ed. Ferber, 233-251. The conceit of the letters is that Durand is offering a series of instructions and principles to young painters who want to learn to paint landscapes. But inasmuch as the letters emerge from the develop ment of his plein-air techniques and thus describe his redoubled efforts in producing finished studies from nature, the letters speak most clearly to his own apprenticeship in the landscape. 39.
