The conclusions overturn stereotypes of Dayak isolation and critique ahistorical analyses of cultural traditions in Southeast Asia. The nalin taun is a community ritual which is practised by the Luangan Dayaks - the Bentian, Benuaq and Tunjung - of the province of East Kalimantan in Indonesian Borneo.1 According to the information of older people in the Bentian villages where I did fieldwork,2 the ritual originated among the Benuaq of the upper Bongan river, a tributary of the Mahakam, where it was first performed to 'treat' (nalin) incest (sumbang), which Kenneth Sillander is a Senior Lecturer at the Swedish School of Social Science, which is part of the Univer sity of Helsinki.

The term is frequently contrasted with 'Malay', a generic term for the indigenous Malay-speaking Muslims of Borneo, who gener ally live in closer proximity to the coast than Dayaks. The Dayak groups discussed in this article - the Bentian, Benuaq and Tunjung - all belong, on the basis of scholarly ascription and a weak degree of self identification, to the Luangan, a term which signifies a loosely integrated 'tribal group' consisting of a number of culturally and linguistically related subgroups who occupy the hilly interior area between the middle reaches of the Barito and Mahakam Rivers, in the Indonesian provinces of East and Central Kalimantan; Joseph Weinstock, 'Kaharingan and the Luangan Dayaks: Religion and identity in central-east Borneo' (Ph.D. diss., Cornell University, 1983); and, Kenneth Sillander, Acting authoritatively: How authority is expressed through social action among the Bentian of Indonesian Borneo (Helsinki: University of Helsinki Press, Swedish School of Social Science Publications No. 17, 2004), pp. 39-44. 2 Eighteen months of fieldwork were conducted in 1993 and 1996-97 mainly among the Bentian in present-day West Kutai district of East Kalimantan and North Barito district of Central Kalimantan.

Later, I was told, the sultan of Kutai, to whom the Bentian and Benuaq were tributary in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, had the ritual performed after having himself committed sumbang in order to keep the royal blood pure. Subsequently, in the mid-nineteenth century, the nalin taun was performed regu larly, by Benuaqs from the Ohong river, in the sultanate capital of Tenggarong as a puri fication and supplication ritual for the general welfare of the royal realm as part of the festivities {erau) commemorating the founding of the capital. On this occasion, upriver peoples came down to the royal capital to pay tribute (suaka), and in connection with the performance of the nalin taun their leaders would receive small amounts of husked red and yellow rice (boias mea lemit), which had been prepared for this ritual, and which they used upon returning home in local nalin taun rituals, which were staged in order to promote the welfare of the local realm. This article discusses the development, and the sociological and ontological signifi cance, of the nalin taun. I am especially concerned with the historical importance of its introduction among the Bentian, and in this respect, with its integrative functions, on the local and the regional level. The ritual contributed, I will argue, along with other forms of external influence associated with it, to a transformation of the social organisation of the Bentian in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Amounting, through its performance in both downriver and upriver locations, to a two-way cultural influence between Dayak and (Kutai) Malay society, the nalin taun exemplifies - in contrast to prevailing stereotypes - the general importance of Dayak-Malay, and coastal-interior, interaction in Borneo, and the complex ways in which influence has passed along this axis. From another point of view, the analysis of the ritual serves to illustrate the impor tance and complexity of the relationship between power and ceremony in Dayak and Malay society. Finally, in so doing, and by highlighting the effects of external influence on the social organisation of the Bentian, it presents some material relevant to the classic Southeast Asian debate on the causes of fluctuation in social structure.3 The Bentian before the nalin taun The Bentian consist of about 3,500 people who live in a relatively remote upriver area of East Kalimantan, close to the border with Central Kalimantan, and the watershed separating the Mahakam and Barito river systems. Historically, this region formed the periphery of the sultanate of Kutai, but also an important passageway connecting the Kutai, Barito and Pasir regions.4 Despite a past reputation for ferocity and resistance to 3 See, for example, Edmund Leach, Political systems of Highland Burma (London: Bell, 1954); F.

C. Schwaner even characterised them as 'born traders', and noted that they supplied, among other things, honey, beeswax, mats and clothes to Bekumpai Malays on the Teweh River (a major tributary of the Barito, outside the Kutai sultanate on Dutch direct-rule territory), and brought products procured from the Bekumpai down to Muara Pahu on the Mahakam.6 One expression of early coastal connections is the Bentian's much-renowned system of rattan cultivation, which appears to have been initiated in response to demands from the sultan of Kutai for rattan as tribute.7 Notwithstanding these early external connections, however, the Bentian used to be weakly integrated, both regionally and locally. This is a reflection of the remote area in which they live - located, before the age of motorised transportation, over a week's journey, one way, from Tenggarong on the lower Mahakam - in which there are few navigable rivers, making communications difficult. Like other swidden cultivators in interior southeast Borneo, the Bentian population usually was highly dispersed. Tradi tionally, they did not occupy nucleated villages, nor large longhouses as in the north of the island, but alternated residence between single-family farmhouses and frequently moved, solitary, multi-family houses {lou) in which a small number of normally closely related farmhouse-owning families would congregate principally at times of ritual.8 The members of a few adjacent lou typically shared a common identity and a common demarcated territory (and usually married among themselves), but leadership was normally restricted to house leadership, the head of a lou being called manti.9 Before the 5 Carl Bock, The headhunters of Borneo: A narrative of travel up the Mahakam and down the Barito (Singapore: Graham Brash, 1988), p. 46; J.

Bentian lou were also typically not divided, consisting of one large room only, and the people affiliated with them ordinarily spent little time in them; Kenneth Sillander, 'Houses and social organization among the Bentian of East Kalimantan', Borneo Research Bulletin, 33 (2002): 82-99. 9 My informants told me that the term manti, which is also used by other Luangan Dayaks, was an indig enous one, unlike the honorific titles which were conferred on Bentian leaders by the sultan of Kutai in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

The quest for community in late nineteenth-century Bentian society In the nineteenth century, beginning from the 1820s, the volume of trade in South east Borneo, even though by no means unimportant before, increased dramatically. Expanding world and regional markets, increasing scarcity of forest products in the prox imity of the coasts, and increasingly safe trading conditions in the interior, meant that people in the upriver regions now became more involved in forest product trade than they had probably ever been.10 Increasing demands by the coastal sultanates and the Dutch for exports, and associated aspirations for a more efficient administration of their domains, prompted these agencies to increase their contacts with the interior population. In the case of the Kutai sultanate - which signed a number of treaties with the Dutch at different times in the nineteenth century, but remained largely independent in practice until about 1900, and preserved, unlike the region's other sultanates, a semi-autonomous status even after that - the royal erau festival exemplifies an event that provided an occa sion for such contact.11 For the Bentian, this festival, which is still performed today as a tourist and cultural festival in the capital of the now nominally re-established sultanate, appears, at least initially, to have been the principal occasion for contacts with the sultan ate. Apart from the demands for tribute, a major motive for Bentians to take part in this multiethnic festival, which included courtly Kutai rites interspersed with miscellaneous ceremonies performed by invited representatives of various upriver groups in a grandi ose celebration of the unity and scope of the realm, was that the sultan, especially under the active reign of Sultan Aji Muhammad Sulaiman (1850-99) when erau came to be performed annually, would distribute honourific titles (e.g., Temanggung, Mangku, Singa) to meritorious leaders. These titles, usually substantiated by a letter (surat) and an emblem (seluit) depicting the Kutai coat of arms, authorised their holders to govern specific village territories or even larger districts, prerogatives which had hitherto not 10 This intensification of local trade reflected, like that in Kutai as a whole, a more general, regional intensification of trade, which gained speed in the 1820s with the founding of Singapore and a rapidly strengthening Dutch presence in south Borneo; Jennifer Alexander, 'Must ascribed status entail inequality?

The titles and the paraphernalia associated with them, and the association with the sultan himself, also lent these leaders some measure of pres tige, and perhaps added to their 'soul strength' (tokengjuus).12 Even though these titles were distributed extremely liberally - there was, for example, often a number of Bentian leaders in a single community claiming such titulary leadership - as a result of which they soon became 'grossly devaluated',13 their distribution encouraged ambitions for more extensive leadership among the Bentian, and so supported the interests of the sultanate, which wanted the population to be brought under firmer control. A special reason why the sultanate wanted to encourage leadership among the Bentian was that they considered their remote and dispersed residence undesirable. Probably both for their own reasons, such as a desire to improve trade and the imple mentation of evolving taxation schemes, and because of specific directives or other influence from the Dutch, who had already launched programmes to this end in the late eighteenth century in the Barito region, the sultanate began in the second half of the nineteenth century to dispatch special envoys to upriver areas assigned with the task of making the Bentian and other dispersed populations concentrate in nucleated villages or move downstream to more accessible locations.14 Thus they initiated a campaign which, resumed by subsequent governments, has played a central role in Bentian relations with outsider authorities until this day. These efforts by the sultanate were, especially at first, resisted by the Bentian, because they feared exploitation and had important trade and socio-cultural relations over the watershed with Teweh River traders (an additional incentive for the sultanate to establish control over them).15 However, settlement in nucleated villages soon became a goal for some Bentians, especially for manti whose status and local influence had grown significantly at this time, thanks to the titles and increasing trade towards the interior. In the Bentian case the latter included, in addition to trade with Bekumpais on the Teweh River on the other side of the watershed, trade with itinerant Bugis, and later also Banjar, traders associated with the Kutai sultanate who now in increasing numbers visited the Bentian, in addition to Bentian 'exchange expeditions' ( wing) carried out by large groups of men between interior communities under the leadership of enterprising manti.16 12 Shelly Errington, Meaning and power in a Southeast Asian realm (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1989); and, O. W. Wolters, History, culture, and region in Southeast Asian perspectives (Singapore: Institute of Southeast Asian Studies, 1982). However, it does not seem, on the basis of present-day local understand ings, that a pursuit of potency represented the principal motivation for Bentian interaction with the sultan ate, as J. H. Walker gives the impression was the case with the Bidayuh of Sarawak, who eagerly sought to 'engage the semangaf of James Brooke in order to obtain prosperity and fertility; Power and prowess, pp. 60-6,120-2. 13 Worthmann, 'The sultanate of Kutai, Kalimantan-Timur', p. 54; Knappert/Beschrijving van de onderafdeeling Koetai', p. 627. 14 S.

The term designates a category of visits which were carried out particularly for the purposes of creating alliances between communities and acquiring prestige goods and other non-locally produced objects - as well as slaves. Such visits were characteristically rather formal affairs featuring 'voluntary', reciprocal gift-giving, and rituals held in honour of the guests. However, they typically also included elements of rivalry (e.g., between host and visiting manti) and risk.</page><page sequence="7">LOCAL INTEGRATION AND COASTAL CONNECTIONS IN INTERIOR KALIMANTAN 321 Because of the increasingly stimulated - and increasingly realisable - aspirations of ambi tious Bentian manti at this time for community leadership, and because of their need for the sultanate's support of their leadership, and their desire to control the flow in and out of communities of prestige goods, the development of concentrated villages also became a locally affirmed objective. However, the requirements of swidden cultivation, inter manti competition, and the persistent aspirations of autonomy among lesser manti strongly hampered these centripetal tendencies, making village settlement a slow process accomplished more extensively only in the 1920s, and not very effectively realised even today (many people still spend most of their time in their farmhouses even though they frequently own or are associated with, often poorly maintained, houses in the village). The introduction of the nalin taun among the Bentian My Bentian informants report that their ancestors learnt the nalin taun from the Benuaq of the Kelawit and Tuang Rivers. It was not learnt directly from the royal capital of Tenggarong, although the performance of the ritual there prompted its introduction by providing the occasion through which they came to know it. Also, the distribution of red and yellow rice to tribute-paying leaders in Tenggarong made the connection crucial. Stored in between rituals in special yellow pouches (as elsewhere in the archipelago, yellow was the colour of royalty) signifying the status of these manti as legitimate, trib ute-paying leaders, this rice was said to have been brought from Tenggarong when a nalin taun was to be performed upriver. Perceived as a necessary ingredient in the ritual - required, among other things, for the invocation of the protecting spirits - the red and yellow rice served the function of making the initiation of a nalin taun the prerogative of tribute-paying manti, thereby providing them with an edge in their competition with other manti over community leadership. Thus, the performance of the nalin taun pro vided a privileged means for the symbolic expression of the claims of these manti to com munity leadership. In addition, it served as an important instrument for promoting the bourgeoning development of the institution of community leadership in Bentian society (through speeches given by the manti before the large audiences gathered during the ritual) as well as a vehicle for the social integration and symbolic objectification of the village communities that were now becoming established. The nalin taun is, as already noted, a community ritual, and it was conceived of as such by the Bentian from the start. Unlike the buntang, which is sponsored by a house or extended family group {buhan), the nalin taun - which is essentially an elaborated version of the buntang- is said to demand contributions from all or most families in a community.17 At the same time, there is an expectation that a nalin taun should be nominally arranged by a legitimate or aspiring community leader (in the name of the community), and that this manti in charge should provide a major proportion of the expenditures of the ritual. At the early stage of village settlement, arranging a nalin taun therefore represented, besides a means through which community leadership could be symbolically expressed, a very concrete measure of a mantis worth whereby he could demonstrate that he had sufficient manpower under his control, and sufficient material 17 Sillander, Acting authoritatively, pp. 165-234.</page><page sequence="8">322 KENNETH SILLANDER resources in his possession in order to be able to sponsor such a ritual.18 Being the Bentian's most elaborate ritual, lasting a minimum of eight days, and preferably 16 days or longer, the material resources demanded to arrange a nalin taun are considerable. Foremost among these is the food to be served to participants, including tons of rice - a resource which the manti, who usually had large families, and often, a number of debt slaves working principally for their benefit, typically had a greater surplus of than other people - as well as the domestic animals to be sacrificed during the ritual: chickens, pigs and water buffalo. Water buffalo are especially important in this context, as the nalin taun, unlike earlier rituals, demanded such a sacrifice, and it was particularly a contribu tion in the form of this animal that was expected from the manti. Interestingly, the water buffalo was introduced among the Bentian only in the nineteenth century, brought home after wing expeditions to the Pasir region. Before that, I was told, only pigs and chickens were sacrificed in Bentian rituals. It seems clear that the introduction of the water buffalo into the ritual economy of the Bentian at this time - besides mandatory in nalin taun, it also began to be used in secondary mortuary rituals (gombok) and buntangs as well - was not incidental, but reflected concurrent changes in the Bentian's more general and social economy, including increasing integration with the larger region of which they were a part, and increasing social differentiation prompted by accelerating leadership ambi tions. Ironically, however, it was probably the Bentian's remote and dispersed residence that enabled the development (or at least the persistence) of their practice of raising large numbers of water buffalo for which they are now regionally famous.19 Another kind of material resource which a manti arranging a nalin taun at the time of village settlement preferably should have was a large lou (multi-family house) which could accommodate the participants of the ritual. As Bentians see it, a principal function of a lou is precisely to serve as a place in which rituals are held, and having a house suitable for the arrangement of a nalin taun was an important motive for the construction of many of the large lou that were built in the Bentian area in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. A large lou was, of course, also status-enhancing in its own right for the manti who had it built, contributing, like the rituals held in it, to his prestige. Not surprisingly, then, many of the Bentian lou which were built at this time were unusually large, and in their construction the Bentian used ironwood (Eusideorxylon zwageri) for the first time (earlier, only more perishable building materials had been used in house construction), an indication of the then emergent desire to establish permanent villages, as well as of the increasing socio-material resources now available to the manti for the 18 Indeed, some nalin taun were arranged expressly in order to inaugurate a new leader, in which case these functions of the ritual were especially obvious. But all nalin taun rituals presumably had them, to a greater or lesser extent. 19 Water buffalos, which are generally rare in interior Borneo, but kept in the hundreds in some small Bentian communities, form an important economic resource that occupies a central position in the Bentian's ritual and adat (customary law) economy, as well as in their market economy, as they are sold to outsiders. It has been possible for the Bentian to keep large numbers of water buffalo because the animals are semi-feral and roam free in the forest near rice field sites and villages. However, over the past few decades this allegedly 'disordered' form of animal husbandry has been condemned by Indonesian govern ment officials - who demand that the water buffalos be kept tied or corralled - making the raising of these animals laborious and decreasingly common in those places to which government supervision extends, such as in or near subdistrict capitals.</page><page sequence="9">LOCAL INTEGRATION AND COASTAL CONNECTIONS IN INTERIOR KALIMANTAN 323 construction of such houses.20 Significantly, the construction of such lou also seems to have paved the way for the establishment of nucleated villages; most present-day villages, at any rate, originally consisted of one large lou, which was joined later by a number of others, whose owners submitted ambiguously to village settlement since it implied that one manti, in accordance with government expectations, would count as community leader and hence rank above the others. Yet another type of material resource, which arranging a nalin taun would demand from a community-leading manti, and, to a lesser degree, the minor manti in a village, was some quantity of so-called prestige goods - gongs, jars, plates, cloth, fine spears. Such objects, which became available in greater quantities among the Bentian in the nineteenth century as a result of increasing trade, were essential for the manti for several reasons. In the first place, they were needed to reward the ritual specialists (belian) and other assistants who played important roles in the ritual. However, more importantly in quantitative terms, these valuables would be given during some nalin taun to formally invited guests representing other communities, who would then become obliged to return these gifts in equal or exceeding measure during similar counter-rituals. Besides advancing the involved communities' status as official villages, and their leaders' status, such formalised inter-village exchanges, referred to as tuak, obviously represented a vehicle for socio-political inter-village relations - promoting inter-village integration and rivalry at the same time - a fact which is made more significant when considering that before this, interaction between communities was rare and characterised by hostil ity.21 In connection with these potlatch-like rituals, the invited guests were also enter tained, through performances such as the gantar dance, which at this time was staged also as a separate ceremony among all East Kalimantan Luangan Dayaks for the purpose of welcoming government officials (and other influential outsiders), who at this time began 20 Building a large lou is an immensely demanding project in terms of manpower and manpower costs. This is so especially if it is to be built of ironwood, which, as Douglas Miles has noted, is a scarce resource whose extraction requires extensive collective labour ('The Ngaju longhouse', Oceania, 35, 1 [1964]: 54). Miles interprets the virtual paucity of longhouses among the Ngaju as an indication precisely of this together with the fact that the Ngaju longhouse - like the Bentian lou - is not a communal building, but the house of an extended family, owned principally by one or a few individuals (e.g., a sibling-set). However, Antonio Guerreiro has observed that the particularly large and solidly built communal longhouses that were constructed by the Kayan, Kenyah and Modang Dayaks in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries 'may have been a recent development' enabled by the large size of villages, increasing availability of labour, and pacification. See his 'The Bornean longhouse in historical perspective', in Indonesian houses: Tradition and transformation in vernacular architecture, ed. Reimar Schefold, Gaudenz Domenig and Peter Nas (Leiden: KITLV Press, 2003), p. 299. It may well be that similar transformations in the settlement pattern and architecture that occurred among the Bentian took place also - at approximately the same time and for the same reasons - among those Borneo groups who built 'true longhouses'. 21 As a result of this exchange, the Bentian can perhaps be said to have had, for a restricted period of time, a feasting system akin to those which have been described for other Southeast Asian groups; Andrew Beatty, Society and exchange in Nias (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1991); Friedman, System, structure, and contradiction-, F. K. Lehman, 'Internal inflationary pressures in the prestige economy of the feast of merit complex: The Chin and Kachin cases from Upper Burma', in Ritual, power, and economy: Upland-lowland contrasts in Mainland Southeast Asia, ed.

Traditional valuables outside the context of ritual also were essential for the leader ship of the manti. They represented fines in lawsuits, which the manti in their capacity as custodians of customary law and as house group representatives, often paid on behalf of their followers (thereby creating relations of indebtedness ensuring the followers' sup port). In addition, they represented the currency of marriage payments (which the manti also sometimes paid on behalf of their followers), which according to the customary law regulations (that were authored by the manti themselves in their capacity as custodians of customary law) were to be greater for the manti than for other people, thus restricting claims for manti-ship to the wealthy, and creating the conditions for the emergence of incipient social stratification in Bentian society. In some larger Bentian villages, at least, the word manti appears at this time to have designated not only a position but also a stratum that encompassed the community leaders and their close relatives, among whom a preference for intra-stratum marriage developed, and at this time hereditary manti-ship, enabled by the titles distributed by the sultan, also was established.23 This 'era of the great manti (jaman manti solai) did not last very long, however. Since the closing decades of Dutch rule, with the abolishment of slavery and titulary manti-ship, and particularly after Indonesian independence, following the influence of a revolutionary, anti-feudal ideology, the establishment of new government-prescribed leadership positions, and an increasing loss of local political autonomy, the power of the great manti in Bentian society has gradually decreased, and the Bentian have become more egalitarian once again. The Bentian continue to perform nalin taun rituals, how ever, albeit now without the connection to the sultanate, and more rarely and less lavishly than during the era of the great manti which represented the heyday of the ritual.24 Ironi cally, an important reason for the decreased frequency and reduced scale of Bentian nalin taun rituals today is the same factor that originally led to the emergence of the ritual, that is, increasing integration with the larger society. In the post-colonial period, due to weakened local leadership and a loss of local political autonomy (and stimulation of con sumerism and economic self-interest), a decreased coherence and resilience in the village communities has impeded the mobilisation of the social and economic resources required for the performance of the ritual. 22 H. Witkamp, 'Tocht naar den Goenong Beratoes (Piek van Balikpapan)', Tijdschrift van het Aardrijks kundig Genootschap, 42 (1925): 20-1; and, F. W. Santwijk, 'Memorie van overgave van de onderafdeeling West-Koetai' (unpublished document, MvO 1055, in the National Archives of the Netherlands, The Hague, 1930), p. 23. 23 Interestingly, among the Melanau of Sarawak, 'menteri seems also to have been used to designate a stratum, more precisely, one which consists of what H. S. Morris refers to as the 'aristocrats' in this society ('Coastal Melanau', in Essays on Borneo societies, ed. Victor T. King [Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1978], p. 48). 24 However, the erau festival is, as already noted, still arranged in Tenggarong, and seems to have become more important again with the reestablishment of the sultanate, even though it now primarily functions as a week-long tourist and cultural festival. Interestingly, a nalin taun is also still arranged in connection with the present-day erau festival by a group of Benuaq Dayaks in the village of Pondok labu, 25 kilometres from Tenggarong, a village which they moved to from the Ohong River in the 1960s. A number of selected upriver groups (excluding the Bentian) are also invited to perform objectified pieces of traditional culture during the festival.</page><page sequence="11">LOCAL INTEGRATION AND COASTAL CONNECTIONS IN INTERIOR KALIMANTAN 325 Locally perceived purposes of the nalin taun Nalin taun rituals and communal unity were obviously not only sources of pride for the manti but also for ordinary villagers. The staging of a grand nalin taun displayed, and was believed to contribute to, the welfare and cohesion of the entire community. Thus, the ritual had the function of stimulating the interest of ordinary villagers in village settlement, or at least, in the establishment of officially recognised nucleated villages. The principal perceived reasons why the ritual began to be performed upriver were not sociological, however, even though the celebration of community and the advancement of community leadership were important local consequences of, and motives for, the arrangement of the ritual.25 The nalin taun, as already suggested, is a type of supplication ritual. As such it is of a general nature, serving to promote human welfare in all fields. However, it is especially concerned with the natural environment. As its name - nalin taun, 'to treat the year' - suggests, a basic purpose of the ritual is to affect favourably the courses of the natural cycles, so that, to repeat the perhaps most famous formulation of its intent, 'fruits ripen, honey abounds, wild boar flock, fish swarm' (adi bua mua, wani murek, bawijapi, kinasjelur). The greatest concern of the ritual is the one natural cycle of the yearly seasons, which is to regulate rice cultivation. Interestingly, success in rice culti vation is both a prerequisite for, and the dearest goal of the nalin taun. Rice - that is, a reasonably plentiful harvest - is required to hold the ritual, and it is the desire for more or, perhaps more usually, the fear of a failed harvest, that prompts its arrangement. One of the most common reasons why the ritual is held is in fulfilment of a vow {niai) which has been made to the spirits in the hope of thus inducing them - in return for sacrifices dedicated to them during the ritual - to cause either rain or dry weather. However, being concerned with human well-being in general, a nalin taun may also be held for a variety of reasons not having directly to do with the natural environment. It may be performed, for example, in response to widespread illness or other forms of collective misfortune, or in order to inaugurate a new village site or leader - providing that the concern prompting its arrangement is of importance to the community. Today, as before, one of the most commonly identified causes of collective misfortune is sumbang, illicit sexual or marital relations. Whatever the more precise objectives of a particular nalin taun, the ritual attempts to achieve its goals by inviting, presenting offerings and appealing to the protecting spirits, including, most notably, the heavenly and rather god-like seniang, a category of spirits that may not be 'descended' (pedolui), that is, called down from heaven to partici pate in the ritual, during any other lesser-ranking ritual. These somewhat distant and highly authoritative spirits are classified as protecting spirits (pengiring), but they are also 25 Indeed, staging a nalin taun primarily in order to advance or celebrate status was probably unaccept able or is at least regarded as improper today. I was told that spirits cannot be contacted for such (immoral) reasons alone, since this would offend them. Illness, or communal well-being, must also be at stake. This probably reflects an egalitarian ideology which forces the Bentian to conceal attempts to advance status interests as attempts to promote communal well-being. For some similarly motivated reservations regard ing the ritual expression of status concerns among the Lisu of northern Thailand, see Paul E. Durrenberger, 'Lisu ritual, economy, and ideology', in Ritual, power, and economy, ed. Susan D. Russell, p. 115. This egalitarian ideology likely predates the period of village settlement and integration with the sultanate in the nineteenth century (before which the Bentian are said to have been more egalitarian than they hitherto became), even though it has been supported by post-colonial developments as well; Sillander, Acting authoritatively, pp. 236-65.</page><page sequence="12">326 KENNETH SILLANDER referred to more specifically as guardian or custodian spirits (pengitung). Each spirit watches over and regulates a specific category of conditions in the world which is of fundamental human concern.26 These consist, on the one hand, of natural conditions, including such various and typically highly unpredictable natural cycles as the sequences of the sun, moon and year; the fruiting of trees; the periodical occurrence of wild honey; and the migrations of wild boar. On the other hand, they also consist of a wide range of conditions pertaining to social or personal human life, including various prohibitions regulating social interaction (such as sexual relations), the rules and practice of custom ary law (adat), the length of lives, and the allotment of luck. Thus, the seniang collectively regulate the order of the world: society, nature and cosmos. The proper functioning of the world is ultimately in their hands. Consequently, if anything goes wrong, and everything else has been done to repair it, the last resort is to turn to the arrangement of the largest and most costly of rituals, the nalin taun. Ultimately, however, Bentians say, in accordance with their generally anthropomorphic worldview, if anything goes wrong, this is the result of human fault, and if something goes seriously wrong, it is likely the result of human transgression of the basic rules which are regulated by the seniang. There is consequently, in accordance with a pattern typical for Borneo and South east Asia, a connection between human action and conditions in nature.27 The logic is that the seniang, being the guardians of social life, and at the same time, the guardians of natural conditions, may become induced by human misbehaviour to upset the proper order of things just as they may be induced to restore it, if proper action is taken. Hence, the idea that incest, or inter-generational marriage, which are regarded as particularly serious transgressions of proper social conduct - presumably on account of being particularly ontologically upsetting - may cause certain events, such as solar eclipses or prolonged drought.28 For this reason, the nalin taun always serves as a supplication ritual, 26 There is a great deal of variation among Bentian villages and individuals in terms of how many seniang are recognised and what they are called. However, a limited number of seniang would be recognised and talked about in fairly similar terms by most people. The seniang are said to resemble people in outward appearance and behaviour, although they are generally thought to have superior moral qualities. They are essentially moral agencies. The seniang are said to live in specific locations in the sky associated with particular star constellations (although there are a few exceptions in the form of seniang living on earth). The stars themselves, or at least many of them, are also identified as seniang. 21 W. R. Geddes, Nine Dayak nights (Singapore: Oxford University Press, 1957), p. 15; Robert Heine Geldern, 'Conceptions of state and kingship in Southeast Asia', The Far Eastern Quarterly, 2, 1 (1942): 15; Hopes, Ilmu, pp. 4-6; Hudson, Padju epat, p. 45; Hans Sch?rer, Ngaju religion: The conception of God among a South Borneo people (The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff, 1963), pp. 98-9; and, Walker, Power and prowess, p. 17. In the Bentian case, this connection is regulated mainly by the seniang, rather than by any other spirits or powers. The seniang can thus be seen as the principal mediators between social life and natural events among the Bentian. 28 A more specific reason why incest is believed to upset conditions in nature, which may simultaneously explain why it is particularly ontologically upsetting, is that it threatens the conditions of human reproduc tion, and, by way of analogy, the proper growth of crops and life in general. A more specific reason why it is particularly the seniang that should be involved in the restoration of conditions resulting from incest, on the other hand, is provided by the Bentian myth of the origin of humankind. According to this myth, the seniang are the result of incest, more precisely, they originate from the miscarriages of the first man and his daughter. For a review of some Ngaju origin myths which also include this theme, see Hans Sch?rer, Der totenkult der Ngadju Dayak in S?d-Borneo (The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff, 1966), pp. 62-106. Exactly why the most authoritative Bentian spirits are thought to have this somewhat disreputable origin is not entirely clear to me. It is clear, however, that this belief further demonstrates the close association between them and incest.</page><page sequence="13">LOCAL INTEGRATION AND COASTAL CONNECTIONS IN INTERIOR KALIMANTAN 327 as well as a purification ritual, aiming to compensate for and offset any known, suspected or potential transgressions of social or cosmic law committed by community members. For my purposes here, it is particularly interesting with respect to the role of the seniang in the nalin taun that, before the emergence of this ritual, these spirits had not 'descended' (invited to the ritual), and hence had not been extensively and directly nego tiated with.29 The introduction of the nalin taun thus entailed that the seniang became more important ritually, and probably also otherwise.30 Such a development may have represented an aspect of a concurrent development of a more 'expansive spiritual cos mology', to borrow a concept of Robert Hefner, something which might in its turn have been brought about by the Bentian's emergent regional integration and the concomitant expansion of their social universe.31 In comparison with most Bentian spirits, whose significance and appeal tend to be more or less tightly bound up with aspects of the local social and natural milieu, the seniang represent a category of 'global' spirits, whose relevance is conceived of in universal terms. An increased focus on them, as opposed to ancestral and localised nature spirits, by itself amounts to a certain shift in cosmological 29 I was told that the seniang had been contacted before, more precisely, during buntang rituals, although they had not then been descended, but only visited (by the ritual specialists conducting the ritual in their celestial locations). These changes were said to have been enabled by the higher ritual status of the nalin taun that resulted from the greater animal sacrifices and the greater human participation in it. There exists of course also the possibility that the seniang were introduced at this time. Such a hypothesis would be supported by the fact that 'seniang' also represents a category of celestial Kutai spirits; D. Adham, Salasilah Kutai (Jakarta: Departemen Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan, Proyek Penerbitan Buku Sastra Indonesia dan Daerah, 1981). As 'sangiang is apparently a cognate with SangHyang, which designates the Almighty or other high gods in Indonesian Hinduism, it may represent a more ancient borrowing from the pre-Islamic coastal kingdoms. Interestingly, the seniang in many respects resemble the betara (or petara) - which may also derive from a Sanskrit term - the so-called gods of the Iban; Charles Hose and William McDougall, The Pagan tribes of Borneo: A description of their physical, moral, and intellectual condition with some discussion of their ethnic relations, vol. II (London: Macmillan, 1912), p. 27. 30 Among the Bentian and the neighbouring Benuaq Dayaks, a large number of 'sub-ethnic groups' {puak), which were the principal units of collective identification at this time, are all said to originate from particular seniang who descended to the earth and thereupon gave rise to these groups. Interestingly, these seniang were typically descended in special 'trays' {kelangkang, langkar) suspended from chains, some of which were made of gold. The first ruler of Kutai also descended in such a container, as was a famous Tunjung Dayak ancestor whose child married into the Kutai royal family; Adham, Salasilah Kutai, p. 130, and S. W. Tromp, 'Uit de salasila van Koetei', BKI, 37 (1888): 59; and, Tromp, 'Een reis naar de bovenlanden van Koetei', p. 280. In Borneo, founders of Ot Danum local groups (utus) also originate from heavenly beings descended in similar carriers (Pascal Couderc, personal communication, 2003). Similarly descended mythological founders are also reported from elsewhere in Indonesia (Beatty, Society and exchange in Nias, p. 186). Apparently, the institution represents an example of cultural diffusion which has appealed to the historical imagination of both centralised coastal polities and dispersed inland swidden cultivators, in both cases serving to legitimise political authority and superordination. Ultimately, the insti tution is probably the result of Indie influence. Palangka, another word designating similar objects in South Bornean languages (with which langkar, and perhaps kelangkang, may be cognates) is probably derived from the Sanskrit word paryanka, from which the English word palanquin is derived (Pascal Couderc, personal communication, 2003). 31 Robert W. Hefner, Hindu Javanese: Tengger tradition and Islam (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1985), p. 261.</page><page sequence="14">328 KENNETH SILLANDER orientation in the direction of a more global and abstract worldview typical of theistic religions.32 This hypothesis is supported by yet another novelty of the nalin taun, namely, the chanting, which lasts at least four days, of all of the myths of origin of the world and of mankind {Tempuun langit tana, Tempuun senaring), as well as a range of other origin myths that are performed in other ritual contexts. Because they describe the origins of man, the world and much of what is important to Bentians in it (rice, water, spirits, various animals), these myths function, as does the invocation of the seniangin an analo gous way, to celebrate and revitalise the foundations of human existence, thereby making the nalin taun a uniquely powerful ritual.33 In addition, for the same reasons, these aspects of the ritual also function to outline the world, cosmos:, tradition and morality according to the Bentian, in an unusually explicit and systematic way. This indicates that, in part, the nalin taun may have represented an example of incipient religious rationali sation, and a response to increasing inter-religious dialogue. Considering that among many of the Bentian's neighbours, large-scale conversion to Islam had begun at this time - and was in many cases to lead to early assimilation - these factors cannot be ignored.34 Influence from Islam, but also from syncretic Kutai courtly ritual observed in the royal capital, may well have sparked both politically informed concerns with cultural legitimacy and survival, and intellectual concerns with ontologically adequate ritual representation, to which the nalin taun may have responded. Generally speaking, at any rate, Kutai influence on the ritual practises of the Bentian and other Kutai Luangans is extensive. Several rituals which are practised by these Dayaks - belian sentiu, belian kenyong, belian dewa-dewa - are conducted partly or entirely in Kutai Malay, and some of these rituals, which feature many forms of Malay style ritual paraphernalia and practices, are said to originate from courtly Kutai ritual that dates back to the Hindu era of the kingdom. Kutai Malay is also used in the nalin taun {gugu tahun) of some Benuaq Dayaks, who conduct this ritual in the Kutai influenced sentiu format rather than as among the Bentian in the indigenous luangan format.35 Otherwise, of course, the nalin 32 Support for the hypothesis that increasing attention to the seniang might have been an aspect of cosmo logical reorientation brought about by increasing involvement in a larger social universe is found in R. Horton, 'African Conversion', Africa, 41,2 (1971): 85-108; and, J. D. Y. Peel, Aladura:A religious move ment among the Yoruba (London: Oxford University Press, 1968). These authors discuss the different appeal of world and small-scale religions in traditional and modern contexts in terms of their differing capacities to provide answers to ontological concerns in social contexts of different scale. A comparative note of relevance can be found in early twentieth-century Sulawesi in Jane Atkinson The art and politics of Wana shamanship (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1989), pp. 195-213. 33 Although in part stemming from great human participation and great animal sacrifices, much of the nalin taun s ritual power derives from the special cosmological significance by which it is imbued. Com memorating the sacred origins of things and formulating an all-encompassing ontological order, the nalin taun in a sense re-creates - on the microcosmic level - the entire cosmos and man's position in it. This is, of course, one reason why it is appropriate, among other things, for the purpose of redressing incest, which is perceived as threatening the reproduction of cosmic harmony. 34 Examples of Bentian neighbours who have almost entirely or in great numbers converted to Islam - and in the process typically 'become Malay' ( masuk Melayu) and lost their former identity - are the Pahu of the Muara Pahu area, various Bawos in Pasir and adjacent areas of Kutai, and the Teweh River Luangans. 35 Such influence, we may note, is probably not only a reflection of a real or perceived necessity to adjust. The Bentian and their neighbours are, and have long been, attracted to the 'exemplary' culture of the royal kingdom, and the adoption of cultural practices associated with it has probably been a largely voluntary process. In contrast to the stereotype, the Dayaks in this case, as in many others, have not only been intent on preserving their difference and autonomy vis-?-vis the Malays, but also on emulating and becoming associated with them.</page><page sequence="15">LOCAL INTEGRATION AND COASTAL CONNECTIONS IN INTERIOR KALIMANTAN 329 taun reflects, even though it presumably represents an indigenous Luangan ritual, the crucially important mediating influence of the Kutai sultanate as well. Cultural beliefs and practices in interior Kalimantan, like the social structures with which they are articu lated, have apparently responded to, and in important and complex ways been modified by, external political and cultural influence long before the present post-colonial alterations. Rationalisation and cosmological 'expansion' aside, a crucial effect of the invocation of the seniangand the myths of the origin of mankind and the world in the nalin taun was that revitalisation of the cosmos and the foundations of human well-being became contingent upon the establishment of integration and authority on higher levels than had hitherto been established on the level of the local community, and on that of the sultan ate. Attainment of social concentration, enactment of community leadership, and recog nition of the overlordship of the sultan became in different ways linked up with the effort of obtaining the spirits' blessing - and were all states that themselves were sanctified by the ritual. To the extent that the ritual contributed to a more expansive or rationalised spiritual cosmology, then this development directly supported the ongoing expansion of the Bentian's social universe. In this process, political authority - the 'authority of society', according to Emile Durkheim - became, in the terminology of Maurice Bloch, articulated with the 'transcendental order', and thus imbued with the authority of the sacred.36 For example, since the successful performance of a nalin taun could be taken as an indication of the spirits' support, the manti who led such a ritual was also seen to enjoy it. Contributing to this impression was the anointment {ngulas) of the ancestral valuables {pusaka) in the possession of the manti with blood from the sacrificial animals, a practice believed to attract powerful protecting spirits to them.37 In a similar vein, social concen tration and social cohesion became in the ritual expressly and symbolically celebrated (such as through various forms of collective ritual action) as sanctified social ideals and states conducive to health and prosperity. Thus the 'cosmological' aspects of the nalin taun also had some important sociological consequences in legitimising the ongoing transformation of the local socio-political order. Concluding discussion My discussion of the emergence of the nalin taun ritual among the Bentian illus trates the conjunction of several processes: the development of communal leadership, increasing local and regional integration (involving settlement in nucleated villages and the development of tributary relations with the Kutai sultanate), and growing trade in forest products and prestige goods (including water buffalo). The same or similar processes also occurred elsewhere in Southeast Asia, often at approximately the same 36 Emile Durkheim, The elementary forms of religious life (New York: The Free Press, 1995), p. 16; Maurice Bloch, 'The ritual of the Royal Bath in Madagascar: The dissolution of death, birth and fertility into author ity', in Rituals of royalty: Power and ceremonial in traditional societies, ed. David Cannadine and Simon Price (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1987), pp. 271-97; and, Maurice Bloch and Jonathan Parry, Death and the regeneration of life (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1982). 37 Some of these ancestral valuables (called penyentuhu) were notably important for the leadership of the manti for a particular reason; they, or rather, the spirits believed to be associated with them, served a special function in sanctioning customary law procedures, and in being used as magical instruments in certain parts of them; Hopes, Ilmu, pp. 95-9; and, Sillander, Acting authoritatively, pp. 278-9.</page><page sequence="16">330 KENNETH SILLANDER time - ultimately induced as they were by the same global forces - and then also in mutual reinforcement. A striking indication of this is the parallel development in the nineteenth century of sultanate integration, debt slavery, the institution of adat, more encompassing forms of leadership, and community ritual among the Wana of interior Sulawesi.38 Another, more particular type of support for this hypothesis is provided by Maurice Godelier's argument that 'potlatch societies', particularly the more extreme examples of them, developed mainly in a particular period of human history.39 The devel opment of antagonistic exchange is no doubt often connected to - and contingent upon - a substantial (but yet restricted) external inflow of material or non-material goods. In the Bentian case, competition between leaders - fought out, for example, in the fields of wing and nalin taun - for previously unavailable, or less widely available, resources in the forms of titles and prestige goods, was a principal factor stimulating such exchange and the social transformations that took place among them in the late nineteenth century. Titles and valuables were privileged means whereby a manti could attain community leadership not the least since sponsoring a nalin taun required these resources, and since it was in the nalin taun that a manti most conspicuously and consequentially could express, demonstrate his capacity for, and acquire a social basis for such leadership. In connection with the social transformations that occurred in Bentian society in the late nineteenth century, it appears that the development of the nalin taun, rather in keep ing with typical functionalist analysis, served to facilitate them, and thus the interests of the local leaders. The nalin taun, in other words, served to legitimise political authority and integration. In addition, it functioned, along with several other forms of external influence associated with it, to promote the development of a greater degree of social differentiation, and, a more 'expansive spiritual cosmology', more compatible with their now transformed, expanded and more differentiated, social universe. In this article, I have looked at the sociological - and to some extent, the ontological - significance of the nalin taun mainly from the perspective of the Bentian. However, it appears that the ritual served important functions also from the viewpoint of the sultanate. For example, like the ritual of the royal bath among the Merina of Madagascar, the performance of the nalin taun made (through the use of the red and yellow rice) 'royal power an essential aspect of cosmic social and emotional order'.40 Furthermore, by having upriver people perform the nalin taun in Tenggarong, the sultan can be seen to have appropriated or tamed upriver energy in a way analogous to how the Merina kings tapped the wild fertility of Vazimba autochthonous spirits in their royal rituals, or, to pick a Southeast 38 Atkinson, The art and politics ofWana Shamanship, pp. 207-13, 297-324; also see, Robert L. Carneiro, 'The chiefdom: Precursor of the state', in The transition to statehood in the New World, ed. by Grant D. Jones and Robert F. Kautz (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1981), pp. 37-79.1 have found the chiefdom concept inappropriate for my material, because of its association with warfare, among other things. On the basis of the information that I received from informants, it appears that there was more warfare earlier among the Bentian than there was in the era of regional integration under the great manti and the sultanate of Kutai, an era which was rather associated with increasing pacification. Furthermore, the Bentian constituencies led by the great manti were not independent entities that could have developed into states but units that emerged as such because of their relations to the larger, encompassing political entity of which they were part. Interestingly, among both the Wana and the Bentian, the more recent times have involved decreasing social hierarchy, and thus a return to more egalitarian social conditions. 39 Maurice Godelier, The enigma of the gift (Cambridge: Polity Press, 1999), pp. 147-61. 40 Bloch, 'The ritual of the Royal Bath', p. 294.</page><page sequence="17">LOCAL INTEGRATION AND COASTAL CONNECTIONS IN INTERIOR KALIMANTAN 331 Asian example, to how Buddhist Lao polities revived the royal realm by appeasing local spirits associated with autochthonous peoples in annual rituals involving water buffalo sacrifice.41 Closer to our ethnographic location in Borneo, ceremonies having rather similar functions as the nalin taun also appear to have existed in this respect. During the nine teenth century Bidayuh Dayak rituals in Sarawak described by J. H. Walker, gold dust and cloth presented by James Brooke, the so-called Rajah of Sarawak (or by government officials associated with him), along with coconut water in which his feet had been washed, were distributed among the participants who afterwards placed these objects and substances in their rice fields in order to enhance the fertility of their crops.42 In this context, a link existed between fertility, ritual and objects obtained from the government which served to promote the political authority of the latter. Obviously, these ceremonies - which mainly represented some form of community festivals - and the association with the government that they involved, also served an important func tion in promoting the political authority of the local leaders who led and initiated them. Elsewhere in Borneo, similar rituals seem also to have fulfilled similar functions for local leaders, even though not necessarily for the government. For example, Clifford Sather has argued that the gawai rituals of the Iban (which are what comes closest to community rituals among this group) represented an arena in which the 'personal achievements' of leaders, 'in the absence of chieftainship or of a formal hierarchy of supra-local political offices' was 'given recognition within a larger regional sphere'.43 Among the Kelabit of the highlands of interior Sarawak, known in the literature for their inclination to compete for authority and prestige, irau feasts have long been sponsored by leaders, or 'big people' at high levels of the society, in effect making claims to relative 'seniority' and 'goodness' over others.44 Ritual innovations may also have been common in nineteenth-century Borneo, although a relative lack of data on the historical emergence of rituals makes it difficult to determine to what extent this actually was the case. In addition to the nalin taun, another nineteenth-century ritual innovation is the gawai antu, an Iban gawai ritual that com memorates a community's dead about once in a generation.45 The Benuaq, the Bentian's Luangan Dayak neighbours, who today are famous for their protracted and costly kwangkai secondary mortuary rituals, also adopted these rituals in the same period, learning them from the Bentian (until this time the Benuaq had reportedly performed only a rather simple form of secondary mortuary ritual, the setanggih). At least in the 41 Maurice Bloch, From blessing to violence: History and ideology in the circumcision ritual of the Merina of Madagascar (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1986), pp. 94-100; and, C. Archaimbault, 'Religious structures in Laos', Journal of the Siam Society, 52 , 1 (1964): 57-74. 42 Walker, Power and prowess, pp. 64-6, 115-16, 122. 43 Sather, 'All threads are white: Iban egalitarianism reconsidered', in Origins, ancestry and alliance, ed.

Interestingly, competition for these qualities through irau feasts has become increasingly intense and costly since World War II due to an increasing availability of cash, and increasing residential concentration, and now involves all levels of the society (ibid.). 45 Clifford Sather, personal communication, 2005.</page><page sequence="18">332 KENNETH SILLANDER Benuaq case, the introduction of a new form of mortuary ritual at this time testified to growing leadership ambitions and status concerns, propelled by the ongoing processes of economic and political integration with which also the nalin taun was articulated. The nalin taun may also have had parallels in the form of community rituals serving similar functions in respect to local and regional integration, and, more specifically, the establishment of nucleated villages and political relations with a pre-colonial or colonial state. At least, there are a number of rituals performed by other peoples in Borneo and elsewhere in Southeast Asia which the nalin taun resembles in its general form (as well as in various details) all of which also seem to be centrally preoccupied with the objective of socio-political integration. These rituals include the balaku untung of the Ngaju, the nyakai of the Ot Danum, the already mentioned gawai of the Iban, the maw and mabua of the Toraja, the salia of the Wana, the pangngae of the Mapparundo, and the karo of the Tengger.46 Although many of these rituals, with the exception of nalin taun, the salia and the karo, are not community rituals in a strict sense - that is, rituals which are sponsored by, arranged in the name of, and believed to benefit, an entire community - they can appar ently be turned into community rituals in a strict sense as well. All of the above mentioned rituals also seem to be, to use an expression employed by Jane Atkinson to describe the salia, 'liturgy-centred'.47 As such, they are characterised by a relatively fixed, prescribed structure, or in Atkinson's words an 'orderly set of ritual procedures which coordinate the actions of practitioners and congregants'.48 Another common feature of these rituals is thanksgiving and supplication addressed to spirits - characteristically including some high-ranking deities rarely contacted at other times - for the benefit of the collectivity hosting them. Finally, and most important, these rituals all seem to form, to borrow a term used by Elizabeth Coville to describe the maw, 'centripetal' rituals, that is, rituals concerned with concentration on multiple levels, including the concentration of protecting spirits, potency or vitality, the souls of the congregants, and the otherwise typically dispersed, and more or less contested, social constituencies holding them.49 46 Personal observation of Ngaju ritual, 1996; Pascal Couderc, personal communication, 2004; James Jemut Masing, The coming of the Gods: An Iban invocatory chant (Timang Gawai) of the Balei River region, Sarawak, vol. 1 (Canberra: Australian National University, Department of Anthropology, Research School of Pacific and Asian Studies, 1997); Volkman, Feasts of honor, Elizabeth Coville, 'Centripetal ritual in a decentered world: Changing Maro performances in Tana Toraja', in Changing lives, changing rites: Ritual and social dynamics in Philippine and Indonesian Uplands, ed.

As such, these rituals can appropriately be described as rituals where the collective well-being sought after is 'achieved not piece-meal, but by one all inclusive rite' (A. M. Hocart, Kings and councillors: An essay in the comparative anatomy of human society [Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1970], p. 60). And although all these rituals are held in societies that were located on the periphery of the traditional Southeast Asian state, they are all obviously influenced by what could be called a certain centrist logic, similar to that described as characteristic for 'centrist societies' by Shelly Errington {Meaning and power). This demonstrates that such a logic extended also to the periph eries, as argued by, among others, Atkinson, The art and politics of Wana shamanship; and, D. E. Tooker, 'Putting the m?ndala in its place: A practice-based approach to the spatialization of power on the Southeast Asian periphery - The case of the Akha', Journal of Asian Studies, 55 (1996): 323-58.</page><page sequence="19">LOCAL INTEGRATION AND COASTAL CONNECTIONS IN INTERIOR KALIMANTAN 333 The centripetal character of these rituals should not, however, be taken to mean that their central preoccupation, or the key to their interpretation, necessarily is the concen tration of potency or 'soul stuff, or that legitimation of political authority through these rituals necessarily is achieved (and concealed) through this pursuit. At least in regards to the nalin taun, it appears that the sociological functions of the ritual held a particular importance historically which necessitates study of them in their own right. For example, it appears that the nalin taun s most important function in promoting political authority was its social function of regularly concentrating and integrating people on a scale only rarely achieved previously. But even with regard to the importance of the nalin taun in bolstering political authority through cosmological factors, it seems that the most impor tant functions of the ritual in this respect was not the local leaders' (or the sultan's) acqui sition of potency. Instead, the primary relevance of the nalin taun seems to have been in compounding the local leaders' and the sultan's authority with the religious authority of the protecting spirits and the cosmic order, as well as in making political integration and community leadership a requirement of fertility and well-being. Dayaks are typically thought of as rather distinct, and often as having until recently been largely separated from, at least in cultural terms, their Malay neighbours. In contrast to such views, the development of the nalin taun among the Bentian Dayaks demon strates, like the Kutai Malay influence on some of their other rituals, that Dayak-Malay interaction and cultural integration has often been both far-reaching and long-standing, and far from antagonistic. Through its important role in the local and regional integra tion of the Bentian, the ritual demonstrates some of the complexities of the social, economic and cultural 'entanglements', to use Patricia Spyer's term, that have typically long characterised the relations of so-called marginal peoples with the larger world.50 Entanglement, in the specific sense that Spyer uses the word, refers to a form of inter relationship that defies the 'strict oppositional logic' associated with modernity. Such interrelationships, which were probably once more common in Southeast Asia than they became under the influence of colonialism, nationalism, world religion and bureaucra tisation, 'repeatedly confound', in Spyer's words, 'any attempt to separate unproblem atically, "inside" and "outside", "here" and "there", "us" and "them"'.51 A markedly dualistic and essentialising approach to ethnic and cultural difference appears thus as not necessarily natural or primordial, but rather as the result of influence of particular, predominantly modern discourses. In Southeast Asia, at least, such an approach was evidently rather atypical in the past, cultural differences and political loyalties in this region then not yet following ethnic boundaries in the neat and self-conscious way typical of modern nation-states.52 50 Patricia Spyer, The memory of trade: Modernity's entanglements on an eastern Indonesian island (Durham: Duke University Press, 2000). Another author who makes a very similar conclusion is Tania Murray Li in her article 'Relational histories and the production of difference on Sulawesi's upland fron tier', Journal of Asian Studies, 60,1 (2001): 41-66. Li also makes the more specific point that it was 'external authority that enabled people [in the interior] to form the stable sets of relations we think of as community' (p. 46). 51 Spyer, The memory of trade, p. 7. 52 Tim G.

On the other hand, the obvi ous relevance of inter-ethnic, cross-cultural and extra-local interaction, as factors consti tutive of social organisation - including fluctuations in social organisation - deserves to be examined thoroughly in order to avoid ethnically reifying an ahistorical ethnography. For example, by pointing out that Bentian social organisation has fluctuated over time, and that it has done so as a result of external influence, my analysis of the nalin taun questions a previously dominant trend in the Borneo ethnography to categorise Dayak societies as either 'stratified' or 'egalitarian', and an associated tendency, criticised by Jennifer Alexander, to regard 'the political structure ... [as] functionally related to the conditions of agricultural production in essentially autonomous economies'.53 As I have shown in detail elsewhere, the Bentian cannot easily be characterised as either 'egalitarian' or 'hierarchical', and the nature of their historically and locally variable social structure primarily reflects the historically and locally variable articulations of local communities with the larger region of which they have formed part.54 The nalin taun thus directs attention to the fact that modes of social organisation, and cultural institutions, develop in particular historical and ethnographic contexts, and often do not represent primordial custom, but rather relatively recent innovations and adaptions to social transformations and anxieties brought about by expanding social universes. 53 Alexander, 'Must ascribed status entail inequality?', p. 208 (my emphasis). Ironically, this trend in the Borneo ethnography was spurred by Edmund Leach who introduced the egalitarian-stratified dichotomy in his report on the longhouse societies of Sarawak {Social science research in Sarawak: A report on the possibilities of a social economic survey of Sarawak presented to the Colonial Social Science Research Council [London: HMSO for the Colonial Office, 1950]). The most influential studies exemplifying this trend are: Derek Freeman, Report on the Iban (London: Athlone Press, 1970); W. R. Geddes, The Land Dayaks of Sarawak (London: Her Majesty's Stationery Office, 1954); and H. S. Morris', Report on a Melanau sago producing community in Sarawak (London: Her Majesty's Stationery Office, 1953). Recently the distinction between stratified and egalitarian societies in Borneo has been challenged by several authors who recognise that the principles of hierarchy and egalitarianism often co-exist in both 'stratified' and 'egalitarian' societ ies; Alexander, 'Must ascribed status entail inequality?'; Rita Armstrong, 'The cultural construction of hierarchy among the Kenyah Badeng', Oceania 62, 3 (1992): 194-206; Christine Helliwell, 'Autonomy as natural equality: Inequality in "egalitarian" societies', Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute, 1, 2 (1995): 359-75; and, Sather, 'All threads are white'. 54 Sillander, Acting authoritatively, pp. 257-62, 32. Historical analysis of the social structures of other Bornean groups might well result in similar findings. An example of a Borneo population that underwent remarkably similar structural transformations as the Bentian - and which did so mainly because of their articulations with the larger region that they belong to - is the Dusun of Brunei; Pudarno Binchin, 'Local leadership among Brunei's Dusun', Contributions to Southeast Asian Ethnography, 12 (2004): 167-77.</page></plain_text>
