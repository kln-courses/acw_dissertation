<plain_text><page sequence="1">AN ORDEAL AMONG THE T'O-PA WEI BY James R. WARE Harvard University It is all too seldom that the staid Chinese historians have inter- rupted their long lists of imperial progresses, victories, defeats, promotions, and demotions to record some interesting custom that immediately strikes our heart-strings and reminds us again that we are listening to the annals of people who actually lived and breathed - people who were of the earth earthy. It is to one of these oases in the Chinese history of the northern nomadic tribes, especially the T'o-pa Wei who controlled varying portions of nor- thern China between the years 399 and 534 of the Christian era, that we would now direct the reader's attention. The practise which is described in these quotations focuses itself upon the choice by ordeal of a ruler and his consort. Chin Shu 110. lbS records a conversation between Ch'ang Wei ' S], the emissary of Jan Min 4 j] (who was the last ruler of the Hou Chao 319-353 and changed its name to Wei A), and Feng Yii i'j, the representative of Mu-jung Chiin , H j (founder of the Ch'ien Yen 349-370). Feng Yii said "... Moreover, I have heard that when [Jan] Min cast gold to make a statue of himself, it broke and was unsuccessful. How can it be said that he has the mandate of heaven?"

T'oung Pao, XXXII 13*</page><page sequence="2">206 JAMES R. WARE Upon the death in 528 of the emperor Su-tsung 7 V of the Northern Wei, the succession was disputed. Resort was then had to the casting of bronze statues, and only the statue of the third son of Yuan Hsieh yr *, Prince of P'eng-ch'eng g , was a success. This young man then was acknowledged emperor, and is known by the posthumous title of Hsiao-chuang * tt '). It was also in 528 that Erh-chu Jung, desiring to succeed to the throne of the Northern Wei, cast a gold statue of himself four times, but failed each time 2). These facts permit us to assume that the Turkish or Mongolian nomads, known to us as the T'o-pa Wei, did not themselves recognize the principle of primogeniture. Among them it was necessary to know the will of the gods in order to name the chief or ruler. On the other hand, I have found nothing to indicate that once sinized, the Wei, as long as the succession was clear (according to Chinese custom) and undisputed, resorted to their more primitive habits to determine succession. In times of stress, however, it is not at all strange that they should have reverted to the older 1) Wei She 74. 3a 3: "[Erh-chu] Jung mobilized at Chin-yang, and, since he still hesitated whom to put on the throne, bronze statues were cast of the sons and grandsons of Kao-tsu and of the six princes Hsi, Prince of Hsien-yang, etc. The one [whose statue] was a success should be acknowledged chief. Only Chuang ti was successful". iK v -W c M 1 '* Pff Ii I P i -,I40 11)04 I T 4 AN, * A s oE This text might be interpreted to read that Erh-chu Jung himself cast statues of the candidates, but the last statement forces us to assume that the usual procedure was followed and to translate accordingly.

Not only the ruler himself, but even his wife's fitness was determined by a similar custom. Wei Shu 13. la9 records: "In addition, it was an old custom of the Wei that, when about to name an empress, she must be made to cast with her own hand a human statue of gold. If it turned out all right, it was considered a lucky omen. If not all right, she was not allowed to be named empress." 3, 6 lk $ _ ) f X A Ji , o J J lJ ~'; AM 1_.~ .o Wei Shu 13.2b]-6 gives specific instances of this practise: "The emperor, following the advice of all his ministers, had the empress cast a human statue of gold. It came out all right, and she was named empress." "... Lady Liu... since the human statue of gold which she cast did not turn out all right, she could not become empress." " ... Lady Yao ...since the human statue of gold which she cast did not turn out all right, the empress had not yet mounted the Honored Place." f Ji A . o mff: ** Ai^ Â£8^ Z 7i A f X g i 8 * g . loThe first instance referred to here involves the Lady Mu-jung, consort of the emperor Tao-wu lB, who ruled the Wei from 386 to 409. The Lady Liu was his concubine, but, when during the closing years of Tao-wu's reign her son was made Crown Prince, she was put to death 1), and when her son came to the throne he conferred posthumously upon his mother the title of empress. Lady Yao, 1) The text says that in accordance with the old custom (that the mother of the Crown Prince be put to death) she died. S j g 4A A Professor Pelliot has called attention somewhere to this custom, but I am at present unable to find the reference. 207</page><page sequence="4">208 JAMES R. WARE concubine to the emperor Ming-yuan I1 jr, who ruled the Wei from 409 to 423, was also given the title posthumously. Since nothing further is said of this practise regarding the wives of the later emperors, it is reasonable to suppose that the custom was dropped. It is not clear whether the statues cast by the women were of themselves or merely anthropomorphic. The texts would substantiate only the second of these two alternatives. If, as the phonology 1) of their meagre vocabulary would seem to indicate, the T'o-pa were Turkish in origin, we can see in the custom described by our texts a further bit of evidence to sub- stantiate the claim. Tradition 2) has it that the Turks were black- smiths, and it would be quite reasonable for such a people to use the art of the caster to determine individual fitness. Our texts do not volunteer more detailed information, they leave us to wonder whether the persons undergoing the ordeal might not have been expected to prepare their own moulds. Such a supposition is unim- portant, however, for there is nothing to show that stress was laid upon artistic workmanship. The goal seems to have been merely a successful casting. The purpose of this note has not been to give undue impor- tance to what is only one of the interesting customs of the nomads who infested China from the north. One of the writer's aims has been to put in circulation a correct translation of these interesting texts along with a reasonable interpretation of the same in an attempt to lay a new ghost that was rearing its head in our already over-haunted domain. In 1932 the Yenching Jour,nal of Chinese Studies * i -i. issued a Supplement No. 1 containing English abstracts of the articles published in its numbers 1) V. Peter Boodberg, The Language of the T'o-pa Wei, to be published in Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies 1. 2) V. Chavannes, Documents sur let lfou-kiue (Tarcs) occidentaux, 222.</page><page sequence="5">AN ORDEAL AMONG THE T' O-PA WEI 209 1-10 (1927-1931). This supplement contains in addition "a resume in English of a report of a trip of archaeological and historical investigation in the provinces of Hopei, Honan and Shantung, 1931," a product of the pen of Mr. Cheng Te-k'un 3 ^ J. On p. 971) Mr. Cheng speaks of the sculptural ability of the 'Wei Tartars" and supports his assertion by statements which must be based upon the texts translated in this article. It is evident at a glance that the abstract is misleading, owing to the mistranslation of the character chu X as "carve" instead of "cast". Let us hope that this new spectre is herewith exorcised from our midst forever. 1) "In addition, the Chin Dynasty was noted for its painting and calligraphy, and it is partly as a result of this, that the sculpture of the following period is especially remarkable for its delicate charm of line. According to the historical records, the Wei Tartars were themselves skillful sculptors. No girl could become an empress without first cutting a statue, and all princes before ascending the throne had to take part in a similar competition. The History of Wei ( AFA Vol. 1) tells us that the wife of the Emperor Tao-wu i, was chosen empress because her statue was well carved, and Lady Liu and Lady Yao never received the full rank of empress owing to inability to carve their figures well". Mr. Langdon Warner called my attention to p. 43 of Leigh Ashton's An Introduction to the Sttdy of CGinese Sculpture, London 1924. It hardly seems possible that the close resemblance between this page of Mr. Ashton's book and the paragraph which I have qaoted from Mr. Cheng's article can be wholly accidental, yet there is no acknow- ledgment to Mr. Ashton anywhere in Mr. Ch8ng's article. I know of no common English source that both Mr. Ashton and Mr. Cheng might have used. Mr. Ashton has written: "The Wei Tartar period was noted for painting and calligraphy, and it is partly as a result of this that their sculpture is especially remarkable for its delicate charm of line .... The Wei Tartars tbemselves were great sculptors. No girl could become Empress without first casting a statue, and all male aspirants to the throne had to indulge in a similar competition. Thus the Emperor Tao Wu's wife, Madame Mou-Jung, was chosen Empress because her figure set well, but Madame Lui [sic] and Madame Yao never received the full rank of Empress owing to inability to cast their figures well I".
