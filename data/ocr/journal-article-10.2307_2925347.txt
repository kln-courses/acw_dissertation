<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE SHATTERED SYNTHESIS; New England Puritanism Be/ore the Great Awakening. By James W. Jones. New Haven, Conn.: Yale University Press. 1974. xi, 207 pp. $8.75. This is a useful introduction to one important aspect of colonial Puritanism. In nine brief essays, Mr. Jones traces the development, from the Great Migration through the Great Awakening, of the doctrinal tension between God's will and man's, "the objectivity of the head and the subjectivity of the heart,... divine predestination and human ac- tivity'' (p. x). The issue is a familiar one to students of the period, and Mr. Jones's sense of development substantially follows that of our other historians; but he provides a service to students of American literature by making accessible a theological controversy that has direct bearing upon some of the major works of the American Renaissance. At times, he tries too hard to be accessible (as in his discussion of whether or not man can "sin on his own steam," p. 14); all too often he simplifies the nature of the controversy (especially, perhaps, with regard to the Puritan concept of the self); and he omits many of the major themes entirely. The Shattered Synthesis is not a substitute for any of the scholarship we already have, but a modest outline, carefully confined, covering a number of theologians</page><page sequence="2">446 American Literature who are central to the tradition, and advancing a thesis that ought to be widely known. The first settlers, Mr. Jones argues, sought to synthesize the realms of God and man; in time, the synthesis yielded to a dichotomy; and broadly conceived, it eventuated in a "movement from the theology of the divine initiative to the anthropomorphism of the eighteenth century" (p. io). If there is nothing new in all this, it has the merit of providing a fairly safe guide for the uninitiated. Mr. Jones does well to focus in his first chapter on John Norton, and to note the difference between Bulkeley's Adam-centered typology and Cotton's Christ-centered typology. His chapter on Giles Firman calls attention to a relatively unknown figure, and to the transatlantic polemics on church polity. Samuel Willard, Cotton Mather, and Benjamin Colman, the subjects of the next three chapters, are presented in terms that have recently been challenged but that consti- tute a defensible, conventional approach. Mr. Jones's Solomon Stoddard differs somewhat from the norm, but his group of eighteenth-century liberals-Lemuel Briant, Ebenezer Gay, Jonathan Mayhew, and Charles Chauncy-returns us promptly to the well-worn format-in this case, the descent from piety to moralism, from Calvin's absolute and arbitrary God to Chauncy's concept of man as an innately good creature whose chief duty lies in realizing his own potential. One's first impulse in reviewing Mr. Jones's summaries is to point out their inadequacies. The sounder course, I believe, given the still rather desultory state of Puritan studies among Americanists, is to advertise their value as a preparation for a more sophisticated exploration of the early New England mind.
