<plain_text><page sequence="1">PINNACLES AND PYRAMIDS: The Art of Marsden Hartley. By Jeanne Hokin. New Mexico. Art historians have canonized Marsden Hartley (1877-1943) as a prophet of abstrac- tion in modern American painting. The artist's assimilation of Wassily Kandinsky's innovations in abstraction in the 1910s served past scholars and critics of American art in their anxious attempts to construct and validate a modernist tradition in America-rooted predominantly in European precedent. However, due to the Euro-modernist paradigm which has, until recent years, regulated the study of American art, Hartley's canonization was conditional at best. The scholars and critics who heralded his work from the 19 10' s effectively minimalized and devalued the imagery from the last three decades of his life when the painter gave up European-inspired abstraction and returned to landscape and figurative imagery in a highly personal and idiosyncratic style. This bias which dictated perceptions of Hartley' s career was perhaps most powerfully expressed by William Innes Homer in his text, Alfred Stieglitz and the American Avant-Garde (1977), as the author, with a grave and dismissive tone, proclaimed "when [in 1915] Hartley was forced to abandon the congenial creative ambiance of Berlin.. .his style faltered.... [His] most important period was over" (233). The scholarly hand which granted Hartley respectable stature in the annals of American art also took it away. Jeanne Hokin' s Pinnacles and Pyramids: The Art of Marsden Hartley participates in a move by contemporary scholars to reconsider Hartley' s career on the artist' s own merits. Generally disengaged from discussions of modernism, Hokin' s revisionist approach focuses exclusively on Hartley's landscapes - specifically on his depiction of moun- tains - and traces them chronologically through their varied styli stic permutations. Hokin' s text, then, forms a sustained iconographie analysis heretofore absent from Hartley scholarship. By highlighting Hartley's depiction of the mountain motif - the "thread of continuity" running through his diverse imagery (21) - Hokin intends to gain clearer and more direct access to the essence of Hartley: the man, the artist, and his career. Hokin begins her chronological analysis of Hartley's life and work by recounting the sketchy events constituting the painter's difficult childhood in Maine, including the death of his mother and estrangement from his father. The author immediately posits nature's imminent importance to Hartley in these tragic early experiences resulting in persistent feelings of loss and loneliness. According to Hokin, the surrounding countryside became 203</page><page sequence="2">"his adolescent sanctuary from despair" and subsequently served Hartley as a site of potential identification, comfort, and understanding throughout his artistic career (1). Furthermore, Hokin attributes Hartley's continued affinity with nature to the painter's identification with Ralph Waldo Emerson and his Transcendental philosophy. "Both had," according to Hokin, "a passionate love of nature and a particularly profound attachment to mountains" rooted in traumatic childhood loss (3). The biographic thrust of Hartley' s attraction to the mountain coupled with and reinforced by Emerson' s philosophy forms the basis of Hokin' s text, a basis to which she often returns. After establishing this touchstone for her analysis of Hartley' s art, Hokin proceeds to survey the artist's depictions of the mountain motif through their numerous stylistic changes while contextualizing Hartley's career within the broader scope of American art and social history. Furthermore, Hokin turns to Hartley's numerous writings as a barometer of the artist's fluctuating confidence and happiness as, in search of inspiration, security, and acceptance, he moved from place to place: from Maine to New York, to Paris and Berlin, to New Mexico, and, again, to Europe. Hartley's nomadic and restless personality prompted an artistic career informed by many - often divergent - aesthetic influences including the Italian divisionist, Giovanni Segantini; the America Romantic, Albert Pinkham Ryder; in addition to Kandinsky, Cezanne, and Matisse. Moreover, particular geographic locales, such a New Mexico and Mexico, provoked a more personal artistic expression rooted more deeply in Hartley's imagination. Of all the artist's available sources, Hokin singles out Cezanne as the most important in Hartley's career. According to Hokin, Cezanne unveiled to Hartley, "an entirely new perception of nature - a world of direct optical experience of light and color disregarding traditional form, depth, and design" (63). However, Cezanne's ultimate influence on Hartley would have more to do with ideological approach than with style since "what he took from the older master was... a more generalized nature, which would develop.. .into an artistic maturity" (66). Despite European culture' s undeniable influence on Hartley, a central theme running throughout Pinnacles and Pyramids is Hartley' s "American-ness." Up until the end of his life, Hartley expressed intensely conflicted feelings about his homeland while generally being perceived by others as an expatriate. Consequently, the degree to which Hartley's work reflects a native or a more European sensibility has concerned most Hartley scholars. That Hokin wishes to contribute her voice to this complex and important scholarly debate is not surprising. However, Hokin distinguishes herself by declaring, "what has not always been sufficiently emphasized... is that despite the myriad influences, the artist... al way s identified with his American heritage, his specifically American roots in New England, and his unique American Transcendental philosophy" (34). Consequently, Hokin empha- sizes throughout her text a consistent native aesthetic impulse in Hartley' s art, an aesthetic sensibility Hartley himself termed "American mysticism." American mysticism, as the author discusses it with reference to Hartley, is the artistic process by which a personal mystical vision is extracted from the observable world. The fact that Hartley - even in his most abstract mode from 1913 to 1915 - retained recognizable form from nature in his imagery suggests to Hokin Hartley's participation in this uniquely American tradition derived ultimately from Emerson and Whitman. Hokin convincingly recanonizes Hartley, not as a prophet of abstraction, but as the inheritor of the Transcendental tradition in American art inaugurated by the 19th-century landscape painter Thomas Cole. Perhaps because Hokin has chosen to focus exclusively on Hartley's landscapes, the issue of the artist's homosexuality is treated politely, if incidentally, with reference to his work. Hokin carries a common, yet extremely problematic, methodological assumption 204</page><page sequence="3">to her analysis of Hartley - the assumption that a homosexual/erotic or "queer" sensibility is made manifest only in depictions of the male figure. More broadly, this assumption (inaccurately) suggests that subjects such landscapes are somehow uninformed by the artist's sexual identity. Hokin perpetuates this assumption in her study of Hartley's landscapes and, as a result, glosses over important aspects of the artist's personal life, namely, the deaths of Karl von Freyburg and Alty Mason, both of whom Hartley passionately loved. (In fact, the death of Alty Mason inexcusably receives only parentheti- cal mention in the author' s endnotes because the tragic event "lies beyond the scope of this book" [133]). In her inability or unwillingness to resolve Hartley's sexuality with his depiction of landscape, the author misses the true depth of Hartley' s work. It is precisely in the intimate relationship between the landscape and Hartley' s sexual identity that makes his imagery - particularly the late paintings - so rich and provocative. Clearly, Hartley conceived of his mountains in masculine and often erotic terms. They were his "comrades" of whom he painted "portraits." Moreover, the artist discussed the male anatomy in terms of geology. For example, Alty Mason's back seemed to Hartley "like an acre of granite." Though Hokin occasionally admits the "anthropomorphic quality" and "sexual aura" of some select images, she seems ultimately determined to keep issues of spirituality and sexuality separate as they relate to Hartley's landscapes. Despite Hokin' s views, spirituality and sexuality are not mutually exclusive realms in Hartley's art. Rather, they are combined to produce rich and complex images of mountains which possess formal as well as psychological parallels with the artist's late depictions of the male figure. In her conclusion, Hokin states that "the mountain became the essential icon of [Hartley's] personal existence: his mother, his father, his Creator..." Though at times he was uncomfortable with his sexual orientation Hartley's homosexuality was also essential to his existence. In the absence of the intimacy he longed for with von Freyburg and Mason, Hartley turned to the mountain to be his lover as well. From the broadest perspective, Pinnacles and Pyramids speaks to the growth and validation of the study of American art over the past 10 to 15 years. Hokin proudly and permanently reclaims Marsden Hartley as an artist who, in addition to contributing to developments of international modernism, also participated in equally important indig- enous aspects of American art and culture. Hartley literature was in need of a specialized study which began to break down the largely arbitrary boundaries of style to address larger ideas and concerns relative to his work. The next step in the study of Hartley is to disrupt the arbitrary boundaries of ostensible subject matter which Hokin has imposed to address issues of gender, sexuality, and identity as they inform the whole of his artistic produc- tion - his still-lifes, landscapes, and late figurative works.
