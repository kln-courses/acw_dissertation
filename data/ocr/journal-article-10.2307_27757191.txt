<plain_text><page sequence="1">EARLY MUSLIM CHEMISTRY : ITS DEBT TO ANCIENT BABYLONIA MARTIN LEVEY* SCOPE: This paper is meant not only to explore the debt of the early Muslims to ancient Mesopotamia but also to re-examine the question of the origin of Muslim alchemy. It is commonly supposed that in the two centuries following the rise of Mohammad and his immediate followers science and learning passed to the Muslims through Jundi-Shap?r in Persia, Harr?n in Meso potamia, and Alexandria in Egypt. Not much work was done during the Omayyad rule but when the 'Abbasides came to power, it was al-M?m?n particularly who took a leading part in the dissemination of the culture of the conquered peoples. Scientific and philosophical works were translated into Arabic and an Academy known as "Bait-ul-Hikmat" was founded by 850 a.d.1 It is noteworthy that the first great Muslim philosopher, al-Kindi (d. 875 a.d.) was also a chemist.2 The new frenzied literary activity in the three cultural capitals of the eighth and ninth centuries was accompanied by a rapid development of commercial intercourse both within the Muslim Empire and with India, China, and parts of Europe. Another major avenue of transmission of science was by way of the technologists and workers in the many industrial trades such as tanning, metallurgy, dyeing, perfumery, and others, as well as in medicine, food preparation, and ritual practices. It was by this path primarily that ancient Mesopotamian practical science was handed down to the Muslims while Greek learning was largely transmitted through the literature. In this paper, some of the similarities of Muslim and Babylonian chemistry will be pointed out as well as their related ideas and the form in which they found expression. This will be shown by a comparison of Babylonian and early Muslim (a) apparatus, (b) chemicals, (c) processes, and finally (d) their philosophies of the cosmos and natural phenomena. apparatus The preliterate Mesopotamians had a highly developed chemical technology. By 3500 b.c., they already had a still.

The double rim formed a trough at the lip or edge into which the condensed liquid ran from the lid, which was con tinually cooled.3 At Tepe Gawra, where the still was found, also un earthed was an extraction apparatus. This is of the same construction except that the inner rim has holes at its base to allow the distilled liquid to return to the bottom of the vessel after having had contact with the botanical or zoological materials in the trough formed by the rims. The extractor may also have been employed as a type of reflux condenser. Written evidence for the use of the still is found in tablets on perfumery written in Akkadian going back to 1200 b.c.4 Other Babylonian apparatus5 included a great variety of clay, wooden, and metal containers for heating and storage, basins, flasks, weights, balances, sieves, filtering cloths, beakers, scrapers, ladles, stirrers, spatulas, hand cloths to soak up the distillate, many types of furnaces to attain different temperatures, crucibles, moulds, cupels, bellows, and other small instruments. In al-Kindi's work6 on perfumery (ninth century a.d.), apparatus used included a hearth, the still, the sublimatory, shallow containers of glass or clay, beakers, earthenware and stone pots, linen or cotton cloth covers, flasks, cups, weights, basins, mugs, large wooden bowls, pestles and mortars, sieves, ladles, bricks for calendaring, clay conduit for water, ovens, and blankets. Not much different was the apparatus employed by Muhammad ibn cAbdi-l-Malik in his "Essence of the Art and Aid to the Workers," (1034 a.d.).7 Here, among other tools, he used the mortar and pestle, the file, glass cups for volatilization of silver, earthenware jars for heating (glazed inside), funnels, crucibles, furnaces, bellows, pincers, ladles, phials for use in sublimation, lids, and coarsely woven hair cloth. Al-R?z? (ninth century a.d.)8 used the hearth, bellows, crucible, descensory, ladle, tongs, shears, mortar and pestle, file, moulds, cucurbit, alembic, receiving flask, beakers, phials, earthenware jars and lids for heating, cauldron for dissolutions, earthenware pots (glazed inside) for volatilizing tin, sand and water baths, diverse types of furnaces for different temperatures, iron pans, hair cloths, glass funnels, sieves of hair or silk, filters made of a cup with a perforated bottom with a layer of hair or fiber?a kind of Gooch's crucible first used in Babylonia, and others. 3 M.

From the description of the Babylonian apparatus and that of the Muslims, al-Razi, al-Kindl, and Muhammad ibn 'Abdi-l-Malik, it is evident that the Muslims possessed a few improved types of instruments and apparatus. Primarily, this is due to two factors: first, the increased use of glass in the manufacture of apparatus, and secondly, arising partly from the first, the more developed apparatus for distillation and sub limation. Otherwise, the long list of apparatus is almost exactly the same for the earlier and later chemists. It is certain that the Muslims were much better glass and metal workers than the more ancient peoples. The latter were handicapped in their apparatus construction by insistence, almost always, on the use of clay. Earthenware pots are fairly heavy; any appendages built on them would be apt to break off easily. This is evi denced in the type of breaks in the chemical apparatus recovered at Tepe Gawra in northeast Mesopotamia. CHEMICAL SUBSTANCES AND MATERIALS USED The Sumerian and Akkadian tablet literature is rich in names of chemicals, most of which are certainly impure. These are not only to be found in tablets relating to chemical operations directly, such as those on perfumery, metallurgy, glass-making, and medicine, but also on the unique lexical lists. These latter, the earliest grouping of words according to a definite order, were composed mainly after the Sumerians had been conquered by the Akkadian-speaking people, about the middle of the third millennium B.C. In order to understand the science and learning of the conquered people, the Akkadian victors made up long lists of Akkadian words and phrases, then beside them the Sumerian translation, and then perhaps a synonym or explanatory phrase. Although there were a number of variations in the method of presentation and composition, the lexical lists preserve the earliest ordering of plants, animals, anatomy, chemicals, and other categories of scientific interest. Many of the lists are as yet unpublished.9 These lists give such materials as hematite, pyrites, arsenic, amethyst, limestone, alunite, red coral, malachite, orpiment, realgar, gypsum, sulphur (black and yellow), gold (variously colored), and many types of salts, minerals, clays, and ores.10 The medical literature is particularly noteworthy in the mention 9 Many of these are to be found in the files of the Oriental Institute, University of Chicago. 10 R.

In a Sumerian medical table,11 among the simples used were milk, part of a water snake, teat of a cow, and shell of a turtle. Sumerian doctors prepared botanical drugs from the seed, gum resin, root, twigs, wood, and bark of plants and trees. Utilized were the cedar, willow, fir, and fig trees as well as such plants as Menispermum, cassia, lupins, barley, thyme, and many others. The later medical literature of ancient Mesopotamia betrays evidence of the use of a greater variety of botanical and zoological agents. It is in Mesopotamian technology particularly that there is brought to light the use of many difieren t types of reagents such as soaps and other detergent materials, tannins, various kinds of alum, and diverse dyes, as well as many perfumes, alloys, and pure metals. In the ancient Mesopotamian literature, therefore, it is obvious that a large store of chemicals was well known and used widely. Especially is it interesting that these covered a wide range derived from the animal, vegetable, and mineral kingdoms. In contradistinction is the fact that the early Greek chemists in the Christian Era were concerned very little with the former two categories and worked largely with mineral substances. A quick glance at the chemicals of the Muslims will show that they are the inheritors of ancient Mesopotamian knowledge in the employ ment of animal and vegetable materials. Al-Razi,12 in his "Practical Introduction," categorized chemical materials into (a) earthy, (b) vege table, (c) animal, and (d) artificial or derived. The animal materials are of interest in that they included hair, skulls, brains, bile, blood, milk, urine, eggs, mother of pearl, and horn. Al-Kindi, in his work on perfumery,13 made use of spices, oil, honey, rose, myrtle, Ferula communis, Ferula p?rsica, Indian myrtle, pine turpentine, Cedrus libani, opopanax, cassia, fir turpentine, laudanum, myrrh, balsam, calmus odoratus, Amomum cardamomum, and others. Although the chemicals are only partially listed, it is evident that the Babylonian and Muslim chemists used almost similar materials. It is still difficult to say how much progress, if any, was made in the use of different chemicals by Arabic times mainly because of translation difficulties regarding many Sumerian, Akkadian, and Arabic technical terms. PROCESSES In Babylonian perfumery operations of 1200 B.C., evidence is found for maceration and extraction of botanicals, then further on their dis tillation.14 The apparatus for these operations has already been discussed 11 M. Levey, Actes VIIIe Congresso Internazionale di Storia delle Scienze, Firenze, 1958, pp. 843-855. 12 Stapleton, Azo, and Husain, op. cit. 13 Cf. Garbers, op. cit., passim. 14 M. Levey, Osiris, 12, 376-389 (1956).</page><page sequence="5">24 CHYMIA elsewhere. Filtration,15 decantation, cupellation,16 alloying,17 and sub limation are also to be found in the Sumerian and Akkadian literatures. Similarly some processes mentioned in Ibn Sina are coagulation, sublimation, calcination, dissolution, extraction, and distillation.18 In al-Hakim's "Great Gate of the Ta'widh," the operations are compounding of the elixir, coagulation, roasting, trituration, and coloring. Al-RazI19 used distillation, filtration, roasting, digestion, amalgama tion (formation of an admixture or compound with mercury), lava tion, sublimation or calcination, ceration (change to an easily fusible state), solution (cerated products are brought to a further state of dis integration), combination (solutions of different substances suitably chosen in proportion to their amount of "body," "soul," and "spirit" possessed. Sometimes, however, an admixture of solutions was replaced by trituration with various liquids. Coagulation was an operation in which the product was supposed to be the elixir. Thus, the processes in both Babylonian and Muslim chemistry are similar up to a certain point. Notable differences are in those applications to alchemy which required special treatment. Included in these are ceration, combination, coagulation, and amalgamation, which were not known in ancient Mesopotamia. It is likely, then, that these operations in the Muslim chemical corpus originated with the Alexandrian Greeks, who also described them. It is probable that some of the Muslim and Alexandrian Greek chemical knowledge originated from one source?from the ancient Mesopotamian chemical technologists. An outstanding example as shown in chemical technique is that of performing the same operation repeatedly and/or carrying out an operation over a long time span. Al-Malik, in his "Essence of the Art . . . ,"20 speaks of one case of dissolution taking forty days, another 33 days, and a third lasting for 73 days. Repeated distilla tion is frequently encountered in Muslim works.21 This repetition is also to be found in Babylonian chemistry of the second millennium B.C. Perfume water, for example, was obtained by forty extractions of balsam with water.22 Distillation was also often repeated on the same batch. In Mesopotamia, this was essential because of the employment of primitive distillatory and sublimatory apparatus. It was no longer true in the 15 E.

Thus, what arose as a very practical and necessary procedure for the Babylonians became a kind of mystical and superfluous practice in Muslim times when apparatus had been much improved. GENDER AND COLOR OF CHEMICALS The earliest mention of chemicals being divided into male and female types is in Babylonian chemistry. This division seems to have been based partly on the physical properties of the particular mineral. More im portant, the male-female relationship in Babylonia implied fertility; in the case of chemical materials, it probably referred to their reactivity. In Alexandria, Mary is quoted by Olympiodorus as stating that the male and female should be united to attain the sought-for substance for without this union nothing can succeed.23 It is thus evident that the male-female description has been altered from an almost wholly objective usage to one involved in a magical prescription. The Muslims later used the male female idea both for description and for mystical purposes; they believed, for example, that smoke was masculine and vapor, feminine. Color of metals was not only important to the Muslims and Alex andrians but also to the Babylonians. Gold24 was objectively described by its color in Mesopotamian lexical lists as were other metals, alloys, and minerals. In the Christian Era, color took on added meaning beyond its usage in description as an important alchemical factor. Although alloys were frequently degraded and upgraded in Babylonia, there is no evi dence that the later alchemical practices were known. THE COSMOS TO THE MUSLIMS AND BABYLONIANS For the ancient Mesopotamian, it was necessary to achieve order out of struggle with the natural elements such as the unpredictable Tigris and Euphrates, hot winds, and torrential rains. To conquer, it was necessary to organize the entire social order fully and then to face the difficulties of nature. Events in nature seemed to have an animated existence. This idea may not have loomed large to the working chemist and technologist but it was in the background of the average man's cosmos. What the ancient Mesopotamian did was to try to understand the anthropomorphic characters of physical substances and phenomena and then to cast these in the mold of social terms. Every object and substance in the universe of ancient Mesopotamia possessed some sort of will and character of its 23 M. Berthelot, "Coll. d.

Museum," London, 1896 ff., 18, 19.</page><page sequence="7">26 CHYMIA own, all of which fused into a cosmic unity. So it was with the Muslim world where it was believed that every object had life. This universal spirit, life, was the core of Muslim cosmic unity. Thus, Muslim and Mesopotamian philosophy were very similar. In Egypt, on the other hand, where life was easier, it was not imperative that one cope seriously with the forces of nature. There was a secure periodicity of the Nile and other elements, which permitted a more or less constant reiteration of the processes of living. In Mesopotamia, nature was fought as were many other difficult aspects of life. This atti tude later found its way to the spiritual heirs, the Muslims.</page></plain_text>
