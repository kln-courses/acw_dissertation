<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> What is the Place of Animals   in the Social Sciences? The Limits to the Recent Rehabilitation   of Animal Agency Dominique Guillo  Abstract. The socio-anthropological research that aims to rehabilitate the idea of animal  agency relies on a core of recurring arguments: that until recently, the social sciences  have wrongly classified animals as things, because they subscribed to the animal- machine model imposed by modernity across the boundary that it sought to draw  between nature and culture (Descola) or between humans and non-humans (Latour),  and animals in particular (animal studies). The purpose of this article is to show, first,  that this thesis is historically inaccurate. At their birth the social sciences recognized  that many animals had considerable subjectivity and established their continuity with  man. And far from being the result of a feature of modernity—and its discourse par  excellence, that of science—the success of the theme of the boundary between nature  and culture is, on the contrary, the result of a clear rejection of the hard sciences, and  particularly biology, by the social sciences of the twentieth century. This return to the  past thus helps to show that these recent rehabilitations of animal agency in fact re- vive another boundary—between the social sciences and the life sciences—and thus  maintain the old philosophical dualisms associated with it. In so doing, they close off  an avenue that promises to be particularly fruitful for documenting animal agency: a  dialogue without reciprocal reduction between the social sciences and the life sciences.

I thank the editorial board of the Revue française de sociologie for their comments and ques- tions, to which I have tried to provide answers.  1. This article only covers research conducted in the social sciences, and specifically in sociol‐ ogy and anthropology. The debates surrounding this issue in philosophy are not discussed here.  The problem of the agency of animals, as it is posed within the social sciences, is, it seems to me,  very specific for at least two reasons: the questions asked by the social sciences on this topic have  an empirical dimension and they are not normative ones—in principle—even if the answers to them  may have consequences in normative debates.

The need to accord this status to the animal is itself claimed through a series  of recurring arguments. Until recently, it is said, the social sciences have not done  justice to animals, by reducing them to the rank of things, one element amongst  others furnishing the human environment. Animals have been allocated this place,  it is argued, because until now the social sciences have been deployed in the lan‐ guage and discursive practice of Western modernity and of science—its institution  par excellence—which split the world into two parts across the boundary it draws  between nature and culture (Descola 2005) or society (Latour 1991). The social  sciences, like other scientific disciplines, and particularly ethology, are held to have  long subscribed to the Cartesian model of the animal-machine, which opened the  way to the reification of the animal. The purpose of this article is not to discuss the internal validity and the empirical  fertility of the research that uses such arguments. The contributions of some of this  work to the knowledge of the human/animal link, and to the animal more broadly,  are indisputable and very important, such as the work of D. Lawrence Wieder (1980)  or David Goode (2007).2 Nor will I challenge further here the notion that the prin‐ ciple of a radical separation between nature and culture should be abandoned: it  would be impossible nowadays –unless at the cost of shortcuts that would render  the discourse sterile –to think that animals are things separated radically and com‐ pletely from humans. The purpose of this contribution is to show, first—and after drawing up a compre‐ hensive overview of these recent rehabilitations of the animal—that the history they  recount is a highly questionable one. Initially, the animal was given a crucial role in  the nascent social sciences and recognised as having a very complex mind. Next, a  more focused investigation of the social sciences shows that it is more economical  to seek the explanation for the success of the theme of the boundary between nature  and culture by scrutinizing more closely the internal history of these disciplines,  than by considering them as terrain for the deployment of “modernity” and western  science in general, and the different boundaries that they would delineate. I will thus  attempt to show that this nature-culture boundary has been enduringly established,  especially in anthropology, not because of the effects of modernity, and the scientism  that it secretes, but against them.  2 In France, research on animals has greatly increased in recent years. The number of theses  in “Social Science, Sociology and Anthropology” on this subject has expanded considerably over  the last twenty five years: there were two theses during the 1990s, 12 in 2000 and 19 for the years  2010–2014 alone. Another 17 theses are currently in progress (survey taken from the French Central  Register of Theses). A significant proportion of these theses, and more broadly of the francophone  literature on animals, has developed mainly in the wake of the works of Bruno Latour and Philippe  Descola or at least reflects the essential lines of the “Great Divide” thesis (with variations, how‐ ever; see in particular: Isabelle Mauz [2005] Frédéric Keck [2010], Sophie Houdart and Olivier  Thiery [2011]) and Albert Piette (2002, 2012). To this broad movement can be added the work of  the historian Eric Baratay (2012) and the philosophers Vinciane Despret (2002) and Dominique  Lestel (2009). Note that a strong tradition of anthropological and ethnographic work on animals  existed in France before the recent boom, but which did not seek, however, to support the thesis of  agency nor that of a “Great Divide” (see for example the pioneering work of Noelie Vialles [1987],  or Jean-Pierre Digard [1990]). Mention should also be made of recent, innovative and empirically  rich works, by Véronique Servais (Servais, 2007, Servais and Servais, 2009) and Catherine Rémy  (2009), which are not specifically focused on the Great Divide thesis.

In the second part of this paper the deconstruction of this very widespread ac‐ count will show that much of the current rehabilitation of the animal, far from con‐ stituting a profound break in the field of the social sciences, is in fact an extension,  in a different guise, on new ground and certainly through renewed arguments of an‐ other boundary—or another Great Divide—that was traditional and well-established  throughout the 20th century in these disciplines: the boundary between the social  sciences and life sciences, and more broadly what are known as the hard sciences.3  By revisiting this boundary and the targets that typically accompany its defence,  these new perspectives on animals still quite widely maintain, despite appearances,  the dualisms that led the social sciences to sideline animals, and they conceal other  avenues that may be fruitful in exploring animal agency. The two foci of the current revival of socio-anthropo- logical research on animals The current boom in socio-anthropological research on animals actually has two  specific points of focus that fit respectively into distinct traditions and disciplinary  fields—of anthropology, on one hand, and sociology, on the other. This research  overlaps on certain points. However, it is informed by substantially different forms  of questioning, language and history. Anthropology beyond nature and culture Recent anthropological research studies on this topic generally use the same  historical diagnosis as their starting point. Of course, it is stressed, animals have not  been totally neglected by anthropology. But it has always refused, in principle, to  grant them a form of agency by studying them only insofar as they can be seen as  the basis of symbols, objects of representation, ritual instruments, or tools for action  or consumer goods; in other words, provided that they are objects available to the  human being, and in no case whatsoever subjects. Why this treatment? Because, according to these researchers, anthropology, like  other sciences, has been based since its inception on an ontology that separates hu‐ mans from other beings by introducing a sealed boundary between nature and cul‐ ture—or society.4 More precisely, this boundary had been opened up and reinforced  by a whole series of additional oppositions, which serve to strengthen that of nature   3.

This would  become the approach of classical anthropology in particular, which would thus be‐ come both directly attached to Western scientism and exemplary of this modern  ontology and the divisions it deploys (Latour, 1991; see also, Descola, 2005; Viveiros  de Castro, 2002). In sum, the discourse of science, and thus of this twentieth-century anthropol‐ ogy is that of a Centre which imposes its rule on the rest of the world through the  establishment of a “Great Divide” between ‘Them’ and ‘Us.” By so doing, the Centre  relegates to its outskirts, in concentric circles, those beings it wishes to reduce to si‐ lence and consigns the ontologies they represent to the ranks of false or inconsistent  beliefs: women, the natives, the hybrids, the animals, the post-humans, the cyborgs,  the “quasi-objects,” and the objects themselves (Haraway, 1991, 2008).6 In such a  framework, the task then for the social scientist is first of all to study this “modern”  ontology from an anthropological point of view, which would imply an anthropology  of its quintessential agents—science and technology (Latour, 1991, 2001), hence the  development of Science Studies—and at the same time to rehabilitate the ontolo‐ gies of other human societies and, more broadly, of other beings, both humans and  “non-humans.” In summary, this perspective leads to a rehabilitation of the idea of animal  agency by two routes. The first is straightforward: like all “non-humans” animals  should be subject to a treatment “symmetrical” (Latour, 1991) to that which we  usually reserve for humans, to whom intentionality is attributed immediately and  without discussion. The other is indirect: the agency of animals is recognized in  the ontologies particular to some societies, and there is no reason to place Western  “naturalist” (Descola, 2005) ontology, which denies them this agency, above these  ontologies.7 Such are the terms of the very specific argument by which the rehabilitation of  the theoretical status of the animal and the challenge to the boundary between na‐ ture and culture are justified. It is essential to note that this challenge is not reflected  here by any call for the opening up of a research field whose goal would be to try  to articulate the views developed respectively in the social and life sciences.

According to these anthropologists, the sign  of the Great Divide and of animal objectification can be seen particularly acutely  in an ethology characterised since its birth by the Cartesian model of the animal- machine and fear of the anthropomorphism which accompanies it. Yet today, these anthropologists continue, the limitations of this way of con‐ ceiving and treating the animal appear increasingly clearly. The “proliferation of  hybrids” (Latour, 1991) both natural and cultural8 within the networks woven silently  by modern societies under the veil of the ontology of the Great Divide; the evidence  of environmental disasters (Latour, 1991; Viveiros de Castro, 2002); or the facts un‐ earthed by a heterodox ethology, such as by Jane Goodall, focused less on the model  of the animal machine would eventually starkly reveal the untenable character of the  view of nature taken by the modern West, and will make it necessary to release the  animal from the ontological cage within which it has long been locked. The sociological perspective: symbolic interactionism   and ethnomethodology The second focus developed in parallel in sociology, within two perspectives that  are well established in the discipline. The first is symbolic interactionism, some of  whose proponents—notably Arnold Arluke and Clinton R. Sanders—have supported  the need to recognize a form of animal agency since the 1990s (Arluke and Sanders,  1996; Sanders, 1999). They admit, however, that it may seem incongruous initially to  treat the animal as an actor in the framework of symbolic interactionism. Indeed, it  is doubtful that animals are “able to use symbols that are shared” with humans and  “thus engage in conduct that shows they have a mind” (Arluke and Sanders, 1996,  p. 49) as had been pointed out earlier by George Herbert Mead and Herbert Blumer.  However, they do argue that, if we look closer, this kind of sceptical argument nec‐ essarily has limits within symbolic interactionism, since it is an a priori decision  on the possession or not by a being of mental faculties or more generally of a mind,  before it has been studied in those social interactions where it would be likely to  manifest itself. Yet one of the central ideas of symbolic interactionism is precisely  that of conceptualising the mind and the faculties as properties that emerge and exist  only in interactions—”the mind is a social accomplishment” (Arluke and Sanders,  1996, p. 49). On this basis, argue Arluke and Sanders, we have no greater a priori  evidence, independent of the observation of social interactions, of the existence of a  mind in man. In the one case as in the other, we can only infer the existence of men‐ tal states of participants from their crossing and mirroring manifestations during  their interactions. The fact that humans readily ascribe mental faculties to animals  in their interactions with them cannot fail to be considered in an interactionist per‐ spective, as a form of indirect manifestation of the mind of the animal, even though  there are “obvious linguistic differences between humans and animals” (Arluke and  Sanders, 1996, p. 49) that should lead to distrust of excessive anthropomorphism. In  other words, even if the outlines of this mind still await an accurate definition, these   8. Pets are included among the most salient examples of hybrid entities, as are the beings pro‐ duced by biotechnology, and those on which they have effects. 120, Revue française de sociologie, 56-1, 2015 </page> <page sequence="6"> Dominique Guillo interactional phenomena prevent us from subscribing to the animal-machine model  dear to behaviourist ethology. Alongside this work, animals have been gradually emerging since the 1980s  in another sociological perspective—ethnomethodology—that has been in constant  and close debate with symbolic interactionism on this and many other questions for  thirty years or more. In a widely cited study, D.L. Wieder (1980), in particular, has  shown that those responsible for caring for chimpanzees in a laboratory develop rou‐ tines in which they treat them as beings endowed with a mind, an attitude which con‐ trasts with the behaviourist discourse of these same actors when they are accounting  for the behaviour of monkeys in their scientific studies. In a similar perspective we  find the work of Vicki Hearne (1987) on the language games played by humans with  their pets, and later, that of Eileen Crist (1996) on the anthropomorphism that etholo‐ gists cannot help themselves from using in their descriptions of animal behaviour.  More recently, the work of David Goode (2007) on his games with his dog Katie  has helped to lend greater legitimacy to the study of animals in ethnomethodology.  In particular Goode argues that ethnomethodology has in principle far less difficulty  in recognizing a form of animal agency than symbolic interactionism. Indeed he  emphasizes that ethnomethodologists do not consider that “shared understanding  of symbols” or “the ability of participants to make a valid comprehension of the  perspective of the Other” are necessary conditions of interaction (2007, p. 143). For  the ethnomethodological position is precisely to suspend any account of the mental  abilities that a being should have in order to enter into genuine social interaction.  In this perspective, mental phenomena are described only insofar as they are ac‐ countable here and now, in a situated way, in the ordered course of their production  during interactions. One may well recognize that animals—such as dogs in this  circumstance—have a complex “agency” or “cognition.” But these expressions do  not mean in this case faculties or mental properties, such as would be ascribed to  individuals outside of interactions by cognitivists, or only during the course of their  accomplishment by symbolic interactionists. For in the ethnomethodological per‐ spective, the “mind”—or the “mental”—including among humans, is not something  that one either has or does not have.9 Animals are thus potential actors not because  they may have a mind or a particular mental faculty, but simply because some of  them are clearly engaging with human beings in ordered joint activities through  which they make themselves accountable, in a contingent and situated manner, as  intentional beings. Above and beyond what divides them, these different sociological research tradi‐ tions on animals—interactionist and ethnomethodological—have a significant com‐ mon position, which should be emphasized in this investigation. In both cases, the  animal question is actually a new area of concern for a traditionally central thesis of  both perspectives, even though each has interpreted it in its own way. This issue is,  in simple terms, the defence of a holistic, external and social conception of the phe‐ nomena of the mind, against the individualistic conception specific to behaviourists  and, more recently, to cognitivists, in other words against the dominant conceptions   9. Picking up an argument inspired by Wittgenstein that is classic in ethnomethodology, Goode  writes: “Neither dogs nor people ‘have’ minds. Nor from my data can they be said to observably  produce ‘mind’ as an interactional accomplishment. I can show you a good move. I can show you  a game. I can even find ‘lively inner states’ of Others in play. But I cannot show a mind playing.”  (2007, p. 122)  Revue française de sociologie, 56-1, 2015, 121 </page> <page sequence="7"> What is the Place of Animals in the Social Sciences? in “hard science.”10 According to this holistic conception, action is seen as rooted  not in the individual—whether considered as either the possessor of a mind or as a  form of mechanical organization—but in the extra-individual products of collective  life, which give the actions their meanings.11 From this point of view, the position  of the sociologists described in this section—who represent a minority within their  own perspectives, it should be emphasized—is to extend this type of argument (that  is usually reserved for humans) to animals; in other words to take the criticism of  behaviourism and cognitivism into a terrain that has long been the preserve of these  two paradigms, where beasts appear in an a priori manner to be the concern of the  natural sciences rather than the social sciences. Overall, what is at stake and continues to be so in this renewed interest in ani‐ mals in sociology—as it does in anthropology, albeit in a somewhat different way—is  not the simple revision of an oversight, or the opening of a field of research that  has been neglected. It is rather the deployment on new ground and through revised  justifications, of a conception of the mind, of the individual and of society explicitly  opposed to conceptions that exist in the hard sciences or derive from them—particu‐ larly in evolutionary biology, cognitive science, cognitive anthropology and ethology,  and developmental psychology—that are usually described as part of “naturalism.”  Therefore the opening is narrower than it appears at first; and the break with tra‐ ditional sociology much less pronounced: the critique of the hard sciences remains  in this case an important focus of research. Symptomatically, these studies almost  inevitably share references to the Great Divide thesis as well as that of the bound‐ ary between nature and culture, such as they are used in anthropology.12 There is  also a radical critique of the experimental method, the defence of a reasoned form  of anthropomorphism turned explicitly against the attitude of ethologists who are  deemed to be excessively deflationary about the attribution of intentionality. Finally,  there is a dismissive attitude towards the large amount of research conducted over  the last thirty years in various branches of the hard sciences, not merely in ethol‐ ogy, but also in evolutionary biology, population biology and systematics. With the  exception of references to some big names, such as Amotz Zahavi, this research is  almost never cited in bibliographies. These remarks do not, of course, question the undeniable relevance and empiri‐ cal fertility of some of these sociological studies. Moreover, the indifference to other  disciplines is even more widely shared by the hard sciences, which, in turn, make  little or no reference to the work on animals in the social sciences. What we need  simply to note is that the content of the bibliographies attests to the fact that the  social sciences intend to develop a different if not opposing perspective to that of  the natural sciences.  10. In simple terms, one can say that symbolic can use the mentalist vocabulary to describe  interactionism and ethnomethodology reject actions, but only if it is respecified — at least  the mentalism of cognitivists, in other words among the ethnomethodologists — in such a  the idea that one can explain actions by individ- way that it designates not merely the “inter‐ ual internal mental states—such as represen‐ nal” states of the actors but phenomena which  tations, desires, beliefs or intentions—having a only have a public and collective existence in  prior existence to interactions.

A thesis open to several interpretations This is thus a broad-brush outline of the studies that currently aim to rehabilitate  the animal in the social sciences. In what follows, I propose, first, to examine and  discuss the historical narrative of the “Great Divide,”13 as mentioned above, which  will enable me to reconstruct, second, the real reasons for the neglect of animals  in the social sciences in the twentieth century and their implications for research. The idea that the principle of a boundary between nature and culture or “natu‐ ralistic ontology” (Descola, 2005) should be constitutive of “modernity” certainly  has different meanings within the nucleus of the range of work that refers to it. As  with all such great oppositions of this type, the question is not so much whether it  is true or false in general—as it clearly has various meanings in the literature and,  at a certain degree of generality, such oppositions have such a vast content that they  can hardly be denied—but to determine the various specific meanings it may have,  in order to be able then to examine each of them with sufficient precision. It hardly seems reasonable, at first sight, to accept the hypothesis of a Great  Divide, if it means that a body of work like that of Descartes, through the theme of  the animal-machine, or that of another philosopher such as Hobbes for example, are  among the major direct sources of the discourses and practices of the modern West  as a whole with respect to animals. One may indeed doubt that a philosophical work,  whatever its importance and strength, could have such an influence, surpassing that  of economic, political, social and cultural factors. A more plausible interpretation of this hypothesis would be to consider that  these works are not the causes but the symptoms of the attitudes of modern Western  societies towards animals and, more generally, towards living beings. This thesis,  however, raises a major difficulty. It is doubtful that such a vast and multifaceted  world as the modern West would display such a monolithic and clearly defined at‐ titude in all its geographical as well as social regions, towards as general a subject as  the relationship to living nature. When we consider the issue from the perspective of  rigorous historical sociology, difficulties arise: what is there in common between an  industrial slaughter-house of the twentieth century, a small farm in the 1960s with  its few head of cattle, Flaubert seeing cows grazing on his trip to Brittany, a fisher‐ man from the same time mechanically throwing his fish in his boat, a tame bear in a  circus, Montaigne who recognized that animals have a mind almost as refined as our  own, Claude Bernard conducting experiments involving vivisection, those who put  forward the Gramont law in France in the nineteenth century, aimed at condemning  violence against animals, and Konrad Lorenz who swam with his geese? It is diffi‐ cult to discern here a common relationship with living beings, which would distance  all these people equally and with the same force, from the “ontologies” belonging to  other human societies. Difficult, too, to argue that those who treated animals other  than as things were a minority in the West for four centuries, either as heretics or as  mere vestiges of a pre-modern past.  13. I will describe as the “Great Divide” the common doctrinal nucleus of various recent reha‐ bilitations of the animal in anthropology discussed above. Within this usage the meaning may vary  significantly, with Latour’s version being only one among many others. Revue française de sociologie, 56-1, 2015, 123 </page> <page sequence="9"> What is the Place of Animals in the Social Sciences? For this thesis to be consistent, we must impose some additional restrictive as‐ sumptions, which would allow it to account for obvious observable differences in  relation to the nature of “modern western people.” First, we must consider that the  “naturalistic ontology” or the “modern constitution” does not consist of standards or  values that can impose themselves automatically on all Western people and dictate  their beliefs and behaviours in all circumstances. The significance of this ontology  for individuals must necessarily be more refracted and weaker: it must order beliefs  and actual practices in a relatively labile and loose way, opening up the possibility  of historically and spatially contingent variations.14 Second, and more importantly,  it can only be valid for certain aspects of society, those representing modernity par  excellence and which are its driving forces, particularly science and technology.15 Have the life-sciences ever ratified the “modern constitution”? However, this argument also raises a number of significant issues, especially  when it appears to posit the existence of a dominant discourse or perspective in the  so-called hard sciences, and especially in the life sciences. The idea of  a separa‐ tion between nature and culture may even seem to be singularly absent from them.  Indeed, for many decades, these disciplines were undoubtedly dominated by a gen‐ erally reductionist epistemology, i.e. by an epistemology which aims to erase all  boundaries between phenomenal levels. This is true not only of physiology and  evolutionary biology, which have been increasingly rooted in molecular biology, but  also of human psychology, through the development of neuroscience. More impor‐ tantly for the present subject, the life sciences regularly generate a deeply reduction‐ ist discourse about society and human culture: in sociobiology (Wilson, 1975), and  most recently in behavioural ecology and evolutionary psychology (Pinker, 2002).  Far from defending the existence of any boundary, these dominant perspectives in  their specialty aim to forge a naturalistic explanation of sociocultural phenomena.  Thus they explicitly reject the dualism between nature and culture to which the so‐ cial sciences remain attached, according to them, through ideology or disciplinary  corporatism (Pinker, 2002). It should be noted that the same applies to behaviourism, and more broadly the  model of the animal machine. These two paradigms certainly reduce the animal to  a form of mechanical arrangement. But what they forget to mention in the socio- anthropological literature on animals today, is that they do exactly the same for hu‐ mans. In behaviourism, in other words, the reification of the animal occurs in ways  that are not by any means the same oppositions that are constitutive of the Great  Divide: culture/nature, human/animal, mind/matter, subject/object. On the contrary,   14. That is why Descola refers to the exis‐ [2005, p. 130]). By introducing at the visible  tence of “patterns of practice” (2005, part 2, and audible surface of things a Constitution  chap. 4). deploying a Great Divide, modernity has thus   15. Another way to solve the problem of the allowed a silent growth, unprecedented in hu‐ diversity of practices and discourses observ‐ manity, of hybrid beings and practices that mix  able in the West with regard to nature is to nature and culture. Modernity might even be  consider, as does Latour, that in reality “we this double movement of “purification” on one  have never been modern”: the “moderns” would side, and “translation” on the other ( Latour  not say what they do and would not do what [1991, pp. 20–1, p. 69]). On the difficulties  they say (Latour [1991], as quoted by Descola raised by this argument, see note 21. 124, Revue française de sociologie, 56-1, 2015 </page> <page sequence="10"> Dominique Guillo this is done within a monistic and reductionist framework in which all these distinc‐ tions disappear. Should we see the current dominance of this reductionism in the hard sciences  as a symptom of a crisis of “modernity,” which, in a final attempt to save the dis‐ tinction between nature/culture—undermined by the proliferation of “hybrids”—will  maintain the polarity by reducing one term to another, in this case culture to nature,  as argued by Latour (1991)? But the attempts to explain psychological and cultural  phenomena in a reductionist manner are far from recent in the hard sciences. We  can even say that it has been a permanent temptation for at least two centuries, from  Buffon’s call for a histoire naturelle de l’homme, institutionalized by Armand de  Quatrefages and Paul Broca in the middle of the nineteenth century (Blanckaert,  1989; Guillo, 2003) right up to the current cognitivism, via phrenology, the vari‐ ous forms of social Darwinism that bloomed in the late nineteenth century, and  behaviourism. In reality, this perspective has always been very widely dominant. So  much so that it is very difficult to find scholars who have defended the principle of a  boundary between nature and culture in the history of the hard sciences, and, more  importantly, have intensified this opposition using the different pairs of concepts  discussed in the thesis of the Great Divide. The emergent social sciences:   a return to their conceptual foundations Let us sharpen the focus now, to return as closely as possible to the question  before us: if the thesis of the Great Divide seems difficult to reconcile with what the  history of the life sciences shows us, is it better validated by the history of the social  sciences, and does it allow us to explain the ways in which animals were treated  in these disciplines before their recent rehabilitation? To answer this question, it is  instructive to revisit the nineteenth century. As we know, a very important section  of the social sciences emerged during this period, in close collaboration with biol‐ ogy, particularly through works such as those of Auguste Comte (1998) and Herbert  Spencer (1876 –1896 [1873] 1903), whose impact was considerable at that time. But  we cannot simply accept this at face value. To understand the meaning of this link it  is necessary to accurately identify the biological paradigms prevailing at that time,  and which formed the conceptual basis of the nascent social sciences. At the risk of oversimplifying what is a complex history, it can be shown that a  large part of these socio-anthropological doctrines develop from a cosmology or, in  other terms, a very specific ontology (Guillo, 2003). This cosmology came initially  from the discipline that dominated the life sciences up to the middle of the nine‐ teenth century—comparative anatomy (Balan, 1979). It is based on three essential  conceptual schemes that can ultimately be understood as each depending on the  other during this period: organization, serial classification and development. Living  things are considered, first of all, fundamentally, as beings endowed with an organi- zation (Daudin, 1926–1927; Foucault, 1966: pp. 275–92, Balan, 1979). Moreover,  they can themselves be classified into a linear and ascending series crowned by man  and graded according to the degree of complexity of this organization. Finally, the  serial classification of living things displays a succession of organized forms which  are all seen as steps in their development: that of the embryo, but also for transform‐ ist (transmutationist) biologists, who were increasingly prevalent from the 1830s, that  of all the species as a whole since the most ancient times (Guillo, 2003). From the  Revue française de sociologie, 56-1, 2015, 125 </page> <page sequence="11"> What is the Place of Animals in the Social Sciences? beginning of the nineteenth century, this conceptual triptych is thus applied very  directly to man, the last element of this long series, within the heart of this compara‐ tive anatomy. Thus, in this conception of life so strongly influenced by the ladder  of nature (Mayr, 2001; Gayon, 1992), an “anthropology” became institutionalized in  the middle of the century (Blanckaert, 1989; Bernardini, 1997), under the impulse of  naturalists themselves, whose subject was quite specifically the final section of the  “zoological series”: the human being. More specifically, this “anthropology” made  the different human “races” into its subject, which had to be classified, again in an  ascending series, and graded according to the degree of the supposed complexity of  the organization of the body and the faculties, and dominated by what was consid‐ ered to be a superior “organized form”—the men of the higher classes of Western  societies (Guillo, 2003; Bernardini, 1997). Beyond individual differences between these scientists, this is the general con‐ ceptual framework in which were developed the most striking works of the com‐ parative anatomy of that time and which dominated the life sciences (Balan, 1979),  and whose echoes are even heard in the literature of the age.16 In this comparative  anatomy, the conceptual triptych is raised to such a high degree of generality in some  works that it suggests, from the first third of the century, many similarities with the  subjects of other disciplines. Through such analogies the body is described as a so‐ ciety, as illustrated by the theory of the “physiological division of labour” developed  by the naturalist Henri Milne-Edwards (1851) in the 1820s, which profoundly influ‐ enced Spencer and Durkheim (Guillo 2003, Vatin, 2005). Then, in return, society  itself is described as an organism, from Comte and Spencer to the organicists of the  late nineteenth century. Thus, throughout the century, in the works of these naturalists and also those of  physicians, philosophers and sociologists, as well as in their analogical exchanges,  a common field of thought can be seen gradually emerging, which can be described  as a generalized logic of organization (Guillo, 2003), which extends to all levels of  phenomena the three central themes of comparative anatomy: organization, clas‐ sification by series and development. This generalized logic of organization can  be summarized as follows. By combining together, the “animal organizations”—in  other words individual animals—formed in some species, including humans, social  organizations. As a result of these combinations, the “zoological series” therefore  progressed directly, becoming more complex, into a “social series” of which it is a  “natural” extension. In total, all the aggregates that make up the world can be clas- sified in a huge linear and ascending series graduated according to the complexity  of their internal organization, from the simplest—physico-chemical aggregates—to  the most complex—modern Western societies, where the division of labour has been  pushed further than in all other societies. The “primitive” human societies, whose  morphology was judged to be the simplest, and least differentiated, are considered  in this framework as adjacent to the higher animal societies. And for those who  adhere to transmutationism, which was dominant in the social sciences from the  1870s under the influence of Spencer, the subdivisions of this long chain indicate the  path of development to which the whole world has been subject from the beginning  (Spencer, 1876–1896 [1873] 1903). In general terms then, throughout the nineteenth   16. Goethe, for example, transcribed in 1830 the famous controversy between Cuvier and Geof‐ froy Saint-Hilaire—the “Querelle des analogues”—that enthused all of intellectual Europe.

Within this series there are certainly discontinui‐ ties, and degrees. But those only occur on the surface of a continuously and regularly  graduated progression. Social sciences that attribute strong subjectivity   to many animals As this article now attempts to show, the content of this cosmology confirms that  the Great Divide thesis has little relevance for the emerging social sciences and that  the historical picture drawn more specifically by this thesis concerning the treatment  of animals in these disciplines is incorrect. Firstly, all of the sociologists discussed above reject forcefully and very ex- plicitly the division between nature and culture, and society, between the realm of  things and that of human affairs. They criticize particularly strongly and explicitly  philosophies of contract, including those of Hobbes and Rousseau.17 Moreover these  critiques are neither fortuitous nor ambiguous. For the purpose of these sociologists  is first and foremost to convince their audience that there is a social science, i.e. that  social facts are as “natural” as physical or biological facts, and that they “should  be considered as things,” according to Durkheim’s famous expression (Durkheim  [1893] 1986).  But there are more important questions for our subject here. Contrary to a belief  now popular in the social sciences, all these thinkers not only establish a continuity  between humans and animals, but also recognize that they have subjectivity and  that some of them have a highly complex mind. On this point, it is essential to em‐ phasize forcefully that the philosophers, sociologists and anthropologists of the 19th  century who attribute higher faculties to animals or who refuse to separate nature  and culture are in no way “rebel spirits,” as suggested by Descola (2005, p. 129) con‐ cerning Ernst Haeckel, or isolated thinkers who were launching, like Alfred Espinas,  a “challenge to the scientific order” (Feuerhahn, 2011) of their time. In fact, all these  thinkers, from Comte to Durkheim via Spencer and the physical anthropologists, ac‐ cord a “mental” or “psychic” life to animals. To take a few examples, Espinas argues  that the phenomena of “consciousness” exist not only in mammals but also in the  most basic animals, such as the “annelids” (Espinas, 1888, p. 12). He also recognizes  that the higher animals have a “rudimentary morality” (Espinas, 1878, p. 549). But  he is far from an isolated example. Moreover, he is far from being the most radical  thinker on this question. Thus, Louis Agassiz, a renowned naturalist and a widely re‐ spected scientific figure, argues for his part that “the gradation of moral faculties in  the higher animals and in man is so imperceptible that in order to deny to the former  a sense of responsibility and consciousness, the difference between them and man  must be exaggerated beyond measure” (Agassiz, De l’espèce et de la classification   17. See the criticisms of social contract theories in De la division du travail social (Durkheim,  [1893] 1986, p. 179), or the arguments of Espinas against Hobbes, for whom society, an “artificial  mechanism,” is a “dead thing, which is real only in [his] mind” (Espinas, 1878, p. 31). Revue française de sociologie, 56-1, 2015, 127 </page> <page sequence="13"> What is the Place of Animals in the Social Sciences? en zoologie, p. 90, quoted in A. Espinas, 1878, p. 548). Another example is Charles  Letourneau, one of the leaders of naturalist anthropology in the last third of the  century in France, who thought that “the human faculties are found in animals, only  weaker, sometimes rudimentary, but of essentially the same nature” (Letourneau,  1865, p. 585). He even aims to show that “religious psychological phenomena are  not of a separate order, they simply relate to the properties and cerebral faculties  common to man and the higher animals [...], that religious beliefs result simply from  moral and intellectual acts, that are common, with differences of degree, to all be‐ ings occupying a high rank in the animal series” (Letourneau, 1865, p. 586).18 Many more examples of this kind could be given. Far from being iconoclastic,  the idea of a  continuity between man and the higher animals, and that of com- plex animal faculties, are embraced by men of letters and science who then domi- nate their institutions, from Quatrefages, Broca and Letourneau to Comte, Spencer,  Espinas, Durkheim or René Worms. And here again this is not accidental. The key  point here is that the idea is the necessary consequence of the field of thought within  which these nascent social sciences were emerging. Certainly, the vast majority of  these thinkers, if not all, also highlight the existence of differences between humans  and other species. These differences may be more or less pronounced according to  the authors. Animals, for example, as Durkheim declared in a famous text writ‐ ten at the end of his life ([1917] 1975), are governed from within, by their instinct,  whereas human beings are mainly governed from the outside, by institutions. Comte  meanwhile granted, as we know, a special importance to Humanity, from his Cours  de philosophie positive onwards ([1830–1842] 1998).19 However, it would be an er‐ ror of interpretation to remove the differences highlighted by these authors from  their conceptual framework, so as to classify them amongst the doctrines that trace  a boundary between humans and animals through a fundamental division between  nature and culture. For in all these discourses of the nineteenth century, these dif‐ ferences are considered secondary rather than primary ones, in the general economy  that links the biological, the social and the cultural. They are always seen against  the background of a unanimously shared conceptual field, as noted above, that often  explicitly challenges—against the “spiritualists” and in the name of science—the  existence of an ontological boundary between nature and culture, through recogni‐ tion of the principle of the long, continuous and upward “series” of organized bodies.  Indeed, in such a cosmology, the order of things that make up the world cannot be  based on dichotomies, deep discontinuities or oppositions. The differences never  separate essences in a binary partition, such as nature and culture or matter and  spirit: they always appear as regular degrees in a progression. “Shades, degrees  and no major differences,” in the words of C. Letourneau (1865, p. 589), that the  echo of which can also be found in the work of all of these thinkers. In summary,  man in general displays differences from the animal in general. But here there is   18. Certainly, the sociologists and anthro‐ Perrier, via Louis Agassiz. These naturalists  pologists who deployed their views in this field are then extensively taken up by sociologists,  of thought did not themselves perform any in‐ as illustrated for example by the work of Ed‐ vestigations into animal sociability and facul‐ mond Perrier on animal colonies, widely used  ties. Such research was carried out, however, by Durkheim ([1893] 1986). at this time by naturalists, whose works on this  19. However, it would also seem that Comte  subject are very plentiful, as illustrated by the considered some dogs, that were helpful to  work of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck to Edmond man, as part of what he called “Humanity.” 128, Revue française de sociologie, 56-1, 2015 </page> <page sequence="14"> Dominique Guillo no boundary: the lower human types are close to higher animals in the zoological  series of animal types; and the complex animal societies are close to “primitive”  human societies. An “analogical ontology”? Overall, if one is determined to see in this an “ontology” as defined by Descola,  it is not a “naturalistic ontology” that emerges but something that Descola himself  calls an “analogical ontology” (2005). In the “analogical ontology,” the graduated  differences that the “interiority” of beings present (ibid., p. 168) or, if you will, their  psychic life, are strongly correlated with differences in the properties of their physi‐ cal envelope. Furthermore, in this ontology, as its name suggests, analogy plays a  crucial role as does serial progress, as evidenced by one of the major examples of  this kind of ontology referred to by Descola: the “great chain of being” mentioned  by Arthur Lovejoy (Descola, 2005, p. 282). Yet these are precisely the themes that  are found in the works of the thinkers of the nineteenth century evoked above. In the  linear and ascending series of beings they use, the distribution of mental properties  is an exact parallel to that of physical properties: the morphological complexity that  emerges in this series is necessarily accompanied by a complexity of functions, from  the simplest to the highest—in other terms the psychological functions. Moreover, as  we have seen, this organized order that repeats itself at various levels of phenomenal  complexity—physical, biological, social—cannot fail to suggest certain analogies  which were flourishing at this time. As noted, such an ontology, or rather such a field of concepts, to use a term less  bound to a particular anthropological paradigm, does not rule out the possibility of  certain discontinuities that are more or less accentuated depending on the writer.  But these discontinuities always emerge at the surface of this continuously gradu‐ ated linear and ascending series. What makes it difficult for present day observers  of this issue to see is that the arguments developed by these thinkers around such  discontinuities have only superficial similarities with those which were used during  the twentieth century to support the dualism between nature and culture and the hu‐ man/animal boundary. Indeed, these arguments take on a very different meaning in  the nineteenth century, when one considers them within the context of the concep‐ tual framework of these thinkers. This is the case in particular of the discontinuity  introduced by Durkheim between social facts and biological facts—and psychologi‐ cal facts. For Durkheim, the discontinuity between the biological and the social  does not come down to a fundamental separation between “nature” and “culture,”  since in his eyes all phenomena are “natural”: this discontinuity is, quite explicitly,  epistemological and not ontological. Similarly, in his eyes, the division between bi‐ ology and sociology does not generate a radical separation between animal and  man. On the one hand, animals exhibit social phenomena. And, secondly, biological  phenomena play an important role in the forming of individual human tendencies  and representations, especially in primitive societies.20 The meaning of the break  between nature/culture, such as it appears in the twentieth century, is very different.   20. This point, crucial for Durkheim, is in no way in contradiction, in his work, with the principle  of the autonomy of sociology vis-à-vis biology. On all these points in Durkheim, see Guillo (2006). Revue française de sociologie, 56-1, 2015, 129 </page> <page sequence="15"> What is the Place of Animals in the Social Sciences? This break no longer refers to differences that are superficial and underlined by a  scalar and gradualist ontology; it becomes the very foundation of a new ontology,  or, in other words, a new field of concepts. In summary, for all these reasons, the claim that the social sciences have ex‐ cluded animals since their foundation because of the influence of a Great Divide  ontology based on the principle of a boundary between nature and culture, or be‐ tween humans and non-humans, appears doubly inaccurate: firstly, because these  disciplines initially developed an “analogical” and not a “naturalistic” “ontology”;  secondly, because they then allowed ample space for animals, and tried to fill the  gap that separates them from man.21 In pursuing this critical analysis of the Great Divide thesis, my aim is not at all  to deny that the dualism nature/culture largely structures and dominates the contem‐ porary field of debates and exchanges between the life sciences and the social sci‐ ences, especially through the controversies between extreme forms of naturalism and  culturalism. It is also indisputable that, until recently, animals were excluded from  the social sciences because of this opposition. What this article seeks to challenge  here is the relevance of the contention that the social sciences, from their beginnings,  have rejected animals, and have done so under the influence of an ontology specific  to modernity—and especially to science in general, of which the hard sciences are  the archetype—which infuses the notion of a boundary. Where does the exclusion of animals in social science  in the twentieth century come from? But if the thesis of a Great Divide does not apply to the social sciences, where  does the undeniable exclusion of animals as subjects in these disciplines in the twen‐ tieth century come from? Where does the influence of the opposition between nature  and culture, which effectively led social science to confine animals, for decades, to  the category of things, far away from Man, derive from? We would argue here that  the simplest approach is to seek the answers to these questions in the history of the  social sciences themselves. To demonstrate this, I will discuss the two disciplinary  fields in which animals have been rehabilitated today.  21. One could at this point still try to save the idea of  a Great Divide by claiming, as was men‐ tioned above, that the nature/culture opposition should not be conceived as a position defended as  such by a majority of thinkers or by a discipline, but as an underlying polarity in the intellectual  field, with a continuous gradation of nuanced positions between two opposite extremes: on the one  hand, the “naturalism,” dominant in the life sciences and, on the other, the “culturalism” dominant  in the social sciences (Descola [2005 part. 1, chap. 3, Latour [1991]). However, in such an intel‐ lectual space, the explicit defence of the “boundary” becomes a discourse among many others, and  has every chance of being very much in the minority. Therefore, if this is indeed the meaning of  this ontology—or of this Great Divide—, it cannot be regarded as a dominant area of discourse, or  a “Constitution” of modernity, casting a veil over the proliferation of “hybrids.” And one cannot  claim, therefore, as does Latour, and following him Descola, that the moderns “do not do what they  say and do not say what they do,” because the nature/culture opposition here is no longer constitu‐ tive of their explicit discourse—”what they say,”—but of its conceptual base, which remains as such  implicit and unspoken. 130, Revue française de sociologie, 56-1, 2015 </page> <page sequence="16"> Dominique Guillo An internal evolution within anthropology rather than a break  Although it was absent, as we have seen, from the social sciences in the nine‐ teenth century, by contrast the theme of an opposition or a boundary between na‐ ture and culture appears and spreads forcefully within anthropology throughout the  twentieth century, in different perspectives, especially culturalism in the broadest  sense (initially that of Franz Boas, and later in the form that appears in the second  half of the century, in the work of Margaret Mead, Ralph Linton and Marshall  Sahlins), functionalism (in the work of Bronislaw Malinowski and Alfred Radcliffe- Brown) and structuralism (Claude Lévi-Strauss). Beyond the important differences  between these works, the strong distinction between, on the one hand, culture un‐ derstood as the reign of the diversity of symbols, or representations or practices  and, on the other, nature, considered as the reign of the universality of the material  conditions that make possible this diversity, runs through each of them in its own  way. And one can say that from the mid-century, this distinction takes over in the  discipline as one of its basic principles. Present in most anthropology textbooks un‐ til today,22 it is readily seen as a central but at the same time obvious formula, that  shapes the contours of the discipline by giving it full autonomy from biology through  the division of scientific work that it establishes: nature being the property of the  life sciences, and culture that of the social sciences. This is the central point: in the  anthropology of the second half of the twentieth century, the boundary between  nature and culture forcefully establishes itself insofar as it is seen as an argument  for erasing any involvement of biological phenomena in the explanation of social  and cultural phenomena. This type of argument is quite explicit, for example, in a work that has greatly  contributed to the success of this dualism: The Elementary Structures of Kinship  (Lévi-Strauss, 1967), especially Chapter 1 and the preface to the second edition. In  this book, Lévi-Strauss justifies Nature/Culture dualism through an argumentation  aiming to show that culture escapes the biological determinism of the life sciences:  “Culture,” he says, “is neither simply juxtaposed to nor simply superimposed on life.  In one sense, it replaces life, in another sense, it uses it and transforms it to create a  synthesis of a new order” (ibid., p. 4). Even more interestingly for the topic that con‐ cerns us here, a few pages later he draws a boundary between man and animal, that  he derives from the dualism between nature and culture: “the opposition between  human behaviour and animal behaviour [...] provides the most striking illustration of  the antinomy of culture and nature” (ibid., p. 6). As we can see, the exclusion of the  animal from the field of social science is here intimately associated with arguments  which seek to exclude biological determinism from the field of the science of culture,  in other words that of anthropology.23 What was it that brought anthropology to introduce such a radical break with  biology? This complex story cannot be easily summarized in a few lines, and this  article will confine itself to making hypotheses. However, it is indisputable that one  of its origins or its major inspirations can be found in a goal that is almost constantly   22. See the comments of François Héran pp. 44, 50), and, more broadly, by many anthro‐ (2007) on Descola. pologists from the second half of the twentieth   23. There are similar arguments, for example, century (on this, see Melford Spiro [1987]). in the work of Margaret Mead on gender (1948,  Introduction), in those of Clifford Geertz (1973,  Revue française de sociologie, 56-1, 2015, 131 </page> <page sequence="17"> What is the Place of Animals in the Social Sciences? referred to by those who invoke it: the desire to make a radical break with the rac‐ ist, sexist, eugenic and, more broadly, discriminatory discourses on man, society  and culture, foremost among them the “anthropology” of the nineteenth century  mentioned above which specifically relied on biology to give the appearance of  a scientific basis for anti-egalitarian and in some cases genocidal doctrines. In a  context marked by the horrors perpetrated by the Nazis in the name of a “natural  hierarchy” of “races,” by the awareness of the abuses of colonization, by the discov‐ ery of the eugenic policies of some Western states and more generally, by the desire  to combat different forms of discrimination, the criticism of Western scientism and  its excesses led twentieth century anthropology to widen the gap between nature  and culture—probably to a point that had never been achieved before in the Western  intellectual world.24 One fact confirms that this is indeed the foundation of the empire of the bound‐ ary between nature and culture in anthropology: this boundary was never so strongly  invoked as when some biologists openly called for the need to get rid of it, as was  the case, for example, during the long and lively controversy over sociobiology in  the 1970s and 1980s. In a famous book, which is undoubtedly one of the most cited  when referring to this controversy, Marshall Sahlins proposed a significant argument  against the sociobiologists: “Thus, while the human world depends on the senses,  and the whole panoply of organic characteristics supplied by biological evolution,  its freedom from biology consists in just the capacity to give these their own sense.  In the symbolic event, a radical discontinuity is introduced between culture and  nature” (1976, pp. 12–3).  Such examples could be multiplied in anthropology in recent decades: the  boundary between nature and culture is almost always seen by those who defend it  as an argument for criticizing the attempts to reduce sociocultural facts to biologi‐ cal phenomena, and the social sciences to the life sciences. In other words, in this  anthropology, the affirmation of the boundary is never used to defend “modernity”  and “science.” It is used on the contrary to strongly criticize the discourse on man  and society produced by the hard sciences through biology. It is quite true that by  erecting such a boundary, this anthropology has excluded animals from the field  of culture. But it was done in order to put all human beings on an equal footing,25  against the anthropology of the nineteenth century that had been shackled to the life  sciences, which had depreciated part of humanity by continuously placing it closer to  the animals, through the intermediary figure of the “savage” or “native.” Hence the paradox and, to a certain degree, the irony of the history of anthro‐ pology on this issue, a paradox disguised by the Great Divide thesis. These are the  same general arguments, or at least the same critical perspectives, which are respon‐ sible for excluding animals from anthropology throughout the twentieth century, and  for their rehabilitation in recent decades.

It can also be said that from this point of view, the new an‐ thropology of nature, based on the Great Divide thesis, directly extends the cultural‐ ist anthropology of the second half of the twentieth century—or at least that which is  based on the nature/culture distinction—beyond what separates them. To begin with,  in fact, this culturalist anthropology has—as was pointed out earlier—autonomised  the field of culture by separating it from nature, thus removing the reference to biol‐ ogy from the domain of the social sciences. This separation was achieved initially  by a tenuous thread—usually the symbolic faculty, as illustrated by the quote from  Sahlins—which made it possible to justify the autonomy of culture by anchoring it  within a natural process—the one that led humans to acquire this faculty. But this  thread could not last for long. Because from the moment we consider that the prod‐ ucts of the mind are symbolic entities that make sense only within a culture, we can  hardly avoid, sooner or later, applying to this anthropological stance the approach it  takes towards other cultures (Latour 1983, 2001); in other words to carry out an an‐ thropological analysis of this perspective that divides the world into two sets, nature  and culture. Through this turning back on itself, anthropology moved backwards  ontologically to some extent and reduced the fundamental distinctions of cultural‐ ist anthropology to the same level as the other forms of ontology. This change in  perspective had of course some very important effects, foremost among them being  the recognition of agency among “non-humans” and therefore among animals. But  this challenge to the boundary between nature and culture is part and parcel—as we  can see—of a direct extension of the same movement that had installed this powerful  opposition within anthropology for half a century. Sociology: the persistence of the dualism between   the human sciences and the natural sciences As has been noted, the rehabilitation of the animal has appeared in particular  areas of sociology in recent years within two broad perspectives—symbolic interac‐ tionism and ethnomethodology. One of the main features of these two perspectives  is a critique of the hard sciences, but concerning a different issue to that targeted  by anthropology: the nature of mental phenomena. To simplify, these perspectives,  as has been pointed out, propose to refute the individualistic conceptions of the  mind—mainly behaviourism and cognitivism—dominant in those disciplines related  to the hard sciences, and more specifically the life sciences: neuroscience, cognitive  science, psychology, ethology. From this point of view, these sociologists explicitly  inscribed their work in the wake of a long tradition, which took shape in the late  nineteenth century in the heart of the debate surrounding the distinction between the  natural sciences and the sciences of the mind, particularly in the work of Wilhelm  Dilthey and Heinrich Rickert.26  26. The antiquity of these arguments is such that their emergence and success cannot be explained  by the contextual elements we have discussed concerning the changes taking place in anthropology  in the twentieth century. Revue française de sociologie, 56-1, 2015, 133 </page> <page sequence="19"> What is the Place of Animals in the Social Sciences? It would not be helpful to the question that concerns us here to detail the his‐ tory and content of this vast tradition, which embraces moreover, some very varied  theses. What is important to emphasize is that its representatives share the general  view that mental phenomena require a radically different epistemology to that which  applies to the phenomena of nature. Through references to the phenomenology of  Alfred Schütz, the American pragmatists or to Ludwig Wittgenstein, these authors  are concerned to justify the autonomy of social facts and, more broadly, of the phe‐ nomena of the mind, based on a series of dualisms which vary in their expression  but are always affirmed forcefully: explanation/interpretation among the heirs of  phenomenology, causes/reasons for the Wittgensteinians, physical movement/action  for some pragmatists, fact/concept for some ethnomethodologists, or positive/norma‐ tive, individualism/holism, physical fact/social grammar. Beyond their differences,  these dualisms all concur that there is a boundary between the phenomena of in‐ animate nature on the one hand, and the phenomena of the mind on the other hand,  and that the latter can only be captured, in simple terms, through a shared sense of  understanding, which implies for many of these authors a mastery of language in the  strong sense, that is to say in its most complex aspects, such as the referential opacity  of concepts, or the pragmatic dimension of the meaning of utterances.27 It is therefore understandable why, in such a context, animals were for a long  period not considered as actors. Indeed, as G. H. Mead himself and more recent writ‐ ers such as Jeff Coulter have pointed out, the linguistic performance of animals—in‐ cluding that of “higher” animals—cast doubt on the idea that they can participate in  interactional processes that would allow them to enter the worlds defined by the reci‐ procity of perspectives, shared meanings and language games. Such at least is the  view about animals that has long prevailed in these perspectives, until their recent  rehabilitation—which is still limited in scope within these sociological paradigms. There is a very important consequence of this. Here again, the exclusion of ani‐ mals that can be observed throughout the twentieth century from these perspectives  is in no way the result of any allegiance to the model of the hard sciences or the  Cartesian animal-machine. Quite the opposite: it is the explicit and direct conse‐ quence of the introduction of a strong dualism between nature and mind—in other  words the establishment of an impassable boundary, which is explicitly constructed  against the hegemonic pretensions of the hard sciences concerning mental phenom‐ ena. For researchers who traditionally identify with these perspectives, recognising  that animals have a form of agency would be, as it was for the cultural anthropologist  of the twentieth century, to directly threaten the autonomy of the social sciences in  relation to the natural sciences.  We thus find here a paradox (or an irony) similar to that which we observe  in anthropology. As we saw in the first part of this article, the sociologists who  today rehabilitate the animal intend to re-use arguments traditionally deployed by  symbolic interactionism and ethnomethodology against the conceptions of the mind  prevailing in the hard sciences, by moving them into the field of the sociability  of animals and their interactions with humans, against ethology and contemporary  cognitive science. They thus argue that ethology is now dominated by an internalist,  individualistic and mechanistic conception of mind that, associated with a data col‐ lection technique based on the experimental method, impose such burdensome con‐ ditions for recognition of agency in animals—“possession” of the “theory of mind,”   27. On these various issues see Descombes (1996) and Cyril Lemieux (2009). 134, Revue française de sociologie, 56-1, 2015 </page> <page sequence="20"> Dominique Guillo in particular28—that it necessarily leads to researchers underestimating the intensity  of animals’ social life in their results, and thus to overestimate what separates them  from man (Arluke and Sanders, 1996; Goode, 2007). The paradox is that the general conception of the mind within interactionism  and ethnomethodology, with which these sociologists support their position, is itself  based, as we have seen, on the affirmation of an extremely strong dualism between  the natural sciences and the sciences of the mind, causes and reasons, facts and con‐ cepts, etc.—which helps to keep animals separate from humans. This great tension  is why most of the representatives of these perspectives today still refuse to accept  the principle of animal agency, and why those who accept it are led to do so only  by considering it when humans are involved in interactions, and to minimize the  complexity of it, because of strong differences caused by the mastery of language  (see, in particular, Colin Jerolmack’s remarks [2010]). Do these models really break with the boundaries that make up the  Great Divide?  In total, the rehabilitation of animals in social science still seems largely inhab‐ ited by traditional abstract dualisms, and criss-crossed by objectives and questions  other than just understanding of animal sociability itself. For all these reasons, one  might be doubtful about the depth of the break that it can make with the nature/ culture boundary, and its ability to fully establish animals as an autonomous empiri‐ cal research subject. This is especially true, however, for anthropological perspectives, because of  their very programme, centred on the thesis of the Great Divide, and on which they  are heavily dependent.29 The difficulties this programme has in really being able to  look “beyond nature and culture” appear quite clearly, firstly, in the asymmetries  that it cannot help but maintain between the two poles of the opposition that it seeks  to move beyond. First, the researchers who developed animal studies often have a  wider involvement in Cultural Studies, which, as their name implies, tend to absorb  nature into culture. One might also wonder what stuff makes up the entities that  form the conceptual backbone of many of these models, in particular the “ontology”  of Descola and the “naturecultures” of Latour. A given ontology can sketch out a  world where “nature” and “culture” are not distinguished, as Descola suggests. But  as an ontology, it remains essentially a particular image of the world, a certain way  of organizing patterns of practice or categories.30 However distinct from culture, an  ontology therefore remains a phenomenon that seems much more ideal than mate‐ rial, much more similar to what the West calls “culture” than what it calls “nature.”  The concept of “natureculture” proposed by Latour is probably more symmetrical,  since it serves to designate networks of entities made of both the material and the  ideal. However, it is questionable whether it is possible to overcome the opposition  between nature and culture through such a notion, that proposes, as does that of   28. On this question see especially the work  30. On this point in Descola, see the helpful  of Michael Tomasello (2008), which has con‐ remarks in Piette (2012, p. 26). siderable influence at present.  29. The sociological perspective is less fo‐ cused on this thesis.  Revue française de sociologie, 56-1, 2015, 135 </page> <page sequence="21"> What is the Place of Animals in the Social Sciences? “hybrid,” to characterize beings always and forever from this distinction, by drawing  the boundary no longer between them, but within each of them. To say that a virus  or a dog are hybrids, is to think about them as mixtures of traits that are natural  and traits that are cultural, and not fundamentally on the basis of another ontology. More importantly, for the same reasons, these discourses struggle to deal sym‐ metrically with humans and animals, and are generally tinged with anthropocen‐ trism, contrary to the objective they claim.31 This asymmetry and anthropocentrism  appear acutely in the category of “non-human” as coined by Latour, which has been  extremely successful in this literature. But what indeed does this mean for a dog, a  shark, or from the point of view of an air pump? To a shark, it can be assumed that  the world is divided into “sharks” and “non-sharks,” who perhaps can also be “prey.”  But the category of “non-humans” is likely to have very little consistency, uniform‐ ity, cognitive or practical adequacy for them, much as the category of “non-shark,”  “non-dog” or “non-air pump” would have for a human being. Anthropocentrism is  also evident in the central place given to the concepts of hybrid, network and spokes‐ person: for Latour, animals seem to have agency only if they become “hybrid” or are  taken into hybrid networks, in other words as long as they are in contact, directly or  not, with humans. If we follow this reasoning, animals without man, or before man,  therefore had no agency, no social life. In summary, by taking this to its logical conclusion, one might consider that the  most general and philosophical versions of this anthropology are in some ways a  form of ultimate manifestation of anthropocentrism—of “modernity” in the sense  that these authors understand it—or if one will, a “ruse of anthropocentric reason,”  through which the latter is maintained by affecting to abolish itself, by applying to  itself the view it has long focused on other discourses. This is why, it seems, such a  perspective finds it hard to constitute animals as true research objects, and remains  paralyzed by these philosophical dualisms; for the basis of this perspective, if not its  own explicit or conscious horizon, as this article has attempted to show, is not the  animal itself, but above all a certain way of conceiving man against the discourse of  the hard sciences. In other words, the thesis of a Great Divide, which appears to be  a break, actually hides the extension of another and traditional Great Divide in the  social sciences: the Great Divide between the social sciences and the life sciences. * * * Articulating the social sciences and the   hard sciences without reductionism There can be no question, in this article, of challenging the fruitfulness of some  of the works mentioned in the preceding lines, particularly in sociology, as has been   31. We must clearly distinguish anthropomorphism, that is, the position which consists of seeing  traits (especially mental ones) in animals that are also found in humans, from anthropocentrism,  namely the adoption of a perspective centred on man, or too human-centred, about other beings.  The anthropological doctrines mentioned here defend some form of anthropomorphism, but are in‐ tended to criticize anthropocentrism, on which the hard sciences are grounded, according to them. 136, Revue française de sociologie, 56-1, 2015 </page> <page sequence="22"> Dominique Guillo said. It is equally indisputable that the hard sciences, particularly ethology, have for  their part developed research that, despite its contributions, has often had limita‐ tions, due to the prevailing paradigmatic frameworks that tend, by simplifying, to  minimize the weight of the social dimension of agency—human and animal. One  might add that the extreme naturalist reductionism of certain approaches from the  life sciences, and the summary critiques they make of the social sciences,32 con‐ tribute as much to the lack of real interdisciplinary dialogue as to this Great Divide  among disciplines. Nonetheless the socio-anthropological perspectives discussed here, despite their  willingness to abolish the boundary between nature and culture, renew in an under‐ ground way the old dualisms traditionally associated with this boundary, dualisms  which cannot fail to lead in one way or another to a marked separation between man  and animals, and rein in the empirical research on this topic. To put it another way, the constitution of a real field of research on this topic  and the effective abolition of the boundary between nature and culture necessarily  entail the effective dropping of all dualisms—i.e. the suspension of over-general  lines of enquiry, for example on the nature of mind or on the place and status of the  discourse of science in relation to other “ontologies”—that underlie them and help  to excessively polarize the debates. This relaxation consequently leads necessarily  to an easing of the boundary between the hard sciences and the social sciences, a  boundary based on such dualisms and on the epistemological questions of a high  degree of generality that promote them. It is essential to make clear that this easing or opening up would not necessar‐ ily involve making concessions to reductionism. They simply involve putting aside  general philosophical and epistemological questions in order to look, at a much finer  level of granularity, at the articulation of facts accumulated—respectively, each on  their own and with their own methods—by the social sciences and the life sciences.  In such a perspective, the research is not based on preliminary responses to gen‐ eral epistemological questions regarding the articulation of disciplines. The first and  main task is to seek points of compatibility (Conein, 2001) between the data and the  hypotheses specific to each of them and, if necessary to make critical assessments  and cross hypotheses that are on coextensive areas or subjects.33 In other words, what  masks the Great Divide between the social sciences and life sciences is that we may  well study this field without yielding anything of the autonomy of the social sciences,  because what is conceded to nature is not necessarily removed from culture.34 Moreover, by loosening the boundary with the hard sciences, and especially  with the life sciences, the social sciences give themselves renewed means and much  greater scope for criticizing summary naturalism, even on its own ground. They  also offer themselves the possibility of solid reasons for breaking away from the  unbridled anthropocentrism of certain research conducted under the label of social  sciences, especially in animal studies.  32. As for example that of Steven Pinker backgrounds (Enfield and Levinson, 2006).  (2002), which reduces all of the social sciences See also Maurice Bloch (2013) and Rita Astuti  to a culturalist caricature. (2007).  33. This type of approach is found in a col‐  34. This point is developed further in Guillo  lective work bringing together researchers from (2012). very different paradigmatic and disciplinary  Revue française de sociologie, 56-1, 2015, 137 </page> <page sequence="23"> What is the Place of Animals in the Social Sciences? It is hardly possible within the scope of this article to set out with satisfactory  accuracy what such an approach might include because, as it is defined here, it can‐ not be described through general theoretical principles, but only through how to  study a particular area involving animals.35 What can simply be pointed out is that  this position would have the effect right from the start of shifting the questions and  methodological problems the researcher faces. From this perspective, we seek less  to know if the animal is an actor than to determine how and in what sense a certain  species can be one, that is to identify specific empirical properties of its mode of ac‐ tion and interaction. In terms of method, such an approach is centred on the descrip‐ tion of actions and practical questions that it raises. On this issue, let us acknowledge  that the practical problems that arise for the classical ethologist are not always very  far from those that arise for the interactionist sociologist or ethnomethodologist.36  In other words, in holding to this methodological level, descriptions obtained by the  first and second, respectively, may have compatibilities to the extent that they are  isolated from the general philosophical debates about the nature of the mind that  often surround them.
