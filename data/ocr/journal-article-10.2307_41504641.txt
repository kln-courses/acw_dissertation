Benson Dumbarton Oaks The Maya civilization thrived during its Classic period, c. 300-900, on the Yucatan Peninsula and in adjacent regions to the south in what is now Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, and Honduras, where forests were cleared for ceremonial centers with stone buildings and monuments. Although the Maya were the only people in the Pre-Colum- bian world to have a true form of writing, and many of their artifacts bear hieroglyphic texts, it is only in recent years that considerable work has been done on the decipherment of these texts. Thus, much of their meaning - and the meaning of Maya history and religion in general - remains a mystery. The artifacts - not only monuments, but also smaller objects, including carvings of jade and bone, polychrome pottery, and clay fig- urines - are often of great beauty, but their sig- nificance is not clearly understood. Hundreds of the most handsome figurines that have survived from the Late Classic Maya period (c. 600-900) have been found on the island of Jaina, located in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of the Mexican state of Campeche. Figurines were produced in other parts of the Maya area, but those found in burials on the mile-square, man- grove-bordered island of Jaina are among the best known and most attractive forms of Pre-Colum- bian art. The majority of these figurines represent single seated or standing, apparently human, fig- ures, often with headdresses, capes, necklaces, shields, or other, often unidentifiable objects. Some are obviously supernatural in subject, and others seem regal in appearance. Although all types of Jaina figurines have long been known to collectors, scholarly study of them is quite recent, and is generally noncommital in the area of inter- pretation. However, questions about the purpose and meaning of these figurines are beginning to be asked.1 Most Jaina figurines functioned as whistles or rat- tles, with a blowhole or clay pellets inside. A particularly handsome example (cover; figs. 1 and 2), which has a blowhole at the bottom rear and was apparently intended as a whistle, was recently acquired by the Detroit Institute of Arts. This figurine shows an old man - with a wrinkled face, a distinctively bony brow, a small goatee, and an emaciated rib cage - embracing a young woman and lifting her skirt with his left hand. Because he leans toward her, he seems somewhat shorter than she. He wears what appears to be a soft, high cloth headdress that forms a shell-like concavity at the rear above a tied element and flares out in an inverted V over his brow, like the shape of an open bivalve. His chest is bare, and he wears the aproned loincloth that was standard Maya male dress. FIGURE 2. Figure 1, view from rear showing whistle blowhole at the bottom left. 95</page><page sequence="3">FIGURE 3. Figurine, Mexican, Maya, Jaina style, c. 700; terra cotta, h. 25.6 cm (1 OVe in.). Dumbarton Oaks Collection, Washington, D.C. The woman's right hand reaches out toward the man's cheek. Her skull resembles the artificially lengthened skulls of the Maya elite found fre- quently in burials at Jaina.2 She has an ornament on her brow and a pattern of scarification around her mouth.3 Her hair, indicated by incising, is parted in the center, worn straight across the brow, and curved at the sides. On the back of her head is a tall, thick, twisted circular ornament with a tassel and three round embellishments. She also wears ear ornaments, a sign of status in the Pre-Columbian world. Her several layers of garments consist of a long skirt or dress and a long over-garment with a folded-back border; this border has a serrated edge with a pattern of serial X's. Over this, the figure also wears a cape, and a bracelet can be seen on her right wrist. Jaina figurines were made by modeling or mold- ing fine clay, or by a combination of the two techniques, usually with details added in appli- que and painted. The Detroit piece was probably made by these combined means, with the front part of the bodies cast in a mold and clay attached for the plainer back of the bodies. The faces were made in separate molds, and the ornaments added in appliquÂ£. The X's on the woman's long garment were incised with a tool. There is still considerable color on the figurine. The woman's hair ornament (except for the tassel) and her ear ornament are a bright Maya blue, and her outer garments are also blue. The man's body is an earth-red color. Probably no two Jaina figurines are exactly alike, but certain types recur. A figurine in the Dum- barton Oaks Collection, Washington, D.C. (fig. 3), is generally similar to the Detroit example, depicting the same subject matter in a virtually identical pose. The woman in the Dumbarton Oaks piece has the same dentate edge on the fold of her cape as in the Detroit piece, but it is less sharply defined. Her face certainly was made from a different mold; the added elements of hair- dress, ear ornaments, and hair decoration also differ from those of the Detroit figurine. The bro- ken bit of clay on the shoulder of the Detroit woman may have been part of a scarf-like object 96</page><page sequence="4">FIGURE 4. Figurine, Mexican, Maya, Jaina style, c. 700; terra cotta. Collection of Robert A. Koch, Princeton. similar to that worn by the Dumbarton Oaks woman. The latter figure actually touches the face of the beardless old man beside her, rather than merely gesturing toward him; he wears a loin- cloth and ear ornaments, and has a headdress that incorporates a deer head.4 A variant example of this type of figurine, in the collection of Robert A. Koch, Princeton (fig. 4), shows a large, bare-breasted woman wearing a long skirt. Her hairdress, with its coiled elements, is generally similar to that of the other two women, although on the Princeton piece the coil is studded with spiky elements and the woman also has a brow ornament and scarification around the mouth.5 The thin old man beside her has his right arm around her neck and holds her breast with his left hand. His bent left leg presses against the front of her skirt, and she holds his hip with her left hand. The position of the Koch figurine may be transi- tional to another version of this theme (fig. 5), of which there are a number of surviving examples.6 In these, both figures are seated, with the woman cross-legged and facing forward, looking rather disinterested. The old man is seated at her side, almost In her lap, with his loincloth apron and one bent leg over her leg and one arm around her shoulders. She puts her arm around his waist or shoulder in a supportive embrace. In four of FIGURE 5. Figurine, Mexican, Maya, Jaina style, c. 700; terra cotta, 9.5 cm (VA in.). Collection of Dr. Kurt Stavenhagen, Mexico. Photo: Dr. Wiltraud Zehnder. the examples of this type known to me, the man has one hand on the woman's breast; in the other three, his hand is at her chin. In each case, the woman is bare-breasted and wears a skirt; she usually wears bracelets and, occasionally, a necklace. In some cases, she has an elaborate headdress over a typical hair style. Most of the men in these figurines seem small and frail, and their faces are elaborately wrinkled. The women are young and beautiful, but they seem more serene, motherly, and protective than erotic. This is particularly interesting since, although it seems physiologically impossible, these seated figurines may have been intended to represent sexual intercourse. There are a number of other Jaina figurine types that may relate in theme to these depictions of an old man and a young woman. Most similar is the 97</page><page sequence="5">FIGURE 6. Figurine, Mexican, Maya, Jaina style, c. 700; terra cotta, 12 cm (AVa in.). Collection of Gillett G. Griffin, Princeton. representation of a young woman seated beside a rabbit with whom she shares a light embrace (fig. 6). 7 In this type of figurine, the rabbit is a large, supernatural creature, sometimes bearded, who wears a necklace with a pendant and a loin- cloth with an apron. The woman in these depic- tions has at the center of her brow a little loop representing a lock of hair, a detail not found on the other types of figurines; like most of the female Jaina figures, she wears a necklace and bracelets. One of her arms is placed at the rabbit's waist or shoulder; he in turn is in much the same position as the old men in the seated figurines, with his leg and loincloth apron draped over the woman's leg, and one arm around her shoulder. There are a number of ways to approach the inter- pretation of Maya figurines. One possible source of information is the body of customs and beliefs, possibly dating back to ancient times, that sur- vived at the time of the arrival of Europeans in the New World, and that, in some instances, con- tinues even today in remote areas. This source is limited, however, since these customs have vary- ing dates of origin, come from different parts of the Maya area, and have been blended with a number of outside influences. They have not, thus far, been of great help in interpreting the figurines, but they are potentially useful. Another source for explanation lies in Maya art itself. For example, one could compare the Detroit figurine and the related objects discussed above with other Jaina figurines. But, while other male figures wear headdresses generally similar to those of the old man in the Detroit and Dum- barton Oaks pieces, their further attributes do not aid in the explanation of the Detroit and Dum- barton Oaks figures. Nor can the hair, head- dresses, or scarification of the women in these pieces be meaningfully compared with those of other figurines. A possible further source of comparative material is the stone sculpture with figures and texts that was placed in the plazas or buildings of important Maya ceremonial centers like Tikal, Copan, and Palenque. Decipherment of the hieroglyphic texts 98</page><page sequence="6">resentations of deities illustrating texts having to do with astronomy (interwoven with astrology and cosmology), ritual, and divination. Like many agricultural peoples at a certain stage of devel- opment, the Maya were excellent astronomers and calendar makers; the codices are evidence of this. The closest parallels to the figurines are found in the book known as the Dresden Codex, which is probably a late copy of a Classic Maya manuscript.10 In this codex, a deity generally thought to be the moon goddess, later known as Ix Chel, is frequently shown, usually bare-breasted, with various male deities, in suggestive poses in which she raises one hand, often in caress (figs. 7-9). 11 In some representations she wears a skirt with an edging not unlike that of the Detroit fig- urine, but this edging in itself is not an attribute particular to her, since it appears on the garments of other deities as well, including males. The moon deity was the goddess of healing, divina- tion, rainbows, and bodies of water, and was also a goddess of the earth and of crops. Known to have been promiscuous, as is obvious from the Dresden Codex depictions, she was also the god- dess of licentiousness and procreation. An association between Ix Chel and Jaina figu- rines depicting beautiful, serene young women, often shown in motion, has been made before.12 The lock of hair depicted on the images of women with rabbits is, according to some scholars, diag- nostic of the moon goddess in the codices.13 Moreover, the rabbit was connected with the moon in Pre-Columbian mythology in this area. For example, two incised obsidian blades from the site of Tikal show the moon goddess holding a rabbit in her lap as she sits inside a crescent moon.14 The similarity of these incised scenes to the woman-and-rabbit figurines suggests that both may depict the same subject. Rabbits are also associated with moon signs on two Maya stone monuments.15 This evidence and the fact that the women on all the figurines discussed here are involved in implied or actual sexual activity are further indications that the young women in the figurines can be identified as representations of the moon goddess. If the women's identity is somewhat tentative, the identification of the old men is even less clear. In the Maya codices, at least four Maya gods are represented as old men and depicted with the moon goddess. For example, in the Dresden Codex, she is shown several times with the god of death.16 Here the goddess herself is portrayed with "death spots" (marks of putrefaction) and closed eyes. The man in the Detroit figurine prob- ably does not represent the god of death, but he may be a dead god or a god of the Underworld. indicates that the figures depicted here are usually great Maya kings, who seem to have been thought of - or to have thought of themselves - as gods. The iconography of these monuments is now being studied in detail. Also of interest are the scenes painted on Classic Maya pottery vases and exhibiting a number of kinds of subject matter - much of it clearly supernatural. These include some palace scenes thought to be set in the Maya Underworld,8 possibly including figures of Maya kings. The Jaina figurines, however, show relatively lit- tle similarity to these other Maya art forms. The figurines are usually dressed differently from the figures on the monuments, and they seem to have little correlation with the figures represented on vases. Neither do they wear or carry the objects that function as identifying symbols in other forms of Maya art. Although the realism of Jaina figurines has often been noted, there is no precedent for interpreting the finest art of the Classic Maya period as show- ing the activities of ordinary people. While in the case of the Detroit figurine, it might be possible to establish that the old man and young woman were intended to represent historical or genre fig- ures, such an interpretation would not take into account the associations such figurines appear to have had with the Underworld. Since these objects were excavated at burial sites, they may have been made specifically for use as grave goods, although it is possible that they had some ritual use before burial as well. The figurines have been described in excavation reports as having been found "clutched" in the arms of the deceased or placed on the chest or near the body.9 Clearly it was important to take something significant to the Underworld; the world of the dead was of great importance to the Maya, as is evidenced not only by the quality and quantity of their grave goods, but by the themes of death and the Under- world that occur in their art. The Underworld was associated not only with death but with the earth and fertility, with renewal and the continuity of life. Thus, it would seem that in the case of the Detroit figurine and related objects, we are dealing with images with supernatural associations, but their specific identity remains problematic. Maya dei- ties were extremely complicated, and are a source of great confusion to scholars, although in other art forms they may have more recognizable attrib- utes than are found on the figurines. The Maya representations that are closest to the figurines in pose and gesture are those found in the codices, folding-screen books of bark-paper that show rep- 99</page><page sequence="7">The moon goddess' most frequent and impas- sioned embracer in the Dresden Codex is the rain god, known as God B17 or Chac (fig. 7). While Chac was depicted as an old man with a long nose or lip, he was considered, of course, to be a life-giving god; his name glyph includes the sign for wind, breath, or life. A good deal of ethno- historical and ethnographic material illuminates the connection between the moon goddess and the rain god and suggests that a relationship between these deities was already current in Clas- sic Maya times. In the mountains of central Mex- ico, for example, in the period just before the Spanish Conquest, there was a belief that the moon resided in the home of the rain god, and the moon symbols in the codices from that area usually contain a water sign. On the Yucatan Pen- insula, of which Campeche is a part, when the moon disappeared, it was said that she had departed to her well, or that she had gone off to the land of the rain god.18 One must remember that Ix Chel was also an earth goddess and, as such, would have welcomed the rain god. Addi- tional ethnographic support for the identification of the old man in the figurines as Chac is found in the Yucatecan belief that Chac was a bearded old man,19 and in the central Mexican belief that some of the souls of the dead went to the abode of the rain god. The moon goddess also appears in the codices with several old deities (figs. 8 and 9) who are Underworld deities, in at least some respects. All these gods are also associated with the sky, heav- enly bodies, and the Maya calendar,20 and would have been suitable companions for the moon goddess. Some of them are bearded, and all have distinctive headdresses - but no headdress is sim- ilar to that on the Detroit figurine. Ix Chel is seen once with God L, who is often shown as black and associated with darkness and night (fig. 8). His usual headdress, which resem- bles at first an old-fashioned garden party hat, but which is actually made up of a screech owl perched on a large feathered brim, is very differ- ent from that worn by the male in the Detroit figurine. This god appears on a painted vase with a young woman whose lock of hair in a bead or loop resembles that of the woman on the rabbit figurines,21 suggesting that she may be the moon goddess; the other comely young women in the scene may be other astral bodies. God L was thought to be associated with the planet Venus,22 and since the moon goddess is said to have had an affair with a Venus god, it may be possible to interpret the old man in the figurines as God L. FIGURE 7. The moon goddess with the rain god, Chac. Repro- duced from J. Eric S. Thompson, A Commentary on the Dresden Codex , Philadelphia, 1972: 68b. Another belief is that God L was the Underworld equivalent of a deity known as God D, or Itzamna,23 who was the creator god and a general sky god. Ix Chel is shown in the Dresden Codex embracing a god with Itzamna's name glyph in the text above his head; he is bearded and has a Maya year sign in his headdress (fig. 9). Both this codex figure and another with a similar headdress have been identified as a Bacab,24 a god who held up the sky and who may have been a stellar deity as well as a manifestation of God L. A Bacab, on the other hand, has elsewhere been identified with God N,25 who was the earth god and therefore one of the principal gods of the Underworld. Ix Chel does not appear in the cod- ices with an undisputed figure of God N, but she is shown in his company on a number of painted vases.26 He is usually depicted wearing or emerg- ing from a shell, normally a conch type, and/or wearing a headdress with net or hatching (fig. 10). Although the headdress of the man on the Detroit figurine is vaguely shell-like, the figure does not have God N's typical attributes. It may be significant, however, that God N was partic- ularly important on the Yucatan Peninsula, where, 100</page><page sequence="8">FIGURE 8. The moon goddess, holding a glyph for maize in her hand, with God L. Reproduced from Thompson (see caption, figure 7): 14c. in recent times, a deity known as Mam and called "Grandfather" is thought to have been the equiv- alent of the ancient God N.27 One could imagine that a goddess of bodies of water, such as Ix Chel, might be romantically involved with the earth. There are other deities with whom the moon god- dess is known to have been depicted, but God B (the rain god), God L (the Underworld god with Venus and/or sky associations), and God N (the earth god), the latter two of whom are closely related, are the most likely choices for her partner in an interpretation of the figurines. Unfortu- nately, there is no clear indication of which of these is the right choice. Ix Chel appears, both on the figurines and in the codices, adjacent to old men who must represent waning planets and stars. In the codices, she also is seen with younger gods, but on pottery that was to be put into burials, she appears only with moribund ones. It is possible that, like the cod- ices, the figurines may depict the moon with a series of different old men, and thus illustrate var- ious lunar phases and conjunctions. The moon goddess was notorious for having affairs with other heavenly bodies; the late Sir Eric Thomp- FIGURE 9. The moon goddess with an old god whose headdress contains a year sign. Reproduced from Thompson (see caption, figure 7): 23c. son, the most eminent recent Mayan ist, suggested in his commentary on the Dresden Codex that "scenes of union of the moon goddess with cer- tain gods refer to conjunctions of the moon with certain constellations associated with these dei- ties . . ,"28 While we cannot yet solve the prob- lems inherent in Maya deities and supernatural creatures, because of the complexity and incon- sistency of their depictions, it can almost certainly be postulated that the Jaina figurines have astro- nomical meaning. The fact that the material in the Dresden Codex deals with astronomy, astrol- ogy, and sacred almanacs reinforces this idea. There are still other unanswered questions about these figurines. If the rabbit and the old man are virtually interchangeable motifs, and the rabbit was associated with the moon, then how were the moon and the old man related? Was the rabbit perhaps symbolic of another planet or star that is close to the moon? And why are these figurines whistles or rattles? Were they used to make sound in some burial ceremony? Did the fact that they could make sound, that breath could go through the whistles, give them a quality of aliveness? Was it important to be able to make sound in the Underworld? 101</page><page sequence="9">FIGURE 10. Partial roll-out rendering of a Maya polychrome vase. The main figure is God N, the earth god, dressed in a shell; his name glyph, showing a net headdress, is in the upper left corner. Dumbarton Oaks Collection, Washington, D.C. At this stage of study, an exact interpretation of the Detroit figurine is virtually impossible. One thing, however, seems clear: water, earth, and the auspicious planets and stars, with their asso- ciations with death and the Underworld as the other side of life and fertility - these are all basic themes of Maya art. Maya deities generally relate to certain fundamental concepts: the fertility of the earth, the continuity of life, the cyclical pro- gression of the heavenly bodies. Deities repre- senting the latter emphasize continuity, for although heavenly bodies go to the Underworld, they always return. Jaina, in the western part of the Maya area, was apparently an island to which people were taken for burial. There is a small ceremonial center there, composed chiefly of a large cemetery. It has been suggested that Jaina's place in the west, emphasized by the setting sun, may have been regarded as a metaphor for man's earthly end. As a choice for burial, Jaina may have marked the entrance to . . . the Underworld.29 It seems logical to suppose that Jaina figurines representing the moon goddess, who was also associated with the west, and her Underworld- god lover were considered to be appropriate companions of the dead on their journey into the sunset.

The Maya had an approximate solar calendar of 18 months, each with 20 days, making a total of 360 days, to which 5 were added - these latter being considered "dead days." This cal- endar was synchronized with a ritual calendar of 20 days accompanied by the numbers 1 to 13, which made a cycle of 260 days before a given day name and number were paired again. These two calendars together made up a 52-year cycle. There is also data in Maya texts on lunations and on the cycles of Venus and Jupiter. 21 . Coe, Lords of the Underworld (note 8): no. 1 . 22.
