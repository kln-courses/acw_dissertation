No. 4, December 2003, pp. 388—406 TREE OF CONSCIOUSNESS: THE SHEKHINAH IN EDMOND JABÈS' YAËL Nathalie Debrauwere-Miller Abstract It is not uncommon for readers to situate the writing of Egyptian—French Jewish writer Edmond Jabès (1912—1991) within post-structuralist currents. However, it is the contention of this article that these critics overlook that which makes him a prototype of the post-Shoah Jew rethinking the concept of God through the ancient traditions (Talmudic, Kabbalistic and philosophical traditions). Whereas in most of his writing the interpretation of God's presence as Sacred text originates from the Talmudic tradition, the fourth of his seven Books of Questions, entitled Yaël, humanises God in the form of the Shekhinah, one of the feminine emanations of God in the Kabbalistic tradition. Through the sacred vision of his new Yaël-Shekhinah, Jabès elevates his own writing to the dimension of a spiritual act. I. INTRODUCTION While Edmond Jabès' poetics are in part an articulation of Western modernity's pronunciation of the 'death of God', at the same time his conceptualisation of God is thoroughly inscribed within Jewish thought and shares some resemblance with the Jewish Kabbalah. In the poetics of Jabès, God is figured. He is cited by name and by his mute speech in an address that is ceaselessly interrogating. However, this divine (interlocutor declines the invitation to appear in the first three Books of Questions.1 Therefore, it is out of this weighty silence that Jabès invents God's face and lends him form and voice. From an unfigurable God-Book present in the first series of books that parallels the emergence of a Talmudic tradition, one begins to perceive the figuration of a feminine God in the final four Books of Questions.2 This stunning conception of a personalised God stems from Jewish mysticism in which God is disclosed anthropomorphically, while in the Talmudic tradition God is understood as absolute absence or distance. The representa tion of God is therefore at stake in Jabès' poetics. I argue that in the book Yaël (fourth Book of Questions) the Shekhinah's shadow frequents the poet's dwelling through the character of Yaël.

Originally the Kabbalah did not contain any mystical signification. It came to designate the esoteric tradition around 1200 (in southern France and Spain) when it broke off from other mystical groups. It reached, then, a specific content grounded both on esoterism and theosophy.5 A new way of reading the Bible and the midrashic interpretations was bom. As for the Zohar, the mystical book belonging to the Jewish Kabbalah, it poeticises the epiphany of a personalised God in its immediate experience with the divine. In order to describe the diverse components of divine consciousness, the theosophy of the Zohar distinguishes between the En-Sof, the infinite being of God hidden in Itself whose mystery remains imperceptible, and the sefirot,6 the God revealed to the mystics who unfolds Himself in ten divine dimensions and emanates from the hidden source of the En-Sof. In the zoharic tradition, Shekhinah is the last sefira within the ensemble of the ten sefirot which formed the 'sefirotic Tree' in which divine activity is revealed. Edmond Jabès, as a Jew, was expelled from Egypt in 1957 and settled in France where he began his work in prose. His Jewish consciousness was bom from this rupture with Egypt. He experienced with bitterness the condition of exile which led him to the vestiges of a lost tradition. Jabès confessed to Marcel Cohen: I believe I did find my way back to a certain tradition insofar as I immersed myself completely in the Kabbalah and the Talmud. I also read much about those books, as they are works one obviously cannot, at first, approach all alone. I also read, in translation of course, most of the Jewish spiritual masters. Being neither a mystic nor a gnostic, it is clearly not the letter of those texts that marked me, but the shape of the thinking, their spiritual depth, particular logic and inventiveness—I am thinking here of the Kabbalah. Those books were in complete harmony with my preoccupations as a writer. Not only did they stimulate my own questioning, they also seemed to prolong it into an immemorial past.7 Jabès points out clearly that he is not a mystic, therefore he did not attempt to follow any kabbalistic precepts. Nevertheless it is as a Jewish writer that he sought inspiration in these books which transmit an 'immemorial past'. 'Those books were in complete harmony with' his 'preoccupations as a writer', since for Jabès the Jew and the writer 'are only torments of an ancient word'.8 As a</page><page sequence="3">390 NATHALIE DEBRAUWERE-MILLER Jew he was tormented by the illegible sacred word of the Thora (Jewish Bible) which encloses the meaning of the world. As a writer he was stmck by the literary invention of the Kabbalah which convinced him to pursue its path towards an innovative hermeneutic.9 Also, Jabès points out to Marcel Cohen that his reading of the Kabbalah and the Talmud was intended at that time to verify an 'intuition regarding a certain Judaism'.10 The Books of Questions are the books of memory, he himself tells us, a memory struggling against oblivion whose imaginary characters are the beacons of recollection. And yet, in my reading of the book of Yaël it is the notion of subversion more than tradition which is at stake: Jabès, in immersing himself in the Kabbalah and specifically in the Zohar, chooses the path of a subversive interpretation. With its new way of thinking of God, the Zohar 'represents a forceful break' and 'purports not only to interpret God's revealed words and acts, but also to describe the inner workings of God's mind. (...) To decipher a Zoharic text, then, the Western and modem reader must suspend all presuppositions about the nature of God as a perfect, immobile Being (...)'.11 To the traditional theologian or Jewish philosopher the idea of God's consciousness is a subversive hermeneutic because it presents the feminine dimension of an anthropomorphic God. But Jabès never completely adheres to 'the letter' of the sacred texts (the Thora, the Talmud and the Zohar), though he will retain 'the shape of the thinking, their spiritual depth, particular logic and inventiveness'. Some specific motifs deploying the 'inventiveness' of the Zohar are in fact inscribed subversively in Jabès' fragmentary writing. Therefore he not only transgresses 'normative' Judaism— the Talmudic tradition—in following the most subversive interpretation of the Bible—the Zoharic tradition—but as we shall see he also gives voice to the zoharic feminine God and rewrites the myths of Adam and Elishah Ben Abuyah—the two dissidents against God's Law. Therefore Jabès' subversion is a doubly articulated one. On the one hand his primary source of inspiration— the Zohar—is already in itself an iconoclastic text which breaks with the traditional currents of Jewish thought. Secondly Jabès' writing works to subvert certain tenets at the core of the Zohar itself. In fictionalising certain symbolic aspects of the Shekhinah such as the zoharic feminine divine,12 we shall see that Jabès strives to attenuate the oblivion and to seek out the memory of God. By way of a return to the source of an 'immemorial past', his poetics blends the awakening of an ancient heritage with the invention of a spiritual writing. Impacted by the creativity of Jewish mysticism, he chances upon the traces of a new experience of the divine. God is thus discovered as a nostalgic quest which grows in intensity throughout the seven Books of Questions and reveals itself as the eponymous figure and the embodied speech of the book Yaël. Through the character of Yaël, the movement of the sefirotic Tree seems to flow like a divine inspiration : 'God's</page><page sequence="4">SHEKHINAH IN EDMOND JABES' YAËL 391 knowledge is in the tree'13 we are told, and the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil is another name which designates the zoharic Shekhinah. Under the influence of the mystics who speak to him across centuries, Jabès undertakes the invention of a 'new' poetic Shekhinah. II. THE FIGURABLE NOMINATION'4 Who is closest to God? He who invents Him as he created man, or he who prays for permission to approach Him?15 Jabès In this epigraph, the question posed by Yukel, the God-seeking narrator of the Book of Yukel (second Book of Questions), constitutes in my view one of the foundations of Jabès' spiritual writing. Through the conception of the character of Yaël that I identify with the sacred Shekhinah, Yukel's interrogation not only remains in the background of Yaël but seems to find an answer in this very same book : he who invents God 'as he created man', as Jabès' narrator created YYèl-Shekhinah, would be closer to God than he 'who prays for permission to approach Him'. The verb 'invent' is essential because Jabès was struck by the 'inventiveness' of the Kabbalah and he similarly attempts the reinvention of what I call Yaël-Shekhinah out of the zoharic Shekhinah. Yaël, whose ephemeral apparition is tantamount to a violent passage, extends Jabès' book of memory inscribed in the first trilogy of the Books of Questions and collects the dispersed, scattered voices of the other characters. However, Yaël's divine filiation deprives her of all the personal attributes which lend 'realism' to traditional fictional characters. She is the 'universal word' received by the anonymous narrator in a dream 'across shadow and light' as a prophetic revelation: Across shadow and light goes the way to Yaël to receive her word. For Yaël is the universal word: signs, colors, sounds of earth and sky, the chance of a grain of salt and the spiral silence of towers.16 In a mystic thirst in which sensuality accompanies spirituality, the narrator struggles with words from whence a feminine God, a poetic Shekhinah, issues forth in the night of his dream after a long gestation. He places speech in her mouth and accords her a body. This God, whose only power is that granted by the matrix of the book, arises figured from this privileged place. The narrator of Yaël henceforth addresses directly this invented God, the one who had</page><page sequence="5">392 NATHALIE DEBRAUWERE-MILLER resisted invocations, was formless in his infinity and parsimonious in speech in the three first Books of Questions. The character ofYaël belongs to 'The Time of the Story'17 through which we learn she is fighting with her past, obsessed with a still-born child named Elya, and is courted by two anonymous suitors who are competing for her love. But she is also part of ' The Time before the Story which is its portion of dark, its prophetic part'. In other words, Yaël's story can be read on two different levels: at first glance she is a feminine character with whom the anonymous narrator is deeply in love. However, Yaël also belongs to the prophetic time, the time of the narrator's dream or 'this time before time, this strange time of God's sleep',18 which evokes God's withdrawal after the creation ex-nihilo. That is why Yaël is never the same, always under the influence of her mutations which prevents the writer from having a complete control over his own creation. Throughout the book Jabès' narrator asks who is this creature who escapes from his own invention: Who are you, Yaël, to prefer your uncreated face to the one I am patiently modeling? You are and you are not this woman whom her mirror drives back to her longing to be. (...) Yaël, a feminine half of a being that does not say where it is going.19 A fleeting figure who traverses surreptitiously the poetic space, 'Yaël is passage and use of God'.20 She seems to embody the mystery of the Shekhinah dear to the mystics and defiantly present before the writer. This tenth sefira, endowed with innumerable names such as Malkhut or the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, is at the heart of the long evolution of the Zohar, since she has the function of being the sovereign of the world. Yaël moulded in Jabès' hand from the clay of words announces the coming of a silent God by the divine origin of her name, comprised of the two signifiers for God: 'Ya' and 'El': Only Yaël is named. [... ] Her first name intrigued me from the moment I heard it. [... ] But it was a woman who bore it, and I realized I would love Yaël in the lips of the black crater of her name. Countenance of God, O infinite effacing of the Face.21 Beyond her name there is something else which bars her realisation: the unnameable, unfigurable 'countenance of God, O infinite effacing of the Face'. For the face of God is invisible to human beings in the 'normative' Judaism—Talmudic tradition. But Jabès, inspired by the subversion of the Zohar, violates the 'prohibition of representation' promulgated by the Talmudic and Philosophic traditions. For the Kabbalists of the thirteenth century, God's names are generated through the secret combinations of divine</page><page sequence="6">SHEKHINAH IN EDMOND JABES' YAËL 393 powers concentrated in the Tetragrammaton 'YHWH'.22 This greatest of all God's names can be written but remains unpronounceable. And yet God is specified by His name which escapes all designation since it is the key to a mystery which nullifies the regime of interpretation. The entire creation itself resides in this Name of which the Torah is the articulation.23 Each individual letter issues forth from this Tetragrammaton and comprises the entire system of the sefirot emanations,24 from Hesed to Shekhinah. Regarding the first half of the name Yaël, 'Ya\ one notices that it is formed by the Hebrew consonant which begins the Tetragrammaton, the Yud: [... ] providential gesture and crystalline word which you named with one name in two: Ya-El, a call more harrowing than a scream, a call from God to God [... ] You are called Yaël, and you try to sew together the pieces of your name.25 According to the Zohar, this Yud is precisely the original source of the divine language by which other linguistic utterances are constituted.26 'Yah' belongs to the symbolically lettered universe since it is part of the Tetragrammaton (YH). Also in Hebrew it signifies 'the Eternal', the name reserved for the praise of God in the Bible.27 In the Zohar, 'Yah' is part of the sefirotic Tree as God's feminine form and it is applied to Shekhinah as well as Hokhmah (representing the transcendent wisdom). As for 'El', the second syllable, it is found specifically in the poetic books of the Bible.28 It is the generic term which is not used as a proper name and designates the power of God. In the Zoharic tradition, 'El' corresponds to Shekhinah as well as Hesed (fourth divine and masculine dimension of the sefirotic Tree) representing charity, grace, and unconditional love. But it refers also to Tiferet-Yesod (sixth and seventh of God's masculine dimensions, representing the center of divine consciousness). Originally 'Yah' (Shekhinah) and 'El' (Tiferet) were joined and then split even before the creation of the world. One might argue, then, that Jabès chose symbolically the name 'Yaël' to resolve God's inherent dualism. For only the 'mystical union' of Shekhinah (Yah) with Tiferet (El) can ward off Evil and maintain the harmony of the sefirotic and human realms, since it is the source of continuity. The name pieced together by 'Ya-El' underlines the divine alterity inscribed in the unpronounceability of the Great Name. Though in its origin the letter Yud symbolised the first Kabbalistic sefira, Keter, and comprised all the sefirot without distinction, the masculine and feminine aspects of God were separated out when it flowed within Hokhmah,29 the second masculine sefira from which the sefirot unfold. From this zoharic point one could infer that the scission of the name 'Ya-El' represents the division of the masculine and feminine emanations of God. The 'call from God to God', from Ya to El, is the inaudible cry of the original rupture of God's being, and 'the lips of the black</page><page sequence="7">394 NATHALIE DEBRAUWERE-MILLER crater of her name' accentuate Yaël-Shekhinah's alterity: the non-coincidence of identity and name. Paralleling the divine root of her name, Yaël is also a biblical figure30 and this confers upon her a historical-legendary dimension previously inscribed in the sacred Book. She belongs to the time of the prophetess Deborah when Israel, freed from the power ofjabin and from the ruthless Sisera, was liberated by the hand ofjaël.31 She thus preexists the poet's book and Jabès does not ignore the pre-established connotations of this woman chosen by God to save the Hebrews. From her divine origin to her destiny as a human being designated by God and acting in his name, she opens the field of interpretation. III. THE ADVENT OF A FEMININE GOD Yaël, ushered into the fleetingness of the present moment, flows into the narrator's visionary dream. The ambiguity which constitutes her being attributes multiple identities to her, transforming her into 'saint or devil'.32 The book Yaël, under the sign of the dream, proclaims the theophany of a mysterious divinity playing out its mutations. God is female in His word, male in His gesture. [... ] Yaël is passage and use of God [... ] God revealing Himself as a woman or Satan with the clear eyes of God. The trees had brought her. The grass sighed under her feet. [■■■]■" Yaël metamorphoses into God, woman, or Satan throughout the course of the book and affirms herself through the ambivalence of her identities. And the Shekhinah gathers together all these conflictual elements of divine conscious ness found in Yaël and makes use of them while acting upon the non-divine world. Opposed to Tiferet (representing the Tree of Life and the principle of divine stability), the Shekhinah as the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil oscillates incessantly between the positive components of her consciousness, such as Love, Mercy, and 'Judgment of Justice', and the negative aspects such as 'Judgment of Fury' and Death.34 Her metamorphoses alter the hierarchy established in the sefirotic world and can provoke a disorder in the created worlds.35 In fact, the equilibrium of the created worlds depends on the devotion of the Jew who, if his intentions are pure, sends positive energy to Shekhinah, thus fostering her fusion with Tiferet. Though the Kabbalists resisted employing a sexual symbolism to characterise the relationship between God and man, they did not hesitate to do so to describe the figurai relation of God with himself. This 'mystical marriage' of God with his Shekhinah symbolises the symbiosis of binary oppositions existing in God: the En-Sof</page><page sequence="8">SHEKHINAH IN EDMOND JABES' YAËL 395 (divine infinitude) and its sefirot, the masculine and the feminine, the active and the passive. The conflictual dualism36 of Yaël, 'saint or devil' or 'God revealing Himself as a woman or Satan with the clear eyes of God', is drawn out precisely from the figurations of the Shekhinah: O Yaël, how can you be the joy of the world in its abundance and at the same time the scream of the waning abyss? [... ] Across shadow and light goes the way to Yaël to receive her word. [... ] O Yaël, priestess at the Temple threshold, will you die in the odor of sanctity, a victim of the moon, a victim of your lucidity? [... ]37 'Joy of the world' and 'scream of the waning abyss', Yaël appears 'across shadow and light' at the light of the dream in the interstice of day and night. And so, as its victim, she assumes the evil aspects of the moon and acquires from the sun the eternal flame of the sacred divinity, 'priestess at the Temple threshold'. Like Yaël, the Shekhinah changes identity according to the relation she entertains with the three distinct systems constituting the totality of universal existence: the sefirotic system situated between heaven and earth, the system of the terrestrial world, and the system of 'husks' designating the world of evil (named Sitra ahra in the Zohar, representing the demonic 'other side' of the divine). In her 'intra-deical'38 dimension, as the very essence of God in the sefirotic Kingdom, the Shekhinah represents the extreme limit of the divine being. As pure receptivity, she absorbs the sacred light of all the sefirot, but a subtle play emerges between her pure receptivity and her own creativity. She embodies the feminine aspect of the mother or wife who receives and then transmits to the Jewish people the divine influence descending from the masculine forces of Tiferet and Yesod. From these masculine influences, she acquires the Love and Judgment of strict justice. As Jabès writes, Yaël Shekhinah is then 'God revealing Himself as a Woman'. Within her 'extra-deical' dimension, the Shekhinah is the first emanation by which God manifests himself in the human world. She symbolises the threshold that the mystic crosses in beginning his ascension toward the divine mystery. The Shekhinah is also identified with the community of Israel, personified by Yaël whose letters are incorporated in the name 'Yisrael'.39 She thus becomes the mystic incarnation of the divine Presence in the book of Jabès, where her speech of saintliness or evil flows. In fact, it is within this 'extra-deical' dimension that her inconsistency influences the human world. If her powers of Judgment of strict justice40 are separated at the Source (En-Sof) in order to become united with the evil forces of the system of the 'husks' (world of uncleanness), the Shekhinah disassociates herself from the</page><page sequence="9">396 NATHALIE DEBRAUWERE-MILLER other sefirot and is transformed into a destructive power which produces the Tree of Death.41 In a chapter of the book Aely called 'Where the Words Answers to the Name Yaël', we find this quotation which is clearly the counterpart of the one found in Yaël ('God's knowledge is in the tree'): 'The tree of Knowledge', he added, 'is, after all, the tree of Death'.42 The mystic Shekhinah who is the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil can also be the Tree of Death when she is separated from the forces of holiness and unified with 'the other side'. And Yaël, 'recruit and rival of God',43 is for Jabès the reversible face of Good and Evil: Who are you, Yaël, to cheat against yourself the person you want to be? What insane god furled your senses so prematurely that you cannot stand the world with its fogs and its colors? Night favors the alliance of Good and Evil with an even coolness of the woods.44 The lunar and solar bodies attempt to rapture Yaël. Within her, light and darkness struggle mercilessly; rivalry between day and night. Then as demonic fury Yaël-Shekhinah appears with the features of'Satan with the clear eyes of God' in Jabès' poetics. IV. A SHATTERED APPARITION IN A NOCTURNAL DREAM At the beginning of the book Yaël, a mystery is bom from a 'dream: a dreadful smothering of the soul, then a lofty idea of death, then an ordinary note pad where the day butts against the night'.45 The same dream recurs some pages later when we leam more about Lilith and Eve: On the 17th of March, last year, I had a dream which left me very upset. A woman used my life for her own ends. 'Lilith, Eve, Cressida? Which one? Gabriel will write me later. (One man suggests that Eve was God's first word of love; another, on the contrary, that she was His last. Eve betrayed God and God created night.) [... J.46 But Jabès tells us nothing about these dreams, since the stakes are the truth of night, which must be forgotten at the coming of day. Only the trace of a smothered cry remains on an 'ordinary note pad' of the book where the writer tries in vain to reread the obscurity of the nocturnal dream by the light of day. This exergue which precedes the prologue of Yaël designates the inception of the text and its stakes. By way of the frightening vision of the dream, Jabès' narrator-dreamer seizes upon 'a lofty idea of death'. Does he identify himself with Jacob who, in his encounter with the Unknown, hurls himself against its</page><page sequence="10">SHEKHINAH IN EDMOND JABES' Y A EL 397 power during the night of Peniel in the Procession ofjabbok? The dreamer approaches the divine being o{ Yaël-Shekhinah 'to receive her word. For Yaël is the universal word: signs, colors, sounds of earth and sky'.47 But he who beholds the face of God—Shekhinah—is subject to death. In the night of his dream the narrator-dreamer hears the mute call of a presence in absentia. It is during the course of drifting off to sleep that the memory of Yaël's 'passage and use of God' is awakened. From this memory of a presence arises a shattered apparition in the book: I find myself where I fell asleep. Yaël, waking bears your name. And your body is 48 a long shiver of amorous flights. The drifting into sleep of Jabès' narrator in the garden49 is reminiscent of Jacob, of a biblical episode which precedes that of the struggle with the nocturnal Unknown. Jacob falls asleep, his head resting on stones. Fie dreams that he sees an apparition of divine messengers climbing and descending a ladder mounted on the earth, whose summit is at the Eternal Throne. The voice of God renews his promises. Jacob awakens and exclaims, 'God was in this place and I, I did not know it'.50 Once awake, he shivers, becoming conscious of the divine presence. Like the awakening of Jewish consciousness, of Israel in Jacob, Jabès' narrator awakens to the memory of God. He begins a spiritual initiation. Approaching God means leaving behind the numbness of sleep and being aware of the presence of the Other. The approaching enigmatic presence leaves a trace at the heart of speech and body. This dream makes of him a prototypical Jacob eager to awaken to the memory of God. The song of man's misery without God is broken in the name taken by Yaël, therefore Jabès' narrator seeks out Yaël-Shekhinah in the originary site of the garden. The memory of God buttresses itself against the dereliction for which Jabès' work is invoked. He comes out of the dream in order to accomplish by writing the exercise of a deferred awakening: to write the book dedicated to Yaël, 'this book of a time where our dreams find rest'.51 The demand to revive the divine creature of oblivion seizes him and poetic invention cedes to the biblical injunction to listen, shemia,52 imposed on the Jew by Law, and to remember, zekher,53 a mandate from God at the origin of the Jewish vocation. It is Jabès' narrator calling to bear witness to the forgotten originary scene: the sacred Garden where divine harmony reigned and where the union of Shekhinah and Tiferet occurred before the fall. At the heart of poetic creation, the memory of all epochs sleeps in the anticipation of the event capable of curing his amnesia: 'Yaël, waking bears your name'. Jabès' dreamer contemplates the birth of the presence of Yaël-Shekhinah, the tree planted in the middle of the garden.</page><page sequence="11">398 NATHALIE DEBRAUWERE-MILLER V. THE TREE OF CONSCIOUSNESS IN THE GARDEN OF MEANING Tree, I watch you. Struck by your smallest trait. Every day I feel closer to you in what you are not and what your name designates. Tree, I am growing with you, with wanting to love your bark and leaves. Jabès Under the mystical illumination of the sages of Safed, one can observe this strange poetic tree spreading out its branches towards the cosmos in the garden where Jabès' narrator-passerby is steeped in revery. In this garden, he has a vision: beneath the foliage are hidden the secret sheaves of creation where the name of the Shekhinah is inscribed. For the Kabbalists of the Zohar, the tree planted by God is the very image of God—Tiferet. 'God's knowledge is in the tree',55 writes Jabès, the sefirotic Tree of eternal life. The tree which symbolises the ten dimensions of God grows before the eyes of the passerby-narrator in the garden. Let us go back to the Zoharic sources: in the middle of the Garden of Eden, kingdom of the sefirot, God planted the Tree of Life—Tiferet—heart of his oneness.56 At the entrance to the Garden, God had likewise created the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil—Shekhinah—which, united with the Tree of Life, is protected from all. As the guardian of the sefirot, the Shekhinah symbolises the first gateway to the Garden open to divine mystery. This gate alone leads to the Tree of Life, the secret text also named the 'Torah of emanations',57 but requires meditation on the unity of divine transcendence. He who yeams only for the Tree of Knowledge chooses by this gesture divine complexity and disrupts the divine union.58 The secret is thus lodged in silence and the mystery remains as such. The Tree of Knowledge, Shekhinah, is a text written to be deciphered; it is in the enigmatic Garden where the very image of God is reflected. The passage of the Shekhinah is an indispensable step in the mystic's process of decipherment. She designates the only visible part of the Tree of Life given to man in his ordinary experience. She also represents the Judgement of consciousness turned towards God and figures the birth of the critical human mind. The awakening of the soul and its growing consciousness begin with the Tree of Knowledge. To approach this tree of consciousness, Jabès' passerby (or narrator) must open the first door of the sefirotic kingdom and listen in silence to the speech of Yaël-Shekhinah, 'priestess at the Temple threshold',59 threshold of the book. The encounter with the sacred text is an allegory for the encounter with God. The narrator's spiritual voyage in the symbolic Garden of timelessness is achieved by a fragmentary writing which attempts to apprehend divine essence. It is the moment where Yaël-Shekhinah is uncovered in the light of her revelation. Let us follow the words retracing the dream:</page><page sequence="12">SHEKHINAH IN EDMOND JABES' YAËL 399 The revery of the passerby in the garden wraps it in a silken melancholy which is ruffled by cold as much as by the sun [... ] Until night is unsealed by sleep. O dream of dreams. The revery of the passerby in the garden turns into brown spitde on the branches, into dew on the leaves. [... ] The passerby walking in the garden passed Yaël: God revealing Himself as a woman.60 'The revery of the passerby' brings us to the heart of the Kabbalistic secret, to the Garden of the Torah's multiple significations. In my view, Jabès' narrator borrows the initiating path of the four ancient Talmudic masters—Rabbi Ben Azzai, Rabbi Ben Zoma, Rabbi Elisha Ben Abuyah, and Rabbi Akiba—who penetrated the place of wisdom where the Shekhinah, 'Paradise of the Torah', is confined behind the letters of the book. The entry into the paradise of signification, named 'Pardes' in Hebrew, becomes the very source of the Jewish hermeneutic61 since it is the place of absolute revelation where the meaning of the posited letter is realised. These four sages represent each of the four exegetic approaches to the Torah constituted from the acronym of the word 'PaRDeS'.62 But the first three sages of the Pardes were disgraced because they could not penetrate the mystery of knowledge. According to the Zohar, they only crossed over the first stages of the divine emanation of the sefirot and did not meditate on the transcendental unity of the sefirotic Tree. In transgressing the interdiction against attaching oneself to the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil at the exclusion of all else, they, like the idolaters, figuratively contributed to the disintegration of the 'mystical union'. They thus succumbed to the power of the sitra ahra, the demonic 'other side'.63 Only Rabbi Akiba was able to contemplate the innermost soul of the Torah. To write the book whose symbols must be deciphered—a book occupying the half-way point between the vocation of Jew and writer—is the test that Jabès imposes upon himself: 'Wisdom of symbols. A book which makes us see is a book of great wisdom'.64 His narrator undertakes his mystical adventure by taking the path already followed by these four ancestral sages. His revery carries him to their path and leads him to the secret where 'God's knowledge is in the tree'. With his intuitive return to the beginnings in the sacred Pardes, he returns to the timelessness of the creation of the tree. Which destiny will be his: death, which struck Rabbi Azzai, madness, which attacked Rabbi Ben Zoma; Rabbi Akiba's peace or subversion, which condemned Rabbi Elisha Ben Abuyah to alterity? One is led to believe that the narrator follows the steps of Elisha Ben Abuyah, the third banished renegade of the Pardes, who in his passage devastated the foliage of the Garden and with this gesture altered the foundations of normative Talmudic theology. However, though classified amongst the heretics because he placed himself outside of the Sages' community, Elisha remains at the origin of the drash,65 the meaning solicited</page><page sequence="13">400 NATHALIE DEBRAUWERE-MILLER in order to be exegeted. He exits the Pardes and becomes the other, Aher,66 doubly transformed by his non-conformity to a religious tradition fixed in certitude and by his alterity in attempting to reinvent himself outside of the Jewish thought through a new reading of the Thora. VI. THE DEVASTATED GARDEN OF MEANING The opening of the drash's exegetic method and Jabès' subversion of a normative theology lead his narrator to the path of Elisha Ben Abuyah. In his imaginary garden, the elliptic speech of Yaël is housed in strangeness, still unsaid and yet already expiring. Y zë\-Shekhinah will not speak. She will envelope herself in her own muteness, will take leave of the book. Yaël embodies the principle of life. In her, the world dies with man wherever the book is written.67 O Yaël, word free of God, In vain your voice where nothing moves.68 Having joined the subversive Rabbis, the narrator-dreamer, cleaving to Yaël Shekhinah, unleashes the subversion of the sefirotic world and separates irredeemably Shekhinah from Tiferet. Forced to leave the divine kingdom represented in the chapter of the book Yaël called 'The Garden', he symbolically unites with the evil forces of Yaël-Shekhinah and succumbs to the power of the sitra ahra, the other side of the sefirotic Tree. In crossing the threshold of timelessness, Jabès has returned to the origins of evil. He rewrites the sin of Adam in the earthly paradise: Thinking about the terrestrial paradise leads us to a reflection on the garden. Before they had a landscape, man and woman had a park cultivated by the Lord. Tree would have come into being before the animals if the latter had not been sure of a body even while still absent.69 According to the Zohar,70 the prohibition of eating from the Tree of Knowledge translates into the prohibition against cleaving to Shekhinah with the intention of destroying the divine union. As a result of his fixation on the Shekhinah, Adam banished her from the Garden and thus provoked the gravest of alterations: the subversion of the sefirotic hierarchy. He separated Knowledge from Life and the Tree of Knowledge was led into its own inner moral duality, divided between good and evil. The kingdom of the shaken sefirot engenden the fall of man, mortality and inaccessible knowledge. But in Jabès books this tragic event also brought about the corruption of language. When Adam transgressed the very first commandment of God, the legibility of the sacred letter became altered and the reading of the divine Word forbidden.</page><page sequence="14">SHEKHINAH IN EDMOND JABES' YAËL 401 In the linguistic symbolism of the Zohar,71 the separation of the divine dimensions signifies the absolute mpture between discourse and the voice of God. The mystery of the divine enunciation proceeds from the emanations of the sefirot, designating the gradual unfolding of God's consciousness into God's discourse. The secret thought unfolds in the sefira Hokhmah; from this feminine dimension a combination of secret letters is crystallised by the emanation of the sefira Binah. Then the secret thought flows in the other sefirot until it opens out in an audible voice in the sefira Tiferet. However, this voice remains internal to the sefirotic Kingdom. God, in his supreme revelation, finds the expression of his plenitude in the final sefira Shekhinah, the stage of the manifestation of the divine word articulated in discourse. Thus a movement in God occurs, a passage from 'nothingness' (Ayin) to 'I' (Am), the Shekhinah. But God's own achievement of self-conscious identity is realised through interaction with human beings when they can also say 'I'. The birth of the divine self (Shekhinah) unfolding its consciousness stage by stage is reflected in the lower world of the human self. In fact, the realisation of divine individuation depends on human partners. In other words, the revelation of Shekhinah means that 'man' becomes aware of the presence of God in reaching the deepest comprehension of his own self.72 God is female in His words, male in His gestures 73 In the night of his dream, seduced like his ancestor Adam by Yaël-Shekhinah in the sacred Garden, Jabès' narrator has broken the 'mystical union' and segre gated the feminine from the masculine dimensions of God. He has separated the voice—Tiferet—from its audible articulation—Shekhinah. The interruption of the flow of the sefirot provokes the absolute muteness of Yaël and the dumbness of his own Jewish consciousness. Yaël exits the dream and becomes again the character loved by the narrator who must confront his own solitude: In the garden, I do not have my tree. I have neither familiar bench nor flower, no man or woman for company. I have nothing.74 In rapturing the 'mystical union', does he observe the divine prohibition against making the voice speak directly? Is it not in silence that one can hear Yaël: 'Will I one day speak in your silence, Yaël?'.75 The prohibition against figuration is that of incarnation, one of the injunctions of Jewish Law. The voice has to persist in the strangeness demanded by alterity. However writing the night of his dream, Jabès' narrator has accorded Yaël a divine face and has placed an indirect embodied speech in her mouth. But</page><page sequence="15">402 NATHALIE DEBRAUWERE-MILLER like Shekhinah, she is the 'countenance of God, the infinite effacing of the Face'.76 Only the letters of her name can figure the countenance which cannot be reduced to representation. Any attempt to esthetise or create a visual image becomes a transgression. Is this what the narrator's union with the evil forces ofYaël-Shekhinah signifies, the transgression of representation similar to idolatry? The Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil symbolises in its ambiguity the limitation of the human language. The writer, like the Jew, is condemned to write an impious book founded on fragmentary words inscribed in sand whereas the sacred Book is engraved in stone. The tree of knowledge bore wormy fruit. Did God Know this? Adam ate the apple with its acid taste of defiance. Henceforth he would live and die by fighting against God, by relendessly struggling with himself.77 The desire to reach God's consciousness, the unknown secret voice, leads Jabès' narrator-dreamer to Yaël-Shekhinah. However he cleaves to the Tree of Knowledge which 'bore wormy fruit'—a defective and corrupted language—by an act of defiance and a concupiscent desire for absolute knowledge. And in his transgression of God's prohibition he goes so far as to doubt God's knowledge, provoking the eternal struggle with the unknown of the night. Like his ancestor Adam, the narrator has to be expelled from the sacred Garden where he felt asleep, unable to read the Tree of Life. The exile of Ya.ë\-Shekhinah, seen in its displacement as the wandering of language, begins and Jabès' narrator pursues her in a state of dis-grace, in the place of perfidy of the sitra ahra. She then reveals herself in all her alterity. 'Saint or devil', she becomes the Tree of Death. Vanderbilt University n. debrau@vanderbilt. edu REFERENCES E.

This mosaic of literary forms is written in a poetic prose that undermines the traditional narrative of a novel with a specific plot and characters. Though at the core of the first three Books of Questions, the story of two young lovers, Sarah and Yukel, separated in a concentra tion camp during the Shoah is told in an oblique way, the last four Books of Questions present disembodied voices with anagram matic names—Yaël, Elya, Aely, El—and an anonymous narrator who is in some undefined way related to these voices. Regarding the last four Books of Questions see also n. 17. Regarding the Shekhinah, see G. Scholem, On the Kabbalah and its Symbolism, trans. R. Manheim (London: Routledge, 1965). The Zohar. 'Book of Splendor', written at the end of the thirteenth century by Moses Ben Shem Tov of Leôn (i240?-i305) is a major book of the Spanish Kabbalah. It is a mystical Midrash (interpretation) of the Torah (five books of Moses). The sacred authority of the Zohar is classified among the Jewish canon such as the Tanakh and the Talmud. See G. Scholem, Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism (New York: Schocken Books (Foreword by R. Alter), 1945-95), pp. 205-44; Scholem, Kabbalah, pp. 11-41. The Kabbalah gave birth to a vast literature such as: the Sefer Yetsirah (III—IV CE), the Sefer ha-Bahir (XII CE), the Sefer ha-Zohar (XIII CE, the first kabbalistic text). See The Encyclopedia of Judaism (Jerusalem Publish ing, 1989). See also Scholem, Major Trends and Kabbalah. 'Theosophy signifies a mystical doctrine, or school of thought, which purports to perceive and to describe the mysterious workings of the Divinity, perhaps also believing it possible to become absorbed in its contemplation. Theosophy postulates a kind of divine emanation whereby God, abandoning his self-contained repose, awa kens to mysterious life; further, it maintains that the mysteries of creation reflect the pulsation of this divine life.' Scholem, Major Trends, p. 206. 5 The word sefirot comes from the Sefer Yetsirah (II1-VI CE), the most ancient Hebraic treatise of cosmology and cosmog ony describing the vision of the divine world. In the Sefer ha-Bahir (XII CE), the sefirot designated the ten dimensions by which God manifests himself. Cf. Diction naire Encyclopédique du Judaïsme (Paris: Editions du Cerf, 1993). In the Zohar, 'the sefirot are known by several names and sets of symbols such as Keter representing transcendent royalty, Hokhmah: transcen dent wisdom, Binah: intuitive understand ing, Gevurah: transcendent power, Hesed: transcendent grace, Tiferet: active royalty, Nesah: active grace, Hod: active power, Yesod: righteous power, Malkhut: engaged royalty, named also Shekhinah: presence and face of God'.

' In the summer 1998, I had the opportunity to meet one of Jabès' two daughters, Viviane Jabès-Crasson, in Paris. During our meeting I was able to verify my assertion regarding Jabès relationship to the Jewish Kabbalah and the Talmud checking his personal library. Though Jabès lost part of his books when he fled Egypt, and some of his remaining books were held by the other daughter, a few books were left with Viviane Jabès-Crasson such as: Le Zohar, 3 vols.

To the question asked by Marcel Cohen: 'How did you discover the Talmud?'Jabès answered: 'My father kept the eleven bound volumes of the Jerusalem Talmud in the Schwab translation on his desk. He had the books from his father and, like him, often immersed himself in them. I believe his Cartesian mind found reason for profound jubilation in the Talmud. (...) My father made me a present of these books—they are among the rare ones I was able to save—a few years before my departure from Egypt. I immersed myself in them only after having started the composition of the first Book of Questions, as if wanting to check the in tuition I had regarding a certain Judaism.' 11 Blumenthal, Understanding, p. 113. 12 The different aspects of the subversive representation of God are at stake in my reading and at the core of Jabès's writing. In the Talmud and in the Midrashim there is no allusion that the Shekhinah represents a feminine element in God. Only the Zohar introduces this radical innovation of the Kabbalah. Therefore in the thirteenth century for the strict Talmudists or even for the philosophers this new conception of the Shekhinah as the feminine element in God was one of the main stumbling blocks in the Kabbalistic system. See Scholem, Major Trends, p. 229. 13 Yaël, p. 53. 14 In the Jewish traditions and specifically in the Talmudic and philosophic traditions, the 'Prohibition against representation' of any image of God is stipulated by God in the Thora. However, in the Zoharic tradition, God is personalised through the emanations of his ten sefirot. Therefore Yaël, as the incarnation of the Shekhinah— one of the feminine dimension of God in the Zohar—is already figured through her divine name, 'Yah' and 'El'. 15 E. Jabès' Le Livre de Yukel (Paris: Gallimard, 1964), pp. 140-1, my translation. Yaël, 25. Ibid., p. 41. Jabès himself establishes these important differences between the two times of the 'narration'. In the table of contents in the book of Yaël, the first part of the book is called The Time before the Story and the second part (which is written as a journal) is called The Story.

The sefirot emanation goes beyond the concept of 'hypostases' and 'intellects' issued from the neo-Platonism of Plotinus. In fact, the kabbalistic theosophies adapted it according to Jewish monotheism. The emanation is a process of extériorisation of the En-Sof (God) which takes place inside the En-Sof without implying then the diminution of the emanator and his sep aration from the ten emanated dimensions.

In writing Yah + el with a 'hey' in the middle, Jabès is creating a 'double entente'. Since the 'ayin' (Ya'el) is not pronounced in Hebrew except by strict sefardim and could not be written in French, both meanings are inherent in the French 'Yaël'.

But if the world of Holiness is threatened by the world of 'uncleanness', she unleashes her 'Judgement of Ven geance' to protect Herself. In the last stage, if she is joined to the system of the 'husks' because of the sins of the world, she becomes the 'Judgment of Fury'. See Scholem, Kabbalah, p. 125.

In one sense, death signifies the kindling of the fire of Judgement, and the dominant power of anger, in the Shekhi nah. (...)
