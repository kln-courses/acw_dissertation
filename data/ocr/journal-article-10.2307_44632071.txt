Chrobak, and M. T. Vecchio Ford Motor Co. ABSTRACT A highly controlled six-vehicle crash test program was conducted to pro- vide an estimate of the test- to- test var- iability of the NHTSA-proposed passenger car dynamic side impact test procedure. The results of this program showed that the rear seat test dummy response meas- urements are especially sensitive to var- ious parameters of the test procedure. This paper provides estimates of front and rear seated SID dummy response meas- urement variability in four- door, 1990 Ford Taurus vehicles. Conclusions and recommendations from this controlled crash test program are made to provide guidance to help reduce the test- to- test variability of the test dummy responses. BACKGROUND RULEMAKING ACTIVITY - On January 27 and March 17, 1988, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) issued two Notices of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) on dynamic side impact testing for passenger cars: test procedure (1,2) and side impact dummy (SID) (3,4). The final rule for side impact dynamic testing of passenger cars was published October 30, 1990 (5-8). The final rule effective date is September 1, 1993. The rule bas- ically specifies a phase- in of 10% (Sep- tember 1, 1993), 25% (September 1, 1994), 40% (September 1, 1995) and 100% (Septem- ber 1, 1996) of total manufacturer passenger car volume. The performance requirements ( 5 ) are : Thoracic Trauma Index, TTI(d) , limit: Four- door passenger car - 85 g's Two-door passenger car - 90 głs Pelvic acceleration limit - 130 g's Additionally, the struck side doors shall not separate totally from the car. Any non- struck door (as well as a rear hatchback or tailgate) shall not disen- gage from the latched position. Neither the latch nor hinge system of non- struck doors shall separate or pull out of its anchorage . This paper will only concentrate on the test dummy responses. PREVIOUS RESEARCH - During 1985, the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association (MVMA) conducted a research program (9) using modified 1985 Ford LTDs to deter- mine the repeatability of the NHTSA-pro- posed full-vehicle test procedure and to investigate the ability of the full-vehi- cle tests to discriminate between changes in vehicle design which affect dummy re- sponses. A statistical analysis of the sixteen-vehicle crash test results (10) estimated the test- to- test variability of a Side Impact Dummy (SID) in the front seat. Table 1 presents the coefficients of variation from the MVMA program for the NHTSA-proposed test procedure and the SID dummy. The coefficient of variation * Numbers in parenthesis designate references at end of paper. 760</page><page sequence="2">(CV) is defined as a measure of the re- peatability of the SID dummy, response measurements. This test series only ad- dressed the performance of a front seated test dummy.

Statistical analyses of the sixteen- vehicle crash test results (11, 13) esti- mated the test- to- test variability in the front and rear seats. Table 2 presents the coefficients of variation from the program. The TTI(d) and pelvic accelera- tion CVs were for the SID dummy (13) . The rib and spine acceleration CVs (11) are confounded by the experimental design and objectives of the test program. The program evaluated SID versus EuroSID, NHTSA moveable deformable barrier (MDB) versus EEVC MDB, and crabbed cart versus non- crabbed cart impact. The MVMA during 1990 conducted another research program (14) using modi- fied 1990 Pontiac 6000 four- door cars to compare SID and BioSID (15) dummies in the front and rear seats and to investi- gate the dummies' ability to discriminate the effects of one type of padding. A statistical analysis of the twelve-vehi- cle crash test results (14) estimated the test- to- test variability of the SID dummy in the front and rear seats. Table 3 presents the coefficients of variation for the SID. One of the conclusions from the test program was that "The many dif- ferences between the front and rear seat position imply that the collision is much different in the two positions." (14) As can be seen from Tables 1-3, sig- nificant differences exist between front and rear test dummy response measurement variability. TEST PROGRAM A crash test program was conducted during December 1989 to provide another estimate of the test- to- test variability of the NHTSA-proposed side impact test procedure and to investigate the effects of various parameters on its unpredict- ability. Six 1990 Ford Taurus passenger cars with similar option content were purchased from existing dealer stock. These vehicles were crashed in accordance with the NHTSA-proposed dynamic side impact test procedure (1,2), except for modifications (explained in the following sections) that were made in an attempt to reduce the unpredictability of the SID dummy response measurements . The test parameters for each crash are presented in Appendix A. TEST VEHICLE - The 1990 Taurus L 4-door sedans were equipped with manual cloth split-bench front seats, 3.0 L electronic fuel injection (EFI) V6 engine, automatic overdrive transmission, P205/70R14 black sidewall (BSW) tires, rear window 761</page><page sequence="3">Table 2 Coefficients of Variation from JAMA Analysis (11, 13) CV (%) Response Measurement 1 Remarks Front Rear Thoracic Trauma Index (TTI(d)) 19.6 10.8 gj-p Pelvic Acceleration 5.2 2.1 Upper Rib Acceleration 14.3 17.0 SID/EuroSID Lower Rib Acceleration 23.6 1. nhxSA MDB/EEVC MDB Lower Spine Acceleration (T12) 9.8 11.6 Crabbed/Non- crabbed Upper Spine Acceleration (Tl) 5.8 12.7 Table 3 Coefficients of Variation for the SID from MVMA SID/BioSID Analysis (14) SID CV (%) Response Measurement i Front Rear Thoracic Trauma Index (TTI(d)) 8.7 8.2 Pelvic Acceleration 7.9 11 . 6 Upper Rib Acceleration 17 . 1 10 . 6 Lower Rib Acceleration 12.3 8.6 Lower Spine Acceleration (T12) 6.7 10.7 Upper Spine Acceleration (Tl) N/A 12.7 defroster, manual air conditioning, power doorlocks and manual windows. The front seat back angle was set at the design condition (24°). The nominal vehicle test weight was 3500 pounds (curb weight + 2 SID dummies + 300 lbs . rated cargo) . The vehicle weight was nominally distrib- uted 2000/1500 pounds on the front/rear axles (Table Al) . In order to obtain the desired test weight and weight distribu- tion, parts were removed, as required, from the engine compartment: alternator, water pump, fan and radiator. Table Al presents test vehicle weight parameters for the six tests. The test vehicle was impacted on its left side (driver side) . Information on the test vehicle ride height is presented in Table A2 . MOVEABLE DEFORMABLE BARRIER CART - The weight of the cart plus barrier face was 3037 pounds. Table A3 presents the impact speed and impact point locations on the test vehicle. The MDB cart used bias-ply tires inflated to 14-16 psi to decrease cart vertical oscillations. The cart tires and wheels were balanced as assemblies . DUMMY POSITIONING - The front seat SID dummy was positioned with the seat in the mid-point location of its seat track tra- vel. The Taurus front seat is a 60/40 762</page><page sequence="4">contoured split bench. A SAE J826 mani- kin drop on a calibrated measuring sur- face was used to establish the dummy position. The dummy position was center- ed within the front seat contour and was not centered on the steering wheel as specified in the NHTSA-proposed test pro- cedure. This was done to represent real- world occupant seating locations. Centering the SID in the front seat con- tour generally moved the SID 0.5 inches closer to the door trim than if the SID had been centered on the steering wheel. The rear seat dummy positioning followed the same procedure as for the front seat position with the test dummy assuming a position at the centerline of the rear seat outboard seating position contour. This position was generally found to be 0.7 inches closer to the door trim than if the SID had been positioned behind the front seat dummy centered on the steering wheel. Test dummy distances from the side of the vehicle were recorded for each crash test. Table A4 shows the distance from the door inner trim panel to the centerline of the SID rib cage, outer skin of SID arm, and outer skin of the SID pelvis. Comparing the rib cage and arm distances from the inner door trim in Table A4, it was noted that the SID rib cage can move substantially within the dummy jacket. This movement of the SID rib cage within its jacket affects the actual position of the SID in the test vehicle, thus, increasing the unpredict- ability of the test dummy responses. The front seated SID rib cage cen- terline- to -door distances averaged 14.27 inches with a range of 1.02 inches. The rear seated SID rib cage centerline- to- door distance averaged 14.22 inches with a range of 2.02 inches. The averages for both front and rear seated test dummies are essentially the same, however, the seating position variation for the rear seated test dummy is greater. This was due to the "subjectivity" associated with locating the centerline of the rear seat contour . The front seated SID pelvis skin- to-door distances averaged 6.8 inches with a range of 0.9 inches. The rear seated SID pelvis skin- to -door distances averaged 7.2 inches with a range of 2.2 inches. Similar to the SID rib cage centerline -to -door distances, the SID pelvis skin-to-door distance variation is greater for the rear seated test dummy than for the front seated test dummy. TEST RESULTS SID DUMMY RESPONSES - Four different SID dummies from two manufacturers (ARL and Humanetics) were used during the test program. The SIDs were unrestrained for this test program and were calibrated prior to each crash test. The SID cali- bration data are contained in Appendix B. The SID dummy response measurements con- sisted of the thorax and pelvic accelera- tions (PELV) . The SID thorax response data included accelerations measured at the upper spine (Tl) and lower spine (T12) and the upper (UR) and lower (LR) ribs on the impacted side of the dummy rib cage. Redundant lateral accelerome- ters were placed at all locations except Tl. All thorax and pelvic accelerations were filtered using the Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter (1,3,4). Table 4 presents the SID response measurements. The Thoracic Trauma Index (TTI(d)) was calculated from the primary SID dummy responses using the equation: TTI(d) - h [Peak Lower spine acceleration + Maximum of upper/lower rib accelerations ] Thus , TTI(d) - h [Peak(T12) + MAX(LR,UR) ] The SID response- time histories are presented in Appendix C.

The corridors shown on the figures were determined by computing, at each time interval, the mean and standard deviation (s) . The corridors using the mean ± one standard deviation approximate the corridors that bound the maximum and minimum acceleration data from the six tests . Each set of figures contains a "signal-to-noise" ratio-time history. At any given instant in time, the mean of the corridor can be treated as the "signal" and its corresponding standard deviation (half corridor width) as the "noise." The signal-to-noise ratio is indicative of the variability as a func- tion of time. The larger the signal-to- noise ratio, the lower the variability. The critical time is at the maximum dummy response. These signal-to-noise ratios were computed for the front and rear seated SID dummy response measurements in the time interval between 15 and 70 milliseconds . The signal-to-noise ratio is expressed as : Signal-to-noise Ratio (t) - "cv^tj DUMMY CONTACT TIME - In order to determine the time at which each dummy segment contacted the vehicle interior, contact switches were mounted on the SID pelvis (vertical strip at H-point) , the thigh (horizontal strip at H-point) , the ARM SWITCH ' ^ - PELVIC SWITCH N jr THIGH SWITCH UPPER &amp; LOWER RIB r-STOP SWITCHES SWITCH-, SWITCHES ; Section AA"ls!

These additional switches were located inside the rib cage on the rubber rib stop. The rubber rib stop is used to limit excessive rib cage compression and rotation. Figure 1 shows the placement of all contact switches. In general, the closure of a rib stop contact switch sig- nifies that the thorax has bottomed out.

This earlier pelvis- to- door contact is thought to be due to the greater door intrusion caused by the bumper section of the barrier face which is located at about the dummy pelvis height. However, the closure of the thigh switch for the rear seated SID dummy occurred earlier than the closure of the pelvis switch due to bending of the door caused by edge loading of the barrier. This indicates that the thigh was the primary load path for the lateral pelvic acceleration. This may have contributed to the wide variation in pelvic acceleration measure- ments. This type of loading is not addressed by the pelvic acceleration cal- ibration procedure. POST-CRASH STATIC DEFORMATION MEASUREMENT OF TEST VEHICLE SIDE STRUCTURE - Following the crash test each test vehicle's static deformation profile was obtained by dimensional anal- ysis on a calibrated measuring surface. Figures C16 - C18 in Appendix C show the static deformation profiles at the vehi- cle rocker, vehicle character line (approximately test dummy H-point height) and vehicle beltline heights, respec- tively. Figures C16 - C18 show the wide variation in static intrusion levels that occurred at the rear seated SID dummy's H-point location. This variation in intrusion levels combined with the impact on the test dummy thigh is in agreement with the poor predictability of rear seat test dummy pelvic acceleration measurements. TEST-TO-TEST VARIABILITY ESTIMATES The variability calculations for the SID dummy response measurements estimated from the test program are presented in Table 7. The data presented are the mean, standard deviation (s) , variance (s2) and coefficient of variation (CV) . The test- to- test variability of the front seated SID dummy response measure- ments is about the same as the two MVMA research programs (Tables 1 and 3) , and is lower than the variability seen in the JAMA research program (Table 2) . The rear seated SID dummy TTI(d) response measurement variability is lower than seen in the MVMA (Table 3) and JAMA (Table 2) programs. However, the varia- bility of the rear seated test dummy pel- vic acceleration measurement is 15.5 per- cent and is higher than seen in either the MVMA or JAMA test programs. It should be emphasized that the estimates of test-to-test variability reported here for the NHTSA side impact test procedure are only for one carline of one manufacturer tested at one test facility. The effects of test facility and carline are unknown. However, these estimates are indicative of high 766</page><page sequence="8">unpredictability associated with a rear seat SID pelvic acceleration measurement. EFFORTS TO IMPROVE TEST-TO-TEST VARIABILITY The authors , through experience gained from crash testing more than 80 vehicles using the NHTSA dynamic side impact test procedure, have found various parameters that contribute to the SID dummy response measurement variability. Each of these parameters are discussed in the following sections. LATERAL MDB IMPACT POINT ON TARGET VEHICLE - As the lateral impact point location becomes increasingly variable, the intrusion levels for the rear seat test dummy caused by edge loading of the MDB face also become increasingly vari- able. However, in this test series with the tightly controlled impact points, no correlation to impact point location has been attempted. In other test series where impact point variability was large, this has been shown to correlate directly with rear seat test dummy responses . The authors recommend a ± 1.0 inch MDB lateral impact point tolerance. VERTICAL IMPACT POINT TOLERANCE - Because the MDB cart has no suspension system, the MDB cart tire type and infla- tion pressure have a much greater effect on the bounce of the cart immediately before impact with the test vehicle. MDB cart bounce can alter the dynamic verti- cal impact point on the vehicle, thus affecting vehicle deformation and test dummy response measurements, thus con- tributing to test- to- test variability. For these tests, radial tires with 32 psi inflation pressures were shown to cause severe cart vertical oscillations which greatly affected the vertical hit point. Bias-ply tires with a 14-16 psi inflation pressure reduced the MDB cart bounce, thus controlling the MDB face vertical impact point to within ±0.1 inch. To illustrate the effect of vertical impact point sensitivity, a SID dummy was struck in a calibration setup two inches above the dummy H-point. Figure 2 pre- sents the results of this test compared to a normal pelvis calibration test. The effect on pelvic acceleration, assuming linearity, may be as large as 5.8 g/in ((48.2-36.6)/2) . The authors recommend a ± 0.25 inch vertical impact point tolerance. s .-I MAXIMUM » Gl. 49 at 14 .00 m s MINIMUM " -G.Q40 frZlZ^lZpZZ-žl'ilĶĶsi&amp;tlĪzzīī&amp;LzļlZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ. zzz: Ž'zz.zzjzzazzz zzzzz zzz:zzzzzzz zzzzz zzzzzzzzzzzz gj ůů jéis ¡LI- ZZ.IZÜ ZZ--Z.Z1-Z.-Z1.ZZZZ. o.

TIMŁ - ms Figure 2 Effect of Vertical Impact Height on Pelvic Acceleration BARRIER FACE-TO-TARGET VEHICLE SIDE STRUCTURE PERPENDICULARITY - The plan- view alignment angle between the MDB face -to -vehicle side structure also in- fluences test dummy response measure- ments. A non- perfect perpendicular angle tends to cause the stiff vertical edge of the barrier face to load the vehicle side structure unpredictably, thereby causing an unpredictable test dummy response measurement. The results of Ford test data indicate that one degree in MDB-to- vehicle alignment can be equated to approximately one inch of additional localized intrusion of the vehicle side structure, either at the front or rear. 767</page><page sequence="9">This is approximately a 10 percent reduc- tion in the crush distance before occu- pant contact. In frontal impacts there is approxi- mately 20 to 30 inches of crush distance available, but in side impacts only approximately 10 inches of crush distance is available before occupant contact. Thus, the barrier face -to -vehicle align- ment is more critical during side impact testing than for frontal crash testing. The edge loading of the barrier face results in concentrated loads on the test vehicle side structure rather than dis- tributed loading of the barrier face. The authors believe that the alignment angle between the barrier face and the vehicle side structure should be control- led as tightly as practicable. BARRIER FACE CRUSH STRENGTH - Testing and analysis have shown (Figure 3) that considerable variation exists in barrier face crush strength even though the bar- rier faces are certified by the supplier to meet NHTSA specifications (45 ±2.5 psi) . The data presented in Figure 3 are the average and range for all samples tested for each barrier face. The procedure followed the NHTSA aluminum honeycomb specification test procedure (16) . Four test samples were cut from the undistorted portions of each post- crash barrier face, tested, and their crush strength averaged for presen- tation. It should be noted that this procedure may not reflect the variability over the entire barrier face. The crush strength of the barrier faces used in the Taurus test program are shown in Table A3. The mean barrier face crush strength found from post- crash testing of samples during the series was 39.5 psi (softer than the NHTSA barrier face specifications) . The standard devi- ation for the series was 0.88 psi and the coefficient of variation was 2.24 per- cent. Thus, even though the barrier face crush strengths were outside of NHTSA' s specifications, and the full population of tested barrier faces showed the wide variability reflected in Figure 3, the barrier faces used during the Taurus test program happened to be relatively close to one another in crush strengths. How- ever, this close grouping of crush strengths was determined only after the test program was completed.

' 0) k. tt • Taurus Tests 30 0 Barrier Faces Tested 50 Barrier face crush strength can in- fluence the extent of intrusion into the side structure of the test vehicle during side collisions. A stiffer barrier face may result in more intrusion into the side structure of the test vehicle while sustaining less damage to itself. On the other hand, a softer barrier face may result in more barrier face damage (i.e., MDB absorbs more energy) and less intru- sion into the side structure of the test vehicle. For a given crash duration, more side structure intrusion may equate to higher door intrusion velocity. Thus, random variations in barrier face stiff- ness may result in random variation in door intrusion and intrusion velocity which, may in turn, result in unpredict- able and probably higher test dummy re- sponse measurements . Since the barrier face crush strength used in the Taurus test program are relatively closely grouped, it was not possible to determine a correlation. However, data from another series of 768</page><page sequence="10">crash tests are used to illustrate the effect of barrier face crush strength on test dummy response. Figure 4 shows the relationship, from this other test series, between the front and rear seat SID dummy pelvic acceleration and the crush strength of the barrier face. From Figure 4, the slopes, within the range shown, of the front and rear seat test dummy pelvic acceleration responses as a function of barrier face crush strength show opposite trends. Figure 5 shows the rear seat test dummy TTI(d) correlation. No correlation was found for the front seat test dummy TTI(d). Even though these correlations are small, they strongly indicate that test dummy respon- se measurements are related to the bar- rier face crush strength.

The barrier face supplier provides a sample with each lot of barrier faces delivered. The method used to expand the one inch thick sample provided by the supplier is different than the method used by the supplier to the expand the actual 15 inch thick barrier face. Therefore there is no way, prior to testing, to assure that the barrier face crush strength is within specification.

A proposed procedure would be to crush newly fabri- cated aluminum honeycomb material in a test fixture (e.g., Tinius-Olsen) suffi- ciently to overcome the crush initiation spike prior to assembly into the MDB face. The test fixture would be instru- mented with twenty- four individual load cells to determine barrier face crush strength uniformity. The crush strength of the barrier face would be determined between the one and two inch crush area. It is estimated that the honeycomb would need to be crushed two inches. The advantages of this procedure are to: 1) provide test facilities with barrier with measured and certified crush strength properties, including control of the ini- tial elastic deformation rate before the aluminum honeycomb material reaches its force plateau; and 2) ensure parallelism 769</page><page sequence="11">of the front and rear barrier face sur- faces to reduce the potential for barrier- face- to-vehicle- side- structure alignment problems. This pre-crush pro- cedure could reduce test- to- test varia- bility. TEST DUMMY POSITIONING - The NHTS A- pro- posed test dummy positioning procedure was found to be inadequate because it might place the test dummy in a location that is not realistic for some vehicle packages. This is of particular impor- tance because the test dummy- to- door- trim distance affects dummy response. This procedure was modified by NHTSA in the final rule (5). However, the modified dummy positioning procedure does not include a position tolerance and contains "subjectivity" in determining the center- line of a contoured seat, thus allowing test contractors to position the test dummy differently, as was seen even in the Taurus tests. This will lead to unpredictable test results and increased test-to-test variability. Figure 6 shows the correlation between the front and rear seat test dummy pelvic acceleration and test dummy positioning. The correlation with the rear seat SID is higher than for the front seat SID. However, both seating positions indicate a slight correlation with test dummy position. Figure 7 shows the correlation between the front and rear seat SID dummy TTI(d) and test dummy positioning. The front dummy seating position was found to indicate a correla- tion with TTI(d) (-5.9 g/in) . However, no correlation was indicated for the rear seat SID TTI(d). The correlations of the components that make up TTI(d) are shown in Figures 8 through 10. No correlations were found for the lower spine accelera- tion (T12) in either seating location. The upper rib (UR) acceleration indicated a correlation for the front seat SID (-16.3 g/in), but no correlation for the rear seat SID. The lower rib (LR) acceleration showed the same trends as for the upper rib (front test dummy; -10.7 g/in).

The trends of the remaining SID dummy response measurements with the initial dummy positioning are less appar- ent. From the previous figures, it is noted that the front seated SID dummy's pelvis, upper and lower rib accelerations and TTI(d) appear to be related to the initial position of the test dummy from the interior door trim. However for the rear seated SID dummy, only its pelvic acceleration appear to correlate with the initial SID position. These differences may be due to the different impact dynam- ics (interaction between test dummies and vehicle interior and barrier face with the vehicle) . The front door deformation profile was caused by the flat center section of the barrier face. Consequently, the front seated test dummy is struck in an almost true lateral direction by the intruding door. The rear door, which was initially struck by the right hand corner of the stiff MDB face bumper (nominally 245 psi), formed a vertical fold-line in the side view which moved progressively along the side of the rear door as the crabbed cart slid towards the rear of the test vehicle. Due to bending of the door caused by edge loading of the barrier face, the SID rotates about its vertical axis . Thus the T12 , upper and lower rib lateral accelerometers measure accelera- tions which do not reflect the true force acting on the test dummy. The variabil- ity in these off- axis measurements for the rear seat test dummy contribute to the unpredictability of its responses. The authors believe that the test dummy should be positioned at the manu- facturers' Designated Seating Position. This location would be determined in the test vehicle by measuring from the vehi- cle centerline to the centerline of the test dummy with a suggested tolerance of ±0.5 inch . 771</page><page sequence="13">TEST DUMMY CALIBRATION - The SID dummy pelvic acceleration calibration corridor width, which varies from 40 to 60 g' s , is of itself a contributor to test-to-test variability. The 20 g corridor width allows the possibility of calibrating at the lower or upper level of the range and influencing the actual test measurement by this lower or higher built-in bias. Figure 11 shows the correlation of rear seat test dummy pelvic acceleration with actual dummy calibrations. The data used in the figure are from Appendix B for the repeat calibration condition, since this condition most represented the test dummy prior to the crash test. A regression analysis (Table 8, based on Figures 6 and 11) considering SID pelvic acceleration calibration and SID position in the rear seat indicates that pelvic acceleration may vary as much as 50.6 g's (20 g's X 2.53 g/g's) in crash tests, even though the test dummy was within the permissible calibration range. Varia- tions of this magnitude are a direct result of the width of the test dummy calibration corridor. Figure 11 Pelvic Acceleration Correlation 160 1 r - □ Rear Dummy ' r2 - .68 ?

TEST DUMMY DURABILITY - Deterioration of the SID dummy arm foam due to cumula- tive cellular structural damage will occur as a result of repeated impacts. This deterioration may cause the arm foam stiffness to decrease. Similar effects have also been noted for the rib wrap- ping. MULTIPLE REGRESSION ANALYSIS A multiple regression analysis (Table 8) for the rear seat test dummy pelvic acceleration measurement shows the estimated test- to- test variability when the SID positioning and calibration con- ditions are considered. Referring to Table 7, the rear seat test dummy pelvic acceleration standard deviation is 17.1. When the test dummy position and pelvic acceleration calibration are used as a predictor, 85 percent of the total varia- tion is explained by the multiple regres- sion model. The standard deviation based on this model (s«8.645) is about half of the total (8.645/17.1 - .506). CONCLUSIONS The test- to- test coefficient of var- iation found from the s ix- Taurus crash test program for the front seat SID dummy's TTI(d) and pelvic acceleration were 5.0 and 8.3 percent, respectively. The rear seat SID dummy's TTI(d) and pel- vic acceleration CV 's were 6.3 and 15.5 percent , respectively . Incorporating the output of the mul- tiple regression model (Table 8) , the rear seat pelvic acceleration variability is reduced approximately by half and it becomes comparable to the front pelvic variability (s - 9.3 g's). Using 9.3 g's as an estimate of the population standard deviation, the 3 sigma range about the mean (mean ± 3 sigma) covers more than 99 772</page><page sequence="14">Table 8 Pelvic Acceleration As a Function of Test Dummy Position and Calibration Multiple Regression: rpl - 73.0 - 12.6 rHd +2.53 cal Predictor Coefficient Standard Deviation t- ratio rHd -12.599 5.031 -2.50 cal 2.532 0.969 2.61 r2- .847 s - 8.645 where: rpl - rear seat test dummy pelvic acceleration (gfs) rHd - Pelvis- to-Door inner panel distance (in.) cal - Test dummy pelvic acceleration calibration value (g's) percent of the population. In other words to cover 99 percent of the popula- tion around the mean, the estimated spread is 27.9 g's (3 x 9.3), which is large . The variations in door intrusion and in the SID inboard/outboard initial seat- ing position suggest the presence of a wide variation in the door- to- SID contact velocity. While variation in the post crash relative door intrusion does not affect the SID pelvic acceleration meas- urements per se, contact velocity varia- tion caused by intrusion rate differences combined with occupant position differ- ences may influence occupant pelvic acceleration measurement unpredictabil- ity. The variation in door intrusion and intrusion velocity have been found to be influenced by: 1. The extent of MDB drift from its intended hit-point on the test vehicle . 2. The MDB yaw rotation prior to impact (MDB face- to- target vehicle side perpendicularity) . 3. The MDB main segment honeycomb face crush strength. 4. The variation in the MDB initial impact vector (e.g., crabbed angle, speed, MDB yaw angle, MDB tire bounce , etc . ) . 5. Vehicle- to- vehicle structural vari- ation. The wide variation in the rear seated SID dummy initial inboard/outboard seating position (range of one inch ver- sus 2 inches for the front and rear SID dummy, respectively) also affects the SID-to-door contact velocity and contrib- utes to the unpredictability of its per- formance . The rear seated SID's kinematics are influenced by the SID position relative to the corner of the barrier face at impact. RECOMMENDATIONS As a result of this test program and past test experience, various aspects of the test procedure and SID test dummy have been shown to affect test- to- test variability. Remembering that these con- clusions are drawn for only one car- line/test facility, the following pro- cedure/facility recommendations are pro- vided. 773</page><page sequence="15">1. The lateral vehicle impact point tolerance should be controlled to ± 1.0 inch or less. 2. The vertical impact point should be controlled to ± 0.25 inch or less. 3. The perpendicularity between the MDB face and the vehicle side structure should be controlled as tightly as practicable . 4. The barrier faces should be precrushed 2.0 inches by the sup- plier prior to crash testing to pro- vide a verification of barrier face crush strength, reduce initial spike variability, and ensure parallelism of front and rear surfaces of the barrier face. 5. The test dummy should be positioned within the vehicle with a tolerance of ± 0.5 inch from its Designated Seating Position as measured from the vehicle centerline. 6. The SID dummy's thorax and pelvic calibration corridor widths should be as narrow as practicable (e.g., 10 g's) . ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The authors wish to acknowledge Mr. A. N.
