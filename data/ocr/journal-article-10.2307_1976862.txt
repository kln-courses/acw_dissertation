Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 1949. xiv+:88 pp. $5.00. The American pragmatic movement began at the time when Darwin's views on evolution were just coming before the world. Its representatives took a special interest in evolution, because of their dissatisfaction with the absolute idealism which had dominated the atmosphere of</page><page sequence="2">342 JOURNAL OF HIGHER EDUCATION thought for a good half-century in Germany, had spread to England, and was beginning to influence America. Absolutism seemed to them to tie the universe into too close a unity; and the priority of mind was taken as too anthropomorphic and subjectivistic a view. What the pragmatist group wanted was more disconnected pluralism and more objective naturalism. The movement began in a circle of brilliant men in Cambridge who had formed themselves into an informal Metaphysical Club, referred to a number of times by Charles S. Pierce. In the group, besides Pierce, were Chauncey Wright, William James, John Fiske, Nicholas St. John Green, 0. W. (later Justice) Holmes, Joseph Warner, and Francis E. Abbot. To each of the first six a chapter is devoted. Appendix G is a biographical sketch of Warner. Abbot is mentioned here and there in connection with the others. Wright, a mathematician and astro- nomical computer, was a defender of the recently presented evolutionary theory of Darwin, and maintained that science is entirely neutral toward all particular philosophical systems. Yet he did not remain indifferent toward the ethical social issues of the time. Pierce was an applied scientist and a logician, but he was touched with an interest in meta- physics and even theology which some of the other members of the circle lacked. Yet he would answer all questions even here by appeal to experience and the methods o science. James saw in the doctrine a formula- tion of the spontaneous individual varia- tion in life, which is not pinned down by any scientific formula, but makes its way by experiment here and there, adopting whatever way of looking at experience works best. Fiske found evo- lution a basis for an optimistic gospel of universal progress, which led to his cosmic philosophy, and which he turned to the interpretation of human history, including religion and politics. Green's work was in the teaching and interpretation of the law, where he used the istorical approach more than the analytic, which had been prevalent before, as an aid to an inductive interpretation, and as a means of keeping in touch with the social and empirical conditions in which it operates. This was exempli- fied in his emphasis upon proximate versus remote causes. Holmes was in close touch, through correspondence, with professional philos- ophers. He professed himself tem- peramentally opposed to metaphysical interpretation; yet his outlook upon life was distinctly philosophical, con- cerned with life's deepest questions and its cosmic background. Law he regarded as rooted in all experience and history, not merely in logic; and he had a faith in cumulative progress as the result of experience, although results at any moment are tentative. Warner, also a lawyer, reacted against German idealism, and lauded Holmes's utilitarian and evolutionary view of right and wrong. Consequences to soci- ety are more basic in legal judgments than intent on the part of the accused. Abbot was a radical theologian, inter- ested in a positivistic religion of evolution. He left the Unitarian ministry to gain more freedom. The final legacy of the group was a point of view expressing pluralistic empiricism, temporalism, relativism, prob- abilism, and fallibilism, with secular democratic individualism. These were expressed in connection with the special interests of each of the several thinkers. The book is a valuable study in the origins of pragmatism, but it is marked by sympathy more than impartiality in many of its estimates. Numerous atti- tudes claimed as pragmatic are acknowl- edged equally by thinkers not using the name. ALBERT E. AVEY Ohio State University</page></plain_text>
