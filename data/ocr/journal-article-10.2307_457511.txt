<plain_text><page sequence="1">XVII THE ECLECTICISM OF RABELAIS* PART I. SURVEY 1. INTRODUCTION A MONG the writers who express for all countries and time the thoughts, aspirations, and temper of their age is Rabelais.' In his day many fundamental questions were mooted. The sixteenth century debated ever and again these among others: the nature and immortality of the soul, the eternity of the world, miracles, God, Nature, Providence, Destiny. On all these questions Rabelais expressed himself, at times enig- matically, it is true, but in a form that has outlived the treatises of the professional philosophers and theologians of the period, of a Pomponazzi, a Vicomercato, a Cardan, a Bodin, and even a Calvin. A generation of intensive study of Rabelais and his work has brought little progress in unraveling the fundamental problems his romance presents. To some he continues to be an enigma,2 * The writer takes pleasure in making acknowledgment of his indebtedness in the preparation of this paper to Mr. Archer Taylor, of the University of Chicago, and Mr. Richard T. Holbrook, of the University of California, who have read it in their editorial capacity and made many suggestions as to its form, and to Mr. Louis Cons, of Princeton University, for suggestions as to content, all of which have resulted in its material improvement. However, the writer assumes entire responsibility for the opinions presented in this investiga- tion on the religious and philosophical views of Rabelais. The italics used throughout this paper are the writer's. Arthur Tilley, Francois Rabelais, 1907, p. 11: "He is the embodiment of the early French Renaissance in its earlier and fresher manifestations, in its devotion to humanism, in its restless and many-sided curiosity, in its robust enthusiasm, in its belief in the future of the human race." 2 Emile Faguet, Le Seizieme siecle, n.d., p. 77: "Les critiques, les professeurs de litterature, les conf6renciers et les simples causeurs ont toujours ete em- barrasses en presence de Rabelais et de son ceuvre. C'est une 6nigme." Charles Lenient, La Satire en France au seizieme siecle, 3d. ed. 1886, p. 62, presents the traditional views: "Les uns n'ont vu dans son ceuvre qu'une debauche d'im- agination, un pele-mele confus de boufonneries et de trivialit6s, ofi brillent, ga et IA, a travers les fumees de l'ivresse et les d6lires de la fantaisie, quelques rares eclairs de genie, d'eloquence et de raison. Les autres, par esprit d'opposi- tion ont pr6tendu trouver dans ce d6sordre meme un plan habilement congu, une combinaison ing6nieuse pour cacher la profondeur de la pens6e et se derober ainsi aux poursuites de ses ennemis." 339</page><page sequence="2">N. H. CLEMENT while others, who dismiss him too lightly, fail to experience any difficulty in plumbing the depths of his thought.3 In recent years several attempts have been made to ascertain his true beliefs,4 but none of these investigations has been searching enough. The purpose of the present study is to inquire once more into Rabelais' religious and philosophical opinions, and to set forth his views on the questions just enumerated. Notwithstanding the words to the contrary of such an eminent scholar and critic as Emile Faguet,5 Rabelais is, and very likely will continue to be, an enigma. The present inquiry, it may be stated at the outset, undertakes little more than to show the extent of Rabelais' participation in the ideas current in his time in matters of philosophy and religion. It will show that Rabelais felt an abiding interest in these questions, that he discussed them frequently, but it will not succeed in extract- ing from his work views which can in all cases be attributed with certainty to him as his own, nor a formally and consistently formulated personal doctrine and creed. Faguet, ibid.: "Mais il n'est que de dire naivement, ffit-ce a sa honte, ce que l'on pense, et je ne trouve nulle enigme, et sinon nulle profondeur, du moins nul abtme, dans Rabelais." ' Jean Plattard, Revue des Etudes Rabelaisiennes, VIII at p. 321, sees in Rabelais a "Fabrician," i.e., a sympathizer with the moderate Reformist views of Lefevre d'Etaples; Abel Lefranc, in Revue de France, May 1922, pp. 327 ff. argues he is a materialist. Henri Busson, in Les Sources et le developpement du rationalisme dans la litterature frangaise de la Renaissance, (1533-1601), 1922, a scholarly and illuminating work which will frequently be quoted in the course of this study, examines his religious views, and though his conclusions are usually well-founded, his investigation is not sufficiently embracing. Not only have many important passages escaped his scrutiny, but he has not touched upon the most important problem of all, Rabelais' notion of the Deity. A. F. Chappell's The Enigma of Rabelais, 1924, in the writer's opinion leaves the question intact. s In the Prologue of Gargantua Rabelais says: "Car en icelle [the lecture of the book] bien aultre goust trouverez et doctrine plus absconce, laquelle vous revelera de treshaultz sacremens et mysteres horrificques, tant en ce qui concere nostre religion que aussi l'estat politicq et vie ceconomique." Accord- ing to Faguet this is a mystification; Rabelais here is only laughing at his readers, and there is nothing abstruse in his book; it is only an amusing story, written in his odd moments to divert himself and his patients. His philosophy is merely the expression of ordinary common sense. It is neither original, nor profound, nor even very useful. Arthur Tilley, in Francois Rabelais, 1907, chap. 11, combats Faguet's view; see, however, the chapter "Follow Nature" in his Studies in the French Renaissance, 1922. 340</page><page sequence="3">THE ECLECTICISM OF RABELAIS At this juncture one may note special difficulties besetting this inquiry which inhibit the cautious investigator from lightly making dogmatic assertions: First, after the publication of Pantagruel, Rabelais became suspect to the Sorbonne, the watchdog of orthodoxy, and for self-protection was put to the necessity in his subsequent Books of concealing his views.6 To this must be attributed the ob- scurity of numerous passages in his romance, which are difficult and often impossible of interpretation. Second, his views do not appear whole and entire in any one of his five Books, but progressively develop through all of them, though the old that he has cast off is carried along side by side with the new. Third, like the men of the Renaissance, Rabelais revels in quotations and citations. He quotes and cites as much for the pleasure and amusement he derives from these displays of erudition as in order to buttress his own opinions. This is the artistic and humanistic aspect of his genius. Accordingly, care needs to be exercised in distinguishing the serious from the merely decorative, both in the opinions he expresses as his own and in those he credits to his sources. In addition, Rabelais is a last representative of the esprit gaulois of the Middle Ages. When he mingles buffoonery and obscenity with sacred things one must be cautious in deciding whether his intent is primarily to be derisive, or whether he is merely imitating the mediaeval writers who readily mingled the grossest irreverence with orthodox beliefs. Fourth, it is difficult, not to say impossible, to decide how far he availed himself of the cloison etanche doctrine of the Paduan School: religion and philosophy possess distinct spheres absolutely independent of each other, and propositions from the two spheres that may appear mutually exclusive are per- fectly valid in their proper spheres.7 6 See Ernest Renan, Averroes et I'averroisme, 3d. ed. 1866, pp. 359 ff. 7 See Renan, pp. 359-360. Though this opposition between faith and philosophy existed long before and after the Paduan School, the Paduans placed a special emphasis on it. In this opposition Renan sees only a subterfuge on the part of the free-thinkers to excuse their daring in the sight of the theo- logians. Others explain this double attitude on the ground that the Paduans really felt uncertain in the face of the two kinds of certainty, the philosophical and the theological. See J. Roger Charbonnel, La Pensee italienne, 1919, 341</page><page sequence="4">N. H. CLEMENT Fifth, as will appear in the course of this study, Rabelais is an Eclectic. In him we find primarily an amalgam of Scepticism, Epicureanism, and Stoicism, with strains of Aristotelianism, Averroism, and Neoplatonism. It is not always easy to assign definitely to any specific school the philosophic doctrines found in such a fusion in Rabelais.8 Sixth, the perennial question of the authenticity of the Fifth Book arises here to disconcert the investigator. At the present time a majority of the students of Rabelais are strongly inclined to accept, with certain qualifications, the ascription of this Book to Rabelais. The writer shares their view and the evidence furnished by the Fifth Book will be embodied in this study.9 pp. 273-274. At p. 494 Charbonnel thus states the question: "La supreme v6rit6 se confond avec Dieu. Mais il y a deux moyens de l'atteindre, ou si l'on veut il y a deux aspects sous lesquels il est 6galement legitime de la con- templer. La philosophie voit Dieu dans la nature; la th6ologie le voit en dehors et au-dessus de ce monde. La philosophie part de l'immanence du divin, la theologie de sa transcendance. Ce sont 1 deux methodes qui s'appliquent d une r6alit6: Dieu consider6 tant6t dans les manifestations de son activite qui vivifie et de sa providence qui conserve, tant6t dans l'unite absolue de son essence qui echappe A toute definition et a toute figuration. I1 importe donc que la philosophie et la th6ologie se gardent d'empieter trop souvent sur leur domaine respectif." 8 For the syncretism of the doctrines of the ancient schools see Francois Picavet, Esquisse d'une histoire generale et comparee des philosophies mnzditvales, 2nd. ed., 1907, pp. 86-88. 9 The writer wishes in the following note to restate with more precision the views he expressed in his monograph, The Influence of the Arthurian Romances on the Five Books of Rabelais, 1926, pp. 167-9. Arthur Tilley (Studies in the French Renaissance, 1922) reviews the question of "Rabelais and the Fifth Book" and reaches the following chief conclusions: 1) the whole of the Ile Sonnante (chapters 1-15) was written by Rabelais and handed over to the printer as he left it; 2) the rest of the Fifth Book is in the main Rabelais' work, but in several of the chapters there are interpolations, notably in chapters 18, 20, 26-28; 4) but though the Fifth Book is in the main by Rabelais, it clearly does not represent his final intentions; 5) some of the chapters (16, 31, and possibly 18) he left unfinished; 6) other chapters he left in the form of a rough draft which he had not worked up into an artistic shape. Such are chapters 11, 29, 30 and 35. Tilley might have included chapter 9, the most baffling chapter in Rabelais. The present writer in a large measure agrees with Tilley, but he wishes to suggest the following additions. He sees three distinct parts in the Fifth Book: 1) chapters 1-15, which are Rabelais' and untouched by his collaborator; 2) chapters 30-43, which are distinctly Rabelaisian in style and thought; 3) chapters 16-29, which certainly do not exhibit Rabelais' recognized style 342</page><page sequence="5">THE ECLECTICISM OF RABELAIS The writer will, in the first part of this study, survey the question of Rabelais' religious and philosophical views as a and represent a gap, as it were, in his thought. Since all scholars agree in attributing chapters 1-15 to Rabelais, nothing need here be said about them. The writer believes chapters 30-43 also are substantially Rabelais' for the following reasons: a) they dovetail perfectly with Books III and IV in that they bring to a well-rounded conclusion the Grail-quest idea foreshadowed in Book III and developed in its initial aspects in Book IV; b) they show a con- sistent and logical development in Rabelais' religious and philosophical views as they appear in Book III; c) in many minor respects they cohere too well with the preceding Books to be the work of a continuator: chapters 30-31, the "Pays de Satin," are foreshadowed by the expression "pays de satin" of IV, 8; chapters 32-33 (including the one Moland prints as chapter 33 bis) are announced by the expressions "c'est langaige lanternois" of II, 9, the "pays Lanternois" of IV, 5, and "a son retour de Lanternois" of IV, 8; the selection, in chapter 33 bis, of the "lantern" of Pierre Lamy, the friend of Rabelais' youth, "laquelle j'avois autrefois cognue d bonnes enseignes," to conduct the questers to the oracle of the Holy Bottle is here of the greatest significance. Tilley's discussion may be read for additional examples. There remain chapters 16-29, which, in the writer's opinion, are the really problematic ones. As already said, they are obviously different from Rabelais' usual manner and show an interrup- tion in the development of his thought. The second point, it is freely confessed, is of slight validity. Even the most careless reader, however, cannot fail to notice the flatness and dullness of these fourteen chapters. True enough, there are flat and dull passages in other portions of Rabelais' work, but not extending over fourteen consecutive chapters. These chapters may be accounted for according to two hypotheses: 1) they are a very rough draft by Rabelais, perhaps with interpolations by a later hand,-Tilley's second conclusion; 2) they are by a later hand, but follow closely a well-marked plan by Rabelais. The writer believes such a plan existed. In IV, 1, the author says: "[Ils] firent le voyage de Indie sup6rieure en moins de quatre mois," a time limit which is strictly observed. Pantagruel and his companions set sail on June 7, and on July 29, 1546,-fifty-two days later-the Council of Trent was held,-in Lantern-land, according to Rabelais. Of this council he says, in IV, 5: "si lors y arrivions (comme facile nous estoit) voyrions belle, honorable, et joyeuse com- pagnie des Lanternes." Finally in IV, 1, we learn that Xenomanes "avoit A Gargantua, laisse et sign6, en sa grande et universelle hydrographie, la route qu'ils tiendroient. .... " (See the writer's discussion in The Influence etc., pp. 170-171.) These passages seem to indicate clearly enough that Rabelais composed the last two Books-the journey to the Holy Bottle-with a carefully drawn plan before his eyes. All his collaborator needed to do was to amplify his rough indications. The writer is of the opinion that there was a collaborator, and he agrees with Mr. Louis Cons (Revue bleue, April 25, 1914) that this collaborator may well have been Jean Quentin. According to this hypothesis, Rabelais composed the first and the last of the three parts of Book V first and the middle part was to be put in definitive shape subsequently. Of course, this is a practice not unknown among writers. 343</page><page sequence="6">N. H. CLEMENT whole, and bring into the foreground the many problems it presents; in the second part he will set forth the principal religious and philosophical controversies of the sixteenth century, and attempt to fix Rabelais' position on the issues so warmly discussed in his day. 2. RABELAIS' BACKGROUND Two major currents of thought are discernible in the Renais- sance: First, a reaction against ecclesiastical authority in thought and against asceticism in life. This reaction was synchronous with the growth and spread of humanism and the "return to nature" movement which it sponsored; Second, an effort to harmonize the philosophy of the ancients with Christian doctrines, to show that the two were not in- compatible, but on the contrary that the teachings of Christi- anity were buttressed by the philosophy of the Greeks and Romans.l0 These new impulses penetrated into France from Italy in the wake of the literary and artistic Renaissance. Soon after 1530 the revival of philosophic thought was under way in France, and by 1540 all the great schools of the Ethical Period of Greek philosophy numbered adherents. Peripateticism, the traditional school, continued to maintain itself, but largely in the form given it by the Paduan School" and its leader Pomponazzi, 10 The most successful of these attempts was the one that sought to reconcile Christianity and the moral doctrines of the Stoics, especially of Seneca. This was the task that Justus Lipsius, especially, and Guillaume Du Vair set them- selves to in the second half of the sixteenth century. See Leontine Zanta, La Renaissance du stoicisme au seizieme sicle, 1914. The Stoic doctrine of self- government was involved in this connection and eventually led to a lay as distinguished from a Church morality. 11 Opinion is divided as to when the rationalistic ideas of the Paduan School first began to penetrate into France. Emile Besch wants to set the date as late as 1550. He says (Revue du Seizieme Siecle, VI, at p. 28): "L'humanisme en vulgarisant la litt6rature et la philosophie antique avait donn6 [about 1550] aux intelligences d'elite une certaine toumure qui les inclinait au rationalisme." Busson, Introduction, p. xiv, wants to put the date back to 1533: "Dans les dix annees qui suivent 1533, les disciples des philosophes de Padoue et les Italiens eux-memes apportent en France les idees rationalistes. Pourtant ces idees ne sont pas encore tr/s repandues, puisque ni Rabelais dans ses deux premiers livres, ni Des Periers dans le Cymbalum ne semblent les connaitre." 344</page><page sequence="7">THE ECLECTICISM OF RABELAIS the heirs of the Averroists of the thirteenth century.12 The School of Plato, recently reestablished by Marsilio Ficino, and welcomed by the apologists of Christianity as their ally,'3 was intent upon disputing the claims to supremacy of its old and successful rival.14 Epicureanism, Pyrrhonism,l5 and Stoicism Pierre Villey, Marot et Rabelais, 1923, pp. 189-190, seems to be in accord with Busson: "Apres les placards, les bfchers, et l'Institution chretienne, vers 1538- 1540, un parti rationaliste levera la tete. Le Cymbalum mundi traduira ses aspirations. II comptera notamment des humanistes qui, decourages de la defaite des 6vangelistes moderes, se detachent plus ou moins completement de l'Evangile. Je crois avec Calvin que Rabelais sera de ceux-la." 12 The chief doctrines of the School of Padua were: a) the separation of reason and faith; b) a sceptical attitude toward the problem of the immortality of the soul; c) a belief in the eternity of the world; d) a disbelief in miracles, Providence, and the efficacy of prayer; e) belief in natural law in lieu of celestial intelligences ruling the world; f) the unity of the intellect, that is, there is only one active intellect (voOs, mens, mind or soul) in the universe, which is impersonal, absolute, separable from the individual, and participated in by all individuals, and this intellect is ultimately God himself, wherefore by death each individual's part is reintegrated into the Deity, and loses its identity; g) religion was invented to hold the ignorant in subjugation. 13 Busson, pp. 173-174, makes the point that a philosophical religion became necessary in order to combat the incredulity of the Paduans, and this philo- sophical religion was Platonism, under the more modern guise of Neoplatonism, which emphasized the supernatural and had some affinity with Christianity. On the connection between the philosophy of Plato and the supernatural, see William Lecky, The Rise and Influence of Rationalism in Europe, 1913 ed., I, passim, especially pp. 18, 298. 14 Peripateticism had been definitely enthroned in the thirteenth century after its espousal by Albertus Magnus and St. Thomas Aquinas, when Platonism, whence the early Church Fathers had largely drawn inspiration, was on the wane. See Frederick D. Maurice, Medieval Philosophy, 2nd ed., 1859, chap. v, ??8-64. 15 True Pyrrhonism may be summed up in the three following axioms: a) we can know nothing as to the nature of things, and whatever property may be attributed to a thing its opposite may be predicated of it with equal justice; b) hence the right attitude towards things is to withhold judgment and to act, since act we must, according to probability, nature, and custom; c) the neces- sary result of suspended judgment is ataraxia, or imperturbability. Only the man who has suspended all judgment can guard against all error and is in a position to regard things with absolute calmness unruffled by passion or desire. By thus withdrawing within himself one attains happiness, which is the goal of all philosophy. In France Pyrrhonism found its highest expression in Mon- taigne, who shows in his celebrated Apologie de Raymond Sebonde, (II, 12) that while reason can justify anything, it can prove nothing. We can believe, but we cannot know; consequently religious beliefs depend exclusively on faith. 345</page><page sequence="8">N. H. CLEMENT were still in the background; they were to fight their way to the front only in the second half of the sixteenth and in the seventeenth century. The reaction against ecclesiasticism and asceticism was closely connected both with the spread of the rationalism of the Paduans and the "follow nature" (sequere naturam) doctrine of the Epicureans and the Stoics. The primary aim of the rationalistic movement of the six- teenth and seventeenth centuries was the separation of reason and faith. In the Middle Ages theology had bound philosophy, especially Peripateticism, to itself as a handmaid whose ex- clusive task it was to help establish rationally the dogmas it formulated. This union of theology and philosophy resulted in Scholasticism, with the fundamental premise that far from there being a conflict between reason and faith the two were in perfect agreement. The great philosophical problem of the Renaissance was to effect a divorce between the two, to make them co6rdinate in rank, and to assure to each free expansion in its proper sphere.'6 A similar movement attempted in the thirteenth century had sought to effect this separation by pitting creed against creed in order to discredit them, Christi- anity and its parent, Judaism, against Mohammedanism. The sixteenth century found in the philosophy of the ancients, just then beginning to be known, a far more formidable instrument in this cause. A conflict could not fail to arise between the new spirit so deeply colored with the thought of pagan antiquity, and that of the preceding centuries, thoroughly impregnated, as it was, with the ideas and beliefs of medieval Christianity, in brief, between Authority and Reason. The representatives of the new spirit insisted upon using the reason instead of faith or authority in the search after truth.l7 This is the distinct 16 This is the end that the Averroism of the Paduan School served, which, insignificant as a system of philosophy, yet was a potent weapon in the fight to reclaim the independence of the reason. The struggle of the Renaissance was already foreshadowed by the conflict between Religion and Reason, Theology and Philosophy, initiated by the Averroists of the thirteenth century. This conflict resulted in complete religious scepticism, and the thirteenth century was the century of incredulity par excellence. See Renan, pp. 279-281. 17 Cf. the manuscript passage omitted in the 1564 edition of Book V: " .... rechercher et investiger, comme est le naturel des humains. ... " 346</page><page sequence="9">THE ECLECTICISM OF RABELAIS complexion of the rationalism of the sixteenth century.18 This species of rationalism has two aspects: (a) it is philosophical when it goes beyond the limits of experience in order to grasp at the truth lying beyond; (b) it is practical when it limits itself to the known facts of existence.l9 These two forms will in the seventeenth century be known respectively as the raison of Descartes and the bon sens of Boileau. The Peripateticism of the Paduans found a powerful auxiliary in its struggle against the old scholastic philosophy in the "nature philosophy" of the Epicureans and the Stoics. The teachings of St. Augustine, with his theory of human depravity, had colored the life and the thought of the Middle Ages and deeply impressed them with the idea of the sinfulness of man. The future life and personal salvation became as a result the first concerns of the men of medieval times (cf. the Divine Comedy). The "return to nature" movement resulted in a shift of emphasis from the future to the present life. 18 There are many varieties of rationalism, but in its widest sense-the one in the text above-rationalism is any system of thought which uses reason in the search after truth. For an exposition of rationalism in all its nuances, see L. Olle-Laprune, La Raison et le rationalisme, 1906, pp. 164-179. Lecky, The Rise etc., Introduction, p. xix, defines it as "a certain cast of thought, orb ias of reasoning, which.... leads men on all occasions to subordinate dogmatic theology to the dictates of reason and of conscience, and, as a necessary conse- quence, greatly to restrict its influence upon life. It predisposes men, in history, to attribute all kinds of phenomena to natural rather than miraculous causes; in theology, to esteem succeeding systems the expressions of the wants and aspirations of that religious sentiment which is implanted in all men; and in ethics to regard as duties only those which conscience reveals to be such." Olle-Laprune, p. 178, says that all forms of rationalism may be defined as the doctrine whereby one sees in man only reason, and in reason only man. The second part of this definition amounts to saying that rationalism avoids the transcendental. Busson, p. xi, note 1, wishes to qualify this definition. He says: "II y a un rationalisme orthodoxe, puisque l'Eglise reconnait le r6le de la raison dans la genese de l'acte de foi: l'heresie contraire est le fideisme .... Mais l'Eglise reconnait que certains de ses dogmes sont indemontrables. C'est etre rationaliste que de vouloir les prouver par la raison, mais avec l'intention de les defendre, comme l'a pr6tendu toute une 6cole (Nicholas de Cusa, Ray- mond de Sebonde et Postel). Cette forme du rationalisme est aussi h6r6tique." Busson defines true rationalism as: "la pr6tention de juger, et non plus de prouver, tous les faits religieux a la mesure de la seule raison et de ne croire que ceux qui r6sisteront a ce contr6le." This is the meaning now current. 19 Zanta, p. 76. 347</page><page sequence="10">N. H. CLEMENT Zeno's doctrine of "life according to Nature," though shared by the Epicureans, was chiefly associated with the Stoic sect. The doctrine was interpreted to include both universal nature and the nature peculiar to each individual. In this double aspect it was taken over by the Roman Eclectics (Cicero, Seneca) and transmitted through them to the Renaissance, when it played an important role in the development of human- ism. By the beginning of the sixteenth century the doctrine had become generally current and is frequently found opposed to Christian ascetic teachings.20 Rabelais with his robust enthusiasm and his optimistic view both of individual and universal nature was eminently fitted to exalt into a position of new importance the doctrine of "follow nature." He accomplished this for individual nature in his first two Books, but chiefly in his Theleme where it is enthroned; in the apologue of Physis and Antiphysie (IV, 32), and in general in the last three Books, he apotheosizes universal Nature, which he celebrates, in III, 8, as the beneficent creator and sustainer of all living things. 3. RABELAIS' LIFE AND WORKS In tracing the evolution of Rabelais' thought a threefold division must be made in his life: (1) the period up to the end of 1534; (2) an interlude extending over eleven years, up to 1545; (3) the final period of maturity, from 1545 to his death in 1553. In the first period Pantagruel (1532) and Gargantua (1534) appeared; the second period is unmarked by any literary activity, properly so called; the third is the period of the Third, Fourth, and Fifth Books. In the first period Rabelais is still a Christian, but with strong frondeur tendencies. In his middle period he made several journeys to Italy, where he possibly became acquainted with the doctrines of the Paduan School, and in France he came in contact with its representatives, who were, in effect, libres penseurs. In these years he consorted with the libertin group of Lyons, which was constituted soon after 1530 and was com- posed of Maurice Sceve, Dolet, and Fournier, and with the Bordeaux group which is known to have been in existence by 20 See Tilley, Studies in the French Renaissance, pp. 233-237. 348</page><page sequence="11">THE ECLECTICISM OF RABELAIS 1540 and was made up of Briand Valle, du Ferron, R. Breton, and Buchanan.21 Though Rabelais was only slightly influenced by the Paduan doctrines, it seems evident that from these con- tacts, especially with Dolet in Lyons, his beliefs, then in flux, ultimately turned from Christianity in the direction of eclecti- cism tinctured with scepticism. In his third period his views reached their maturity. The fundamental scepticism of his nature, which underlies, permeates, and conditions all his work, attained its full development, his opinions apparently crystal- lized, and we can in a measure ascertain his attitude with respect to most of the transcendental questions discussed in those times.22 Turning now to Rabelais' writings, we find an almost total absence of philosophical preoccupations in his first, or Christian, period. In the first two Books he still accepts the theological view of the world. In Pantagruel he is still a Catholic though with liberal tendencies; his convictions sit lightly on him. He will turn his back upon them as soon as an alternative creed presents itself, which shall be less superstitious, less corrupt, and shall promise more liberty to the individual. In this Book he censures chiefly the institution of monasticism, possibly on account of his recent unfortunate experiences with his brother monks; he aims satirical shafts at the Sorbonne; he hazards a few irreverent remarks concerning the Scriptures and Jesus Christ, which will be expunged in the 1542 edition. However, in these remarks, we may see a reflection of the freedom of the times in sacred matters equally with the expression of a critical, sceptical temper. Gargantua marks a step in the evolution of the author's beliefs. He clearly shows Reformist leanings, chapter 54 being the high-water mark of his interest in the new religious move- ment. What was previously, at most, a dislike of the Sorbonne, becomes a hatred, this guardian of orthodoxy having incurred 21 See Busson, pp. 65, 72, 92, 119-120, and Part I, chaps. 2, 3, on the influence of Pomponazzi, the leader of the Paduan School. 22 It must not be thought that Rabelais was as much of an enigma to his contemporaries as he is to us. Many passages which today remain obscure seem to have been perfectly well understood at the time he wrote them. In this connection the reader is referred to Lefranc's article in theRevuedeFrance, May, 1922. 349</page><page sequence="12">N. H. CLEMENT his animosity by its condemnation and proscription of Panta- gruel; his sceptical tendencies have become more pronounced, probably as a result of his contact with the Paduans of Lyons; his dislike of monasticism has become intensified. The result is an obvious leaning towards the Reformation, but nothing more than a leaning. He does not go so far as to take sides with it. This is apparent from the fact that while Gargantua is made the mouthpiece of his sympathies for the Reform, Grand- gousier remains fixed in his loyalty to the Catholic Church, and that the religious background of the book is Catholic.23 Rabelais' third period, the period of the last three Books, may be called his eclectic period. In Books III and V especially we find his definitive opinions on the religious and philosophical questions that agitated his time.24 He has turned his back upon 3 This is strikingly the case in chapters 7, in which Gargantua "feut .... baptis6, comme est la coustume des bons christiens"; 17, the episode of the bells of Notre Dame; 21, Gargantua attends mass every morning; 27, the abbey of Seuille is brought to the forefront; 40, Grandgousier invokes the protection of the saints for the pilgrims; finally, the idea of community life in Theleme is Catholic and non-Protestant. Tilley, FranQois Rabelais, p. 337, ascribes to patriotic reasons Rabelais' failure to declare himself outspokenly in favor of the Reformation. He says that Rabelais was primarily a humanist to whom the unity of the nation seemed of greater importance than any particular form of creed or ritual, and in conse- quence he chose, like the majority of his fellow-humanists, to adhere to the church of his fathers. Louis Batiffol, Le Siecle de la Renaissance, 2d. ed., 1911, p. 163, seems to impute the same motives to Francis I. The writer's view, however, is that Rabelais' interest in the Reformation was not based on any deep convictions. It was chiefly a protest against the abuses of the Church in so far as he had personally suffered from them. Already in Pantagruel Rabelais had begun to manifest a reaction against Catholicism. This reaction was eventually to carry him all the way to pantheism. In his groping after a new belief he underwent for a while a Protestant phase, but while he was under- going that phase already ideas were clearly developing in him which were soon to carry him beyond the religious position he assumed in Gargantua. 24 Rabelais shows two moments of weakness, hesitation, and retrogression, the first being the 1542 edition of Gargantua and Pantagruel, the second being Book IV. As he humorously remarks several times, he is willing to maintain his views "jusques au feu exclusivement". Having made his peace with the Church, he was very careful to expunge from the 1542 edition all the slurring allusions to the Sorbonne found in the preceding editions (Ant. 1535, 1535, 1537) of Gargantua; in this edition he interpolated in the Prologue of Pantagruel the word predestinateurs in the passage: " .... et ceulx qui voudroient main- tenir que si, reputez-les abuseurs, predestinateurs, empoisonneurs et seducteurs". 350</page><page sequence="13">THE ECLECTICISM OF RABELAIS both the Church and the Reformation, and even Christianity in these Books appears highly attenuated. The groundwork of his belief seems to be a pantheism based very largely on Stoicism but admitting strains of Neoplatonism and Averroism. In Book III he adopts the Stoic view of the world and identifies Nature and God; in Book V his Stoical bias is more pronounced, he seems to have revised his earlier views on immortality, the traditional conception of God is entirely obliterated and his role effaced. The Fifth is the most daring of his Books, and the one from which, in spite of its many obscurities, the clearest idea of his ultimate beliefs may be gathered.5 The interpolation seems to be a derisive allusion to the views of Calvin on predestination. There is no doubt that Rabelais was disappointed in the Reformation. He saw one despotism trying to destroy and supplant another, and we may conclude that the violence and intolerance of Calvin cooled any interest he might have felt in the Protestant cause and made him willing to compromise with his old enemies in the Sorbonne. In the prologues of Book IV Rabelais defends himself against the charge of heresy levelled at him on account of the substitution three times of the word asne for ame in 111,22, 23. In his efforts to disculpate himself from the dangerous accusation he makes a formal declaration of faith. In the Prologue de l'autheur, he says: "Tel est le vouloir du tresbon, tresgrand Dieu, on quel je acquiesce, auquel je obtempere, duquel je revere la sacrosaincte parole de bonnes nouvelles, c'est l'Evangile .... " He is so careful not to give offence and to place himself above suspicion that in Book IV we can discern no signs of progress in his thought; on the contrary, he professes beliefs which he did not really entertain, as Book V clearly shows. 25 Rabelais calls his philosophy Pantagruelisme. He gives four differing definitions of Pantagruelisme, which roughly mark the different stages in the evolution of his beliefs. His definitions, which are grotesque at the outset, attain dignity in his later Books. In Pantagruel 34 his definition is: "vivre en paix, joye, sante, faisans toujours grand chere." In the Pantagrueline Pro- nostication, (1532) chap. 6, the English, the Scotch, and the Easterlings are called "assez mauvais pantagruelistes" because they drink beer instead of wine. In Gargantua 1 it is: "beuvans a gr6 et lisans les gestes horrificques de Panta- gruel." These definitions are conceived obviously in the spirit of Epicureanism. The years between Gargantua and the Tiers livre have brought disillusionment and tribulations to him, as we may gather from the Prologue of Book III: "Prins ce choys et election, ay pens6 ne faire exercice inutile et importun si je remuois mon tonneau diogenic, qui seul m'est rest6 du naufrage faict par le passe on Far de Mal'encontre." The melancholy of these words becomes trans- lated in a more serious attitude henceforth towards life, and this attitude is that of Stoicism. In the same prologue he gives a new definition of Panta- gruelisme; it is: "une propriete individuelle .... moyennant laquelle jamais 351</page><page sequence="14">N. H. CLEMENT 4. RABELAIS' SCEPTICISM The most obvious trait in Rabelais' intellectual temper is his scepticism. However, he did not travel in this path all the way to atheism on the one hand, nor to Pyrrhonism on the other; his scepticism is of the kind that prompts men to test everything in the light of reason and experience and entirely to reject authority and faith. In a word, it is a form of rationalism, and it may be asserted confidently that Rabelais stands with the very first rationalists of modern times. Rabelais' genius is positive, scientific, and realistic. He has a predilection for facts, which he classifies and marshals in array when he wishes to emphasize a point.26 He has the system- atic type of mind.27 He is inquiring28 and he likes to test and compare. These intellectual qualities, when exercised in the domain of religion, or science, or ethics, could not fail to pierce through the maze of superstition and unfounded tradition that fettered the hearts and minds of men from antiquity until about the middle of the seventeenth century. Knowledge begins with doubt, Descartes was to say a century later, and to this might be added that the more one knows the less one believes. Before Descartes, Rabelais had proceeded in that sense; he tells us in en maulvaise partie ne prendront choses quelconques." In III, 37, Rabelais links with this definition the Stoic idea of the Wise Man. He has triumphed over the passions that bring suffering to humanity, and he has learnt the lesson of wisdom. It is: "se oublier soy mesme, issir hors de soy mesme, vuider ses sens de toute terrienne affection, purger son esprit de toute humaine sollicitude, et mettre tout en non chaloir." The Pantagruel of this new philosophy, he tells us in III, 51, "a este l'id6e et exemplaire de toute joyeuse perfection." And, finally, he essays in the Prologue de l'autheur of Book IV a last definition: "Pantagruelisme, vous entendez, que c'est une certaine gayete d'esprit conficte en mespris des choses fortuites". Here we have what Faguet calls "la fine fleur de Pantagruelisme" (La Fontaine, 1913, p. 308). 26 Examples may be found in I, 3, where he cites eleven authorities in support of his statement of the eleven months' period of gestation of Gargantua; in I, 7, where he mentions seven cases of extraordinary births analogous with Gargantua's. 27 This is seen in the long lists of the forms of divination, of games, foods, etc. found in I, 22; III, 25, 26, 28, 38; IV, 17, 22, 30-32, 37, 40, 59, 60, 64; V, 33; in the long parades of recondite learning to be found on almost every page of his romance. 28 See his letter from Italy to Geoffroy d'Estissac (Moland, p. 616) and the seeds he sends the bishop. 352</page><page sequence="15">THE ECLECTICISM OF RABELAIS effect that everything must be subjected to rational and em- pirical tests; and in his work we see doubt applied on the most extensive scale to the current traditional beliefs. Rabelais' scepticism envelops everything established by authority, imposed by faith, and given currency by tradition. He assumed an attitude of mental detachment in all matters and thus was enabled to survey them with a critical eye. The tests he applies are reason and experience, which he substitutes for credulity in all religious, scientific, social, and political questions. When this test has not been applied, either through lack of opportunity, or because the material lies beyond the reach of reason or personal experience and observation, his attitude remains one of suspended judgment.29 In illustration, to those who would anthropomorphize God he administers this rebuke: "Et de qui estez vous apprins ainsi discourir et parler de la puissance et predestination de Dieu, paouvres gens? Paix.... humiliez vous devant sa sacree face, et recoignoissez vos imperfections."30 It is especially in empirical questions that Rabelais' scepticism is most patent. He refuses to accept the extraordinary on any authority.31 For instance, he relegates to the Country of Satin- a non-existent land-all exotic animals still unknown in France in his day, where he places them side by side with imaginary animals believed in at that time. Next to the Country of Satin he situates Lantern-land, which apparently symbolizes the choice spirits, past and present, of the human race.32 The writer sees in this juxtaposition a concealed meaning: Rabelais' ad- herence to the doctrine of probability of the Sceptics. In effect he says that in our inability to find sure criteria we must accept as probable the judgments of the choice spirits of mankind, 29 See the articles of Lazare Sainean on natural history in Rabelais in the RSS, and the writer's The Influence, etc. chap. 6, for his sceptical attitude in matters of science; on his scepticism in political matters see Tilley, Francois Rabelais, 1907, p. 325, where his views on the state and kingship are discussed. 30 Prologue de l'autheur, Book IV. For a similar thought see Pascal, Penske 242, Brunschwicg edition. 31 For typical cases see III, 27, where he asks that "true and natural" things be believed; the Country of Satin, V, 30-31; Epistemon's descent to Hell, II, 30, where he imitates one of the most telling shafts of irony of Lucian. 32 But see Abel Lefranc's discussion in Bull.

CLEMENT testing them, however, as far as possible, by our own reason and experience; this is the meaning of the Trinc! of the Holy Bottle (V, 45), to whose oracle the questers are conducted by the "lantern" of his old friend of monastic days, Pierre Lamy, his first initiator in the humanities, at that time already dead. This aspect of Rabelais' genius can best be brought out by a comparison between him and the professional scientists of his age, the most illustrious of whom even in the second half of the sixteenth century were still under the spell of Antiquity. In common with all their less learned contemporaries, the men who were opening up new vistas of knowledge implicitly believed the scientific legends and the marvelous stories handed down by tradition, from which natural science was to liberate itself only in the following century. In contrast with them the human- ist Rabelais is almost the first among the moderns to adopt a sceptical attitude with regard to this pseudo-science. In this respect he stands virtually alone among the philosophers, theologians, statesmen, artists, and humanists of the sixteenth century, who suffered extraordinary lapses into credulity.33 Considerations of space limit us to a single illustration. Ambroise Pare, the great physician of his time, offers a striking example of this credulity. Rabelais about the year 1550 placed the unicorn and the remora among the imaginary animals in his Country of Satin. In 1582 Pare wrote his Discours de la licorne,3 in which he affirms his belief in this legendary animal on the authority of the Bible! If he wrote this Discours it was not to deny the existence of the fabulous animal, but to combat the deep-rooted belief in the efficacy of its horn as an antidote for poisons. Further, in the Appendice au livre des monstres, vol. III, Pare accepts without question, as did Montaigne, stories about the supernatural powers of the remora, a little fish credited with the ability to stop a ship in its course. It is 33 Emile Gebhart, Rabelais, la renaissance et la reforme, 1895, p. 103, observes that Machiavelli and Cellini firmly believed in the influence of the stars on human destiny, while Rabelais satirizes this superstition. In Essay II, 12, Apologie de Raymond de Sebonde, which marks the culmination of Montaigne's Pyrrhonism, he shows himself devoid of all critical sense, and pretends to accept the most puerile stories on the authority of the ancients. 34 Ambroise Par6, (Euvres completes, ed. Malgaigne, 1840, 3 vols., I, cclxxxix, and III, chap. 14. 354</page><page sequence="17">THE ECLECTICISM OF RABELAIS to be noted that virtually all the "monsters" enumerated by Par6 are the "monsters" of ancient tradition. He has nothing extraordinary to relate regarding the animals of the new world (though they are inaccurately described in his works) because supersitition has not yet had a chance to attribute fabulous qualities to them.35 The reader is now in a better position to judge of the contrast presented by the scientists of the sixteenth century and Rabe- lais, the sceptic. If Rabelais does recount marvelous stories about animals and plants it is because his book is a romance and because magic and the marvelous are an essential part of the romance. However, he clearly enough indicates his own attitude towards the marvels he relates by situating them in non-existent countries; in addition, he gives us specific warnings. Many of his marvelous animals and plants are drawn from Pliny and Elianus; he tells us of the former "je ne suis poinct menteur tant asseure comme il a este" (I, 6), and the latter he calls a "tiercelet de menterie" (V, 30). He frequently expresses his scepticism in specific connections: "J'y [in the Country of Satin] vis un cameleon tel que le descrit Aristoteles . . . . et ne vivait que d'air non plus que l'aultre" (V, 30), and concerning the aphrodisiac qualities of the herb called Targon: "Ne 5 For a most instructive contrast the reader is referred to the Cosmographie of Jean-Alfonse de Saintonge, Rabelais' contemporary, the most widely travelled sailor of his day, if we are to believe him. The Cosmographie, which was pub- lished in 1559 under the name of Voyages aventureux du capitaine Jean-Alfonse Sainctongeois, is the strangest medley of fable and fact. It was republished in 1904 with annotations by Georges Musset. Lazare Sain6an, RER, X, 1-67, shows that Jean-Alfonse's book is largely plagiarized from the Suma de geografia of Fernandez de Enciso, which had been published in 1519, 1530, and 1546. Speaking of the times of transition in which Jean-Alfonse wrote his book, Pierre Margry, in Les Navigationsfranpaises et la revolution maritime du XIVe au XVIc siecle, 1867, says, p. 231: "Les hommes de cette 6poque, par une consequence de leur position sur la frontiere qui separe les deux &amp;ges, etaient condamn6s a subir en eux-memes une lutte d'influences diverses d'oi la verite ne pouvait se degager qu'en partie.

H. CLEMENT m'alleguez point l'Indian tant celebre par Theophraste, Pline et Atheneus, lequel avec l'aide de certaine herbe le faisait en un jour soixante et dix fois et plus. Je n'en crois rien" (III, 27). When men like Ambroise Pare uncritically accepted the pseudo- science of the past and without discrimination placed it on the same plane with what the science of their time had unequivo- cally established, they showed themselves to be the children of their age. When Rabelais scoffingly refused to accept this pseudo-science as genuine he exhibited a temper closely akin to the true scientific attitude and thereby showed himself a contemporary of the men of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and of our own age. 5. RABELAIS' RATIONALISM It has already been said that the term of Rabelais' scepticism on its religious side was not atheism, nor Pyrrhonism on its philosophic side. It was said that his scepticism was relative, that is, it prompted him to shake off the fetters of tradition and authority and to insist on examining questions on their merit by the sole use of the reason, and that it ended in rationalism. Since Rabelais' rationalism constitutes the positive side of his sceptical temper, we should expect to find rationalistic ten- dencies in him from the very outset. Here we encounter a difficulty: how are to be interpreted the obnoxious passages in his early books subversive of faith? In Pantagruel 1, "De l'origine et anticquite du grand Pantagruel," we find a satire on Biblical genealogies; in chapter 2 he ridicules holy water and gives an ironical example of the efficacy of prayer; in chapters 14 and 15 he parodies the litanies of the Church; in chapter 17 he burlesques one of its services, and he has in the same chapter a gross reference-suppressed in the 1542 edition -to the passion of Christ: "Jesus-Christ ne fut-il pas pendu en l'air?"; in chapter 30 he ridicules the current conception of Hell. In Gargantua 5, "Les propos des bienyvres," we find an allusion to the agonizing word of Christ on the cross: "J'ay la parole de Dieu en bouche: Sitio"; in chapter 6, "Comment Gargantua naquist en fagon bien estrange," the birth of Gargantua from his mother's left ear is a parody on the Annunciation;36 in " The 1542 edition suppressed the most daring part of this parody: "Pour- quoi ne le croiriez-vous? Pour ce, dictes vous, qu'il n'y a nulle apparance. 356</page><page sequence="19">THE ECLECTICISM OF RABELAIS chapter 23 Anagnostes explains the Scriptures to Gargantua,- in the latrines! in chapter 37 he ridicules the efficacy of holy relics, in this case the shroud of Christ; in chapter 38 he mocks Biblical predictions; in chapter 41 he speaks of the soporific virtue of prayer, and Gargantua and Frere Jean recite psalms to put themselves to sleep. In passages like these are we to see in Rabelais merely lingering examples of the satirical and irreverent, but yet orthodox37 spirit of the Middle Ages? or are we to see the expression of a conscious rationalism? Some scholars, among them Villey, look upon such passages as mani- festations of the esprit gaulois, as the humorous sallies of a cleric who is taking advantage of the traditional freedom in sacred matters; others, among them Lefranc,38 see in them clear manifestations of an anti-religious spirit. The truth probably lies midway between these two views. Probably even before the composition of Pantagruel Rabelais' beliefs had begun to change under the influence of his humanistic studies in the direction of the rationalistic pantheism which they were eventually to assume in Books III, IV, V. But by 1532 they had not yet sufficiently changed openly to turn him away from his old faith. We can see nevertheless that he has begun to question and under the stress of doubt to use his favorite weapon: ridicule. In the two years immediately pre- ceding Gargantua, his emancipation so far progressed that he has in spirit definitely left the Church and yet from the lack Je vous dis pour ceste seule cause vous le devriez croire en foy parfaicte, car les sorbonistes disent que foy est argument des choses de nulle apparance." 37 The reader scarcely needs be reminded that in the Middle Ages gross irreverence and a genuinely religious and orthodox spirit could easily, and usually did, go hand in hand. The decorations of medieval cathedrals, and the lay ceremonies performed in the churches with the participation of the clergy prove this clearly enough. It is only when the Reformation put the Church on the defensive and rendered necessary a more respectful attitude towards sacred things that these abuses were corrected. See Charles Lenient, La Satire en France au moyen age, 4th ed., 1893; Champfleury, Histoire de la caricature au moyen dge et sous la Renaissance, 1867-1871; Thomas Wright, A History of Caricature and the Grotesque in Literature and Art, 1875. 38 Revue de France, May 1922, p. 342. For Lefranc, Rabelais' aim was to bring discredit upon Christianity, to rally together all the different elements throughout the world who were hoping for a total emancipation from all forms of religious beliefs. 357</page><page sequence="20">N. H. CLEMENT of an intense conviction is holding aloof from the Reformation, although its apparent liberalism has attractions for him. With the Tiers livre in 1545 his emancipation from all formal creeds is complete, he is an esprit fort,9 and there remains but one more step for him to take and still stop short of atheism. This step he will take in the last Book. In brief, Rabelais' final attitude is the culmination of a long and slow process of evolu- tion which began before his literary career was initiated and of whose beginnings we have no written record. The limits of this process were orthodox Catholicism, which placed no emphasis on nature and reason, and Stoical pantheism, which is at the same time eminently naturalistic and rationalistic. The rationalism of Rabelais consists, in its scientific aspect, in the substitution of empiricism for tradition; in its religious aspect, in equating God, Reason, and Nature; in its philosophi- cal aspect, in a breaking away from all the formulas of the Middle Ages and in an effort to return to the philosophy of the ancients in so far as this was possible under the modern con- ditions of life. Philosophy in ancient times was determined largely by social, economic, and above all by political conditions. In the Renaissance the resurrected philosophy of Greece and Rome was determined above all by religious conditions. The school which most readily adapted itself to these new con- ditions was that of the Stoa. Hence we find Stoicism the pre- dominant philosophy of the second half of the sixteenth and the first half of the seventeenth century. It will appear in the second part of this study that just as Rabelais was in the fore- front among the rationalists of his century, likewise he was one of its first Stoics. At the risk of some dislocation the writer has reserved until after the remarks on Rabelais' naturism, scepticism, and 39 Villey, p. 277: "Certes nous ne trouvons dans son oeuvre aucune raison de penser, avec ses detracteurs fanatiques [Calvin, Puy d'Herbault] qu'il avait repudie la croyance en Dieu et en l'immortalit6 de l'ame; mais outre que je ne jurerais point qu'elle fut tres ferme en lui, tout porte a croire qu'il etait degage de toute religion positive, et j'estime avec Calvin qu'a cette date [1546] il s'6tait detourn6 de l'Evangile. Entre les abus de Rome, qu'il avait vus de pres, et l'intolerance de Geneve, qui s'organisait, il n'y avait plus de place pour la conception fabricienne de la Reforme. Desabus6, l'6vangeliste du Gargantua s'etait sans doute refugie dans une indifference dont l'ironie etait contenue par la prudence." 358</page><page sequence="21">THE ECLECTICISM OF RABELAIS rationalism, a few words supplementing what was said above (see p. 341) as to the difficulty in distinguishing what is decora- tion or pure fun in Rabelais' work from what is advanced seriously as his opinions or in support of them. Rabelais was not a philosopher by profession. Montaigne was much nearer being one, and it is relatively easy to extract from the Essays a sys- tematic body of thought. Montaigne discusses his sources and comments on them; we know when they correspond or disagree with his own ideas, or when they awaken his scepticism. Such a critical attitude is foreign to Rabelais. But this lack in him must be envisaged in the light of his times and in the nature of his ideas. We must bear in mind that his work yields not only a body of doctrines which are to be referred to that branch of philosophy known as Ethics, but he goes beyond Montaigne in attacking Christian dogmas and in giving us a fairly adequate idea of his conception of the physical universe. Now, in the domain of moral philosophy, Rabelais could, quite as well as Montaigne, set forth without ambiguity and with relative safety his true views, but far different was the case with regard to his natural philosophy. His views in this particular were heretical, and as late as 1600 Giordano Bruno was burnt at the stake for similar beliefs. In this connection we must not forget Rabelais' contentions with the Sorbonne and the Parlement of Paris. We know that "chasse de France par le malheur des temps," he was compelled, at least twice, to seek safety in flight; we know that for many years his correspondence was watched; that there is evidence that he was imprisoned for a time in 1552.40 The question forcibly suggests itself: Would a man like Rabelais, who by his own confession certainly was not made of martyr's stuff, have so often incurred the danger of perishing at the stake merely in order to indulge his bent for fun or to make a display of his erudition? We may be permitted to doubt this. After crediting his esprit gaulois and his human- ist's vanity with their fair share of erudite quotations and citations there still remains unaccounted for a sufficient mass of them to allow us to obtain a fair idea of his true beliefs. We may be allowed to think that Rabelais quite consciously used his "eclat de rire enorme" in order to escape being burnt at the stake for heresy, and Lefranc's words may safely be credited 40 See the Chronology in Vol. I of Lefranc's edition, and the citations. 359</page><page sequence="22">N. H. CLEMENT with more than a modicum of truth: "Nul satirique," he says,41 "pas meme Voltaire n'a atteint, semble-t-il, un pareil degre d'habilete et de calcul dans l'art de doser les negations les plus hardies." PART II. DISCUSSION 1. ECLECTICISM Eclecticism has a close affinity with rational scepticism. It is ultimately based on the idea that all philosophical systems are frequently both contradictory of one another and self- contradictory, and therefore that they eventually destroy one another or decay from within. To this is added a second con- sideration: as nature and man are composed of heterogeneous elements, truth likewise may be composed of elements derived from mutually contradictory systems, each of which has in itself some parcel of the truth to offer. In piecing out a new system from the fragments of the old systems, what shall be the guiding principle of the Eclectic? It shall be one of sus- pended judgment in all cases where the Reason remains un- convinced. The Reason should not feel impelled definitely to accept or reject doctrines in dispute when the arguments in support of either side appear equally cogent. This mental attitude is one of rational scepticism.42 The weakness of Eclecticism lies in its inability to formulate a precise, harmonious, and coherent theory of knowledge or of the universe. The Eclectic inevitably must fall into incon- sistencies. But this lapse does not disturb him, as usually his aim is only secondarily to secure pure knowledge; he is primarily interested in attaining dependable results for practical purposes. Accordingly, "the distinctive doctrines of each school drop into the background; and in the belief that infallibility resides solely in the mind itself, such portions are selected from each system as seem most in harmony with the selecting mind."43 41 Revue de France, May 1922. 42 In III, 36, Rabelais shows clearly enough that he is not a Pyrrhonist by making Gargantua leave in disgust after Trouillogan's exhibition of unadulter- ated Pyrrhonism. Gargantua is vexed with Trouillogan's performance because it appears to him to be not a use but an abuse of the reason, inasmuch as it enables one to escape all intellectual and moral responsibility. 43 Eduard Zeller, Stoics, Epicureans, and Sceptics, tr. by Reichel, new and revised ed. 1892, p. 29; see also Charles Benard, L'esthetique d'Aristote, 1887, pp. 256-257, 277 ff. 360</page><page sequence="23">THE ECLECTICISM OF RABELAIS The sixteenth century was a period when such a patchwork system of thought might easily recommend itself.44 The Reformation and the retrieval of the philosophy of the ancients threw the Renaissance into a condition of confusion and ferment against which even the best minds did not avail. Perhaps Erasmus possessed in the supremest degree the intellect and the tempera- ment to undertake the formulation of a new code of philosophic convictions for the times. If this greatest of the humanists had essayed the task it is quite likely that Rabelais, with his deep and enduring admiration for Erasmus, would have adopted this code ready-made, and that it would have become the bible of the humanists. But in the absence of such a code, Rabelais, like Montaigne a generation later, was driven to seek here and there, but above all in Nature herself, a creed to which he might anchor himself.45 In the remaining sections of this study we shall look into the views of Rabelais on the questions so earnestly debated in his time: the eternity of the world; Providence and teleology, free will and Destiny; miracles; the soul, intellect, vovs or mens; God, Nature, and natural law. We shall follow the evolution of his beliefs and shall see that in almost all instances they changed from time to time as a result of his sceptical and rationalistic tendencies, and that on the whole they found, as was the case with the Roman Eclectics, their ultimate conclusion in a theory of life and of the universe prevailingly Stoical. 2. THE ETERNITY OF THE WORLD In the sixteenth century three theories were current as to the origin and duration of the world: First, the theory of Aristotle that the world had always existed and would always exist, that it had no beginning and would have no end, that it was coeval with God. Second, the theory of cycles, which taught that there was a regular and rhythmic self-renovation of the universe. The Platonic cycle was deemed to extend over 15,000 and the Stoic cycle over 10,000 years. 44 Charbonnel, p. 712: "Le seizieme siecle est peut-etre un 'tournant decisif'; il est surtout un confluent ou se melent des doctrines tres diverses." 45 Rabelais and Montaigne present an interesting contrast. Both were at bottom sceptics, but whereas Rabelais passed through an Epicurean phase and ended with Stoicism, Montaigne on the other hand, after a period of Stoicism, ended with Epicureanism. 361</page><page sequence="24">N. H. CLEMENT Third, the theory of special creation ex nihilo. This is the Biblical account, which teaches that about 6,000 years ago God created the universe out of nothing and that some day He will destroy it and again reduce it to nothing. The theologians of the sixteenth century passed over in almost complete silence the theory of cycles but attacked the Aristotelian theory as being contrary to revelation, subversive of faith, and atheistic in tendency. They held that it minimized Providence and reduced to little or nothing the role of God in creation and in the government of the world.46 Rabelais has expressed himself on this question with sufficient frequency and clearness to leave no doubt as to his own position. His views were entirely orthodox; he subscribed to the tra- ditional doctrine that God had created the world out of nothing and could reduce it to nothing. He expressed this view with absolute clearness in the Pantagrueline Pronostication (1532) chapter 1: " .... Dieu, le createur, lequel par sa divine parolle tout regist et modere .... et sans la maintenance et gouverne- ment duquel toutes choses seraient en un moment reduictes a neant, comme de neant elles ont este par luy produictes en leur estre." He places the date of creation some 6,000 years ago.47 This view of special creation was expressed, it is true, at a time when he was still orthodox, but in almost every book of his romance he alludes to this doctrine.48 In V, 37, he identifies the idea of 46 See Busson, pp. 476, 214-220, for Vicomercato's views, which were those of the Peripatetic schools. 47 III, 18: "Mais, o vaines entreprinses des femmes! .... elles commen- cerent escorcher l'homme ... .par la partie qui plus leurs hayte, c'est le membre nerveulx, caverneulx, plus de six mille ans a ...." 48 II, 8: "Toutes choses seront reduictes a leur fin et periode"; 14: "de trente sept jubilez nous n'aurons le jugement final, et sera Cusanus trompe en ses conjectures," (Jean Plattard, RER, VIII, at p. 265: "II [Cusanus] avait fix6 la fin du monde actuel au 34e jubile apres J.-C., le jubile comprenant une periode de cinquante ans, comme chez les juifs.

May we infer from this that he subscribed to the Stoic doctrine of cycles? There is nowhere any indication of this.49 How then are we to reconcile the orthodoxy of this belief with his hetero- doxy on other points? By showing that the notion of the destruction of the world is not only Christian, but pantheistic as well, that it was generally entertained even by advanced thinkers like Jean Bodin who could not possibly be counted among the orthodox. Bodin twice discusses the question and gives as a reason for the destruction of the world a desire on the part of God to return to his original state of repose.50 In general, the systems of philosophy of the ancients-Aristotle's being the notable exception-were pantheistic, and chief among the pantheistic schools stood Stoicism and Neoplatonism. A funda- mental doctrine of the pantheism of these two schools was that of emanation and absorption, produced, in the case of Neo- platonism, through a number of theophanies. Neoplatonism, it is well known, influenced profoundly the early Church Fathers and through them John Scot Erigena, the ancestor of the pantheists of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance.5" There can be no doubt that Rabelais was acquainted with Erigena 49 Unless the passage in IV, 27, where he discusses the immortality of the soul be so construed: "Quant aux semidieux, panes, satyres, sylvains, folletz, aegipanes, nymphes, heroes et daemons, plusieurs ont par la somme totale resultante des ages divers supputez par Hesiode compte leurs vies estre de 9,720 ans. ...

In the second he says: "Si nous posons le cas que le monde ait est6 cr6e, il faudra qu'en tant et tant d'innumerables millions de siecles (exceptees six mille ann6es qui ne sont pas encore expirees) il y avait eu une merveilleuse obscurite au vuide incompre- hensible qui a precede le monde: et par ainsi il n'y aurait pas longtemps que Dieu, se reveillant comme d'un sommeil, se soit adonne a la creation du monde, auquel pourtant il deust bientost bailler la fin et ruyne pour retourner de son action motrice a son premier repos." Quoted from Busson, p. 545. On the Heptaplomeres, see Charbonnel, pp. 624-627. 61 See Saint-Rene Taillandier, Scot Erigene et la philosophie scolastique, 1843, and A. Jundt, Histoire du pantheisme populaire au moyen age et au seizieme siecle, 1875. Picavet upholds in his history of medieval philosophy the thesis that Neoplatonism was of paramount importance in fashioning the new Chris- tian theology. The affinity subsisting between the doctrines of the Platonists, new and old, and the Christian teachings has already been adverted to in this study. 363</page><page sequence="26">N. H. CLEMENT and his teachings. He alludes to the medieval philosopher at least four times in his romance,52 and in such terms as clearly indicate that he was acquainted with his philosophy at first hand. It is a fair inference, accordingly, that Rabelais, by following in the footsteps of the great medieval thinker, found it easy to reconcile what orthodox beliefs still lingered in him with a system of thought essentially pagan, it is true, but which nevertheless the Church Fathers had succeeded to their own satisfaction in reconciling with their creed. In conclusion, we might say that Rabelais' pantheism enabled him to avoid a difficulty that confronted Justus Lipsius and Guillaume Du Vair. It enabled him to escape from the dilemma presented by the Christian anthropomorphic God and the physics of the Stoa, which identified God and Nature. As a pantheist, Rabelais could easily accept the monism of the Stoics, whereas Lipsius and Du Vair as orthodox Christians found themselves confronted by an insoluble difficulty, which the former, at any rate, sought to evade by resolving the monism of the Stoic School into a dualism. Lipsius attempted by quota- tions from Seneca and Cicero to restrict the meaning of natura among the Stoics so as to signify nothing more than the Spirit and Reason of God.53 In this wise he sought to identify Nature and God by seeing in both "the eternal spirit of the world which creates and maintains life, that is to say, Providence." 3. PROVIDENCE, FREE WILL, DESTINY The two antagonistic explanations of the universe, the teleo- logical and the mechanistic, lay at the basis of the various solutions of the problem of Providence, Free Will, and Destiny, current in the sixteenth century. For the purpose of this dis- cussion these solutions may be reduced to four: First, what is apparently Aristotle's theory, that since God stands outside the world in solitary self-contemplation, and 62 I, 7: " .... docteurs scotistes .... et sentent de loin heresie"; 13: "et telle est l'opinion de maistre Jehan d'Escosse"; III, 17: "Heraclitus, grand scotiste et t6nebreux philosophe" (an equation, very likely, of the pantheism of the two, and the adjective "t6nebreux", an allusion which fits both Erigena's heterodox doctrines and the difficulty of grasping them); V, Prologue: " .... les sentences sent scotines et obscures. ... " 63 See especially Seneca, On Benefits, IV, 7, and Natural Questions, II, 45, and Zanta's comments, pp. 227-229. 364</page><page sequence="27">THE ECLECTICISM OF RABELAIS since the universe is governed by law, no room is left for Provi- dence or Free Will.54 Second, the Epicurean theory of a mechanistic universe, which excludes God and Providence. Everything, according to this theory, is due to chance or free will. Third, the Stoic theory that since God is diffused through the universe Providence by necessity exists; from this results the rejection of chance or free will. Fourth, the Christian theory, which seeks to harmonize the conceptions of Providence and human liberty.55 While Provi- dence, according to St. Thomas, acts in accordance with fixed laws in the sidereal system, there is no such uniformity in the case of terrestrial phenomena. These are consequently the result of chance in so far as secondary causes (i.e., natural law) are concerned though not so in their relation to Providence. Very frequently Rabelais introduces in his text the word Providence, or the idea, in a way to indicate that he certainly believed in it.56 However, this certainty is shaken by an 4 This is a fair statement of Aristotle's theory, which is somewhat obscure. Aristotle believes in a Providence in the sense that there is a purpose in the universe and there is some one served by that purpose which is brought to fruition entirely through the operation of natural laws, and not, as Plato and Socrates believed, and Christianity teaches, through the divine activity directly exercised in individual cases. 65 In this connection the question of Evil and Sin presents itself. Rabelais frequently toys with the idea but never says anything specific about it; I, 31; II, 8, 16, 20, 22, for example. Ferdinand Brunetiere, basing himself chiefly on Gargantua, has shown that Rabelais' philosophy is one of naturism ("La Philosophie de Moliere," in Etudes sur l'histoire de la litterature francaise, 4th series, 1912); but Arthur Tilley, ("Follow Nature," in Studies in the French Renaissance), upholds a different view. Such a philosophy tends, of course, to attenuate the notion of personal sin, and this is in line with Rabelais' subse- quent Stoicism. The Stoics had a deep feeling of the prevalence and intensity of moral evil. Here they found themselves in a dilemma, for by their theory they were of necessity prevented from shifting the responsibility for moral evil from the Deity to man, which is the Christian escape. In sum, they reserved their final word in the matter. 56 Examples: I, 27; II, 8, 11, 12, 14, 18, 22, 28, 29, 32; III, 9, 10, 13, 16; IV, 4, 19, 23, 25; V, 16, which may be quoted: "Apr6s que le bon Pantagruel eut fait les prieres et remercie le seigneur de l'avoir sauv6 de si grand dan- ger .... " The Bridoye episode, III, 39-43, may be regarded either as an indication of belief in Providence, or as a satire on the courts of law, or both at the same time. 365</page><page sequence="28">N. H. CLEMENT enigmatic passage in V, 9: "Comment nous descendismes en l'Isle des ferremens." In this island tools and weapons of all sorts grow on trees and fall into scabbards ready to receive them, whenever the tree is shaken. Under a different kind of tree grow weapons of another sort, which, on coming in contact with the trees, find points, blades, and handles, ready-made to fit them. In all this the writer sees the doctrine of teleology presented under symbolical form. Here is the passage which makes us pause: Vray est qu'en toutes choses (Dieu excepte) advient quelquefois erreur. Nature mesme n'en est exempte quand elle produit choses monstrueuses et animaux difformes. Pareillement en ces arbres je no- tay quelque faute: car une demie pique croissante haute en l'air sous ces arbres ferrementiportes, en touchant les rameaux, en lieu de fer rencontra un balay: bien, ce sera pour ramonner la cheminee. Une pertuisane rencontra des cizailles; tout est bon: ce sera pour oster les chenilles des jardins. Une hampe de hallebarde rencontra le fer d'une faux, et sembloit hermaphrodite: c'est tout un, ce sera pour quelque faucheur. C'est belle chose croire en Dieu! These three points need to be stressed: (a) the passage, taken literally, exhibits the Aristotelian view of God and Nature and is teleological; (b) the italicized words are, in the writer's opinion, ironical and seem to be aimed at this teleological view of nature; (c) if this conjecture is right, the chapter would seem to indicate an Epicurean, atheistic view of the world. In the language of mathematics, the passage constitutes a "singular point." What does it really mean? Any answer must be purely subjective. The writer acknowledges his inability to offer a solution. The best that can be done is to leave the reader to judge for himself. God and Nature, says Aristotle, do nothing without a purpose; the latter always strives, so far as conditions allow, to achieve perfection; nothing is superfluous or useless in her, or accidental in her creations. However, while striving toward definite ends she often fails, owing to the resistance of matter against form, in the full realization of her plans and produces many incomplete objects, which nevertheless she endeavors as far as possible to make use of for purposes of her own.57 67 Eduard Zeller, Aristotle and the Early Peripatetics, 2 vols., tr. by B. F. C. Costello and J. H. Muirhead, 1897, I, 466: "It is from this resistance offered 366</page><page sequence="29">THE ECLECTICISM OF RABELAIS The other ancient schools, except Epicureanism which differed in this respect from all of them, shared the teleological views of Aristotle. The great aim of Epicureanism was to offer a view of nature that would preclude all necessity for divine inter- vention, and to impute all phenomena to natural causes. To the Epicureans it was absurd to imagine that the arrangements of nature have for their object the well-being of mankind, or any object at all. They insisted that nothing should be explained as an intentional arrangement by the Deity, but that every- thing should be referred to mechanical causes. In fine, though there is considerable doubt, it appears that Rabelais accepted Providence. As to Free Will and Destiny, though in the motto of Theleme, FAIS CE QUE VOULDRAS58 he by matter to form that Aristotle derives all irregular natural phenomena (terata), such as abortions and the like. He regards them as the stoppage of nature in the midst of an unfulfilled design, as a mutilation and failure of the result which she originally intended." The later Stoics (Seneca) for this oppo- sition between matter and form substituted an opposition between matter and deity. Over against deity, which is the principle of good, they regarded matter as the ground of all evil. See W. Windelband, A History of Philosophy, tr. by Tufts, 1914, p. 230. Herein is the philosophical background of Rabelais' apologue of Physis ("c'est Nature") and Antiphysie ("la quelle est partie ad- verse de Nature"), IV, 32, in which his philosophy of naturism led him on to attack both Protestants and Catholics, "les demoniacles Calvins imposteurs de Geneve, les enraigez Putherbes .... monstres difformes et contrefaicts en depit de Nature." 68 The problem of the last three schools of philosophy among the Greeks, the Stoic, the Sceptic, and the Epicurean, was a problem of freedom. They all taught that the aim of man was happiness. The problem was, how to obtain this happiness? The Stoic solution, which was that of the Cynics also, was to consider man as the unit and to reduce his wants to nothing, thereby rendering him independent of everything, thus making him the master of all things (mathematically: = oo). The Sceptic solution was to obtain freedom, and therefore happiness, through universal ignorance, which would leave man absolutely untrammeled by knowledge or facts and raise him above all responsi- bility ( = oo). The Epicurean solution was to consider the world as one's oyster, to be superior to it and to use it as one saw fit without compulsion or hindrance of any kind (Pascal, Pensee 413, Brunschwicg edition, would have equated the Epicurean solution thus: ~=0). In his Abbaye de Th6leme Rabelais adopts the Epicurean solution. The enjoyment which Epicurus sought was the enjoyment of one's own cultivated personality, first of all, and wherever this standard prevails particular value is attached to the personal relations of society and to friendship. In the second place, since happiness is to be sought, not in subordination to a universal law, but in individual gratification or 367</page><page sequence="30">N. H. CLEMENT apparently accepted the freedom of the will, he remains silent in the last three Books on this question, except for the Stoic pleasure, it was an inevitable development of the system that to repose of mind and cheerfulness of disposition it should join the hedonistic doctrine of sensual gratification. It is this final aspect of Epicureanism that is found in the first two Books of Rabelais and apotheosized in Theleme. Now this form of Epicure- anism, paradoxical as it may seem, verges upon Stoicism, inasmuch as both are ultimately naturistic. Both could sincerely adopt the maxim of sequere naturam (cf. Montaigne III, 12), and this conformity with Nature is in the final analysis what Rabelais expected of the dwellers in Theleme. A second contact of Ra- belais with Stoicism in his Epicurean period is to be found in the Calvinistic doctrine of predestination, which is analogical with the Stoicfatum and to which he seems to have subscribed at the period of Gargantua (see the passages of I, 58, in editions Anterior 1535, 1535, 1537, which he omitted in the 1542 edition). The great difference between the two doctrines is that according to Calvinism man has a delectation for evil and therefore is damned unless saved by the special grace of God, which is granted only in extraordinary cases. Now, in any natural- istic system, man's delectation, to use theological language, must be for good, and this is precisely what Rabelais affirms in the celebrated passage in I, 57, imitated from Castiglione's II Cortegiano: " .... parce que gens liberes, bien nez, bien instruictz conversans en compagnies honnestes, ont par nature un instinct et aiguillon qui tousjours les poulse d faictz vertueux et retire de vice, lequel ilz nomment honneur." Thus at the very moment when Rabelais was most outspoken in his support of the views of Calvin (cf. I, 54), an invincible antagonism was already beginning to manifest itself between the two in their views on nature. Rabelais was attracted to the Reform by its rationalistic attitude in theological matters, but also quite as much by its negative side, the freedom from restraint it promised. However, when Calvin began to develop the reactionary positive side of his system Rabelais was disillusioned and repelled, and he turned away from the new creed. Feeling out of sympathy with both the Church and the Reformation he now began to formulate his own system, which is based on a pantheistic conception of God and Nature. In his third, or Stoical, period, (Books III, IV, V), Rabelais upholds the naturalistic view of life implied in the motto of Theleme, but jettisons the grosser hedonistic aspects of his first period. We see this in the reduced role of meat and wine in the last three Books, in Pantagruel's specific denunciation of the Gastrolators in IV, 60, and in the injunction of the "illustrissime lanterne," the soul of Pierre Lamy: "le vin vous est en mespris, et par vous conculque et subjugue" for all who "s'adonnent et dedient a contemplation des choses divines doivent en tranquillite leurs esprits maintenir, hors toute perturbation des sens, laquelle plus est manifest6e en yvrognerie qu'en autre passion quelle que soit" (V, 34). We can now see the background of the ultimate form Rabelais gave to his Pantagruelisme: une certaine gayete d'esprit conficte en mespris des choses for- tuites, with its admixture of Epicurean and Stoic elements. 368</page><page sequence="31">THE ECLECTICISM OF RABELAIS motto which he places at the entrance of the temple of the Holy Bottle (V, 37): DUCUNT VOLENTEM FATA, NOLENTEM TRAHUNT which, after all, is the expression of a conditioned and not a servile will.59 4. MIRACLES Both Antiquity and the Middle Ages had an unqualified belief in the supernatural, a belief which has lost credit with intelligent people only in recent times, and still persists among the ignorant. This belief has translated itself at various times into such forms as divination, magic and witchcraft, and miracles. The philological and historical investigations which the early Reformers were compelled to undertake in order to substantiate their assertion that the Church against which they were in revolt had corrupted the spirit and the practices of primitive Christianity helped bring about an attitude of rationalism which eventually undermined the belief in the supernatural. But in the days of Rabelais magic and divination flourished in the wake of the Neoplatonic revival, and miracles were generally credited; however, the belief in witchcraft, which had not been altogether unknown in Antiquity and the Middle Ages, was still in abeyance and was not to become a scandal and a peril until the end of the century. Rabelais' views on magic need not detain us here beyond saying that though he does not express an opinion about it, the purely literary purposes to which he puts the magical, that is, to supply the element of the marvelous, which is almost essential to the type of medieval romance he is parodying, and the burlesque of this marvelous, make it plain that he did not share the general belief in it. Accordingly, the only aspect of the supernatural of interest to us in this discussion is the belief in miracles. Respecting the dissipation of the belief in miracles that followed in the wake of the Reformation, a distinction must be made between the Gospel miracles, accepted by Protestants 69 For the Stoic doctrine of the conditioned will see Zeller, Stoics, etc., pp. 179-181, 216. See also the discussion in Boethius, De Consolatione philosophiae, V. 369</page><page sequence="32">N. H. CLEMENT and Catholics alike,60 and the ecclesiastical miracles accredited to itself by the Church. These were merely means of edification and impostures of the Church, according to the Protestant view, which thus ruled out all the miracles of the patrology and hagiography of the Middle Ages. The sixteenth century offered two explanations for miracles: (a) the believers saw in them the intervention in mundane affairs of saints and demons; (b) the philosophers believed that matter might be subservient to mind which, consequently, could pro- duce at will various natural phenomena.61 Rabelais' attitude, which apparently is a reflection partly of Cicero's and partly of the Epicurean doctrine, is in advance of his time. Some pretended miracles he openly derides, others he ascribes to regular and orderly processes of nature with which we are not familiar because of our ignorance and their rare occurrence. He stands almost alone in his time in his intuition of the universality and the regularity of the laws of nature, though he did not actually know them, and to preserve their integrity and efficacy he readily questions the genuineness of events called miraculous, even when they are related in the New Testament. He openly derides ecclesiastical miracles in his first two Books,62 but he does not offer against them the argument which he will use later. In the interlude between Gargantua (1534) and the Tiers livre (1545) he has accepted the idea of the 60 See Lecky, I, ch. 2, pp. 178-179, for a summing up of the arguments in favor of the authenticity of miracles. 61 See Busson, pp. 45-51, for Pomponazzi's views, which were based on Cicero's and represented those of the Paduan School. Pomponazzi did not believe in the supernatural, but he seems to have believed in the occult. 62 Examples: II, 2, rain obtained by prayer; 7, Saint Gertrude appearing to a nun in the pangs of childbirth; 14, the escape of Panurge from the Turks; 30, the burlesque resuscitation of Epistemon. In Gargantua his attack against the supernatural becomes broader. In chap. 27, referring to the escape of Picrochole's men from the pestilence he says: " .... qui est cas assez mer- veilleux, car les curez, vicares, prescheurs, medecins, chirurgiens et apothecaires qui allaient visiter, penser, guerir, prescher et admonester les malades, estoient tous mors de l'infection, et ces diables pilleurs et meurtriers oncques n'y prin- drent mal. Dont vient cela, Messieurs? Pensez, je vous prie"; in the same chapter he laughs at the powerlessness of Christ's shroud to save itself from burning; in chap. 45 he condemns the superstition that the saints can cause or cure disease. See RER, IV, 199 ff. 370</page><page sequence="33">THE ECLECTICISM OF RABELAIS universality of natural law, which the Stoics had elaborated from Aristotle, and which offers a deterministic explanation of all phenomena, ordinary or extraordinary.63 This is the obvious meaning of the Paradox of Lenders and Spenders (III, 2-4), which glorifies the conception of natural law, and is based on the Stoic notion of the intimate connection, or, as the Stoics called it, the "sympathy," subsisting throughout the universe and pervading all nature.64 Such a conception of the universe bars out the supernatural, and events so called by the ignorant the Stoics referred to natural laws, from which they were speculatively deduced. In this deduction the Stoics proved untrue to the fundamental notion underlying their theory of the universe, as it opened the way to their belief in and practice of divination, prophecy, and astrology. It is just here that Rabelais shows himself in advance of his time, of the Stoic philosophy, and of Cicero: in his sceptical as opposed to the apologetic attitude toward the supernatural. Cicero, whose De divinatione and De natura deorum Rabelais frequently cites, offers this rationalistic explanation of the supernatural (De div., II, 28): Whatever is born, of whatever kind it may be, must have some cause in nature, so that even though it may be contrary to custom, it cannot possibly be contrary to nature. Investigate, if you can, the natural cause of every novel and extraordinary circumstance:-even if you can- not discover the cause still you may feel sure that nothing can have taken place without a cause; and, by the principles of nature, drive away that terror which the novelty of the thing may have occasioned you. 6s While it is true that Pomponazzi's explanation of miracles implies the idea novel for the time of the reign of law in the universe (see Busson, pp. 44, 221- 225) nevertheless he does not develop completely his implication. For the Stoic idea of natural law, according to which nothing can happen without sufficient cause, or under the same circumstances differently from what has happened, see Zeller, Stoics, etc., pp. 173 ff. 64 A strain of Neoplatonism, which regards the world as a work of art, a divine poem, is found in the Paradox side by side with the Stoic physics. See Benard, p. 360, and Windelband, p. 367. At p. 335 Windelband discusses the Stoic and Neoplatonic doctrine of "sympathy." "Plotinus is also connected with the Stoics in his doctrine of the 'sympathy of all things.' But while they intended this to mean the mutual connection of cause and effect, Plotinus means by it an operation at a distance, which rests on the fact that, owing to the universal vitality and animation of the world, everything that affects a part of it is felt by the whole and consequently by all the other parts." 371</page><page sequence="34">N. H. CLEMENT These words are echoed by Rabelais in a discourse by the Queen of Quintessence, V, 22: Ce que fait les humains pensemens esgarer par les abismes d'admiration, n'est la souverainete des effects, lesquels apertement ils esprouvent naistre des causes naturelles, moyennant l'industrie des sages artisans; c'est la nouveaute de l'experience entrant en leur sens, non prevoyans la facilite de l'oeuvre, quand judgement serain associe estude diligent. Pour- tant soyez en cerveau et de toute frayeur vous despouillez si d' aucune estes saisis a la consideration de ce que voyez par mes officiers estre fait. Voyez, entendez, contemplez a vostre libre arbitre tout ce que ma maison contient, vous peu a peu emancipans du servage d'ignorance." However, Rabelais differs from Cicero in his disinclination to credit stories of the extraordinary (see Part I, ??4-5), which, as the quotation from him shows, Cicero readily admitted, but which he sought to account for rationally. This attitude Rabelais probably owed to the Epicurean philosophy which stressed the study of natural science almost exclusively because the knowledge of natural causes, it taught, is the only means of liberating the soul from the shackles of superstition. Busson is tempted to believe that in addition to attacking the ecclesiastical miracles65 Rabelais attacks also those of the Gospels, even those attributed to Christ himself. In the resurrection of Epistemon (II, 30) he is inclined, along with others, to see a satire of the miraculous cures operated by Christ in which he uses ointment (John IX, 1-11); he thinks that the words Panurge uses to reassure Pantagruel and Eusthenes are a burlesque adaptation of those of Christ when performing similar miracles66; in Gargantua's birth from his mother's ear, he sees a travesty on the Annunciation conceived in a spirit of sceptical mockery67; he thinks that the incurable cases 65 See pp. 18, 20-21, 187, 191. 66 Panurge says: II, 30: "Enfans, ne pleurez goutte, il est encore tout chault, je vous le gueriray aussi sain qu'il fut jamais"; Christ says, Mark, V, 39: "And when he was come in, he saith unto them, Why make ye thus ado and weep? the damsel is not dead, but sleepeth"; Luke VII, 13: "And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said unto her, Weep not"; Luke VIII, 52: "And all wept and bewailed her; but he said, Weep not; she is not dead, but sleepeth." 67 Busson remarks, p. 191: " .... la chose est d'autant plus vraisemblable que la phrase par laquelle Rabelais appuie la realit6 de l'invraisemblable nais- 372</page><page sequence="35">THE ECLECTICISM OF RABELAIS reserved for the Queen of Quintessence herself (V, 20) is an attack on the miracles of Christ in the New Testament as distinguished from those performed by the apostles. The writer is inclined to agree with Busson in spite of these somewhat far-fetched analogies. If the reader remembers the sections (??4, 5) of the first part dealing with Rabelais' scepti- cism and his rationalism, he will be prone to believe that Rabelais had a deep-rooted bias against all forms of the super- natural and extraordinary. Certainly what evidence there is would seem to demand the inclusion even of divine miracles within the range of his scepticism. 5. THE SOUL The question of the vovs, mens, intellect, or, as it is commonly called, the soul, originally mooted by the Averroists of the thirteenth century, was frequently discussed in the sixteenth, when almost all the doctrines of the various systems of philos- ophy of the ancients were revived. Antiquity and the Middle Ages bequeathed to the sixteenth century the following views of the soul: First, the view of the Epicureans that the soul is a material resembling fire and air. When the connection between the soul and the body is severed, the soul, deprived of its shelter, can no longer exist, and its atoms are dispersed. Second, the view of the Stoics, who identified God with the active reason, which interpenetrates and animates the entire universe as its body. This reason is creative, they taught, is a substance, a warm vital breath (pneuma), and in animate things its activity is connected with the blood and its circulation. The individual soul, in the system of the Stoics, bears the same relation to the World-Soul as a part to the whole. The Stoics differed in their views on immortality, some recognizing the survival of all souls till the end of the 10,000-year cycle, when they were to perish in the general conflagration, others reserving this qualified immortality only for the wise. sance de son heros est pr6cisement celle par laquelle l'ange annonce a Marie la conception et la naissance miraculeuse de son enfant et la grossesse inespere de sa cousine Elisabeth: C'est que rien n'est impossible a Dieu (Luc I, 37).

CLEMENT Third, the view of Aristotle, who made the soul consist of three parts, (1) the nutritive soul, which controls the lower vital and physiological functions in all animals, including man, and plants; (2) the sensitive soul, found only in animals and man, whereby they possess the faculties of perception, imagina- tion, memory, pleasure, pain, and spontaneous motion in space; (3) the intellective soul, found only in man. This third soul is identical with the Reason, which, potentially, is the faculty whereby one can conceive or think. In turn, Aristotle divided the Reason into: (a) the passive reason, which merely furnishes the data of Thought through the bodily existence, marks the the individual phase of life, and is conditioned by personal experience; (b) the active reason, which is creative, and works over and forms the merely potential concepts of the passive reason and renders them actual. The two reasons must co- operate in order to give rise to Thought.-The three souls are separable; they unite at the beginning of life and separate at its close. The first two souls are irrational, they are born with the body, and die with it; of the third soul, the passive reason, being connected with the body, is perishable, the active reason, however, existed before the nutritive and sensitive souls and the passive reason, is unconnected with the body, is immaterial and imperishable. It is a spark of the divine mind which comes to man from without. Hence for Aristotle, just as for Plato,68 personal immortality is impossible since the active reason, which alone is immortal, is not individual and personal.69 Fourth, the Christian view, which is at bottom the Aristo- telian view as adopted by St. Thomas Aquinas, who made ambiguous modifications in Aristotle's doctrine, apparently 68 For Plato's views, to which Aristotle's are to some extent similar, see Eduard Zeller, Plato and the Older Academy, tr. Alleyne and Goodwin, 1888. The Neoplatonists taught that the individual intelligences proceeded from the universal intelligence to which they returned at death, and in which they sunk their identity. The active intellect of the Neoplatonists, which they deemed common to all men, is not the universal World-Soul of the Stoics. See Renan, pp. 130-131, 151. 69 The doctrine of the Averroists is merely Aristotle's with the two folowing implications fully developed: a) the unity of the soul,-the soul is one, and is participated in by all individuals in common; b) it is identical with the last of the mundane intelligences. 374</page><page sequence="37">THE ECLECTICISM OF RABELAIS 375 extinguishing the distinction between the three souls and con- ceding immortality to all of them. After these preliminary remarks we are in a position to pass to Rabelais' views. On several occasions Rabelais alludes to the origin, nature, and seat of the soul. As to its origin, twice in III, 4, he seems to indicate that the soul arises from the blood through fire.70 This is in accord with the Stoic doctrine. As to its nature, in IV, 22, he expresses71 the view that it is fire in a passage left out, from motives of prudence, in the 1552 edition. He ascribes this doctrine to the Pythagoreans, but it is the Stoic doctrine as well. As to its seat he says in III, 4, that it is the blood: "sang est le siege de l'ame." As to the immortality of the soul Rabelais disguises his views so effectively that it is impossible to conclude from his expressions what he really thought. In III, 21, he refers to a future life and immortality, on the occasion of 70 "L'intention du fondateur de ce microcosme est y entretenir l'ame, laquelle il y a mise comme hoste, et la vie. La vie consiste en sang, sang est le siege de l'ame; pourtant, un seul labeur poine ce monde: c'est forger sang continuellement"; and speaking of the transmutation of food into blood he says: "Les roignons par les venes emulgentes en tirent l'aiguosite, que vous nommez urine, et par les ureteres la decoulent en bas. Au bas trouve receptacle propre, c'est la vessie, laquelle en temps opportun la vuide hors; la ratelle en tire la terrestre et la lie, que vous nommez melancholie; la bouteille du fiel en substraict la cholere superflue; puys est transporte en une autre officine pour mieulx estre affine: c'est le coeur, lequel, par ces mouvements diastolicques et systolicques, le subtilise et enflambe tellement que par le ventricule dextre le met A perfection, et par les venes l'envoye a tous les membres; chascun membre l'attire a soy, et s'en alimente a sa guise: pieds, mains, yeulx, tous; et lors sont faictz debteurs qui paravent estoient presteurs. Par la ventricule gausche il le fait tant subtil qu'on le dict spirituel, et l'envoye a tous les membres par ses arteres, pour l'autre sang des venes eschauffer et esventer; le poulmon ne cesse avecques ses lobes et souffletz le refraischir: en recongnoissance de ce bien, le coeur luy en depart le meilleur par la vene arteriale; en fin, tant est affine dedans le retz merveilleux que par apres en sont faictz les esprits animaulx, moyennans les quelz elle [the soul] imagine, discourt, juge, resoust, delibere, ratiocine et rememore." 71 With regard to Panurge's fear of death through drowning: "Car, comme est la sentence de Homere, chose griefve, abhorrente et denaturee est perir en mer. La raison est baill6e par les Pytagoriens, pour ce que I'ame est feu et de substance ignee. Mourant doncques l'homme en eau (element contraire) leur semble, toustesfois le contraire est verite, l'ame estre entierement esteinte."</page><page sequence="38">N. H. CLEMENT Raminagrobis' death.72 He seems to envisage this immortality in the light of Aristotle's tripartite division of the soul and bipartite division of the reason.73 However, the acceptance of the Aristotelian doctrine is not conclusive in this connection, for, as Aristotle thought that only the intellective soul (i.e., the active reason) was immortal, personal immortality does not necessarily follow as a consequence. The Averroists also in upholding the Aristotelian view that the intellect does not specifically belong to the individual but is common to all render impossible its survival after death as a separate entity. In IV, 26, the old Macrobe expresses the Stoic view of a qualified immortality. The perturbations of nature, to which Pantagruel alludes in this chapter as manifesting themselves on the occasion of the death of heroes,74 and which Epistemon recalls as having occurred at the death of Guillaume du Bellay, and the same perturbations that attended the death of Pan (IV, 28), are in accord with the Neoplatonic form of the Stoic idea of the "sympathy" of nature, and militate against the view of personal immortality. In III, 22, 23, he derisively writes asne for ame three times; in IV, 43, he uses the gross expression "ainsi leur sort l'ame par le cul" in speaking of the wind-eaters of the Island of Ruach. It is impossible to decide whether these are examples of the irreverent esprit gaulois or an indication of his views. Finally, there remains to consider the passage in V, 33, found in the MS (printed by Moland as chapter 33 bis) but left out in the 1564 edition, in which Rabelais seems to admit mortality, at any rate for some souls. In this chapter Panta- gruel and his companions arrive in Lantern-land. It is too obvious to require proof that the "lanterns" symbolize the intellects of the great men who have departed from this life. Among the lanterns he saw "une vieille lanterne edentee reves- tue de parchemin, lanterne corporalle d'aultres jeunes lanternes, 72 Other references to immortality are found in II, 8 and III, 21, but they throw no further light on the question. 73 IV, 27: "Je croy, dist Pantagruel, que toutes ames intellectives sont exemptes des cizeaulx d'Atropos. Toutes sont immortelles, anges, daemons et humaines." 74 Such perturbations are related also of some of the Roman emperors and of many heroes of medieval epics; see C. Nyrop, Storia dell'epopea francese, 1888, p. 123. 376</page><page sequence="39">THE ECLECTICISM OF RABELAIS laquelle criant aux semetieres lampades nostre extinguntur, feut tant ivre du breuvaige qu'elle sur l'heure perdit vye et lumiere; et fut dict a Pantagruel que souvent en Lanternoys ainsi peris- soient les lanternes lanternees, mesme au temps qu'elles tenoient chappitre." The passages in which Rabelais expresses or implies a belief in the mortality of the soul appear to be more numerous and in almost every case of more weight than those in which he indicates the contrary view. Indeed it is only in the passage in IV, 27, concerning the ames intellectives, that a belief in im- mortality is specifically set forth. On the whole, it appears that if Rabelais believed in immortality it was only in a qualified immortality: the immortality of the impersonal soul, the "ac- tive reason" of Aristotle.75 This conclusion receives some support from the fact that nowhere in his romance does Rabelais express definitely his views on the future life.76 6. GOD AND NATURE Two theories of God and Nature77 divided between them- selves the adherence of most believers and thinkers of the Renaissance: the Aristotelian and the Stoic. The first as revised in the thirteenth century by St. Thomas Aquinas, who made an amalgamation of Hellenistic science and Christian faith, was the orthodox religious doctrine; the second, after having, under the guise of Neoplatonism, which brought into the foreground the conception of nature and the universe of the Stoa, indirectly inspired all the pantheistic sects of the Middle Ages, was revived in its unalloyed form by the human- ists, and at the end of the sixteenth and in the seventeenth 75 Busson, pp. 266-272, discusses Rabelais' views and reaches a somewhat different conclusion. He says at p. 272: "Tout compte fait, il me semble qu'il y croyait et que le sage Pantagruel parle en son nom quand il affirme sa foi spiritualiste. Seulement il ne faut pas lui en demander plus. Sous quelle forme concevait-il cette vie future, personnelle comme 1'Eglise, impersonnelle comme Averroes et la plupart des humanistes d'alors?" 76 His only declaration in this regard is found in III, 21 where he speaks of the approaching death of Raminagrobis: " . . . . et ja touchant et goustant le bien et felicite que le bon Dieu a prepare a ses fideles et esleuz en l'aultre vie et estat de immortalite." 77 For the various views of nature with which the sixteenth century was acquainted, see Busson, pp. 254-257. 377</page><page sequence="40">N. H. CLEMENT century reached its most perfect form in the systems of Giordano Bruno and Spinoza. While Rabelais' views on God and Nature are contradictory- as in almost all of the questions discussed in this second part- to the writer it seems possible nevertheless to extract a doctrine from him. In spite of the necessity to which he was put, es- pecially after the burning of Dolet on a charge of heresy in 1546, of concealing his beliefs, the reader cannot fail to notice the difference in tone between the first part of Rabelais' romance (Books I, II) and the second part (more specifically Books III and V). In the first two Books it is clear that Rabelais' con- ception of God and Nature is orthodox. It is that of Aristotle as modified and christianized by St. Thomas in his Summa Theologia and vulgarized by Dante in the Divine Comedy. It recognizes a dualism in essence and function between the two, which are considered as two distinct powers, the second being subordinate to the first and regarded as its agent in impressing the divine will on the universe. This orthodox view is clearly expressed in I, 20: Les articles de Paris [the Sorbonne] chantent que Dieu seul peult faire chose infinies. Nature rien ne faict immortel, car elle mect fin et periode a toutes choses par elle produictes; car omnia orta cadunt, etc.78 In the last three Books the references to God and Nature are considerably multiplied. It seems fairly evident that in his last period Rabelais abandoned the Aristotelian and Christian dualism in favor of the monism of the Stoics, and its equation of God, Nature, and Reason.79 While in Gargantua and Pantagruel Nature as a creative force is given a secondary role and relegated to the background, just the contrary is true in the last Books, in which it is God who is lost sight of except in so far as He is identified with Nature, which is regarded as the original and independent creative agency. This primary role of Nature as the creator is strongly insisted upon for the first time in III, 8: "Voyez comment Nature, voulent les plantes,.... une fois 78 Other examples are found in II, 2, 21. 79 Cf. V, 4: "comme raison le veult, nature l'ordonne, et Dieu le commande." The rationalism of nature is stressed in Book IV, Prologue de l'autheur: "La verite, la fin, l'effet de deux contradictions ensemble feut declair6 impossible en nature." 378</page><page sequence="41">THE ECLECTICISM OF RABELAIS par elle creez, perpetuer et durer en toute succession de temps .... "; and "Ainsi ne pourveut Nature a la perpetuite de l'humain genre, ains crea l'homme nud. ... .80 More striking testimony in favor of the thesis the writer is now upholding is to be found in the following passages: III, 4: "Nature n'a cree l'homme que pour prester et emprunter .... L'intention du fondateur de ce microcosme est y entretenir l'ame laquelle il y a mise comme hoste et la vie." III, 32: "Quand je diz femme, je diz un sexe tant fragil, tant variable, tant muable, tant inconstant et imperfaict, que nature me semble, parlant en tout honneur et reverence, s'estre esgaree de ce bon sens par lequel elle avoit cree et forme toutes choses quand elle a basty la femme." l IV, 28: "Toutesfoys je le interpreteroys de celuy grand Servateur des fideles, qui feut en Judee ignominieusement occis par l'envie et ini- quite des pontifes, docteurs, presbtres et moines de la loi mosaicque.

When a theologian spoke Rabelais was careful to use appropriate language. Hippothade said in III, 30: " .... le Seigneur, createur, protecteur, servateur? N'est ce le recongnoistre unicque dateur de tout bien? N'est ce nous declairer tous dependre de sa be- nignite? Rien sans luy n'estre, rien ne valoir, rien ne pouvoir, si sa saincte grace n'est sus nous infuse ...." 379</page><page sequence="42">N. H. CLEMENT III, 13: a .... en contemplation de ceste infinie ct intellectuelle sphere, le centre de laquelle est en chascun lieu de l'univers, la cir- conference point, c'est Dieu, selon la doctrine de Hermes Trisme- gistus . . . ." V, 48: "Allez, amis, en protection de cette sphere intellectuelle de laquelle en tous lieux est le centre et n'a en lieu aucun circonference, que nous appelons Dieu." In III, 4, there can be no doubt that God and Nature are equated; in III, 32, this is likewise the plain inference from the words: parlant en tout honneur et reverence; in IV, 28, Christ is identified with Pan, who, at the time of the Roman empire, was made the personification of universal Nature, the creator and sustainer of all living beings, under which guise he came to be considered as the greatest of the gods; in V, 7, the apologue of the horse and the donkey, the two words Dieu and Nature are used indifferently; finally, in III, 3, and in V, 48, in the words Bacbuc uses to speed Pantagruel and his companions on their return journey, we find a clear-cut indication of the Stoic pantheistic doctrine of immanence.82 All these texts seem to the writer to establish beyond any doubt a monistic, and therefore Stoic, view of God and Nature as Rabelais' definitive belief. RETROSPECT We may now try to weave together as far as possible the scattered threads of this study. The most distinct impression that remains with us is one of confusion. Over and above the fact that the conditions of his times made it difficult and danger- ous for Rabelais to ventilate his views candidly we feel that there must be some additional reason for the chaos in his religious and philosophical ideas, which we have traversed in the course of the five Books. This reason is to be found in the bewilderment of the early humanists when brought face to face for the first time with the newly resurrected systems of philosophy of Antiquity. The revival of ancient thought in opposition to the inherited phil- 2 Pascal, Penste 72, Brunschwicg edition, uses the same idea, but he is careful to make it apply not to God but to the infinite space of the universe. For a contrary view to the writer's, see Tilley, Studies in the French Renaissance, pp.243-247. 380</page><page sequence="43">THE ECLECTICISM OF RABELAIS osophy of the Middle Ages brought about a violent conflict which ultimately resulted in a victory for the former, and whereas Theology had preached how God reveals himself in the Scriptures, Philosophy now undertook to teach how He reveals himself in Nature. Accordingly, modern natural science is pantheistic in its origins, and this new interest in Nature which had been totally lost sight of in the Middle Ages ushered in the age of Rationalism when men began to look to science to explain phenomena that long were deemed supernatural and to substitute the idea of universal law for that of capricious and isolated divine intervention. The first result, therefore, of the revival of ancient philosophy was a return to a dis- interested conception of Nature, and towards this end the whole thought of the Renaissance directed itself. Nature, the creative divine power, now came forward. The new interest in her manifested itself at first under the aegis of Neoplatonism, but the Neoplatonism of the Renaissance brought into the foreground with controlling force the Stoic conception of the divine unity of the living universe, to which Neoplatonism added the poetic notion of the admiration of the macrocosm as a work of beauty and of art. The whole tendency of Renaissance thought was then towards monism and pantheism, and to this conclusion led all the systems of Antiquity which were, with the sole exception of Aristotelianism, pantheistic in varying measures. It was deemed that everything must have its cause, and the final cause can be but one-God Himself. Hence the universe was considered as naught else than God revealing himself in all His creations. At this juncture it becomes necessary to set forth briefly and succinctly in their likenesses and their oppositions the three new schools of ancient thought that disputed in the sixteenth century the ground with the traditional Peripateticism. These schools fell into exaggerations, as was inevitable, and Peri- pateticism continued to maintain itself by their side as a counterpoise for their fantasies. The initial point of departure of Neoplatonism, which used Plato's system as the framework of a religious world-view utilizing whatever seemed valuable in the other systems, was a Being living beyond the world and unmixed with the process of life going on in it, from His height causing all things but 381</page><page sequence="44">N. H. CLEMENT Himself subject to no causality; the metaphysical basis of the system was an opposition of God and the world, of spirit and matter. Under the influence of oriental mysticism and Stoic pantheism, Neoplatonism bridged the abyss between God and the universe, and while it maintained the Deity as the unity exalted above all opposites who could not be apprehended through any finite attribute, at the same time it thought of Him as the inexhaustible and infinite world-force, as natura naturans, which eternally and purposefully unfolds itself in conformity with law into natura naturata. Epicureanism in its negation of creation, Providence, and immortality was diametrically opposed to medieval tendencies and had nothing in common with Neoplatonism. In one of its aspects, however, it was akin to Stoicism: both had the same aim, the desire to place man in a position of independence of the world in the consciousness of the complete freedom of thought. Epicurus aimed at conducting man to Happiness by controlling and regulating the passions and desires; he eschewed the passions which disturb peace of mind and repose of life. Hence Epicurus' Happiness rests much less on sensual gratifica- tion than upon repose of mind and cheerfulness of disposition. Stoicism on the other hand aimed at attaining freedom and Happiness through the extirpation of all the appetites of the senses. On this account it is held the highest moral system of Antiquity, and the one most closely akin with Christian aspira- tions. There is, however, a type of Stoicism closely related to Epicureanism: the one that celebrates the goodness of Nature, and in the sixteenth century it found expression in the motto sequere naturam, "vivre conformement a la nature." Only good can flow from Nature, and this good can be cultivated by knowledge, which teaches the difference between right and wrong. But it must be borne in mind that by Nature the Stoics meant something quite different from what is today meant, the excita- tions of feeling and will called forth by external stimuli through the senses. For them this was exactly the opposite of Nature. Nature was Reason for them, and the demands of Nature, identical with those of reason, were in opposition to those of the senses. For the Stoics knowledge of the highest good was 382</page><page sequence="45">THE ECLECTICISM OF RABELAIS the chief end of philosophy and the foundation of virtue. Knowledge should lead to right action (cf. Descartes); right action is rational action; rational action is action in harmony with Nature. In the ultimate analysis, virtue consisted for the Stoics in bringing one's actions into harmony with the laws of the universe and the order of the world. Rabelais, as we have seen, began with Epicureanism-in his first two Books. Like La Fontaine, his disciple in the next century, he was an Epicurean who believed in Providence. In Theleme he establishes as the aim of all discipline the free and unhampered expansion of the individuality, and this expansion is linked with freedom of will and of action, also an Epicurean trait. His Epicureanism, at first coarsened by a strong ad- mixture of hedonism, eventually purifies itself and ultimately blends with Stoicism in the final definition he gives of Pan- tagruelisme: c'est une certaine gayete d'esprit conficteen mespris des choses fortuites. With this chastened Epicureanism he alloys in the last three Books Neoplatonism and Stoicism. Neoplatonism is kept in the background, but in two connections it is stressed: the first is the Paradox of III, 3-4, where Plotinus' idea of the world as a work of art is brought to the fore; the second is in the mystic contemplation of the highest good alluded to in V, 34: " .... tous personnages qui s'adonnent et dedient a contempla- tion des choses divines doivent en tranquillite leurs esprits maintenir, hors toute perturbation des sens . . ." Stoicism runs through the last three Books chiefly in Rabelais' theory of the nature of the soul, his ideal of the Wise Man, his conception of God and Nature, and his quest of Knowledge and Truth, symbolized in the Holy Bottle, as the highest good.83 To the turmoil brought into man's mind by the discovery of the ancient systems of thought must be added that brought into his soul by the Reformation. Rabelais shows this second conflict also. It was brief, however, and it did not penetrate into the core of his being. We feel that the interest which he for a time showed in the Reformation was negative in tendency: it was prompted by the desire for emancipation from the out- worn forms of his creed, but he soon discovered that the way 83 See the writer's The Influence, etc., chap. 5, ?3. 383</page><page sequence="46">N. H. CLEMENT to freedom lay not through the Reformation but through Nature with the philosophy of the ancients for a guide. Accordingly, for the religious preoccupations of Books I and II he substitutes the philosophical preoccupations of Books III, IV, and V. In conclusion, in characterizing Rabelais' religious and philo- sophical thought the fact needs to be stressed that he largely stood aside from the philosophical current initiated in his own time by the School of Padua. To be sure, his revolt against medievalism in thought and belief, if it was not prompted by the Paduans, received a powerful impulse from them, but for the web and woof of his new beliefs he was indebted to the Greeks and the Romans. Rabelais was not a formal thinker, nor was he profound or original. He was distinguished above his contemporaries chiefly by his sceptical temper. His weapon is not logic, he never uses formal argumentation; rather, he employs laughter and ridicule. His work was destructive, not constructive, and he probably merits the distinction of being the foremost Lucianist of the modern world. N. H. CLEMENT 384</page></plain_text>
