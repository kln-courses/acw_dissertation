<plain_text><page sequence="1">JAEGWON KIM HEMPEL, EXPLANATION, METAPHYSICS' (Received in revised form 20 November 1998) Through his long and distinguished career, Carl Hempel contributed to a variety of philosophical areas. To mention some of the topics on which he made notable contributions, the following come quickly to mind: the coherence theory of truth, logical behaviorism, the veri- fiability criterion of meaning, philosophy of history, confirmation theory, concepts and concept formation in the sciences, the obser- vational content of theoretical terms, functional analysis in biology and the social sciences, the concept of rational action, and the struc- ture of scientific theories. But everyone will agree that it is his work on the nature of scientific explanation that was both the heart and pinnacle of his philosophical work. Clearly, it was, and still is, the best known and the most influential of his many contributions. With his "The Function of General Laws in History" published in 1942, Hempel arguably inaugurated the problem of scientific explanation as a central problem of philosophy of science. One could say that the basic idea of the deductive-nomological model, or the covering- law model, of explanation goes back to John Stuart Mill; one could also say that the idea was present in Karl Popper's Logic of Scientific Discovery and in the writings of Ernest Nagel around the same time, but it was Hempel's work, at once systematic, detailed, and compre- hensive, that elevated scientific explanation to the status of a central philosophical problematic in the philosophy of science during the second half of this century. As many of you will recall, Hempel's theory of explanation was the target of wave after wave of critical attention, from all quarters, some of it rather jejune and picayune but a substantial portion of it positive and constructive, leading to new insights and perspectives. In retrospect, it is amazing to see how well Hempel's basic insights have withstood all that onslaught and endured. Later in this talk, I LA Philosophical Studies 94: 1-20, 1999.

But first I would like to show how certain basic positivist philosophical commitments that Hempel had embraced early in his career shaped, in a profound way, the surface contours of his theory of explana- tion, and how a different perspective on philosophical methodology might have led to a more satisfactory, though not fundamentally different, account of scientific explanation. But before I go into these matters, I would like to take this occa- sion to pay my personal tribute to Hempel as my teacher. When in the spring of 1958 I was waiting to hear from the graduate philo- sophy programs to which I had applied, I received a personal letter from Hempel in which he very gently urged me to come and study at Princeton. That was the most exciting thing that had ever happened to me, and I read and reread the letter many times over. Hempel's carefully inscribed signature at the bottom of the page, in blue ink and with a hint of formal daintiness, was deeply burned into my visual memory, and I can still vividly see it in my mind. With that letter, Princeton shot to the top of my list. Actually at the time I was ill-prepared for graduate-level work in philosophy, but Hempel was always kind, gentle, understanding, and patient. Above all, he treated everyone, including the greenest novices and the most petu- lant critics, with friendliness, honesty, and respect. Of course, he was a vigorous and effective debater, especially against some of his obsessive critics on explanation, but he discussed the issues and never attacked the critics. His respect for both his opponents and the truth was always evident. He was indeed a model of what a philosopher, a lover of knowledge and truth, ought to be and can be. I When one looks at Hempel's work during his early period, roughly the 1930s through the '50s, one cannot fail to notice two very prom- inent themes that shaped his philosophical approach. The first is his view of philosophy as the study of the "logical syntax" of the</page><page sequence="3">HEMPEL, EXPLANATION, METAPHYSICS 3 language of the sciences and his commitment to "syntactic analysis of language" as the proper method of philosophy. The second is his commitment to objectivity in both science and philosophy and his rejection of anything that smacked of psychologism or involved an appeal to subjective feelings and judgments. Let us call these "syntacticalism" and "anti-psychologism" respectively. Here I will mainly focus on syntacticalism, and will not have the time to discuss Hempel's anti-psychologism. Hempel's conception of philosophy as syntactical analysis of course stems from Rudolf Carnap's early work, in particular his Logical Syntax of Language.2 In this and other works during the 1930s, Carnap promoted the idea that philosophy is the investiga- tion of the syntax of language, especially that of the language of science, and that this is the only proper and defensible concep- tion of philosophy. According to the orthodox positivist doctrine, science has a preemptive, monopolistic dominance over both empir- ical knowledge and a priori logical and mathematical knowledge, and this meant that the only sliver of the epistemic domain left over for philosophy is the metalinguistic/metalogical task of analyzing the language of science. For Carnap during this pre-Tarski period, syntax exhausted the logic of science ("The logic of science is syntax" is the title of one of the sections of the Logical Syntax3). Carnap's fear and loathing of semantics was not fully allayed until the ground-breaking work of Tarski on truth. The odd thing, from the present perspective, is that Carnap's Logical Syntax was rife with concepts that are now standardly regarded as semantic rather than syntactic - such as analyticity, implication, and equivalence - a fact Camap explicitly acknowledged in his later work, Introduction to Semantics.4 Even the slogan "The logic of science is syntax" was changed to "The task of philosophy is semiotic analysis", where "semiotic" is short of "syntactic and semantic". In this later work, the notion of designation (what we would now call reference) plays an essential role, Carnap taking both individual constants and predicates as designators for individuals and properties respec- tively. And Carnap defines truth for atomic sentences in the by-now familiar way: "Fa" is true iff the object designated by "a" has the property designated by "F'.</page><page sequence="4">4 JAEGWON KIM Hempel wrote several papers during his stay in Belgium in the 1930s, before he came to America. These mainly concerned the positivist concept of truth, and the point of his papers - in partic- ular, "On the Logical Positivists' Theory of Truth" and "Some Remarks on 'Facts' and 'Propositions' "5 - was to argue against Moritz Schlick's correspondence theory of truth. For Hempel, the correspondence theory was founded on the incoherent idea that propositions, or sentences, can be compared with facts. Hempel argues that talk of propositions "expressing 'facts'" is misleading because the term "indicates something which is once for ever fixed with all its characteristics, whilst it is essential for the system of scientific statements that it may always be changed again".6 The following paragraph is quite revealing: Science is a system of statements which are of one kind. Each statement may be combined or compared with each other statement, e.g. in order to draw conclu- sions from the combined statements, or to see if they are compatible with each other or not. But statements are never compared with a 'reality', with 'facts'. None of those who support a cleavage between statements and reality is able to give a precise account of how a comparison between statements and facts may possibly be accomplished, and how we may possibly ascertain the structure of facts. Therefore, that cleavage is nothing but the result of redoubling metaphysics, and all the problems connected with it are mere pseudoproblems.7 Statements can be compared only with other statements.8 When we try to describe a situation in which we are supposedly comparing a statement with a fact, it turns out, Hempel argues, that we are only comparing that statement with another statement.9 Fact talk takes you outside the confines of language, and that is not where Hempel thought we ought to venture. In contrast, all the concepts we need to do science, Hempel claimed, are purely syntactic and intra- linguistic affairs, and do not require us to look outside the language, at "reality" or "the facts". Outside the language lies the treacherous land of metaphysics. As many of you know, Hempel's view during this period was that the acceptance of observation statements was essentially a matter of convention, or community practice, and that the proper theory of truth was the coherence theory. I am not sure exactly how Hempel accommodated himself to the newly found respectability of semantics - in particular, the early Carnapian semantics that seemed tailor-made for a correspon- dence approach to truth, going clearly beyond the kind of syntactic,</page><page sequence="5">HEMPEL, EXPLANATION, METAPHYSICS 5 coherence view of truth he had earlier advocated. In 1943 Hempel published "A Purely Syntactical Definition of Confirmation"10 and the better-known "Studies in the Logic of Confirmation" came out in 1945.11 As the title of the first of these works makes clear, Hempel's methodology here was wholly syntactic. As many of you will recall, his well-known and much discussed "Raven Paradox" was first presented in the second paper, in the course of developing an account of how general hypotheses of the form "All Fs are G" are confirmed by observation of "positive instances", i.e., objects that are F and G. The paradox arises from two general principles: "the Nicod criterion" to the effect that a hypothesis of this form, "All Fs are G", is confirmed by things that are both F and G, that is, things that satisfy both the antecedent and consequent predicates ("positive instances"), and the equivalence principle to the effect that logically equivalent hypotheses are confirmed, or disconfirmed, by the same evidence. Hempel noticed that "All ravens are black" is logically equivalent to its contrapositive "All nonblack things are nonravens", and that the latter is confirmed, on the Nicod criterion, by observation of nonblack nonravens, e.g., observations of brown shoes, green cabbages, and red herrings. So by the equivalence prin- ciple, observations of these sundry nonornithological items around us should confirm "All ravens are black". The prospect of armchair ornithology was too good to be true. Hempel's own solution, in terms of syntactic constructions, was not widely accepted, and there were many proposals by others. The most telling, and perhaps simplest, solution was provided, I believe, by W.V. Quine, in his "Natural Kinds".12 Quine pointed out that the Nicod criterion is plausible only when "F' and "G" are kind terms, terms denoting real kinds in nature. "Raven" and "black" are kind terms, but "nonblack" and "nonraven" are not. There is not sufficient "similarity" among nonblack things, or among things that aren't ravens, to support inductive projections on these classes. In short, nonravens and nonblack things are not projectible kinds. Accord- ingly, observations of black ravens confirm both "All ravens are black" and "All nonblack things are nonravens", but observations of nonblack nonravens confirm neither. Note that Quine's solution brings in semantics, and also metaphysics, in a serious way. On this approach, the Nicod criterion must be given a semantical and meta-</page><page sequence="6">6 JAEGWON KIM physical interpretation stated in terms of what "F' and "G" refer to and the metaphysical nature of the items referred to. II I have dwelt on the Raven Paradox to illustrate one of my main points in this talk, namely to exhibit the restrictive constraints Hempel's syntacticalism placed on his work, and how a more freewheeling approach that doesn't shy away from semantics and metaphysics could have yielded more satisfying results. I will later argue this point in connection with Hempel's work on explanation. I will not here try to define precisely what Hempel's "syntacticalism" amounted to. For it seems clear that Hempel's metaphilosophical views underwent transformation during the '40s and '50s much in the way Carnap's did, and that he began using semantical concepts, at least "semantic" in the current sense of semantics or model theory of formal systems. And truth was no longer a taboo concept for Hempel when he began work on scientific explanation. Indeed, one of Hempel's conditions on scientific explanation is the require- ment that the statements comprising the explanans of an explanation be true. So semantics in the attenuated sense was very much in play. But in the seminal paper with Paul Oppenheim, "Studies in the Logic of Explanation"),13 formal logic, or the syntax of logical theory, was still the main vehicle of theoretical developments. Their formal definitions of law and explanation, in Part III of the paper, are entirely syntactic; although the notion of truth does make an appear- ance in the definition of "(T, C) is an explanans for E'14 (since an explanation must have true explanatory premises), Hempel and Oppenheim manage to avoid even this minimal semantic involve- ment by switching their explicandum (as some philosophers used to say) to (T, C) is a potential explanans for E'. One might argue that semantics lurks just under the syntactic surface - that even such syntactic concepts as "singular term", "quantifier", "connective", and so on are not intelligible and cannot be motivated apart from their intended semantic interpretations. That may be true, but still there is a difference between syntax and semantics, and it would be of substantive philosophical interest to know whether or not there is some shared logical form for all</page><page sequence="7">HEMPEL, EXPLANATION, METAPHYSICS 7 (potential) explanations of individual events that could be captured exclusively in syntactic terms. Be that as it may, the unavoidabil- ity of metaphysics in theory of explanation is clearly seen when the formal theory of explanation is brought into the real world, to connect with events and phenomena of the world which after all are what our explanatory activities are all about. And Hempel does provide such connections, though informally and somewhat grudgingly, between formal theory and the world. First, Hempel identifies the thing that is explained in an expla- nation, thus: "By the explanandum, we understand the sentence describing the phenomenon to be explained (not that phenomenon itself); by the explanans, the class of those sentences which are adduced to account for the phenomenon".15 So "phenomena" are introduced as the real-world things that are explained when we explain. (But notice how Hempel reserves his important theoreti- cal terms, "explanandum" and "explanans", for linguistic items, not phenomena in the world.) Elsewhere, Hempel also uses the terms "event" and "condition" for the same purposes, to refer not only to the things given, or "described", by the explanandum but also the things described by singular sentences of the explanans - what Hempel often refers to as "antecedent conditions". But, except in one surprising paragraph that I will come to later, Hempel never raises serious questions about the nature of entities belonging to these metaphysical categories. In any case, it is clear that the informal semantics of the formal theory of explanation that Hempel was constructing postulates an ontological domain of events, condi- tions, and phenomena, whatever these are. Another way in which metaphysics intrudes into the Hempelian picture is through his belief - although, as I will later argue, he remained fundamentally ambivalent about this - that in building his theory of explanation in "Studies in the Logic of Explanation", he is giving an account of causal explanation. At the very outset of the article, after giving an informal example of an explanation, he writes: Thus, the event under discussion is explained by subsuming it under general laws, i.e., by showing that it occurred in accordance with those laws, in virtue of the realization of certain specified antecedent conditions. 16 He goes on to say in the next paragraph:</page><page sequence="8">8 JAEGWON KIM Thus, here again, the question 'Why does the phenomenon occur?' is construed as meaning 'according to what general laws, and by virtue of what antecedent conditions does the phenomenon occur?'17 Expressions like "in virtue of' and "by virtue of" unmistakably signal a dependency relation, and reference to "antecedent condi- tions" indicates that the kind of dependency involved here is causal dependency. These explanations explain the occurrence of an event by specifying its temporally antecedent causes. Hempel is more explicit about all this when he later writes: The type of explanation which has been considered here so far is often referred to as causal explanation. If E describes a particular event, then the antecedent circumstances described [by the singular sentences of the explanans] may be said jointly to 'cause' that event ... 18 And in the course of arguing that the familiar desire-belief explana- tion of actions conforms to his D-N paradigm, Hempel says: The determining motives and beliefs, therefore, have to be classified among the antecedent conditions of a motivational explanation, and there is no formal difference on this account between motivational and causal explanation. 19 For most of us, I think, it is precisely this kind of causal associ- ation and background that accounts for the great initial plausibility and appeal of Hempel's theory of explanation and constitutes its very substantial intuitive content. In fact, we can think of Hempel's D-N model of explanation (when applied to individual events) as giving a sort of Humean nomological analysis of causal relations. The ironic thing is that the official theory, not only the formal logical account of Part III of "Studies in the Logic of Explana- tion" but also the less formal but more important exposition in Part I, abjures mention of cause or causal explanation, and does not appear seriously motivated or constrained by causal consider- ations. Causation and causal explanation remain out of the picture as far as the official story is concerned. There is no requirement that the singular sentences of the explanans "specify" or "describe" events or conditions temporally antecedent to the event specified by the explanandum, or that the explanatory laws be, in some sense, "causal laws" (and not, for example, regularities between collateral effects of a single cause process). There is not even the requirement that the singular sentences of the explanans be "event describing"</page><page sequence="9">HEMPEL, EXPLANATION, METAPHYSICS 9 - that is, that they be sentences of the sort that can specify the occurrence of events. Actually, Hempel explicitly refuses to require, for explanations of individual events, that the explanans include any singular sentences at all, on the ground that it is possible to formulate a singular explanation by universally instantiating a law. Here Hempel appears to be thinking that the following would be a perfectly good singular explanation: Every F is G. Therefore, if a is an F, a is G. Now, one wants to ask: In what sense is this an explanation? In what sense is there here an event, or phenomenon, to be explained? The explanandum is a conditional sentence, "If a is an F, a is G". It does not, in any sense that we can understand, assert the occurrence of an event or state or phenomenon; rather it says that if a certain condi- tion, namely a's being F, obtains, then another state or condition, a's being G, will obtain. This conditional itself is not, at least need not be countenanced as, a condition or state or event or phenomenon in its own right. You might say: There is the fact, if not an event or state, that if a is F, a is G, and this fact is explained by the law "Every F is G". But this is not convincing. For this "explanation" would hold for anything, whether or not it has property F - that is, every object whatever in this world. This means that the explanandum is only a reiteration of the explanatory law, and it is hard to see how the supposed explanation sheds any explanatory illumination on anything. As far as I know, the first wave of counterexamples against Hempel's D-N model was inspired by Sylvain Bromberger's Empire State Building case (sometimes called "the flagpole case") in the early '60s. Bromberger pointed out that just as we could derive the length of the shadow of the Empire State Building from its height and the laws of optics (and the subtended angle), we could also deduce the height of the building from the length of the shadow. But the former deduction, intuitively, counts as an explanation but the latter does not; that is, we can explain the length of the shadow in terms of the height of the building, but not the way around. Hempel's formal theory apparently had no resources to account for this asym- metry. Now, from a metaphysical point of view, the nature of this</page><page sequence="10">10 JAEGWON KIM asymmetry is quite obvious: it is an instance of causal asymmetry. That is, the height of the building, with the position of the sun fixed, causes it to cast a shadow of a certain length, but it is not the case that the length of the shadow causes the building to have the height it has. A number of purported counterexamples to the D-N model made the same point; just to mention some of the better known ones, you may recall the barometer reading/oncoming rainstorm case and the case of the length and period of swing of the pendulum. Further, there are nonexplanatory laws, statements of lawful regu- larities that are incapable of supporting explanatory connections. These laws may correlate two properties, or physical magnitudes, that are symptomatic aspects of a third, more fundamental, property or process. One often-cited example is the Widemann-Franz Law correlating electric and thermal conductivity in metals.20 It is plain that we cannot explain why a given piece of metal has the electric conductivity it has, or the thermal conductivity it has, by invoking this law. Again, the apparent reason for this is the perceived lack of an appropriate dependency relation between the two magnitudes. Classic gas laws seem to be similar to the Wiedemann-Franz Law in this respect. To appreciate the pervasiveness of the problem involved, consider the following: The D-N account tells us that we can explain why this rod is expanding by pointing out that it is a metallic object and is being heated, and invoking the law that metals expand when heated. However, the D-N model also sanctions the following as an explanation, just as good as the one we just saw: Metals expand when heated. This metal rod is not expanding. Therefore, it is not being heated. But this hardly strikes us as any kind of explanation. Notice that this pattern of counterexamples guarantees that virtually every D-N argument that is a potential explanation can be turned, by using the explanatory law contrapositively, into another D-N argument that probably won't be an explanation, even potentially. A simple way of handling this range of counterexamples is to specify that the events and conditions invoked in the explanans be, jointly, a cause of the event specified by the explanandum, and/or that laws invoked in the explanans be causal laws. For all these</page><page sequence="11">HEMPEL, EXPLANATION, METAPHYSICS 1I1 cases fail to be explanatory on account of a single reason: an appro- priate causal relation is either absent, or the purported explanation goes in a direction that is the reverse of the causal relation.21 I wonder whether a philosopher now working on explanation would, or should, avoid this route, namely making use of causal concepts in building a theory of explanation. It is of course a further question how we ought to analyze causation. One might feel that causation and explanation are so closely related that using one to explain the other is not doing much in the way of casting philosophical illumination on either. Perhaps, philosophers like Wesley Salmon22 and Paul Humphreys23 feel this way, since they both make crucial use of causal concepts in their theories of explanation but go on to offer us substantial theories of causality. I do not believe that taking causation among one's basic resources in building a theory of explanation makes the project trivial, or uninformatively easy, by any means. First of all, a full theory of explanation must be above all a theory of understanding, and it is by no means obvious - in fact, this, I believe, is one of the really deep questions in the epistemology of science - why and how causal knowledge enhances under- standing. Second, not all explanations, not even those that concern individual events and occurrences, are causal explanations; causa- tion, though important, is clearly not the only venue for achieving understanding. Hempel would have resisted taking causation as a primitive for his theory. At this point in his career, I don't think that he would have rejected causation on the ground that it is an illegitimate meta- physical concept. What is more likely, he would have said that doing so would be explaining explanation by a concept that is at least as much in need of clarification as explanation. Actually, he might have said something more deflationary, something similar to what he said about the notion of understanding or verstehen, namely that it is a psychologistic and anthropomorphic concept (rooted in our intuitive notions of agency and power) with no precise intersubjective criteria of application. No doubt, Hempel would have been horrified by the idea of using the concept of understanding as a primitive in a theory of scientific explanation. I believe Hempel's attitude was that for a philosophical understanding of science, there is no need for the concept of causation, and that the salvageable part of this concept</page><page sequence="12">12 JAEGWON KIM is fully captured in the idea of bringing a pair of events under a general law - that is, by the D-N, or nomic-subsumptive, model of explanation. This in fact seems to have been Hempel's later view; he wrote: In the explanatory or predictive use of a deterministic theory, then, the notion of a cause as a more or less narrowly circumscribed antecedent event has been replaced by that of some antecedent state of the total system, which provides the 'initial conditions' for the computation, by means of the theory, of the later state that is to be explained.24 And Hempel dismisses cases like the Empire State Building by pointing to the vagueness and indeterminateness of the common- sense notion of what can explain what. He wasn't about to take seriously metaphysical notions like causal dependency, or depend- ency in general, as a metaphysical underpinning of explanatory relations. For him, subsumption-under-a-law remained the funda- mental core idea of explanation - fundamental in the sense that it requires no further support or backing from any other source, especially something metaphysical. As we saw, Hempel talks of "antecedent conditions" in connec- tion with the singular sentences in the explanans. He also refers to them as "events", and I was surprised to find that he had something to say about events that is quite close to what is now called "the property exemplification theory". In the Hempel-Oppenheim paper, we read: When we spoke of the explanation of a single event, the term 'event' referred to the occurrence of some more or less complex characteristic in a specified spatio- temporal location or in a certain individual object, and not all the characteristics of that object, or to all that goes on in that space-time region.25 I don't see anything objectionably metaphysical in this notion of an event, or, for that matter, in the common preanalytic notion of an event.26 If Hempel had taken this concept of an event seriously as a philosophical resource, he could easily have handled another class of vexing counterexamples to his account. Consider the following argument: All ravens are black. Wilbur is a nonblack raven, or he has the flu. Therefore, Wilbur has the flu.</page><page sequence="13">HEMPEL, EXPLANATION, METAPHYSICS 13 (If you don't think "All ravens are black" is a law, you can run this argument with your favorite law.) This is another perfectly nice D-N argument; in fact, it satisfies the elaborate formal requirements developed in Part III of "Studies in the Logic of Explanation", and we may assume all of the sentences in this argument are true. But the argument is obviously and wholly nonexplanatory. If this argument were allowed to stand as an explanation, everything under the sun could be explained on the basis of but one law: For any arbitrary explanandum p, we have the following D-N argument: All ravens are black. Wilbur is a nonblack raven, or p. Therefore, p. Again, a metaphysical remedy is close at hand: each singular premise in the explanans must specify an event, or an antecedent condition if you wish.27 The disjunctive premise in the above explanation obviously fails to do so. These examples are a bit far-fetched and may strike you as the inventions of a philosopher hell-bent on finding counterexamples. In thinking about mental causation, I have recently had to consider the explanatory import of the following kind of situation: Suppose you want to explain why a certain person, call her Mary, is experiencing pains in her joints. Mary has been diagnosed to have either lupus or rheumatoid arthritis, and it is known, let us suppose, that patients with either of these diseases have pains in their joints. Consider then the following argument: Mary has either lupus or rheumatoid arthritis. Patients with lupus have pains in their joints. So do patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Therefore, Mary has pains in her joints. Another perfectly nice D-N argument! I would urge, though, that here we do not as yet have an explanation of pains in Mary's joints. We do not know what is causing her pains. True, we have narrowed the possible explanations to two, and know that one or the other must be the correct explanation. But to have an explanation of Mary's condition, to know its cause, we have more work to do: we must find out whether Mary has lupus or rheumatoid arthritis. Here, we have a disjunction of two (possible) explanations, not a single disjunctive</page><page sequence="14">14 JAEGWON KIM explanation. The reason for this is simple: the singular premise, the disjunctive sentence "Mary has either lupus or rheumatoid arthritis" fails to specify the occurrence of an event or state. It says one or the other of the two conditions obtains, but that is not the same thing as stating the occurrence of a specific condition. This is closely related to - it is in fact another aspect of - the fact that there is no such disjunctive disease as "lupus or rheumatoid arthritis". And this in turn is related to the metaphysical principle that disjunctions of kinds are not necessarily kinds, or that kindhood, or propertyhood, is not closed under disjunction. This shows, I hope, what the infusion of a little serious meta- physics into Hempel's conceptual arsenal could have done to streamline his theory of explanation. Unless you appeal to meta- physics there seems no obvious way of getting around the last counterexample. If your method is wholly syntactic, it would be difficult to justify the banning of certain disjunctions (perhaps, also conditionals), but not conjunctions, from singular premises of the explanans. Of course I am not urging that we banish all disjunctive singular sentences from explanations; it may be that some disjunc- tive sentences can serve to specify events and states, and that some disjunctive predicates pick out genuine kinds. III I now turn to another aspect of the theory of explanation - to praise Hempel's D-N model, not to complain about it. In insisting that explanation be logical derivation - moreover, derivation from premises including laws - Hempel's D-N model lays stress on one essential aspect of explanation that is missed by other theories that overtly deny, or neglect, the derivational aspect of explanation. Even some very early critics of Hempel excoriated him for requir- ing that explanations be logical derivations. Michael Scriven was one of Hempel's most persistent critics, contesting him on virtually every point. Scriven even took issue with Hempel's assumption that the explanandum of an explanation be true, arguing that even events that are fictional or nonexistent can be explained. In any case, one of the more notable claims Scriven made was that explanations are not arguments or derivations, and that a single statement standing alone,</page><page sequence="15">HEMPEL, EXPLANATION, METAPHYSICS 15 like "The bridge collapsed because a bomb exploded", can be a full explanation. Further, he argued that laws cannot properly be viewed as part of an explanation, and that inclusion of laws in an explanation is to confuse explanations with "grounds" for explanations.28 If laws are expunged from explanations, explanations could no longer be derivations. Scriven has not been alone in claiming that explanations are typically not arguments or derivations, and that singular statements standing alone can fully serve as explanations. In a kind of back- handed compliment, Salmon, one of the most influential theorists of explanation, has called the view that explanations are arguments "the third dogma of empiricism".29 Let us look at what James Woodward, one of the more recent advocates of the nonderivational approach, has to say. He argues that the following statements can be full explanations in their own right: (1) The short-circuit caused the fire. (2) The blow of the hammer caused the chestnut to shatter. Woodward goes on to state his basic position: According to the view I defend, singular causal sentences and singular causal explanations do not differ fundamentally in structure in this way. A singular explanation will simply consist of a sentence which reports a causal connection like (1) or (2) above. Singular causal explanations are extensional on both the cause-side and the effect-side ... 30 This view, the doctrine of singular explanations, is particularly common among philosophers who associate explanations closely with causation. David Lewis is another such philosopher: according to him, to give a causal explanation of an event is to give information about its causal history, that is, the series of events that is the causal ancestry of the event to be explained.31 On this approach, there need be no significant connection between explanation and derivation; there is no reason to think that derivations, or arguments, are the only way, or even the main way, of providing causal information. A single statement standing alone, or sets of statements not configured as a derivation, can clearly do the job. Any theorist who is an extreme realist about explanations is espe- cially apt to embrace this approach. Suppose that you believe that explanatory relations, at least those between individual events, must</page><page sequence="16">16 JAEGWON KIM be backed, or supported, by causal relations. That is, for the occur- rence of an event c to explain why an event, e, occurred, it must be the case that c caused e. On this view, the objective content of the statement that "c explains e" is given by the fact that c caused e, and the information about the world that is carried by the explanation is exhausted by the causal information, information about what caused the event to be explained. If all this is the case, it is only natural to suppose that a statement of the form "c caused e" is an explanation of e in terms of c. What more can one expect? Of course, one could go on and supply further information as to why c qualifies as e's cause, by what process c caused e, and so on, but this is information that goes beyond explaining e. Explanation of e is done when we have in hand the true singular causal statement "c caused e". We know the cause of e, and hence we have an explanation, causal explanation, of e. But let us look at this more closely. Consider Woodward's (1) and (2) above. He claims that these statements, of the form "X caused Y", are referentially transparent at both positions "X" and "Y', on account of the fact that causation is an extensional relation. But consider the result of replacing the referential terms in, say, the first of these statements via the following identities (which we assume to be true): (3) The short circuit = the event that Mildred blamed on Harry. (4) The fire = the top news event of the year. What we get is this causal statement: (5) The event that Mildred blamed on Harry caused the top news event of the year. Given that (1) and (2) are true, (5) is no doubt a true causal state- ment, and "the fact" reported by it, we may concede, is the very same causal fact reported by the original statement. But clearly we have lost something in moving from (1) to (5). It is also clear what has been lost: we have lost crucial explanatory information. What (5) doesn't tell us is what it is about the purported cause that can help us understand why this particular event occurred. In fact, we don't even know what our explanandum event really is. We might even consider proper names for events: call the short circuit "Charlie" and the fire "Dave". What explanation do we get from being told that</page><page sequence="17">HEMPEL, EXPLANATION, METAPHYSICS 17 "Charlie caused Dave"? What explanatory insight or illumination do we gain when we are told this? Obviously none.32 To my mind, the crucial virtue of the D-N model is the fact that it forces an explanation to bring into the open the explanatorily salient properties of the phenomena involved - properties that do the real explanatory work. When the explanation is a causal explanation, it must point us to the causally efficacious or relevant properties in virtue of which the purported cause brought about the event to be explained. And for this to happen, the descriptions, or referen- tial expressions, that are used must tell us something about these causally (therefore, explanatorily) salient properties. This is why (5) carries little explanatory information whereas (1) clearly does. The point is that although causation may be an extensional relation, explanation is not.33 This is why bare singular causal statements can be wholly unsat- isfying, and totally useless, as explanations. "X caused Y' may tell us no more than that there is a causal explanation of Y somewhere. The virtue of Hempelian D-N explanations consists in the fact that they wear this crucial explanatory information on their sleeve. It makes evident what it is about the event, or events, invoked in the explanans that causally explains the explanandum event. The reason it does this is that laws, or causal laws, are actually used, not simply named or assumed to exist, in an explanation. When we know what the explanatory laws are, we know what the explanato- rily, or causally, efficacious properties are. Without this knowledge we have no explanation; we do not understand why the event we want to have explained occurred. To summarize, then, explanations must tell us something about the explanatorily or causally efficacious/relevant properties, and that is what the D-N model guarantees. To be sure, the D-N model may be asking too much: it requires that we be told about all the prop- erties that are relevant - at least, all such properties holding at a given time. But often we look for an explanation to fill a particular gap in our understanding and all we need may be one small bit of relevant information. Does this mean that the D-N model is an overkill? Hardly. What we should do is to take a D-N explanation as an explanatory ideal and consider various context-dependent ways in which a real-life explanation can approximate this ideal and meet</page><page sequence="18">18 JAEGWON KIM our needs here and now.34 In this sense, the D-N model can serve as an indispensable reference point. This way of looking at Hempel's theory of explanation is consis- tent with my earlier promotion of greater metaphysical involvement on the part of theories of explanation. We may require that expla- nations invoke causal laws, and that the singular premises of the explanans specify individual events and states. But this is consis- tent with the further requirement that explanations must ideally be deductive and nomological. This insistence is what guarantees that our explanations provide us with the explanatory information and illumination that we seek. And I take this to be the crucial contribution of Hempel's D-N theory of explanation.35 In closing, I want to note Hempel's great service to philosophy of science, and philosophy in general, through his repeated insistence that in doing science, or seeking knowledge, we are not merely in search of more facts but rather we are seeking an understand- ing and illumination of the multitude of phenomena encountered in our experience. It is true that the particular way in which Hempel developed his theory of explanation was heavily influenced by his positivist commitments, and that he did not give full play to the important metaphysical, epistemic, and psychological components of knowledge and understanding. But that is entirely understand- able given his intellectual and philosophical context. But then we are working in our own cultural context. It is a wonderful feeling that we continue to learn from Peter Hempel's work, a body of work that teaches us what genuine intellectual honesty and integrity really mean.

For details, see my "Explanatory Knowledge and Metaphysical Dependence", Philosophical Issues 5 (1994), 51-69. 22 See his Scientific Explanation and the Causal Structure of the World, Prince- ton: Princeton University Press, 1984. 23 In The Chances of Explanation, Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1989. 24 Aspects of Scientific Explanation, p. 351. 25 Aspects of Scientific Explanation, p. 253. 26 I noticed this paragraph for the first time when I was reading the Hempel- Oppenheim paper for this occasion. As some will recognize, the idea here is the core of the property exemplification theory of events, something I had a hand in developing (see "Events as Property Exemplifications", reprinted in my Supervenience and Mind, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1993). I was shocked to realize that the basic idea of this approach had been present in Hempel all along! But who knows - I was perhaps subliminally influenced by this para- graph, since I must have read this paper at least a dozen times (my doctoral dissertation, written under Hempel's supervision, was on explanation). 27 It is interesting and instructive to note that David Kaplan, in his revision of the Hempel-Oppenheim definition, requires that C, the initial condition statement in the explanans, be a conjunction of basic sentences, where a basic sentence is either an atomic sentence or the negation of one. (See his "Explanation Revisited",</page><page sequence="20">20 JAEGWON KIM Philosophy of Science 28 (1961), 429-436.) If we think of the primitive predicates of a scientific theory as denoting kinds or properties recognized in that theory, it is plausible to think of an atomic sentence as affirming the occurrence of an event that consists in the instantiation of a property in the domain of the theory involved and the negation of an atomic sentence as denying the occurrence of an event. This means that, although Kaplan's requirement was motivated exclusively on formal grounds, it can be taken as a syntactic enforcement of the metaphysical constraint of the sort I have in mind here. 28 Scriven, M.

(1986): 'Causal Explanation', in his Philosophical Papers II, New York and Oxford: Oxford University Press. 32 This may be one reason why we do not normally use proper names for events and find such designators as "the top news event of the year", "the event I was just thinking about", as in some sense nonstandard and not telling us what an event "really" is. 33 This point was stressed by Davidson, D. (1980): 'Causal Relations' reprinted in his Essays on Actions and Events, New York: Oxford University Press. 34 I believe Peter Railton has advocated a similar approach. 35 I should note that Michael Friedman and Philip Kitcher are among the few who have stayed with Hempel's claim that explanations involve arguments.
