<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS misinterpretation due to lack of clarity (such as a comment made concerning Goethe's "embrace of Vulcanist theory"[ 9]). Using "culture" as a catchword for his own agenda, Stephenson tends to systematize Goethe within a mass of terminology and labels, sometimes out of context; other terms, such as "modern," "science," and "symbol" remain undefined and nonspecific. Supportive quotes are frequently overemphasized or distorted (such as comments on quantitative methods [3, 4, 86]), and terms such as "dynamism," "mechanism," and "progress" are given questionable definitions (37). Chapter 6 identifies "knowledge" and "science" as the "two poles of culture," while maintaining that "science aspires to knowledge" (92). Finally, Stephenson critiques and misinterprets Karl Fink's Kuhnian approach, yet he goes on to support similar premises within his own text, such as Goethe's need for history of science within science (36, 39), his anthropomorphism (44), identification of language as metaphorical (45), cultural (26), and as medium of expression (63), narrative as communication (68), and science as value-laden (44). Although the bibliography is extensive enough, most of the quoted references on Goethe and science are pre-1985 with the exception of Amrine, and Stephenson rarely quotes primary sources other than Goethe. Problematic despite good intentions, Stephenson's overpriced text promises more than it delivers. While serving perhaps as a "corrective" to History of Science scholars, the book offers little to current Goethe research. LORI WAGNER, University of Pennsylvania Katharina von Hammerstein. Sophie Mereau-Brentano: Freiheit-Liebe-Weiblichkeit. Trikolore sozialer und individueller Selbstbestimmung um 1800. Beitrage zur neueren Literaturgeschichte, Dritte Folge, Band 132. Heidelberg: Universitits Verlag C. Winter, 1994. Pp. 325. Cloth DM 98.00, OS 764.00, Sfr 98.00. Katharina von Hammerstein, editor of Sophie Mereau-Brentano's Werkausgabe (Munich: Deutscher Taschenbuch Verlag, 1995) as well as of the forthcoming new edition of the writer's novellas, originally began exploring Mereau's literary and personal writings in her UCLA dissertation. Now the latest critical monograph on Mereau-Brentano (1770-1806), the study provides a thematic literary portrait of this until recently neglected woman writer. Inspired by the ideals of the French Revolution but trapped in a German political climate that pushed her, like most of her peers, into a merely contemplative role, Mereau naively expected love to act as a utopian force towards freedom and social change. In her tripartite study, Hammerstein first analyzes Mereau's concept of freedom, then looks at her male and female protagonists in order to see whether these accept or rebel against the gender roles of their time, and finally examines how Mereau's idea of freedom determined the heterosexual love relationships in her fiction. 379</page><page sequence="2">GERMAN STUDIES REVIEW Explicitly stating her affinity with New Historicism as well as feminist literary criticism albeit, without successfully integrating these approaches into her readings, Hammerstein's study concludes that Mereau's central male and female characters demonstrate identical character traits: they are love-centered, sensitive, and tolerant and display an unselfish level of generosity. Yet, Hammerstein points out, some of Mereau's minor characters are still cast in the stereotypical dichotomies of female naturalness and intuition versus male fragmentation and rationality. This conclusion underlines that Mereau-Brentano's writings largely share the Romanticists' liberal views of love, complementing them from her own perspective without, however, pressing for radical feminism. Although this monograph is a welcome contribution to the existing scholarship on Sophie Mereau-Brentano, Hammerstein does not succeed in communicating her longstanding enthusiasm for this author to the curious reader. This is partly due to the style of the monograph but, perhaps even more importantly, to the kind of questions this study addresses. By constructing her study around the topics of freedom, love and femininity, and by loosely connecting this universal aspect of Mereau's work to that of more recent German women writers, Hammerstein advocates incorporating this author into the German literary canon and female literary tradition. However, Hammerstein does not address the particularities of Sophie Mereau Brentano's writings which might explain why this author has, until recently, been omitted from literary history or why we should acquaint ourselves with this author's work now. BETTINA BRANDT, Columbia University Elke P. Frederiksen and Katherine R. Goodman, eds. Bettina Brentano-von Arnim: Gender and Politics (Kritik: German Literary Theory and Cultural Studies). Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1995. Pp. 439. $39.95. This is a collection of twelve essays about one of Germany's most lauded, controversial and only recently studied female figures, arranged in five chapters and dedicated to Christa Wolf. Both the introduction by the editors and Wolf's recently translated Letter about Bettine are excellent, setting a tone of investigation that transcends the obvious and breaks new scholarly ground with originality and esprit. The book is well-researched and contains an excellent scholarly apparatus. There are a few eccentricities of style, one of which involves the spelling of cowardice as "cowardess" in a reference to Christa Wolf's publication Was bleibt, (33). Elsewhere, Bettina "pours" over pamphlets of the French Revolution (129). One strong aspect of this text is its elucidation of Brentano-von Arnim's contribution to springing the traditional definitions of genre. We read about Bettina's political letters (French, 71-94), about her quasi-factual "Tale of the 380</page></plain_text>
