<plain_text><page sequence="1">H. Cooper A Therapist's Response to "A Limited God" Howard Cooper * A certain philosopher used to hang about wherever children were at play. And whenever he saw a boy with a top, he would lie in wait. As soon as the top began to spin the philosopher went in pursuit and tried to catch it. He was not perturbed when the children noisily protested and tried to keep him away from their toy; so long as he could catch the top while it was still spinning, he was happy, but only for a moment; then he threw it to the ground and walked away. For he believed that the understanding of any detail, that of a spinning top, for instance, was sufficient for the understanding of all things. For this reason he did not busy himself with great problems, it seemed to him uneconomical; once the smallest detail was properly understood, then everything was understood, which was why he busied himself only with the spinning top. And whenever preparations were being made for the spinning of the top, he hoped that this time he would succeed; as soon as the top began to spin and he was running breathlessly after it, the hope would turn to certainty; but when he held the silly piece of wood in his hand, he felt nauseated, and the screaming of the children, which hitherto he had not heard and which now suddenly pierced his ears, chased him away; he reeled off like a top under a clumsy whip. Franz Kafka 1 Each week I hear the theologian speak. Each week I think at some point: here is a way of approaching and understanding the topic. Each week I grasp the ideas presented, or grasp at them, only to find in the end that they fail to convince me. It's not exactly that I am left (to pick up the parable's metaphor) with the dead wood of worn-out thinking, but their way of addressing the issues raised by the Holocaust fails (for me) to make any real sense - any real human sense - of what happened. What remains is, in Kafka's words, the screaming of the children. Called upon now, as the therapist, I have begun with a parable - an act of literary, artistic * Howard Cooper is a Rabbi and a psychotherapist. He is co-author of A Sense of Belonging: Dilemmas of British Jewish Identity. He is also the editor of Soul Searching: Studies in Judaism and Psychotherapy . A Therapists Response imagination - and proceeding intuitively and obliquely for reasons which I hope will become clearer, want to set next to it a statement by a theologian. Irving Greenberg has stated that the working principle of theology after the Shoah must be that "no statement theological or otherwise should be made that would not be credible in the presence of burning children".2 This is a powerful, provocative statement. Maybe we then feel, following Wittgenstein, "of that which one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent". The therapist knows that silence and waiting and not-knowing and not-understanding can sometimes be the only and the necessary way of being with pain and the incomprehensible. Theory is both highly desirable and necessary - and completely irrelevant. Without a human response all our insights can be profoundly beside the point. So if I respond now it is only with a high degree of provisionality and hesitancy. Tony Bayfield's paper is a model exposition of the theme. He has recapitulated some of the ideas we have heard up till now over the weeks, but set them in the necessary context of theodicy, as well as pointing a way forward for theological speculation. I wish I could have written it and I wish I could respond with anything like the clarity and lucidity of his presentation. But even if I could - which I doubt - I think I would not do so. Not just because this evening my time is limited but because the subject matter itself calls out of me the awareness that any response to the Holocaust is partial and fragmentary. To respond elliptically is the best I can do. Comprehensive answers to the problem of evil are spiritual defeats. They would not be credible in the presence of burning children. All I can do is to outline some areas we need to discuss. What has made these evenings difficult for me is that we do not seem to have a shared ground for a dialogue. The therapist and the theologian seem to be speaking different languages. There is a gap between the language of theology (at least as represented in the series so far) and that of psychotherapy/analysis. The realist theology which Tony has so finely presented attempts to describe external reality. It tries to get at the truth about how reality is constituted. Even when it is provisional, it moves towards objective statements, particularly about God.

Cooper adjusted, in the light of the reality of the incontrovertible human experience of pain and evil. The religious thinker tries to understand personal experience by means of an explanation of what is happening "out there". Such theology moves towards objective metaphysical resolutions of the spiritual tensions in life. I personally find this intellectually attractive but emotionally unhelpful. Usually such explanations feel, in the end, irrelevant, and occasionally obscene. I keep Greenberg's statement before me. It seems to me that the problems of religion must not be solved abstractly in thought, but concretely in human existence.3 I would suggest that theology needs to be translated into - transformed into - spirituality; and that psychology is one of the tools available to help us with this work. This leads me to a second area. We speak of God as good or just or loving or suffering or limited. Through this projection onto the divine of human attributes and qualities we are creating God in our own image. This is an old problem: anthropomorphism, the personification of God using emotions familiar from our own interpersonal experience. We still insist on talking of God as a personality, and trying to explain His/Her actions - or lack of actions. (Even the mystical notion of the En Sof , which tries to get round this problem, still seems to be trapped within anthropomorphic thinking.) The Biblical I am who I am , which resists Moses's attempts to label it, points to a reality still too mysterious for us: the four-letter name of God, YHWH , a neologism made up of the past, present and the future tenses of the verb to be. YHWH : being and becoming . . . that which is . . . An energy which animates the universe, and which is beyond good and evil, is both more than and less than we can tolerate. I want to develop this point now - the problems we make for ourselves when we project human attributes onto a deity. To understand how psychotherapy can help us transform theology into spirituality we have to go (very briefly) by way of two seminal thinkers of modern times. What I will now say is crude to the point of caricature. Please forgive the shorthand. Immanuel Kant's enquiry into the process by which the human mind converts formless experience into ordered objective knowledge led him to a change of viewpoint as revolutionary as that of Copernicus. Kant saw that the mind does not receive objectivity, it confers it. In other words, the principles by which we make sense of the world are not in a world above us, as Plato had suggested, but in our own heads. Order, moral values and laws are not transcendent, i.e. located in a supernatural world. They are not "beyond us on the far side of experience but tucked away unnoticed on the near side of experience".4 When that which creates order out of chaos is seen to be ourselves, this spells the end of the objective God of realist theology. When certain traditional religious images of God are seen as the mythic projections of the human mind we enter a new world of thinking. And I do not think that Judaism - at least as we commonly talk about it - has really adapted itself to the implications of this new way of thinking. Fifty years after Kant, in the middle of the 19th century, Kierkegaard acknowledged that the days of dogmatic theology were over. He opted instead for a radical restatement of the religious position. He accepts anthropocentricism - human beings at the centre of spiritual life, using religious ideas not as external constraints on behaviour but as tools to inspire us and guide us inwardly.5 If there is to be faith in God then it must be subjective and existential. Nietzsche was right: the God "out there" is no more. God is not factual, but an ideal which gives worth to our lives. In that sense theodicy is now redundant. And so to therapy and a third area of response to "A Limited God". Psychoanalysis - psychoanalytic thinking - is one of the true heirs of the Enlightenment. In spite of Freud's attempts to outline an objective and scientific model of understanding about the true underlying workings of the human mind, the questions that psychoanalysis asks are not in fact about Truth with a capital T. And this is where our dialogue becomes very tricky. The question the analyst asks is not "Is that true?", but "What in your personal history disposes you to believe that?" Here I am following Adam Phillips' formulation from a lecture given at Leo Baeck College last year. "From a psychoanalytic point of view", he said, "belief changes from being a question about the qualities of the object of belief to a question about the history of the subject, the believer. What is the unconscious problem that your belief solves for you, or the wishes that it satisfies?".6 And here I feel we are at a certain crux. When Tony says, "If God is not good then faith as we 42 European Judaism, Vol, 26, No. 1, Spring 1993 ( Issue 50)</page><page sequence="3">H. Cooper A Therapists Response know it is profoundly threatened", I want to say, "Yes indeed, now we are getting somewhere". The patient who feels that their previous way of thinking and feeling and adaptation to the world is being profoundly threatened is on the threshold of a potential breakthrough - even though it may feel like a breakdown. The point I am making is that perhaps we have to face this threat to our faith in full seriousness. Perhaps we have to create a thology which is not an attempt to solve an unconscious problem or satisfy an infantile wish. We may not be able to keep God good. We may not be able to keep a traditional God at all. Judaism may have to discard theism as we discarded animal sacrifices. Certain religious concepts and forms may become redundant as we make religion subjective and existential. Perhaps the trauma of the Holocaust will force us - as the destruction of the Temple did 2000 years ago - into completely new ways of conceptualizing how we are to relate to that divine energy which animates all of existence including ourselves, especially ourselves. But now I can hear myself treading into theological territory again. I will resist this temptation. I now need to speak, as a therapist, about how we make an idol out of God. This is my next point. What do people want a God for? Human needs, desires, and fears are manifold and we may look for and create a God to meet our needs and desires or allay our fears. Some people want a paternal God whom they can revere and feel protected by; others want a maternal God who would enfold and nourish them. Whether the God we create is one which helps us recreate the security of childhood or one who compensates us for a security which was never enjoyed is not the point here. What we must recognize is how deeply we need to feel secure, protected, contained, understood, accepted - and how we search for a God to meet these infantile but also adult needs. The psychological defences against experiences of impotence, helplessness, meaninglessness and despair are many. And we all need some defences against these potentially persecutory feelings. But if we create for ourselves - in whatever form we do it - a God image designed to console us and comfort us in the face of our human neediness and distress, then at least we should be honest in what we are doing. And that honestly includes not conferring an objectivity upon the product of our own imaginative thinking. I want to be clear here about one thing. I am not advocating that we discard our images of God because they are, inevitably, personal constructs. On the contrary, the idea of God can perform a vital function for human growth. At their best both religion and psychotherapy share a similar quest for meaning and wholeness. We need a framework in which to ask our questions - even if we know that the answers will simply be doorways to another set of questions. The promised land is always beyond us, over the horizon, in the next chapter, just beyond the rim of consciousness. But I think psychotherapeutic thinking can help religion grow up. It can suggest that living with ambivalence is a spiritual achievement. And that certainty in our thinking is not a goal, but an obstacle to maturity. It can encourage religious believers to simply affirm a set of values to which they aspire, with a God image which allows religious ideals to function freely and a God image which grows and develops as the believer struggles with the vicissitudes of life. Such a believer, however, will be unable to make objective statements about the existence of God. He or she will merely be able to affirm subjectively that a notion of God is being constructed - perhaps in dialogue with the tradition - as a way of creating personal meaning. Such affirmations that arise from personal experience and struggle are, I think, quite different from affirmations made in order to deny despair or out of wish-fulfilment. This of course is consistent with the Jewish mission, at least as I understand it - to aspire to be "Israel", that is the one who struggles with God. The God thus created is not limited but limitless. Nevertheless, as traditional images are left behind, we may end up with a more limited notion of God. But once we withdraw our projections, our compensation is that we can recognize in ourselves what we have previously attributed to God. Not only are we capable of evil and immense destructiveness, but our caring and creative capacities are enormous. Perhaps we can even say that at its best our creativity - which includes our ethical activity - is truly divine. To come to understand - to know - that the divine is not "out there" but in us is the work of a lifetime. And to know that the divine may not just be in us but may also be a reflection of an European Judaism, Vol, 26, No. 1, Spring 1993 (Issue 50) 43</page><page sequence="4">Poland and the Jews D. Marmur energy greater than ourselves - that may be understood in a moment. Any post-holocaust theology must proceed by way of paradox. Which leads me to my final point. I started with Kafka, the maestro of paradox, and I will end with him too. And that is because what the creative artistic mind does is to tackle the ultimate questions indirectly: through images, metaphors, paradox. Art allows our questions room to breathe. For without resolving the unanswerable questions of meaning, art creates images which are true, even though - or perhaps especially when - they point beyond themselves. As one of Kafka's aphorisms has it: "The true way leads along a tightrope, which is not stretched aloft but just above the ground. It seems designed more to trip one than to be walked along."7 Notes 1. Franz Kafka, Shorter Works , Vol. 1, p. 141, Seeker &amp; Warburg, London, 1973. 2. Quoted in Mare H.
