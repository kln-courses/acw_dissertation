<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS 519 NORDAU'S INTERPRETATION OF HISTORY ' Since the publication of his famous work on Degeneration2 Max Nordau has been recognized as the most merciless of our modern critics. His reputation as a disillusionizer will be greatly enhanced, in the minds of the discriminating, by the work before us. Yet, from the very nature of the case, a great many will be unable to see what the author is driving at. In his chapter on the Psychological Premises of History, he describes the mind of the average cultivated man as follows: "A stream of words and combinations pour in upon him from language, intercourse, school, news- papers, and books, and some of them remain in his memory as formulae. If he is provided with a good supply of such formulae, and can produce one on any occasion that requires it, he passes in his own estimation, and that of his fellows, as a cultivated man. But his repetition of formulae is mere psittacism, and his word knowledge has nothing to do with real knowledge." I Such a man will not find many of his favorite formulae repeated in the work before us. In the physical and experimental sciences, where the student comes into contact with objective reality, this kind of word knowledge is speedily dissipated. Unfortunately, in the moral and social sciences, and particularly in the writing of history and its interpretation, and most markedly of all in the study of law, there is no natural touchstone by which real knowledge can be separated from word knowledge. The result is that they who continue glibly repeating formulae can still pass as scholars. Such scholars will not be able to understand a man who looks through the formulae, and describes succinctly and with particularity the realities which lie behind.

What is called historical science, on the other hand, is the mere technique of historical method. It consists of a system of rules and methods for finding, sifting, and weighing the fragmentary evidences upon which the history of a given period is to be constructed. It occupies the same relation to history as microscopy to biology or telescopy to astronomy. His- torical science, thus described, is not history, tho it is a means by which we may discover the real subject matter of history. This subject matter is that interminable series of adjustments by which the human species, or some branch of it, has fitted itself into its environment. To quote Nordau himself: "History in the widest sense is the sum of the episodes of the human struggle for existence." I Concerning the old puzzle, - does man make history or does nature make history through man, - the author has little to say beyond a mild ridicule of those modern historians who affect to despise the honest old chroniclers " who faithfully devote the same space to recording dearths, earthquakes, and floods, hailstorms, unusual cold in winter or heat in summer, and the appearance of comets, that they gave to wars, coronations and the death of princes, thus assigning the same importance to events resulting from the operation of the human will and those originating in the blind chance over which man has no control. . . . The modesty of the honest old chroniclers is more consonant with the true function of the historian than the lofty confidence of those modern adepts who arrogate to themselves the decision as to what is and what is not important in the wide stream of the processes of the universe, of nature, and of human life." 2 However, if history books are written to sell or to be read, and if readers are more interested in coronations, July mas- sacres, and military campaigns than in records of tem- 1 P. 13. 2 P. 16.</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS 521 perature, earthquakes and hailstorms, obviously the historian would be unwise not to discriminate and decide what was, for his purpose, important or unimportant. Readers are undoubtedly more interested in the doings of men than in the records of the weather bureau or of the seismograph. Who ever heard of a novel without men and women in it as the chief actors ? The historian is as much subject to the interests of the reader as is the novelist. But even in the portrayal of the actions of men and women, whether by the historian or the novelist, there must be discrimination, and the writer must " arrogate to himself the decision as to what is and what is not important." Even the most pronounced realist in the realm of fiction, like the historian, " as a matter of fact, selected by subjective inclination, with reference to an end subjectively conceived, a few aspects of actuality which he then linked together as suited him and interpreted in accordance with his own idea." Thus " History, at the moment when it thinks itself most objective, is merely naturalistic fiction, merely 'history through the medium of temperament.'" The author's chapters on The Customary Philosophy of History, on The Anthropomorphic View of History, are strong and pungent, but may be criticized as attempts to slay the dead. The chapter on Man and Nature smacks of Buckle but emphasizes the Darwinian ideas of adaptation, both active and passive. That on Society and the Indi- vidual very effectually punctures the bubbles of those social psychologists who are trying to prove that society is the reality and the individual only an abstraction. That on The Question of Progress is, in some respects, the most penetrating of all. Progress, in any absolute sense, is, according to the author, logically impossible. What we call progress is, in every essential particular, like a change of fashions. Having ceased to care for the things we once cared for, and having learned to care for things which we formerly did not care for, we now proceed to get the things we now care for. When we succeed, we call it progress. Are the things we now care for better than the things we</page><page sequence="4">522 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS formerly cared for ? Of course we think so, otherwise we should not have changed our minds. But is there no real test ? To the reviewer, it seems that there is a test which will determine whether or not we are changing for the better or the worse. That is the test of survival. If the things we now care for help us in the struggle for existence and enable us to survive better than did the things we formerly cared for, then there is real prog- ress; otherwise there is not. At any rate, the world will pass more and more into the hands of those people whose desires, tastes, appetites, and activities give them greater power to resist the attacks of enemies, invisible as well as visible, greater control over the forces of nature, and greater power to multiply and to spread. This test rests upon something besides opinion, or likes and dislikes. However much we may prefer the things we are now achieving to the things which were formerly achieved, and however much we may therefore be convinced that we are progressing, if the things which we are now achieving are actually reducing our power of resistance, our power of control or conquest of the forces of nature, then we are not progressing but degenerating. The question of progress remains therefore something deeper than a mere change of fashion, or a matter of likes and dislikes. T. N. CARVER. HARVARD UNIVERSITY.</page></plain_text>
