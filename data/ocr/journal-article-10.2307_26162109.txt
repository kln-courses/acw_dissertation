<plain_text><page sequence="1">ADVOCATING SENTIENCE The Environmental Politics of Ken Kesey's Fictional Farm BENNETT HUFFMAN Concordia University The American novelist Ken Kesey, best known for One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest ( 1962/1996) and Sometimes a Great Notion ( 1964/1979), writes fiction in which food and farming figure in an animal-centered environmen tal politics. Given the unusually high incidence of animals in Kesey's works, it is surprising that so little criticism has been conducted on the subject. This is perhaps due to the fact that despite the obvious importance of animals in literature through the ages, literary representation of animal sentience has only recently emerged as a topic of critical interest. Throughout his own life, Kesey's writings have often focused on nature. Kesey's environmental politics have evolved throughout his 40 year-long literary career from early novels that use animals and nature as the subject and setting for human plots to more contemplative writing that more directly focuses on the lives of animals. His novels and New Journalism illustrate the rela tionship between contemporary farm-centered politics and aesthetic development. Through the use of animals in his human-centered novels, Kesey makes an argu ment for the importance of animals in general and of farming specifically. Though animals and farming play parts in Kesey's juvenilia, it is in his first pub lished novel, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, that they appear with a powerful significance. The novel relates the story of inmates trapped in an Oregon mental hospital by a larger society that is seen as hostile to individualism. In a heroic para digm, Randal McMurphy joins the ward in order to illustrate ways in which the other inmates can shake free of the stultifying effects of what the novel's Native American narrator calls the Combine, a metaphor for American society in the Cold War. In the novel, McMurphy, played by Jack Nicholson in the 1975 Oscar-winning film by Milos Forman, is transferred from the Pendleton Work Farm, a minimum security correctional facility in the State of Oregon, to the mental hospital (p. 12). Ironically, Kesey, an advocate of the drug culture made famous by Tom Wolfe's book-length treatment of his activities in the 1960s, The Electric Kool-Acid Acid Test, was himself sentenced to and served 6 months at the San Mateo County Sher iff's Honor Farm for possession of marijuana in 1967,5 years after placing his first fictional hero in such an institution. Throughout Cuckoo's Nest, animals are offered as metaphors for human actions and problems. The initial metaphor used for the leader of the inmates in the mental hospital upon McMurphy's arrival is "Bull goose loony" (pp. 12-24). The metaphor used to describe the inmates as victims of the system rather than challengers of it is chickens at first (pp. 55-58) and later rabbits (pp. 62-63). By the end of the first Organization &amp; Environment, Vol. 15 No. 1, March 2002 79-87 © 2002 Sage Publications 79</page><page sequence="2">80 ORGANIZATION &amp; ENVIRONMENT / March 2002 chapter, McMurphy actually refers to his fellow inmates as "birds" (p. 72). Chief Bromden, the novel's narrator, uses the metaphor of a hunted bird in his initial con flict with the system in which he lives (pp. 6-7). In the scene, Bromden hides from the ward orderlies in a closet and evokes the memory of the hunted bird as displace ment behavior from his own anxiety by representing the avian point of view. Though the bird knows it should keep still for self-preservation's sake, it, and Bromden, cannot overcome its fear and bolts from the hiding place. Later in the chapter a duck blind represents both a bucolic ideal and a sexual realm (p. 37). Here Bromden evokes the bird-hunting context out of excitement at meeting a woman rather than fear of being pursued by the Combine. All of these animal metaphors are developed as subjective explanations either from the narrator's mind and worldview or from the dialogue going on around him; animals are imaginary exam ples used to explain his own rather than the situation of the animals themselves. In one particular instance, the extension of an animal metaphor over a number of pages acts to give the animal itself a more objective reality and plotline of its own while it continues to act as a human metaphor for the narrator himself. McMurphy's presence on the ward has begun to make Bromden see things differently. One night he gets up from bed, because of McMurphy's agitating quality, and rather than fix his attention on things inside the ward, Bromden goes to the window and looks out, unknowingly, toward his eventual liberty. There, in "a long spider of shadow," he witnesses a young dog searching "digger squirrel holes" (p. 155). The description goes on for three full pages. The dog is, naturally enough, symbolic of Bromden's own searching at this point in the plot. The dog's intention, according to Bromden, is not to go digging for the squirrels but simply to "get an idea of what they were up to," much as Bromden is making a simple assessment of his surroundings (p. 155). The longer the narration goes on, the less merely symbolic it becomes in a humanly subjective way and the more the dog becomes of character in its own right. Bromden and the dog merge in a joint observation of Canada geese in flight, allow ing the dog to gain, perhaps contrary to expectations, a subject status of its own. When the "Canada honkers" fly into view, the hunting instincts that human and canine possess equally, man and dog experience a union and equalization by freez ing together: "For an instant that lead goose was right at the center of that circle [the moon], bigger than the others, a black cross opening and closing, then he pulled his V out of sight into the sky once more" (p. 156). This lead goose can be interpreted as symbolizing McMurphy as a leader of the men on his ward because Bromden has been affected by his presence on the ward. The last we see of the dog, once the departure of the geese sets him back into action, he is on an unresolved collision course with a speeding vehicle on the highway. The frequency with which Kesey uses animal metaphors in the novel drops off suddenly after this scene. Bromden compares McMurphy to a dog similar to the one with whom he watches the geese in the night. This dog 'worries' at the holes he sniffs into rather than simply noting the smells within them. Silently, Bromden warns this McMurphy dog, thinking, "Dog, that hole is none of your affair—it's too big and too black and there's spoor all over the place says bears or something just as bad" (p. 186). In Kesey's subsequent novel, animals perform a narrative structuring role in addition to achieving subjective importance within the narrative. In Sometimes a Great Notion, which is twice as long as Cuckoo's Nest, Kesey relies more extensively on animal metaphors, thus giving the animals the opportu nity to rise above human objectification to the status of subjects in their own stories. Any given page of the 600-plus-page novel, which tells the tale of family and union logging interests at odds in Oregon forestry, is more likely to have mention of an</page><page sequence="3">Huffman / ADVOCATING SENTIENCE 81 animal than not. One of the central conflicts in the novel is a sibling rivalry between two brothers, Hank and Lee Stamper. Hank and Lee work together to save the fam ily business while at the same time Lee attempts a seduction of Hank's wife, Viv, in retaliation for childhood tortures at the hands of Hank. So, the battlefield for these brothers' conflict is both the natural world (the forest in which they work) and the feminine (embodied by Viv). Some of the animals mentioned are named pets and others are anonymous animals encountered in the wild. Some of these animals (Molly the Dog, Omar the Squirrel, and a wild goose and geese in general) are developed as extended metaphors for humanity, and thus, their demise or their sal vation through human action provides a moral for the human plot, as well as that of the Earth or Nature as a whole. Kesey uses this innovative centrality of animals in his human-centered novels to highlight not only what is at stake in the human world but the importance of Man's connection to the natural world as well. Of the 22 characters in the novel whose thoughts the narration gives the reader access to, one, significantly is Molly the Dog, particularly in chapter 5. We gain access to her thoughts as she is watching the moon, just like the dog we met in Cuckoo's Nest. The scene in which she watches the moon is the night of a fox hunt. She discovers a bear on her own and pursues it as far as she can. Every few pages of the chapter, as we follow the human plot, we get a glimpse of Molly in this action under the moon. This moment of moon gazing actually takes place at the end of the human plot developing through the chapter, a month after the section's initial action. Molly thus acts as the frame for all human action within the chapter. Like the worried dog in Cuckoo 's Nest, Molly pursues the bear discovered during the fox hunt beyond her limitations and becomes injured when she is bitten by a poisonous snake. It is her struggle to return home with poison coursing through her veins on which we focus, rather than the movements of the human beings. Molly's story is spread across 74 pages, which, combined with the access we have to her thoughts, makes it the single most objective rendering of animal experience in the novel. Each chapter of Notion is written in what Kesey refers to as a thematic key, like Light and Time. The lessons Hank forges from the examples animals provide him in Impermanence and Adjustment make him see life as cheap, especially animal lives. So the stories of Molly, the bobcat kittens, and Omar the Squirrel set up Hank's character as uncaring toward the animals around him. He is a hunter with no sense of remorse for the lives of animals he takes in the hunt. This characteristic repre sents the basic conflict in Hank's relations with the world at large. Through his shifting relationship to geese, and one anonymous goose in particular, Hank signifi cantly resolves, symbolically at any rate, his human conflicts. As Molly frames the fifth chapter of the novel, geese act as a frame for the ninth chapter. The arrival of a large flock of Canada geese, mightier than "the coast had seen in centuries," heralds the arrival of winter, a significant shift in season toward the end of a novel set in autumn (p. 397). The chapter begins with all characters individually acknowledg ing the geese's arrival, ending with Hank. Hank and Joe Ben become obsessed with the idea of killing one of the many geese roaming the area during the days that fol low their initial arrival. Kesey goes so far in portraying this obsession that he devotes an entire page of Hank's internal monologue to a catalog of the feelings gained from shooting every different species of waterfowl available, ending with the Canada goose. And after this catalog, Hank mentions a longing to shoot a goose as part of the description of each day as the chapter progresses. But when Hank and Joe Ben finally get their chance and Joe Ben has a clear shot, Hank, at the outboard motor of the boat, purposefully swerves the boat, telling Joe Ben to "forget it." Hank's interpretation of the goose's call brings about this change of heart. Through</page><page sequence="4">82 ORGANIZATION &amp; ENVIRONMENT / March 2002 Hank's evolving character, Kesey indicates a philosophical development that includes animals objectively on a level equal to that of humans. After Notion, Kesey moves to a metafictional form of essay in which animals continue to play an important role. Kesey's fictional alter ego, a farmer by the name of Devlin Deboree (supposedly pronounced "debris" and often given the honorific of "Old Man"), appeared in print for the first time in the opinion pieces Kesey wrote for the Last Supplement to the Whole Earth Catalog in 1971. Kesey had been asked to coedit the Last Supplement by Whole Earth mastermind Stewart Brand. In the section of the Last Supplement called "I Ching" in which Deboree first appears, Kesey narrates his story in the first person. It thus remains unclear in this first incar nation of Deboree just how close to Kesey's own character he is. Subsequent incar nations of Deboree appear in stories Kesey tells from the point of view of a first person narrator solely from Deboree's point of view or of an omniscient narrator relating the Old Man's tale. The importance of the first Deboree story rests primarily in Kesey's establish ment of him as an icon of the definitive American farmer. Because the reader is given so little detail about the man's life initially, his identification as a farmer and the concern he expresses in his anxiety about the coming rain that will ruin his newly plowed fields is paramount. The importance of animals in Deboree's world expresses itself most particularly in this sentence: He works his land alone, except for, of course, his dogs, and cows, and horses and chickens and the clouds that drop by, and for the huge catfish that lives in the bath tub where the other animals water at the pump. (p. 176) Looked at closely, this sentence illustrates the unique interpersonal relationships on Kesey's literary farm. Humans may be given a privileged position on this farm ini tially with "He works his land alone"—his solitary activity and responsibility is emphasized with the possessive pronoun indicating ownership in a capitalist cul ture—but the exception, and Kesey's casting of it as a natural condition with the phrase "of course," gives other figures a shared responsibility in the act of farming. Among the figures who share in this work are, first, and perhaps most importantly for Deboree at this stage, his dogs. Though working dogs are a familiar figure in farming, it remains unstated exactly what kind of work Deboree's dogs perform in collaboration with him. Separated by commas are the second group of helpers on the farm—cows. The dogs are cast in the same possessive relation to Deboree as the land he owns, but the cows remain more independent in the absence of the posses sive pronoun. Yet still in the list of helpers, the cows work the land as do the dogs and Deboree. With these three figures we have a triangular relationship expressed in which the work is the holistic activity of living. Later it becomes clear that the farm's cows are cattle raised for food and not dairy cattle like those of Kesey's real-life brother who are husbanded for their pro duce but not for their lives. Continuing to analyze the whole picture of Deboree's farm we have connected "horses and chickens and the clouds that drop by" through the omission of commas. This phrase creates a second triangle of figures contribut ing to the farm. It could be argued that the use of the possessive pronoun before the word dogs can be linguistically attached, through elision, to the figures that follow them in the list. If this is the case, then the article the preceding clouds separates them from the figures that Deboree possesses. The most obvious function of clouds on a farm is in watering the crops, hay in Deboree's case, which is interesting here</page><page sequence="5">Huffman / ADVOCATING SENTIENCE 83 because the tension of the story as a whole rests in the farmer's anxiety about the rain being detrimental to the crop rather than beneficial. The last figure in the list is the pet catfish in an outdoor bathtub. The catfish, rep resenting an Oriental wisdom, speaks to itself and to Deboree. Here the reiteration of the word for in introducing the catfish distinguishes its importance in helping Deboree with the farm from all the other animals in the list. In a sense, this creates yet another triangular relationship in which Deboree, the animals, and the catfish all have equal standing in the working of the farm—Deboree directing the animals in the physical workings of the farm and the catfish remaining responsible for the metaphysical or philosophical aspects of farming. These complex structures all point toward Deboree's developing the farm as a realm appropriate for philosophy and politics. When Deboree is on the verge of cursing at the weather for threatening his fields, the catfish says, "You don't need a hint, Devlin old boy, you need an oracle!" (p. 177). The catfish's contribution to the working of the farm illustrates Kesey's concept of the farm as a philosophical zone where the work being done is not always necessarily the raising of a product, though it is that as well. Throughout Kesey's adult life he has vacillated a number of times between writ ing socially conscious fictions promoting a broad liberal philosophy and engaging in real-life dramatic and direct political action of a whimsical kind. In 1972, Kesey made a public speaking tour in which he encouraged people to get involved in a "think globally, act locally" campaign, though he did not use that now-familiar phrase. According to a San Francisco Chronicle reporter (Hallgren, 1972) in a speech at a central California Unitarian church before an audience of 700, Kesey described the necessary social action thus: "But politics, as he [Kesey] sees it, is the politics of actually getting it all together—getting your head and your heart and the outer world—and of finally taking the personal responsibility to assume control of America's destiny." Later in the same article the author wrote of Kesey, "The local people know their local problems ... he urged those in the audience—that very night—to elect chairpersons, nominate candidates, collect contributions, decide their issues, and name their parties," Another journalist (Berman, 1972) from the same speech wrote that Kesey said, "Where do they get their juries? We've got to start doing things like that [sitting on juries], and it starts by registering to vote." With his move to New Journalism, Kesey began writing about his farm in Ore gon on which animals, naturally, play a very important role. In Deboree's subse quent incarnations, collected in the book Demon Box (1986), the farm becomes an ideological location with a "farm soothing influence." In a very short piece called "Joon the Goon was What", Deboree draws a class distinction between people who call their properties farms and those with more money who call them ranches. A farm, for Kesey, is an impoverished attempt by a property's inhabitants to eke out an existence from the land; a ranch is a playground for people wealthy enough not to have to glean any actual capital from their property. Later, in "Abdul and Ebenezer" (1976), Deboree describes his friend Olaf thus: "Like most of my farming neigh bors he has to hold down a job to support his right to labor on his own land" (p. 40). In the mail, Deboree receives a book called Love of Place by a "famous holy man I've never heard of' (p. 9). Deboree's response to the title alone is this: "You can't learn love of place from those above or below you, it don't seem to me ..." (p. 9). The sentence ends in ellipses, indicating the unstated area from whence one can learn love of place. The sentence emphasizes social hierarchy again as does the farm/ranch distinction. The subtext of the sentence gestures toward a middle</page><page sequence="6">84 ORGANIZATION &amp; ENVIRONMENT / March 2002 ground between above and below, the place where one resides, the Self is the only true teacher of love of place, and the rest of Deboree's tales exemplify ways in which the protagonist can come to love his or her place and learn lessons from it. The next piece in Demon Box is narrated by Deboree's youngest son, Quiston. It describes a typical day on the hippy farm, shooting film of people doing farm chores such as moving the horses from the main pasture in preparation for the sea son's hay growth. While others are doing these chores, Joon the Goon, who is not in tune with the bucolic workings of the farm, watches along with Abdul the Bull. Deboree and his best friend Dobbs narrate what Joon and Abdul are thinking. In Deboree's fantasy narration, Joon says that the farming is actually, "cruel, carnivo rous barbarism!" (p. 12). Dobbs, in the role of Abdul, responds, "I know what you mean... but it's the only free accommodations available, here in carnivore country" (p. 12). Deboree and Dobbs are making fun of the inconsistencies of the liberal phi losophy underlying a certain strand of vegetarianism, which the impoverished can not afford. Deboree laughs after the exchange, and Quiston comments to the reader that "People on food trips are funny to him (Deboree)" (p. 12). In this story, how ever, wild animals are the central focus, not farm animals. A complex conception of balance is a common motif of environmental fiction. In Kesey's story, a sick fawn has been attended to by the people living there. Hub, a farm guest working as a logger, brought the orphaned fawn back from the woods where he works. The fawn dies, for no known reason, disrupting the farm's activi ties. This movement from woods to farm seems out of balance until the following day. Here, a bull gopher is found swimming in the farm's pond and Hub agrees to take it to the logging show to release it where the fawn had been found—an expres sion of balance. The story "Abdul and Ebenezer" describes the unique relationship of Deboree, the new farmer, with the cattle he raises for food by chronicling the lives of a num ber of bovine inhabitants of his farm over a period of years. For instance, at the beginning of the story Deboree, acting as first-person narrator, describes the dry ice and methyl alcohol technique of branding cattle; frozen metal on shaved hide instead of hot iron (p. 38). Like many things in Kesey's philosophical farm, the methods of farming are nontraditional or downright experimental, with the goal of caring for the animals raised for food more humanely than tradition dictates. Deboree describes Ebenezer the cow as the person who speaks for the group and movement leader of all the animals on the farm. Whenever a conflict arises between human managers and animal tenants, Ebenezer leads the charge of "grievances through the fence to protest pasture conditions" (p. 39). The language here comes from labor negotiations and casts them in the role of human workers while the humans fulfill a managerial role while the animals that of the proletariat; humans direct the physical workings that the animals carry out. As with Major the boar in George Orwell's Animal Farm (1945/1997), which Kesey acknowledges as an influence later in life, Ebenezer's actions are described in terms of barricade bust ing and protest marches (p. 39). Always the farmer, Deboree describes his work as a collaboration with the animal inhabitants of the farm characterized by compromise. For instance, in regards to fencing in the cattle, Deboree parenthetically remarks, "any of our fencing during those first years was at best a tacit agreement with the half-ton tenants" (p. 39). Bad weather is a shared nuisance to both species: "Every citizen was depressed, the beasts as bad as the folks" (p. 44). In another remark, Deboree describes Ebenezer's actions in terms of "a border dispute" (p. 39). By developing so many metaphors of a particular type, Kesey describes the relation ship between farmer and animal as far more than simple anthropomorphism.</page><page sequence="7">Huffman / ADVOCATING SENTIENCE 85 Ebenezer is not the only animal to be cast in political terms; a bull by the humor ous name of Hamburger comes to resent being fenced in, and thus, the central orga nizing principle of the bull's character is politicized: "There was no denying it: what had once been just hard and horny was now a look burning with the first coals of hate for the human oppressor" (p. 40). When Hamburger is finally turned into meat, the humane (a word used very uneasily in this context) procedure for slaughter is arrived at through a consensus of butcher, farmer, and farm animal: "As far as John and I and the cows are concerned, this is what kosher was originally supposed to be about" (p. 42). At the climax of the story, the other animal for which the story is titled, Abdul the Bull, is finally slaughtered and butchered. Deboree describes the responsiveness of other farm animals to the death of a compatriot: They (the other cows in the yard) don't follow the carcass; they stay to circle the spot where the actual death occurred, keening around the taking-off place though the hoisted husk is in full view mere yards away. As time passes, this circle spreads larger. If one were to hang overhead in a balloon and take hourly photos of this out line of mourning, I believe it would describe the diffusing energy field of the dead animal.... Off and on between grazing, the herd returned to the dented pipe and stood in a lowing circle that was a tight ten feet in diameter the first day, and the next day fifteen feet, and the next day twenty. For a full week they grieved.... it was only right that the funeral last until a great circle had been observed, only natu ral—with the proper period of respect fading naturally toward forgetting while Nature shuffles her deck for the next deal around, (pp. 51-52) "Keening around the taking-off place" is interestingly sentient in description. Keen is an Irish word for wailing for the dead, a particularly specific cultural practice for purposefully mourning lost life. "Taking-off' seems to imply a sentient soul depart ing for an almost heavenly afterlife. By referring to souls as an "energy field," the cattle are represented as having a sensitivity for the presence of the soul more highly developed than that of humans ; cattle see the presence of the ebbing soul deteriorate where humans see nothing but the carcass. The words mourning and funeral both present the cows' actions in sentient terms. Finally, for the last sentence in the extract, the three uses of nature (natural, naturally, and Nature with a capital N) seal the description with a particularly ecological sensibility. The story "The Day After Superman Died" (1979/1980), a eulogy for Neal Cassady, also uses the farm as a unique field of discourse for philosophical issues. In the story Kesey both honors his Beat-generation hero and critiques the philo sophical weaknesses in the counterculture that grew from his actions. The begin ning of the story introduces unexplained images (a ditch in the back forty, a pea cock) that become significant later on. After their initial introduction, the narrator luxuriates over each element of the story, visiting and revisiting his own images. The peacock, for instance, acts as a barometer of tension for the humans in the nar rative: Deboree listens for its scream to be a release of the potential energy building on the farm. When the peacock crows in this story, Deboree is forced into a physical confron tation with an older hippie over a stick that the dog Stewart has been fetching. Deboree would like the older hippie to stop playing fetch with Stewart, a game Deboree is trying to stop him from playing. Stewart, like many farm dogs with too few duties to perform, has become addicted to chasing sticks, and thus become a pest with begging to play. At first this sounds petty, but for the narrator the stick is a symbol of the respect for property ownership and for the rules of conduct and</page><page sequence="8">86 ORGANIZATION &amp; ENVIRONMENT / March 2002 mutual regard for all the people who live in a settled place, the farm, including the animals. Critic Stephen Tanner (1983) expresses Kesey's point of view here thus: "His perspective from a farm in Oregon, devoting himself to his family and to estab lishing a responsible relationship with his environment and community, makes the carelessness, irresponsibility, and self-deception of the movement more glaringly apparent" (p. 129). Hippydom, however, is not replaced by conservative values wholesale, but rather individualism is turned into a responsible communalism—all beings have worth and so command respect, not all can freeload because nothing seems to matter. This accurate portrayal of Kesey's perspective illustrates the per sonal and social forces pulling against one another in Deboree's character. Farming is not entirely idealized in Kesey's later work, either. Although Devlin Deboree's spread is preserved for the positive animal-centered farm honoring sen tience, Kesey's novel Sailor Song (1992) uses science fiction to examine the poten tial for ecological collapse in the near future. This novel tells the story of Holly wood's attempt to turn a small Alaskan village into a theme park after shooting a film at its location. The hints at ecological destruction occurring in the 20th century are subtle: "The moon? Mars? The Fractal Farm? No game, sorry. The planet Earth is the ball we were pitched—it's the ball we have to play" (p. 43). Sailor Song hints at its ecologically minded motto early on. Ike Sallas, the novel's hero, is confronted with a writhing monster of sorts on his front lawn: The Thing itself, here at last, both hell-whelped and man-made, right in front of him... [sic] the unnatural spawn of meddling as Claude Rains had meddled in that horror classic The Invisible Man "With Things Man Was Meant to Leave Alone." (p. 4) The description is that of a cat with its head stuck in a mayonnaise jar: a humorous domestic metaphor told in gothic terms of importance to nature. Here, the animal world, the cat, has come into serious conflict with the waste of the human/techno logical world in the form of a discarded jar. As humorous as that may seem, and the novel is filled with humor, the metaphor stands for more serious human meddling, which is woven throughout the book. Ike Sallas, the novel's hero, is a fisherman from the outset, but a fisherman with a past. He is also a pilot with a varied and illustrious career. His first flying experience comes from his work for the CIA spraying a chemical over cocaine and marijuana fields in Central and South America in order to render the drug-producing plants extinct (p. 121). "Genetic spray flights were already introducing the unisex recombinants by then, setting off a botanical chain reaction that was so successful it rendered all dangerous vegetables fruitless within a few years" (p. 457). After mili tary service Sallas works as a crop duster in corporate farming territory of Califor nia's San Joaquin Valley. It is during this period that his daughter is "born a spina bifida baby, with enlarged cranium and a section of her lower backbone exposed" (pp. 127-128). When the baby is hospitalized, Sallas begins to make a connection between his CIA work and his child's deformity, though his child's condition could just as easily have come from the chemicals he sprayed over the crops of California: "Ike was fretting if the defect might not have come from him (all those runs over the coke slopes in Ecuador, for example? spraying those botanical recombinants?)" (p. 128). And when the baby dies he continues with the same thinking: "It works— infinitesimal alterations at the genetic level. And why not? It makes sense.... Of course, there was always the possibility that if you mess around with it long enough you might get some of it on you" (p. 129). The tangle of the individual (Sallas) with</page><page sequence="9">Huffman / ADVOCATING SENTIENCE 87 the social (drug war, corporate farming) represents human interference with the entire ecosphere. The suggestion here is that Sallas is the one infected by the pesti cides from his drug-war work, but it is his daughter who bears the consequences: a more pernicious, less traceable, less comfortable outcome. Kesey has said most recently that he "wants to write an autobiography told through the voices of animals" (Barnard, 1999). Kesey (personal interview, August 24,1998) believes you can "tell universal truths through the eyes of animals that you could never tell from a human point of view." Whether writing about the animal-centered farm in Oregon or corporate pollution of the future, Kesey's writ ing is always political and usually environmental. There is no reason to believe that with the way things are progressing Kesey and writers like him will not continue to use food and farming as a cautionary focus for positive social change. Kesey's sci ence fiction novel predicted the use of terrorism as a means of expressing political disenfranchisement in the environmental realm. His representation of animal sen tience illustrates a trajectory of development from simple metaphoric placement within human-centered novels to stories in which animals take over the plots in order to show the importance of animals in the world for their own sake, as well as that of their relationship to human beings.
