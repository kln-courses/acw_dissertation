<plain_text><page sequence="1">Samuel Beckett's Fin de Partie: Variations on the Hermeneutic Theme Sylvie Debevec Henning I am not a philosopher; I do not understand philosophers and their linguistic habits. Samuel Beckett What is needed in the present world crisis is less philosophy, but more attentiveness to thinking. Martin Heidegger, "Letter on Humanism" Murphy could still savor the repose of his mental mercyseat, hoping eventually to attain, by either positive or negative means, to the truth and plenitude of the "One." Hamm and Clov, however, appear too aware of the failure of Murphy's quest to retain any illusions about their ability ever to reach such a meaning-ful telos. Indeed, they have cast into doubt the criterion of meaning itself, at least in any absolute sense. Nevertheless, even after the destruction of their faith in eschatological hermeneutics, their will to signification remains. If, previously, man had been acting out his own earthly roles, believing them to be integral parts of a play written by the divine Author, Hamm and Clov can now only continue commenting on their own interpretations, painfully aware of their all-too-human nature. If, by a subsequent process of displacement, 371</page><page sequence="2">man had confidently proclaimed a humanist faith in himself as the ultimate source of meaning and value, they, the last men, can only struggle vainly against the implications, both natural and cultural, reaching after factors that repeatedly escape their anxious grasp. The problem, then, is no longer the meaning and attainment of metaphysical unity, as in Beckett's first novel.' Fin de Partie broaches instead the question, how to interpret after the criterion of unity has become questionable. Sometimes it is as if the characters would like to believe that the aesthetic dimension of their actions is enough. Or that they need merely be divertissants. Ultimately, however, the characters take seriously only those interpretations that promise to bring an end, by putting all the pieces together into an essential whole, with the rational interpreting subject as its center. But is this not once again Murphy's monistic quest, replayed self-consciously on the level of humanist hermeneutics? At the same time, the reader/spectator's effort to understand Fin de Partie repeats and varies Celia's effort to understand Murphy. Since it was first produced in London in 1957, this play has received far more critical attention than Murphy (though less than Godot). This is certainly due at least in part to the vogue for the "heroic" humanism of various, quasi-philosophical trends of the day. For Fin de Partie has often been read as an illustration of certain extremely popular themes, particularly the "absurdity" of the cosmos and the "meaninglessness" of human existence within it. This approach has unfortunately over- shadowed other possibilities. Two critics who have reacted strongly to the existentialist view, but from seemingly divergent perspectives, are Stanley Cavell and Theodor Adorno.2 Rather than presenting Fin de Partie as merely symptomatic of "modern ontology," both see the play responding critically to this particular avatar of Western metaphysics. Indeed, it might be said that both Cavell and Adorno see the entire (or almost entire) philosophical tradition as implicated in the play's eternally frustrated search for ultimate meaning. Thus Cavell and Adorno both point to the possibility of interpreting Fin de Partie as a philosophical satire. Both, however, see its critique of the rationalist tradition as simply negative or even nihilistic. Each, then, may in the end be doing more to confirm, than to contest, the dominant, humanist interpretation. Diverging from this view, I should like to argue that, by casting the satire in a specifically Menippean or carnivalized "form," Beckett does suggest an alternative to the paralyzing despair so often detected at the heart of the modern situation. For Mikhail Bakhtin, the Menippean, or carnivalizing, satire engages the reader or spectator in the worldly adventures of an "idea." The various episodes are not meant as positive illustrations, so much as they constitute scenarios in which the "idea" can be provoked and tested. They may be seen as actively investigating the problems in- herent in the way an idea manifests itself in the work of particular thinkers. "I am interested," says Beckett, "in the shape of ideas, even if I do not believe in them .... It is the shape that matters." The Menippean situation challenges the "truth" of a philosophical princi- ple by embodying it in a seeker who uses it to order his or her life.3 372</page><page sequence="3">Historically, the carnivalesque has always coexisted alongside our sober rationalist tradition. It has, however, been increasingly repressed. Thus, the prevailing hermeneutic perspectives--philo- sophical, religious, moral, scientific-have been seen, by Bakhtin and others, as in large part founded upon the attempt to eliminate all that challenges the totalizing (and not infrequently totalitarian) presumptions of our cultural heritage-an attempt, in other words, to clean up what Beckett calls "the mess" that "invades our experience at every mo- ment."4 Today, Beckett adds, the task of creative thinking is "to find a form that accommodates the mess," rather than attempting simply to eliminate it through an excess of rational order. The carnivalized satire provides a possible solution to the artist's dilemma. For carnivalization may be seen as a playing-out of "messy" relations in such a way that the anxiety they engender is engaged in a positive way through an affir- mation of their inherent place within the relative structures of temporal existence. It involves, that is, a confrontation between contending forces: those that strive for a full, harmonious unification, and those that contest this desire.5 In Fin de Partie, as perhaps in all of Beckett's works, the text "itself" reproduces the contests on several levels. Hamm and Clov work to repress the indeterminacy of their "messy" condition on the narrative level. Yet it keeps returning to increase their anguish. At the same time, they strive to eradicate the affirmative aspects of the carnivalesque- the body, nature, time, history, laughter-whenever they manifest themselves. A similar act of double repression is repeated on the level of style, where the apparent imposition of univocal order is countered by the disseminating nature of language that it has striven to exclude. On all levels, the carnivalesque both counteracts the totalitarian and interacts with it in an agon that contributes to the tension of the play. And indeed, Fin de Partie is largely a comment upon these repeated confrontations that have occurred throughout the course of Western history. By the very act of testing and contesting teleological hermeneutics, moreover, the play may, in the uncertainty of its own nature, be demonstrating and providing, not simply critique, but an alter- native as well. Let us suppose, then, that Fin de Partie takes place within the mind, not that of an individual subject, like Murphy, but that of Western culture itself, centered as it is upon the human subject. Here, on a mental stage, the cultural mind will replay its various interpretations of life and world. What had been for Murphy a moment of "Belacquan bliss" upon the threshold of Purgatory has become for Hamm and Clov a dark night of longing at the gates of a paradise lost. As often in the medieval theater, the opening tableau is a con- crete representation of the end of days. The exit from the prison cell--of life, of mind, of language-is through the door stage-right. The characters who are living there huis clos remain nonetheless within sight of the door. Their being-there is lived towards a passage that they hope will lead to a better situation, or at least to a different one. They hope to transform their inevitable finitude from a "simple" closure into 373</page><page sequence="4">a meaningful end.6 Next to the door, however, is a "tableau retourn ," a traditional sign of mourning. But whose picture is it beside the door- the all-seeing deity of Film, the Old Boy of Murphy? Perhaps the human mind is in mourning after the death of that Being who created and gave meaning to the door, indeed, who was the Door. The condition of Hamm and Clov might then be compared to what Pascal described as the "misery of man without God." Man can be satisfied with nothing less than the infinite and absolutely stable, and so can find no real satis- faction at all. The characters' attempts to forestall the inevitable may then be prompted by the fear that there might in fact be no fully meaningful end. The complexity of their perception of this improbable way-out will contribute to the passion of their play. But the door could also be a way in: into a new earthly paradise (or is it only a new Hell?). With the disappearance of the deity, man is left to his own devices. He must find another authority to give his life direction and to fulfill his Pascalian "capacity for God," be it a tran- scendental Ego, Geist, Will, Natural Law, or science. These substitute centers are produced by thought, which, by itself, Pascal too considered man's greatest attribute. Thus, when man begins to search for a concept or idea to replace the divine Mens, it is really not surprising that he should find, sooner or later, himself. The new heaven becomes what it was already for Murphy: the human mind itself.7 At the left of this tympanum is the counterpart of the door, the other way out (or in) via the garbage can. The two dustbins, like two funerary urns, are also signs of mourning, not, of course, for the heavenly Father, but for Hamm's own grotesquely earthbound parents. Like his (and man's) Biblical ancestors, they are associated with the physical body. Man comes into life and departs from it as what Murphy called a "waste product" of the organic processes: ashes to ashes, dust to dust. They may also be associated with the social body, with all its "organs": marriage, family, religion, state. Finally, they evoke the historical body, including both the biological and cultural heritage. In the West, as well as in the East, the body has most often been con- sidered earthly detritus that corrupts the spirit and shackles its freedom (e.g., in Platonism, Christianity, and Sartrean existential humanism). At best it is perceived, together with the socio-cultural dimension, as mere means to a higher end: e.g., in Hegelianism or Marxism as the tools of Geist or Proletarian Man in a dialectical march towards self- realization. In positivism it functions as the raw material of scientific law. And when, in the nineteenth century, even this instrumental value is cast into doubt, organic life becomes, as it was for at least some very prominent forms of religion, mere garbage. By either assimilation or elimination, then, nature is to be mastered, and its most "earth- bound" parts rejected. Between the two extremes is Hamm, seated, like Faust, in his chair on castors, in a pose that both repeats and varies that of Murphy, Mr. Kelly, Molloy, Moran, the Unnameable, et al. Hamm as homme, homme as &amp;me. Blind to the sensory world, his body immobilized, Hamm is man reduced, in metaphysical terms, to this most essential feature: mind or soul. At the center of this theatrum mundi, he occupies 374</page><page sequence="5">the place of authority, with the power of the man-God on his mercyseat, to separate the damned from the saved. This center, however, is not simple but double. Beside Hamm stands Clov, his alter ego. Clov reminds us that homme is by very nature dual, both matter and spirit. Hamm and Clov together, then, might be said to represent man, the former as mind, the latter as body. Yet to be Clov(e) is already to be two, and not simply two, but simultaneously simple and dual. Clov, even as man's material nature, would not, from within the Christian or Classical framework, be totally devoid of spiritual qualities himself. Although it considers matter inferior, or even hostile, to spirit, matter itself is still seen as part of the divine creation. Traditional metaphysics does, all the same, effectively bind one leg of the Clov(e). That which is cloven, having been reduced to the instinctual, may thus represent all that is "sinful" in man. Or his more material functions may be so tightly governed by "natural" reason and law that he is progressively crippled. In the idealist tradition (and some consider all of Western philosophy essentially idealist), the material leg is all but amputated, leaving only spirit to represent nature as a whole, at least in its "essence." To deprive the Clov(e) of its most corporeal member, then, is in a sense to destroy it. Not only is Clov cloven, he is also "in" Hamm (as Hamm is "in" him). Hamm himself is a form of Clov, albeit a more repressed and therefore enfeebled one. Homme may be ame, but he is also flesh: ham. And the soul (anima), as mediator between pure spirit and pure matter, is also double, in that, as mens, it participates in the divine intellect, while as animus, it experiences the sensory world. The problematic nature of hommeI/me/Hamm (namely, his cloven state), however, is precisely one of the thorns in the side of the Christian-Classical inter- pretation of man. Thus, beside Hamm stands his devilish supplement: too material to be totally assimilated, yet too spiritual to be completely eliminated. That which is cloven, then, like all that is truly undecidable, cannot be placed squarely on one side or another of a cleft, but par- takes variably in both legs of the opposition. It stands astride it. Its situation is therefore liminal and agonistic with regard to what might be called the "home" oppositions: e.g.' matter/spirit, body/mind, object/subject, nature/culture, other/self. Moreover, that which is cloven both strives towards unification and resists that striving, both cleaving to and cleaving asunder. In this way, the cloven engages the problem or process of what Derrida calls diff6rance. It is subject not to ultimate solutions but to modified repetitions. It points, then, to the interaction of repression and displacement.8 It is Clov, this supplementary element, who sets the play in motion. Indeed, the excrescence on the side of the "One" that exceeds and overflows its limits is posited by Plotinus as the origin of the world itself. This overflowing is also an expulsion, a casting out of that which cannot (or can no longer) be contained within the whole. It is a form of cleaving, and thus an act by Clov. Clov sets the play in motion by breaking off from Hamm and setting off on his own eccentric path. Yet to cleave in this way is to obscure or even to destroy the nature of the 375</page><page sequence="6">cleft; indeed, the "end" of Clov's actions appears to be the expulsion of the cloven. He is the agent, in some sense, of his own eventual repression. In the beginning of the play, there is not the word, but, following Faust, the deed. Or rather, the act-for Clov's moves are part of a routine, even a conventional comic routine. In the beginning, then, there is already both r6p6tition and, in a sense, the act of interpr6tation. And here it is also an act of repression. The "beginning" of the human world, of civilization and culture, is marked by an effort to control the originary indeterminacy of (man's) nature. It is even the nature of/in man that is repressed. Clov's subsequent actions will only repeat and intensify this attempt to cleave asunder. His act leads up to the uncovering of Hamm. Homme, after the deed of repression that establishes and maintains the dominant intel- lectual tradition (i.e., the separation of mind from matter)9 is reductively reconstituted as dme. Physically, he is blind, paralyzed, moribund. On his way out the door, Clov can therefore stop to announce that the repression is now finished. To be fini-perfect and closed- is to be &amp;me without the body, homme without his cloven nature. It is fitting, then, that Clov, as he leaves, should repeat "Christ's Parthian shaft." The first spoken word of the play is also "fini," and it indicates finality, in the sense both of finite and finished, thus pointing to the problem of teleology right from the start. Teleology might in fact be described as the most obvious issue addressed by Fin de Partie. What exactly is implied in the statement, "It is finished"? Among other things, that one has, as Hegel pointed out, placed oneself by means of one hyperbolic gesture or another, beyond finality and, paradoxically, become able to look back upon it.10 It is consequently an act that, by exceeding its own goal, renders questionable its very status as a goal. Even the grammatical structure of Clov's statement, moreover (i.e., subject, copula, predicate adjective), like the expression of iden- tity, "Murphy is Murphy," reintroduces time, space, and movement, all of which disrupt the finished, thing-like quality of that end in itself.1" The finite state that Clov had posited with his initial "fini" thus slips away from his grasp, even as he appears to grasp it: "Qa va finir. Qa va peut-etre finir."12 What "it" is that is finishing will never be made clear. Indeed, the characters will remain throughout incapable of defining it, naming it, giving it an identity. In order to bring "it" to an end, the troublesome "ga" would have to disappear and be replaced by something completely knowable. There is no room for an indeterminate "ga" in the perfect state, whether the Republic, absolute knowledge, the psyche, or "ordinary language."13 Clov's response to this inconclusiveness is to retreat into a refuge of his own, analogous in its perfect symmetry to the New Jerusalem. The door, we are told, leads into the kitchen, the domestic laboratory in which coction is produced, the coction associated by the ancients with the balance, equilibrium, and harmonious proportions of the ideal. Nevertheless, like the City of God Saloon in Murphy, Clov's 376</page><page sequence="7">kitchen is not without its carnivalesque dimensions, for a kitchen is still squarely within the realm of the body. Clov's kitchen is in fact not really so far from the garbage cans as he would like to believe. Even though retreating into the kitchen can give him a moment of solace, it is clearly only a moment. He is at the beck and call of a higher authority. The latter, considering itself to be the Alpha of the play's system, though empirically it appears posterior to the flesh, is the egotistical Hamm. Like Mr. Endon playing chess with Murphy, Hamm has "allowed" Clov to make the first move. Now it is his turn to play. Clov will continually expend his energies in a mechanical attempt to comprehend or systematically order the world, with his Galilean telescope, methodological ladder, and artificial or deadened specimens. What he will see only confirms his senses in their frustra- tion and anguish. Hamm may create the illusion of having clearer sight by cleaning his glasses, but he is really blind. His eyes totally white, he has no pupil through which to look into the world. His knowledge of it, like that of those who dwell entirely in the mind, must come from an inner sight. Nevertheless, even Hamm's intuition cannot do without sensory information provided by a pupil of a different sort: Clov. The autonomy of his insight may thus be a sham. Clov chooses mechanical routines as means to overcome or repress the anxiety provoked by his cloven nature. Unable to move his legs, Hamm is confined to his mind. He must play with words, creating fictions to compensate for the flux that surrounds and permeates him. Hamm, with his "teint tres rouge" (FP, p. 16), resembles the Red King whose dream may constitute the entire story. The Tweedle brothers suggest a possibility that greatly disturbed Lewis Carroll's heroine: Who is more real, the dreaming Red King or Alice? Or rather, perhaps we should ask with Alice, which is the dream world? This is the question that closes Through the Looking Glass, and it could be asked of Fin de Partie. Which is the real world, the realm of everyday existence or that of ideas? From a materialist point of view, the ideal world is a fiction. From an idealist perspective, the phenomenal world is an illusion. Unless the disagreement is between those who hold that nature is merely the projection of the finite mind (e.g., Alice's, understood as either an individual or as a representative of the human mind), and those who identify real nature with the thought or activity of the World Mind (as represented by the Red King and itself an anthropomorphic concept). When is Hamm "dreaming"? When he is asleep, or when he is awake? When he is reconstructing the world from Clov's observation, or when he is inventing his chronicle? Or perhaps the distinction be- tween dreaming and waking, between interpretation and fact, or even between fiction and fact, is no longer entirely relevant here-not at least as a pure distinction. Perhaps everything is to some extent a dream or a fiction-or at least an interpretation--when the world "out there" can no longer be allowed absolute existence. This brings to mind Nietzsche's critique of Kant's epistemology. Kant argues, in effect, that this world is always interpreted. No act of perception can ever be perfectly objective, an immediate vision of the 377</page><page sequence="8">world as it really is in itself, for man cannot perceive except through the categories and procedures of human reason. Nietzsche goes further by maintaining that, if so, we have no grounds for postulating even the existence of such a world "in itself," a world standing there outside of or before interpretation. There is, he concludes, no pure opposition between the "true" and the "apparent" world. All interpretation is of this world, the only one there is. There is always only an interpreted world.'4 If life is, in fact, a dream to be interpreted, i.e., an interpretation to be interpreted, we are faced with the problem of interpreting from the inside, as it were. How can we judge among interpretations? Are some "truer" than others? better? And what would this mean? Can inter- pretation ever constitute knowledge? Hamm awakes from his deep sleep and, upon removing his shroud, prepares to "look" again at the world around him. But what exactly does he want? His desires seem contradictory. On the one hand, he wants to separate himself from Clov, or rather, he wants Clov to separate himself from Hamm, either by leaving (quitter) his "master" or by killing him (achever). On the other hand, he wants Clov to comple- ment or complete him (achever). He seems, like Murphy, to want it both ways. His is the impossible humanist dream. Either by expulsion or sublation, however, the cleft that maintains the "Nous" by keeping Hamm and Clov apart, while nevertheless keeping them together, would disappear.'15 Yet both are impossible. Clov can neither leave Hamm nor finish him. Thus they continue instead, like the pulsating universe of certain cosmological models, alternately cleaving to and cleaving from one another. Or is Hamm avoiding the end while profoundly desiring it, because he fears or knows he will ultimately be disappointed? His equivocation may be, as Cavell suggests, his response to the dilmma.16 But it may also be a way of putting off any serious reflection about this particular problem, as well as the problematic in general. Are sterile equivocation, paralysis, bad faith, etc., the only possible attitudes when faced, like Neary, with a "deathless end"? Why then do Hamm and Clov go on with "cette chose"? Why are they still together? They are "stuck" in their world: "11 n'y a pas d'autre place" (FP, p. 20). They are "stuck" with one another, cloven together. "ll n'y a personne d'autre." Hamm and Clov are, as Heidegger has argued with regard to the entire problem of identity, held towards one another and yet held apart facing one another, with an intensity that never lets up. This carrying out of the relation between the parts of man might be described by the term Austrag, used by Heidegger in his discussion of "being"-a word usually translated as perdurance. It is this Aus-trag, or holding out, that contributes to the anxiety of Hamm and Clov, as it does to that of 0 in Film." Clov would retreat from the confrontation with the bothersome questions that Hamm repeatedly poses in varied forms in order to re- tain him. Yet Hamm's compulsion is yet another attempt to avoid re- thinking these questions: "Ah les vieilles questions, les vieilles reponses, il n'y a que ?a!" (FP, p. 56). This repetition characterizes the 378</page><page sequence="9">course of Western rationalism as it does the course of Hamm's journme. Even though the human mind knows that it will not lead to the desired telos, it is less disturbing to continue along this path than to strike out upon less familiar ones. Such "new" paths need not, and in fact could not, be totally with- out relation to the old one, for it is impossible to leap completely out of one's tradition. Yet one need not repeat compulsively, thoughtlessly, with Hamm and Clov, the same questions and answers. A more creative form of repetition is possible, one that, by re-playing or rethinking tradi- tional patterns, continually reinscribes them in truly meaningful vari- ations, thus infusing (or re-infusing) them with regenerative, or at least with what Derrida has called "solicitous," force. Repetition of this sort cannot be understood simply in terms of the counterfinalities and regressions that according to Sartrean existentialism repeatedly forestall the progressive liberation of Man. It suggests that tradition provides us, as Heidegger maintained, with many resources which, although as yet undeveloped, may still be realizable. We may, however, approach them in different ways. We may recover those that have been suppressed as too problematic or subversive. Or at least bring them forward for critical examination. We may then favor some while yet re- jecting others. No pure continuity exists, in other words. Nor any pure discontinuity either, although some change is no doubt ineluctable. New events, including new possibilities, will always occur. Nevertheless these are themselves always conditioned to some extent by the past. Repetition, then, involves the "handing down" to ourselves of possibilities, "but not necessarily as they have come down." It may be seen as the return of a certain inventive potential.'1 In a sense, it is the return of this too often repressed force, like that of the cloven in all its manifestations, that by thwarting the desire for a totally unified end, creates the tensions of this fin de partie. Thus, when Clov disappears from the scene, he reappears in the form of Nagg (from clou to Nagel, as R. Cohn suggests).19 The repressed instinctual forces return, now from the garbage cans into which they had been cast. Hamm would finish off this disconcerting reminder of his physical nature: "Boucle-le!" (FP, p. 24). He therefore sends his infernal double against those very forces he so often represents. The attitudes of Hamm and Clov towards nature are complex and not entirely free of contradiction, if not entirely confused. For Hamm, who must use his own insight to speculate upon the scanty evidence provided by his pupil, Natura appears as constant change. This he understands in evolutionary terms, regretting only that he and Clov do not appear to be part of it: "La nature nous a oubli" (FP, p. 25). Clov, however, points out that their evident deterioration proves that this is not the case. They are part of the natural process, but that process depends upon deterioration. In nature there is no gain without loss; indeed, in nature every thing is eventually lost. Every natural being is eventually left behind as detritus. Disillusioned at not being offered what he desires from nature, Hamm acquires a more simply negative, and even destructive, view of it. If there is neither absolute gain, nor anything free of change (and therefore of loss), better that the natural process should not exist at all. 379</page><page sequence="10">Clov, on the other hand, as if he had been following the course set out by Galileo or Newton, would limit his knowledge of nature to what can be generalized systematically from observation, objective and precise, of the environment. The result is the devitalization of nature by its reduction to abstract terms. In this way man's desire for domina- tion through scientific knowledge, the humanist form of what L6vi- Strauss calls "species imperialism," may ultimately conceal a desire to eliminate nature altogether: "II n'y a plus de nature." (FP, p. 25). Heidegger, following Nietzsche, points out that in their more extreme forms, the scentific mentality shares with idealism a fundamental mistrust and even hatred of this world.20 Yet both Hamm and Clov are led into contradiction by an aware- ness of the fact that the object of their studies is subject to continued modifications and variations. This causes both characters considerable distress. Their efforts to comprehend and explain the natural world seem inevitably to go awry, producing only a confused mass of fairly obvious distortions: "Personne au monde n'a jamais pens6 aussi tordu que nous" (FP, p. 25). This suggests the need for some critical re- flection upon the way such problems have habitually been addressed. But Hamm and Clov are unequal to the task. The one looks to repress his anxiety with tranquilizers, while the other retreats into his cubicle. Both are growing impatient with the entire interpretative project: "Qa ne va pas vite" (FP, p. 26). Clearly, at least, it is not leading very quickly towards any final resolution. That need not mean it is leading nowhere, however. The dialogue continues. From the position of nature, we pass to that of knowledge. Clov's kitchen, from Hamm's point of view, is not unlike Plato's cave. There Clov, like the chained prisoners, passes his time staring at the wall. Hamm offers two mocking de- scriptions of what Clov sees there. The first "Mane. Man'" (FP, p. 26), suggests that if Clov believes he can comprehend the world in numerical or quantitative terms, he is undoubtedly mistaken. More im- portant, Hamm appears to be suggesting that quantitative "truth" itself is related to, or in some sense involves, faith in a sort of revelation. The great pioneer scientists all held with serene confidence a belief in the mathematical (and therefore abstract) simplicity of nature. To them it was not only a useful methodological principle, it was the fundamental fact of the universe. Mathematics, Galileo believed, represents the structure of nature best. Whatever can be expressed in mathematical discourse is true, and God himself could have no clearer knowledge of the natural order it comprehends. When Bacon took over and modified Plato's image in his Novum Organum, he incorporated it within a metaphoric complex one of whose other parts could be turned against Plato himself. The philosopher's dependence upon deductive reasoning a priori and the ideal of pure mathematics, were included among the "idols" that lead to erroneous conclusions. Following Bacon, much empiricism continued, in Heine's words, to "run about sniffing at things, to collect and classify their charac- teristics" until Kant appeared. Taking up the cave metaphor once again, Heine concludes: "Kant proved that we knew nothing of things as they 380</page><page sequence="11">are in and for themselves and that we can have no knowledge of them except so far as they are reflected in our own soul."21 Thus, in helping to reestablish the possibility of science after Hume, Kant also es- tablished its limits. This world is always interpreted, but there are better and worse interpretations. The better are those with the least amount of error. Nevertheless, some errors are fundamental to the way we think. Indeed they constitute the way we think. These are the basic categories and procedures of human reason: space, time, number, identity, causality, etc. They constitute, as it were, the conditions of the Platonic cave. They can be recognized as distortions, but not be corrected. We cannot think at all without them. Accordingly, no act of perception can ever be completely objective, an unmediated vision of the world as it really is in itself. Science does not provide us with a way out of the cave, as Plato had thought. Hamm, then, who set out to mock Clov by pointing out the dif- ferences, has at the same time uncovered certain similarities. When he thinks the images he sees depict the real world, Clov too is dreaming or interpreting dreams. And like Hamm, Clov is at certain moments aware that he is interpreting and that this self-consciousness announces the waning of any absolute confidence in scientific knowledge: "Je vois ma lumiere qui meurt" (FP, p. 26). Is it impossible then to understand what is happening? Can we ascribe no meaning to the passage of time? The inability to comprehend is a source of Hamm's anguish, an anguish that Clov does not appear to share. Clov merely observes that "queleque chose suit son course" (FP, p. 28) and believes that he has made an impartial, objective state- ment. Yet how does he know that there is a "something" and that it has a "course" to follow? Moreover, he dreams of abstracting an all- encompassing system: "J'aime I'ordre. C'est mon rave. Un monde oui tout serait silencieux et immobile et chaque chose a sa place derniere, sous la derniere poussiere" (FP, p. 78). Thus even if he at times openly disdains Hamm's desperate desire for meaningful purpose, he too would believe that the universe is ultimately quite comprehensible. A perfect whole, it would not need-indeed, it could not have-any other purpose or end. Traditionally, in fact, the fully unified system is its proper telos. The fact that these are largely presuppositions, rather than inductive conclusions from sensory experience, creates another similarity between the speculative Hamm and the ostensibly more empirical Clov. Clov's flicker of an answer, however unsatisfactory, is enough to bring temporary agreement while advancing the dialogue to another stage. Having "met" like Murphy's Miss Counihan, Neary and Wylie, the two characters can now separate, Hamm pretending to expell Clov, Clov pretending to leave freely. "Qa avance" (FP, p. 29). Once Hamm and Clov having thus withdrawn, each into his own abstract dreamworld, the d6chets they have let fall to earth come to life. As Nell and Nagg emerge from their garbage cans, they replay the dialogue of spirit and matter in a more organic mode. The bicycle accident outside Sedan in which Nell and Nagg lost their legs might be described as a carnivalized re-enactment of the 381</page><page sequence="12">consequences of the Enlightenment which, according to Taine, led through the Revolution to the catastrophe of 1870. If, then, Nell and Nagg are indeed meant to signify mankind at the corporeal level, it may have less to do with espousing a bestial irrationalism, as Lukbcs feared,22 than with criticizing the smug rationalism of our hubristically humanist tradition for its encouragement of something analogous to precisely that sort of reduction. At the same time the reemergence of these repressed corporeal elements keeps Hamm from mental peace within himself. Cavell suggests that their burlesque intercourse reminds Hamm of a childhood scene when he, like his Old Testament namesake, beheld, as it were, the means by which he himself was conceived.23 For this transgression Noah's son was cursed. For this original sin of the flesh, Nagg's son curses his father. "Maudit fornicateur" (FP, p. 24). To displace the distressing primal scene, Hamm would recreate in his imagination the sensory world he has denied. Nagg finds Hamm's Fichtean attempt to derive the world of the Nicht-lch from the Ich a ludicrous enterprise. In opposition, Nagg's world-that of the bodily desires that need to be satisfied, of the mange that needs to be scratched-is the real world. Nagg therefore counters with his own more material reworking of the mind's recreation myth: "le monde et le pantalon" (FP, p. 36-38). The comparison calls to mind Herr Teufelsdrickh's magnum opus. Nagg, however, presents the Divine Tailor as a careless craftsman who rushed through the job in order to rest on the Sabbath: Genesis as a bad Jewish joke. Although in recent decades it has been the absurdists who have, somewhat arrogantly, regarded the cosmos as "botched," the idea has a long genealogy. In Nagg's story, by contrast, the human tailor, by working from Christmas to Easter, does manage in the end to save his creation, but only by concealing the irregularities of le creux beneath the smoothly tailored lines of an artifical fond: a humanist (and to some extent an existentialist) rewriting of a bad Christian joke. Nell too is obsessed by le fond, the bottom of Lake Como, that draws her down to the depths of nostalgic reverie. Her own retreat from materiality is by an act of negation, of "nelling." Hers is the death-wish of the body that wants to return to an inorganic stasis. For her too the desire for le fond is a desire for the end. Despite their more corporeal nature, both Nell and Nagg suggest different ways of denying or even destroying that very nature. The continuing prattle of Nagg and Nell, so similar to his own conversations with Clov, disturbs Hamm's solipsistic dreaming. It draws his attention to his remaining facticity, those nagging remains of Nicht- Ich: his physical aspects, his heredity, his past in general. And therefore to their, his, and "its" im-perfection: "Qa ne va donc jamais finir!" (FP, p. 38). They must all be expelled and carted away. This is, as before, a job for Clov in his role as nightman. Perhaps if Hamm could circumscribe the limits of his domain, he would have a surer comprehension of his powers. The walls mark these limits and they are constructed of the basic building blocks of 382</page><page sequence="13">epistemology: space, time, number, causality, etc. What if, as Hume argued, these bricks were hollow, merely the products of mental habits developed through repeated perceptual experience? Or what if these "briques creuses" (FP, p. 42) were the a priori categories that Kant posited in response to Hume as the limits of pure reason? Hamm's wall would then come to resemble Clov's cave. What happens if these categories are recognized as interpretations rather than truth? What is "tout Ga c'est crux" (FP, p. 42)? Then man would never be able to join the beginning to the end: "Assez! On rentre." "On n'a pas fait le tour" (FP, p. 42). But does this simply mean that tout ga c'est vide de sens? The cleft thus reappears in the form of the creux, as it did in Nagg's joke, to unsettle man's attempt to rebuild the world on an abso- lute foundation with himself at the center. Their repeated failure to produce a fully satisfying interpretation, leads each character to seek relief in a state of equanimity: Hamm by turning again to his calmants, Clov by retreating to his kitchen. They are attempting to follow the advice of Alcmaeon, "ce vieux m6decin," who believed that if only man could achieve self-harmonization, "joining the beginning to the end," through an act of atonement, i.e., an act of making one again, then perhaps at least the passion of man's finitude could be eliminated. Hamm, however, has doubts. He therefore tries to keep Clov from leaving by recounting his own version of the story of salvation, a variant of Clov's more mechanistic one. The latter is uninterested, but Nagg can still be bribed into listening with the promise of a baptismal drag6e or a Christmas sugar-plum. Hamm's own histoire can also be seen as an attempt to reinter- pret both the Father's work and his own father's interpretation of it. Alternatively it may be regarded as a humanist reinterpretation of the work of the Logos, a revision of the Son's attempt to recuperate what the first son had corrupted. Hamm's story is a story of salvation, a story to place beside those of the mad painter and Mother Pegg. Hamm's story begins, however, somewhere in the middle (the sort of just middle that he is always seeking). This "beginning" parodies Clov's opening words and thus also the words with which Christ consummated his own work of atonement. But Hamm's words an- nounce the opposite. "II n'y aura plus de voix" (FP, p. 70). No more Logos; no more Way. The very possibility of full identity or end has been lost. Hamm's histoire, in other words, opens with a prologue in which all real hope of a way out is already forsaken. As in the case of the mad painter, to be saved now only means to have been spared, i.e., to have been forgotten. The prologue was a false start. Yet the next attempt is not a true beginning either. For he begins by repeating something he has already said. The third time he simply proceeds. Hamm has as much trouble beginning his story as he has in finishing. The problems of comment commencer are similar to those of comment finir. Hamm's story is a Christmas carol that comes to no end, although it is reaching its conclusion. What is certain is that there is no remedy proposed for the disease of life from which the characters suffer. There will be no rebirth either sacred or profane. But without 383</page><page sequence="14">(re)birth, I'histoire will soon conclude. Hamm, however, does not want it to stop before his own personal histoire has been finished. Like Moran, he will only accept an ending that brings everything together into the classical whole, like a well-made play or the perfect novel. What can he do if he runs out of story before his time is up? If all else fails he will have to continue reworking the story that he has already written, perfecting it as best he can, hoping to make his chronicle coincide with his story, its end with his end. Or he can add new charcters. But from where? Clov, whose natural member has been crippled through contact with Hamm, can only bring forth a half-exterminated rat. This rat episode replays Hamm's chronicle on the materialist level. There is no salvation for the rat, or in more concrete terms, he cannot get away. "II ne peut pas se sauver" (FP, p. 75). And yet, his end is not really an end. Like Hamm and Clov, he will be finished only "tout &amp; I'heure." If there is no salvation on earth, Hamm and Nagg can still ap- peal to heaven for an answer. Their hopes, however, are unfounded. "II n'existe pas" (FP, p. 76). At least not until they have reinvented Him to fulfill their needs. Without a divine Father, there can be no rebirth. Without a divine Source, there can be no oasis in the desert of life. Without the divine Logos, there is no way to satisfy man's need for the Ultimate Word. Man has therefore no means of attaining what he wants most of all from the world, and perhaps even more than the world: a solid foundation or core of Truth, sure and unchanging, a stable point of reference. Because this desire is so strong, humanist ideology even- tually proposes man himself as a replacement for the lost center of meaning and value, though the suspicion may be that he is a charlatan, unable to deliver what the tradition has promised. Even the mind that would be God finally finds itself alone before the darkness of death and cries out for salvation. This is the curse of Nagg upon his son, the gnawing doubts about one's own self- sufficiency. Setting himself apart from and above what he perceives to be radically other-be it nature, body, en-soi, object, Nicht-lch-ex- pelling, as it were, tout Qa from his presence, he will find that he can- not stand alone. As the child Hamm once cried out to his father, as he later needed him to listen to his story, so will he later cry out to him during his last soliloquy. And so will he constantly recall Clov to his side (as Nagg recalls Nell to his). In the end, however, he will get no answer. No full reconciliation with the other is possible. Neither pi- ty, nor love, nor mastery through physical or psychological or cognitive means, can ever enable the self fully to possess the other or effect a perfect union between them. The nagging curse of incompletion, or non-totalization will continue to hang upon I'homme. Hamm then tries to arrive at a satisfying consummation by himself. All attempts at the union with Clov have failed. His moves in that direction have indeed produced only a strange jeu d'6checs. If his consequent humanist solipsism appears ludicrous, it is really no more so than all attempts at teleology. Yet man insists on taking these failures seriously, believing that, through their very failure, these funny stories in some way reveal the dismal truth about la comedie humaine 384</page><page sequence="15">and consequently becoming even more depressed. Where Democritus could not help laughing, the tradition has preferred to weep: "On pleure, on pleure, pour rien, pour ne pas rire, et peu &amp; peu ... une vraie tristesse vous gagne" (FP, p. 91). Before Hamm could attain a satisfactory end, a final summa- tion would be necessary. It is not enough that the play should just stop, it should conclude with an ultimate evaluation of what has led to this final state. And it is not surprising that Hammlhomme should see himself as the source of that final significance. In his last monologue, he thus returns to his opening line: "A moi ... De jouer" (FP, p. 110). He once again picks up the threads he had dropped along the way- his means for reaching the desired end-and tries to weave them into a unified text. The result, however, is more a catalog. Like the grains in the paradoxes proposed by the Old Greeks to whom Clov alludes, these bits and pieces can never add up to a whole life. The same could be said of Fin de Partie. It plays repeated variations on a set of com- plex themes. But these, because they are also scenes fraught with in- ternal tensions, interplays, and indeterminacies, do not and could never constitute a totalized work. Thus Hamm's last soliloquy, or rather the last speeches of both Hamm and Clov, appear, like the chess game between Mr. Endon and Murphy, as a replay in miniature of the entire endgame. First Hamm abandons as futile his hope of being the Prime Mover. Receuillement, in the poetic reworking of its religious sense, is aesthetically pleasing but ultimately not fulfilling. Hamm's rewriting of history ends inconclusively. Reconciliation with the other is attempted three times. And each time it fails. Moreover, Hamm's quest for totalization is really a negative one. He already knew it would fail. Indeed, all the means at his disposal were perceived as moments of negation: "instants nuls, toujours nuls" (FP, p. 111). And insofar as it seeks to deny the dynamic flux of life, or bring it to an end, the very idea of totalization is in some sense nihilistic. But even negative points still do not add up to a "hole." The count cannot be made, nor the histoire brought to a true end. Hamm has led the play through a series of renunciations to the last renunciation, that of the (humanized) Logos itself: "et n'en parlons plus ... ne parlons plus" (FP, p. 112). Even despairing silence fails, however, since Hamm must add another word, and another deed, or rather, as in the beginning, another act. Just as Clov began the play with an act of repression, so Hamm now attempts to end the play with another. He would simply stop the flow of interpretations in an arbitrary manner, employing "the old stauncher." Yet, what is repressed reemerges once again when Clov returns to decenter Hamm's deadly solipsism and close the play more or less as it opened. For Hamm and Clov the game of life acquires true significance only insofar as it can be described in terms of a comprehensive system or goal. The fundamental problem, then, as it was for Antoine Roquentin in Sartre's La Naus6e, is one of excess and lack. On the one hand, none of the characters is able to provide an interpretation fully adequate to 385</page><page sequence="16">empirical reality. Life seems constantly to exceed, in one way or another, conceptual comprehension. On the other hand, in their desire for perfect order and propriety, however, the characters themselves become excessive. Life in this world, then, appears inadequate to their expectations. In both cases, however, the characters take their own desires and aspirations as the measure of all things. This is what authorizes an existentialist humanist interpretation of Fin de Partie. I am not, then, trying to argue that such an interpretation is irrelevant to the play. I should like, rather, to suggest that it has a different sort of relevance than many have believed. For the reading I have attempted to present implies that existentialist humanism has been prominently situated within the play and does not, therefore, provide a complete explanation of it. It would be difficult either to deny or to overestimate the fact that one of Beckett's points de d6part is the Cartesian cogito, or human subjectivity in general, for they figure prominently in most, if not all, his fictional and non-fictional work. His "subjects" are usually engaged in endless struggles with the irrational "others" that constitute the natural world. These forces frustrate the desire for rational control by constantly destabilizing anthropocentric structures that the pro- tagonists erect. Yet regret or despair at this absurdly exuberant flux and general disorderly conduct of the world is not the "essential meaning" or "message" of Beckett's "play," but merely one especially tempting response with which he himself is playing in a demonstratively critical, or at least parodic, fashion. Fin de Partie, like so many of Beckett's works, including his very recent "Catastrophe," suggest that humanism, including its existentialist variant, has demonstrated neither that man's freedom to act is rooted exclusively in subjectivity, nor that this subjectivity has granted him any real dignity. On the contrary, it reveals the way in which humanist ideology has debased mankind along with the entire natural world in which we inevitably dwell. Indeed, Beckett shows how the subjugation and torture of nature (to borrow Bacon's phrase) by a "technocrat" like Clov and the denial of the "messy" aspects of earthly life by an "idealist" like Hamm are both based upon similarly humanist ideas about man, his place in the world, his relation to all nonhuman being. Thus, at least indirectly, Beckett's play suggests that human dignity might be enhanced if homo rationalis were to see himself less as the master of the world, the focus of its meaning and value, than as one vital element in a decentered world where no form of being ever attains or maintains complete domination.24 The end-problems that plague the characters of Fin de Partie on the narrative level reappear on the textual. Here the reader finds that, if suffering from the same fixation, he or she will be frustrated with Hamm and Clov. The play teases or tantalizes with situations and con- structions that, although they continually excite the desire for total comprehension, never allow it to be realized. One of the difficulties of confronting the play is that the inter- pretive handholds seem so scarce and obscure. In his earlier work, Beckett offered a chaotic proliferation of cultural references The striking difference in works like Fin de Partie has often been explained in terms of Beckett's putative effort to overcome Joyce's influence. Yet 386</page><page sequence="17">it may also be argued that Beckett did not so much abandon Joyce's style as translate it into another mode. And here the attraction of Flaubert's highly problematic aesthetics should not be left out of the account. The obscurity and starkness of Beckett's later style creates a text that often gives the impression that he is striving for a monadic or closed system of language. This would suggest a repetition on the stylistic level of the quest for self-identity and totalization that appears within the text on the level of narrative. The attempt at a closed text can be said to manifest itself in the progressive paring away of extra- textual references as Beckett moves, for example, from Murphy to Fin de Partie, and from Fin de Partie to later works. This can be interpreted in at least two ways. First, one may say that the words are increasingly shorn of their connotative qualities and reduced, as Cavell puts it, to "declarative utterances, ones of pure denotation." Cavell considers that Beckett shares with both existentialism and positivism the desire to "escape connotation, rhetoric, the noncognitive, the irrationality and awkward memories of ordinary language, in favor of the directly verifiable, the isolated and perfected present." Cavell thus points to the ontological nature of the common philosophical and scientific quest for the purely "cognitive" statement.25 Implied here is an understanding of being in terms of presence and of langauge in terms of adequatio. If, then, the text were in fact "closed" in this way, the quest would have been successful. Although the characters fail to attain their end, the text would have succeeded in attaining its analogue linguistically. There are, however, at least two problems with this view. First, even the ordinary words that remain, like lunette, bicyclette, escabeau, chien, are never simply denotative. Without the restrictions imposed by explicit metaphoric expression or cultural allusion, Beckett's words may become more, rather than less, charged with possible meaning, since they inevitably bring with them a wide range of potential con- notations by virtue of the fact that they belong to a living language behind which stands the vast structure of contemporary as well as historical usage. This is not, of course, to say that all connotations are equally possible or appropriate. There remains the limiting context pro- vided by the text itself. Each word or phrase can only have meaning as part of the particular network of relations that actually make up any given textual fabric. As I have tried to demonstrate, however, the com- parative simplicity of Beckett's langauge in Fin de Partie may actually open the play up to interpretive reflection. In any case, it has yet to be shown that the play has anything like a unique denotation or simply literal meaning. Even Cavell would no doubt admit that it means for him something different than it does for Adorno or Martin Esslin. And yet, none of these interpretations is simply wrong. Second, the desire for a purely denotative or literal language may actually be caricatured within the play itself, insofar as it can be related to "Sprat's medium" for transmitting scientific information, that classical regimen proffered by Clov and rejected by Nagg as utterly unpalatable.26 Alternatively, the ideal of pure self-referentiality has also been 387</page><page sequence="18">imputed to Beckett.27 This may be called a special reflexive instance of the perfectly denotative language. The ideal linguistic signifier here becomes its own unique signified. To the extent that it could appear cut off from every extra-textual referent, whether historical, cultural, social, or political, language would then present itself as an ens causa sui. It would be autonomous and self-referential. As smooth as Christ's seamless garment, as blank as Flaubert's ideal wall, it would exist only for its own sake. Indeed, it is precisely for its apparent alienation from, or even rejection of, temporal context (understood in rather narrowly presentist socio-economic terms) that Lukacs criticizes Beckett's work as decadent. This idea is, however, subject to the same objections we have noted with regard to purely denotative language. In addition one may ask whether a self-referential use of language, a language entirely de- void of external reference would be possible at all. Just as there is no domain completely "outside" of language, there may well be none com- pletely "inside" it either. For language is essentially the scene of an often tense interplay of meanings and therefore of contexts. A langauge without contextual reference would be a langauge without meaning. And a langauge without meaning would be no language at all. One may, of course, wish to argue that this is precisely the point. Silence is, if anything, Beckett's ideal. This is a common-place of Beckett criticism. But silence that would be produced or attained through perfect self-referentiality or self-containment, would also be the end of langauge, or of signification in general, through the reali- zation of perfect self-identity or totalization. Thus, as a linguistic ideal it is related, or even analogous, to the goal of the dominant onto- theological tradition of the West. As such it too is implicated in the carnivalizing critique of Fin de Partie. Furthermore, absolute self-referentiality is perhaps only an ideal form of the self-consciousness that is apparent in Beckett's works from at least the Trilogy on. The theatricality of Hamm and Clov has re- peatedly been noted and analyzed by critics. Yet it is this very self- consciousness that reveals a fundamental problem in the concept of self-reference, a problem it shares with the concept of apperception. To know oneself as a character in a play is to recognize that the self is not entirely at one with itself. The theatrical distance between "self" and role becomes explicit. To know oneself as conscious of being con- scious, as referring to oneself, is also to make explicit the paradoxical play of excess and lack involved in all concepts of self-knowledge and identity. A self-referential text that would know itself to be such could never be, then, a closed monadistic system. Self-consciousness might instead be seen as a form of internal, multi-voiced dialogue that replaces the ironic narrator of Murphy and approaches the style indirect libre of Flaubert. In Murphy the ironic nar- rator served as a more or less stable reference point. Still the central figure of authority, he commented upon the characters and their actions as if from above. Fin de Partie is also permeated with irony, but of a more diffused and therefore unsettling sort. There is no stable reference and therefore the reader/spectator can never really be certain as to the</page><page sequence="19">"vantage point" from which he or she is viewing the play. The very idea of a stable reference is called into question. Only the interwoven strands of the textual matrix "itself" can limit the proliferation of interpretations. Viewed as a kind of "cultural anarchy," this might seem to imply that the text is ultimately meaningless: for many, a tempting interpre- tation. No single meaning, after all, emerges. Indeed, for some, the references might even appear to cancel each other out, as in the comices agricoles scene of Madame Bovary. A plurality of meanings is seen as chaos; chaos is regarded as the void. Aristotle regarded it this way, as did classical philosophy in general. It is also, however, the way Hamm and Clov habitually reason. Without such formal or ideal perfection, they are overcome, like Bouvard and Pecuchet, by a nausea of despair and discouragement. This reaction is symptomatic of the anxiety that uncertainty inevitably induces. To those who long for a secure universe, completely under man's control despite doubts aroused by modern developments in science and philosophy, every possibility that does not conform to traditional modes of apprehension or does not fit into the predetermined order upsets and threatens to destroy the fragile "perfected" model. To those, on the other hand, who are willing or able to accept the relative insecurity of the universe as it has been represented by modern physics, for example, a universe in which man participates as a vital, but no longer as the central element, the proliferation of carnivalesque "forms" of this kind need not be evaluated simply in terms of its destabilizing potential. And destabilization itself need not be taken simply as a threat to every form of order. The absence of a unique, ultimate meaning is itself open, I think, to another, more carnivalesque interpretation, one that regards it not in terms of chaos or significative void, but as a cornucopia of relative or partial meanings. The seemingly fragmented and dispersed cultural references could then be seen as forming a network of signifying elements that do not unite into any totalized interpretation, but are not on that account without any significance at all. This understanding of regulated interpretive play would contribute to the possibility of new structures of meaning more open to self-contestation and for that reason better able to withstand the anxiety and internal pressures that have contributed to the breakdown of older, more repressively humanist ones.28 State University of New York at Plattsburg NOTES 1 For a discussion of Murphy as a Menippean satire of monism, see my article, "The Guffaw of the Abderite: Murphy and the Democritean Universe," Journal of Beckett Studies, 10. 2 Stanley Cavell, "Ending the Waiting Game," Must We Mean What We Say?
