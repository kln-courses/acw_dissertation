<plain_text><page sequence="1">SUBJECTIVE AIM IN PROFESSOR WHITE- HEAD'S PHILOSOPHY PROFESSOR C. LLOYD MORGAN IN Process and Reality Professor A. N. Whitehead formulates a Cosmology which embodies a resolute attempt to combine in one philosophical synthesis a scientific account of Concrescence with a metaphysical explanation thereof in terms of Creativity. I seek here to play the part of a commentator who approaches this cosmology through the avenue of comparative psychology. I One who comments on the thesis of a colleague may be permitted to state at the outset the chief tenets of his own philosophical creed. In the A B C of my philosophy I place under the heading A all Agency or Activity, creative or directive; under B all physical events to be discussed in terms of their Behaviour; and under C all mental occurrences of which Consciousness in us is the most salient example. These three are inseparable, though each may be distinguished from the others, and may be discussed in abstraction from the others. In this sense each forms a 'closed system.' But only in abstraction from the others. The aim of the philosopher is to rise above such abstraction and to see all physical events, all mental occurrences, and all forms of agency as one whole within which all instances of A, B, and C shall be included. None the less, we do well to use abstractions as the steps by which to rise above them that we may see all things wholly, so long as we bear in mind that a 'closed-system' method of inquiry is only a means to the philosophical end we have in view. Now, as a matter of history, those men of science whose inquiries lie within the closed system of physics have in practice been led -or many of them have been led-to exclude agency from their special field of work as physicists. And taking for granted the mental processes of the observer and the thinker in perceiving and in reasoning, they have handed 'mind' over to the psychologist for discussion within his closed system of inquiry. But those who are at work within that closed system fall into two schools. The members of one school lay emphasis on the agency of mind. The members of the other school regard all explanation in terms of such agency as beyond the scope of the science of psychology. 28i</page><page sequence="2">PHILOSOPHY As a policy of method I choose the latter course. In other words, modern comparative psychology as such has, for me, no more concern with agency than has modern physics. On this understanding there are, broadly speaking, two main provinces of natural science-physics and psychology. These I label B and C respectively. In biology they are so intimately co-related that, given such-and-such physical events in one closed system, concomitant mental occurrences in the other can (even now) in large measure be inferred. None the less, they may be distinguished. But biologists fall into two schools. The members of one school invoke agency, that of Life or Mind, to account for all the physiological processes they observe. Members of the other school are content to record their observations and to formulate generalizations in terms of which these observations may be interpreted. As a policy of scientific method I subscribe to the tenets of the latter school; and I distinguish a physical and physiological body-story under B from a psychological mind-story under C. Each story deals with 'concrescence,' which, as I read it, is advance through new products to further novelty-physical products in this story, mental products in that. But here, as commentator on Mr. Whitehead's text, I am faced by a difficulty. I elect to use different words in the universe of discourse of this story and of that-to reserve, for example, the words 'experience' and 'feeling' for primary use only in a psycho- logical context. Mr. Whitehead elects to use these words in a much wider sense so as to do duty in both contexts. He speaks, for example, of a 'percipient event' in the body. I reserve the word 'percipient' for use in mind-story only. In the body there is, I should say, a recipient event consequent on the stimulation of specialized 'recep- tors.' For me all recipience is physical; all percipience is mental. The so-called 'avenues' of sense are paths of recipience to be inter- preted physically and physiologically. I should not speak, with Locke, of ideas 'conveyed in' by 'the senses.' In distinguishing 'creativity' under A from 'concrescence' under B or C, I am fully prepared to follow Mr. Whitehead. And yet we both seek to include them in one philosophical synthesis which shall do justice alike to natural science and to the metaphysics of agency. But here, too, there are verbal difficulties which centre in the word 'cause.' Mr. Whitehead proclaims from the house-top of his system that we can give no metaphysical explanation of any new step onwards in concrescent advance, or any subsequent recurrence of like events, unless we fully reinstate causality, both efficient and final, in its rightful position of metaphysical pre-eminence. Under the ban of science they have been ousted from what purports to be a comprehensive cosmology-as he thinks with disastrous results. 282</page><page sequence="3">PROFESSOR WHITEHEAD'S PHILOSOPHY None the less, I, for one, should still exclude causality, final or efficient, from the council-chambers of natural science. I should speak of the so-called 'laws of causation' in science as 'laws of relatedness,' on the understanding that both physical and mental relatedness are included on like terms. If relatedness suffices for the scientific interpretation of all concrescence under the headings B and C, may we not reserve the word 'cause' for use only in that metaphysical universe of discourse in which agency plays the title-role ? II Near the outset of Process and Reality Mr. Whitehead lays much stress on 'dipolar prehension.' In any instance of prehension, he says, there are three factors: (a) the subject which is prehending; (b) the datum prehended; and (c) the 'subjective form' which is how that subject prehends that datum. He then introduces the word 'superject.' The datum, he says, is superjective at one pole and implies the subject at the other pole. Hence the word 'subject' may always be construed as 'subject- superject.' Thus far the psychologist, as man of science, may find little difficulty, at any rate on first inspection. He may suppose that 'dipolarity' merely re-names the distinction he is wont to draw between subject and object. But he must probe deeper. In Mr. Whitehead's usage the word 'object' has metaphysical import. It is that which is 'ingressive' into an 'actual entity or occasion.' It is 'eternal' in 'potentiality,' whereas the actual occasion is passing and perishing. We have therefore to distinguish two kinds of dipolar prehension: 'physical prehension' between actual entities, and 'conceptual prehension' of eternal objects. Such use of the words 'physical' and 'conceptual' gives pause to the psychologist. He commonly reserves the latter for use only at the reflective level of concrescence in human thought. Not so in Mr. Whitehead's usage. It is applicable at all levels of 'experience,' including those which lie far below the level of that which he speaks of as 'conscious.' It is applicable comprehensively to the interpreta- tion of 'experience' of the week-old infant; of the embryo in the womb; of each molecule therein or elsewhere. Conceptual prehension is universal in its range. It is in this metaphysical or ultimate sense that 'subject-superject' comes into the philosophical picture. It is in this creative sense, as I understand, that 'subjective form' should be construed. In Mr. Whitehead's philosophy the eternal objects which are ingressive into actual occasions of concrescence subserve subjective creativity in the category of the ultimate. Creativity is the 'principle 283</page><page sequence="4">PHI LOSOPHY of novelty,' the producer of all that is new in concrescent advance. In the fluent world of actual occasions concrescence is, he says, inherent in the constitution of each particular entity. But apart from creativity, each actual entity momentarily perishes as such. Under repetition, however, it is succeeded by another on some line of advance. Hence there is 'transition' in fluency. Concrescence proceeds toward the final cause which is the 'subjective aim'; transition is the vehicle of the efficient cause which is the 'immortal past.' It seems, then, that subjective aim is always central. And when we pass to further detail, such words as 'appetition,' 'end,' 'ideal,' 'satisfaction,' and 'purpose' are introduced to fill in the 'conceptual' picture. So closely interwoven is the texture of Mr. Whitehead's thought that it is not easy to summarize his thesis without omitting relevant qualifications. Let me try to do so in brief. Take some concrescent process. Metaphysically underlying this process from outset to outcome there is subjective aim in ultimate creativity; and that which is aimed at is the superjective end, with subjective satisfaction in its attainment. Any such process is in accord with the whole order of nature, which, as such, is differentiated from mere 'givenness' by the introduction of 'adaptation' for the attainment of some end. When this end is reached there is fulfilment of the primordial appetition which is the basis of all order. We have here the 'dominant ideal' that creatively inspires the given process of concrescence. The full ideal, however, is only partially attained owing to the inclusion of some measure of disorder, with like measure of dissatisfaction. Notwithstanding this occasional missing of the mark, the subjective aim at satisfaction constitutes the final cause or 'lure' whereby there is determinate concrescence; and the satis- faction attained is an element in the content of creative purpose. All this holds good for any process of concrescence in molecule no less than in man. Underlying every actual Process, as fluent, is creative Reality, as eternal. III Permit me now to supplement the ABC of my philosophy by adding some account of the 'I, 2, 3' of my psychology under C, namely, that branch of natural science which deals genetically and comparatively with the mentality of concrescent organisms. On these terms, apart from such mentality as we may impute or attribute to others than ourselves, one turns to first-hand experience as it is disclosed in and to oneself. I find in myself three salient 'levels' of mentality which I can analytically distinguish-sentient; 284</page><page sequence="5">PROFESSOR WHITEHEAD'S PHILOSOPHY perceptive; and reflective. These I label I, 2, and 3. Let me take them in analytic order downwards. 3. At the reflective, or self-conscious, level I find generalized 'ideas' with correlative 'feelings.' I here use the word 'ideas' in the wide Lockian sense. Reflective ideas are those to which there is reference on my part when I am thinking-I include under the word 'feeling' my enjoyment or awareness in so thinking. Chief among the reflective ideas that I find are those which have reference to a self-myself or another-and to a space-time frame of events. In typical reflection in daily life there is reference of self to some 'place' in this frame of reference. 2. At the perceptive, or conscious, level of my mentality I can analytically distinguish much that is going on all day long in which there is no reflective reference to self and no space-time scheme of events to which past or future occasions are reflectively referred. There is only that which occurs within the current now-occasion of the passing moment of action. But I find on any 'now-occasion' what I speak of as 'fore-experience' of that which I reflectively interpret as 'just-coming'-fore-taste, for example, as I raise a cup of coffee to my lips. This, no doubt, I reflectively interpret as a mental bequest of what has come on previous occasions of like nature. But I have not perceptively in mind, there and then, either retrospective reference to some past occasion, or prospective reference to some future occasion, in a space-time scheme. Fore-experience as such is adjunct to some this occasion. i. At the sentient, or subconscious, level I find no such fore- experience. There is only the mental accompaniment of those fundamental processes, physical and physiological, which afford the bare data of 'experience.' There is just a colour, a touch, a smell, a twinge, a sentient somewhat, and so on; perhaps only feeling 'fit' or 'all-overish'; abstracted from the 'meaning' each conveys. Under I, 2, and 3 the emphasis here falls on temporal relations. And since we live forwards (though reflectively we may think back- wards with reference to past occasions), the main stress in inter- preting the psychological 'I, 2, 3' is in forward regard. Hence one may say: In reflection there is prospective reference to some future occasion; in perception, fore-experience on some this-occasion; in sentience, as such, no time-reference-only some perishing 'now.' In my first-hand experience I find mental occurrences at all three levels, normally going on concurrently, hand-in-hand. In their fluent relatedness they constitute my adult mentality. I pass now to imputation. By this I mean the attribution of mentality at some level, or levels, to someone other than myself. I include under 'someone' an infant, an amoeba, and (speculatively no doubt) perchance a molecule. 285</page><page sequence="6">PHILOSOPHY In reflective scrutiny I discern no such evidence as leads me to impute mentality at all three levels even to all living organisms. To the foetus during the months before birth I impute sentience only. To the infant from birth to about two and a half years I impute perception also. Not till then, and thence onwards in increasing measure, do I impute reflective mentality. In terms of mentality I classify animals as (i) sentient only, (2) perceptive also, and (3) in- cipiently reflective (some apes). Here let me pause. I speak analytically of 'levels' of mentality in some given organism. In myself only have I such first-hand ex- perience as can be submitted by me to first-hand analysis. It is 'distinguishing' analysis, not 'separating' analysis, where that which is submitted to such drastic treatment is thereby destroyed. It is analogous to that which Sir Wm. Bragg applies to a crystal that he may disclose the roles which molecules and atoms play in that crystal as an intact whole, where events are going on simultaneously at different 'levels.' Genetically I speak of 'stages' of mentality. A canon of genetic interpretation which I have been led to accept is this: Since in concrescent order stage 3 follows 2, and this follows r, it is not in accordance with sound scientific method to render an account of what happens at a lower stage of advance in terms appropriate to the interpretation of events at a higher level which has not yet been reached. In the genetic order of concrescent advance reflection is more than perception; perception more than sentience. Here the 'more than' discloses concrescent novelty. But the reflective person is also perceptive; and, as perceptive, he is also sentient. The 'more than' involves the 'also.' Sentience, however, does not imply perception; nor does perception imply reflection. There is a natural order of mental concrescence in the advance of evolutionary process and in that of individual development. IV Having indicated my psychological outlook, I now come back into touch with Mr. Whitehead-into intimate touch with subjective aim and satisfaction in psychological regard. From this point of view each includes a mode of awareness in enjoyment-awareness in aiming in one case, awareness in feeling satisfied in the other case. But subjective aim implies reference to an end in view, now aimed at but not yet attained; satisfaction implies reference to a precedent end in view, then aimed at and now attained. On these terms, however, the whole procedure is typically reflec- 286</page><page sequence="7">PROFESSOR WHITEHEAD'S PHILOSOPHY tive on the part of some person. There are two phases in the pro- cedure: a precedent phase when he is looking forward with prospective reference and aiming with appetition; a subsequent phase when he is looking backward with retrospective reference and feeling satisfied in the attainment of the precedent end. To a merely sentient creature I impute no such subjective aim on his part, and therefore no correlative satisfaction. When a flash makes me blink, what happens may be interpreted if we allow little, if anything, more than belongs to the sentient level of mentality. There is, so far as I can introspectively discover, no subjective aim on my part. Blinking 'with the eyelids' has, no doubt, as its sentient accompaniment, awareness in so behaving. But I should not speak of this as 'satisfaction' if there be no retrospective reference to a precedent end in view which was then prospectively aimed at and is now attained. This takes us down to a level of mentality at which, as I believe, no subjective aim has taken form in the process of concrescence. But, just now, we are concerned with that later stage of genetic advance at which subjective aim has taken form, perhaps as a dominant ideal. Thus far one rests content with regarding subjective aim and consequent satisfaction as late incidents in the course of mental concrescence. Until the reflective stage of mentality is reached they are not yet in evidence. Thus far, however, they are left unexplained. To account for them-and not merely to render a generalized account of them-we must introduce the metaphysics of that creative agency to which their origin is due. Mr. Whitehead does so under the covering notion of 'objectification.' Here we have not only actual relatedness but potential causality of which the relational world disclosed by science is the expression. In the actual world, objectification constitutes the efficient cause through which any new stage of concrescence arises. But the subjective aim, as 'conceptual,' constitutes the final cause whereby there is determinate concrescence at any stage of advance. And the satisfaction that results remains as an element in the content of creative purpose. Philosophically to explain concrescence, an 'urge' onwards and a 'lure' forwards are metaphysically demanded. Even so, I submit that, in an abstractedly scientific interpretation of concrescence, neither urge nor lure should be invoked. Under that policy of method which I accept, cause, efficient or final, is relegated to the metaphysics of agency. Concrescence is interpreted in terms of relatedness. In this interpretation we are concerned only with "the relations of states of things in the actual world"-as Mr. White- head puts it. In the course of mental concrescence one is led up to 'teleological 287</page><page sequence="8">PHILOSOPHY relatedness,' which may be psychologically characterized as that mode of reflective relatedness which comprises prospective reference to an end in view. As psychologist, I entertain no doubt that such teleological relatedness there is-a very late outcome of concrescent process when the stage of reflection has been reached. As psycholo- gist, I entertain no doubt that there is, on the part of each human person, subjective aim, end in view, dominant ideal, and eventual satisfaction (if all goes well). As psychologist, however, I am content to render such scientific account as I can of those modes of related- ness which I find within this process of reflective concrescence, and of that state of affairs which is its outcome. As psychologist, I deal professedly and explicitly with C3 in my schema. I abstract from B and from A, save in so far as that which they severally comprise is 'represented' or 'symbolized' 'by way of idea'-to adopt Berkeley's phrase. But Mr. Whitehead bids us rise above such abstract treatment and embrace A, B, and C within one comprehensive synthesis. As complementary to concrescence he lays stress on creativity, with ingression of eternal objects, and with conceptual prehension by the potentially creative subject, to explain or account for the fluent actuality that we find. When I seek to follow his lead and to work things out on his lines, I am somewhat 'embrangled in difficulties.' For psychology, teleological relatedness is a very late outcome of a long process of actual concrescence. It is discussed, let us say, in terms of subjective aim and satisfaction, with prospective and retrospective reference, within a space-time frame. We then pass from psychology to metaphysics. We introduce or reinstate the category of creativity. And here also what we are said to find is, again, subjective aim and satisfaction. That which comes last in temporal process, on one highly specialized line of concrescent advance, is given metaphysical priority with eternal being as potential in the content of creative purpose. In brief, we are invited to identify teleological relatedness as concrescent with final causality as creative. Now those who have been led to believe in some agency creative and directive of the course of events in the actual world, have commonly regarded such identification as legitimate. Others have harboured grave doubts, centred perhaps in the question: Is not this too anthropomorphic? A doctrine of concrescence tends to emphasize these doubts. How so ? Take concrescence in man. There has been advance through new products towards further novelty. We reach subjective aim as psychologically interpreted. But the process of concrescence will, for long ages to come, continue its advance towards further novelty. 288</page><page sequence="9">PROFESSOR WHITEHEAD'S PHILOSOPHY What this further novelty may be the future will disclose. We cannot foretell. It may be something far 'more than' subjective aim in human mentality. If, then, we grant that in some way future novelty lies open to the all-embracing vision of that creativity which is "the producer of all that is new in concrescent advance," must not any description couched in terms of subjective aim be-as Bradley might have said-so 'infected by' psychological concrescence as to be quite inadequate as applied in the metaphysical category of the ultimate and the eternal, since it is through and through timeful with prospec- tive reference, and since, in the actual world, it is, so far as we know, applicable only to men and some few of their congeners ? In fine: if we discuss subjective aim in terms of teleological relatedness as, with its many shortcomings, the highest as yet attained in the concrescent advance of mankind, let us remember that it may, and as many believe does, fall so far short of that which has being in the ultimate category of creativity as to call for some other name by which it should be designated. I impute without hesitation subjective aim, as psychologically defined in relational terms, to human folk when they have reached a high status of concrescent mentality. But I question whether one is justified in imputing subjective aim, as thus characterized, to that mentality which Mr. Whitehead attributes to creativity. Nay, more. I question the advisability of using the word 'mentality' in the context of creativity. I should reserve it for use in the context of concrescence. And this, not because I deny to creativity the potentiality of producing all the novelty that we find in the course of concrescent advance, including new stages of mentality, but because I doubt whether the promise and potency of concrescent mentality necessarily implies mentality as an attribute of creativity itself in the category of the ultimate. In brief, and in terms of my A, B, C, I distinguish concrescent mentality in C from creative activity in A, and do not transfer that which characterizes C to A or that which characterizes A to C. I regard subjective aim as characterizing C3. And, unless it be radically re-defined, say in terms which Mr. Whitehead designates 'conceptual,' its transference to A seems to me to annul the dis- tinction between C and A. V From the psychological standpoint subjective aim falls under my heading C3. But in the metaphysics of creativity that to which Mr. Whitehead gives the same name is objectified at all stages of concrescence. I pass now to C2 at the perceptive level of mentality. And in 289</page><page sequence="10">PHILOSOPHY this section I try to keep within the closed system of C in abstraction from that of B (physical) and that of A (metaphysical). If I may use the word 'idea' in the wide Lockian sense, then, for me, all mental reference in perception is to ideas. Following Berkeley, I say that what is perceived is in mind 'by way of idea,' as distin- guished from that which is in mind 'by way of attribute,' or (as I should say) by way of feeling. I use the word 'feeling' here in a restricted C-sense. Moreover, I speak of 'reference to' ideas, and of 'awareness in' feeling. It may be said that this 'reference to' is what others name 'apprehension of.' Psychologically this is not so. That to which there is psychological reference is some idea in mind. That of which there is said to be direct apprehension-with stress on the word 'direct'-is some physical thing or event. On these terms, since that which is thus apprehended in perception is physical, one steps outside the closed system of mind; and since apprehending is mental, one steps outside the closed system of physics. We thus reach a parting of the philosophical ways. Briefly stated in its historical setting the question long ago arose: Do perceptive ideas exactly resemble or do they only serve to represent what in either case we speak of as the 'sensible qualities' of things in the external world? Locke replied: Some are resemblant and some are not. Thus he drew, or accepted, a distinction between 'primary' and 'secondary' qualities. Then came Berkeley. This distinction, he said, is invalid; all perceptive ideas are representative only. Hume followed suit. Enter Reid. Not representative only, he says; resem- blant in all those ways in which common sense assures us that they are so. An old story this, but still a live issue. In more modern setting, and in terms of closed systems, the question is: Are our minds as perceptive so clean up against things in the external world as to justify the belief that colours, shapes, distances from us, and so forth, are directly apprehended? If so, since resemblance is merged in identity, it follows that these 'qualities' are what they are, and as they are, within B, whether they are apprehended by someone or not. This in effect takes us back to common-sense Reid. The alternative belief takes us back a step farther to Hume. There lies the parting of the ways. It should be remembered, however, that to account for all so-called 'qualities' Mr. Whitehead postulates (under my heading A) eternal objects which are in such wise ingressive into actual entities as to give 'subjective form' to the 'conceptual prehension' of colours and shapes and distances. Herein lies the metaphysical pivot of his thesis. But just now this does not come within the psychological scope of this section. Let me, then, revert to Thomas Reid. He relies on the assurance 290</page><page sequence="11">PROFESSOR WHITEHEAD'S PHILOSOPHY of common sense. This assurance he speaks of as 'instinctive.' His commentator, Hamilton, substitutes the word 'intuitive.' Here the psychologist has something to say, since intuition for him implies a mental process and its product. I take as an instance of perception the naive location of an object just there in that which we reflectively interpret as spatial relatedness to other neighbouring objects and to the body of him that perceives. Have we an intuition of visual 'thereness' ? Has a month-old infant a like intuition? I suppose that most of us would reply that in some sense he has. But in what sense? Some would say: In the sense that so to perceive an object is 'originally' given in the very nature of mind. I should say: Only in a 'derivative' sense as that which is acquired in the course of individual experience. There are, I should say, two modes of sentient 'awareness in feeling' when there is reference by way of idea to an object as 'there' for visual perception, namely, (i) awareness in retinal sensing, and (ii) awareness in behaving, as the gaze is directed towards and focussed on the object. These two sets of feelings combine when anything is perceived as 'out there.' So too in all 'active touch,' tactual feelings and motor feelings similarly combine. Furthermore, as Berkeley showed, 'active sight' and 'active touch' normally combine in richer perceptive synthesis. Hence reference to spatial position is not original (nativistic) but acquired. It arises in the course of individual experience as a new product of associative concrescence and gives perceptive 'fore-experience' of spatial there- ness on each 'now-occasion' as it comes in the normal life of perception. Of this new product of associative concrescence one may say, as Professor H6ffding (interpreting James Mill) said thirty years ago: "Several ideas and feelings may enter into so intimate a union with one another as to become inseparable, while the new totality, thus formed, possesses qualities which are not possessed by any of its parts." And he adds that the new totality can 'become' what James Mill spoke of as 'a substantive principle of human nature.' Of like concrescent origin, as I believe, are all forms of common-sense intuition in the perceptive field of reference. One and all are deriva- tive and individually acquired. I lay stress on the perceptive field because in the reflective field, as interpreted by modern physics, we have far outrun the range of common-sense intuition. In this field every step in advance takes us farther from resemblance towards that mathematical symbolism which is the reflective form of representation. Here the plain man finds much that runs counter to the cherished 'intuitions' of common sense. Only when we come back to the platform of everyday life in naive perception is he bidden still to accept direct apprehension as 29I</page><page sequence="12">PHILOSOPHY part of his philosophical creed on the sufficient evidence of common sense-to tread the path of Thomas Reid and not that of David Hume. VI Whether one elects to tread this path or that in the world of daily acquaintance, one is faced by questions with respect to the characterizing features of this naive perceptive acquaintance. On these characterizing features Mr. Whitehead has a good deal to say. In approaching them as psychological commentator, let me go back to Hume, brought up to date by those who have followed his lead. He was predominantly, but not only, concerned with what Mr. Whitehead speaks of as 'presentational immediacy,' as this is given through the traditional five senses, by which, as Locke had supposed, ideas are in some way 'conveyed in' to the mind. But Mr. Whitehead contends that this is not the whole story. There is also 'causal efficacy'. This, he says, "is not that sort of perception which has received most attention in the philosophical tradition. Philosophers," he tells us, "have disdained the information about the universe obtained through these visceral feelings and have con- centrated attention on visual feelings." Here the word 'feelings' is used in that widely extended sense which enables them to play a part in the system of physics. Thus used, Mr. Whitehead can apply to feelings the professedly physical notion of 'vector character.' I use the word 'feelings' in a psycho- logical sense to name modes of mental awareness in experiencing. But, for Mr. Whitehead, causal efficacy goes deeper. It emphasizes 'conceptual prehension.' It must be taken in the light of 'subjective form' and 'subjective aim' in the ultimate category of creativity. There let us leave them for a while and revert to psychological treatment. When an infant's gaze turns, soon after his birth, to a softly illuminated patch in the visual field, I impute to him awareness in so behaving 'with the eyes.' And when a flash makes me blink, I am aware in thus behaving 'with the eyelids.' This leads one to distinguish a factor in experience which we may name 'motor feeling' as concomitant with behaving. Thus we have sensory feelings in seeing with the retina, and motor feelings in behaving (accommodating and focussing) with the muscles within and around the eyeballs. These, as was shown in the foregoing section, may perceptively combine. But when a vivid flash of lightning makes me blink, my whole body is more or less affected-heart-beat, respiration, alimentary system, glandular system, and the rest. Let us speak of all this as accompanied by 'visceral feeling,' which, at the perceptive level, shall include all feeling that is other than sensory and other than 292</page><page sequence="13">PROFESSOR WHITEHEAD'S PHILOSOPHY motor. It will include, for example, the sensory feeling one has when one cries 'with the lachrymal glands.' Rather loosely, but to subserve the purpose in hand, one may label all such feelings of visceral origin 'emotional.' On these terms we can distinguish 'feelings' of three kinds: say, visual, visceral, and motor. And we may say that data are thus afforded for three modes of perception: 'presentational,' 'emotional,' and (let me say) 'behavioural.' I think Mr. Whitehead might agree that they may so combine in associative concrescence as to con- stitute what Professor Hoffding speaks of as 'a new totality' with unforeseen novelty in individual experience. Apart from this, let us now turn to what Mr. Whitehead says with respect to the first two. He urges that "the whole notion of prehension should be inverted. We prehend other actual entities," he says, "more primatively by direct mediation of emotional tone, and only secondarily and waveringly by direct mediation of sense." But we have also to reckon with the third mode of prehension- that by mediation of 'causal efficacy.' Taking this in the sense of psychological 'mediacy' in motor feelings, and waiving the question which of the three should, in this context, be regarded as primary, secondary, or tertiary, I can come into line with Mr. Whitehead in so far as I, too, believe that, at the perceptive stage of mental concrescence, there is a complex datum derivative in its character as a totality from sense-feelings, visceral feelings, and motor feelings. That is what I should mean by speaking with Hume of seeing 'with the eyes,' or, more generally, of perceiving 'with the body.' It is with the whole body-with concomitant events, sensory, visceral, and motor, in that body-that we perceive in all three 'modes of mediacy.' A question here arises, however, with respect to the meaning to be attached to the words 'with the body.' For me the meaning is that mental 'feelings and ideas' are always 'concomitant' with physical and physiological events 'in the body.' This and no more. But is this what Mr. Whitehead means when he uses these words? It is not, as I understand, all that he means. From the metaphysical standpoint of creative agency in the realm of potential reality they are used with that 'conceptual' implication which Mr. Whitehead invites us to attach to 'subject' and 'superject' in the category of the ultimate. In all prehension we have to reckon not only with some concrescent organism, as actual, but with the whole realm of potential reality therein objectified. Here the words 'with the body' are used in an instrumental sense-as concrescent means to the attain- ment of that conceptual end which is the subjective aim of creativity. I revert now to that more mundane sense of the words 'with the body' in which they mean 'concomitant with events in the body.' Then it is with the whole body, comprising events, sensory, visceral, u 293</page><page sequence="14">PHILOSOPHY and motor, in that body that we, and many animals, perceive in three modes which are analytically distinguishable, though they normally combine in associative synthesis. When, however, we pass to 'physical prehension' far below the level of perception-from the case, let us say, of my prehending 'with my body' to that of an atom's prehending 'with its body'- I must call a halt. In its body there is, I submit, no such differen- tiation as to lend countenance to the belief that a like differentiation of sense-feeling, visceral feeling, and motor feeling has appeared on the scene in the course of concrescent advance. If perceptive apprehension, under my heading C2, has origin through associative concrescence, and if it implies the differentiation of sensory, visceral, and motor factors in sentience, under Ci, I find grave psychological difficulties in accepting a doctrine of 'physical prehension' so universal in its range as to be applicable to crystals, to molecules, to atoms, to electrons-in a word, to all 'sub-living' organisms-in which no differentiation of like factors obtains. Even in the amceba such differentiation seems to be only hazily incipient. VII In Process and Reality Mr. Whitehead essays the difficult task of combining in one philosophical synthesis concrescent novelty, as actual and temporal, with causal creativity, as potential and eternal. He has in many ways thrown new light from fresh points of view on an old problem. For this all serious thinkers are deeply indebted to him; and among them those whose province it is to deal in psychological terms with the mentality of organisms. To some few living organisms-the very few that have reached the reflective level of mentality-they impute subjective aim (as they characterize it) with prospective reference, and in due course some measure of reflective satisfaction if the outcome accords with the precedent aim. Any psychological interpretation of such procedure demands full recognition of time-reference. If the time- factor be eliminated, one can make no headwayin such interpretation. But when we turn to metaphysical explanation sub quadam specie aeternitatis, are we not bidden wholly to eliminate this time-factor ? Can we then discuss potential creativity in the same terminology as that which we employ in interpreting actual concrescence at successive stages of human mentality, infantile and adult ? It may be that the conditions of the problem are such as to render any psychological interpretation of causal creativity impossible. If that be so, why not say frankly: The terminology here used in discussing the metaphysical problem must be completely divested of all its merely psychological meaning? 294</page></plain_text>
