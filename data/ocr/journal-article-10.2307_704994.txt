<plain_text><page sequence="1">MY note on Valerius Flaccus assumed as common ground that familiar con- ception of the humid lower air which Professor Campbell so learnedly elabor- ates, and I am surprised that my Comus quotation alone did not make this plain. My suggestion was simply that Valerius sought to freshen this commonplace by a loan from the distinct but not incon- sistent conception of Earth, as Heaven's bride, longing to be impregnated by rain. I did not, of course, think that Valerius prayed to escape from the dis- comforts of a dry summer. I meant 'auenti' for a description of Earth's permanent feelings. Rain, which im- plies cloud, is essential to her fertility, and she cannot long be happy without it, so that only by escape to a higher clime can the poet find clear air, save as a brief and uneasy interlude. My suggestion that it is an advantage to be able to take 'auenti' cdro' KOWoU with 'populis' does not conflict with the obvious fact that Valerius here con- trasts himself as a poet with the mass of mankind (not with the mob-it is 'populis', not 'populo'-but with all the nations of the earth). On the con- trary it sharpens the point of this con- trast, for it is a reminder that all human beings, unless miraculously emanci- pated, depend for their existence on that fertility of earth which itself de- pends on clouds and rain. Professor Campbell quarrels with my last sentence 'What is Earth's desire for rain but the projection of man's own inescapable need? ', but, since he goes on to say 'it is man's anthropo- morphic way of describing Earth's need', I think this is chiefly a matter of phraseology. My point was that the attribution to Earth of a desire or even a need for rain is pure anthropomorph- ism. Unless Earth is personified, the production of vegetation is no advan- tage to her: it is man, not she, that desires and needs rain and its effects. I have no objection to the reading 'alenti', which I called 'attractive', but this is at least not the only way of describing earth's relation to the clouds. ertLV avupc7ToLS aVe/LWV a67E 7AELta XP9ts" OTtV a o3paLvtwv ;dwcov o/lgptWcv 7ataov veoeCas.

THE repetition of av offended Herwerden (who bracketed the second cv), but both words are re- tained by the editors, who have no difficulty in quoting parallels for the double use both in Thucydides (i. 76. 4, 77. 6, 136. 4, &amp;c.) and in other writers. Yet a slight change is perhaps necessary on other grounds which disposes of the first av.

(Steup, after the Scholia, takes the words to be masculine with ToZs u-Fgrato a dative of advantage, which is unbelievable between two neuter instrumental datives; this construction also contradicts Thucydides' usage as shown, e.g., in i. 145.)
