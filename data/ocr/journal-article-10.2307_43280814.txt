Hatemi and Rose McDermott. Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 2011. 352p. $80.00 cloth, $27.50 paper. Peter K. Hatemi and Rose McDermott's Man Is by Nature a Political Animalbimgs together some of the most important social scientists working at the intersection of political science, psychology, biology, and cognitive neuroscience. Given recent advances in cognitive neuroscience and given the proliferation of work in political science that draws on these advances, we have decided to invite a range of political scientists to comment on the promise and the limits of this line of inquiry. What can scientific developments in psychology, biology, and neuroscience tell us about "human nature"? Can these discourses reckon with the variation in time and space that has traditionally been at the heart of political science, perhaps even going back to the classic text from which Hatemi and McDermott derive their title, Aristotle's Politics ? - Jeffrey C. Isaac, Editor C. Fred Alford doi:1 0.1 01 7/S1 53759271 30001 82 It is difficult to know how to review an edited volume, especially one that claims to represent an emerging field. Does one review the most intriguing of the 10 field- defining articles, or does one focus on the editorial approach to the emerging field of evolutionary biopoli- tics? The latter approach has been chosen here, one which requires a stipulation. While I have difficulties with the editors' approach to the field, there can be little doubt that it is one that political science ignores at its peril. The question is whether political scientists will have any idea how to integrate its insights. To use it is not only to know its findings but also to theorize what it means to say that man is a political animal in the sense the editors intend, which is not Aristotle's. In this regard, the editors are not as helpful as they might have been. One might argue that it is too early to integrate the insights of the field, and perhaps that is so, but it is not too early to start thinking about it. C. Fred Alford is Professor of Government at the University of Marylandy College Park (calford@umd.edu). One wishes that a, volume that sets itself the task of defining a field had been a little more sophisticated about both the philosophy of science it invokes on its behalf and the classics its contributors criticize. The subjects of these complaints will be considered in turn, but first a com- ment on the genre. For a number of years, when I was still teaching the scope and method of political study to grad- uate students, I assigned Frans de Waal's (2007) Chimpan- zee PoliticSy a fascinating account of the social life of chimpanzees and bonobos, the smaller of the two species of great apes. A single chapter from de Waal's account, filled with stories illustrating the empathie capacity and limits of the bonobo, perhaps the most sympathetic of the apes, was more captivating than any chapter in the book under review. There is a reason, of course, and much of the blame falls upon the genre. Although there are many illustrations of the evolutionary approach, and a chapter devoted to primates, much of the time and attention of the contributing authors is spent explaining "here is how and why this approach is important to political science." It may be true, but it does not always make for the most fascinating reading. First, a couple of issues that fall broadly under the cat- egory of philosophy of science deserve scrutiny. The edi- tors argue that an advantage of the biological approach is Â©American Political Science Association 2013 June 2013 | Vol. 11 /No. 2 549</page><page sequence="2">Review Symposium | Politics and Biology that it may provide an "ontological" foundation for ratio- nal actor models, which currently lack such support (p. 4). True enough, but ontology is no more the realm of sci- ence than is metaphysics, of which it is an instance. Ontol- ogy belongs to the realm of metaphysics, rhe study of the categories of being that may be said to be fundamental. I had thought it was only in political theory that ontology had become a fancy word for empirical; evidently not. It is, however, worth remembering what it is that biology (or any other genuine social science) is able to provide: state- ments about the world that may be shown false, and thus have cognitive content (Popper 2002). It will be a long time before such statements provide us a firm foundation for anything. Indeed, that is probably not what we should be looking for. We should be looking for our old para- digms (that most frequently cited term in the social sci- ences) to be overcome by new knowledge, not to be grounded by them. Likely the greatest contribution of the new science of human evolutionary biology will be in telling us when we are wrong, not when we are right. Certainly, the editors are correct that the charge of "reductionism" directed against a scientific social science, especially one that draws on units of explanation smaller than the individual, such as neurobiology, is specious (p. 8). However, it is worth being clear about what reductionism involves. Reductionism is a commitment of empiricism. It stands as an objection to holism, the claim that groups (whether the group is one of cells constituting the indi- vidual or one of individuals) possess emergent properties inexplicable by laws governing the relationships among the relevant individual properties, or by any composition laws that explain what happens when groups of cells dr individuals come together. Holism almost always pos- sesses a mystical quality, and is rightly rejected by empir- icists (Brodbeck 1958). The issue the editors seem to be struggling with under the mistaken heading of reductionism is actually the much more subtle one of what constitutes an explanation. In the end, the answer must be "that which satisfies." The prob- lem, at least as I see it, is that some neurobiological expla- nations fail to satisfy. Even when we are convinced of the truth of facts, such as that in stable hierarchies, high-level males have lower Cortisol levels (a biological marker of stress) than lower-status ones, there is something about this expla- nation that just fails to satisfy (p. 254). Is it because it is about baboons and not men? Is it because so much neuro- biological research, unlike evolutionary research, seems to have the quality of barefoot empiricism, that is, lots of inter- esting facts but no theory (not even a borrowed theory, as rational choice theorists borrowed a theory from microeco- nomics) to hang them on? Certainly this is part of it, but for many there will always be an experiential disconnect between hormones and our felt experiences of politics. For example, in one study, a small number of male political partisans were asked to chew gum so that the testosterone in their saliva could be measured as CNN reported the election results in 2008. Those parti- sans who supported Barack Obama had increased testos- terone levels, while John McCain supporters had decreased levels (pp. 261-72). What makes this an unsatisfying study, if indeed you find it unsatisfying, as I do? One might argue that it is an intriguing fact isolated from theory. The other possibility, which is not clearly distinct, is that there is some- thing about the human experience of politics that will never feel adequately explained by testosterone levels, even in the presence of a theory linking these levels to macro-level phe- nomena. This, however, remains an open question. It may well be that within a generation, explanations of voter pref- erences in terms of hormones will be as well accepted as explanations of depression in terms of a chemical imbal- ance in the brain. What people find satisfying is cultural, not timeless. It will, in any case, require a theory that is a deductively interrelated set of propositions that make interesting and unexpected predictions, that is, which have cognitive con- tent. Those who want to do social science should be held to the standards of science. This means that they should make interesting predictions about something important that can be shown wrong, and that these predictions should serve to increase our confidence in a larger theory about how the world of voting, or whatever, works. At least this is what I learned from Karl Popper, and it seems worth remembering that the goal is not the apparatus and appear- ance of science but bold conjectures and rigorous refuta- tions about the world. One chapter, "The Mind-Body Connection," tells you how to set up your own biophys- iology laboratory for twenty thousand dollars. But first, you ought to know what you want to do with it besides get a grant (pp. 231, 243). A second issue open to criticism is the editors' treat- ment of the classics. The classics do not deserve our respect because they are old and venerable. The respect they deserve is to be understood. The editors say (p. 19) that Arisototles "virtue," Rousseau's "social contract," Hobbes's Levi- athan, or Maslow's "hierarchy of needs," to name a few . . . pro- vide an almost arbitrary account of human nature. They lack a unifying theory for why these various needs and desires exist, or how they might be connected to one another. Whatever else one may say about Aristotle's account of virtue ( arete , dperrj), one can hardly claim that it lacks a unifying account of why virtue exists or should exist and how it fits into the larger scheme of things. One might not agree with Aristotle, but his argument runs something like this: Humans seek to be happy ( eudaimon ). This is not just a human characteristic but part of the goal- oriented, or teleological, structure of the universe. Unfor- tunately, humans are not very good at seeking their own happiness, tending toward excess, occasionally toward defi- ciency. In their upbringing, it is terribly important to 550 Perspectives on Politics</page><page sequence="3">develop the good habit of seeking the mean between excess and deficiency. Eventually this habit will become part of a noble character, and this noble character will seek its telos, (or goal) as efficiently as possible. Such a character can be called virtuous when seeking the mean has become pleas- ant. In developing this argument, Aristotle lays out the education most likely to develop good character, the sub- ject of his Nichomachean Ethics, and the polity, or political order, most likely to support good character among its citizens, the subject of his Politics. In other works such as the Poetics , he discusses the art most likely to develop good character, as well as the risks life poses to it. In his Metaphysics , he locates his account of the good for man within an account of the larger cosmological order. What- ever else Aristotle fails to do, he does not "lack a unifying theory." I could make a similar argument about Hobbes or Rousseau, but doing so is unnecessary. What the editors seem to mean with the claim that Aristotle, among other classic authors, lacks a unifying theory of human needs and desires is that Aristotle fails to approach "human preference structures" from a "biologi- cal and evolutionary perspective that incorporates our past development and immediate ancestry as precursors to explaining our current political preferences" (p. 19). Although one might argue that Aristotle had his own (by now outmoded) biological and evolutionary perspective, the simplest thing to say is that the classics did not approach politics as the contributors to this book do. True enough, but we know this. There is no need to trivialize and dis- miss the classics, from which we learn something quite different, in order to claim that modern biology and evo- lution have a contribution to make. This is particularly ironic in a book whose title is drawn from an empirical claim made by Aristotle, an empirical claim that is by no means given, an empirical claim that is by no means settled by the studies in this book. It might be worthwhile, amid all the empirical data gathering, to reflect about what it means for humans to be political animals. In the end, this is where the editors let us down most. Evolutionary biology is not just a field. If it is to be taken seriously in the long run, it will lead to a set of claims about how the social world is put together. The claims would run something like the following. The claim that man is a political animal is not the same as saying that man is a social animal, as Hannah Arendt ( The Human Condition &gt; 1958) reminds us. To be a polit- ical animal, one concludes from reading Hatemi and McDermott s volume, is to be homo hierarchicus. In one way or another, most of the chapters in the volume, par- ticularly those on evolution and politics, but also the chap- ter on "Hormones and Politics," are concerned with the forces that work to maintain stable hierarchies, from fam- ilies to nations. These forces seem to run deeper than previously imagined, but not so deep that they cannot be upset. Everything that was explained in books employing "environmental" models, such as Ted Gurr s (201 1) classic Why Men Rebel, remains to be explained and enriched by evolutionary and neurobiological models. As the editors rightly point out at the beginning, there is no inherent conflict between these approaches (p. 3). The state of the field, as represented by the book under review, can best be defined as driven by methodology and instrumentation, resulting in interesting but isolated empir- ical observations. Against this claim it might be argued that these "isolated empirical observations" are not iso- lated at all, but come together to form the field of evolu- tionary biopolitics. But a field is not a substitute for a theory, or the fields of psychoanalysis and art appreciation would be hard sciences. Perhaps this way of putting it is too demanding, but an undertaking that claims to be a science should be judged like one. Sound empirical data exist for someone to begin to turn the volumes field of study into a theory. The work begs to be done, and from the results presented here it is almost time.

Hatemi and Rose McDermott s edited volume is deceptively pithy. The clever turn of phrase (not discussed in the text) hints at the volumes underlying conclusion, that political science has overlooked the biological and evolutionary bases of many political behaviors. Yet "man is by nature a political animal" is in fact the start of a much more complex exploration of Aristo tie s understand- ing of animals, politics, and nature. It opens up an explo- ration of his teleological view of nature that underpins a view of human nature that, while acknowledging the bio- logical nature of human beings, is hardly a parismonious model for explaining the political world. For this reason - the complexity under the surface of a seemingly simple claim - the quotation may be a perfect description of the text itself. As a political theorist, I acknowledge that I am woefully underqualified to examine most of the scientific claims contained in the text. Consequently, my discussion focuses on two important debates within which this text must be read. One is an ongoing debate about the philosophy of (social) science within the field of political science and the utility of the models imported from the biological sci- ences. The second is an equally important consideration of the normative implications of models of human nature, in particular looking to materialist, biological models. To begin, I consider the ways that these debates are already ongoing both within the field of political science and in interdisciplinary discussions about man as a political ani- mal, considering both the import of the animal model and the role of politics. While debates over epistemology and ontology and, in particular, the science in political science are hardly new, they got new attention in two quite different editorials appearing in the New York Times in 2012, both debating the scientific merits of the field. Jacqueline Stevens sug- gested that the study of politics fails to rise to the level of a science according to positivist requirements, yielding few adequately predictive hypotheses. Kevin A. Clarke and David M. Primo argued that political science suffers from "physics envy," a misperception about the nature of science itself: "The ideal of hypothetico-deductivism is flawed for many reasons. For one thing, its not even a good description of how the 'hard' sciences work. It s a high school textbook version of science, with everything messy and chaotic about scientific inquiry safely ignored" ("Overcoming 'Physics Envy,'" New York Times, 1 April 2012, SR9). Claire Rasmussen is Associate Professor of Political Science and International Relations at the University of Delaware. In their volume s first chapter, Hatemi and McDermott place the text in relationship to what they see as the two primary explanatory theories in political science, behav- ioralism and rational choice, which they describe as envi- ronmental theories, placing an emphasis on changing behaviors as a consequence of socialization or incentive structures outside of the individual: "Such models, while useful in their own environmental or cultural domains, tell only a portion of the 'human story. None directly incorporate the innate part of the equation regarding human biological development: that is, why humans devel- oped as they have, and how their political preferences and social actions may be decisively influenced by their bio- logical needs and drives" (p. 19). This focus on innate biological impulse, by identifying generalizable patterns based in biology, whether neurosci- ence, evolutionary science, endocrinology, or genetics, frames the goal of the book, in a search for explanations for human behavior that the authors insist supplement rather than replace traditional political science models. The goal of subsequent chapters is to explore the biolog- ical explanations for human behavior, ranging from evo- lutionary adaptation and hormonal levels to the genetic transmission of traits. The purpose of the research is, of course, to discover a biological rationality at work within human political behavior, seeking universal patterns with explanatory powers across the species. Ultimately, the goal is a greater predictive power yielded by greater understand- ing of the causal processes: "If a significant portion of individual variation in behavior is explained by non- environmental influences, then our current models are limited in their ability to accurately predict political behav- ior" (p. 18). In many ways, the text demonstrates Clarke and Pri- mos claims about the operation of "real science." In spite of the search for parsimonious and universalizable claims, many of the chapters present discussions that emphasize the sorts of complexity and indeterminacy that we often think of as characterizing the political world. For instance, Darren Schreibers analysis of the neuroscience of con- scious and unconscious attitude formation about race demonstrates the complexity of interactions between envi- ronmental and biological influences (p. 285). This com- plexity does not undermine the research but highlights the ways in which scientific inquiry does not always lend itself to parsimony. For example, Evan Charney s critique of the use of the explanatory power of genetics in polit- ical preference formation highlights the ways that genetic expression is itself a complex process of biological/ environmental interaction.1 This reading of the role of biology in politics suggests that political science has much to learn substantively and philosophically from the model of the biological sciences. Of course, this insight is already operative in many of the other social sciences where the natural sciences often comingle with social science and 552 Perspectives on Politics</page><page sequence="5">social theory, as in anthropology and geography. Indeed, political theorists have recently devoted significant atten- tion to the intersection of politics and biology, engaging with insights from neuroscience, biology, genetics, and chemistry.2 For a political theorist, the discussion of the nature of human life is a familiar question with normative over- tones, a fact recognized by the editors. They acknowledge concerns about the reductive nature of scientific inquiry, and the specific worry about reducing human behavior to immutable natural causes. They assert that their analysis retains a role for human agency since "humans remain the only species whose understanding of ourselves allows us to change our own evolutionary trajectory and in so doing exhibit the ability to globally change our environment" (p. 8). This analysis reflects the political importance of any theory of human nature since, clearly, that understand- ing plays a role in policy formation and the treatment of humans (and other animals). Indeed, Hatemi and McDer- mott dismiss many of the most famous theoretical con- structions of human nature in classic works by Aristotle, Rousseau, and Hobbes as providing "an almost arbitrary account of human nature" (p. 19). Of course, critics of these accounts charge that they, like any accounts of human nature, are neither arbitrary nor neutral. Indeed, these authors understanding of human nature provides a justificatory edifice for their concep- tions of the political universe, demonstrating that the stakes are high in any theory of human nature. In particular, while authors like Rousseau describe their theories of human nature as "setting aside all facts," the grounding of human nature in the presumed neutrality of science neces- sitates particular scrutiny as it has significant normative consequences. In the volumes Forward, James Druckman notes that biological approaches have often been tied to conservative ideologies, though he correctly recognizes that political consequences "[are] more complex and domain specific" (p. xi). As he notes, biological explanations of sexual ori- entations are often utilized as a legal and political founda- tion for gay rights. However, concerns about conservatism go beyond his aside that "biological approaches often priv- ilege individual actions and responsibility rather than social situations" (p. xi). Indeed, there is much in the history of the intersection of biology and politics that should at least alert us to the normative concerns at work. While biology itself may have no inherent political lean- ings, the accusation of conservatism may emerge in part from the historical experience of the deployment of sci- ence to conserve the status quo, in particular in reinforc- ing hierarchies of power. The history of scientific racism demonstrates the ways in which science, and in particular the field of biology, was central to the development of ideas that justified inequality.3 Feminist scholars have exam- ined the ways not only that the presumed neutrality of science contributed to gender and racial inequality in jus- tifying differential treatment of certain groups but also that those unchallenged presumptions about gender and race provided an unconscious lens through which scien- tific observations and data were seen.4 In addition, political theorists have discussed the ways in which the reduction of human beings to their biologi- cal selves can have troubling consequences. Many histor- ians have documented the ways in which comparisons with animals have been a common means of stigmatizing groups. Giorgio Agamben s Homo Sacer (1998) argues that the reduction of certain groups of human beings to bare life or mere life ( homo sacer), as opposed to subjects of the law, enables their mistreatment or killing. The defining feature of "bare life" is the ability to "be killed without sacrifice," to be reduced to the status of an animal. For Agamben, the prototype of this reduction is the modern concentration camp, the ultimate site of dehumanization. Certainly, we need not posit that biological approaches lead to genocide in order to recognize that the theoretical concerns about the consequences of specific views of human nature certainly have historical precedent and that these concerns warrant attention. Comparisons or equivalences between humans and animals have often justified human atrocities. Even more famously, Hannah Arendt argued in The Human Condition ( [1958] 1998) that a reduction of human beings to the material realm of necessity threat- ened the possibility of human agency, the possibility to act on and change the world. On the flip side of these normative concerns about dehumanization is a literature that argues for the ethical possibilities opened up by the new engagement with biol- ogy and, in particular, its decentering of human excep- tionalism. Certainly, scholars in animal studies would embrace the biological approach that suggests humans exist on a continuum with other animals. Indeed, Darby Proc- tor and Sarah Brosnans chapter, "Political Primates: What Other Primates Can Tell Us about the Evolutionary Roots of Our Own Political Behavior," begins with an observa- tion of male- male aggression reminiscent of chimps but that is revealed to be the Bolivian congress, a move that echoes some of the literature arguing for a revived consid- eration of whether humans are unique in being political animals. Much cross-disciplinary work has been done bring- ing together scholars in the natural sciences, humanities, and social sciences examining our understanding of the relationship among humans, animals, and the natural world, suggesting that the turn to biology, instinct, and innate capability need not be a dead end for the politics of human nature but may provide opportunities for political theorists to return to their concepts anew. Undermining the insights of humanism that underpin arguments for human rights, democracy, and equality is certainly cause for concern, but such a critique of humanism also pro- vides new opportunities for considering the relationship June 2013 | Vol. 11 /No. 2 553</page><page sequence="6">Review Symposium | Politics and Biology between humans and animals and between nature and culture.5 The editors of this volume argue for a greater consid- eration of the relationship between politics and biology, strengthening the cross-pollination between science and politics. While emphasizing the role of biological rather than environmental influences would seem to undermine the place of theory within the discipline, it may in fact do the opposite. Theorists have already been engaged with many of the epistemological and normative questions that are raised by the call for a greater consideration of the biological, including the kinds of transdisciplinary schol- arship called for by the editors. Perhaps most significantly, the emphasis on human nature invites a deeper consider- ation of implications of a materialist paradigm of politics. As the volume suggests, the biology of politics may be an invitation to complexity rather than a new, simpler view of political life.

This edited volume responds with an emphatic "Both/And!" (pp. 1, 3, 17, 101, 154, 188, 201-2, 301-2). Yes, our evolutionary inheritance, genetic composition, and neurological structures significantly impact our sociopolitical attitudes, beliefs, values, and behav- iors. And yes, the cultural environment affects the way human nature unfolds, triggering genetic expression, elic- iting physiological disposition, and likely influencing their evolution. This interaction of nature and culture, biology and environment, editors and contributors maintain, pro- vides one of the most promising, interesting, and under- exploited fields of inquiry for political scientists today. To this interactionist endorsement the editors add a warning. Political scientists do their profession a great dis- service if they refuse to integrate insights from the life sciences. The discipline will become a biologically illiter- ate child scorned by its faster maturing social science sib- lings. There is a moral lapse involved as well, the editors assert, if political scientists do not investigate in transpar- ent fashion and in accord with scientific standards the biological influences on human behavior that governmen- tal and corporate actors are already exploiting - potentially for nefarious purposes. I embrace the endorsement and the accompanying warn- ing. Political scientists have much to learn from, and to contribute to, the life sciences. But there are notable absences in the volume that diminish its contribution to the field, narrow its range of interest, and weaken its nor- mative position. Notwithstanding the oblique reference to Aristotle in its title, the volume accords the ancient philosopher only a single, passing remark. No entry for Aristotle exists in the index, and he fails to appear in any reference sections. There are likely two reasons for this omission. The first reflects on discoveries in evolutionary biology and neuro- science and will be addressed in the final paragraphs of this review. The second is the common perception that science, as a cumulative and progressive intellectual enter- prise, has long ago left its early practitioners behind. Just as physicists and zoologists no longer study Aristotle, not- withstanding his seminal contributions to these fields, so political scientists - especially those courting the "harder" sciences - might deem it a sign of immaturity to dwell upon intellectual ancestors. A polite bow suffices. Whatever the reason, the omission is unfortunate. And it is symptomatic of a larger problem. No chapters address Leslie Paul Thiele teaches political theory in the Depart- ment of Political Science and is Director of Sustainability Studies at the University of Florida. political philosophy or theory. This weakens the volume in at least four ways. First, the editors' assertion that political scientists have an ethical obligation to explore the biology of human behavior is left wholly unsubstantiated. Some fleshing out of the claim would be in order, and the likely candidate for the job is a political theorist. Second, the volume would have benefited from the replacement of any of its many chapters detailing how political scientists can utilize bio- logical knowledge with at least one account of how bio- logical scientists utilize philosophical knowledge. There is no shortage of material here. Some of the most influential neuroscience in recent years, for example, has been grounded on the same philosophic writings that occupy political theorists.1 Third, the editors might have included a chapter that summarizes natural scientific Â¿/Â¿confirmations of political thought. For example, Antonio Damasio, a neuroscien- tist, has employed extensive empirical data to disconfirm Descartess famous mind-body dualism in Descartes' Error (1994). There are important ramifications of this discon- firmation for political philosophy and political science. In turn, Steven Pinker, an experimental psychologist, has recently demonstrated that Thomas Hobbes was right and Jean-Jacques Rousseau was wrong regarding at least one key point of disagreement between them. Hobbes famously declared that the state of nature was a state of war of all against all, making our ancestors' lives "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short." In contrast, Rous- seau insisted that the noble savage seldom knew conflict. His (simple) needs were easily sated in the state of nature, and so there was no reason to battle over resources. Pinker demonstrates that violence was standard fare for early humankind, but that it has markedly decreased over time. Contradicting popular claims of the unprecedented level of violence of the twentieth century - with its two world wars, multiple regional wars, and totalitarian decimations - Pinker observes in The Better Angels of Our Nature that on a per capita basis, humankind is ever more peaceful.2 Not- withstanding isolated periods with high levels of murder and organized conflict, the overall trend is clear: Our spe- cies is becoming increasingly nonviolent as a product of its ever more civil(ized) existence. The life sciences help explain why. The fourth absence is, to my mind, the most problem- atic. The volume is dedicated to exploring the ways in which political phenomena are shaped by our inner (genetic, evo- lutionary, and neurological) nature. Unfortunately, it neglects a two millennia-old tradition of examining our inner nature and how it is shaped by political phenomena. Plato was only the first of a long line of philosophers to explore the politics of the soul Soulcraft and statecraft were inherently related, Plato insisted, because the soul itself was a polis of sorts. In the Republky Socrates declares that the man of wisdom chiefly minds the "constitution" not of his country but of his soul, June 2013 I Vol. 11 /No. 2 555</page><page sequence="8">Review Symposium | Politics and Biology the city-state within himself.3 The relationship between state- craft and soulcraft has been an enduring concern for polit- ical theorists ever since. Even philosophers who vehemently reject Plato's idealism, such as Friedrich Nietzsche, have focused on the dynamics of our inner politics - a multi- plicity of competing drives, each vying for hegemony.4 Unfortunately, this volume offers no investigations of the ways our inner constitutions are formed, or how they get amended. To address this unfortunate lapse - and to give the title of their volume a little more weight - the editors might have included a chapter on the relationship between neuro- plasticity and Aristotle's understanding of our inner con- stitution. Although it gains no attention by editors or contributors, the plasticity of the brain is an area of increas- ing interest to life scientists. It refers to the brains capacity to adapt and remodel itself in response to environmental demands, experiences, and trauma. Scientists now acknowl- edge that neuroplasticity, previously believed to be limited to young children, is regularly evidenced in adults. Brain imaging technology, such as MRIs and PET scans, demon- strates that our "neural architecture is not a fixed structure." 5 The adult brain manifests plasticity in various ways: Synaptic linkages become stronger or weaker, the genera- tion and release of neurotransmitters and hormones are altered, neurons and neural connections that are under- utilized get pruned, and new synaptic connections as well as entirely new neurons develop. Neuroimaging of Lon- don taxi drivers, for instance, demonstrated growth in the posterior of the hippocampus proportionate to the num- ber of years the cabbies navigated the city. Most neuro- genesis in adults, studies suggest, is associated with the hippocampus, and in particular the region of it known as the dentate gyrus, where new memories are formed. Learning reflects the development and reinforcement of neural pathways in the brain and, oftentimes, the co-optation of pathways that are underutilized. As Joseph LeDoux observes: " [S]ynapses in the brain, like animals in their envi- ronments, compete to stay alive. Synapses that are used com- pete successfully and survive, while those that are not used perish."6 The brain's linkages develop by way of a process akin to natural selection. A neural Darwinism is at play, and the law of the synaptic jungle is "survival of the busiest."7 Neurons that frequently interact will survive. The rest atro- phy or are co-opted. As brain scientists observe, intoning what is commonly know as Hebbian plasticity: "Cells that fire together, wire together." When synaptic events (firing together) become synaptic probabilities, structural change (wiring together) is at hand. An even more robust sense of brain plasticity occurs in neurogenesis, when wholly new neurons grow. The Lon- don cabbie example demonstrates how the mental activity of memorizing and recalling the names and geography of city streets can have this effect. Studies indicate that vol- untary physical exercise also increases the number of new neurons that form in the hippocampus. Environmental stimulation may then help these new cells to survive and become dominant - by keeping them busy. From an evo- lutionary point of view, this phenomenon would have obvious benefits, rewarding the physical exploration of new environments with enhanced learning capacity. The brain is regularly remodeled by experience. As self- conscious creatures, however, much of what we experi- ence occurs within our own minds, the product of mental activities. Important, then, is the role of self-consciousness in "cortical remapping." A self-reflective mind within a nutritive environment can significantly modify its own brain structures and functions. Shifting your thoughts can reshape your brain. In turn, reshaping your brain alters your behavior, which impacts ongoing brain function and structure. A virtuous (or vicious) cycle may form. It is easy to exaggerate the human capacity for neural remodeling. Still, to no small degree we are the architects of our own brains. In this respect, neuroscience can and should inform our ethics and politics.8 Aristotle brings this point home. We read in the Nico- machean Ethics : "Habit ... is practice long pursued, that at the last becomes the man himself."9 This, essentially, is Aristotle's habit theory of virtue. Virtues are like any other habits or acquired skills. "The moral virtues we do acquire," he observes, "by first exercising them. The same is true of the arts and crafts in general."10 We become virtuous, in other words, by (re)wiring the brain in specific ways through repeated practice. These newly formed brain maps then incline us to certain activities in particular circum- stances, and make it easier (both physically and emotion- ally) to perform these deeds. Contradicting the teachings of his mentor Plato, Aris- totle insisted that the disposition to do the right thing on a regular basis is not a feat of cognitive conviction. Rather, it is an embodied habit grounded in repeated practice. As Aristotle notes, the knowledge that allows for the practice of virtue "must be worked into the living texture of the mind, and this takes time."11 To develop a virtue, we must co-opt neural territory for new purposes and regu- larly reinforce these synaptic connections. To develop a virtue is to engage in brain sculpting. Aristotle gave the original "Both/ And" statement when articulating his habit theory of virtue: "The moral virtues, then, are produced in us neither by Nature nor against Nature. Nature, indeed, prepares in us the ground for their reception, but their complete formation is the product of habit."12 Aristotle is saying that nature and nurture, biol- ogy and environment, work together at the level of our inner constitution to reconfigure it. Through our actions and thoughts we become, neurologically speaking, certain sorts of people disposed to certain sorts of behavior. The "true moral act," neuroscientists suggest, is self-conscious brain sculpting.13 In this respect, a "neuro-Arisotelean" approach to the study of brain plasticity and its relation to human 556 Perspectives on Politics</page><page sequence="9">virtues, habits, skills, and dispositions should be of great concern to political scientists. I promised to speculate as to why Aristotle, and more generally political philosophy, found no place in this edited volume. The reason might have to do with the way the brain itself is structured. Our brains are lateralized. Although the extent and nature of lateralization is often exaggerated and overly simplified in popular literature (as by early neuroscientists), the hemispheres of the brain do specialize. The left hemisphere develops most denotative language functions and syntax. It is where fact retrieval and linear, sequential reasoning, along with many other calculative (mathematical) functions, occur. The right hemi- sphere learns to recognize faces, interprets speech intona- tion, and activates metaphoric and poetic thought. It is more densely connected to limbic (emotional) and brain stem (instinctual) functions and plays a dominant role in the learning of new skills. The right hemisphere specializes in holistic perception, such as pattern recognition, while the left hemisphere is more analytic and detail oriented. In turn, the right hemisphere perceives and accommodates novelty, while the left tends to work within set paradigms. To grossly simplify: The left hemisphere seeks the analytic certainty that allows control, while the right hemisphere discerns the context and fosters the compassion that allows creativity and connection.14 Man Is by Nature a Political Animal demonstrates a predominantly left-brained approach marked by the sys- tematic effort to secure intellectual control through detailed analysis and the use of established quantitative methods. Absent are more holistic meditations that capture contex- tual significance and meaning. It would be a shame if political scientists, in their haste to integrate the data and adopt the methodologies of the life sciences, forgo the benefits to life - and to their discipline - of well-balanced, whole-brain thinking.

Hatemi and Rose McDermott assert that "nature-nurture" is an "out- dated juxtaposition," an "atavistic dichotomy," and a "dual- ism [that] remains absurd on its face" (p. 3). This a surprising assertion in a book titled "Man is by Nature a Political Animal." In rejecting this dichotomy, they claim to "support the dominant interpretation across sciences which assumes the inextricable interaction between biol- ogy [by which the authors intend both genes and "physi- ology"] and environment in determining the growth and development of any given biological organism within a particular ecological context" (p. 3). It would be charac- teristic of this dichotomy to assume that genes could con- tribute to phenotypic variation in a manner that did not involve "inextricable interaction" between genes and the environment; likewise, it would be absurd to assume that a given physiological response could develop in a manner that did not involve environmental interaction. Such assumptions, however, are ubiquitous in this volume. For example, Lindon J. Eaves, Hatemi, Andrew C. Heath, and Nicholas G. Martin (Chap. 4), after consid- ering how to partition the contribution of genes versus environment to variation in political behavior, note a "potential limitation" of their models: "[T]hey are linear and additive [and] do not take into account . . . inter- actions between genes and environments" (p. 157). But if biology (which includes genes) and environment "remain codependent and interactive," what is the value of a model that treats them as if they are not interactive ? It is one thing to acknowledge the shortcomings of a model; it is another to construct a model on the basis of a principle that one simultaneously claims is "absurd on its face." A similar "atavistic dichotomy" is found in Kevin B. Smith and John R. Hibbings (Chap. 7) account of the development of "physiological" differences: "The evolutionary process has imbued all humans with an autonomic nervous sys- tem, but genetic variation has instilled a remarkable amount of diversity in the specific response levels of individuated nervous systems to standardized stimuli" (p. 225). Hence, diversity in autonomic responses is ascribed entirely to "genetic variation" (inasmuch as "genes build physiology" [p. 225] ) in defiance of "the inextricable interaction between biology and environment." Evan Charney is Faculty Fellow at the Duke Institute for Brain Sciences, Faculty Researcher at the Duke Institute for Genome Science and Policy , and Associate Professor of the Practice of Public Policy and Political Science at Duke University ( echar@duke.edu ). Consider the role of the environment in shaping the autonomic nervous systems stress response (the "fight or flight" response), inasmuch as it provides an illustration of the kind of biology-environment interaction that is con- spicuously absent from this volume, as well as the evolu- tionary significance of such interaction. Differences in early maternal care translate into differences in the stress response of offspring, and cross-fostering studies have shown repeat- edly that the key determinant is the rearing rather than the biological mother.1 Offspring that receive low levels of maternal care exhibit, as adults, increased levels of stress as measured behaviorally and physiologically, with females also exhibiting earlier mating behavior and lower levels of maternal care, while high maternal-care offspring exhibit, as adults, the opposite phenotypes. Significantly, these behaviors are associated with postnatal alterations to the epigenome, the complex, environmentally reactive, bio- chemical system that regulates the accessibility of genes to transcription factors and, thereby, the extent to which any given gene can be transcribed. The observed epigenetic changes, and corresponding changes in gene transcription rates, are consistent with increased and decreased stress responses. In other words, the environment reprograms the epigenome and the epigenome reprograms gene tran- scription rates.2 This is an example of phenotypic plasticity , the ability of an organism to modify developmental trajectories and change phenotypic state or activity in response to varia- tions in environmental conditions. Developmental phe- notypic plasticity evolved because it is adaptive , promoting Darwinian fitness by enhancement of survival and repro- ductive success by using environmental cues to optimize the life-course strategy. A heightened stress response and diminished maternal care enhance the mothers chances of survival in a dangerous ("high stress") environment, but by shaping the stress response and mating and rear- ing behavior of her offspring, she enhances their survival as well. Offspring behavioral plasticity enables the mother to adjust offspring phenotype in response to the environ- ment she inhabits. Adversity during perinatal develop- ment can forecast an increased level of demand in the environment the offspring will occupy. Under such conditions, the animals best interest is to enhance its behavioral (e.g., vigilance, fearfulness) and endocrine responsiveness to stress. These responses promote detec- tion of potential threat, avoidance learning, and metabolic/ cardiovascular responses that are essential under the increased demands of the stressor. Such environmental shaping of physiological response is not to be confused with either "G x E" ("gene x envi- ronment" interaction or "gene-environment interplay" [Chap. 5] ) or what Eaves and his colleagues refer to as the "ontogenetic process" (p. 154). G x E is the idea that a particular polymorphism will result in a given phenotype in one environment and a different phenotype (or no 558 Perspectives on Politics</page><page sequence="11">phenotype) iri a different environment. The "ontogenetic process" refers to purported (and inexplicable, both in terms of physiology and adaptive value) changes in the heritability of a particular phenotype at a particular point in life as indicated by the twin-study methodology. Nei- ther G X E nor the ontogenetic process involves pheno- typic plasticity, that is, modification of developmental trajectories to meet the demands of a particular environ- ment and, hence, neither has any apparent adaptive value. Neither epigenetics nor phenotypic plasticity - mechanisms that embody "the inextricable interaction between biol- ogy and environment" - is mentioned anywhere in this volume, although the former represents the most impor- tant development in molecular genetics and the latter the most important development in evolutionary biology over the past 50 years. Both absurdly high heritability estimates - 60% for political participation (p. 215), 60% for strength of polit- ical partisanship (p. 216), 50%-70% for attitudes toward homosexuality and gay rights - and the assumption that single polymorphisms can predict complex political behav- iors (Chaps. 5, 6, 8) reinforce, rather than overcome, the traditional nature-nurture dichotomy. If we were to take such heritability estimates seriously, then we would have to conclude that humans were less biologically influenced by, and reactive to, their environments than fruit flies (her- itability of aggression in fruit flies is ~10%).3 Aggressive strains of fruit flies exhibit differences in transcription rates of more than 1,539 genes as compared to controls.4 In a situation such as this, no single gene could possibly pre- dict aggressive behavior, yet we are told that a single poly- morphism can predict, for example, voting (pp. 218-19, 268). The assumption that a single polymorphism could pre- dict a behavior such as voting results from conceptualiz- ing complex behaviors in the manner of "simple" genetic disorders (p. 27): [D]owns syndrome results from just a small genotypic and bio- logical variation, a relatively small variation that can alter an entire set of social and physical behaviors. Considering that we have endless small genetic differences across the entire popula- tion, the logical assumption would be that these differences also affect attitudes and. behaviors, including political behaviors. This is not a logical assumption but, rather, a profound error. Huntingtons disease is a neurological disorder caused by a mutation on a gene (HTT) that is coded for the protein huntingtin. Symptoms include changes in person- ality and cognitive ability and, over time, the eventual loss of the ability to walk, talk, think, and reason. Can we infer from this that polymorphisms of single genes are likely to influence a wide array of complex normal behav- iors associated with the healthy human brain (such as, e.g., voting)? Certainly not. An HTT gene mutation has far-reaching phenotypic consequences because the end result of an abnormal huntingtin protein is neuronal degen- eration. But voting, for example, is not a monogenic dis- order, or an oligogenic disorder, or a complex polygenic disorder. Normal complex human behavior is not a clus- ter of disorders, nor is it a cluster of distinct "behaviors," each behavior predicted by a gene or set of genes. Rather, normal behavior is the integrated output of a highly inte- grated biological system interacting with a particular environment. Physiology In their discussion of physiology and political ideology, Kevin Smith and John Hibbing reference a study by Doug- las Oxley and his coauthors5 in which the latter "used SCL [skin conductance levels] to detect physiological dif- ferences in response to threatening stimuli between con- servatives and liberals" (p. 233). The Oxley coauthors assumed that what they were measuring using SCL was a "threat response" because they showed participants what they classified as three "threatening images." But whether or not an image, for example, of a woman laughing at a large spider crawling on her face, is "threatening" is cer- tainly in the eyes of the beholder. This point is important because measures of SCL are nonspecific measures of arousal of any kind; for example, surprise, joy, disgust, empathy, or interest can all be manifested by identical increases in SCL. Furthermore, Smith and Hibbing claim that this study showed differences in "threat responses" between "conservatives" and "liberals," when, in fact, associations were purported (and highlighted) for only a few items of the Wilson-Patterson "conservatism" index. Nonetheless, the general takeaway of this study seems to have been that "conservatives have greater threat responses than liberals." But, of course, what distinguishes liberals and conserva- tives is not that one or the other has greater levels of "fear" in some general sense, but that (to continue with the lan- guage of fear) they fear different things: Liberals fear global warming and gun violence; conservatives fear the eco- nomic impact of environmental restrictions and the loss of Second Amendment rights. Smith and Hibbing (p. 233) also reference a study by K. Smith and colleagues6 purporting to show that "con- servatives" exhibit greater "disgust responses" than "liber- als" (based upon the same dubious methodology), and the authors of this study speculate that greater disgust responses toward, for example, homosexuality, might explain conservatives' opposition to gay marriage. But how does one get from a feeling of disgust to a political point of view? In and of itself, a reaction of disgust has no political implications whatsoever. The fact that I find the smell and taste of Limburger cheese disgusting does not entail that I think Limburger should be banned and those who make or consume it imprisoned (or that its consumption by adults should be tolerated, but behind closed doors). There is simply no way to derive political June 2013 Ä¼ Vol. 11 /No. 2 559</page><page sequence="12">Review Symposium | Politics and Biology principles from a sensation of disgust without presuppos- ing a host of principles to which the sensation of disgust itself is supposed to give rise (e.g., how far-reaching the authority of governmental power should be, or whether disgust is a legitimate reason to ban an activity and pun- ish those who engage in it). Furthermore, what does my disgust with Limburger cheese have to do, for example, with my disgust at the current state of American politics (besides the use of the word disgust in both instances)? The latter is a consequence of my political and moral views regarding American politics; the former is a conse- quence of my sense of taste and smell. Politics and Religion To be a member of a particular religion (as distinguished from "religiosity" in some abstract sense [p. 35, Chap. 4] ) is the only complex behavior that, as far as I can tell, practitioners of behavior genetics appear reluctant to claim is heritable or predictable by a polymorphism. But this is not, despite what Hatemi and McDermott (and many others) claim (p. 35), because this behavior has not been found to be heritable. For example, being a Born Again Christian is, we are told, 65% heritable,7 Sabbath Obser- vance is 35% heritable,8 a belief in Biblical Truth is 25% heritable,9 and religious affiliation in general exhibits a moderate, "statistically significant" heritability.10 Note how such findings are handled, however. For exam- ple, despite the fact that Sabbath observance and belief in the Bible are said to be heritable, they are treated not as Christian religious doctrines but as examples of "religious conservatism (minus the specific religious affiliation).11 In reporting that being a Born Again Christian is 65% her- itable, the authors note that "the wording of this particu- lar question forces us to interpret this finding with caution (i.e., it combines a generic commitment to Jesus Christ that may be shared among all Christians with the conser- vative Protestant-specific concept of being 'born-again )," 12 and they classify this not as the heritability of being a Born Again Christian but the heritability of "transforma- tions and commitment." When A. B. Heath and col- leagues13 found that polymorphisms of the ADH2 gene predicted Anglicanism , they did not publish a study titled "Gene Predicts Anglicanism," but rather speculated (quite sensibly) that these findings were driven by population stratification.14 And when Brian D'Onofrio and his col- leagues discovered that the heritability of religious affilia- tion was "statistically significant," they speculated that genetic factors play a role in "determining which children decide not to follow in the religious traditions of their parents."15 In other words, following the religious tradi- tion of one's parents was distinguished from the religious tradition itself! Why are religion and politics treated in such different ways? It is likely because the absurdity of claiming, for example, that a gene predicts Anglicanism, or Confucian- ism, or Zoroastrianism, or that they are "heritable," is manifest even to practitioners of behavior genetics; that is, the historical and cultural particularity of religious commitments is as manifest as their mode of transmis- sion. That twin studies generate results that even parti- sans of the methodology acknowledge as absurd is further evidence that they are to many what they have always seemed to be: an obviously confounded, unreliable meth- odology. Yet political ideologies, which exhibit the same rate of parent-to-child transmission as religious "ideolo- gies," are just as culturally and historically particularistic and manifold, a fact obvious to anyone even casually acquainted with the history of political beliefs and practices. This particularity is masked by the almost universal tendency to speak of "liberalism" and "conservatism" as if these were the two necessary and universal modes of political behavior (while typically using measures of twenty-first-century American liberalism and conserva- tism; passim in the current volume). Assuming that all political ideologies that have ever existed are manifesta- tions of either liberalism or conservatism is like assuming that all religions that have ever existed are manifestations of either Christianity or Judaism. A claim that being a (twenty-first-century American) liberal or conservative is 50% heritable (p. 35) is as absurd as the claim that being a Born Again Christian is 65% heritable (construed as a claim about Christianity ); the claim that a gene predicts (twenty-first-century American) liberalism (p. 219) is as absurd as the claim that a gene predicts (twenty-first- century) Anglicanism. Conclusion Although the editors begin with the promising claim that nature-nurture is an "atavistic dichotomy," this dichot- omy is reinforced throughout the volume for at least three reasons: 1) "Genes" and "environment" are treated as inde- pendent causal forces whose contribution to variation in complex behaviors can be precisely quantified; 2) claims that polymorphisms can predict phenotypes ignore, for the most part, the entire developmental (i.e., environmen- tal) history starting with fertilization and ending with, for example, entering a voting booth; and 3) "physiology" and "environment" are treated as if the former develops in a manner independent of the latter. I agree that political beliefs are not simply, or even mostly, a matter of reason and reflection, but the assumption that political behavior is reducible to, or derivable from, physiological responses is deafly incorrect. Finally, the difficulty of discussing the biology of politics is compounded by the fact that specific political beliefs and practices resemble what most practi- tioners of behavior genetics claim are not "biological" (despite findings to the contrary based on their own meth- odologies), namely, specific (doctrinal) religious beliefs and practices. 560 Perspectives on Politics</page><page sequence="13">Notes 1 Champagne and Curley 2009. 2 For an overview and references, see Charney 2012. 3 Edwards et al. 2009. 4 Ibid. 5 Oxley et al. 2008. 6 Smith et al. 2009. 7 Bradshaw and Ellison 2008. 8 Ibid. 9 D'Onofrio et al. 1999. 10 Ibid. 1 1 Bradshaw and Ellison 2008; D'Onofrio et al. 1999. 12 Bradshaw and Ellison 2008, 542. 13 Heath et al. 2001. 14 Population stratification refers to differences in allele frequencies among populations due to genetic ances- try.

Gunnell doi:1 0.1 01 7/S1 53759271 30001 94 People nowadays think that scientists exist to instruct them. Ludwig Wittgenstein 1 Ludwig Wittgenstein famously stated that "the confusion and barrenness of psychology is not to be explained by calling it a young science' ... for in psychology there are experimental methods and conceptual confusion ."2 The kinds of confusions that he referred to are much in evi- dence in Man Is by Nature a Political Animal. The type of claim advanced in the volume has a long history in the field of political science, but that does little to overcome the conceptual difficulties of past ventures, ranging from social Darwinism to biopolitics. Although the kind of approach represented here has often been criticized as reductionist, antihumanist, determinist, and so on, the more significant problems are theoretical and logical. The first confusion arises from the title's invocation of Aristotle. There may, indeed, be lessons that can be derived from Aristotle, but they are not those suggested in the various chapters of the book. Aristotle's designation of humans as political animals, or, more accurately, animals whose nature is to live in a polisy had two related but distinct dimensions. He assumed that there was a biolog- ically natural foundation of human behavior, including the empirical facts that humans belonged to the class of gregarious animals and that the polis was a natural, but not inevitable, outgrowth of basic human needs and tended to evolve from more primitive but necessary associations, such as the household. But, more importantly, he also characterized politics as natural in the sense that political life allowed, especially through the medium of citizen- ship, for both the development and exercise of the dis- tinctly human capacity for language, which in turn was the basis of action, reason, philosophy, and normative judg- ment about matters such as justice. According to Aris- totle, what happened in a polis was both constrained and made possible by biology, but what was more definitively and essentially natural, though contingent, was the emer- gent conventional character of political life. For him, other animals were only metaphorically or analogically political, and what was natural in the sense of biology was not an explanation for the particulars of political life. There is no a priori reason to take Aristotle as authoritative in these matters, but his Ethics and Politics are certainly not a spring- board for the kinds of arguments advanced in this volume. The conceptual difficulties continue when the editors reject what they refer to as the " classic' " meaning of the term politicsy that is, the practices and institutions that, in John G. Gunnell is Visiting Research Associate in the De- partment of Political Science at UC Davisy and Distin- guished Professor of Political Science at SUNY Albany. various societies, are typically self-ascribed and distin- guished as political. "Politics" is instead defined generi- cally as an analytically distinguishable form of "human behavior," which could apply to virtually any form of social interaction (such as, the editors suggest, "when lovers argue"). This excludes the concept of politics as designat- ing any theoretically autonomous subject matter or form of inquiry. In one respect, this might be a welcome alter- native to the tendency in some of contemporary political theory to confer an ontological status on politics and to speak of "the Political," but it not only diverges from Aris- totle but also leaves open the broader and crucial theoret- ical question of what constitutes that class of "social and political behaviors" of which politics is an instance. The basic argument of the volume is that various aspects of the "biological organism" serve to "help shape and guide" politics and that, consequently, the subject can be studied by "biology, endocrinology, evolution, genetics, neurol- ogy, and physiology" (p. 2). This approach is in part designed to sidestep or overstep the "nature/nurture" debate and to complement, and in some respects transcend, the recent popularity of rational choice analysis, as well as more traditional studies based on "environmental" fac- tors, such as institutional structures and "socialization." But since the concept of politics, and social behavior as a whole, is left theoretically empty, the issue concerning how such phenomena are shaped and guided by biology cannot be clearly addressed. While the concept of behav- ior remains porous, there is a tendency in these chapters to assume the "giveness" of biological facts, as if these were independent variables, but much of the material in natu- ral science on which they draw is both theoretically dis- parate and internally contested. The individual authors also seem to have quite different concepts of "shaping" and "guiding," and there is often no clear indication of their disciplinary identity, even though in addition to polit- ical science, they apparently include sociology, anthropol- ogy, psychology, and genetics. Most, however, are not natural scientists but somewhat selective and random bor- rowers, who often appear to be less serious students of biology than intellectual foragers seeking support for prior agendas. In their chapter on "Evolution as a Theory of Political Behavior," Peter K. Hatemi and Rose McDermott claim that "evolution offers a potential foundation for a unifying theory of human behavior" and that this not only comple- ments and, to some extent, transcends current approaches but also reconciles "human universais" and "individual dif- ferences" (p. 20). What is meant by a "unifying theory" of evolution is, however, unclear. The authors are apparently not subscribing to what is now often referred to as "univer- sal Darwinism," that is, the claim that evolutionary theory can be extended to nonbiological phenomena, a claim which has been advanced by scientists such as Richard Dawkins and philosophers such as Daniel Dennett. The latter argue 562 Perspectives on Politics</page><page sequence="15">that the process of human evolution has resulted in the emer- gence and autonomy of social and cultural phenomena ("memes") but that Darwins general theory, as well as the theory of genetic replication, can be extended to the expla- nation of the interactions and changes among such cultural units. On two occasions, Hatemi and McDermott quote Edward O. Wilsons statement that "the boundary between the natural sciences on the one side and humanities and humanistic social sciences on the other is not an episte- mologica! fault line, but a domain of poorly understood material phenomena that invites cooperative exploration from both sides" (pp. 17, 38). This quotation, however, unlike the books basic argument that biological facts affect social facts, assumes that we are dealing not with theoretically distinct phenomena but with levels of the same kind of phenomena, that is, "material phenomena." But the use of this quotation also indicates a failure to recognize that natural facts are far from given and con- stant. Wilson has now (e.g., The Social Conquest of the Earthy 2012) abandoned a central premise of his earlier work ( Sociobiologyy 1975), as well as of modern evolu- tionary biology in general and of much of the literature cited in the chapter. This is the assumption that natural selection works principally on the genes of individuals and that forms of social behavior, such as altruism, among both animals and humans, derive from genes. Wilson now claims that group selection and the replication of eusocial behavior is the basic explanation of altruism, as well as of the dominance of the human species. Oleg Smirnov and Tim Johnson also advocate "evolutionary modeling," but although they distinguish their "formal approach" from more "figurative" uses of the term evolu- tion by some social scientists, their model of "evolution- ary game theory," is, as they actually indicate, more a heuristic and ideal typification based on various general evolutionary concepts than an actual application of bio- logical evolutionary theory. Whatever Wilson may now believe about the basis of human altruism, his arguments exemplify a basic recur- ring conceptual problem in the literature of sociobiology that is manifest in this volume. This is the assumption that when we take terms that refer to characteristically human forms of social interaction, such as altruism, com- petition, and so on, and apply them naturalistically to what seems to be functionally similar behavior in other creatures such as ants, we have discovered either a theo- retical similarity or a causal link. Darby Proctor and Sarah Brosnan fall into this fallacy by describing the behavior of chimpanzees in anthropomorphic terms, that is, "how the human ideals of politics and political behavior can be trans- lated into useful concepts for other species" (pp. 4 7-48), and then abstractly defining politics, using Harold Lass- well's stipulative definition, in a manner that would apply to any creatures. They then ask what nonhuman "pri- mates can tell us about the evolutionary roots of our own political behavior" and conclude that because the former precede humans on the evolutionary scale, studying their behavior and noting similarities with humans can explain important aspects of the origins and character of human social interaction. The long multiauthored chapter (83 pages) by Lindon Eaves, Hatemi, Andrew Heath, and Nicholas Martin is devoted to challenging the claim that "the origin and trans- mission of behavioral differences is social" (p. 101), but no one has ever claimed that all behavior can be explained socially - only that social behavior can be explained socially, as apparently Wilson has now concluded. The authors, however, argue that genes are linked to. the political ideas and behavior of twins and nuclear families. Two other chapters (Jason Boardman; James Fowler, Peter Loewen, Jaime Settle, and Christopher Dawes) also explore the pos- sibility of tracing a connection between genes and poli- tics. What is involved in these studies, however, is primarily a matter of positing correlations, but noting such correla- tions does not establish a causal connection between the two separate theoretical realms of biological and social phenomena. It is also difficult to discern how such an individual- istic approach could be applied to the study of collec- tive political behavior. A chapter by Kevin Smith and John Hibbing on the "psychophysiology" of the "mind- body connection" leaves the terms mind and psycholog- ical states conceptually empty but urges on the reader a post-Cartesian form of dualism that presents mind and body, that is, political "orientations" and their bio- logical correlates, as two autonomous but causally and interacting "domains." A chapter on "neuropolitics" by Darren Schreiber also argues that "brain activity is corre- lated with mental life" but again leaves the concept of "mental life" theoretically unspecified and largely substi- tutes the old mind/ body dualism with a brain/ body dual- ism. Schreiber also perpetuates the books unredeemed claim that we can, in more than a metaphorical or heu- ristic sense, "observe politics ... in a wide variety of animals." The most persistent problem in the volume is the lack of clarity regarding its conception of the relationship between natural and social facts. It would be intelligible, and, from Aristotle to the present, largely beyond ques- tion, to claim that, in various respects, biological struc- tures and processes both constrain and enable social life and that if the biological world were fundamentally dif- ferent, many of our political concepts and actions would surely be different. What is being advanced in the vol- ume, however, is the stronger claim that political facts are affected in some manner by biological and physiolog- ical facts. The difficulty with this claim is that we are dealing with two theoretically incommensurable realms of fact. It June 2013 | Vol. 11 /No. 2 563</page><page sequence="16">Review Symposium | Politics and Biology would be similar to saying that chemical facts have a causal impact on biological facts, but, for example, biochemistry is really a matter of studying the chemical processes in biological organisms, rather than a matter of explaining the latter facts in terms of the ways in which they are affected or guided by the former. The latter proposition is also very different from, for example, the manner in which genetics has been incorporated as an important extension of the theory of evolution. In biochemistry, we are talking about biological facts all the way down and assuming that the organisms have various indigenous levels of existence. Biological phenomena do not, however, constitute a level of political phenomena, or if they were in some manner construed as such a level, it would be in the sense that a biologist might study the organisms that manifest politi- cal behavior. Politics, and conventional objects in general, such as language, are what philosophers might speak of as strongly emergent, that is, phenomena whose qualities are not traceable to their components but supervene on them. Even the rules of chess, let alone the biology of the play- ers, do not causally explain the particular moves the play- ers make - whatever correlations we may find between such moves and various neurological and physiological events. A somewhat similar confusion is apparent in the claim advanced by some of the authors that political behavior can be explained in terms of "beliefs," "attitudes," and "preferences" that have biological causes. The first prob- lem is that the meaning of these terms is left undeter- mined. One might ask if these are psychological states, physical brain states, reports of surveyed individuals, oper- ationally defined responses to certain questions, and so on. But however these terms may be theoretically expli- cated, we would again be confronted with two different theoretical realms and attending but incommensurable fac- tual content. There is no third, or common, object of inquiry that is the bearer of both mental and biological attributes. Politics, as construed by the authors, is juxta- posed to various physiological phenomena, but it is diffi- cult to make sense of the claim that biological facts interact with social facts unless a theory is advanced that subsumes both classes of fact. It might be argued that social phe- nomena are gross or macro manifestations of an underly- ing micro reality or that political actions and ideas can be explained scientifically. This would seem to suggest, how- ever, that social phenomena are appearances, just as vari- ous proponents of neuroscience have attempted to specify "what emotions really are," that is, physiological states, despite their manifestation in the form of certain aspects of social behavior, but the editors claim to reject any charge of reductionism as "specious." One might possibly argue that just as a substance such as matter has both physical and chemical properties, social phenomena possess both biological and conventional properties, but this would again raise the question of the theoretical constitution of social phenomena and conflict with the premise that natural facts and social facts are two interacting domains. The human sciences and the natural sciences may be construed in many ways as complementary endeavors. Cer- tainly, as chapters on "hormones" by McDermott and by Coren Apicella and David Cesarini suggest, biological fac- tors relating to evolution, genetics, hormones, brain states, and so on are relevant for explaining how an individual acts in, for example, the game of baseball or any other form of human social interaction. Steroid injection and blood doping demonstrate how biological facts can have an impact on various sports, and few would doubt that testosterone plays a role in "classic" politics as well as in arguments between lovers, but the investigation of such matters is applied biology, which should not be confused with the claim that biology is a way of studying baseball. What is missing in the volume, but what is necessary before there can be a serious engagement of the issues involved, is a theoretical argument about political phe- nomena, rather than just an arbitrary definition of poli- tics, as well as a more focused discussion about the differences and similarities between natural science and social science. Social scientists continue to argue about whether or not the methods and/or theories of natural science can be applied to social phenomena, but these arguments have tended to skirt the crux of the matter. The fundamental difference between natural and social science is not, in the first instance, methodological but simply that while what is conceived as the facts of natural science are internally generated within the theories and discourse of natural science, social facts, no matter how they are described by the social scientist, are also concep- tually constituted in the conventions that compose the language and practices of social actors. The implication of this difference is that no matter what methods social sci- ence deploys to investigate social phenomena, it is an inter- pretive, representative, reconstructive, and (potentially) critical endeavor as opposed to the constructive presenta- tional character of natural science. If natural factors are construed as guiding and shaping social behavior, it is in the sense that, for example, an injury to the brain might lead to an inability to engage in emotional expression, which is not the same as suggesting that emotions are physiological states. Social science is more like natural his- tory than natural science. Natural history presupposes biol- ogy, but even animal behavior constitutes an emergent class of facts.3 .
