<plain_text><page sequence="1">RU, XLIII, Nos. 145-146 (1989) Olga Muller Cooke * GOGOL"S STRAŠ NAJA MEST ' AND BELYJ'S PROSE FICTION: The Role of Karma Andrej Belyj viewed Gogol"s "Strašnaja mest'" as the embodiment of the perfect work of art and as a profound spiritual text. Belyj 's lifelong fascination with "Strašnaja mesť", especially the figure of the "koldun," generated a series of artistic responses to Gogol's tale in forms as diverse as the novel, short story, poetry, essay and scholarly treatise. Belyj's various portrayals, however, revealed a fundamental difference: while Gogol' chose a Christian cosmology with regard to his depiction of the sorcerer, Belyj preferred an Eastern approach, one that would accomodate the doctrine of karma. In his Masterstvo Gogolja Belyj responded to "Strašnaja mesť" by referring to the biblical account of the first murder, in which Cain kills Abel.1 Rather than treat GogoF's sorcerer as guilty of murder, Belyj perceives him as a victim. What is guilty, notes Belyj, is the family, or more likely, the "generation" (род). Not only does Gogol"s sorcerer suffer from "kinlessness" (безродность); but, as Belyj concluded, "Tema bezrodnosti - tema tvorčestva Gogolja."2 Severed from the community like Cain, the wandering sorcerer, according to Belyj, reenacts the trials of his past lives. Belyj makes fascinating comments about the role of Cain in the development of civilization, namely as the builder of cities. Cain's transgression represents the first step toward the evolution of culture, from the shepherd Abel's pastoral domain to an urban and architectural habitat. Belyj cites the sorcerer's Faustian quest for knowledge and interest in alchemy, crimes notwithstanding, as indices of the sorcerer's special place in society. Gogol"s harrowing depictions of incestuous desire and murder must be viewed as just punishment for long-forgotten deeds over which the sorcerer has little control. Belyj, however, felt that Gogol' misunderstood the sorcerer. Although Belyj considered "Strašnaja mesť" the pinnacle of Gogol"s so-called "first phase,"3 he found much to fault Gogol1, for Gogol' erred in treating the ancestral sin as a diabolical and omnipresent 'нечистая сила* working against * Olga Muller Cooke is an Assistant Professor of Russian, Department of Modern Languages, Texas A&amp;M University, College Station, Texas. 71</page><page sequence="2">the accursed sorcerer. To Belyj, the Christian Gogol' shortchanged his villain: he denied him a second chance. Both authors steeped themselves in scriptural and folkloric literature, but Belyj applied the doctrine of karma in his depictions of sorcerers, especially in the Moscow novels. There Belyj illustrates how a soul can be redeemed through karma. Belyj had no qualms about admitting his artistic debt to Gogol'. So important was Gogol' for Belyj that one of Belyj's pseudonymous doubles is "Janovskij," Gogol"s family surname.4 During his famous Tower gatherings Vjačeslav Ivanov would joke about the resemblance between Belyj and Gogol'.5 Indeed, Ivanov's affectionate term for Belyj, "gogolek," would be employed once again shortly after Belyj's death in a poem by Osip Mandel'štam: "Скажите, говорят, какой-то Гоголь умер? / Не Гоголь, так себе, писатель... гоголек".6 In Master stvo Gogolja Belyj maintains that his own prose "renews the 'school' of Gogol' in the twentieth century."7 In this exhaustive scholarly study, Belyj exposes his self-syled "Gogol' complex"8 by situating excerpts from his novels beside works by Gogol'. For example, copious passages from the Večera na xutore bliz Dikanki tales are cited next to passages from Serebrjanyj golub'. There Belyj italicizes phrases to point out the Gogolian stylistic devices of parallelisms, repetition, negation, hyperbole, etc., which he unabashedly parrots. Excerpts of Gogol"s Peterburgskie pověsti are offered as models for Peterburg. V. Papernyj notes: "The attempt to 'resurrect' and 'renew' the tradition of Gogol' accompanied Belyj, at every stage of Belyj's creative evolution. [...] In Gogol' Belyj sought not Another but Himself, he wanted to be a New Gogol' and he perceived Gogol' in his own way as part of his own personality'.9 There is no doubt that Gogol"s personality held as much fascination for Belyj as did his fiction. Thomas R. Beyer, Jr. claims that Dar'jal'skij, the hero of Belyj's most Gogolian novel, Serebrjanyj golub', is in fact Gogol'. Beyer argues that the similarities between Gogol"s and Dar'jal'skij's parallel spiritual journeys are too uncanny to be coincidental.10 That Gogol"s horrifying imagery never ceased to haunt Belyj is the subject of "Gogol'," an essay to honor the centennial celebration of Gogol"s birth. Vampirism, diabolical laughter, pigs' snouts, depictions of fantastic and supernatural phenomena - Belyj discerns these nightmarish themes as reflections of Gogol"s personal phobias.11 A discussion of the sorcerer's daughter Katerina from "Strašnaja mest'" gives way to sundry lyrical and hypnotizing citations from Gogol"s works.12 Belyj contends that Gogol"s own 72</page><page sequence="3">demons were never exorcised, that he ventured into dangerous psychic territory unaided by an experienced mentor well-versed in the occult.13 Furthermore, Belyj chastises Gogol' for displaying little interest in the mystical East, for his lack of curiosity, and ultimately, his lack of patience: у Гоголя не было терпения изучать, и потому-то искал он руководителя вовсе не там, где сле- довало: не изучал Гоголь восточной мистической литературы - не изучал вообще ничего.14 Had Gogol' steeped himself in a faith less dogmatic than Russian Orthodoxy, and had he sought the advice of a spiritual teacher less intolerant than Father Matthew, preferably an Indian yogi, Belyj implies, Gogol' might have been spared the horrors of his self- inflicted death.15 Belyj's personal assessment of Gogol"s biography hardly changed over the years, as his Masterstvo Gogolja bears witness; there Belyj returns to his earlier interpretation of Gogol"s artistic figures of fact and fantasy as reflections of GogoT's personal demons. Just as the earlier essay treated Gogol"s spiritual blindness, so does Masterstvo Gogolja find fault with Gogol"s lack of imagination in the realm of philosophy and theology. Repeating the mystifying and titillating image of Gogol' loving "Russia as the sorcerer loves his daughter Katerina,"16 Belyj punctuates his long analysis of "Strašnaja mest'" with the notion that Gogol' identified the artist in himself with the sorcerer, while conjuring up the soul of Katerina: Гоголь отожествил художника в себе с "колду- ном", вызвавшим душу Катерины. Так он колдует над своим представлением о России: с пером в руке.17 Gogol' created a frightening image of the Carpathian horseman, but unknowingly depicted himself.18 Throughout Belyj's analysis of "Strašnaja mest'" in Masterstvo Gogolja there is a constant effort to display GogoF's effortless, hypnotic poetry and hyperbole. Much space is devoted to the implementation of the negated particles "ne and "ni," augmented by the overall effect of "ne to" in the story; Belyj singled out these features as analogues of the nihilistic plot, i.e., the curse upon Petro's clan which the sorcerer inherited. He also tested the prevalent interpretation then in fashion. Belyj was not 73</page><page sequence="4">satisfied with a simple treatment of the mythic theme of retribution, mainly of the sins of the fathers being visited upon the sons, for there was no lesson to be learned: after all, the sorcerer gains neither enlightenment nor forgiveness. Nor was Belyj satisfied with what he called the "naïve" psychoanalytic approach favored by Vasilij Rozanov and Prof. I.D. Ermakov, who focused solely on the incestuous relationship between father and daughter, including the daughter's unconscious desires for her father. Belyj insists that "sexual unnaturalness is a result of something much more deeply rooted; Rozanov's theory simplifies the subject, which is not only psychological, but principally social."19 When discussing inexplicable violence in Gogol"s works, whether it takes place in the deceptive Ukrainian bogs and meadows or the foggy and threatening cityscapes of Petersburg, few plots can compare with "Strašnaja mest'." Gogol' spins a lurid tale of a sorcerer, the last of Petro's descendants, who secretly desires his married daughter, Katerina, and who in addition to killing his wife, also murders his son-in-law, his grandson and a hermit. This last violation is followed by the sorcerer's own death: he is thrown off his horse by a laughing horseman into the depths of the Carpathians, where the dead leap up to sink their teeth into the sorcerer's corpse. The reader learns in the end that because of Ivan's curse on Petro, each successive descendant of his line is to become more vicious than his predecessor. As Richard Peace notes: "such a curse of degeneration suggests itself as an allegory of incest, and the ultimate evil is reached - it is the crime of the wizard who seeks to marry his own daughter."20 To Gogol"s Chrisian message that the sorcerer deserved such punishment, Belyj objected that Gogol' was ignoring the guilt of the entire clan.21 Although Belyj never used the word "anthroposophy" in his book on Gogol', it is clear that Belyj sought to explain the sorcerer's horrible death throes with the aid of Eastern philosophy and anthroposophy, principally in the meaning of karma.22 It is likely that Belyj understood karma according to Steiner's interpretation: The human spirit must be reincarnated again and again; and man is governed by the law that he brings the fruits of his former life with him into the next one. The soul lives in the present. But this life in the present is not independent of the former life. The spirit that has been reincarnated brings its destiny with it from earlier incarnations. And this destiny rules his life. The impressions that the soul receives, the desires that are satisfied, the joys and sorrows that it experiences, depend on its actions in previous incarnations. 74</page><page sequence="5">The body is subject to the laws of heredity; the soul is subject to the destiny that it has itself created. This self- created destiny of man is called his Karma. And the spirit is subject to the law of reincarnation.23 Belyj did not implement this interpretation directly in his critique of Gogol', but rather posed the problem of karma in his creative works. The notion that man creates his own destiny and is free to counteract the effects of past conduct is consistent with virtually all religious literature of the East. Steiner's cosmogony, which attempted to blend Eastern and Western thought, held that as long as man evolves he keeps striving for perfection. By the same token, man will be set back by either the cumulative deeds of his past lives, or the deeds of an entire race. Steiner, both as a scientist and an occultist, viewed the law of karma as the law of causation.24 Belyj spent years studying Eastern religions, even prior to his long relationship with the founder of anthroposophy. For instance, Belyj often turned to the Bhagavad-Gita.25 Belyj came to understand the place of violence in man's cosmic development with the aid of lessons learned from the Bhagavad-Gita, where Arjuna asks Krishna why there must be so much bloodshed.26 In despair over the lives lost in World War I, Belyj invoked the ancient Indian battlefield where brother fought brother, echoing the first biblical murder. "With horror and seriousness, one must accept the experience of world war, as the first wave of another war, a cosmic war, which is only now beginning, the resolution of which will bring about the "new man."27 With this in view, one should not be surprised that Belyj often depicted acts of unspeakable violence, all of which, according to his perceptions of mankind, were necessary for man's evolution. Thus, when Belyj associated the sorcerer with Cain, he interpreted the biblical image of Abel's blood crying from the ground not as a cry for revenge, but a cry for rest. The Koldun in Belyj 's Fiction Many of Belyj's fictional works hark back to "Strašnaja mest'," especially his final novels, Moskva and Maski. Moreover, if there is any figure whose alter egos revisit the prose works of Belyj it is the "koldun." Bely's sorcerers, whose roots are both folkloric and literary, are almost invariably corrupted by evil. For instance, the same year - 1906 - in which Belyj was preoccupied rereading Gogol', especially "Strašnaja mest'," was the year he wrote "Kust."28 Set to hypnotic, rhythmic prose like "Strašnaja mest'," 75</page><page sequence="6">"Kust" shares uncanny similarities with Gogol"s story.29 The cast of characters includes a mad fool Ivanu ška, a bewitching maiden, and a menacing bush, which is called a sorcerer, like Gogol"s nameless "koldun." A bizarre preoccupation with madness, rape and bondage pervades Belyj's early forays into the world of sorcery.30 While Belyj perceived Rozanov's emphasis on incest in discussing Gogol"s story along Freudian lines as simplistic, Belyj himself exhibited a similar preoccupation with incest, particularly in narratives where sorcerers are found. In the short story "Gornaja vladičica," Belyj offers one of the strangest of all tales of brother- sister and father-daughter incest which not only anticipates his final novels, but calls to mind "Strašnaja mest'." The plot involves a mountain king who banishes his son from his kingdom so that he can have his daughter to himself. One hears Gogolian echoes replete with horrific images of bloodletting, rape, murder, vengeance and retribution: Злой горный король напал на мать мою снежной метелью. А когда у матери родилась мне сестра, злой горный король напал на мать мою снежной метелью. Он унес сестру, потому что род наш несет проклятие высям, и горный злой король, похищая сестру тою снежной метелью, этим верным залогом, хотел задавить горами наш род.31 Elsewhere in works such as the "Fourth Symphony," better known as "Kubok metelej," mystical love is tainted by seduction and bondage. The symphony contains a sub-chapter entitled "Koldun," which exploits Gogol"s plot. There, shorly after seducing the heroine, the delirious Adam Petrovič sees in a vision his beloved under the spell of a sorcerer, her husband. Naturally, she resembles Katerina, at the moment her soul is conjured by her father in the presence of Danilo, her husband.32 While Gogol"s landscapes with maidens floating in the air are often couched in dreams, in Belyj's suprasensible world, free-floating people and objects appear to the higher vision of the clairvoyant. Some have treated "Kubok metelej" (along with "Kust" and "Gornaja vladičica") as a roman à clef, with Belyj in the role of Adam and Blok in the role of the koldun, based on their amorous intrigues with Ljubov* Blok; nevertheless, Belyj clearly had "Strašnaja mest" in mind when he depicted the battle between the two suitors for the beloved.33 76</page><page sequence="7">Belyj himself admitted that Serebrjanyj golub' was written under the spell of Gogol"s Dikanka tales.34 Here manifestations of the sorcerer are associated with Kudejarov, the "kudesnik," who is portrayed casting a spell around his adepts, the Doves.35 Although Kudejarov is Matrena's common-law husband, he still occupies a patriarchal role. Impotent, he seeks out a surrogate for himself in the sexual act, and persuades Dar'jal'skij to impregnate Matrena with the Dove child, thus creating the new Messiah. Although Kudejarov keeps a voyeuristic eye on the couple, he discovers that their trysts involve more than merely coupling for the sake of a spiritual cause. Kudejarov becomes jealous and plots to kill Dar'jal'skij, at the same time as Dar'jal'skij attempts to escape from the Doves. This is indeed Gogol"s territory par excellence. Filling the role of Gogol"s Katerina is Katya, the young maiden whom Dar'jal'skij abandons for Matrena.36 Dar'jal'skij senses the force of the past weighing upon him - he has no control over his actions. Just before his death, Dar'jal'skij realizes that he is involved in a struggle with an occult force. With the appearance of his most well-developed sorcerer in the Moscow novels, Belyj likewise devotes more space to the subject of sorcery. The villain Mandro not only vividly recalls Gogol"s sorcerer, but his dramatic life appears to improve upon Gogol's depiction.37 Dissatisfied with the way Gogol' had failed at reconciling his sorcerer with his deeds, Belyj took the opportunity to play the role of the bandurist, although with a different epilogue. He too depicts one of the world's "greatest sinners," one whose manifold transgressions included murdering wives and children, raping a daughter, and torturing victims. Belyj, however, gives his criminal a second chance. Agonizing over the power of a character as diabolical as Mandro to dominate his novels, Belyj nevertheless could not refrain from playing out this depiction to its desired end. Klavdija Bugaeva employs the term "vopreki vole avtora" with regard to Mandro's willful longevity. For example, Mandro dies at the end of Moskva, only to be resurrected in Maski. While Belyj gives an unconvincing explanation for this, he clearly had a great deal more to say about his villain, who grew before his eyes "uncontrollably."38 Perhaps Belyj impulsively resurrected the villain in order to display the workings of karma: Mandro not only pays the penalty for his actions but also comprehends his misdeeds so that they may never be repeated. In Maski Mandro loses his status as a thoroughly demonic character whose heinous crimes far surpass those of Gogol"s sorcerer, a change which can be interpreted through an understanding of karma. Indeed, Mandro actively sets 77</page><page sequence="8">out to reverse his karmie debt once he recognizes that his past deeds stem from cumulative acts of previous lives. On one level, the Moscow novels deal with Professor Korobkin's refusal to sell his mathematical equations to the businessman and spy Mandro, as a result of which he is tortured by the villain. On another level, Belyj clearly uses what by now can be called a "Gogol' text" in order to renew and resurrect a Gogolian motif, namely, that of the demonic sorcerer.39 Superficially, the features of both sorcerers are uncanny. Both murdered their wives and abandoned their young daughters. After spending many years abroad, Gogol"s sorcerer finds Katerina married, which does not deter him from tring to seduce his daughter. Belyj's Mandro, too, has spent much time travelling, and upon his return to Moscow he rapes his unmarried daughter, Lizaša. Both betray their respective motherlands: Mandro is a spy for the Germans, while Gogol"s sorcerer works for the Poles. In both works one senses the grim role of fate, where neither Gogol"s sorcerer nor Mandro acts of his own volition. As Ada Steinberg illustrates, the similarity between Mandro and Gogol"s sorcerer extends to the structure of both works as well. As the sorcerer's past life is narrated at the end of the story, so Mandro's past is presented at the end of Part II of the novel. We learn how he entered upon his path of sin. A certain von Mandro engaged him, a poor, neurotic boy, 'for insignificant services' for himself, adopted him. [...] In Rome he raped a boy and stabbed him to death. [...] Mandro joins the Jesuit order merely because the Jesuit Lacrimanti knows of his crime and can give him away. Thus begins Mandro the "pawn's" service to the Jesuits, the masons and Doctor Donner.40 Whereas Gogol"s depiction of the sorcerer offers no hope, Belyj hoped to make his "koldun" figure a vision of redemption. In the first volume of the Moscow novels Mandro acts as a pawn, very much like Gogol"s sorcerer.41 All of his evil deeds seem to be preordained, as are his predestined victims. Even Lizaša perpetuates the need for vengeance, a sort of balancing of accounts, by trying to kill her son, who is also her brother. The reader anticipates both Lizaša's rape and Korobkin's torture in various images of bestial savagery. These acts can be interpreted as manifestations of Mandro's past lives, evidence of which appears in depictions of 78</page><page sequence="9">defunct civilizations. One of Mandro's incarnations appeared on the lost continent of Atlantis (II, 157). Mandro is a composite of Aztec, Javanese, and Malaysian (II, 179). He is associated with ancient civilizations which practiced human sacrifices: depicted as an Aztec with bright feathers, named Mandloppl, he revels in blood sacrifices (II, 138); he seems to be acting out the impulses of Dr. Donner (II, 148-150). Mandro resembles a blood-sucking vampire to his daughter (II, 141). Moreover, Belyj illustrates the force of shared karma, insofar as all the characters' deeds have an effect on the larger, apocalyptic backdrop of the cosmos. In the decrepit atmosphere of Moscow lurks an apocalyptic foreshadowing of doom. Like many previously flourishing civilizations known to have reached great heights of culture only to decay and disappear (whether Assyrian, Babylonian, Sumerian, or Aztec), Moscow too will fall. Belyj is fond of using imagery of prédation and of setting his scenes in pre-history, where mammoths, gorillas and orangutans and prehistoric beasts share the earth with humans. We hear sounds of wailing mammoths (41); we see cannibals. Other amendant primitive locations are the Papuan Islands, Easter Islands, Malaysia. These locales serve as a backdrop to Mandro's bestiality - he is depicted emerging from a cave in animal skins. Primitive life forms, whether from before the Great Deluge or from a more recent past when Aztec priests performed sacrificial rites, are all manifestations of Mandro's past lives, the lives through which his karma acts. As long as Mandro lacked the will power to change the murderous patterns recurring throughout his past lives, he destroyed for the sake of destruction. (II, 162) Maski dramatizes Mandro's efforts at reversing his karma, particularly in the final pages, where Mandro, just before reconciling with his daughter, recognizes the vileness of his past for the first time. The tables turn when Mandro recalls with horror raping his daughter and torturing Korobkin. He perceives himself as the sum of his previous incarnations, such as Napoleon, Marquis de Sade and various other criminals: Мандро - сумма всех воплотимых варьяций; [...] модуляции - Наполеона, бушмена, убийцы родителей, - Kappa; и - Mappa! [...] гадил, резал, насиловал, падал [...] О, верните ее! Дайте только возможность вернуться, - начать! Дайте только возможность сказать: "Я, Лизаша, теперь, неувиденное всею жизнью всей смертью увидел, чтоб жить!" (387) 79</page><page sequence="10">Memories of previous lives remind him of the debt he has to pay in life. They also remind him that before his rebirth he was dead; with new vision he can live, that is, his soul will live in peace. Korobkin himself utters the principles of karma when he explains to Lizaša that her father's violations were not acts of volition; rather, Mandro was fulfilling the destiny of his soul: Дело ясное; эти побои его адресованы были не мне-с; и - не он наносил. [...] События эдакие с точки зрения высших возможностей - тени-с прохожего облака. (363)42 Mandro recognizes his guilt and proceeds to reestablish a bond with his daughter, with the help of Korobkin. By accepting responsibility for his actions, by seeking forgiveness, by coming face to face with his victims, Mandro escapes the wheel of unenlightened repeated lives. The forces of action and reaction, merit and demerit assume for the first time in Belyj's novels a moral imperative. Belyj confessed to Mejerxol'd that "all my life I live Gogol', love him, and meditate upon him,"43 but he still sought an avenue wherein Gogol' could be corrected. Belyj's lifelong adulation of his "master" resulted not in imitative echoes of Gogol"s themes and haunting rhythmic cadences, but in a renewed and resurrected Gogol'. NOTES 1.

One must recall that by the time Belyj wrote "Gogol"' he was already, like most of his fellow Silver Age colleagues, well-versed in the teachings of the occult. Long before Belyj became an anthroposophist, he frequented circles where discussions of Blavatsky, Besant and Böhme, Yoga and yogis, tarot, neo- Platonism and countless eastern philosophies were simply in the air. 16.

Belyj's views on karma and reincarnation are strewn throughout his middle and later writings. Few works can compare with his collection of anthroposophical poery, Zvezda , and with KotikLetaev for discussions of karma. As for the actual mention of "karma," one encounters this term in his letters, his memoirs, his essays, etc. A few cases in point are the following: 1) In his 37- page letter to Ivanov-Razumnik, the word "karma" arises during his account of his "threshold" experience in Norway where he becomes an adept of Steiner. This anthroposophical phase is punctuated by the sense that "karma acts," which essentially means that he was predestined to meet Steiner, predestined to devote himself to anthroposophy, predestined to imitate the life of Christ. See "Andrej Bely: Lettre autobiographique à Ivanov-Razumnik," in "Trois documents important pur l'étude d'Andrej Belyj," G. Nivat, Cahiers du monde russe et soviétique, XV, no. 1-2, 1974, p. 72; 2) in his article on Tolstoj, "Učitel' soznanija (Lev Tolstoj)," Znamja , No. 6 (Dec. 1920), pp. 37-41, Belyj compares the significance of The Bhagavad Gita to Tolstoj's O žizni with an understanding of karma; 3) in his Počemu ja stal simvolistom (Ann Arbor, 1982) Belyj discusses the importance of karma with relation to Moskva : " Moskva pozdnej podymala ideju karmy i problemu otnošenija nisšego 'Ja,' к 'Ja' sobstvenno." (p. 75) 23. Rudolf Steiner, Theosophy , trans. H.B. Monges (New York: Anthroposophie Press, 1971), p. 89. 24. Elsewhere karma has been equated with the law of conservation of energy, which decrees that no energy is lost, or Newton's third law of motion, which states that every action has its reaction. See Joe Fisher, The Case For Reincarnation, New York (Bantam Books: 1985), p. 2. Moreover, this law of merit and demerit is fundamental not only in all Oriental philosophy, but was also preached by St. Paul: "Brethren, be not deceived. God is mocked, for whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also reap." 82</page><page sequence="13">25. The principal characters in this Hindu text are Arjuna and Krishna, manifestations of the human and divine in the universe. Arjuna, having to face the prospect of killing his relatives on the battlefield, seeks counsel from Krishna, who instructs his student in the ways of karma, the laws of action and reaction. 26. That man and the universe was to experience a conflagration before the Second Coming was a given not only to adepts of Steiner, but virtually to all students of Eastern philosophies. Eschatological thought had long attended the personal philosophies of the Symbolists, Russian and West Eurpean alike. 27.

Bloke (Moscow-Berlin, 1922); reprint: Munich, 1969, p. 263. 29. Ronald E. Peterson, too, discusses this story's ties with "Strašnaja mesť." See his Andrei Bely's Short Prose (Birmingham, 1980), p. 39. Peterson treats its biographical underpinnings, with Belyj in the role of the fool and Ljubov' Blok the maiden; the bush was supposed to be Blok. 30. For instance, not only does nature seem to be engaged in a narcissistic embrace with itself, but in explicit terms the bush rapes the earth. In Belyj's anthropomorphic and folkloric world inanimate objects have the power of transmogrifying into animate beings. The image of the bush violating the earth also calls to mind the anthropomorphization that takes place in GogoF's Dikanka tales. Moreover, Belyj's image of the bush is carried over into Serebrjanyj golub', where a menacing omnipresent bush metamorphoses into evil incarnate. The bush resembles a wanderer who keeps walking but never reaches its destination. 31. Andrej Belyj, Rasskazy , ed. Ronald Peterson (Munich: Wilhelm Fink Verlag, 1979), p. 85. Another subtext that must have entered into "Gornaja vladičica" was Hans Christian Andersen's "The Snow Queen." 32. A Belyj, "Kubok metelej.

It also recalls yet another text, St. John's Revelation, where St. Michael battles the Dragon. 34. John Elsworth reminds us that Belyj's debt to Gogol' in Serebrjanyj golub ' "has been noted by practically every critic who has commented upon the novel." See his Andrey Bely: A Critical Study of the Novels (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1983), p. 83. 83</page><page sequence="14">35. As Močul'skij maintains, Kudejarov is a "koldun s durnym głazom, tkuščij vokrug sebja pautinu černoj magii." Op. cit., p. 164. On the other hand, Dar'jal'skij resembles Gogol"s sorcerer, too, particularly in his attire, his red shirt, reminding us of the sorcerer's "krasnyj župan." See Nikolaj Gogol', Op. cit., p. 223. 36. See Maria Carlson, "The Silver Dove," Andrey Bely: Spirit of Symbolism, ed. John Malmstad (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1987), p. 75. 37. According to Papernyj, in addition to the sorcerer as prototype for Mandro, there are also the figures Vij, Rostovščik, Xlestakov. Papernyj maintains that Cičikov is an even more powerful analogue for Mandro. See his "Andrey Belyj i Gogol'. Stat'ja tret'ja," Op. cit., p. 53. Long before Papernyj, 2. Él'sberg devoted a thorough study to the pervasive similarities between Belyj and Gogol'. See 2.
