<plain_text><page sequence="1">E. Pauline Degenfelder YOKNAPATAWPHAN BAROQUE: A STYLISTIC ANALYSIS OF AS I LAY DYING A S I LAY DYING, PUBLISHED IN 1930, represents in microcosm Faulkner's encounter with and solution to the problems of the twentieth-century artist.' On the one hand, Faulkner acknowledges the modern breakdown of communication and the relative isolation of human experience through his use of the interior monologue. Conversely, by creating the mythical Yoknapatawpha County, Faulkner supplies a vision of cultural unity and a counterstatement to the contemporary dissolution of commonly held beliefs. This thematic dialectic between isolation and involvement has been amply acknowledged by the novel's commentators. William Van O'Connor, for example, states that the theme divides the characters "into those who accept the bitterness and violence of living and those who do not"^; Irving Howe labels the novel a blend of "human tragedy and country farce"3; and Michael Millgate points out that horror and comedy coexist in a "macabre manner" in the work.4 Melvin Backman extends these comments by attributing the novel's dualities to the multiple point of view, ambiguity of theme and symbolism, and suggestive treatment of character and event.5 The major shortcoming of these analyses, however, is their failure to relate fully the novel's complexity to its variant styles. Irving Howe, for example, acknow- ledges only one style, indigenous "American lyricism."^ Although both Olga Vickery and Cleanth Brooks distinguish between the styles accorded to conversation and to interior monologue, and although Mrs. Vickery points to the novel's range from "realistic and colloquial" style to a "symbolic" mode 7 such descriptive STYLE: Vol. VII, Spring 1973, No. 2 121</page><page sequence="2">122 E. PA ULINE DEGENFELDER tags are incomplete and ambiguous. Even an exclusively stylistic study, such as Warren Beck's, which mentions specific features such as "full sentence structure," lapses into qualitative description: "Side by side with [the] richly interpretive style there exists ... a realistic colloquialism."8 Such subjective comments, in otherwise illuminating essays, overlook the unique features of Faulkner's style and point, more- over, to the absence of any generally accepted procedure in discussing style. As Louis T. Milic has defined the problem, "stylistics . . . has for most scholars still no method beyond the method of impressionistic description and a vague use of rhetoric"; a solution to this shortcoming, also proposed by Milic, consists in describing stylistic features in "concrete and verifiable terms, which finally means, in quantitative terms. Consequently, this analysis of style in As I Lay Dying will focus on syntax and diction and will utilize recent developments in generative and trans- formational grammars. Such a discussion, in turn, will demonstrate the stylistic differentiation which underlines, and brings about, the thematic tension between the isolated individual, particularly the artist, and the integrated community. In general, Faulkner employs two basic styles in the novel, either separately or simultaneously, depending upon the identity and complexity of the speaker. To dramatize the individual's alienation from the community, Faulkner uses a baroque style; to depict the solidarity of the community's folk, he utilizes a colloquial mode. Both styles- the baroque and the colloquial- Faulkner has mentioned implicitly in his fiction and criticism. The baroque mode, for example, appears in Mosquitoes (1927), where the statue of Andrew Jackson, "bestriding the terrific arrested plunge of his curly balanced horse" is characterized as " baroque plunging stasis" (italics mine).^® Clearly, this peculiar combination of motion and stasis antedates and foreshadows the baroque style in As I Lay Dying, in which, claims Hyatt Waggoner, the image of Jewel and his horse provides "the stylistic key to the vision that shapes the novel." Of the second mode, the colloquial, Faulkner has been more conscious, acknowledging his debt to the writer generally considered the exemplar of colloquial style: "In my opinion, Mark Twain was the first truly American</page><page sequence="3">YOKNAPATAWPHAN BAROQUE 123 writer, and all of us since are his heirs, we descended from him."1 2 Furthermore, Faulkner explicitly recognized the need to diversify styles. In his lectures at the University of Virginia, he stated that style "to be alive . . . must be in motion. ... If it becomes fixed then it's dead, it's just rhetoric. The style must change according to what the writer is trying to tell. What he is trying to tell in fact compels the style."13 To Faulkner, expression and content are inseparable. Style, then, is not a matter of linguistic choice; that is, Faulkner implies that the same thought cannot be expressed in alternate linguistic constructions, but rather that the medium is the message.14 The fact that Faulkner values the "motion" of style also explains why he assigns his most perceptive characters a baroque style in As I Lay Dying, for this medium can most effectively reflect the restless energy of human imagination. The novel is composed of fifty-nine sections, with a total of fifteen speeches by varying characters. The distribution of the sections is varied.15 The majority of the monologues belong to the Bundren family, and the second son, Darl, is assigned the greatest number of sections. This high incidence for Darl occurs since he is the most articulate, and disturbed, member of the family, and since he attempts to resolve his dilemma in terms of language. Cash occupies an intermediate position in number of sections assigned because he represents a balance between words and deeds. Jewel and Addie, who claim to eschew words, are assigned only one section each. Although the community receives only slightly more than a quarter of the sections, its presence is maintained for several reasons. First, since men like Samson, Armstid, Mosely, and MacGowan remain fixed in their respective locations, they help to record the stops the Bundrens make on their journey toward Jefferson. Secondly, the community's presence offers absolute norms of value against which to measure the Bundrens' endeavors. In their outrage at Addie's putrefying body, for example, the folk place the Odyssey in a comic perspective. Lastly, the communal characters provide the reader with infor- mation the family otherwise distorts or suppresses. Tuli, for example, narrates directly and factually the attempted river crossing. The only other account is Darl's emotive response which tends to obscure the events.</page><page sequence="4">ļ 24 E. PA ULINE DEGENFELDER Chronologically, Tuli remains in the novel until his mules drown, and the incident demonstrates the community's willing- ness to aid the Bundrens. His wife, Cora, is both community member and Addie's acquaintance; hence, her commentary is both representative and personal. These biases appear in her death-watch monologues. In analyzing Cora's syntax and that of other characters, and in determining how Cora's utterances con- stitute the colloquial mode, I shall use two methods. The first is Francis Christensen's mode of determining grammatical structure by considering the levels of statement and their constituent constructions. Layers of structure are indicated by indenting each unit and numbering the levels. Throughout this analysis, I shall use the following abbreviations of syntactical structures: SC (subordinate clause), RC (relative clause), NC (noun cluster), VC (verb cluster), AC (adjective cluster), A + A (adjective series), Abs (absolute), and PP (prepositional phrase). While Cora sits by Addie's bed, her reflections are at odds with the funereal context. Her paramount concern is her dis- appointing failure to sell some cakes a town matron ordered. These thoughts, in turn, trigger related reflections: "We could have stocked cheaper chickens, but I gave my promise as Miss Lawing- ton said when she advised me to get a good breed because Mr. Tuli himself admits that a good breed of cows or hogs pays off in the long run." Using Christensen's method, the following pattern results: (1) We could have stocked cheaper chickens, (1) but I gave my promise (2) as Miss Lawington said when she advised me to get a good breed (SC) (2) because Mr. Tuli himself admits that a good breed of cows or hogs pays off in the long run. (SC) Structural analysis reveals that the texture of Cora's sentences, and of colloquial sentences in general, is relatively thin and bare, that is, few levels are added to the main one, and the nouns and verbs of the main level are not particularly enriched by the additions that do occur. The plainness of Cora's style contrasts markedly with the density of Darl's utterances, which will be analyzed</page><page sequence="5">YOKNAPATAWPHAN BAROQUE 125 later in this essay. ^ The thin texture of Cora's sentence likewise corresponds to a marked superficiality of ideas. The use of "as" implies that levels (1) and (2) are related in a cause-effect structure, but it is difficult to ascertain the connection between Miss Lawington's advice (2) and the granting of the promise (1). One possibility is that Miss Lawington made the first comment ("we could have stocked cheaper chickens") and that the promise was made to "Mr." Tuli. Another possibility is that both Mr. Tuli and Miss Lawington suggest that Cora purchase a good breed. The ambiguity of Cora's intention results from the word "as." Cora seems to use "as" as a causative which is equated with "because," but "as" could also function as a time-marker. This ambiguity is compounded by Cora's jump from point to point and her disregard for unity of subjects. The passage remains vague even when other statements in the paragraph are examined: (1) So I saved out the eggs and baked yesterday. (1) The cakes turned out right well. (1) We depend a lot on our chickens. The beginning of the paragraph (quoted above) matches the end- "So I baked yesterday, more careful, than ever I baked in my life, and the cakes turned out right well"- but without interior de- velopment or regard for chronology. Incoherence is added to circumlocution. The use of "so" leads the reader to expect a result, but in actuality the second sentence is the result of the first, and the third sentence is a tangential comment prompted by the mention of "eggs" in the first sentence. Yet, Cora's speeches do serve to reflect the geographical verisimilitude of dialect. Her passages clearly contain the features commonly associated with colloquial style: concreteness of diction ("chick- ens," "cows," "hogs"); minimal qualification of nouns ("cheaper," "good"); elimination of long words; emphasis on commonplace words; absence of fresh metaphors ("long run"); repetition of individual words ("good breed") and of sound ("cheaper chickens," "get-good"); and parallel structures. Cora's passages, an effective simulation of oral and extemporaneous speech, exemplify colloquial</page><page sequence="6">i 26 E. PA ULINE DEGENFELDER style unrelieved by other modes and thus help to define the community to which she belongs. Another method of measuring the complexity of syntax is to examine what the transformational grammarians19 call "the deep structure of a statement; that is, to determine what verbal transformations have occurred before the sentence reaches its final form. I shall show how "embedded sentences" precede the finished statement by reconstructing the constituents which com- pose the sentence. In Cora's comments, the following transfor- mations occur: We could have stocked cheaper chickens (the chickens are cheaper) . . . advised me to get a good breed (the breed is good) ... a good breed of cows or hogs pays off (a breed of cows is good a breed of hogs is good) in the long run (the run is long) The transformations are few and of the same adjectival ("a good breed") or conjoining ("cows or hogs") patterns. These facts account for Cora's lack of linguistic agility. Her use of the same adjective for chickens, cows, and hogs contributes to confusion of ideas but is characteristic of the colloquial conversational tone, which depends partially on repetition for its effect. Cora's use of the dead metaphor, which requires a transformation to reveal a once-effective tenor-vehicle relationship, further indicates her conventionality. At the other end of the linguistic continuum from Cora is Darl, whose elaborate and perceptive comments employ a complex syntax. Observing Dewey Dell, whose secret only he knows, he remarks, "She sets the basket into the wagon and climbs in, her leg coming long from beneath her tightening dress: that lever which moves the world; one of that caliper which measures the length and breadth of life" (pp. 97-98). The syntactic structure of Darl's remark has the following pattern:</page><page sequence="7">YOKNAPATAWPHAN BAROQUE 127 (1) She sets the basket into the wagon and climbs in (2) her leg coming long from beneath her tightening dress (Abs, PP) (3) that lever which moves the world (NC) (3) one of that caliper which measures the length and breadth of life (NC, PP) Having accepted the conventions of colloquial dialect which Faulkner has established in other sections of the novel, the reader is jarred by Darl's metaphysical speculations. Such syntax and diction are clearly not a realistic duplication of untutored rustic speech. Instead, Darl's passage reveals those features which Morris Croll and T. S. Eliot have defined elsewhere as baroque.2® First, Darl's thoughts concerning Dewey Dell's womanhood are transferred into images ("tightening," "caliper"), so that he is apprehending thoughts sensuously, transmuting concepts into sensations.2 ^ Also baroque are Darl's startling juxtapositions of opposites ("the length and breadth of life," life and death) and his facile manipulation of space, whereby he can project himself into the logically impossible position of observing the world from the outside ("that lever which moves the world"). Darl's dense sentence structure is also a baroque feature. It is composed of numerous additions, these containing within themselves further substructures. The deliberate asymmetry of the sentence members reveals not the logical but the emotional development of the nodal statement. The arrangement, in fact, conforms to the pattern described by Croll as the "loose period," a hallmark of baroque prose: the sentence begins with a statement which is complete in itself, followed by an absolute participle ("her leg coming long"); the symmetry of the sentence is further broken, because each addition is dictated by what immediately precedes it, and no effort is made to recapitulate or restate the opening statement. The purpose of this sentence, and of the loose period in general, is to express, "as far as may be, the order in which an idea presents itself when it is first experienced."22 A final feature of the baroque sentence is an ending which frequently presents "a vision of vast space or time, losing itself in an altitudo, a hint of infinity"23; likewise, Darl's passage progresses from obser- vation of a physical movement ("climbs," "leg") to a metaphysical</page><page sequence="8">1 28 E. PA ULINE DEGEN FELDER speculation on the progress of life through successive generations. The open-endedness, the straining toward obscurity, and the constantly mobile quality of Darl's utterances ally him with the writhing, contorted figures of seventeenth-century baroque sculpture. Besides containing interior complexity, Darl's sentences achieve considerable variety in their inter-relations. The example cited is followed by "She sits on the seat beside Vardaman and sets the parcel on her lap"; the relative rapidity of action signals the end of Darl's suspended perception. At least two of the transformations he uses in the first example are interesting for their departure from "normal" usage. "Her leg coming long" has been derived from "Her leg + comes" + a participial transformation, added to "her leg is long." In constructing his observation, Darl retains something of the original constituents, because he dis- regards the categorical restriction that adjectives do not expand (modify) verbs or participles. Darl expresses the conjunction of both motion and description, an effect absent in the possible alternative, "her long leg coming." These effects are likewise achieved in the more conventionally grammatical construction "her tightening dress." In his hypersensitive anxiety, Darl chooses this phrase over one alternative, "her tight dress," because he perceives the world as process, and the course of Dewey Dell's pregnancy as a continual process. At points, Darl's contemplation becomes obsessive, and his syntax reveals a linguistics of madness. Darl records Dewey Dell's response to his knowledge of her pregnancy thus: "Her face is calm and sullen, her eyes brooding and alert; within them I can see Peabody's back like two round peas in two thimbles: perhaps in Peabody's back two of those worms which work surreptitious and steady through you and out the other side and you waking suddenly from sleep or from waking, with on your face an expression sudden, intent, and concerned." (1) Her face is calm and sullen, (1) her eyes brooding and alert; (2a) within them (PP) (2) I can see Peabody's back (2b) like two thimbles; (PP)</page><page sequence="9">YOKNAPA TA WPHAN BAROQUE 129 (3a) perhaps in Peabody's back (PP) (3) two of those worms (3b) which work surreptitious and steady through you and out the other side (SC, PP) (1) and you waking suddenly from sleep or from waking (Abs, PP) (2) with an expression (PP) (2a) on your face (PP) (3) sudden, intent, concerned. (A + A) The density of structure is further accompanied by the multiple transformations which have occurred: her eyes brooding and alert (her eyes are brooding brood + participial transformation, (her eyes are alert) you waking suddenly (you who wake suddenly the waking is sudden wake + participial transformation) Those worms which work surreptitious and steady through you (the work is surreptitious + the work is steady) on your face an expression, sudden, intent, concerned (there is an expression on your face the expression is sudden, the expression is intent, the expression is concerned concern + participial transforma- tion express + nominalization transformation) The high incidence of participial transformations and the one nominalization transformation, all of which are dependent upon verbs for their node, suggests the hyperactivity of Darl's mind as he constantly seeks to define, refine, and advance the thrust of his impressions. His sensibility, disdaining complacency and ease, displays the contortion and purposive extravagances (thimble- eyes-worms) characterized by Morris Croll as baroque traits. The movement from "her" to "you&gt;" indicative of his self-involuted an- xiety, signals his "waking suddenly" from brooding. This tendency</page><page sequence="10">1 30 E. PA ULINE DEGEN FELDER to shift persons, to speak of himself as observer ("you"), be- comes fixed at the conclusion of the novel. In his final speech, Darl's madness is apparent from third-person references to him- self: "Darl has gone to Jackson. They put him on the train" (p. 243). Already in the above passage there is syntactic fore- shadowing of his breakdown. The third level clause ("two of those worms") receives no predicate; the absolute ("you waking suddenly from sleep or from waking") is obscure because of the collocation of the two "wakings." Such syntactic incompleteness and semantic disruption point to Darl's imbalance. Darl's shift from one level to another and the density of his structure are hallmarks frequently associated with Faulkner himself. The similarity between Darl's and Faulkner's syntax can be ascertained by comparing Darl's section to section four of The Sound and the Fury, in which Faulkner drops the interior monologues of the three previous characters to resume his own "voice."24 (1) The day dawned bleak and chill, (2) a moving wall of grey light out of the northeast (NC) (3) which, (4) instead of dissolving into moisture (PP) (3) seemed to disintegrate into minute and venomous particles (RC) (4) like dust that (PP, RC) (5) when Dilsey opened the door of the cabin and emerged (SC) (4) needled laterally into her flesh (5) precipitating not so much a moisture as a substance (VC) (6) partaking of the quality of thin, not quite congealed oil Faulkner's "voice" shares some of the features of Darl's speeches, notably the suspension of forward movement and return to previous levels (the movement of 3 and 4) and the packing of several structures within one layer. Cleanth Brooks, in discussing the changes of the characters' rhetoric m As I Lay Dying , states that "this is one of the conventions which must be accepted in a reading" of the novel,25 but does not offer a rationale for the</page><page sequence="11">YOKNAPATAWPHAN BAROQUE ļļļ practice of this convention. Faulkner intrudes in almost all the characters' sections, with the possible exception of Cora's speeches. Evidently his purpose is not to achieve complete verisimilitude, but rather to aid his characters to communicate insights they might feel but be incapable of articulating. Hence, the relativity achieved by syntactic perspectivism, variety in style, and shifting points of view is modified. Sometimes Faulkner is the omniscient narrator who appears in the guise of his characters. In this capacity he is the omnipresent artist-player who, like his counter- part in Sartoris, simply provides names for the pawns in his game. 2 ^ As Richard Chase comments about As I Lay Dying, "a multiple point of view, if it is multiple enough, of necessity becomes simply the point of view of the omniscient author."2^ Thus, while the novel evidences linguistic perspectivism by the use of differing styles and multiple points of view, at certain points Faulkner's presence is discernible in syntax and diction. Darl, whose abnormality is consistently noted by others, is a character whose style, and thus identity, sometimes approximates Faulkner's. By this similarity, Faulkner suggests the familiar theme of madness allied to genius, a topic he commented on at the University of Virginia: "Who can say just how much of super- perceptivity ... a mad person might not have? . . . It's nice to think that there is some compensation for madness. That maybe the madman does see more than the sane man. That the world is more moving to him.' Paradoxically, however, if one assumes that Faulkner remains relativistic in technique in As I Lay Dying, he is implying through Darl's madness the inadequacy of verbal forms to order and reflect reality, a view which allies Faulkner also with Addie and, by inference, Jewel. As Cash comments, Darl's insanity is a relative matter, in actuality based on the presumptions of others. He recognized that although perception and judgment are subjective, yet when a sufficient number of interpretations coincide, the phenomenon is considered certitude: Sometimes I think it aint none of us pure and none of us pure sane until the balance of us talks him that-a-way. It's like it aint so much what a fellow does, but it's the way the majority of folks is looking at him when he does it. (p. 223)</page><page sequence="12">J 32 E . PA ULINE DEGENFELDER The community's indictment of Darl is as much the product of verbal constructs as are Anse's concept of love or Cora's convictions on sin. As if to underscore the basic subjectivity of judgment, Faulkner assigns to Cash comments on the motif of insanity which are expressed in colloquial dialect (underlined) and diction con- noting uncertainty ("sometimes," "it's like"). Furthermore, Cash uses his carpenter's terminology and his standards of craftsmanship to judge Darl's burning of the barn. Accordingly, Cash condemns Darl's act because "there just aint nothing justifies the deliberate destruction of what a man has built with his own sweat and stored the fruit of his sweat into" (p. 228). Even when Cash ignores the morality of his brother's crime, he uses the craftsman's standards to designate Darl's poor execution of the arson: "A /e//ow-cant get away from a shoddy job" (p. 227). Cash's statements carry the significant form of surface symmetry expected of the artisan. In explaining the reasons for bevelling the coffin, he first imposes order on disparateness by numbering the reasons: I made it on the bevel. 1 . There is more surface for the nails to grip. 2. There is twice the gripping-surface to each seam. 3. The water will have to seep into it on a slant. Water moves easiest up and down or straight across. 4. In a house people are upright two thirds of the time. So the seams and joints are made up-and-down. Because the stress is up-and-down. 5. In a bed where people lie down all the time, the joints and seams are made sideways, because the stress is sideways. 6. Except 7. A body is not square like a crosstie. 8. Animal magnetism. 9. The animal magnetism of a dead body makes the stress come slanting, so the seams and joints of a coffin are made on the bevel. 10. You can see by an old grave that the earth sinks down on the bevel. 1 1 . While in a natural hole it sinks by the center, the stress being up-and-down. 12. So I made it on the bevel 13. It makes a neater job. (pp. 77-78)</page><page sequence="13">YOKNAPA TA WPHAN BAROQUE 133 Cash balances the statements against each other, both in structure and appearance, through the reiterative diction. "There is more surface for the nails to grip" is paired with "There is twice the gripping surface to each seam." "To grip" in the first sentence has an equivalent in the participial transformation "gripping." The structurally similar statements 4 and 5, which are concerned with life, receive their antithesis in statements 9, 10, and 11, which are concerned with the position of coffins. His recapitulation of the topic in statement 1 2 matches his original statement ("I made it on the bevel"), thus rounding out and completing his analysis. This feature of his syntax allies Cash with the colloquial mode; likewise, his diction displays colloquial features- use of dialect, of simple words, of nouns which receive only minimal qualifications, and elimination of long words and emotive words. In addition, Cash's diction and syntax evidence marks of the baroque style- obscurity ("Animal magnetism," "Except"), pictorialism (through numbering), and deliberate asymmetry, both in varying length and grammatical form of the members which constitute this statement. Cash's championing of the principle of balance against surrounding chaos appears most dramatically in his use of mirror- image statements. The loading of the coffin into the wagon Cash reconstructs thus: "It wont balance. If you want to tote and ride on a balance, (1) we will have-" "Pick up. Goddamn you, pick up." "I'm telling you it wont tote and it wont ride on a balance (3) unless-" "Pick up! Pick up, goddamn your thick-nosed soul to hell, (4) pick up!" It wont balance. If they want it to tote and ride on a (5) balance, they will have (p. 90) Here again, Cash blends the colloquial and baroque styles. The verbal and syntactic identity between statements 1 and 5 and 2 and 4 match the parallelism and repetition associated with the colloquial mode; the use of pictorialism to reinforce the meaning of a concept, in this case, "balance," is, as Austin Warren states in his discussion of the emblem, a characteristic of the baroque mode. ^ Despite the structural correspondence, tension and dis-</page><page sequence="14">ļ 34 E. PA ULINE DEGENFELDER order impinge on and break down the surface symmetry of Cash's utterance. His erratic paragraph indentation, the incompleteness of statements, the alteration of the spoken statement (1) to the inarticulated one (5), and the shift from "we" to "they" indicate that Cash's principle of balance has not been unanimously accepted, that it remains functional only for him. As the novel progresses, it is Cash who imposes order on the family journey, and in the end he acts as its spokesman. As an artist, he likewise matures, acquiring the powers of articulation and clairvoyance and developing, as Olga Vickery points out, "a more comprehensive understanding of himself and the world. Unlike Darl, who is totally alienated from his community, and who expresses his isolation in a baroque style, Cash realizes that he must exist both as an individual and as a member of a larger community. Hence, as has been shown, his style is a balance between baroque and colloquial. Cash's position midway between stylistic extremes seems to be one that Faulkner himself ad- vocated. In his lectures at the University of Virginia, he describes himself as a carpenter who recommends careful craftsmanship and conscious choice, just as Cash does in his enumerated reasons for bevelling. Faulkner explains his general aesthetic in terms of carpentry: "He (the writer) uses his material from the three sources [imagination, observation, and experience] as the carpenter reaches into his lumber room and finds a board that fits the particular corner he's building"; and Faulkner parallels his authorship of As I Lay Dying with the carpenter's job: "Now there was the need to use symbolism which I dug around, scratched around in my lumber room and dragged out."3 1 As the novel proceeds, Faulkner increasingly identifies Cash as the sane artist. Conversely, he increasingly pairs Darl with Vardaman, perhaps to indicate Darl's regression to a more im- mature state of mind. In fact, Darl begins his final speech ("Darl has gone to Jackson") by echoing Vardaman's immediately preceding comments about the train ride to and confinement in Jackson ("He had to get on the train to go to Jackson"). Unlike Darl, however, Vardaman avoids insanity. In his lectures, Faulkner confirms Vardaman's sanity, although Vardaman is temporarily unable to distinguish between illusion and reality.32 Yet Vardaman</page><page sequence="15">YOKNAPATAWPHAN BAROQUE ¡35 works out a satisfactory solution to his shock. When first con- fronted with the fact of his mother's death, he attributes it to Peabody's intervention: (1) I can hear the bed and her face and them (1) and I can feel the floor shake (2) when he walks on it (SC) (3) that came and did it. (RC) (3) That came and did it (RC) (4) when she was all right (SC) (3) but he came and did it. (RC) The child's reaction to the recent event is necessarily confused. His initial apprehension comes through sensory associations. Then, as Vardaman exercises selection over his sensations, the shaking of the floor particularizes Peabody as the focal and instrumental individual. Through effective verbal ambiguity, Faulkner has Vardaman link "it" (floor) to "it" (death). The core of anxiety appears in the thrice-repeated clause, which spills from one sentence to another without control. The embedding of the clause "when she was all right" explains the process of Vardaman's horrifying conclusion of Peabody's agency. Like Darl, Vardaman freezes reality. The passage begins in the present tense, for Vardaman is experiencing what is actually a past event as if it were occurring in the present. When he realizes that Addie has somehow changed status, that she is no longer "all right," he shifts to past tense. What at first seems like complex thought because of the presence of several layers of specificity is offset by the monotony of the monosyllables and the lack of variety in the phrasing itself. In attempting to account for the unfathomable phenomenon of his mother's death, Vardaman acquires certainty through reiteration. Vardaman's speech likewise demonstrates how a state of agitation impedes transformation and, hence, expressivity. The constituent "that came and did it" is derived from either "he came" and "he did it" or "it came" and "it did it." Vardaman's use of the ambiguous relative "that," which can function col- loquially as referent for either "he" or "it," reveals his initial uncertainty. After the observation of his mother's health, however, Vardaman's perplexity disappears with the onset of "he came and</page><page sequence="16">1 36 E. PA ULINE DEGENFELDER did it." The cause having been determined, Vardaman seeks to account for the effect, the disappearance of his mother. The style here is somewhat calmer: ( 1) My mother is not in the box. (1) My mother does not smell like that. (1) My mother is a fish. The uniformity of structure- subject ("mother" thrice-repeated), verb, predicate/ complement- is a verbal reassurance of his mother's continuing existence. Vardaman 's rejection of the adult explanation of the phenomenon, indicated by the negative and emphatic morpheme "not," is followed by the emotionally satisfying assertion "My mother is a fish." The declaration itself is almost syllogistic and causes certitude. Now Vardaman speaks not meta- phorically or symbolically of the fish as surrogate for his mother but of what is for him a psychological reality.33 The texture of these sentences is bare, because Vardaman has already resolved his dilemma. The process of his reasoning is delineated in the com- paratively convoluted sentence which precedes: (1) She got out (2a) through the holes I bored (PP, RC) (2b) into the water (PP) (1) I said (1) and (2) when we come to the water again (SC, PP) (1) I am going to see her. Thus Vardaman, by boring holes in the coffin, sees himself as his mother's quasi-savior. In his mind, Addie's liberation results in a change of form to fish, a feasible explanation which helps Vardaman retain his sanity. As if to underline Addie's persisting life, Faulkner introduces her only once, after the trial by water which she has survived. Addie's speech, immediately following Cora's, is significantly placed, for it shows Cora's erroneous judgment in two matters. First, throughout the book, Cora misinterprets Darl's intensity as love for Addie. Yet the reader learns that Darl abandons the coffin and that Jewel and Cash remain with it during the river-</page><page sequence="17">YOKNAPA TA WPHAN BAROQUE 13J crossing. Hence, Cora's comment on Darl- "him the only one of them that had sense enough to get off that wagon"- is an ironic praise of expediency, not love. Secondly, the placement allows Addie to answer the indictment of pride, vanity, and blindness which Cora has levelled at her. Addie, the proponent of deeds, "responds" by discussing her relationship with Anse. Her comments, however, are equally applicable to Cora, because both Anse and Cora depend upon mere verbal forms, like "love" and "salvation" to conceal their hollowness. Addie evaluates Anse's use of language thus: (1) He had a word, too. (2) Love, he called it.

(RC cont'd., PP) Addie then abruptly dismisses Anse's views, as if they merited no further comment. As if to underscore the psychic distance between Addie and Anse, Faulkner casts their utterances into different dialects, as is demonstrated by the following examples: Anse Addie it want to luck It was not over hisself himself I reckon I would think strove tried It not done raining it was over I knowed you are not sick I knew that living was terrible I got a little property I have people I aint got none You haven 't got any ? These differences in pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammar are due to Addie's superior education, her town (rather than country) background, and her greater intelligence. Her section is marked</page><page sequence="18">138 E. PA ULINE DEGENFELDER by clarity in thinking, variety in structure, and adeptness in syntax. Even the syntactical transformations she uses conform to her philosophical distrust of words and thus delete excess verbiage. "I knew that the word was like the others: just a shape to fill a lack" is derived from "that word was just a shape" + "a shape fills a lack." A further distinction between Addie and Anse is Addie's ability to employ more than one mode of expressivity. Colloquial features in her section appear in the use of parallel structure and the marked repetition of certain words and their variants, as in the passage which discusses her relationship with Whitfield (p. 166)- "I believed" (twice), "I would think" (five times), "terrible" (three times), "sin" (eight times). At the same time, baroque characteristics occur in Addie's pictorialism to express her state of "unvirginity" and her appropriating the doctrine of the divine Incarnation^ to her own situation; for her the defective word "love" becomes flesh and is consequently redeemed in the persons of her favored children, Cash and Jewel. Lastly, Addie's frequently complex sentence structure evinces the baroque characteristics of syntactical asymmetry, of a thought progression by which the first member is a logically self-contained statement and subsequent members extend the statement imagi- natively, and of obscure conclusion: (1) I would lie by him in the dark, (2) hearing the dark land talking of God's love and His beauty and His sin; (VC, VC) (2) hearing the dark voicelessness in which the words are deeds, (VC, RC) (3) and the other words that are not deeds, (RC) (4) that are just the gaps in peoples' lacks, (RC) (5) coming down like the cries of the geese out of the wild darkness in the old terrible nights, (VC, PP) (5) fumbling at the deeds like orphans to whom are pointed out in a crowd two faces and told, (VC, RC) (6) That is your father, your mother, (RC) Despite the fact that Addie ostensibly rejects words as a sign of duplicity and emptiness, her section reveals that she, too,</page><page sequence="19">YOKNAPATAWPHAN BAROQUE 139 exploits language. Not only is her section comparatively lengthy, but she, who shuns words, uses "word"/"words" twenty-two times in her passage. She argues that her exclusive love for Cash and Jewel is justified since they are the word become flesh through deeds. In reality, her division among her children is coldly cal- culating: "I gave Anse Dewey Dell to negative Jewel. Then I gave him Vardaman to replace the child I had robbed him of. And now he has three children that are his and not mine" (p. 168). This passage suggests that Addie herself is responsible for the schizophrenia within the family. Darl is the child most dis- astrously affected by this family environment. When he is born, Addie repudiates him and then rejects Anse by asking to be buried among her own people in Jefferson. Like Quentin Compson in The Sound and the Fury, Darl, who is victimized by lack of mother love, states, "I cannot love my mother because I have no mother" (p. 89); furthermore, he is the only character in the novel who clearly perceives Addie's deceitfulness, the gap that separates her words and her deeds. In her relationship with her husband, Addie's assessment of Anse seems fair, especially since it is supported by the community's comments on his lassitude and his abuse of his children. Anse's own sections are filled with self-seeking concerns, platitudes, and rationalizations. Yet, there is some evidence that Addie has unmanned Anse. She is a rustic Delilah who orders her Samson to get sheared: "If you've got any womenfolks, why in the world don't they make you get your hair cut?" (p. 162).35 Addie declares that when she married Anse he died, and she may be another example of Faulkner's domineering and enervating females. In Sartoris, similar phrasing occurs to describe Bayard Sartoris' submission to women: "He had been so neatly tricked by earth, that ancient Delilah, that he was not aware that his locks were shorn, was not aware that Miss Jenny and old Bayard were wonder- ing how long it would be before they grew out again. 'He needs a wife,' was Miss Jenny's thought, 'then maybe he'll stayed sheared' " (p. 171). Addie's linguistic adeptness furthers her insidious influ- ence over her family, making her a formidable character indeed. Addie's passage is followed by that of Whitfield. Addie's evaluation of him as a person for whom salvation is a matter of</page><page sequence="20">140 E . PA ULINE DEGENFELDER words is verified by Whitfield's peroration. His style, basically oratorical, is a substyle of the colloquial and is marked by those characteristics which Bridgman states are common to oratory and colloquialism- exclamations, repetitions, accumulations of syno- nyms, and rhetorical emphases. (1) "Just let me not perish (2) before I have begged the foregiveness of the man (SC) (3) whom I betrayed," (RC) (1) I prayed; (1) "let not the tale of mine and her transgression come (2a) from her lips (PP) (2b) instead of mine.(PP) (3) She had sworn then that she would never tell it, (RC) (3) but eternity is a fearsome thing to face: (4) have I not wrestled (5) thigh to thigh with Satan myself? (Abs, PP) (1) let me not have also the sin of her broken vow upon my soul. (1) Let not the waters of Thy Mighty Wrath encompass me (2) until I have cleansed my soul (SC) (3) in the presence of them (PP) (4) whom I injured." (RC) The highly wrought structural formality of the opening clauses is disrupted by the asymmetry created by the interior clauses, making visible the presence of two counter-movements. Whitfield easily falls into the repetitive pattern of Bible-belt exhortation, whose lulling effect obscures the real cause of his concern, i.e., the fear that Addie may break her vow, compounding the crime of their infidelity by the revelation of his duplicity. Like Dimmesdale in Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter , Whitfield reasons that only when publicly articulated does the crime have final verification. The passage is both oratorical and baroque, and incorporates the differences which Croll points out between the two styles.37 The oratorical strain appears in the carefully revised, circular arrange- ment, whereby subsequent members refer back to and emphasize the central member, "Just let me not perish," by means of repetition and parallel structure. The interior members, however, display baroque characteristics since they differ structurally from previous members and since they give the illusion of advancing without premeditation, each addition being the response to</page><page sequence="21">YOKNAPATAWPHAN BAROQUE ]4j the previous member and not to the central thought. The break in the formal tempo and syntax into the baroque imbalance reveals the source of Whitfield's anxiety. The statements concerning Addie are structurally subordinate, corresponding to the conceal- ment of their relationship. Also subordinate are "whom I injured" and "whom I betrayed." This placement, along with the insistent use of the hortative "let me" and the morpheme "not," discloses that Whitfield's approach is dictated by fear of punishment rather than by a genuine desire to repair his transgressions. While Whitfield tries to conceal himself in language, his syntax and diction give him away. His use of a phrase like "thigh to thigh with Satan" is a ludicrous confusing of sexual and spiritual diction, just as his religion has disguised his sexual relationship with Addie. Whitfield's speech is a parody of confessional phrasing. Likewise, his journey through water is a parody of the similar ordeal the Bundrens have endured. Whitfield's volubility and lubricity are calculated to deflect the thrust of his statement from his own guilt to admiration of his rhetorical virtuosity. The ending of his peroration, revealed through transformations, attests to his linguistic skills and accounts for his ability to move an audience: Let not the waters of Thy Mighty Wrath (Thy Wrath is compared to water; Thy wrath and water are mighty; the wrath is Thine) encompass me until I have cleansed my soul (the soul is mine, in contrast to the wrath which is Thine) in the presence of them whom I injured (I injured them, they will be present). The high incidence of pronouns reveals Whitfield's sense of self- importance and his presumption of an intimate relationship with God. However, the syntax also contributes to Whitfield's intense awareness of the distance between himself and God- the under- stood "you" and "Thy" are contrasted with "me," "I," "my," thus increasing the sense of God's justice and the devolution of guilt upon himself. Although his passage is highly moving, even the community recognizes Whitfield's speciousness. Vernon Tuli, in commenting on Whitfield's sermonizing, says, "His voice is bigger than him. It's like they are not the same. It's like he is one, and his voice</page><page sequence="22">142 E. PA ULINE DEGEN FELDER is one" (p. 86). Whitfield's theatrical effects are to be contrasted with the oratory of Reverend Shegog, the Negro preacher in The Sound and the Fury: "the voice consumed him, until he was nothing, and they were nothing and there was not even a voice but instead their hearts were speaking to one another in chanting measure beyond the need for words" (p. 367). Whereas Whitfield exalts his own personality, Shegog abnegates his identity. Whereas Whitfield's exploitation of language results in the dissociation of sensibility within himself, Shegog's use of language produces an authentic fusion of hearts with his audience. The syntactic aspect of linguistic forms has two functions in As I Lay Dying. On the one hand, the structure of an individual's utterances reflects the manner in which he confronts and arranges the formlessness of reality in a pattern most useful and significant to him. Thus, the characters who are able to construct significant forms through imagery, such as Darl and Cash, approach the position of the artist. On the other hand, structure is also partially deter- mined by the form that a preconstructed language imposes upon the character, thus forcing him to build his interpretation of reality within the limitation of the language itself. Hence, the structure of a human being's language influences in part the manner in which he views reality. Characters like Cora and Whitfield allow language to control them, Cash and Addie are able to manipulate the language suitable to their views. Darl is both controller and victim of language, and the tensions contained in his syntax are probably the closest approximation in the novel of the artist's problem of expression through, and control by, language. In general, baroque syntax indicates the character's complexity, originality, emotiveness, and alienation. Colloquial style, dependent on predetermined forms, usually marks its practitioners as simple, conventional, complacent, and integrated into the community. A character's choice of diction, as of syntax, is likewise dependent upon the resources of language, revealing his degree of linguistic control and his perspective of reality. Conversely, diction reveals the extent to which language imposes reality on the character. Cora displays the latter tendency to an extreme. Her rigidity of thought is determined by and reflected in needless</page><page sequence="23">YOKNAPA TA WPHAN BAROQUE 143 repetition and verbal sloppiness. The passage quoted at the beginning of this essay comes from a paragraph in which "so" appears eleven times, with a total of three distinct meanings: " So (therefore) after they were going to cost so (degree) much more than Mr. Tuli thought, and after I promised that the difference in the number of eggs would make it up, I had to be more careful than ever because it was on my final say-so (approval) we took them" (p. 6). These prosaic thoughts, juxtaposed with Addie's grim languishing, violate the reader's sense of what lexical fields are appropriate to the decorum of a death-watch. Cora's choice of diction renders her pose of good Christian neighbor a travesty. Because her religious motives are suspect, the exposition of her religious convictions takes on a duplistic character: Because it is not us that can judge our sins or know what is sin in the Lord's eyes. She has had a hard life, but so does every woman. But you'd think from the way she talked that she knew more about sin and salvation than the Lord God Himself, than them who have strove and labored with the sin in this human world. When the only sin she ever committed was being partial to Jewel that never loved her and was its own punishment, in preference to Darl that was touched by God Himself and considered queer by us mortals that did love her. I said, "There is your sin. And your punishment too. Jewel is your punishment. But where is your salvation. And life is short enough," I said, "to win eternal grace in. And God is a jealous God. It is His to judge and to mete; not yours." Cora's diction, highly derivative and unoriginal, is, in fact, a cliche-ridden evangelical interpretation of Addie's condition. Look- ing at the contentive words, and disregarding the function words, we find that "sin" appears five times; "punishment" three times; "judge," "mete" and "know" five times; and "salvation" and "eternal grace" three times. Clearly, Cora considers sin the dominant aspect of reality. For her, life, consisting of "laboring" and "striving" against sin, is inexorably followed by eternal condem- nation or reward. Cora makes a strong distinction between temporality and eternity, allowing no blending of the two time- schemes. Like Mr. Coldfield in Absalom , Absalom !, Cora values benevolent actions not because they serve humanity in present time but rather because they contribute to a spiritual account</page><page sequence="24">144 E. PA ULINE DEGEN FELDER redeemable in the after-life. Hence, the temporal constrictions and the materialism of Cora's religion are reiterated in her oftheard refrain, "I'm bounding toward God and my reward." In the quoted passage, the nature of the addresser-addressee relationship is ironic: Cora is advising Addie that the fallibility of human beings impedes a true knowledge of the nature of sin. Yet, by the end of the section, she appropriates to herself the divine function of judging Addie's sin. The incidence of "I said," giving the sense of Cora's reporting her own speech, points to Cora's self-righteous approbation. Addie, whose ethical code is inde- pendent of traditional religion, also can exploit orthodox rhetoric to her own uses. Thus she adjusts Cora's faulty perception by giving Cora's statements to a highly personal application: Addie, too, will experience a "cross" and "salvation," but her savior through water and fire is Jewel. The affinities between Cora's and Whitfield's notions of reality are reinforced by the similarity in their lexical fields. In his section, Whitfield, a manipulator of language, displays superior adeptness and chicanery, in his use of variants of "sin"- "lie," "outrage," "deception," "betray," "erring," "transgression"- and of "salvation"- "true light," "guidance," "peace," "love," "for- giveness," "mercy," "grace." In fact, the collocates of "sin" define more sharply its nature. However, Brother Whitfield's elaboration, shifting from the harsh "sin" and "lie" to the final variant "erring," euphemistically mitigates and almost dissipates his self-condem- nation. He interprets Addie's timely death as a sign of God's mercy and favor toward the sinner. Although Darl seeks, like Cora, to establish a clear distinction between life and death, his diction is infinitely more complex. For him, states of consciousness are posited only on physical existence: In a strange room you must empty yourself for sleep. And before you are emptied for sleep, what are you. And when you are emptied for sleep, you are not. And when you are filled with sleep you never were ... Yet the wagon is, because when the wagon is was, Addie Bundren will not be. And Jewel is, so Addie Bundren must be. And then I must be, or I could not empty myself for sleep in a strange room. And so if I am not emptied yet, I am is. (p. 76)</page><page sequence="25">YOKNAPA TA WPHAN BAROQUE 145 Darl's distinctions between life and death center linguistically around the synonymous "is," "are," and "fill" and their philo- sophical contrast in "was" and "empty." Perhaps because of the need to assure himself of his own existence, he has developed a hypersensitive interpretation of the persons and events surrounding him. He claims that "I cannot love my mother because I have no mother," a rational explanation supposedly based on Addie's disembodiment. Yet, Darl is unsuccessful in imposing stasis on form. He discovers that verbal constructs are ineffective in con- trolling reality. Though Darl would like to consider Addie dead ("Addie Bundren will not be"), Addie persists through Jewel ("Jewel is, so Addie Bundren must be"). Still later, through a highly complex association, Darl infers that "Jewel's mother is a horse" (p. 89). The movement in the above passage from concrete to abstract diction conveys Darl's inability to fix death or life as physical facts. Though logically reasoned, the utterance, an echo chamber in which Darl loses himself in metaphysical speculation, proves the inadequacy of his linguistic logic. Since Darl is father to the thought of Addie's death, Faulkner allows him, though distant, to construct the deathbed scene. Given Darl's clairvoyance (for example, it is he who discerns Addie's deceit in according Jewel privileges), the reader grants the account plausibility. Furthermore, the descriptions of the absent Darl and the present Peabody coincide, increasing the reader's sense of credibility. Shortly before Addie's death, Peabody describes her eyes as "lamps blaring up just before the oil is gone" and her voice, calling Cash, as "harsh and strong." In Darl's account, Addie calls Cash, her voice "harsh, strong, and unimpaired," and at the moment of death, Her eyes, the life of them, rushing suddenly upon them; the two flames glare up for a steady instant. Then they go out as though someone had leaned down and blown upon them. (p. 47) The similarity in the descriptions points to a similarity between their spokesmen. Both recognize, despite Darl's efforts to the contrary, that death is not "a phenomenon of the body" but "merely a function of the mind- and that of the minds of the ones who suffer the bereavement" (p. 42). This overlapping</page><page sequence="26">146 E.PA V LIN E DEGENFELDER between Darl's and Peabody's comments may indicate the presence of the omniscient author. If Faulkner's repetition in these passages is intentional, the similarity between Peabody and Darl suggests Faulkner's metaphysical ability to impose unity on disparateness, to discover identities between a sane and an insane man, thus bringing the accuracy of these verbal categories into question. The sameness also reinforces the essential loneliness of the characters, for they finally fail to communicate their shared philosophy to each other. Darl's speech reflects his effort to retain sanity by pigeon- holing aspects of time ("was"-"is") and thus being (life-death) into separate verbal categories. His effort resembles Anse's dichotomy between stasis and movement. According to Anse's notions of decorum, man is allied with trees and houses, static objects, but not with the road, which symbolizes a fluid existence. He claims that "the road" has disrupted his order. Presumably "the road" has deflected Cash's occupational interest from farming to car- pentry. In commenting on Darl, Anse blames Darl's mobility on the almost anthropomorphic power of the road: I says to them, he was all right at first, with his eyes full of the land, because the land laid up-and-down ways then; it wasn't till that ere road come and switched the land around longways and his eyes still full of the land, that they begun to threaten out of him. (pp. 36-37) Characteristically Anse blames his own misfortunes not on his indolence, nor his son's confusion on the effect of a schizophrenic family environment, but sees his trials as the particular consequences of living by the road. Unlike Darl, however, Anse can freeze reality. In this respect, his resolute preference for stasis and temporality is personally adequate. Addie, of course, sees no such dichotomy between stasis and flux, between death and life. For her life and death are so continually blending that "the reason for living (is) to stay dead for a long time" (p. 161). Addie regards the living and the dead in the same terms. When Anse fumblingly proposes to her, he hints that her relatives might object to their marrying. Addie answers,</page><page sequence="27">YOKNAPATAWPHAN BAROQUE 147 "But they'll be hard to talk to. . . . They're in the cemetery." "But your living kin," he said. "They'll be different." "Will they? ... I don't know. I never had any other kind." (p. 163) Addie discovers that the artificial distinctions of verbal formulation severely restrict an individual's vitality. Hence Anse, who is already death-in-life, uses words like "love" indiscriminately, to fill a void in his character. Addie expresses the Laurentian concept that words prevent authentic relationships among individuals, that it is only through sensuous relationships such as Blutbruderschaft that artificial verbal barriers collapse. The schoolchildren she whips are the first to partake in this blood knowledge. Later Cash and Jewel, Addie's treasures, enter her circle and share a physical consanguinity. For Addie words are characterized by the vertical stasis of which Anse approves: she says that words go "straight up in a thin line" (p. 165). Conversely, Addie sanctions deeds, for "doing goes along the earth, clinging to it" (p. 165). She makes a choice in favor of life's fluidity. Addie's distinction between "words" and "doing," between "stasis" and "mobility," illuminate Addie's recognition of this polarity ("after a while the two lines are too far apart for the same person to straddle from one to the other") could serve as a metaphoric diagnosis of Darl's condition. Addie's refusal to accept life as stasis extends, as in Darl's case, to the use of verb tenses which Faulkner assigns to her. I should like to focus on the particular use of the verb "to lie" to demonstrate Addie's view of life as a continuum. The words in the novel's title, "as I lay dying," pose several possibilities. "As" is a conjunction whose use normally implies a continuous action; it suggests, moreover, an incompleteness, a dependence upon other statements and, in fact, the entire book, for its meaning. Further- more, the verb "lay," considered in standard dialects as the past tense of "lie," cannot be taken as an indicator of an entirely completed action in this novel for several reasons. First, when coupled with "dying," a present form, the verb takes on a distinctly different quality from an alternative like "when I lay dead." Secondly, throughout the novel the Yoknapatawpha County dialect allows "lay" to function as an alternate form of "lie." This</page><page sequence="28">148 E. PA ULINE DEGENFELDER confusion of "lie" and "lay" may be an indication of the cultural lag in the County, because it is a holdover from nineteenth-century usage whereby the intransitive use of "lay" was considered standard.^ ® Cora describes her own future death as the time when "I lay me down," an echo of the child's prayer. Tuli, in recounting his mother's death, says, "she . . . laid down on the bed and pulled the covers up and shut her eyes" (p. 29). The fish, later a surrogate mother, was "laying in the dust" (p. 30); Anse advises Addie to "lay still and rest" (p. 36). It might be objected that since Addie is a teacher her usage of "lie" would differ, and in fact, except for one expression ("I would lay with Anse again"), all occurrences of the verb in Addie's section are standard. But given Addie's peculiar concept that all of life is a preparation for death, the interpretation of the verb "lay" as present is not implausible. In fact, the time distinctions signalled by verbs are really non-operative for Addie: she "lies" with Anse, a "dead" man, in order to create life. This coincidence of "lie" and "marriage" suggests an interesting historical sidelight on the novel. In "A Modern View of Language," P. K. Saha points out that the word "licgan," from which "lie" is derived, originally meant "to lie down" in the marriage bed."5^ This folk etymology could be applied to As I Lay Dying. Not only does Anse "die" when he marries, but Addie also regards marriage as a type of death. Hence, for her the title could also mean "as I lay in marriage, I underwent death in life." In the chronological sequence of the novel, Addie speaks when she is actually dead several days, attesting to her continuing existence. The novel, then, as its title suggests, can be interpreted as Addie's quasi-biography. Since Addie manipulates language to her own ends, her life consists of "lying," of deception. Yet, since she advocates deeds ("doing goes along the earth"), all of life is "lying," i.e., movement in a horizontal direction. For Addie, time is a flux in which past, present, and future mingle. Time in As I Lay Dying (1930) is Faulkner's fictional parallel to T. S. Eliot's similar statement in Four Quartets ( 1 936): Time present and time past Are both perhaps present in time future, And time future contained in time past ("Burnt Norton")</page><page sequence="29">YOKNAPATAWPHAN BAROQUE 149 The metaphysical quality of seeing the world in flux is a baroque characteristic which partially explains Faulkner's use of certain images. Again, I should like to concentrate on Darl's perception of objects as reflective of his increasing tension between stasis and dynamism. Darl has the ability to suspend continuous motion, to freeze a fluid perception. As has been pointed out, this characteristic Faulkner labels "baroque" in Mosquitoes. Early in As I Lay Dying, Darl describes Jewel's encounter with the horse thus: "Then they are rigid, motionless, terrific, the horse back-thrust on stiffened, quivering legs, with lowered head. . . . They stand in rigid terrific haitus" (p. 12). The incidence of words implying stasis (underlined) and their juxtaposition with diction describing movement increase in the barn-burning episode. Darl, we later learn, has set fire to the barn. His motivation, deliberately ambiguous, is subject to several interpretations. As Olga Vickery states, he may, like the townspeople, be outraged by the putre- faction of his mother's body and the delay of her burial.4 But having observed his hostility toward his mother and his readiness to describe her death, one hesitates to see him as entirely disinterested. I should like to propose also that Darl considers Addie's disappearance necessary to retaining his sanity. The immolation of the body will allow him to replace objects and events in rigid, fixed order, and thus effect a distinct separation between life and death. Faulkner also locates the source of Darl's madness in his inability to impose stasis on objects and persons: "Darl got progressively madder because he didn't have the capacity -not so much of sanity but of inertness to resist all the catas- trophes that happened to the family" (italics mine).41 Increasingly, Darl sees Addie, as does Vardaman, in anthro- pomorphic terms; he believes that he is communicating with Addie, who wants him "to hide her away from the sight of man." His burning of the barn would be justified by Addie's wishes and would be conducive to restoring order. Accordingly, both horse and coffin must be destroyed, because they both represent Addie. When Jewel saves both from the fire, Darl's tension increases. First the horse and then the coffin are subjected to Darl's static perception. They are "isolated out of all reality," set in a Greek frieze or a proscenium. The peacefulness of the scene dissolves</page><page sequence="30">1 50 E. PA ULINE DEGENFELDER first with the horse's appearance and then with the coffin's manifestation: It looms unbelievably tall, hiding him: I would not have believed that Addie Bundren would have needed that much room to lie comfortable in; for another instant it stands upright while the sparks rain on it in scattering bursts as though they engendered other sparks from the contact. Then it topples forward, gaining momentum, revealing Jewel and the sparks raining on him too. . . . This time Jewel is riding upon it, clinging to it, until it crashes down and flings him forward and clear. ... (p. 212) The animation of the coffin and Jewel's victory in affirming existence over annihilation convince Darl of the impossibility of arranging reality in static forms. Fluidity, in form as well as in time, constantly impinges upon him. Other examples of baroque transmutation occur in Darl's association of Addie, Jewel, and Cash with wood. Early in the novel he describes Jewel as a cigar-store Indian with wooden eyes, and the reader's first glimpse of Cash, through Darl, is that of the carpenter standing in a litter of chips. But especially for Darl, forms defy fixation. The "soft gold" boards of the coffin, "bearing on their flanks the smooth undulations of the adze blade," assume their own "volition" later. Peabody, who describes Addie as a "bundle of rotten sticks," nevertheless accords her the dignity "that passeth understanding." But Darl, like the nihilistic Mr. Compson of The Sound and the Fury , thinks of all human endeavors, including the saving of his mother, as the "dead gestures of dolls filled with sawdust" (p. 97). Other characters also display the poetic ability to create images. Addie associates herself with the wild geese; Cash describes the second Mrs. Bundren as a "duck-shaped woman." In view of the obvious differences between the strong-willed Addie and the more domesticated second wife, this bird imagery effectively characterizes their personalities. Sometimes there is a progression from a metaphoric comparison to a literal statement. At the beginning of the novel, Jewel describes Cora and the other death-watchers as harpies ("buzzards"); later, on the journey, buzzards surround the coffin. Addie describes Anse as "a tall bird</page><page sequence="31">YOKNAPATAWPHAN BAROQUE 15 J hunched in the cold weather." After Anse's visit, Samson dis- covers Anse's bird-counterpart in his house: When I walked into the hallway I saw something. It kind of hunkered up when I come in and I thought at first it was one of them got left, then I saw what it was. It was a buzzard. It looked around and saw me and went on down the hall, spraddle-legged, with its wings kind of hunkered out watching me first over one shoulder and then over the other, like a old-baldheaded man. (p. 112, italics mine) Again, the use of similar imagery by different characters indicates Faulkner's presence. Yet, the imagery is suited to rural life, and each character stamps his individual imprint on the images, facts which suggest that the narration retains relativity. A somewhat similar baroque manipulation of form occurs in several instances whereby characters visualize, instead of verbalizing, their reflections. Since Addie claims to distrust words, it is not surprising that she expresses her physical and emotional violation by Anse as a graphic blank on the page: "the shape of my body where I used to be a virgin is in the shape of a and I couldn't think Anse" (p. 165). Like her mother, Dewey Dell visualizes through spaces her loneliness and her pregnancy. In Vardaman's last speech, blanks suggest the auditory effects of silence before sound and the emptiness in the square after the cow lows: "I hear the cow a long time, clopping on the street. Then she comes into the square. She goes across the square, her head down clopping . She lows. There was nothing in the square before she lowed. She goes on, clopping . She lows" (p. 241). Cash's arrangement of his statements concerning balance into obverse reflections of each other and into a pattern which con- forms to his content (p. 90) suggests an emblematic habit of mind similar to that of the seventeenth-century metaphysical poets. The most graphic of Cash's emblems unites sensuous and metaphysical levels of reality in a single image. His representation of the coffin he has constructed occurs in a shape, which medium and message converge. Through this graphic image, Cash states the tension between symmetry and imbalance which he is able to control.</page><page sequence="32">152 E. PA ULINE DEGENFELDER If, as Arnold Hauser states elsewhere, "all art is a game with and a fight against chaos,"42 it is Darl who succumbs to chaos and mad- ness and who thus repfesents the unsuccessful artist. Cash emerges victorious because he successfully effects a compromise between the horizontal and the vertical aspects of reality, between movement and stasis. He advocates bevelling (slanting) as a principle of craft and of life style. Through this perspective, life and death, actuality and mysticism, words and deeds, are constantly blending. Approp- riately, Cash is the family's final spokesman. At the end of the novel, order has been restored. Cash has a vision of the family gathered around the gramophone with their new mother, and this circularity suggests a modified stasis. Yet, concomitant with circularity is the open-endedness of continuing dynamic processes. Dewey Dell's pregnancy suggests that life replaces death in a never-ending cycle. As artist, Cash replaces Darl, who, desperately erecting static form and time, had always to witness their breakdown. Hence, through Darl and Cash, Faulkner suggests that the artist must both retain his private interior vision and must partake of community with other men. Throughout the novel, the repetitiveness and the resultant unity of colloquial speech are counterpoised with the explosive, contorted exuberance of the baroque mode. Faulkner, relativistic in his refusal to endorse a single mode of expressivity, nevertheless can contain and blend disparate styles in an artistic equilibrium.

That Faulkner may have been influenced by baroque sculpture in writing Mosquitoes is indicated in the description of an un- finished statue in the novel: "As you entered the room the thing drew your eyes: you turned sharply as to a sound expecting movement. But it was marble, it could not move ... : motionless and passionately eternal- the virginal breastless torso of a girl, headless, armless, legless, in marble temporarily caught and hushed yet passionate still for escape, passionate and simple and eternal in the equivocal derisive darkness of the world . . . something to trouble the very fibrous integrity of your being" (p. 1 1). ^ ^ William Faulkner; From Jefferson to the World (Lexington: University of Kentucky Press, 1966), pp. 70-71. 1 9 Faulkner at Nagano , ed.

Conversely, frequent or many additions result in a "dense or rich" texture (Ibid., p. 31). Faulkner employs varying densities to individualize his speakers and their Weltanschauung. 1 8 For a discussion of the colloquial style of American writers other than Faulkner, see Richard Bridgman, The Colloquial Style in America (New York: Oxford University Press, 1968). These features are noted on pp. 12, 79, 99, 103, 121.

Eliot "The Metaphysical Poets," Seventeenth Century Prose and Poetry , ed. Alexander M. Witherspoon and Frank J. Warnke (New York: Harcourt, Brace &amp; World, Inc., 1963). ? 1 The colloquial and baroque styles both employ images but in dis- tinctive methods and for different purposes. When Cora mentions "hogs," "chickens," etc., the referent is a concrete, unambiguous object. When Darl refers to an object, he immediately transforms and then embroiders it into a metaphor; thus Dewey Dell's leg becomes a lever, a caliper. Such ingenious elaboration of a figure of speech suggests Darl's tendency toward metaphysical conceit and the humor resulting from such exaggeration. When Dewey Dell, for example, emerges from the river, Darl describes her breasts as "those mammalian ludicrosities which are the horizons and the valleys of the earth" (p. 156). ^Croll, pp. 1071-1075. Bridgman, in characterizing sentences of col- loquial prose, also uses the term "loose" to describe this example from The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (p. 122): "Every lady with a lovely complexion, and perfectly beautiful, and looking just like a gang of real sure-enough queens, and dressed in clothes that cost millions of dollars, and just littered with diamonds." If Christensen's approach is applied to this sentence, the following pattern emerges: (1) Every lady with a lovely complexion (2) and perfectly beautiful, (AC) (2) and looking just like a gang of real sure-enough queens, (VC, PP)</page><page sequence="35">YOKNAPA TA WPHAN BAROQUE 155 (2) and dressed in clothes that cost millions of dollars, (VC,PP) (2) and just littered with diamonds. (VC, PP) This configuration differs significantly from the pattern described by Croll as "loose," since all additions in this sentence refer back to the first level, since they are all coordinate structures, and since they markedly avoid subordination. 23Croll, p. 1075. ~^A11 references to The Sound and the Fury are to the Random House edition, 1956. 2S William Faulkner: The Yoknapatawpha Country , p. 160. 26 p. 303.

His use of the fish in As I Lay Dying illustrates both his instinctive choice of the appropriate "symbol" and the creation of distance between the author and the narrator, Vardaman. Vardaman, un- conscious of symbolism, reaches the conclusion that his mother survives in the form of a fish because this meaning evolves from his actions and his natural surroundings; Faulkner employs the fish because it suggests the wider Christian symbolism and archetypal patterns which underlie this novel.</page><page sequence="36">156 E. PA ULINE DEGENFELDER Austin Warren notes that during the Counter-Reformation the Catholic Church used the doctrine of the Incarnation to justify the sensuousness of baroque art as a "sanctification of the body and the senses" ("Baroque Art and the Emblem," p. 1079). oc I am indebted to P.
