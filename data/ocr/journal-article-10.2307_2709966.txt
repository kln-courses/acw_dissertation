<plain_text><page sequence="1">Augustine and Galileo on Reading the Heavens Eileen Reeves Galileo Galilei's attempt at Scriptural exegesis, the Letter to the Grand Duchess Christina (1615), differs from his other major works for several reasons: its arguments are uncharacteristically ponderous and inconclu- sive, its tone restrained and sanctimonious, its comic value negligible. The issue which it addresses, the relevance of scientific knowledge to Biblical interpretation, is treated in speculative fashion; and until the last pages of the Letter, no astronomical topics are examined, and no proofs are offered. The adversaries which it mentions, certain Florentine clergymen who had contested Copernicanism,I are not subject to the usual ridicule, almost as if ignorance and error were no longer automatic guarantees of Galileo's attention. Most striking of all these anomalies is Galileo's acknowledged dependence upon another thinker: the homage which he pays Saint Au- gustine, unique to this letter, appears greater than the praise accorded other and more appropriate mentors, such as Copernicus, throughout all of his writings. It might even be argued that the peculiar stylistic features of the Letter to the Grand Duchess Christina are borrowed from Au- gustine-since aporias, digressions, and pious conjectures are more char- acteristic of the Church Father than they are of Galileo himself-and that what seems curious and inauthentic in this work is merely the result of a I In particular, two Dominicans, Tomaso Caccini and Niccolo Lorini, had attacked Galileo. For a translation of the Letter and a discussion of their quarrel see three works by Stillman Drake, Discoveries and Opinions of Galileo (New York, 1957), 145-71, 173-216; Galileo at Work (Chicago, 1978), 238-51; "Conflicts with Astronomers and Theologians," in Galileo (New York, 1980), 53-72.

As the present essay will demonstrate, however, Galileo's letter is a serious engagement of a problem raised in Augustine's De Genesi ad Litteram and ultimately a repudiation of some aspects of the work on which it claims to rest. What the Letter to the Grand Duchess Christina involves is the accom- modation of recent advances in astronomy, most notably the Copernican hypothesis as a whole, to those passages in Scripture in which the sun is mobile and the earth stable. The instance which Galileo examines, and the one which he would make emblematic of his entire argument, comes from the tenth chapter of the Book of Joshua; and it appears in every way consonant with a Ptolemaic scheme: On that day when the Lord delivered up the Amorites into the hands of Israel, Joshua spoke with the Lord, and in the presence of Israel said: Stand still, you sun, at Gibeon; you moon, at the vale of Ajalon. The sun stood still and the moon halted until the nation had taken vengeance on its enemies, as indeed is written in the Book of Jashar. The sun stayed in mid- heaven and made no haste to set for almost a whole day. Never before or since has there been such a day as that on which the Lord listened to the voice of a mortal. Surely the Lord fought for Israel!2 Galileo needed to demonstrate how this passage and others like it might be read as anything other than evidence of a mobile sun and fixed earth. His solution, a close and clever reading of the story of the Battle of Gibeon, is not offered until the last pages of the Letter, and it compares quite favorably to contemporaneous exegetical interpretations of Joshua X.3 Within the critical tradition, however, this aspect of the work has generally been neglected, and attention has been devoted to the long meditations on the relationship of science to theology4 with which the Letter is mainly concerned.5 The discussion of Joshua X has been consid- 2Joshua X: 12-14. 3 For a summary of alternative interpretations of the miracle of Joshua X, see Karl Friedrich Keil, Commentary on the Book of Joshua, tr. James Martin (Edinburgh, 1887), 257ff., who notes that many later seventeenth-century exegetes suggested that not the sun but rather an image of it caused by atmospheric refraction lit up the sky during the Battle of Gibeon. The refraction was sometimes connected with the hailstorm mentioned in Joshua X: 11, as if the ice in the sky, forming a lens, illuminated the battleground long after the sun had slipped below the horizon. 4 On the emergent autonomy of science, see B. C. Southgate, " 'Forgotten and Lost,': Some Reactions to Autonomous Science in the Seventeenth Century," JHI, 50 (1989), 249-68. 5 Two excellent discussions are those of Francois Russo, "Lettre a Christine de Lor- raine Grande-Duchesse de Toscane (1615)," Revue d'histoire des sciences, 17 (1964), 331-67, and Jean Dietz Moss, "Galileo's Letter to Christina: Some Rhetorical Considera-</page><page sequence="3">Augustine and Galileo 565 ered naive, facile, and unrelated to either the deliberations preceding it or to the kind of reading which Augustine had proposed.6 It is the contention of the present essay, however, that Galileo's resolution of the Biblical episode is closely connected to the Augustinian issues on which the Letter as a whole tends to focus. In his attempt to present Joshua X as a text whose literal meaning offered a scientifically coherent explanation of phenomena, Galileo relied upon analogous objectives in Augustine's work. In the De Genesi ad Litteram, Augustine had insisted upon the importance of the literal mean- ing of Scripture, and he had argued its preeminence largely at the expense of two other modes of interpretation.7 The first type involved allegorical readings; and though these were valid in that they usually told, in symbolic terms, the story of man's eventual salvation, Augustine believed that they might be proposed only when all efforts to establish a literal reading had been exhausted.

The former essay is also presented in more abstract fashion as "Galileo and the Theology of His Time," in Paul Poupard (ed.), Galileo Galilei: Towards a Resolution of 350 Years of Debate, tr. Ian Campbell (Pittsburgh, 1987), 103-24. While these studies offer valuable analyses of the place of the Letter within Galileo's entire career and of the relationship of his rhetoric to his scientific method, the marginal position which they assign to the discussion of Joshua X is obviously in some way opposed to the thrust of the present essay. 6 Russo's criticism is in fact limited to Galileo's solution of the Joshua episode: "Ainsi, bien na*ve nous apparailt l'explication apportee a la fin de la Lettre par Galilee du miracle de Josue, a la lumiere de la theorie de Copernic, declaree beaucoup plus adaptee a sa comprehension que le systeme astronomique traditionnel. Nous trouvons ici un con- cordisme dont, au nom meme de ses principes, Galilee aurait diu savoir se garder" ("Let- tre," 338, note 2). Moss is similarly unimpressed with the solution and its connection to the rest of the work. Neither Russo nor Moss discuss the first part of the Scriptural analysis-the focus of the present essay-where Galileo shows that the passage from Joshua serves to condemn, rather than confirm, the Ptolemaic system, and, incidentally, some Augustinian presuppositions. 7See, for example, near the end of the first book of the De Genesi ad Litteram, where Augustine elaborates several methodological principles. In section XVII, 34 he argues against reliance upon "prophetic allegories," noting that literal explanations, ones that do no violence to the historicity of the narrative, are to be preferred to aenigmatafuturarum. In the following section (XVII, 36) he discusses the manner in which God executes His plan-through eternal and unchanging principles, rather than through spiritual or corporeal actions unfolding in time-and warns against those interpretations which assign Him the physical attributes and temporal limitations appropriate to His creatures. The figurative readings which Augustine chooses to avoid presuppose some sort of hierarchy among readers: an elite, typically composed of prophets, for whom spiritual allegories are intended, and a designated subclass who would not believe at all, were it not for Scriptural accommodation. In the De Genesi ad Litteram, however, the emphasis on literal interpreta- tion means that this hierarchy of the devout is effectively disregarded and that what differences there are between various readers resolve themselves into questions of erudition, logic, and patience. Many of Augustine's discussions refer, for example, not to the allegori- cal tradition but to the opinions of those skilled in a secular discipline, or reasonable and persistent enough to follow his long and often complex analyses.</page><page sequence="4">566 Eileen Reeves did not preclude its literal value and had to conform to it. The other strategy of exegetes was a tendency to explain what appeared to be particu- larly naive or primitive Scriptural statements as a kind of accommodation, a form of divine condescension to the dim light of human intelligence. Because Augustine's contention was that the literal interpretation of Scrip- ture offered a statement whose meaning was not a crude approximation of sacred history but a rather exact version of it, he naturally regarded accommodation as another tactic to be used only as a last resort. The method practiced by Augustine in De Genesi ad Litteram did not invali- date the allegorical readings so frequent in his other works, and it did not deny that all of God's word necessarily involved some sort of accommoda- tion to mortal intelligence, but it affirmed that the parameters of man's future salvation and of his present ignorance should not preclude a literal interpretation of the words before him. Before devoting his attention to the specific problem presented by Joshua X, Galileo dutifully cited the exegetical principles outlined by Augustine. More crucial to the present analysis than his lengthy discussion of Scriptural interpretation, however, is the relationship between Galileo's solution of the Joshua episode and one of Augustine's references to astron- omy. This passage, like most of those cited in the course of the Letter,8 comes from the second book of De Genesi ad Litteram and involves the astronomical measure of time. While of modest scientific value, it is nonetheless the analogue of Galileo's explanation of what happened dur- ing the battle of Gibeon. What is yet more curious is that even as Galileo appears to have adopted the Augustinian perspective-one which insists upon the coherence and scientific accuracy of the literal meaning of Scrip- ture-he works to marginalize that very text and to substitute his own work instead. As the following analysis will show, Galileo's rather unor- thodox conclusions constitute a critical reading of premises established in Augustine's work. 8 Galileo's solution of the riddle of Joshua X appears to predate his reading of De Genesi ad Litteram: his letter of 21 December 1613 to Father Benedetto Castelli explains the passage in the fashion later adopted in the Letter to the Grand Duchess Christina, though he seems not to have yet read Augustine's work. That letter, however, is devoid of the stylistic characteristics on which my analysis of the Letter to the Grand Duchess Christina is based, and it appears that only in the latter work did the scientist make any particular connections between his solution and Augustinian premises. A letter written in January 1615 to Galileo by Benedetto Castelli alludes to a certain Barnabite preacher who was assembling various passages from the works of Saint Augustine and other religious thinkers that might buttress the arguments of the Letter. It is unclear whether Galileo ever received this compilation, or what form it had. The greatest part of the citations appearing in the Letter comes from a fairly narrow range of the De Genesi ad Litteram, from the end of the first book through the end of the second book of that work, the section concerned with astronomical matters.</page><page sequence="5">Augustine and Galileo 567 Augustine, an inveterate enemy of astrology,9 devoted particular en- ergy to his commentary on Genesis 1:14, in which the Creator said, "Let there be lights in the vault of the heavens to separate day from night, and let them serve as signs both for festivals and for seasons and years." What significance heavenly bodies had, Augustine affirmed, was limited to their ability to measure the passage of time: they neither affected nor portrayed human destiny. Though he would treat these "lights" as no more than a glorious form of clockwork, Augustine's analysis is remarkably inconclu- sive, as if not even days, months, and years could be clearly defined, and as if these "signs" were open to more than one kind of interpretation: Why are stars called "signs?" Let us then understand "festivals, days, and years" to be the divisions of time that we normally mark with hourglasses or by the movements that we see in the heavens, as when the sun rises up in the east and goes down in the west, after which the moon or some other star can be seen emerging in the east, climbing to the middle of the sky and thus marking the middle of the night, and then finally setting, so that with the returning sun the day might begin. A day, therefore, is the complete circuit of the sun from east to west. As regards years, they might be measured by those orbits made by the sun, not when it returns to the east, as it does each day, but when it returns to the same place among the [fixed] stars, which only happens once every 365 and one quarter days. This interval, repeated four times, requires us to add what the Romans call a "bissextile" day in order that the sun can complete its circuit. Alternatively, there are longer and more mysterious years, for some men say that the "greater years" are measured by the revolutions of the [wandering] stars. If it is thus that we understand "festivals, days, and years," then no one can doubt that they are measured by stars and other heavenly bodies.'0 What most interests Augustine, then, is the manner in which a day or year might be measured by these heavenly "signs," and he offers three possible definitions of these intervals. The details which he elides in his discussion are at least as interesting as the various precisions which he offers, for it is upon just such omissions that Galileo built the argument of the Letter to the Grand Duchess Christina. The equivocal fashion in which Augustine presents fundamental units of time recalls, moreover, a curious aspect of Joshua X, the focus of the Letter. In the story of the Battle of Gibeon, the whole point was the miraculously prolonged interval 9 For Augustine's classic criticism of astrology, see Confessions, VII, vi. 10 Augustine, De Genesi ad Litteram, II, xiv, 29. For an excellent French translation and accompanying notes, see the edition of P. Agaesse and A. Solignac, La Genese au sens litteral (Paris, 1972). The aporetic quality of Augustine's statement corresponds well to the kind of argument presented in the citations drawn from this section of the De Genesi ad Litteram, where Augustine suggests that the literal meaning of Scripture should be established with caution, lest it later prove to conflict with revelations offered by scientific progress. The specific import of the passage-the relationship of time to the movements of heavenly bodies-is moreover the enigma presented by the miracle at Gibeon.</page><page sequence="6">568 Eileen Reeves between two successive sunrises; and whatever the consequences of the fighting, it would seem that this period could no longer be called a "day." It is, however, as if the language of Scripture cannot keep apace of the wonders it portrays, for at the very moment in which the term "day" is put into question, it is used as if it provided some perfectly uniform and obvious measurement:" On that day when the Lord delivered up the Amorites into the hands of Israel, Joshua spoke with the Lord.... The sun stayed in mid-heaven and made no haste to set for almost a whole day. Never before or since has there seen such a day as that on which the Lord listened to the voice of a mortal. Similarly, the different notions which Augustine offers of a day and of a year, concepts which he recognizes as specific to one or another culture, fall nonetheless under the same name, as if they had been designated in such approximative fashion by the ambiguous "signs" of the heavens themselves. Within the framework of the Ptolemaic system, days and years might be defined in several fashions: every 23 hours and 56 minutes the starry sphere seemed to whirl completely around from east to west, while every 24 hours the sun, appearing to move in the same direction, made a similar circuit. Over the course of the year it was as if the sun moved backwards along the starry sphere, each day rising just a bit behind the constellations in whose vicinity it had traveled the day before. This annual path was called the ecliptic, and the broad band of constellations around it was known as the Zodiac. The sun, always to be found somewhere along the Zodiac, seemed to progress forever from west to east because of the relative tardiness of its daily revolutions in the other direction. When Augustine defined the day, he did so only in terms of solar revolutions, as if there were no variation between the movement of the sun and that of the stars behind it. When he described the year, however, he did not evoke a series of solar days; he wavered between the sidereal year, in which the sun would return to a certain Zodiacal constellation, and what he saw as the more obscure alternative of the "greater years." 12 The difference between these measurements, not an issue in the context of modern astronomy, now merits further discussion. In writing of years that were longer than the sidereal one, Augustine I I Within the Jewish commentary tradition there was great emphasis upon the ambigu- ous status and length of this miraculous "day." For a summary of reactions taken from Talmudic, Midrashic, and Rabbinic sources, see Rabbi Reuven Drucker (tr. and com.) The Book of Joshua (Brooklyn, 1982), 248-53. 12 Censorinus, a grammarian of the third century, gives the most complete description of the various "greater years" in his De die natali. The term "the greatest year of all" is, moreover, found in De die natali, where it is used to distinguish the longest cycle, now known simply as "the great year," from these shorter and now obscure intervals. See Guillaume Rocca-Serra (tr.), Lejour natal (Paris, 1980), 27-30.</page><page sequence="7">Augustine and Galileo 569 exercised caution and a certain ambiguity: it is only through comparison of related passages in his other works that we may establish the kind of intervals he imagined. The most elaborate analysis occurs in an early and unfinished commentary on Genesis;13 for there Augustine acknowledged that a year might be defined as the time it took one of the more remote "wandering stars," or planets such as Saturn or Jupiter, to complete a full revolution through the heavens. These "greater years," equal to thirty and twelve sidereal years respectively, interested him less than the possibility of what was called "the greatest year of all." At the end of that cycle, he wrote, all the planets would return to their original positions, the place where they had begun movement on the first morning of the first day of creation. In this unfinished commentary on Genesis Augustine described neither the length of this "greatest year of all," nor the consequences of a revolu- tion of such magnitude. These issues were debated throughout Antiquity, for estimates of the time it would take all planets to assume their original configuration ranged from 2,484 to 3,600,000 sidereal years. There was, moreover, no particular consensus about the significance of such a pattern. Some held that it signalled a certain recursivity, as if the repetition of a celestial arrangement ensured an analogous duplication of human affairs, and that any incident or series of incidents would necessarily recur at a distance of several millennia. Others believed that when the planets came together under the constellation where they had begun their various orbits, the earth would be consumed by fire or water; it was only after such catastrophes that history could resume its cycle. For a third group of thinkers, the "greatest year of all" bore no relation to the myth of eternal return; the argument, strictly astronomical, merely involved other cycles in which two or more planetary motions were co6rdinated.14 In neither of his commentaries on Genesis does Augustine reveal his 13 See Joseph Zycha (ed.), De Genesi ad Litteram imperfectus liber, Corpus Scriptorum Ecclesiasticorum Latinorum, XXVIII (1) (Prague, 1894), 487. P. Agaesse and A. Solignac (La Genese au sens litteral, 196-97) point out that Augustine's notion of the "greater years" and the "greatest year of all" derives from Cicero's De natura deorum II, xx, 51-52. 14 Censorinus mentions that Aristarchus believed the "greatest year of all" to be equal to 2,484 solar years, while Cassandros's estimate was 3,600,000 years. He notes, without commenting on the apparent paradox, that some men felt that the cycle was "infinitely long." The traditional figure is 36,000 years. Berosus and his followers were most interested in establishing a connection between the cycle and catastrophe; see Seneca, Quaestiones naturales III, 29, and J. Bidez, "Berose et la grande annee," Melanges Paul Fredericq (Brussels, 1904), 9-19. Pierre Duhem, Le Systeme du monde (Paris, 1914), II, 449-53, discusses the link between the cycle and determinacy. The "greatest year of all" later came to be associated with precession, a slow process involving the gradual displacement of the equinoxes through the Zodiac, and believed to have a cycle of 36,000 years. For a general discussion of astrological recursivity as understood by late Antique and Patristic writers, see G. W. Trompf, The Idea of Historical Recurrence in Western Thought (Berkeley, 1979), 200-212.</page><page sequence="8">570 Eileen Reeves opinion of the nature and consequences of "the greatest year of all." His more elaborate discussion of the hypothesis in the City of God'5 counters the deterministic aspects of the myth on doctrinal grounds, but the focus of the conjectures raised in this context of Scriptural exegesis is elsewhere. In these passages Augustine is concerned with presenting the various "greater years" as a kind of abstraction of the idea of a ''year," an interval too often associated with the sun's movement alone, and then with por- traying the "greatest year of all" as no more than an index of man's obscure and distant future. What is interesting about his three definitions of time the solar day, the sidereal and great years-is the way in which they resemble the methodological notions set forth in his discussion of exegetical practice. As the following analysis will demonstrate, the heavenly "signs" might be interpreted in three different fashions, depending upon whether the reader saw them as a form of accommodation, as a true measure of time, or as a mere pretext for the kind of abstraction occasioned by allegory. The first definition which Augustine proposes, that of the solar day, is flawed and of no use in defining the year; because it ignores the four- minute variation between the motion of the sun and that of the starry sphere, it is valid only from the perspective of the terrestrial observer. The reader who measures the day from sunrise to sunrise therefore offers an anthropomorphic explanation of time, as if the text's emphasis on the "signs" of the stars entailed a kind of accommodation to his geocentric assumptions. The alternative which Augustine seems to favor and the one about which he offers the most information, the sidereal year, is most like his description of a literal reading: the text says that the (fixed) stars mark time, and so they do, a year being the interval it takes the sun to return to the same point in a given Zodiacal constellation. The third definition, that involving those "other stars," the "greater years," and the "greatest year of all," is at some remove from the literal reading which Augustine preferred. While not in itself allegorical-Augustine is indeed referring to the real orbits of the other planets-this third interpretation mimics the structure of allegory. Just as an allegorical interpretation, taking as its point of departure a word with a literal referent, manages to "speak of something other" by offering an abstraction, so Augustine's final defini- tion of the "year" involving "other stars" diverges, without sacrificing coherence, from the literal meaning generally assigned to that interval, and envisages a remote future. The reference to the "greater years" is appealing in its mystery, but problematic in the way that eschatological allegories often are: at once correct and obscure, it is more an index of things to come the sacramentum futuri-than of the present narrative of mortal man. That Augustine intended to suggest a parallel between our ways of 15 City of God, XII, x-xiii.</page><page sequence="9">Augustine and Galileo 571 reading the "signs" in the firmament and those in Scripture is certain: the point had already been explicitly developed in the long meditation of the thirteenth book of the Confessions, in which the unfurled Scroll of the Heavens was compared to the parchment on which the word of God was inscribed. That discussion, however, was one which he was to later call "'allegorical," 16 and he is at pains in the De Genesi ad Litteram to establish a connection of somewhat greater complexity. To suggest, as the Church Father does, that the divine statement "Let the stars serve as signs both for the festivals and for seasons and years," might be read either as accommodation, as an eschatological allegory, or as a literal statement, depending upon whether one was measuring a solar day, or the "greatest year," or a sidereal one, is to preserve the link between Scripture and astronomical interpretation. It is this implicit association that remains the source of Galileo's argument. It was only through serious consideration of Augustine's concept of the virtual superposition of Scripture and the firmament that Galileo would be able to sever these alleged connections, and to offer a new way of reading the heavens. As I will demonstrate, he was able to do so by adopting Augustine's notion of the sidereal year- the interval it takes the sun to return to a given Zodiacal constellation- to solve the puzzle posed by Joshua X, proving that the details of the Scriptural passage precluded a Ptolemaic interpretation. It might at this point be argued that Galileo's conflict with Augustine was inevitable and that it is remarkable that the seventeenth-century Copernican astronomer could have benefited to the extent he did from the fifth-century Church Father, since the cosmologies which they favored differed in such fundamental fashion. Alternatively, it might be main- tained that Galileo's Letter to the Grand Duchess Christina is the logical extension and confirmation of a suggestion raised by Augustine in De Genesi ad Litteram, one in which the Church Father noted that those scientific hypotheses inferred from Scripture ought to be treated with caution rather than offered as articles of faith, lest advances in disciplines not related to theology later disprove earlier interpretations and imperil the sacred text as a whole. In the case of this latter argument, Galileo's reading of Joshua X as evidence for a Copernican system would be no more than the kind of updating which Augustine had anticipated in matters that fell outside of the doctrinal issues with which Scripture is primarily concerned. These two lines of reasoning imply, however, that the difference be- tween the views of Augustine and Galileo is most of all a function of history; and it is against such interpretations that I am arguing. Augustine superimposes the "signs" of the firmament on those of the sacred text because he believes the former somehow point to the latter and are the material manifestation of them. Galileo, working within the same tradi- 16 De Genesi ad Litteram, IX, 22.</page><page sequence="10">572 Eileen Reeves tion, effectively inverts the hierarchy invoked by the Church Father. It is not that the scientist simply turns away from the "signs" of the starry sphere and offers a different set of natural phenomena-the sun, a body whose markings he had lately deciphered-as the visible index of Scrip- ture, but rather that he reversed the order and, more crucially, the impor- tance of the celestial and sacred texts. The basis of such an argument, one that moves so decisively away from the ordering principle of the logos, was Galileo's insistence that names be accommodated to things, and not vice versa, a point which he had made earlier in his Letters on the Sun- spots. 17 Thus the "signs" of Scripture point beyond themselves to the sun; no longer the end of a long chain of references, they become a gloss to what Galileo saw as a more permanent text, the physical Book of the Heavens: Would the censorship of all science be anything other than the condemnation of those many passages of Scripture in which we are taught that the glory and grandeur of the Creator can be seen in all of His works, and divinely read in the open book of the Heavens? Nor should anyone believe that in reading the lofty notions inscribed in those pages that he will do no more than see the splendor of the sun and stars and their risings and settings, just because this is all the ignorant man perceives. There are such profound mysteries and sublime concepts that the observations, labors, and efforts of hundreds of the most brilliant minds have not yet entirely unveiled them, even after millennia of searching.18 While Augustine presented science and secular learning in general as a variable body of knowledge against which the vast and unchanging text of Scripture might be read, Galileo completely subordinated the Old and New Testament to the greater "Book of the Heavens." What was the primary text for the one thinker was, therefore, only one means of critical inquiry for the other. The collection of "signs" which astronomers had defined as the firmament was perhaps for Augustine no more than a kind of outdated cultural artifact, a group of lights by which some men in some 17 See in this connection Stillman Drake, "Galileo semantico," Intersezioni, 3 (1983), 45-55. 18 "II proibir tutta la scienza, che altro sarebbe che un reprovar cento luoghi delle Sacre Lettere, i quali ci insegnano come la gloria e la grandezza del sommo Iddio mirabilmente si scorge in tutte le sue fatture, e divinamente si legge nell'aperto libro del cielo? Ne sia chi creda che la lettura de gli altissimi concetti, che sono scritti in quelle carte, finisca nel solo veder lo splendor del Sole e delle stelle e '1 lor nascere ed ascondersi, che e il termine sin dove penetrano gli occhi dei bruti e del vulgo; ma vi son dentro misteri tanto profondi e concetti tanto sublimi, che le vigilie, le fatiche e gli studi di cento e cento acutissimi ingegni non gli hanno ancora interamente penetrati con l'investigazioni continuate per migliaia e migliaia d'anni." Galileo Galilei, Lettera a Madama Christina, in Opere di Galileo Galilei, ed. Ferdinando Flora (Milan, s.d.), 1026-27. It is worth noting that Galileo's reference to the few things that the "ignorant man" can see in the Book of the Heavens-"the splendor of the sun and the stars and their risings and settings"-echoes, in unflattering fashion, Augustine's analysis of the "signs" of Genesis I:14.</page><page sequence="11">Augustine and Galileo 573 periods-Romans, in this case-measured what they called a "year."19 His account implies, in other words, that while the "signs" were perma- nent, the way in which they would be resolved into legibility would vary from epoch to epoch, having none of the immutability of Scripture itself. The cleverness of Galileo's solution, on the other hand-the fact that he turned the Joshua episode into evidence of the Copernican system- suggests that he viewed Scripture as just one more index of the unchanging structure of the heavens,20 and not as the backdrop and logos of all phenomena. The elements that characterize the Letter to the Grand Duchess Chris- tina are not limited to its pious tone and rambling arguments: there are also certain stylistic tendencies that appear nowhere else in Galileo's major works. Whether these features can be said to disfigure the text is, of course, a matter of taste, but even the most indulgent reader will note that the language of the Letter to the Grand Duchess Christina lacks both the nuance and the variety of the other important texts of the astronomer. There is first of all an awkwardness born of an overlay in the metaphorical terms with which Galileo describes the wrong done him by his rivals, and the literal ones used to depict more technical issues, almost as if the author were intent upon creating puns to garnish an otherwise humorless work. When, for instance, he recounts his grievances against his enemies, he lapses into figures normally encountered in an astronomical context, but here merely applied to his poor relationship with certain clergymen: It happened that time has little by little revealed to everyone first the truths that I long ago pointed out, and then the differences between those men who simply could not accept my discoveries, and those less honest ones who mixed their skepticism with personal animosity. [This latter group, my enemies] is always 19 Though his work was unknown to Augustine, Geminos (fl. 1st century A.D.) in his Introduction to Astronomy showed that not all calendars marked years by the sun and days and months by the moon, and so these heavenly bodies would not necessarily serve as "signs" for festivals. The Greek astronomer argued that the Egyptian feast of Isis, traditionally and mistakenly associated with the winter solstice, actually retrograded one day every four years, so that after 1460 years it would have been celebrated on every day of the year. Geminos also suggested that the Egyptians, though well-versed in astronomy, did not link the civil calendar to the sun's movement because they wanted, for religious reasons, that their various festivals be observed throughout the year.

The Istoria intorno alle macchie solari (Letters on the Sunspots), published just two years before the Letter to the Grand Duchess Christina, was Galileo's second major work; and it chronicled the first of his openly acknowledged enmities, the polemic with the Jesuit Christoph Scheiner. It is noteworthy that nowhere else in his work does Galileo use the word macchie to indicate anything other than the spots which he had observed on the sun's and the moon's surfaces. Given that the term has for the author and his audience connotations that are strictly astronomical, it is curious and disconcerting to see its casual appearance in an other and largely unrelated context. As the multiplicity of such instances suggests, however, the flaw is an intentional one, for the inappropriateness of the term to its context acts as a means of calling into question Augustine's association of the "signs" of the firmament and those of a text. Whatever the macchie involve, then, in the way of insult, they also function as a corrective to the Augustinian model: while the stellar "signs" mentioned in De Genesi ad Litteram pointed beyond themselves to those more perma- nent ones of Scripture itself, these misplaced macchie offer at most a kind of opacity, a dead-end in the chain of interpretation. Galileo continues with another inelegant statement. When he notes that his adversaries persist "in their design of throwing me and all my projects to Earth by any means whatsoever"22 the metaphor is again close, but not sufficiently so, to a literal description of astronomical activity; and the serious tone of the Letter suddenly seems compromised by failed puns and obscure word-play. Two more examples of these stylistic tenden- cies should make clear, however, the reason for their repeated appearance in the Letter to the Grand Duchess Christina. Whenever Galileo mentions Scriptural interpretation, he invariably uses the same terms-consideriamo il luOgo23 ("let us consider the pas- 21 "E accaduto poi che il tempo e andato successivamente scoprendo a tutti le verita prima da me additate, e con la verita del fatto la diversita degli animi tra quelli che schiettamente e senz'altro livore non ammettevano per veri tali scoprimenti, e quegli che all'incredulita aggiugnevano qualche affetto alterato ...

Luogo, often used in conjunction with considerare, occurs 31 times in these same pages. One of the most interesting examples of this otherwise tiresome frequency is on page 1033, where Galileo mentions the Commentary of Diego da Zuiiiga on Job IX:6, "Qui commovet Terram de</page><page sequence="13">Augustine and Galileo 575 sage")-as if there were no other ways to designate the project at hand. While the sheer repetition becomes tedious, the wording itself is signifi- cant: considerare is derived from the Latin sidus, "star," and it means to watch something as attentively as one does the stars.24 Since the whole point of Galileo's considerazione del luogo is Joshua's consideration of the place of the sun in the heavens, it is as if the two activities, that of the critic and that of the main protagonist of the Battle of Gibeon, have been collapsed into one under the force of language. Galileo's use of astronomical terminology to denote the exegete's undertaking reinforces, in other words, Augustine's implied connection between the starry sphere and Scripture itself, though it is precisely this association which his solu- tion will eventually call into question. Finally, the same kind of astronomical connotations typifies Galileo's repeated wish to accomodare the literal meaning of Scripture to human understanding.25 The term was used by Suetonius, among others, to de- scribe just the kind of time-reckoning on which Augustine's example of a literal reading was based, that of the sidereal year. In his Life of Julius Caesar the Latin historian had written, "He adjusted the year to the path of the sun, and so that it might be 365 days long he abolished the interca- lary month in order that one more day might be added every four years."26 The task which Julius Caesar had performed in his calendar reform and the one to which Augustine referred in his unusually technical description involved a way of measuring time according to the sun's place in the stellar sphere, rather than according to a precise number of risings and settings. Galileo's repeated use of the word accommodare as a means of designating Biblical exegesis recalls Augustine's argument and its Julian precedent of regarding the stars of the firmament as the fixed set of "signs" by which all other phenomena might be interpreted. In the present context the term suggests, moreover, the superposition of the "signs" of the heav- ens on those of Scripture. Yet the fact that Galileo adopts Augustine's analogy does not ultimately guarantee that he finds it valid; he uses it, indeed, to disprove this very connection. loco suo," for this citation involves the use of the term locus in a literal rather than abstract fashion. It is worth noting that Galileo's constant use of the word errare, meaning both "to err" and "to wander," probably figures in this semantic network, since the planets were known as the "wandering stars." Because Galileo is interested in establishing the error of those who did not recognize that the earth itself was a "wandering star," the term has a double referent, as I will argue for both considerare and luogo. 24 See s.v. sidus, A. Ernout, and A.

The argu- ment of those opposed to Copernicanism seemed logical and irrefutable: why would Joshua command the sun to stand still if it were not mobile? Galileo relied, however, on Augustine's second measure of time, that of the annual retrograde motion of the sun relative to the starry background, to prove that a Ptolemaic reading of the passage made no sense. His solution is stunning in its simplicity. If in an earth-centered system the sun stood still in the sky, he asserted, the day would be shorter, not longer. The fateful victory of the Israelites over the Amorites would not have taken place, because if the sun ceased its west to east movement against the whirling of the firmament-if it offered no resistance to the diurnal motion of the starry sphere-it would have set more quickly than ever, making the day not longer but some four minutes shorter. In adopting this line of argument, Galileo avoided the usual earth- centered notion of the sun as a body that moves from east to west each day: rather than relying on accommodation, he exploited the somewhat less obvious representation of the sun's annual retrograde progression among the stars. This characterization, corresponding to Augustine's idea of the literal level on which Scripture should be read, is not entirely accurate; for Galileo presents the sun as if its eastward movement were not relative but absolute and as if it were actively proceeding from west to east rather than passively falling behind the east to west motion of the stars. What is most pertinent to the present discussion, however, is the fact that Galileo effectively shows that consideration of the passage from Joshua X serves not to confirm but to condemn the earth-centered scheme. One who examines the text as attentively as he does the starry sphere sees that the significance which Augustine assigned to the stars does not illuminate but rather conflicts with the literal meaning of Scripture. Galileo then demonstrates the way in which the same Biblical verses sustain the Copernican system. Drawing on Neoplatonic imagery,27 he describes the sun as the hub of the great wheel of the cosmos, and he reminds his audience that the motion of the solar body is limited to the monthly axial rotation recently established in his study on the sunspots, the Istoria intorno alle macchie solari. Were this movement to come to a halt, he reasoned, each planet of the entire cosmos would suspend its rotations and revolutions. As regards the outcome of the Battle of Gibeon, the earth's spinning would cease instantly, and the day would draw to a close only when the sun and then the earth began rotating again. The sun's axial motion, in appearance so remote from the whirling planets that surround it, thus becomes literally and figuratively the central feature of Galileo's depiction of the heavens. It is no longer the starry sphere that 27 For a thorough discussion of this aspect of the Letter to the Grand Duchess Christina and of a related letter which Galileo wrote to Piero Dini in March 1615, see Paolo Rossi, "Galileo Galilei e il libro dei Salmi," Rivista di Filosofia, 69 (1978), 45-71.</page><page sequence="15">Augustine and Galileo 577 moves the whole world, but rather the sun itself, almost as if the Ptolemaic system had been turned inside out.28 This radical and even violent reconstruction of the universe is of course prefigured throughout the Letter. If the emblem of the Ptolemaic system is the whirling backdrop of the starry sphere, that of the Copernican world picture is the sun, as the following metaphor will suggest. When Galileo describes the imminent condemnation of Copernicanism, he calls it "a movement against the grain of truth, and an attempt to hide it most and finally to suppress it, just when it appears the most evident and clear."29 The association of the sun and truth is obviously an entirely traditional one, but Galileo's more elaborate figure adds an important dimension to the argument. Occultare, for instance, was regularly used in Antiquity to designate a solar eclipse-occultatio solis-and like the outdated terms considerare and accommodare, this expression adds an archaic note to what is meant to be a discussion of modern cosmology. The perspective suggested by this image (and indeed by the tone of the entire letter) is that of an earthly observer imprisoned within a Ptolemaic system, the only index of the actual structure of the universe being the brilliant sun. From the viewpoint which Galileo pretends to have adopted, the elements that seem to oppose-that is, contravvenire-the solar body and the true pat- tern which it represents, are of course the stars against which it merely appears to move, the emblems of Augustine's notion of a literal reading of Scripture. The passage from Joshua X which Galileo takes as his starting point enjoys a loose correspondence with Augustine's notion of the firmament; for both involve a set of signs, which whether or not they are read, point beyond themselves. Galileo's progression from the "signs" of Joshua X to the macchie with which the sun was inscribed is, moreover, hardly less arbitrary than Augustine's movement from the "signs" of the firmament to those more important ones of Scripture. The macchie, indeed, are the only index of solar rotation, and in reading "the sun stood still," Galileo could not fail to see an allusion, however oblique it might appear to other readers, to the sunspots on which he had lately written. It is, in other words, as if his interpretation of the passage "the sun stood still," obliged 28 Throughout his Letter Galileo opposes his contortion of the universe to some of those interpretations that distort the Scriptural text. See, for instance, the conflation of terms in his comments on readings that deform or twist various luoghi of the Bible: "[il decreto de' Concilii] non veggo che in questo proposito proibisca altro se non lo stravolger in sensi contrarii a quel di Santa Chiesa o del comun consenso de' Padri quei luoghi solamente che sono de Fide, o attenenti a i costumi.... Ma la mobilita o stabilita della Terra o del Sole non sono de Fide ne contro a i costumi, ne vi e chi voglia scontorcere luoghi della Scrittura per contrariare a Santa Chiesa o a i Padri" (Lettera, 1033). In matters that involve neither faith nor mores-in this case astronomical issues-the apparent distortion of Biblical passages would be complemented by an analogous reconstruction of the ostensible pattern of the cosmos. 29 "un contravvenire alla verita, e cercare tanto pitu di occultarla e supprimerla, quanto piiu ella si dimostra palese e chiara," Galileo, Lettera, 1026.</page><page sequence="16">578 Eileen Reeves him to make a curious but no doubt gratifying emendation, "the sunspots stood still." These phenomena, moreover, unlike the stars to which Au- gustine referred, would have seemed incontrovertible evidence of a certain celestial structure, a surer "sign" than the ambiguous lights of the fir- mament. Galileo's clever solution to the problem of Joshua X provides a vivid end to the long and discursive questions with which the Letter opens. The brash nature of his closing arguments-the fact that he offers his Istoria intorno alle macchie solari as the light by which the obscurities of Scripture might best be revealed-is a pleasing antidote to the pious tone of the beginning of the work. What is most interesting about this audacious conjecture, however, is the way it ultimately refutes the Augustinian claims on which the Letter appears to be based, and displaces the stellar background against which the divine word was to be read. Galileo's explanation of Joshua X makes it clear that the starry sphere, the figure of Augustine's literal interpretation of Genesis, is supremely irrelevant to our understanding of the sun's movement. The constant exhortations to considerare il luogo serve therefore only to prove that the suggestive overlay of the firmament and Scripture is false. When in fact Galileo announces his solution of the problem posed by Joshua X, he uses these same terms in repetitive fashion, as if to emphasize their insignificance in the earlier context of exegesis: "I now consider, in the second place, how the solar body, while fixed in the same place, rotates on its own axis."30 What one sees, therefore, at the heart of the Joshua story are not the "signs" of the stars, but rather those on the face of the sun, the obscure new indices of how the heavens were structured. The conclusion of the Letter to the Grand Duchess Christina involves one last reference to the crucial issue of the starry firmament. In a final effort to render his interpretation more orthodox, Galileo offers a hymn attributed to Saint Ambrose, Caeli Deus sanctissime, in which the sun is described as a fiery wheel, flammea solis rota.31 Galileo's entirely predict- able attempt to read the verse as if it were a reference to the sun's hub-like axial rotation rather than to its revolution through space, is perhaps not as convincing as his solution of Joshua X; but his citation of the late Latin poem has nonetheless a certain strategic value. It recalls, in the first place, the earlier and celebrated citation of another hymn by Ambrose, the Deus creator omnium at the end of Book IX of the Confessions, and so adds, in overall fashion, to the Augustinian stamp of the Letter. This hymn, how- 30 "vengo nel secondo luogo a considerare come il corpo solare, ben che stabile nell'ist- esso luogo, si rivolge pero in se stesso," Galileo, Lettera, 1042. 31 "Caeli Deus sanctissime, / qui lucidum centrum poli / candore pingis igneo, / augens decoro lumine; / quarto die qui flammeam / solis rotam constituens, / lunae ministras ordinem, / vagosque cursus siderum."</page><page sequence="17">Augustine and Galileo 579 ever, refers to the vagi cursus siderum, the winding paths of what must be the wandering stars, or planets, and thus completely ignores the "signs" to which Augustine referred, the stable configurations of the fixed stars. The detail which the poem omits, however, is the one on which Galileo chooses to focus his final paragraph: "Theologians might argue that the name 'firmament' is an appropriate and literal description of the starry sphere and of all that lies above the whirling of the planets, for in this scheme the firmament is absolutely firm and immobile."32 Here the astron- omer corrects what had been a somewhat contrived (and perhaps not strictly literal) argument in the De Genesi ad Litteram. In his explanation of the term "firmament"-the basis of the implied analogy between the starry sphere and Scripture itself-Augustine had offered two hypothe- ses.33 His first conjecture was that the starry sphere was called "firm" not because it was motionless but because it was composed of a hard and solid substance. This explanation, which allowed him to justify the presence of supracelestial waters of Genesis 1:6, was current among astronomers through the late Renaissance, when the crystalline orbs were finally dis- carded.34 Augustine's second argument, a possible outgrowth of theories entertained in the Almagest,3s acknowledges that the sphere itself could stand "firm" or motionless while the stars revolved, each one being en- dowed with its own principle of ceaseless and regular movement. Whatever the merit of these two hypotheses, Augustine's interpreta- tion of the word "firmament" is characterized by impatience and a certain disdain for "those extremely curious and leisurely individuals who have been able to devote themselves to the research of such questions."36 Au- gustine makes it clear that he himself has no time for or particular interest in the issue, being rather more concerned with the instruction of the faithful for whom the De Genesi ad Litteram is written. Galileo's means of explaining the firmament-a celestial region that stands firm-is, as he notes, a literal one, and is thus a means of outdoing the exegete at his own game. It minimizes the importance of the starry sphere in which Augustine read a thousand bright "signs," and it affirms that what the Church Father saw as the material index of Scripture is animated solely by the whirling of our planet far below.
