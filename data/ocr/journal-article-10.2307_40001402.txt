<plain_text><page sequence="1">TENNYSON'S SORROW AND HER LYING LIP Lionel Adey Brief Articles and Notes Ever since first reading In Memoriam, I have found these lines in Section III strangely puzzling: O Sorrow, cruel fellowship, O Priestess in the vaults of Death, O sweet and bitter in a breath, What whispers from thy lying lip? The paradox of "cruel fellowship," put abruptly at first, then more gently in the third line, has its own interest- the ever-present grief, to which the poet clung even while hating it- but the real puzzle, to me, is the "lying lip." The mood personified as "Priestess" gives forth "lying" whispers. Presumably the image is of prayers to Death being said in a hushed voice; this is vague though in an aural sense under- standable, but why "lying"? To lie is not to be mistaken or deceived, but to be oneself the deceiver, purposely to speak untruth. Sorrow may mislead us by causing us to take a warped view of life, but "lying" has an emotional intensity beyond what the context demands. Tenny- son's violent reaction against the ideas presented to his mind by grief needs explanation. The ideas themselves are neither wholly absurd nor wholly ra- tional. Doubtless they arise from the contemplation of the Yew Tree in Section II, for "Thy fibres net the dreamless head" seems imagina- tively linked with "A web is wov'n across the sky" though the prose sense is very different. We are told that the stars "blindly" run their courses, that the sun is "dying" and that either the stars or the inter- stellar spaces are "waste." This is simply what many sane and truthful people not suffering from emotional shock have believed before Tenny- son's time and since. Yet this clear if somber view becomes less clear on consideration of the word "blindly." The use of the word in this way implies that the stars ought to feel. The blindness in this case is of the impersonal causative process impelling the stars. The em- phasis results from the tension induced by the implied antithesis between a Christian view of this causation as ultimately spiritual, and an atheistic view of it as impersonal necessity, rather than simply between a pre-Newtonian and a post-Newtonian model of the uni- verse. 261</page><page sequence="2">262 / VICTORIAN POETRY Now the "dying" sun must be understood not as a play upon the different senses of the word, in the manner of Donne, but as a fore- shortening of the process of Time. Contemporary physics and geology had revealed a universal flux of which the sun was part, and Tenny- son's imagination, intensified by grief, would foreshorten the whole process so that the sun was imagined as dying now rather than count- less ages hence. Though scientifically correct in so far as an entity which gives off irreplaceable energy is dying, the use of the term in a non-scientific context gives the impression of hysterical exaggeration. So also does the term "waste places" for a locality never thought of as capable of supporting life, and therefore neutral. The word "waste," meaning "desert," "barren," is, I submit, a projection of Tennyson's inner feeling of sterility or emptiness, itself a familiar manifestation of a reactive depression.1 If sorrow, like joy, is projected by a man on to a blank universe, can it therefore be said to "lie"? We do not lie when singing "Hail, smiling morn"; we merely make a comment upon our feelings, and one that it would be absurd to think of as either literal truth or deliber- ate deception. However, what sorrow told Tennyson could be thought of as a lie if truth were thought of as "that-which-makes-for-life."2 In other words, the emotional energy of the word "lying" is that of the poet's will-to-live, reacting against the torpor, or perhaps even the suicidal urge, induced by grief. The distorted image in the third stanza reveals this backlash of the healthy ego: And all the phantom, Nature, stands- With all the music in her tone, A hollow echo of my own,- A hollow form with empty hands. In the third line the poet acknowledges that he is projecting his grief upon the world. The total concept is virtually insane, for such expres- sions as "phantom," "hollow echo," "hollow form" and "empty hands" convey the absurd idea that the world is a ghostly image of sorrow, and that sorrow alone has substantial being. The lip that says this xCf. Robert Frost, "Desert Places," of which several lines recall the Tennyson lyric, notably Frost's concluding stanza: They cannot scare me with their empty spaces Between stars- on stars where no human race is. I have it in me so much nearer home To scare myself with my own desert places. 2Cf .

The delusion may well arise from the sense of isolation experienced by all who are pathologically depressed. Any obsession parts us from the external world, which is not possessed by it; it also absorbs the energy by means of which we perceive that world. The emotional intensity of "lying" is redoubled in the final stanza, in which the will-to-live asserts itself fiercely: And shall I take a thing so blind, Embrace her as my natural good; Or crush her, like a vice of blood, Upon trie threshold of the mind? This time the blindness is not that of the stars but that of the devour- ing obsession described in the previous stanza. The final lines are, I believe, both more rational and more honest than a superficial reading would suggest. What is to be crushed is the obsessive grief which makes the poet hear lamentations from a dying sun and from waste places in the heavens, which annihilates for him the earth and all therein. Tennyson is asserting not an anthropomorphic conception of the universe, in the teeth of the evidence, but simply the moral will to recover sanity and joy in life.3 8My reading of Tennyson's attitude in this lyric does not preclude a judgment that In Memoriam elsewhere may contain instances of escapism, even intellectual dishonesty.</page></plain_text>
