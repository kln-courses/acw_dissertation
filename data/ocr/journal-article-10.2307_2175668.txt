Berlin, Verlag von Wilhelm Herz, I 892. -pp. xvi, 444. In a work from the pen of Professor Paulsen we naturally look for the same qualities as those which characterized his former pro- ductions: speculative insight, breadth of knowledge, and a remark- able faculty of clear statement and apt illustration. All this the reader will find in this Introduction to Piilosoy5/hy, as well as a moral enthusiasm which cannot but command his respect, whatever view he may take of the conclusions reached by the author. And if he believes that the great problem of philosophy at the present day is the reconciliation of science, philosophy, and religion, he will here find a man of like mind with himself, from whom he cannot fail to receive stimulation and help. For the author sees that no theory of the world can be satisfactory which does not enable us to reduce all the various phases of reality to unity; and hence he refuses to admit that we must abandon speculation and limit ourselves to the " culti- vation of our gardens." Each of the sciences deals with some aspect of reality, and the true meaning of this aspect will yield itself up only to one who contemplates it as a phase of the whole. In the prosecution of his task the author is led to consider (i) the nature of Reality, and its ultimate form, and (2) the relation of Knowledge to Reality, and the origin of Knowledge; and he prepares the way for his own theory by a careful criticism of the main doctrines which he is unable to accept. These criticisms seem to me the most valu- able part of the book; but of course those who can be satisfied with the "idealistic monism" which he espouses will find the other part not less satisfactory. The author shows in a very clear and convincing way the unten- ability of Materialism as an ultimate view of the real. The aim of the materialist is to show that psychical events do not differ in their nature from physical events. The inadequacy of this view is at once apparent when we distinguish the two very different formulae by which the reduction of mind to matter is supposed to be established. 207</page><page sequence="2">208 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. II. If it is said that, objectively considered, psychical events are brain- movements, the simple answer is, that a thought which is a physical movement is as great an absurdity as a piece of iron which is made of wood. Thought is not motion, but thought. The only plausible way of reducing psychical to physical events is to say that the former are the efect of the latter. On this view we must suppose that a brain-movement is transformed into a sensation of definite quality and intensity which is its equivalent. Now, sensation is not motion, and hence we must suppose that, as energy is known only through its expression in motion, a certain quantity of energy has been destroyed. We are therefore shut up to the alternative of denying the principle of the conservation of energy, or abandoning the sup- posed causal relation of psychical and physical events. In point of fact, even materialists like Biichner virtually adopt the latter view when they say that " thought and extension are two aspects of the same being." Now, this doctrine of the parallelism of psychical and physical events, to be a satisfactory explanation of reality, must be extended to every form of being. Hence, in the first place, the Cartesian idea of automatism must include, not only plants and animals, but also man. But, in the second place, we must equally extend the psychical principle to all things, to plants and minerals as well as to animals and man. It is true that we have no direct knowledge of the inner life of any being but ourselves. Psychical phenomena are given to us only at one point, in self-consciousness, whereas all other beings are presented to us only on their physical side, as moving bodies. But just as we infer the inner life of human beings from the physical movements which is their outer expres- sion, so we are entitled to reason to the inner life of even inorganic things in the same way. Thus we get rid of the difficulty which besets the materialistic view of the causal relation of inner and outer events. The causal relation obtains only between physical events, or between psychical events, never between physical and psychical. If we follow the chain of movements from the vibration of a bell to the final movement in the brain we find that there is between them a causal relation; but the sensation of sound is-not the effect of these external movements, but of the psychical events which correspond to them point for point. Our author, in short, is an uncompromising advocate of the 'mind-stuff' theory, which he regards as established by the impossibility of drawing any hard and fast line between the various orders of existence, by the identity of the elementary con- stituents of inorganic and organic bodies, by the impossibility of</page><page sequence="3">No. 20] REVIEWS OF BOOKS. 209 otherwise explaining the fact of life, and by the view to which a true theory of knowledge inevitably leads, that all forms of external reality are but the phenomenal presentation of reality in our sensibility. Now, as all forms of being agree in the possession of an inner psychical life, we must ask what is the essential nature of this life. Obviously it cannot consist in self-consciousness, or even in con- sciousness; for, not to speak of inorganic things, the plant or the lowest forms of animal give no evidence of intelligence. The point of identity must be found, as Schopenhauer says, in will, which appears first as a blind force or impulse, then as the direction to particular ends, and finally as self-conscious effort penetrated and directed by intelligence. Thus will is at once the beginning and the end of psychical life: it is the one constant factor, present alike in the lowest and the highest form of being. All things, then, have an inner life or soul. But what is soul? Certainly not a mysterious ' entity' or ' substance,' such as is maintained by the spiritualistic dogmatists. The term ' soul' is simply a name for the fact that for each being the various psychical events which constitute its inner life form a unity. Hence there is no meaning in saying that the soul is localized in a particular part of the body. Ideas are no more in the brain than they are in the stomach or in the moon. But psychical events no-doubt accompany and correspond to corporeal events. This correspondence is thor- ough-going. The physical equivalent of the soul-life is the totality of physiological processes. For us, no doubt, our inner life appears as a thin chain of ideas, but to an intelligence which could contem- plate the whole of our physical and psychical life, our soul-life would seem to consist of an infinitely complex unity of contemporaneous events, partly above and partly below the threshold of consciousness. So far we have been dealing with the problem of Ontology, and now we must turn to the problem of Cosmology. Granting that every form of reality has an inner as well as an outer side, the question arises, whether all reality forms a single whole, or is. merely an aggregate of independent parts. If we take the former view, we must adopt some form of teleology. Our author shows in a very conclusive way the inadequacy of the old conception of design, as held by Anthropomorphic Theism. The truth is, that since the pro- mulgation of the Darwinian theory of development, that conception has become incredible. Does it follow that all teleology is excluded? That it does not follow may be seen, if we consider (i) that the very "struggle for existence" implies the will or effort to maintain the</page><page sequence="4">2IO THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. II. life of the individual and the species, and (2) that even apart from natural selection there is in all living beings a tendency to greater perfection of being, a tendency which by inheritance would in course of time lead to the variation of species. In man this tendency, which in lower beings is blind and instinctive, assumes the form of conscious striving after pre-determined ends. The rival theory of Atomism is an untenable hypothesis. Material atoms are pure abstractions. If an atom is extended, it must be divisible; if it is a system of forces it cannot be an atom, because force necessarily implies something upon which it acts. Thus each change in nature presupposes changes in nature as a whole. The same thing holds in regard to the changes of the inner life. But while this is true, it is not the less true that all psychical events imply the operation of will; in other words, the ordered succession of events is here purposive. And this holds good, not merely of all organic beings, but even of inorganic things, though of course only of those beings in their inner life. From these considerations the conclusion irresistibly follows, that all forms of reality are but phases of a single Reality or Will; in other words, that the totality of psychical events are but the modes in which the one Unity unfolds its essential content with absolute spontaneity. Is this Idealistic Pantheism inconsistent with the religious con- sciousness? If that consciousness consists in the feeling of rever- ence, based upon the perception of our finitude, and of faith in infinite goodness, it is a doctrine which is in perfect harmony with religion. It may be objected that, in denying the personality of God, Pantheism cuts at the root of all religion. To this objection the answer is, that while the inner nature of the All-one is no doubt different in kind from ours, yet God must be conceived rather as beyond than below personality. We may therefore speak of the holiness, wisdom, goodness, and blessedness of God, if only we re- member that these predicates are but symbols of a nature which transcends our power of conception. Thus an Idealistic Pantheism at once affirms the immanence and the transcendence of God: He is manifested in the world, and yet He is not identical with it. After thus showing the relation of his doctrine to science and religion, the author gives an interesting sketch of the historical evolution of the idea of God, and a short discussion of the re- lations of faith and knowledge. This brings him to the second great division of his subject: the relation of knowledge to reality, and the origin of knowledge. That we have a real knowledge of</page><page sequence="5">No. 2.] REVIE WS OF BOOKS. 2II our own inner life is manifest, if, discarding the untenable hypothesis of a mysterious 'substance,' we regard the soul as simply the unity which is presupposed in all our inner experiences. Feelings, desires, ideas, thoughts are as they appear. No doubt we have empirically a limited knowledge of self, but this does not show that there is any noumenal self different in kind from the self that we know. Nor is it any real objection to urge that we can only know ourselves under the subjective form of time; for, though to an absolute intelligence our inner life would not appear as in time, its content would be the same. Now, this knowledge of self is the key to the knowledge of the not-self. I know the real as it is in itself, in so far as it is of the same nature as myself. The world, it is true, exists for us only in and through our own ideas; but this does not prevent us from having an assured belief in a reality independent of those ideas. The Not-I is revealed to us in the experience which we make as willing beings, whose efforts are checked by an external limit. The further development of the opposition of I and Not-I arises from (i) the distinction of one's own body from other bodies, (2) the distinction between possible and actual perceptions. To attempt anything like an adequate criticism of a book so com- prehensive in its character, is obviously impossible here, and I shall only indicate the lines upon which such a criticism might proceed. (i) The whole method seems to me false. It is the method of seek- ing for unity by the elimination of differences, instead of seeking for it by the inclusion of differences in a higher unity. Thus, in his theory of reality, the author seeks to show that all forms of existence have an inner life, by eliminating the self-consciousness which is characteristic of man, the sensibility which is characteristic of ani- mals, and the growth which is characteristic of plants, and then affirming that all things are in their essence identical. But surely, if it is a valid answer to the materialist to say that "thought is thought, and not motion," it is equally valid to say that self-con- sciousness is self-consciousness, sensation is sensation, and growth is growth. (2) The same false method is employed in the reduction of the psychical life to what is called 'will.' It is mere confusion to call by the same name blind and unconscious effort and self- conscious effort. Were it not for this confusion, it would be manifest that there is no more reason for calling will primary than for calling intelligence primary; the fact being that there is in the lowest form of being merely the potentiality of both and the actuality of neither. (3) It is but another instance of the same perverse method, when all</page><page sequence="6">2I2 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. II. forms of being are regarded merely as modes of a single Reality. It is quite true that man has no existence out of relation to the whole, but his relation to the whole does not annihilate his free activity, but implies it. He cannot be conscious of his own nature apart from his consciousness of the whole, but neither can he be conscious of the whole apart from his consciousness of himself. (4) The ultimate Unity to which all existence is reduced is admittedly "without content" for us. This abstraction of I-know-not-what may as well be called Devil as God. If we know nothing of it, how do we know that its true nature is manifested in what seems to us the end of ex- istence ? To speak of personality, thought, will, as "symbols " of the unknowable nature of this " X-to-the-nth-power " is mere assump- tion; for a symbol which for us is symbolical of nothing, may be symbolical of anything. With the author's desire to affirm at once the immanence and the transcendence of God I thoroughly sympathize, but I am certain that the solution is not to be found in a dead and meaningless abstraction.
