<plain_text><page sequence="1">Disease, Life, and Man?Selected Es says by Rudolf Virchow, translated by Lelland J. Rathee; 273 pages; $5.00; Stanford University Press, 1958. The reading of this volume of Vir ehow's contributions to science and philosophy is profoundly stimulating to the thoughtful scholar and physician. His discussions of natural phenomena, and of the normal and abnormal cell, found in all living matter, demand concentrated thought and attention, but how rewarding. To understand and appreciate these essays one should keep in* mind the character and background of the great figure, Virchow. He began his scientific contributions at the age of 26, after having studied, among others, with the famous teacher, Johannes M?ller. He continued with unimpaired and matur ing mentality until his death at the age of 81. He was not only the acknowledged leader in pathology, but he was an eminent anthropologist, an archeolo gist, a sanitarian, a linguist and author ity in cuneiform, a statesman, having served in the German Reichstag for 13 years, where he, as a liberal, was more than once an opponent of Bismarck, a</page><page sequence="2">philosopher, an editor and founder of the famous Virchow's Archiv, which he served actively until his death in 1902. In his entire career he insisted upon detailed study and objective examina tion of facts, and was constantly op posed to hypotheses based upon flimsy evidence, and to drawing conclusions from unproved facts. This is apparent in his discussion of the subjects of the nine essays in this volume. His knowl edge of the field of literature is shown in his references to the publications of the scientists and philosophers having to do with the subjects of his essays. Virchow's greatest contribution to pathology and the understanding of disease processes was his publication, in 1858, of his famous Cellularpathologie. This laid to rest, once and for all, the ancient humoral doctrine, as well as the other systems of medicine that had had their day in the preceding century. He summarized his cellular theory as follows: All cells arise from parent cells. All pathological lesions are de generations, transformations or repro ductions of normal structures, made up always of cells. Diseases are the result of active or passive disturbances of living cells. A short chapter, "On Man," ana lyzes man's relation to his environment and his changing from the feeling of unity into self-awareness of the dualism between I and not-I. In this essay he discusses anthropomorphism and the difference between religious anthropo morphism and humanism. He says humanism is neither atheistic nor pantheistic. It knows only one formula for everything lying beyond the bounds of knowledge?"I do not know." In the essay, "On the Mechanistic Interpretation of Life," he insists upon the difference between the mechanistic interpretation of life and materialism. The former is not at all the latter. Materialism, he says, goes beyond experience. It applies the narrow stand ard of its knowledge to every phenome non, and forms itself into a system. This he deprecates because it draws conclusions from unproved facts. As to the Author, or First Cause, his 262A comment is, that whoever raises a question as to the Author of the plan must also, at the same time, attempt to seek out the Author of matter. In such a case we no longer work with a question of natural science, which attempts only to understand processes in the given world and possesses no means to make the earliest origin of that world an object of investigation. It is no longer a question of science that is involved, for no one knows anything of that which was before all existing things. Here is the boundary of the transcend ent. Whoever passes over it finds himself outside of the realm of scientific debate. Let him go to the secret chambers of his conscience for guidance. Natural science has no power over what is beyond the phenomenal world. It knows nothing of the origin of the world. In his essay, published in 1898, entitled "Recent Progress in Science and Its Influence on Medicine and Surgery," Virchow is still so concerned with the influence of cellular pathology on medicine that he devotes a great part of his discussion to that phase of the subject. One is disappointed that he does not mention the influence of Roentgen's discovery of the X Ray, although, to be sure, at that time, the X Ray as a diagnostic tool was in its infancy. Had Virchow lived to see the discoveries of this last half century it would be interesting to read his com ments. Virchow's eminence as a scientist and pathologist overshadows his other re markable attainments. Less understood and appreciated was his experience as a statesman, and his belief in the role of the scientist and physician in shaping the laws of the state and their bearing on the welfare of its citizens. His ex perience in the Reichstag, and his con tributions to sanitation and public health measures, had convinced him that the physiologist and the prac titioner should take part in the shaping of the social structure, and be elder statesmen in that field. His compelling influence in furthering scientific med icine, ironically enough, turned the attention of the newer generation of scientific practitioners away from en</page><page sequence="3">gaging m the political activities of their countries, a tendency that has continued to the present time. The introduction to the volume by the translator, Lelland J. Rather, M.D., is most interesting in his analysis of the contributions and methods of the Englishman Harvey, the Frenchman Bernard and the German Virchow. Dr. Rather deserves great credit for renewing the interest of scientists and physicians in these great essays of Virchow. The Stanford University Press has presented a most attractive volume in format and typography. Both author and publisher have done exceedingly well.?Allen 0. Whipple</page></plain_text>
