<plain_text><page sequence="1">London, Waddington Gallery &amp; Knoedler Gallery Anthony Caro Earlier this year, Anthony Caro exhibited a group of small bronzes and drawings at Acquavella in New York; these were mod- elled and drawn directly from the figure - the first time Caro had worked in this way since his student days. Caro's London dealers, John Kasmin and Leslie Wadding- ton, declined to show such conventionally figurative pieces here. But Kasmin has re- cently exhibited a group of Variations on an Indian theme, delicately patinated bronze sculptures, consisting of intimately model- led forms displayed in complex, constructed 'frames'. These were explicitly, if loosely, based upon an eleventh-century B.C. Chandella period carving of flying female warriors. Waddington exhibited a group of rather more familiar 'Table Pieces', and three large constructed works, in rusted and varnished steel, Egyptian table, High table, and Scamander (Fig.77); a fourth such work, Rape of the Sabines (Fig.74), was in- stalled at the Economist Building (both exhibitions to 25th October). All these pieces seem certain to intensify the controversy which Caro's recent direc- tions have caused among those who follow his sculpture. For, in the 1960s, Caro was celebrated for what The Times called 'out- and-out originality'; and yet the traditional, even conventional, character of these recent Caro's can hardly be denied. The Indian theme sculptures, with their intricate pass- ages and, in one case, even gilded surfaces, have more in common with Alfred Gilbert and the 'New Sculpture' of the 1880s, than with, say, the 'New Sculpture' of the 1980s. But this is not the first time that Caro's way of working has appeared to undergo far-reaching changes. Caro was born in 1924; as a young man, he spent much of his school holidays in the studio of Charles Wheeler, a prominent academic sculptor, best known for his telamons, carved in situ, at the Bank of England. About the time Caro worked for him, Wheeler would have been carving his heroic figures of Art and Industry for the Franco-British Exhibition in Paris. Caro's father remained implacably opposed to his desire to pursue sculpture as a profession; under family pressure, Caro read engineering at Christ's College, Cambridge. Finally, he was able to take up a place to study sculpture at the Royal Academy Schools, in 1947. Through his catalogue [1981] of as many of Caro's student works as he could identify, Dieter Blume revealed how skilfully and how diligently Caro had absorbed what Wheeler and the Academicians had to offer him. But, from 1951 to 1953, Caro worked as an assistant to Henry Moore. At this time Moore was making pieces such as the highly abstracted Reclining figure, 1951, an example of which is now in the Arts Council collection; later in the year, he turned to more volumetric versions of the same theme. Moore was also assimilating the influence of a visit to Greece which he made in 1951; his serenely draped figures, with their vigorously rucked and modelled clothing, confirmed his revaluation of the classical tradition. Little has survived of Caro's own work from this time; but he was soon to react against Moore as he had against Wheeler. Caro emerged from his formative years as an enthusiastic, if some- times lumpen, expressionistic modeller, whose squelchy figures were cast, often inelegantly, in bronze. All this changed again in 1959 when Caro met Clement Greenberg; Caro went to New York and became friendly with the post-painterly abstractionists, including Kenneth Noland, Helen Frankenthaler, and Jules Olitski. Greenberg also intro- duced Caro to the welded metal sculptures of David Smith. Caro's wife, Sheila Girling, has written that the effect of this visit was 'to call in question dependence on the con- ventions of traditional culture, and open the way to a more direct and free sculpture'. On Caro's return to England, the following year, he made Twenty-four hours, a piece which consists of three shaped planes of roughly cut painted steel. This work an- nounced Caro's adoption of new materials and working methods; throughout the 916</page><page sequence="2">EXHIBITION REVIEWS 75.

Caro's wife often painted the finished works in bright household colours. Over the next few years, Caro began to make those sculptures for which he is still best known - works like Midday (1960), Early one morning (1962), and Pompadour (1963), all of which were included in his exhibition at the Whitechapel Art Gallery in 1963. In the catalogue introduction, Bryan Robertson wrote that Caro had produced sculptures 'without any outside correspondences or parallels'. He stated that Caro's work contained 'no references to nature'. Caro, Robertson claimed, 'is really on his own'. Nonetheless, Caro's work seemed to reflect the prevalent Zeitgeist of the 1960s. His sculpture was conspicuously 'new', urban, and American-inspired - the aesthetic equivalent of the white-heat of Harold Wilson's technological revolution. Throughout the 1960s, Caro's influence as both a sculptor, and a teacher of sculp- ture at St Martin's School of Art, continued to grow. Caro attracted a voluminous litera- ture, written by American formalist critics. The starting point for their arguments was what Michael Fried called Caro's 'radical abstraction'. Similarly, for Clement Green- berg, Caro's 'breakthrough' was related to the 'radical unlikeness to nature' of his work. Both Fried and Greenberg argued that a Caro sculpture did not rely on 'illusion', but rather depended upon the creation of a non-referential 'syntax', which Greenberg defined as 'the relations of its discrete parts'. Some critics (though not Greenberg him- self) seemed to imply that the aesthetic value of Caro's sculpture depended upon the resoluteness with which he had pressed these technical and stylistic innovations. Such commentators tended to reserve their most extravagant praise for works such as Prairie (1967), in which an extended ex- panse of yellow steel appears to hover par- allel to the ground, and a couple of feet above it. For Fried, Prairie went 'further towards completely revoking the ordinary conditions of physicality than any other sculpture in Caro's wuvre'; while Richard Whelan wrote that this work 'changes for- ever our idea of what we can expect and gives us a new vision of the possible'. Such readings of Caro's work persist to this day; in his new book Anthony Caro,' Terry Fenton distinguishes Caro from Smith on the grounds that Caro's sculpture 'did not symbolize or represent [. . .] the shapes that composed it were just shapes'. It was, 'a new sculpture that aspired to the "con- dition of music"'. Caro has sometimes seemed to endorse such interpretations. As late as 1979, he said that 'in some new way', he foresaw his work becoming more rather than less abstract. But works like Midnight gap, 1976- 78, already showed such a complex textured surface of bumps and hollows that, to the present reviewer at least, Caro's construc- tion seemed to be seeking 'to convert itself into the modelling out of which it first sprang'. Similarly many of the Floor pieces, and most of the Writing pieces, of the early 1980s manifested 'a barely disguised, even if vigorously denied, pursuit of something which.., is so redolent with affective and physical illusion and allusion that it can legitimately be described as "imagery"'. Not everyone, therefore, was surprised when Caro began to make figurative pieces alongside his abstract steel sculptures, and combined the two ways of working in his Variations on an Indian theme (Figs.75 and 76). And yet there can be no doubt that these developments pose a challenge to the existing American, critical literature on Caro, which explains the importance of his work almost exclusively in terms of a 'breakthrough' to a 'radical abstraction' which went beyond Smith's in its thorough- going anti-anthropomorphism. Caro's re- cent works are among the most attractive and accomplished of his career; and yet they do not seem to want to 'go beyond' anything. Rather, they reach back to re- cuperate elements of the sculptural pursuit - like modelling, casting, figuration, sur- face patinas, imagery and illusion - which Caro had jettisoned on the way to his break-through. All this, of course, strongly suggests that the qualities of Caro's art require an expla- nation in terms other than those of the 'onward of art', and an 'advance' towards abstraction. Indeed, in the light of these recent developments in Caro's work, the voluminous American 'reading' of his sculpture seems more and more tenden- tious, the comparison with Smith, less and less rewarding. American formalist criticism, following Greenberg's example, has consistently tended to disregard, if not to denigrate, the achievement of Henry Moore. For example, in his book on Caro [1975], William Rubin argued that any sculpture that rises vertically before the spectator, 'retains by that very fact an inference of anthropomorphism even if it is not mono- lithic in character'. And so, Rubin main- tained, Caro's sculpture attained a more radical degree of abstraction than David Smith's, 'as much by virtue of its horizon- tality as its morphology'. And yet anyone who has attended to Henry Moore's work knows not only where the much vaunted 'horizontality' of works like Midday came from, but also that it no more excludes 'an inference of anthropomorphism' than does verticality. But the American critics could not admit this. It was axiomatic for them that, as Fried once put it, 'Caro's sculptures reject almost everything that Moore's stand for'. But most of Moore's figures did not 'stand' for anything; rather, as Caro seems to have noted, they reclined. Formalist criticism will have enormous difficulties in attempting to come to terms with Caro's recent achievement. In his new book, Fenton struggles manfully to do so, but is clearly somewhat bewildered by the Flats of the 1970s which, he reveal- ingly admits, 'looked like Henry Moore sculptures rolled flat'. Some of Caro's more recent works, like Scamander, involve curves, cavities and volumes. They look very like, say, the Working model for reclining figure (internal and external forms) (1951), or the large Recliningfigure (externalforms) (1953- 54), upon which Moore was working about the time that Caro served as his assistant. 917</page><page sequence="3">EXHIBITION REVIEWS 77.

This is not to impugn Caro's originality; it is rather to raise questions about the tra- dition to which his best work belongs. Caro's recent work confirms that the sources upon which he has drawn have been diverse and eclectic: it would be foolish to deny that they include American post-painterly aesthetics, Clement Greenberg, even certain aspects of David Smith; but equally they also in- clude - and, it should be stressed, always have included - something of Wheeler's classicism, and, as Greenberg himself once acknowledged, even English engineering design.... But the most powerful influence of all has been none of these things: rather it has been Henry Moore. 'I suppose he was a kind of father figure to me', Caro wrote on Moore's recent death. 'Really I learned how to be a sculptor from him - I followed him yet reacted against him, as a son does'.2 But these days, he seems to be, as it were, 'coming home' to Moore's hu- manist tradition on his own terms. In the future, critics will come to regard the much vaunted 'break-through' in Caro's work as an interlude, or a diversion. Far from drawing out from him his greatest achievements, American art, and American criticism, may in fact have temporarily, and partially, diverted Caro from the tra- dition which had most to offer him, and to which he might have made his most significant contribution. The most con- spicuous technical weakness in Caro's sculp- ture is its resolute planarity, its pictorial flatness; this is visible not only in Twenty four hours, but even in Midnight gap, and most recently in the Indian theme sculptures. Caro's sculptures tend to work from a single point of view; Moore's possess a complete cylindrical roundness, a richer and fuller expression of sculptural form. But Caro's American experience encouraged him to ac- cept this limitation, rather than to struggle beyond it, and to overcome it. This formal limitation seems, however, to be but an emblem of a deeper malaise. Moore's art, in contrast to Caro's, never aspired to 'radical abstraction'. Rather it was rooted in natural and organic form, and ulti- mately in the expressive potential of the human body itself. Moore sought to affirm a humanist and yet spiritual vision in fully sculptural terms. At his best, Caro wanted to do something similar; but the strait- jacket of fashionable American theory and practices deflected and inhibited him. Now, it seems, he is courageously endeavouring to rid himself of those constraints. PETER FULLER 'Anthony Caro. By Terry Fenton. 128 pp. inc. 172 ills., 98 in col.
