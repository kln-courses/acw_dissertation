The birth a century ago of immunology as a field of modern scientific inquiry was an outgrowth of the development of mod- ern microbiology and clinical investigation of human infectious diseases. For much of this century the disciplines of microbiol- ogy and immunology have drifted apart; 20 years ago immunol- ogy was a largely mysterious field that had anthropomorphic designations such as T cell "help," "thymic education," and "memory." There has since been revolutionary progress in our understanding of fundamental immunological processes at mo- lecular, genetic, and cellular levels; thus, the appearance of the third edition of Fundamental Immunology is timely. The significant breakthroughs that have been made in the study of antigen processing and recognition, lymphocyte signal-</page><page sequence="2">CID 1994; 19 (November) Book Reviews 997 ing and activation, and cytokines have reestablished the com- mon interests of immunologists, microbiologists, and infectious diseases clinicians. The contemporary perspectives that are pre- sented in the text will enable readers to reassess current clinical problems such as infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), AIDS, toxic shock syndrome; the development of recombinant vaccines; as well as classical conundrums such as gram-negative sepsis and tuberculosis. This 40-chapter reference book is not intended for cover-to- cover reading. As in the second edition, there is a multi-tiered approach to the material. The text begins with a brief but lucid overview of contemporary immunology. This is followed by a 10-chapter section that discusses the organization and develop- ment of the immune system, and the properties of antigens and their immune receptors. The third section (16 chapters) focuses on particular topics such as lymphocyte activation, accessory molecules, the major histocompatibility complex, aspects of im- mune regulation, and the various effector limbs of the immune response. The final 11 chapters explore the topic of immuno- logic mechanisms in disease, with specific attention to immunity to intracellular and extracellular bacteria, viruses, HIV, and par- asitology. There are also discussions on vaccines and primary immunodeficiency states. The word "fundamental" in Fundamental Immunology is not used in the sense of "basic," but rather in the sense of "essen- tial" or "central." This reference is a sophisticated and scholarly treatment of an increasingly complex field. Even the introduc- tory chapter exceeds the depth of most texts intended for medi- cal students. Although it was necessary to have multiple authors contribute to the book, overall the text has a consistent and pleasing style, and each chapter includes both historical and experimental perspectives. Incongruities in information from chapter to chapter are rare. Each chapter in this reference can be considered self-con- tained. One does not have to refer back and forth to different sections to pursue one topic to its conclusion. Subjects such as antigen processing, lymphocyte receptor molecules, accessory molecules, and cytokines are discussed in various contexts, de- pending on a chapter's particular focus. Although this approach adds to the size of the book, it greatly contributes to the ease of its use and to its readability. Clinical correlations with experimental data are appropriately noted throughout the book. The chapters are remarkably current, and most cite several hundred references; almost all of the chapters include references published in 1993. A future edi- tion of this text might benefit from the inclusion of a chapter exclusively devoted to natural killer cells. An appendix that lists the currently defined cell surface antigens together with their CD designations and ligands would also be helpful. Infectious diseases clinicians who have teaching responsibili- ties at all levels will find Fundamental Immunology to be an invaluable text, especially the final chapters on clinical immu- nology, which contain excellent references. This text also be- longs in the Fellow's room of every training program for in- fectious diseases specialists, as well as in the core collection of the medical reference section in hospital libraries.
