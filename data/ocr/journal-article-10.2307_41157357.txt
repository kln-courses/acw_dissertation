<plain_text><page sequence="1">Forum "The Dynamite of Thy Power" Religion in African-American Culture: Karl Wilhelm Dietz Memorial Conference held at Mainz, 5-6 December 1997 "Religion in African-American Culture" was the title of a conference held in memory of Dr. Karl Wilhelm Dietz, who taught American literature at Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, Germany, before he met an untimely death in 1987. Though his academic interests branched into a variety of fields, he is still best remembered for his doctoral dissertation on Ralph Ellison's novel Invisible Man (1952). Organized by the American Studies Division, the conference attracted a number of scholars active in the field of African-American studies from the United States, France, Great Britain, and Germany. Robert L. Hall (Northeastern University, Boston, MA) reconsidered the boundaries be- tween black and white culture in the antebel- lum South in his opening talk. Realizing that cultural boundaries tended to be flexible and fuzzy rather than clear-cut and static, Hall fo- cused on the dialogic relationship beween white churchmen and slaveholders on the one hand and the slaves they hoped to convert to their belief system on the other. Far from be- ing passive receptacles of Anglo-European culture, slaves adapted Christianity by a crea- tive act of interpretation. As Hall pointed out, the Western concept of the soul proved fertile ground for the construction of identity and group solidarity in reassuring slaves that their souls remained essentially indestructible, thereby allowing for a spirituality that would eventually find its expression in soul music. Nor did whites remain unaffected by the slave culture they tried to contain. Apart from the exchange of notes among white and black preachers, it was the camp meeting with its ritualistic enactments of conversion that turned out to be a crucible of African-Ameri- can and European culture. Nevertheless, in or- der to fully develop an identity of their own, slaves would often gather in secret "praise meetings" where their African heritage sur- vived unscathed in ritual dance and conjuring practices. Taking up the issue of cultural boundaries in his paper "Black Itinerant Preachers: Con- version to Empowerment?" Winfried Herget (Mainz) set out to trace nineteenth-century itinerant preachers who were not only black, but also female. Women such as Sojourner Truth and Zilpha Elaw contested spatial, ra- cial, and religious boundaries by preaching to racially and socially mixed audiences in the open, thus managing to escape the control of white church authority and the confinements of domesticity. In striving for "self-empower- ment," black women preachers not only used the Bible as a means of authentification, but also drew on the pattern of the Puritan con- version narrative that would allow for the construction of a communal identity. Rather than trying to represent the mystical union that figured so prominently in Puritan texts, however, these female preachers highlighted the process of reaching conversion in highly dramatic terms. The British view of African- American relig- ion was offered by Kirsten Raupach (Mün- ster) in her paper "The Art of Darkness - Representations of the Obeah-Woman in British Fiction." As a set of beliefs and relig- ious practices comparable to Voodoo, Obeah fascinated British writers in the late eight- eenth and early nineteenth centuries. Interest- ingly, their representations of Obeah men and women were largely modelled after European stereotypes of the witch. Yet, while male authors tended to depict Obeah men as insti- gators of revolt, thus viewing them as an es- sential threat to white culture, writers such as Charlotte Smith in The Story of Henrietta (1800) and Maria Edgeworth in The Grateful Negro (1801) focused on Obeah women. In doing so, Smith and Edgeworth highlighted the liberating forces of magic that would en- able whites to transcend the narrow experien- tial limits of their lives. The power of Voodoo also loomed large in nineteenth-century Louisiana, where, in the case of the famed Marie Laveau of New Or- leans, it entered an almost bizarre symbiosis with Catholicism, as Michel Fabre (Paris) demonstrated in his talk on "Catholicism and Voodoo: The Louisiana Creoles of Color in the Nineteenth Century." Whereas Catholi- cism was important to free blacks primarily</page><page sequence="2">156 Forum because it paved the way to education, Voo- doo, in turn, came to penetrate all social groups in New Orleans and thus served as a powerful crucible of black and white culture. For his discussion of nineteenth-century Cre- ole culture, Fabre had excavated a variety of little-known texts by Creole 'intellectuals' and writers on Catholic ceremonies. In his paper entitled "James Weldon Johnson's Biblical Tuning of God's Trom- bones" Manfred Siebald (Mainz) explored the catalytic power of the Bible in generating Johnson's innovative use of imagery. Johnson, a professed agnostic who nevertheless praised Christ's teachings for their lofty ethics, trans- planted Old and New Testament-figures into twentieth-century urban settings while draw- ing on the hermeneutic patterns of the Puri- tan sermon. As Siebald pointed out, Johnson 'tuned' his modernist poetry via "re-contextu- alizing" and "re-functionalizing" biblical fig- ures and by means of an "anthropomorphism" that rendered God in terms of black man or woman. Apparently, it is "the dynamite" of God's power that provides twentieth-century African Americans with a potent sense of their own dignity and humanity in the face of modern secularism. Christopher Mulvey (King Alfred's College, Winchester) examined the role of "Religion and History for Twentieth-Century African- American Intellectuals: W. E. B. DuBois, Eric Williams and Cornel West." Tracing the ideo- logical roots and socio-political contexts of DuBois's Souls of Black Folks, Williams's Capitalism and Slavery, and West's Race Mat- ters, Mulvey discussed the impact of these in- tellectuals on African-American culture as recognized and self-styled prophets. In doing so, Mulvey suggested that at the end of the twentieth century African Americans were in need of an intellectual and charismatic leader comparable to DuBois at the beginning of the century. Frank Kelleter (Mainz) concluded the first day of the conference with his presentation on "Born-Against Christians: Louis Farrakhan's Nation of Islam as an American Religion." Suggesting that the Million-Man March of 1995 must be interpreted as a crucial turning point in the history of twentieth-century black protest movements, Kelleter investigated the theological underpinnings of Farrakhan's Na- tion of Islam. The pun of Kelleter's title implies the double thrust of his argument, for while not being Ъотп-again Christians, Farrakhan and his followers ironically define themselves against Christianity in terms of an inverted Judeo-Christian rhetoric, thereby remaining largely dependent on the very religion they claim to reject. What is more, the NOI's apoca- lyptic preoccupation with "race" places its the- ology in close proximity to traditional Ameri- can millennarianism, Western nationalism, and contemporary esoteric movements, at the same time illustrating its distance from the religious doctrines of world Islam. Alfred Hornung (Mainz) opened the sec- ond day of the conference with his paper on "Religion and Afro-Modernism." Taking white modernist tenets such as Nietzsche's "trans- valuation of all values" or his proclaimed "death of God" as a starting point, Hornung set out to delineate the trajectories of a dis- tinctively Л/naw-American modernism in Jean Toomer's Cane and Claude McKay's The Green Hills of My Jamaica. As the main char- acteristics of 'Afro-Modernism,' Hornung identified the absence of modern disenchant- ment, the deeply experiential quality of relig- ion, and a holistic approach to body and mind that runs counter to the Cartesian concept of man. Yet apart from differences that in part were the result of African Americans' deliber- ate return to African sources, Hornung also discerned striking similarities between white and black modernism. For instance, T. S. Eliot's and Ezra Pound's concern for order and stability as epitomized by the Anglican Church, on the one hand, and Fascism, on the other, is strangely paralleled in Claude McKay's fascination with Catholic ceremonies as he encountered them during his trip to Spain, a fascination that would eventually feed his embrace of Fascism. Kerstin Schmidt (Freiburg) focused on two largely neglected one-act plays of the Harlem Renaissance in her paper "African-American Religion as Frame of Reference in African- American Folk: Richard Bruce's Sadjhi: An African Ballet and Georgia Douglas Johnson's Plumes: A Folk Tragedy" Drawing on Victor Turner's notion that "drama is to society what ritual is to religion," Schmidt showed in what ways Bruce and Johnson conjured up African ritual, myth, and superstition in an effort to forge an African-American identity. Whereas Sadjhi is a staged hunting feast of an Azanté tribe in ancestral Central Africa, Plumes takes place in a poor cottage in present-day Amer- ica. Calling up the tradition of the domestic play, Plumes uses the illness of a child to</page><page sequence="3">Forum 157 dramatize the clash between Anglo-European rationalism, as represented by a physician, and African superstition, as adhered to by the child's black mother. In her willingness to sac- rifice her little girl in order to save money for a 'proper' funeral, the mother, by sending away the doctor, not only demonstrates eman- cipation in the face of male dominance, but also displays a disturbing concern for what could be termed 'conspicuous burial.' In her presentation entitled "Mapping and Mirroring: Nella Larsen's and Ralph Ellison's Critiques of Religion," Thadious Davis (Van- derbilt University, Nashville, TN) focused on the role of Booker T. Washington in Nella Larsen's novel Quicksand (1928) and Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man (1952). According to Davis, both Larsen and Ellison viewed Booker T. Washington as a secular leader who employed preaching techniques in order to reach a more sophisticated level of black self- expression. In particular, their criticism aimed at Washington's (ab)use of religion in his at- tempt to secure the newly-gained status of middle-class blacks who would eventually turn their backs on lower-class African Americans and their folk ways. Whereas to Larsen folk tradition, despite its "spiritual beauty," was "marked for destruction," Ellison called for a new appreciation of African-American folk culture by deliberately voicing the black ver- nacular through his Invisible Man. Directing attention to what may well create one of this year's literary sensations, Robert G. O'Meally (Columbia University, New York) conveyed a first glimpse of Ralph Ellison's unfinished novel, which, thanks to the strenu- ous efforts of Ellison's literary executor, will be published in 1998. The title of O'Meally's paper - "Ralph Ellison's Invisible Novel: Of Spiritual Strivings and the Blues" - nicely re- flects Ellison's continuous interest in the kin- ship of religion and black music, an interest, however, that will figure more prominently in his posthumously published novel. For while Ellison had originally planned to make the protagonist of Invisible Man a preacher, his 'new' novel focuses on a certain Reverend Hickman who wears the telling nickname "God's Trombone" and adopts a young man of uncertain parentage called Reverend Bliss. One of the many ironies surfacing in the novel is that Bliss passes as white and eventu- ally ends up as a New England senator. Man- aging to convey Ellison's profound sense of humor, O'Meally traced the author's gradual abandonment of his earlier "tragic sense of life" in favor of Kenneth Burke's recognition that ultimately the comic was the best means of spiritual survival. The tragic, however, is painfully present in Gloria Naylor's most recent novel, as Heike Hartrath (Mainz) demonstrated in her paper "Biblical Allusions in Gloria Naylor's Bailey's Café." The novel provides two largely mythi- cal settings: Bailey's Café, which is a transi- tional place "that seems to be everywhere and nowhere at the same time," and Eve's board- ing house, which turns out to be the ultimate refuge for abused women. Surrounded by an almost Edenic garden, it is the boarding house rather than Bailey's Café that calls up a host of biblical characters (mostly female) and con- texts which Hartrath set out to identify. In do- ing so, she not only showed to what extent the fates of the abused women mirror those of the biblical women for whom they are named, but also showed how Naylor amplifies the im- portance of each of the biblical women by giv- ing her a voice and perspective that is largely missing in the biblical texts. Hence, Naylor uses the Bible to claim significance for her novel while at the same time inviting new ways of reading the Scriptures. In his presentation entitled "The Power of the Past: The Theme of Religion in August Wilson's Plays," Thomas Leuchtenmüller (München) turned to one of the most promi- nent representatives of a moderate national- ism in contemporary black theater. As Leuchtenmüller pointed out, Wilson blames white America for denying African Americans their cultural distinction. Therefore, Wilson's paramount concern is to raise an awareness of being "Africans in America." He does so by incorporating three kinds of ritual in his plays: rituals of talk and drink, purifying rituals, and healing rituals. To escape the pitfalls of cultural distinction, however, appears to be the goal of Robert Hayden's poetics, as Nassim W. Balestrini (Mainz) argued in her paper "Robert Hayden (1913-1980): Artistic Integrity and Religious Belief." A professed adherent to the Bahá'í faith, Hayden displays a long-term concern for retaining his artistic integrity in the face of bitter attacks from militant African-American groups, who have blamed him for betraying his cultural heritage by not subscribing whole- heartedly to their political agenda. Yet Hay- den never attempted to deny his racial affili- ation. Rather, as Balestrini pointed out, he en-</page><page sequence="4">158 Forum deavored to bridge the gap between cultural distinction (which his belief in Bahá'í neces- sarily entailed, on top of being African Ameri- can) and claims to artistic independence by focusing on characteristics that all human be- ings share. In search of the universal, Hayden not only reverted to a variety of styles, but also addressed a baffling range of themes. He thereby avoided becoming either a political propagandist or a religious teacher. The conference was aptly concluded by vo- calist Maxine Howard, whose expressive per- formance of gospels once again evoked the dynamite of God's power.
