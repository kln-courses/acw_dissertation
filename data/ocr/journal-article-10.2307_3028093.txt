<plain_text><page sequence="1">Relativity* By B. HOFFMANN Queens College, Flushing, N. Y. 1. Introduction. The mathematics of relativity is on the whole quite simple, the much advertised difficulties of the theory residing mainly in its physical implications, which run counter to some of our most cherished everyday notions. A first glance at the theory of relativity is invariably disappointing. One naturally expects an ad- mittedly important theory to concern its elf with admittedly impor- tant matters. Relativity, however, talks endlessly of space and time, and simultaneity and other familiar things. One forgets all too easily that such familiar things are of the first importance for physical science; that they are part of that shaky foundation on which is balanced the whole intricate and beautiful structure of scientific theory and philo- sophical thought. To tamper with them is to send a shudder coursing from one end of this vast frame to the other. And to effect successfully a profound change in our ideas concerning them, as Einstein did, is to create a revolution in science and philosophy of transcendental importance. In a short article such as this, much must be sacrificed for the sake of brevity, and rather than be general and vague I have tried to pre- sent a reasonably specific account of one particular part of the subject; the so-called special theory of relativity. Admittedly the general theory, bristling with tensors set in a Riemannian space, has greater purely mathematical interest, but the simplest approach to Einstein's revolu- tionary physical ideas is undoubtedly through the special theory. 2. On Newtonian Dynamics. Let us begin with the Newtonian laws of motion. Not the law of gravitation. That comes in much later. Simply the three laws of motion. These laws are far too well known to warrant repetition here. They may be found in the original Latin in any reasonably complete edition of Newton's Principia, and are given in elegant English prose in every text-book on dynamics. For our present purposes, let it suffice to say that they lead, with the usual notation and significance, to the equations. d dx (1) F =-- -i m d J dt 1. dt ) *This is the second of a series of expository articles written at the invitation of the Editors.</page><page sequence="2">6 NATIONAL MATHEMATICS MAGAZINE rd dy dt d dt dF r dz di dt . However, it may not suffice long. We have important questions to ask concerning these equations, questions concerning their con- ceptual background. For instance, precisely what are x, y, and z in (1)? And what is I ? What do we mean by the mass m ? Is the force (FZ,FV,Fz) something which produces a change of momentum in ac- cordance with (1), or is it perhaps just a convenient shorthand for the vector whose components are the right-hand sides in (1)? These and similar questions. Newton of course gave careful thought to such matters. Space- simple (x,y,z)-presented little difficulty, for Euclid and Descartes had done their work all too well. Newton adopted what they had developed, and space for him was an unbounded Euclidean nothing- ness, without form and void, and untouched by the many wondrous things within it. We shall see a quite different concept arising out of Einstein's researches. Time presented a more difficult problem, as you may readily convince yourself. Just look it up in the dictionary and see if you would care to construct a precise dynamical theory on what you find. In Newton's theory, time, like space, was untouched by the grosser things of the world, and remained aloof from all influence from material things, and even from space itself. One must mention these obvious things here since they are no longer regarded as true. Incidentally, in order to give time a really Olympian status, Newton asserted that it "flows uniformly", though he knew full well that such a statement is meaningless inasmuch as only time itself can time itself. Of mass, Newton said it measured the quantity of matter in a body, and this definition, for all its vagueness, suffices for the theory of relativity, though with surprising modifications of meaning. As to the Newtonian force, it must be admitted that the "short- hand" interpretation mentioned above is undoubtedly as good as any, despite our anthropomorphic feelings to the contrary. In the light of the general theory of relativity this interpretation remains the only reasonable one. Now that all this has been mentioned for the record, let us inves- tigate the behavior of the Newtonian equations of motion (1) under various transformations of coordinates. First let us change from the</page><page sequence="3">RELATIVITY 7 original coordinates (x,y,z) to new coordinates (x',y',z') moving with constant velocity v relative to the first. For simplicity we assume the axes initially coincident, and their relative velocity along the common x-direction. From the definition of relative velocity, limit of relative displacement divided by time taken, it follows that after time I the origins will have separated by a distance vi. The law of transformation at time I is therefore easily seen to be (2) x=x'+vt, y=y', z=z'. Though this is "easily seen", let us not lose sight of the fact that these transformation equations depend entirely on the Newtonian concepts of space and time. Neither the concepts nor the equations will remain unscathed as we proceed; nor, unhappily, will the relati- vistic equations of transformation be so "easily seen" as were these that are soon to be discarded. For the present let us mention that one ought perhaps to supple- ment (2) with (2a) but that to do this in Newton's theory would be to commit a redun- dance of the most pedantic type. Under the transformation (2), it is (once more) easily seen that the equations of motion remain unaffected. The moral in this instance is that this is not true unless the force is unaffected by the relative motion. This is a tremendous assumption, of course. In fact all our experience with forces seems against it. We find it much easier to grip a stationary body than one that is rushing past us, yet we are here assuming that a force-say gravitational-can grip a moving body as easily as if it were stationary. It may be a customary assumption, but it is surely not an obvious one. Moreover it is definitely untrue of electro-magnetic forces, as any physics text book will tell. The next step brings further revelations. We investigate the case in which the relative velocity is variable. It is enough to assume a constant acceleration a. The law of transformation at time I is now (3) x=x'+vt+ at2, y=y', z=z' and the Newtonian equations of motion become d dx' + (4) F=-- -m + ma, d ( dy' d dt L dt</page><page sequence="4">8 NATIONAL MATHEMATICS MAGAZINE d dz' dt dt J The presence of the ma-term shows that Newton's equations-and therefore Newton's laws of motion-are invalid in the new system of coordinates. This accords with our everyday experience. The first law of motion, for example, is obviously untrue relative to an acceler- ating train. Naturally Newton was well aware of this. Coordinate systems in which his laws are valid he called inertial systems. If the laws are valid in some particular coordinate system, they will be valid for all systems moving with constant velocity relative to it, and for no others. Thus all inertial frames have constant velocity relative to one another, and no experiment according to Newtonian dynamics can distinguish between them. Newtonian dynamics, in this sense, embodies that very ancient principle which asserts that all motion is relative; techni- cally, that all inertial systems are equivalent for the description of the laws of nature. This is the important principle of relativity, and we shall follow its fortunes through a surprising adventure. Before we leave this discussion of Newtonian dynamics we should mention a well-known trick which artificially saves the validity of the equations of motion for accelerated systems. All unwanted terms on the right-in (4) the term ma-are shifted bodily to the left with changed signs, and being now on the left, are referred to as fictitious forces introduced by the accelerations. Centrifugal forces due to rota- tions are a familiar example. Such forces can be just as powerful and destructive as the non-fictitious variety, and are "fictitious" only in the sense that they are best attributed to accelerations. The situation in Newtonian dynamics in this respect is quite unsatisfactory, and cannot be clarified until we reach Einstein's general theory of relativity. Incidentally, another dubious matter of analogous significance is the role of time measurement in the definition of an inertial system. For if one's clock were slowly running down, then all free motions would seem to be steadily accelerated, and an inertial system would seem unrealizable. Thus time plays an important, even though little men- tioned, part in the definition of inertial systems. 3. The Paradox. The successful development of the wave theory of light brought with it an important implication; the existence of an "ether" pervading all space. This ether could be used to define that elusive bird absolute rest. Motion relative to the ether would then be absolute motion, and the principle of relativity would be contradicted.</page><page sequence="5">RELATIVITY 9 Naturally, there was no reason why the principle of relativity should be above contradiction. That it was valid for Newton's equa- tions meant only that absolute motion could not be detected by purely mechanical experiments. It did not mean that optical experiments would fare no better. It was Maxwell who suggested that the absolute velocity of the earth-its velocity relative to the ether-could be detected by measur- ing the difference in the speed of light in perpendicular directions. He believed such an experiment far too delicate ever to have a chance of being performed. But he reckoned without the ingenuity of Michelson who, by his invention of the interferometer, brought an immense increase in sensitivity and precision to the armory of experimental physics. In 1887 Michelson and Morley performed their historic ether drift experiment along the lines suggested by Maxwell. To their amazement they found no difference at all in the speed of light in differ- ent directions; in other words, no motion relative to the ether. This negative result, obtained repeatedly, was in flat contradiction with the expectations of contemporary science. Not only did it actually support the somewhat discredited principle of relativity, but, far worse, it established that the measured speed of light is independent of the velocity of the experimenter through the ether. This is devastating. Imagine a lamp L and two observers, 0 and 0'. Let 0 remain at a fixed distance from L while O' moves towards L with velocity v. Then, evidently, if 0 measures the speed of the light waves coming from L to be c, O' must obtain the value (c+v). Yet, according to the incontrovertible evidence of the Michelson-Morley experiment, he will in actual practice obtain simply the value c. As W. S. Gilbert once remarked under rather different circum- stances* which, however, also had to do with a question of time, we have here "A paradox, a paradox, A most ingenious paradox!" Yet, as he said on another occasion, t you may "Search in and out and round about And you'll discover never A tale so free from every doubt- All probable, possible shadow of doubt- All possible doubt whatever!" *The Pirates of Penzance. tThe Gondoliers.</page><page sequence="6">10 NATIONAL MATHEMATICS MAGAZINE 4. The Special Theory of Relativity. In 1905 Einstein gave the resolution of the paradox in a remarkable paper On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies, propounding therein what we now call the special theory of relativity. In accordance with the evidence of the Michelson-Morley experi- ment, Einstein took as his basic assumptions essentially the following principles: I. The Principle of Relativity: all systems having constant velocity relative to one another are equivalent for the expression of physical laws; II. The speed of light is the same measured relative to all such systems. Now we have just seen that these lead to a serious contradiction. How then can we hope to build a consistent theory upon them? Ein- stein showed that the roots of the contradiction lay elsewhere; in our erroneous ideas of space and time, especially time. With inexorable logic he then extracted from his assumptions a new sort of space and time destined to have far reaching influence on physical theory. The first step in the argument is to destroy the usual notion of simultaneity at different places. This has to be done in face of enor- mous psychological resistances, but after the point is conceded every- thing else is comparatively smooth sailing. We begin very carefully by imagining a coordinate system S thickly studded with accurate clocks. If these clocks are exactly synchronous, it is a simple matter to determine whether two events at different places are simultaneous or not. If, for example, one event occurs when the clock nearest it says noon, and the other event occurs when the clock nearest it says noon, we may justifiably consider the two events simultaneous. Every- thing hinges now upon the synchronization of the multitudinous clocks. How are we to acheive this synchronization with theoretically infinite precision? Will it do to set all the clocks according to a master clock carried from place to place? This is not reliable, for accelera- tion of the master clock would jar its mechanism and thus destroy its value as a synchronizer.* To be on the safe side, Einstein proposed using II as the basis of synchronization. Consider two clocks A and B fixed at different places in the coordinate system S. Let light be sent from A when A reads ta; let it reach B when B reads tb; and let it be immediately reflected back *Even uniform motion of clocks is suspect in view of the Michelson-Morley ex- periment, which led Fitzgerald to suggest, and Lorentz to amplify, the idea that objects shrink when moving through the ether. A shrunken, elliptic-looking clock is certainly not to be trusted!</page><page sequence="7">RELATIVITY 11 to A, reaching it when A reads t4'. According to II, the time taken for the forward journey must be equal to the time taken for the trip back. We must therefore define the clocks A and B to be synchronous if and only if (5) tb-ta = ta tb. It is further to be assumed that every other correct method of defining synchronization must be esssentially equivalent to this. The defini- tion is a most reasonable one, and indeed all goes well so long as we re- main in one coordinate system. But observe what happens when we compare coordinate systems in relative motion. We need merely consider how the above synchroniza- tion looks to an observer using a coordinate system moving with velocity v relative to S. In S the path of the light looked like this A B and the times shown by the clocks A and B are such that the forward and backward journeys register equal intervals of time. In S', however, assuming it to be moving to the right relative to S, the path looks like this A ( A B&lt;-B According to II, the speed of light must be c for S' as well as for S. Thus S' will maintain that the forward journey took less time than the journey back, and will therefore vehemently deny that clocks A and B are synchronous. In view of I, it necessarily happens that S must spread identical gossip about the clocks of S'. Simultaneity at different places is thus seen to be a relative concept, depending on the motion of the coordinate system for which it is defined. Classical physics did not know of II, and consequently saw no difficulty in the above situation. It preserved absolute simultaneity by allowing speeds (c - v) and (c +v) for the light sent out by S as viewed by S'. Ein- stein accepted II, and in consequence was forced to reject the concept of absolute simultaneity. Rather than proceed pictorially as above, let us now obtain all the other peculiar results of the theory of relativity that we wish to discuss as mathematical deductions from the law of transformation between S and S' required by the basic postulates. The argument on simultaneity will have served its purpose if the initial assumption that</page><page sequence="8">12 NATIONAL MATHEMATICS MAGAZINE we now make appears reasonable, namely that a coordinate system must be considered as being studded with synchronized clocks, and that t must represent the time shown by the clock at the general point (x,y,i), and not simply "the time" in the absolute sense of classical physics. We must regard t as intimately related to (x,y,z) and must introduce a t' for S' similarly related to (x',y',z'). To simplify matters we assume S and S' initially coincident, with the clocks at the respective origins initially registering zero. We further assume S' to be moving with uniform velocity v relative to S along the common x-axis, this velocity being measured by S. * We shall leave z and z' out of our considerations. And finally, we shall introduce the quantity (6) _x-v1, since a point fixed in S' has a t independent of 1. With the preliminaries all settled, we begin by assuming a linear relation with constant coefficients between (x,y;t) and (x',y';t'), which implies a like relation between (Q,y;1) and (x',y';t'). So we write (7) xi = Ilit+mlyv +nit, y' =124+m2y+n2l, I' = l3U+m3y+n31. Now consider the synchronization by S' of a clock on his x'-axis with the clock at his origin 0', this synchronization being performed in accordance with the recipe previously given. Let the clock have the general position (x',O), and let its position according to S be given by (t,O). Suppose that the light leaves O' at t'=O, reaches x' at '= 11', and returns to O' at ' =12'. Then, by (5), S' must have 11' - = 12' - l', or (8) 2tl' = t2'. What does this equation become in terms of (j,y;t)? According to II, S must take the speed of light to be c. Therefore if I is the time, according to S's nearest clock, at which the light reaches x', this time must be equal to x/c, where x is S's measure of x"s position. So, using (6), we have c1=x= +vl *Though, as the sequel will show, it really does not matter whether S or S' meas- ures it.</page><page sequence="9">RELATIVITY 13 or (9) c-v and (7) now gives (10) 11'=13' +n3 c-v In a similar way, we find that the time I which corresponds to the re- turn of the light to 0' is given by (11)t= + c-v c+v And so, by (7) once more, the "k" in (7) now being zero because we are back at 0', we have (12) t2'=n3 j 2 + Ii On substituting from (10) and (12) into the synchronization equation (8) and simpJifying, we find that v (13) =n =0. If we perform a similar comparison of synchronizations along the y'-axis, it can be easily verified that we get y 2y_ (14) 11'=m3y+n3 -, 12_ = _n3__ i c2-v2 2 - _v2 which, in conjunction with (8), give simply (15) m3 =0.

Instead of going back to the first equation of (7), we may take a short cut by considering the progress of the synchronizing light sent out from 0'. Because of II, its position along the x'-axis at any moment must be described by S and S' respectively as (18) x=ct, (19) xi = ct,' where (x,t), (x',t') represent the same point and moment. We have already seen that (18) implies (9). On substituting in (19) from (16) and (9), using (6), and simplifying, we find (20) xi =n3132(X-vt). Next we describe the progress of light sent along the y'-axis. Here the analysis is a little different. According to S' we shall have (21) y'=ct' t but, as the accompanying velocity diagrams show, according to S we must have (22) y=Ic2-V2 I c In S, IIn S, c because C i c2 v2 according C of II: Ito Newtonian i fI cX |physics: / In SI: v v From (7), (15), and the fact that t is here zero, we have (23) t'P=n3.

If we write a(v) for nA3, we may put them in the form (25) x' = a(v),(X-vt), y' = a(v)y, t'=a(v)f3[t- v x1 J All that remains is somehow to determine the function a(v), and then we shall have found the transformation we are seeking. Einstein solved this remaining problem in a very simple way. He introduced a third coordinate system S", having axes parallel to those of S', and moving relative to it with velocity v in the negative x'-direction. To assume that S" is the same as S would be highly improper since in one case v was measured by S, and in the other by S'. However, we may apply (25) in going from S' to S" provided we change the sign of v-and, of course, put in appropriate primes. And if we do this, it turns out that the final transformation from S directly to S" takes the simple form (26) x" =a(v)a(-v)x; y" =a(v)a(-v)y; I" =a(v)a(-v)t. Since the relationship between (x",y") and (x,y) does not contain I explicitly, the two systems S" and S must be at rest relative to each other, and under the present circumstances must therefore be coin- cident. Therefore a(v)a(-v) must have the value unity. But, as a moment's reflection will show, considerations of symmetry affecting they-axes require that a(v) and a(-v) shall be equal. Hence we must have a(v) = - 1. Moreover the (-1) may be ignored as contributing nothing essential that the (+ 1) does not supply. Hence, finally, we arrive at the long awaited law of transformation between S and S': (26) x' =,B(x-vt), y/=Y; z'=z, ev It is now a simple exercise in algebra to prove the important result that the inverse transformation is (26') x = (x' +vt'), Y=Y,; z=z',</page><page sequence="12">16 NATIONAL MATHEMATICS MAGAZINE t=Ap t'+-- I_' a result which one would expect on physical grounds. The transformation (26), or (26'), was first discovered by Lorentz, and is therefore called the Lorentz transformation. However, Lorentz argued along entirely different and far less general lines, and his inter- pretation of the transformation was quite restricted. In fact, most of the implications we shall now deduce from the transformation cannot be legitimately derived in terms of Lorentz's ideas. A. Lengths. Consider a rod lying at rest in S' along the x'-axis, with its ends at x'= x1', x'=x2'. Its length is (x2'-x1'). At least that is what S' says. What does S think? If, as the rod rushes by, he notes that the ends, as observed simultaneously at = to, are at x = x1 and x = x2, he must say the length is (x2- xi). But since S and S' never agree about simultaneity, they will disagree about the length of the rod. Specifically, we have, from (26), x2' = (x2-vto) and x1' = (x1 -vvo), whence by subtraction we find (27) (x2'-x1') = 3(x2-x1). Since, by (17), ,B &gt; 1, we see that the "rest length", (x2' -x1'), is greater than the length when the rod is moving past the observer. In other words, objects contract when in motion.* Note that c plays the part of a maximum relative velocity, because of the factor j3 in (27). B. Time Intervals. Let a clock C, permanently at the fixed point (xo',O,O) in S', strike when it reads tl', and again when it reads t2'. Then, dccording to S', the time interval between the strokes is (t2'-tl'). S measures this time interval by first noting the reading of that particular one of his set of synchronous clocks which happens to be nearest to C when it first strikes, and then repeating the procedure (using, of course, another of his clocks) for the second stroke. If the two readings are t1 and t2, then S must maintain that the time interval is (t2-t1). By (26'), t we have t2=3[t2'+ :xo'J and ti=4&gt;tl'+-2-xo whence (28) (t2-1t) = 13(t2'-tl'). *The contraction here found is identical in amount with that proposed by Fitz. gerald and Lorentz. t(26') is used here in preference to (26) because xo' is constant and the algebra is easier when xo' enters the transformation equation for the times explicitly.</page><page sequence="13">RELATIVITY 17 That this shows that clocks in motion go more slowly than clocks at rest relative to an observer we shall leave for the reader to puzzle out. To complete this picture of how lengths and time intervals behave we make one further remark. Because of I, it turns out that while S is insisting that S"s lengths have shrunk and his clocks slowed down, S' maintains just the same things about S! C. Addition of Velocities. Let a point P move along the x'-axis with velocity u as measured by S'. We seek its velocity relative to S. Newtonian physics would say that it is (u+v), but relativity gives a different answer. If (x,t) and (x',t') describe the motion of P in S and S' respective- ly, then dx'/dt' will be u, and dx/dt will be the resultant velocity we seek. From (26'), dx = (dx'+v dt') and v dt=f dt'+ --dx' c2 So, on dividing top and bottom of the ensuing fraction by dt', we have dx dx'+vdt' u+v (29) Resultant Velocity= = -= dt v uv dt'? -dx' 1 +-- This relativistic law for the composition of velocities differs from the Newtonian law essentially because u and v are measured in different coordinate systems, this being the case of physical importance. Were u and v measured in the same system, the Newtonian law would prevail even in the theory of relativity. But to reduce v to its measure in S we had to use the Lorentz transformation, and all the peculiarities of length and time which go with it had full play. Try the effect of com- bining velocities u and c according to this formula. The result will give yet another illustration of the fact that c is a limiting velocity. Naturally a theory which produces such startling results as those we have just found must cause a tremendous upheaval in physical science, and must provide many novel results capable of experimental investigation. The special theory of relativity has been most excel- lently confirmed by experiment, and has contributed to many branches of science. On the purely kinematical level, (27) and similar formulas explain many hitherto obscure points in optical theory, centering around the celebrated "drag coefficient" of Fresnel. Before we may proceed to the dynamical implications of the tbeory, we must mention, however briefly, the important aspect of the Lorentz transformation treated in the following section.</page><page sequence="14">18 NATIONAL MATHEMATICS MAGAZINE 5. The Four-Dimensional World. It was the pure mathematician Minkowski who discovered that the Lorentz transformation has a singularly beautiful geometrical significance. In the sense that four coordinates (x,y,z,t) are needed to specify the spatial and temporal location of an event relative to a reference system, we may look upon the world of physics as four-dimensional. This is not peculiar to relativity; it is also true of the Newtonian theory. Indeed, it is even true of both theories that the quantity (30) ds2 = c2dt2 - dx2 - dy2 - dz2 is invariant under their respective types of transformations, as may be quickly verified. However, in Newtonian physics ds2 is not a natural invariant but breaks up into two separately invariant parts, c2dt2 and the rest. In relativity (x,y,) and t get well mixed together by a Lorentz transformation and ds2 behaves as a single invariant. In fact, as Minkowski demonstrated, the transformation (26) is simply a rotation of coordinate axes about the xt -plane in the four dimensional space of (x,y,z,t), with ds the element of interval in this space just as i dx2+dy2+dz2 is the element of distance in Euclidean space. Owing to the minuses in (30), the Minkowski space-time is hyperbolic, and the rotations involve hyperbolic instead of circular functions. For instance, (26) represents a rotation of coordinate axes in space-time through an "angle" v tanh-1- while (29) is essentially the formula for tanh (ca+#) with U V tanh a - and tanh 13=- c c The baffling contractions of length and dilations of time intervals also have a simple significance in the Minkowski world. They turn out to be nothing more than a foreshortening effect due to the difference in perspective between two sets of axes differently oriented in space time. Minkowski's discovery put the whole of relativistic physics as then developed on a geometrical basis, and displayed the so-called theory of relativity as a theory of the absolute in a four-dimensional world. It was probably the most important contribution made to the theory of relativity by anyone except Einstein himself, and had a profound influence upon the subsequent course of the theory.</page><page sequence="15">RELATIVITY 19 6. Relativistic Dynamics. The principle of relativity, I, especially in connection with the work of Minkowski, is of tremendous practical value, and will be a key principle in the present discussion of dynamics according to the special theory of relativity. The need for a relativistic dynamics is evident from the curious behavior of space, time, and ve- locity displayed in ?4. It is made quite definite by the fact that the Newtonian equations (1) are not invariant under a Lorentz transforma- tion, and thereby conflict with I. Our task is to construct alternative dynamical equations which shall accord with I, and shall yet differ from (1) as little as possible; for despite the many hard words we have uttered against the Newtonian equations, we must admit they are extraordinarily successful. When we view this problem from the point of view of Minkowski, we find several suggestive ideas which are by no means obvious from any other viewpoint. For instance, if we are to write a vector equation in four-dimensional space, it must have four component equations, and not three. Again, since x, y, z, and t enter the Minkowski world on an almost equal footing, it is apparent that we may not initially use dx/dt, etc. in our equations since such expressions give to t a special distinction not accorded the other coordinates. Let us consider a particle with space-time coordinates (x,y,z,t) moving with velocity v relative to the coordinate system. From (30) we find ds 2 dx 2 dy 2 dz 2 r ds dx 2 r_ dy 1 _ r dz 2 whence dt (31) C ds ds Thus for ordinary velocities, dt has practically the same value as -ds, and since ds is an invariant of space-time we may tentatively use -ds c</page><page sequence="16">20 NATIONAL MATHEMATICS MAGAZINE in place of dt in the Newtonian equations. The most natural four- dimensional modification of these equations along such lines is the set d dx d dy (32) PX = C i- m P = C2 -- II ds ds ) " ds ds) d dz_ d ( dt P z= C2y4 M iP =c2-- I i-- ds ds ~~ds I. ds where m is a constant measuring the amount of matter in the body, and the entity (Px,Py,P,,P,), reminiscent of the Newtonian force vector (Fx,Fy,Fz), must transform like a four dimensional vector, such as (dx, dy, dz, dt), in order that Lorentz invariance shall be achieved. The four-vector (Px,P ,PZ,P,) is not the force, and strictly speaking Newtonian terminology has no place in relativity. However scientists continue to use such terminology, and curious consequences of the theory theory of relativity arise from attempts to fit relativistic laws into classical moulds. In order to discuss the meaning of (32) we must make just such an attempt here. When the particle is stationary relative to the coordinate system, ds has the value c dt, and the first three equations of (32) become the same as the Newtonian equations (1), with (Px,Py,Pz) corresponding to the Newtonian force. The fourth equation yields P, = m, which has no significance for us at present. Let us now consider in detail the appearance equations (32) take on when the particle is moving relative to the coordinate system with velocity v. To make comparison with Newtonian physics, we must first replace d/ds by d/dt by means of (31). This gives for (32) 1 x d rO dx ' 1 d rO dy (3 dt dt)1 } dt {m dt} 1 PZ= d MO dz 1 d dt dt) 'i di According to Newton, force is equal to the time rate of change of momentum. We must therefore interpret 1 a (PxpPv^Z) as the force and mif (dx/dt, dy/dt, dz/dt) as the momentum. It is the latter which is of immediate interest; for if we wish to retain the New-</page><page sequence="17">RELATIVITY 21 tonian nomenclature-as we do-and say that momentum is mass times velocity, then since the velocity is certainly (dx/dt, dy/dt, dz/dt) we are obliged to interpret m,8 as the mass. We write (34) M = mg, and call M the relative mass. When v is different from zero the relative mass is larger than the "rest mass" m, and approaches an infinite value as v approaches the velocity of light c. Thus the faster a body moves the heavier it becomes, and by the time it attains a velocity c no finite force can accelerate it since it then has infinite mass. The kinematical principle that c is a limiting velocity in relativity here takes on a dynamical significance. Moreover formula (34) has been directly verified by experiment on moving electrons. The fourth equation of (33) throws further light on the problem of mass. From (30) we have dt 2 dx 2 _[ dy 2 _ dz 2 I. ds ds ds ds If we differentiate this with respect to s and then divide by 2dt/ds, we obtain d2t d2x dx d2y dy d2z dz C 2 = + +--+- ds2 ds2 dt ds2 dt ds2 dt If we now multiply by mC2, use (31), and replace 1 -(PX,Pv,P.) by (Fx, FV, Fz) in accordance with the interpretation of the first three equations of (33), we find that Pt dx dy dz C2 A=FX d +Fy d +Ft dt 13 dt di dt The right-hand side has an immediate Newtonian interpretation. It is th'e scalar p'roduct of force and velocity, and therefore the rate at which work is being done on the particle by the force. Denoting the work by W, we may therefore write Pt dW 0 d!</page><page sequence="18">22 NATIONAL MATHEMATICS MAGAZINE This in itself is of little interest, but yields a result of the highest im- portance in conjunction with the last equation in (33). For the two together give dW d d (35) =C2 ~(Mj) =--(Mc2)P dt dt dt and this states that the rate work is done on the body, which, according to the law of conservation of energy, is the rate of change of its energy, * is equal to the rate of change of c2 times its mass. Mass and energy must therefore be essentially the same sort of thing, and an increase AM in the mass of a particle will be equivalent to an increase c2AM in i ts energy. This extraordinary doctrine receives an elegant mathemati- cal confirmation if we consider a coordinate system in which the parti- cle under discussion was initially at rest, and let a force acting on it ultimately give it a velocity v relative to this coordinate system. For then, by (34) and (17), we have c2AM=c2m{ [1i-- j - } =Imv2+ which, to a high degree of approximation is just the Newtonian ex- pression for the increase in the kinetic energy of the particle. When Einstein discovered the relationship between mass and energy, experimental confirmation was impossible. Nowadays, how- ever, a quarter of a century later, conversions of matter into energy and energy into matter such as Einstein predicted are a routine observa- tion in nuclear research, and Einstein's formula has been confimed up to the hilt. Of the many other successful applications of the special theory of relativity, especially in the quantum theory, we may give no further indication here. There are other matters to be considered. 7. The General Theory. The success of the special theory of relativity convinced Einstein that other, more general things must also be true, and after ten arduous years he produced a general theory of relativity within which the special theory was a mere incident. Un- fortunately not even the general theory can prevail against limitations of space-in the editorial sense-and we must be content here with but a brief indication of the scope of Einstein's monumental con- ception. The Newtonian law of gravitation, not being invariant under a Lorentz transformation, clearly needed revision; and modified, Lorentz- *Since the work done by the force is always equal to the energy gained by the body.</page><page sequence="19">RELATIVITY 23 invariant laws were in fact not hard to find. Einstein alone among physicists saw that such simple modifications were superficial, and that a satisfactory theory of gravitation was to be obtained only through a profound generalization of the relativity concept. The special theory of relativity had brought about a vital change in the status of the principle of relativity. What had hitherto been a more or less arbitrary, experimental principle of dynamics became, in Minkowski's four dimensional world, a geometrical commonplace. It said simply that one set of rectangular coordinates was as good as another for describing four dimensional geometry. Now why should one stop at rectangular coordinates? Surely a geometrical configura- tion must be independent of whatever coordinates are used to describe it, whether rectangular or curvilinear. All coordinate systems must be equivalent for describing the geometry of space-time. This simple geometrical commonplace takes on a tremendous significance when translated into the language of physics. It requires that III. All possible coordinate systems (that is, coordinate scaffoldings together with their sets of clocks) must be equivalent for the ex- pression of physical laws. And this generalized principle of relativity immediately stubs its toe against one of the most elementary facts of dynamical experience. For, according to III, an accelerated system must be equivalent to one that is unaccelerated. But, as we saw in ?1, experience tells us otherwise. Free bodies do not move in straight lines with uniform velocity relative to accelerated systems and we can thus clearly dis- tinguish between accelerated and unaccelerated ones. What hope is there, then, for the survival of III? There is still hope. Let us consider what effect the acceleration of a system produces. It causes a relative acceleration of all bodies independent of their masses. Does this not stir up memories of Galileo and Pisa? By a most extraordinary piece of good fortune, it happens that gravitation produces precisely the same effect. We have no need now of giving up III. If someone asserts that his coordinate system is accelerated, we can blandly inform him he is entirely mistaken; that his system is unaccelerated, and that the accelerational effects on which he bases his claims are in fact the manifestations of a gravita- tional field. No experiments he may perform can decide the issue for him. We have identified his fictitious forces as gravitational forces, which produce identical effects. Our position is impregnable, and we reach the momentous conclusion that if a theory is to be constructed in</page><page sequence="20">24 NATIONAL MATHEMATICS MAGAZINE accordance with III, it must embrace gravitation. There is a signifi- cant and encouraging fact to be considered in this connection. Ac- cording to all previous concepts it is indeed an extraordinary piece of good fortune that gravitational and accelerational effects should be so conveniently identical.* In a theory of gravitation based on III, their identity must cease to be a mystery for it will become a simple matter of definition. The precise pltace where gravitation must enter the mathematics of such a theory is clearly indicated, for it must occur wherever accelera- tion makes an appearance. Therefore let us consider the formula for the element of interval ds in space-time. A Lorentz transformation leaves the form (30) invariant. A transformation representing an acceleration, however, spoils the simplicity of the form. From a con- sideration of relatively rotating coordinate systems, Einstein was able to demonstrate that the (x,y,z,t) measured by rods and clocks can no longer be regarded as necessarily rectangular, rectilinear coordinates having a direct metrical significance, but must be looked upon as general, Gaussian coordinates of space-time. From this he pointed out that ds2 must be a general quadratic form 4 (35) ds2= E ga dXadXb, (dXl,dx2,dx3,dx4) (dx9 dy, dz, dt), a,b=1 the coefficients gab being in general functions of position and time. In (30), gll, g22, g33, each had the value (-1), and g44 had the value c2, while all others, such as g,2, were zero. Acceleration of the coordinate system has the effect of altering these specially simple values of the g's, and inasmuch as acceleration shows itself in these g's, it follows that they must also be the seat of gravitational phenomena. The g's in the general theory of relativity characterize simultaneously the type of coordinate system used and the gravitational field present. In order that ds shall be invariant under all transformations-and without some such invariant measurement could not be defined-the g's must be the components of a second rank covariant tensor, and they form in fact the familiar metric tensor of Riemannian geometry. There still remains the problem of setting up field equations of gravitation to replace the Newtonian law, and here we find one of the most beautiful aspects of the general theory of relativity. For, if one requires simply that these field equations shall be tensor equations containing only the g's and their first and second derivatives, and that certain divergence relations between them shall be fulfilled which cor- respond to the laws of conservation of momentum and energy and at *In Newtonian parlance, this is because the gravitational and inertial masses of a body are always proportional. No explanation for this is possible in Newtonian theory, yet it is a very well attested experimuiital fact.</page><page sequence="21">RELATIVITY 25 the same time insure that non-trivial solutions of the equations shall exist, then the field equations are essentially uniquely determined. This is a far cry from the arbitrariness of the Newtonian law of gravi- tation. The field equations to which one is thus inevitably led turn out to involve the Riemann-Christoffel curvature tensor, and imply that gravitation is but the manifestation of a curvature of space-time. And with gravitation taking on this geometrical significance we find Min- kowski's geometrical ideas carried to a conclusion Minkowski was unable to foresee. The great Riemann himself, as far back as 1850, had sought such a theory of gravitation and other phenomena, but his attempt, as we now realize, was foredoomed to failure for he did not know the world is truly four dimensional. The astronomical predictions of the general theory of relativity and their successful confirmation are well known. But the greatness of the theory rests on a surer foundation than just this, for it also re- moves many of the major philosophical diffilulties hitherto associated with physical theory. As a field theory it avoids the objectionable concept of action at a distance. It deposes space and time from their lofty thrones and makes them subject to experiment instead of axiom, and it shows that experiment decides definitely against the spurious claims of Newtonian time and'Euclidean space. Its laws are invariant un'der all transformations of coordinates, among which are those of the type x'=x, y'=y, `'=z, I'=f(t). It therefore gives no philosophical preference to a specially "accurate" chronometer over and above any quite variable watch, and so avoids the philosophical problem of try- ing to define an absolute standard of time which shall flow uniformly. It likewise avoid* the similar problems connected with defining stand- ards of length which shall be forever invariable. The standards of length and time we set up are merely conveniences in the spreading of a web of coordinate lines over space-time with which to ensnare the elusive true invariarnts of the world; not standards of length and time, but the motion of light, the curvature of the world, the paths of planets, and other things not the invention of man. And this is indeed the whole of the general principle of relativity, that physical phenom- ena can have no concern for our whims and preferences for one system or another but must transcend all such petty considerations. Here is to be fou4nd the ultimate reason for general invariance, and here, in the very naturalness and simplicity of it's basic assumption, resides the real triumph of the theory of relativity. The enormous range of the theory, its striking success, an,d its mathematical and philosophical elegance and economy combine to pjace it among the noblest creations of the human mind, and proclaim its creator one of the greatest scien- tists in the history of the world.</page></plain_text>
