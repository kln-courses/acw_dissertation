<plain_text><page sequence="1">A. K. WEATHERHEAD Backgrounds with Figures in Iris Murdoch BEHIND THE ENDLESS VARIATIONS IN IRIS MURDOCH'S NOVELS IS A PARA- digm, darkly visible, in which one character enters into the orbit of an- other who is an enchanter to him or her and then subsequently with- draws from it. The enchanter desires and sometimes explicitly calls for the adoring gaze of unreciprocated love, caught in which he (or she, ob- viously) "feels full, compact and justified." The idea that by obtaining and basking in the love of another a man or a woman can attain, even if only momentarily, to some stability of being, Miss Murdoch derives from Sartre, and the words quoted are from her book on him. The idea is important in any discussion of the novels since all their plots are in- debted to it; and I have thus paid some attention to it below. At the same time, an attempt to describe the singularity of her feeling for hu- man nature, the individual quirks of her novelistic handwriting as it were, must also take into account the peculiar use she makes throughout the novels of people's environments. If we maintain an elastic concep- tion of what constitutes environment, now broad enough to cover a man's country and now narrow enough to designate his body as the background of his mind, sometimes including the furniture in a room and sometimes the scenery beyond its windows, we shall find that in the transactions in which characters are involved as they move into the enchanter's influence and out again it plays such a significant role that very frequently the drama must be considered as enacted not only be- tween person and person but between person and environment. It is al- ways an important element in the novels, and Miss Murdoch's treatment of it is consistent. The unusual significance of environments shows itself variously. Cer- tain individual features in which it is manifest are not peculiar to Miss Murdoch; but the combination of so many of them and the deliberate intensity with which she uses them distinguish her from others. Many a novelist, for instance, has colored dialogue by throwing over it such shadows as those of a jail cell or the lights of a Gloriani's garden. But when Miss Murdoch uses background for atmosphere there is often an unusually grotesque or ironic bite, as when Calvin Blick makes his rev- elations to Rosa in The Flight from the Enchanter upon a terrace cov- ered with ants or when, in An Unofficial Rose, certain ancient monu-</page><page sequence="2">636 A. K. WEATHERHEAD ments of Rome, each one named, serve as the backdrops for the succes- sive copulations of Randall Peronett and Lindsay Rimmer. Often a background is given a kind of life of its own: in Peter Saward's room, in The Flight from the Enchanter, on one silent occasion it was "as if all the books were breathing quietly"; in another passage, reminiscent of Dickens, we learn that the ceiling alone of all the room's surfaces was not covered by books but that it "had in the course of the years developed first cracks and slight undulations, and later knobs, bulges and protuberances of all kinds, as if in irresistible sympathy with the walls and floor." In A Severed Head, when Martin loses his wife he finds that the furnishings of the house grieve like persons: "They knew and mourned" ; in The Red and the Green, some Dublin houses "seemed to know" that they represented the most beautiful dwellings ever in- vented. One interesting instance of the endowment of an environment with human characteristics occurs in a remark in The Unicorn in which Hannah says she has made the landscape "unreal by endlessly looking at it." She seems to be accusing herself of the attitude that in personal re- lationships Sartre has called "bad faith" - briefly, the considering of an- other person as an object; but obviously before one could be guilty of such an attitude toward a landscape, one would have had to have ele- vated it to human status. The anthropomorphism, however, is of minor significance compared with the unusual intimacy with which backgrounds are related to peo- ple: Miss Murdoch seems to conceive of personality as residing partly in a man's physical environment. Thus, just as some London women suffered neuroses when their houses were bombed in the forties, so a character whose background is injured or lost to him suffers trauma as if he were wounded in person; Martin suffers so in A Severed Head when the jointly owned Audubon prints are shared up and half of them removed. Sometimes when a character is influenced by another it is ex- pressly to the latter's setting that he responds; in A Severed Head, again, though it may not be a very unusual occurrence, Martin falls in love with Geòrgie not on first sight of her but on first sight of her bed. Or a char- acter willing to be possessed permits another to see his setting, as Martin brings Geòrgie to Hereford Square, or Hugh Peronett, in An Unofficial Rose, brings Emma Sands to Grayhallock. Edmund, in The Italian Girl, who is to be possessed by Flora, finds on his arrival at the family house that she has taken over his room. Again, one character may be thought of by another in bad faith as merely a part of a setting, as Randall comes to think of Ann towards the end of An Unofficial Rose or as the Lusie- wicz brothers in The Flight from the Enchanter think of the mother,</page><page sequence="3">Backgrounds with Figures in Iris Murdoch 637 who is "stored there in the corner of the room" along with other furni- ture. If the background supplied by a room or a house is an extension of personality, then understandably clothes will constitute an even more intimate one. Certain characters, not all, are unwilling to divest them- selves - Randall, for example, on the occasion of his first sexual exploit with his mistress, Lindsay Rimmer. Andrew, in The Red and the Green, is in part defined by his cavalry uniform: he wears his spurs to go to a tea party; he is "ludicrously" slow in removing his jacket when fishing for an earring in a lily pond; and when this symbolic circumstance be- comes an actual occasion and he is in bed with Millie, he longs for his clothes. Even the body may be thought of not as a part of the whole self but as an extension of it, as if it were a background to something more essentially personal. The idea that a severed head is not the whole per- son is argued in the novel so titled, and we are reminded of Ransom's poem "Painted Head" in which the honor paid to the head and the pursuant Platonic contempt for the body are a "capital irony." In The Red and the Green, on the other hand, Pat Duval wishes he were merely a head, or at least a pure will, resenting the extension of self into the incubus of his body, which though "supple and hard" is "white, white as an underground defenceless thing." Implementing her conception that personality includes backgrounds, Miss Murdoch has certain stylistic devices that she repeats over and over again. We are, for instance, not invariably but very often introduced to the details of a room or a house before we are introduced to the person who inhabits it; thus when we do meet the owner we are already pre- disposed toward him, for his environment has already shown us some- thing of what we must expect. Equally often the introduction to the background is made by a character trespassing or at least bursting in un- announced: doorbells don't work well in Miss Murdoch's world and are often ignored when they do, and thus a character entering suddenly is afforded a scene with figures frozen in a tableau or simply a view of the background of another person - a view somewhat intensified for him and for us by our respective fears that he will be caught. Over and over again in the novels we are shown a character studying the room of another in his absence ; it is one of this novelist's favorite devices. Before considering certain novels to see the intimacy with which back- ground is related to plot, we should look a little more intently upon the action that seems to be the lowest common multiple of all the novels, the character's movement into and away from the orbit of an enchanter. First, the initial move may liberate a character from an environment in</page><page sequence="4">638 A. K. WEATHERHEAD which there is already a kind of spell exerted upon him by his mother or a mother figure. Through Fanny, his mother, Grayhallock has exerted such a spell upon Randall Peronett, for example; the Hereford Square house has had a maternal influence upon Martin; the room of the Lusiewicz brothers is presided over by the spirit of the old mother; the house in The Italian Girl is powerfully charged with the personality of the dead mother; and so on. Then, moving into the orbit of the stronger enchantment, a character comes under the influence of a man or a woman who calls for unrecipro- cated love, "the steady adoring gaze of the lover" (who need not be of the opposite sex) . Reproducing Sartre's views on this subject, Miss Mur- doch writes: Love is one of the forms under which we pursue stability of being. Stability derives here from the steady adoring gaze of the lover, caught in which the beloved feels full, compact and justified. "Love is essentially the urge to make oneself loved." But the lover demands a similar returning gaze, and is free at any moment to withhold his own. If the beloved dominates the lover so as to fix and hold his admiration, this destroys the value of the re- gard which is only prized so far as it is freely given. If the beloved basks passively before the lover the latter remains unsatisfied. Reciprocal love is therefore precarious, if not impossible, and readily moves toward the satis- factions of sadism and masochism (varieties of domination or basking) .1 The involvement of as many people as possible in as many varieties as possible of unilateral love relationships seems to be the main business of Miss Murdoch's novels. Again and again in the novels we run into per- sons who demand the unreciprocated gaze of love, while others, as we have seen, will at first supply and then later withdraw it. Among those whose demand is more or less explicit are Emma Sands, who wants to punish Hugh for having earlier withdrawn his gaze; Hannah, in The Unicorn, who lives in Castle Gaze and asks for love, confessing toward the end of the novel, "I have lived in your gaze like a false God"; Maggie, in The Italian Girl, who admits that she had contrived to get herself noticed by Edmund ; and Aunt Millie, in The Red and the Green, whose schemes to attract love are crude and obvious. There are many other men and women in the novels who play, as these do, for part of the time at least, the role of the enchanter. For any one of the novels the title of the second, The Flight from the Enchanter, would have been appropriate; for, having come under its sway, characters regularly liberate themselves from enchantment in one way or another and return to their sources, bringing with them or find- 1 Iris Murdoch, Sartre: Romantic Rationalist (New Haven, Conn., 1953), p. 65.</page><page sequence="5">Backgrounds with Figures in Iris Murdoch 639 ing there elements associated with the mother figure and the other en- chanter. What drives a character to leave the environment in which we first find him and to submit to the spell of the person who demands his love is not clearly articulated; in certain novels, as will appear, the motive is a conscious desire to give form to life; but most often the im- pulse is felt as an unnamed urge - it is perhaps the instinct for freedom, though paradoxically it leads to bondage. If this pattern offers a general description of the behavior of mortals in Miss Murdoch's novels, it must be stressed that there are wide varia- tions, complications, and multiplication of effect: a character will shift his fascination from one person to another, or he may be the recipient of the gaze from a second character and the donor of it to a third ; fur- thermore, the reader is most often called upon to watch and care not for one protagonist in his shifting relationships but for a plurality of characters, and sometimes these are all introduced in a reception line in the opening pages. A mother figure may metamorphose into a lover or an enchanter, as in The Italian Girl, for example; or there may be reciprocal enchantment between two people. At any time it may be unclear as to who is enchanting and who is mothering whom. At the opening of Miss Murdoch's first novel, Under the Net, Jake Donaghue has two settings, and they both have the features of home: there is Madge's place where he has lived rent-free and there is Mrs. Tinckham's shop. As the novel opens he is evicted from the former and has nowhere to live - a problem that frequently perplexes Miss Mur- doch's characters; near the end of the novel, when Madge, now turned enchantress, offers him a sinecure in Paris he declines it. Madge, then, is first withdrawn from him as a source of maternal security; later she is declined by him as a mistress, her call for his gaze being rejected. Mrs. Tinckham's shop, on the other hand, whither Jake repairs after Madge has turned him out, is the background to which he returns at the end of the novel. We are given a full description of this sanctuary : it is a small news- paper shop where ice cream can be bought and eaten at an iron table; there are bottles of colored soft drinks and lots of cats. Presiding over the menage is Mrs. T., "like an earth-goddess surrounded by incense," whose single expression is "one of beaming and motherly solicitude," who can lend ten pounds "without a murmur." The mother figure is not without some of the characteristics of the sorceress: at one point Jake feels that she may be casting a spell to make him talk to her; at another she reminds him of Circe. A greater enchantment, however, is exerted by Anna Quentin. Char- acteristically, she is first introduced in terms of her place : that is, some-</page><page sequence="6">64O A. K. WEATHERHEAD one suggests to Jake, who is looking for a place to live, that he try Anna. She shares two important characteristics with other enchanters and enchantresses: the first is that she wants to receive love more than to give it. "Anna is one of those women," Jake explains, "who cannot bear to reject any offer of love." "She yearns for love as a poet yearns for an audience." The second characteristic Anna shares with her tribe is the kind of environment she is discovered in. When a character comes under the influence of the enchanter it is very often to the latter's lair, the back- ground, that our attention is drawn, as if here, in part at least, resided the power of enchantment. And in its description there are very often specific indications of its unreality. No one else in the novels, of course, has a room quite like Anna's; but there are generic likenesses. The room into which Jake bursts, unexpected and unannounced, is the green room of a theater: ... it was filled to overflowing with a sort of multicoloured chaos .... It was like a vast toyshop that had been hit by a bomb. In my first glance I noticed a French horn, a rocking horse, a set of red-striped tin trumpets, some Chinese silk robes, a couple of rifles, paisley shawls, teddy bears, glass balls, tangles of necklaces and other jewellery, a convex mirror, a stuffed snake, countless toy animals, and a number of tin trunks out of which multi- coloured costumes trailed. Exquisite and expensive playthings lay enlaced with the gimcrack contents of Christmas crackers.2 If the lairs of other enchanters are not thus furnished, they do share the quality of unreality, though it may be less obvious than it is here. Anna, we are forcibly informed, is living in an unreal world; or, rather, the character who engages in transactions with her is trafficking in unreality. She is found sitting amid the "enchanting chaos" like a "very wise mer- maid rising out of a motley-coloured sea." Very often the unreality of the world into which a character enters is detectable in its designation "golden." So Jake crowns Anna princess amid the gold dust : She lay amid the coloured debris like a fairy-tale princess tumbled from her throne. . . . She lay still for a moment, receiving my gaze, her foot arching with consciousness of it. "Where's your crown?" I asked. Anna searched under the pile and produced a gilded coronet. We laughed. I helped her up and we dusted bits of tinsel, gold dust, and loose spangles off her dress (p. 43) . The involvement of the spectator in this and other golden environ- 2 Iris Murdoch, Under the Net (New York, 1964) , pp. 37-38.</page><page sequence="7">Backgrounds with Figures in Iris Murdoch 641 ments should remind us, I believe, of the danger of one kind of improper response to art that Miss Murdoch discusses in her book on Sartre. For him, the goal of art is, in his words, "to recover this world by giving it to be seen as it is, but as if it had its source in human freedom." Art makes demands upon its reader: "The reader too," says Miss Murdoch, "must be the creator of the novel; his continuing to read it 'properly,' that is to enter into it seriously, to 'lend' it his emotions and so on, in- volves him in a sustained act of faith in the work itself." Then she says : The imagination must be enchanted, but, I think Sartre would agree, not too enchanted. An excessive detachment or suspicion will fail to create the work at all; an excessive self-forgetfulness will break down its objective con- tours and blend it with private fantasy and dream. In the latter case novel reading becomes a drug (p. 46) . It sometimes seems that Miss Murdoch's characters have entered en- vironments that endanger them by absorbing them into a dream world just as if they were making the excessively self-forgetful response to art. In at least one instance we are shown a work of art acting as an agency of enchantment and producing expressly just this otherworldly response : in An Unofficial Rose, Hugh Peronett's Tintoretto "lighted the room . . . like a small sun." It represented Susannah naked - "a plump, bent, delicious, golden form," with golden hair and a face of "radiant spiritual vagueness .... It was a picture which might well enslave a man, a picture round which crimes might be committed. . . . Fanny [Hugh's late wife] had wanted to sell it. Small Fanny had feared it perhaps: Hugh's golden dream of another world."3 Later, Hugh himself sells this dangerous glory, and his action is thought of by him as a crime and by his son, Randall, as violence. Behind the manifest causes of his act is the urge to be rid of the furniture in his background that induces a drugged, romantic detachment from reality. The act of violence is, again, generic in Miss Murdoch. A character may repudiate the spell of the enchanter by neglect of his person, the refusal to render the gaze, or by dereliction of what seems to the gazer himself his duty toward the enchanting background; quite often, how- ever, the background is repudiated symbolically by an overt act of vio- lence against it, though this appears accidental and may occur at some time before the actual desertion. The desecration of Hannah's golden world in The Unicorn is due, indirectly and rather mysteriously, to Effingham's failure to answer Hannah's appeal to him and to the same extent to Marian's similar dereliction of duty. In The Italian Girl, after 3 Iris Murdoch, An Unofficial Rose (London, 1962) , p. 98.</page><page sequence="8">642 A. K. WEATHERHEAD the fire and the catastrophe, the hero, we learn, repeats ten or twenty times, "If only I had not gone away." In The Flight from the Enchanter, on the other hand, in a memorable act of inadvertent violence against the enchanter's lair, Rosa smashes the marvelous fish aquarium in Mischa Fox's place by hurling one of those heavy paperweights with which the apartments in the novels are regularly furnished. In The Sandcastle Mor inadvertently injures the Riley, Rain Carter's motorcar, some time before he falls for her; but then the Riley is fixed up again and made to look better than new. The widespread use of such injuries may be glimpsed and some sense of the multiplicity of effects in the novels may be gained simply by listing all the different acts of violence and dereliction committed against enchanted settings and furniture in a single novel, An Unofficial Rose, not counting those inflicted against persons: Hugh Peronett sells the Tintoretto; Emma Sands's room is despoiled by Lindsay; Mildred knocks over Miranda's dolls with her umbrella; Miranda later destroys them and destroys also the photos of Felix, her enchanter, and the dagger that had come from him; Penn leaves Grayhallock without saying good-by; Felix drives the Mercedes on to the flower beds and then half across the lawn; Emma, on seeing the roses at Grayhallock, plans to write a murder story in a nursery and then admits, "All I can think of when I find something beautiful is how to make it an occasion for violent death." In Under the Net Jake fails to respond to Anna's appeal to him, and as an apparent consequence the theater and green room are dismantled : in the note he finds when it is too late, Anna says, "I'm sorry I couldn't wait any longer." His dereliction of the enchanted place, however, is due only to his friend's failure to pass on the note. More often in the novels, such acts proceed, even if blindly, from a character's volition. Nor with- out straining the facts may one say that Jake dismisses his enchantress when, in fact, his final separation from her is the result of his inability to catch her in the Tuileries, where she is running barefoot through the twilight. But his desertion of Hugo Belli ounder, who is also an enchanter to him, is deliberate, and so is his violation of Hugo's desk and safe toward the end of the novel. Jake returns finally to Mrs. Tinckham's shop, and there the enchant- ment of Anna's voice is distilled through the radio "and the splendour of the husky gold filled the shop, transforming the cats into leopards and Mrs. Tinckham into an aged Circe." Jake has Mrs. T. switch it off, because he "could bear no more"; he is hardly in control of the enchantment. Mrs. A. S. Byatt associates the radio song at the end of Under the Net with the song to which Roquentin (cf. Anna Quentin) listens at</page><page sequence="9">Backgrounds with Figui es in Iris Murdoch 643 the end of Sartre's La Nausée* an incident to which Miss Murdoch has devoted some attention in her book on Sartre. Roquentin believes that if he himself could create something like the song he is listening to - if, for instance, he could complete the book he has abandoned - he might give a form to his life. Miss Murdoch quotes the "obscure" phrases from the end of the novel in which Roquentin ruminates about his aspirations : "A moment would come when the book would be written, would be behind me, and I think that a little of its radiance would fall upon my past. Then perhaps through it I could remember my life without disgust. ... I should be able, in the past, only in the past, to accept myself."5 In the phrase "the radiance falling upon the past" Miss Murdoch under- stands Sartre to mean that "through the book he will be able to attain to a conception of his own life as having the purity, the clarity and the necessity which the work of art created by him will possess. . . . Yet," she adds, "this is a very thin and unsatisfactory conclusion." It is the conclusion, however, sought by Randall Peronett in An Un- official Rose. If in general the recurrent flights from one enchanter to another in the novels are motivated by an inarticulate instinct for free- dom, there is occasionally the express aim to find form in life by some such agency as Roquentin considers. We find this briefly mentioned as an alternative for which Pat Dumay considers himself ineligible, in The Red and the Green, when he takes other steps: "If he could have believed himself a poet, a creator of any kind, capable of lifting out of the muck and mess of life some self-contained perfect object, this would have seemed to him a goal worthy of his powers." Randall Peronett, on the other hand, does not consider himself ineligible for this kind of con- summation : he complains to his father that, through the fault of his wife Ann, his life has no form, and he attempts to fill this deficiency first by writing plays and secondly by falling in love with Lindsay Rimmer, who has what Ann lacks : With the passion of the artist which he now increasingly felt himself to be he adored Lindsay's awareness, her exquisite sense of form, which was a sort of dignity of wit, a sense as it were of the movement and timing of life which made her like a great comedian. She was shapely and complete; and like a kaleidoscope, like a complex rose, her polychrome being fell into an authoritative pattern which proclaimed her free (p. 75) . The two strategies he adopts to give his life form, the writing of plays 4 A. S. Byatt, Degrees of Freedom: The Novels of Iris Murdoch (New York, 1965), pp. 25-26. 5 Murdoch, Sartre, p. 15.</page><page sequence="10">644 A- K. WEATHERHEAD and the pursuit of Lindsay, are clearly different in kind : in the former he is apparently trying to implement the idea of Roquentin : to bestow, by creation of form in art, a sense of form on his own life; in the latter he seems to be relying on sympathetic magic, hoping that although he is not the creator but only the possessor of Lindsay, something of her radiance will rub off on him. The last sentence of the quotation above suggests that he sees her as a work of art; and the passage that follows shows him reacting to her with the dangerous irresponsibility that Miss Murdoch feels art may evoke in its spectators: "With exhilaration Randall felt himself become light, light, able to rise at last into the airy world of the imagination, the world above the mess of morality, the world inhabited by those two angelic beings." These two are Lindsay and Emma Sands, former mistress of Hugh, who now employs Lindsay as a companion. At first they are both enchantresses for Randall; then Emma is repudiated. The room they sit in is, true to form, filled with golden sunlight and a mist of tobacco smoke; on Randall's first visit the women have their backs to the light and are endowed with golden halos. Into this orbit of enchantment Randall willingly allows himself to be drawn, hoping to find form for his life. Then he goes off with Lindsay to Rome and visits the ancient monu- ments without benefit of Baedeker. After a while, however, it is Ann, the deserted wife, who comes to occupy his nightly dreams: Lindsay, who had been for him the embodiment of a romantic dream and to be alone with whom he had anticipated as being the very peak and essence of freedom, fades a little, as she is realized, into the light of common day. Randall now begins to feel "curious stirrings of another freedom" : and the future he looks to now includes a vision of Ann; "Ann would always be waiting." Randall will undoubtedly return to Grayhallock, the wheel having come full circle. And indeed it was folly ever to leave it, for it was that environment that had supplied him with his best opportunity for crea- tion : the cultivation of roses was "the only one thing in the world that he was really good at" ; and Ann was an integral part of that environ- ment and habitually got up early to help in the nursery, as Lindsay never would. He loved nothing as he loved roses; not only were they the most beautiful things conceivable, they were moreover perfect forms: every year they appeared "as they must have looked in the Garden of Eden when in a felicitous moment God said : let there be roses." Randall will return, we surmise, from the enchantment of Lindsay to the en- chantment of the roses back at Grayhallock. In his mind the figure of Ann has receded to become only an element in what is now a genial background. What he doesn't know is that his mother's cat, which</page><page sequence="11">Backgrounds with Figures in Iris Murdoch 645 had disappeared at the time of her death, has returned to Grayhallock; and thus the influence of his mother from which her death had liberated him will be there, thus embodied, to trouble his serenity. It is doubtful whether Randall's fluctuations spell progress or that he has learned from them as if they constituted a Lehrjahre; it is even doubtful whether they are at an end, if we may presume, in an imma- terial fiction, to glance at a non materialized future. At the end of an Iris Murdoch novel we do not get the sense that the characters we have come to care about have now finished with romantic enchantments and are ready to settle down to the diurnal realities of life. Her novels differ in this respect from those of Henry Green. He, too, is concerned with the dreams and enchantments that beset human beings; he, too, deals with the possession of one character by another and with selfish sexuality in which a character takes without giving; and he, like her, has a num- ber of enchanting moments in golden backgrounds. But Green, in the early novels at least, provides a resolution in which the golden lads and lasses manage their enchantments by integrating them in whatever way they can with the dusty realities of the pragmatic world. In Living, for example, Lily Gates, who had dreamed of a man of her own and chil- dren to cherish in some romantic faraway place, goes so far in realizing her dream as to leave town with a young man ; but then after a short and frightening excursion she returns home. At the end of the novel, how- ever, grasping what she can of her dream in the terms necessity will per- mit, she wheels the neighbor's baby in the buggy; and to her, having learned the stoic's prayer, "Make us not fly to dreams but moderate de- sire," the "sight of baby blowing bubbles on her mouth . . . was moment of utter bliss." Iris Murdoch's people don't seem to finish up with this kind of fe- licitous working compromise : rather, they go from one enchantment to another in restless pursuit. Not that they are victims of overpowering romantic hauntings : the women who call for their gaze, for example, are not voluptuous femmes fatales; their beauty is always a little fly- blown or even withered by age, though they may take off their shoes to romp and frolic. Enchantment is not without willfulness; the gazer wants to be ensnared. At the end of The Unofficial Rose, the supplica- tion Hugh Peronett offers up is nothing like the stoic's prayer mentioned above. He says "O spare me a little that I may recover my strength " And we know that he wants to be spared so that he may be enchanted yet again, like Yeats, "to live it all again ... the folly that man does." It is at the end of The Red and the Green, however, which is centered around the historical events of the Easter Rising in Dublin in 1916, that we receive the strongest sense that in this world men and women cannot</page><page sequence="12">646 A. K. WEATHERHEAD make concluding peace with enchantment but will always hanker after and endure in one form or another its visitation. Here in an epilogue set in a time twenty years after the main events of the novel, we find that Frances, having previously been in love with the fanatical Irish patriot Pat Dumay who had been killed at the Post Office, is now living in Lon- don, married to a city man who refers to the Rising as "pure bloody minded romanticism." But her situation is not insulated from enchant- ment, and it contains as well as her husband an element to remind us and her of Pat: like him, her tall son is now ready to fight for freedom - this time in Spain against Franco; and the old memories of Easter 1916 come welling up to haunt her. Of Pearse, Connolly, MacDonagh, and the rest, the "terrible beauty" had been born; and thinking of these and of Pat, Frances gets up and goes to the window to hide tears. We must attend, however, to the uses of background in this novel, which in their own way still play important roles. First, Ireland the place is the enchanting extension of Cathleen ni Houlihan. For some charac- ters it provides a maternal background that casts a spell over prodigals and has them return. Such is the role it assumes for Hilda Chase- White and her brother Barney, who have both lived in England and have been lured back by "some imperative need" or "an atavistic urge to return" to Irish soil. For Andrew Chase- White, who had grown up in London, Ireland, like earlier backgrounds we have seen, is a place not entirely real; and he looks forward to cutting ties and liberating himself from it after he is married. Ireland to him is just an old maternal woman. For other characters, however, Ireland is the young Cathleen ni Houlihan, who exerts the strong enchantment and demands their unilateral love. " 'Did you see an old woman going down the path?5 'I did not, but I saw a young girl, and she had the walk of a queen.' " This is quoted by Frances Bellman for amusement, though she is not invulnerable to such sentiments herself; and her father, Christopher, laughs at the image of the "tragic woman." But all the rational things he says about Ireland are probably only his mechanism of escaping her enchantment. And the escape is only temporary; for at the end, gallant and sentimental, playing his small part in the cause of Irish freedom, he, too, is killed at the Post Office. Christopher is much less involved in that heroic misadventure, how- ever, than the fanatical Pat Dumay. Pat is an ascetic, and his involve- ment in the Irish cause is the result of a special twist given to the motif we have seen repeated throughout the novels in which men and women commit violence against the background that enchants them. With Pat, that enchanting background is his own body, which he thinks of as a soft and vulnerable extension of the self. We become aware that it is a</page><page sequence="13">Backgrounds with Figures in Iris Murdoch 647 danger to him as a thing, exerting a spell and demanding love, when Cathal, his younger brother, insists on attending Pat's bathing "ritual," as it is called, as an "acolyte." Cathal, who later appropriates Pat's rifle for reasons not entirely disinfected of symbolism, was growing up: "Pat perceived this growing up as something very purely, sharply painful, like the touch of a clean knife or a flame"; and the use of D. H. Law- rence's imagery need not surprise us when we are seeing from the view- point of somebody who, albeit reluctantly, admires male flesh. But it is his consciousness of his own flesh that we must attend to in Pat; for the violence that he is to commit for the Irish cause is a violence against the enchantment of his own body : what appeals to him in that cause is the rigorous disciplining of the body it demands. If he had been a poet, he might, we are told, have created the perfect object and discovered form (as Randall Peronett sought to do) ; but as it is, his concept of a "per- fect life" is that in which the body offers no resistance to the commands of the mind: "He despised the ordinary imperfect mechanics of the human personality, wherein the command of the pure Mentor was never obeyed until the impure mass of tissue, the gross living Self, was ready to obey it with ease." He apparently espouses the cause not only of Ire- land's Republic but Plato's. It is a quest for Platonic purity that leads him to punish his body, doing violence to that which contains the ele- ments of allurement, as other characters in Miss Murdoch's world have been doing in various ways these last fifteen years. The cause works upon him in this distorted way. Then when it fails him, the rising having been called off, he makes his way toward the bed of Aunt Millie, who, after Ireland, is the strong enchanter in this novel. We see her first with mud on the hem of her dress, suggesting that she is an earth goddess like Mrs. Tinckham in Under the Net. Again, she is like Anna Quentin, and indeed like Cathleen ni Houlihan, in that she is "simply incapable of refusing a devotion." She has some power over Pat Dumay through his masochism : because she is physically revolting to him, he comes to her to punish his body. Christopher is more conven- tionally in love with her; Andrew is seduced by her; and Barney Drumm, in his devotion to her, is "sunk and drowned like a fly in trea- cle." The night that Pat goes to visit Millie at Rathblane, these other three also turn up. For all four of them she is the alternative attraction : we know at the time that Andrew in Frances and Barney in the church have both had previous romantic allegiances, and we know with hind- sight that Millie had supplanted Ireland in Christopher's gaze. Then, while Pat, Andrew, and Barney simply desert her, Christopher commits a familiar kind of violence against her enchanting background, stum- bling about in a dark drawing room and breaking her Ming vase.</page><page sequence="14">648 A. K. WEATHERHEAD There is then some consistency in the treatment of backgrounds throughout the novels, which in no way impairs their multifariousness: men and women become spellbound in a particular environment, which, as an extension of an enchanter's personality, may be conceived of as a country, as a room, as the physical frame that is the setting of the will, or as furniture and possessions. They commit violence against it, often in- advertently but with symbolic purpose, and move on to court and en- dure the enchantment of another complex of person and place. And all this, one may say provisionally halfway through her career, is part of the way in which Iris Murdoch looks at human nature. University of Oregon Eugene</page></plain_text>
