Edited by Tom Kindt and Hans-Harald Miiller (Narratologia 1.) Berlin, New York: de Gruyter 2003. x + 368 pages. f98,00. Elemente der Narratologie. Von Wolf Schmid. (Narratologia 8.) Berlin, New York: de Gruyter 2005. 320 Seiten. E98,00. What is Narratology? is of interest not just based on the rich material it offers the reader. It is also the inaugural volume of the de Gruyter series Narratologia: Con- tributions to Narrative Theory/Beitriige zur Erzdihltheorie, for which Fotis Jannidis, John Pier, and Wolf Schmid (all three also represented in this volume) serve as series editors. So far, 11 volumes have appeared; volume 8 is discussed below. The series is a significant contribution to the flourishing scholarship in the area of narrative studies. As one would expect with de Gruyter, the volumes are handsome, the paper quality, typeface, and layout pleasant and reader-friendly, even though with the first volume, the editorial and production process seems to have included minor snags. In order to not only represent, but also foster international exchange, contribu- tions not originally in English have been translated. The aim of this volume is not just to assemble useful contributions to the field, but to ask guiding questions and to sketch possible roadmaps for the future of the discipline-a challenge that the majority of the authors take up. The individual inter- ventions are directed at widely divergent aspects, areas, and indeed conceptual levels of the overall narratological project. A brief preface by the editors offers a thumbnail sketch of a yet-to-be-written history of narratology in three phases and outlines the rationale for the volume (it goes back to the first international symposium of the Narratology Research Group in Ham- burg, founded in 2001, whose members have actively and productively contributed to the field of narratology since) and its topic posed in question form. As they phrase it: "The problem lies not in a lack of plausible answers to the question, but precisely in the abundance of such answers" (v). 14 contributions by individual or co-authors-about half of them members of the Hamburg group at the time of the symposium-follow, varying in length between 16 and 38 pages and arranged in no discernible order or system. On the whole, they invite, and would merit, extensive engagement rather than the following capsule assessments. Contributions range from the specific to the general. Both general and brief, the opening "Survey" of narratology by Gerald Prince offers a highly compressed over- view. Prince's role in the field is affirmed by the frequency with which his name occurs in the volume, and his contribution is evidence of comprehensive familiarity with the research-stopping short in most cases, however, of actual engagement with the mate- rial in favor of offering repeated lists and catalogues of positions, questions, and an- swers. It is followed by Wolf Schmid's foray into "eventfulness" or Ereignishaftigkeit, with its very specific focus on this feature of a narratological approach that focuses on what is being narrated rather than the form of its mediation. Schmidt elucidates the category of "event" and then proceeds to define five parameters of "eventfulness" (a more awkward term than either the German or the Russian, as he concedes [30]), with examples drawn mainly from Chekhov. (Not surprisingly, Schmid's contribution, sans</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 131 the brief concluding section, has also found its way into his monograph, published two years later and reviewed below.) John Pier's patient and detailed engagement with the problems that have plagued attempts to equate or correlate the concepts of "story" and "discourse" with the con- ceptual pair of "fabula" and "sjushet" takes readers through three phases of use (pre- structuralist, structuralist, semiotic) in an illuminating acknowledgment of the ter- minological foundations of narrative studies and the processes of semantic shift and accretion that have taken place. He points out that "to reject them, whatever the dif- ficulties brought about by their use, would be [... ] pointless" and instead insists on the importance of identifying "the ways they are appropriated by and operate within various narrative theories" (93). In another contribution to untangling terminological history, a densely informative survey of the connections (and their historical interrela- tion) among narrative theory, narratology, and theory of the novel, Anja Cornils and Wilhelm Schernus face the daunting task of finding adequate translations for numerous key terms of the original German texts-synthesized in two curiously bi-lingual tables (159, 163) that document either a less-than-final phase of editing or resignation in the face of the different terminological systems. Fotis Jannidis offers an enlightening, if slightly uneven exploration of the re- lationship of narrative and narration. He draws on prototype theory to present oral narration as the central type within a more flexibly defined continuum, questions the usefulness of narratology as a "metascience" (41, 50) operating on an abstract no- tion of narrative, and insists on the relevance of the actual medium of transmission, the "inseparability of medium and representation" (41). His innovative examples in- clude virtual cinematic time ("bullet time") and the "borderline phenomena" (47) of MMORPGs (massive multiuser online role-playing games). Jens Eder relates narratol- ogy to a specific disciplinary paradigm, that of "Cognitive Reception Theories" in a thoughtful contribution that offers a highly informative overview of the "many differ- ent kinds of cognitive theory available for narratologists to exploit" (283) and can be recommended to all readers looking for an introduction to this field. Jan Christoph Meister's presentation of "Narratology as Discipline" is one of several overarching attempts to define and situate narratology, in his case heavily in- flected towards Wissenschaftsgeschichte. (The visual appearance of Meister's illustra- tions suggest that that they may have been imported directly from a powerpoint file.) Michael Titzmann's similarly broad, but much more detailed and ambitious contribu- tion, "The Systematic Place of Narratology in Literary Theory and Textual Theory," likewise outlines a disciplinary program. Deploring the shifting scope and discrepan- cies in the coverage of media and genres, he employs formal logic to present a narratol- ogy that imposes order by serving as a scientific meta-theory, freed from the shackles of specificity (for Titzmann, such categories as literariness or fictionality are "utterly irrelevant," 179). While he advocates a theory that is free from normative elements and "subjective speculation" (177), he does not shy away from the occasional normative statement himself, for instance when he asserts that "[structuralist approaches] should really have been taken further and improved if necessary" (187). Within his insistence that narratology is part of a poetics reclassified as "textual theory," one may be sur- prised to find narrators recast as "speakers" (193, passim), and the diegetic world/level of actual narration as "spoken situation"/"speech situation" (194). Clearly averse to anthropomorphic assumptions, he instead imputes agency and (lack of) awareness,</page><page sequence="3">132 Monatshefte, Vol. 100, No. 1, 2008 even potential insight to the theories themselves (200-201): "When they misunder- stood themselves as genre theories, it was inevitable that they failed to see their real breadth as textual theories" (201). Titzmann's contribution shows that universal ap- plicability and the purging of specificity comes with losses that may ultimately make practitioners less than eager to take up his systematic conception. In addressing the question of "Narratology or Narratologies?," the prolific Ans- gar Niinning provides a welcome update of his much-cited "Survey" of narratology, initially presented at the 1999 Anglistentag in Mainz and hidden away in the proceed- ings volume. While the recycling of published material is not generally a virtue, his contribution is optimally placed in this opening volume of the series. With the author's tolerance towards divergent practices and overlapping terminological territory, his en- gaging and occasionally humorous style, and his chart of an axis from "undertheo- rization" to "overtheorization" of approaches (256), his text is in distinct contrast to Titzmann's methodological and terminological rigor and insistence on abstraction. His "taking stock" includes 40+ [!] different approaches grouped and sub-grouped in eight categories (249-251), a smorgasbord that engenders gratitude for the map he provides of "relations between narrative studies, narrative theory, narratology, and narratologi- cal criticism" (261). Literary scholars may wonder at this point why they should take an interest in a volume that seems to concentrate on theoretical and disciplinary issues. But several contributions redress that balance. Andreas Kablitz, for one, offers a focus welcome to the literature-inclined by relying heavily on literary texts (by Flaubert, Stendhal, and Balzac). His representation of a "poetics of observation" that underlies classical realism is beautifully detailed and much more persuasive as an instance of narrative analysis-cum-interpretation than his attempts to turn it into a general contribution to narratology: not least because he wavers between "narrative perspective" (which he repeatedly calls a "technique") and "focalization," and the terminology seems some- what shakily applied throughout, including the startling attribution of an effet de reel to Jurij Lotman (100, no bibliographical reference provided). Kablitz's triple ambition of serving literary analysis/interpretation, literary history, and narrative studies overloads his contribution. On a less text-oriented level, Kindt and Miiller, wearing their hats as contributors, tackle the issue of interpretation and sketch positions of compatibility between narratology/narrative theory and theories of interpretation. Among others, Schmidt as well touches on the vexed question of how much interpretation a suppos- edly analytical narratology can accommodate (30). Perhaps surprisingly, David Herman's contribution to "Regrounding Narratol- ogy: The Study of Narratively Organized Systems for Thinking" offers some of the pleasures of literary analysis along with-and in the service of-a comprehensively general attempt at situating the discipline. His text mines the modes of focalization and knowledge-sharing in Edith Wharton's story "Roman Fever," thus in practice up- grading the text through his apt and detailed observations, while in theory relegating it to providing an illustration of what he calls "distributed focalization." His focus is ultimately the question of "what makes stories integral to intelligent behavior" and the "way narratives participate in larger, socially embedded systems for thinking, which can enable problem-solving activities in particularized settings" (328). Matias Mar- tinez and Michael Scheffel, in turn, insist on the uniqueness of fictional discourse and the necessity of distinguishing between fictional and nonfictional texts in analysis. In</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews 133 this, they are diametrically opposed to scholars who argue in favor of ignoring not only this distinction, but indeed removing any media specificity from theories of narrative, such as Titzmann. The volume concludes in media-awareness mode, with an original and illus- trated foray into "visual cartography" by Marie-Laure Ryan, who proposes "that we expand the widely accepted definition of narrative as the expression of the temporal nature of human experience into a type of meaning that involves the four dimensions of a space-time continuum" (335). Her classification and examples of maps in and about texts include textual-world maps, plot maps, and texts-as-maps, with examples ranging from Tristram Shandy and classical fables to hypertexts. Ryan's text is followed by a name index for the volume, a welcome and useful orienting tool for readers. Given the general care lavished on the volume, the erratic quality of the images and several strange page breaks that in some cases leave pages half empty or repeat parts of sentences (61/2, 69/70, 158/9, 165/6, 323/4, 347/8) seem incongruous. Moreover, one could have wished for more careful copyediting. While the number of printing errors is tolerable, there are numerous syntactical and lexical oddities-which in some cases hamper comprehension or turn the intended statement on its head ("without hastening to add" 251)-and errors that are in some cases either caused or compounded by the quality of the English translations; for instance note page 65 "preceeding"; 69 "excuse"; 112 "uninterested contentment"; note page 131 "binding"; 133 "premises"; 200 "decisions [ ... ] none of which is specific"; 223 "re- jects to"; 225 "forbid to"; 223, 224 "provableness." Similarly, "mutas mutandis" (187) and "bate noir" (120) escaped timely detection. Contributions to the volume inevitably display some overlap, as various authors provide their own recapitulation or sketch of the state of narratology and foundational terms, among repeated invocations of Todorov as the founding-or at least naming- father of the discipline. But they also give a sense of a spirited ongoing dialogue among the participants-in that sense, they are not dryly academic. The volume provides a noteworthy cross-section of current work in narratology as well as a selection of ques- tions worth pursuing. Texts cover the range from 'broad' to 'narrow' definitions of nar- ratology and their fit within or alongside other disciplines and approaches-semiotics, textual studies, literary as well as cultural studies. Taken together, the contributions raise additional issues besides the thorny question of interpretation vs. analysis and theory, the role of media specificity, or the place of fictionality. Among them: the relationship of the cognitive to the aesthetic in texts as well as in human comprehen- sion and response, and the role of the humanities. Titzmann would prefer to do away completely with the term "Geisteswissenschaften" [174]; and there is a discernible ideological bias when authors choose to translate "Wissenschaft" as "science," ignor- ing what may be the more appropriate term "scholarship." The title of Schmid's monograph is both accurate and overly modest. The volume indeed discusses all elements relevant in narrative theory and analysis. Five chap- ters present, in turn, "Merkmale des Erzahlens im fiktionalen Werk" (focusing on Narrativitiit, Ereignishaftigkeit, and Fiktionalitit); "Die Instanzen des Erzhihlwerks" (instantiations of author, reader, and narrator); "Die Erzihlperspektive;" "Erzihlertext und Personentext;" and "Die narrativen Transformationen: Geschehen-Geschichte Erzihlung-Text der Erzihlung." A brief conclusion doubles as summary overview</page><page sequence="5">134 Monatshefte, Vol. 100, No. 1, 2008 and recap of important concepts. The bibliography assembles works in an impressive array of Slavic and Western languages ranging from classical antiquity and the medi- eval period to contemporary research. Schmid's ability to draw on original sources in numerous languages is one of the features that distinguishes this volume, which originally appeared in Russian in 2003 and reflects the author's decades-long engagement in narratological research. Not written as an introduction, it is clear and readable almost without fail, if at an advanced level; while it makes profitable reading for anyone actively engaged in nar- ratological endeavors and in dialogue with other relevant works and authors (just as Schmid himself conducts and contributes to this kind of dialogue in the book), it would familiarize an uninitiated reader thoroughly with the field and introduce her to many of the terminological quandaries, developments, disagreements, and discussions that have shaped it. Schmid surveys and summarizes a large body of research and engages with it, displaying commendable fairness without shying away from explaining where he differs with others and proposing alternative models. Occasionally, his text is overly fremdwortlastig, be it via translation from Slavic or English. His frequent introduc- tion of alternative terms-new or less familiar within the dominant Western research, and frequently drawn from Slavic scholarship-is not an unqualified advantage given the already-proliferating terminology in the field: do we really need an "abstract" author rather than the familiar "implied" one? (49ff.) But his scrutiny of terms for their usefulness is welcome, and his reasoning in most cases makes good sense, even though his terminology at times both intersects and overlaps with existing models and the nearly-canonical categories that by now order and subdivide the field of narrative studies. His attempts to rehabilitate Perspektive and subordinate "focalization" to it may strike readers as unorthodox, but his 5-parameter model of perspective (encom- passing space, ideology, time, language, and perception) is both plausible and usable. In specific instances his terms serve to clarify areas of enduring difficulty or confusion and one would hope to see them adopted (such as his attempt to improve on Genette's classification of narrators as well as address the "traditionelle, aber problematische Dichotomie Ich-Erziihler vs. Er-Erzihler," 87). His "typology of narrators" (with a diagram on page 83) is flexible and useful. Particularly welcome is the detailed section on "skaz," the specific use of orality in literary texts that plays an important role in Russian literature-a concept with considerable potential that is frequently omitted or given short shrift in Western narratological scholarship (it is not discussed in the two leading German-language introductions to narrative theory by Fludernik [2006] and Martinez/Scheffel ['1999]). In addition, and beyond the scope of the volume title, Schmid provides a very serviceable history of narratology. Throughout, he believes in going to the sources- be it Aristotle, Hamburger, or the rich Slavic tradition of scholarship in narrative stud- ies. In combination with his extensive knowledge of both primary and secondary texts, this allows him to set right a number of misconceptions and errors, some of which have been staples uncritically perpetuated and transmitted in narratological research for many years. Not infrequently, such corrections are based on his expertise in Slavic languages and literatures. To name just one example: Schmid points out that inte- rior monologue originated neither in Dujardin (as is frequently stated) nor in Tolstoi (as pointed out by Gleb Struve in 1954): instead, he cites an earlier occurrence in</page><page sequence="6">Book Reviews 135 Dostoevskij (193-194). In numerous instances, Schmid can point to the origins of concepts and terms in Slavic research that have been ignored or under-represented in research oriented largely toward German, French, or Anglo-American scholarship. Thus, he not only outlines a history of narratology and its terminology, but also re- writes it where necessary. Only occasionally does his engagement with terms or traces of origin become overly detailed or difficult to follow. Schmid states without reservation that for him, literary texts are the core area of narrative studies, asserting "dass die genuin narratologische Theoriebildung im Wesentlichen immer noch im Rahmen der Literaturwissenschaft geschieht" (273). He provides numerous examples from literary texts to demonstrate the application-and applicability-of terms and approaches; many of them, once again, are drawn from Russian literature. The reader less familiar with these texts may consider this either a drawback or an added advantage. In an acknowledgment of standard German/Western linguistic proficiency, Slavic texts are presented in translation, whereas English and French sources are cited in the original. The volume is reader-friendly in other ways as well: the detailed table of contents allows quick orientation, which is further facilitated by the Conclusion mentioned above. Schmid also provides both a helpful glossary/in- dex of terms and an index of names and works, all of which allow the reader to use his monograph as a reference work. Numerous tables and diagrams serve to illustrate patterns, relationships, and terminological domains-as a rule, they are useful and informative. Underlying the terminological distinctions and refinements of analysis proposed, there is a welcome attitude of common sense: Schmid's intention is clearly not to engage in the competition for the highest degree of differentiation (82), and he objects to attempts at radically depersonalizing our idea of a narrator, noting that read- ers inevitably supply narrators "mit bestimmten anthropomorphen Ztigen" (74). To sum up: Schmid's volume is a fine addition to the extensive corpus of narra- tological research. It is comprehensive, thorough, and detailed; it combines systematic presentation and historical overview; it offers a compilation and synthesis of existing research and a scholarly intervention by a seasoned and encyclopedically read par- ticipant; it is well-written and offers numerous reader-friendly features; and it will be particularly welcome to literary scholars because of its emphasis on literary analysis and the detailed examples provided throughout.
