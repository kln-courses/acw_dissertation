A few years earlier, street peddling had begun to radically increase, and local merchants were joined by a huge influx of West African traders. Some reported that the number of sidewalk vendors grew from about one hundred to nearly one thousand within a short period, about half comprising African immigrants (Marriott 1994, Hicks 1994a). And while West African immigration to the US had been characterized by a predominately Christian and Anglophone population, this new wave is mostly French-speaking and Mus- lim (Abdullah 2010). An open-air street bazaar resulted from the dramatic display of African artifacts, decorative necklaces and trinkets, leather handbags, musical instruments, variegated tex- tiles, exotic and urban clothing designs, and an array of Ameri- can goods. Haggling voices with a tinge of black, West African, and Caribbean accents blend together easily. The ethnic atmo- sphere also brought two-tiered buses carrying European and Japanese tourists to witness Harlem's "authentic" black culture. The increased street activity, however, eventually created a major problem for storeowners, who felt their businesses were being hampered by the added competition, and a battle ensued. Shopkeepers argued that the peddlers crowded the streets, undercut sales with counterfeit merchandise, and littered the side- walk with debris (Hicks 1994b). African merchants asserted that selling "African things" on 125th Street revitalized the area, and that African art pieces allow blacks to reclaim their ancestral heritage (Stoller 1996:780). Amid great controversy, the debate ended when prominent storeowners forced elected officials to finally enact no-vending laws, expelling peddlers from the main thoroughfare in October of 1994 (Hicks 1994b). More than a hundred African vendors opted to move to the newly established Malcolm Shabazz Harlem Market (named for Malcolm X "Shabazz") on West 116th Street (Bloom 1995). Operating under the auspices of Masjid Mal- colm Shabazz, an African American neighborhood mosque, the Harlem Market houses more than one hundred small booths for some $56 per week (Siegal 1999). Some stall renters are African Americans, but the majority is from Senegal, Côte d'Ivoire, and Mali, selling traditional goods and some urban wear. Located near Malcolm X Boulevard (Lenox Avenue), its circus-like canopy and minarets open on 116th Street, with a rear entrance on 115th Street (Figs. 1-2). As patrons enter the market, Muhammad's World of Afri- can Art beckons them.1 Just outside the shop, hand-carved wooden objects, djembe drums, and other Africana are spread across tables, hung on display boards, or pinned against the wall (Figs. 3-4). It is a spectatorial space, a realm where the display of multicolored designs and curvaceous sculptures engenders a new kind of spectatorship. Here, visitors enter a "third space," in the language of Homi Bhabha (1994) and the 1960s Third Cinema movement (Guneratne and Dissanayake 2003). These kinds of places make the old boundaries marking African iden- tities mutable, fluid, and negotiable. In other words, the buying and selling of African art at the Harlem Market creates a space where identities, particularly as they relate to the meaning of Africa itself, are made and remade. This article, then, explores how patrons of African art, often with the help of the merchants, purchase these objects as a resource for the construction of their identities in places like the Harlem Market.

PHOTO: ZAIN ABDULLAH Others have written about the various ways African art objects, or what Afri- can merchants call "wood," circulate as a result of global forces, advanced capital- ism, and international tourism (Stoller 2003, Steiner 1994, Phillips and Steiner 1999). This article explores the local con- text of these artworks, the people who buy and sell them at the marketplace, and how ideas about Africa are implicated in the meanings they create about them- selves and others. Even so, the objects themselvès clearly mean many things to different people. As an ethnographic project, this work focuses on Anta, a Wolof merchant from Senegal, who man- ages Muhammad s World of African Art. The interactions between the art objects, the patrons, and African vendors reflect complex ways people see themselves and Africa through the context of display and value, diasporic imaginings, and a materi- alizing of the past. DISPLAY AND VALUE Anta and other African merchants claim that their products are not organized in any particular order. At first sight, their stalls appear cluttered and uninviting (Figs. 5-6). Sara, an Afri- can American law student and frequent visitor, would often complain: "They need to arrange it where you can find things," she would say. Nonetheless, African art merchants are relentless in their attempt to lure customers into their small eight-by-ten- foot stalls. "Come, come!" Anta beckons shoppers with a rigor- ous hand gesture. "Come inside and look. There is much more inside." Besides the djembe drums, hand-carved utensils, leather neck pouches, and other trinkets to attract shoppers strolling through the Market, the real prizes (generally higher priced) are inside (Figs. 7-8, cover). Once they enter the booth, however, patrons are forced to wade through a massive clutter of art objects. While this arrangement may seem disconcerting to some, it provides others with a feel- ing of good fortune when the right item is found. "The context in which an object is placed, and the circumstances surrounding its putative 'discovery,'" Christopher B. Steiner writes, "weigh heav- ily in the buyer s assessment of quality, value, and authenticity" (1994:131-32). This notion of discovery, especially as it pertains to the purchasing of African art, is intimately linked to an unend- ing image of Africa as a place shrouded in mystery and hidden treasures (Mengara 2001). Many customers at the Harlem Mar- io J airican arts winter 2011</page><page sequence="4">5-6 Views from inside (right) and out- side (below) of informal display. ket explained their desire to acquire African art because it was "mysterious," which reflects how they viewed the continent as a whole. They claimed that the African artworks would help to reveal the continents veiled "truth." Moreover, some patrons feel that the merchants simply do not know how to arrange their art- works in proper order, and that this explains the reason their shops appear unorganized. This belief might even suggest that the consumer is the one who knows the true value of the African objects. But this would be a mistake. "Although I do ask some of [the dealers] about the meaning of the art, they really don't know what it means," James explained. His sentiment was echoed by others. An African American man in his late twenties, James was born in Harlem but now resides in Canada with his family. They return to New York periodically to visit, but he never misses an opportunity to sift through the artifacts at the Market, hoping to discover another piece for his collection. While patrons might inquire about the meaning or history of various African objects, they also feel African merchants really do not know what they are selling. At the same time, African ven- dors realize that feigning ignorance leads customers to believe that the purchase was made not between them and the dealer, but between them and the artist. James's acquisition was intensified because he believed that he "discovered" some- thing the merchant didn't know he had and, thus, his piece had gone unclaimed. For example, in the world of art collect- ing, to have intimate knowledge of an object means one has already laid claim to it. The African dealers realize this (see Steiner 1994:133). Because the African art objects are kept in disarray and "unclaimed," the buyer is allowed to experience an "accident" of discovery (Rheims 1961:212). But why does this display matter, and how does it relate to the way people construct their identities at the Harlem Market? While the informal nature of the display affords one a certain kind of serendipity, the value of each art piece is recognized for the way it brings its owner in contact with the world. In other words, the art objects at the Harlem Market do not merely serve as met- onyms, material things that stand for something else. Their value hinges on their ability to become sites where new meanings are forged and identities can be validated or reshaped (see Graburn and Glass 2004:109-110). The determination of value, however, is not the sole province of purchasers. Similar to what occurs in auc- tion houses, art transactions at the marketplace reflect a "social winter 2011 alrlcan arts 11</page><page sequence="5">7-8 Higher-priced art inside booth shop (left) and art shop (below). process [that] explicitly entails the reproduction of new collective definitions of value" (Smith 1989:4). This constitutes a different "regime of value," as Fred Myers would have it (2004:209), because it doesn't limit the significance of the art objects to specific ideas about attribution, authenticity, or aesthetics. Sherry Turkle writes that both people and things are objects, each imbued with its own unique histories (2007a:9, 2007^311). This fact makes the things we bring into our lives "evocative," whether for applied or aesthetic reasons, because our connection to them transforms us. "They shape us in particular ways...," Turkle argues: Blue Cheer [an antidepressant medication] "pro- duces a patient, just as Hlubinka's datebook produces a time- keeper and time-manager" (2007^311). In a similar way, patrons value the art objects at the marketplace for the kind of person they become as a result of their engage- ment with them. On another occasion, Lian, a Chinese doctoral student, came to the Harlem Market to buy an African garment with "vibrant colors," a trait she felt signified African culture. When we inspected her purchase, we discovered that although it resembled an African textile, the tag indi- cated that it was made in Indonesia. Lian asked me if she should return the item, since she had only come to the Harlem Market for "something African." But what constitutes "something African" certainly speaks to how patrons imagine Africa and the objects that have come to symbolize an entire continent. This episode illus- trates that the location where African art and handicrafts are purchased is equally important. In this sense, Harlem itself, as a site of black cultural production, serves as a larger backdrop from which the Afri- can art shops are legitimized and authen- ticated.2 Despite the fact that, through globalization, products purportedly made in a single country are often assembled else- where, the location of the marketplace and the way it symbolizes African heritage provides an important social context for Afri- can artworks and how shoppers relate to them. As for James, he bought a hand-carved mahogany chair with a village scene he believed connected him to his African past. He also described his purchase as "personal," because he truly admired the design but realized others may not. He claimed that his basement was filled with African art, and that he also has a wall of masks. Altogether, objects like those in James's African art collection become, as Turkle describes, companions of thought and emotion (2007a:5, 9). They help to configure his imagin- ings of the continent, and they deepen his passionate desire to 12 airican arts winter 201 1</page><page sequence="6">feel like one of Africas sons. Lian was also looking for a way to connect to Africa, but for different reasons. Her purchase signi- fied her desire for communion, a way to affirm the values she believed Africans and Chinese share, she later admitted, like a respect for tradition and a similar sense of taste. Either way, their association with African objects help to underscore their great- est value and mediate their sense of themselves. For others, the process of identity formation involves a shifting of the boundar- ies, as patrons look to alter the meaning of their artworks to fit a diasporic need. DIASPORIC IMAGININGS Some merchants strive to appear "African" by intentionally wearing traditional clothing at the Market (see Steiner 1994:90, Rasmussen 2003:18-19). Instead, Anta typically moves about in his mid-thigh dashiki combined with jeans or other West- ern garments. He relies much more on the stories he tells to authenticate his artwork and validate his role as a genuine art dealer. Even before coming to the US, many dealers had already rehearsed the stories they would tell their American customers about African art. "What struck me," Ron Dilley admits about art vendors in Dakar, "was the similarity in sales banter in the many boutiques and market-stalls I visited" (2005:237). This (clockwise from top left) 9 Two large adult giraffe carvings among other sculptures. 10 Three giraffes arranged to signify family tradi- tions 11 Elephant figures, as Doran H. Ross reminds us, are used to convey "power" (1992:14). PHOTO: ZAIN ABDULLAH winter 2011 africanarts 1 13</page><page sequence="7">banter is more than a mere sales pitch. By recounting the his- tory of each item, the authenticity of the art object is established, ostensibly increasing its salability. One day at the Market, Richie, an African American man in his mid-thirties from Philadelphia, entered Antas booth. He spent some time looking around, as Anta guided him from one piece to another and relayed a "story" about each one. Just as Richie was prepared to purchase a wooden giraffe, I approached the door to hear their conversation: "You cant buy just one, you'll break up the family," Anta says as Richie looks on in amazement. "The family?" Richie repeats. "Yeah," Anta replies. "The giraffes were meant to be a set of three - the two larger ones and the smaller calf," he adds. "They represent the importance of family in the African tradition." After he contemplates Antas story, Richie concludes, "Its about the handing down of tradition. They came in a set of three, and each giraffe represents a generation - or levels of life and history." "Yes, that's right," Anta interjects, "the giraffes tell a story of that tradition." Anta says that the stories he tells patrons are didactic, teach- ing them the "truth" about African life and customs (Figs. 9-10). Besides giraffes, other animals representing Africa are hand- made and carved items of elephants, zebras, cheetahs, and rhi- noceroses (Figs. 11-13). "When you understand the art," he claims, "you learn the culture, the society, you learn about the people. Everybody has a story, and African art teaches you the African story." But which "African story" is being taught? Or perhaps it would be better to ask what does it mean to consume this version of Africa as opposed to another? And who benefits? In many respects, African art vendors provide customers with an Africa they already know or imagine. And as African ven- dors learn more about the American appetite for Africana, the art objects they sell will conform to their imaginings. This is not to suggest, however, that the "Africa" these merchants know as expatriates is not also conjured in some ways, crafted out of their particular hometown experiences and exilic musings. Still, there is something much more at stake here. Aaron Glass speaks about identity and the politics of reclaim- ing lost objects. In similar fashion, the acquisition of the giraffes (as a symbol of African family life) can represent a strategy "to redress historical grievances and to address present and future cultural needs, specifically through reuniting people and objects at home'" (Glass 2004:123). In large measure, claiming owner- ship over the wooden giraffes is an act of redemption, and these objects signify loved ones lost and reclaimed. Some see the removal and transfer of traditional African objects into the West as a kind of forced displacement of persons (similar to enslaved or colonized peoples) and, thus, an act of violence (see Glass 2004:126, Peffer 2005:75, Myers 2004:207). 3 And just as other 14 african arts winter 201 1</page><page sequence="8">kinds of things like a car or an heirloom can become like fam- ily, buying these objects can signify the return of a relative. The purchase of objects representing lost ancestors or a ruptured cultural past, are viewed as returned "hostages" or the regaining of a "captured heritage" (Glass 2004:126). For others, however, the handicrafts at the Market are capable of possessing several meanings, despite Antas attempt to assign a single story to each. Brenda and Nia, two African American women in their twen- ties and thirties, respectively, wore dreadlocks and Afrocentric designs when they came to purchase two Ashanti akuaba (fer- tility dolls) and an Akan stool ( adwa ). While the akuaba dolls are customarily worn to induce conception or, if already preg- nant, to áífect the beauty or sex of an unborn child, the Akan stool symbolizes Ashanti unity (often political) and the soul of the nation (Figs. 14-16). At Muhammad's World of African Art, however, the traditional meaning of these objects was recontex- tualized to suit the diasporic needs of their owners. They entered Antas shop, and he immediately began to help them search: "I think these might work," Brenda announces, holding up two Akan fertility dolls. "No, no, you don't want to do that!" Anta yells back. "No, why?" Nia says. "Because they say to have [two of] the same statue is evil, it brings about evil- if you want a child, it will not be beautiful or maybe not healthy," Anta answers. "Well, that's okay because they're going to different people," Brenda interjects. "Yeah," Nia adds, "we're not going to use them to get pregnant anyway." "Oh, no!" Brenda jeers. "We need them for a different reason," Nia says, "We're going to give them to a couple of elderly women as gifts. The dolls are a symbol for the way they've mentored us and nourished us all these years - and gave us new life. So, for us, they have a different meaning."

"And the stools," Brenda adds, "will be given to them as a sym- bol of the way they have empowered us as mentors. The stool is the seat of power, and we want to give them to indicate the power they have given to us." "Oh, I see," Anta says, looking somewhat bewildered, "then, I guess, these will be fine." What is instructive about their purchase is how the objects were stripped of their previous reference to childbirth and Ashanti power. Instead, they have been transformed into cul- tural items with related but more abstract and contemporary meanings. "Such objects," Nancy Nooter says, writing about African artifacts, "were not thought of as art within their own settings, certainly not in the sense that we know it, but rather as media through which a desired result could be produced" (1988:9). Philippe Wamba, born of an African American mother and a Congolese father, writes about how meanings are shift- ing on both sides of the Atlantic, as objects are recycled between Africa and its Diaspora (1999:11). In this way, the proper "set- ting" of these objects matters less than how they are used. John Peifer has astutely argued for the need to include the African Diaspora as a context for African art and for ideas about Africa itself (2005:73). The artworks at the Harlem Market clearly speak to the way these objects were embedded in a very different social system, even if they were originally created for commercial pur- poses. As objects with their own biographies, as Igor Kopytoff has argued (1986), these items possess a former life as well as a diasporic one. Not only must we understand more about how the life of these art pieces changes over time and across contexts, but there is also a need to understand their new role in Western locales and how they come to reorder our lives (see Hardin and Arnoldi 1996:16-1 7).4 Brenda and Nia, who founded a rites-of-passage program for young girls in Brooklyn, selected African art objects for the way they structured their thoughts around ideas of mentorship and female empowerment. The value of these objects was not due to their past meaning but their present-day context. In fact, with- out this transmigration of meaning, the pieces would have little merit. "Things contribute to the cultivation of the self," Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi and Eugene Rochberg-Halton write, "when they help create order in consciousness at the levels of the per- son, community, and patterns of natural order" (1981:16). But identity formation can also involve efforts to reconstruct the past rather than the present. And African objects can become desir- able aids in an attempt to bring our current selves in line with a particular heritage or cultural value. 16 a Irl can arts winter 201 1</page><page sequence="10">MATERIALIZING THE PAST African merchants like Anta say bluntly that blacks buy Afri- can art to remember the past, and whites buy them to decorate their houses. But purchasing African art to reclaim the past or adorn a Western home is not mutually exclusive. Candy, for example, an African American woman in her fifties from Colo- rado, and her twenty-eight-year-old daughter Stacy were rum- maging through a table of masks at Antas shop (Fig. 17). They were looking to fill a spot on Stacy's "Wall of African Masks" in her Washington DC apartment: "May I help you ladies?" Anta says, walking towards them. "Do you like this one?" he asks as Stacy turns to look at him. "Do you think the colors will match?" she says talking to her mother. "What about the size? Oh, and the markings...?" she adds. "Well, I don't know," Candy replies slowly, squinting to size it correctly. "What about this one? The darker color might work, and it's not so fancy." 17 Small wooden masks on display. 18 Guro mask on display at the Harlem Market. Stacy turns and notices another nearby, "I like the hair on this УУ one. Becoming agitated, Anta snapped, "Are you sure you want African art?" "Oh, yeah, of course," Stacy answered. "This art is a link to my heritage." "Yeah," Candy added. "That's for sure." "Okay, do you like the color on this one?" Anta continues, pointing to another mask. Because heritage art materializes the past (Cherbo and Wyszo- mirski 2000), and objectifying it makes it physically attainable, "primitive" African art embodies the very time-honored history Candy and Stacy want to recover. But reclaiming one's heritage is about more than this. It is also about how one deploys the past. That is, seizing a particular version of the past allows one to effectively counter a marginal status or negative self image. As Theodore C. Bestor argues, ". . . often what is most important about the past is the present-day perception of it" (2004:16). winter 2011 african arts 17</page><page sequence="11">In the example above, African masks were adopted to fit a wholly Western context. This process of reclaiming an ances- tral past, then, speaks much more to how heritage art can create new meanings rather than restore a lost legacy (see De Jong and Rowlands 2008:132). This is not to say, however, that the African artworks at the Market do not provide consumers with a cultural link to their ancestry. But as Christine Price has argued, "West African masks, in all their many forms, are made for movement, music, and the dance" (1975:129). Repositioning African masks (or replicas of traditional ones) from being moving objects to wall art involves more than recapturing a lost legacy. It also involves a complex process of identity work. Assigning these masks to a wall display does not necessarily mean their impor- tance has been diminished. But it does mean that the life of the object has changed. As evidenced by the masking tradition of the Dogon, the overall quality of masks has improved because it has been given a new existence in the tourist market, and even tra- ditional masks, including the rituals they animate, come and go (Richards 2005:51-53). The aesthetic power of African objects, particularly masks with unique anthropomorphic qualities, reorients domestic space not only by adding its own traits, but by how it reflects the identity of its owner or other household members. Brian, a white male nurse in his early thirties and a regular at the Market, spoke about how a painting of an African girl on his kitchen wall "has become like a person" in his apartment. Like many of his other African artworks, they are all "like family." When he looks at her, he says, "she is looking right back at you." He could never part with it, and as he vowed, "I would have to carry it around with me forever." Writing about the power of the art gaze, Walter Benjamin contended that "[t]o perceive the aura of an object we look at means to invest it with the ability to look at us in return" (2007:188). In traditional settings, African masks are deployed under par- ticular circumstances, and some are never seen, at least not by certain people (women or boys) or only at specific times (see Bouttiaux 2009:59, 61, 63, 66; Halle 1993:149). In a survey that included upper-middle-class American homes, some owners of African masks appeared to dislike them, even though they adorned their homes with them, because of their empowering stare. "My husband would have masks all over the house, but I don't like them," said a woman from Manhasset. "I don't like them looking at us" (Halle 1993:150). Still, the intense gaze of African masks is precisely the reason many patrons search for them at the Harlem Market. 19 An array of naked and bare-breasted art figures. 18 atrfcan arts winter 201 1</page><page sequence="12">Wen stood inside Antas shop gawking at a Guro mask hang- ing above her head (Fig. 18). She came to New York from China when she was just fourteen, but now, in her late forties, she does graphic design for a New York advertising firm. I ease my way into the booth. "Do you collect African art?" I ask. She remains transfixed, but slowly turns to look at me, then returns her gaze to the mask. "Well, yes," she says carefully. "Pretty soon you won t be able to get pieces like this. They'll only be in museums." "Yes," Anta interjects as he enters the booth. "She s correct." With colorful designs and human and animals features, Guro masks of Côte ďlvoire are believed to have spiritual power and magical properties (see Bouttiaux 2009, Fischer and Homberger 1986), and Wen was intent on owning one: "I'm interested in this one," Wen announces. "Ahh," Anta says, "this is a mask with a lot of meaning in Afri- can culture." "Really," Wen responds, excited. 20 The Thinking Man statue that patrons purchase for its knowledge value.

We use it to protect the village from disease and evil things," he says. "Yes," he continues, "you might see it as just a nice-looking mask, but it is very important in our culture. These things have a purpose." "See," Wen says turning to me, "I could never see their art through their eyes because I'm not them. But this gives me a lit- tle more insight into the art . . .. African art isn't something I have time to investigate. So what he explained is important." Wen and most patrons believed that the art objects at the Mar- ket would educate them about Africa and its past. While there may be some truth to this, particularly if the intricacies of the objects' social history, production, and complex circulation were understood, Antas depiction of the Guro mask represents only part of the story. In fact, the purposes to which these objects are customarily put are diverse and complicated. Today, as Anne- Marie Bouttiaux argues, masked dancers among the Northern Guro are very much connected to the processes of modernity and assume multiple identities, particularly as masks travel across regions (2009:57, 65). Certain objects may even be used by other groups for different ceremonies (see Ravenhill 1996). What is striking about Anta and many other African vendors, however, is how they seem to have internalized paradigmatic approaches to their African products. But this is understand- able since carvers and dealers typically reference museum cat- alogs (Dilley 2005:237). Learning the "tribal" affiliation of the artwork, for example, where objects are assigned to a specific group (Asante), time or occasion (winter harvest), formal prac- tice (planting), and geographic region (Kumasi), reveals a great deal about how Westerners imagine Africa through the art (see Ravenhill 1996:266). Not only does this labeling force one to view African material culture as definitive and static, the primi- tiveness of the art also forces one to imagine Africa and its peo- ples as entities located in a timeless state of inertia. Beyond its putative meaning, Wen is interested in the passion the African mask evokes in her. "Art to me is intuitive beyond a rational response," she says, "and the words come afterwards." Once, she discovered a small Guro mask atop a heap of artworks. "It was the funniest thing I've ever seen in my life," she admits. "It looked very serious . . . [but] something about it was just so hilar- ious - I just had to have it. This particular piece was beautiful and had a great sense of humor. I just love it." In writing about the cul- tural importance of art, philosopher Susanne К. Langer asserted that the main purpose of art is to "objectify feeling" (2009:85), allowing us to better understand our emotions and gain a deeper grasp of the human experience. While Wen's occurrence differs from that of Candy and Stacy, both episodes speak to the various ways African masks help to inform their identities. REFLECTIONS The artworks at the Harlem Market may be classified as tour- ist art or what some might call heritage art. But in this age of imitation, where the copy rivals the real thing (see Taussig 1993), patrons are less concerned with these categories. Most customers were attracted to the African art because of its primitive quality or presumed naturalness, which was often depicted by numerous nude statutes (Fig. 19). Naked African objects can be miscon- strued by outsiders to connote sheer sexuality (Steiner 1994:13), supporting the Western notion that lying just beneath the sur- face of "primitivism" is an incessant thirst for licentious behav- ior (see Price 2001:47, Halle 1993:164-67). Others have a specific concern about art objects with explicit or elaborate meanings, and they tend to purchase contemporary pieces like the Think- ing Man for how it promotes knowledge or the black dolls for how they affirm African American beauty (Figs. 20-21). Many believe these artworks convey common ideas with no real spiri- tual connotations. By contrast, shoppers like Wen and Brian, the white male nurse, seek African objects that evoke passion or afford them an opportunity to tap into their emotional side, spiritual or other- wise. James, the young African American residing in Canada, also sought African artworks that would give him an intimate link to his ancestral past. However, whereas Wen often relied on the merchants to convey the meaning of the art, James typically ignored their story, expecting to lay claim to his own artwork. For Lian, the Chinese student looking for an African garment, the significance of her search was similar to that of Candy and Stacy but with a crucial difference. While it was important for both that their African materials (a dress and mask) be aestheti- cally pleasing, each item was adopted for separate purposes. For Stacy, the African mask had to symbolize her African leg- acy. But for Lian, the garment spoke to old country ways and a premodern lifestyle. The giraffes purchased by Richie and the akuaba dolls and Akan stool chosen by Brenda and Nia symbol- ized some aspect of African traditions and custom (see Robert- son 1994). However, the purposes to which they were put were quite different. The individual desires made for these objects clearly reveal that the commodities we buy perform a specific task for us, par- ticularly artworks purchased in places like the Harlem Market. In fact, markets are unlike most places. The various interac- tions occurring within them generate the possibility for alter- nate meanings and new understandings of the self. The "stories" being told there, Louise Crewe argues, "are themselves in a con- stant process of flux, of becoming," and what goes on in these spaces tell us much about who we are in relation to the things we consume (2003:356). Still, to discuss how the objects we buy reflect our identities is obviously banal and quite unnecessary. But many of the purchases occurring at the Harlem market, as this article has illustrated, are not merely about the construc- tion of an identity by way of the objects people buy. Rather, their purchases also involve how people imagine Africa and how the items, consumers, and sellers are involved in the negotiation of what Africa means. Understanding how this process occurs, it seems to me, makes the consumption of African art objects much more complex and certainly more meaningful than mere commodity exchange.

I was invited to deliver an earlier version of this article as a conference paper at "Africans in New York- 2006 Symposium," co-sponsored by the Museum for African Art, the Museum of the City of New York, and the Institute of African Studies at Columbia University, held at Columbia University, International Affairs Building, New York (April 21, 2006). For funding and research support during the early stages, I wish to thank the Smithsonian Institutions Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage and their National Museum of African Art. I also would like to thank the photographer, Sharjeel Kashmir, for his kind support and generosity. I also thank my graduate research assistant, G. Kipp Gilmore-Clough, for helping to create an updated list of reference materials during Fall 2009. And, finally, I want to express my appreciation for the anony- mous reviewers who read the draft so closely and provided detailed and very useful comments. 1 This article is based on an ethnographic research project primarily conducted between 2000 and 2004. In order to protect the identity and privacy of my respondents, I have replaced their real names with pseudonyms. While Muhammad's World of African Art was the actual name of the shop, I have previously referred to it as "Mustafa's World of African Art," in an attempt to extend some measure of privacy to its owner. 2 In his book Tsukiji, an ethnographic study of the Japanese fish market, Theodore C. Bestor succinctly describes the market as "an abstract economic institution or process" (2004:20). He goes on to say that, by com- parison, the marketplace is "a specific geographical place and a localized set of social institutions, transactions, social actors, organizations, products, trade practices, and cultural meanings motivated by a wide variety of factors including, but not limited to, 'purely economic' or market' forces" (ibid.). In his home country of Mali, Manthia Diawara recalled how marketplaces possessed a "transformative power" where one could find real fortune or simply sit and listen to the transcendent stories told by "tribal men" (1998:180-81). 3 For some background on the removal of African objects into'Western contexts and the cultural property debate, see Geary and Xatart 2007, Rubin 2002, Price 2001, Cuno 2009, Renfrew 2009, and Gibbon 2005. 4 Doran H.
