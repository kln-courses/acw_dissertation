Bartmann begins with a discussion of the problematic notion of a "Gegen- wartsliteratur" and Handke's place within it. The contemporary literary scene</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 409 (the past 20 years) has evolved from the confrontations (in the 1960's and early 1970's) between those advocating a politically committed literature and those representing an experimental, language-oriented writing to a present stage that has been labeled "Neue Subjektivitat," a term which in Bartmann's view has not been systematically defined and which contributes little to a proper estimation of what is happening today. Handke's writings belong to a trend that can be categorized as (in broad terms) phenomenological, sensitive to the innovations of film and dealing with the processes of subject-object perception and the ev- eryday experience of world, "das intentionslose Schauen, das Bilder aus dem Umkreis des alltiglichen Sichtbaren festhilt" (21). In contrast to many Handke critics who ascertain a major shift in the author's writing from his early language- oriented, polemical texts to what is seen as a return to traditional aesthetic models in his later works, Bartmann emphasizes an ongoing dialectical process, a con- sistent artistic intention which (using Handke's own words) can be called a quest for totality and harmony of subject and object in aesthetic vision, a project which bears affinities to (but is not a return to) prior literary traditions of Romanticism and Poetic Realism. This process is manifested primarily as a dialectic of de- construction (Bartmann uses the term because of its connotations) and recon- struction. Handke's early works (to Der kurze Brief zum langen Abschied) tend to display more of the deconstructive dimension of this dialectical movement, dismantling both literary (especially narrative) as well as everyday perceptual conventions with the aim of clearing the field for the author's new vision, one which stresses the attentive observation of phenomena and the attempt to capture these in aesthetic form (this latter aspect representing the reconstructive dimen- sion). The intense preoccupation with detailed descriptions in Die Hornissen not only deconstructs traditional conventions of plot and character in the novel genre but also educates the (patient) reader to read slowly, a process which finds its culmination in the notion of"Langsamkeit" in Handke's more recent texts. With Der kurze Brief a shift occurs which has an aesthetic-perceptual experience of simultaneity or totality as its center and which again has affinities to but is not the same as the epiphany experience characteristic of many modern texts. Handke's recent writings have elevated this momentary sense of totality to the status of an aesthetic program which features an anthropomorphic style of writing in which subject-object merge in a vision of "Form." Of the books on Handke which have appeared in the past several years, Bartmann's is the most stimulating; his em- phasis on the continuity of the author's project is to be commended. The book is for the most part carefully printed; however footnote 35 (195) is not to be found. University of Southern California -Thomas F. Barry</page></plain_text>
