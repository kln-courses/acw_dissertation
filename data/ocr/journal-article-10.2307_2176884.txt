EFORE dismissing the transcendental deduction, it seems advisable to bring together, in a brief form, the leading feat- ures of the estimate and criticism made in the preceding articles. To begin with the ultimate ground of the deduction, with the orig- inal unity of self-consciousness, there can be no reasonable doubt that this ground or unity is the supreme condition of all experience; and that doctrine is to-day accorded a place in the psychology of different philosophical schools. Kant's distinction between the original unity of self-consciousness and empirical self-conscious- ness on the one hand, and inner sense on the other, belongs for the most part to what is historical in his system, and, like the one-sided rationalism out of which it grew, is now largely ob- solete. This, however, remains of Kant's somewhat scholastic refinements: That the objective unity of apperception is not my consciousness of self as a unity, but that underlying unity which would abide even though I were conscious of self as a plurality. For there could be no consciousness of self as a plurality except in and through a comparing and combining consciousness, which as such must itself be a unit. Kant's objective unity of self- consciousness is a principle of knowledge, not a deliverance of consciousness. It is an epistemological condition, not a psy- chological observation. Secondly, there is no knowledge or experience without a syn- thesis of perceptions, which, as Kant rightly saw, is dependent upon</page><page sequence="2">450 T HE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. VIII. the original unity of self-consciousness. But this synthesis is also dependent upon other conditions independent of the per- cipient, which Kant, following his a priori bent, unfortunately overlooked,' greatly to the prejudice of that part of the truth which it is his merit to have put in the foreground. Thirdly, the synthesis of experience being dependent upon sev- eral conditions, we can determine what the functions of self-con- sciousness in its production may be, if at all, only by reflection upon experience and elimination of all the other conditions. Kant's determination of these functions as twelve, corresponding to the batch of logical judgments, has no other foundations than the rationalistic dogma that the business of self-consciousness is to judge, the arbitrary definition that judging is the reduction of a manifold to objective unity, and the scholastic prejudice that formal logic had made a perfect analysis of the judgment. By a mere survey of thought alone, the rational epistemologist would make out the functions of thought in our experience. The scien- tific epistemologist will attribute to the spontaneity of thought that residuum of our experience which, after experiment and measure- ment, he cannot demonstrate to be contributed through the medium of sense. Fourthly, the functions of self-consciousness, along with the other conditions of synthesis in experience, must be accepted as ultimate facts. They cannot be vindicated. They may be gewiesen but not bewiesen. The functions of self-consciousness, the supreme condition of experience, are the modes in which we interpret existence as it is given to us. To ask what right (quid luris) they have to such an office is to ask why intelligence is 1 Riehl (Philos. Krit., I, 365) comes to the rescue of Kant in this connection, but with much the same result as other well-meaning friends in similar cases. Treating of the " synthesis of reproduction in imagination " in the introduction to the trans- cendental deduction of the first edition of the Critique, Kant said (89-go) that apart from " the foundation a priori of a necessary synthetical unity of phenomenaa" the reproduction of phenomena in imagination (e. g., in empirical association) would be impossible, for the " faculty of empirical imagination would never find anything to do that it is able to do, and would remain, therefore, within our mind as a dead faculty unknown to ourselves." Riehl paraphrases this thoroughly Kantian doctrine thus: " Were there no regularity in objects, that is, in what is given to consciousness (not what is produced by it), our understandings would not develop but remain, etc."</page><page sequence="3">No. 5.] ELEMENTS OF UNDERSTANDING. 451 constituted as it is and not otherwise. From Kant's own higher point of view of the categories, as activities or functions of the understanding and not mere notions (even though a priori), there is no sense in the problem of Kant's transcendental deduc- tion at all; and if, when he began that deduction, he had had that insight into the functions of understanding or self-consciousness in the generation of experience which he won through elaborating it, he too would have found the deduction unnecessary, provided also he could have shaken off the rationalistic prejudice that sense- experience is not a condition of synthesis. But in the absence of that terminal insight, Kant was forced, as we have seen, into the deduction by the crude cast of his inherited rationalistic problem: How can self-originated notions in my head have real validity for the entities of the outside world ? Fifthly, there is nothing absolutely universal and necessary in experience. Even though understanding itself supplied a priori the principles of the relation of phenomena (as it does not), noth- ing but a rationalistic prejudice would lead one to regard these as less contingent than the phenomena themselves; and Kant has signally failed to show how such a priori contributions of the un- derstanding could endow the given materials of sense with uni- versality and necessity. Kant does not solve his problem, and his problem is a self-made one. But both problem and solution are superseded by the conception of a unity of self-consciousness as supreme condition of synthesis in our experience. As ex- perience must be accepted as it is given, though it may be dis- sected into its elements, so the causal relation in experience has no other claim to validity than the fact that it is given. Its dig- nity, its universality and necessity, its apriori origin in the un- derstanding, are all surviving fictions of rationalism. Causality is a postulate, first suggested by the consciousness of self as agent, by which we seek to interpret the given facts of nature. It is no subjective form we impose upon the world in the absence of ob- jective ground, in regard to which imposition it might be asked: Quid luris ? Sixthly, there is no proof that the twelve categories represent the functions of judging. Our exposition of Kant's derivation of</page><page sequence="4">452 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. VIII. them has shown how untenable and even absurd that derivation is. Three modes of judging find expression in the categorical, hypo- thetical, and disjunctive propositions; and the three corresponding categories of substantiality, causality, and reciprocity are the only categories that could make any pretensions to be based on real functions of judgment, and even their claim cannot be admitted. Seventhly, that there is no knowledge apart from sense-impres- sions is universally admitted. That a dissection of the opera- tions of intelligence in the cognition of things should be sup- posed to tell us anything about things themselves is incredible. What Kant offers as a priori knowledge of nature has turned out, so far as yet examined, to be mere tautology, or generaliza- tion from experience. Eighthly, the schematism of the categories, whereby the pure notions of the understanding are translated into their equivalents in time, which serves as mediator between notions and perceptions, has no raison d 'tre except Kant's arbitrary (though historically conditioned) opposition of sense and understanding. In prin- ciple, the schematism is really rendered unnecessary by the con- ception of the categories as functions of the mind, rather than as notions in it. And in execution it is capricious and artificial to the last degree. Ninthly, of those a priori judgments about nature, which, ac- cording to Kant, understanding produces by translation of its pure notions into time, all have collapsed under our examination except the analogies of experience. If further criticism should show these to be untenable (as we shall find), nothing will be left of Kant's transcendental deduction, or indeed of the entire Analytic, except the demonstration of the presence in all ex- perience and knowledge of the activity of a unitary self-conscious- ness. This is no doubt a truth of the first importance. But we are little aided, nay, we are the rather impeded, in the apprehen- sion of it, by threading deviously the obscure images through which Kant, following the lead of a rationalistic Zeitgeist, was conducted to its discovery. Here, indeed, is our new world. But the reasonings of its Columbus are not the best proof of the fact. It now only remains to consider the analogies of experience.</page><page sequence="5">No. 5.] ELEMENTS OF UNDERSTANDING. 453 And for the sake of brevity we shall confine ourselves to the principles of causality and substantiality. These are not only more important than the principle of reciprocity, but, as we have found more than once, they constitute the two foci of the Critique. And no injustice will be done by the omission, as the third analogy is impossible without the other two, and the criticism of these may easily be transferred to that. The analogies of experience, it will be remembered, are the a priori principles which result from the reflection (if this optical metaphor may be used) of the pure categories of the understand- ing, or functions of the original unity of self-consciousness, into the universal form of all experience, which form is time itself. They express the a priori time-relations (as these are constituted by the functioning of self-consciousness) into which all objects of sense must necessarily fall. And the principle of our first analogy is that " in all change of the objects of sense, substance is perman- ent, and its quantum in nature is neither increased nor lessened." The proof, which has been given in the preceding exposition, was, briefly expressed, to the effect that we could have no conscious- ness of simultaneity and succession, and consequently, no ex- perience, unless beneath the changes of phenomena lay some- thing permanent as their relating ground, that is, as ground of their order in time (which time, being itself unperceived, is in- capable of giving). But the whole ground and raison d'e'tre of this analogy is un- dermined by the simple consideration (patent enough to every- body but an imperviable a priori transcendentalist bent on the ' construction' of experience) that though a combining and comparing unity of self-consciousness is the supreme subjective condition for the perception of events as simultaneous or as successive, the circumstance whether it shall perceive them as simultaneous or successive is not determined by that self-con- sciousness (whether through gazing in the subjective mirror of substance or in any other way) but is predetermined for it in the given arrangement of the experience forced upon it by the objec- tive world. Kant's argument rests on that ultimate yet baseless assumption, that the whole analytic order or synthesis, and con-</page><page sequence="6">454 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. VIII. sequently the temporal order of our experiences, is a creation of the mind. With the fall of that rationalistic prejudice, the entire argument becomes unnecessary, if not meaningless. Kant thinks that understanding, or the spontaneity of mind, functioning as the mode of substance, must determine the temporal order of events, because time itself, as a priori and unperceived form of passive sense, cannot determine the order of its contents. The alterna- tive, that with the contents their arrangement is also given, never occurred to this experience-constructing rationalist ! But even on his own a priori grounds there is much to ques- tion in Kant's proof. It has the great defect, to which Laas has also called attention,1 of assuming as already known, the existence of permanent substances in the change of phenomena, adding only that the substance is 'the object itself' while the change- able is merely a ' mode' or 'determination' of the object. But, what is still more serious, this assumption of an abiding substrate of phenomena cannot render possible the determination of events as successive or simultaneous, for which purpose alone it is here assumed. Ignoring the fact that the time-arrangement of events is given to us, and not made by us, Kant concludes, that since this arrangement cannot be determined in relation to time itself, which is unperceived, it must be determined by means of a sub- strate, which in a manner represents empty time, or is the thought equivalent to it. This substrate is absolutely permanent being. But how will this help us to make those determinations of events as simultaneous and successive? We are carried away from time to existence. And even if we were not, substance is as, little perceivable as time; and if the latter was made impotent by being a mere thought, the former has precisely the same defect. Nay, in the schematism of the categories, it was only through translation into time that substance was to receive a sensuous realization. How then can it here be maintained that, though time cannot assign simultaneity and succession to its contents. because it is not perceived, yet substance can do so, though sub- stance is not perceived, and stands for an aspect of existence I Kant's Analogien der Erfahrung, 65.</page><page sequence="7">No. 5.] ELEMENTS OF UNDERSTANDING. 45 5 wholly disparate from time and its modes of succession and simultaneity ? Nor is the thesis of the first analogy helped out by Kant's other proof. This thesis sets out with the assumption that our ap- prehension of any sensible complex is always successive, and the argument consists of the assumption that the indispensable con- dition for distinguishing in this subjective succession what is ob- jectively simultaneous from what is objectively successive is that a permanent unchanging something underlies the stream of change. Now whether consciousness is serial in the absolute sense here assumed, can be settled only by experiments in the psychological laboratory, and these, I believe, so far tend to confirm the popular view that up to a certain limit we may ap- prehend at one and the same moment a plurality of phenomena. Were this established beyond all doubt, there would be no need of Kant's ' substance' for differentiating objective simultaneity from objective succession. But granting the initial assumption that consciousness is serial, how will the abstract notion of sub- stance enable one to say that part of the subjective series is an objective co-existence, and part of it an objective succession? Kant has no answer beyond the mere assertion. From his standpoint, the thing had somehow to be done, and, from his standpoint, nothing but understanding functioning as the cate- gorical judgment, that is through substantiality, could do it. In fact, it is Kant's a priori bias alone which leads him to assign to the notion of substance a function which it cannot discharge. Drop that bias, and it becomes evident that to ask why some things are sequent and others co-existent is to ask the absurd question, why they are what we find them to be. But the particular root of this evil is the rationalistic assump- tion that the notion of substance has an a priori origin, that it is a spontaneous product of the mind which makes experience pos- sible. The fact is, as has been already hinted, that substance, in Kant's sense, is no part of our ordinary experience at all. The notion of thing is a constituent factor in our experience, and we have already seen how it originates from the projection of the apperceptive activity of the ego into those involuntary sense pre-</page><page sequence="8">456 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. VIII. sentations which have a spatial unity and a temporal coherence. And the ordinary consciousness does not expect to find these things, or any part of them, abiding and unchanging. On the contrary, it conceives of them as coming into existence and going out of existence, and never dreams of an unchanging sub- stratum of which those changes are only modes of existence. Certain experiments, it is true, have led the modern scientist to revise the popular conception of thing, or to abandon it for the hypothesis of the indestructibility of matter, or the conservation of energy; and it is counted one of the great achievements of the science of the last half century that, mainly by the discovery of the correlation of certain forces, it has turned this hypothesis into a verified theory. And as a matter of history, not only has the popular consciousness always lacked the Kantian conception of substantiality, but when the philosophers and scientists of earlier centuries spoke of substance, they conceived it rather through the attributes of simplicity and activity. It is true that many of those earlier thinkers had conjectured that the quantity of matter in the universe was constant. But the conception was so alien, even to educated men, that most of the efforts of the alchemists, for example, rested on the contrary assumption. Yet it was the chemistry which grew out of alchemy that, perhaps more than any other science, contributed to the dissolution of the popular illusion. Chemical combinations showed that the con- stituents never lost their weights, and chemical analyses that combinations would yield up their constituents unchanged. And similarly in every branch of natural science, investigators began with the popular conception of thing as a more or less individual- ized and fixed something, though still subject to change, and were forced to keep correcting it till, as Wundt admirably says, " they reached the metaphysical conception of a substance with constant attributes, which in itself is absolutely unapproachable through perception, but in its effects produces all phenomena that go to make up the web of external experience."' The notion of substance is not, as Kant supposes, an epistemological condi- I Logik (ist edition), I, 485.

One can have experience with- out it, but we need it for the scientific interpretation of objects, that is for interpreting them otherwise than they are immediately given to us in experience. It is thus capable of indefinite devel- ment and enrichment, yet like every other scientific conception, it can never altogether throw off its hypothetical character. Both points were overlooked by Kant. Passing from the first to the second analogy, we find a line of argument which is open to criticisms similar to those just made upon the principle of substantiality. The principle of this analogy is, that " all changes take place according to the law of the connex- ion of cause and effect." And its proof is that the a priori causal connections make experience possible, by first enabling us to distin- guish between a subjective flow of impressions, and an objective sequence of events. "This takes place by the understanding transferring the order of time to the phenomena and their exist- ence, and by assigning to each of them as a consequence an a priori determined place in time."' But for this a priori synthesis (in this case causal) of the understanding, the presentations of sense would never take on the character of objectivity and objec- tive relation. " It is, therefore, always with reference to a rule by which phenomena, as they follow that is, as they happen, are determined by an antecedent state, that I can give an objective character to any subjective synthesis (of apprehension); nay, it is under this supposition only that an experience of anything that happens becomes possible."' This proof from 'the possibility of experience' is one with which readers of the Critique are familiar enough. Whatever its value in general, it may be met in the present case by showing its irrelevancy. That experience is impossible without the prin- ciple of universal and necessary connection between events in time, is disproved by the simple observation that this principle is itself the late product of intellectual development, and, being form- erly absolutely unknown, it is not even to-day an element in the experience of the vast majority of mankind. Nor can it be said that it operates in them unconsciously, since otherwise men could 1III, I8I (I75). 2 III, I78 (I7I)-</page><page sequence="10">458 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. VIII. not distinguish objective coexistence from objective succession, or either from the flow of subjective impressions. For it must be held, as in the similar case of substantiality, that our presenta- tions contain in themselves the signs of their objectivity, which it is our business alone to interpret. Understanding, functioning through the principle of the hypothetical judgment, is powerless to determine objective sequence; it can only read what is given to it through inner and outer presentations. Temporal succes- sion is simple, and the consciousness of it is primitive. We do not need the notion of causality in order to explain our consciousness of the relations of time. But we do need these temporal relations as motive, occasion, and perhaps ultimate warrant for the notion of causality. Causality, as defined by Kant, is really a differen- tiation of the more general consciousness of time, which includes both regular and irregular, causal and casual connections; and Kant was nearer the truth in the schematism of the categories, when he took the time-consciousness as a datum for the exhibi- tion of causality, than in the proof of the second analogy of ex- perience, where the notion of causality is made the condition of our consciousness of time, or of objective sequence. But even on Kant's own ground, the proof of the principle of the second analogy is far from convincing. On the contrary, it is made up of a tissue of assertions, which at best are mere as- sumptions. That all apprehension is successive, is the starting point, and as we have already shown, in dealing with the first analogy, this mere dictum cannot be accepted, and is probably false. Similarly with the assumption that perceptions themselves contain no hint of their arrangement in time. Surely a vision not obscured by the a priori bias, must recognize that the order of events in time is given to us with the events themselves. That we put a universal and necessary (and therefore according to Kant, objectifying and objective) time-order into a matter in itself absolutely indifferent is a supposition that has no probability in itself, has no warrant in fact, and originates only in a rationalistic depreciation of sense experience and a corresponding exaltation of creative understanding. But even if it be granted that we are the source of such objectification of sequences of ideas, and that</page><page sequence="11">No. 5-] ELEMENTS OF UNDERSTANDING. 459 we objectify by means of a rule, and that this rule rests upon a concept of the understanding, what reason is there for supposing that this must be the particular concept of causality, or that function of judging through ground and consequence which gives rise to the hypothetical proposition. Might it not, as Riehl suggests,' be rather the notion of the unity and continuity of time ? For such a notion, excluding as it does the supposition of an interval of empty time, makes it necessary that events perceived should follow one another immediately. At any rate, it is not easy to see how the mere notion of dependence, which is all the category of causality contains apart from time, should be the ground of the determination of a necessary succession in time. Kant has been much lauded for undermining Hume's derivation of causality from customary experience of sequence by his great discovery that the post hoc already implied the proper hoc. But Kant fails to establish this antidote to Hume. And when he goes on to acknowledge, much to the vexation of Schopenhauer, that " the succession in time is the only empirical criterion of an effect with regard to the causality of the cause which produces it,"2 he arouses a suspicion that sequence in time is, as Hume supposed, the entire content of the causal relation.3 But whether causation is exhausted by posthoc or not, there can be no reasonable doubt, as the acute Maimon long ago demonstrated, that our conscious- ness of the succession of events is not dependent upon the notion of causality. But Kant's entire argument is built up on that foundation. Kant differs from Hume, not because he sees in causation more than succession, but because he holds the causal relations of the world of experience to be the reflex of nontemporal relations of thought, just as Leibniz held them to be the reflex of trans- cendent things in themselves, whose kingdom is where time and space are not. So much of Hume's doctrine as was consistent with this a priori bias, Kant readily accepted. But his sense of the 'dignity' of cause forbade the supposition of its empirical origin. " If this were so," he exclaims in the midst of his re- 'P hilos.

VIII. peated proofs of the second analogy, "the rule which the con- cept supplies, that everything which happens must have a cause, would be as accidental as experience itself. The universality and necessity of that rule would then be fictitious only, and devoid of any true and general validity, because not being a priori." ' It would be difficult to find a clearer exhibition of the animating motive of Kant's argument. The causal principle, he says, is a prior a universal and necessary contribution of the under- standing to experience; therefore, the time-order, in which it is supposed to manifest itself in experience, is also determined by the a priori synthetic functioning of the understanding. But it is a mere assumption that the causal principle is a priori; a mere assumption that such (supposed) category of dependence has any- thing to do with determining references in time; a mere as- sumption that sequences in time are not given to us, forced upon us, instead of being made by us. Nay, the opposite of every one of these assumptions is not only probable, but almost certain. They arose in Kant from that old leaven of rationalism. Er- roneous as they undoubtedly are, they serve, however, to give exaggerated emphasis to the important discovery of Kant's, that, apart from the synthetic unity of self-consciousness, nothing, not even an inseparable association of perceptions, could generate in us the conception of causality. Kant's error arose from relying exclu- sively on this subjective condition of knowledge, to the total neglect of the objective factors. And this is the more regrettable as there would be no self-consciousness at all apart from temporal and spatial perceptions, though these, on the other hand, could not originate in the absence of a capacity for sensation and move- ment. Kant sees everywhere the dependence of the lower forms of perception and intellection upon the higher, but nowhere the equally real dependence of the higher upon the lower. The only apology for him is that, though real knowledge implies both fac- tors and their mutual conditioning of one another, the subjective factor, as Mr. Ward has observed, is " always a step ahead. We find again without us the permanence, individuality, efficiency, and adaptation we have found first of all within."2 1 III, I 78 ( 7 I-72). 2Art. 'Psychology,' Encycloptedia Britacnnica, Vol. XX, p. 8I.</page><page sequence="13">No. 5.] ELEMENTS OF UNDERSTANDING. 46 r The two terms, cause and effect, indicate what reflection also proves, that, in the original and popular conception of causality two notions are implied: an agent and its action or effectuation. Like the notion of thing or substance, and design or adaptation, the notion of causation originates in the anthropomorphic tend- ency of human thought. Certain temporal and spatial relations among our presentations furnish the occasion, and indeed the ultimate ground, of our personification of them and imputation to them of activity and efficiency. And the whole movement of science and philosophy to which man is impelled by the contra- dictions latent in this primitive mythology consists, as I think Mr. E. B. Tylor has somewhere suggested, in restricting the range, and intensifying the content, of this germinal interpretative- principle of personality. Not that our knowledge can ever alto- gether cease to be anthropomorphic. Yet science can and does. set aside the mythical analogies of primitive thought by experi- mental investigations which those provisional analogies themselves. make possible. And by turning causality, which, as personifica- tion of self-activity, originally connoted the efficiency of objective agents, into a law of time-sequence, it has escaped in this con- nection the naive anthropomorphism of savage philosophy. Yet it is proper to observe that ' the metaphysical question regarding the ultimate nature of the universe,' which science with its quest of order and sequence is not called upon to touch, can only be solved, if at all, on the supposition that the macrocosm we perceive on the outside answers to the microcosm which in self-consciousness we know through and through. Through growing knowledge of the world, the content of self- consciousness is ever being enriched. Yet, at every stage, self- consciousness is the key wherewith we interpret the world. But to return to the specific question of causality. In its origin we have seen the causal conception results from the pro- jection of the self and its activity into the things of the external world. But such a conception proved inadequate, with the growth of science, for the interpretation of nature. And scientists, while retaining the old name, substituted for the conception of an agent or thing producing actions the quite different conception of</page><page sequence="14">462 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. VIII. events related together through time. The primitive complex of causality was differentiated into a metaphysical element, the notion of force, and an empirical element of later development, the notion of a temporal order or connection in natural occur- rences. This revolution in the conception of causality was in- augurated by Galileo's discovery of the after continuance of the effects of motions produced by impact and gravity. The facts were shown to be in conflict with the scholastic maxim, cessante causa cessat effects, which was founded upon the older interpre- tation of causality. And the essential positive achievement of Hume was to domicile in philosophy the new conception of cause and effect as events temporarily related, which had already been established in the experimental sciences: that there was no necessary conjunction, so far as we could perceive, between any one event and another, Hume rightly maintained. But that all causal inference was therefore illusory nobody should venture to assert; as, from that fact, and from an absurd theory of the origin of the idea of causation, Hume too hastily concluded. We may say with Kant that the 'universality and necessity' of natural laws would be gone, but not that they would therefore be " devoid of any true and general validity." And the causal principle itself-" every event must have a cause "-will of course sink to the level of a postulate, though a postulate which all experience verifies. It is scientific or philosophic dogmatism alone which ever lifted it above that solid ground of verification. Ordinary consciousness or experience is indifferent to the maxim, because its causal principle is a very different one, namely, the projection of what the ego experiences in acting and being acted upon into the objects and movements of the external world. If the scientific consciousness is unable to represent the causal rela- tion in any other form than that of succession in time, it will also find on reflection that there is no warrant for holding any suc- cession to be necessary, or any event necessarily connected with any other. The metamorphosis of the original anthropomorphic concep- tion of causality, under the influence of experimental science, into the conception of insubstantial events temporally related to</page><page sequence="15">No. 5-] ELEMENTS OF UNDERSTANDING. 463 one another, which Hume first introduced into philosophy, was appropriated by Kant and invested with the dignity and authority attributed by rationalism to a priori principles, at the head of which Kant gave it an exalted place. That the principle cannot be extracted a priori from the pure category of dependence, or from that function of judging which finds expression in the hypo- thetical judgment, we have already seen. But there is, it may be observed, an element of truth in Kant's contention. The logical principle of ground and consequence, though not the generating source, may be conceived as the far-off ideal to which the new conception of causality is striving to subordinate the laws of nature. The one deals with a relation of thought, the other with a relation of events. And since the time of Descartes, Galileo and Hobbes, the aim of physical science has been to bring all the events of nature under laws which can be necessarily deduced from mathematico-mechanical first prin- ciples. And from such data the astronomer is now able to infer and predict the character of future events, with the same certainty as the logician demonstrates conclusions from given premises. This ratiocination is also possible and effectual in other branches of applied physics; and within recent years chemistry has been turned into a branch of deductive science. Owing to the complexity of their subject matter, biology and psychology remain for the most part experimental sciences, though here and there open to the application of mathematics. Were, however, the ideal of modern science realized, and all events of nature reduced to a web of connections and depen- dencies, we should have before us a complete analogy to the subordination of consequence to ground in logical thought. But even then, there would be no other relation than that of analogy between logical thinking and the ordered succession of cosmic events.' Kant's theory of causation, therefore, is left without a basis, when his unfounded rationalistic assumptions are put aside. Of the whole Analytic, little remains to us at the close of our examination. It turns out that the deduction and schematism of the categories, I For a different view, akin to Kant's, see Wundt's Logik (ist edit.), I, 547-552.</page><page sequence="16">464 THE PHIL OSOPHICAL RE VIE W. with the a priori principles founded thereon, including those of substantiality and causality, were but efforts, though the efforts of an intellectual giant, to perpetuate to future ages the essence of dissolving rationalism. For a time, indeed, they succeeded in galvanizing it into life. And the moving simulacrum, as every- body knows, made great stir in Germany and elsewhere. But fact, which Hegel calls the realm of contingency, has proved an environment unpropitious to the ghostly entity. And of it all there now remains as sole immortal principle, the unity of self- consciousness as supreme condition of all thought and knowl- edge. At any rate, in view of the criticisms here presented, it seems forbidden to accept any other doctrine of Kant's con- structive theoretical philosophy. Of his practical philosophy this is not the place to speak. Nor, considering the results al- ready reached, is there now any motive for a consideration even of that part of the theoretical philosophy (the Dialectic) which is devoted to the destruction of metaphysics. For this destruc- tive criticism is built upon that constructive a priori philosophy which we have been forced to reject. And, in any case, Kant's Dialectic should be associated rather with his ethics and natural theology than with that constructive theory of knowledge which forms the immortal subject of the A3'stketic and the Analytic.
