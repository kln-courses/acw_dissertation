Uni- versity of Illinois Press, Urbana 1990. For many obvious reasons glasnost in the Soviet Union has certainly been welcomed. Moreover, the openness becomes much more conspicuous when fascinating material from the immense and diversified Russian geographical territory is published in English. The title of the book under discussion, The Ancient Art of Northern Asia, may be misleading as the material comes only from ancient Siberian civilizations. The scope of the work is not, however, limited to art alone; it also includes ethnography, which places the art in its cultural context. Anatoly Martynov, much respected by his peers, is Chair, Faculty of Archaeology, Kemerovo State University. In ad- dition, as he was a student and colleague of the well-known late Soviet archaeologist A.P. Okladnikov, Martynov has the highest credentials to present the history and stylistic inter- pretation of ancient Siberian art. Much of his work in this new volume is the result of his personal research and the majority of the illustrations have not been published in the Western world. The foreword written by translator Shimkin defines certain geographic conventions, and sets forth the very real problems encountered in interpreting Russian meaning and thought into English. One feels that the trans- lator, in spite of a formidable task, was very rarely over- whelmed by Russian syntax, and has been successful in reflecting the author's scope, interpretations, and style. Martynov organized the subject matter into six chapters, five of which are defined by cultural/historical periods- Palaeolithic, Neolithic, Aeneolithic-Early Bronze, Scytho- Siberian, and Mediaeval. The final chapter traces the "Tree of Life," a major art motif throughout Siberian history. In the introduction Martynov reminds us that only one source, archaeological history, is available with which to reconstruct the lifestyles and worldviews of ancient populations who inhabited the Siberian taiga and steppes. The extant artistic genres, the substance of the archaeological history, are for the most part limited to carvings (Palaeolithic), metalwork, petroglyphs, stone stelae, and balbals (Mediaeval Turkic stat- uary). The author commences with a historical review of north- ern Asian archaeology. Least known in the Western world are the many hundreds of petroglyph sites (pitanitsy), with an unfathomable number of renditions on stone. First re- corded in the 18th century, the petroglyphs are found over an immense geographic region. They reveal mythological beliefs, and depict epic scenes as well as real-life actions from each chronological period. In contrast, perhaps the most renowned are the "Peter the Great" Scythian gold treasures (now housed in the Hermitage), which were recorded as early as 1699 in written reports chronicling the first known kurgans to contain gold objects. The Palaeolithic period saw the first multiple migrations from Siberia to Alaska. This is also the period of the "art of the mammoth hunters." During this extended time begin- ning 300,000 to 400,000 years ago, true schools of art re- corded cultural traditions and aesthetic ideas. Carved realistic anthro- and zoomorphic images symbolized magical activities, and others represented the rational aspects of everyday life. Although in certain areas of Eurasia new art forms were developed during the Neolithic period, hunters and fishers of northern Asia preserved many fundamental Palaeolithic traditions. Three artistic genres may be used to illustrate the artistic trends of the time: distinctively ornamented ceramic vessels, sculpture, and petroglyphs. In contrast, images of the bear and water bird, predominant in the Palaeolithic period, continue to endure but are now sublimated by mul- titudinous drawings and carvings of the Siberian moose. An impressive animal, the moose is portrayed with dynamic realism revealing the semantic foundation for "hunting magic." During the Neolithic two geometric styles of ornamenta- tion-one from the Siberian region and the other from the Amur-Far Eastern territory-were prevalent. Moreover, in the Amur, anthropomorphic decoration prevails in the form of expressive, and to some degree realistic, masks carved into ceramic vessels. Some masks display startling comma- shaped eyes in heart-shaped faces, while others have spiral eyes emphasizing a menacing expression. Martynov points</page><page sequence="2">1991] BOOK REVIEWS 545 out that much Neolithic ornamentation is repeated today as Siberian ethnic motifs decorating the national dress. This ornamentation reveals the continuity of ancient style and subject matter which may be associated with a constancy of ethnic folklore and mythology. Religious and cultic beliefs also have a long history in Siberia. Martynov comments on the Bear Festival and its associated cult, which has its formation during the Neolithic and was still practiced in the 19th century. The author cites ethnographic material demonstrating several levels of sig- nificance attached to the cult. On one plane the bear was the totemic ancestor of certain Siberians; on another the animal, nurtured beside the hearth before being sacrificed, was given divine attributes. To further emphasize an omnipresent im- age, "bear" in some Siberian languages signified "personifi- cation of the thundering sky." Martynov's firsthand study of Siberian petroglyphs pre- sents insight into the lesser known art forms. In general, while carving on living stone, ancient artists depicted con- cepts integral to their worldview. However, the type of image, the manner in which it is portrayed, and the technique of execution are distinct within each cultural zone and historical period. For example, during the Neolithic in the taiga, the moose, which played a parallel role to the Palaeolithic mam- moth, is displayed in real-life poses-hunting and reproduc- tion-as well as in mythical scenes. In contrast, along the banks of the Siberian rivers, boat scenes, snakes, and images of the underworld may represent shamanistic folklore, i.e., carvings illustrating the legend of souls who follow the set- ting sun, as they float toward the origin of their ancestors. As a whole, petroglyphs reveal the lifestyles and the lores of hunters and of pastoralists living in mountain valleys and across the steppes. These renditions help bring the world of primitive humankind closer to our frail understanding. The Bronze Age, dating from the second half of the third millennium to the end of the second millennium, saw the evolution of a new cultural environment based upon devel- oping nomadism. Horse-drawn carts, and then mounted travel, displaced river transportation, opening up great new areas of pastoralism. Within the framework of the Okunevo culture, and based upon the symbiotic agricultural and herd- ing economies, the Scytho-Siberian animal style art devel- oped. Three new cultic forces also came to fore: the cult of the sun, of sacred animals, and of nature. Within this framework two artistic genres from the Neo- lithic endured-petroglyphs and decorated ceramics. In ad- dition, a third innovative art form appeared-carved stone stelae bearing cultic/religious connotations. Although some images on the stelae are realistic, others representing the sun cult are embellished with solar symbols carved in the form of concentric or nucleated circles. Images of a third type, now playing to the cult of nature, wear "crowns" com- posed of radiating lines, or plant-like depictions that burst forth from their heads. The Scytho-Siberian world, stretching from the Danube in the west to inner Asia in the east, shared the economic commonalities of a herding lifestyle. Animal style images in this homogeneous culture are executed in a specific mode. Although the finds from the Pazyryk kurgans located in the Altay were previously published in English, Martynov adds further insight into the interpretation of the fantastic images portrayed in textiles and wood. Less known is the art of the Tagar culture (sixth-third century B.C.), located along the Yenisey River east of the Altay. Here artistic style and motifs tend toward the herbivore in quiescent attitudes. In addition to rams, ibex, and reindeer cast in metal, stylistically similar animal representations were carved on petroglyphs. Scytho-Siberian mythology is revealed in representations of the solar animal, the sacred fire, and the force of vegeta- tion. The reindeer is the animal deity associated with the sun. The cosmic hunt myth, first identified in the Palaeo- lithic, becomes especially dynamic in the Scytho-Siberian epoch and, moreover, is still known among Siberian peoples of recent centuries. As the Great Migrations of the last centuries B.C. com- menced and became the norm, the ethnicity of the steppe and northern Asian peoples became complex. The incur- sions of Hunnic peoples mark the termination of the Scytho- Siberian world and the formation of Old Turkic ethnic groups, which are recorded historically. Conflicts and wars over pastures and trade routes persisted and internecine struggles took their toll. The first nomadic-feudal states were now formed. The earliest of the two cultural and artistic periods follow- ing the Scytho-Siberian era began with the Hunnic conquest. The second, the Mediaeval epoch, commenced in the sixth century A.C. and continued until the Mongol conquest, early in the 13th century. These new invasions changed the cul- tural structure. Although animal-style art continued in the Hunnic period, it became static and conventionalized. The sun and sacred animal still retained mythological signifi- cance; however, most revealing is the fact that the mythical reindeer was now replaced by representations of the horse. With the advent of Mediaeval culture a transformation occurred in art representations. Petroglyphs became narra- tive, illustrating epics, or perhaps authentic battles between warriors holding banners aloft while riding steeds. Although a certain carelessness in execution is now noted, constant motion and dynamism are the dominant style. Burial rituals become more complex and varied. Artistic burial masks and clay sculptured heads with painted features are the innova- tive tomb finds of this period. Balbals, stone portrait sculp- tures identified with the Turkic speaking peoples, are associated with burial practices. Many hundreds of the stelae have been discovered over an immense geographic region: east across the steppes from the Urals to eastern Mongolia and south to the Tien Shan mountains. The balbals, gener- ally representing a man with Mongoloid features, were ren- dered in numerous stylistic variations. Some elements, however, are common to all: most images carry a dagger or sword under the belt, and hold a bowl to the chest. Although additional study is needed before understanding their full significance, Martynov presents the current interpretations that begin to unravel the mystery of the balbals. In the final chapter Martynov traces representations of the Tree of Life depicted throughout all periods of northern Asian art. Among many examples cited by the author is the earliest extant representation: the Goddess of Fertility with the Tree of Life rendered upon the large felt carpet from the Pazyryk 5 kurgan. Martynov is convincing in his argu- ments that the Tree of Life is also symbolized in the guise of an animal with a large rack of horns. The depth of the tree cult is verified in its longevity; Martynov comments that it still persists today among the Altayns.</page><page sequence="3">546 BOOK REVIEWS [AJA 95 Martynov's work is concise, but somewhat lengthy. Due to the time needed for preparation, new archaeological mate- rial that would modify dates of the Scytho-Siberian period is not included. Nonetheless, this book is a major contribu- tion to our comprehension of the worldview of ancient Si- berian populations as seen through their art.
