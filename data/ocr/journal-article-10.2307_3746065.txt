But this immediate contemporaneity is merely an occasion, which can scarcely be expressed more emphatically than in the proposition that the disciple, if he understood himself, must wish that the immediate contemporaneity should cease, by God's having the earth" (p. 88). (The reference in the last sentence is, of course, to John xvi. 7.) Written in 1843, in the heyday of the dominance of the Hegelian philosophy in the schools of Germany and of the lands which looked to Germany for philosophical leadership, the book before us contains many digs at the ruling system, to its birth under the shadow of which, however, Kierkegaard's own philosophy doubtless owed in the main its own markedly "dialectical" char- acter. Even the representation of Christianity as essentially a "paradox," and so necessarily an offence to reason, demanding for its acceptance not reason but faith, while put forward in opposition to the tendency of the theology associated with post-Kantian idealism to minimize the significance of Christianity as a unique revelation of God in history, bears upon itself the unmistakable stamp of the type of thought against which it expresses a reaction. But it is none the less of great importance for the understanding of Christianity that it should be presented not only as an unveiling of the eternal nature of God in which the historical circumstances attending the revelation have only a transitory value, symbolical or illustrative, but as something without parallel or possible substitute, an Incarnation unprece- dented and unrepeatable. Mr. Haecker, who is himself evidently a Roman Catholic, while emphasizing the genuine service rendered to Christian theology by Kierkegaard in his insistence on the singularity of Christian experience, points out that his presentation of Christianity in the Philosophical Fragments suffers from its detachment, for all the stress laid by him on historical reality, from the actual historical context afforded by Church and Sacraments; and this not only as that context appears in Roman Catholicism; for, in his recoil from the compromise with the world to which the State Church of his own country seemed to him to be committed, Kierkegaard refused on his deathbed to receive the communion from those who were to him only "the king's officials." In the Philosophical Fragments again, as Mr. Haecker points out, the manifestation of God in time which is the special object of Christian faith is apparently regarded as not merely paradoxical, but as catastrophic-somewhat after the fashion of Marcion-and here the line of thought represented by Karl Barth in the present generation seems inclined to follow Kierkegaard. Professor Swenson's translation occasionally-especially in the earlier pages of the Philosophical Fragments-offers sentences which can scarcely be called intelligible English (e.g., on p. 8, "the Socratic self-denial to think its nothingness"), but on the whole reads well; and he deserves the gratitude of English-speaking readers for making this thought-provoking book available to them in their own language.

In a generation whereof some of the most distinguished theologians, in their desire to emphasize the uniqueness of the Christian revelation, refuse 485</page><page sequence="2">PHILOSOPHY to leave room in their defence of a religious view of the world for a natural theology, the reassertion in these lucid and weighty Hibbert Lectures, by a thinker of Professor Dawes Hicks's competence and distinction, of the "philo- sophical bases" of the belief in God as a supreme living, intelligent, and personal Being, the source of the order, beauty, and goodness to be found in nature and of the minds which apprehend these, is timely and welcome. The arguments urged in support of such a belief are none the worse for being familiar, and they are, as one would expect from the writer, so stated as to exhibit their strength in view of the objections most often brought against them by representatives of the science and thought of to-day. It is, however, to be noted that, as Prof. Dawes Hicks points out in his Preface, the problem of evil is left on one side and reserved for future treatment; while nothing is said about the problem, so intimately associated with the tradition of natural theology and with the acceptance of such a theism as is here maintained, of human immortality: for his judgment of this question we are referred to other works of our author already in print. Professor Dawes Hicks holds that the distinctive feature of the kind of thinking which we distinguish as "philosophical" from that which we call "scientific" is that "all parts of what we take to be reality are contemplated as having a common relation to the thoughts and interests of the human conscious subject." The work of philosophy lies in the critical examination of human experience, and its "ultimate task" is "to frame a coherent repre- sentation of reality as a whole which will enable us to connect together con- sistently and harmoniously the several facts and aspects of our total ex- perience." It cannot therefore ignore a feature of human life which have had throughout the whole course of man's history so far-reaching an influence on his experience as religion. Everything goes to show that religion is "a normal and universal expression of human nature" and that it is closely associated with what are generally admitted to be its greatest achievements. It is thus obviously the function of philosophy critically to examine religious experience, as it is the duty of those who set store by it to submit it to such free and open inquiry as alone can justify its pretensions to be genuine know- ledge. For Prof. Dawes Hicks this inquiry must be concentrated on what he finds to be "the central affirmation of the religious consciousness, at least in modern times," namely, "the assurance of a conscious relation" of human minds "to a supreme Mind transcending the whole family of dependent minds." If philosophy is what Professor Dawes Hicks has defined it as being, it must necessarily be in a sense "anthropomorphic"; and his second Lecture, which he calls, borrowing the title of a work by Thomas Huxley, "Man's Place in Nature," discriminates true from false anthropomorphism, and contends that the importance of the spiritual qualities by which man, and man alone among the natural objects within our knowledge, is distinguished, being "absolutely incommensurable with material magnitude," is in no way reduced by the consideration of the contrast between man's material insig- nificance and the immensity of the universe contemplated by astronomical science. We are invited to "acknowledge with Lotze how absolutely wide- spread is the extent of the mechanism" and "how perfectly subordinate is the significance of the function which mechanism has to fulfil in the structure of the world." The unsatisfactoriness of the explanations offered by scientific naturalism of our sense either of beauty or of moral obligation is once more exposed; and the attempt of Positivism to supply in "humanity" an adequate object for the religious sentiment is acutely examined and dismissed. Of the traditional arguments for the existence of God Professor Dawes 486</page><page sequence="3">NEW BOOKS Hicks regards the Cosmological Argument-which he restates in a form similar to that suggested by Professor Taylor in his "Vindication of Religion" in Essays, Catholic and Critical-as successful in establishing the conclusion that "the realm of nature is not the whole of Reality, that the existence of nature being contingent existence is dependent upon a mode of Being that is not contingent but necessary." Yet, since in itself it "throws no light upon the character of this absolutely necessary Being, it prepares the way for theism, but does not, in itself, entitle us to assert that the self-explanatory ground of nature is a conscious Mind or Personality." This can, however, be made probable by the Teleological Argument, which is not merely speculative, but takes as its starting point the examination of "the various facts and aspects of nature, inclusive of man, that fall within the sphere of our obser- vation, and by detecting, if we can, the indications they afford of the kind of reality upon which they depend." Finally, the argument from the beauty discovered in nature (and in this connection Professor Dawes Hicks's reference to Mr. Shebbeare's striking and too little known treatment of this subject is to be noted) and the argument from the character of our moral ideals are shown to support the conclusion to which the "adaptations" in nature were found to point. Professor Dawes Hicks's treatment of these themes, while following, as has already been said, familiar lines, is forcible and persuasive. But the examination of religious experience, which occupies the third and fourth Lectures, is less satisfactory. Much that is valuable is, indeed, to be found there. I would instance the decided refusal to depreciate or minimize the part played by reason in religion; the endorsement of Cook Wilson's insistence on the importance of the sentiment of reverence as the distinctively religious emotion (though perhaps less weight is given than it deserves to the Oxford philosopher's argument thence to the validity of the conception which it implies); and the account of the relation of "faith" and "knowledge." But it is difficult not to feel that the problem of religious experience is unduly simplified for our author by his obvious lack of sympathy with the mystical type of religion. One may indeed agree with him that the "immediacy" of certain experiences is sometimes dwelt upon without sufficient discrimination of an "immediacy" which is above and an "immediacy" which is below the level of rational mediation; or again that some writers are apt to confound under the same name of "mystical" widely different types of religious experience to some of which the name is very doubtfully applicable. But one may notwithstanding suspect that the turn of mind which leads Pro- fessor Dawes Hicks to treat as meaningless any language which speaks of the relation of our spirit to the Divine Spirit in terms other than those of such mutual impenetrability as exists between two finite spirits allows him to be too content to regard such terms as wholly adequate to express even the latter relation. So, too, the concluding Lecture of the course, which deals with the contrast of Pantheism and Theism, would be more valuable if it evinced a fuller recog- nition of the truth (for such it seems to the present writer) that it is not merely philosophical theory but religious experience itself that leads to dissatisfaction with a "theism" so well satisfied with this doctrine of mutual exclusion that it is never beset by the temptation to pass the line dividing it from "pantheism." On p. 45, 1. i, for "lonely" read "lowly." At the bottom of p. I48 quotation marks should be substituted for brackets. In reading p. 89 one wonders who ever held the "ecclesiastical doctrine" of the "final authority" of the Thirty- nine Articles. C. C. J. WEBB. 487</page></plain_text>
