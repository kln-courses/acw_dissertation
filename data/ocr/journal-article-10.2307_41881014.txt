Already in the first decades of our century, it was suggested, also making use of ethnographic data, that motifs painted on Susa pottery could have been a kind of primitive writing (POTHER 1932). More outspokenly, a thorough analysis of prehistoric Southeast Europe Vinça signs (Vth mill. b.C.), found on different media: pottery, seals, figurines etc. considered the possibility of a true pre-writing graphic system (WlNN 1981)2. For the Near Eastern prehistory, the studies on tokens have definitely ascertained that there is a continuous thread of symbols and meanings linking some patterns on prehistoric tokens and early historic pictographs employed in writing (Schmandt-Besserat 1992). Tracing to historical signs the meaning of pottery motifs is much less easy&gt; insofar as they are much more complex, and, apart from the potters' marks, they generally do not occur isolated, and do not seem thus intimately connected with administration, as the tokens are. The potter's marks themselves (BERNBECK 1994, 268-275, abb. 35), which have been considered as one possible origin for writing, give us a very scanty and discontinuous evidence, suggesting the transmission of their tradition through perishable, undetectable media (JASIM and Oates 1986, 355, 357). However there is no doubt that the pottery motifs characterised their areas of expansion as well as a language, and it seems necessary a more careful study in this direction, following the path shown by the token studies. An intere- sting paper concerned with the birth of the cuneiform «star» motif (the sign for god), from the spirit of the rosette (MOORTGAT-CORRENS 1994) analysed the long history of what is indeed a typically Halafian pattern, found also on Samarran pot- tery. Quite useful seems the study of imageries painted on exceptional vessels, 1 Some drawings presented here have been drawn by me, after the illustrations appeared on Sumer, also thanks to unpublished information I was able to collect, in autumn 1994, in a thorough study of the Arabic Files on Tell es-Sawwan, in the Baghdad Museum. My gratitude goes to Dr. M.S. Damerji, Director General of Antiquities, who gave me permission to study of the files, and to the Iraqi archaeologists who excavated the site and helped me. 2 A comparative analysis of Samarran and Vinça signs and effigy vases is very intriguing: I hope to publish soon a paper on this subject.</page><page sequence="2">2 Fiorella Ippolitoni Strika [2] which deserved special social or religious meaning/function at their age. I recently suggested, while reconsidering a funerary Halafian (end sixth mill. b.C.) painted bowl, that we could almost read its unique designs, connecting e.g. the hunter and the men-with vase themes, and the bucrania, the Maltese crosses, and certainly the «fringed square» motifs, with early Sumerian pictographs, possibly with the same value of stylised records of objects and activities, and related with the lifetime events of the deceased, whose skull was buried inside the vessel (IPPOLITONI Strika 1996, 26). Also on Samarran (second half of the sixth mill. b.C.) pottery, at least the potters' marks should be considered as a primitive and - insofar as they are com- paratively few - elitarian effort to record an idea (see for Sawwan: IPPOLITONI 1970-71, pl. Y; and for Samarra: HERZFELD 1930, Abb. 222). The prehistoric pot- ter's marks from the Susiana (fifth mill. b.C.) are also relatively few, and may be connected with the Samarran ones: it has been suggested that they do not repre- sent a «degré moins un», but a stage «moins deux ou moins trois» of writing, while offering a repertoire of shapes apt for symbolising the language (DOLLFUS et Encrevé 1982, 114). The much later potter's marks from Tepe Yahya (3000 B.C. onwards) have been connected with Proto-Elamite and Harappan script (POTTS 1981, fig. 4, Parpóla 1986). I would here draw attention on a peculiar «W»-like pattern, which is not apparently a potter's mark, found both on clay anthropomorphic vases and on sealings at Sawwan and elsewhere, insofar as it gives perhaps an example of how a pictographic sign may have developed a specific meaning, certainly related to the idea of a liquid, and which is apparently diffused over a wide area. The occurren- ce of this sign on different media seems thus important on comparative purposes. In a recent paper (IPPOLITONI Strika 1998), while pointing out several items linking Sawwan, and its stone statuettes to the earlier aceramic cultures of the Syrian sites of Bouqras and El Khoum, I underlined as well the intriguing occur- rence at Sabi Abyad, in a level which is culturally and chronologically comparable with Sawwan, of sealings with human representations (DuiSTERMAAT 1996, fig. 5.6; 5.17) which recall typologically the Sawwan stone statuettes (pl. 3.13). That seemed to me particularly meaningful, insofar as in my analysis of the Sawwan stone statuettes I had the feeling that at least some of them, especially the seated seal-like ones could have been used as a sealing device (IPPOLITONI STRIKA 1976 pl. XXIII, 26d). Indeed another interface human-figure-sealing may be given by the occurrence of the W- shaped pattern: 1) It is painted, with some variations, on clay anthropomorphic figures and vases from Sawwan and Choga Mami, mainly under the nose but also on the shoulders, under the neck, under breasts (pls. l-2a); 2) It finds analogies in Samarran painted potters' marks and is incised on a Samarran bowl from Sawwan and on a sherd from Serik (pl. 3. 1-10).</page><page sequence="3">[3] Pre-writing at Tell es-Sawwan 3 3) A very similar pattern occurs on an incised sealing from Sawwan and on sealings from Sabi Abyad, also within a multiple sealed shape, which echoes in outline a fragmentary human figure (pl. 3, 11-12 ). How to interpret this evidence? In a recent note I underlined the possibility that a peculiar t-shaped sign which marks the mouth of the female vase from Has- suna, could be interpreted as a hint to liquid-pouring, with several similar occur- rences from far away prehistoric sites, practically at least from Mesopotamia to Hungary, thus suggesting some odd East-West convergence on the idea of a fema- le goddess pouring something from her mouth (IPPOLITONI Strika 1992) (pl. 2b). At Sawwan itself the mouth is marked both in the T-shape Hassuna guise and, more commonly, as an opened or closed W-shape, sometimes marginated by che- vrons (these last echoing in some way the pattern of pendant triangles and multi- ple waves which is often painted inside the rim of Samarran pottery). Could it be that the sign was meant to signify water or a special liquid of some kind, preser- ved inside the vases bearing such a distinctive mark?: that would be particularly interesting in the case of the Sabi Abyad sealings, which were demonstrably employed for storage purposes. Of course it is just intuitive and not surprising that undulating parallel lines are employed to mean «water» both in early Egyp- tian and Mesopotamian pictograms. The whole thing should be as well envisaged under the light of what has been suggested for the tokens signs as pre-writing devices, and we should also carefully reflect on the hypotheses elaborated for more western assemblages with rich sign repertoire, such as Vinça cultures. The fact that similar W-like signs occur isolated as potters' marks on Samarra pottery, both painted, which is more typical, and incised, which is more in the Iranian tra- dition, is also important, since it may have conveyed a similar meaning, and that possibility could take us to attempt similar analyses for some «historically» impor- tant symbols, such as the Swastika, which occurs again both painted as a potter's mark on Samarra pottery and on chalcolithic figurines from Arpachiyah and Tall i-Bakun A. Of course, as it often happens in prehistory, this hint at a certain meaning of a few pictograms, is just «a drop in an ocean» of possibilities and hypothetical meanings, but we must realise that any identifiable complex of painted pottery motifs must have characterised not only areas but also peoples (Vertesalji 1984), as well as the colour of the eyes, or the language. Depicting reality is one way of mastering it and may result in very different choices. In the case of the W-like sign we could suggest that, as well as the swastika, it may have been spelt differently according to the different places in which it was employed, but with a similar meaning. It is a well known phenomenon in primitive societies of today the tre- mendous speed in overcoming the old incredible richness of languages, including specialised dialects e.g. for ritual use, in favour of poorer, homologated ones. We should start to work on the prehistoric painted patterns, as we do for indeciphera-</page><page sequence="4">4 Fiorella Ippolitoni Strika [4] ble writings which lack a bilingual inscription, and a rich enough literature, e.g. the Indus script: we should start pointing out the occurrences, the convergence among witnesses from different sites and ages, abutting, where possible, to the first historically documented signs of known writings, always trying to add some elements to the puzzle. In fact I hope that this short note is understood not only as aimed at pointing out an early occurrence of a pictogram or ideogram, and not so much for the reasonable possibility that some kind of meaning can be sugge- sted for it, but mainly as an expression of my feeling that the whole cultural outlook of Sawwan is that of a prehistoric site which aims at history: the proto- Sumerian, stereometric character of its stone statuettes, the early employ of sea- lings, the rationalised architecture, the evidence of some kind of ranking, all these main features of Sawwan, and the demonstrable continuity at the southern Tell Oueili, point at showing us that whoever the Sumerian were, and wherever they came from, the Mesopotamian area, long before their civilisation developed, was already pregnant of all the main premises for their achievements.
