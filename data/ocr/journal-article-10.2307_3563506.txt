Yet we as individuals, as pro- fessionals, and as a society are unclear about the nature or value of these combinations. We can resort to meta- phor naturally to describe technology- dependent children and their fami- lies because it is most often by meta- phor-by common culturally held images and stories-that we collec- tively understand the new and per- plexing,' especially when it forces new visions of things so important and universal as children and life it- self. Children connected to ventilators evoke the image of chimeric crea- tures: they are a combination of two different species. I contend that it is this combination of two historically unrelated conceptual domains-the human and the mechanical-that perplexes us and confuses our senses of identity and value of these human- machine hybrids. The Chimera of myth was a fearful monster breathing fire, with the head of a lion, the body of a goat, and the tail of a dragon. Visualize for a mo- ment a child: a quadriplegic, venti- lator-dependent child ... head of the lion, the (partially or completely use- less) body of the goat, and--the tail of the dragon-the real technologi- cal tether, the tubes connecting the Chimeras and Odysseys Toward Understanding the Technology-Dependent Child by Arthur E Kohrman child to the ventilator and its alarm devices, emitting "infernal fire." Anyone who has tried to replace a tracheotomy tube in a struggling child who is totally dependent on a ventilator can identify all the ele- ments. It is truly terrifying to see the child struggle as the seconds of breathlessness pass while the care- taker desperately but meticulously tries to insert a tube into a secretion- filled trachea-the "gaping throat." We really have no clear image of who or what a technology-dependent child is, or who we are as profession- als caring for them. Like the Chimera, the new beings, humans attached to and dependent upon machines, have created disarray in our ways of thinking. And like lobates, whose kingdom the Chimera terrorized, we are seeking a decisive and heroic way to contain that confusion. We, both professionals and public, seek to rec- ognize and categorize the novel and unfamiliar; indeed, the very art of medical diagnosis is the recognition of groups of similar or related find- ings. We don't really know yet what prior experiences technology-depen- dent people best match or what group to put them into. We seek con- ceptualizations and meanings for a novel category of persons. It is difficult to construct an ethi- cal system for something or someone for which or whom we don't under- stand the meaning or value. Until we have a clearer idea of what technology- dependent people are and what they mean to us collectively and as pro- fessionals, we will be unable to answer clearly even the basic operational questions that arise in and from their care and presence. Is a technology-dependent child a child connected to a machine, with all the endearing, dependent, hope- ful characteristics of childhood? For most of us this is the most compelling view. But that view is constantly strained by the necessity to tend to the machine, lest the child perish. Thus we often find ourselves behav- ing as if the beast before us were a machine to which a child is affixed. If the machine and its performance are the critical focus of concern, a device originally used as a means becomes an end in itself. Is the child-machine combination a being in its own right, or just a stage in a medically engineered metamor- phosis-a cocoon from which we wait hopefully for the real, intact child to emerge? Or is it an arrested meta- morphosis, from which the child can go neither forward nor backward, but which commands endless attention in some sort of ensnaring connection with those who must watch and care for it? At various times and phases in the journey of each child toward in- dependence from the technology, if that is to be achieved, the technology- dependent child is all of these. Each of the conceptualizations sets unique challenges, raises unique fears, and demands unique responses, which evolve with the changing condition of the child. Some of the most important tasks of development in children are those of distinguishing self from others and achieving independence. How do we (and the child) understand the boundaries of self in a child who is connected to a machine?

S4</page><page sequence="2">SPECIAL SUPPLEMENT Hastings Center Report, September-October 1994 survival itself on that machine, when the common benchmarks for those qualities have to do with increasing independence and autonomy? What are the anthropomorphic concepts of the machine held by the child, and by those who help him or her? Think about the very popular toys called "transformers," toys that a child can turn from machines into human figures and back again. I wonder how a child connected to a machine sees him or herself in that transformation. Does the child see the machine as part of her or his body? Does the machine overpower the child, or alternatively, might it give the child a greater sense of worth or singularity: "Hey, look at me!" Clearly, for each child the answers to these questions will be unique, as the devel- opmental pathway and the unfolding sense of self is unique for all children. Yet we are puzzled about the reason- able expectations for development, discipline, and progress. And what of those whose lives, by choice or circumstance, are them- selves tethered to the child-machine? Are they servants, slaves, or angels-- are they cursed or blessed? One of the accomplishments of successful parenting is facilitating the separa- tion of the child; but for these chil- dren separation may mean death. We all become very concerned when one of our children is hurt or ill, and we work to reestablish both for the child and for o urselves the sense of the child's wholeness after the illness or injury is over. How do parents find that wholeness and re- covery when their child is per- manently hooked up to a machine whose failure or malfunction can bring injury or death? So many acts of everyday life are important to a child, like being held. But what is it like to hold a child on a ventilator, listening to the damnable thing wheezing twenty-four hours a day, with the end- less rattle of secretions in the child's tracheotomy? Such an experience is hardly one of the ordinary anticipa- tions of child rearing. Our society is highly dependent on machines and technology, as indeed are most of us individually. Yet we don't usually consider our beepers, or fax machines, or telephones exten- sions of our bodies. However much we may joke about not being able to live without them, we know that our dependence is a chosen one. But there is no such choice for adults or children for whom technology liter- ally is life sustaining. How do our jokes and conversation feel to them and those who care for them? Can parents of a ventilator-dependent child joke in quite the same way about, say, a 40,000-breath checkup-- and is that a checkup for the child, or the machine that breathes for her? We must grapple with these de- scriptive questions because we cannot make rational individual or collective social judgments about what we can- not describe; and we cannot con- struct a moral and political frame- work for something whose value and meaning we don't know. Children who are technology dependent and their caretakers are torn between competing and confusing forces and constructs. The challenges to success- ful development of an intact child are formidable enough; the con- flicts, uncertainties, and tensions be- tween dependence and growing in- dependence are daunting. In addi- tion to the uncertainties of effective child rearing, parents of technology- dependent children are also caught in the web of conflicts among their commitments and moral reason and the political and social realities of the worlds they live in. The differences between what is and what ought to be are a life theme for these children and families. Much of what we prize as a culture is inimical to technology-dependent children. They will not receive praise for their beauty, nor will they have the physical and social mobility that al- lows others to compete, to forge inde- pendent lives. The culture of medical care may be little more hospitable. Medical professionals reflect in their behaviors their preference for cure, for brief encounters with clear out- comes, and for evident, progressive improvement by the patient. Profes- sionals reward self-help and tend to think less of those who do not appear to be struggling to get better. We believe that anybody who really wants to get better will (and can) work in her own behalf to do so. The unwrit- ten text is that if sick or disabled people don't get better, it is because they don't try hard enough. We tend to use the term value in several different and often problem- atic senses in speaking of depen- dence on medical technologies, in ways that can make it difficult to dis- entangle the economic cost of ma- chines from the moral worth of the persons who depend on them. And we must also ask whether, and in what way, technology-dependent people are important to us as symbols. As a nation, we have made a massive com- mitment to the elderly in the form of Medicare. We have no comparable commitment to our children. Are technology-dependent children the most dependent, the most compel- ling symbols for the plight of all chil- dren in our society? The elderly are not simply icons, and I suspect that these children are not just icons either. Technical descriptions of devices and their use, the recitations of the joys and burdens of caring for tech- nology-dependent people, or even being one of them, are by themselves insufficient to bring us, as individuals and as a society, to realization of the meaning of this truly new creature made up of humans and machines intertwined and interdependent in so many ways. If the person-machine combina- tion can be understood in part as a modern-day Chimera, and some of our reactions to it revealed through our reading of myth, it may be simi- larly useful to look into other allego- ries and metaphors. Is the child sup- ported by a ventilator not really also like another of the mythical creatures, the Sphinx, offspring of Chimera, with its woman's head, bird's wings and claws, and lion's body? The riddle of the Sphinx--what animal has four feet in the morning, two at noon, and three at night?-is a riddle for the child's caretakers as well. Oedipus solved the riddle, recogniz- ing that each stage represented a step in the progress of humans through life: four-legged at infancy, two-legged in adulthood, three-legged (with a cane) in old age. Children dependent upon technologies similarly present to their parents an enigma, a riddle that must be solved so that both can exist. And like the riddle of the S5</page><page sequence="3">SPECIAL SUPPLEMENT Hastings Center Report, September-October 1994 Sphinx, the answer and the triumph lie in understanding development and growth in unfamiliar terms. Another figure in mythology made up of parts of two species is the cen- taur. Unlike other such creatures, the centaur held favored status among both gods and men. One centaur in particular, the wise and learned Chiron, stands out. It was Chiron, known for his great healing powers and knowledge of medicine, who educated both Hercules and Jason. Thus, this gentle man-beast both in- troduced his pupils to knowledge and launched each of them on daring, challenging, extraordinary, and he- roic life-defining journeys-Hercules to his daunting and exceptional tasks, Jason to his pursuit of the Golden Fleece. How much this is like the child-machine, challenging parents and caretakers in an odyssey of un- imagined tasks and journeys and re- wards, and in the process, elevating them to the ranks of heroes! A recurrent and pervasive strain in all myth is the interpretation of powerful events and forces as the counterpoint of love and war. Caring for a person who is technology de- pendent is a modern enactment of these same themes. The love of a parent or companion is constantly tested in the many battles of the home care experience. This is a brave new world of chal- lenge to those whose lives are bound to technology, their families and care- takers and companions, and those who launch them upon their jour- neys. Will this new world produce new mythical figures for future gen- erations to study and revere? The con- text is new, the questions very old.
