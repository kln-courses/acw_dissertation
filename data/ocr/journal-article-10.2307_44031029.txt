<plain_text><page sequence="1">Barbara Cohen, J. Hillis Miller, Andrzej War miński and Tom Cohen, eds, Material Events: Paul de Man and the Afterlife of Theory (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2000) Stephen Jarvis Material Events: Paul de Man and the Afterlife of Theory is a collection of papers most of which were delivered to a conference at the Uni- versity of California-Davis in April 1998. The conference was titled 'Culture and Materiality: A Post-millenarian Conference - à propos of Paul de Man's Aesthetic Ideology - to consider trajectories for "materialist" thought in the afterlife of theory, cultural studies, and Marxist critique'. Jacques Derrida declares this title to be 'a master- piece' and the editors' introduction describes it as 'a deliberately open, challenging, and paradoxical formulation'. The editors have assembled a stellar cast which in itself recommends the volume: Andrzej Warminski, Michael Sprinker, Arkady Plotnitsky, T.J. Clark, Tom Cohen, Laurence Rickels, J. Hillis Miller, Barbara Johnson, Ernesto Laclau, Judith Butler and Jacques Derrida. They were asked 'to respond in one way or another to what is perhaps the most enigmatic word in Aesthetic Ideology, "materiality"'. Hillis Miller's 'Paul de Man as Allergen: Why Reading de Man Makes You Sneeze' is an admirable attempt to confront this difficulty head on and offers an account of three types of materiality found in de Man's writing. These could be very provisionally sketched as the materiality of history which is generated by speech acts and has nothing to do with tem- porality; the materiality of what the eye sees which is opposed to phenomenality, a material vision of what the eye sees but not the mind, a pre-seeing seeing; and the prosaic materiality of the letter which is similar to the materialism of vision except that it works as a disarticulation of language. The publication of Material Events is undoubtedly some sort of event, and one which inevitably leads to the question of whether there is to be a resumption of work on de Man after the interruption of his 'two deaths', or whether this collection represents a one-off. The editors' introduction is at pains to locate this work on de Man within</page><page sequence="2">182 Oxford Literary Review a current critical landscape concerned with all things technological and post-human, apparently 'a time undergoing the transformations of the electronic archive and political and terrestrial impasses con- cerned with anything but textual reading (eco-terrestrial catastrophes, the homogenizations dictated by global capital, resurgent genocidal side-bars, the "University in ruins")'. The project undertaken here has therefore to contend with at least two significant obstacles: the difficulty of de Man's thinking of 'materiality' and the place such work might occupy today when de Man's 'abjection' continues to mark 'an exceptional episode and lingers as a sort of black hole, numbness, or effaced trauma within literary and critical studies in America'. Clearly the editors' introduction was, as these things usually are, written after the event. It is marked by a certain post facto caution and defensiveness. This is understandable in view of de Man's current status and the violent, 'allergenic' reaction his work and reputation often provoke. Such defensiveness might also be attributable to the necessary unpredictability of an event such as a conference and the subsequent publication of a collection of conference papers, which can sometimes result, as it does here, in a wayward and eccentric end product. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it does raise questions about faithful or unfaithful interpretations and responsibility. The editors' introduction attempts to tackle this issue: Just as a careful reader must conclude that de Man twisted the word 'materiality', anasemically, in a per- formative speech act, to name something different from the legacy of its previous meanings and uses, that is, to name, in Derrida's formulation, a 'mecha- nistic materiality without materialism and even perhaps without matter', so each contributor to this volume has appropriated de Man's work in his or her own way, in an active intervention, or performative reading that cannot be fully justified in the straight line of a verifiable cognitive, hermeneutic interpretation. This would seem to imply that a wayward reading of de Man on materiality would in itself be something of a de Manían gesture, hence</page><page sequence="3">Review 183 faithful in its infidelity. It is doubtless, though, not a question of choosing either fidelity or infidelity, responsibility or irresponsibility, but of somehow maintaining an (impossible and possibly intolerable) experience of both, or between both. These are difficult questions which by their very nature do not presuppose the possibility of an answer; they are also, of course, central to Derrida's readings of de Man in Mémoires for Paul de Man and 'Psyche: Inventions of the Other'. Material Events is considerably enriched by Derrida's latest addition to this series, a lengthy and lucid continuation of a dialogue with de Man around Rousseau, confession, perjury, excuse and guilt. An impression gained from some of the other contributions to this volume is that the price to be paid for reading de Man now, for bringing his work into today's light, is a simultaneous loss of clarity and (once again) an occlusion. This collection alone will not convert a new generation of readers to Paul de Man, it is too disparate and inconsistent and therefore should be approached only after the afore- mentioned texts by Derrida and Rodolphe Gasché's The Wild Card of Reading, each of which includes patient exposition and attempts to engage with the consistency of de Man's thought while remaining vigilant to the perils of totalization. It is also necessary, of course, to have read de Man, particularly Aesthetic Ideology, and there are many indispensable things in the collections Reading de Man Reading and Responses: On Paul de Man's Wartime Journalism. Once all this has been taken on board the reader should be in a position to make an informed judgement about the import of Material Events, which is more or less what the editors' introduction advises: Since each of the essays in this volume is exigent, sui generis, and complex, even what each says directly or indirectly about de Manían 'materiality' cannot be adequately encapsulated in a sentence or two. Much less can that be done with the whole argument of any of these essays. These introductory notes are an in- vitation to you, dear reader, to read each essay for yourself and to decide for yourself its import. It is also for us dear readers to decide whether this is an abnegation of the editorial task in the face of insurmountable difficulties and</page><page sequence="4">184 Oxford Literary Review inconsistencies or a suitably equanimous moment which is the only adequate response to the singular diversity of these essays. The com- plexity and diversity is such that it would be pointless here to try to rehearse the detail of these relatively independent essays. This review will therefore slip uneasily into the task of raising some preliminary and perhaps marginal or random points, and conclude with a not entirely unmotivated rumination on de Man and science fiction. Some of these essays read de Man closely, while others take greater liberties which contribute to a sense of de Man's occlusion. This is partly an inevitable consequence of trying to revive interest in de Man's late work at this time, in that life and work continue and much of the work here would have been done anyway with or without the pretext of a conference on de Man. It is possible to ask the prelimi- nary question of what happens to de Man in Laurence Rickels's essay 'Resistance in Theory'. One of the starting points of Rickels's essay is the materiality of the transference dynamic in psychoanalysis, and he proceeds to map this onto de Man's text. His gesture is that of replacing 'literary theory' with 'psychoanalysis' in 'The Resistance to Theory': De Man's foreclosure or, if one prefers, bracketing out of psychoanalysis is legend. But that legend be- came legible in another sense with his resistance ad- dress. There are indeed moments in the essay where all you would need to do is replace the subject of de Man's sentences with "psychoanalysis" and an ex- traordinary compatibility suddenly seems to emerge, but from another place, deep down between the lines. What happens to de Man here is that his text is imposed upon and occluded, that something called 'psychoanalysis' is granted an ex- orbitant authority to reconfigure de Man's text in a way that enables Rickels to proceed. There is a similar moment early in T.J. Clark's 'Phenomenality and Materiality in Cézanne' which quotes de Man's discussion in 'Hypogram and Inscription' of 'the undoing of cog- nition and its replacement by the uncontrollable power of the letter as inscription'. Clark then asks: 'Is this a power - for "letter" in the last sentence we would have to substitute something like "brushmark" -</page><page sequence="5">Review 185 Cezanne's painting acknowledges? Probably yes.' Is this what de Man had in mind when he talked about the materiality of the letter? Probably not. Andrzej Warminski's exemplary and careful reading in '"As the poets do it": On the Material Sublime' can be cited to give some indication of why Clark's gesture might be problematic: Clearly enough, the 'materiality' of the infra-text, or the hypogram, or of what de Man calls the 'prosaic materiality of the letter' or 'material inscription' (or, for that matter, 'the materiality of actual history') is not accessible in phenomenal experience and what appears in empirical space and time. Materiality - or the infra-text or hypogram or the letter or the inscription or actual history or the prosaic language power of the poets - is not something we are going to put our finger on. For 'finger' in the last sentence we would have to substitute some- thing like 'brush'. These difficult questions concerning a fidelity or a faithful infidelity to de Man's text can also be raised in connection with other dis- courses. What is occurring in Laurence Rickels's essay when he refers to the materiality, the pragmatic moment of the in-session trans- ferential dynamic? Similarly, it is possible to ask whether Barbara Johnson's essay here fully accounts for what it is that the law is actually trying to do. In 'Anthropomorphism in Lyric and the Law' Johnson reads de Man's remarkable late essay 'Anthropomorphism and Trope in the Lyric', and sets this reading against the judgment of the US Supreme Court in the case of Rowland v. California Men s Colony (1993). The case was brought by a prisoners' association which was suing the prison governor for the right to have free cigarette privileges restored. It turns on the construction of a statutory provi- sion which allows 'persons' who can demonstrate poverty to sue without prepayment of court fees and legal costs. The key question is whether in this context the meaning of 'person' extends to artificial entities such as associations and corporate bodies or whether it is restricted to 'natural' individuals. What concerns Johnson here is that 'lyric and law might be seen as two very different ways of instating</page><page sequence="6">186 Oxford Literary Review what a "person" is'. She takes de Man's point that anthropomorphism in the lyric is epistemologically resolved rather than a pure rhetorical structure (the human is a given) and concludes that the law needs something like the definition of the human provided by lyric poetry so that it can then proceed to 'empty' that definition by its rhetorical application to artificial entities such as corporations. Johnson's read- ing would seem to presuppose that the law to some degree conflates the legal concept of a 'person' with the human, whereas the law is not interested in defining the essence of a 'person'; although, as Johnson points out, developments in biogenetics and the implications for patent law, for example, might problematize the legal meaning of 'human'. The law, however, is not confused about the distinction between 'person' and 'human'; this is clearly illustrated by the fact that it allows a corporate body, because it is recognised as a legal 'person', to do things such as own property and enter contracts which it denies to a human child. An artificial entity such as a company is recognised by the law as a legal 'person' in so far as it has the same legal rights as a 'natural' person. Barbara Johnson contends that interesting questions arise from the conjunction of the lyric and the law concern- ing the definition of the 'human' and the blurring between artificial entities and natural beings, and between epistemology and rhetoric. But she fails fully to acknowledge that the law recognises that the notion of a 'person' is itself an artificial concept. Indeed both judgments in the case, although they come to opposite conclusions about the meaning of 'person' in the particular statutory context, indicate the conceptual nature of the term 'person' by repeatedly placing it within inverted commas, which suggests the question of whether Johnson's reading fully accounts for the specificity of legal usage. Given that it has been impossible here to do much other than indicate some of the complexity of Material Events , this review will conclude by sketching some connections between this collection, Paul de Man, and science fiction. This will be, if nothing else, to emphasise that it is to be hoped that Material Events and Paul de Man's work itself will be read in the future. These remarks concern science fiction, a discourse often concerned with technology and the future, and cinema, a medium which all too often these days appears as if it has had its day. It might also be useful to recall at this point Paul de</page><page sequence="7">Review 187 Man's remarks written in January 1983 for the revised edition of Blindness and Insight : I am not given to retrospective self-examination and mercifully forget what I have written with the same alacrity I forget bad movies - although, as with bad movies, certain scenes or phrases return at times to embarrass and haunt me like a guilty conscience. Let us ignore the all-too-obvious 'irony' that was subsequently read into these remarks and concentrate instead on the idea of forgetting bad movies. Laurence Rickels is not about to forget (or allow readers of Material Events to forget) Contact , a truly bad movie featuring Jodie Foster and directed by Robert Zemeckis whose previous efforts include Forrest Gump (adding the possibility of confusion with an- other Jodie Foster picture NelĻ which David Letterman memorably dubbed Mrs Gump). Rickels pursues a number of strands linking de Man's taped lecture 'Kant and Schiller', Contact , recording technology, and 'the in-session dynamics of transference and resistance'. In the film aliens have supposedly (there is a subplot suggesting a hoax or conspiracy) con- tacted earth and sent plans for the construction of some sort of space ship which enables Jodie Foster's character Arroway to travel into the depths of outer space. Rickels's gloss is as follows: When she goes the longest distance ever gone before, the alien presence openly simulates a West Coast beach on which Arroway can be reunited with her father, because it just knew that this sensurround veiling their direct contact would be easier on her. It is the ultimate and ultimately fantastic gift of the trans- parent. When Arroway returns to earth, or to consciousness, all her tapes are filled with static and noise. The transparental encounter has left behind only static on the record of evidence of the senses. Two conspiracy theories take over - Roswell-style - where Arroway's consciousness left off for just the moment the tape of the launching</page><page sequence="8">188 Oxford Literary Review recorded. But the tapes she brings back record static for the full 18 hours she claims to have been away, way away. Neither tape seems admissible as truth. But we must work with what we have, with what is brought to the session. Arroway brings back from contact with dead or dad a record of static, white noise, the sound between radio stations, the snow between TV channels. Rickels then veers into the world of parapsychology, but there are also a number of routes leading back into Material Events itself. The key question in the film is whether Arroway went anywhere and whether she actually saw what she claims to have seen. If the tech- nology succeeded at all it also failed; if she did travel into space the recording technology failed to keep up, but equally the technology might have failed entirely and the whole episode was just Arroway's fantasy. Here the dubious ideology of the film kicks in and, faced with an incomprehensible technology (the aliens sent the plans and humans built a machine without yet understanding how it works or even whether it works) and Arroway's testimony, humanity is left with faith. It is also a blind faith in that the people of the world are asked to believe that something has been seen which they cannot see them- selves. There are several Contact-moments in Material Events. There is the conference poster, for example. Jacques Derrida writes: 'Each time I look at this poster, it makes me think of a "jeu de l'oie" [snakes and ladders] for a Californian science fiction.' The editors' intro- duction anticipates the problem of a reference to a poster which the reader cannot see by offering a description of its 'phantasmal hodge- podge of travel icons'. The poster is called 'Chariot' but it sounds like a riot: An airport runway at the card's bottom center leads the eye to an ancient shield inscribed with horse and chariot. At the card's center is a Roman bust, one of its eyes manifested as a hollow of flame, and head adorned with the victor's symbol of the laurel wreath. Around the perimeter are a mélange of travel/trans- portation images: rocket ship; hot air balloon; moon landing shuttle; falcon poised for flight; super high- way; and the diaphanous figure of a surfer, while the</page><page sequence="9">Review 189 card's extreme left reveals a contemporary male face reflected in a rearview mirror. The Contact motifs are all in place here: the rocket ship, the West Coast beach, and the description of an event which does not have to be seen to be believed. There are similar moments in T.J. Clark's 'Phenomenality and Materiality in Cézanne' which describes specific paintings at length. The following example outlines a unique experi- ence, accessible only to T.J. Clark: Let me start with the picture 'Mont Sainte-Victoire seen from Chateau Noir', now in the Edsel and Eleanor Ford House museum (Color Plate 1). The painting was probably done not long before Cezanne died - maybe as late as 1904. Most of the things I shall say about it are true only if lighting conditions are good. In most reproductions the picture's blues are too glossy, or else too grayed and sullen. But given steady north daylight (here I am guessing), or under a rea- sonably sympathetic mixture of tungsten and neon (which is how the picture was shown to me), color and texture, and color and stroke-size, work on each other to aereate - almost levitate - the whole thing. The blues are translucent, floating into and over the answering parallelograms of green. The description continues in this vein, much like Arroway's des- criptions of a world she alone has seen, which was set up specifically for her. There might also be something that could be said here about elitism, particularly as this is also an issue which Clark raises: 'The word "Bloomsbury" is my least favorite in the language.' Other Contact- moments concern time, the difference between the seconds perceived by those at mission control and the eighteen hours Arroway claims she was away, and the difficulty of establishing what, if anything, took place when and where. Wlad Godzich announces in the introduction to The Resistance to Theory (1986) that Aesthetic Ideology is 'to be published shortly' whereas this publication took a further ten years. Judith Butler's 'How Can I Deny that These Hands and This Body Are Mine' in Material Events has the following</page><page sequence="10">190 Oxford Literary Review footnote: 'This essay was first presented as an invited lecture at the American Philosophical Association Meetings in December, 1987 in Philadelphia. It was represented in revised version for the "Culture and Materiality" conference at UC-Davis in April, 1998, and has subsequently been revised for publication in Qui Parle .' This footnote is attached to the title, and then the essay itself begins with the following: 'I remember a sleepless night last year when I came into my living room and turned on the television set to discover that C-Span was offering a special session on feminist topics...' The first question which might be pursued through the Cartesian problems addressed in Butler's essay would be: when did this 'sleepless night last year' take place? It is tempting to end this diversion into the world of cinematic science fiction with a contrivance such as de Man Who Fell to Earth , particularly as this would allude to a film which contains abyssal references to Auden's 'Musée des Beaux Arts' and Brueghel's 'Icarus', and create the opportunity to quote 'The Old Masters: how well they understood' out of context. Perhaps this would be timely when there seems to be at the present a precipitous rush to embrace the future as if this were simply a question of referring to William Gibson or the post-human, and learning how to switch on a computer. Let us in- stead, though, consider a de Man who has fallen from earth, and hope that de Man would not disapprove of the suggestion that Wordsworth might have something to tell us about the future, that he might have already written the future that we imagine. Here is Paul de Man reading Wordsworth in 'Phenomenality and Materiality in Kant': [Wordsworth,] in the nest-robbing episode in The Prelude , evoked the experience of dizziness and abso- lute fright in the amazing lines: 'The sky was not a sky/ Of earth, and with what motion moved the clouds!' Here, too, the sky is originally conceived as a roof or vault that shelters us, by anchoring us in the world, standing on a horizontal plane, under the sky, reassuringly stabilized by the weight of our own grav- ity. But, if the sky suddenly separates from the earth and is no longer, in Wordsworth's terms, a sky of earth, we lose all feeling of stability and start to fall, so to speak, skyward, away from gravity.</page></plain_text>
