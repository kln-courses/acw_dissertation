<plain_text><page sequence="1">CLAUDIO FOGU II Duce taumaturgo: Modernist Rhetorics in Fascist Representations of History Of Museums, Archives, and Thaumaturgic Representation IN AN ARTICLE ENTITLED "I musei del dolore," published in 1920, Antonio Monti, a young employee of the historical museum of the Risorgimento in Milan, recalled the "uneasiness" of a tramful of Milanese passengers when a veteran boarded the car: his face had been disfigured and he walked on a wooden leg. Over and against "bourgeois indifference and denial," Monti advocated the creation of a national museum commemorating "the sufferings of the recent war" and documenting the "devastating effects" of all wars "on man's physical body, his intelligence and moral faculties, the natural environment, places and things."' Although Monti's early plea for a museo del dolore (museum of war sufferings) went unanswered, in 1924 he successfully founded a World War I archive in Milan. Recalling in 1930 the origins of this archive, he recycled the episode of the dis- figured veteran, this time as the grateful recipient of Benito Mussolini's "loving caress" during the Duce's first visit to Milan in 1923: "that caress generously be- stowed by Mussolini upon the Milanese veteran . .. led to the opening of the War Archive."2 Monti's reuse of this image ten years later is a clue to the intellectual stakes of his dramatic political transformation from Catholic-pacifist to fascist. The trans- figuration of the war cripple from a victim of bourgeois hypocrisy and cowardice to an icon of Mussolini's thaumaturgy suggests the crucial motivation for Monti's endorsement of fascism as the historical pharmacon that could heal the psycho- logical wounds of the Great War. Monti's version of the origins of the War Archive recoded the curative purpose he had earlier envisaged for the musei del dolore. Unlike traditional historical museums, the War Archive was not meant to be "an assortment of weapons or a reconstruction of battle scenes," but rather a collection of unofficial documents illustrating how "Italy had been able to neutralize . .. the imposed and sanctioned violence of war by means of innumerable acts of com- passion and human solidarity."3 To tell the story of the War Archive-and that of 24 REPRESENTATIONS 57 * Winter 1997 ?) THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA</page><page sequence="2">its founder-is to probe the disturbing continuities between the modernization of historical representation and fascist recodings of history.4 When Antonio Monti joined the Museo del Risorgimento of Milan (MRM) in 1911, the museum did not have a catalog and was arranged in "picturesque and chaotic disorder."5 By the time he was appointed director of the museum in 1925, it was looked upon as the model for all other Risorgimento museums in Italy. By 1940 Monti was credited with completely transforming this old historical insti- tution (1884) into the first "modern" institute of contemporary history in Italy.6 The MRM, he wrote, having been a series of "personal shrines," had become "a scientific Institute aimed at providing the specialized means necessary for the study of the thought, the intellectual currents, and the spiritual movements cen- tered around the Risorgimento."7 All exhibition rooms had been restructured according to strict chronological criteria, and the library and archive had been thoroughly augmented, rationalized, and cataloged. What most distinguished Monti and the new MRM, however, was the foun- dation of the War Archive. Its original nucleus was a collector's gift, but between 1926 and 1930 Monti launched a competition among Italian students and teach- ers for the collection of war documents. Excluded were relics and "objects of any kind" that did not fit the archive's specific goal of documenting the grafomania (compulsive letter-writing) of Italian soldiers, "one of the chief characteristics of a war marked by long and enervating pauses."8 By 1930 the competition had produced a grand total of five hundred thousand filed and cataloged documents. According to Monti, this original initiative had fixed "definitively, and without possible equivocation, the nature and goals of the War Archive, which sought not to copy other historical archives and museums of [the Great] War already consti- tuted in Italy," but to do justice to the war as a "gigantic psychological fact."9 This "fact," asserted Monti, mattered not only in the lives of the men who fought but also in the lives of their sons and daughters.'0 In a lecture delivered in 1934 on its tenth anniversary, he claimed that the War Archive had achieved its goal "by means of its catalogs." For Monti, these catalogs represented an un- precedented "scientific" and intellectual operation. They were specifically aimed at attracting the peers of those "scholars and teachers who, during the war, had greatly contributed to the resistance and propaganda effort [with] a massive pro- duction of pamphlets, conferences, and posters."1' This claim defines the thaumaturgic tenor of Monti's whole enterprise. On the one hand, the chosen mode of collection had healed the children of the "lost generation." On the other hand, the archive's catalogs gave access to the psy- chological history of the war in order to mobilize Monti's intellectual peers by bearing witness to the patriotic militancy of wartime intellectuals.'2 To this end, Monti singled out the archive's "subject catalog," insisting on the headings per- Il Duce taumaturgo: Modernist Rhetorics in Fascist Representations of History 25</page><page sequence="3">taining to cultural activities supporting or produced by the war effort together with "psychological factors" pertaining to war conditions.'3 This catalog invited all scholars to conduct their "research on . . . the study of man in the living real- ity of war."'4 For its proud creator, then, the subject catalog represented a scien- tific achievement not only by giving coherence to a chaotic mass of documents but also by directing scholarly attention toward the war as a gigantic psychologi- cal fact. Beyond Neoidealist and Late-Romantic Paradigms Like all historians of his generation, Monti had to confront the unfold- ing drama of Italian neoidealism. Though united in their fin de sikcle effort to undermine positivism, the two champions of neoidealism, Benedetto Croce and Giovanni Gentile, had steadily grown apart since the first decade of the new cen- tury. Their political divorce in 1925 forced Italian historians and intellectuals to choose between Croce's antifascist and Gentile's fascist manifestos, but their philo- sophical paths had diverged long before.'5 In 1893 Croce was the main European spokesperson for a conception of his- toriography as "art" against both positivist and materialist claims. Although his "philosophy of the Spirit" had advanced the notion that historiography was ulti- mately to be identified with philosophy, he took care never to collapse one into the other. Fundamental to his position was a relentless stress on historiography as synthesis of aesthetics and logic, intuition and conceptual knowledge, a pragmatist rejection of any philosophy of history, and a Kantian commitment to rigorous conceptual distinctions.'6 The most attractive characteristic of his philosophy for practicing historians resided in his "ironic" philosophical reduction of art to his- toriography, of philosophy to history. 17 In a series of publications between 1899 (II concetto delta storia) and 1916 (Teoria generate dell'atto puro), Giovanni Gentile had progressively defined his position with exclusive reference to the spiritual unity of thought and reality, present and past, subject and object.'8 His own reduction of history to philosophy had gone in ex- actly the opposite direction of Croce's historicist distinctions. He proclaimed the circular unity of history and philosophy on the basis of a double reduction of phi- losophy to the history of (Italian) philosophy and of history to philosophy of history. Notwithstanding his apparent acceptance of Croce's identification of knowledge and reality, Gentile dismissed Croce's concern with defining the dis- tinctive character of historia rerum gestarum (historiography as synthesis of art and philosophy) and insisted on the "actualization" of history in the res gestae philoso- phorum (history as the unity of reality and the knowledge of reality in the philos- opher's act of self-consciousness). 26 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="4">While many historians under fascism accepted Gentile's "attualismo" as the philosophical expression of their political faith, they remained closet Croceans in conceiving of their historiographical practice as the elevation of intuition by thought. The situation in Monti's case was more complex because he was not only a well-known historian but also the director of the most innovative museum- archive of the Risorgimento and the Great War. Among the few things that Croce and Gentile had always agreed upon was the subordination of the first of the four phases of the so-called historical method, research, to the other three: criticism of sources, interpretation, and reconstruction. Gentile saw history in itself shining through the perfect identity of the sources (first stage) and the historian's recon- struction (fourth stage); Croce saw the collection of documents as being outside of the production of a history that consisted for him in the "a priori synthesis" of the other three phases.'9 Monti's "scientific" catalogs can be thus seen as an attempt to integrate the research process into the composite paradigm of neoidealism. In perfect Crocean fashion, Monti's historical judgment of the Great War as a "gi- gantic psychological fact" was reflected in the conceptual organization of the sub- ject catalog, which in its turn mediated between the documents and the intuition of the historian. And yet this aesthetic-conceptual synthesis allowed the four-step process to telescope along the transcendental lines of Gentile's actualism. This Gentilian aspect was emphasized by Monti in the second part of his public lecture. In order to demonstrate the usefulness of the subject catalog, he com- mented at length on the documents that a hypothetical scholar could consult un- der the heading "Wartime Religion" for a study of "the popular expression of religious sentiment and, in particular, of the southern soldier's cult of the Virgin Mary." He illustrated four types of documents (ex-votos, amulets, manuscripts, and images), all of them pointing to the soldiers' faith in the "thaumaturgic inter- vention of the Virgin." At the same time, he insisted that these documents, "col- lected by the archive, and there compulsively examined [compulsati], studied and cataloged, reacquired all their flavor and expressiveness." The subject categories offered scholars organic units together with an invitation to focus on the partic- ulars of each item-the "strangest" ex-votos shaped as coffins, the awkward "bu- reaucratic flavor" of certain dedications, even the contrast "between the fierce and ferocious look" assumed by some soldiers in group photographs and "the trusting humility of their requests." This presentation of the archive's subject catalog reveals Monti's articulated approach to the modernization of historical representation under fascism. On the one hand, it points to Catholicism as the mediating ideology behind his fusion of fascism and neoidealism into a thaumaturgy of historical representation. On the other hand, the very terminology used by Monti in describing archival documents as "flavorful" points beyond the identification of the Thaumaturgic Virgin with ii Duce to a previous encounter between neoidealism and a late-romantic vision of history. Il Duce taumaturgo: Modernist Rhetorics in Fascist Representations of History 27</page><page sequence="5">As Stephen Bann has argued in his analysis of romantic historical iconogra- phy, the image of Clio, the muse of history, "disclosing her breast" while simulta- neously pointing at the "engraved text of the law," is an icon of the irreducible polarities-law and body, narrative and trace, vision and touch-within which all nineteenth-century modes of historical representation oscillated.2' Early roman- ticism belonged to the extreme end of the spectrum, promoting an "affective view of history" and "an experience of the past modeled directly on sensory experi- ence." In the course of the century, however, narrative "took over the primary role of serving as an 'icon' of the historical process," thereby draining objects, ruins, and images of their original catalytic roles.22 Marginalized by the profes- sionalization of historiography and the rise of the realist novel, the romantic view of history took refuge in visual forms of historical representation and, in par- ticular, in the historical museum, whose hallmark lay in an "enveloping effect" and the "evocation of the sense of smell."23 In this way, the historical museum not only challenged the subordination of the inferior senses of touch, taste, and smell to the superior sense of sight-inherent in the literary narrativization of the past-but also provided a viable visual integration of Clio's book and uncovered breast. Monti's insistence that documents and relics reacquire their "flavor" thanks to "compulsive" studying and cataloging enlists a romantic sensitivity for a fascist recoding of the relationship between historical narrative and trace. In this respect, Monti's subject catalog was a menu for the enveloping effect resulting from the organic ordering of archival tidbits. Each item acquired a fully metonymic power by virtue of its inclusion in one or more subject headings; each heading contained the synecdochic promise of an organic relationship to contiguous ones. Hence, the scholar was freed from the anxiety of constructing a narrative, since the museum-archive director had already prefabricated one; instead, scholars could let themselves be taken in by the singular "flavor" and expressivity of each item. The secret of a thaumaturgic chain of effects, which Monti's own analysis of the ex-votos iconically mimicked, lay in forgetting what Bann calls the law-that is, narrative compulsion. The War Archive pushed the contemporary scholar to study the war-mentality of the masses so that, enveloped by their human yearning for thaumaturgic intervention, he could motivate his own intellectual engagement in the present. In this respect, Monti's commemorative lecture provided an apt closure to the romantic myth of the archive's birth: like Mussolini's thaumaturgic gesture-which violated the bourgeois law of indifference and power etiquette- the War Archive was not meant to heal a wound that had already turned into a scar, but to provide sensory access to the experience of being wounded. As in the case of neoidealism, however, Monti's modernization of historical representation, more than merely enlisting romanticism, sought to overcome its limits. As director of the most prestigious historical museum of the Risorgimento, 28 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="6">he actively denounced the chaotic, late-romantic arrangement of such institu- tions. In this respect, his overall strategy was not to reassert the supremacy of an antiquarian sensibility over narrative.24 The specific conditions of his kind of his- torical museum and archive suggested a response-bound approach unlike that of his romantic predecessors. As I shall argue below, beyond the Catholic, neoideal- ist, and late-romantic roots of Monti's thaumaturgic paradigm lay the modernist utopia of a perfect synesthesia of sensory-visual and mentally-visual responses to the past: the viewer's experience of enargeia (presence) and its mental transfigu- ration into energeia (narrative).25 In a memorandum written in 1925, shortly after his appointment as director, Monti announced his plan to transform the MRM from a "patriotic museum" into a "historical documentary of political and civic occurrences in Italy from the end of the eighteenth century to our days."26 But what else could a museum of the Risorgimento be, other than a patriotic museum? Monti never went much further than cryptic or sarcastic remarks concerning his predecessors, but a recent study of the prewar arrangement of these museums helps clarify his statement.27 Risorgimento museums have a precise origin-the Risorgimento Pavilion set up at the 1884 National Fair in Turin-but an uneven development both geo- graphically and chronologically. The Turin Pavilion established the interpretative model for the first museums and local politics determined their variations; but what made them all (in Monti's words) patriotic rather than historical museums was the absolute privilege their organizers accorded to emotional over archivistic- documentary value. In the total absence of "museotechnical" training and dis- position, these curators displayed the selected items with no regard for chronol- ogy, but with an evident obsession to induce a process of physical identification with the protagonists of the Risorgimento. They organized all museum rooms synecdochically, according to "theme and ambience," so that "the object from the past became the basis for an integrative construction of historical totalities."28 None of the newly founded museums could match Milan's in bringing this model of synecdochic representation to late-romantic perfection. One of its most prestigious founders, Cesare Correnti, was the outspoken fin de sikcle sponsor of a type of display aimed at "sparking the [viewer's] imagination, by exhibiting 'ob- jects that excite the senses.' "29 Yet the romantic poetics exalted by Correnti and embodied in the first arrangement of the Milanese museum do not at all explain Monti's opposition to a "patriotic" conception of historical representation. The negative connotation given by Monti to this highest of fascist virtues cannot be taken either literally or simply metaphorically. It does not indicate a political aver- sion to patriotic sentiment; it is not simply a synonym for romantic. As Monti's frequent references to a 1906 public discussion of Risorgimento museums sug- II Duce taumaturgo: Modernist Rhetorics in Fascist Representations of History 29</page><page sequence="7">gest, the term patriotic referred to a fetishistic conception of exhibition best ex- emplified in the work and words of the second curator of the Milanese museum, Ludovico Corio (1900-191 1). Responding to the harsh criticism of two positivist historians, Corio disclosed the root of the patriotic paradigm at the First Congress of Risorgimento Histo- rians (1906): How can we say, "I can accept this item, I cannot accept that other one"? How can we tell a poor old woman, "Look, this item we must exhibit in this showcase, this other item in another case"? It's a question of empathy: it seems to me that this is not yet the time for saying, "No, we can't accept the relics of those glorious times." Otherwise they will end up in the hands of speculators who will sell them back to us at a higher price when we look for them at a future time (applause).30 The applause that met Corio's explicit reference to the hypothetical exchange value of Risorgimental relics was not only a sign of the still widespread support for his empathetic conception of the museum but also a clue to its properly fe- tishistic origins. As Jean Baudrillard has suggested, all fetishisms consist in the reification of a supposed original form of value into a metaphysics of value that "registers itself as a kind of moral law at the heart of the object-and it is inscribed there as the finality of the 'need' of the subject."''3 For Corio and a majority of his audience, Risorgimento museums were called upon not only to accept all relics; they were also obliged not to select or separate them but to display them together as a whole. The museum directors neither attributed "historical value" to these objects, nor did they exhibit them simply because of the emotional appeal of their "age value," as analyzed by contemporary theorist Alois Riegl; the objects were exhibited as signs of memory value per se.32 As the generation of historical actors disappeared, anxiety about conflicting evaluations of the Risorgimento was dis- placed onto the fetishization of its relics. The museum was thus presented as both the collective injunction to remember and the affirmation of an equally collective need for memory. It was, I believe, to this fetishistic economy of the historical sign that Monti referred in his first public attack on the patriotic conception of Risorgimento museums at the Twelfth Congress of Risorgimento Historians (Turin, 1924). Be- ginning with a discussion of "the limits to be imposed on the exhibition of objects," he affirmed uncompromisingly that "hair, nails, bloodstained rags, bone frag- ments, butt ends of cigars, and similar stuff should be forever banned from any museum."33 Following this caustic rejection of fetishized memory, he asserted the inalienable primacy of historical value in determining the selection of objects to be displayed, including those whose emotional appeal could be closely related to Riegl's notion of age value. In so doing, Monti challenged the late-romantic prem- ises of Riegl's category of memory value. Writing in 1902 on the preservation of historical monuments, Riegl had dis- 30 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="8">tinguished their age value from their historical value on the basis of the viewer's reception. Age value revealed itself to any viewer in the object's aesthetics (incom- pleteness, a tendency to dissolve form and color), while historical value was as- signed only by learned viewers "in accordance with the modern notion that what has been can never be again, and that everything that has been constitutes an irreplaceable and irremovable link in a chain of development."34 For Monti, the museum situation not only made the distinction between his- torical and age value redundant but also exposed its a priori assumption of an opposition between knowledge and aesthetics. By 1924 he believed that Italian neoidealism had successfully rejected this fallacious antithesis but had failed to address its cultural manifestation in that fetishization of memory value that he saw as chiefly responsible for the sorry state of historical representation in archives and museums. Indeed, the very notion of historical development invoked by Riegl had allowed curators such as Corio to consider any object donated as irreplaceable and irremovable, while at the same time assuming that its inherent memory value would manifest itself to the immediate "sensory perception" of the viewer, a po- tential Riegl had assigned exclusively to age value.35 Toward a Modernist Mode of Historical Representation Overcoming in practice the perceived schism between knowledge and aesthetics became the fulcrum of Monti's reconceptualization of visual represen- tation in the historical museum. To this effect, he focused his 1924 lecture to Risorgimento historians on "four significant issues" pertaining to what he termed "technical preservation and display": 1. Concerning the limits of the period intended by the term "Risorgimento" 2. Concerning whether or not to exhibit photographs of materials belonging to other museums alongside the home museum's collection 3. If, and to what extent, the museums should also exhibit items not specifically patriotic 4. If, and according to which criteria, the Risorgimento museums should make space for the documentation of the Great War36 But how could this awkward grouping of cognitive and aesthetic issues be consid- ered technical? In the first place, the whole sequence is clearly framed by Monti's concerns with periodization. Although not alone in this concern, he was certainly the first museum director to suggest extending the museums' ad quem limit to 1918. With this call for the inclusion of World War I in the Risorgimental period, he was launching his bid for the directorship of the MRM-a move that paid off in the space of a few months. But bracketed between these concerns for periodization we find two original issues that are more difficult to categorize. Regarding the II Duce taumaturgo: Modernist Rhetorics in Fascist Representations of History 3 1</page><page sequence="9">exhibition of photographs, Monti declared he "would rather see only authentic objects exhibited, because they have an emotional and meditative impact on the viewer that photographs cannot replicate."37 This opposition to photographs might appear at first to be a nostalgic defense of the aura of authentic objects against their modern reproducibility, a stand that would confirm Walter Benja- min's characterization of the "processing of data in the Fascist sense" as an "un- controlled . . . application" of "outmoded concepts."38 And yet, in light of Ben- jamin's paradigmatic theses, Monti's remarks ring more modernist than outmoded. Monti's stress on the double impact of authenticity-emotional and meditative- captures the oxymoronic spell of Benjamin's most famous definition of the aura as "a unique [one-time] phenomenon of a distance, however close it may be."39 The curator's defense of historical aura, however, does not rely at all on outmoded concepts "such as creativity and genius, eternal value and mystery," as Benjamin implied, but on a conception of the relationship between aesthetics and knowl- edge that we have come to consider "modernist."40 As he specified at length in the same lecture, Monti objected not to photography per se, but to the display by one museum of photographed documents and objects owned by another in order to fill the narrative gaps. The authenticity he defended was not reducible to the uniqueness of exhibited objects but to the viewer's experience of fragmentary evidence, an experience that (in the historical museum) he considered both emo- tional and meditative and hence the basis of an imaginative fusion of sensory- visual stimuli and mentally-visual projections. The insertion of photographs in the display would not necessarily have signaled an abandonment of authenticity. On the contrary, the availability of the original in other museums would have given epistemological validity to the photograph's authenticity effect. Monti op- posed the imposition of the traditional aesthetics and psychology of realism and narrative knowledge over the emerging ones aimed at stimulating a mentally- visual form of historical consciousness. This repeated affirmation of an inseparable connection between synesthetic aesthetics, visual representation of the past, and the formation of historical con- sciousness sets Monti's activities beyond the paradigm of neoidealism, in either its Crocean or Gentilian version. In this respect, a more sustained comparison with Benjamin's contemporary discussion of aura further illuminates the fascist- modernist stakes of Monti's abandonment of both the positivist polarization of knowledge and aesthetics and the late-romantic fetishization of values. Looking closely at Benjamin's 1936 essay on "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction" as an antifascist manifesto, we should notice that his discussion of the aura not only raised all the issues relevant to the relationship between aesthetics and politics under fascism but it also erased the one most cru- cial to Monti's enterprise: the relationship between aesthetics, the sensory appa- 32 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="10">ratus, and the formation of historical consciousness. This erasure takes place in Benjamin's famous claim that architecture exemplifies the asymmetrical dichot- omy between visual perception (connected to contemplation-concentration) and tactile appropriation through habit (linked to unconscious optics and perception in a state of distraction).4' "Buildings," says Benjamin, "are appropriated in a twofold manner: by use and by perception-or rather, by touch and sight. Such appropriation cannot be understood in terms of the attentive concentration of a tourist before a famous building. On the tactile side there is no counterpart to contemplation on the optical side."42 Both senses are involved in the apprehension of a building, but Benjamin wants to stress their synesthetic potential to give a tactile quality to reception in a state of distraction, that is, "through habit." At the same time, however, he wants to negate the possibility of a reversed synesthesia of both senses by affirming that "at the turning points of history" it is only "tactile appropriation through habit" that can perform the "tasks which face the human apparatus of perception."'3 Clearly, Benjamin not only refused to take into consideration the intensifi- cation of internal visuality in the attentive apprehension of architectural space but also sought to downplay it. This aspect of Benjamin's text is the clearest clue to its militancy as an antifascist manifesto. Far from being "completely useless for the purposes of Fascism," Benjamin's attempt to privilege tactile over optical ap- propriation constitutes a response to the recodification of the aura that he rightly detected (and implicitly acknowledged) at the foundation of a fascist conception of the relationship between consciousness, aesthetics, and politics.44 The task that Benjamin attributed to the apparatus of perception was none other than the ma- terialist consciousness of reality. And this consciousness he wanted to root firmly in the primacy of tactile appropriation over optical means. The political implications of this unorthodox call for a primacy of touch over vision separate Benjamin from most other critics of fascism (both in the liberal and marxist camps). He was among the first to register and counteract the most crucial aspect of fascist politics: the radical subversion of the hierarchical subor- dination of tactics to strategy affirmed by both marxism and liberalism.45 Yet he was caught between his desire to appropriate such a subversion for a messianic marxism and his determination to delegitimize it by accusing fascism of aesthet- icizing politics through "the violation of an apparatus which is pressed into the production of ritual values."46 Pace Benjamin, it was through the recodification of aura-and not simply ritual values-in a modernist conception of the historical museum that the fascist curator sought to exploit the reversible apparatus of reception: from sensory- visual response to mentally-visual projection and vice versa. Monti's proposal to remove from every museum photographs of objects owned by other museums corresponded to a desire to lead the viewer from distraction to contemplation by stimulating tactically, that is, sensory-visually, his imaginative projection, that is, Il Duce taumaturgo: Modernist Rhetorics in Fascist Representations of History 33</page><page sequence="11">his mental vision. Monti's museum, as Benjamin says of film, was aimed at meeting the viewer's distracted "mode of reception halfway"; but rather than allowing the viewer to assume the position of the absent-minded examiner through the regu- lated administration of shocks, Monti sought to induce contemplation by relying solely on the synesthetic tactility of authentic objects. Thus, to paraphrase Benjamin, Monti recoded the aura as a unique phe- nomenon of presence, however distant a certain past may have been, thereby ex- tending to the history museum his thaumaturgic conception of the war archive. Now we can understand Monti's coherent (and by no means anti- or nonfascist) proposal to open Risorgimento museums to the exhibition of "not-properly- patriotic items," that is, "of materials pertaining to the reactionary or enemy camp, or concerning the political, economic, and civic life of the country, from the in- tellectual debates of ideas to the battles for health and social progress (such as those against pellagra, tuberculosis, alcoholism, illiteracy)."47 As he himself ad- mitted, this proposal would not simply transform the museums of Risorgimento into "social museums" but also call into question the means by which they had traditionally sought "to keep the patriotic sentiment always awake, and to strengthen national consciousness by means of examples from the past."48 At- tacking his predecessors' reduction of national wars to a series of "conspiracies, and efforts to expel the foreigner," and the resulting fetishization of memory value, Monti proposed instead to consider Risorgimental wars "just like the recent conflict of 1915-1918": as "national wars ... inform~ing], inspir[ing], and domi- nat[ing] all other manifestations of life."49 At last, in this passage, Monti discloses the "technical" impact of World War I as a historic event on his reconceptualization of the historical museum.50 The most recent war had recoded all wars as catalysts of national character. Accordingly, postwar Risorgimento museums would document and periodize the relative con- sistency and development of these manifestations of national virtue. Given the availability of great numbers of documents, the related problems of narrative integration by photographs and patriotic inspiration through fetishized examples had become not only theoretically but also practically obsolete. Eliminating these, the curatorial selection of documents and objects for display would invite the viewers to focus their narrative projection on the total history of the nation. Thus, Monti's Great War would come to explicate its historic nature in terms exactly opposite to those proposed by Benjamin in another essay written in 1936. For Benjamin, World War I had been directly responsible for the end of the last "aural" experience available to modern man, that of storytelling.5' Tactical warfare, he argued, had shattered strategic experience, thereby reducing all sur- vivors to an unprecedented silence, a prolonged inability to communicate their experiences orally to others. For Monti, on the contrary, the very experience of the Great War called for a modern recodification of the aura in visual history-telling. The war provided simultaneously a new ad quem limit for the narrative periodi- 34 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="12">zation of the Italian Risorgimento, the impetus for the transformation of a fetish- istic historical culture into a modernist-thaumaturgic one, and, finally, the very model to which all previous and future manifestations of national struggle should be made to conform. How far did Monti's implementation of such an ambitious reconceptualiza- tion of historical representation go? The answer can be at best tentative. Both Monti's private archive and the museum's administrative archives were destroyed during World War II. All we have are a few photographs, published in 1926, of the museum's archive, library, and central hall, and these do not permit an overall evaluation either of Monti's restructuring of the display or of his success in im- plementing his plans. A number of written statements concerning the museum's activities in the late 1920s and early 1930s, however, allow us to test at least the consistency of Monti's commitment to the innovations he announced in 1924. As far as his historiographical plans are concerned, the inclusion of World War I in the Risorgimento never took place.52 As the 1926 guide to the MRM announced, the museum covered-and continued to cover until 1945-the Ri- sorgimento "from the end of the eighteenth century to 1870, when the national unity of the peninsula was finally achieved with the entrance of the Italian army into Rome through Porta Pia."53 The creation of a Museo delta guerra (Museum of War) in 1935 definitively institutionalized that separation between the Great War and the Risorgimento Monti had consistently challenged from 1918 to 1924. And yet this departure from his ambitious historiographical plans did not signify an abandonment of the Great War as the pivotal element in restructuring the MRM. As Monti wrote in a 1925 memorandum, his first curatorial operation entailed reordering the museum's display "according to a chronological criterion such that each display case corresponded, as it were, to a page of history."54 Today we are all too accustomed to the identification of any historical representation with diachronic narrative to appreciate fully Monti's analogy between the mu- seum s cases and historical pages. We should recall, however, that until the end of World War I, all museum displays were characterized by chronological confusion and overlap.55 In this respect, the only surviving photograph of the museum's central room can help us recapture some of the specificity and literalness of Mon- ti's comment. This 1926 photograph (fig. 1) purposely emphasizes the general modularity of the display. It shows diagonally the perfect alignment of flags on the left side, the regular intervals between five busts, and a full view of the first display case. This case is divided into five panels documenting-with a series of regularly framed images and carefully arranged coins-the "Italian Campaigns from 1796 to 1800." The combination of diagonal depth, regular intervals, and standardized display gives a sense of orderly succession analogous to the regularity of narrative IlDuce taumaturgo: Modernist Rhetorics in Fascist Representations of History 35</page><page sequence="13">FIGURE 1.

This image was more than a panoramic view of the museum's main room; it presented readers and visitors with an icon of its aesthetic order and regularity, thereby announcing in the strongest possible way the su- periority of the new museum over its predecessor's patriotism and fetishistic disorder. This narrative regularity, however, was interrupted by five thematic rooms- in the corridor between the western and eastern wings of the museum-cele- brating the regional plebiscites of 1860 and various individual contributions (fig. 2). Aside from its unorthodox stress on economists, women, and foreigners, this topical section implemented the revision of the Risorgimento after the model of the Great War that Monti had announced in 1924. The new layout characterized the Risorgimento as a "national war" that mobilized social and intellectual forces within and beyond the geographical boundaries of the nation. Framed as it was, between the first narrative section, 1796-1860, and the long "Garibaldi Hall" that picked up the story from 1860 to 1870, the asymmetry of the topical rooms spa- 36 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="14">Li 0 SALA OIOLI sup.

The revolutionary press; the conspirator-ideologue Giuseppe Mazzini; and all the other exiled writers, econ- omists, women, and foreigners were selected, separated, and extracted from the narrative series to counteract the tale of the military events preceding them, while at the same time heralding the epic unity of the Garibaldian times following them. Thus these rooms tactically thematized an ideology of historical meaning: they stressed the intellectual activity that allows military history to become, as it were, national epic. As far as we can tell from the printed documents, Monti's sensitivity to the relationship between the narrative encoding of space and the codification of his- torical meaning in his historical museum was matched by an equal attention to II Duce taumaturgo: Modernist Rhetorics in Fascist Representations of History 37</page><page sequence="15">the more sensory-visual aspects of the display. The solution to what in 1924 he had understatedly called "questions of technical nature" became his most assid- uous concern and the subject of two consecutive communications to the nine- teenth and twentieth congresses of Risorgimento historians. In his 1931 address, Monti linked new conservation techniques for all types of relics and documents to the definitive defeat of that fetishistic adoration of "yellowed and dusty papers" characteristic of the first phase of Risorgimento his- toriography and exhibitions.56 From the addition of yellow glass to protect the most fragile documents and relics from the sun, to the restoration of uniforms and their exhibition on mannequins he had designed himself, to the novelty of a case constructed specially for the preservation of fragile posters, all of Monti's innovations intended "to let hygiene and cleanliness penetrate also into the rooms and onto the shelves of historical archives and museums."57 The following year he invited all participants in the 1932 congress of Risorgimento historians to ob- serve the results of his latest museotechnical innovations on display at the Mostra garibaldina he had organized in the Roman Palace of Exhibitions. Aside from the actual mode of display, the latest technical innovation was the so-called passe- partouts metodo Monti (passe-partouts patented by Monti), a framing device that employed very inexpensive "strips of lithographed paper for the framing of prints on inclined planes."58 At first glance, all these museotechnical innovations reasserted the absolute primacy of historical value over and against the emotional appeal of Riegelian age value fetishized by the previous generation of Risorgimento historians and mu- seum directors. And yet the resonant accord between Monti's advocacy of proper hygiene in the archive and his pursuit of order and regularity in the narrative rearrangement of the museum display underscores the modernist trajectory of his choices. The transfer of yellowness from the document to the glass panel between document and viewer captures Monti's reconceptualization of historical representation as a system-dependent notion of value and his rejection of any notion of inherent value, whether aesthetic or cognitive. The yellow glass of Monti's dis- play case preserved the unique but instrumental value of each item in a spatial system that surrounded the viewer with its modularity before the gaze could en- gage any single item. At the same time, the yellow glass also called the viewer's attention to the perishable nature of certain elements in the system and in so doing recoded the emotional appeal of age value while protecting against physical decay. The same can be said of the restored uniforms. Their bullet holes had been sewed up, thereby preventing the romantic revival of historical heroes, but their display on stylized mannequins stimulated the viewer's anthropomorphic visualization of the surrounding objects and documents as part of "lived history." Finally, the fact that posters and prints were uniformly framed with Monti's passe-partouts pointed the viewer's attention away from their memory value and toward their narrative value as structural elements in a visual history of the Risorgimento. 38 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="16">Historic Representation Monti's leadership in the modernization of the historical museum was unanimously acknowledged by his fellow historians and officially recognized by the highest fascist authorities when, in 1928, the director of the Fascist Cultural Institute of Milan, Dino Alfieri, invited him to collaborate in the organization of a Mostra storica del fascismo (Historical Exhibition of Fascism) in Milan.59Judging from handwritten annotations on the original plan of the exhibition, Monti's con- tribution was as significant for the organizers as it was for his own future. Re- sponding to Alfieri's call for "displaying the immediate evidence of what [the documents] seek to represent," Monti insisted on the need for "graphics, free- standing pillars, models, and a mise-en-scene that could attract the spectator's attention."60 But he also warned that, "being iconographically more interesting," the part of the exhibition centered on the Great War would have overpowered and "damaged the impression" of the segment that represented the political birth of fascism in 1919.61 In an interview published on 31 March 1932, Alfieri demonstrated that he had given careful consideration to the issues raised by Monti in his annotations. Rather than focusing on the different theaters of war (sea, land, sky), as originally planned, he affirmed that the war would be represented "only in its main aspects ... [so that] the part that will most attract the viewer will be the representation of the Bolshevik phenomenon and the rise of fascism from 1919 to 1921." Then, taking up Monti's emphasis on the aesthetics of the exhibition, Alfieri explained that fascism would be represented historically by means of "symbolic tables based on statistics, documents, and photographs" to enable the spectator "to grasp the phenomenon as a whole, with its three or four most prominent elements well represented, and highlighted in what makes them most characteristic and signif- icant in relation to our stated goals."62 Alfieri's historical exhibition of fascism was never set up in Milan but was rerouted by Mussolini to Rome to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the March on Rome in October 1932. The result of this change was the Mostra della rivo- luzione fascista (MRF), the most successful and celebrated product of fascist aes- thetics.63 But, as a recent commentator has pointed out, Alfieri's 1928 plan was "of decisive importance to the cultural history of the period" because it "prefig- ured the narrative scheme (as well as certain key design concepts) that the 1932 Mostra [was to] adopt," and it displayed a "montage-based approach" and a "mod- ernist ideology of design" that was an absolute novelty in Italy.64 In both of these respects the 1928 plan for the Mostra storica del fascismo made explicit the mod- ernist tension in the modernization of historical representation pursued by An- tonio Monti since the mid-1920s. Even so, planning the exhibition also integrated Monti's aesthetic and ideo- logical priorities. In line with his early reflection on the role of the Great War in II Duce taumaturgo: Modernist Rhetorics in Fascist Representations of History 39</page><page sequence="17">the restructuring of Risorgimento museums, his comments on the exhibition's plan emphasized the effective interaction of narrative proportion and visual stim- ulation. The parts of the exhibit dedicated to the representation of the Great War, whose powerful iconography could have overstimulated the viewer, needed to be reduced in both size and narrative span. By contrast, the representation of fas- cism's rise, victory, and consolidation was to be achieved through a mise-en-scene specifically aimed at exciting the viewer's attention. Monti's comments thus signal his definitive abandonment of World War I as representational model and ad quem limit for the Risorgimento, even as they point toward a structural connection between modernist aesthetics and what I have elsewhere defined as the historic representation of fascism.65 As Alfieri explicitly stated in his interview, the Mostra storica del fascismo sought to demonstrate that the March on Rome was "not merely a historical event" but a historic one: "the synthesis and resolution of an epic era, the beginning of a new history." Hence the planners' attention, in line with Monti's suggestions, to create an aesthetic crescendo from the introductory representation of the war "in large brush- strokes," through the representation of the years 1919-1921 as the "evident con- trast" between the "forces that wished the ruin of the Nation and the dawn of a new day," to the historic eruption of the March on Rome, "with which," Alfieri's interviewer interjected, "historical representation naturally ends!"66 When the Milanese exhibition was shifted to Rome-and its opening date postponed to celebrate the Decennale of the March on Rome-Monti was the only academic historian and museum director invited by Alfieri to participate in the organization of the Mostra della rivoluzione fascista. The MRF was accomplished by a team composed of thirty-four Italian artists (representing very different ar- tistic tendencies) and ten "historiographers" (aside from Monti, all prominent "eyewitnesses") enjoined by Mussolini to visualize the history of fascism's "coming to power" (1914-1922) in a style "ultramodern and daring, with no melancholic traces of the decorative styles of the past."67 For more than three months this group worked in situ under Alfieri's direction and Mussolini's watchful eye. The result was an exhibition of unprecedented popular, critical, and international suc- cess, acclaimed for its artistic syncretism and overall "futurist" imprint.68 But this excessive success was not only due to the ability of the artists and architects who installed it. Monti's strategic input in all phases of its organization made it into an "exhibition-demonstration" unlike any other ever attempted in Italy or abroad.69 Although Monti was officially charged only with the installation of the "Great War" rooms (C and D), Alfieri relied on Monti's collaboration for the preliminary selection and retrieval of documents to be exhibited and, most important, for the preparation of a "Political and Historical Outline for the Fascist Exhibition." Pro- viding artists and historiographers with a specific blueprint for their task, this working document divided the period under illustration into nine topical sections 40 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="18">(each entrusted to an artist-historiographer team), and it also suggested "effective and original representational solutions."70 All of these "aesthetic-spectacular" sug- gestions were followed in the exhibition, but none better and more effectively than Monti's implicit proposal for the exhibition's primary protagonist: not Mus- solini in person, nor fascism in general, but Mussolini's newspaper the Popolo d'I- talia.71 In the first place, the chronology of events in the "Outline" was extracted from the pages of the Popolo d'Italia, the basic chronicle of events for the visual narrative of the revolution. Second, the historical section of the exhibition started with Mussolini's founding of the newspaper in November 1914 and ended with his resignation from its directorship the day after the March on Rome (29 October 1922). Third, the Popolo d'Italia was used to separate the properly historical section (rooms A to Q) from the purely symbolic historic section of the exhibition (R to U), by inserting the central rooms between the reconstruction of Mussolini's first and last offices at the Popolo d'Italia (rooms P and T) (fig. 3). Finally, the "Outline" proposed the Popolo d'Italia as the most essential aesthetic code of the exhibition itself. Instead of producing figurative representations of Mussolini (of which only two appeared in the first ten rooms), artists and historiographers spared no effort in identifying il Duce with his newspaper and the allegorical reference to the "Ital- ian People" that its title entailed. They used all available photographic and mon- tage techniques to reproduce Mussolini's articles so that they could figure prom- inently in every room. They cut out passages from the editorials and reproduced them on walls and ceilings to create a narrative thread unifying the heterogeneous aesthetics of the different periods and episodes. At the same time, they displayed original articles next to documents of the events to which they referred, to under- line the "documentary" character of the narrative. In this way, the designers elim- inated all distinctions between document and commentary and inverted their semiotic relationships: in the Exhibition of the Fascist Revolution, the historical document functioned as commentary to Mussolini's words embodied in the Popolo d'Italia. In 1932, with the help of Italy's most qualified artists, Monti finally succeeded in implementing a modernist-fascist theory of historical representation; playing with the visual, sensual, and allegorical qualities of print, he "made present" to the viewer the fascist identification of "writing" history with "making" it. With this in mind he proceeded in 1933 to advocate that the Mostra della rivoluzione fas- cista be taken as a model for the restructuring of all historical museums and, in particular, Risorgimento museums. Pointing to the innovative interaction of doc- uments, allegorical figurations, and Mussolini's sentences in the first rooms of the exhibition, Monti proposed a three-part curatorial principle: (1) the exhibition of documents "foregrounded" with specific technical devices; (2) their framing by "iconographic, photographic, and theatrical reproductions" of contextual ele- II Duce taumaturgo: Modernist Rhetorics in Fascist Representations of History 41</page><page sequence="19">7 F nfl- L - iLjr7 jo Ls ~t?~t - li.i attePlzo del esoiin in Roe 192 Th nubr (omR an 2 (roo T) iniaetelcto 42~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ RERSETTIN C) W i f 5 i 1 W ~~~~ ~~ ~~~~~FASCI W 1---,,~~~~~~~~5L0, D'ONOR " |wu 5 .

All historical museums were to display the effect of "fascism" as the "historic event" of Italian history: that is, as an "event" that was not merely significant but signifying; an event incommensurable with any other because its palpability to collective consciousness gave it the unique semiotic ability to stand outside time and signify the narrative relationship between past, present, and future. Hence, all fascist exhibitions of history were to make the past present oil 2-n~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ - --- FIGURE 4.

In this way all narratives would find their legitimacy in the enargeia (presence) of the event they led to, foregrounded by the mise-en-scene of specific documents. Clearly, this subversion of both positivist and romantic aesthetics did not amount to a mere aestheticization of history. If, on the one hand, it translated quite literally Mussolini's polarization of the fascist "making" against the liberal "writing" of history, on the other hand, it highlighted the latent con- nection between the modernist debunking of narrative knowledge and the de- velopment of a new paradigm of historical consciousness. Grounded in the se- miotic spell of the "historic event" rather than the transparency of "historical facts," a modernist conception of history connects Monti's museum not only to Benjamin's exploration of messianic temporality but also to the naturalization of historic consciousness in the construction of historic events by the mass media in our postfascist era.73 Notes I would like to thank all the members of the Interdisciplinary Theory Workshop at Ohio State University for their comments on an earlier version of this essay. I hope they will recognize here a satisfactory response to their generous and critical engage- ment with my work. 1. Antonio Monti, "I musei del dolore," Critica sociale 30 (October 1920): 8-10.

The term Risorgimento refers to the process of national unification and indepen- dence of the Italian peninsula that took place in the mid-nineteenth century. However, the definition of both its a quo and ad quem limits has been the topic of an interminable debate among Italian scholars. 6. After a historiographical and administrative battle that lasted over a decade, in 1939 Monti succeeded in changing the official denomination of his museum to the Civic Institute of Contemporary History.

In this respect, it is important to note that during the war Antonio Monti had been a member of the military commission that had judged those military officers responsible for the disastrous defeat of the Italian army at Caporetto. The "Commissione Capor- etto" had been obliged to deal with crucial issues concerning both ethical and military conduct and the consequences that its own founding might have had on the "morale" of the nation. At the end of the war, Monti published an account of his experiences on the commission entitled Combattenti e silurati (Milan, 1921). 13.

In Italian, see the synthetic anthology of Crocean passages on history by Alfredo Parente, ed., II concetto della storia (Bari, 1962); and the earlier commentary by Salvatore Ro- mano, II concetto di storia nellafilosofia di Benedetto Croce (Palermo, 1933). 17. Croce's original essay "La storia ridotta sotto il concetto dell'arte" was revised and republished in II concetto di storia nelle sue relazioni col concetto dell'arte (Rome, 1896). He further elaborated his aesthetic in Estetica come scienza dell'espressione e linguistica generale (1902), translated into English by Douglas Ainslie as Aesthetic as Science of Expression and General Linguistics (London, 1909). Croce then began developing the relationship be- tween philosophy and history in his Logica come scienza del concetto puro, 9th ed. (1907; reprint, Bari, 1963), but systematized it in Teoria e storia della storiografia (1917), trans- lated into English by Douglas Ainslie as Theory and History of Historiography (London, 1921). The most specific commentary in English on Croce's aesthetics in relation to his early concept of history is in H. Wildon Carr, The Philosophy of Benedetto Croce: The Problem of Art and History, 2d ed. (New York, 1969), but see also M. E. Moss, Benedetto Croce Reconsidered: Truth and Error in Theories of Art, Literature, and History (Hanover, N.H., 1987). Croce's essays on art are collected in La critica e la storia delle artifigurative: Questioni di metodo, 2d ed. (Bari, 1946). For a discussion of Croce's ironic posture see Hayden White, "Croce: The Philosophical Defense of History in the Ironic Mode," chap. 10 of Metahistory (Baltimore, 1973), 375-425. 18. Most of Gentile's writings on history and aesthetics have been conveniently collected by Herve A. Cavallera in Frammenti di estetica e di teoria della storia, 2 vols. (Florence, 1992). The only sustained analysis of Gentile's philosophy in English is still in H. S. Harris, The Social Philosophy of Giovanni Gentile (Urbana, Ill., 1960). In Italian, one may consult the specific commentaries of Vito A. Bellezza, La problematica Gentiliana della storia (Rome, 1983); and Gianni M. Pozzo, La filosofia della storia di Giovanni Gentile (Padua, 1985). 19. Gentile's claim is from "L'oggetto della storia" (1937) in Frammenti, 2:71; Croce's is in Logica, 182. 20.

Usually the term synesthesia refers to a phenomenon in which one type of stimulation evokes the sensation of another, as when a certain drink suggests a color. In my dis- cussion, however, I use this term in a nontechnical sense to stress the gap between sensory-visual responses and the mentally-visual constructions they may suggest. I thus define as synesthetic the sensory transformation of our visual perceptions of an object into more complex mental images in what is usually referred to as the mind's eye.

The two positivist historians who attacked Ludovico Corio at the congress were Achille Berta- relli and Giuseppe Gallavresi. Their statements became the manifesto of a "scientific" and "intellectual" resistance against the dominant "sentimental" approach subscribed to by Corio and a majority of museum curators. After the war, Bertarelli and Gallavresi became Monti's principal allies in the restructuring of the Museo del Risorgimento (MRM). It was Bertarelli's donation of his historical collection of Great War newspa- pers and printed propaganda that allowed the establishment of Monti's war archive. As for Gallavresi, in 1924 he became the Milanese Assessore alla cultura (municipal official in charge of culture). From this position he became Monti's most strategic ally and the primary provider of the museum's financial support.

I am referring here to the larger notion of modernism current in literary and philo- sophical studies rather than to the more restrictive one of "modernist generation" elaborated by cultural historians. In particular, I follow here Hayden White's definition of modernist historical representation, which he has presented in explicit connection to both the fascist representation of history and the contemporary representation of fascism. White defines the modernist mode of historical representation as hinging "on a new distinctive way of imagining, describing, and conceptualizing the relationships obtaining between agents and acts, subjects and objects, a statement and its referent- between the literal and figurative levels of speech, and, indeed, therefore between factual and fictional discourse." Although this definition of modernism is very broad and schematic, it has two advantages over a number of more elaborate ones. First, it addresses specifically the relationship between twentieth-century historical culture and aesthetic modernism by deconstructing the customary polarity between "time" and "realism" on one hand and "space" and "modernism" on the other. Second, it defines a certain propensity in twentieth-century thought, art, and politics to cross the porous boundaries of several interconnected dichotomies generally associated with nineteenth-century positivism, naturalism, and liberalism. See Hayden White, "His- torical Emplotment and the Problem of Truth," in Saul Friedlander, ed., Probing the Limits of Representation: Nazism and the "Final Solution" (Cambridge, 1992), 49. More recently White has returned to the same theme, arguing that modernist literature and theory developed in response to twentieth-century modernist events that "function in the consciousness of certain social groups exactly as infantile traumas are conceived to function in the psyche of neurotic individuals"; Hayden White, "The Modernist Event," in Vivian Sobchack, ed., The Persistence of History: Cinema, Television, and the Modern Event (New York, 1996), 17-38. Compare to Fachinelli, "II fenomeno fascista." 41. Benjamin produces an expanded analogy between painter and magician, surgeon and cameraman in section 9 of "Work of Art" (233-34), but specifies its theoretical and political underpinnings in the last two sections (239-42). 42. Ibid., 240. 43. Ibid. 44. Ibid., 218. 45. A similar political intuition characterizes Georges Bataille's controversial theorization of a more militant antifascism in the same period. See Georges Bataille, "La structure psychologique du fascism," Oeuvres Completes (Paris, 1970-1988), 1: 340-65, and the commentary on his texts and letters in this period recently published in Italian by Marina Galletti, Contres-attaques: Gli anni della militanza antifascista, 1932-1939 (Rome, 1995). 48 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="26">46.

In many respects this essay may be considered a companion to the "Work of Art" essay written in the same year. 52. Monti was one of the very first historians to argue publicly, a few months after the official end of World War I, that only "with the Italian conquest of Trento, Trieste, and the Dalmatian lands could the Risorgimental cycle be finally considered definitively closed."

The exhibition was meant to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the foundation of the first fascist organization: the Milanese fasci di combattimento. Monti was invited to par- ticipate by the president of the Milanese Institute of Fascist Culture, Dino Alfieri. On Alfieri's role in the planning of the never-realized Mostra storica del fascismo (1928) and in the successful implementation of the Mostra della rivoluzione fascista (1932), see Marla Stone, "The Politics of Cultural Production: The Exhibition in Fascist Italy, 1928-1942" (Ph.D. diss., Princeton University, 1990), 241-58. 60.

In my article "Fascism and Historic Representation," I define as historic the fascist representation of events constructed/perceived as both historical and semiotic: that is, as events that give meaning to the past and recode historicizing narratives, rather than receive meaning from them. 66. Alfieri, "La mostra storica." 67. Dino Alfieri and Luigi Freddi, Mostra della rivoluzionefascista (Rome, 1933), 8. 68. From a quantitative point of view, in the two years it remained open to the public, the Mostra della rivoluzione fascista drew more than 3,850,000 visitors and showed an unforeseen profit of ca. 15.5 million liras. But from a cultural perspective it generated a far greater symbolic surplus: it defined the "exhibition" as the privileged locus for a "fascist" synthesis of diverse artistic tendencies, and it responded to the "revolutionary" challenge of soviet constructivism by matching the international success of El Lissitzky's pavilion at the 1928 Cologne International Pressa Exhibition. For a detailed discussion of popular and critical responses to the MRF, see Schnapp, "Epic Demonstrations," 17-24; and Stone, "Staging Fascism," 215-43. 69. This definition was coined by the regime's most prestigious art critic, Margherita Sar- fatti. "What opened in Rome," she wrote inJanuary 1933, "is not simply 'the exhibition' [la mostra], but something greater; it [is] 'the demonstration' [la dimostrazione] of the Fascist Revolution. And here I employ the verb 'to demonstrate' in its literary and figurative, as well as its mathematical and physical meanings. The show makes the Revolution plain, palpable, and intelligible, while at the same time providing proof, a definitive proof of the experiment's success, by calculation and figure. It took Fascism to revolutionize Italy in depth, before such an artistically revolutionary-and at the same time so very Italian and Fascist-idea could even be conceived."

Luigi Freddi, Traccia storico-politica per la mostra delfascismo (Rome, 1932), 8. Although Freddi appears as the only author, this document was undoubtedly the result of a collaboration with Alfieri and Monti. 71. I discuss in greater detail Monti's pivotal role in planning the exhibition in "The His- toric in the Making," 409-92. 72. Monti made this proposal at a 1933 congress of fascist cultural institutes in Milan, chaired by Giovanni Gentile. See Antonio Monti, "La mostra della rivoluzione e i musei storici" in Atti del terzo congresso degli istitutifascisti cultura (Rome, 1933), 19-26. 73. Although Benjamin thematized his conception of history in his "Theses on the Phi- losophy of History," in Illuminations, 253-64, its modernist genealogy was elaborated in his earlier essays on Charles Baudelaire and Marcel Proust. In this respect, the fascist foregrounding of historic temporality has several points of contact with the concepts of "involuntary memory" and "duration" that Benjamin considered the essence of 50 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="28">modernity and modernism. See in particular Walter Benjamin, "On Some Motifs in Baudelaire," and "The Image of Proust," in Illuminations, 155-215.
