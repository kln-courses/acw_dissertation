(Acta universitatis Upsalien sis. Boreas. 18.) 112 skr. There are manifold ways in which anthropomorphic dedications have been examined over the years, often with a view to style, date, technical skill, place of production, and identity. Alroth's book encompasses a broader scope and has a fresh and novel approach to the study. In a clear, concise, and well-focused work, A. discusses two main issues: the relationship between the cult image and votive figurines intended to depict the deity and the occurrence of figurines representing one deity given to another deity. She examines published material from 26 sites and includes a number of illustrations. In the first part of the book, A. explores the possible influence from the cult image on the appearance of figurines dedicated at 17 sites. She notes that there are three ways of viewing the figurines: as copies of the image, as completely indepen dent of the image in terms of appearance, or as having some conceivable influence from the image. A. states that one must begin with the cult statue and any know ledge there might be about its appearance. In a small number of instances we have the preserved image but in most cases the main source of information derives from ancient authors, especially Pausanias. Also, epigraphical evidence and coins are sometimes used. The contribution of Romano's work on early cult images is significant to this study but A. builds on it and explores other avenues of inquiry. To determine the degree of resemblance between the cult image and the figurines, 16 Gnomon 1991</page><page sequence="2">242 M. E. Voyatzis: Alroth, Greek gods and figurines A. first defines the word Similarity' as including specific attributes, gestures and poses. She stresses the importance of the homogeneity of the figurine material and looks for the predominance of specific types of traits over a long period of time, while allowing for stylistic developments. The study is divided according to site and begins with those sanctuaries where we know what the cult image looked like, such as at Dreros and Paros. For each site, A. begins with an analysis of the appearance of the cult image and then discusses the figurines in an attempt to determine any influence. At Dreros and Paros, although the original cult statues or parts of them were preserved, A. concludes that no influence from the cult image on the votive figurines can be argued. The majority of sites discussed are those in which we have some information about the cult statue but not enough to be sure of its appearance. At Samos, the cult image of Hera has been reconstructed from various ancient sources and coins; it is likely that it influenced the appearance of a rather homogeneous group of standing terracotta figurines adorned with jewellery. At Tiryns, Pausanias described the cult image as seated. It probably influenced the relatively large number of seated figur ines with applied ornaments found at the site. A. suggests that at Sparta there was an old, wooden, cult statue of Artemis Orthia which may have influenced a type of figurine with a rigid, standing pose, made in a variety of materials over a long period. The image may later have been dressed in animal skins, helmet, and other warrior elements, as this aspect of the cult received greater emphasis. At some sites, such as at the sanctuaries of Zeus at Olympia, Athena Chalkioikos at Sparta and Athena Alea at Tegea, there are only one or a few figurines that might have been inspired by the cult image. One of the cult statues of Zeus at Olympia was mentioned by Pausanias to be a bearded warrior standing by the side of Hera in the Heraion; it is possible that a figurine of a bearded, bronze warrior found at the site might reflect this image. At Tegea, there is limited information about what the cult statue looked like, but A. believes that a bronze Athena of Palladion type (with a gorgoneion, which is unusual in the P?loponn?se) may be regarded as a possible reflection of the cult image made by Endoios. While A. states that the votive material from Tegea goes back to Geometric times (it does in fact go back to PG), she refrains from mentioning the earlier bronze anthropomorphic figurines, presumably because they are unlikely to reflect an early cult image. They are important, however, because they may indicate something of the nature of the early cult. Some of the figurines reflect a fertility and nature deity and others, a protectress. In this light it is noteworthy that two bronze warriors with conical helmets from Tegea are very similar to the terracotta head from the sanctuary of Apollo at Amyklai. The bronzes support A.'s conclusion that the terracotta head represents a human warrior and is not a copy of the cult image of Apollo. A. makes an interesting proposal about the much debated appearance of the cult image of Athena Polias at Athens. She suggests that the old image was standing on a throne and draped in a long garment, giving it the appearance of being seated. If viewed in this way, the Archaic seated figurines dedicated at the site may allude to the image. At Olympia, A. agrees with recent scholarship which rejects the identification of the limestone head as part of the cult statue of Hera. She argues that the cult image, which Pausanias describes, was seated, probably made of wood and dated from the late seventh century at the latest. To judge from the small number of female figurines found at the site, it seems that their appearance was not influenced by the image. Finally, A. examines the site of Lousoi, where we have no information about the</page><page sequence="3">M. E. Voyatzis: Alroth, Greek gods and figurines 243 appearance of the cult statue but where certain figurines may help to reconstruct it. (She rejects the identification of a fragment of a statue found at the site as part of the cult image.) Some of the terracottas and bronze figurines reveal a distinctive style with unusual square heads and bodies that persist over a fairly long period of time; these statuettes may indicate some influence from a cult image. The author concludes that in no case can one argue that the figurines are copies of the image, but that it is sometimes possible to see an influence from the cult image. She observes that none of the large chryselephantine statues were used as prototypes for the votive figurines. Most of the cult images in her study were old wooden xoana which were probably anthropomorphic from the beginning and range in date from the eighth to the sixth century B.C. Some of them had remov able dress and accessories which distinguished them, and over time these items may have been replaced by others. Despite the late sources describing the cult images, A. finds clues in the descriptions which might indicate a more primitive appear ance; she also notes the date of the first temple and of the earliest votives at each site to help determine when the cult image was most likely to have existed. I think that the nondescript nature of the early cult images and the generic appearance of the earliest anthropomorphic figurines may be why it is generally not possible to trace influence from the cult image back to the eighth century, a period when Greek sanctuaries were otherwise enjoying great growth. It appears that influence from the cult image is easier to determine from the seventh century on, when attributes are more common and the figurines can be identified with greater cer tainty. In the second part of the book, A. examines visiting gods from 20 sites, where figurines representing one deity were dedicated to another deity. While this aspect of votive figurines has been touched upon by other scholars, this is the first comprehensive examination. A. attempts to discern a variety of patterns in such dedications. She includes sanctuaries where the identity of the deity is generally known. Most of the material used is published and ranges from the Geometric to the Classical periods. Where possible, A. provides tables indicating the total number of anthropomorphic figurines, distinguishing between those representing visiting deities and hosts. She stresses that these tables, while helpful, cannot be used for quantitative studies. A. studies each site individually in this section. She begins by discussing the recipients of the votive offerings and then lists the possible visitors in catalogue form. She determines that there are eight recipient deities: Zeus, Hera, Athena, Apollo, Artemis, Demeter, Despoina and the Kabiroi. At some sites, there was more than one deity who was a possible host, such as at Olympia, Dodona, Lindos, Amyklai, and Lykosoura. It is sometimes unclear whether the figurines representing the visiting deities were intended as votives for the principal deity or for a secondary recipient. A. concludes that in general the principal deity at the site was the most likely recipient of the figurines. At other sanctuaries, there is less doubt about who the recipients were, such as at Lykaion, Perachora, the Argive Heraion, the Heraion on Delos, the Akropolis at Athens, Sparta (Athena Chal kioikos and Artemis Orthia), Elateia, Ptoion, Ephesos, Knossos, and Proerna. The relative quantities of figurines representing recipient deities and visitors are sometimes difficult to estimate since it is not always possible to determine the number of statuettes depicting the owner. At Lindos, some of the visitors are represented by a greater number than is the host; A. concludes that the figurines alone cannot be used to identify a sanctuary. i6::'</page><page sequence="4">244 W. A. P. Childs: Jacobs, Griech. u. pers. Elemente in der Grabkunst Lykiens It is also frequently a challenge to recognize the visitors. For instance, statuettes tentatively identified as Artemis and Aphrodite could also be interpreted as votaries. Athena is generally easier to identify with confidence. In addition to the standard divinities, less common deities may also be recognized among the visitors, such as Dionysos, Pan, Kybele, Eros, Herakles, Silenos, and the crouching dwarf called &lt;Kourotrophos-Daimon.5 Although A. provides some useful illustrations, it would be helpful if there were more photographs, especially of the figurines with uncertain identity. The reasons why the visitors appear in sanctuaries of other divinities are explored. In the case of Zeus, A. suggests that all deities are appropriate offerings to the supreme god. At sanctuaries of Hera, Athena, Demeter, Artemis, Despoina, A. argues that the fertility and kourotrophos aspects of their cults may have played a role in determining visitors. Close relationships between deities might also ex plain the presence of a visiting deity, such as figurines of Artemis at sanctuaries of her brother, Apollo. The author observes a number of patterns among the visiting deities at the various sanctuaries, taking into account all figurines even if their identity is dubi ous. She notes that there are no standard combinations between the visiting gods and their recipients, except for the fact that Artemis and Aphrodite often appear together at the same sites. She also states that in terms of numbers of visitors, Panhellenic sanctuaries do not differ significantly from other sanctuaries. Another pattern she observes is that female deities were more hospitable than male gods. A. concludes that the practice of deity dedicating a figurine of one deity to another was not a late development but had already begun in Archaic times; most examples appear to date to the fifth century B.C. In some cases the votives may have been considered appropriate because they reflected an aspect of the recipient's character or because of some special relationship between the visitor and the host; in others the gift may have been thought to be pleasing to any deity. A.'s book is a great contribution to the study of votive anthropomorphic figur ines. She explores specific issues in depth and, despite the limitations which she explicitly states at the onset, reaches significant conclusions. This impressive work serves to illuminate some of the more subtle and complex aspects of anthropomor phic dedications at Greek sanctuary sites. Tucson, Arizona Mary E. Voyatzis</page></plain_text>
