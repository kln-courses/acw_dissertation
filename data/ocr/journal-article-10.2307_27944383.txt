<plain_text><page sequence="1">Quantum Non-Locality as an Indication of Theological Transcendence David E. Conner / Pastor, Wheat Ridge Congregation of the United Church of Christ, Wheat Ridge, Colorado onventional notions of causality may be said to be based on the concept of locality. That is, causation is conventionally understood to be transmitted by objects or energies which move from place to place through space in immediate proximity to one another as a "chain of events," in the manner of colliding billiard balls or falling dominoes. Such causation is said to be "local" because it is envisioned as taking place when cause and effect share a common space or locale. Even causes which at first appear to be widely separated from their effects, as when light emitted by the sun causes plants to grow on earth, are actually local causes, because the sun's rays or photons pass through an adjoining series of locations in the intervening space at a certain rate? in this case, the speed of light. In contrast to local causation, quantum theory predicts that immediate (non-mediated) "correlations" may exist between particles? or, more accurately, "particle-like entities"?even at great distances, whenever the particles are co-members of a single quantum system. Such correlated particles are said to be "entangled," and the correlation between them does not depend on any known form of "local" causation which is mediated through intervening space from point to contiguous point. The correlations between entangled particles are not conveyed by any mediating agent and are presumed to be instantaneous. Since, according to quantum physics, particles which are entangled in this fashion have been being created continually ever since the Big Bang, quantum mechanics has become the basis for the idea that the entire universe is to a significant extent entangled in a web of non-locality. Amazingly, during the past two decades quantum non-locality has been experimentally verified. For naturalistic philosophical theologies which focus on conceptualities such as holism, organism, and universal interrelatedness, the empirical verification of quantum non-locality cannot help but be enormously suggestive. In the discussion that follows I first briefly summarize the idea of quantum non-locality and</page><page sequence="2">260 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy then consider the applicability of this concept for naturalistic philosophical theologies. As a means of fleshing out the topic I examine two examples of naturalistic philosophy?the thought of Bernard Loomer and the thought of Alfred North Whitehead. I describe two contrasting orientations towards practical spirituality that may be associated with the positions of Loomer and Whitehead, and conclude with the suggestion that these two contrasting orientations might to some degree be harmonized or thought of as "complementary," after the method of complementarity in quantum physics. I. Quantum Non-Locality Quantum physics may be said to have originated in 1900 with the publication of a paper by German physicist Max Planck. Planck proposed that black bodies radiate energy not continuously but discontinuously, in discrete amounts called quanta, stated by the relation: E = hv, where E is the quantum of energy radiated, is the frequency, and is a universal constant equal to 6.6256 10"27 erg-sec.1 The constant h, identified by Planck, quickly became known as "Planck's constant," and h appears ubiquitously in the formulas of quantum physics. Based on the work of Planck, Rutherford, and others, in 1913 Niels Bohr proposed a new model of the atom. Bohr postulated that any electron orbiting in an atom must have an angular momentum equal to a whole number multiple of the quantity h / 2 . In Bohr's new model, because each electron's angular momentum had to be a multiple of a fixed quantity and a whole number (1, 2, 3, 4, . . .), the electrons' angular momenta were said to be quantized, that is, restricted to certain magnitudes. A crucial addition to Bohr's atomic model was the Pauli exclusion principle, enunciated by Wolfgang Pauli in 1923.2 In essence, the Pauli exclusion principle means that the electrons in an atom fill up their orbitals in an orderly structure, as if students had been assigned to rooms in a dormitory. For the purposes of this illustration, each room may be occupied by only one student and, remarkably, as they move in, 1 S. H. Maron and C. F. Prutton, Principles of Physical Chemistry, 4th ed. (New York: The Macmillan Co., 1965), 611. 2 Ibid., 621</page><page sequence="3">Vol. 27, Nos. 2 &amp; 3, May/September 2006 261 the students are required to take rooms in the sequence of the room numbers, beginning on the first floor and proceeding through the upper floors. Further, if by some chance a lower room is vacated?that is, if an electron is knocked out of the atom?the upper residents immediately move down so that the lower vacancy is filled. For present purposes, the importance of the Pauli exclusion principle is that it shows that all of the electrons in an atom must be treated as a single system. Even in the heaviest elements, such as Mendelevium and Nobelium with over a hundred electrons, each electron maintains its own unique set of quantum numbers. In some mysterious way all the electrons communicate their quantum state with one another so that no electron takes the quantum numbers of any other. In classical physics there is no reason why the electrons in an atom should "communicate" in this manner. Indeed, one of the postulates of Bohr's atomic model states that the orbiting electrons do not radiate any energy. Therefore whatever their means of communicating with one another may be, it does not involve the transmission of physical energy. The non-mediated nature of this "communication"3 is, as we shall see, the basis for the notion of non-locality in quantum physics. Quantum theory implies that particles which are co-members of the same system communicate with one another instantaneously. This would violate the principle in Einstein's theory of relativity, which requires that no signal can travel faster than the speed of light. Einstein objected to this aspect of quantum mechanics. His side of the debate was presented most memorably in a 1935 paper written jointly by Einstein, Boris Podolsky, and Nathan Rosen. The three proposed a theoretical scenario that has subsequently become known as the "EPR thought experiment." This thought experiment invites us to imagine two particles which originate in a single sub-atomic event, so that their quantum properties such as angular momentum are correlated?that is, mutually determinable according to a known formula or rule. The particles are allowed to fly apart and then, for one of them, a quantum property such as spin or angular momentum is measured. It must be understood that the two particles are part of a single quantum system, like the electrons in the orbital shells of a single atom. 3 Electrons do not "communicate" in any ordinary sense of the word, but it is not unusual even among scientists to apply colloquial terms to atomic phenomena, for lack of any more appropriate terminologies or conceptualities.</page><page sequence="4">262 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy Quantum theory predicts that, just as the electrons in an atom must follow the Pauli exclusion principle, either of the two particles in the EPR thought experiment must somehow "respond" to changes in the other. It is an over-simplification of the EPR reasoning, but the net result of the imagined procedure is that the act of measurement has an effect on the first particle which should cause an immediate correlated effect in the second, even at a large distance. According to the principle of local causes, which prior to quantum theory was assumed to apply universally, such interaction between the two particles could conceivably require a signal of some kind to travel faster than the speed of light, constituting a type of "spooky action at a distance,"4 and thus violating the restrictions of Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity. Einstein refused to countenance this possibility. The Einstein-Podolsky Rosen paper therefore concludes that Bohr's Copenhagen Interpretation5 "makes the reality of [position and momentum in the second system] depend upon the process of measurement carried out on the first system which does not disturb the second system in any way. No reasonable definition of reality could be expected to permit this. " 6 The words of this last sentence should ring in the ears of anyone who has ever studied the historic problems of metaphysics. This debate between Einstein and quantum theorists remained at an impasse until 1964, when physicist John S. Bell of the Centre for European Nuclear Research in Geneva (CERN) altered the situation dramatically by publishing a now famous short article, "On the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox."7 Relying on only a few pages of 4 This phrase was used by Einstein himself; see A. Einstein, Born-Einstein Letters (New York: Walker, 1971), 158. 5 The "Copenhagen Interpretation" or "CI" is the name generally given by physicists to the explanation of quantum theory formulated by Bohr and his associates. Bohr was born in Copenhagen and did most of his work there. 6 A. Einstein, B. Podolsky, and N. Rosen, "Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?"

The differences revealed by Bell's mathematics became known as "Bell's inequalities." Citing prior suggestions by D. B?hm and Y. Aharonov, Bell even outlined an experimental procedure by which the differences between EPR and CI could be tested. Instruments and techniques available in 1964 were not advanced enough to test Bell's theorem conclusively, but this situation changed with the advent of fiber optic cable, high speed electronic switches, and other developments.8 As physicist Alain Aspect later wrote, "The choice between the positions of Einstein and Bohr was then no longer a question of personal taste. Instead, it became possible to settle the question experimentally, by looking carefully at measurements of correlations between entangled particles."9 In 1982, using rapidly switched polarizers, the team of Aspect, P. Grangier, and G. Roger published clear-cut results showing that Bohr, and not Einstein, was correct.10 An even more spectacular verification of non-locality was obtained by the team of Nicolus Gisin in Geneva in the 1990s.11 In the Gisin experiment, light from a single laser diode located at a telecommunications station near downtown Geneva was focused into a potassium niobium trioxide crystal (KNb03). The crystal serves to split or "down-convert" each photon from the laser into two paired or "entangled" photons, each with half the energy and twice the wavelength of the original photon. The newborn twin photons are then focused by a lens into a standard fiber coupler which directs them into two different fiber optic cables. In the Geneva experiment, one cable led to a detector in Bellevue, a little village 4.5 km north of Geneva, and the other led to a detector in Bernex, another little village about 7.3 8 The results of the experiments by Aspect and N. Gisin are described by Nadeau and Kafatos, 77-80. 9 Alain Aspect in the "Introduction" to Bell, Speakable and Unspeakable in Quantum Mechanics, xxiv. 10 A. Aspect, Grangier and G.

Lett. 73 (1994): 1923.</page><page sequence="6">264 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy km southwest of Geneva. The total distance between the two towns is about 10.9 km (6.8 miles). At the ends of each of the two cables, the photons were passed into an interferometer, a device in which light may, by chance, take either of two paths?a long path or a short path.12 Altering the temperature of the interferometer influences which path will be taken. In the experiment, the Bernex interferometer was subjected to temperature-caused phase changes, while the Bellevue interferometer was not. Detection devices revealed that the Bellevue photons made "choices" in their interferometer which showed a correlation with the choices being made by their twins in the changing Bernex interferometer. The "choices" at the Bellevue interferometer took place before any signal could have traversed the distance from Bernex, even at light speed. Because only the Bernex interferometer was being altered, the choices being made at the Bellevue interferometer could not be attributed to pre-existing characteristics which pertained to both photons. The actual data allowed the experimenters to infer a violation of the Bell inequality by ten standard deviations, providing emphatic empirical evidence that "the spooky action between entangled photons does not break down when separating the particles by a physical distance of 10 km."13 The authors summarize: "Tests of the so-called Bell inequalities have been made again and again, showing more and more clearly that the quantum correlations cannot be explained by local hidden variables theories (LHVT). Today, most physicists are convinced that a future loophole-free test will conclusively demonstrate that nature is indeed nonlocal."14 This is a major discovery whose theoretical and practical import is still in the early stages of investigation. 12 The optical path-length difference is 20 cm in both interferometers, resulting in a 1.5 nanosecond time difference between the two possible paths. 13 The preceding description of the experiment is taken from W.

As a means of exploring this suggestiveness more fully, we will briefly consider the contrasting orientations of two seminal thinkers, Bernard Loomer and Alfred North Whitehead. Here we are speaking of transcendence neither in the Augustinian sense of existing outside of physical nature, nor in the Barthian sense of a revealed theology which "transcends" scientific or philosophical modes of knowledge. For both Whitehead and Loomer, theological transcendence is limited to whatever may be deemed ultimate about the natural world.15 It may seem odd to use the word transcendence to pertain to theologies which so strongly endorse immanence, but note that the very fact of being universally present may be regarded as a type of transcendence.16 In a still-important book, The Size of God, Loomer memorably stated that "God is to be identified either with a part or with the totality of the concrete, actual world. The thesis of my essay is that God should be identified with the totality of the world, with whatever unity the totality possesses."17 It is beyond our scope to try to clarify the manifest nuance of Loomer's theology and the noted ambiguity of his use of words such as "concrete," "abstract," "physical," and "conceptual."18 For present purposes, the relevant part of Loomer's thinking is found in the pregnant phrase, 'whatever unity the totality possesses. " It is this conviction that God is to be identified with the entire world that corresponds with Loomer's central theological motif of stature or size. "Size" signifies "the volume of life you can take into your being and 15 Loomer presents a naturalistic interpretation of ultimacy as the transcendent basis for religious feeling in The Size of God: The Theology of Bernard Loomer in Context, ed. William Dean and Larry E. Axel (Macon: Mercer Univ. Press, 1987), 23-27; and Whitehead uses the term "transcendence" to denote that which has a universal "capacity for determination" in Process and Reality: An Essay in Cosmology, ed. David Ray Griffin and Donald Sherburne (New York: Free Press, 1978 [1927]), 239. 16 See "Transcendence" in Van A. Harvey, A Handbook of Theological Terms (New York: Collier Books, 1964), 243. 17 Loomer, The Size of God, 20. 18 Loomer's imprecise use of these terms is cited by John B. Cobb, Jr., in "Response to Loomer," The Size of God, 53-54; and by Nancy Frankenberry, "Taking Measure of 'The Size of God,'" in the same book, 78.</page><page sequence="8">266 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy still maintain your integrity." That God has the utmost Size means for Loomer that God includes everything; nothing is to be left out, not even what is irrational or evil. Loomer admits that most persons will not appreciate the inclusion of incompleteness and evil in God, but he affirms this theological choice nevertheless. The world is God because it is the source and preserver of meaning; because the creative advance of the world in its adventure is the supreme cause to be served; because even in our desecration of our space and time within it, the world is holy ground; and because it contains and yet enshrouds the ultimate mystery inherent within existence itself. "God" symbolizes this incredible mystery. The existent world embodies it. The world in all the dimensions of its being is the basis for all our wonder, awe, and inquiry.20 One of the most prominent themes in The Size of God is Loomer's conviction that a concrete God who includes the totality of the world must be an ambiguous God. In his essay this ambiguity is noticed mainly at an axiological level concerning God's goodness, but there is an ontological ambiguity as well, discernible in Loomer's implicit invitation to ponder the degree to which the world as a whole may be said to exhibit unity. Surely many persons upon reading Loomer's words have reflected upon the question of cosmic unity and felt that there was a pronounced ambiguity from the outset, necessitated by Loomer's very definition of God. The notion of "Size" as including everything is ambiguous axiologically because the concrete world bears no unequivocal relation to the Good; it is ambiguous ontologically because the nature or extent of cosmic unity may itself be divergently interpreted, or indeed denied altogether. Even if we agree that the universe is a continuous system of causal relations, a consideration of the merely physical dimensions of the cosmos brings to mind the incomprehensible vastness of interstellar space, measured in billions of light-years; causal connections which, if they are made at all, can travel no faster than the speed of light; and all in a general context of the random diffusion of blind energy, destined eventually to burn out in 19 Loomer, "S-I-Z-E," Criterion 13 (Spring 1974): 6. 20 Loomer, The Size of God, 42.</page><page sequence="9">Vol. 27, Nos. 2 &amp; 3, May/September 2006 267 entropie heat death. Regardless of any cosmological considerations of a more philosophical or religious character, this physical picture is neither one of unambiguous wholeness nor of unambiguous goodness. We suspect that Loomer enjoyed the fact that, in this physical theological scenario, ambiguity goes all the way to the ground floor. There is a sense in which quantum non-locality does not change any of these physical conditions. Non-local "correlations" do not mean that physical objects or conventional mechanical causes can now be transmitted faster than the speed of light,21 and there is no point physically at which non-locality contradicts the second law of thermodynamics, pertaining to entropy. Nevertheless, non-locality does give us a new way, a physical way?Loomer could even call it a concrete way?of acknowledging the "unity that the totality possesses." Non-locality's web of correlated, entangled particles, revealing the universe itself as something very much like a single quantum system, is, in Loomer's perspective, theologically significant. No matter that this entangled web reveals nothing of the supreme being demanded by orthodox theology. A supreme being is not what Loomer's theology envisions or needs. The concept of "S-I-Z-E," summarized in the phrase, "the totality of the world, and whatever unity the totality possesses," is Loomer's rendering of theological transcendence, and a non-local universe paints a physical picture of that unity in a radically new way. Non-locality tells us that there is a type of cosmic interrelatedness that is not limited to propagation at light speed, and that there is a physical, mathematical basis for speaking of the universe holistically.22 Though a physicist might not see non-locality as theologically relevant, Loomer's definition of God surely is affirmed more dramatically in a universe which is non-local. Like Loomer, Whitehead invites us to view the cosmos as a single system, speaking of the "category of the ultimate" as the one, the many, and creativity, so that by creativity the many become one and each one contributes to the many; they are mutually constitutive.23 Regarding the findings of twentieth-century physics, Whitehead wrote, "The modern point of view is expressed in terms of energy, activity, 21 See The Non-Local Universe, 80. 22 Michael Epperson repeatedly uses the terms "holism" and "holistic" to describe the worldview of quantum theory; see Quantum Mechanics and the Philosophy of A. N. Whitehead (New York: Fordham University Press, 2004), 164-65. 23 A. N. Whitehead, Process and Reality, 21.</page><page sequence="10">268 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy and the vibratory differentiations of space-time. Any local agitation shakes the whole universe."24 Clearly a non-local natural order exemplifies Whitehead's Category of the Ultimate in much the same way that it contributes to Loomer's notion of "Size" or "whatever unity the totality possesses." However, there are important theological differences between Whitehead and Loomer. For present purposes, the significant difference is that Whitehead identifies God not with the totality of the concrete world but with an aspect of the world?namely, with whatever may be said to furnish directionality or coordinated purpose to the on-going interplay between the one and the many.25 In Science and the Modern World (1925), Whitehead speaks of God as "the principle of concretion,"26 the guiding principle by which abstractions are ordered or "graded" according to their relevance as aims for ingression into actual occasions. In Process and Reality (1929), the "ontological principle" is introduced, requiring that mere abstractions cannot function independently as causes, so that God must be re-defined not as a principle but as an actual entity.27 It is also in Process and Reality that God is described in the threefold terms of "primordial," "consequent," and "superjective" natures, with most of the book's focus on the primordial nature. In Adventures of Ideas (1933) Whitehead moves on, virtually abandoning the primordial, consequent, and superjective terminology for a doctrine of God as "the divine Eros," a metaphysical function or ontological structure by which lures for feeling are provided for the beginning phase of each occasion.28 "The initial phase of each fresh occasion represents the issue of a struggle within the past for objective existence beyond itself. The determinant of the struggle is the supreme Eros incarnating itself as the first phase of the individual subjective aim in the new process of actuality."29 Thus Whitehead's various books present an assortment of ideas about God which may 24 Whitehead, Modes of Thought (New York: The Free Press, 1966 [1938]), 138. 25 For a brief summary of Whitehead's "theology," see Religion in the Making (New York: Meridian Books, 1960 [Macmillan, 1926]), Ch.

One theological premise that is present throughout Whitehead's books is his functional naturalism?that God is viewed as a dimension of the observed cosmological or ontological structures of nature, not as something "more-than" nature or as a supplement or counter-balance to nature. Whitehead's naturalism does not embrace theological personalism?a God who is a distinct Being, or who has a Mind or a Will. In our present attempt to relate quantum theory to Whitehead's philosophy, God is not to be thought of as an ontologically distinct being but as a name designating an activity or pattern manifest in the initial phase of each occasion.30 Sometimes Whitehead's language does sound personalistic. For example, he uses masculine pronouns when speaking of God and occasionally uses verbs in a way that makes it sound as if God were taking action deliberately.31 However, in the passages where Whitehead is focused specifically on the divine activity, God is depicted not as a Being who acts on an event-by-event basis but as a metaphysical function pertaining intrinsically to each actual occasion. I have examined this issue more fully elsewhere.32 At any rate, even in Process and Reality, which comes closer to theological personalism than any other of his major books, Whitehead maintains a non personalistic, fiinctionalistic naturalism. Thus the initial stage of the aim is rooted in the nature of God, and its completion depends on the self-causation of the subject-superject. This function of God is analogous 30 I view this position as being in substantive agreement with Whitehead's view of God as the "non-temporal actual entity"; see Process and Reality, 32 (47-48, original ed.). By denying that God is "a being" I am not denying that God is an actual entity?after all, actual entities are processes, not static things. What I do deny is that God is an "enduring object" or a "serially-ordered society of occasions" which exists through time and which may therefore be separated spatio-temporally to various degrees from other occasions, thus vitiating true "mutual immanence." 31 For example, Process and Reality, 164 (248, original pagination), Whitehead says repeatedly that God "decides," but it is obvious that Whitehead is not referring literally to a person who ponders a situation during a period of time. 321 develop this point in my article, "A Functional-Empirical Approach to the 'Whitehead Without God' Debate," presented at the 1990 Conference of the Highlands Institute, and printed as Chapter 4 in New Essays in Religious Naturalism, ed.

Axel (Macon: Mercer University Press, 1993), 33-47.</page><page sequence="12">270 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy to the remorseless working of things in Greek and in Buddhist thought. The initial aim is the best for that impasse. But if the best be bad, then the ruthlessness of God can be personified as At?, the goddess of mischief. The chaff is burnt. What is inexorable in God, is valuation as an aim towards 'order'; and 'order' means society permissive of actualities with patterned intensity of feeling arising from adjusted contrasts. ... In this way there is constituted the concrescent subject in its primary phase with its dipolar constitution, physical and mental, indissoluble. If we prefer the phraseology, we can say that God and the actual world jointly constitute the character of the creativity for the initial phase of the novel concrescence.33 Thus the primary phase [of each actual occasion] is a hybrid physical feeling of God, in respect to God's conceptual feeling which is immediately relevant to the universe 'given' for that concrescence .... In this sense, God can be termed the creator of each temporal actual entity. But the phrase is apt to be misleading by its suggestion that the ultimate creativity of the universe is to be ascribed to God's volition. The true metaphysical position is that God is the aboriginal instance of this creativity, and is therefore the aboriginal condition which qualifies its action.34 It is easy to find the influence of Plato in Whitehead, and there is a tendency among some Whitehead analysts?both supporters and detractors?to regard Whitehead as a kind of crypto-Platonist, smuggling in Plato's Forms or Ideas as "eternal objects"35 and God as 33 Whitehead, Process and Reality, 244-45, corrected ed. (373-374, originai ed.). Axiologically, this reference to the ruthlessness of God sounds almost Loomeresque; but ontologically, as we have noted, Whitehead's position is quite distinct from Loomer's. 34 Process and Reality, 225 corrected ed. (343-344, original). 35 For example, in his analysis of the theory of prehensions, Ivor Ledere mistakenly equates "prehension" and "perception" and then concludes on this basis that</page><page sequence="13">Vol. 27, Nos. 2 &amp; 3, May/September 2006 271 the deliberative teleological Agent who is their metaphysical purveyor. But Whitehead distances himself from Plato on precisely this issue, stating plainly that "Plato grounded these derivations from God upon his will; whereas metaphysics requires that the relationships of God to the World should lie beyond the accidents of will, and that they be founded upon the necessities of the nature of God and the nature of the World."36 The phrase used by Whitehead to describe this functional naturalistic God is mutual immanence?1 "The key to metaphysics is the doctrine of mutual immanence, each side lending to the other a factor necessary for its reality."38 In order to appreciate fully the relevance of quantum non locality to a Whiteheadian concept of theological transcendence, it is necessary to understand several basic points at which Whitehead's philosophy was influenced by twentieth-century physics. This of course is a subject for book-length treatment. A notable recent effort in this direction is Michael Epperson's Quantum Mechanics and the Philosophy of Alfred North Whitehead?9 Though Epperson's book has much in common with the present article, there are major differences; especially, (1) Epperson attempts to develop a precise, one-to-one "correlation" between quantum theory and Whitehead's ontology, analyzing quantum "state evolution" in terms of Whitehead's "phases of concrescence" and nine "categoreal obligations,"40 whereas I present the parallels between Whitehead's philosophy and quantum mechanics only as conceptual similarities; (2) Epperson relies more heavily than I do on the criteria of "logic" and "coherence,"41 so that his method is more rationalistic, while my approach intends to be empirical; and (3) Epperson ignores theology deliberately,42 while the present article has an obvious theological focus. At present, space does not permit a Whitehead's theory succumbs to "a Neoplatonic doctrine of Ideas."

It will suffice to provide a short outline of four conceptual similarities between relativity and quantum mechanics on the one hand, and Whitehead's metaphysics on the other. (1) In contemporary physics the absolute space and absolute time of Newton are relinquished in favor of the four-dimensional space time of H. Minkowski and Einstein, which requires the use of four variables?say, x, y, z, and t?to specify an entity's relation to other entities. The fact that time is included inseparably with space as a "continuum" supports Whitehead's fundamental doctrine that enduring objects are not just inert "stuff persisting through the passage of time, but consist instead of "routes" of "serially ordered societies" of occasions.43 Accordingly in Whitehead's philosophy processes replace static matter as the basis of ontology. Quantum theory of course also supports the abandonment of nineteenth-century materialism. Even in 1925 Whitehead had noted the quantum idea that the essence of matter is vibratory,44 and W. Heisenberg himself stated that, "Modern atomic theory is thus essentially different from that of antiquity in that it no longer allows any reinterpretation or elaboration to make it fit into a na?ve materialistic concept of the universe. For atoms are no longer material bodies in the proper sense of the word . . . ."45 (2) The Lorentz equations which were used by Einstein in his explication of the special theory of relativity reveal that there is no passage of time for objects traveling at the speed of light. This represents one of the "paradoxes of relativity," that, for example, a photon which from an observer's perspective takes 8/4 minutes to pass from the sun to the earth does not experience time at all internally, despite the fact that the same photon is associated with a certain wavelength and a certain frequency of vibration. This seeming paradox bears a striking resemblance to Whitehead's idea that the phases of concrescence?an actual occasion's internal constitution?are not 43 Whitehead mentions Minkowski in this regard in Essays in Science and Philosophy, 334-35. 44 Whitehead, Science and the Modern World, 36, paperback. 45 Werner Heisenberg, "Ideas of the Natural Philosophy of Ancient Times in Modern Physics," in Philosophical Problems of Quantum Physics (Woodbridge, CT: Ox Bow Press, 1979 [first published in Die Antike, Vol. XIII]), 55-56.

In other words, the notion of non-temporal process, essential to Whitehead's ontology and yet treated by some commentators as if it were esoteric or improbable,47 actually finds physical exemplification in the everyday phenomenon of radiant energy. My point is not that Whitehead viewed a photon as a literal example of a single actual entity, but that the general idea of non temporal process receives validation in the physical example of the propagation of light.48 (3) Whitehead divided the analysis of actual occasions into two modes?genetic analysis, pertaining to an occasion's internal phases of concrescence; and coordinate analysis, pertaining to the external physical-temporal transitions between actual occasions.49 The former has to do with an actual occasion's internal experience of itself, and the latter with the occasion's influence on its environment. This division very closely resembles the celebrated division which must be made in quantum mechanics between the thing being investigated?say, a photon or an electron?and the experimental apparatus being used to investigate it. We have already mentioned the problem of the ambiguous boundary between object and apparatus in our discussion of the uncertainty principle. The details of the matter are too complicated to consider here,50 but it is important to understand that this ambiguity is not merely a consequence of inadequate equipment but rather a 46 Whitehead, Process and Reality, 283 corrected ed. (pp. 433-34, original). 47 There has been ample scholarly debate as to how the phases of concrescence may be non-temporal and still occur in order. William Christian concludes that the order of the phases must be a sui generis type of priority, a suggestion which Donald Sherburne views as problematic. See Sherburne, A Key to Whitehead's Process and Reality (Bloomington: Indiana Univ. Press, 1966), 38. See also Robert Neville, "Genetic Succession, Time, and Becoming," and Lewis Ford, "Genetic and Coordinate Division Correlated," both in Process Studies I, 3 (Fall 1971): 194-209. Ford's article seems not to see that an entity?for example, a photon?may exhibit temporal duration from an external standpoint while still being non-temporal internally, even though it is associated with vibration. 48 Whitehead acknowledged the wave-particle dual nature of radiant energy, and seems to have viewed photons as serially ordered routes or societies of occasions.

The insight that external equipment cannot be used to test an entity until after that entity has made a "choice," or else when the equipment itself cannot help but force the entity to make a choice,52 is a notion in quantum theory which offers itself readily to Whiteheadian interpretation and which parallels Whitehead's distinction between genetic and coordinate ontological analysis. (4) The three preceding affinities between physics and Whitehead's philosophy lay the groundwork for a fourth and, for present purposes, most important affinity?namely, the similarities between the correlations which exist among entangled particles, and Whitehead's doctrine of hybrid physical prehensions, by which conceptualities or abstractions are conveyed from one actual entity to another.53 As Whitehead's terminology suggests, hybrid physical prehensions are a hybrid between purely physical prehensions, which are essentially the transmission of mechanical or efficient causation, and conceptual prehensions, which are prehensions of eternal objects. The quantum correlations which exist between entangled particles resemble hybrid physical prehensions because (a) the correlations exist between physical particles, and yet (b) the correlations are apparently 51 See Niels Bohr, "Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?," in Causality and Complementarity: Volume IV of the Philosophical Writings of Niels Bohr, 75-76; and J. S. Bell's engaging "Six Possible Worlds of Quantum Mechanics," ch. 20 in Speakable and Unspeakable in Quantum Mechanics, esp. 188-89. 52 See the discussion by Nadeau and Kafatos of "the Two-Slit Experiment," 46-51 ; and the similar discussion by Brian Greene, The Elegant Universe (New York: Vintage Books, 1999), 108-16. 53 David Griffin relates the Special Theory of Relativity to the distinction between a temporal and a non-temporal God, mentioning hybrid physical prehensions, in "Hartshorne, God, and Physics," Process Studies Vol. 21, No. 2 (Summer 1992), 85 112, but Griffin's article predates the most recent publications concerning non-local correlations and tends to discount "action at a distance" as unfeasible. Epperson holds that non-local correlations are a precise example of hybrid physical prehensions, though I believe Epperson over-emphasizes the role of the mental pole, and he repeatedly errs by associating the physical pole strictly with the first phase of concrescence and mental pole strictly with the later phases: Quantum Physics and the Philosophy of A.N.

Thus, though it seems doubtful that many physicists would put it quite this way, the non-local correlations among entangled particles suggest that these particles have some capacity to traffic in information which is mathematical or abstract in character.55 But a "capacity to traffic in information" sounds very much like Whitehead's doctrine that every actual entity has a mental as well as a physical pole, for what we are talking about is not "information" in the form of mere mechanical or physical causation but the communication of facts about other particle-like entities.56 This brings us to another way in which hybrid physical prehensions resemble quantum correlations, namely, that neither hybrid physical prehensions nor non-local correlations are rigidly deterministic in their effects. Though non-local correlations seem to convey very definite information, such as the specific quantum numbers of each electron in an atom,57 they do not physically control the precise position or momentum of any particle. In this regard, correlations are more like final causes than efficient causes, more nearly persuasive than coercive. As we contemplate the resemblances between non-local correlations and Whitehead's hybrid physical prehensions, it should immediately be noted that in Whitehead's system, hybrid physical prehensions are how actual entities prehend God.58 In other words, God exists in the world in the form of hybrid physical prehensions, constitutive of the first phase of each occasion. This, in essence, is the 54 The claim that non-local correlations are not transmitted by a physical intermediary seems reasonable because (a) the correlated particles do not experience any loss of either matter or energy, and (b) the correlations appear to be instantaneous, which could not be true if they were conveyed either by matter or energy. Indeed, the whole idea of non-locality is essentially a denial of local mediation. 55 This question is addressed, if not very conclusively, by the eminent physicist Richard Feynman in The Character of Physical Law (New York: Modern Library, 1994 [1st ed. 1965]), especially in chapter 2. 56 Whitehead himself acknowledged that hybrid physical prehensions might be transmitted without contiguous intermediaries; see Process and Reality, 307-08 (468 70, original pagination). See also the article by Griffin cited in note 53, supra. 57 Presumably the correlations do not convey actual "numbers" as we would conceive of them but rather whatever the functional or ontological equivalent of numerical relationships may be at the quantum level. 58 Whitehead, Process and Reality, 225, corrected ed.

(377, original ed.).</page><page sequence="18">276 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy point at which quantum non-locality may be viewed as an indication of theological transcendence for a Whiteheadian doctrine of God. Non local correlations provide a physical example whose characteristics parallel the characteristics of the mode by which Whitehead's God influences or "creates" the world. In making this claim I emphasize again that Whitehead's God is not a Being who wills certain outcomes, but an activity taking place in the initial phase of each occasion. This divine activity is one whereby potentialities are graded in their relevance so that they become suitable as aims for specific occasions. Whitehead regarded this ordering not as a conjectural hypothesis but as an observable fact?the fact of "the rise of civilization, and the tenderness of mere life itself, in a world which superficially is founded upon the clashings of senseless compulsion."59 Explaining this fact is what Whitehead viewed as the chief task of philosophical theology. I certainly am not claiming that non-local correlations are really the same thing as the Primordial Nature of God. Methodologically, I am not seeking to establish a one-to-one correspondence between quantum mechanics and Whitehead's metaphysics; while there are points of similarity between the two, it is important to recognize that there are also points of dissimilarity. On the other hand, however, neither am I posing a mere analogy between the two. What I am asserting is that ontologically, quantum entanglement and Whitehead's explanation of the Divine provision of initial aims share a common metaphysical basis in hybrid physical prehensions. Though the details differ significantly, the ordering activity of Whitehead's God is in principle not so very different from the non-local correlations which lead to a type of structure or organization among the particles in a quantum system. In the context of our present discussion, then, the most important thing about quantum non-locality is that it offers testable, physical evidence of something that many have heretofore found most difficult to conceive of in Whitehead's God, namely, a type of relation which is non-temporal, uninterrupted, unmediated, and instantaneous across the entire universe. Such a concept might at one time have seemed highly improbable. Now it is an established fact. It is neither necessary nor even advisable to inquire at this point as to how the technical concepts and neologisms of Process and Reality 59 Whitehead, Adventures of Ideas, 170, paperback ed.</page><page sequence="19">Vol. 27, Nos. 2 &amp; 3, May/September 2006 277 might be used to "explain" quantum non-locality. The conclusion being advanced here is simply that a non-local universe is more hospitable to a Whiteheadian notion of theological transcendence than an exclusively "local" universe would be, not only at the general point of affirming a type of universal holism, but also at the specific point of offering empirical evidence for the type of hybrid physical prehension that Whitehead associated with the function of God. Such a comparison does not mean that God is the "mental pole" of the World or that there is a cosmic Mind or that the unimaginable vastness of the universe is really inconsequential, either physically or theologically. It does mean that certain aspects of cosmic holism may be more readily affirmed. Comparing non-local correlations with the function of the Primordial Nature of God suggests a means of addressing one of the chief problems of a Whiteheadian theology, namely, the question of how an ever-concrescing divine entity could provide initial aims or lures for feeling for concrescing finite occasions everywhere. Since the phases of concrescence are themselves not temporal, neither is it appropriate to view God's provision of initial aims as a temporal activity. Thus, regarding time and causality, God's provision of initial aims is more like the correlations between entangled particles than like a light signal traveling from one place to another.61 I submit that the idea of non-local correlations makes it easier to understand why Whitehead originally proposed that God is the non-temporal actual entity. Viewing God as a single, non-temporal actual entity avoids the problem of making God a temporal (serially-ordered) being whose causal influence across the universe cannot, then, be instantaneous because it cannot be transmitted faster than the speed of light.62 The feasibility of likening non-local correlations to God's provision of initial aims hinges upon the reader's willingness to agree that there is indeed something like a "mental pole" characterizing even sub-atomic phenomena. Among those who feel skeptical about process 60 This is the approach taken by Epperson in Quantum Physics and the Philosophy of A. N. White head. 61 I owe much of the phrasing here to Don Crosby in a response to an early draft of this paper, April 2005. 62 Charles Hartshorne considers this problem, taking a contrasting approach to the one in the present paper, in "Bell's Theorem and Stapp's Revised View of Space-Time," Process Studies 7, no. 3 (1977): 184-87.</page><page sequence="20">278 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy philosophy, the Whiteheadian doctrine of pan-mentalism frequently constitutes the major hurdle. Some see no persuasive evidence for such mentality in non-living things, and others suspect that the requirement that all actual occasions must be able to entertain eternal objects is a back door by which cosmology is tricked into admitting some kind of Cosmic Teleology. But, remembering Whitehead's own statement that he arrived at his philosophy not by pondering psychology or physiology but by considering the discoveries of twentieth-century physics, I suggest that it is more instructive to liken the actual entity's mental pole not to human experience but to the functional attributes of sub-atomic particles. For example, protons and neutrons are now believed to be composed of quarks.64 Quarks come in "colors"?red, green, and blue.65 In physics, these colors and other particle properties such as "spin" are not to be taken as literal descriptions but as functionalistic terms designating how the particles in question respond to certain macroscopic physical conditions. Further, even in the earliest conversations about quantum theory, physicists found it necessary (or at least much more convenient) to speak of particles as if they had some kind of mental facility. Thus Rutherford once asked Bohr, "how does an electron decide what frequency it is going to vibrate at when it passes from one stationary state to another? It seems to me that you would have to assume that the electron knows beforehand where it is going to stop."66 Whitehead's doctrine of the mental pole does not imply that things like electrons really "decide" or "know" things "beforehand," but that they have some natural capability of responding to abstractions, mainly in the form of mathematical conditions. Like the "color" of a quark, Whitehead's "mental pole" is simply a functional descriptor, not a way of psychologizing each actual entity. That the mental pole is also Whitehead's way of avoiding the mind-body dualism of Descartes, and explaining purpose and consciousness in higher organisms may be viewed in our present context simply as an added bonus. 63 As John Cobb has said, pan-mentalism is a more accurate term than pan-psychism. Whitehead nowhere claims that all actual entities have a "psyche" or a "soul." 64 The name "quark" was first applied to particles somewhat facetiously by physicist Murray Gell-Mann, who had discovered the term in James Joyce's Finnegan's Wake. There are six types of quark: up-quarks, down-quarks, charm quarks, strange quarks, top quarks, and bottom quarks.

Faith and Practice The notions of theological transcendence suggested by Loomer and Whitehead have implications for actual faith and religious practice?and their respective implications diverge appreciably. Loomer's God, as the totality of the concrete universe, manifests a kind of absoluteness which Whitehead's God lacks. We have already noted that from a human perspective the goodness of Loomer's God is innately ambiguous. There is no conclusive evidence that the concrete universe seeks any consistent aims whatsoever. Especially, the universe does not appear consistently to seek the security and happiness of living creatures. Loomer's God is truly the Source of all life, but merely as the physical totality of all there is. Loomer's God simply is whatever the concrete totality is in each changing circumstance, irrespective of any praise or blame. In contrast, Whitehead conceives of God as a part of the world, centering around the organismic, whole-making activity of the natural order. This is not the entirety of the concrete universe, but an aspect of creativity. Whitehead's God is very much like the God of the classic teleological argument, of which Kant wrote, 'The utmost, therefore, that the argument can prove is an architect of the world who is always very much hampered by the adaptability of the material in which he works, not a creator of the world to whose idea everything is subject."67 Along these lines, at the conclusion of Process and Reality Whitehead famously described God as "the great companion?the fellow sufferer who understands."68 Western ideas of God may generally be divided into two categories?those which primarily affirm God's power, and those which primarily affirm God's goodness. In Christian theology this division is apparent in the schism between Calvin and Arminius during the Reformation period, between Augustine and Pelagius during late antiquity, and between Paul and James in the New Testament. In each case the orthodox side (or in the case of Paul and James, the side which eventually became orthodox) chose to elevate the majesty and 67 Immanuel Kant, Critique of Pure Reason, trans. N.

(532, original).</page><page sequence="22">280 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy supremacy of God over the creaturely value of human achievement. The gist of this orthodoxy is not, as is sometimes supposed, to deny human free will, but to uphold divine sovereignty. Though on most religious issues Loomer's position is anything but orthodox, his concept of God is clearly in the power category. His theology lacks the supreme being of conventional Western faiths, but in Loomer's God of "Size," the religious equivalent of sovereignty is still present. As in orthodox monotheism the main religious virtues are awe, submission, and obedience, for a theology such as Loomer's the main religious virtues might be the closely related experiences of wonder, acceptance, and serenity. In Loomer's orientation, as in the orientation of Calvin, Augustine, and Paul, it comes naturally to say with Job, "Shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil?"70 Even as we affirm our own individuality and freedom, we see that our actions are a relatively small part of an enormous system of causes and effects, and that we typically overestimate the ultimate importance of our own decisions. God, as the Whole, determines the final outcome. It is not always recognized by liberals that there is profound religious value in this faith stance.71 In contrast to Loomer's position, Whitehead's God is clearly in the value-producing category. Though it would be inaccurate to depict Whitehead as supporting Arminianism or Pelagianism?theological positions which are circumscribed by traditional personalism?it is nevertheless true that Whitehead's God is a God who proffers "lures for feeling" in a manner not altogether unlike the divine moral suasion articulated by the historic proponents of free will. As Whitehead himself said, "The power of God is the worship he inspires."72 Thus the God of process theology is ordinarily celebrated as a God not of coercion but of persuasion. 69 Anyone who doubts Paul's position on this matter should review the ninth chapter of Romans. 70 Job 2:10b RSV. 71 An exception is the liberal theologian William Henry Bernhardt, who received his Ph.D. from the University of Chicago in 1928 after studying with Gerald Birney Smith and others. Bernhardt taught for years at The Iliff School of Theology, where, in contrast to most liberal theologians, he propounded the view that religion is not mainly a basis for social reform or ethical activity but a response to the "non-manipulables" of life which are beyond human control. 72 Whitehead, Science and the Modern World, 192 (276, hardback).</page><page sequence="23">Vol. 27, Nos. 2 &amp; 3, May/September 2006 281 We can enlarge our understanding of the differences between Loomer and Whitehead by examining the different approaches suggested by their respective orientations to certain traditional religious attitudes or activities. (A) Regarding prayer, in a Whiteheadian theology, though God cannot be said to hear prayers in the traditional anthropomorphic fashion, prayer may be viewed as a means of opening the self to the enduring, whole-making propensities of nature and life. A Whiteheadian viewpoint can affirm that there is an intentionality larger than ourselves with which prayer may make us feel more closely connected. In Loomer's theology, prayers of praise, allegiance, acceptance, and loyalty would be the most obviously valid styles. Prayers seeking forgiveness, redemption, and renewal would have to be phrased carefully in order to avoid the suggestion of a personalized authority figure. (B) Regarding ethical motivation, in a Whiteheadian theology any efforts that are perceived to be value-producing, reformative, and renewing might be interpreted as attempts to ally oneself with God and therefore as having religious meaning. For Loomer, if God is the All, it becomes problematic to ascribe specific ethical or social goals to God. However, one may still discover ethical motivation in the feeling that within the Whole it is one's natural role to work for the commonweal. (C) Regarding feelings of kinship with God, in a Whiteheadian view, a God who labors, even non-personally and non-consciously,73 to create, to heal, to bring together, has much in common with our own human struggles and goals. For Loomer, it is perhaps more difficult for us as persons to identify with the whole cosmos, though the recognition that it is this cosmos which produces, shelters, and nurtures us may engender some feelings of kinship.74 As we appraise the theological differences between Loomer and Whitehead, it may occur to us, if we are religious at all, that there are aspects of both perspectives which are appealing. After all, some circumstances call for a God who urges us forward towards growth, and other circumstances call for a God who inspires composure in the face 731 am aware that in one place, Whitehead describes God as conscious, but he is then speaking only of the consequent nature {Process and Reality, 345; [524 original pagination]). At present I am referring to the function of the primordial nature, which Whitehead stipulates is not conscious. Process and Reality, 343-44 (521-22, original pagination). 74 The religious applicability of Whitehead's idea of God has been explored more thoroughly by Charles Milligan in "Religious Values of Whitehead's God Concept," The Iliff Review, IX, 3 (Fall 1952).</page><page sequence="24">282 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy of the inevitable. In Reinhold Niebuhr's well known words, sometimes one needs to change what can be changed, and at other times when one needs to accept what cannot be changed?and, at all times, one would wish for the wisdom to recognize the difference between the two. Whitehead's God is more relevant to a style of faith that seeks to change what can be changed, and Loomer's God is more relevant to seeking to accept what cannot be changed. Is there any way to draw on both orientations without simply lapsing into inconsistency and wishful thinking? In the context of our discussion of quantum mechanics, there is a concept so obvious that it almost forces itself into our attention, namely, Niels Bohr's notion of complementarity. Beginning even before the time of Newton, scientists had debated whether light is propagated in the form of particles or waves. In 1928 Bohr and Heisenberg argued that an adequate description requires the inclusion of both wave and particle models. The two models seem to be mutually exclusive, but Bohr and Heisenberg proposed that this is due to the present tendency of human understanding to base our concepts of sub atomic processes on our observation of macroscopic objects. They asserted that at the atomic level wave and particle models may be understood as complementary. Complementarity is still most often associated with the wave-particle dual nature of electromagnetic radiation, but it may be applied to other physical realities which are in some sense unitary and yet also paired or dualistic, such as space-time and matter-energy.75 Complementarity suggests an innate open-endedness or ambiguity regarding all human knowledge, which Bohr tended to affirm. As Bohr himself explained it, "Evidence obtained under different experimental conditions cannot be comprehended within a single picture, but must be regarded as complementary in the sense that only the totality of the phenomena exhausts the possible information about the objects."76 Though Bohr himself proposed applying the idea of complementarity to fields other than physics, in his more cautious moments he recognized the error of too zealously applying the idea of complementarity to dichotomies when they were actually just contradictory, such as "mechanism or vitalism" and "free will or causal 75 Nadeau and Kafatos, 91-92. 76 Martin J. Klein, "Bohr, Niels," Encyclopaedia Britannica, 15th ed. (1975), Vol. 2, 1203.</page><page sequence="25">Vol. 27, Nos. 2 &amp; 3, May/September 2006 283 necessity." Bohr was anxious to refute the criticism that complementarity at bottom represented nothing more than a kind of "mysticism" that was "incompatible with the true spirit of science."78 A spirit of caution concerning complementarity is fitting, for it is indeed tempting to apply the concept too broadly.79 Ian Barbour proposes several criteria for limiting the application of complementarity in fields other than physics, including: (1) The application of complementarity must be analogical rather than inferential. In other words, complementarity must be used to elucidate existing observations, not to infer new truths. (2) Complementarity should be understood as referring to different ways of analyzing a single entity, not as an attempt to harmonize or unify two separate things. (3) The idea of complementarity should not be taken as a veto to the search for 80 unity. In light of criteria such as these, can complementarity be regarded as a means of harmonizing the opposing views of theological transcendence drawn from Loomer and Whitehead? At first it would seem that the answer is no, for the two concepts in question?God as the totality of the world, and God as a particular aspect of the world? pertain to two different things. And yet, what is the theological basis of the difference? Loomer's overall worldview is much like Whitehead's, and though Loomer disagreed with several of the details of Whitehead's thought, at a religious level the main point of their divergence is simply the question of whether to think of God as part of the whole, or as the whole. Thus their theological disagreement is not so much about what the world is like but about how the world may best be interpreted, religiously. And when we are speaking about how to interpret a single concept?the world?we are dealing with a subject where the notion of complementarity may legitimately be applied. Perhaps, then, it is not erroneous to suggest that Loomer's God and Whitehead's God are two complementary ways of thinking of one religious object?the World in 77 Bohr, "Causality and Complementarity," chapter 5 in Causality and Complementarity, 88. 78 Ibid., 83. 79 For example, Nadeau and Kafatos, 121-23, press the idea that female and male gender differences may be understood as complementary, despite the obvious fact that female and male are not simply two ways of looking at a single phenomenon. 80 Ian Barbour, Issues in Science and Religion (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1966), 292 93.</page><page sequence="26">284 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy its tentative invitation to wholeness, and the World in whatever totality or Size it may be said to possess. If, in the spirit of Loomer and Bohr, we are allowed to conclude with a question, we may ask whether, if Loomer himself had known of the experiments validating non-locality, he might have had greater sympathy for Whitehead's position?for quantum non-locality and quantum theory as a whole seem to support Whitehead's conviction that making a neat separation between the mental and the physical, or between the abstract and the concrete, is not so easy as Loomer sometimes seems to think. Even such a physicist as J. S. Bell, who was no fan of philosophy and could speak, if partly in jest, of metaphysics as a "lamentable addiction,"81 nevertheless affirmed that mind "has a central place in the ultimate nature of reality," though, in words that Loomer would probably have appreciated, Bell remained "very doubtful that contemporary physics has reached so deeply down that that idea will soon be professionally fruitful."82 81 Bell, "Are There Quantum Jumps?" in Speakable and Unspeakable in Quantum Mechanics, 202. 82 Bell, "Six Possible Worlds of Quantum Mechanics," in Speakable and Unspeakable in Quantum Mechanics, 194.</page></plain_text>
