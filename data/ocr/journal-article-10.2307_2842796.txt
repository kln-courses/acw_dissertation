<plain_text><page sequence="1">( 173 ) THE RELATIONS BETWEEN MEN AND ANIMALS IN SARAWAK. BY CHARLES HOSE, Resident of the Baram District, and W. MCDOUGALL, Fellow of St. John's College, Cambridge. [PRESENTED MAY 28TH, 1901. WITH PLATES XIV, XV.] WHEN in the year 1898 we travelled together through every part of the Baram District and began to put together the materials for this paper, one of us had already lived for more than fourteen years among the tribes of the district, and by constant observation and inquiry had become familiar with and had written down from time to time careful notes of many of their customs and beliefs. Among these were a large number that showed how all the various tribes hold certain animals and plants in peculiar regard, how the conduct of the people is to a great extent guided by well-established systems of augury, and how their relations to many of the creatures among which they live are regulated by strict rules and prohibitions. We determined, therefore, to make as complete as possible our knowledge of the animal- and plant-superstitions of the various tribes, and believing that by so doing we should find evidence that many of them are survivals from a system of totem-worship now decayed, we kept this possibility constantly in mind. In making these more systematic inquiries we enijoyed the great advantage of being guided in our work by that very considerable mass of information previously collected by one of us with a mind entirely free from preconceived ideas as to what should be expected. We would point out that, since one of us has lived for so long on terms of inltimacy and friendship with members of most of the tribes and is familiar with the various languages spoken by them, and since the people seldom showed any reluictance to exhibit and explain their customs to us and were usually pleased to allow us to take part in the ceremonies and rites, a considerable weight, as negative evidence, must be allowec to our failure to find traces of any particular custom or institution. We shall first describe in some detail all that we have been able to learn of the animal-superstitions of the Kenyahs, the tribe with which we are most familiar. We shall then give a condensed accouint of similar customs anld beliefs as they occur anmong other tribes of the district, describing more particularly those peculiar to the different tribes, and especially those connected with the " Nyarong" or Spirit-helper of the Sea-Dayaks. We shall conclude with a short, discussion of the problems suiggested by our observations, the problems of the origin and meaning of the various customs.</page><page sequence="2">Journal of the Anthropologica Institute, Vol. XXXI, Plate X1fV. * AFTER P1fbTo. 1 WOODEN MODEL OF A HORNBILL, MADE BY IBANS, AND USED IN PEACE-MAKING CEREMONIES.

According tQ their own tradition they came into the basin of the Baram from the east some hundred and fifty years ago. From that time until the last few years they, in conjunction with the Kayans, an allied tribe, which seems to have migrated to the Baram a little later than the Keiiyahs, had maintained a dominion of terror over all the neighbouring peoples, and they have had extremely little intercourse of a friendly nature with any more civilised folk, whether Malay, Chinese, or European. At the present time they are settled in village-commnunities thinly scattered on the banks of the tributaries and upper parts of the Barani river. Each community, consisting of thirty, forty, fifty or more families, lives in a single long house massively built of hewln timber, and raised on great piles of iron-wood twenty or thirty feet above the river bank on which it stands. Each coinmmunity is ruled over by a chief whose authority is usually very coulsiderable, and in the case of a chief of ability and strong character is always very great. Their principal food is rice, which they cultivate assiduously. Their domiestic animals are the pig, the fowl and the dog, and the two formier they eat not infrequently. By hunting and fishing they add to the variety of their food, but these pursuits, are regarded as sports rather than as means to obtain tlhe necessaries of life. They are skilful and artistic handicraftsmen in ironwork, basket-makino, wood-carving and rattan- lashing, and they make rude earthen vessels for cooking. Their clothing was chiefly, and still is in many cases, of bark-cloth. Their weapons are the sword and spear and blow-pipe with poisoned darts. They are an extremely warlike people, and are ever ready to defend themselves against attack or to mnake war on others, either in following up some blood-feud or in order to secure the human heads that play an essential part in some of their rites. They believe in a beneficent Supreme Being and ill a great liumber of less powerful spirits. In fact, they may be said to attribute a soul or spirit to almylost every natural agent and to all living things, and they pay especial regard to those that seem most capable of affecting their welfare for good or ill. They feel themiselves to be surrounded on every hand by spiritual powers, which appear to them to be concentrated in those objects to which their attention is directed by practical needs; adapting a mode of expression famniliar to psychologists we may say that they have differentiated from a "continuum" of spiritual powers a number of spiritual agents with very various degrees of definiteness. Of these the less important are extremrely vaguely conceived, but are regarded as being able to bring harm to meni, who must therefore avoid giving offence to them and must propitiate them if they should by ill-chance have been offended. The more important, assuming individualised and anthropomorphic forms and definite functions, receive proper names, and axe in some cases represented by rude images, and becomne the recipients of prayer and sacrifice. The spirit of any object or</page><page sequence="5">Men a.nd Animals in Sarawak. 175 agent, or perhaps we should rather say the thing in its spiritual aspect, is usually denominated by prefixing the word "Balli" to the ordinary namne. Thus Balli Sungei (Sungei = river) is the spirit or god of the river, Balli Atap (Atap = roof) is the spirit or god who protects the household from harm of all sorts; a wooden image of him generally stands before the main entrance to the house. Ballingo is the god of thunder; Balli Bouin (bouin = pig) is the form of address to the spirit of any pig about to be sacrificed. More important than any of these is Balli Penyalong, the Supreme Being. To him the Kenyahs pray for guidance in important undertakings, while the women pray to Doh Penyalong, his wife. The Cult of the Hawk. Of the maniy animals that the Kenyahs dare not eat or kill those which most influence their conduct are the omen-birds, and among the omen-birds the common white-headed carrion-hawk (Haliaster intermedius) is by far the most imnportant. The Keniyahs always observe the movements of this hawk with keen interest, for by a well-established code of rules, they interpret his movements in the heavens as signs by which they must be guided in many matters of moment, especially in the conduct of warlike or any other dangerous expeditions.' The hawk is always spoken of and addressed as Balli :Flaki, and is formally consulted before any party of Kenyahs sets out from home for distant parts. To illustrate the formualities with which they read the omens we will transcribe here a passage from a journal kept by one of us. The occasion of the incidents described was the setting out of a large body of Kenyahs from the house of Tama Bulan, a chief who by his personal merits has attained to a position of great influence among the other Kenyah chiefs, and who has been confirmed in his authority by His Highness the Rajah of Sarawak. The object of the expedition was to visit and make peace with another great fighting tribe, the Madangs, who live in the remotest interior of Borneo. Taina Bulan, whose belief in the value of the omens has been slightly shaken, was willing to start without ceremonies and to make those powers, which he believed to protect us, responsible for himself and his people also. But the people had begged hinm not to neglect the traditional rites, and he had yielded to their wishes. "'At break of day, before I was up, Tama Bulan was washed by the women at the river's brink with water and the blood of pigs to purify him for his journey, and later in the morniing the people set to work to seeLk omens and a guarantee of their safety on the journey from the hawks that are so numerous here. A small shelter of sticks and leaves was made on the river-bank before the house, and the I We find that the practices of these people in connection with omens or auspices so closely resemble those of the early Romans that it seems worth while to draw attention to these resemblances, and we therefore quote in footnotes some passages from Dr. Smith's Dictzonary of Classical Antiquities, referring to the practice of the Romans: "in the most ancient times no transaction, whether private or public, was performed without consulting the auspicesy and hence arose the distinction of auspicia privata and asuspicsa publiCa."</page><page sequence="6">1 76 CHARLES HOSE AND W. MCDOUGALL.-1he iRelations betveem women having been sent to their rooms, three men of the upper classl sat under this leaf-shelter beside a small fire, and searched the sky for hawks. After sitting there silently for about an hour, the three men suddenly became animated; one of them took in his right hand a small chick and a stick frayed by mnany deep cuts with a knife and waved them repeatedly from left to right, at the same time pourinig out a rapid flood of words. They had caught sight of a hawk high up and far away before them, and they were trying to persuade it to fly towards the right. Presently the hawk, a tiny speck in the sky, sailed slowly out of sight behind a hill on the right, and the men settled themselves to watch for a second hawk which must fly towards the left, and a third which must circle round and round. In the course of about half an hour, two hawks had obligingly put in an appearance and behaved just as it was hoped and desired that they should behave; and so this part of this business was finished, and about a score of men butstled about preparing for the next act. They brought many fowls and several young pigs, and a bundle of long poles pointed at either end. Before the house stand upright two great boles of timber, and of either one the upper end is carved into a rude face and crowned with a brass gong (P1. XIV, 2). These are two images of the one Supreme Being, Balli Penyalong, and they seem to be at the same time the altars of the god. A tall young tree stripped of all but its topmost twigs, stands beside one of them, and is supposed to reach to heaven, or at least, by its greater proximity to the regions above, to facilitate intercourse. As to the meanino of this and many other features of these rites, it is impossible to form any exact idea, for the opinions of these people in such matters are hardly less vague and diversified than those of more civilized worshippers. Tama Bulan, in his character of high priest,2 took his stand before one of these images, while a nephew, one of the three men who had watched the hawks, officiated before the other and went through exactly the same ceremonies as his uncle, at the same tiine with him. Tama Bulan held a small bamboo water-vessel in his left hand and with a frayed stick in his right hand sprinkled some of the water on the image, all the time looking up into its face and rapidly repeating a set form of words. Presently he took a fowl, snipped off its head and sprinkled its blood upon the image, and so again with another and another fowl. Then he held a young pig while a follower gashed its throat, and, as the blood leapt out, he scattered it too on the image, while the score of men standing round about put their hands, some on him, some on one another, so that all were in contact, and joined in the prayer or incantation which he kept pouring forth in the same rapid mechanical fashion in which many a curate at home reads the church service. In the house, meanwhile, four boys were pounding at two big drumtis to keep away fromn the worshippers all sounds but the words of their own prayers.3 Then I "No one but a patrician could take the auspices." 2 "1 Romulus is represented to have been the best of augurs, and from him all succeeding augurs received the chief mark of their office." H"ence devices were adopted so that no ill-omened sound should be heard, such as blowing a trumpet during the sacrifice."</page><page sequence="7">'fen and Anim?zals in Sarawva,% 177 another fowl and another pig were sacrificed in similar fashion at either altar, ainl the second part of the rite was finished by the men sticking the carcases of the slaughtered beasts each one on the point of a pole, and fixing the poles upright in the earth before the images. " Tama Bulan now came up into the house to perform the third and last act. A pig was brought and laid bound upon the floor, and Tama Bulan, stooping, with a sword in his right hand, kept punching the pig gently behind the shoulder as though to keep its attention, and- addressed it with a rapid flow of words, each phrase beginning ' 0 Balli Bouin.' The pig's throat was then cut by an attendant, and Tama Bulan, standing up, diluted its blood with water and scattered it abroad over all of us as we stood round about him, while he still kept up the rapid patter of words. Then he pulled off the head of a fowl and concluded the rites by once more sprinkling us all with blood and water. Everyone seemed relieved and well satisfied to have got through this important business and to have secured protectors for all the party during the forthcoming journey. For the three hawks will watch over them and are held to have given them explicit guarantees of safety. The frayed stick that had figured so largely in the rites was stuck under the rafters of the roof among a row of others previously used, and there it will remain, a sign and a pledge of the piety of the people, as lonig as the house shall stand. And then as Tama Bulan, pretty well covered with blood, went away to wash himself, I felt as though I had just lived through a book of the Ilneid, and was about to follow Father AIneas to the shores of Latium." This elaborate rite, so well fitted to set agoing the speculative fancy of anyone acquainted with the writings of Robertson Smith and Messrs. Jevons and Frazer, was one of the first that we witnessed together. After giving all our facts we shall return to discuss some of the interesting questions raised by it, but it will be seen that we are far from having discovered satisfactory explanations of all its features. Obscure features to which we would direct attention are the use of the fire and the frayed stick, for these figure in almost all rites in which the omen- birds are consulted, or prayers and sacrifices inade. The Kenyahs seem to feel that the purpose of fire is to carry up the prayers to heaven by means of the ascending flame and smoke, in somewhat the same way as the tall pole planted by the side of the image of Balli Penyalong facilitates communion with the spirit; for they conceive him as dwelling somewhere above the earth. Omens are always sought in the way we have described before going out to attack an enemy, and if the expedition is successful the warriors bring home not only the heads of the slain enemy but also pieces of their flesh, which they fix upon poles before the house, one for each family, as a thank-offering to Balli Flaki for his guidance and protection. It seldom occurs that a hawk actually takes 'or eats these pieces of flesh, and that does not seem to be expected. Without favourable omens from the hawks, Kenyahs will not set out on any expedition, and even when they have secured them they still anxiously look out for further guidance and may be stopped or tuirned back at any time by unfavourable omens. Thus, should a hawk VOL. XXXI. N</page><page sequence="8">178 CHARLES HOSE AND W. McDOUGALL.-The Relationts between fly over their boat going in the same direction as themselves this is a good omen, but if one should fly towards them as they travel, and especially if - it should scream as it does so, this is a terribly bad omen, and only in case they can abtain other very favourable omens to counteract the impression made by it will they continue their journey. If one of a party dies on the journey, they will stop for one whole day for fear of offending Balli Flaki. If a hawk should scream just as they are about to deliver an attack, that means that some of the elder men will be killed in the battle. Balli Flaki is also consulted before sowing and harvesting the rice crop, but besides being appealed to publicly on behalf of the whole comnmunity, his aid may be sought privately by any man who wishes to injure another. For this purpose a man makes a rough wooden image in human form and retires to some quiet spot on the river bank, where he sets up a " tegulum," a horizontal pole supported about a yard above the ground by a pair of vertical poles. He lights a small fire beside the " tegulum," and taking a fowl in one hand, he sits on the ground behind it so- as to see through it a square patch of sky' and so waits until a hawk becomes visible upon this patch. As sooni as a hawk appears he kills the fowl and with a frayed stick smears its blood on the wooden image, saying, " Put fat in his mouth" (which means " Let his head be taken and fed with fat in the usual way "), and he puts a bit of fat in the mouth of the image. Then he strikes at the breast of the image with a small wooden spear and throws it into a pool of water reddened with red earth, and then takes it out and buries it in the ground. While the hawk is visible he waves it towards the left, for he knows that if it flies to the left he will prevail over his enemy, but that if it goes to the right his enemy is too strong for him. When a new house is built a wooden image of Balli Flaki with wings extended is put up before it anld an offering of mixed food is put on a little shelf before the image, and at times, especially after getting good omens from the hawks, it is offered bits of flesh anid is smeared with pig's blood. If the people have good luck in their new house they renew the image, but if not they usually allow it to fall into decay. If when a man is sitting down to a meal he espies a hawk in the heavens he will throw a morsel of food towards it, exclaiming, "Balli Flaki ! "' We have seen that during the formal consultation of the hawks the women are sent to their rooms. Nevertheless many women keep in the cupboards in which they sleep a wooden image of the hawk with a few hawk's feathers stuck upon it. If the woman falls sick she will take one of these feathers and waving it to and fro will say, " Tell the bad spirit that is making me sick that I have a feather of Balli Flaki," and when she recovers her health Balli Flaki has the credit of it. Although Kenyahs will not kill a hawk, they would not prevent us from "The person who has to take them (the auspices) first marked out with a wand . a division of the heavenis called 'templum,' . . . within which he intencded to make hi5 ebservationis."</page><page sequence="9">Men and Anirnctls in Sarawa/k. 1-79 shooting one if it stole their chickens, for they say that a hawk who will do that is a low-'class fellow, a cacd, in fact, for there are social grades among the hawks just as there are among themselves. Although the Kenyabs thus look to Balli Flaki to guide them and help themn in many ways and'express gratitude towards him, -we do not think that -they conceive of him as a single great spirit as some of the other tribes tend to do ; they rather look upon the hawks as messengers and intermediators between themselves and Balli Penyalong,' to which a certain undefined amount of power is delegated. - No doubt it is a' vulgar error with them, as in- the case of professors of other forms of belief, to forget in some degree the Supreme Being and to-direct their prayers and thanks almost exclusively to the subordinate power, which, having concrete forms, they cana more easily keep before their minds. - They regard favourable omens as given for their encouragement and bad omens as friendly warnings.2 We were told by one very intelligent Kenyah that 'he supposed that the haw-ks, having been so frequently sent by Balli Penyalong to give them warnings, had learnt how to do this of their own will, and that somnetimes they probably do give them warning or encouragement independently without being sent by him. All Kenyahs hold Balli Flaki in the same peculiar regard, and no individuals or sections of them claim to be especially favoured by him or claim to be relatec to him by blood or descent. Other Omen-Birds. Kenyahs obtain omens of less importance from several other birds. When favourable omens have been given by the hawks some prominent man is always sent out to sit on the river bank beside a small fire and watch and listen for these other birds. Their movements and cries are the signs which he interprets as omens confirming or weakening the import of those given by the hawks. Of these other omens the most regarded are those given by the three varieties of the ,ppider-hunter (Ara.chnothera Chrysogenys, A. modesta, and A. Longirostris). All three varieties are known as " Sit " or " Isit." When travelling on the river the Kenyahs hope to see " Sit " fly across from left to right as they sit facing the bow of the canoe. When this happens they call out loudly, saying, " 0, Sit on the left haud Give us long life, help us in our undertaking, help us to find what we are seeking, make our enemies feeble." They usually stop their canoes, land on the bank, and after making a sinall fire, say to it, " Tell Sit to help us." Each man of the party will light a cigarette in order that he may have his own small fire, and will rnurmur some part at least of the usual formulas. After seeing " Sit" on their left, they like to see him again on their right side. 1 "It was from Jupiter mainly that the future was learnt, and the birds were regarded as his messengers." 2 "The Roman auspices were essentially of a practical nature; they gave Ino iniformation respecting the course of future events, they did not inform meni what was to happen, but simply t-aught them whether they were to do or not to do the matter purposed; they assigned no reason for the decision of Jupiter, they simply announced-yes or no." N 2</page><page sequence="10">180 CHAIRLES HoSE AND W. MCIDOUGALL.-Tlae Jelattions betwceen Next in importance to the spider-hunters are the three varieties of the trogan (Ilarpactes Diardi, U. Duvancelii, and H. kasumba). They like to hear the trogan calling quietly and sitting oni a tree to their left, but if he is on their rig,ht the omen is only a little less favourable.1 On hearing the trogan's cry they own it, as they say, by shouting to it and stopping to light a fire just as in the case of "Sit." Kieng, the woodpecker (Lepocestes pogpIhyro melas), has two niotes, one of which is of good, the other of bad omen. If they have secured good omens fronm the birds already melltioned they will then try to avoid hearing Kieng lest he should utter the note of evil omen, so they sing and talk and rattle their paddles on the sides of the boat. Other omen birds of less importance are Asi (C6arcineutes melanops), whose note warns them of difficulties in their path, and Ukang (Sasia abnornmis), whose note means good luck for them. Telajan, the crested rain-bird (Platylophus coronatuas), announces good luck by its call and warns of serious difficulties also. Kong, the hornbill (Anorrhinus comatats) gives omens of minor importance by his strainge deep cry. His handsome feathers, with their bold bars of blaclk and white, are worn oni war-coats and stuck in the war-caps by men who are tried warriors, but mlay not be worn by mere youths. The substance of the beak of the hornbill is sometimes carved inito the form of the canine tooth of the tiger-cat, and a pair of these is the most value(d kind of ear-ornamiient for nien. Only elderly men or men who have taken heads with their own hands may wear them. Onle of the popular dances consists in a comical imitation of the movements of the hornbill, but no special significance attaches to the dance; it seems to be done purely in a spirit of fun. Young hornbills are occasionally kept in the houLse as pets (cf. Plate XIV, 1). We know of no other bird that plays any part in the religiouis life of the Kenyahs or affects them in any pecuLliar manner. The Pig. All Kenyahs keep numerous domestic pigs, which roam beneath and about the house, picking up what garbage they can find to eke out the scanty meals of rice-dust anid chaff given them by the women. It seems that they seldom or never take to the jungle and become feral, although they are not confined in any way. These domestic pigs are not treated with any show of reverence, but rather with the greatest contumely, and yet the pig plays a part in almost all religious ceremonies and before it is slauightered apologies are always offered to it, and "It was only a few birds wlich could give auguries among the Romiais. They were divided into two classes, Oscines, those which gave auguries by singing or their voice; and Alites, those which gave auguries by their flight." "There were considerable varieties of omen according to the note of the Oscines or the place from which they uttered the note ; ancl sirnilarlv am-ong the Alites, according to the nature of their flight,"</page><page sequence="11">Mien and Antimeals in Sarawvak. 181 it is assured that it is not to be eaten. We have seen that, in the rites preparatory to an important and dangerous expedition, the chief was washed with pig's blood and water, and that young pigs were slain before the altar-post of Balli Pelnyalong and their blood was sprinkled on the post and afterwards upon all or most of the men of the household. It is probably true that Balli Penyalong is never addressed without the slaughter of one or more pigs, and also that no domestic pig is ever slaughtered without being charged beforehand with some message or prayer to Balli Penyalong which its spirit may carry up to him. But the most important function of the pig is the giving of information as to the future course of events by mieans of the markings on its liver.' Whenever it becomes specially interesting or important to ascertain the future course of events, when for example a household proposes to make war, or two parties are about to go through a peace-making ceremony, a pig is caught by the young rnen from among those beneath the house, and is brought anld laid with its feet lashed together before the chief in the great verandah of the house. And it would seem that the more important the ceremony the larger and the more numerous should be the pigs selected as victims. An attendant hands a burnino brand to the chief, and he, stooping over the pig, singes a few of its hairs, and then addressing the pig as 1' Balli Botiin," and gently punching it behind the shoulder as we have already depicted him, he pours out a rapid flood of words. The substance of his address is a prayer to Balli Penyalong for guidance and knowledge as to the future course of the business in hand and an injunction to the soul of the pig to carry the praver to Balli Penyalong. Sometimes more than one chief will address one pig in this way, and then, as sooni as these prayers are concluded, some follower plunges a spear into the heart or throat of the pig, and then rapidly opens its belly in the middle line, drags out the liver and lays it on a leaf or platter with the underside uppermost, and so carries it to the chief or chiefs. Then all the elderly men crowd round and consult as to the significance of the appearances presented by the underside of the liver. The various lobes and lobules are taken to represent the various districts concerned in the question on which light is desired, and according to the strength and intimacy of the connections between these lobes, the people of the districts represented are held to be bound in more or less lasting friendship; while spots and nodules in any part betoken future evils for the people of that part, a clean healthy liver means good fortune and happiness for all concerned. The omens thus obtained are held to be the answer vouchsafed by Balli Penyalong to the prayers which have been carried to him by the spirit of the pig. If the answer obtained in this way from one pig is unsatisfactory they will often kill a second, and on important occasions even a third or fourth in order "They endeavoured to learn the fuiture, especially in war, by consulting the entrails of victims."</page><page sequence="12">182 CHARLES HOSE AND W. McDOUGALL.-The Relations bettveen to obtaini a favourable answer. Unless they can thus obtain a favourable forecast they will not set out upon any undertaking of importance. After any ceremony of this kind the body'of the pig is usually divided amnong the people, and by them cooked and eaten witlout further ceremony. But we have seen that after the ceremony in preparation for an expedition the bodies of the young pigs, whose blood was scattered on'the altar-post of Balli Penyalong, were fixed upon tall poles beside this altar-post and there left, ancl this seems to be the rule in ceremonies of this sort, though it is not clear whether the careases are left there as offerings to the hawks or to Balli Penyalong, or because they are in some sense too holy to be used as food after being used in such rites. Probably Kenyahs never give to the spirits in this way the whole body of a large pig, but only of quite small pigs, and in this they are probably influenced by economical considerations. It may be said generally that Kenyahs do not kill domestic pigs simply and solely for the sake of food. The killing of a pig is always'the occasion for, or occasioned by, some religious rite. It is true that on the arrival of honoured guests a pig is usually killed and given to them for food, but its spirit is then always charged with some message to Balli Penyalong. It is said that, when th6 pig's spirit comes to Balli Penyalong, he is offended if it brings no message from those who killed the pig, and he sends it back to carry off their souls. On malny other occasions also pigs are killed; thus, on returning from a successful attack on enemies a pig is usually killed for each family of the household, and a piece of its flesh is put up on a pole before the house; and during the severe illness of any person of high social standing, pigs are usually killed, and friendly chiefs may come from distant 'parts bringing with* them pigs and fowls that they may sacrifice them, and so aid in restoring the sick man to health. On the death 'of a chief too a great feast is made, and many pigs are slaughtered, and their jaw bones are hung up on the tomb. A pig is sometimes used in the ceremony by which a newly-made peace is sealed between tribes hitherto at blood-feud, but a fowl is more commonly used. The wild pig which abounds in the forest is hunted by the Kenyahs, and killed with spears when brought to bay by the dogs, and he is killed and eaten without ceremony or compunction by all classes. The lower jaws of all wild pigs that are killed are cleaned and hung up together in the house, and it is believed that if these should be lost or in any way destroyed the dogs would cease to hunt. The Domestic Fotvl. Every, Keniyah household has a large number of fowls which compete eagerly with the pigs for the scraps of grain and garbage that fall from the house or paddy-stores. The sitting hen and the young chickens are always kept in a basket in the house to preveent the chicks or eggs being eaten by pigs or dogs. But</page><page sequence="13">Men and Anivmals in Scraiwak. 183 beyond this very little attention is given to them. They are seldom killed for food, and their eggs too can hardly be reckoned as a regular article of food, though the people have no prejudice against eating them. Fowls are killed on many of the occasions on which pigs are sacrificed, anid as we have seen in tlhe description of the ceremony at Tama Bulan's house their blood may be poured upon thbe altar-posts of Balli Penyalong, and it would seem that fowls and pigs are to some extent interchangeable equivalents for sacrificial purposes. Perhaps the most important occasion on which the fowl plays a part is the performance of the rite by which a blood-feud is finally wiped away. The following extract from the journal previously quoted describes an incident of this kind: I "In the evening there was serious business on hand. Two chiefs, who some years ago were burned out of their homeg in the Rejang district by the government, have settled themnselves with their people in the Baram district. They had made a provisional peace with the Kayans some years ago, btut the final ceremony was to be performed this evening. The two chiefs of the immigrants, who had remained hitherto in a remote part of the houise, seated themselves at one side, and the Kayan chiefs at the other, and Tama Bulan and ourselves between the two parties. First, presents of iron were exchanged. In the old days costly presents of metal-work used to be given, but as this led sometimes to renewed disputes, the government has forbidden the giving of presents of a greater value than two dollars. So now old parang (sword) blades are given, and the other essential part of the present has been proportionately reduced from a full-grown fowl to a tiny chick. After much preliminary talking, two chicks were brought, and a bundle of old parang- bladbs which Tama Bulan, in his character of peace-maker, carries with hinm whenever he travels abroad. A chief of either party took a chick and a parang and presented them to the other. Then one led his men a little apart and began to rattle off an invocation beginning '0 sacred (Balli) chick,' and theii snipped off its head with the parang, and with the bloody blade smeared the right arms of his followers as they crowded round himz. The old fellow kept up the stream of words until every man was smeared, anid then all stamped together on the floor and raised a great shout. Then the other party repeated the performaince, and the peace being thus formally ratified we sat down to cement it still further by a friendly drinking bout." Another ceremony in which the fowl plays a prominent part is that by which the wandering soul of a sick person is found and led back to his body by the medicine-man. Such a performance is described in the following extract from the sanme journal:- "In the evening we strolled along the great verandah and came upon a soul- catching performance in full swing. In the midst of a crowd of young meni sitting in a semi-circle about a small lamp, stood Oyong Ian (a slave whose</page><page sequence="14">184 CHARLES HOSE ANID W. MCDOUGALL-Thbe relations between merits have raised him to a very good positioln, but who is not by any means a professional medicine-man). He was chanting loudly with closed eyes, and he was supposed to be unconscious of all that was going on about him. The people talked and came and went, but he took no notice and went on with his chant, the men joining in with a deep-voiced chorus at the end of eaclh phrase. An assistant physician handed to him a war-coat, shield, ancd parang, which he took with a distant air as of one in a half-dream. Then the patients were brought and set in a row on a mat, five children, the eldest a girl of about fourteen years, the youngest a baby in the arms of the anxious mother. One of the children was sick, that is to say, his soul had wandered away towards that other land whither it is destined to travel on the death of the body, and it was Oyong Ian's task to go forth in spirit, to find the wandering soul and to lead it back to the body of the sick child. The other children were not sick, and it seemed a little illogical to have their souls caught when there was no reasorn to suppose that they were straying, but then, if one must have the doctor to one child, to let him see the other children hardly increases the expense, and they may get some good from the treatment. Oyong took a short wand, and with it sprinkled sugared water on his parang, addressing his chant to the weapon and then he sprinikled each child. A young fowl was handed to hiin ancl he took it in his riglht hand anid salng, 'O spirit (Balli) of this bird, ask Balli Penyalong, to take away all sickness from us and to keep us from all harm.' Then, after waving the feebly protestinlg bird over the head of each child, chanting the while a formula in antique words whose meaning was unknown to the young man beside me, he snipped off its head and sprinkled its blood on the children. Then he took a second fowl and charged its spirit with prayers to both Penyalong and his wife for the boys and girls respectively, and his song described how his spirit had crossed a great river alnd had found the wandering souls and was leading them back. Six pieces of specially prepared string were produced by the assistant, and taking one in his right hand he put the finger-tips of that hand on the crowni of the head of one of the children (at that moment the child's soul is supposed to pass back into his body through the spot touched); then, as the little fellow held out his arm very solemnily, he tied one of the strings round hlis right wrist. This process he repeated with each child, the baby resisting violently, but the others all very serious and deeply impressed. The assistant now snipped off the head of the second fowl and with the bloody parang Oyong Ian cut short the ends of the strings and smeared a little blood on the arm of each child. Thus the children's souls are tied into their bodies and are not likely to escape again for a long time to come. Lastly, a string was tied round Oyong's wrist by the assistant, a third fowl was killed, and its blood smeared on his arni, and the soul-catching was over. The children were led away and Oyong, still in his trance or dream state, strutted to and fro still chanting, until suddenly he staggered, opened his eyes widely, and then sat down beside me and lit a cigarette in the most every-day sort of way, saying, 'White man's medicine is good, but</page><page sequence="15">Men antd Animals in Sarawak. 185 Kenyahl medicine is good too'; and there was no trace of anything but the most transparent franklness on his honest face." It will be seen fromn this account that the fowl, like the pig, is used in many cases as a messelnger sent by man to the Supreme Spirit. In most cases when a fowl is slaughtered in the course of a ceremony it is first waved over the heads of the people taking part in it, and its blood is afterwards sprinkled upon them. In the blood-brotherhood ceremony, when each of the two men driniks or smokes in a cigarette a little of the other's blood drawn with a bamboo-kniife, a fowl is in many cases waved over them and then killed, and occasionally a pig also is killed. In such a case the man who has killed the fowl will carry its carcase to the door of the house and there will wave towards the heavens a frayed stick moistened with its blood and announce the facts of the cerenmony to Balli Penyalong. So that here again the fowl seems to play, the part of a messenger. The carcase and the bloody stick are afterwards put up together on a tall pole before the house. After going through this ceremony a man is safe fromr all the members of the household to which his blood-brother belongs, and in the case of two chiefs all the members of either household are bound to those of the other by a sacred tie. Fowls' eggs are sometimes put up oin cleft poles as sacrifices. In onie instance when we were engaged in fishing a lake with a large party in boats we came upon a row of eight poles stuck upright at the edge of the lake, each cleft at its upper end and holding a fowl's egg. These had just been put there by the crew of one of the canoes as an offering to the crocodiles, which were regarded as the most influential of the powers of the lake an-d able to ensure us good sport. In such cases the eggs are probably economical substitutes for fowls, as seems to be indicated by the following facts:-When Kenyah boys enter a strange branch of the river for the first time, they go, each one taking a fowl's egg in his halnd, into the jungle with some old manl, who takes the eggs, puits -them into the cleft ends of poles fixed upright in the earth, alnd thus addresses all the omen-birds collectively, " Don't let any harm happen to these children who are coming for the first time to this river; they give you these eggs." And sometimes instead of eggs the feathers of a fowl are used, and both the eggs and feathprs would seenm to be substituted for fowls as being good enough in the case of mere children perforiming a minor rite. When the belly of a fowl is opened there are promilnent two curved portions of the gut. The state of these is examined in somle cases before the planting of paddy, and sometimes before attempting to catch the soul of a sick man. If the parts are much curved it is a good omen; if straight or but slightly curved it is a bad omeii.</page><page sequence="16">186 CHARLES HOSE AND W. AMCDOUGALL.-The Relations between The crocodile. Like all other races of Sarawak, the Kenyahs regard the crocodiles that inlfest their rivers as more or less friendly creatures. They fear the crocodile and do not like to mention it by name, especially if one be in sight, and refer to it as " the old grandfather." But the fear is rather a superstitious fear than the fear of being seized by the beast. They regard those of their own neighbourhood as more especially friendly, in spite of the fact that members of their households are occasionally taken by crocodiles, either while standing incautiously on the Dank of the river or while floating quietly at evening time in a small canoe. When this happens -it is believed either that the person taken has in some way offended or injured one or all of the crocodiles, or that he has been taken by a stranger crocodile that has comie from a distant part of the river and therefore did not share in the friendly understanding usually subsisting between the people and the local crocodiles. But in any -case it is considered that the crocodiles have committed an unjustifiable aggression and set up a blood-feud which can only be abolished by the slaying of one or more of the aggressors. Now it is the habit of the crocodile to hold the body of his victim for several days before devouring it, and to drag it for this purpose into some muddy creek openiing into the main river. A party is therefore organized to search all the neighbouring creeks, and the first measure takeln is to prevent the guilty crocodile escaping to some other part of the river. To achieve this they take long poles, frayed with many cuts, and set them up on the river bank at some distance above and below the scene of the crime and at the mouths of all the neighbouring creeks and streamlets; and they kill fowls and pray that the guilty crocodile may be prevented from passing the spots thus marked. They then search the creeks, and if they find the criminal with the body of his victim they kill him, and the feud is at an end. But, if they fail to find him thus, they go out on the part of the river included between their charmed poles, and, with their spears tied to long poles, prod 611 the bed of this part of the river, and thus generally succeed in killing one or more crocodiles. TIhey then usually search its entrails for the bones and hair of the victim so as to make sure that they have caught the offending beast. But even if they do not obtain conclusive evidence of this kind they seem to feel that justice is satisfied and that the beast killed is probably the guilty one. Except in the meting out oL a just vengeance in this way, no Kenyah will kill a crocodile, and they will not eat its flesh under any circumstances. But there is no evidence to show that thev regard themselves as related by blood or descent to the crocodiles or that their ancestors ever did so. When Kenyahs go on a journey intO strange rivers or to the lower part of the main river they fear the crocodiles of these strange waters, because they are unknown to them, and any one of them might easily be mistaken by the crocodiles for someone who has done thein an injury. Some Kenyahs tie the red leaves of the Droecina below the prow of their boat whenever they go far from home, believing that this protects themn from all danger of attack by crocodiles.</page><page sequence="17">Men and Animnals in Sarawak. 187 The Dog. In all Kenyah houses ar'e large nunmbers of dog,s, which vary a good deal in size and colour, but roughly resemnble large, molngrel-bred, smooth-haired terriers. Each family owns several, and they are fed with rice usually in the evening, but seem to be always hungry. The best of them are used for hunting, but besides these there is always a number of quite useless, ill-fed, ill-tempered curs, for no Kenyah dare kill a dog, however much he may wvish to be rid of it. Still less, of course, will he eat the flesh of a dog. The dogs prowl about, in and around the house, niuch as they please, and are not treated with any particuiar respect, but are rarely kicked or struck. When a dog inltrudes where he is not wanted it is usual to click with the tongue at him, and this is usually enough to mnake him pass on. One young Kenyah chief, on being questioned, said that the reason they will not kill dogs is that they are like children and eat and sleep together with meni in the same house, and he added that if a mlan should kill a dog he would go mad. If a dog dies in the house the men push the carcase out' of the house anid into the river with long poles and will onl no account touch it with their hands. The spot on the floor on which the dog died is fenced round with mats for some few days in order to prevent the children walking over it. It is usual for the Kenyah men to have one or more designls tattooed on their forearms and shoulders. Among the commonest of these designs are those knowni as the scorpion, the prawn, and the dog. They seem to be conventionalised derivatives from these animal fornis. It is said that the dog's head design was formerly much more in fashion than it is at the present time. Deer and Cattle. Kenyahs of the upper class will not kill or eat deer and wild cattle. They believe that if they should eat their flesh they would vomit violently and spit out blood. They have no domestic cattle, and the buffalo does not occur in their districts. Lower-class Kenyabs and slaves, takeni as war-captives from other tribes, may eat deer and horned cattle, but they must take the flesh some little distance from the house to cook it. A woman who is pregniant, or for any other reason is in the hands of a physician, has to observe the restrictions with regard to deer and cUattle more strictly than other people, and she will not touch or allow to be brought near her any article of leather or horn, The war-coats of the men are often made of goat or deer skin, and any mail may wear such a war-coat. Butt when a man has a young son he is particularly careful to avoid contact with any part of a deer lest through such contact he should transmit to his son in any degree the timidity of the deer. On one occasion when we had killed a deer, a Kenyah chief resolutely refused to allow its skin to be carried in his boat, alleging the above reason. The cry or bark of the deer (Cegrvulus wruntjac) is a warning of danger, aiti the seeinig or heariiig, of the plandol (Tragulas nctpu) has a like significance.</page><page sequence="18">188 CHARLES HOSE AND W. MCDOUGALL.- The Relations between The Tiger-/ Cat. The only large species of the Felidee that occurs in Borlneo is the tiger-cat (Felis nebatlosa). Kenyahs will niot eat it as men of some tribes do, but will kill it, and they fashion its handsome spotted skin into war-coats. Such coats are worn only by men who have been on the warpath. The can-ine-teeth of the tiger-cat are much prized as ornamnents; they are worn thrust through holes in the upper part of the shell of the ear, but only by full-grown men. Kuleh, the name of this beast, is sometimes giveln to a boy. The true tiger does not now occur in Borneo, and it is doubtful whether it ever was a native of the island. Nevertheless the Kenyahs knlow it by name (Linjan) alnd by reputation, aiid a few skins are in the possession of chiefs. No ordinary man but only a distinguished and elderly chief will venture to touch such a skin, much less wear it as a war-coat. These skins have been brought fronii other lands by Malay traders, and it is probable that whatever knlowledge of the tiger the Kenyahs possess has comie from the same source. A chief will sometimes name his son Linjan, that is, the Tiger. A carnivore (Aretoyale leucotis) allied to the civet cat warns of danger when seen or heard. Other, A nirmals. There is a certain large lizard (varavus) that is eaten freely by other tribes, but Kenyahs mllay not eat it, though they will kill it. They regard the seeing of any snake as aln unfavourable omen and will not kill any snake gratuitously. Kenyahs, like all, or allmost all, the other natives of Borneo, are more or less afraid of the Maias (the oranig-utan) and of the long-nosed i-onkey, and will not look one in the face or laugh at one. In one Kenyah house a fantastic figure of the gibbon is carved on the ends of all the main cross-beams of the house, and the chief says that this has been their custom for many generations. He tells us that when these beams are being put up it is the custom to kill a pig and divide its flesh among the men who are working, and no woman is allowed to come into the house until this lhas been done. None of his people will kill a gibbon, though other Kenyahs will kill alnd probably eat it. They claim that he helps them as a friend, anld the carvinigs on the beams seem to synmbolize his supportinig of the house. In other parts of the same house are carvings of Senmnopithecus Hosei, but the old chief regards these as much less important and as recent innovatiolns. We do not know of any other aniimals to which especial respect or attention is paid by the Kenyahs, and we will now describe the corresponding customs of the Kayans. THE KAYANS. Like the Kenyahs, the Kayans seem to have come from the east about 150 years ago, probably a little later than the Kenyahs, and are now settled in</page><page sequence="19">Men and Animcals in kScarawvak-. 189 largre villages, consisting usually of three or four long houses, on the banks of the Baram about the middle of its course. In the state of their culture and the character of their customs the Kayans closely resemble the Kenyahs. Individually they are less attractive than the Kenyahs and the difference may be described in one word,-there is in the Kenyah character something Hellenic that is wanting in the Kayans. Since the customs of the Kayanis in regard to animals are so similar to those of the Kenyahs it will only be necessary to mention those points in which they differ and to bring out some differences in the mental attitude of the Kayans. Kayans like Kenyahs worship the Supreme Being under the name Laki Tenangan, i.e., Grandfather Tenangan, aind the women pray to his wife Do Tenangan. They also reverence a number of departmental deities. Thus there are four gods of life, Buring Katingai, Laki Ju Urip, Laki Makatan Urip, Laki Kalisai Urip, a harvest god Anyi Lawang and Abong Do his wife, a fire-god Laki Pesong, a spirit of madness Balanan, a spirit who causes fear Toh Kiho, the creator of the world Laki Kalira Murei, a god of the waters Orai Uka, and lastly, Laki Jup Urip the deity or spirit who ferries souls across the river of death to Apo Lagan, the Kayan Hades. The white-headed hawk (Balli Flaki) of the Keniyahs has its equivalent among the Kayans in the large dark-brown hawk, which they call Laki Neho. But as it is not possible to distinguish these two kinds of hawks when seen flying at some distance, thev address and accept all large hawks seen in the distance as Laki Neho. The functions and powers of Laki Neho seem to be almost identical with those of Balli Flaki. He is a giver of omens and a bringer of messages from Laki Tenangan. The following notes of a conversation with an intelligent Kayan chief will give some idea of his attitude towards Laki Neho. It must be remembered that these people have no priesthood and no dogmatic theologians to define and formulate beliefs, so that their ideas as to the nature of their gods and their abodes and powers are, though perhaps more concrete, at least as various in the minds of different individuals as are the corresponding ideas among the average adherents of more highly developed forms of religion; and perhaps no two men will agree exactly on these matters, and any one man will freely contradict his own statements. Laki Tenangan is an old nman with long white hair who speaks Kayan and has a wife, Do Tenangan. They sometimes see him in dreams, and if fortunate they then see his face, but if unlucky they see his back only. In olden times powerful men sometimes spoke with him, but now this never occurs. He dwells in a house far away. Laki Neho also has a house that is covered with palm leaves and frayed sticks. It is in a tree top, yet it is beside a river, and has a landing place before it like every Kayan house. This house is sometimes seen in dreams. It is not so far away as the house of Laki Tenangan. At first our informant said that lhelp is asked directly of Lki Neho, but when pressed he said that Laki Neho</page><page sequence="20">190 CHARLEs HosE AND W. MCDOUGALL.-T/ie Relations betwJCeen may carry the message to Laki Tenangan. Some things Laki Neho does of his own will and power; for example, if a branch were likely-to fall on a Kayah boat he would prevent it; for Laki Tenangan long ago taught him how to do such 'things. When a mana is sick Kayans appeal to Laki Neho, but if he does nlot make the patient well, they then appeal to Laki Tenalngan directly, killinig a pig whose spirit goes first to the house of Laki Neho, and then on to the more distant house of Lalsi Tenangan. For they believe that in such a case the patient has somehow offended Laki Neho by disregarding or misreading his omens. A man suffering' from chronic disease may himself pray to Laki Teniangan. He lights a fire and kills a fowl and perhaps a pig also, and calls upon Laki Neho to. be his witness anld messenger. He holds an egg, in one hand and says, "This is for you to eat, carry my message direct to Laki Tenangan that I may get well and live and bring up my children, who shall be taught my occupations and the true customs"; and he will say to Laki Neho, " You I put on the top of my head, when you are with me men look up to me as to a high cliff." The fire is lighted to make Laki Neho warm and energetic. It will be seen from the above account that the Kayans have formed a concept of the power of the hawks in general, and have given it a semi-anthropomorphic character, and we shall see below that the Sea-Dayaks have carried this process still further. Crocodiles. The Kayan's attitude towards the crocodile is practically the same as the Kenyah's. We append the following notes of a conversation with a young Kayan chief, Usong, and his cousin Wan :-There are but very few Kayans who will kill a crocodile except in revenge. But if one of their people has been takenl by a crocodile, they go out together to kill the criminal, and they begin by saying, "Don't run away, you've got to be killed, why don't you come to the surface? You won't come out on the land because you have done wrong and are afraid." After this he will perhaps come on to the land, and if he does not he will at least float to the surface of the water and is then killed with spears. In olden days KIayans used to make a crocodile of clay and ask it to drive away evil spirits, but now this is not done. A crocodile may become a man just like themselves. Sometimes a man dreams that a crocodile calls him to become his blood-brother and after they have gone through the regular ceremony and exchanged names (in the dream) the man is quite safe from crocodiles. Usong's uncle has in this way become blood-brother to a crocodile and is now ca-lled " Baiya " (the generic namne for the crocodile) while some crocodile unknown is called Jok, and Usong considers himself the nephew of the crocodile Jok. ITsong's father has also become blood-brother to a crocodile, and Usong calls himself a soln of this particular unknown crocodile. Sometimes he asks these two, his uncle- and his father- crocodiles, to give him a pig when he is out hunting, and once they did give him one. After relating this Usong addedl, " But who knows if this be true ? " Wan's great-great-grandfather becamie blood-brother to a crocodile, ancd was</page><page sequence="21">Men and Animals in Sarawakv. 191 called " Klieng Baiya." Wan has several times met this crocodile in dreams. Thus in one dream he fell into the river when there were many crocodiles about. He climbed on to the head of one which said to him, "Don't be afraid," and carried him to the bank. Wan's father had charms given him by a crocodile and would not on any account kill one, and Wan clearly regards himself as being intimately related to crocodiles in general. The Kayans regard the pig and the fowl in much the same way as the Kenyahs do, and put them to jtist the same uses. Their beliefs and customs with regard to deer, horned cattle, dogs alid the tiger-cat, are similar to those of the Kenyahs save that they will not kill the last of these. They are perhaps more strict in the avoidance of deer and- cattle. One old chief who had been ailing for a long time hesitated to eftter- the Resident's house because he saw a pair of horns hanging up there. When he entered he asked for a piece of iron and on returning home he killed a fowl and a pig, and submitted to the process of having his soul caught by. a medicine-man lest it should have reinaiined in the dangerous neighbourhood of the horns. Like the Kenyahs the Kayans entertain a superstitious dread of the Maias and the long-nosed monkey, but the J)ok (Iacacus nemestrinus) -the coco-nut monkey of the Malay States, has special relations to theimi. It is very commlon in their district and they will kill it only when it is stealing their rice-crop, and they will never eat it as other peoples do. There is a somewhat unicertain belief that it is a blood-relative, and the following mytll is told to account for this:-A Kayan woman of high class was reaping paddy with her daughter. Now it is against custom to eat any of the rice during reaping, and when the mother went away for a short time leaving the girl at work she told her oit no account to eat any of the rice. But no sooner was the mother gone than the girl began to husk some paddy and nibble at it. Then at once her body began to itch and hair began to grow on her arms like the hair of a Dok. Soon the mother returned and the girl said, " Why am I itching so ? " and the mother ,answered, "YouL have done some wicked thing, you have eaten somile rice." Then hair grew all over her body except her head and face, and the mother said, " Ah, this is what I feared, now you must go iiito the jungle and eat only what has been plalnted by human hands." So the girl went- into the jungle and her head became like a Dok's and she ceased to be able to speak. The Dok does not help them in any way but only spoils their crops. A very popular dance is the Dok dance, in which a man imitates very cleverly the behaviour -of the J)ok. It is a very ludicrous performance, and excites boisterous mirth. They say it is done merely in fun. In one Kayan house the ends of all the main cross-beams that support the roof are ornamented with fretwork designs which are clearly animal derivatives and apparently all of the same animal. Its form suggests a crocodile, and some of the men agreed that that was its meaniing, while others asserted that it was a dog. It was doubtless originally oe -or other of these, biut.</page><page sequence="22">192 CHARLES HoSE AND W. MCDOUGALL.-ThC Relations between has now become a conventional design inerely, and its true origin has been forgotten (cf. Plate XV, 1). Neither Kayans inor Kenyahs make much use of snakes of any kind, but there is one snlake with red head and tail which, when they see it in the course of a journey, they must kill, else harm will befall them. And again if they see a certain snake just as they are about to enter a strange river or a strange village they will stop and light a fire on the bank in order to communicate with Laki Neho. Kayans will not eat any species of turtle or tortoise. KALAMANTANS. The Kalamantans is the name by which we propose to denote the people of the scattered conimunities that seem to be descendants of the tribe that inhabited the interior of the Baram district- at the time when the Kenyahs anid Kayans first invaded it from the eastward. Their general modes of Lfe and thought are very sinmilar to those of the Kayans and Keilyahs, especially those of the latter, but they present a greater variety of customs than either of those tribes, owing no doubt to their widely scattered distribution. We will describe the main points of interest in which their relations to the aniimals differ from those of the Kenyahs and Kayans. The following notes of a conversation with the Orang Kaya Tummonggong, the distinguished chief of the Long Pata people (one of the many groups of Kalamantans), show that these people regard the hawk in much the same way as the Kenyahs do:-The hawk, " Balli Flaki," is the messenger of "Balli Utong " the Supreme Being. When a party is about to set out on any expedition, they explain their intentions to Balli Flaki and then observe the movements of the hawks. If a hawk circles round over their heads some of the party will fall sick on the journey and probably die. If the hawk flies to the right when near at hand it is a good omen, but if it flies to the right when at a distance or to the left, whether near or, far, that is a bad omen. The people then light a fire and entreat the hawk to give a more favourable sign, and if it persists in goina to the left they give up the expedition. If while the omens are being read the hawk flaps his wings, or screams, or swoops 4own and settles on a tree the omens are bad. But if it swoops down and up again that is good. If two or three hawks are visible at the same time, and especially if they all fly to the right that is very good, but if many are visible and especially if they fly off in different directions that is very bad, for it means that the enemy will scatter the attackinlg force. If the hawk should capture a small bird while they are watching it, that mneans that they will be made captives if they persist in their undertaking. The hawk is not claimed as a relative by Kalamantaiis. They take omens from various other birds in matters of miinor importance. Kalanmantans use the domestic pig and fowl as saQrificial animals just as the Kenyahs and Kayans do, and they have the same superstitious dread of</page><page sequence="23">Men and Animals in Sarawak. 193 killing a dog. One group of them, the Malanaus, use a dog in taking a very solemn oath, and sometimes the dog is killed in the course of this ceremony. Or instead of the dog being killed, its tail may be cut off, and the man taking the oath licks the blood from the stump, and this is considered a most binding and solemn form of oath. The ceremony is spoken of as "makau asu," i.e., "the eating of the dog." Most Kalamantans will kill and eat deer and cattle freely. But there are exceptions to this rule. Thus Damong, the chief of a Malaniau household, together with all his people, will not kill or eat the deer Cervulus muntjac, alleging that an ancestor had become a deer of this kind, and that, since they cannot distinguish this incarnation of his ancestor from other deer, they must abstain from killing all deer of this species. We know of one instance in which one of these people refused to use again his cooking-pot which a Malay had borrowed and used for cooking the liesh of this deer. This superstition is still rigidly adhered to, although these people have been converted to Islam of recent years. On one occasion another chief resoluitely refused to proceed oln a journey through the jungle when a mouse deer (Plando7k) crossed his path, and he will not eat this deer at any time.' The people of Miri, who also are Mohammedan Malanaus, claim to be related to the large deer (Cervus equinus) and some of them to the muntjac deer also. Now these people live in a country in which deer of all kinds abound, and they always make a clearing in the jungle around a tomb. On such a clearing grass grows up rapidly, and so the spot becomes attractive to deer as a grazing ground; ancd it seems not imnprobable that it is through frequenitly seeing deer about the tolmbs that the people have come to enltertain the belief that their dead relatives become deer or that they are in some other way closely related to the deer. The Bakongs, another group of Malanaus, hold a similar belief with regard to the bear-cat (A}rtictis) and the various species of Paradoxut'ruts, and in this case the origin of the belief is admitted by them to be the fact that on goinig to their grave- yards they often see one of these beasts colmilig out of a tomb. These tombs are roughly constructed wooden coffins raised a few feet only from the ground, and it is probable that these carnivores make their way into them in the first place to devour the corpse, and that they then nmake use of them as lairs. The relations of the Kalamnantans to the crocodiles seem to be nmore intimuate than those of other tribes. One group, the Long Patas, claim the crocodile as a relative. The story goes that a certain man named Silau became a crocodilk. First he became covered with itch, and he scratched himself till he bled and became rough all over. Then his feet began to look like a crocodile's tail, and as the change crept up fronm his feet to his body he called out to his relatives that he was I Of the Romans it is said: "When a fox, a wolf, a serpent, a horse, a dog, or any other kind of quadruped ran across a person's path or appeared in an unusual place, it formed an augury." VOL. XXXI. 0</page><page sequence="24">194 CHIARLES HOSE AND W. McDOUGALL.-The Relations between becoming a crocodile, and miade them swear that they would never kill any crocodile. Many of the people in olden days knew that Silau became a crocodile because they saw him at times and spoke to him, and his teeth and tongue were always like those of a man. Many stories are told of his meeting with people by the river-side. On one occasion a man was roasting a pig on the river-bank, and when he left it for a moment Silau took it and divided it among the other crocodiles, who greatly enjoyed it. Silau then arranged with them that he would give a sign to his human relatives by which the crocodiles might always be able to recognize them when travelling on the rivers. He told his human friends that they must tie leaves of the Draccena below the bows of their boats, and this they always do when they go far from home, so that the crocodiles may recognise them and so abstain from attacking them. If a man of the Long Patas is taken by a crocodile they attribute this to the fact that they have intermarried to some extent with Kayans. When they come upon a crocodile lying on the river-bank they say, "Be easy, granldfather, don't mind us, you are one of us." Some of the Kalamantans will not even eat anything that has been cooked in a vessel previously used for cooking crocodile's flesh, and it is said that if a man should do so unwittingly his body would become covered with sores. If a crocodile is seen on their left hand by Long Patas on a war expedition that is a bad omen, but if on their right hand that is the best possible omen. The Orang Kaya Tumrnonggong tells us that in the olden timres the crocodiles used to speak to his people, warning them of danger, but that now they never speak, and lie supposes that their sileince is due to the fact that his people have intermarried with other tribes. The Long Patas frequently carve a crocodile's head as the figure-head for a war canoe. The Batu Blah people (Kalamantans) on returning from the war-path make a huge effigy of a crocodile with cooked rice, and put fowl's eggs in its head for eyes and bananas for teeth, and cover it with scales made from the stem of the banana plant. When all is ready it is transfixed with a wooden spear and the chief cuts off its head with a wooden sword. Then pigs and fowls are slaughtered and cooked and eaten with the rice from the rice-crocodile, the chiefs eating the head and the common people the body. The chief of these people could give us no explanation of the meaning of this ceremony; he merely says they do it because it is 1' adat " (custom). One community of Kalamantans, the Lelak people, lived recently on the banks of a lake much infested with crocodiles. Their chief had the reputation of being able to induce them to leave the lake. To achieve this he would stanld in his boat waving a bundle of charms, which included among other things teeth of the real tiger and boars' tusks, and then address the crocodiles politely in their own language. He would then allow his boat to float out of the lake into the river, and the crocodiles would follow him and pass oil down the river. Many, probably all, Kalaimiantans put up wooden images of the crocodile</page><page sequence="25">Men and Anignals in Sarawa7c. 195 before their houses, and many of them carve the prow of their war-canoes into the form of a crocodile's head with gaping jaws. THE PUNANS. We regard the Punans as being in all probability closely allied on the one hanid to the group of tribes which we have called the Kalamantans and to the Kenyahs on the other, but their nmode of life and genleral customs are so different from those of the other peoples that we describe them separately here. They are a nomadic people who build no permanent houses of any kind and do not cultivate rice, and they live by hunting and gathering of wild fruits and jungle produce such as camphor, which they exchange for rice, salt, and iron with the people of other tribes. Since their inode of life is so very much more primitive than that of the other tribes, we hoped that their relations to the animals might throw light upon the significance of many custonis that we have described above. In this respect what we have been able to learn of the Punan beliefs and customs is disappointing, but it must be confessed that our failure to discover any particular belief or custom is, in their case, of far less value as negative evideluce than in the case of any of the other tribes, because the Punans are very timid and reserved people; and we have little doubt that much remains to be learnt of their customs and beliefs. We hope to be able to complete our account of them at some future date. Punans reverence the Supreme Being as the Kenyahs do, and they address him as Balli Lutong. They have similar ideas with regard to the soul of man alnd its behaviour and destination after the death of the body, anld like all the other peoples they believe themselves to be surrounded by spirits which may be hurtful to them. Their medicinie nien are sometimes called in by people of otlher tribes, and enjoy a high reputation. The Punans make use, of all the omen-birds that are used by the Kenyahs, anld they regard them as in some degree sacred, and not to be killed and eaten. They seem to read the omens in much the same way as the Kenyahs do, but they are not so constant in their cult of the omen-birds, and Punanis of different districts differ a good deal from one another in this respect. In fact, it is doubtful whether those that have mixed least with the other peoples pay any attention to the omen-birds, and it seems not unlikely that the cult of the omen-birds is in process of being adopted by them. With the exception of these birds there is probably no wild animal of the jungle that the Punans do not kill and eat. They refuse to eat the domestic pig, but this, they say, is because they know nothing of it, it is strange to them. Having no domestic pigs anid fowls, they of course do not sacrifice them to their gods, nor do they seem to practise the rite of sacrifice in any form. They give the names of various animals to their ehildren, and use these names in the ordiniary way. o 2</page><page sequence="26">196 CHARLEs HOSE AND W. MCDOUGALL.-The Relations between The crocodile seems to be regarded as a god by the Punans-they spealc of it as Balli Penyalong. (This, as we have already said, is the lname of the Supreme Spirit of the Kenyahs.) They sometimes make a wvooden inmage of it, and hang it before the leaf shelter or hut in which they may be living at any time, and if one of their party should fall ill they hang the blossom of the betel- nut tree on the figure, and the miedicine man addresses it wlhen he seeks to call back the wandering soul of his patielnt. Punans certainly ascribe significance to the behaviour of a few animals other than those observed by the other peo)les. Thuis if they see a lizard of any kind upon a branch before the shelter in which they are encamnped, and especially if it utters its note, they regard this as a sign that enemies are near. THE SEA DAYAKS OR IBANS. These people, who have been a good deal confused witlh the Lanid Dalyaks (whom we regard as belongTing to the group of scattered commuinities that we have classed together as Kalamantails), we propose to call Ibans in order to avoid this confusion. This liame, which means the immigrants, has been given them by the Kayanis because they have migrated from the Saribas and Lenianak rivers in the Rejang, and they have adopted it for themselves.' They inhabited a small district only at the timiie of the advenit of Sir James Brooke, but since that time t'.ey have spread, under the protection of the Sarawak government, over a much wider area, and have made settlements in most of the main rivers of Sarawak. We regard tbem, for reasons which it would take too long to give here, as people of Malay stock who, like the Malays, have come to Borneo from the west. They have had much more intercourse witli Malays, Chinanien, and all the other peoples of the couiitry than have the tribes with which we have hitherto dealt, and they are a very iimitative people, readily adopting the fashions, customs, anld beliefs of those with whom their roving natures bring therlm into relations of any kind. The result is that tlieir beliefs and customs are much mixed, and present unusually great inconsistelncies and extravagances. Since, then, we regard the customs of the Ibans as of less anthropological value than those of the tribes with which we have dealt above, and since various writers have already described many of them at length, we shall describe in this paper only some features of their animal superstitions that seem to us especially inlterestilng. The Ibans do not seem to have any conception that corresponds closely to the Supreme Spirit of the races with which we have already dealt. Archdeacon Perham2 has given an account of the Petara of these people, showing, lhow it is a conception of one god having very many manifestations and functions, each special functioni being conceived vaguely as an anthropomorphic deity. He has described I We believe that Dr. A. C. Haddon also proposes to use the name Iban for these people. 2 Jourrn. of S-traits Asiatic Society, Nos. 8, 10, and 14.</page><page sequence="27">MIen acnd Aninmals in Scarawak. 197 also the mythical warrior-hero and den-i-god Klieng, and the god of war, Singalanag Burong. As Archdeacon Perhan- has said, this last deity has a material animal form, ilamely, the white-headed lhawk, which is the Balli Flaki of the Kenyahs, anid plays a somewhat similar part in their lives. But Singalang Burong is decidedly more anthropomorphic than Balli Flaki and is probably generally conceived as a single being of lhuman formi living in a house such as the Ibans thenmselves inihabit; whereas Balli Flaki, even if sometimes conceived in the singular as the great Balli Flaki, is very bird-like. We have seen that the Kayans describe their hawk-god, Laki Neho, as dwellinlg in a hiouse, which, though in the top of a tree, has a landing-stage before it on the river-bank. In the case of the Kayans the conception is only half-way on the road to a full anthropomorph, whereas with the Ibans the chalnge has bee-n completed and the hawk-god is completely anthropornorpbic. And corresponding with this increased importance and clefinition of the anthropomorphic hawk-god, we find that for the Ibans the virtue has departed out of the individual hawks and they are no longer conlsulted for onmens, for they say that Singalang oBuroing never leaves his house, and therefore they do not take omens fromi the hawks when going on the warpath. Nevertheless, he is the chief or rtuler over all the other omen-birds, who are merely his messengers. He thus seems to have come to occupy almost the position of Balli Penyalong among the iKenyahs. The following notes are the statements made upon this subject by a very intelligent Iban of the Undup district:-Once a year they make a big feast for Singalang Burong and sing for about twelve hours, calling him and Klieng and all the Petara to the feast. (This is the ceremony known as Gawai Burong. It is a most tedious and monotonous performance after the first few hours.) Singalang Burong in older days used to come to these feasts in person as a man just like an Iban in appearance ancl behaviour. At the end of the feast he would go out, take off his coat, and fly away in the form of the white-headed hawk. Now they are not sure that he comes to their feast, because they never see hilil. Singalang Burong is greater than Klieng, although it is Klieng that gives them heads in war. Singalang Burong married an iban woman, Kachirndai Lanai Pantak Girak, and he gave all his daughters in marriage to the omen-birds. Dara Inchin Tembaga Monghok Chlelabok married Katupong (Sasia abnormis), Dara Selaka Ulih Nujut married Manbuus (Carkurentis), Pingai Tuai Nadai Mertas Indu Moa Puchang Penabas married Bragai (Harpacte8), Indu Langgu KatungsoDg Ngunibai Dayanu Katupang Bungah Nketai married Papan (Harpactes ditrdi), and lastly Indu Bentok Tinchin Mas Ndu Pungai Lelatan Pulas nmarried Kotok (Lepocestes). He had also one son, Agi Melieng, etc., who married the daughter of Pulang Gana, the god of agriculture, her name being Indu Kachanggut Rumput Melieng Capian. It was amusing and instructive to hear this Iban rattle off these enormous names without any hesitatioln, while another Iban sitting beside him guaranteed their accuracy. In the olden days, it is said, there were only thirty-three individuals of each</page><page sequence="28">1981 CHARLES HoSE AND W MCDOUGALL.-The Relations between kind of omeni-bird (including, Sirngalang Burong). But although these thirty-three of each kind still exist, there are mnany others which cannot be certainly distinguished fromii them, and these do not give true omens. It would be quite impossible to kill any one of these thirty-three true representatives of each kind, however mluch a man might try. Nevertheless, if an Iban kills an omen-bird by mistake, he wraps it in a piece of cloth and buries it carefully in the earth, anid with it he buries rice and flesh and money, entreating it not to be vexed and to forgive him because it was all an accidenit. He then goes home and will speak to no one on the way, and stays in the house for the rest of that day at least. The Ibanis read omens not only from the birds mentioned above as the sons-in-law of Singalang Burong, but also fromi some other animals. And it is interesting to note that they have made a verb from the substantive "burong," a bird, namely, "beburong," to bird, i.e., to take omens of any kind, whether from bird or beast. An excellent account of the part played by omnens in the life of the Ibans has been given by Archdeacon Perham in the paper referred to above, and we have nothing further to add to that account. The hornbill must be included among the sacred birds of the lban, although it does not give omens. On the occasion of making peace between hostile tribes, the Ibans sometimes make a large wooden image of the hornbill and hang great numbers of cigarettes upon it, and these are takeln fromi it during the ceremony and smoked by all the men taking part in it. On the occasion of the great peace-making at Baram in March, 1899, at which thousands of Kenyahs, Kayans Kalamantans, and Ibans were present, the Ibans made an elaborate image of the hornbill some nine feet in height and hung upon it many thousands of cigarettes, and these were smoked by the men of the different tribes with apparently full understanding of the value of the act. A special deity, Pulang Gana, presides over the rice-culture of the Ibans, but the crocodile also is intimately conicerned with their rice-culture. The following account was given us by an intelligent Iban from the Batang Lupar:- iKlieng first advised the Ibanis to make friends with Pulang Gana., who is a Petara and the grandfather (" aki") of paddy. Pulang Gana first taught them to plant paddy and instructed them in the following rites: On going to a new district Ibans always make a life-size image of a crocodile in clay on the land chosen for the paddy-farm. The image is made chiefly by some elderly man of good repute and noted for skilful farming. Then for seven days the house is " nmali," i.e., under special restrictions-no one may enter the house or do anything in it except eat and sleep. At the end of the seven days they go to see the clay crocodile and give it cloth and food and rice-spirit and kill a fowl and a pig before it. The ground round about the image is kept carefully cleared and is held sacred for the next three years, and if this be not done there will be poor crops on the other farms. When the rites are duly performed this clay crocodile</page><page sequence="29">M1en and Animals in Sarawak. 199 destroys all the pests which eat the rice. If in a district where Ibans have been long settled the farm-pests becomne very noxious, the people pass three days "mali" and then make a tiny boat of bark, which they call " utap " (a shield). They then catch one specimen of each kind of pest-one sparrow, one grasshopper, etc.-and put them inlto the small boat together with all they need for food and set the boat free to float away down the river. If this does not drive away the pests they then resort to the more thorough and certainly effectual process of making the clay crocodile. Many Ibans claim the live crocodile as a relative, and like almost all the other peoples will not eat the flesh of crocodiles nor kill them, save in revenge when a crocodile has taken one of their household. They say that the spirit of the crocodile sometimLes becomes a man just like an Iban, but better and more powerful in every way, and sometinies he is met and spoken with in this form. Another reason given for their fear of killing crocodiles is that Ribai, the river-god, sometimes becomes a crocodile; and he may become also a tiger or a bear. Klieng. too, may become any one of five beasts, namely, the python, the maias, the crocodile, the bear, or the tiger, and it is for this reason that Ibans will not kill these animals. For if a man should kill one which was really either Ribai or Klieng he would go miad. The Ibans are by nature a less serious-minded and less religious people than the Kenyahs and Kayans, and they have a greater variety of myths and extravagant superstitions; nevertheless, they use the fowl and the pig as sacrificial animals in much the same way as the other tribes. They eat the fowl anld both the wild and domestic pig freely, except in so far as they are restrained by somewhat rigid notions of econoiny in such matters. The fowl plays a larger part than the pig in their religious practices, and its heart is sometimes consulted for omens. Ibans will kill and eat all kinds of deer, but there are exceptions to this rule. The deer are of some slight value to them as omen-givers. Horned cattle they will kill and eat, but they are not accustomed to the flesh of them, and most do not relish it. Ibans have numerous animal fables that remind one strongly of LEsop's fables and the Brer Rabbit stories of the Africans. Inr these " Tekora " the land-tortoise and "pelandok," the tiny mouse-deer, figure largely as cunning and unprincipled thieves and vagabonds that turn the laugh always against the bigger animals and man. TLle " Nyarong" or Spirit-helper. An important institution among the Ibans, which occurs but in rare instances among the other peoples, is the "Nyarong," or Spirit-helper. The "Nyarong" is one of the very few topics in regard to wlhich the Ibans display aniy reluctance to speak freely. So great is their reserve in this connection that one of us lived for fourteen years on friendly terms with Ibans of various districts without ascertaining the meaning of the word " Nyarong " or suspectincg the great importance of the part played by it in the lives of many of these people. It</page><page sequence="30">200 CHARLES HOSE AND W. MCDOUGALL.-The Relations between seems to be usually the spirit of some ancestor or dead relative, but not always so, and it is not clear that it is always conceived as the spirit of a deceased human being. This spirit becomes the special protector of some individual Iban, to whom in a dream he mnanifests himself, in the first place in human form, and announces that he will be his "Nyarong," and apparently he may or may not inform the dreamer in what form he will appear in future. On the day after such a dream the Iban wanders through the jungle looking for signs by which he may recognize his "Nyarong," and if an animal behaves in a manner at all unusual, if a startled deer stops a moment to gaze at him before bounding away, if a gibbon gambols about persistently in the trees near him, if he comes upon a bright quartz-crystal or a strangely contorted root or creeper, that animnal or object is for him full of a mysterious significanice and is the abode of his "Nyarong." Somietimes the "Nyarong" then assumes the form of an Iban and speaks with him, promising all kinds of help and good fortune. If this occurs the Iban usually faints away, and when he comes to himnself again the " Nyarong" will have disappeared. Or, again, a man may be told in his dream that if he will go into the jungle he will meet his " NyaronlW' " as a wild 'boar. He will then of course go to seek it, and if by chance other mien of his house should kill a wild boar that day he will go to them and beg for its head or buy it at a great price if need be, carry it home to his bed-place, offer it cooked rice and kill a fowl before it, smearing the blood on the head and on himself and huinbly begging for pardon. Or he may leave the corpse in the jungle and sacrifice a fowl before it there. On the followino night he hopes to dream of the " Nyarong" again, and perhaps he is told to take the tusks from the dead boar and that they will bring himii good luck. Unless he dreams somethinig of this sort he feels that he has been mistaken and that the boar was not really his " Nyarong." Perhaps only one in fifty or a hundred meni is fortuniate enough to have a 'Nyaron,` though all ardently desire it. Mally a younc man goes out to sleep oni the grave of some distinguished person or in some wild and lonely spot and lives for some days on a very restricted diet, hoping that a " Nyarong" will come to him in his dreamns. When, as is miost commonly the case, the "Nyarong" takes on the form of solne animal, all individuals of that species become objects of especial regard to the fortunate Iban, and he of course will not kill or eat ainy such animal, and he will as far as possible restrain others from doing so, A "Nyaronig" may change the form in which it manifests itself, but eveln then the Iban will continue to respect the animal-form in which it first appeared. In some cases the cult of a " yarong" will spread through a whole family or household. The children and grandchildren will usually respect the species of animal to which a man's " Nyarong " belongs and perhaps sacrifice fowls or pigs to it occasionally. But it does not do anything for them; whereas it is asserted that, if the great-grandchildreln of a man behave well to his "N yarong," it will often befriend them just as much as its original protegJ.</page><page sequence="31">Mlen and Animals in Sarawalk. 201 The above general account of the "Nyarong" is founded on the descriptions of many different Ibans, and we will now supplement it by describing several particular instances. Angus (a Batanig Liupar Iban) says that every Iban who has no "Nyarong" hopes to get some bird or beast as his helper at the " begawai," the feast given to the Petara. He hiimself has nione, but he will not kill the gibbon because the "Nyarong " of his grandfather, who died twenty years ago, was a gibbon. Once a maln camie to his grandfatlher in a dream and said to him, "Don't you kill th% gibbon," and then turned into a grey gibbon. This gibbon helped him to become rich and to take heads and in all possible ways. On one occasion when he was about to go on the warpath his " Nyarong" came to him in a dream and said, " Go on, I will help you," and the next day he saw in the jungle a grey gibbon which was undoubtedly his " Nyaronig." AWhen he died he said to his sons, " Don't ycu kill the gibbon," and his sons and grandsons have obeyed hiim in this ever sinlce. Anigus adds thiat when a nmaln dreanms of a " Nyarong " for the first time he does not believe it and will still kill animals of that kind; lnor is a second dream enough, but when he dreams the same dream a third time, then his scepticism is overcome and he can no longer doubt his good fortune. Ang,us himself once shot a gibbon when told to do so by one of us. He first said to it, "I don't want to kill you, but the Tuan who is giving me wages expects mne to, and the blame is his. But if youi are really the 'Nyarong' of ny granidfather, make the shot miss you." He then shot and inissed three times, and on shooting a fourth tinle he killed a gibbon, butl not the onie he had spoken to. Angus does not think the gibbon helps either his father or himself. Payang, an olcl Katibas Ilban, tells us that he has been helped by a python ever since he was a young miall, when a iman caine to him in a dream and said, " Sometimes I become a python and sometimes a cobra, and I will always help you." It llas certairnly helped him very much, but he does not know whlether it has helped his children; nevertheless, he has forbidden them to kill it. He does not like to speak of it, but he does so at our request. Payang concluded by saying that he had nio doubt that we white men have " Nyaroiugs" very much more powerful than the Iban's, and that to them we owe our ability to do so, many wonderful thinigs. Imban, an Iban who had recently movecl to the Baram river from the Rejang, had once when sick seen in. a dreamn the Labi-Labi, the large river-turtle (lirionJyx sntbplanus), and made a promise that if he should recover he would never kill it. So when he settled on the Baram river as head of a household he attempted to impose a fine on his people for killing the Labi-Labi. They appealed to one of us as the resident niagistrate, and it was decided that if Imlban wished to insist on this observance he must remove to a small tributary stream. This he has done, and a few of his people have followed him and on them he enforces a strict observance of his cult of the Labi-Labi.</page><page sequence="32">202 CHARLES HOSE AND W. MCDOUGALL.-The Relations between A still more interesting case is the following one:-A community of Ibans were building a new house on the Dabai river some years ago, and one day, while they were at work, a porcupine ran out of a hole in the ground near by. During the following night one of the party was told by the porcupine in a dream to join their new house with his (the porcupine's). ,So they completed their house, and ever since have made yearly feasts in honour of the porcupines that live below the house, and no one in the house dare injure one of them, though they will still kill and eat other porcupines in the jungle. They have had no death in the house during the seven years that it has been built, and this they attribute to the protecting power of the porcupines, and when anyone is sick they offer food to them and regard their good offices as far more important than the ininistrations of the " inanang," the medicine man. Last year some relatives of these Ibans moved to this village, and for three months the knowledge of the part played by the porcupines was hid from them as a mnysterious secret. At the end of that time this precious miiystery was disclosed to the new-comers, and the porcupines were feasted with every variety of cooked rice, some of it being made into a rude image of a porcupine, and with rice-spirit and cakes of sugar and rice-flour, salt and dried fish, oil, betel-nut, and tobacco. Several fowls were slain, and their blood was daubed on the chin of each person in the house. The heart of one fowl was carefully taken out and put with the food offered to the porcupines, that they might read the omens from it, and they were then informed of the arrival of the new-comiers. The fowls were waved over the heads of the people by the old men while they prayed the porcupines to give them long life and health and a token of their goodwill in the form of a smooth, rounded peeble. On an occasion of this sort it is highly probable that the required token will be fouind, for the spirit-helper would no doubt be surreptitiously helped by somle member of the household who, being deficient in faith, prefers to make a certainty of so important a. matter rather than leave it entirely to the " Nyarong." CON CLUSION. We have now to discuss some problems suggested by a review of the facts set forth above and to bring forward a few additional facts that seeni to throw light on these questions. The question that we will first discuss in this-Are all or any of the instances of peculiar regard paid to animals, or of anim-als sacrificed to gods or spirits, or of the ceremonial use of their blood, to be regarded as institutions surviving from a fully developed system of totem-worship now fallen into decay? It will have been noticed that a large number of the features of totem-worship, as it occurs in its best developed forms, occur among the people of one or other of the tribes of Sarawak. We have in the first place numerous cases in which a whole community refuses to kill or eat an animal which is believed to protect and aid them by omens and warnings and in other ways, and in which the animal is worshipped</page><page sequence="33">Men and' Animals in Sarawak. 203, with prayer and sacrifice (the hawk among various tribes); we have at least one nstance of a community claiming to be related to a friendly species (Long Patas and the crocodile), and having as usual an extravagant myth to account for the belief; we have the domestic animal that is sacrificially slain, its blood being sprinkled on the worshippers and its flesh eaten by them, and that is never slain without religious rites (pig, of the Kenyahs and Kayans); we have the animal that must not be killed tattooed on the skin of the men (the dog), or its skin worn by fully grown men only (the tiger-cat), or inmages of it made of clay or carved in wood and set up before the house (the hawk and crocodile); we have the animal that is claimed as a relative imitated in popular dances (the Dok-monkey of the Kayans), the belief that the souls of nmen assume the form of soine animal that must not be killed or eaten (deer and the arctogale among Kalamantans), the observance by invalids of a very strict avoidance of contact with any part of an animal that must not be killed or eaten in any case (horned cattle among Kenyahs and Kayans). Not only do we see these various customs, that in other parts of the world have been observed as living elements of totem-worship, and that in other parts have been accepted as evidence of totem-worship in the past, but in the agricultural habits of the people we may see an efficient cause of the decay of totem-worship if at some time in the past it has flourished among them. For it has been pointed out, especially by Mr. Jevons in his Introduction to the Ilistory of Religion, that totemism seems to flourish most naturally among tribes of hunters, and that the introduction of agriculture must tend towards its decay. Now there is some reason to suppose that the introduction to Borneo of rice and of, the art of cultivating it is of comparatively recent date. Crawford reckoned that the cultivation of paddy was introduced to the southern parts of Borneo from Java some three hundred years ago, and into the northern parts fronm the Philippine Islands about one hundred and fifty years ago. But whatever the date of the occurrence may have been, it seems to be certain that, by the introduction of paddy-cultivation from some other country, most of the tribes of Sarawak were converted, probably very yapidly, from hunting to agriculture. This conversion must have caused great changes in their social conditions and in their customs and superstitions, and if totemism flourished ainong them while they were still simple hunters, its decay may well have been one of the chief of these changes. A second factor that would have tended to bring about this change is the prevalence of a belief in a god or beneficent spirit more powerful than all others and more directly concerned with the welfare of his worshippers, however this belief may have come into being. And a third factor that may have tended in the same direction is the custom of head-hunting, and the important part played by the heads in the religious life of the people. For there is solne reason to think that head-hunting is a comparatively young institution among the tribes of Sarawak.</page><page sequence="34">204 CHARLES HOSE AND W. MCDOUGALL.-The -Relations betveen But in spite of all this and although we do not think it is possible completely to disprove the truth of this hypothesis, we are inclinied to reject it. We are led to do so by four colnsiderations. In the first place, if by totemism we mean a social organisation consisting in the division of a people into groups or clans, each of which worships or holds in superstitiouLs reg,ard one or more kinds of animal or plant or other natural objects to which the members of the group claim to be related by blood or by descent, then it seems to -us sufficiently wonderful that this system should have existed among peoples so remote from one another in all thilngs, save certain of the external conditions of life, as the Indians of North America and the indigenies of Australia. And it seems to us that to invoke tlhe aid of the hypothesis of totemism-l in the past to explain the existence of a set of animal or plant superstitions in any particular case is but to increase the mystery that shrouds their origin; for unless it can be shown that the adoption or development of totemism by anly people brings with it immense advantages for them in the struggle for existence, every fresh case in which the evidence compels us to admlit its occurLrence, whether in the past or as a still flourishing institution, can but increase the wonder with which we have to regard its wide distribution. Secondly, we have in the total absenice of totemisma amorng the Punans very strong ground for rejectingi the suggestion of its previous existence among the Kenyahs. For in physical characters, in language, and, as far as the difference in the mode of life permits, in custorrms and beliefs the Punans resemble the Kenyahs so closely that we miiust assume them to be closely allied by blood, and it seems probable that the Punans have merely persisted in the social condition from which the Kenyahs ancd other tribes have been raised by the adoption of agriculture and the practice of building substantial houses. Yet, as we have said, the Punans, although in that conidition of nomadic hunters which is probably the most favourable to the development and persistence of totemism, observe hardly any restrictions in their hunting, and in fact seem to kill and eat with equal freedomi almost every bird alnd beast of the jungle, shootinig them with the blowpipe alnd poisolled darts with consuiumate skill. The only exceptions to this rule are, as far as we know, the omen-birds, and as we have said, it seems doubtful whether even these are excepted in the case of Punans who have not liad much intercourse with other peoples. Thirdly, although it may be said that even at the present timne many of the features of the religious side of totemism are present, we have inot been able to discover any traces of a social organisation based upon totemism. There is no trace of any general division of the people of aniy tribe into groups which claim specially intimate relations with differenit animals, except in the case of the Kalamantans; anld in their case such special relations seem to be the result merely of the different conditions under which the various scattered groups now live. There are no restrictions in the choice of a wife that might indicate a rule of endogamy or exogamy. There are no ceremonies to initiate youths into tribal mysteries; certaini ceremonies irn which the youths take a leadinig part are directed</page><page sequence="35">1Ven and Animals in Sarawak. 205 exclusively to training them for war and the taking of heads in battle. We know of no instance of any groiip of people beinig named after an aniimal or plant which is claimed as a relative anid in the case of the more homogeneous tribes, such as the Kelnyahs and Kayans, all prohibitions with regard to animals and all benefits conferred by them are shared equally by all the miiembers of any one community and, with but very few exceptions, are the samie for all the communities of the tribe. Lastly, we thinik it unnecessary to regard the animal superstitions of these tribes as survivals of totemism, because it seems possible to find a more direct and natural explanation of almnost every case. The numerous cases seem to fall into two groups, the superstitious practices concerned with the sacrificial animnals, the pig, annd fowl, on the one hand, and all those concernied with the various other animals on the other hanid. Tllese latter may, we think, be regarded as the expressionl of the direct and logical reaction of the mind of the savage to tho impression made uponl it by the beliaviour of the aniimals. It has been admuirably shown by Professor Lloyd Morgan' holw we ourselves, and even professed psychologists among us, tend to overestimate the comiiplexity of the meDtal processes of animals, and there can be no doubt that savages genlerally are subject to this error in a very much greater degree, that, in fact, they make, without questioning, and in most cases without explicit statemenlt even to themselves, the practical assumption that the miiental processes of animals, their passions, desires and motives, arid powers of reasoning are of the same order as and in fact extremely sinmilar to their own. That the Kenyahs entertain this belief in a very practical manner is shown by their conduct when preparing for a hunting or fishinig excutrsion. If, for example, they ar-e preparing to poison the fish of a sectioni of the river with the "tuba" root, they always speak of the matter as little as possible and use the most indlirect and fanciful modes of expression.; thus they will say, " There are many leaves fallen here," meaning, " There are plenty of fish in this part of the river." And these elaborate precautions are taken lest the birds should overhear their remarks alnd inform the fish of their intentions when of course the fish would niot stay to be caligoht but would swim away to somre other part of the river. Since this belief seems to be common to all or almost all savages and primitive peoples, it would be a stranige thing if prohibitions against killingT and eating certain animals and various superstitious practices in regard to animals were not practically universal amolng them. Bearing in mind the reality of this belief in the minlds of these people, it is easy to understanid why they should shrinik fromii killing, ally creature so malig,nant-lookinig and powerful for harm as a snake, and why they should feel utneasy iin the presence of, and to somie extent dread, the maias and the long-inosed iiioiikey, creatures whose resemblance to man seemris even to us somewhat uncanniiy. Their objection to killing their troublesome dog,s seems Introduction to Comparative Psyckology, and elsewhere.</page><page sequence="36">206 CHARLES HOSE AND W. MCDOUGALL.-The Relations between to be due to a somewhat similar feeling, a recognition of intelligence and emotions not unlike their own, bit mysteriously hidden from them by the dumbness of the aniimals. In the same way it is clear that it is but a very simple and logical inference that the crocodiles are a friendly race, and but the clearest dictate of prudence to avoid offending creatures so powerful and agile for if they were possessed of the mental powers attributed to them by the imagination of the people, they might easily make it impossible for men to travel upon the rivers and dwell on their banks. A similar process would lead to the prohibition against the eating of the tioer-cat, the only large and dalngerous carniivore. The origin of the prohibitions against killing and eating deer alnd hiorLned cattle is perhaps not so clear. But it must be rememnbered that until very recently the only horned cattle kniown to the tribes of the interior were the wild cattle (the Saladang of the Malay peninsula), very fierce and powerful creatures. These wild cattle hide themselves in the remotest recesses of the forests, and as they are but very rarely seeni, they may well be regarded as somewhat mysterious and awful. Deer, on the other hand, abound in the forests and like most deer are very timid, and it is perhaps their timidity that has led in some cases to the prohibition against their flesh, for we have seen how a IKenyah chief feared lest his little son, safe at home a hundred miles away, should be infected with the deer's timidity if he should come in contact with the skin of one, In another case we have seen that by the people of one community deer are regarded as relatives or as containing the souls of their ancestors, and that this belief probably had its origin in the fact that deer are in the habit of frequentilng the grassy clearings made about the toinbs by the people. And we saw that a similar belief in the case of certain carPivores probably had a similar origin. We think that even the elaborate cult of the hawk anld of the other omen- birds is to be explained on these lines. If we think of his erratic behaviolir, how he will come suddenly rushing down out of the remotest blue of the sky to hover overhead and then perhaps to circle hither and thither in an apparently. aimless manner, or will keep flyilng on before a boat on the river or come swiftly to meet it screaming as he comes,-if we think of this, it is easy to understand how a people whose whole world consists of dense forests and dangerous rivers, a people extremely ignorant, yet intelligent and speculative and always looking out for signs that shall guide them among the mystery and dangers that surround them, may have come to see in the hawk a messenger sent to them by the beneficent Supreme Being. For this Being is vaguely conceived by them as dwelling in the skies, whence the hawk comes, and whither he so often returns. And then we may suppose that the messenger himself has come to be an object of worship in various degrees with the different tribes, as seems to be the rule in all religions systems in which servants of a deity mediate between him and man.</page><page sequence="37">Men and Animals in Sarawak. 207 The origin of the various rites in which the fowl and pig are sacrificed, and their blood smeared or sprinkled on muen or on the altar-posts of gods, or on the image of the hawk, and their souls charged with messages to the Supreme Being- the origin of this group of customs must be sought in a different direction. To anyone acquainted with Robertson Smith's Religion of the Senrites, and with Mr. Jevons's Jntroduction to the History of Religion, the idea naturally suggests itself that these animals are or were true totems, of which the cult has passed into at late stage of decay. It might be supposed that, being originally totem animals, they thereby became domesticated by their worshippers, that they were occasionally slain as a rite for the renewal of the 'bond between them and their worshippers, their blood being smeared or sprinkled on the latter, and their flesh ceremonially eaten by them, and that the eating of them has become more and more frequent, until now every religious rite, of however small importance, is made the occasion for the killing and eating of them. It might also be supposed that, with the development or the adoption of the conception of a Supreme Being, the original purpose and character of the rites had become obscure, so that the slaughtered animials are now regarded in some cases as sacrifices offered to the deity. But we do not think that this temptiig hypothesis as to the origin of the rites can be upheld in this case. In the first place the wild pig of the jungle is hunted in sport and killed and eaten freely by all the various tribes, and is, in fact, treated on the whole with less respect and ceremony than perhaps any other animal. Secondly, the doinestic pig differs so much from the wild pig that Mr. Oldfield Thomas has proniounced it to be of a different species, and it seems likely that it has been introduced to Borneo by the Chinese at a comparatively recent date. Further, there is reasoin to suppose that the custom of sacrificing pigs and fowls arose through the substitution of them for human beings in certain rites. For there is a number of rites, of which it is admitted by the people that the slaughter of human beings was formnerly a central feature; of these, the most important and the mnost widely spread are the fuLneral rites of a great chief, the rites at the building of a new house, and those on returning from a successful war expedition. In all these, fowls or pigs are now substituted as a rule, but we know of instances in which in recent years human beings were the victims. Thus some six years ago, on the death of the chief of a community of Kalamantans (the Orang Bukit), a slave was bought by his son, and a feast was made, and the slave was killed through each manl of the community giving him a slight cut with his parang. This was said to be the revival of an old and almost obsolete custom. In another recent case, wheni a mixed party of Kayans and Kenyahs returned from a successful war expedition, only the Kenyahs had secured heads. The Kayans therefore took an old woman, one of the captives, and killed her by driving a long pole against her abdomen, as many of them as possible taking part by holding and helping to thrust the pole. The head was then divided among the parties of Kayaris, and pieces of the flesh were hung on poles beside the river, just as is</page><page sequence="38">208 CHARLES HosE AND W. MCDOUGALL.-ThC Relations betwteen done with the flesh of slain enemies andc with the flesh of the pigs that are always slaughtered on such occasions. It was said that this killilng of a human being was equivalent to killing a pig, only much finer. Kayans tell us that they used to kill slaves at the death of a chief, usually three, but at least one, and that they nailed them to the tomb, in order that they might accompany the chief on his long journey to the other world and paddle the canoe in which he must travel. This is no longer done, but a wooden figure of a man is put up at the head and another of a woman at the foot of the coffin of a chief as it lies in state before the funleral. And a small wooden figure of a man is usually fixed on the top of the tomb, and it is said that this is to row the canoe for the chief. A live fowl is usually tied to this figure, and although it is said to be put there merely to eat the grubs, we think there can be no doubt that we see here goilno, on the process of substitution of fowl for slave. In building a new house it is customary among almost all these tribes to put a fowl ilnto the hole dug to receive the first of the piles which are to support the house, and to allow the end of the pile to fall upon the fowl so as to kill it. The Kenyahs admit that formerly a girl was usually killed in this way, and there is reason to believe that in all cases a human victim was fornmerly the rule, and that the fowl is a substitute merely. In the following cases, too, we see the idea of substitution of fowls or pigs for men. It is customary with the Malanaus of Niah to kill fowls and put them together with eggs on poles in the caves in which the swifts build the edible nests, in order to secure a good crop of nests. One year when the nests were scanty they bought a slave in Brunei and killed him in the cave in the hope of increasinig the lntmber of nests. It was formerly the custom to exact a fine of one or more slaves as punish- mrent for certain offences, e.g., the accidental settinig fire to a house. At the present time, when slaves are scarcer than of yore, slaves are rarely given in such cases, but usually brass gongs, always accompanied by a pig. Now when slaves were killed and niailed to the tomb of a chief the purpose was perfectly clear and simple. It was done in just the same spirit in which the weapons and shield and clothing, are still always hung on the tomb of a deceased warrior in order that his soul may not be without them on the journey to the other world. On the introduction of the domestic pig it may well have become customary for the poorer classes, who could not afford to kill a slave, or for families which owned no slaves, to kill a pig as in some degree a compensation for the want of human victims. If such a custom were once introduced it may well have spread rapidly from motives of both economy and humanity, for slaves are as a rule very kindly treated by their masters, anid in many cases come to be regarded as members of their family. We may suppose, too, that formerly it was the custom to kill a slave when prayers of public importance were made to the Supreme Being in order that the</page><page sequence="39">Men and Animals in Sarawak. 209 soul of the slave might carrv the prayer to him. If this was the case, the substitu- tion of pig for slave, on the introduction of the domestic pig, may be even more readily conceived to have become customary, when we remember that these people regard the souls of animals as essentially similar to their own. If such a custom of substitution once gained a footing it would naturally become usual to take the opportunity of communicating with the higher powers whenever a pig was to be slaughtered. This view, that in all sacrifices the pig and fowl are but substitutes for human victims, finds very strong support in the following facts :-The Kalabits, a tribe inhabiting the north-western corner of the Baram district, breed the water- buffalo and use it in cultivating their land. It has probably been introduced to this area from North Borneo at a recent date. The religious rites of these people closely resemble those of the tribes with which we have been dealing above, but in all cases in which pigs are sacrificed by the latter buffaloes are used by the Kalabits. The rite of sprinkling the blood of pigs and fowls on men and on the altar- posts and images may, we think, be an extension or adaptation of the blood- brotherhood ceremony. We have seen that with the Kayans and Kenyahs the essential feature of this ceremony is the drawing of a little blood from the arm of the two men, either of whom then drinks or consumes in a cigarette the blood of the other one. Such a rite calls for no remote explanation; it seems to have suggested itself naturally to the minds of primitive people all the world over, as a process for the cementing of friendship. When two hostile communities wished to make a permanent peace with one another it would be natural that they should wish to perform a ceremony similar to the rite of blood-brotherhood. But the interchange of drops of blood between large numbers of persons would obviously be inconvenient, and if the idea of substituting fowls and pigs for human victims had once taken root in their minds, it would have been but a small step to substitute their blood for human blood in the peace-making ceremonies. We have seen above (p. 183) that in such a ceremony fowls are exchanged by the two parties, so that the men of either party are smeared with the blood of the fowl originally belonging to the other party. It may be that here, too, the blood of slaves was formerly used, but of this we have no evidence. The custom of smearing the blood of fowls and pigs on the two parties to a friendly compact having been arrived at in this way, the rite might readily be extended to the cases in which the hawk, represented by his wooden image, or the Supreme Being, also represented by an image, is invoked as one of the parties to the compact. We are inclined to think that in some such way as we have here suggested, namely, by the substitution of pigs and fowls for human victims, and of their blood for human blood, the origin of the customs of sacrificing fowls and pigs, and of ceremonially sprinkling their blood, may be explained. We conclude, then, that the various superstitions entertained by these tribes in regard to animals are not to be looked upon as survivals of totem-worship, but that they may all be explained in a simpler and more satisfactory manner. But VOL. XXXI, P</page><page sequence="40">210 CHARLES HosE ANTD W. MCDOUGALL.-The Jeiations between before bringing our paper to an end we would point out that among the facts we have described there are some which seem to suggest a possible and indeed, as it seems to us, a very natural and probable mode of origin of totem-worship. We refer to the varieties of the " Nyarong " of the Ibans and sporadic analogous cases among the other tribes. We have seen that the " Nyarong " may assume the form of some curious natural object or of some one animal, distinguished from its fellows by some slight peculiarity, which receives the attentions of some one man only. In such cases the " Nyarong " is hardly distinguishable from a fetish, In other cases the man, being unable to distinguish the particular animal which he believes to be animated by his " Nyarong," extends his regard and gratitude to the whole species. In such a case it seems difficult to deny the name "individual totem " to the species if the term is to be used at all. In other cases, again, all the members of a man's family and all his descendants, and if he be a chief all the members of the community over which he rules, may come to share in the benefits conferred by the "Nyarong," and in the feeling of respect for and in performing rites in honour of the species of animal in one individual of which it is supposed to reside. In such cases the species approaches very closely the clan-totem in some of its varieties. (In speaking of the "Kobong" of certain natives of Western Australia, Sir G. Grey1 says, "This arises from the family belief that some one individual of the species is their nearest friend to kill whom would be a great crime, and to be carefully avoided.") Of similar cases among other tribes of guardian-animals appearing to men in dreams and claiming their respect and gratitude, we must mention the case of Aban Jau, a powerful chief of the Sebops, a sub-tribe of Kenyahs. He had hunted and eaten the wild pig freely like all other Kenyahs, until once in a dream a wild boar appeared to him and told him that he had always helped him in his fighting. Thereafter Abaln Jani refused, until tbe day of his death, to kill or eat both the wild and the domestic pig, although he would still consult for omens the livers of pigs killed by others. We have described above (p. 190) how a Kayaii may become blood-brother to a crocodile in a dream, and may thereafter be called Baiya (crocodile), and how in this way one Kayan chief had come to regard himself as both son and nephew to crocodiles, and how he believed that they brought him success in hunting and carried him ashore when (in a dream) he had fallen into the river. The cousin of this chief, too, regarded himself as specially befriended by crocodiles because his great-grandfather had become b]ood-brother to one in a dream. So it is clear that the members of the family to which these young men belong are likely to continue to regard themselves as related by blood to the crocodiles and bound to them by special ties of gratitude. In another case we saw how all the people of one household regard themselves as related to the crocodiles and specially favoured by them, explaining the relation as due to one of their ancestors having become a crocodile. In 1 Quoted in Mr. Frazer's Totemism, p. 8.</page><page sequence="41">Aen and Animals in Sarawak. 211 another case we saw that somne ill-defined relation to the gibbon is claimed by a community of Kenyahs, whose house is decorated with carvings of the form of the gibbon, and whose members will not kill the gibbon. And in yet another case we saw that a Kayan house is decorated with conventionalised carvings of some animal whose species has been forgotten by the community. In each of these last three cases it seems highly probable that the special relation to the animal was established by some such process as we see going on in the preceding case, so that we seem to have in this series of cases one of incipient totemism alnd others illustrating various stages of decay of abortive beginnings of totemism. And it is easy to imagine how in the absence of unfavourable conditions such begilnnings might grow to a fully developed totem-system. For suppose that in any one community there happened to be at one time two or more prosperous families,' each claiming to be related with 'and protected by some species of animal as the result of friendly overtures made by the animals to members of the families in their dreams; it would then be highly probable that members of other families, envious of the good fortune of these, would have similar dream-experiences and so come to claim a similar protection, until very soon the members of any family that could claim no such protection would come to be regarded as unfortunate and even somewhat disreputable beinlgs, while the faith of one family in its guardian-animal would react upon and strengthen the faith of others in theirs. So a system of clan-totems would be established, around which would grow up various myths of origin, various mag,ical practices, alnd various religious rites. It is well known that such dreams as convince the Iban, the Kayan, and the Kenyah of the reality of his special relation to some animal and lead him to respect all animals of some one species produce similar results in other parts of the world. We quote the following passages from Mr. Frazer's remarks on individual totems in his book on totemism:- " An Australian seems usually to get his individual totem by dreaming that he has been transformed into an animal of that species." " In America the individual totem is usually the first animal of which a youth dreams during the long and generally solitary fasts which American Indians observe at puberty." Such dream experiences are, then, the vera cansa of the inception of faith in individual totems among the peoples in which totemism is most highly developed, and among the tribes of Sarawak we find cases which illustrate how a similar faith, strengthened bv further dreams and by the good fortune of its possessor, may spread to all the members of his family or of his household and to his descendants, until in some cases the guardian-animal becomes almost, though not quite, a clan-totem. The further development of such incipient totems among these tribes is probably prevented at the present time, not 'only by their agricultural habits, but also by their passionate addiction to war and fighting and head-hunting; for these pursuits necessitate the strict subordination of each community to its chief and compel all families to unite in the cult of the hawk to the detriment of all other</page><page sequence="42">212 CHARLES HOSE AND W. MCDOUGALL.-The Relationts between animal-cults, because the hawk is, by its habits, so much better suited than any other animal to be a guide to them on warlike expeditions.' The prevalence of the belief in a Stupreme Being must also tend to prevent the development of totemism, and we cannot conclude without saying something as to the possible origin of this conception of a beneficent Being more powerful th-ian all others, who sends guidance and warnings by the omeni-birds, and receives and aniswers the prayers carried to him by the souls of the fowls ancl pigs. It might be thought that this conception of a beneficent Supreme Beinig has l)een borrowed directly or indirectly from the Malays. Buit we do not think that this view is tenable in face of the fact that while the conception is a living belief amonrg the Madanus, a tribe eloselv allied to the Kenyahs that inhabits a district in the remuotest interior anid has haad no intercourse with Malays, the Ibans, who have lia I far miiore intercourse with tlle Malays than have the Kayans and Kenyahs, yet show least trace of this conception. As Archdeacon Perham has written of the Ibans, there are traces of the belief in one supreme God which sulggest that the idea is one that has been prevalent, but has now almost died out. We are inclined rather to suppose that the tribes of the interior, such as the Kenyahs and Kayans, have evolved the conception for themselves, and that in fact Balli Penyalong of the Kenyahs is their god of war exalted above all others by the ilmlportance of the department of human activity over which he presides; for we have seeln that they have conceived other gods, Ballingo, the god of thunder, Balli Sungei, the god of the rivers, whose anger is shown by the boiling flood, and Balli Atap, wlho keeps harm from the house, while the Kayans have gods of life, a creator of the world, Laki Kalira Murei, a god of harvesting, and others. It seems to us that the only difficult step in such a simple and direct evolution of the idea of a beneficent Supreme Being is the conception of gods or spirits that perform definite fuinctions, such as Balli Atap, who guards the house, and the gods that preside over harvestilng and war, as distinct from suchl gods or spirits as Ballingo and Balli Sungei. But there seems to be no douibt that this step has been taken by these peoples and that these various gods of abstract function have been evolved by them. And it seems to ius that were a god of war once conceived it would be inevitable that, among communities whose chief interest is war and whose prosperity and very existelnce depend upon success in battle, such a god of battles should come to predominate over all others andl to claim the almost exclusive regard of his worshippers. Such a predolmiinance would be given the more easily to one god by these people because the necessity for strict subordination to their chiefs has familiarised them with the principle of obedience of subjects to a single ruler; I Dr. Boas is of the opirnion that the totems of the Indialns of British Columbia have been developed from the personal " nmanitous," the guardian animals acquired by youths in dreams. Miss A. C. Fletcher is led to a similar conclusion by a study of the totems of the Omaha tribe of Indians (inmport of thie Totein), Salem, Mass., 1897). The facts described above in connection with the " Nyarong " of the Ibans and similar allied institutions among other tribes of Sarawak wouldl seem, then, to support the views of these authors as to the origin of totemism.</page><page sequence="43">Men and Animals in Sarawak. 213 while the belneficelnce of the Supreme Being thus evolved would inevitably result, for the god of battles must seem beneficenlt to the victors, and among, these people onily the victors sutrvive. Again, this conception is one that undoubtedly mliakes for riglhteouslness, because it reflects the charactel of the people, who, within the community and the tribe, are decent, humane, and honest folk. We are conscious of presumiiption in venturling to adopt the view that the concelption of a beneficent Supremile Being miiay possibly be neither the end nor the beginning of religion, nleither time final result of all evolutionl, euhelmeristic, totemistic, or other, prolonged throulgh countless ages and generations, nlor part of the stock-ini-trade of primiiitive iliaII mysteriously given, as Mr. Lang' seems to wish to niiake believe. Yet we are disposed to regard this conception as one that, amid the perpetual flux of opinion and belief which obtains among peoples destitute of written records, imiay be comparatively rapidly and easily arrived at under favour- able conditions, such as seeni to be afforded by tribes like the Kenyahs and Kayans, war-like, prosperous tribes subordinated to stroiig chiefs, amid miiay as rapidly fall ilnto negrlect with change of social conditions, and liay tlhell remain as a vestige only to be discernled by curious research in the minds of a few individuals, as amiiong the Ibains or the Australian blacks, until another turn of Fortune's wheel, perlhaps the birth of some overmastering personality or a revival of national or tribal vigoUlm, gives it a miew period of life and power. We hope to give some account of the superstitions of these people in regard to plants in a separate paper. Here we will only miention that none of the facts of this kind klnown to uIs seem to niake against the views we have taken of the mean- ing an(l origiii of some of the allimal-cults.
