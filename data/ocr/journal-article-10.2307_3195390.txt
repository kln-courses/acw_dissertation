<plain_text><page sequence="1">Recollecting Nature: George Eliot's "Ilfracombe Journal" and Victorian Women's Natural History Writing MARY ELLEN BELLANCA "The fascination of the scenery and zoology here have been terribly un- propitious to my work," George Eliot wrote to a friend in June, 1856, "and I have been writing with only half of my brains" (Letters 2: 254). The fasci- nating place was the resort town of Ilfracombe on the North Devonshire coast in southwestern England, where Eliot and George Henry Lewes took a seven-week working holiday in May and June. In her written "Recollec- tions" of this visit, set down in her journal and so also known as the "Ilfra- combe Journal," Eliot luxuriates in sensuous descriptions of long country walks and narrates intrepid searches of the tidepools for interesting sea- weeds and marine animals. Her account of a favorite walk, where "the banks of the lanes [were] made peculiarly lovely by a delicate trefoil," con- cludes with a panoramic survey of the seascape: "As we came home again the sea stretching beyond the massive hills towards the horizon looked all the finer to us because we had been turning our backs upon it, and con- templating another sort of beauty" (247).1 1 For simplicity I refer to Marian Evans as George Eliot in this essay, although she had not yet adopted the pseudonym.

Eliot's most sustained piece of writing about natural history, the "Ilfracombe Journal" takes part in an energetic cultural discourse as it gives voice to her personal exploration of a new landscape. Training a nat- uralist's observing eye on Ilfracombe's hills and shore, Eliot insists on the importance of seeing empirical facts while she fictionalizes her experience and re-enacts her discovery of surprising and "exquisite" life forms (243) in a new environment. Essentially a memoir of a visited place, this purportedly private text also reads like a proto-essay or narrative meant for publication. Like Eli- ot's other journal memoirs, such as "How I Came to Write Fiction" or her "Recollections" of various other places, the "Ilfracombe Journal" is written in discursive paragraphs rather than discrete entries about particular days. It has a beginning, a middle, and an end. A loose fabric of stylistic threads woven from different genres-daily diary, naturalist's journal, travel narrative, familiar essay-the journal combines reports of technical studies in marine zoology with dreamy musings about walks with a be- loved companion. Further, it both draws upon and rewrites conventions of Victorian natural history and science writing by women. Eluding place- ment in any category, the "Ilfracombe Journal" shows what a plastic and malleable form the journal could be. Writing it, Eliot stretched the genre as a means of representing encounters with the other-than-human world, ex- perimenting with the journal's capabilities for recollecting perceptions and for re-creating her own versions of nature in her text. The "Ilfracombe Journal" has often been treated as bearing an ancillary relationship to some other development in Eliot's, or even Lewes's, career. It is, we may read, an artifact of an epochal moment when Eliot was "poised on the threshold of fiction" (Haight 191). It is considered a sign of Eliot's interest in theoretical science, a scribal draft meant to help Lewes with his work, and a response to John Ruskin's call for truth to nature in Modern Painters III, which Eliot had recently praised in the Westminster Re- view.2 Scholars have long recognized, moreover, that Eliot used images and concepts from natural history and science in her novels, and that her interest in acute observation, expressed in the "Ilfracombe Journal," 2 For more on these assessments, see Haight 197-98, 200-01; Letters 2: 245n.; Fre- derick R.

The "Ilfracombe Journal" shows Eliot literally getting her hands dirty in a popular and intellectual amusement that had become a cultural pre- occupation. By the 1850s, the Victorian "romance" with natural history was in full flower as both a form of serious knowledge and a fashionable pastime (Merrill 3-49). Nineteenth-century culture sanctioned the study of nature as an enjoyable way to get fresh air and exercise, to use one's "ra- tional" faculties, and to learn about the wonders of the created world. Though women were largely excluded from the institutional study of sci- ence, they made up a large part of the culture of science and natural histo- ry. They identified, catalogued, and made illustrations of plants, birds, and insects, and they read numerous books and articles about natural his- tory and taught children about it at home (Gates 289-91; Shteir 173-231). Women writers such as Jane Marcet, Jane Loudon, Anne Pratt, Rosina Zornlin, and others interpreted science and made it accessible to readers by publishing popular and educational books (Gates 289-90). Eliot was well in tune with other Victorians when she sought a "smattering of bota- ny from Miss [Agnes] Catlow" (Letters 2: 369), one of many women au- thors who made botanical information widely available.4 Eliot acknowledged sharing in her contemporaries' love of nature's particulars when she wrote on holiday in 1852, "I am profiting, body and mind, from quiet walks and talks with Nature-gathering 'Lady's Bedstraw' and 'Rest Harrow' and other pretty things-picking up shells (literally)" (2: 46).5 3 For some details on nature and natural history in Eliot's novels, see Karen Mann, "Self, Shell and World: George Eliot's Language of Space," Genre 15 (Winter 1982) 447-76. In George Eliot and Nineteenth-Century Science: The Make-Believe of a Be- ginning (Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1984), Sally Shuttleworth discusses natural history not as a popular phenomenon but as a "passive" approach to observation and a "static" world view that was superseded in Eliot's fiction by scientific con- cepts of organicism and development (xii, 24-50, and passim). 4 Among Agnes Catlow's books are Popular Field Botany (second edition, 1849); Popular Garden Botany (1855); and Popular Greenhouse Botany (1857). 5 As Haight's note to this letter explains, Isaac Newton was quoted as saying: "I do not know what I may appear to the world, but to myself I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the sea-shore, and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me" (qtd. in Letters 2: 46n.). Haight's source is Sir David Brewster, The Life of Sir Isaac Newton (1831), 338.</page><page sequence="4">22 RECOLLECTING NATURE Seaside flora and fauna offered middle- and working-class people a new fascination at midcentury, after railroads had made the coasts more accessible to travelers (Allen 124-27, 136-38). Aspiring seaside naturalists demanded, and bought, guidebooks on "the marvels of ocean-life" (Lewes, Sea-side vii). Among these were Anne Pratt's Chapters on the Com- mon Things of the Sea-side (1850), Mary Roberts's Popular History of the Mol- lusca (1851), and Charles Kingsley's Glaucus, or the Wonders of the Shore (1855), as well as Lewes's own articles in Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine that became his book Sea-side Studies (1858). When Eliot and Lewes scoured the beaches of Ilfracombe, gathering information that would ap- pear in Lewes's work, they could well have run into other prospective au- thors-authors such as Margaret Gatty, who spent fourteen years researching her work on British Seaweeds (Gates 297). The "Ilfracombe Journal" can be situated among these texts and many others that celebrated and promoted Devonshire and its coast. Improved roads and the construction of rail links in the 1840s and 1850s had made the formerly isolated Ilfracombe much easier to reach from population centers, and it became the most important resort in North Devon (Travis 84, 127). In a series of essays on North Devon in Fraser's Magazine in 1849 and 1850, Charles Kingsley lamented that "no good artist or poet" had done justice to "the beauties of this remote district," and he invited read- ers to let "an old North Devon man...show you what the land is like" (1, 5). Other writers must have heeded the call, for the 1850s witnessed a flourishing sub-industry in Devonshire travel and natural history books, such as Gosse's A Naturalist's Rambles on the Devonshire Coast (1853), Charlotte Chanter's Ferny Combes: A Ramble after Ferns in the Glens and Valleys of Devonshire (1856), and George Tugwell's A Manual of the Sea- anemones Commonly Found on the English Coast (1856). By 1856, Tugwell himself was complaining in a Fraser's article called "Science by the Sea- side" that natural history dilettantes were "swarming on our coasts like blow flies in summer time" from the "desire of being thought scientific" (255). For Eliot, the visit to Ilfracombe was part field trip and part getaway. While there she wrote two magazine articles, but she was distracted both by her plans to write fiction and by the desire to "do nothing but drink in wonders and beauties on the rocky beach and along the lovely lanes" (Journals 20 July 1856; Letters 2: 255). She and Lewes climbed on the rocks, rowed out in a boat, and carted baskets and jars of zoological treasures back to their lodgings. Eliot describes the clutter surrounding naturalists' field research: You would laugh to see our room decked with yellow pie-dishes, afoot- pan, glass jars and phials, all full of zoophytes or molluscs or annelids- and still more to see the eager interest with which we rush to our 'pre-</page><page sequence="5">MARY ELLEN BELLANCA 23 serves' in the morning to see if there has been any mortality among them in the night. (Letters 2: 252) If the "Ilfracombe Journal" is a source of information about these activ- ities, it is also a reconstructed "recollection" of Eliot's experiences. She kept brief entries in a notebook diary during the weeks at Ilfracombe, but wrote the more elaborate "Recollections of Ilfracombe" in the reverse end of the book several weeks after she and Lewes moved on, at the end of June, to Tenby on the Welsh coast.6 Composition apparently took place in the first two or three weeks of July, for on the twentieth Eliot wrote in the diary: The fortnight has slipped away without my being able to show much result from it. I have written a review of the "Lover's Seat" for the "Leader", and jotted down some recollections of Ilfracombe; besides these trifles and the introduction to an article already written, I have done no visible work. (Journals 20 July 1856) The text is headed "Recollections of Ilfracombe" and dated "Tenby, July 22, 1856," almost a month after she left Ilfracombe (Letters 2: 252). Although some portions of Eliot's "Ilfracombe" were incorporated into Lewes's "Sea-side Studies,"7 there is no evidence to suggest that Eliot took steps to publish her text on her own. It was Lewes who was actively plan- ning articles about the "ocean-life" at Ilfracombe and Tenby. Indeed, Eliot disparaged the articles she had published in Fraser's in 1854 about travel- ing to Weimar, articles edited from her journal and from research material she collected in a notebook (Wiesenfarth xviii): "The [first] article is merely a sketch which I wrote at the wrong end of my journal, and is worth lit- tle"-except that it could earn money (Letters 2: 201). But despite Eliot's offhand dismissal of the "Ilfracombe Journal" as a "trifle," it displays signs of craft that hint she may have had in mind the wave of recent seaside publications. This text has a distinct and playful sense of audience. It contains more description and commentary than Eli- 6 I am indebted to Margaret Harris, who with Judith Johnston is editing the forthcoming Journals of George Eliot, for kindly providing their working draft of the diary text for the weeks at Ilfracombe. I am also grateful to Judith Johnston for providing helpful information on the manuscript of "Recollections of Ilfra- combe." 7 Phrases and passages from the "Ilfracombe Journal" were incorporated into the first two parts of Lewes's magazine series "Sea-side Studies," where he de- scribes the town and its environs; these installments, with some expansion, be- came the first two chapters of his book Sea-side Studies. Material from "Ilfracombe" appears in Sea-side Studies 7-8, 15, 30-31, and 73-77 passim.</page><page sequence="6">24 RECOLLECTING NATURE ot's diary, inviting the reader to engage fully with her remembered expe- rience of Ilfracombe. In addition, significant differences among Eliot's accounts in her diary, letters, and journal betray the constructedness, even the idealization, of her experience as she narrates it in the "Ilfracombe Journal." For example, "Ilfracombe" begins with the conventional opening of a periodical travel essay, the details surrounding departure from home: "It was a cold unfriendly day-the 8th of May on which we set out for Ilfra- combe" (238). This opening is similar to Kingsley's account of his departure in "North Devon" and to the opening of Eliot's own article "Three Months in Weimar" (Kingsley 11; Pinney, Essays 83). Such a beginning for the "I1- fracombe Journal" launches this version of events with a charge of narra- tive energy-what Eliot calls in Daniel Dronda the "make-believe of a beginning," the enabling condition and starting point of scientific narrative. "Ilfracombe" reports appreciatively but selectively on the local natural environment, omitting less pleasant details such as the coldness of the air, about which Eliot complained in a letter (2: 254). Further, Eliot represents differently in the diary and journal a long walk on which she Lewes be- came lost. The diary communicates mainly weariness and frustration: Eli- ot and Lewes follow an "interminable road," make a random choice at a fork, walk "on and on without seeing any indication of our being in the right direction," and finally ask the way at a farmhouse. The diary version concludes, "We got home a little before six, after walking three hours and a half, and were thoroughly knocked up" (Uournals 15 May 1856). In con- trast, the "Ilfracombe Journal" elaborates more and breezily makes the ep- isode into a carefree adventure. At the fork in the road, Eliot and Lewes "prove the existence of free will by making a choice without a motive." At the farmhouse they learn "the half comforting, half distracting informa- tion that we were on the right way for Ilfracombe" but still two miles away. Eliot's narrator ends this version by commenting, "It requires some desperate courage to make these interrogatory visits to lone farm-houses, for you are likely to get a prompt but not categorical answer to your ques- tions from a great dog who protects the premises in the absence of the males" (245-46). These different treatments suggest that Eliot was experimenting with ways of re-evaluating what had happened. Both the diary and the journal narrate more or less the same events, but the journal account is farther re- moved from the "reality" of those episodes. It flirts with fictionality in its shaping of, and emotional response to, events recalled from a distance of several weeks. Another sign that Eliot may have imagined mass readership for the journal text is her creation of a self-conscious and engaging narrative per- sona-just the sort of voice for an appealing magazine essay on the seaside</page><page sequence="7">MARY ELLEN BELLANCA 25 scene. Eliot cloaks this persona with the conventional modesty assumed by many Victorian women who published on science, making her narrator both knowledgeable and not knowledgeable about natural history. Who- ever is speaking in the "Ilfracombe Journal" clearly knows a good deal about marine zoology, dropping with apparent ease terms from annelid to zoophyte and using some two dozen scientific names. In natural history texts, the use of these terms certified the writer's authority and member- ship in an informed community; for women writers, in addition, it dem- onstrated that they could do the serious work of science as well as men. Latin nomenclature was "a form of intellectuality in itself, a sign of a larger world to which some women wanted access (but from which women were formally excluded)" (Shteir 21-25, 56). Even while Eliot's narrator uses these authentic-sounding terms, how- ever, she positions herself self-deprecatingly as a newcomer to natural his- tory who must attain knowledge gradually, in the field. Right from the beginning, "Ilfracombe" establishes both the narrator and "G." as naifs. The two arrive on the scene with a "hamper of tall glass jars, which we meant for our sea-side Vivarium" (238), and which turn out to be precisely the wrong things for keeping sea anemones. In fact, one of the delights of reading "Ilfracombe" is picturing the future author of Middlemarch awk- wardly fishing in a jar of up-ended anemones: When we put our anemones into our glass wells, they floated topsy- turvy in the water and looked utterly uncomfortable; and I was con- stantly called upon to turn up my sleeve and plunge in my arm up to the elbow to set things right. (243) The use of these jars is one of many errors that the raw "novices" (240) must correct. The need for firsthand observation, not merely book knowledge, is an insistent theme in nature journals and published natural history writing. "Field" naturalists claimed greater credibility and value for their observa- tions of living plants and animals, compared to the work of "closet" natu- ralists who studied anatomy using stuffed or dried specimens (Merrill 80- 81). Indeed, Lewes's seaside research was apparently motivated in part by T. H. Huxley's accusation that he was merely a "book scientist" (Haight 195). Accordingly, in the "Ilfracombe Journal" both Eliot's narrator and "G." must accept the mission of learning to see the animals that are their quarry: It is characteristic enough of the wide difference there is between having eyes and seeing, that in this region of Sea-anemones...we climbed about for two hours without seeing one Anemone, and went in again with scarcely anything but a few stones and weeds...</page><page sequence="8">26 RECOLLECTING NATURE On our next hunt, however, after we had been out some time, G. ex- claimed, "I see an anemone!" and we were immensely excited by the discovery of this little red Mesembryanthemum[.]...But not a polype for a long, long while could even G. detect after all his read- ing; so necessary is it for the eye to be educated by objects as well as ideas. (242-43) Although "even G." must learn to detect the elusive polyps, it is the narrator who is more often cast in the role of student: "every day I gleaned some little bit of naturalistic experience, either through G's call- ing on me to look through the microscope or from hunting on the rocks" (243). Modestly minimizing her knowledge, Eliot's narrator follows a practice common even among women science writers who are most ex- pert in their subjects (Gates 292). Jane Marcet, whose book Conversa- tions on Chemistry went into more than twenty editions in the nineteenth century, prefaced her work with disclaimers about her qual- ifications. In the 1836 edition of Conversations on Natural Philosophy, Marcet wrote that "the author" was "fully sensible of her incompetency to treat the subject in any other way than in the form of a familiar ex- planation of the first elements, for the use of very young pupils" (v). Such disclaimers shield the writer from potential criticism that she is overstepping her limits. Eliot's version of this practice is more self-mocking than self-protec- tive-possibly because the "Ilfracombe Journal" was, after all, written pri- vately, or because publication of it would have been anonymous. In any case, although Eliot may have been new to field studies when she arrived at Ilfracombe, she was certainly not uninformed about natural history. During the previous year, she and Lewes had read Gilbert White's well- known Natural History of Selborne and Thomas Rymer Jones's General Out- line of the Organization of the Animal Kingdom (Cross 1: 289; Letters 2: 228). Between 1851 and 1854, when she was its editor, the Westminster Review "developed and maintained a strong scientific section" (Phillips 212) and featured articles and book reviews about natural history that must have passed through her hands. From at least one of these books she copied quotations into a notebook (Wiesenfarth 22). The letter in which Eliot casually mentions "zoophytes or molluscs or annelids" as if these are household words (2: 252) was written six weeks before she represented herself in the "Ilfracombe Journal" as a neophyte with zoophytes. In the two months that passed between sloshing around with the glass jars and composing "Ilfracombe," Eliot read more books on zoology, marine life, and Devonshire topography, including Charlotte Chanter's Ferny Combes, which she reviewed for the Leader (Journals 5 Au-</page><page sequence="9">MARY ELLEN BELLANCA 27 gust 1856; Letters 2: 244).8 In short, all of this reading, combined with her new field experience, made her a more knowledgeable and sophisticated observer by the time she sat down to recollect her learning experience in her journal. One function of Eliot's naive narrator is to give voice to the sheer plea- sure of unfolding discovery. While the narrator and G. were searching for lodgings, the narrator says, "the beauty of Ilfracombe burst upon us, though we had as yet no glimpse of the sea and no idea-at least I had none-in which direction it lay" (240). Again and again, the narrator's su- perlatives locate the sights she sees on the edge of her experience, as if they are just rising over the horizon of her consciousness. The coast is "the most striking bit of coast I had ever beheld," Eliot writes, and "I never saw [the furze] in such abundance as here" (240, 244). These narratives of epiphany replay Eliot's responses as an observer learning to see, know, and possess objects. As journalizer she recollects, from the more privileged position of the experienced knower, what it was like to see things for the first time, and so her journal writing engages in a retrospective discourse of discovery. She "sees" in the text through vari- ous reconstructed subjectivities, versions of the writer's imaginative eye that James Krasner calls a "perceptual organ" or "narrative eye" (7). In "Il- fracombe" these "organs" are the observing eye encountering novelty, the naturalist's eye discovering unknown species, the traveler's eye register- ing appropriate aesthetic responses. Realizing a fresh visual awareness, Eliot's narrator makes these new sights part of her own perceptual repertoire. To accomplish this, new ob- jects must be named: I never before longed so much to know the names of things as dur- ing this visit to Ilfracombe. The desire is part of the tendency that is now constantly growing in me to escape from all vagueness and in- accuracy into the daylight of distinct, vivid ideas. (251) 8 These books are Philip H. Gosse, A Naturalist's Rambles on the Devonshire Coast (1853); David Landsborough, A Popular History of British Sea-weeds (1849); William Henry Harvey, The Sea-side Book: Being an Introduction to the Natural History of the British Coasts (1857); and A. de Quatrefages, Souvenirs d'un Naturaliste (Recollections ofa Naturalist), which the Westminster had reviewed in October 1854. Eliot also read aloud from "Milne Edwards's Zoology" in the evenings (Journals 30 June 1856); she and Lewes owned several of Henri Milne Edwards's numerous books, including Introduction ai la Zoologie Generale (1851), which contains markings by Lewes, and Cours Elementaire d'Histoire Naturelle-Zoologie (1851). See The George Eliot-George Henry Lewes Library: An Annotated Catalogue of Their Books at Dr. Williams's Library, London, ed. William Baker (New York: Garland, 1977), 138. Eliot's review of Ferny Combes appeared in the Leader on 16 August 1856, p. 787.</page><page sequence="10">28 RECOLLECTING NATURE In its concern with terminology, the "Ilfracombe Journal" touches on a central and contested issue in nineteenth-century natural history: whether to use common or scientific names and, if scientific, which classification system to use and whether in Latin or in English translation (Shteir 29-30, 109, 140). But no matter which names were used, all naturalists would have agreed that an object must be named something. "Knowing the names of things" enables the observer to identify and classify them; it also signi- fies mastery. For Eliot, names make possible both conceptualization and represen- tation: "The mere fact of naming an object tends to give definiteness to our conception of it-we have then a sign that at once calls up in our minds the distinctive qualities which mark out for us that particular object from all others" (251). Writing, too, gives an object a "sign" to signify its "distinc- tive qualities" and to make sure it is not forgotten. Once, reporting on her study of physiology, Eliot had connected the effort to gain knowledge with her distrust of her unaided (unwritten) memory: "I am trying to fix some knowledge about plexuses and ganglia in my soft brain, which gen- erally only serves me to remember that there is something I ought to re- member and to regret that I did not put the something down in my note- book" (Letters 2: 220). Writing wildflowers and marine animals-memoran- da, things one "ought to remember"-in her journal enables Eliot to hold in mind her percepts of these objects so that she can recollect them in the future. Thus, Eliot both writes the "Ilfracombe Journal" as an aide-memoire and reimagines her memories through the private eye of the journal writer. She also enlists a "naive" narrator, a convention of published writing, to me- diate and retell her story to some implied audience, wandering, with the invention of this persona, into quasi-fictive territory. Meanwhile, other conventions of published writing extend "Ilfracombe's" interconnections with more public discourse in the form of natural history essays and books. Eliot draws on the diverse languages used by women writers of popular natural history, joining in their celebration of nature yet eschew- ing the theological and didactic orientation of many of their works. Among the conventions Eliot adopts are personification and anthropo- morphism of plants and animals. "Ilfracombe" contains the arch wit and the incongruous comparisons between humans and other animals that are hallmarks of popular natural history. Writing the story of an encounter with a pig on a country lane, for example, Eliot mixes a pseudo-scientific Latinate style with rather precious terms such as "piggie": [W]e were descried by a black pig, probably of an amiable and so- ciable disposition. But as unfortunately our initiation in porcine physiognomy was not deep enough to allow any decisive inferenc-</page><page sequence="11">MARY ELLEN BELLANCA 29 es, we felt it an equivocal pleasure to perceive that piggie had made up his mind to join us in our walk without the formality of an intro- duction. (250) Victorian readers were accustomed to seeing plants and, especially, an- imals represented with human characteristics, including self-awareness and speaking ability.9 This anthropomorphism often placed ordinary crea- tures or mundane human experience beside lofty abstractions for enter- taining and, often, instructive effect. It is found everywhere in Parables from Nature, a widely admired collection of children's stories by Margaret Gatty (author of the exhaustive British Seaweeds) that includes endnotes providing scientific background on the plant and animal species that ap- pear as characters. In a seaside story called "Whereunto?", for example, Gatty describes a crab as able to hide between rocks or "to take a short walk from time to time, to see how matters went on" (170). Such humorous touches prepared child readers to be instructed in the story's message by delighting and amusing them with portrayals of "lower" creatures as not only sentient but having all-too-human personalities. Saying far more about human self-perceptions than about animals, Victorian anthropo- morphism reveals complex cultural beliefs: both an impulse toward sym- pathy with animals and a desire to maintain humankind at the top of the created hierarchy. Eliot plays an ironic, lighthearted version of this game when she im- plies that pigs ought to observe proper etiquette. But she maintains boundaries between the human and not-human through a detached, knowing stance rather than by asserting human dominance of nature. She also evades natural history's more dogmatic deployments of animal anal- ogies in the service of orthodox nineteenth-century Christianity. Natural theology, the belief that one can deduce truths about a divine creator from the workings of creation, is central to the writing of many Victorian wom- en who were dedicated to their readers' spiritual as well as intellectual im- provement. Their animal analogies often teach moral lessons-about the industry and cooperation of ants, for example, or the "impudence," "cru- elty," and "treachery" of cockroaches (Barber 19). In Gatty's story "Knowl- edge Not the Limit of Belief," a seaweed and a zoophyte learn that they should accept their place in nature's hierarchy and understand that "high- 9 For information on anthropomorphism and attitudes toward animals, see Barber 18-19, 80-81; and Harriet Ritvo, The Animal Estate: The English and Other Creatures in the Victorian Age (Cambridge: Harvard UP, 1987), 1-42. Ritvo provides a helpful discussion of the assignment, not always in irony, of human characteris- tics and moral responsibility to animals.</page><page sequence="12">30 RECOLLECTING NATURE er" animals have greater knowledge than "lower" ones, who should as- sent by faith to what they are taught by their betters (36). Eliot, who read a number of the same natural history authors as Gatty, did not share her religious outlook or the evangelical world view that led other writers to moralize overtly. But Eliot and Gatty shared some atti- tudes; both valued factual knowledge about nature, yet both cast a skepti- cal eye on overinvestment in knowledge-seeking, sounding cautionary notes about scientific shortsightedness. Eliot's way of sizing up human stature in the "Ilfracombe Journal" is her treatment of a familiar preoccu- pation: comparing human shelters with the "architecture" of animals' shells and nests. Many readers would have been acquainted with this to- pos from books like Sarah Trimmer's An Easy Introduction to the Knowledge of Nature, and the Holy Scriptures, which uses animal habitations to play a variation on the argument from design-the conclusion that nature's won- derfully made things must derive from an ingenious maker (157). But while Trimmer reasons "from nature up to nature's God,"10 Eliot's habitat comparison is more concerned with the kinship of humans and other animals. Her narrator compares the modest houses on Ilfracombe's steep hillsides with the "habitation of some mollusc that had secreted its shell from the material of the rock" (241). At first, she sets up natural the- ology's traditional hierarchy: "The difference between a man with his house and a mollusc with its shell lies in the number of steps or phenom- ena interposed between the fact of individual existence and the comple- tion of the building" (242). A more theistic writer might next assert human beings' God-determined superiority over other animals. But in "Ilfra- combe" Eliot affirms neither divine creation nor humans' ability to learn and "progress." Instead, she puts humankind in a distinctly less grandiose light: [W]hen one sees a house stuck on the side of a great hill, and still more a number of houses looking like a few barnacles clustered on the side of a great rock, we begin to think of the strong family like- ness between ourselves and all other building, burrowing house- appropriating and shell-secreting animals. (242) This "family likeness" does not feature human beings as the lords of archi- tecture, let alone the lords of creation. Whatever other advantages we may have over molluscs and insects in our habitations, it is clear that their architecture has the advan- tage of ours in beauty[.] Look at man in the light of a shell-fish and 10 This phrase from Alexander Pope's Essay on Man (4.332) served as a sort of motto for natural theology in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.</page><page sequence="13">MARY ELLEN BELLANCA 31 it must be admitted that his shell is generally ugly, and it is only af- ter a great many more "steps or phenomena" that he secretes here and there a wonderful shell in the shape of a temple or a palace. (242) Eliot's commentary opens a chink in the Victorian armor of confidence about human domination of nature. It also rather craftily puts anthropo- morphism in reverse, shifting the terms from animal "architecture" to hu- man "shells." These passages show Eliot musing about issues in "natural science" that would interest her throughout her career-though none too seriously; she is on holiday, after all. For the most part, the "Ilfracombe Journal" pro- vides a glimpse of Eliot at a kind of serious writerly play, both with natural history and with the protean potential of the journal. Given the text's fic- tive elements and its engaging style, one is tempted to speculate that she toyed with the idea of making it into a magazine essay. An experienced writer and editor who knew that natural history prose was in demand, Eli- ot must also have known that publications based-or purportedly based-on naturalists' journals made a thriving enterprise. Successful published "journals" included J. L. Knapp's Journal of a Naturalist (1829), Charles Darwin's Journal of Researches into the Geology and Natural History of the Various Countries Visited by HMS Beagle (1839), E. P. Thomson's Note- Book of a Naturalist (1846), and W. J. Broderip's Leaves from the Note-Book of a Naturalist (1852).11 Writing that claimed to be the nearly unmodified record of direct observation carried an aura of immediacy and authenticity of which Eliot could not have been unaware. At the very least, she knew that turning journals into journalism could earn a writer "guineas," as her own articles using her journal writings about Weimar had done (Letters 2: 201). In reality, though, it appears unlikely that Eliot acted to publish "Ilfra- combe," as her extant letters and journals are silent on this point. For all practical purposes, the only readers of "Ilfracombe" as a whole during most of Eliot's lifetime were Lewes and Eliot herself. On the other hand, 11 In 1837, amateur naturalist Emily Shore had expressed a desire to publish her observations in a book entitled Extracts from a Naturalist's Journal, but she wor- ried that "the market for such works is overstocked." See the Journal of Emily Shore, ed. Barbara Timm Gates (Charlottesville: UP of Virginia, 1991) 219. There were versions of what I like to call "faux" journals on other subjects; these were pub- lished works called "journal" or "notebook" that resembled actual journals in al- most no respect. For example, Fraser's published articles entitled "Loose Leaves from the Note-Book of a Schemer" and "Leaves from the Note-Book of a Norwe- gian Fisher" in January and September 1849 respectively.</page><page sequence="14">32 RECOLLECTING NATURE readers of "Sea-side Studies" in Blackwood's encountered, unknown to them, many passages imported from the journal of Lewes's companion; as he informed his readers, "I have no descriptive power" (185). This adapta- tion of Eliot's prose-what we might call its "stealth" publication-is an instance of her "silent collaboration" on some of Lewes's work (Haight 199). In a muted, roundabout way, the "Ilfracombe Journal" takes part in the wider cultural dialogue that constituted Victorian natural history. While some nature journals, or quasi-journals, clearly were edited-or fashioned from the start-for an eager mass readership, "Ilfracombe" hov- ers more ambiguously between public and private writing. It is an exam- ple of what Donald H. Reiman calls "confidential" or "corporate" manuscripts that are written for one or a very few readers who share a common interest or "communal values" (40). A chronicle of shared expe- riences and a labor of love, "Ilfracombe" inhabits a reading space-a "lit- toral zone" or shoreline, as Eliot might say-between the public and the private. She wrote it not as an isolated, objective observer but in collabo- rative relationship with an intimate other, who transmitted her observa- tions to a larger readership. Besides preserving the memory of those shared experiences while they were fresh in Eliot's mind, "Ilfracombe" served other functions too, as did her other manuscript writings of various kinds. In journals and notebooks she collected information and quotations from her research, sketched plans for her novels (the notebook called "Quarry for Middlemarch" is an example), commented on her experiences, and tried out ideas on paper.12 Inasmuch as she often moved material from one manuscript to another as a project took shape (Wiesenfarth xxxi), her journal and notebook writing not only produced nuggets of content that she molded and combined into larger, more coherent wholes, but also served as a very means for her thinking. "Ilfracombe" performs some of this reshaping and reconstitution of ex- perience and thought. It is a laboratory for experimenting with language- for "practising writing," in Margaret Harris's phrase ("George Eliot Dia- ry"). As Jennifer Uglow observes, the journal displays "a conscious delight in the act of writing and an awareness of how [Eliot] wants to write, filling in broad backgrounds with precise particulars" (57). Evoking Ilfracombe 12 In addition to Cross; Letters; Wiesenfarth; and Pinney, Essays, other key sources on Eliot's journal and notebook writing are Pinney, "More Leaves from George Eliot's Notebook," Huntington Library Quarterly 29.4 (August 1966), 353-76; Quarry for Middlemarch, ed.

Neufeldt (Berkeley: U of California P, 1979); and the forthcoming Journals of George Eliot.</page><page sequence="15">MARY ELLEN BELLANCA 33 in a fuller way than simply recording information, Eliot both makes the place a part of herself and recreates it. She reinvents her experience, her re- sponse to that experience, her method of journalizing, and nature itself, creating a new version of it in her text. If, as Harriet Blodgett has argued, journal writing is a form of "self-fashioning" and of "self-presentation through language" (61, 62), in this journal Eliot fashions herself as a writer and observer while refashioning her perceptions of nature as well. "Ilfracombe" places great emphasis on seeing the facts; like Ruskin and scores of other nineteenth-century writers interested in nature's facticity, Eliot asserts the need for concreteness rather than vagueness and for edu- cating the eye "by objects as well as by ideas" (243).13 But even spontane- ous responses, such as Eliot's admiration of beauties never seen before, are mediated by her previous experience and by the conventions of language. Her reports of the facts almost inevitably become statements of something else as well; witness the transcendental animation of her sunlight "living like a spirit among the branches of the hanging woods" (247). When writ- ten in the "Ilfracombe Journal," her responses have a reconstructed spon- taneity, colored by memory and edited by design or accident. For the different occasions and "audiences" of her diary, journal, and letters, memory shapes alternative versions of her responses to the same events. Thus, the "Ilfracombe Journal" resists categorization. It is fictive with- out being fiction; it takes advantage of the journal genre's flexibility, flour- ishing in the safety of privacy while exploiting serviceable ideas from periodical nonfiction, popular natural history books, and imaginative re- flection. Published natural history provided Eliot models of language for expressing excitement over diverse life forms and for celebrating particu- larity-what Lynn Merrill calls Victorian culture's "apotheosis of singu- larity" (51). The venue of the private journal, meanwhile, made possible a sense of immediacy and firsthand encounter, and its open-ended form en- abled Eliot to improvise and explore the landscape of her imagination as it played over Devonshire's physical topography. 13 Many commentators attribute Eliot's remarks about seeing and the style of her landscape descriptions to her reading of Ruskin's Modern Painters. While Eliot was certainly influenced by Ruskin, whom she called "the finest writer living" (Letters 2: 255), empiricist emphasis on the acute observation of particular objects is everywhere in natural history writing and predates Ruskin's earliest publica- tions. Natural history writing had valorized local particulars since at least the eigh- teenth century, and Ruskin's work as well as that of his contemporaries was informed by this focus on the fact. For further discussion, see Merrill 107-57, espe- cially 146; and Patricia Ball, The Science of Aspects: The Changing Role of Fact in the Work of Coleridge, Ruskin and Hopkins (London: Athlone, 1971).</page><page sequence="16">34 RECOLLECTING NATURE In this text, Eliot is "poised on the threshold of fiction" in more ways than one. Not only did she record being "anxious to begin [her] fiction writing" on the same day she noted having "jotted down some recollec- tions of Ilfracombe" (Journals 20 July 1856); she also experimented with fic- tionality in the very writing of her encounters with the material world in an actual place. "Ilfracombe" is poised on other thresholds as well-or, to borrow Uglow's phrase, it is "constantly crossing margins" (58): between journal writing and journalism, empirical objectivity and emotional re- sponse, writing as work and writing as play. Sporting on these literal and figurative littoral zones and slipping in and out of genre categories, "Ilfra- combe" takes advantage of the journal's relative privacy and freedom to think in new ways about subject matter, form, style, and prospective audi- ence. That freedom also enables Eliot to take pleasure in nature for its own sake, eluding Victorian expectations that women writers will concentrate on nature's moral or utilitarian benefits to human beings. In her essay "The Natural History of German Life," written between tidepool treasure hunts at Ilfracombe, Eliot refers to a certain painting as presenting "a landscape of marvellous truthfulness" (Pinney, Essays 268). The "Ilfracombe Journal" creates just such a landscape, one with the "truthfulness" of Eliot's increasingly acute observation and the "marvel- lousness" of her retrospective refashioning. It is a vivarium of living words in which she grows the things she sees and her ways of writing them. In Eliot's hands, the journal is transformed into a productive site and a felicitous vantage point for "contemplating another sort of beauty" as she turns to a new field of natural and imaginative vision.
