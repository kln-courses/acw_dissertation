<plain_text><page sequence="1">VII.-NEW BOOKS Biology and Language (Tarner Lectures, 1949-50). By J. H. WOODGER. Cambridge University Press, 1952. Pp. xiv + 364. Price 40s. BooKs such as this one, which are designed for readers of two rather different kinds, run the risk of being ignored by both, and it is 'up to a reviewer to show cause why this should not happen. What is there, then, in Professor Woodger's 'introduction to the methodology of the biological sciences including medicine', for readers of MIND ? The principal answer is: " A good example ". It is often said that recent developments in logic and philosophical method are applicable to other than narrowly philosophical questions, but philosophers too rarely make these wider applications. This is just what Professor Woodger has always made it his task to do, and in the present book he aims to show how a number of questions on the borders of biology, psychology and philosophy can be settled by the use of suitable logical and linguistic tools. The result is an absorbing, though rather heterogeneous series of lectures. Since modern analytical philosophy or, as he calls it, ' the Boole-Frege movement' means to Professor Woodger chiefly the Ameri- can school (e.g. Quine, Tarski, Carnap, and Hempel), he spends the first part of the book (Lectures I and II) in expounding the basic terms and notions of symbolic logic, and the truth-functional analysis of general statements-which he takes as his model for theoretical statements. This is done in preparation for his second part (Lectures III to V) in which the fundamentals of genetical theory are to be set out in a completely formal and explicit way: this programme, he hopes, will enable him " to eliminate an enormous amount of unnecessary verbiage and to avoid the pitfalls to which the use of a natural language exposes us " (p. 43). Much of the second part is technical and elaborately symbolical, but non-scientific readers should not be put off: if they turn to Lecture V they can take up the argument again. Professor Woodger's aim in this part is to do for genetics very much what Hertz did for dynamics in his Principles of Mechanics, and in due course he makes the same discovery as Hertz, namely, that the focal points of philosophical confusion in genetical theory are those at -which phrases and terms with extraneous uses intrude-e.g. 'inherit', 'transmission of characters', '. . . determined by . . .'. The discussion of these confusions is excellent, though some may feel that Professor Woodger does not draw the right conclusion from his discovery. Surely the source of the trouble lies, not in a lack of definiteness in natural languages, but in the plain ambiguity of the terms cited: Woodger manages to unravel all the really serious confusions in clear English, so his symbolical apparatus might for these purposes have been dispensed with-thus avoiding the 'unnecessary verbiage' he speaks of without any corresponding increase in symbolage. However, it is important not to prejudge an issue which can only be determined in the practical field: it will be for geneticists themselves to decide in the light of experience whether the benefits of Woodger's symbolism are worth the price. One may also wonder whether Woodger does not at times protest too much. For instance, in his analysis of genetics he stresses that all his 100</page><page sequence="2">NEW fBOOKS 101 terms are defined as ' class-names ' or as functors applying to classes, and he frequently complains about the slipshod use of the term 'properties' as applied to genes: yet if genetics had always been kept as antiseptic as he asks, would this not have slowed down its progress ? It is difficult to see how, in a genetics formulated entirely in terms of' classes of organ- isms' and their 'shared names', the role of the germ-cells could have come to be understood as quickly as it in fact was (cf. p. 25). This is not just to say that a little mental confusion may act as a healthy catalyst in the process of discovery, for Woodger is clear that his critical activity is a post mortem affair and is not designed as a method of discovery. The trouble is that his campaign against reliance on metaphors in science seems at times to be directed against the use of explanatory models also; and such a policy would succeed not only in purifying scientific theory, but in sterilising it as well. In the last two lectures Professor Woodger turns to the mind-body problem, or rather, to what is more profitable, the relations between psychological and neurological language and explanations. Here his symbolic apparatus is no longer conspicuous, and the argument gains in cogency as a result. His observations in this part are not profound, but they are interesting and sensible: thus, " people are not always content when they have found a good thing. They want to believe that it is the only good thing " (of those who will accept only explanations in physical terms, pp. 278-279), " It has not been made at all clear why it should be a scientific sin to be anthropomorphic when we are dealing with Jv0pc*Tno. himself " (p. 283), '+ Words like ' psycho-somatic' are only invented to heal a breach which need never have been made" (p. 317), and so on. There is an intriguing polemic against the unhappy effects which Woodger believes Cartesian dualism has had on medical education and clinical procedures (pp. 294 ff.), and a useful discussion of Suttie's Origins of Love and Hate (pp. 301 ff.), which he holds out as a satisfactory example of a theory expressed in terms of persons. Much of this last part will be of interest to readers of MIND, particularly Professor Woodger's analysis of quotations from eminent biologists perplexed by such questions as 'where in the brain the mind intervenes'. There are also three appendices, the most valuable of which is a full analysis of Harvey's De Motu Cordis (pp. 75-92), showing clearly the logical interrelations and interdependencies between the evidence ap- pealed to and the theoretical propositions Harvey wishes to establish. Incidentally, it is worth noticing that Woodger sets out Harvey's argu- ment quite succinctly without resort to any symbolism. Two brief philosophical comments. (a) Professor Woodger is very hostile towards 'abstract entities', and follows Quine in all his attempts to smoke them out of logic and science; yet he takes as one of his starting-points a body of Russellian epistemology, in terms of ' sensible objects' called 'looks', 'feels', etc., which ought to offend him for just this reason. Perhaps he has not noticed that, when treated not as verbs but as nouns, the words 'look' and 'feel' become quite as 'abstract' as the property-words to which he takes exception ('tallness', etc.). (b) Boole and Frege both threw large rocks into the philosophical pond, and the ripples they caused can still be felt in many directions. There is certainly not any single 5 Boole-Frege movement', nor any one true Boole-Frege gospel, and things are better so. It is a pity, therefore, to write as though the symbolic logicians alone were the legitimate heirs of</page><page sequence="3">102 ONEW BOOKS Frege, and as though contemporary philosophical method could be applied only to a science that has first been shaped to fit-the truth-functicnal mould. This is especially unfortunate considering how many of Pro- fessor Woodger's most illuminating contributions to the philosophy of science, from the Biological Principles to the present book, have been presented without the use of logical hookls-and-eyes. STEPHEN TOULMIN. Translations from the PhilosophicaX Writings of Gottlob Frege. By PETER GEACH and MAx BLACK. Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1952. Pp. x + 244. 25s. Tins book contains translations of several of Frege's more inmportant articles-Function und Begriff, Ueber Begriff und Gegenstand, Ueber Sinn und Bedeutung, Was ist eine Function ? and Die Verneinung-of his essay on Schroeder's Algebra der Logik and of extracts from his review of Husserl's Philosophie der Arithmetik, from the Begriffsschrift and from the Grundgesetze. The publication of such a book is extremely welcome, as it is impossible to form a just idea of Frege's work from the Grundlagen alone, and most of these works are now extremely difficult of access. With the inclusion of none of the items can there be any quarrel; in the Husserl review, for instance, Frege gives an important argument, not clearly stated elsewhere, for regarding 0 as a genuine number. It is, however, -to be regretted that the editors have omitted' the most interesting of the late articles, Der Gedanke, and the 1903 articles on Hilbert's Grund- lagen der Geometrie. The excerpts given from the Grundgesetze consist of parts of the Preface, the Introduction, and sections 1-7 of vol. i, and in vol. ii, sections 56-67 and 86-147, and parts of the Appendix. Readers of the Grundlagen will find developed in this volume the dis- tinction between Sinn and Bedeutung, subsequent to that book, and will note Frege's unavailing attempts to extricate himself from the paradox of saying, " The concept 'horse' is not a concept ". This dilemma arises because any attempt to say what concept " is a horse " stands for must be either a ' saturated' expression, which would stand for an object and not a concept, or an 'unsaturated' one, in Which case one could not form a (saturated) sentence of the form " ' Is a horse ' stands for . . . ". There are only two ways of escape, neither of which Frege ever took: either one must say that the phrase, " the concept 'horse ' " not only does not stand for a concept, but stands for nothing at all, but that the whole expression, "The concept '( )' is realised ", stands for a second-level coneept; or one must deny that the distinction between Sinn and Bedeutung is applicable to other classes of expression than proper names-and indeed it is only for proper names that Frege makes out a good case for the necessity of the distinction. If Frege had taken the former expedient, he would have been forced to set up very much more complicated criteria for deciding whether an expression was a proper name or not, and would have been forced to attend to. a question he never discussed-" When is it that one can be sure that a given chunk of a sentence does stand for something ? ". If he had taken the second, the word " concept " would have disappeared from his vocabulary, the use of predicate-letters in quantifiers would have come into question and both the Grundlagen and the Grundgesetze definitions of individual num- bers would have become impossible.</page><page sequence="4">NEW BOOKS 103 The rigorous distinctions of level-between objects, concepts, second- level concepts, and so on-coincide with the simple theory of types, so far as functions, not classes, are cQncerned; but Frege introduced extensions of concepts-classes-as objects, and regarded all objects as standing on the same level. (It would, however, be a mistake to think that by intro- ducing classes Frege was necessarily infringing his own stipulations about level: the trouble is rather that their introduction wholesale involves a contradiction about the number of all objects in Frege's logical universe.) The doctrine that all objects are on the same level, taken with Frege's view that a definition of a fun6tional expression must provide a value for it for whatever argument it can take, leads in Function and Concept to the apparently preposterous conclusion that a sense must be given to an expression like " The Sun + 1 "; but a passage from the Grundgesetze here translated shows how ably Frege could defend even so apparently implausible a result. But, as is well known, the doctrine also led straight to the Russell paradox, and the Appendix to the Grundgesetze shows how Frege explicitly rejects the theory of types, and adopts instead a solution which involves that two concepts may have the same extension and yet there be an object-namely the extension itself-falling under one but not under the other. Frege goes on to demonstrate that the distinction between falling under a concept and falling within its extension saves his definitions of numbers from the collapse which this result might have led one to expect; it is a great pity that the editors have omitted this passage, together with all those dealing with class-membership, including his derivation of " If a is not the extension of a concept, then a falls under that concept if and only if a falls within its extension ", and of " The extension of a concept does not fall within itself ". It would perhaps have been fairer to readers if the editors had here indicated the existence of an article, which Mr. Geach himself told me about, by Sobocin'ski in Methodos for 1949, in which it is demonstrated that a contradiction can still be derived in Frege's revised system. In this volume is translated a section of the Grundgesetze criticising the formalists. These are not the same writers as the ' formalists ' attacked in the Grundlagen, who are dealt with in another section of the Grund- gesetze also published in this book. In the Grundlagen, Frege's target is the ' postulation' of new kinds of number-a procedure which a formalist proper would object to with equal force from his point of view. Here Frege is concerned with the view that the objects of mathematical study are classes of marks on paper, and the rules laid down for writing them in sequence: he suggests that such a theory is incompetent to deal either with number-statements inside mathematics (" there are at most two distinct roots of a quadratic equation ") or with infinite series. Also. of great interest is Frege's explanation of his view of assertion as (in the words of the Tractatus) the only verb of the proposition, and his rejection-on the ground that what we can do without we must do with- out-of the idea of denial as a second such verb. Another important point is Frege's insistence that the class (the extension of a concept) cannot be understood-at least as anything relevant to logic-except via the concept. The translation is in general excellent, being almost everywhere lucid, idiomatic and fluent. The renderings of the technical and quasi-technical terms which Frege used, of which the translators have had the good idea of providing a list, are on the whole the most sensible that can be hit on. I feel that a mistake has been made in deciding usually to translate " Gleichheit " by " equality "; for the latter word would naturally be</page><page sequence="5">104 NEW BOOKS taken, except in arithmetical contexts, to exclude the sense of 'identity'. The choice is obviously difficult, though, and a clear explanation has been given for what has been done. I think also that " Inhalt " (and " beur- theilbarer Inhalt ") might have been added to the glossary; but the matter is not so crucial here as in the Grundlagen, where the verb " ent- halten ", when simply translated " contain ", may cause a lot of puzzle- ment. It might seem that it-would have been better to use cognate words to translate "bedeuten " and " Bedeutun,": "stand for " is slightly preferable to "refer to ", but it has no corresponding abstract noun; this difficulty cannot always be surmounted by periphrasis. It may be that it would ultimately be for the best to employ " mean " and "meaning ": it was, after all, possible for Russell to write " the word 'Socrates' means a certain man; the word 'mortal ' means a certain quality "-and also for Wittgenstein to write " . . das Wort 'Bedeutung ' sprachwidrig gebraucht wird, wenn man damit das Ding bezeichnet, das dem Wort 'entspricht ' ". The book is attractively produced. Both the translation and printing are, however, unfortunately marred by a number of slips. I append a list, which has been checked and agreed to by Mr. Geach, of the seriously misleading ones. The use of italics, and to some extent of quotation marks, in Begriffs- schrift and in the Introduction to the Grundgesetze, does not always cor- respond to Frege's.

IN this book, Dr. von Bertalanify expounds the 'organismic conception of life', the formulation of which (with all that it implies) " may well be set beside the great revolutions in human thought " . . . " a second Copernican revolution ". " We may hope ", says Dr. von Bertalanify, " that these intellectual developments herald a new epoch which mankind is entering through the formidable crisis of our time." The principal instrument of this revolution, we are repeatedly told, forthrightly or by implication, is Dr. von Bertalanify himself. Let us now therefore enquire into the credentials of this portentous doctrine. The organismic conception of biology teaches that organisms are not mere assemblies of their constituent parts; nor are their activities mere agglomerations of discrete reflexes, metabolisms, growings and secretions. Nor again are ecological communities mere jumbles of animals and plants. Quite the contrary: " Every organism represents a system, by which we mean a complex of elements in mutual interaction ". Among the ideas that are superseded by this illuminating thought are the " classical cell theory ", according to which the organism is a mere aggregate of cells; the " classical theory of reflexes ", which represents behaviour as a sum or chain of individual reflexes; and the genetical doctrine which affirms that the organism is " an aggregate of characters going back to a corre- sponding aggregate of genes in the germ cells, transmitted and acting independently of each other ". By " sum " and " aggregate " in these contexts, von Bertalanify expressly means us to understand a mere sum or aggregate, one which takes no account of mutual dispositions and func- tional interrelations, for it is the recognition of these mutual dependencies that constitutes the intellectual triumph of organicism. The theories and attitudes of mind which the 'organismic conception' supersedes are so conspicuously foolish that one wonders who can have had the temerity to propound them;, and so we wait in ghoulish pleasure,</page><page sequence="7">106 NEW BOOKS page after page, for quotations from or references to the authors whose fatuous views they represent. But we wait in vain: expectation gives way.to doubt and then at last to the full exactions of hope confounded: there are no such views and no such people, and I submit that it was not necessary to invent them. The " analytical-and-summative mechanist " is merely a sort of lay devil invented to allow nature-philosophers the pleasures of indulging in the rites of exorcism. Let us now turn to a humbler example of the nature-philosophers' habit of inventing fictitious problems. " A, much-discussed problem of histology ", von Bertalanffy informs us, is that of " the significance of the intercellular substance ". (Intercellular substances-the definite article is uncalled for-include blood plasma, connective tissue fibres, and the matrices of cartilage and bone.) " We are presented here with two opposing views. According to the first, these substances must be regarded as dead secretions of the cells, which alone are living; according to the second, the intercellular sub- stance is formed by a transformation of living protoplasm, and the con- cept of a 'living mass' is ma.intained which includes not only the cells but also the intercellular substance." If this is indeed a " much-discussed problem ", von Bertalanffy should have had no difficulty in telling us which histologists have discussed it. None have, in my hearing. There is, however, a genuine problem about connective-tissue fibres: are they, like hairs and scurf, made of dead cells, or are they derived from external cellular secretions ? Nature-philo- sophers discuss problems of the first sort, histologists discuss problems of the second sort. Dr. von Bertalanffy may be inclined to say that, in writing so confidently of hairs being composed of dead cells, I have en- tangled myself in just the profundities that so exercise him. Not a bit of it! The word 'dead' is here used in the good old-fashioned way, that is, to mean 'formerly living '. For laymen seldom speak of stones as being dead, and never of crystals as being in any sense alive; but they can tell a living horse from a dead one, and, what is more, can remember an apt metaphor which turns upon the distinction. Dr. von Bertalanffy is at great pains to show us what a clever fellow he is; there are many pages of quotations from his own earlier writings, so juxtaposed to citations of the more recent works of others as to con- vince us of his prescience. But let us be charitable and regard this as part of the literary idiom of nature-philosophy. Of course, the organ- ismic conception is not new, and page 182 contains a formidable list of the names of those who have groped towards it, but von Bertalanffy " believes that he may claim, in his organismic conception developed since 1926, to have first consistently formulated the new attitude as a working hypothesis for biology ". The informed reader will find this judgement a little hard upon, for example, Lloyd Morgan and J. S. Haldane (only once confused with J. B. S. Haldane); he will hope that it is an oversight that no dates are attached to citations of their work, though dates are elsewhere the rule; and regret that, perhaps because there are upwards of 50 references to von Bertalanffy's writings in the literature list, no room could be found for references to their own. It is a great pity that the style of von Bertalanffy's book is such as to do him a perhaps irreparable disservice among discriminating readers, for he has some sensible things to say in paragraphs which the reader, exasperated, may easilv overlook. Of machines, in the sense of reactively hide-hound</page><page sequence="8">NEW BOOKS 107 systems with a built-in structural order, von Bertalanffy sensibly says that " Organisms are not machines, but they can to a certain extent become machines, congeal into machines ". He emphasizes too, that entropy is not inconsistent with a "transition towards higher order. For example, crystallization which creates a level of organization higher than that of the molecules, of course follows the law of entropy." This is all good stuff, and, with rather more reserve, the same can be said of his views on the 'historical' character of organisms. What of the more technical pArts of the book ? Can the philosopher read this book, if not for its philosophical opinions, at least for an up-to- date and rigorous appraisal of the state of advancement of modern biology ? I fear not. The section on embryology is, in my opinion, out of date, for it gives no hint of the misgivings that have troubled the more recent students of organizer theory and takes no account of the powerful testimony of modern microbiology. The chapters on evolution and natural selection are written in a curiously arch tone, and it is not easy to discern what the writer's views really are. It begins with the woeful misconception that " an enormous overproduction of descendants takes place with all organisms " (a misconception only to be arrived at, as R. A. Fisher tells us, " by abolishing a real death rate, while retaining a real rate of reproduction "); it goes on to assure us that selection has been " mathematically proved ", a statement to which I can attach no mean- ing; and somewhat later assures us that " we find no evidence either in the living world of today or of past geological epochs for a continuous transition " between species, a statement that is quite simply erroneous. von Bertalanffy is much concerned with " a fundamental question- though it is usually evaded in the text-books-what the 'gene' or 'hereditary unit' really signifies ". Later he tells us in a quotation from his earlier writings that " Genes are the expression of small dif- ferences in otherwise corresponding genomes ". If this is an answer, it is insufficient and ill-expressed; I recommend von Bertalanffy to consult and master the lucid analyses of Hogben and of Mather. A more concrete and therefore less excusable example of lack of rigour is to be found in the paragraphs in which von Bertalanffy treats of viruses. Viruses, we learn, " display a property that seems most charac- teristic of the living: they multiply by division. If, for example, a plant is inoculated with a few hundreds of molecules of crystallized tobacco- mosaic virus . . . an enormous increase of the virus substance " takes place. The second sentence is true; the first, which it purports to exemplify, does not follow from it. I find such an error quite unpardonable. Dr. von Bertalanffy's omissions are surprising: he has, for example, nothing to say of endocrinology. It is characteristic of endocrinology that it has stood aside from the minor secular shifts of emphasis between analytic and integrative research that are to be found, for example, in the history of the study of animal behaviour. On the contrary, in endocrinology the chemical analysis of hormones and the 'organismic ' interpretation of their complex interplay and mutual control have pro- ceeded happily side-by-side, each promoting the interests of the other. The history of endocrinology (and also, less clearly, of immunology, on which he is likewise silent) makes nonsense of von Bertalanffy's quasi- Copernican revolution, and of the slight, implicit in the writings of nature- philosophers, that the laboratory worker (" busy with special questions and experiments ") is too preoccupied to have at heart the welfare of the organism as a whole, or of what he calls in a, to my mind, more than</page><page sequence="9">108 NEW BOOKS usually odious turn of phrase, the " essential 'vital' features " of living organisms. Perhaps therefore von Bertalanffy was wise to leave out all reference to them. In a sense von Bertalanffy's book is a prolegomenon to what he calls a General System Theory-" a new realm of science " that will have a " momentous share in future developments ". A system can be defined " as a complex of elements standing in interaction ", and the subject matter of General System Theory is " a formulation and derivation of those principles which hold for systems in general ". It is to be a mathe- matical theory, appropriately enough, for " mathematics means nothing else than the highest attainable form of rationalization of reality ". Unfortunately, there is nothing in the present work about General Sys- tem Theory except immoderate claims for its efficacy: we are reminded of that convention of the cinema by which attractions yet to come are heralded by a prospectus that turns the stomach of discriminating film- goers. But let there be no mistake about it: if von Bertalanify does indeed formulate a General System Theory, it may well be a work of real importance; let us only beg that, when it arrives, its merits will be allowed to speak for themselves and not be condemned by their author's intemperate advocacy. For von Bertalanffy is a genuine, if never a humble seeker after truth; he has devoted his professional life to the investigation of problems of which, if some are spurious and others the outcome of confused thinking, others still are of the most serious import; if he will be content to produce a well-finished, rigorous and exhaustive analysis of some one problem whose solution lays claim to something less than a universal ambit of significance, he will earn the gratitude and respect of biologists instead of an exasperation that can only lead to neglect and contempt. P. B. MEDAWAR. Bertrand Russell's Construction of the External World. By CHARLES A. FRITZ, Jnr. London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1952. Pp. 243. ?1 3s. THIS book contains, after some introductory matter, first an account of Russell's definitions of number and class, and his analysis of descriptions, as paradigm cases of the employment of the idea of logical constructions, next a more detailed critical examination of Russell's use of logical con- structions in his account of the external world and the entities of physics, and finally a consideration of Russell's methodology, with special refer- ence to the theory of logical constructions. With reservations to, follow, I think Mr. Fritz gives an accurate and well-balanced account of Russell's main logical, epistemological and metaphysical theories. His criticisms of these theories are clear, sensible, and on points of importance; Mr. Fritz is in reasonably close sympathy with Russell, and never challenges his basic conceptions about the nature of philosophy, but he sternly criticises the consistency and validity of Russell's argumentation. Surprisingly enough, the weakness of Mr. Fritz as an expositor is mainly in regard to the theory of logical constructions itself, which he wishes especially to emphasize. On this topic his terminology is even slacker than Russell's. Thus Chapter ii is entitled 'The Construction of Numbers, Descriptions and Classes'; on page 154 we read: " It is at</page><page sequence="10">NEW BOOKS 109 this point that the analysis of 'material object' as a logical construction, as an incomplete symbol, becomes significant "; and on page 215 we are told that " numbers, descriptions, and material objects, for example, are 'incomplete symbols '." Mr. Fritz does not seem to realize that only expressions, such as 'material object', or descriptions, can be said to be incomplete symbols; material objects and the King of France are logical constructions, and are not symbols at all, complete or incomplete. It is perhaps this terminological slackness which makes him fail to see such points as that it is a very different thing to say that 'The sense-datum I now have' is an incomplete symbol (because it does not name the nameable) and to say that -'material object' is an incomplete symbol (because it does not denote anything which could be named). Philosophically, Mr. Fritz writes in a thoroughly intelligible manner; but he is much better at logical, than at English, syntax. At the bottom of the second page of the first chapter we read: " The general -philosophic view which Russell had at this time was a rather extreme realism, believ- ing in the reality of many kinds of entities, especially physical objects, minds and universals." This is at least the fourth unconstruable sen- tence in the chapter. This is a point on which he might have modelled himself on the subject of his examination. This is not a final account of Russell's philosophical achievement; but in spite of its glaring inaccuracies, and partly because these inaccuracies, when they occur, are so glaring, there is sufficient sound exegesis and sane criticism to make it worth reading by the many students of Russell's philosophy. J. 0. URMSON. The Origin and Goal of History. By KARL JASPERS. Translated by MICHAEL BULLOCK. Routledge and Kegan Paul. 21s. PROFESSOR JASPERS holds as an article of faith that "mankind has one single origin and one goal ". He confesses to total ignorance of both, and seems not to believe that his creed is literally true. However, it forms the ostensible topic of his lengthy and arduous book, most of which consists in a survey of the history of the world. This survey can be briefly summarized. Of prehistory we know, it is said, almost nothing at all. The first uses of fire and of tools were aflairs of importance, but the pioneers in this field have left no memorial. The most ancient civilizations of which we have knowledge are also, though not entirely opaque to historians, yet " destitute of any specifically historical movement ". The first excitements of history are to be found in the " Axial Period ", from 800 to 200 B.C. In these centuries there occurred events more striking and important than any before or since. Then the West, the chief legatee of Axial energy, began in the sixteenth century to take significant steps on its own account. But Jaspers goes on to warn us that Science, the prestige of which is now high, is yet not able to answer all our questions; and that Technology, which has indeed revolutionized Life, may be a force for ill as well as for good. With the growth of facilities for transport, the World has become as it were a smaller place; and this is in some ways saddening, though in other ways good. The Future he finds impossible wholly to foresee. Bureaucracy is likely to increase and may degenerate: Planning is much in vogue but has limitations: a World Empire may possibly come into being by</page><page sequence="11">110 NEW BOOKS conquest, or perhaps a World Unity by agreement among nations. What is needed to arm us against these or other contingencies is faith in God, in Man, and in " possibilities in the world ". The aim which in some way makes of History a Unity is to achieve in all men " the manifestation of Being ". In the present, however, the most important problems are still those that require us to decide what actually to do. One is likely to experience a sense of tedium in considering this summary of Jasper's volume. It is indeed, like the content of his argument, platitudinous. The views on universal history which he presents are not, so far as they are intelligible, in general surprising; nor are they liable to criticism in detail, for they contain no detail. His statements are about Science and Man, Civilization and Society; for the most part their truth or falsehood is a matter of choice, with no great incentive to choose. Why then is the book so large, and its potential public, perhaps, no less large and solemn ? The answer to this enigma no doubt lies in the language. The trans- lation, which must have been very difficult to make, is also difficult to read, being needlessly barbarous and verbally ugly. But it can be read, not without a certain suspension of judgment, in such a way that it begins to act in the manner of a drug. The contorted verbosity of Jasper's sentences may convey the vague excitement of confused shouting, or enfold the reader as if in a cloud of mildly intoxicating vapour. In certain stages of intoxication quite unremarkable reflections may seem for a moment to offer the key to the Universe; life seems to be seen, not steadily, but vividly, in depth. This book will be of no use at all to readers not liable to verbal inebriation; there are also more pleasing ways than this of achieving that condition. But those (and no doubt they are many) who can drink these draughts with pleasure will probably feel, for some moments at least, that at last the canvas of Man's history has been surveyed by a powerful and a penetrating eye. When they read that " the multiple is subject to the imperative of the One ", and that " this is the exclusivity of the demand of an historicity to be the only one and to dominate all others, but it must develop for consciousness in the communication of the multiple historical in the absolute historicity of the One ", it is not impossible that they may feel that some secret is about to be, or even that it has been, laid bare. G. J. WARNOCK. Science, Language and Human Bights. Philadelphia; University of Pennsylvania Press, 1952. Pp. 207. - $2.50. THis volume consists of the papers read at the annual meeting of the Eastern Division of the American Philosophical Association in December 1952. There are five symposia, each consisting of two- papers. The general level of both competence and seriousness is markedly high, and it is to be hoped that philosophers on this side of the Atlantic will give this book the attention it deserves. The first discussion is between Roderick Firth and Max Black, who contrive to make interesting and original contributions to the well-worn topic of Phenomenalism. Firth sets himself the task of estimating the comparative merits of the, sense datum language and what he calls the " language of ap^pearing ", which is the notation advocated by those philosophers who prefer colloquial expressions like " looks ", " seems'</page><page sequence="12">NEW BOOKS ill "feels", "appears ", to technical talk about sense data. Firth con- cludes, after an elaborate and careful discussion which cannot be sum- marized here, that for " epistemological purposes " the language of appearing is inadequate since it does not permit us to describe hallucina- tions. He points out that although it would be perfectly possible to assign a phenomenological meaning to phrases like " It appears to me that . . . ", this would amount to saying that there is some " sensous aspect or component " common to both illusory and veridical sense experiences, and this of course is nothing other than our old friend the sense datum once again. Firth does not defend the sense datum ter- minology except in this negative way, while Black does not defend the language of appearing but criticizes the sense datum language, hence their discussion is not altogether satisfactory considered as a piece of philosophical dialectic. Black adopts the Wittgensteinian method of exposing the limitations of the sense datum language by considering the question of how such a language might be taught. He concludes, I think correctly, that if sense datum propositions are incorrigible, then no logical relations can properly be said to obtain between them, for nothing that one person says in this language can count either in favour of or against anything that another person says in the same notation. This shows, says Black, that the sense datum language is futile as a means of communication and hence not a language at all in any legitimate sense of the word. Black could have reinforced this conclusion by making two further observations. (i) The expressions used by phenomenalists to refer to " immediate experience " have got what meaning they have only by courtesy, so to speak, of the allegedly logically independent " material object language ". That is, we can attach significance to the phrase ' red patch " in statements like " I now have a sense datum of a red patch " only because we know how to use the phrase in describing things like bloodstains and the faces of clowns. (ii) The mythological character of a language which describes only " the given " is also clear from the fact (which I think is ultimately a logical fact, if one may use such an expression) that to be in a position to say something is also to be in a position to be able to make a mistake. This was often pointed out by nineteenth-century idealists, though in an idiom now most unfashionable. The question " What is a Rule of Language ? " is debated between N. L. Wilson and R. M. Martin. Their discussion is based on, and in my view vitiated by, the very odd assumption that whatever is true of an artificial language will also be true of a natural language like Spanish. Wilson says " It is sheerly a matter of accident that some languages are used by people, others are defined in such books as Carnap's Semantics and still others, the vast majority, enjoy neither of these benefits ". Waiving the problem of exactly what sort of existence these mysterious unspoken and unformulated languages could have, it is plain that Wilson is here forgetting that when we refer to a calculus as a " language " we are speaking in a highly metaphorical way. It is therefore very much an open question to what extent the construction of artificial systems or " logically perfect languages " can throw light on philosophical diffi- culties, which arise in the notoriously " imperfect " natural languages. The other contributors to this volume are as follows: E. Nagel and C. G. Hempel, Problems of Concept and Theory Formation in the Social Sciences; V. A. Tomas and D. N. Morgan, The Concept of Expression in Art; A. I. Melden and W. K. Frankena, The Concept of Universal Human Rights.</page><page sequence="13">112 NEW BOOKS These topics have on occasion induced a kind of hypnosis in those who investigate them, and a peculiarly unrewarding type of sententious woolliness has been the result. These philosophers, however, are not in the least mesmerised, and on the whole deal with their problems with both care and insight. The last mentioned discussion, in particular, is a stimulating and original contribution to a problem to which philosophers have recently paid insufficient attention. In short, this is a book which may be commended without hesitation. C. K. GRANT. Christianity in an Age of Science. By C. A. CouIrsON. Languages, Standpoints, and Attitudes. By H. A. HODGES.

PROFESSOR COULSON rejects any " Parcelling out of the country of the mind into departments under independent authority" (p. 10) treating " religion and science as if they were two adjoining allotments, each to be separately cultivated ". Instead he would like to say that scientists and theologians are pursuing different "lines of inquiry into the nature of reality " (p. 35) and are all " describing the same situation . . . though each uses his own appropriate language " (p. 45). " We can give full weight to the Genesis story of creation and at the same time admit with- out any embarrassment whatever the biological account of evolution" (p. 22). So we can-though this is not explained-by interpreting the story of, say, the Fall as a myth; which expresses facts of one category, the perennially sinful propensities of mankind, in the idiom appropriate to those of another, history. This spares us the doctrine of original sin " as the result of a sin committed in actual historical fact, by an individual man named Adam . . . native to all of us only because it has been handed down by descent from him " (Pope Pius XII in the encyclical Humawni Generis, 1950). Again in a great decision " the one unchallengeable fact for the President is his own free will, and the grim necessity to make up his mind " (p. 23), whereas afterwards to a historian the upshot is " quite inevitable "; a matter of the difference between actor-language and spectator-language (Kant's contrast between freedom in the noumenal world and determinism in the phenomenal might similarly be reinterpreted as one between the 'languages' of morals and of neutral observation). While to speak of different languages in our ' One World' is an advance on the older fashion of demarcating bailiwicks and multiplying peculiar worlds: saying things about the same subject is sometimes confused with saying the same thing. We are told that the scientists reporting " Racial discrimination has no basis in biological fact " were saying "in their language " that " there is neither Jew nor Greek, bond nor free, but all are one in Christ " (p. 45). But for St. Paul the reference to Christ is not a literary trapping, irrelevant to the sense. By contrast Professor Hodges, in a rather abstract study of fundamental issues nowadays too often eschewed by professionals, insists " It is just not true that, given sufficient ingenuity, all standpoints can be brought into harmony" (p. 44). A standpoint is a "set of principles or pre- suppositions together with the type of question to which they give rise " (p. 15) and it " tends to find expression in a characteristic language "</page><page sequence="14">NEW BOOKS 113 (p. 16). He is concerned to stress that " the philosophical theory of language " cannot grade or dismiss any of these any more than " the theory of knowledge can dismiss a particular field as illusory" (p. 22). Perhaps this is strictly true: but such work as Martin's ' A Religious Way of Knowing' (MIND, 1952) might suggest to some that sometimes either the analogy with other cases of knowing is very weak or what was known was not after all God the Creator. As a criterion between stand- points: "If there is a standpoint which is able to malke use of, and stimulate purposeful enquiries within, a world of discourse which a rival standpoint can only dismiss as 'meaningless or at least as mere subjective fantasy, this difference must be recognized as a decisive point in favour of the former standpoint " (p. 64). This is surely arbitrarily to stack the cards against denial that religious experience or revelation really discloses the Management of the Universe. ANTONY FLEW. The Hierarchy of Heaven and Earth. By D. E. HARDING. Faber &amp; Faber. 21s. THIS book is an attack on certain prevalent dramatisations of the universe. Putting it crudely, it resists the view that, since the universe is no longer For us, it must be Against us. It examines the situation of man, and stresses the points in which he is continuous with, rather than opposed to, the rest of physical matter. This might place it with a welter of neo-this- and-that apologias, made futile by their failure to grasp the modern thought which they try to attack. From these Mr. Harding must be clearly distinguished. First, he is not in the least apologetic, not at all concerned with straining cold bath-water for babies who grew up long ago. Second, he is free of conventional jargon. (He has some private jargon of his own, not fully justified, but not very damaging.) He is well up both in modem philosophy (particularly, and crucially, the theory of types) and in relativity theory, but avoids the technical language of either. His firm refusal to have his subject classified under any existing head justifies, needs, and usually gets clear forceful Ordinary Language. This has three results which will probably be valued even by philosophers who mistrust his more positive views. First, many shrewd attacks on the dramatisation I have mentioned, which is certainly very influential and not fully recognised- belief in Man as the heroic and persecuted antagonist of the Second Law of Thermodynamics, hurling defiance at a sadistic universe, without which, one may remark, he would certainly be a great deal worse off than he is now. Second, an educative non-Cartesian restatement ab ovo of the human situation. What am I ? A human being like others. But I haven't got a head, which is a difference. What makes me think I have ? -Where is it ? etc. The antithesis of matter and spirit is neatly dissolved (" My mind is the view out from this centre, my body the view in ") and puzzles such as " where are my thoughts ? " are tidied up effectively. It is all very ingenious, and would certainly make a change for the intelligent pupil. Third, an account, equally simple and penetrating, of Time and Space puzzles, with some good attacks on the Fear of Eternity. Beyond these points, Mr.- Harding gets more controversial. He illus- trates the suitability of m"an to Nature, and the general harmony of the cosmos, with a dashing structure of paradoxes and analogies. (The universe, it turns out, is on our side after all, but in a new way.) Some of 8</page><page sequence="15">114 NEW BOOKS his arguments are old. Yet I find them much improved by being restated, without idealist pomposity or Platonic puritanism, i, this incisive, forceful, personal style, which is often extremely beautiful. The intention of the book is religious, but it never relies on authority. Its poetry is certainly neither foolish, dishonest nor tendencious. It might be mad, but I think in an extremely useful way.

Tmis book. is particularly difficult to review because, though not without merits, it leaves the reader with a vague impression hardly capable of summarization and is lacking in salient points of a type that could be stated briefly. The author has, I think, much learning and some philo- sophical ability and has pondered nfuch on the subject. His method of approach is in a way original, especially in his working out of the antith- esis between reason in man and man as a human personality, which he expresses rather quaintly by heading one main part of his book Cartesius and the other Rene Descartes. But I must say that I doubt whether the work has made any important contribution to the subject for experts and whether, if used as a text-book for students, it would not confuse more than illuminate. Certainly I am unable to recommend it as conveying anything that is worth the very high price charged (3 guineas). In style the book is far too prolix. It seems to me that what has been said could have been better expressed at much less than half the length and so presumably at less than half the price (an important consideration nowadays). There is a great deal of rambling discussion from which it is hard to derive a clear definite impression, and in places the style becomes very obscure, especially when the author plunges into metaphysics of a kind that does, even in my opinion, deserve the strictures of the positi- vists. Incidentally, if anything could convert me to logical positivism, it would be a really prolonged course in the sort of metaphysics which the author connects with the ontological proof. It is only fair to add, how- ever, that the metaphysical passages to which I am referring only make up a small part of the book. The title, Descartes and the Modern Mind, is very misleading. It leads one to expect a comprehensive account of the relation of Descartes to the modern outlook in general, and such a work is needed and might have been very valuable. But the author seems to have far too little ac- quaintance with modern developments of thought to write such an account, being apparently not familiar even with the recent logical criticisms of the ontological proof, and he does little to bring out the importance of Descartes as the father of what is commonly known as the scientific outlook. The general remarks he makes about science, though no doubt substantially true, seem to have very little connection with Descartes, referring as they do mainly to that aspect of modern science in which it differs most from his spirit, I mean its tentative and prob- lematic character, and doing little to bring out his real influence on the development of the mechanistic outlook and on the actual methods of science.

Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1952. Pp. x+ 270. 25s. PROFESSOR GJTHRIRE has prepared the present work for publication, and has contributed a most useful Appendix, which provides the summing up Cornford did not live to complete and helps to some extent to draw together the two parts into which the book is divided. In the first part, which has the general title " Empiricism.versus Inspiration ", Cornford begins by emphasising the general neglect of a genuinely scientific method of observa- tion and experiment in the early Greek philosophers, a neglect which is reflected in Epicurean atomism, the final outcome of Ionian physics-for example Epicurus advances his central thesis about atoms and void not as a tentative hypothesis, which at best must remain dubious in the absence of experimental confirmation, but as something known to be true by an act of " mental apprehension ", by a " projection of the mind ". It is in the medical writers of the Hippocratic corpus that an empirical theory of knowledge is to be found. Epicurus, like " all the other philosophers ", was dominiated by a totally different theory, " a belief in the power of the mind to project itself outside the body and apprehend wisdom which can never be revealed through sense ". This too, as Cornford seeks to show by reference to the Meno, Phaedo, Symposium, Republic, and Phaedrus, was a characteristically Platonic view, a view in- herited by the philosophers from the much older tradition of the shamans, who united in one person the characters of prophet, poet, and sage. Thus the philosopher is the successor of the seer-poet. Throughout this section of the book there is much to interest the student of Greek philosophy, and, particularly in Chapters IV and V, the student of Plato; there are some things too which may not carry conviction. For example, in the search for the origins of Greek philosophy a dichotomy seems to develop such that we are faced with the choice, either men of science or poet-seers. But it might perhaps be argued that philosophy originates where neither of these categories holds, and in this connexion Cornford's treatment of Socrates, " the ironic dialectician ", who does not seem to fit into either category, merits particular attention. The second part of the book is perhaps of primary interest to the specialist in anthropology and primitive religion. Here, after reconstructing Anaaximander's system as typical of Ionian cosmogonies, Cornford relates it to Hesiod's cosmogony, pointing out that Anaximander's system is not, as it might appear, a rational construction based on direct observation of the existing world, but that he is working on a scheme already provided by Hesiod. He then examines the mythical account of the origin of the world which follows and duplicates the semi-philosophical account in Hesiod's Theogony, and seeks to show the oriental and ultimately ritual origin of certain of the myths in the Theogony. The book is finely produced, and forms a fitting reminder of the width and depth of Cornford's scholarship. R. C. CRoss.</page><page sequence="17">116 NEW BOOKS The Philosophy of Aristotle. By D. J. ALLAN. Home University Library. London: Geoffrey Cumberlege, Oxford U.P., 1952. Pp. 220. MR. ALLAN has here tried to give in about 57,000 words an introductory account of Aristotle's philosophy and a criticism of its value. He is not very successful, because his criticism is apologetic or moralistic, and because he cannot command the style of general exposition. Those who desire to get a general idea of Aristotle's thought without studying his works will do better to read either the shorter account in W. K. C. Guthrie's Greek Philosophers from Thales to Aristotle, or the longer account in Sir David Ross's Aristotle. Mr. Allan never begins with one of Aristotle's principles and goes on from there. Nearly all of his fifteen chapters start instead either with some modern criticism of Aristotle, or with Plato's views on the subject, or with literary information about the meaning of a Greek word or the nature of one of Aristotle's surviving works. The first two chapters are wholly devoted to literary and historical topics, namely the form of Aristotle's writings and the growth of his philosophy. Mi. Allan thinks that by beginning thus he is making 'the path smoother for those who approach this study without a classical training'; but this is not so if he means the path to a general elementary knowledge of Aristotle's mature philosophy. I illustrate the disappointing and bewildering nature of his exposition from the chapter called ' Formal Logic'. Here we start with the question of the place of.logic among the sciences, which Aristotle himself never discussed. After a page and a half of that we come to what we want, an exposition of Aristotle's logical doctrines. But after only a page and a half of that, and in the middle of a paragraph, we switch to literary topics, namely the contents and dates of the various logical works. When that is finished, Mr. Allan reports and controverts a view of Stebbing's about Aristotle's logic, although he has not yet told us enough about Aristotle's logic for us to have any idea of the relevance or truth of Stebbing's view. He criticizes Aristotle's account of propositions before he tells us what it is. Then he seems to be going to tell us what it is: 'We must not, however, ignore Aristotle's account of propositions, such as it is'. But before we can have it we have to read a paragraph on Plato's account of propositions, a paragraph which does not help the subsequent exposition of Aristotle. Throughout the book the reader has the uneasy feeling that Mr. Allan does not know where he is going next. The order of topics is never obvious. In other ways also the expositioni is oftein bewildering. On pages 152- 153 he seems to leave the impression that he is a Josephian believer in essence, but on page 112 he had flatly rejected essence. On page 183 a short paragraph starts by implying that Aristotle did not wish the young to be educated by the state, and ends by implying that he did. On page 193 we read: 'A number of questions arise from this account of political society. Firstly . . . Secondly . . . Thirdly . . . Finally .'. But none of the four matters thus introduced is a question. The doctrines of Aristotle and his critics are frequently judged, and the judgment has frequently a moralistic tone : an error is a 'fault', or a ' serious fault ', or a ' grave fault'. But really there is little need to condemn Aristotle for 'faults', or to 'defend' him against 'unfair blame'. The reader will form his ow1n opinion on all that. What he</page><page sequence="18">NEW BOOKS 117 wants from the writer is to know what Aristotle said; and if Mr. Allan had omitted the judgments he would not have had, to say that he 'must pass over' this or that interesting doctrine or argument of Aristotle's (e.g. 117). Mr. Allan's literary character is rather like A. E. Taylor's, apologetic, partisan, moralizing, earnest, bewildering, learned, detailed, imposing. His strength is not in generalization, but in the destruction of generaliza- tions by new and unexpected details. He sees things as more compli- cated, and less capable of summary statement, than most people think. He is aware of many historical connexions. His book can be recom- mended more to those who have studied Aristotle than to those who have not. They will find in it many interesting insights and suggestions, although nearly all of them, owing to the abortive intention to make this an introductory book for beginners, are too briefly put. RICHARD ROBINSON. Mimes8is: Plato's doctrine of artistic imitation and its meaning for us. By W. J. VERDENIUS. Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1949. Pp. 50. 2.30 guilders. IN this monograph Professor Verdenius expounds Plato's view of artistic imitation, and defends the theses that a general aesthetic theory may be of assistance in the appreciation of works of art, and that if interpretation is a feature of art, there is a place for Plato's concept of mimesis beside the notions of expression and creation. The author starts from those passages in which Plato says that the poet is inspired or possessed, and can give no rational account of his work. This might be expected to lead to the conclusion that he is infallible in so far as he is truly possessed, but Plato proceeds to consider him also as an imitator and to compare him unfavourably with the craftsman. The fact is, then, that the Muse leaves it to the inspired man to interpret his vision, in doing which he must make use of imitation. From the very nature of imitation his work cannot be adequate to an external object, as Plato showed in the Cratylus cf. Collingwood in MIND, vol. xxxiv (1925); but there is a sense in which it may be superior; for imitation can represent things higher than those which are met with in daily life (Rep. 401c and 472d). It is interesting to find the view that the poet is a mere imitator linked up with, and subordinated to, the view that he is inspired. I am not convinced that these views occur side by side in the same dialogues; and feel some doubt, which this essay has not dispelled, about the consistency of Plato's use of the term mimesis. In Rep. Book X he continues to address his remarks to a supposed imitative class of poets, while pointing out defects which must belong to poetry as such. Those who have held that mimesis comes in only when Plato is considering the subject from the educational point of view (and that his concept, if it has permanent value, can have it only per accidens) seem to be on safer ground. There are full bibliographical references which compensate for the brief discussion of various disputed points. D. J.

IN this treatise written in 1462 Nicolas of Cusa tries to demolish the Aristotelian doctrine of definition, and proclaims a revolutionary and, in his view, healing formula for definitions which " make us know things ". The Aristotelian formula 'A is B' is equivalent to 'something is some- thing else' and, therefore, wrong: had Aristotle realized this, he would have saved himself and us much trouble. Platonic and quasi-Platonic formulae like ' A is A ', ' A is itself ', ' A is one ' are, in this -order, some- how nearer and nearer to the truth, but still uninformative. Nicolas's alternative is ' A is nothing else (non aliud) but A ': it is informative because it excludes from A everything else. Even more, the phrase 'non aliud ' expresses the essential self-identity of the definiendum. Above all, 'non aliud ' is, in definitions, a reminder that things receive their being, reality, self-identity, from the Non-Aliud: God, the unnameable, who can only be described by means of 'non- . . .' labels, can be best called 'Non-Aliud'. His more indelible mark on things is their non- otherness; by this term they are known, because by Non-Otherness they are made: "principium cognoscendi idem est ac principium essendi." This doctrine is of interest for the historian of Platonism: the con- vergence of negative theology, mystical annihilation, relentless criticism of logical formulae appears to have stultified all attempts at a positive knowledge not only of God but of our more modest things; it is the culmination of a long process ending in a total denial. Others will find in Nicolas some support against the ' A '-A correspondence theory, especially if applied to predicates. Monopolists of philosophical panaceas distilled into one word or phrase could do worse than consider how the desolate non-aliud was made into the best possible directio speculantis. The text as now printed is superior to that of the only previous edition: Wilpert realized that the one existing manuscript was copied from a volume where a leaf had been misplaced; and a few other mistakes have been corrected. Apparatus of sources and readings, index, and two prefaces written in Pidgin Latin add unequally to the value of this beautifully printed fascicule. Omissions and mistakes found after 1944 are put right on a separate leaf. L. MINIO-PALUELLO. St. Thomas and the Existence of God: Three Interpretations. By WrILLIAM BRYAR. Henry Regnery Company, Chicago, 1951. $5.00. MIND'S review of E. Gilson's L'gtre et l'essence spoke of the need for a prodigy who could " combine M. Gilson's magnificent grasp of philo- sophical tradition with a command of the technical resources of modern logic ", and at first sight it would appear that Mr. Bryar is attempting to supply this need, at least in a restricted field. References to the work not only of Gilson, but also to that of Marechal, Adler, Chenu and Mari- tain mingle with the names of logicians such as Bochenski, Salamucha and Carnap. The aims of the book are at the outset encouragin-gly</page><page sequence="20">NEW BOOKS 1 19 modest, in that it purports to be a non-polemical inspection of the language used by St. Thomas Aquinas in the prima via of I, q. 2 a. 3 of the Summa Theologica: this text is that of the proof of the existence of God from motion. Elucidation is not immediately sought from parallel passages on the same subject; rather the author claims to lay bare what Gilson has called the "prescientific option " which lies -at the root of St. Thomas' metaphysics. "A tentative reconstruction of the process through which St. Thomas would have passed to arrive at the place where the proof begins " (p. xviii) is the aim, yet it is admitted that in the last resort, " the description will only be of value in the measure in which its means can be indirectly justified by a sufficient number and accurate study of texts of the Summa " (ibid.). Three possible -levels of interpretation are then developed at great length in a " Systematic Interpretative Study ", the first " Division " of which deals with the " existentiality " of things, the second with what is called the " partiality " of things, and the third with the " contentuality " of things. In view of the criteria of evaluation mentioned, it is scarcely surprising that the outcome consists, in effect, of sophisticated yet orthodox thomist analyses of the notions " ens ", " res " and " aliquid ". That this manner of working really "avoids that mode of interpretation which proceeds by way of a greater generality and would work back from a complete 'reflective' understanding of St. Thomas as a whole and some subsuming general rules to explicate a particular case " (p. 133) is therefore hard to understand: clearly, any discrepancy with the texts would have led to revisions in the course of the composition of the analyses. How- ever, the proof is scrutinised in the light of these three lines of interpreta- tion which are assumed to be " naturally prior in the logical structure of the growth of knowledge for St. Thomas " (p. 132). Penetrating and complete though much of this study may be, the turgid style and unwieldy arrangement make it very painful reading: pages of cryptic paragraphs a la Wittgenstein, a profusion of repetitive prefaces, preambles, cross-classifications and unincisive jargon, the con- tinued recurrence of the future tense in the body of the work, coupled with the retrospective character of the weighty appendices, all combine to blind the reader to the precise geography of the subject under dis- cussion. The appendices should be read first, as the salient points are there explained in terms of the much more intelligible writings of Gilson and others. D. P. HENRY. Freedom: A New Analysis.

He maintains that 'freedom' means 'the absence of constraints', and hence, that there are as many kinds of freedom as there are varieties of constraint. This account, Mr. Cranston claims, is a lexicographical definition, as were the accounts of some other writers on freedom, e.g. that of Hobbes; it differs from these alternative lexicographical definitions in being the true one. Mr. Cranston goes on to show that still other writers have provided stipulative or persuasive definitions of 'freedom'. With considerable</page><page sequence="21">120 NEW BOOKS skill he uses these accounts to illustrate his own thesis that the issue of 'freedom versus tyranny' is a constantly changing issue, different con- straints being felt as particularly irksome at different stages of social development. Part II, a study of liberalism, illustrates the same thesis in a different way. Part III, which aims at being a new treatment of the free will problem, contains some interesting philosophical discussions; and it is therefore a matter for regret that space is devoted to a preliminary and quite super- fluous review of the classical writings on the subject. When the great have been once more entombed Mr. Cranston has to show that recent writers have been wrong in supposing that the problem should be buried with them, the ground of his objection to its interment being that the real issue, namely, the predictability of human actions, remains un- decided. With a view to settling this question he divides predictions into ' predictions about you', ' predictions about yourself', and ' pre- dictions about other people'. Predictions of the first two varieties are seen to be impossible since they require to be infinitely extended to take account of their own repercussions on those whose behaviour they seek to predict. Predictions about other people also fall short of the deter- minist's mark, for it is impossible, in principle, to predict inventions or creations. The argument of Part III seems to require supplementation at a number of points even if it is valid. First, more should have been said to show that the issue at stake is predictability; secondly, a closer analysis is required of the nature of the dispute concerning predictability; and thirdly, some attempt should have been made to show that such freedom as the argument establishes (if it is valid) is of ethical importance.
