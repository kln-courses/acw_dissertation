<plain_text><page sequence="1">GENERAL WORKS ON THE AMERICAN INDIAN A Descriptive Bibliography THOMAS TORRANS by Mr. Torrans, assistant to the editor of this journal, is a graduate student at the University of Arizona. He received the Master's degree in anthropology at the University of Texas. Edward Burnett Tylor, sometimes spoken of as the English "father" of anthropology, observed almost a century ago that "the science of cul- ture is essentially a reformer's science." But "reform" has become increas- ingly something more than a mere clamor for change. This is especially true since the life-habits of all people have been more and more subjected to investigations which are removed from anthropomorphic logic and have become, instead, the subject matter of scientifically critical studies. In the United States no group has come in for more signal attention as a proper subject for both reform and anthropological investigation than the American Indian. In little more than a century the historic role of the Indian has changed from that of native landlord - by virtue of use and custom - to that of both problem and ward of the Federal government, to that of citizen - but one who is still the concern of governmental agencies administering friendly counsel and paternal guidance. Many writers from both governmental and anthropological ranks have undertaken from time to time to explain in full-length works something C79)</page><page sequence="2">80 ARIZONA and the WEST of the nature of Indians, and to account for the state of affairs in which they have come to find themselves. Others, seeking to do much the same thing from an unofficial and non- academic point of view, have placed many "Indian" books in the popular market. An assessment of the many general works on the American Indian, then, tends to show something of the various approaches directed toward these people, both in point of thoughtful interpretation and reformist efforts. Each of the forty-five works selected here for bibliographical comment has been singled out because it addresses itself to the North American In- dian as a general topic, and because each contains material relevant to Indians of the United States - particularly of the American West where approximately four-fifths of all Indians in the United States are now lo- cated. Works of an essentially archaeological and prehistoric character, such as Hannah Marie Wormington's Ancient Man in North America and Louis A. Brennan's No Stone Unturned: An Almanac of North American "Prehistory have been omitted. Certain others with a particular regional approach, such as Harold S. Gladwin's A History of the Ancient Southwest and George E. Hyde's Indians of the High Plains: From the Prehistoric Period to the Coming of Europeans have also been excluded as not sufficiently general. Tribal histories or studies have been left out as well as some works which are of a general character - but concerned with some minor theme - such as G. E. Lindquist's quasi-religious sur- vey, The Red Man in the United States: An Intimate Study of the Social, Economic, and Religious Life of the American Indian. In a sense, then, the following bibliography is guilty of arbitrariness by way of exercising selection and assortment of the literature. In its total structure, however, and taken chronologically, the output of this general literature shows a certain evolutionary character and puts forward a broad view of the American Indian and especially his role throughout the his- tory of the American West.</page><page sequence="3">BIBLIOGRAPHY 81 1841 Catlin, George. LETTERS AND NOTES ON THE MANNERS, CUSTOMS, AND CONDITIONS OF THE NORTH AMERICAN INDIANS: Written during eight years' travel amongst the ivildest tribes of Indians in North America in 1832 . . . and '39. London: Published by the author. 2 vols. Finding no market for his art in the United States, George Catlin took his "Indian Gallery" to London where he exhibited his numerous paintings and materials on the Indians of Western America in Egyptian Hall, and lectured there on these people whom he so earnest- ly loved. Shortly he began preparation of these profusely illustrated volumes which, supplemented with his letters and notes made during lengthy experience among various tribes in the West, depicted these people and their habits of life. Catlin's great work and, in essence, his life itself are epitomized in these two rare 300-page volumes. With sundry alterations, the volumes were published more than a dozen times and dominated the field of Western painting for years. Catlin's art has been described as both "romantic" and "realistic," while some critics have simply tried to assign him a place in the "American primitive" school. But his work remains the most extensive pictorial documentary on North American Indians, and his notes and letters are among the earliest general summaries on their customs. Indians so fascinated Catlin that in his 60's he made extensive trips into the interior of Brazil to paint the natives of South America. Catlin's own story, furnished with almost 170 illustrations of his most famous works, has recently been told by Har- old McCracken in George Catlin and the Old Frontier (New York: Dial Press, 1959). 1851-57 Schoolcraft, Henry R. INFORMATION RESPECTING THE HISTORY, CON- DITIONS, AND PROSPECTS OF THE INDIAN TRIBES OF THE UNITED STATES. Philadelphia: Lippincott, Grambo &amp; Co. 6 vols. These half dozen volu- minous tomes, which were subsidized by the Federal government through the Bureau of Indian Affairs, are the heritage of a Congressional bill of 1847 for which the author had lobbied during the previous year. This legislation instructed the Secretary of War to collect statistics on all tribes within the Union as well as materials to illustrate their "history, conditions, and prospects," and placed the direction of this inquiry in the hands of Henry Rowe Schoolcraft, a former agent for Indian affairs and a prodigious writer on Indians for thirty years. Schoolcraft's volumes - which took on several different titles in the course of varying edi- tions - carry the illustrative work of a United States Army captain, Seth East- man, and several other artists. They also contain a profusion of material gathered by Schoolcraft from men, with experience among Indians, to whom he had sent a series of interrogatories. That erudite baronial traveler of the Americas, Alex- ander von Humboldt, called it "an immense Scrap-book on the North American Indians." In the introductory biographical sketch, apparently written by Schoolcraft himself to preface his Personal Memoirs of a Residence of Thirty Years With the Indian Tribes on the American Frontiers . . . 1812-1842 (Philadelphia: Lippincott, Gambo &amp; Co., 1851), the author described it as "a work which is national in its</page><page sequence="4">82 ARIZONA and the WEST conception and manner of execution; and, if carried out according to the plan exhibited, will do ample justice at once to the Indian tribes, their history, con- dition, and destiny, and to the character of the government as connected with them." He continued: "We have been reproached by foreign pens of our treatment of these tribes, and our policy, motives, and justice impugned. If we are not mis- taken, the materials here collected will show how gratuitous such imputations have been. It is believed that no stock of the aborigines found by civilized nations on the globe, have received the same amount of considerate and benevolent and hu- mane treatment ... in the face of the most hostile, wrongheaded, and capricious conduct on their part, that ever signalized the history of a barbarous people." Schoolcraft's first wife, Jane Johnston, had been of Algonquin stock on her mother's side; and for almost twenty years, until her death, the Schoolcraft family resided on the frontiers of the Great Lakes. It was largely on the basis of personal expe- riences here, and professional service with the Bureau of Indian Affairs, that Schoolcraft relied in drawing up questionaires through which he collected the voluminous data - gathered by other agents, trappers, traders, Army personnel, and missionaries - that make up the volumes. Frances S. Nichols' recent Index to Schoolcraft's "Indian Tribes of the United States" (Bureau of American Eth- nology Bulletin 152: Washington, 1954) will assist researchers in extracting in- formation from the badly arranged set, a task which formerly, as John M. Roberts has remarked, "could be so tedious that many were deterred from consulting the books." Although the Schoolcraft work has been superseded in much of its infor- mation, it continues to be valuable for its wealth of ethnographic content. 1865 Brownell, Charles De Wolf. THE INDIAN RACES OF NORTH AND SOUTH AMERICA: Comprising an Account of the Principal Aboriginal Races; A Descrip- tion of Their National Customs, Mythology, and Religious Ceremonies; The His- tory of Their Most Powerful Tribes, and of Their Most Celebrated Chiefs and Warriors; Their Intercourse and Wars With the European Settlers; And a Great Variety of Anecdote and Description, Illustrative of Personal and National Char- acter. Hartford: Hurlbut, Scranton &amp; Co. (760 pp.) Brownell's work was one of the earliest attempts to encompass in one volume a full treatment of Indians of the Americas. Although neither documented nor indexed, it has an appendix which indicates some of the source materials, as well as a prefatory list of fifty-four works "from which most of the facts embodied in this outline of history and description have been obtained " The arrangement is essentially geographical; Indian groups are aligned under fifteen areal divisions so that only two sections - "Vari- ous Nations and Tribes Between the Mississippi and the Pacific Ocean" and "The Sioux Massacre" - center directly upon Indians in the American West. Brownell lamanted the fate that the Indian had steadily been approaching, and he focused a Christian attitude on Indian-white relations: "To say that massacres must be avenged, in order to justify our slaughter of Indians, is a logic that will not stand before the great tribunal of heaven." The author believed the Sioux Mass-</page><page sequence="5">BIBLIOGRAPHY 83 acre was "but the beginning of troubles if the nation persists in the policy it has pursued for the last thirty years. ... It becomes the people to inqure why it is that we are scarcely ever without an Indian war on our borders, while Canada has never been cursed with one. This single fact shows that there is a radical wrong in our system." 1874 Walker, Francis A. THE INDIAN QUESTION. Boston: J. R. Osgood &amp; Co. (268 pp.) In his 1872 report as Commissioner of Indian Affairs, Francis Amasa Walker observed: "When the expansion and development of a civilized race involve the rapid destruction of the only means of subsistence possessed by the members of a less .fortunate race, the higher is bound as a simple right to provide for the lower some substitute for the means of subsistence which it has destroyed." Commissioner Walker's substitute was essentially one dedicated to putting the Indian on "the white man's road." It was, according to Walker, "directing these people to new pursuits which shall be consistent with the progress of civilization upon the con- tinent." Walker's book, which incorporates this report with articles published in 1873 and 1874, offers a brief historical "account of the tribes" and a discussion of Indian "citizenship." As such, it is especially representative of policies that were fashionable during the 1870's and 1880's. The administrative policy at this time was the subsistence of Western Indians as a means of quietening them while stead- ily diminishing their landed domain through treaties. Commissioner Walker's tract is partially directed toward .further indoctrinating the Indian into a part of this American way in order to qualify successfully among the citizenry at large and ul- timately dismiss themselves as objects of Federal sustenance. 1880 Manypenny, George W. OUR INDIAN WARDS. Cincinnati: Robert Clarke &amp; Co. (436 pp.) This author, who held the position of Commissioner of Indian Affairs from 1853 to 1857, was, he writes, "moved by a sincere desire to render service in the amelioration of the condition of our Indian population." His volume amounts to something of a history in that it chronicles both civil and military re- lations with these "wards of the government" from the early 1600's through the 1870's. The greater part of the treatise is concerned with Indians of the Western territories, and it concludes with an account of the treatment accorded the Utes during the years 1863-79. During his tenure as commissioner, Manypenny visited a large number of tribes in the West, and his feeling was that "the administration of the affairs of the Indians was not wholly free from abuses." He observed, in fact, that Indians living near Fort Leavenworth were "more demoralized than those who lived in localities more distant." And in his annual report for 1856 he had written: "In no former equal period of our history have so many treaties been made, or such vast accessions of land been obtained." Manypenny 's book is largely a tale of treaty-making, and a plea for fair and equable treatment for the Indian - however, as a source it should be used only with discrimination.</page><page sequence="6">84 ARIZONA and the WEST 1881 Jackson, Helen Hunt. A CENTURY OF DISHONOR: A Sketch of the United States Government's Dealings With Some of the Indian Tribes. New York: Harper &amp; Brothers. (457 pp.) New edition, enlarged by the addition of the report of the needs of the Mission Indians of California, Boston: Roberts Brothers, 1886. (514 pp.) The publication of this book led to Mrs. Jackson's appointment in 1882 to make a survey of conditions among the Mission Indians of California, a study which she incorporated in later editions of her crusading volume. The book had a significant effect in some official circles, but not sufficiently so as to cause any profound change in the national attitude toward the Indian. Throughout the book Mrs. Jackson deplores the nefarious treatment of various North American Indian peoples by the Federal government. The work records official relations with six tribes - Cherokees, Cheyennes, Delawares, Nez Perces, Poncas, and Winnebagos - and describes three infamous slaughters of Indians by whites: the Conestoga Massacre, the Gnadenhutten Massacre, and the Camp Grant Massacre in Arizona. The author, subsequently famous for her novel on the Cahuilla Indians of Cali- fornia - Ramona, published in 1884 - includes a substantiating appendix, which, with her own report on the Mission Indians made to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, runs to 171 pages. The report, in itself, forms a lengthy narrative on de- spoilation and abuse of Indians in the United States. 1882 Bancroft, Hubert Howe. THE NATIVE RACES OF THE PACIFIC STATES. San Francisco: A. L. Bancroft &amp; Co. 5 vols. As Bancroft plunged deeper into his writings on Pacific America he became increasingly convinced, as his biographer John W. Caughey has said, that he must "begin at the beginning of Pacific states history." This phase of his task, in which he had to account for the Indian, Ban- croft did not relish. "I did not fancy them," he admitted. "I would gladly have avoided them. I was no archaeologist, ethnologist, or antiquary, and had no desire to become such. My tastes in the matter, however, did not dispose of the subject. The savages were there, and there was no help for me; I must write them up to get rid of them." For Bancroft there was little of value in the subject save as a background for his extensive investigations, and he conceived his task as essen- tially a description of the Indian inhabitants from Alaska to Darien prior to Eur- opean contact. Anthropological investigation was then in its infancy, and there was no established pattern Bancroft might follow. He adopted a method which has come to be regarded as something of a precursor of the latter and more re- fined scheme of study known as the "culture area" concept. His approach was to systematize his material geographically from north to south, beginning with the Eskimos or what Bancroft called "Hyperboreans." Volume One is devoted to what Bancroft called "The Wild Tribes" and the second volume to "Civilized Nations" - the Aztecan and Mayan cultures. The three remaining volumes - "Myths and Languages," "Antiquities," and "Primitive History" - support the second volume</page><page sequence="7">BIBLIOGRAPHY 85 rather than the first, although parts of each of the five have to do with Indians of the West. The set, like other volumes of the thirty-nine which comprise Bancroft's Works, is outdated, but not uniformly so. Some of the material is still useful if coupled with the results of recent anthropological investigations. 1882 Dodge, Richard Irving. OUR WILD INDIANS: Thirty-three Years' Personal Ex- perience Among the Red Men of the Great West; A Popular Account of Their Social Life, Religion, Habits, Traits, Customs, Exploits, Etc., With Thrilling Ad- ventures and Experiences on the Great Plains and in the Mountains of Our Wide frontier. Hartford: A. D. Worthington &amp; Co. (623 pp.) "The Indian of America/' observed General William T. Sherman in the introduction to this book which Colonel Dodge dedicated to him, "has been for centuries the subject of study and romance; alternately treated as an unmitigated savage, or as the dashing, bold hero fighting for his native land and his inherited privileges. Yours is the first attempt of which I have knowledge, to treat him as he exists in fact. . . ." What Sherman meant here is explained by Dodge early in the book: "Writing of the Indian of forty years ago, Catlin says: 'In his native state, he is an honest, hospit- able, brave, warlike, cruel, revengeful, relentless, yet honorable, contemplative, and religious being.' To these epithets, which are yet true in a certain sense. . . . I add that he is vain, crafty, deceitful, ungrateful, treacherous, grasping, and utterly selfish. He is lecherous, without honor or mercy; filthy in his ideas and speech, and inconceivably dirty in person and manners. He is affectionate, patient, self- reliant, and enduring. He has a marvellous instinct in traveling, and a memory of apparently unimportant landmarks simply wonderful. In short, he has the or- dinary good and bad qualities of the mere animal, modified to some extent by reason." Dodge later attempted to qualify his observations by defining "wild": "I apply the term 'wild' to a class of Indians to distinguish it from another class in- habiting the Indian Territory, or living within the boundaries of some of the States, and which has made some progress in civilization and moral knowledge. With these exceptions, the vast numbers of Indians in the territory of the United States are 'wild.' " In essence, then, this book attempts to delineate Western In- dians in general as the totally depraved creatures which the author had assured himself they were. Colonel Dodge, who spent more than half his adult life in molesting these Indians on their diminishing frontiers, was not to be taken in by any other characterization of these people than that which he had fashioned for himself during his career as a fighting man. But even Dodge could entertain some hope of "solving our Indian problem." The Indian, he wrote, "has never had a fair chance, and he is entitled to a full and fair trial. That, with his miserable op- portunities, he has been at least partially civilized ... is ample evidence of capacity for a further improvement." Dodge's book is illustrative of the inherited opinion on the Indian held nationally during the waning years of the nineteenth century.</page><page sequence="8">86 ARIZONA and the WEST 1895 Grinnell, George Bird. THE STORY OF THE INDIAN. New York: D. Appleton &amp; Co. (270 pp.) Grinnell, who wrote extensively on Plains Indians and lived for several years among the Cheyennes, attempted in this book to convey to the lay reader the full scope of Indian li.fe, both before and after the coming of the white man. As the first volume in a series edited by Ripley Hitchcock, it was de- signed to tell the story of the Indian in the West in a popular fashion. Grinnell's treatment, however, is highly uneven. Frederick Webb Hodge, in a review in the American Anthropologist, summarized by saying: "Although the statements are intended to be general . . . the more specific details are drawn chiefly from the tribes with which the author is most familiar - the Blackfeet, Cheyennes, and Pawnees of the buffalo region." 1900 Dellenbaugh, Frederick S. THE NORTH AMERICANS OF YESTERDAY: A Comparative Study of North American Indian Life, Customs, and Products, on the Theory of the Ethnic Unity of the Race. New York and London: G. P. Putnam's Sons. Reprinted 1902, 1906. (487 pp.) Dellenbaugh's resume of the life-habits and industries of the native North Americans achieved a fair measure of popu- larity at the turn of the century. The author had some experience with Indians in the West, having accompanied the second Colorado River expedition of Major John Wesley Powell to whom he dedicated this volume. The book is principally a comparative discussion of the material culture of diverse Indian peoples between Central America and Alaska, but five chapters relate to less patently materialistic observations on the Indian life process. Approximately 350 illustrations - which are, indeed, fine selective representations - support the author's paramount con- cern with material culture. On the whole, the book is rather out of step with present-day information, and so many of the author's personalized interpretations fall within the evil pale of the "value judgment" that it can be used only with sustained caution. Dellenbaugh, who horrified all Mexicanists by advancing the idea that the Aztec calendar design was taken from a fifteenth-century European mariner's compass, tended to favor some bizarre notions about American natives - a people, he proclaimed, "whose sun has set." 1903 Thomas, Cyrus. THE INDIANS OF NORTH AMERICA IN HISTORIC TIMES. Philadelphia: George Barries Sons. (458 pp.) This second volume of the twenty- volume History of North America, edited by Guy Carleton Lee, reaches from the aboriginal peoples of the West Indies and Central America to the Indians of the St. Lawrence and of the Northwest Coast. In time it extends from 1492 to 1901. In its day the book could be characterized as one of "peculiar value," as the editor emphasized in his introduction, because "it is the only work upon its subject which furnishes a comprehensive view of the history of the Indians of North America from the year in which Christopher Columbus greeted the aborigines of the islands</page><page sequence="9">BIBLIOGRAPHY 87 of the Caribbean Sea down to the present date." The work does satisfy a certain minimum of historical craftsmanship, but in the main it is rather a chronicle of encounters between Indians and transplanted Europeans. In spite of serving pro- fessionally as archaeologist in the Bureau of American Ethnology, Thomas kept curiously free of any ethnologically-based explanations. Throughout the book the Indian simply comes into the most surface contacts with the white man; over half the volume is given to accounts of the Indian wars, which the author has can- vassed in a sectional configuration of seventeen areas. "There would seem to be half a dozen points of view," observed Carl Russell Fish in his evaluation in the American Historical Review, "from which a man of Mr. Thomas's equipment might write such a history with profit, but he avoids them all." The history unfortunately is neither documented nor vindicated with the trappings of a bibliography; but it does have, as Fish admitted, "a permanent value as an encyclopedia of Indian tribes and wars." 1904 Farrand, Livingston. BASIS OF AMERICAN HISTORY, 1500-1900. New York and London: Harper Bros. (303 pp.) The frontispiece of this book - a portrait of Chief Joseph of the Nez Perces - sets the Indian tone of this second volume of The American Nation, the famous historical series edited by Alfred Bushnell Hart. Farrand, a medical man, was a professor of anthropology at Columbia Uni- versity. His book, he stated, was "an attempt to describe, as fully as the limits . . . will permit, those features of North America and its native inhabitants which have been of greatest significance in the history of the United States." Devoting the first few chapters to physiographic and ecological features of the North Ameri- can landscape, Farrand quickly incorporates within this framework the story of the white man wresting the more habitable regions from the Indians. The bulk of the work, however, comprises brief anthropological assessments of some 300 tribes and a sixfold classificatory scheme, wherein one chapter is employed in a description of the geographical area and the principal cultural traits of its inhabi- tants. W. H. Holmes, whose review appeared in both the American Anthropolo- gist and the American Historical Review, described the book as "charmingly simple, direct and comprehensive," and added: "The reader is not led into trouble- some mazes of speculation, nor is he asked to skate on the thin ice of precon- ceived notions " Farrand concluded with chapters on social anthropology and a discerning essay on his source materials, but over half a century of intensive study of North American Indians has thoroughly outmoded this volume. It remains little more than a decently representative statement on this phase of history in the early twentieth century. 1905 Humphrey, Seth K. THE INDIAN DISPOSSESSED. Boston: Little, Brown &amp; Co. Reissued 1906. (298 pp.) A writer of several travel books, Humphrey has com- piled here a series of quoted extracts from various reports of Federal agents to</page><page sequence="10">88 ARIZONA and the WEST the Commissioner of Indian Affairs. Not only is the material undocumented, but the author quotes profusely and often with no mention even of the reporter's name. After an introduction of imaginary conversation in which the Indian becomes aware of the avaricious policy of the white man through an omniscient creature cast as the "great father," Humphrey begins his main theme. The object of it all is "to pick out the official narratives of a few Indian tribes and present the Indian in his unromantic reality ... a being bearing the impress of a common Maker at the absolute mercy of those who profess that 'all men are created equal/ " Aside from the last three chapters, which broadly portray the sequestration of In- dians and their lands, the author allows these Federal reports to tell the story of dispossession of the Umatillas, the Flatheads, the Nez Perces, the Poncas, and the California Mission Indians. The book is on a crusading level with that of Helen Hunt Jackson's Century of Dishonor, but in all other aspects it falls short. It is indeed unfortunate that the extensively quoted materials are not substantiated. 1907-30 Curtis, Edward S. THE NORTH AMERICAN INDIAN: Being a Series of Vol- umes Picturing and Describing the Indians of the United States and Alaska. New York: Published by the author. 20 vols. These twenty massive volumes are a testi- monial to Curtis' skill not only as an excellent cameraman but also as a descrip- tive writer and an acute observer of Indian life. Curtis was already a well-known photographer of Indian subjects when he undertook the preparation of these ethnographic volumes which constitute his life's work. J. Pierpont Morgan, in his occasional role as patron of the arts, underwrote the expenses for Curtis' field study, and Frederick Webb Hodge assisted in an editorial capacity. When the first two volumes, which portray twelve Indian peoples of the Southwest, appeared toward the close of 1907, they were enthusiastically proclaimed. In a review of these ini- tial volumes, G. B. Gordon assured readers of the American Anthropologist that the work "was not to be classified with those that are written for the specialist," because, "while its value to science cannot be over-estimated, its appeal is rather to the general public, and the form in which it is cast makes it not only intelligible but vastly interesting even to those uninstructed in the methods of ethnology." The reviewer concluded that the work was "entitled to the notable distinction of being the first general work dealing on a large scale with the habits and customs of the American Indian which presents a true picture of Indian life." This illus- trative artistry and competent ethnographic craftsmanship hold true for each vol- ume in the set. In 1911 when volumes Six, Seven, and Eight appeared, William C. Farabee could continue to attest their quality. "It would seem impossible," wrote Farabee in the American Anthropologist, "to improve upon the book-making and techniques of the earlier volumes, but these later ones show progressive improve- ment in spirit and scope." Still later, in reviewing the twelfth volume in 1925, Ruth Benedict called Curtis' treatment of the Hopi "that much needed summary of a Pueblo culture" and concluded that it was "as successful as a descriptive book well might be." The series contains little relating to Indian-Caucasoid relations,</page><page sequence="11">BIBLIOGRAPHY 89 or even to historic patterns of the various tribes; it is patently ethnographic and is the culmination of the earlier attempts which sought to treat the North Amer- ican Indian in the grand manner. It was not the general public to whom these expensive volumes were addressed. The very scope and bulk of the work and its high artistic treatment, furthermore, have restricted its use even as a scholarly tool - and the limited edition of 500 has relegated these volumes to special col- lections of academic libraries and museums. But the volumes are true caches of ethnographic lore on the native American, much of which has not yet been drawn off into the stream of Western American history. As Theodore Roosevelt observed in his brief handwritten foreword: "The Indian as he has hitherto been is on the point of passing away. ... It would be a veritable calamity if a vivid and truthful record of these conditions were not kept." 1907-10 Hodge, Frederick Webb (ed.) HANDBOOK OF AMERICAN INDIANS NORTH OF MEXICO. Washington: Government Printing Office. 2 vols. Re- issued, New York: Pageant Books, 1959. Bulletin No. 30 of the Bureau of Ameri- can Ethnology is the combined product of 100 contributors working under the structural and editorial mastery of Hodge, who was head of the Bureau from 1905 until 1918. The arrangement is alphabetical: the 972 pages of Volume One range from A through M; the second volume, which runs from N through Z, comprises in its greater bulk of 1,221 pages both the comprehensive index and a system of cross-references to Indian group names, settlements, names of chiefs, and similar data which makes the Handbook so invaluable a reference tool. The volumes are actually far more than "handbooks;" they are encyclopedic lexicons on the Indians north of Mexico and guides to the literature on North American Indians as far as the year 1910. One of the chief aims was "to provide a key to the intricate nomenclature of tribes and minor divisions," wrote Clark Wissler in his evaluation of the first volume for the American Anthropologist in 1907. "Everyone who has attempted to use the available literature in working out the aboriginal culture of any part of the continent," added Wissler, "realizes the great value of such a key in establishing the identity of tribes appearing under almost as many names as there are writers. In addition . . . specific references to the use of the various terms are given, so that the work as a whole is a systematic bibliography of North Amer- ican ethnology." Hodge's Handbook is one of the great milestones in the systema- tization of the study of the Indian in North America. 1910 Leupp, Francis E. THE INDIAN AND HIS PROBLEM. New York: Charles Scrib- ner's Sons. (369 pp.) Leupp, who served some twenty-five years with Federal agencies and who was Commissioner of Indian Affairs at the turn of the century, discusses here certain traits of Indian culture, the precarious legal status of Indians at the time, and the chief legislative acts which have grossly affected this people. In the first portion of the book the author confines himself to such topics as the</page><page sequence="12">90 ARIZONA and the WEST Indian Service, the operation of the Burke Law of 1906, and theory and practice in Indian education. The remainder is more general in character, allowing Leupp to draw on personal experiences and illustrative instances of Indian "nature." In- deed, as Frank A. Golder remarked in the American Historical Review, "one meets 'my programme' and 'my plan' so often that the impression is left that Mr. Leupp is the originator of the ideas which he put in practice." Yet, on the whole, Leupp presented the existing situation and at least a part of its historical background in a creditable way. His book deserves appreciation as an attempt to reach the public with an interpretative survey on Indians of the United States and at a time when few questions were more controversial than that of liberating the Indians from governmental control. 1910 McLaughlin, James. MY FRIEND THE INDIAN. Boston and New York: Hough- ton Mifflin Co. (417 pp.) McLaughlin had his first intimate contact with Indians on the Dakota plains in 1871. He lived among, or had official contact with, In- dians of North America for thirty-eight years, both as agent to the Sioux at Devil's Lake and Standing Rock in North Dakota and as United States Indian Inspector. His book is more than a collection of reminiscences or a nonprofessional ethnog- raphy; it contains several historical accounts - "The Battle of the Little Big Horn," "The Death of Sitting Bull," "Captain Jack and His Modocs," "The Masterly Retreat of Joseph and His Nez Perces" - which, because of the author's acquaint- ance with participants, give the volume a certain importance. The book is indexed and contains sixteen illustrations, several of which are portraits of Western Indian chiefs. McLaughlin, whose final chapter is a humanitarian plea to "Give the Red Man His Portion," has told his story in a creditable and entertaining fashion. But the author was rather too "pro-Indian" to maintain a dispassionate interpretation, and generally he held the opinion that understanding these people was something of a vested right reserved only for members of the Indian Service. "His mind un- consciously refuses to admit," wrote Frank A. Golder in the American Historical Review, "that anyone not officially connected with the service knows or has a right to speak of the Indian." 1914 Leupp, Francis E. IN RED MAN'S LAND: A Study of the American Indian. New York: Fleming H. Revell Co. (161 pp.) Commissioner Leupp's second general work on Indians of North America attempts, along very generalized lines, to dis- pose of several popular misconceptions about Indian people. The author's aim here is "to deal with the Indian as an individual" rather than as a group. The book is a sincere effort to describe the Indian generally, as he was prior to white contact and in his later relations with the Federal government in particular. Leupp was scarcely objective in his enthusiasm to advertise what he believed to be the superi- ority of the "white civilization" which native Americans had now "gained;" but he was capable of interpreting simply, and at times vividly, much of the cultural</page><page sequence="13">BIBLIOGRAPHY 91 animus of these peoples whom he served as "Little White Father." Even more than this he recognized some of the hazards and hardships confronting any individual who attempts to adapt to a new and different order of life. 1914 Moorhead, Warren K. THE AMERICAN INDIAN IN THE UNITED STATES, Period 1850-1914. Andover (Mass.) The Andover Press. (440 pp.) The author, who was curator of the department of American archaeology at the Phillips Acad- emy in Andover, Massachusetts, seems often to have lost sight completely of his intention to "present a history of the American Indian during the transition pe- riod." The work is scarcely a history in even the most bizarre sense of the word; nor is it to be counted in the field of ethnology. Moorehead, who was naive enough m his earlier work, The Stone Age in North America (Boston and New York: Houghton Mifflin Co., 2 vols., 1910), to say that "it is unfortunate that Coronado, De Soto, Captain Smith, Hennepin, Marquette and the Pilgrim Fathers did not give us more detail about stone-age times," has done nothing to redeem himself in this book. It is a garbled, disjointed, floundering attempt to parade a widely disconnected and sundry amount of secondary material through the pages of a single volume. While there are illustrations and an index, the book is totally with- out plan or structure and draws heavily from episodes recounted in four of the author's favorite sources - the volumes of Seth K. Humphrey, Helen Hunt Jack- son, Francis E. Leupp, and James McLaughlin. The author explains in his own masterly fashion why no bibliography is included: "It is difficult, if not impossible, to compile a satisfactory bibliography relating to Indians and Indian affairs be- tween the years 1850 and 1914." 1917 Wissler, Clark. THE AMERICAN INDIAN: An Introduction to the Anthropology of the New World. New York: Douglas C. McMurtrie. (435 pp.); 2nd and 3rd editions, New York: Oxford University Press, 1922, 1938. (474 pp.) In this volume Wissler gives fundamental interpretation to the concept of the "culture area," a classificatory scheme for grouping both material and spiritual elements of human societies with a view to tracing the distribution of such traits to some one common "center." Fifteen culture areas are described - ten .for North America and five for the Americas south - so that the discussion of each follows one gen- eral plan wherein broad categories of culture items are passed under review. His is a materialistic approach with its foundation in the natural geography of the areas assigned; Wissler looks largely toward a classification built on an ecological footing. The scheme of approach was not original with Wissler, but in his hands it has received its widest attempt at formulation. Wissler's idea, however, is to treat fundamental problems from an anthropological point of view rather than to pass on all phases of Indian life. "Considering its range," wrote A. L. Kroeber in the American Anthropologist in 1918, "it is marvelousiy free from technical terms and professional considerations." Professor Kroeber further hailed the work</page><page sequence="14">92 ARIZONA and the WEST as "distinctly a successful endeavor to be a piece of science," and declared that Wissler had "looked almost wholly for mass results and . . . got them in a degree that makes all previous efforts in the same direction seem feebly puny." 1919 Huntington, Ellsworth. THE RED MAN'S CONTINENT: A Chronicle of Abor- iginal America. New Haven: Yale University Press. (183 pp.) Huntington's small volume in the Chronicles of America series "aimed first," as he described it, "to present in readable form the main facts about the geographical environment of American history." Four of the five chapters are principally devoted to this ideal which the author - essentially a geographer - carries off very well. On the whole, the book is an introductory geography to North America and the environ- mental influence it has exercised upon its peoples - Indians, Europeans, and Ne- groes. Only the final chapter is dedicated wholly to a discussion of the Indian, and most of the information here derives from Frederick Webb Hodge's Handbook of American Indians North of Mexico. Throughout the book Huntington, as Evarts B. Greene observed in the American Historical Review, "contributes generously of his favorite thesis on the relation of geographic features, especially climate, to the evolution of society." 1927 Radin, PauL THE STORY OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN. New York: Boni &amp; Liveright. (371 pp.); 2nd ed., New York: Liveright Publishing Corp., 1934 (383 pp.); Garden City, New York: Garden City Publishing Co., 1937 (383 pp.); en- larged ed., 1944 (391 pp.) Although this volume by the late Paul Radin occasion- ally falls short of historical accuracy, the strength of its basic theme - the unfold- ing story of the Indian in the Western hemisphere and the spreading of the great centers of Indian culture - runs steadily through the book at a fast pace. Con- fected from what are generally considered the more popular and representative monographs of the salient Indian peoples of the Americas, the account is designed to be suggestive; it depicts the dispersion of a native American culture from its "great civilizations that developed in Mexico, Central America and along the Pa- cific coast of South America from Ecuador to Peru." It is not an original view, but under Radin's skillful phrases the theme finds its most comprehensive and unify- ing synthesis thus far. "The fundamental ideas," as A. L. Kroeber pointed out in 1928 in the American Anthropologist, "are those first outlined by Boas, systemati- cally substantiated by Wissler ... and now carried still farther by Dr. Radin: higher culture originating in Middle America with the Maya area as a focal point, raying out, gradually weakening and altering through infiltration with various simpler cultures of local origin." The author's racy literary style gives the work a popular and almost novelesque flavor rather than a "scientific" one. The setting is hemis- pherically broad, and the development of the unifying thesis resembles the under- pinning of a plot moving constantly toward a climax. Yet this historical synthesis, around which the whole book is constructed, is scarcely of a more speculative reach than that found in several other volumes which have claimed a scientific basis. But</page><page sequence="15">BIBLIOGRAPHY 93 Radin's volume would, as Kroeber stipulated, "have to be supported by some show of evidence - something more than a statement of view followed by animated description - in order to be considered for scientific acceptance." 1927 Schmeckebier, Laurence F. THE OFFICE OF INDIAN AFFAIRS: Its History, Activities, and Organization. (Institute for Government Research, Service Mono- graphs of the United States Government No. 48). Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Press. (591 pp.) Because the Indian Service has been so long an institutional feature in the West and has exercised so powerful an influence on its Indian inhabitants, this volume, although not concerned with Indians per se, deserves a place among gen- eral works which have attempted to interpret the American Indian, perhaps espe- cially in the West. As the forty-eighth in a series of monographs designed to re- late the history and describe the activities and organization of all administrative agencies of the Federal government, this volume presents an estimable history of the Office of Indian Affairs which, as the author points out, "is practically the his- tory of the Indian policy of the United States." Like all the monographs in the series, the organization of the volume follows a uniform plan: a general history of the agency, its functions, organization, laws governing its operation, financial statements and, lastly, a full bibliography. Schmeckebier 's study is one of the fuller in the series, but the historical treatment is covered in 142 pages and is divided into three periods: the "Treaty Period" up to 1871; the "Reservation Period" from 1871 to 1887; and the "Allotment and Citizenship Period" from 1887 through the early 1920's. As Joseph C. Green admitted in the American Historical Review, this volume "contains an admirable history of the relations between the federal government and the Indians, from the days when the United States was solemnly guaranteeing to the Indians 'all their territorial rights in the fullest and most ample manner' to lands in Pennsylvania and Ohio, to the days of the 'Oil Indians' of Oklahoma." Even so, this "most disgraceful chapter in American history," con- cluded Green, "is summarized with great restraint, and the author, in accordance with the plan of the series, does not permit himself to indulge in adverse criticism." The remaining sections of the book are equally well done, but are more service- able to the student of government than to the historian with the exception of the bibliographical section which is quite thorough. 1928 MacLeod, William C. THE AMERICAN INDIAN FRONTIER. New York: Al- fred A. Knopf. (598 pp.) In this fortieth volume of The History of Civilization series, edited by C. K. Ogden, MacLeod rehearses the contacts between intruding Europeans and native Indian peoples on the frontiers of the New World, especially those of North America. The heavily documented volume is arranged in five parts so that Indians are introduced with chapters on their origins, their socio-economic life, and early contact with some of the less genial items in the European cultural baggage - alcohol and introductory diseases. The four remaining parts are de-</page><page sequence="16">94 ARIZONA and the WEST voted to discussions of the patterns of the Spanish - "The Conquerors" in the southern Americas - and to the British and French - "The Traders" in the north. Part Four contrasts these Latin and Anglo-Saxon undertakings in point of "social retrospects;" the final part, "The Sweep of Empire," carries Indians of the United States through their course of "removal" to the American West and the establish- ment of the reservation system. The volume is something of a historical pageant and the Indian does not, of course, come in for a full-scale ethnographic portrait. "Being an essay in the 'New History,' a socio-historical enterprise," MacLeod ex- plained, "emphasis is placed upon institutional evolution." Wilson D. Wallis, who was of the opinion that the anthropologist "does not care who destroyed the In- dian or how the job was done," explained in the American Anthropologist that the theme of the book would "probably attract the historians rather than the Americanists, for the approach is fundamentally regional and historical " Mac- Leod endeavored to construct an analysis of American frontier history in its broad- est scope, "made particularly," as he expressed it, "from the viewpoint of the In- dian side of the development." 1929 Gabriel, Ralph Henry. THE LURE OF THE FRONTIER: A Story of Race Con- flict. New Haven: Yale University Press. (327 pp.) Professor Gabriel's own con- tribution to the pictorial series under his editorship, The Pageant of America, this volume is directed toward chronicling "only the work of exploration which pre- ceded the advance of civilization " In this, it follows the earlier conception of the "westward movement" as seen by Frederick Jackson Turner - the frontier of the Atlantic coast, the successive waves of diverse groups of exploiters, the steady westward progression of the "fringe of settlement." But Gabriel further amplifies one of Turner's less developed points - the frontier as a meeting place of "sav- agery and civilization" - into what he calls the "long, sad story of race conflict." The book is something of a pictorial anthology on the events which generally characterize this steady movement, and on those individuals who played the larger roles in terminating this frontier. Frederic Logan Paxson, who defined the entire series as "fifteen volumes of picture-books with explanatory text," disagreed with the entire theme of Gabriel's effort in the Mississippi Valley Historical Review. Paxson, characteristically prejudicial of all Indians, asserted that "no fact of fron- tier development stands out more clearly than the unimportance of the Indian obstruction along the margins of frontier advance." Gabriel too, however, is usually guilty of judging the Indian from the standpoint of white civilization, but the book is valuable for its almost 600 plates of illustrative material and its succinct statements of several less conspicuous actors and incidents along the frontiers of young America. 1929 Seymour, Flora Warren. THE STORY OF THE RED MAN. London, New York, and Toronto: Longmans, Green &amp; Co. (421 pp.) Mrs. Seymour, a writer of several books which deal with Indians and a member of the Board of Indian Commis-</page><page sequence="17">BIBLIOGRAPHY 95 sioners, attempts here to tell the history of westward expansion from the point of view of the Indian. In doing so she has written something of a military history. The theme of the volume is, for the most part, contained in the tales of those more famous chiefs whose careers were embodied in their efforts to halt the pulsating advance of white men. Mrs. Seymour's sympathies, however, are only with the Indian, as Joseph C. Green pointed out in the American Historical Review, "so long as he does not stand in the way of advancing civilization." The book is espe- cially creditable in the author's emphasis upon two points which have since become almost commonplaces of interpretation: Indian economic dependence upon whites to the degree of absorption of certain of their technological equipment; and racial amalgamation from the time of the earliest contacts to the extent that the term "Indian" gradually failed to have true biological significance. But the point of view revealed in the work is on a par with that of "manifest destiny" and national self- determination. The volume is indexed, contains some thirty plates and a dozen maps and a section on source materials. 1931 Wise, Jennings C. THE RED MAN IN THE NEW WORLD DRAMA: A Polit- ico-Legal Study With a Pageantry of American History. Washington: W. F. Rob- erts Co. (628 pp.) Wise, who subtitled himself Wamdi Kasapa, "honorary chief- tain of the Yankton Sioux," chooses to begin his book with the Norse coloniza- tion of Greenland. This becomes, in the author's hands, a romantic fiction apparent- ly designed to fit in with numerous other fantasies which appear throughout the volume. A little over one-third of the book is devoted to the colonial period which works forward from the time of Sir Walter Raleigh. The eleventh chapter, how- ever, marks what might be termed the official point of departure for the thirty- three chapter work. Here the author moves in on his thesis by observing that: "No historian has undertaken up to this time to discuss the legal aspects of the transi- tion of the Indian tribes from the status of Crown vassals which they were given by the Proclamation of 1763, to that of political dependents o.f the United States." The following chapters attempt to describe the ensuing relationships which the Indians were fated for under the new order of the white immigrants up through the time of the Hoover administration. But, as E. Douglas Branch observed in the Mississippi Valley Historical Review, "Except that the subject-matter reaches to the present time, The Red Man in the New World Drama would appear as a distinguished piece of ante-bellum scholarship. . . ." Not only is the author's inter- pretation of the Indian hopelessly naive, but his knowledge of history in general and of the United States in particular approaches a broad sweep of almost total vacuity. The book is suffused with humanitarian interest grounded quite thor- oughly on a great deal of misinformation. 1933 Christensen, Thomas P. THE HISTORIC TRAIL OF THE AMERICAN IN- DIANS. Cedar Rapids: Laurance Press Co. (193 pp.) Christensen's survey is an attempt, as he explains, to present "in broad outlines the history of the Indians in</page><page sequence="18">96 ARIZONA and the WEST both Americas, from the earliest times to the present." To that end, then, some- thing - but not a great deal - is said on the archaeology, ethnography, history, and present-day standing of the native peoples in his expansive coverage. The book is lightly documented and indexed and affords a wide compilation of al- manac-like information on Indians at large. The approach to and utilization of the source materials are not as judicious as most specialists would have them, and a bibliography is dismissed with entirely. 1933-34 McKenney, Thomas L, and Hall, James. THE INDIAN TRIBES OF NORTH AMERICA: With Biographical Sketches and Anecdotes of the Principal Chiefs. A new edition edited by Frederick Webb Hodge, 3 vols. Edinburgh: John Grant. Two of these volumes and a fraction of the third are devoted to the biographical sketches; Hall's "Essay on the History of the North American Indians," however, comprises the bulk of Volume Three. This essay is produced without editorial changes, just as it was written by Hall well over a century ago before the scien- tific animus had taken hold in ethnological accounts. So that the author's state- ments on Indian customs and beliefs must, as Hodge warned, "usually be taken with allowance." Hodge rendered a genuine service in bringing out this 1933 edi- tion which combines the efforts of both these early nineteenth-century American- ists who, essentially, were bent on writing the same work. Hodge's introduction is itself a valuable contribution in defining governmental policies and relationships with Indians; at the same time it traces the sinuous and shadowy publication his- tory of the volumes leading to the final work in hand. Various and slightly differ- ing editions had appeared as early as 1833, a century before the present issue which contains 123 full-page color plates to accompany the biographical sketches. Both men were interested in Indians throughout their lives. McKenney, who was ap- pointed Superintendent of Indian Trade by President Madison in 1816 and re- appointed in 1820 by President Monroe, wrote considerably on Indians and was often accused of administrative corruption because of his Indian policies which many felt were too lenient and sympathetic. Hall, although trained in law, soon turned to literature and wrote extensively on the West. Hodge has best indicated the continuing importance of the volumes: "The value of the great work of McKenney and Hall lies chiefly in the fact that it records the features of numer- ous Indians prominent in the history of the American Commonwealth, faithfully reproduced from portraits painted from life, by far the most of which were subse- quently destroyed; and also in the fact that the data for many of the biographical notices were obtained during the lifetime of the individuals, and are now the only source of information respecting them." 1937 Kinney, J. P. A CONTINENT LOST - A CIVILIZATION WON: Indian Land Tenure in America. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Press. (366 pp.) A member of the Indian Bureau for over twenty-five years, Kinney attempts here a history of the 300-year record of legislative and administrative policy toward the American</page><page sequence="19">BIBLIOGRAPHY 97 Indian and his tribal lands in what has come to be the United States. "Bungling and ineffective as the methods may have been," the author stated, "unscientific and temporizing as the policies of the dominant race surely have been, much of the criticism heaped upon the legislative and executive branches of the Govern- ment has been essentially unfair and unjust and in many instances the implied condemnation or open denunciation of public officials charged with the duty of administering Indian affairs has been wholly unwarranted." It is from this point of view, then, that Kinney has gone about his task; and it is almost exclusively from reports of the Indian Office that he has pieced together the story. The author, who concluded that the American Indian had "lost a continent" but had "won a civilization," included a small bibliography and appendix, one fold-in map, eleven pictures and an index in his nonanalytical survey of legislation affecting the In- dian as a landlord. As a history of this legislation the book, as Paul Wallace Gates observed in the American Historical Review, "is a success, but it fails to discuss adequately the administrative record." 1939 Kroeber, A. L. CULTURAL AND NATURAL AREAS OF NATIVE NORTH AMERICA. Berkeley: University of California Press. (242 pp.) Professor Alfred Louis Kroeber's contribution to the establishment of geographical culture areas is of a piece with Wissler's earlier The American Indian. As such, it is one of the cornerstones of the literature of the culture area proponents. Kroeber's study at- tempts to go beyond Wissler's general principles, however, while accepting his conclusion that environment stabilizes a culture rather than produces it. The Kroe- ber treatise professes two objectives: a review of the environmental relations of native North American cultures, and an examination of the historic relations of the inhabitants of these culture areas. The eighty-four areas into which the continent is divided are a part of the broader scheme of a six-fold classification consisting of the Arctic Coast, Northwest Coast, the Southwest, Intermediate and Intermoun- tain, the East and North, and Mexico and Central America. Each of these geo- graphical units is interrelated, according to Kroeber, and each is also - with the partial exception of the Intermediate and Intermontane locale - "believed to rep- resent a substantial unit of historical development, or of a prevailing character- istic current of culture." Following the summaristic discussions of these broad areas and the "sub-cultures" within their confines, Kroeber continues with an examina- tion of population density in terms of cultural and other areas by utilizing the figures compiled by James Mooney. He proceeds to a comparison of physiographic areas, and three final chapters recapitulate the chief assumption on which the study is buiit - that "no culture is wholly intelligible without reference to the noncul- tural or so-called environment factors with which it is in relation and which con- dition it." Kroeber's volume - the thirty-eighth in the University of California Publications in American Archaeology and Ethnology - is, of course, a standard source for an understanding of the incipient Indian empires of North America. This is so even though his "historical approach" has never achieved a wide follow- ing of devotees; nor has its stressing of the geographical factor come out well in</page><page sequence="20">98 ARIZONA and the WEST the minds of those who cling to the concept of culture as being both mobile and evolutionary as well as impermanently fixed. 1939 Embree, Edwin R. INDIANS OF THE AMERICAS: Historical Pageant. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Co. (260 pp.) Embree, who has taken the theme of minority groups for others of his works, presents here something of a historic panorama of pre-eminent ancient Indian societies. A short prologue introduces Europeans into the Americas, and this is followed by a cursory treatment of the background of the American Indian as a separate and divergent cultural order. The bulk of the work is contained in the six "classic Indian cultures" which the author describes: Aztec, Inca, Maya, Iroquois, the Plains, and the Pueblos of the Southwest. The volume closes with a discussion of Indians in a "white world" and a list of schol- arly authorities to whom the author submitted his text for critical reading, "chap- ter by chapter." As a popular account of these celebrated "high cultures" of Indian attainment, the book deserves a successful rating. It is nicely written and carefully brings forward the view that, with all the white man has learned from these na- tive Americans, there is still much that they have to teach. 1940 Wissler, Clark. INDIANS OF THE UNITED STATES: Four Centuries of Their History and Culture. New York: Doubleday Doran. (319 pp.) Wissler abandoned his "culture area" concept in this volume for the "advancing frontier" hypothesis as a frame of reference. Indian groups are treated through an arrangement of language families and, although the book is popular in its style and format, much of the author's suggestive ideas are retained. It lacks, however, the searching analy- sis and structural rigor of his earlier work. Wissler, who was occasionally guilty of conveying the idea that the last word had been spoken on North American In- dians, organized this volume in three main parts: a discussion of pre-Columbian Indians; an examination, by way of linguistic divisions, of the "great Indian fam- ilies;" and a summation on Indian life as it came under the influence of white settlers and three of their most telling gifts - guns, horses, and whiskey. Gregory Mason, who interpreted the book as a "rearrangement" of The American Indian which was "aimed at the popular market," explained in the American Anthropoh' gist that since Wissler was "handicapped at the start by the grotesque attempt to confine his picture of the Indian to the political boundaries of the United States, the volume is fundamentally weak in plan." 1941 Beatty, Willard W. (ed.) INDIANS YESTERDAY AND TODAY. (Informa- tion Pamphlet No. 1; a publication o.f the Education Division, U.S. Office of In- dian Affairs.) Washington. (74 pp.) The thirteen chapters of this booklet, based on a series of radio programs during the winter of 1936-37 through which the Indian Service "endeavored to present the true picture of the American Indian and to dispel certain myths concerning the American Indian that have been current</page><page sequence="21">BIBLIOGRAPHY 99 for many years," discuss briefly the general history of the Indian and limited aspects of Indian culture. Essentially the pamphlet relates to the modern period and the recent innovations in the Indian way of life. Thirty-four illustrations ac- company this popular educational piece. The final chapter, "Our Indian Minority," was contributed by John Collier, then the Commissioner of Indian Affairs. 1942 LaFarge, Oliver (ed.) THE CHANGING INDIAN. Norman: University of Okla- homa Press. (184 pp.) This collection of papers by various students of the Indian and Indian affairs - John Collier, Dean Clark, LaFarge, Frank Lorimer, Harry L. Shapiro and others - evolved from a symposium arranged at the Museum of Mod- ern Art in New York by the American Association on Indian Affairs. Three of the papers are especially significant in that they deal with the question of Indian survival, the Indian agrarian problem, and the progress of Indian education. On the whole, however, the volume is concerned with acculturation and directed to students of the process. 1943 Loram, C. T., and Mcllwraith, T. F. (eds.) THE NORTH AMERICAN INDIAN TODAY. Toronto: University of Toronto Press. (361 pp.) This collection of some thirty papers delivered at the University of Toronto-Yale University seminar conference in 1939 affords a discussion of some of the major difficulties which con- front Indians as a minority people. These informal and unofficial statements, pre- sented alternately by Canadian and American representatives, represent the experi- ence of several groups who maintain close contact with Indians: government and corporate officials, social scientists, missionaries and, occasionally, other Indians. The articles, necessarily brief, are arranged on the basis of ten broad features of Indian life and are connected by short introductory picese written by Mcllwraith, a professor of anthropology. The papers are significant for the points of view they impart, and some especially for the factual data they contain. Several of the con- tributors - John Collier, Philleo Nash, and Ruth Underhill, for example - were widely known as spokesmen in the American field of anthropology. 1947 Collier, John. THE INDIANS OF THE AMERICAS. New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Co. (326 pp.) Collier, who held the post of Commissioner of Indian Affairs for a dozen years, was eminently successful in refocusing the view of the United States government toward its Indian inhabitants. His ideas on both Indian culture and Indian policy make the book, in a large sense, something of a treatise on applied anthropology, or what some have advocated as "social engineering." The book is an informal history of Indian America from earliest times up to the administrative entanglements of the 1940's. It makes aboriginal peoples the principal characters in this long drama, but their relations with the incoming European settlers are equally well told. The great pre-Cortesian cultural centers of the Aztecs and Incas are absorbingly reproduced; in the author's treatment they become the vivid</page><page sequence="22">100 ARIZONA and the WEST scenes of human activity. Later historic espisodes depict much of the ungraceful treatment meted these people by the Federal government. The book is an appeal- ing one; several slightly abridged paperback reprints attest its popularity. Collier set afoot many reforms, and the means for carrying them out, in the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Burt W. Aginsky, who called the work "a book by an inspired man," wrote in the American Anthropologist that Collier seemed to be "a man who has a definite solution based upon a lifetime of research and knowledge rather than on theory." Collier's book is persuasive in its sustained argument and reasonably creditable in its scope of fact; but the author's optimism is allowed rather too much freedom in anticipating solutions to the problem of cultural conflict. Beneath it all Collier strives constantly to tell of a people who had - and yet retain - "what the world has lost." 1949 McNickle, D'Arcy. THEY CAME HERE FIRST: The Epic of the American In- dian. Philadelphia and New York: J. B. Lippincott Co. (325 pp.) The author's point of view in this first volume of The Peoples of America series is indicated in its dedication to John Collier. The book is arranged in three parts. The first "Un- sealing a Continent," unfolds both archaeological and ethnological material in accounting for the separative features of linguistic and other cultural traits of Indians of the Americas. The second part, "New World Discovered," depicts in seven chapters the story of European settlement and colonial relations with In- dians through the Revolution. "Supplanting a People," the final part, picks up the narrative at 1783 and works through the various Federal treaties and programs of Indian removal to the less bountiful lands in the West, and terminates with a brief examination of the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 under the Roosevelt administration. The book presents a very decent survey of the part of Indians in the history of the continent. McNickle's own field of specialization, however, has been the history of Indian policy; and it is in this - essentially the third part of the volume - that he makes his major contribution. 1952 Swanton, John R. THE INDIAN TRIBES OF NORTH AMERICA. Bureau of American Ethnology Bulletin 145. Washington. (726 pp.) Swanton's volume is an attempt toward grouping those Indian peoples of North America who did not have "real tribal organizations." As the author explains, Purcell's map of "Lin- guistic Families of American Indians North of Mexico" appeared in 1891, but it gave no information on the various bands, groups or tribes not directly within a linguistic classification. Swanton's book is, for the most part, concerned with Indians of what now comprises the United Sttates proper; however, tribes of Alaska, Canada, Greenland, Mexico, Central America, and the West Indies receive some attention. Since the work is organized essentially in terms of modern North American political boundaries, it is especially adapted to assist the needs of those working in some one local field. The text, as the author explains, "has been devoted</page><page sequence="23">BIBLIOGRAPHY 101 to certain items of information likely to be called for first by the general reader, including the origin of the tribal name and . . . the most important synonyms, the linguistic connections of the tribe ... its location, a brief sketch of its history, its estimated and actual population at different periods " Four large fold-in maps are included as guides to tribal locations within the United States - in the northwest, northeast, southwest, and southeast - and the author has used the base date of 1650 in performing this exercise. "The compilation of this work," as John M. Roberts observed in the American Anthropologist, "required a very substantial amount of time and professional experience. It is a comprehensive reference work which is certain to be consulted for some years to come." 1953 Underhill, Ruth Murray. RED MAN'S AMERICA: A History of Indians in the United States. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. (400 pp.) Underbill's vol- ume makes available for the first time both a comprehensive and concise treatment o.f Indians of the United States. The approach is historical and follows the move- ment of white settlers across Indian lands. The first two chapters introduce the setting and the process of occupancy of the New World; a final chapter considers the turbulent development of United States Indian policy. The intervening eleven chapters discuss particular groups of Indian peoples from an anthropological point of examination. Underhill, who subscribes to the belief that it was impossible for the Indian in his historic role as hunter and fighter to maintain great areas of land undeveloped, presents in this volume the best historical synopsis to date on Indians of the United States. At the same time she offers a well-written and instructive introduction to the general habits of life of native Americans. 1954 Raphael, Ralph B. THE BOOK OF AMERICAN INDIANS. New York: Arco Publishing Co. (144 pp.) A radio and magazine writer, Mr. Raphael "has traced the story of the Indian, presenting in an interesting fashion what most people want to know about the aboriginal Americans," wrote the assistant director of the Bureau of American Ethnology, Frank H. Roberts, Jr., in his brief introduction to this magazine-like presentation. Approximately one half of the booklet is filled with some very good illustrative material, and it contains some equally good gen- eral information: five "culture areas," prehistory, famous chiefs, arts and crafts, and similar material. In the American Anthropologist Robert Ritzenthaler at- tempted to forecast the future of the booklet: "It should appeal," he estimated, "to the Boy Scout trade and those adults who want a quick survey of Indian life."* 1954 Verrill, A. Hyatt. THE REAL AMERICANS. New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons. (309 pp.) Verrill's book is, as he says, "not intended to be a scientific ethnological work but is ,for the purpose of conveying a better knowledge and understanding of our Indians of the United States." In this sense the volume deserves a favorable</page><page sequence="24">102 ARIZONA and the WEST rating; it does offer a broad popularized treatment of the Indian, though without the thoroughness that it could have carried. Indians in the West, in fact, receive a fairly unsubstantial handling. As Ruth Underhill declared in the American An- thropologist, "One can hardly escape the impression that this was a good book about eastern Indians, enlarged for wider appeal but without sufficient data." Yet for the reader only slightly versed in the story of North American Indians, this volume is a helpful one. The author extinguishes numerous pieces of misinforma- tion about the Indian even though the overall treatment is eclectic and some of the information is not altogether reputable. The section comprising brief biog- raphies of famous Indians and a glossary of principal tribes now living in the United States is of some worth for its compilation of data seldom ready to hand to other than specialists. 1955 Roe, Frank Gilbert. THE INDIAN AND THE HORSE. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press. (434 pp.) Roe's volume presents a circuitous examination of literature devoted to interpretation of the impact of the horse and the development of a "horse culture" among certain North American Indian peoples. In the words of the author, it is "an attempt to draw these scattered comparative data together from their various resting places, and to summarize in a conveniently coordinated form the existent evidence - or the main currents of its findings - concerning the impact of this historic horse upon the principal horse-using tribes of the North American continent in the predominating aspects of chronology, geography, and tribal reactions." More expressly, it is an evaluation of the literature since 1914 when Clark Wissler opened the subject with his penetrating essay, "The Influence of the Horse in the Development of Plains Culture" (American Anthropologist, N. S., v. 16, 1914, pp. 1-25). Wissler's conclusion that the horse intensified original Plains traits is ultimately conceded by Roe to be "in every respect as sound as ever." Apart from citing Wissler frequently to defend this secondhand conclu- sion, the author calls on a remarkable trilogy of "experts" in the field of Indian horse culture for further support - James Frank Dobie, Walter Prescott Webb, and Roe himself. Weightily documented, the book does achieve something in its method of historical criticism and in its summaristic analysis of an already ex- pansive literature. 1957 AMERICAN INDIANS AND AMERICAN LIFE. Vol. 311 (May), Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science. (226 pp.) The special issue of this journal offers 165 pages toward a comprehensive accounting on various features of Indian life in the United States through the past and into the immedi- ate present. The ground is covered by means of sixteen essays arranged under four broad categories, which run from a depiction of the historic background through governmental administration of Indian affairs and certain contemporary institutions in Indian life to analyses concerning the acculturation and "integration"</page><page sequence="25">BIBLIOGRAPHY 103 of American Indians. The aim, as expressed by George E. Simpson and J. Milton Yinger who served as editors for this particular issue, "has been a scholarly review of several aspects of Indian life today, not a policy debate." This, however, would appear to be somewhat inescapable; and certain issues are sketched in, not so much as points of policy but rather as points of view. Twenty-one authors are allowed to speak here, three o.f the essays being joint contributions. The majority of the contributors are quite well-known for their publications on Indians and the "place" of Indians - as it has been and may, perhaps, become - in the United States. 1959 Fey, Harold E., and McNickle, D'Arcy. INDIANS AND OTHER AMERICANS: Two Ways of Life Meet. New York: Harper and Brothers. (220 pp.) In this small but informative work Fey and McNickle rehearse the turbulent story of In- dian affairs and attempt to answer several questions, especially the one: "Why has failure so clouded the record of government-Indian relations?" The book is devoted largely to an examination of the infelicitous record of the past hundred years which, according to the authors, makes it obvious that "there has been no admin- istration of Indian affairs deserving of that description until within the last thirty years." The final chapter is something of an argument for the incorporation of anthropological findings into the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and the staffing of that agency with persons who have been trained to work within a culture other than their own. Their polemic, however, is rather naively executed. The question, Fey and McNickle continue to point out, is one of culture; and to date the insistence has been on the Indian's picking up the burden and bringing himself into the white man's world. But the real problem, according to the authors, "is to devise the conditions and to bring to bear the stimuli which will induce the Indian people to adapt their customs, attitudes, and technical skills to the necessities of life in the American community." As something of a corollary to their blueprint for cul- tural schema, the authors speak of the "unfinished task," the "unfulfilled dream" of the Indians that "they will be permitted at last to make the primary decisions affecting their lives and their property."</page></plain_text>
