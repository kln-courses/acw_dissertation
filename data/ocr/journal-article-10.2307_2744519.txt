<plain_text><page sequence="1">On an Unambiguous Upper Paleolithic Carved Male ALICE B. KEHOE Department of Social and Cultural Sciences, Marquette University, P. O. Box 1881, Milwaukee, Wis. 53201-1881, U.S.A. 18 III 96 Neither McDermott nor the commentators on his "Self- Representation in Upper Paleolithic Female Figurines" (CA 37:227-75) seem to have noticed my report in An- tiquity (Kehoe 1991) on the true viewpoint for the "mammiform" pendant from Dolni Vestonice. On the back of the one complete pendant and visible though incomplete on some of the broken ones is a carved sus- pension ring. When a string is passed through this ring and the pendant is allowed to dangle freely, it takes one and only one position, and that position makes the "neck" clearly a penis and the "breasts" clearly a pair of testicles. The Gravettian phallus closely resembles Roman phallic amulets (Green 1976, Turnbull 1978), since like many of these it is quite realistic. Sarah Nelson has re- marked (1990:17) that the "rod with breasts ... could as easily be perceived as stylized male genitalia," and this suggestion is enhanced by the same locality's indu- bitable male genitalia-indubitable once cognizance is taken of the suspension ring and the orientation this produces. Why have archaeologists failed to notice, or publish, the prominent suspension ring on the back of the com- plete Dolni Vestonice pendant? Why can male archaeol- ogists not recognize a straightforward representation of their own genitalia? For that matter, why has a note in the principal international journal for prehistoric ar- chaeology been so overlooked? Will this comment regis- ter, or are the gentlemen so fixated on female sex objects that their memories blank out any challenge to their objects of desire? Reply LEROY D. MCDERMOTT Art Department, Central Missouri State University, Warrensburg, Mo. 64093, U.S.A. 9 V 96 Kehoe's critique continues the tendency of previous commentators to focus on issues peripheral to the autog- enous hypothesis and addresses neither the evidence supporting its formulation nor the interpretive implica- tions of the integration of this previous unexplored fe- male point of view into our study of early image-making behavior. The distinctive way anatomy is represented in Pavlovian, Kostenkian, and Gravettian (PKG)female figurines is the core of the theory that they were created from the point of view of self (McCoid and McDermott 1996, McDermott 1996). The great rarity of male figures is intriguingly consistent with such an origin for female images and does suggest that women could have been uniquely prepared among the genders to play a leading role in middle Upper Paleolithic image making but is not a necessary prediction of the autogenous hypothesis. Kehoe's identification (1991) of the Dolni Vestonice pen- dants as representations of the penis, which I am in- clined to accept but for different reasons, neither com- promises the autogenous hypothesis nor challenges the conclusion of my article and accompanying comments about the paucity of male figures during the middle Up- per Paleolithic. An image of a penis may have been a synecdoche for a whole male (which we can never know), but it is not a representation of a male "figure" in any unambiguous sense. A man today is more than his sex organ, and I question Kehoe's assumption of equivalency during the middle Upper Paleolithic. In addition, I have more than the shadow of a doubt that these pendants are clear, indubitable, and "straight- forward" representations of male genitalia. Admittedly, when suspended by string as Kehoe argues there is a suggestive similarity, but this is far from the photo-</page><page sequence="2">666 1 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY graphic realism necessary to resolve debate. The propor- tional length and width of "penis" to "testicles" differ radically from both human anatomy and the Roman phallic amulets cited by Kehoe (i99i), and neither glans nor meatus is ever suggested in the small shaft or neck. Scrotal asymmetry is also strikingly absent in the Dolni Vestonice pendants. Furthermore, suspension on a string is not the only "sensible" or "parsimonious" use for their perforations, detailed illustrations of which were published by Abso- Ion in I949. I saw no sign of polish in the perforations of the originals to indicate how they were actually worn, and the "suspension ring" could also have served to stitch them onto clothing, for this method was certainly in wide use by this time (White I992, I993). If sewn against a supportive backing the pendants would not have dangled at all in the fashion described by Kehoe and thus with equal logic may have been seen as commonly oriented in the literature. If secured to clothing, it seems logical that the emphatic bilateral symmetry of these pendants could have mirrored the basic anatomical sym- metry characteristic of both breasts and testicles. Cer- tainly the penis and scrotum do not dangle to the side in the asymmetrical fashion seen when these pendants are suspended on a string. Arguments casting doubt on Kehoe's do not disprove that Dolni Vestonice pendants signified male genitalia, but in the absence of an anatomical realism clearly rec- ognizable to different observers there is no reason to choose a male over the equally sensible traditional fe- male interpretation. As I argued in the case of the rod with breasts known as Dolni Vestonice no. 14 (McDer- mott i996), both testicles and breasts may be repre- sented, depending upon its orientation in the observer's visual field. The closeness in form between this latter piece and pendants from the same site likewise argues that both possibilities should continue to be explored. It is possible that the ambiguity of the Dolni Vestonice pendants reflects the intent of their prehistoric creators and not the sexual fixations of either male or female scholarship. At the same time, I share Kehoe's concern with the operation of factors within archaeology which hinder the consideration of often obvious alternative points of view (McCoid and McDermott i996). In conclusion, I applaud Kehoe's use of experiment to discover an alternative angle of regard for the Dolni Vestonice pendants, and although I do not concur with her reinterpretation, like the autogenous hypothesis it calls attention to the critical need to examine our as- sumptions about the angle of regard from which middle Upper Paleolithic imagery was created.
