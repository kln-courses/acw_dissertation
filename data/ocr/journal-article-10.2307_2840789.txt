" I am Sir Oracle," he announces to a more or less credulous public, " and when I ope my lips let no dog bark." The author of the work before me is no exception to this rule. He expects the reader " to cleanse himself, rinse his mouth, " wash his hands, and raise the book three times reverently to his forehead before he " opens it." He must not put it down on the bare mats but on a pure stand with a sheet of paper under it. I am afraid my copy has not been always treated with such reverent care. It is soiled, worn, and dog's-eared. A more serious matter is that of the two volumes of which it consists one is missing. Nevertheless a sufficiently clear idea of its general scope and character is to be obtained from what is left. Divination is of two kinds-the religious, as the Delphian oracle, and the non- religious, exemplified by our chiromancy. In the present work we find a combination of both principles. It has a non-religious basis, which is fortified by the addition of various religious elements. The non-religious principle is that universally recognised in the casting of lots, viz., a belief in the virtue of mere chance. The necessary mechanism consists of a set of 100 divining sticks resemblinig chopsticks. They are about 6 or 7 inches in length, and each bears a number with an inscription in the Chinese character signifying " Great Good Luck," " Small Good Luck," " Bad Luck," "Ultimate Small Good Luck," or "Half Good Luck." The lucky numbers greatly preponderate. These sticks are placed in an oblong box measuring 12 by 4 by 4 inches. It is closed on all sides except for a small hole at the end, which allows only one stick to come out at a time. I have seen a box of this kind which was provided for the use- of visitors to -a Bu-ddhist tem^ple at -ishiyama, near Otsu. It contained twelve sticks only. On drawing one the consulter of the oracle received a slip of paper [ 116 ]</page><page sequence="2">1908.J MAN.

There were no religious concomitants beyond the circumstance that the drawing took place in a temple. The present case is widely different. Here we meet with religion at every step. The title of the book, Kwannon Hiakusen (Kwannon's hundred divining sticks), shows that it is under the patronage of the Chinese Buddhist deity of that name. The preface relates a legend of its introduction from China in the tenth century by a Buddhist dignitary. The practitioner of the art is directed to read a certain Sutra and to repeat " the true words of the eleven-faced, thousand-banded true Kwannon 333 times, " making 33 obeisances." He should have previously cleansed himself and brought his mind and body into unison, putting away from him all doubt. Then follows a long prayer (there is no trace of any compulsion of gods or spirits) to Kwannon to grant a true divination, and a set of Dharanis (invocations in the Sanskrit language). After these preliminaries he should raise the box reverently three times to his forehead and shake a stick from it. Two pages of the book are allotted to each stick. A stanza of four lines of Chinese poetry occupies a conspicuous position, and is referred to as the truly authoritative part of the work. This feature has every appearance of a Chinese origin and is probably very much older than the Japanese expansion, which latter, in the absence of more precise information, may be assigned to the latter part of the 18th century. The Chinese verses are rather cryptic and contain no appreciable religious element. The first stanza, corresponding to a stick marked "Great Good Luck," runs as follows The pagoda, built of the seven precious things, Rests on the summit of the high peak; All men look up to it with awe, Let there be no neglectful glances. Here is a foreboding of ill luck: The household path has not reached prosperity, But is exposed to danger and disaster, Dark clouds obscure the moon-cassia-tree, Let the fair one burn a stick of incense. The real business of prophesying begins when the Japanese author proceeds to give definition and substance to the misty generalities of his Chinese text. According to him the first of the above-quoted verses implies that the person who draws the corresponding stick will, if a Samurai or retainer, receive great promotion and be made a general or a captain. He will be envied by his comrades and find favour in the eyes of his lord. But imprudence may lead to disaster. The Buddhist priest will become an incumbent of a temple, or will be granted official rank. He will find liberal patrons or obtain a good chief image. A woman will marry above her station, or if she is already married her husband will have a sudden rise in the world. She will have clever male children. Employes will do their duty towards their masters, and will become foremen or will get gain. Pupils will share the prosperity of their teacbers. But if they are not careful evil results will follow. Let there be no negligence. Merchants will find a sale for their goods in desirable quarters, and will be greatly favoured, gaining much money by their influence. But if they go too far the unexpected will overtake them. If a nobleman's yashiki is their regular customer they will receive great good fortune from it. Similar good fortune is predicted for players and peasants. The sick man will recover, but his illness will be a long one. Prayer and a good doctor are recommended. The person who is expected will arrive, though somewhat late. The lawsuit will be decided favourably. The lost article will be found after a time. [ 117 ]</page><page sequence="3">No. 64.) MAN. [1908. In quarrels and disputes there will be victory. The time is good for building a house, for a removal, for shaving a boy's head (on reaching puberty), for a marriage, and for starting on a journey. Buy freely, there will be great profit soon. The drawer of the unlucky No. 5 will, if a Samurai, be unfortunate if he does not exercise the greatest self-restraint. The Ronin will find no opening for employment. The retainer will be discharged, or at least be reproved by his chief. But if he is patient all will come right in the end. The Buddhist priest will remain in studious penury. He may be a man with a future before him, but he will meet with misfortune. But if he perseveres, avoiding greed- and revering the Kami and sBuddhas, all will be well in the end. A woman will make a bad marriage and find everything unsatisfactory. Sqhe will be unable to rear her children and will soon become a widow. These are the commonplaces of the soothsaying fraternity everywhere. A greater interest attaches to the counsels given to the consulter of the oracle as to his religious conduct. They afford an insioht into the state of religion in Japan at this period, especially among the lower classes of the population. The author himself was not much of a scholar. He was probably a Buddhist priest, but the deities whose worship he recommends form a very heterogeneous assemblage. They comprise the Buddhas, the gods of old Indian myth, certaiii gods of Chinese origin affiliated to Buddhism, the " Heaven " of Confucius, and the deities of Shinto. The tolerance or laxity which permits and even enjoins the practice of such conflicting forms of faith is not peculiar to, our author. It is characteristic of the nation to which he belongs. The fundamental unity of Buddhism, Confucianism, and Shinto is a favourite theme of Japanese writers on religion. It may be observed that whether Buddhistn, as taught by its founder, is or is not an atheistic religion-if there be such a -thing-1-the modern Buddhism of Japan has plenty of deities. Besides such extraneous go(ds as Kwannon, the Buddhas themselves are regarded as Kami. This very treatise associates these two classes of deities frequently under the term Shimbutsu (Kami and Buddhas) as objects of a joint adoration. Each section of the book has a clause in which the drawer of the number to which it belongs is recommended a selection of one or mfore gods in which he should put special faith. Among these two are much the most prominent, viz., Kwannon and Tento. Kwannon, according to Eitel's Chinese Buddhism, is "a Chinese female deity, probably an ancient local goddess of mercy, worshlpped -in China before " the advent of Buddhism under the name Kwanyin, and adopted by Buddhists as an incarnation of Avalokites' vara (or Padmapanpi)." She is very popular in Japan. Tento or tendo is a word of Chinese derivation, anrd means Heaven-path. Originally it was no doubt substantially equivalent to Ten, Heaven, which in ChinsA fluctuates a good deal between " the material sky," " Nature," "the eternal principle of right,"# and "God." Perhaps "Law of Nature and Right" represents the idea whieh the more highly educated Japanese attach to Tento. But this is much too abstract for the unenlightened vulgar to whom this book is addressed. To them Tento is the sun --not merely the actual sun in the sky, but the material sun, considered as a living i eingr, possessing moral attributes, hearing prayer, punishing vice, and rewarding virtue. That therb is a definite personification of Tento as the sun is shown by-the fact that it has usually the respectful particle o prefixed to it, and the word sama (Sir) appended. Especially in the mouths of women and children the sun is at this day 0-Tento-Sama, the more philosophical meaning of the word being wholly unknown to them. Though Tento is to some extent anthropopathic, it is not anthropomorphic. It has no sex, no myth, no temples or idols, and no priests for its service. It is nevertheless a popular divinity, marking a reversion to a more primitive and concrete conceptioin of deity. One of the illustrations in the Book of Divination shows a * Compare the Greek nomnos, which was also deifiel. [ 118 ]</page><page sequence="4">1908.] MAN. [No. 64. Japanese in ceremonial costume kneeling in the open air in front of his houise with a small table before him on which is burningp a stick of incense in honour of Tento. The suIn is seen breaking from behind a mass of cloud (Fig. 1). The drawers of other numbers are counselled to put their trust in the sun (hi) and moon (tsutki) sans phrase, and to follow the custom of sitting up at night ready to greet the rising of the luminary with devout prayer and obeisance. Shimmei (divine splendour) is frequently menitioned. This term sometimes includes the whole pantheon of Shinto deities. It is, however, more especially used of the two great gods of Ise, viz., the sun-goddess and the food-goddess, and may even be restricted to the sun-goddess only. Probably it is in this last sense that we are to understand it here. To the modern Japanese, Tenshodaijin (the sun-goddess) no longer suggests the sun. They do not identify her with Tento. To theni she is the mighty deity of Ise, the ancestor of the Imperial dynasty and the Great Providence that guards Japan. Ji-matsuri (earth-worship) is recommended in connection with the building of a house. This is a primitive form of worship. The earth is the ground itself. It is not in the least anthropomorphic, and but faintly anthropopathic. It has no sex, and being a concrete object itself, has no need of an idol or other material token of the presence of divinity. Hachiman is a very popu- lar god in Japan. He is now recognised as a god of war, but his real origin and functions are unknown. He partakes of the character of a Shinto and a Buddhist deity. Benten, or Benzaiten, one of the Japanese " seven gods of good-fortune," is a female deity of Iiidian origin. Bishamon (Vaisramana), another of the same group of deities, is one of the Tcliatur Maharaja or "Fotur Heavenly Kings " of Ilidian myth. It is doubtful whether Daikoku, also a god of good fortune, is of Indian or Shinto origin. Fud5 and Marishiten are Indian deities who have found their way to Japan in company with Buddhism. Atago, the Shinto god of fire, is recommended for worship in some cases. The Ujigami is the patron Shinto deity of a man's birthplace. K6shin is a deification of that day of the month which corresponds to the fifty-seventh term of the Chinese sexagenary cycle. In addition to the worship of the particular deities above enumerated, ouir author enjoins on his clients the adoration of the Kami and Buddhas generally. He also advises them to read the Daihanya, a collection of sixteen Sutras expounding the philosophy of the Mahayana school. Ancestor-worship is nowhere mentioned. The term shinriki (divine power) occurs frequently in this treatise. The standard native dictioniary, the Kotoba no Idzumi, says that this word is a contraction for skintsuiriki (divine penetrative or pervasive power), which is defined as "the power " of unconditioned action like that of the gods, such as to pass over the clouds V - V FIG. 1. [ 11.9 ]</page><page sequence="5">No. 64.) MAN. [1908. (levitation), to raise the wind, to ride on a crane or dragon." To this may be added the power of making oneself invisible. There is a story of a possessor of this faculty, who, on one of his aerial flights, allowed his gaze to rest too ardently on a pretty girl, who, with her skirts tuicked up, was trampling clothes in a wash-tub by a river side. He lost his tsiiriki, and tumbled down to earth in consequence. Our author's shinriki is different fronm this. In cases of illness he frequently advises the patient or his friends "'to take shinriki" or to raise up shinriki, anid pray to Tento or to the Kami and Buddhas. Here shinriki is evidently that power which is invoked in faith- healing, still practised in Japan by some Shinto sects. Shinriki will do more than this. After enumerating the difficulties portended to a mnerchant who has drawn the doubtful number forty-one, our author adds, " But if the Buddlhas and Kami are prayed to withl " shinriki, there will be some alleviation." Under another number a Buddhist priest is advised to practise secret good works with shinriki. Again, we are told that " shinariki " will be useless without a protector." May we not translate shinriki simply by "faith" ? As used by our author, it is plainly something more than the miraculous powers which the Japanese, in imitation of the Chinese Taoists, attribute to their magicians. We are here on the margin of that borderland, the X-country for which we are still in expectation of a guide to tell us " Quid possit oriri Quid nequeat, finita potestas denique cuique Quanam sit ratione, atque alte terminuis haerens." More than once the consulter of the oracle is advised, in case of sickniess, "to " have recourse to a great doctor and a kitoja " (professional prayer-man); as we might say, a consulting physician and a Christian Scieutist. At Osaka, many years ago, nly attenition was drawn to a droning sound which proceeded from the servants' quarters of our consulate in that city. On enquiry, I learned that a kitoja was reciting prayers for the recovery of a sick man. The result was a failure. Perhaps the officiating person had not sufficiently realised that a stricture was unlikely to yield to this mode of treatment. Our own kitoja sometimes make similar mistakes. There is an abundance of excellent, if rather obvious, advice in this treatise, anid a high moral tone reigns throughout. Thus an artisan who has drawn the unlucky No. 7 is advised, if lie would avert the calamities predicted for him, to keep an honest heart, to be patient and prudent in all things, arid to put his faith in the Kami and Buddhas. We frequently meet with the proviso that if a wicked man draws a good number it will be of no use to him. Things will in his case turn out quite different from the predictions. The sick man who draws a lucky number will recover; if he is a bad man he will die. If the mercllant has two concubines in additioni to his proper wife, he will have a succession of misfortunes. The priest who forgets his vows will lose his living and become a wanderer. The Samurai who is infatuated for women will be disgraced, but lie who practises bushido (the rule of conduct becoming an officer and gentleman) zealously will receive promotion. In cases of life aiid death, the coward will die, while he who grudges not his life will save it. Prudence, patience, and circum- spect conduct are frequently inculcated. Cowardice, greed, injustice, and indolence will niullify the advantages portended by a good inumber. In quarrels you will win if you have right on your side, otherwise you will be beaten. Is it uncharitable to suggest that, in addition to the satisfaction which he derives from his ex-cathedra position as a teacher of high morality', the soothsayer is not sorry to provide himself with a loophole of escape wheni the event is in too flaorant contradiction with his prophlcies ? In case of complaint he can always throw the blame on the unsatisfactory moral coindition of the complainanit. W. G. AS T O N. [ 120 ]</page></plain_text>
