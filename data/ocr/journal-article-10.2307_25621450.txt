Wesleyan University 2010 ISSN: 0018-2656 SUBJECTIVITY AS A NON-TEXTUAL STANDARD OF INTERPRETATION IN THE HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHICAL PSYCHOLOGY JARI KAUKUA AND VILI LAHTEENMAKI ABSTRACT Contemporary caution against anachronism in intellectual history, and the currently mo mentous theoretical emphasis on subjectivity in the philosophy of mind, are two prevailing conditions that set puzzling constraints for studies in the history of philosophical psychol ogy. The former urges against assuming ideas, motives, and concepts that are alien to the historical intellectual setting under study, and combined with the latter suggests caution in relying on our intuitions regarding subjectivity due to the historically contingent charac terizations it has attained in contemporary philosophy of mind. In the face of these condi tions, our paper raises a question of what we call non-textual (as opposed to contextual) standards of interpretation of historical texts, and proceeds to explore subjectivity as such a standard. Non-textual standards are defined as (heuristic) postulations of features of the world or our experience of it that we must suppose to be immune to historical variation in order to understand a historical text. Although the postulation of such standards is often so obvious that the fact of our doing so is not noticed at all, we argue that the problems in certain special cases, such as that of subjectivity, force us to pay attention to the methodo logical questions involved. Taking into account both recent methodological discussion and the problems inherent in two de facto denials of the relevance of subjectivity for historical theories, we argue that there are good grounds for the adoption of subjectivity as a non textual standard for historical work in philosophical psychology. Keywords: anachronism, historical reconstruction, intellectual history, philosophical psy chology, rational reconstruction, Quentin Skinner, standards of interpretation, subjectivity I. INTRODUCTION Emphatic caution against anachronism in contemporary intellectual history on the one hand, and the singularly close attention to subjectivity in contemporary philosophy on the other, are two prevailing circumstances that set puzzling con straints for studies in the history of philosophical psychology. Together these cir cumstances call for a heightened awareness of our own interpretive presupposi tions as historians. The former urges against assuming ideas, motives, or concepts that may be alien to the historical setting under study. Combined with the latter it suggests particular caution in relying on our intuitions regarding subjectivity due to the specific, historically contingent characterizations subjectivity has received in the contemporary philosophy of mind. In the face of these conjoined forces, our paper explores subjectivity as what we shall call a non-textual standard of</page><page sequence="2">22 JARI KAUKUA AND VILI LAHTEENMAKI historical interpretation. As will be made clear in the forthcoming, by "non-tex tual standards" we mean suppositions that interpreters of a historical text have to make in order to secure the general intelligibility of the text under study. These standards pick out aspects of experience that provide a minimal area of com mon ground shared by interpreters and the historical author, regardless of whether these aspects are explicitly addressed in the text under study. We will start section II with a general consideration of the standards for the plausibility of historical reconstructions of past philosophical theories. In sec tion III we will ask whether texts, both the primary sources expressing a past theory and other texts that provide their immediate context, can suffice as exclu sive guides to understanding the theory. We will thereby introduce the notion of non-textual standards of plausibility and argue for the necessity of adopting some such standards in all historical work. Section IV shifts the focus by providing an analysis of the complex bundle of phenomena, problems, and definitions in the guise of which subjectivity appears in contemporary discussions in the philoso phy of mind. We will claim that even though it is perfectly natural to believe that this bundle is a contingent historical formation, even a fairly recent one, the case is not quite as straightforward with some of the elementary phenomena constitu tive of it. This analysis will be followed in section V by a critical discussion of two examples of the denial of subjectivity in a historical theory. We suggest that it is precisely a peculiar combination of the emphasized caution against anachronism and the recent abundance of specific determinations of subjectivity that underpin these denials. Finally, section VI will bring the different strands together to a conclusion that proposes the adoption of subjectivity?under the qualifications introduced in the course of the paper?as a non-textual standard of plausibility for the historical reconstruction of ideas. II. HISTORICAL RECONSTRUCTION AND ITS STANDARDS OF PLAUSIBILITY In his seminal 1969 article "Meaning and Understanding in the History of Ideas," Quentin Skinner set out to expose fundamental methodological problems in two then dominant approaches to the history of ideas, the non-contextual and the con textual. The two approaches were symmetrically opposed to each other with re gard to the question of whether knowledge of a given text's historical context of origin is needed in interpreting that text. The non-contextual approach took the history of ideas to be about either consulting the timeless classics and their peren nial wisdom on eternal questions of philosophy, or alternatively about charting the course from one historical context to another of doctrines, questions, or theses that transcend their immediate contexts. The adherents of the former would claim, either explicitly or implicitly, that historical study is to be pursued by simply looking at what the texts say. The immediate historical context of the text could therefore be regarded as irrelevant. Indeed, contextual explanation of a classic text might even be downright harmful insofar as it focuses our attention on deter minants of the text that threaten its perennial value. On the other hand, the latter, with its aim to chart the historical course of a given doctrine, will have to neglect the haphazard additions entirely dependent on the contingent interests of particu</page><page sequence="3">SUBJECTIVITY AS A NON-TEXTUAL STANDARD OF INTERPRETATION 23 lar historical contexts, and penetrate to the unchanging theoretical core in each thinker that we conceive as a historical instantiator of a transhistorical idea.1 Skinner claims that this emphasis of the non-contextual approach on the inde pendence of historical texts from their contexts entails a number of suspect beliefs that he denigratingly calls "mythologies."2 These mythologies can come in vari ous versions and complexes, but the common denominator of them all is that they can be rightly accused of anachronism. By refusing to consider the historical texts in any other light than that supposedly provided by the text itself, interpreters un knowingly end up projecting their own notions onto the text and thereby become blind to significant alien features in the text, reducing the text to a simple likeness, often deficient, of the preferred strands of thought of their own time. As a correc tive against such dangers, Skinner put forward a contextual approach centered on the idea of historical reconstruction?as opposed to the rational reconstruction of the criticized non-contextual approach?of the thought of past thinkers, in order to overcome the overtly strong assimilative tendencies of much earlier scholarship and to bring to the fore genuine conceptual change as the central object of study in the history of ideas. The main idea behind this corrective was that our interpretive activity should take its cue from options of thought that would have been acces sible for the historical thinkers themselves. Skinner expressed this corrective in a subsequently oft-quoted principle that epitomizes his contextual approach: [N]o agent can eventually be said to have meant or done something which he could never be brought to accept as a correct description of what he had meant or done_[This special authority of an agent over his intentions excludes the possibility] that an acceptable account of an agent's behavior could ever survive the demonstration that it was itself dependent on the use of criteria of description and classification not available to the agent himself.3 Although Skinner himself rarely uses the term, we will hardly deviate from his intent if we take his claim to be that interpretations of historical texts that fail to comply with the above principle are anachronistic. Historical sensitivity that is wary of anachronism thus involves a heightened awareness of differences be tween our own conceptual possibilities and those of the historical authors. It also entails emphasis on the contingent theoretical and argumentative interests that historical authors assume from their contingent historical context. Skinner's critique of the non-contextual approach has subsequently enjoyed rather wide approval. Indeed, one may even venture to claim that sensitivity to and emphasis on historical contingency has become the leading paradigm in the history of ideas. It has been acknowledged, just as Skinner claimed, that con 1. Q. Skinner, "Meaning and Understanding in the History of Ideas," History and Theory 8 (1969), 4-39. 2. Skinner enumerates three such mythologies. The most persistent of these is the mythology of doctrines, which amounts to the expectation that "each classic writer will be found to enunciate some doctrine on each of the topics regarded as constitutive of his subject" or the belief that all historical authors in a given field will aim at a clear formulation of a given (perennial) doctrine or an answer to a given (perennial) problem. The other mythologies are "the mythology of prolepsis" (confusion of authors' intentions with their reception history) and "the mythology of parochialism" (unwarranted observation of similarities between the thought of a historical author and certain strands of thought in our own time). See ibid., 30-38, 43-49. 3. Ibid., 28-29.</page><page sequence="4">24 JARI KAUKUA AND VILI LAHTEENMAKI text-sensitive historical reconstruction is able to accentuate differences between historical and contemporary views where proponents of non-contextual rational reconstruction have often simply seen instances of the same. Apprehension of differences instead of myopic assertions of sameness has become the form of knowledge specific to the history of ideas in general and the history of philosophy in particular, and it is widely believed that this is the way in which the latter can, in a manner quite particular to it, provide genuine philosophical impetus for con temporary discussion. But Skinner's principle does not square with a simple-minded contextualist ap proach either. In fact, straightforward contextualism, or the view that the history of ideas is about explaining historical texts by means of their generative contexts, was the other approach at which he targeted his critique. Knowledge of the con text does of course help in understanding the text, but this is not to say that the text should be explained by means of the context, in the sense that a contextual account would give not only the necessary but also the sufficient causal conditions for the genesis of a given text. Texts are actions in contexts, and knowledge of the context is a necessary feature of an account of such an action. But if understand ing an action entails understanding the intentional aim of the agent, this must be a constituent of the historical account as well. Skinner's qualifications to the contextualist methodology are perfectly sound. But it is important to point out that in the end they do not amount to a rejection of the contextualist methodology. On the contrary, our sole access to the range of possible intentions of a historical author is still argued to go through a contextual understanding of the possible variations in meaning of the author's sentences.4 Equally, we can grasp the author's intention, his point in writing the text, only by means of the general context in which he wrote.5 Now, we take it to be quite obvious that, just as Skinner emphasizes, a text is never endowed with a sufficient set of keys to its understanding. Some of the required addenda may seem trivial; for instance, we have to understand the lan guage in which the text is written. This involves at least an elementary grasp of the different possible uses of the verbal material of the text, as well as a rough idea of the extensions of the concepts in use. This, in turn, requires that we are aware of the range of conceptual systems the historical author had access to and would likely have resorted to. Concepts and conceptual systems, for their part, always come loaded with various theoretical and practical interests and emphases, as well as inherited problematics that one also has to be aware of in order to understand a text in a historically grounded way. Such keys to understanding are common 4. Cf. ibid., 40. 5. Ibid., 48-49. A view very much akin to Skinner's is put forward by Michael Frede, who makes a further distinction, especially relevant for historians of philosophy, between the narrow context of the philosophy of the time and the wide context that includes all even remotely relevant features of contemporaneous culture. He claims that a historian of philosophy seeks to study his subject by a strongly emphasized reference to the narrow context, much as a philosopher will try to give philo sophically sound reasons for his views and not appeal to, for instance, polls or his own idiosyncratic preferences. Frede also makes a corresponding distinction between internal and external histories of philosophies. See M. Frede, "The History of Philosophy as a Discipline," Journal of Philosophy 85 (1988), 666-672.</page><page sequence="5">SUBJECTIVITY AS A NON-TEXTUAL STANDARD OF INTERPRETATION 25 knowledge of all historians working in the general field to which the text belongs, and as such they can be called the standards by which the plausibility of a histori an's interpretation of the text is assessed. As various as such standards may be, they all have one thing in common: they are normally considered to be textual. In this regard Skinner's characterization of the historian's work as a "linguistic enterprise" is particularly telling. The stand ards are textual in the sense that in the ideal case at least they have an explicit foundation in other texts, either older or contemporary, that the author of the text under study is likely to have perused or that are particularly illustrative of the set of beliefs or concepts on which he or she would likely have relied. But does a combination of contextual and textual standards suffice to bring about a histori cally founded reconstruction of a text's meaning? Do not all texts also have im mediate non-textual surroundings as well? Although it is obvious that we do not have access to these surroundings as historians?since they are non-textual by definition, there can be no documents of them?can we thereby rule them out as possible standards for our work? Could there not also be non-textual standards that limit the range of possible meanings of a historical utterance? III. NON-TEXTUAL STANDARDS OF PLAUSIBILITY As a tentative characterization of what we mean by non-textual standards for the plausibility of interpretations of historical texts, let it be said that they are often quite innocent features of the world of our experience that we must suppose, in order to make sense of a historical text, to be common to or shared by ourselves and the authors with whom we are occupied. Furthermore, insofar as they are shared, they can also be called ahistorical?'m a heuristic or methodological sense?since they are not subject to historical change or variation. And last, they are non-textual in the sense that we do not suppose them on the basis of any tex tual evidence. To get a clearer idea of the notion it is best to witness such standards in action. Let us have a look at a passage from the fourth book of Aristotle's Physics: [T]hings that are thrown move, though that which gave them their impulse is not touching them, either by reason of mutual replacement, as some maintain, or because the air that has been pushed pushes them with a movement quicker than the natural locomotion of the projectile wherewith it moves to its proper place. But in a void none of these things can take place, nor can anything be moved save as that which is carried is moved.6 The passage forms part of a series of arguments that Aristotle presents against the existence of the void. The gist of the argument is that certain everyday phe nomena related to motion would become profoundly problematic if we held that motion really does take place in a void. Now, understanding the passage naturally requires that we consider it carefully in its immediate argumentative context, that we read it in the light of both Aristotle's general argumentative aims in the chap ter, and the specific Aristotelian notions that figure in the passage, such as his 6. Ar. Phys. IV.8, 215al4-23; transl. R. P. Hardie and R.K. Gaye in The Complete Works of Aristotle: The Revised Oxford Translation, ed. J. Barnes (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1984), I.</page><page sequence="6">26 JARI KAUKUA AND VILI LAHTEENMAKI peculiar conception of the void or the idea of objects having a natural location based on their material constitution. It also requires awareness of the general and specific concerns and interests of prior and contemporary natural philosophy in relation to which Aristotle presents his account. And to get a grasp of Aristotle's intention in saying what he does say, we have to have, among many other things, at least an elementary understanding of the framework he conceived for the whole of the sciences, of his idea of the starting points and methods of procedure proper to each science, and of the status of physics in that framework. We may not always explicitly trace the foundations of these interpretive standards in the original texts, but we do assume there to be such a textual foundation that could be exposed should a need occur to do so. Yet understanding the passage still requires something that is so obvious that we rarely pause to think about it and that is unlikely to be found in any text: we have to know how projectiles actually behave in the real world that both Aristotle and we as Aristotle's readers inhabit. Aristotle makes no effort to describe this behavior, and it is only natural to assume that the omission of such a description is due to the unvoiced presupposition that each and every one of his readers will know from his or her own experience what the behavior is like. Indeed, were Ar istotle to undertake such an express description, he would risk appearing pedantic to the point of ridicule. Still, this very trivial piece of knowledge regarding the world is crucial for the text's having meaning in the first place, for its being about something real, and in this sense it is a standard for the plausibility of any inter pretation of it. It is something that we have to suppose to be common to both us and Aristotle as well as something immune to historical variation. Now, as trivial as the supposition of the behavior of projectiles may seem, it helps to highlight an important point: it is precisely due to its seeming triviality, its blatant obviousness, that the supposition is unlikely to have either a textual basis or contextual basis. Thus, although we may never come to pay attention to the fact, we are bound to rely in our interpretations on a number of suppositions that do not find any direct support in the texts we work with. Were these supposi tions brought to our attention, we would consider them obvious, even trivial. If a historian were expected to bracket all beliefs of his or her own regarding the world and always to reconstruct the view of the historical author entirely from scratch, the views of the historical authors would most likely be, even in the best case, extremely fragmentary and thereby verge on the incomprehensible. It thus makes no sense to avoid relying on what we have called non-textual standards of plausi bility. On the contrary, we should simply be aware of the fact that the supposition of some common or shared ground between us and the objects of our study is necessary for any understanding to arise. As historians we are rarely dealing with cultures completely alien to our own, much less with life-forms fundamentally different from ourselves. To better illustrate our notion of non-textual standards, let us consider three remarks by prominent historians of philosophy and science that are relevant to our topic. (1) As a critical point of caution against the most stringent applications of Skinner's principle, Simo Knuuttila has emphasized the role that our own con cepts play in interpreting those of the historical authors. It is a simple matter of</page><page sequence="7">SUBJECTIVITY AS A NON-TEXTUAL STANDARD OF INTERPRETATION 27 fact that in setting out to examine, say, Plato's concept of justice we have to take our cue from our own intuitions of what justice could conceivably be, for were we to start from a completely clean slate, we would have no means of singling out the passages relevant to our topic from the Platonic corpus in its entirety. Such a preliminary classification will provide us with a rough assortment of materials, and subsequent work with these texts will then yield Plato's account of justice (which, of course, may turn out to be in stark contrast to the intuitions from which we started). But our own intuitions are important in the final stage of the study as well, for understanding the contrast between our and Plato's account of justice is part and parcel of the historical understanding of Plato's account.7 Thus, it is clear that historical work is not even conceivable without at least some basis in our own thoughts on the topics of historical authors we wish to study. The difference between Knuuttila's account of contemporary intuitions and our concept of non-textual standards is that, while both are beliefs that interpreters hold and that are crucial starting points for historical study, non-textual standards, unlike the kind of intuitions Knuuttila speaks about, are not expected to stand in contrast to the beliefs of the historical author. On the contrary, they are expected to provide a minimal area of shared ground that enables us to come to prelimi nary grips with the texts we are studying. They may not always be particularly relevant from the point of view of the results of a study, but whether or not their role has been explicitly acknowledged, they will have been important in making that result possible in the first place. Thus, even if historical understanding were in the end about the difference between two views, those of the historical author and our own, some common ground is always needed to bring up and to articulate this difference. (2) In an early paper on Plato's epistemology Jaakko Hintikka ascribed to the history of philosophy the task of answering the question of why historical authors thought the way they did, of understanding their course of thought, as alien as it may strike us at first glance. Hintikka thought that this task could be met by unearthing culturally shared presuppositions that are common to the majority of the historical authors of a given era and that lead their thought on a course fun damentally different from our own, but that none of them necessarily ever comes to articulate explicitly, and that therefore are for the most part tacitly, even un consciously, held.8 To take an example of such a tacit presupposition from a later paper, Hintikka understood certain peculiar features of Aristotelian logic and epis temology to be due to the implicit conviction that temporally indefinite sentences are paradigmatic expressions of human knowledge: "[Aristotle] takes this mode of thought as the only natural one, without even becoming quite clear of the alter natives it might have and certainly without ever articulating the alternatives."9 7. S. Knuuttila, "Hintikka's View of the History of Philosophy," in The Philosophy of Jaakko Hintikka, ed. R. E. Auxier and L. E. Hahn (Peru, IL: Open Court, 2006), 94-97. 8. J.

Hintikka, "Time, Truth, and Knowledge in Aristotle and Other Greek Philosophers," in Hintikka, Knowledge and the Known, 51.</page><page sequence="8">28 JARI KAUKUA AND VILI LAHTEENMAKi Insofar as Aristotle takes the paradigmatic role of temporally indefinite sen tences to be so obvious that he is not thereby aware of subscribing to a presup position (instead of a brute necessity), it can be asked with due reason whether by ascribing to him such a presupposition we violate Skinner's principle and thus lapse into anachronism. Were we to ask Aristotle whether he holds the presup position he might answer with an immediate affirmative; but can we really say that he has understood the question if he does not, as we who ask the question do, conceive of alternatives to the presupposition? Does not understanding the question therefore require a perspective that goes beyond the immediate ancient context, that is the perspective of the contemporary historian of philosophy? Yet Hintikka's unearthing of the presupposition from the texts not only of Aristotle, but also of many of his contemporaries, such as Plato and the Stoic logicians, is not obviously anachronistic; rather, it seems to be a quite indispensable tool for understanding those features of Aristotle's thought that are alien to our views, and for thereby becoming better aware of ourselves as subscribing to a different set of presuppositions. There is a sense in which such culturally shared presuppositions are similar to the kind of beliefs we refer to as non-textual standards of interpretation. Were we to ask Aristotle about his view of the behavior of projectiles, he might give a polite description of it while completely missing the point in answering the ques tion. The difference, of course, is that whereas we do not share Aristotle's cultural presuppositions, and are thereby able to conceive a point in asking whether he subscribes to them, we share with him the beliefs concerning the behavior of projectiles and would be at equal pains with him to grasp the point in a request to describe that behavior in detail. Indeed, instead of being culturally shared, the non-textual standards should be conceived as universally shared, or shared by a culture we ourselves are defined by, within the bounds of the interpretation of the historical text. We do not so much hold them as beliefs as consider them facts that we see no reason to question; indeed, showing them to be mere presupposi tions would amount to stepping outside the borders of our own context both as philosophers and as historians. Another difference between non-textual standards and Hintikka's culturally shared presuppositions is that while arguments for the existence of the latter are based on the general context?other texts, philosophi cal or otherwise, from the same general cultural milieu that all express the tacit presupposition in various ways?non-textual standards, on the contrary, by defini tion need not be argued for by means of texts. They are the elementary common ground we share with past thinkers. (3) One of the central lines of division among historians of science is that be tween realists and constructionists concerning the question of whether the phe nomena discovered by the sciences are ahistorically there in the world or whether they are historically contingent in the sense that they can be said to genuinely come into being when they are discovered (or construed) by means of histori cally contingent theoretical concerns and methods of investigation. In relation to this question Ian Hacking has spoken of the creation of natural phenomena, with</page><page sequence="9">SUBJECTIVITY AS A NON-TEXTUAL STANDARD OF INTERPRETATION 29 cases such as the discovery of the Hall effect in 1879 as a paradigmatic exam ple.10 Hacking's aim is to fit together the reality of natural phenomena and their independence from particular scientific theories, on the one hand, and the fact that some such phenomena would most likely never have come into being were it not for the highly contingent circumstances in scientific laboratories, on the other. The ensuing project of historical ontology "is concerned with objects or their effects which do not exist in any recognizable form until they are objects of scientific study."11 Such objects provide an illuminative counterpoint to the phenomena at issue in our notion of non-textual standards. Concepts play an important role in the determination of haphazard varieties of phenomenal data into strictly defined phenomena in a strong sense, which can subsequently have all kinds of functions in scientific or philosophical theories. Indeed, the defined phenomena can be said to be historically contingent and dependent on the concepts and theories in which they figure. But the phenomenal data on which the strictly defined phenomena are based can be conceived to exist without any specific conceptual attention to them. It is on this level of largely undetermined but potentially determinable data that our non-textual standards abide. Non-textual standards of plausibility are therefore characterized by a certain vagueness or imprecision in the sense that they do not necessarily come to be sharply determined objects of explicit theoretical consideration, although they may have an effect on such considerations as something that is simply taken for granted or not in need of elucidation. When they do have a role to play in scientific or philosophical problems, as explananda or explanantia, they come into sharper focus. In such cases they are likely to be determined by a series of distinctions and to become objects of explicit descriptions, and the phenomena arrived at by means of such distinctions and descriptions are quite indubitably historically con tingent. But it is much more problematic to assume that the data underlying such explicit interest are historically contingent. Apart from the trivial example of the behavior of projectiles, what non-textual standards should a historian of philosophy or science adopt? We are, of course, not willing to propose any ready-made sets of such standards that should be applied once and for all for any future study. On the contrary, what is relied on as a non textual standard is radically dependent on the themes and questions respective to each study. Thus, the ahistoricality of the non-textual standards is an essentially heuristic or methodological idea. The ahistorical common ground on which one study bases its understanding of a text may be argued to be contingent and subject to historical variation by another study. The borderline between the historical and the ahistorical can perhaps always be redrawn in yet unimaginable ways, but each illuminative new tracing of the borderline is in turn yielded by non-textual starting points that are necessarily left on the side of the ahistorical. 10. See, for instance, I. Hacking, Historical Ontology (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2002), 14-16. Hacking has repeatedly pursued a middle way between the most rigorous realist and constructionist positions. A similar approach is Lorraine Daston's project of applied metaphysics or historical epistemology. For a brief outline of the approach, see L. Daston, "The Coming into Being of Scientific Objects," in Biographies of Scientific Objects, ed. L. Daston (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2000), 1-14. 11. Hacking, Historical Ontology, 11.</page><page sequence="10">30 JARI KAUKUA AND VILI LAHTEENMAKI While all non-textual standards of plausibility are obvious in the sense that they are easily perceived persistent features available to us in our experience of the world, perhaps most of them are also simple in the sense that they are relatively easy to define. In any case, most of the time they pose no considerable problems for interpreting historical texts. Subjectivity, however, is a notoriously evasive notion and thus liable to muddle historical interpretation. Far from simple, it can be and has been argued to consist of a variety of features the mutual dependence or independence of which is a highly controversial issue. We now move on to discuss the complex bundle of phenomena, problems, and definitions in the garb of which subjectivity usually appears in contemporary philosophical debates, and we will thereby tentatively suggest in which sense subjectivity is not dependent on these debates and should be adopted as a non-textual standard. IV. SUBJECTIVITY: PHENOMENON, PROBLEM, DEFINITION We are interested primarily in the phenomenal basis of subjectivity. More spe cifically, we do not want to argue for the ahistoricality of the specific sense and function that it has in contemporary philosophical discussion, that is, as the as pect of the mental that most stubbornly resists reduction to a physicalist descrip tion. When taken as a non-textual standard of plausibility, subjectivity refers to the generic feature of all experience that is often named "what-it-is-likeness" or "first-personal givenness." To maintain the distinction between subjectivity as a phenomenon and subjectivity as a problem, we should keep the characterization of the phenomenal basis relatively broad and not strive for anything more specific. In contemporary naturalist theories of mind, subjectivity occupies a central place as a problem of distinction, but as a phenomenon it is neither confined to this discussion nor does it originate in it. We are concerned with the phenomenon that may or may not come to have such a specific role, and to substantiate this distinc tion between phenomena and their theoretical roles we want to point attention to the fact that at first glance the existence of this phenomenon seems self-evident, regardless of the ontological status we subsequently want to assign to it. There is a fair amount of disagreement about the constitutive features of sub jectivity. Yet it is something of a commonplace to follow Thomas Nagel's turn of phrase that a state qualifies as subjective if there is "something it is like" for a being to be in that state.12 One part of the contemporary discussion revolves around the problem of pinpointing the phenomena that count as subjective. For in stance, it is a matter of debate whether subjectivity presupposes mental objects of a special kind or involves inexpressible qualitative features. For present purposes, the first thing to note is that talk of subjective states does not have to entail a com mitment to any mental or subjective entities with a specific ontological status. It can function as a shorthand for speaking of experiences understood as something phenomenally given to the subjects of those experiences. This is admittedly not a particularly specific characterization, and it is precisely due to its non-specificity that the descriptive appositeness of "what-it-is-like" and its kin notions has been problematized in subsequent philosophy of mind. The elusiveness of the notion, it 12. T. Nagel, "What Is It Like to Be a Bat?," Philosophical Review 83 (1974), 435-450.</page><page sequence="11">SUBJECTIVITY AS A NON-TEXTUAL STANDARD OF INTERPRETATION 31 has been argued, is apt to mislead us into thinking that there is some first-person perspectival fact in experience?inaccessible from a third-person perspective? that would prove physicalism false. William Lycan's treatment of the topic includes a number of relevant, illumi nating observations. A prominent representative of the physicalist view, Lycan de scribes the approach as follows: "seeing someone's brain state of sensing-blazing red is nothing at all like sensing blazing red oneself. Nothing ever said or implied by any materialist has even faintly suggested that it is."13 According to Lycan's interpretation, Nagelian "perspectival facts" are such that they can be grasped only from a first-person perspective and not in any objective way. He also points out against Nagel14 that experiences are not objects that bestow appearances to us; rather, "they are appearings and view-point takings. . . . The subjectivity is im manent to the experiential event."15 He continues, however, by proclaiming that this "does not prevent us from describing the whole event objectively,"16 that is, the fact that the experiential event is subjective does not preclude describing it in objective terms. Whether an objective description is in fact attainable is not our concern here,17 but we can see that in such an enterprise even the contemporary physicalist has to take the phenomenon of subjectivity as the starting point; only with respect to his particular theoretical goals does subjectivity receive the status of an explicated problem. Another type of specific and historically contingent theoretical role of subjec tivity is its use as a method of discovery not only of "other minds" but also of cognition more generally. Lorraine Daston has argued that making use of the idea of an experiential perspective to describe what it is like to be, say, an infant or an animal is a relatively recent invention.18 The presumption that it is both possible and acceptable to take on a perspective other than one's own flourishes in contem porary philosophy of mind, but according to Daston this has not always been the case. Daston's argument, the validity of which we do not question, incites a further observation with respect to our topic: it is a matter for the historian of philosophy and cognitive science to expound and articulate to what extent, if any, past philos ophers have resorted to assuming alternative experiential perspectives as a means of their investigations. Answers to this question are genuine contributions to our historical knowledge. However, it would be an entirely different matter to claim that the emergence of perspectivalness as a method of discovery has engendered subjectivity as a concomitant phenomenon, a phenomenon that has subsequently come to attract the avid interest of later philosophers in its own right.

In this way subjectivity is an inevitable presuppositional starting point for a historian of philosophy interested in unraveling historical theories of philosophical psychology. Therefore, the critique, motivated by reductionist aspirations, of the elusiveness of descriptive notions such as "what-it-is-like," or the argument that the perspectival mode as an instrument of explanation is historical in nature, do not undermine our claim that subjectivity is a non-textual standard. In its role as a non textual standard, subjectivity should be conceived as a rudimentary phenomenon that preconditions the various historical attempts at describing cognition. As such a phenomenon it should be separated from the more specific functions, determina tions, and ontological interpretations to which it has been subjected in the course of history, some of which have been illustrated above by way of examples. V. DENIALS OF THE RELEVANCE OF SUBJECTIVITY FOR HISTORICAL THEORIES In the light of what we have argued so far, let us now consider two recent views that maintain that subjectivity should be excluded in understanding certain his torical theories of perception and consciousness. In the first such view, Stephen Everson propounds an interpretation of the cognitive psychology of the Cyrenaic skeptics according to which the skeptics take processes of perception to involve nothing subjective and to be material through and through.19 Everson focuses on the skeptics' descriptions of the material changes in the sense organs involved in perceptual events and argues that, according to the skeptics, the whole process of perceiving is describable in objective terms. Everson's rejection of subjectivity in the ancient skeptics is rooted in the idea that in order for subjectivity to occur in the first place, "the objects of awareness [should] be mental items such as sensa tions rather than affections of material substance."20 Subjectivity is thus taken to presuppose representationalism via proximate items, that is, ideas or percepts, which are characteristically mental. For the skeptics, however, the objects of awareness are not mental, and hence, according to Everson, not subjective either. Rather, appearances (phainomena) and affections (pathe) are on a par so that the former are just instances of the latter.21 When the skeptics speak of appearances, we should understand them to mean bodily states describable in the same way that affections are, that is, in objective terms as material events.22 Everson makes roughly the same point by considering a contemporary argu ment for the capability of materialism to accommodate subjectivity. This argu ment makes use of the distinction between the sense and reference of a term. Mental terms can refer to objective states of affairs (that is, they can be used to describe states that are in fact material) even if the sense of these terms is defined 19. S.

Everson claims that the ancient view does not acknowledge even such a perspectival relation to material states: "On the ancient view ... there is subjectiv ity at the level neither of reference nor of sense. In being aware of a perceptual pa thos, the subject is directly aware of his state as objectively described"24 Aware ness of being (visually) affected by a white object is awareness of one's eye-jelly turning white.25 This means, minimally, that the Cyrenaic skeptics understood the content of awareness exclusively under objective descriptions. This could perhaps be read as merely pushing subjectivity one step backward compared to Cartesianism: even though the objects of awareness are not treated as subjective, the awareness itself might still count as subjective, at least to the extent that it seems to evade objective or material description.26 Unfortunately, Everson remains completely silent about such a possibility. Therefore, while we are willing to accept Everson's claim about the lack of ideas or percepts as inter mediary representational mental entities in ancient authors, we wonder about the more extensive denial of subjectivity in ancient thought that he winds up sug gesting. By not considering whether the Cyrenaic skeptics might have regarded the awareness of seeing white or tasting sweet as subjective, Everson assigns no role at all to subjectivity in the process of perception. Rather, in denying a "gap between the material states of the subject and his experience,"27 he seems to main tain that since what one is aware 6&gt;/is an objectively described material state there is nothing left to be designated as subjective. But if there is no difference whatsoever between a material change in a sense organ and an experience of that change, we might ask whether using the term "experience" is at all justifiable. In any case, we have scant means to distinguish certain material changes as experiences or as being experienced from other mate rial changes that are not to be counted as such. Provided that a person has no such special relation to her eye-jelly turning white that would count as his or her seeing white, on what grounds should we take the material change involved in seeing to be a perception, while other changes, such as the corruption of his or her eye, are instances of something else? That there appear to be no such grounds is a reason to block Everson's move from a particular ontological interpretation of subjectiv 23. Everson refers to C.

Some of the Cyrenaic skeptics' formulations support the reading that they understood "being affected" as a subjective experience, as in speaking of a madman who sees a doubled Thebes. In this case, the strictly materialist reading should concede that the madman's eye-jelly is doubled. See G. Fine, "Subjectivity, Ancient and Modern: The Cyrenaics, Sextus, and Descartes," in Hellenistic and Early Modern Philosophy, ed. J. Miller and B. Inwood (Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2003), 203-204. 26. Fine argues, pace Everson, that the Cyrenaics describe affections under a subjective mode of presentation. She remarks that it is the awareness itself that we should regard as subjective, even though it would not be by virtue of mental items that we are aware of the material changes.

For the purposes of our essay, Everson's inquiry serves as an incitement to approach the question of subjectivity from the point of view of an interpreter of historical texts. The following formulation by Everson is a good illustration of what we are arguing against: "Whereas the starting-point for the analysis of perception in [the Cartesian] tradition is perceptual experience, this is not the case for any of these ancient authors."28 Our claim is that it is exactly on the level of starting points that subjectivity figures in an important role. We are not likely to understand the details of a historical theory of perception if we fail to acknowl edge that subjectivity constitutes the initial basis for such enterprises as account ing for perception. A distinction should, however, be drawn between two senses in which subjectivity can be said to provide a starting point for an inquiry. It can be an explicit starting point in the sense that the inquiry expressly takes it as one, giving it a specific definition and a particular theoretical role. Such starting points are historically contingent and should be set aside by any historical study willing to treat its subjects on their own terms. But subjectivity can also be an implicit starting point, an obvious feature of experience about which one is not commit ted to give any particular ontological interpretation, and it is in this sense that we should consider it as the common ground between us and past thinkers. Everson considers subjectivity solely in the first, historically contingent sense, that is, as a phenomenon inextricable from the role it plays in a specific early modern theory. Thus, although he is rightly concerned about not reading a modern theory into his ancient texts, he runs the risk of distorting his own reading by an insufficient analysis of the object of his concern, by simply denying subjectivity as a phenom enon without considering whether it might feature in historical theories divested of its modern role. The second recent view that rejects subjectivity as a necessary basis of inter pretation concerns an entirely different historical period. In Descartes' Dualism Gordon Baker and Katherine Morris argue that Descartes's conception of consci entia is indebted to the scholastic notion and should thus be primarily associated with self-knowledge that involves propositional content.29 They are careful in dis tinguishing conscientia with its connotations of moral evaluation from contempo rary uses of "consciousness" with its connotations of phenomenality, and end up arguing that "phenomenological properties" are totally excluded from Descartes's conceptual framework.30 Important for our concerns is that they do not reach this conclusion by bringing forth passages of a positive denial, but by observing that Descartes nowhere explicitly alludes to phenomenal properties and that his sys tem as a whole does not need such properties. On the one hand, this can be taken to mean that insofar as phenomenality is considered as a special property of experiences, it is unknown to Descartes and hence absent from his conceptual apparatus. Baker and Morris take expressions like "raw feels" and "what-it-is-likeness" as emblematic labels for "inexpress 28. Ibid., 133; original emphasis. 29. G. Baker and K. Morris, Descartes' Dualism (London: Routledge, 1996), 210. 30. /to/., 212.</page><page sequence="15">SUBJECTIVITY AS A NON-TEXTUAL STANDARD OF INTERPRETATION 35 ible properties of experiences" that therefore are utterly inept at characterizing Descartes's understanding of the mind in general and conscientia in particular.31 We may treat this as a claim that Descartes does not make any theoretical use of the notion of inexpressible properties of experience. Taken as such, that is, along the lines that the notion of qualia is sometimes understood in the philosophy of mind,32 this is a fair assessment in our view. On the other hand, however, Baker and Morris seem to maintain a more pro found exclusion of phenomenality. They argue that if we resort to the notion of phenomenality we will not be able to conceive of what is at stake for Descartes in his theories of the human mind and animal sentience: "it is not only 'thoughtless brutes,' but human beings with rational souls, that are 'geometrically excluded' from having a 'what's it like?'"33 In other words, since there is no conceptual space in Descartes for framing the general question of what it is like to be something, we would not be able to explain to Descartes what we think his picture might thereby be leaving out.34 Baker and Morris are right in pointing out that concep tual landscapes can undergo radical transformations;35 but allowing no role at all to subjectivity suggests a more radical conceptual breakdown between Descartes and us, a breakdown that concerns our respective preliminary and pre-theoretical understandings of the rough meaning of expressions such as "to cognize" or "to sense." In a way similar to Everson, Baker and Morris start off with a narrowly defined notion of subjectivity, this time referring to inexpressible properties of experience, but end up asserting the absence of subjectivity across the board. No distinction is made between subjectivity as a phenomenon that may precondi tion Descartes's theory regardless of whether it is explicitly discussed in it, and subjectivity in a very specific post-Cartesian sense. The well-argued absence of the latter is unproblematically concluded to yield the controversial absence of the former as well. Whence the tendency to assert the absence of subjectivity as an element in historical theories when it does not figure as an explicit theme in them? We can sketch out one possible reason. Insufficient analysis of the contemporary bundle of phenomenal data, problems, and definitions related to subjectivity is liable to result in an exaggerated caution in historical work with regard to certain phenom enal constituents of that bundle, and this unexamined caution in turn motivates a gross denial of subjectivity. We want to defend the reasonability of supposing subjectivity as an implicit feature of historical theories of philosophical psychol ogy even in cases where no explicit assent to it can be found. Instead of denying that subjectivity is operative from the absence of its explicit treatment, we should only accept such a denial on the basis of an explicit denial by the historical theory under study. 31.

King argues that the mind-body problem, although its ingredients were perhaps available to the medievals, never got to be a problem, let alone the problem for them.36 Body and mind were predominantly considered intermingled with each other, and, con sequently, disembodied sensation was squarely denied. Hence, King argues, there was no room for a mind-body problem in which the emergence of phenomenality seemed mysterious. The supposed "feel" associated with various sensations never posed any interesting difficulties for medieval authors. This result, however, need not entail the absence of subjectivity from the me dieval understanding of sensations in their full complexity. The duality of appear ance and its material basis can be seen as underpinning the medieval discussions without thereby taking the form of an explanatory gap to be bridged. It is impor tant to be clear about the sense in which we speak about subjectivity. Interpreting a historical theory to renounce subjectivity as a phenomenon is a much more drastic claim than showing how it may relegate subjectivity to a role that perhaps will strike us as quaint. The latter is one of the morals of King's investigation; it is the tendency to the former that has encouraged us to consider subjectivity as a non-textual standard of plausibility. VI. CONCLUSION We have insisted on a notion of subjectivity that is not completely contingent on becoming the object of explicit attention in historically developed theories. In our view, the emergence of theoretical interest in subjectivity, and the consequent explicit descriptions of it, and the distinctions between its different types and constituents at a given point in our intellectual history, should be understood as the coming to be of a theoretical focus of attention on a feature of the world or our experience of it that already exists as pre-theoretically given. Accordingly, in the face of the contemporary caution against anachronism and recent emphatic deni als of subjectivity, we have argued for subjectivity as a non-textual standard to be adopted as a heuristic aid, as a minimal common ground shared by the interpreter and the historical author, to serve as a backdrop against which ways of thought different from our own, but also understandable to us, stand out. Studies of historical thinkers can be philosophically and historically pertinent only if they provide an accurate picture of the historical motivations behind their thought, and are consequently capable of showing the radical historical contin gency not only of their sets of philosophical problems but, by comparison, also of our own. However, as we have shown, striving to avoid anachronism can become excessive and result in what seems to be an act of caution but is in fact a his torically unwarranted prejudice in reverse. Overly strict conceptions of historical difference can actually serve as obstacles for arriving at accurate interpretations of historical texts. There are necessary interpretive conditions for any historical 36. P. King, "Why Isn't the Mind-Body Problem Medieval?," in Forming the Mind, ed. H.

We have argued that subjectivity should be taken as such a condition required for historical accuracy in the interpretation of past philosophical texts, and presumably other kinds of texts as well.
