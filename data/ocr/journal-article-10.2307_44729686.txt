King Bioengineering Center Wayne State University Detroit, Ml ABSTRACT Human tolerance data have been acquired gradually over the past 25 years and are available for several body regions. There is now sufficient information to design restraint systems which can prevent serious injuries to the user and which have low injury-causing potential. This paper reviews recent research on injury mechanisms and injury tolerance. Most of the research was aimed at solving problems in automotive safety systems. Spe- cific tolerance data for the following body regions are presented: head, chest, spine and lower extremities. BIOMECHANICS IS THE STUDY of human response to a variety of loads applied to the body. Impact biomechanics is a branch of biomechan- ics concerned with the response of the body to impact forces and acceleration environ- ments. The field can be generally divided into three main areas: mechanical response, injury mechanisms and levels of tolerance. This paper is mainly concerned with the third aspect of impact biomechanics but it will also include a limited discussion of what is cur- rently known about human tolerance to impact. The information is hopefully of use to engi- neers involved in the design of high-speed transportation systems and to those involved in the promulgation of safety standards for automobiles, aircraft and other common forms of vehicular transport. Safety engineers often encounter the simple question: How many g's can I take? A simple answer is expected but unfortunately such an answer cannot be given. First, it is necessary to know how much injury is the person ready to accept. Then there is a whole host of questions which need to be answered before the original question can be addressed. The safety engineer will need to know, for example, the direction of impact, the type of loading, the restraint system in use, the age and sex of the person involved and the part of the body involved. Even after these para- meters have been defined, the answer still cannot be given in terms of a single number. The best answer will be a range of values or a probability of injury of a given level. Although this appears to be a hopeless task, an effort will be made to define human toler- ance and to provide quantitative information. DEFINITION OF TOLERANCE Human tolerance to injury is defined in terms of the threshold selected. Voluntary tolerance is attained from the testing of human subjects. The g-level or force level beyond which the volunteer does not care to be exposed is a level of voluntary tolerance. It is sometimes called the 'ouch1 level. Other tolerance levels include the injury threshold at which injury is imminent but does not occur, minor injury, moderate injury and severe injury. These higher levels of tole- rance are determined from tests involving human surrogates, such as animals or cadavers. Of course, occasional minor injuries occur in human experiments. Injury thresholds are determined by interpolating between this level and the voluntary tolerance level. In the design of safety equipment for the protection of vehicular occupants , the tolerance level selected is at the moderate or minor level. Tolerance to severe injury entails high levels of trauma, including death. Injury levels have been quantified by trauma physicians in terms of an Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS). The 198Q version of AIS consists of numerical ratings from 0 to 6 which are described in detail in Table 1. A detailed description of AIS levels for injur- ies to various body regions can be found in a booklet published by the American Association for Automotive Medicine (AAAM, 1). A serious or severe level of injury is at AIS 3 or 4. 4.404 0096-736X/86/9404-0404$02.50 Copyright 1986 Society of Automotive Engineers, inc.</page><page sequence="2">850852 TABLE 1 The Abbreviated Injury Scale (1) AIS Severity Code 0 No Injury 1 Minor 2 Moderate 3 Severe (not life threatening) 4 Serious (life threatening) 5 Critical (survival uncertain) 6 Maximum (currently untreatable) 9 Unknown It should be noted that AIS is defined for a given body region or segment and various parts of the body can have widely different values of AIS as the result of a single accident. It is to be used exclusively as an injury scale in the context of threat to life. No consid- eration should be given to long-term disabil- ity when assigning AIS values. At each level of tolerance, the physical limit is not a single numerical value. There is a wide range or band of data points from which a probability of injury for a specified AIS can be estimated. This uncertainty is typical of all biological systems and is the primary reason for the difficulties encoun- tered in the setting of safety standards. By the same token, safety standards should not be cast in concrete since they are subject to change as more data become available. To address some of the points brought up in the introductory section, it is necessary that the definition of tolerance be related to a particular body region or segment. Early studies in impact biomechanics attempted to determine whole-body tolerance of occupants who are securely and adequately restrained in a seat. Other early investigations attempted to estimate the g-levels encountered by indi- viduals who survived falls from great heights. More recent work seeks to establish the toler- ance of body regions or segments which when injured can post a threat to life or result in a long-term disability. Regional tolerance limits are also more useful in assessing the injury potential of protective systems or restraint systems. This paper is primarily concerned with the regional tolerance of the head, spine, thorax and lower extremities. There is no question that the agents responsible for mechanical injury to the human body are forces and moments and that the most direct means of describing limits of tolerance is in terms of these physical parameters. However, forces and moments are often dif- ficult to measure in an impact environment. Load cells are generally quite large and often inconvenient to use. Frequently they need to be interposed between the body and the impact- ing surface, altering the level and character- istics of the contact force. On the other hand, acceleration of body segments are rela- tively easy to measure using accelerometers which are small in size and weight. Thus, the principal measure of tolerance is acceleration. Force is used occasionally for a limited number of body segments , such as the knee and facial bones. Since tolerance is related to the direc- tion of impact, it is convenient to use a unified notation and to define a convention of signs for linear acceleration. This will not only simplify the description of tolerance limits but also clearly define the direction of impact. Table 2 provides the convention of signs used for the vehicle and the occupant, proposed by the Biodynamics Committee of the Aerospace Medical Panel, AGARD (Gell, 2) A distinction should also be made between tolerance to injury and criterion for injury. The former depends on the level of injury and the type of injury while the latter is a physical parameter which correlates well with injury severity of a body segment. Such criteria are often measured or computed from tests using human surrogates (test dummies) in an attempt to predict the expected injury to a human exposed to the same level of impact severity. The severity of injury used to determine a criterion for injury is usually at the serious level (AIS = 3). The use of the term injury criteria also implies the possibil- ity of a legal specification, such as safety performance standards for protective devices.

The former is caused by a direct blow to the head and the force level necessary to cause fracture de- pends on the rigidity and shape of the impac- tor as well as on the velocity of impact. These data have been summarized in an SAE Information Report (3). Brain injury mechan- isms are more complex. The principal agents are linear and/or angular acceleration which cause (s) skull fractures and neurological as well as vascular damage to the brain. Injuries to the brain can result in long term disabil- ities as well as in an immediate loss of orientation and consciousness. They are more serious than skull fractures and should be the controlling factor in establishing the toler- ance of the head to impact accelerations. Brain injury can occur with or without direct impact to the head. In general, high linear accelerations are experienced when there is contact with restraining surfaces, such as the windshield of a car in a frontal collision. High angular accelerations can also occur in this situation. However, angular accelera- tions are experienced by automotive occupants in a rear end collision, with no head contact against a vehicular surface. Restrained occupants can also experience angular acceler- ations without head contact since seat belts tend to limit the range of motion of the torso in the vehicle. A detailed discussion of the injury mechanisms responsible for different types of brain injuries can be found in Ommaya (4). Briefly, the brain and skull experience relative motion when the head is subjected to a sudden acceleration. As a result, there can be neurological dysfunction (coma) and rupture of blood vessels (hematoma) . Both shear and direct pressure are considered responsible for the various injuries. HEAD IMPACT TOLERANCE - Ideally, toler- ance of the brain to impact should be divided into two classes: tolerance to neurological dysfunction and tolerance to vascular injuries. At present, there is limited information on tolerance of the head to linear acceleration and even less information on its tolerance to angular acceleration. In 1960, Lissner et al (5) proposed a tolerance curve for head impact which was set at a level of moderate or serious injury (AIS of 2 to 3). It is shown in Figure 1 as a log plot of effective (average) accele- ration against pulse duration. It became known as the Wayne State Tolerance Curve (WSTC) for linear impact against rigid sur- faces. The data base used for generating this curve was limited and it was a composite of a variety of impacts to cadavers, animals as well as volunteer subjects. The Gadd Severity Index (GSI) was derived by Gadd (6) from this tolerance curve. It is shown in Equation 1 below: GSI = J Tandt 1,000 (1) 'i 0 where a = absolute value of the average acceleration n - 2.5, based on the slope of the line in Figure 1 dt = time interval of integration T = duration of the impact The limit of 1 ,000 was based on a moder- ate or serious injury. This criterion became part of the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) 208 in 1967. It was replaced by the Head Injury Criterion (HIC) in 1972. This is generally lower than the GSI because the exponentiation is performed after integra- tion and the pulse does not need to be recti- fied before being integrated. For the GSI, all negative acceleration values contributed to the injury. As shown in Equation 2 below, the HIC is a maximum value to be determined from a portion of the impact pulse r 1 /T2 1n ^ HIC - (Tj - T2)1-t-~_~t- r 1 I /T2 „d,j T^ max where a = Acceleration of the head which can take on either sign T^ = Starting time for integration T~ = Ending time for integration ñ = 2.5 Although this injury criterion is only applicable when there is linear acceleration of the head, the current usage is to find the resultant acceleration of the head and use it in the expression above. The acceleration again becomes positive definite and it also partially accounts for the rotational compon- ent of acceleration. Since angular acceler- ation is considered to be a significant contributor to both vascular as well as neuro- logical injury, Ommaya (4) proposed a separate set of tolerance limits for angular acceler- ation. However, he does not provide a source for these limits. Lowenhielm (7) suggested that |he angular acceleration peak of 4,500 rad/s and an angular velocity change of 70 rad/s were capable of initiating gliding contusions due to excessive straining of the cerebral blood vessels. Another criticism of the HIC is the 'go1 and 'no-go' nature of such a criterion. It is convenient to use in the implementation of a safety standard but it provides no gradation of injury. Suggestions have been put forth to replace it by other criteria, such as the Mean Strain Criterion (MSC) which was based on a lumped parameter model of head impact devel- oped by Stalnaker et al (8). There is obvi- ously a need to do more research for a fuller understanding of the mechanisms of injury to the head and to determine the parameters which best describe the tolerance of the head. In fact, it may be difficult to try to replace the HIC as the current injury criterion because of the lack of new head injury data which can 4.406</page><page sequence="4">850852 o ř- mYmm 1-1 p* " 1-1 "T" "T- ^m^mmm - mÊm ° o I -"in / ~~ o LU / ~~ TT "" &gt; / CC / / - ° - CJ / - 00 LU / o / Z / © ^ / CM ""cc / lu / lu ° h- ļ / i 1A h- ļ 1A / E Z / o : ; -'l S / - H- - / _ &lt; : - ÍT /7 :.» _ K /7 K / J lO / // / / / 1 cnj "*5 - « UJ û. / / cnj UJ - / / - « û. 1 »/ I 1 1 1 1 1 » ' I o O O O o O o o un ~ un CM *- (6 ) N 0 1 1 VU 31 3 33V 3 A 113333 3 Figure 1 Wayne State Tolerance Curve for head impact (5) 4.407</page><page sequence="5">be used to identify new parameters which are better predictors of injury. There is also a move to change the HIC criterion to 1,500 s. Recent statistical analyses performed by Mertz and Weber (9) and by Ran et al (10) initiated formal procedures for assessing probabilities of injury which can lead to a better defini- tion of head impact tolerance, in particular, and human tolerance, in general. IMPACT TOLERANCE OF THE SPINE MECHANISMS OF INJURY TO THE SPINE - The human vertebral column is the principal load bearing structure of the head and torso. There are also secondary functions performed by each portion of the spine. The neck or cervical spine provides the head with a limited degree of mobility and a protected pathway for the upper segment of the spinal cord. The thorac- ic spine offers the same protection to the cord while allowing mobility of the upper torso and rib cage. The lumbar spine provides the lower torso with mobility and encloses the lower end of the spinal cord. The protective role of the spine is analogous to that of the skull. It provides a shield for the cord, but like the skull, it is not strong enough to protect it from many of the mechanical insults due to accidents involving modern day transpor- tation systems. Spinal cord injuries can result in death, quadriplegia and paraplegia. In order to understand the mechanisms of injury to the spine, it is essential to have familiarity with the anatomy of the spine. Since it is made up of a series of bones (vertebrae) joined together by soft tissue (discs and ligaments) , it can be injured at an intervertebral joint or the bony structures can sustain fractures. As a general rule it is very difficult to apply a single unidirectional load to the spine to cause it to fail. A force (tension, compression or shear) combined with a bending moment or torque is needed to injure the spine. For the neck, there are many possible combinations of axial and shear loads and moments which can cause fracture of the vertebral bodies and/or the dislocation of intervertebral joints. For example, for a restrained right front seat passenger of an automobile involved in a very severe frontal collision, the neck of the occupant will be subjected to a large tensile load in conjunc- tion with a large forward flexion moment. This can result in a separation of the first cervical vertebra from the skull. On the other hand, in a severe rear-end accident, the driver of the struck vehicle will ramp up the seat back and hit the roof or rear struc- tures of the car as the head is forced to rotate rearward. Cervical vertebrae can be fractured as though they were subjected to an axial compressive load. For the thoraco-lumbar spine, the common mode of injury is the an- terior wedge fracture of the lower thoracic and upper lumbar vertebrae. This is caused by the application of a vertical acceleration (+G ) via the seat pan to a seated occupant. It is facilitated by the concommitant appli- cation of a forward deceleration (~GX) as shown by King and Levine (11). The fact that the articular facets are able to carry shear and compressive loads borne by the spine is crucial to the under- standing of the mechanisms of injury. For the cervical spine, the facets are oriented rear- ward at an angle of about 45 degrees. They can sustain a large compressive and horizontal shear load before the joint fails. Extreme flexion is needed to cause the facets to override the articulating surfaces. However, when that occurs , there is generally damage to the spinal cord, resulting in quadriplegia. The facets of the thoracic spine also face rearward but tend to be more vertical. They are thus more difficult to dislocate. Those of the lumbar spine are almost vertical and are oriented to face each other in the lateral direction. They were found to be capable of carrying a significant portion of the vertical load borne by the spine by Prasad et al (12) and re-confirmed by Yang and King (13) recently. Thus, the inertial effect of a +GZ acceler- ation is to cause the spine to carry an ec- centric compressive load. When the torso is erect, this load is shared by the vertebral body and the articular facets. However, because the load is eccentric, the head and torso will flex forward and the spine is asked to resist a large flexion moment in addition to the compressive load. The facets become unloaded or go into tension and the vertebral body assumes an additional compressive load due to this resisting moment. Anterior wedge fractures are the result. IMPACT TOLERANCE OF THE SPINE - The tolerance of the spine to impact acceleration is depen- dent upon the type of restraint system used and on the type of acceleration experienced by the occupant. For a well-restrained seated occupant subjected to uniaxial acceleration, the tolerance to +GZ acceleration is approxi- mately 20 g for impact durations in excess of 200 ms. This is the usual limit in the design of ejection seats used for emergency egress from disabled aircraft. This limit was origi- nally published by Eiband (14) as a Tolerance limit for whole-body acceleration since the torso was so well restrained that the entire torso experienced the same level of acceleration. The corresponding value for -G is more than twice as high as demonstrated by the volunteer studies of Stapp (15). There is very little tolerance information for a combined +Gz and a -Gx exposure. The cadaveric limits were found to be about 9 g for simulated vertical accele- ration combined with a 17 degree forward pitch of the seat. This limit was based on observed anterior wedge fractures of the T8 to L3 segment of the thoraco-lumbar spine. It should be noted that this is not a tolerance limit for severe or life-threatening injuries. 4.408</page><page sequence="6">850852 The AIS level is 2 to 3, If the strength of aircraft seats in commercial airliners are designed to this limit, the passengers may not be able to evacuate from the aircraft as a result of becoming entangled in loose seats torn off their anchors in an otherwise surviv- able crash. Similarly, tolerance to lateral acceleration is much higher than 1.5 g, the lateral strength of aircraft seats. Both E wing et al (16) and Patrick et al (17) have shown that human voluntary tolerance to lat- eral impact is about 8 to 10 g. Tolerance of the neck to impact acceler- ation is of current interest because restraint systems for the protection of the neck are not easy to design. The occupant must have the freedom to move the head about under normal circumstances and be protected from excessive neck loads in a crash. The principal mode of loading in a frontal crash is stretching and forward bending (flexion). The combined limit of 6000 N tensile force and 340 N.m of flexion was reported by Cheng et al (18) for inertial loading with no head contact. It was shown by King et al (19) that neck loads were lower with head contact and thus the most severe condition of neck loading occurs when it is acted on by a freely whipping head. Other limits have been proposed by Mertz and Patrick (20) in the form of a corridor, as shown in Figure 2 and 3 for flexion and extension. The bending limit of 190 N.m is for an AIS of about 2 and is only 150 N.m less than the limit proposed by Cheng et al (18) for an AIS of 5 or 6. The reason for this discrepancy is the significant effect of the added tensile load experienced by the neck when there is a large -G component. IMPACT TOLERANCE OF THORAX INJURY MECHANISMS OF THE THORAX - The thorax is protected by the rib cage which is anchored to the spine posteriorly and to the sternum anteriorly. The vital organs in the thorax are the heart, great vessels and the lungs. Direct impacts to the chest or loads applied to the chest via restraint systems (belts or air bags) can cause the ribs to fail due to excessive bending. Rib fractures are generally not a life-threatening injury unless a large number of fractures occur to cause a flail chest. If the rib fractures are displaced they can lacerate or contuse vital organs , particularly the lungs. Introduction of air into the pleural space causes the lung to collapse, resulting in a pneumothorax. Of course, the rupture of the bronchus or its branches can also result in a pneumothorax. The aorta and the chambers of the heart can be ruptured by a sudden impact to the chest. There is evidence to indicate that the tearing of the aorta occurs mainly near attach- ment points, such as the ligamentum arteriosum which is a fibrous connection between the aorta and the pulmonary artery (Viano, 21).

A more detailed discussion of these 4.409</page><page sequence="7">injury mechanisms can be found in a recent paper by Viano (22) . IMPACT TOLERANCE OF THE THORAX - Tolerance of the chest to impact can be expressed in terms of force, acceleration, velocity and/or chest compression. Force was found to be an unsatis- factory parameter because the tolerance of the chest is dependent on both the force and the area of chest impacted. Kinematic measures of injury were used instead of force. They ranged from chest deflection to sternal veloc- ity and sternal as well as spinal acceler- ation for frontal impact. Much of the cadaver data that could be used to establish a tolerance level were summarized by Neathery et al (23) who developed equations to predict AIS based on chest deflection and age of the victim. Viano (24) cautioned against the emphasis on skeletal injury and suggested that vascular and visceral injuries were more serious. Using thoracic impact data obtained from testing of rabbits, Viano and Lau (25) pro- posed an injury criterion which was dependent on both chest compression as well as impact velocity. An injury severity measure was suggested. It took the form of VC/(1-C) where V is the impactor velocity and C is the normal- ized chest compression. Acceleration was used orginally as an injury criterion. In fact, the current safety standard is in terms of spinal acceleration behind the sternum. The limit is defined as a resultant acceleration which shall not exceed 60 g continuously for more than 3 ms. Other data in terms of chest acceleration were reported by Eppinger (26) for frontal impact and by Robbins et al (27) and by Eppinger et al (28) for side impact. IMPACT TOLERANCE OF THE LOWER EXTREMITIES MECHANISMS OF INJURY TO THE LOWER EXTREMITIES - The principal segments of concern are the thigh and shank. The long bones associated with these segments are the femur and tibia respectively. The primary injuries which affect the function of these limbs are frac- ture of the long bones and the stability of the joints, the ankle, knee and hip. In impact situations, the vulnerable elements are the long bones which tend to fail in bending. For automotive occupants involved in a frontal crash, knee impact with the instrument panel is a frequent occurrence, particularly if the occupant is unrestrained. The femur transmits this load to the hip joint along its axis which is not aligned with the mechanical axis of the femur. It is thus subjected to a combined axial (compressive) and bending load. However, bone is a brittle material which is weak in tension and the tensile stresses generated by the applied bending moment are responsible for its fracture. The same mechan- ism applies to the tibia. In terms of joint injuries, the hip joint is damaged due to the large loads transmitted by the femur to this joint. A variety of fracture and dislocation patterns can result from this mode of loading. Failure of the knee joint was found to be due to the relative motion of the tibia with respective to the femur. Viano et al (29) discussed this mechanism in connection with the use of a passive restraint system which utilizes a shoulder belt and a knee bolster. If the surface of the knee bolster is flat and almost parallel to the tibia and if the tibial tuberosity is the first area of contact during knee impact, this protuberance is sufficient to move the tibia rearwards relative to the femur to cause the posterior cruciate ligament to be avulsed from the tibial plateau. In a recent study by Cheng et al (30) , it was found that this injury could be avoided by a properly designed knee bolster which had a curved surface so that the first contact was either made by the patella or by the tibial tubero- sity and the patella simultaneously. IMPACT TOLERANCE OF THE LOWER EXTREMITIES - The current safety standard for the lower extremities calls for the axial load borne by the femur to be less than 10 kN (2,250 lb). This is based on research performed by Patrick et al (31), Powell et al (32, 33) and by Melvin et al (34) and Melvin and Stalnaker (35). It was originally set at 6.23 kN (1,400 lb) but was raised to 10 kN because the frac- ture loads applied to the knee were found to be consistently higher than 6.23 kN in cada- veric studies. The use of multi-axis load cells to measure both forces and moments sus- tained by the femur showed that the maximum bending moment averaged 88 N.m about the lateral y-axis (Cheng et al, 30). This moment was due to a vertical shear load applied to knee during a frontal impact. Bending moments due to the eccentric mechanical axis of the femur (Mx) were not large. Thus, the bending stresses in the femur could not be correlated directly with the applied axial load, and a new tolerance limit which reflects the injury mechanism more accurately is needed. DISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSIONS Although impact biomechanics has received considerable attention in the past 20 years and a considerable body literature is in the public domain, much work remains to be done to refine the current tolerance limits and injury criteria. For the head, the mechanisms of brain injury have not been completely defined which in turn severely limits progress towards the establishment of a more universal injury criterion for the brain. Although the toler- ance for the neck can be specified for frontal impact, much work remains to be done before injury criteria can be established for various loading conditions. The thoraco-lumbar spine also requires multiple criteria for these different loading conditions. However, in- juries to the thoraco-lumbar spine are not common in automotive accidents and are thus a low priority research topic. This may not be 4.410</page><page sequence="8">850852 the case for survivable aircraft accidents during which the occupants are liable to sustain high levels of +Gz acceleration. Spinal injury research is thus in the domain of aircraft safety engineers and needs to be sponsored by agencies charged with the respon- sibility of regulating aircraft safety. The injury mechanisms for the thorax are better understood. However, there is as yet no consensus on the parameter (s) which best describe thoracic injury. Because of the viscoelastic nature of the thorax, it may be necessary to specify criteria for different impact regimes based on rates of loading and the degree of chest compression. Tolerance limits for the lower extremities are still rather rudimentary and limited. Tolerance of the knee and hip is speculative and bending loads necessary to fracture the tibia are unknown. In general, finer regional tolerance limits are needed for the lower extremities. Tolerance limits for the shoulder, upper extremities and abdomen were not discussed primarily because of the limited information available for these body regions. The lack of acceptable tolerance limits for these body regions further demonstrate the need for additional research to secure data for all body regions. The task is indeed monumental and needs to tackled in a systematic and organized manner by a large group of research organizations. It is also obvious from this discussion that the design of safety systems for trans- portation systems must be based on a sound knowledge of human tolerance to impact. The strength of the seat anchors in commercial aircraft is a case in point. A well-re- strained human body can withstand much more than 9 g frontally, 4.5 g vertically and 2 g laterally. The injuries resulting from these g-levels are not life threatening. To cite research results out of context and to use them to justify the current practice of seat anchor design is unacceptable from a biomecha- nical viewpoint and is a disservice to the public at large. The following conclusions can be drawn from this brief survey of the state-of-the-art in human tolerance research: 1. Current safety standards or injury criteria are inadequate. They need to be revised to reflect current understanding of the injury mechanisms involved and more recent research data. 2. Regional tolerance limits have not been established for many body regions. In particular, such limits are needed for the neck which can be subjected to a large number of loading conditions. Tolerance information for the abdomen, shoulder and joints of the lower extre- mities needs to be generated for the common modes of impact. 3. Design of vehicular safety systems should utilize the best available data on regional tolerance to injury. REFERENCES 1.
