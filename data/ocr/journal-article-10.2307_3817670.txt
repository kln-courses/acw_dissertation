<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Poetics of Geologic Reverie: Figures of Source and Origin in Samuel Seymour s Landscapes of the Rocky Mountains KENNETH HALTMAN Une fois de plus on peut se convaincre que voir de pres c'est s'interdire de rever loin. -Gaston Bachelard1 In 1782, Benjamin Franklin wrote in a letter to a French colleague: I know not whether I have expressed myself so clearly, as not to get out of your sight in these reveries. If they occasion any new enquiries, and produce a better hypothesis, they will not be quite useless. You see I have given a loose to imagination; but I approve much more your method of philosophizing, which proceeds upon actual observation, makes a collection of facts, and concludes no farther than those facts will warrant. In my present circumstances, that mode of studying the nature of this globe is out of my power, and therefore I have permitted myself to wander a little in the wilds of fancy.2 Portions of this essay were presented in papers at Bryn Mawr College and the Yale University Art Gallery in 1992, the American Studies Association meeting in 1993, and the Missouri Conference on History in 1994. I have bene- fited from the comments of Stephen Z. Levine, Angela Miller, Bruce Robertson, Roger Stein, and Bryan Wolf; my thanks to Erin Wright for a careful critical reading. 1.

HUNTINGTON LIBRARY QUARTERLY- 59: 2 &amp; 3 v 303</page><page sequence="2">304 KENNETH HALTMAN This apology for indulgence in geologic reverie followed an uncharacteristically fanciful passage, in which Franklin-that exemplar of scientific empiricism- attributed irregularities in the surface of the earth to the action of waves pro- duced in its "internal ponderous fluid" by underground explosions of water and fire. The sudden violence of such an explosion, he mused, would suffice not just to uplift the incumbent earth above but also to impress the fluid below, creating a wave that might "run a thousand leagues lifting and thereby shaking succes- sively all the countries under which it passe[d]." The scientific merits of this brief meander "in the wilds of fancy" interest me less than does the twofold case that Franklin made for it. Given the choice, he explained, he would more approve a "method of philosophizing" based on "actual observation"; but in his "present circumstances"-he was in Paris to conclude a treaty with Great Britain-he had little opportunity for geologic let alone geogenic study in the field. However, in the paragraph quoted he adduces a further, positive rationale for giving "a loose to imagination": that there might be some explanatory value in reveries, if they "occasion any new enquiries and produce a better hypothesis" in the end.3 As might be expected from Franklin, both of these justifications for spec- ulation are ultimately practical ones-a recuperation of imagination on the grounds of common sense. In fact, I would suggest, the tension that his words reveal between a strictly defined empiricism (limited to collecting facts, and concluding "no farther than the facts will allow") and speculation from nec- essarily partial or contingent knowledge informed all geologic science in the late Enlightenment, despite vitriolic claims for pure empiricism advanced by theorists of all camps.4 The constraints of "present circumstances" might be understood as referring broadly to the impossibility of ascertaining what lay in that realm Martin Rudwick has so appositely termed "Deep Time," refer- ring simultaneously to the buried features of the earth and to its distant past.5 3. Franklin was responding to notes Soulavie had sent him of an earlier conversation concerning theories of geologic change: "I wrote it to set him right in some points wherein he had mistaken my meaning" (Complete Works, 8:187n). 4.

Long Expedition (1819-20).6 Although geological debate had grown more sophisticated and interpretive paradigms were better articulated, methodological ambivalence about the role of speculation persisted. Fieldwork was understood as fundamental to the pur- suit of geologic understanding; while speculation, though anathema to some, was widely acknowledged to be equally essential, both the stimulus to research and its interpretative consequence.7 Seymour's dual commission to seek out landscape subjects of interest to his scientific colleagues yet notable for their "grandeur" thus corresponded to an epistemologic ambivalence informing these colleagues' own thinking.8 Although acknowledged to be the first white artist to represent the land- forms and geologic formations of the American West, Seymour has not yet received serious study, nor have his "views" been adequately appreciated by scholars for their complexity as both scientific illustration and artistic state- ment.9 Seymour has not been recognized as a painter of geologic landscapes, even though an important subset of his surviving watercolors from the Long 6. The expedition was known after its commanding officer, Stephen Harriman Long (1784-1864), a major in the newly reorganized Army Corps of Topographical Engineers; see Roger L. Nichols and Patrick L. Halley, Stephen Long andAmerican Frontier Exploration (Newark, Del., 1980). 7. For a valuable contemporary appraisal of the state of this debate, see Walter Channing's detailed review of Georges Cuvier's Essay on the Theory of the Earth and J. Freeman Dana and Samuel L. Dana's Outlines of the Mineralogy and Geology of Boston and Its Vicinity [1818] in North American Review 8 (1819): 396-414. John C. Greene, in American Science in the Age ofJefferson (Ames, Iowa, 1984), traces the positions taken in this debate back to geological circles in Edinburgh; see also George P. Merrill's still useful The First One Hundred Years ofAmerican Geology (New Haven, Conn., 1924). 8. "Mr. Seymour as Painter for the Expedition" was to "furnish sketches of Landscapes whenever we meet with any distinguished for their beauty or grandeur-he will also paint miniature likenesses or Portraits if required of distinguished Indians and exhibit groups of savages engaged in celebrating their festivals or sit- ting in council and in general illustrate any subject that may be deemed appropriate in his art"; Stephen Long to John C. Calhoun, 20 April 1819, "Letters Received by the Secretary of War"; reprinted in The Papers ofJohn C. Calhoun, 19 vols. (Columbia, S.C., 1959-90), 4:33-34. I have preferred this version of Long's "Instructions to His Command" to that published later in the Account (with most capitals removed and punctuation added) as closer in tone to the instructions Seymour would have received in the field. For the later version, see Edwin James, Account of an Expedition from Pittsburgh to the Rocky Mountains, 2 vols. plus an atlas (Philadelphia, 1822-23), 1:3; 14:42 (hereafter Account). The Philadelphia edition, substantially emended, was reissued in three volumes in London in 1823, without the atlas.

Indeed, all expeditionary imagery executed in the years of the early republic has been treated in a singularly reductive manner-despite a consid- erable body of literature demonstrating the importance of not mistaking land- scape imagery in general for simple transcriptions of nature.10 My intent in this essay is to establish, in Seymour's expeditionary work, the simultaneous cur- rency of two radically divergent pictorial impulses: mimetic realism on the one hand, which subordinates artistic invention to the facticity of what Franklin termed "actual observation"; and picturesque practice on the other, which draws the viewer in through an idealized reconfiguration of the world, and gives, in Franklin's formulation, "a loose to imagination." While Seymour managed to integrate these contrasting and competing styles of vision within the scope of single compositions by purely gestural means, connecting near to far by figures looking, it was his insight into the essential similarities between his art and the science he was representing that provided him the means to unify his compositions not just aesthetically but also thematically. There has been insufficient attention paid this coincidence in the dialectics animating scientific and artistic "fieldwork" in the period. Just as early Amer- ican landscape painting was characterized by an ultimately fertile opposition between view and vision, mimesis and imagination,11 so might the science of the day, earth science in particular, be characterized by a similar opposition between two competing modes of understanding.12 Late Enlightenment science and early Romantic art, beyond their shared interest inplein air investigation as a "method of philosophizing,"13 were involved in a wide-ranging cultural 10.

Although these cultural practices are often seen as having little in common beyond their objects of scrutiny, some critics have followed Rudwick in describing the relationship of geologic art to geologic science in this period as "broadly complementary."4 This conclusion is not surprising once we recog- nize that both art and science are epistemologies, systems or strategies of know- ing, and as such concerned first and foremost with harnessing, regulating, and defining the inquiring gaze. It now seems commonplace to point out that science by the early decades of the nineteenth century had achieved a new (what we might term modern) self- consciousness concerning both the nature and the limitations of human per- ception. At the same time, American artists were evidencing, and thematizing in their work, a newly self-conscious awareness and theoretical concern with how the eye moves through space, making "sense of the world" in an active rather than a passive manner. In part, I seek to reveal the contest between styles of seeing that underlies the apparent harmony of Seymour's compositions, and to this end I examine the implications of representational formulas derived from the British picturesque tradition that Seymour applied to the western landscape; and I call attention to the way that Seymour's disposition of forms (especially the relation of figures to the landscapes in which they appear) serves to instruct his viewers how to see, hence how to know. One of the principal means Seymour devised to unify his geologic land- scapes or "scenographic geologic illustrations"15 both compositionally and thematically was his artistic focus on origination, a topos with relevance for a range of intellectual endeavors and institutions including the nation's oldest and most prestigious organizations for the advancement of knowledge, the American Philosophical Society and the Academy of Natural Sciences, both of Philadelphia. At the request of the War Department, these organizations 14. Martin J. S.

Both Long's diplomacy, with its roots in a symbolic language and nationalist rhetoric borrowed from Lewis and Clark, and the ethnographic studies of Thomas Say were driven by interest in "natural" ori- gins.18 Edwin James's fascination with geognosic origins, meanwhile, informed the field investigations he carried out as the expedition's geologist.19 Figures of source and origin, while they provided Seymour iconographic means to fulfill his instructions as "Painter for the Expedition," furnished him a pictorial language well suited to his own preoccupation with the issue of origination as it concerned the genesis of his art. Seymour's inflection of the already highly self-conscious idiom of picturesque landscape to thematize, and in some sense mystify, the sources of his own artistic production as orig- inal-as not subordinate to things as seen-suggests much about the proto- Romantic modernism of American vernacular painting (including scientific illustration) in the early decades of the new republic. 16. On the role played in western exploration by the American Philosophical Society and the Academy of Natural Sciences (all of the expedition's "scientific gentlemen," including Long, belonged to one or both), see William H.

Barbara Stafford, in "Toward Romantic Landscape Perception: Illustrated Travel Accounts and the Rise of'Singularity' As an Aesthetic Category," Art Quarterly, n.s., 1 (autumn 1977), has described natural history as, in fact, embodying the "quest for origins" (p. 100). 18. Thomas Say (1787-1834), though officially the expedition's zoologist, was also charged with studying the manners and the customs of Native Americans encountered; see Patricia Tyson Stroud, Thomas Say: New World Naturalist (Philadelphia, 1992), chaps. 5-7; and the valuable earlier study by Harry B. Weiss and Grace M. Ziegler, Thomas Say: Early American Naturalist (Springfield, Ill., 1931). 19. Edwin James (1797-1861) was also physician to the expedition. Attention to geologic origins pervades the Account (with references to works by Hutton, Werner, Eaton, Maclure, Volney, and Kirwan), climaxing with the arrival at the base of the mountains in June and July of 1820 (see text, below), and after the expedition James pursued the topic in a series of professional papers and articles. The most useful biographical assessment remains Maxine Benson, "Edwin James: Scientist, Linguist, Humanitarian" (Ph.D. diss., University of Colorado, 1968).

Hills of the [Floetz] Trap Formation (1822); watercolor over graphite on paper, 14.5 x 21 cm. Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Yale University. Seymour made the preparatory drawing for his Hills of the [Floetz] Trap Formation (fig. 51) in late July 1820, not far from the Arkansas River along the front range of the Rocky Mountains. We see in the middle distance an unusual formation of a kind then referred to by some geologists as floetz rock, a German mining term for formations with predominant horizontal stratification. This particular occurrence is described at length in the Long Expedition's official narrative report, of which James was the nominal compiler and principal au- thor, as a "symmetric disposition of truncated cones, sometimes insulated, sometimes grouped, and by elevated plains, both extremities of which are crowned by a conical rising."20 Seymour has placed the figures of two members of the party (and their mules) in the lower left foreground of the image. The seated figure nearest us, 20. Account, 2:404; 17:210. The geological report in the appendix to the Account, from which this passage is quoted, has previously been credited either to Long (to whom it was submitted) or to Augustus Jessup (the original expedition geologist, listed in the table of contents of the British editions as its author), but is cer- tainly the work of James. The phrase "elevated plains, both extremities of which are crowned by a conical rising" is in italics in the original. w' 309</page><page sequence="8">310 KENNETH HALTMAN with his knees up and his head down, his attention focused on his open note- book, may be read equally well as a geologist taking field notes or as an artist working in his sketchbook-in the context of the expedition, as either James or Seymour himself. That this illustration should chronicle the geologic field- work whose results it also represents-James studying the "symmetric disposi- tion of truncated cones," then writing the description we have read-may seem tautological. But so too does the visual evidence-the presence of Sey- mour's signature immediately below-that what we see is a self-portrait of the artist in the process of capturing this very image. The anomaly in both cases is the same, of course: that this figure, whether scientist or artist, has his back turned to the world that he transcribes-if, indeed, transcription this is. The geologic description memorialized in the watercolor, like the watercolor itself, is less an act of representation than one of self-reflection, a text (judging from the body language of its maker) essentially closed upon itself, or open upon the noumenal world in only a highly mediated fashion. The epistemologic value of this passage is if anything reinforced by its conventional position in Seymour's composition as repoussoir, as a framing device informing our own relationship as viewers to the world we are invited to behold. As we can see, comparing the watercolor to James's description, Seymour took the work of geologic illustration very seriously, but only as "pre-text" for his own self-conscious affirmation of the role played by imagination-not just in the work of scientific illustration but in science itself. For if what we have here is in one sense a narrative of fieldwork (whetherplein air sketching or geo- logical research) understood in Franklin's terms as a method that "proceeds upon actual observation, makes a collection of facts, and concludes no farther than those facts will warrant," in another sense Seymour's Hills of the [Floetz] Trap Formation offers a competing vision-science as the work of reverie. It would be difficult to exaggerate the significance of this defeat of positivist expectation on Seymour's part, the more so given that his recognition was shared. In a paper read before the American Philosophical Society-the one on which the strictly mineralogical treatment quoted above was based-James himself acknowledged that the "appearance and position" of such curious for- mations "lead almost involuntarily those least attached to visionary theories into speculations concerning their origin."21 In this view, taken to its extreme, geology is but a science of representation with its analogue in art; and the work of the geologist, like that of the artist, 21.

KENNETH HALTMAN 310 ^</page><page sequence="9">SAMUEL SEYMOUR'S LANDSCAPES OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS involves inscription of the world with meaning as much as transcription of meanings pre-inscribed in the world. Even the term "Trap Formation" in the watercolor's title calls punning attention to the circumstance of representation closed upon itself. Transforming static geologic illustration into a mode of his- tory painting writ small, Seymour thematized both the work of science and the work of art as concurrently descriptive and inscriptive. It is not that either serves as a vehicle for the other, but rather that the two interdepend.22 This interdependence was certainly reflected in the various narratives pro- duced by James, who was responsible for most of the contemporary written reports of the expedition's findings. James describes the environs of the floetz rock formation visible in Seymour's watercolor as "abound[ing] in scenery of a grand and most interesting character," going on to comment effusively: The contrast of colours which is here seen, often produces the most brilliant and grateful effects. The deep green of the small procumbent cedars and junipers, with the less intense colours of various kinds of deciduous foliage, acquire new beauty by being placed as a margin to the glowing red and yellow which is seen on the surface of many of the rocks. In the narrow but verdant valleys, small pyramids and columns of the purest white are met with, standing solitary and detached from any surrounding rocks.23 Here James the geologist speaks the language of art, employing a palette that closely resembles Seymour's own. He describes the sandstone out of which the "conical risings" emerge as "var[ying] in colour from vermilion red to dark brown, and sometimes to various shades of yellow and grey." Conversely, Seymour's palette might be viewed as a coloristic analogue to the Geological Alphabet proposed by Amos Eaton, who had instructed James in earth science at Middlebury College, "consisting of nine simple minerals, an acquaintance with which will enable any one to spell out any rock with facility."24 22. Rudwick, in "A Visual Language for Geological Science," first argued that geologic illustrations in this period constitute a "visual mode" of scientific communication. 23 James, "Remarks on the Sandstone and Floetz Trap Formations," 197-98. 24.

Where James portrays the scenery along the banks of the Ohio as "eminently beautiful" but "deficient in grandeur and variety," he relies on the conventional vocabulary of the picturesque, familiar from travel narratives of the period as well as aesthetic treatises. He paints the scene as though it were a picture: "The hills usually approach on both sides, nearly to the brink of the river; they have a rounded and graceful form, and are so grouped as to produce a pleasing effect." Such chiastic prose echoes the form of the landscape it describes. With a change of voice but without pause, James goes on to note, now employing the vocabulary of a field geologist: "[i]n a few instances near the summits of the hills, the forest trees become so scattered, as to disclose here and there a rude mass, or a perpendicular precipice of gray sandstone, or compact limestone, the prevailing rocks in all this region."25 Just as Seymour in his landscapes advanced the expedition's scientific agenda where choice of subject was concerned, the science that he represented based some of its reading of the natural world on unabashedly aesthetic cate- gories of analysis. Thus Seymour's figure of an artist-scientist-explorer looking inward to describe the world was perhaps not so unscientific as it might at first appear. As Marcia Pointon has argued, what artists like Seymour and field geol- ogists like James shared was a language of picturesque description. Neither a strictly topographic mode of pictorial representation nor the language of rig- orously objective empirical description sufficed to convey the manifest evi- dence of geologic history. A more "painterly technique" was called for.26 Hills of the [Floetz] Trap Formation is in this respect a watercolor image quite typical of geologic landscapes of its era. Color and wash were added over penciled drawings on a sheet removed by Seymour from his sketchbook, a process apparently designed to preserve the immediacy of his original impres- sions. This transition from graphite field sketch to finished composition reca- pitulates the larger movement in the English-derived watercolor tradition beginning around 1760 from a rather linear military topographicism to a land- 25.

Born in England, or possibly Scotland, Seymour came to Philadelphia as a young man; by 1795 he had completed five plates for Thomas Dobson's American edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica. Subsequently he found employment in the shop of the influen- tial British-born engravers and artists William and Thomas Birch, executing some compositions of his own design but chiefly producing popular prints after paintings by others.28 Though Seymour was by no means prominent- in fact there is some evidence that, having reached middle age without mak- ing his professional mark, he viewed employment on the Long Expedition as an opportunity for advancement-he was not altogether unknown.29 As an associate member of the Society of Artists, Seymour had shown in annual exhibitions at the Pennsylvania Academy alongside the leading artists of his day, including William Rush, Thomas Sully, James and Rembrandt Peale, Alvan Fisher, Robert Salmon, Thomas Doughty, John Wesley Jarvis, and Thomas Birch, although none of his works from this period has survived.30 We can guess, however, from both the titles of works that he exhibited and his later expeditionary watercolors, that the pictorial conventions of the British picturesque, a style of representation with great commercial and artistic cur- rency in early republican Philadelphia, significantly informed his vision. 27. See Bruce Robertson, "Venit, Vidit, Depinxit: The Military Artist in America," in Nygren, Views and Visions, 83-104. William Gilpin (Three Essays: On Picturesque Beauty; On Picturesque Travel; and On Sketching Landscape; To Which Is AddedA Poem, On Landscape Painting [London, 1792], 62-66) recommended and justified this technique in an eighteenth-century British context (see text, below). 28.

(New York, 1907), 1:244, followed by Trenton and Hassrick, The Rocky Mountains, 347 n. 36. Robert D.

The city itself, though the nominal subject of the engraving, is visible only in the dis- tance as a diminutive array of masts and spires, viewed across a broad body of calm water in the midground that separates us from the world we are invited 31.

This spatial interruption is at once naturalized and rationalized- made narrative-by a party of elegantly attired picnickers underneath a pair of graceful trees that frame and center the view of distant wharves and buildings. The human presence in the immediate foreground of the image serves to ren- der the distant city psychologically accessible. But it is the discontinuity that in fact constitutes the view, making it visible, reminding us of where we stand in relation to the distance. Picturesque landscape theory received its classic formulation in the writ- ings of late-eighteenth-century British aestheticians, notably William Gilpin, whose works enjoyed wide circulation in America.32 Gilpin favored this same basic tripartite structuring of picture space.33 The titular subject of a composi- tion (whether hills by the base of the Rocky Mountains or the skyline of New York) was typically situated at a substantial distance from the picture plane and separated from the viewer (and so constructed as a visualizable entity) by an expanse of empty space. The subject was introduced and glossed by repoussoir figures whose presence serves in some sense to explain our own, and by whose attitudes and gestures our perceptions are informed. In such works a purely visual accessibility replaces actual accessibility, reverie actual penetration on the ground. Or, to state this in slightly different terms, good picturesque landscape makes its principal appeal not to the senses but to the imagination. In harbor views this was all well and good, serving to infuse a common- place scene with atmosphere. We can be reasonably certain, however, that Seymour's employers in the War Department-despite the ambiguities in his commission already alluded to-intended that he provide a set of reproducible watercolor images constituting a pictorial record of real access on the ground. In the words of Calhoun, who as secretary of war personally approved the hir- ing of both Seymour and Titian Peale (the latter responsible for scientific spec- imen studies): "The object of the Expedition, is to acquire as thorough and accurate knowledge as may be practicable, of a portion of our country ... as yet imperfectly known."34 These instructions seem incompatible, in principle if not in practice, with the picturesque talents of an artist like Seymour, whose 32.

The record is equivocal, but Calhoun probably agreed to include artists among the exhibitionary command because of a wish to serve the ends of science, linked as these were with territorial expansion; and an intui- tion of the potential political appeal of "authenticating imagery" in justifying both present and future expen- ditures on exploration. w 315</page><page sequence="14">316 KENNETH HALTMAN .. j ' ~.. . .. ...... ....... *' 1" ;"' _^^ , ,-. ;? _. ..

Such "telescopic pleasures of the eye," in Gilpin's words, were "very little allied to the pleasures of the painter," who relied instead on compositional devices whose function was to keep the distance at a distance.35 Seymour's View on the Arkansa[s] Near the Rocky Mountains (fig. 53), based on a field sketch executed in mid-July, suggests a contest between two modes of vision.36 Our view to the rounded cliff of reddish sandstone in the far midground lies across a body of water, presumably the Arkansas River, which transects the composition laterally. In combination with a line of trees posi- tioned further in the distance, this thin line of river interrupts our possible advance, dividing us from the wall of geologic rock we view.

In his treatise Three Essays: On Picturesque Beauty; On Picturesque Travel' and On Sketching Landscape, quoted earlier, Gilpin illustrates the case against overreliance on "the Beautiful" with a pair of exemplary contrasting images of the same scene, first without and then with "picturesque adornment." It is easy to recognize in the former (fig. 54) the underlying structure that Seymour, in View on theArkansa, has successfully mod- ified. The eye is engaged by the addition of "frictionalizing" passages of visual 37. Seymour makes his organizing presence more explicit still, placing his initials below the tall birch that alone spans picture space entirely, as the viewer is invited to do optically and in imagination. Compare these lines from Ralph Waldo Emerson's "Nature" (1836): "There is a property in the horizon which no man has but he whose eye can integrate all the parts, that is, the poet"-cited by W. J. T. Mitchell in "Imperial Landscape," his own essay in the anthology he recently edited, Landscape and Power (Chicago, 1994), 14. w- 317</page><page sequence="16">318 - KENNETH HALTMAN interest, and yet, for the sake of aesthetic appeal, regular symmetry has not been sacrificed entirely. This solution essentially conforms to Gilpin's recommenda- tion: the eye's passage is neither unimpeded nor impeded absolutely; but the viewer's principal (or at least most immediate) reward is the discovery of an in- teresting passage through picture space.38 The picturesque challenge Seymour's landscapes pose the viewer is in every way compatible with his commission, as it involves the viewer in the quiet drama of exploration, that of discovering a passage through picture space. In View Near the Base ofthe Rocky Mountains (fig. 55), a work dating to the first week in July 1820, the three small figures we come upon at foreground center, white men in brown expedition uniforms and black hats, bearing rifles, serve in this respect as our surrogates. They stand with their backs to us, gazing out across a grassy midground to a line of jutting rock formations rising in the middle distance.39 Beyond, dense and dully colored rolling hills extend to the far horizon. In a gap in the low foliage at foreground center, just behind these standing men and at our feet, a pool of pale blue water reflects the soft gray of the sky. In the middle distance, the overriding horizontality of the composition is broken by a pair of roughly centered vertical outcroppings of white basalt-framed by red sand- stone bluffs to their left and a rounded, tree-crested hillock to their right-that echo the men's figures at a considerable distance from the picture plane, antici- pating human entry into picture space. The pointing gesture of the figure far- thest to the right, most likely James, makes literal this formal repoussoir. Our gaze passes, as it were, over these three men's shoulders; we look where they look, imagine ourselves going where they seem to wish to go. But where? No obvious destination presents itself. We may well be "near the base of the Rocky Mountains," as the title indicates, scripted in the artist's hand beneath the image; but there are no "mountains" in view. There are any number of possible passages through this landscape, no one of them clearly preferable to the rest. As viewers we share a dilemma with the small figures who precede us: Which way to turn? The opposing curves of the enlisted men's upraised rifles on the left and James's pointing gesture on the right contribute to this lack of visual resolution. Together they form a figure of ambivalence, of hesitation. The drama of the image-a purely visual drama, picturesque in its essence-lies precisely here, in this uncertainty about location and direction. 38. Gilpin, Three Essays, 19. 39.

The body of blue water at our feet, exactly on the axis of our entry into pic- ture space, like the waters of the East River in View of the City ofNew York, re- inforces our separation from any but a visual sharing in the journey ahead. And indeed, if the Rocky Mountains can be said to appear anywhere in Seymour's composition, it is at our feet, in the words disingenuously scripted by the artist at the lower margin of his sheet, between ourselves and our explorer-surrogates and just adjacent to this pool of water-that is, not the "real" Rocky Mountains but those made available to us via his vision and our own reflection. Uncertainty about what lies off in the distance is, in other words, a pictur- esque technique enabling Seymour the better to engage his viewers in acts of vicarious contemplation. As Gilpin himself explained in "Instructions for Examining Landscape," his most frequently reprinted essay: "When we see a pleasing scene, we cannot help supposing, there are other beautiful appendages connected with it, tho' concealed from our view."

Gilpin describes the deception that results as "like the landscape of a dream."40 In the context of an expedition seeking "to acquire as thorough and accurate knowledge as may be practicable," however, what this figure takes as its true subject is the very possibility of knowing.41 In Seymour's image, James and his men stand in metonymically for us as viewers in our first encounter with an unknown world. We see the geologic fea- tures of the western landscape that they have come to study as they study them, sharing in what amounts to a community of longing for a better view than this View offers us. For this world has been arranged in such a manner as to render material and cognitive passage through it equally problematic. Ambiguous lines of access and discontinuities cast an air of doubt upon the ultimate adequacy of scientific mensuration to take hold of alien terrain-a Romantic challenge to empiricism, serving here to inscribe a picturesque formula with explicitly epis- temologic content. In strictly geologic terms, this image serves to introduce a whole series of Seymour's expeditionary watercolors by opening a panoramic window upon the principal formations discovered "Near the Base of the Rocky Mountains." The grouping of basaltic columns at midground center and sand- stone cliff at midground left-formations crucial to the theorizing about the origins of the earth-recur in a series of more detailed images, all dating to about the same period in early July. The contingency of this small white presence in the vast western landscape corresponds to the uncertainty and frustration recorded by James in his jour- nal and later published in the Account, owing in part to the roughness of the terrain, experienced as a discontinuity between visual and actual scale. "From our camp," he wrote, "we had expected to be able to ascend the most distant summits then in sight and return the same evening; but when night overtook us, we found ourselves scarcely arrived at the base of the mountains."42 He was furthermore aware of what was at stake, professionally as well as scientifically, in these investigations; that a "thorough acquaintance with [the] geological character [of the region] would, in all probability, lead to the most important 40.

As one reviewer wrote in 1823, "These volumes contain a very valuable body of facts respecting the natural history of the Western Country, and particularly its geology, a subject probably of greater interest than the geology of any other part of the world."47 Horace Hayden, writing in Baltimore's Methodist Recorder the following year, concurred: "[P]erhaps no country upon its surface affords a more suitable field for scien- tific research, or more ample opportunities, and numerous facts from which to form correct ideas . . . than the continent of North America."48 Although James was an anxious man by temperament, plagued with personal doubts exacerbated by worry about money and professional stand- ing,49 these were not the only or even the principal pressures that he felt. 43.

Portions of his introduction to this report were published only in the British edition of the Account, where he apologizes for a lack of theoretical sophistication, owed to "the unsettled and progressive condition of geognostic science" in general as well as to the par- ticular circumstances in which he was writing.50 The problem of interpret- ing ambiguous or conflicting evidence of geologic origins preoccupied James throughout the course of the expedition but did so particularly in July, when he was in closest proximity to the mountains, frustrated in his efforts to "phi- losophize" even from facts gathered through his own fieldwork. His instru- ments were inadequate; ironically, he fretted that his exercise in "actual observation" had put him out of touch with the "whims and notions" of contemporary geology.51 James also complained about how little opportun- ity he had been allowed by Long to study formations like those spread across the distant midground of View Near the Base of the Rocky Mountains. He felt that he simply needed more time to evaluate this evidence of the processes by which the earth had been formed-the heart of the most pressing geological debate of his generation, and the reason for the heightened international interest in his findings. Neptunian theory held that the surface of the earth had once been sub- merged entirely beneath a vast primeval ocean, out of which mineral deposits had precipitated and later been exposed when the waters receded. In the words of Abraham Gottlob Werner: "Our earth is a child of time and has been built up gradually"-that is, by sedimentation modified by gradual erosion.52 The "steep inclinations" we see James confronting in View Near the Base of the Rocky Mountains were but unusually dramatic instances of a class of geologic anomaly recognized for decades to pose the most decisive challenge to the Wernerian paradigm. Two explanations were offered to shore up this view, attributing these phenomena either to residual conformity to hypothetical foliations in the primitive rock or to slippages in the deposited precipitate, neither explanation 50.

Thus there emerged around the turn of the nineteenth cen- tury a competing paradigm known in its day as Plutonian or Vulcanian theory, which proposed that such anomalies were the result of violent upheavals caused by subterranean fire. This case was first put forth in a cogent fashion by James Hutton, who agreed with Werner that most geologic formations were best de- scribed as sedimentary but was convinced nonetheless that only the effects of violent fracture and dislocation could account for the available evidence. What the American West represented was the promise of decisive new evi- dence. James, obliged to take an interpretive stand in terms of this debate, lamented to friend and mentor Amos Eaton (whose own writings reveal both a debt to Werner's system of classification and the current skepticism toward his geognostic theories): "There are several extensive rocky formations which I have no name for and numerous facts so widely different from what I expected to find that I am at a loss to know how to talk about them."53 That summer Eaton had sent James page proofs of the revised edition of his own Index to the Geology of the Northern States, and James hastened to inform him that he had found the mountains themselves to be composed of primitive rock, a blow to the Wernerian position.54 But even this key discovery raised more questions than it answered. As James put it in the Account, although the "highly primitive character" of the Rocky Mountains did appear to prove Werner wrong, the evi- dence in support of the "igneous hypothesis" advanced by Hutton remained inconclusive.55 Furthermore, as James readily admitted to Eaton, "it was not in the mountains that my ignorance was most confounded." It was the terrain immediately subjacent to the mountains, interrupted by the very "range of naked perpendicular and lofty rocks" pictured by Seymour, that "presented the greatest variety of unexpected appearances, and facts which I have not ingenu- ity enough to reconcile with received opinions."56 53. Edwin James to Amos Eaton, 8 December 1820. 54. Eaton, who considered the composition of the mountains crucial to the ongoing debate, had written the previous March to Henry Rowe Schoolcraft, another former student, who had recently returned from a geo- logic survey of the Lake Superior copper region: "Have you any knowledge of the strata constituting Rocky Mountains? Is it primitive, or is it graywacke like Catskill Mountains? I have said, in a note, that, after you and Dr. E. James set foot upon it, we shall no longer be ignorant of it." See Henry Rowe Schoolcraft, Personal Memoir of a Residence of Thirty Years With the Indian Tribes on the American Frontiers (Philadelphia, 1851), 48. There is evidence that James too was reading Schoolcraft's report on the region's geology as he wrote his own. See Edwin James, "Notes of a part of the Expd. of Discovery Commanded by S. H. Long Maj.

As the columns evidence the steepest inclination, they attract and compel the greatest geologic interest. There is a human presence in this image as well, but one far more diminutive-a solitary soldier standing at attention, shouldering a rifle. Almost lost to view near the foot of the forma- tion, he symbolizes not human order and control so much as the will to human order and control. Titian Peale, the expedition's scientific illustrator, was apparently intrigued by this formation as well, for he executed a careful study of it from the identi- cal vantage and on the same occasion, Secondary Ridge of the Rocky Mts. just below the Platte (fig. 57), a work that has just recently come to light.57 Here again the nearly invisible figure of this soldier is positioned in the midground, just to the left of the composition's center, at once dwarfed by the enormous rock formation before which he stands and echoing its form. Peale's sketch is principally the study of a geologic curiosity appropriately centered in his com- position, his small soldier primarily a staffage element. Seymour's watercolor, read in the epistemologic context established by related Views, infuses his por- trait of this same "singular" formation with a suggestion of doubt regarding the ability of soldier-scientists to make sense of the geologic evidence it represents. In both of these treatments, the physical universe is ordered around symbols of applied intelligence-guns on the one hand, the human gaze on the other- but analytic achievement appears only tentative at best. This expression of epistemologic doubt becomes more apparent if we compare the geologic meditation embedded in the midground of Seymour's image (fig. 58) with the frontispiece to Robert Bakewell's highly influential Introduction to Geology (1813), a work we know that James, and so possibly Seymour, consulted during the expedition (fig. 59).58 This illustration of the summit of Cader Idris in North Wales, which depicts basaltic columns geo- logically identical to those in View Parallel to the Base, is described in the body of the text as "an interesting sketch of a group of columns taken by Henry Strutt, Esq. of Derby, with a camera lucida, which may be relied upon as a 57. The image appears in one of Titian Peale's expedition sketchbooks, five of which were donated to the Yale University Art Gallery in 1991 by Ramsay Macmullen, a collateral descendant of the artist. 58.

Bakewell explained this introduction of a human figure into a geologic sketch as providing "a Figure 58. Detail of figure 56, Vew Parallel tend srahr *.to the Base. standard of comparison"the classic application of staffage in geologic landscape, as a mensural device. But the figure furthermore represents and so serves to naturalize a specifically human standard of comparison and scale. The ideological (here an epistemological) subtext suggests the assertion of rational control over chaotic nature.60 Seymour's compositional arrangement tends rather to foreground the uncertainty of mensuration, understanding, and control. In light of James's concerns, this image-along with others Seymour pro- duced that season-serves to portray the field investigations that it represents with remarkable accuracy, even sensitivity. In one sense Seymour's achievement was quite simple: merely picturing the geologic work that he observed-and, more specifically, his colleague's struggle to arrive at geologic understanding- as he saw it, picturesquely. But beyond this, the effortless match between Seymour's compositional technique and geology as subject matter points to the existence of broader structural and even philosophical affinities between these two realms of cultural production. View Parallel to the Base of the Rocky Mountains as history painting, as historical portraiture, reveals much about the particular conditions of a single, albeit crucial, field investigation. As illustra- tion it reports the scientific evidence that this investigation gathered; but, as geologic landscape, the image combines these empirical ambitions and tran- scends them, rendering its occasion-the travails of James, the geologic features of the western landscape-in some sense paradigmatic, thematizing the process of geologic inquiry itself. 59.

As an anonymous reviewer had written with regard to the two schools of understanding in Philadelphia's Analect Magazine in the spring of 1817, "neither will suffice alone."61 Arguments in favor of each theory relied heavily on guesswork, and indeed the debate was waged as a skirmish in a wider methodological conflict over the role of hard evidence versus speculation.62 The discourse of geological science was marked by the same ambivalent devotion to fieldwork-and acknowledgment of necessary recourse to "the wilds of fancy"-captured in Seymour's Long Expedition imagery.63 In a review of William Maclure's generally acclaimed Observations on the Geology ofthe United States (1817), Constantine Samuel Rafinesque condemned imaginative speculation outright, declaring that such theorizing constituted "the novels of geology rather than its history."64 In a separate review of Eaton's Index to the Geology of the Northern States, Rafinesque went on to propose that "when the speculations of geogony are deduced from history, records, data, remains, analogies, and phenomena, they become a sort of geologic history; but all those which emanate from suppositions, conjectures, fictions, presumptions, probabilities and plausible causes, are at best but ingenious dreams, particularly when they attempt to embrace the origin and the end of our globe."65 Maclure, who was president of the influential Philadelphia Academy of the Natural Sciences, agreed that the pitfalls for those who would decipher evidence of the earth's origin lay not in speculation per se but in imagination deployed prema- turely or in lieu of fieldwork. His Observations on the Geology ofthe United States expressed a pragmatic compromise between the two positions.66 It was best to begin with the evidence available and then to limit one's conjectures to those stemming from rational analogy: "In all speculation on the origin, or agents that have produced the changes on this globe, it is probable that we ought to keep 61.

His concerns, as much methodological as theoretical in nature, led him to resolve this debate for himself in eminently moderate fashion: embrace physical evidence insofar as possible, "until we come to the last crust, beyond which we cannot penetrate; then we must drop the thread of positive analogy, and ... be content with probable conjecture."68 But some found such conjec- ture heretical, anticipating the religiously motivated polemics that would become more common later in the century. In 1824, Hayden convened his "Inquiry into Some of the Geological Phenomena To Be Found in Various Parts of America, and Elsewhere"-otherwise a hardheaded survey of the cur- rent literature regarding the geology of the United States-with the following pronouncement: "The structure of the globe which we inhabit, and the infi- nitely varied features, either moral or physical, which are presented to human view in almost every district upon its surface, afford a subject for contempla- tion, that far transcends the feeble capacity of man perfectly to comprehend." Three installments and four months later, he proposed rather desperately that, while there was some worth at least in both Wernerian and Huttonian theory, in the discussion of their merits, it may be asserted, without fear of contradiction, that he who attempts to explain, on the principles of either, the infinitely varied phenomena that are presented to view, in the structure of the globe; or he who attempts to reconcile the equally numerous and varied anom- alies, glaring inconsistencies, palpable contradictions, and inexplicable facts, alike to those principles, will find himself, at last, involved in a labyrinth, so inconceivably intricate, that it will be impossible to extricate himself except by plunging headlong, as many have already done, into infidelity.69 In preference to struggling with "inexplicable facts," one could turn either to contemplation in the higher sense, submission to unknowable divinity; or, in the more secular world of mainstream science, to reasoned speculation.

When James described the Floetz Trap formations as being in "appearance and position . . . such as to lead almost involuntarily those least attached to visionary theories into speculations con- cerning their origin,"72 his restraint echoes theirs. As Eaton had explained in an essay published a year prior to the expedition, while theory may be deducible from "a great number of facts," without theory "serving as a basis whereon to collate the facts" there can be no understanding of the world's "hidden designs," though these might not themselves prove easily "susceptible to demonstration."73 Despite voices at each end of the spectrum, most geolo- gists by the time James reached the mountains had embraced some version of this same productive pragmatism, structuring field study in terms of an oper- ative theory and yet remaining flexible enough to modify this conceptual framework wherever necessary in response to anomalous data. It was a com- promise singularly well suited to Seymour's own Romantic pragmatism-a reliance on the imaginative reconstruction of observed reality.74 We might describe the methodological and theoretical preoccupations of the age as marked by what Kuhn has termed consensual as opposed to crisis science.75 The participants in the debate were dedicated to the most compre- hensive fieldwork-with an obsessively nationalist and positivist enthusiasm for filling in blanks in the geologic map-and at the same time resigned to 70.

This complicated balance between facts on the one hand and ideas on the other, on material and on abstract realms of understanding, on the particular and on the general, takes form in Seymour's geologic landscapes compositionally and aesthetically as a nego- tiated middle ground between the correspondingly opposed imperatives of topographic realism (what we see in the middle distance of his watercolors) and a proto-Romantic picturesque (the way this realistic vision foregrounds, even thematizes, its own artifice). Recognition of this compatibility in ways of seeing sheds new light on underlying commonalities between art and science in the early republican age. That these forms of mutually reinforcing cultural practice should be characterized, each in its own way, by a synthesis of simi- larly competing cognitive modes, transcriptive and inscriptive respectively, leads the way as well to a better historicized and more nuanced understanding of these watercolors themselves, whose governing thematics-origins, origina- tion-determined by the interests of at least two disciplines, can now be seen to resonate in broad, perhaps unexpected, ways. Seymour's View of Castle Rock on a Branch of the Arkansa[s] at the Base of the Rocky Mountains, known only in a black-and-white engraving by William Hay in the Philadelphia edition of the Account (fig. 60),76 seems on its surface a conventionally, even formulaic, picturesque response to one of the many unusual geologic formations encountered in the magical terrain through which the expedition found itself passing all that July. James opens his own discus- sion of this particular lusus nature using technical language designed to make sense of its strangeness in generic terms: it was another in a class of high per- pendicular hills, "sometimes disposed in parallel but interrupted ranges, and sometimes irregularly scattered without any appearance of order." He describes Castle Rock and other similar formations as the "remains" of an underlying bed of sandstone "preserved from disintegration while the contiguous parts 76.

It has columns, and porticoes, and arches, and, when seen from a distance, has an astonishingly regular and arti- ficial appearance."

We learn from another member of the party, John Bell, that it was Long who christened this formation Castle Rock (and the rivulet by which it stood Castle Rock Creek), owing in part to the prominence of its "emplacement."79 Representation of castles was indeed a staple of picturesque production. Gilpin declared that "among all the objects of art, the picturesque eye is per- haps most inquisitive after the elegant relics of ancient architecture; the ruined tower, the Gothic arch, the remains of Castles, and abbeys. These are the rich- est legacies of art. They are consecrated by time; and almost deserve the ven- eration we pay to the works of nature itself."80 The taste for palatial ruins reflected in Seymour's Castle Rock appears earlier in his oeuvre-for instance in his view of Loch Leven (fig. 61), engraved in 1811 for Pinkerton's Voyages and Travels. But a painting (or here an engraving) of a naturally occurring simu- lacrum of a ruin poses a special problem of interpretation. What we gaze upon in Castle Rock is not a cultural form overwhelmed by nature like Loch Leven- one of those "vainglorious relics" whose absence was among the distinguishing features of American as opposed to European landscape81-but a natural form (residual basalt) with an arguable resemblance to a cultural form (here a castle) overwhelmed by nature. The theme is not vanitas, the triumph of death, so much as mimesis, the triumph of artifice. The seductiveness of this subject mat- ter-nature simulating ruins-for the artist has to do with its "naturalization" of the powers of dissemblance. Here, in a dizzying originary mise en abime, a cultural form overwhelmed by natural forces is imitated by a natural formation that is then imitated in a work of art-rock castle, castle rock. (Philadelphia, 1814), yet another of the works the expedition carried. See, for example, in History of the Expedition, the description of bluffs along the Missouri by Meriwether Lewis in his entry for 31 May 1805; or, for a modern transcription, The Journals of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, ed. Gary E. Moulton, 11 vols. (Lincoln, Neb., 1983-97), 3:225-26. The choice of Seymour's Castle Rock for reproduction in the American edition of the Account can be explained by the curiosity that it was certain to arouse, but also by the satisfac- tion it was equally certain to evoke in an audience eager for knowledge of the far West yet aesthetically con- ditioned to understand grandeur in formal terms as European, as "antique." 79.

In its expeditionary context, Seymour's Castle Rock is a form of history painting, serving as a potent visual reminder of the political cataclysm and antiroyalist revolution out of which the nation had emerged. It is a visual alle- gory featuring an outmoded European institution in decline and, as such, a nationalist recuperation of its symbolic power.82 Here Nature replaces History as a token of legitimate-that is to say, original-authority. Not a week before, the "great national festival" had been celebrated by an "examination of the mountains" accompanied by "a pint of maize and small portion of whiskey" for each man.83 In Seymour's hands, the picturesque, itself a kind 82. Seymour's most successful works to date were celebrations of American military victory over the British. His Brilliant Naval Victory (1812), a copperplate engraving depicting the victory of the U.S. Constitution over the English frigate Guerriere on 20 August 1812, and his depiction of Andrew Jackson's victory over British forces in the Battle of New Orleans in 1815, distributed in the form of an aquatint by James W. Steel, both enjoyed wide popularity. 83. Account, 1:496; 15:275. Bell's Journal contains an exuberant, patriotic account of this commemoration of "the birthday of liberty" (p. 159).

The same trope serves the ends of histor- ical allegory as well, figuring the past as origin first toward and then away from which one travels in a quest for meaning.85 Seymour's View of the Chasm through which the Platte Issues from the Rocky Mountains (fig. 62) records the expedition's arrival at the mountains on 6 July 1820. It is best known in its published form as an aquatint by Isaac Clark that appeared as a frontispiece to sometimes one, sometimes another volume of the English edition of the Account. We stand before a triangular cliff-face at mid- ground center, formed where two mountains come together; from the base of the cliff, the waters of the South Platte flow in the direction of the picture plane.86 Although this chasm or narrow gorge is situated at both the thematic and the geomorphic center of the composition, our position with respect to it is left tenuous. The subtle vertical striation of the cliff-face turns to lateral stria- tion on the surface of the water, reinforcing our sense of its flow in our direc- tion, inhibiting movement toward the chasm where the river rises. As in the roughly contemporary View Near the Base of the Rocky Mountains (see fig. 55), we are left, seemingly, with nowhere to go. Here, however, our desire to enter picture space is actively resisted by the steady current as well as topographic disruptions and visual discontinuities. 84. On the picturesque as a form of political discourse, see Ann Bermingham, Landscape and Ideology, 57-85; see also Bermingham, "System, Order, and Abstraction: The Politics of English Landscape Drawing around 1795," in Mitchell, Landscape and Power, 77-101. 85. On the Map of the Country Drained by the Mississippi prepared by Long in 1822, based on the expedition's findings and first published in the Account, a small drawing of a castle appears at just this point, marking the expedition's farthest westward penetration. 86. James describes the Platte at the foot of the mountains as measuring some "twenty-five yards wide, having an average depth of about three feet; its water cear and cool, and its current rapid" (Account, 2:3; 15:289). He mentions elsewhere (1:406; Philadelphia edition only) that a drawing "taken on the spot by Mr. Seymour, of which an engraving has been made for our Journal" displayed "some of the prominent features of this peculiar formation." While an engraving after this work was not in fact included in the Philadelphia atlas, Seymour's drawing did serve as the basis for the aquatint that I discuss here, later published in the London edition. v 335</page><page sequence="34">336 KENNETH HALTMAN Figure 62.

Edwin James, Account of an Expedition from Pittsburgh to the Rocky Mountains (London, 1823), frontispiece to volume 1. Huntington Library. This visual sense of frustrated entry has its correlative in the uneasy progress of the expedition. "At eleven o'clock," James recounts, "we arrived at the boundary of that vast plain, across which we had held our weary march for a distance of near one thousand miles," there only to discover looming above their heads "a range of naked and almost perpendicular rocks resembling a vast wall."87 An exploratory party led by James was soon exhausted; he and his men found their way obstructed by "impenetrable and naked rocks," forced even- tually to conclude that the barrier was "too hilly and broken to penetrate."88 His description of the view from below conveys this same sense of thwarted penetration: "This extensive range, rising abruptly from the plain, skirts the base of the mountains like an immense rampart, and to a spectator placed near it, intercepts the view of the still more grand and imposing features of the 87.

James likens the chasm, beside which the expedition encamped, "to a close line of palisades placed within, and closing the passage which seemed to promise an entrance into the mountains."90 While James's frustration resulted from his sense of inability to gain suf- ficient access to these key basaltic and granitic features, compelling yet elu- sive evidence of geologic history, Seymour's image, directing one's attention to the sheer cliff-face at midground center, thematizes inaccessibility itself. In this, View of the Chasm through which the Platte Issues from the Rocky Moun- tains strains the conventions of the picturesque, pursuing the strategy of rendering viewer access problematic to such an extent that the aesthetic of controlled irregularity we have seen to govern other of Seymour's expedition images veers dramatically away from the beautiful (with its stress on control) toward the sublime (with its stress on irregularity). Its composition invites in the viewer classically Burkean feelings of frustrated desire, owing to a com- bination of difficult access, vastness, and the presence of dramatic hidden forces beyond human comprehension. Picturesque landscape painting in this period has been described as embodying an "aesthetic of accommodation" confirming both the artist's and the viewer's sense of being in "interpretive control."91 At its most basic, the subject matter of such landscape painting is not land itself but the translation of land into landscape that it seems pos- sible to visit and know. Where the conventional structures of control have been impaired, as here, the picturesque becomes the subject more than just the style of representation, and the failure to achieve control itself becomes thematic. The term "chasm" in Seymour's title, taken directly from James, suggests that the headwaters he represents suggest a vortex of barely con- tained energies.92 89. Account, 2:1, 15:286. 90.

In a scientific paper that he presented after the expedition, James offers a more explicit sublime construction of this topos of originary issuance. He cites reports of "a deep and wide chasm in the side of a mountain out of which flames and smoke have often been seen to issue."

Visual impediments, as elsewhere in Seymour's geologic illustrations, at once compel one to see and yet reduce one to seeing at a distance, making con- templation a necessary virtue. In an essay with the almost humorously cautious title, "Some Speculative Conjectures on the Probable Changes that May Have Taken Place in the Geology of the Continent of North America East of the Stoney Mountains," published shortly after the appearance of the Account, Maclure cites the example of "a river running between two precipices of rock in a deep channel" as one that inspired a turn to reverie, an "utmost stretch of imagination," concerning geologic origins.93 In this he merely echoes James, who had noted: "It is difficult when contemplating the present situation and appearance of these rocks, to prevent the imagination from wandering back to that remote unascertained period, when the billows of a primeval ocean lashed the base of the Rocky Mountains."94 93.

Such gynomorphic figuration abounds in the Account. Seymour merely pursues the metaphor, finding topographic means to further sexualize the experience of failed penetration and frustrated entry by figuring the chasm as natural vagina, font of originary issuance. The gynomorph is futhermore strikingly complete, with swells of mountain slope at right and left like rounded thighs of earth framing a triangular mons, mountain peaks in the distance uplifted like breasts, and river water breaking like amniotic fluid in a birth canal.96 In 1820 such usage would have had one likely source in the similarly gendered language of a flourishing travel literature,97 and another in the plates embellishing those accounts. Seymour had himself engraved at least one such plate, Sheelins in Jura and a Distant View of the Paps (fig. 63), published in Pinkerton's Voyages and Travels a decade earlier, representing an Alpine mountain range whose name of course already suggested its analogy with female breasts.98 When 95.

Paul Shepard, in Man in the Landscape: A Historical View of the Esthetics of Nature (1967; reprint, 1991, College Station, Tex.), records connections between the female body and land- scape (99-100), notably those made by Sigmund Freud, who proposed that, in the language of the dream, the female sexual organs, because of their "complicated" topography, "are often represented by a landscape with rocks, woods, and water," the mons veneris a mountain formation located within what he termed the "primary landscape" of the mother's body. Shepard also cites Gertrude Rachel Levy, who notes in The Gate of Horn; A Study of the Religious Conceptions of the Stone Age and Their Influence upon European Thought (London, 1948), that a mountain profile is frequently symbolic of more figurative passage, of birth or rebirth. The source of such figuration in aesthetic theory-and the implicitly feminine gendering of "the Beautiful"-is readily apparent from a comparison of Seymour's View of the Chasm with Gilpin's View without Picturesque Adornment (figure 4, above). 97. Biddle's official history of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, for example (as noted previously, another text carried on the Long Expedition), describes the discovery of the source of the Missouri in the following terms: "They had now reached the hidden sources of that river, which had never yet been seen by civilized man; and as they quenched their thirst at the chaste and icy fountain .... they felt themselves rewarded for all their labours and all their difficulties" (Biddle, History of the Expedition, 1:359, 12 August 1805). 98. Precedent for such gynomorphism may be seen, for example, in eighteenth-century picturesque landscape gar- dening in Britain. Sir Francis Dashwood, in perhaps the most notorious example, is said to have "laid out the gardens" of his country house at West Wycombe "by a curious arrangement of streams, bushes and plantation to represent the female form"; see The Victoria History of the Counties ofEngland, 5 vols. (1925; reprint, London, 1969), 3:135. William Woollet is said to have captured this curiosity in 1757 in a series of four engravings (including A View of the Walton Bridge, Venuss Temple, &amp;c. in the Garden of Sr. Francis Dashwood Bart. at West Wycombe in the County of Bucks) after paintings of the park by William Hannan (see the entry for Francis Dashwood in the Dictionary of National Biography); yet his visual allusions prove more elusive than those in View of the Chasm-my thanks to Stephanie Ross for these references (personal correspondence, 28 August 1991).

The first pic- ture shall be a view of a streamlet issuing from a dark cave &amp; pursuing its course between banks adorned with flowers &amp; graceful trees . . . Over the mouth of the cave will be an inscription in the rock-'Life issues from the womb of dark oblivion."'99 Seymour's geo-metaphoric figure in View of the Chasm lends the perception of frustrated penetration an epistemological resonance as well. Our gaze and our imagination are constrained to pass over the surface of the water between river banks, directed to the point of river birthing where all lines converge-pre- cisely where such vision is proscribed. We are thus held at an uneasy distance from the object of desire figured as a woman's body, open-legged and life-giving, an earth mother from which river water issues, Cole's "womb of dark oblivion," a voyeur's sublime. The longing for access to origins so central to the art and the science of the age takes the form here of longing for a "maternal-primitive" that, in Susan Stewart's phrase, "has never existed except as narrative" and thus must ever remain inaccessible."100 In historical terms, the potent mix of prohibition and desire at the crux of Seymour's image visually deconstructs the imperial drama in which the expedi- tion played a part. Its implicit narrative discloses the fundamental sense in which the upper Missouri basin as a geopolitical region-economically (as a source of goods, especially furs, and markets) as well as geologically (as a source of infor- mation)-originated at the source of its westernmost river. The chasm in this respect is the appropriate endpoint to the expedition's "weary march" up the Platte.101 Knowledge gathered here would address the interests of expansionism symbolically, as a signifier of the west's abundance and, more subtly, as a chal- lenge to those who would possess or merely gauge its riches. Seymour's depiction of this source in View of the Chasm plays on the longings for possession that it prompts by sexualizing both the promise and the challenge that the mountains 99.

James's frustration at the "impenetrability" of the mountains has once again its visual correlative in pictorial (here sublime) irregularity, engaging the eye in the desire to know. Evelyn Fox Keller has characterized the scientific method itself as the col- lective means worked out by men of the Enlightenment for dealing with uneasiness and guilt in response to systematic violations of visual (or natural) taboo. Drawing a parallel identical to the one Seymour suggests between the secrets of nature and those of women, Keller concludes that, in modern Europe at least, secrets of both sorts "have traditionally been seen by men as potentially either threatening-or alluring-simply by virtue of the fact that they articu- late a boundary that excludes them."102 The proleptic response to such anxiety has been the presumption by males of the powers of creation, a rescription of "natural processes" that is as typical of scientists as it is of artists. The example of Charles Lyell, the noted British geologist and James's exact contemporary, may be instructive. Rudwick reminds us of Lyell's invocation of the words of historian Barthold Georg Niebuhr: "He who calls what has vanished back again into being, enjoys a bliss like that of creating."103 Maclure also suggested the creative power of geological theorizing in 1817, in his Observations on the Geology of the United States, a book both James and Seymour knew. Maclure proposed that "the pleasure of indulging the imagination" was "superiour to that derived from the labour and drudgery of observation," and this he attrib- uted to "the self-love of mankind ... flattered by the intoxicating idea of act- ing a part in the creation."104 Seymour too, as we have seen, took pleasure in asserting the "originality" of his artistic vision, which explains in part his interest in this topos of creative issuance. His resistance to the mimetic function of topographic realism was part and parcel of the picturesque conventions within which and against which he worked. But Seymour, in this refiguring of source as chasm, resists the power of artistic precedent as much as he does "truth to nature." The vaginal font through which energy issues forth into the space of representation appears not as a source but as a wall of blockage-not as the culmination of a process 102.

The chasm of the birth canal itself, the gap through which the waters of the Platte are said to issue, remains undiscernible in Seymour's rendering. We see instead a picture plane within the picture plane, a sort of tabula rasa, as if creation somehow took place at the surface of the image.105 Thus the process of artis- tic making is rescripted here by Seymour as a spontaneous emergence of con- trolled creative impulse, an act of genius, occluding the actual origins not just of his own representation but of the river as well. For Seymour, by choosing to depict the chasm at a middle distance, from a slight prominence to the southeast, obscured and so mystified this originary flow quite deliberately. James, on his reconaissance, had managed to get a clear view of the chasm from above, discovering that the Platte, to the west of its "emergence"-beyond the chasm as it appears in Seymour's image-was formed by the confluence of two smaller rivers, whereupon it "turn[ed] abruptly to the S.E., bursting through a chasm in a vast mural precipice of naked columnar rock." Peale accompanied this party and returned with a sketch.106 Seymour, however, turned aside this ready-made sublime, finding means instead to pic- ture his pictorial authority. The waters that originate at center midground of his composition, flowing to the east in our direction, represent the process of artis- tic mediation: a personal experience of topographic fact emerges at the picture plane, remade as new. Such hydrogeologic imagery is visionary, itselfa source of reverie through which the viewer's tendency to "wander a little in the wilds of fancy" is encouraged and indulged. The history of early republican ideas is marked by an obsessive interest in origi- nal creation.107 A national prehistory had to be formulated commensurate with the promise of the new, and ethnologists were as much involved in this project 105. Bryan Jay Wolf has read Frederic Church's 1855 landscape The Andes of Ecuador similarly, as creating "a myth of itself as self-begotten"; see "A Grammar of the Sublime, or Intertextuality Triumphant in Church, Turner, and Cole," New Literary History 16 (winter 1985): 322. 106. Account, 2:6; 15:292. 107. This theme recurs in Washington Irving's The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent. (1819-20), serial- ized during the expedition, and in James Fenimore Cooper's The Prairie, which appeared in 1823, shortly after the party's return, importantly influenced by the Account.

These two concerns were brought together by Seymour in a water- color known, improbably, as Sketch on the Upper Missouri (fig. 64), with the same setting as View ofthe Chasm (see fig. 62).108 Here, contact between culture and nature-known and unknown-is suggested allegorically in an under- stated encounter between stylized Indian, to our left, and member of the expe- ditionary party (perhaps Thomas Say, the expedition's zoologist) to our right, in the looming presence of this same basic gynomorphic configuration. 108. James reports that Seymour executed 150 field sketches over the course of the expedition, 60 of which he "completed" in watercolor in 1822 (Account, 2:330n; 17:93n). Of these only 14 are extant today, suggesting (given the importance of its iconographic differences) that the aquatint of View of the Chasm (fig. 62), which appeared in the English edition of the Account, may have been based on a related watercolor dis- patched to the English publisher, Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme, and Brown, along with other of Seymour's works, and perhaps never repatriated. u- 343</page><page sequence="42">344 KENNETH HALTMAN Figure 65. Detail of figure 64, View of the Chasm, with Figures. As is clear from the record, no such event actually took place. Seymour employs this overdetermined figure of the source as the symbolic setting for a myth that he propounds of fresh beginnings in a new world-an Edenic moment of reconciliation across gulfs of difference. By depicting the gap through which the Platte issues from the Rocky Mountains not as "waters bursting through a chasm" but as a smooth uninterrupted flow, emblematic once again of birth and of rebirth, Seymour visually transforms the river's rush between the rocks into a single point of origin, and so refigures what might have been an image of irreconcilable difference-two men on opposite sides of a chasmic divide-into the shallow, continuous curve of what resembles the far shore of a body of still water (fig. 65)-a visual metaphor of possible connec- tion, not unlike "the landscape of a dream." 344 - KENNETH HALTMAN</page><page sequence="43">SAMUEL SEYMOUR'S LANDSCAPES OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS Figure 66. Cliffi ofRed Sandstone Near the Rocky Mountains (1822); watercolor over graphite on paper. 14.5 x 20.5 cm. Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library. A similarly dreamlike atmosphere, suggestive of the oneirism underlying geological perceptions, figures in Seymour's Cliffs of Red Sandstone Near the Rocky Mountains (fig. 66). This image portrays three men engaged in geologi- cal investigation at a considerable distance from the picture plane, accompa- nied by pack horses or mules. Despite their diminutive size, as in other of Seymour's images these men are not lost within the world he represents but instead provide its focus, located as they are precisely where the composition's three defining spatial axes-the vertical left edge of a large rectangular cliff- face, the horizontal limit of the midground at its base, and the viewer's line of vision-intersect. In Cartesian terms, their presence marks the watercolor's origin, at once its central point and source of visual and logical coherence. This underlying structure of coordinate planes is made visible by the presence of these human figures, whose analytic systems and ambitions it reflects. - 345</page><page sequence="44">346 KENNETH HALTMAN The presence of scientist-explorers at the composition's spatial origin works once again to reconcile geology and painting, suggesting the family relation be- tween two visionary efforts to make culture out of nature. Seymour's scientists, viewed literally on the move at center stage, engage in this work explicitly, pur- suing "truth" into a realm of wilder nature lying off and out of sight at midground left-into the Rocky Mountains, understood as pure unknown- with only reason (and a few hypotheses) to guide them, a symbolic passage that epitomizes Seymour's art as well. Both formally and coloristically, these care- fully positioned figures are shown moving from a realm of rectilinear red char- acterized by observed geological detail to one of green, organic, mammillary smoothness-from a world that has, in some respect, been processed by the mind to one as yet unknown. This movement of science into nature parallels the movement "into nature" of artistic process, what Alexander Pope termed "nature methodized." The eponymous "cliff of red sandstone" gives visual form to the conceptual apparatus governing expeditionary science, with its basis in mathematics, as well as to that governing Seymour's own artistry. Here he em- ploys geometry, or "earth measure," as trope to help us make sense of what we see, the red cliff echoing the watercolor's own rectangularity. The signs of pre- historic cataclysm in the rock face have been quietly reduced to a rectangular blank slate, like the central triangle in View of the Chasm, ready for scientific and artistic inscription. Seymour's geologic landscapes would have appealed to readers trained by picturesque convention to appreciate the previously unexperienced as compre- hensible when framed and distanced. It is likely that these images would have appealed as well to a populace of amateur geologists prepared to recognize the formations pictured both as keys to the important geogenic questions of the day and as assertions of the centrality of American investigations to world-class intellectual debate.109 In Seymour's work this question of national identity is posed as a matter of epistemology, the authenticating evidence of original cre- ation being inscribed upon the surface of the world, a nationalist mythos and an aesthetic one as well. As Alan Trachtenberg has noted, "Geological knowl- edge permits, indeed insists upon, the superimposition of one picture upon 109.

Unfortunately, there was essentially no mention of Seymour's illustrations in any contemporary reviews, although Charles Willson Peale both praised and copied several of them.

This additional factor in perception-let us call it geological imagina- tion-results in a doubled vision."110 Seymour's expeditionary watercolors are scientific illustrations with a difference, for they serve to thematize as well as to illustrate the work of geology, framing the positivist pretensions of scientific description in terms of picturesque relativity-as the products of "geological imagination."
