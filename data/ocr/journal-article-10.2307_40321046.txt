<plain_text><page sequence="1">Rethinking the Validity and Significance of Final Causation: From the Aristotelian to the Peircean Teleology Henry Wang The critical role of final causation in Peirce's pragmatism has not received appropriate attention of most contemporary scholars. This is for the most part a result of the cultural dominance of mechanical explanation on the basis of efficient causation and a general antipathy toward the concept of final causation or xêXoÇç in modern thought. As we will see, this antipathy toward final causation stems from a different understanding of causation since the beginning of the modern age. It reflects different world systems envisaged by the ancient and modern thinkers. Despite all modern antipathies and prejudices against it, however, final causation demonstrates increasingly its importance in contemporary scientific and philosophical discourse. It shows itself as something that cannot be completely dropped. As Ernst Mayr acknowledges, a growing number of scientists, especially biologists, continue to insist not only that "teleological statements are objective... but also that they express something important which is lost when teleological language is eliminated from such statements."1 At the same time, the insufficiency of mechanical explanation on the basis of efficient causation has instigated a number of modern philosophers to reclaim the efficacy of final causation. Peirce is among the few modern philosophers who argue strongly against the neglect of final causation. "The non- recognition of final causation," Peirce asserts, "has been and still is productive of more philosophical error and nonsense than any or every other source of error or nonsense. If there is any goddess of nonsense, this must be her haunt" (MS 478, 1903).2 This paper intends to rethink the validity and significance of final causation in the context of Peirce's pragmatism. In what follows, I shall first address some modern prejudices against final causation so as to show the plausibility and coherence of Aristotle's teleology. I will then try to bring to light the essential difference between the Aristotelian and the modern concepts of causation. The recognition of this difference will throw a new light on the Transactions of the Charles S. Peirce Society Summer, 2005, Vol. XLI, No. 3</page><page sequence="2">604 Henry Wang meanings of Peirce's pragmatism and developmental teleology and will provide a starting point to reevaluate the validity and significance of final causation. I. Modern Prejudices Against Final Causation As T.L. Short points out, "the classical conception of teleology, found in Plato's dialogues and perhaps earlier still, was most clearly formulated by Aristotle."3 For Aristotle, final cause is the "end or that for the sake of which a thing is done, e.g., health is the final cause of walking about."4 Final cause is the kind of cause that, together with three other kinds of cause, namely, material, formal and efficient cause, answers the "why" question of a thing. It must be noticed that these four kinds of cause are not four causes isolated from each other such that all belong to the explanation of a thing like pieces belonging to something composite, one of which might sometimes be missing. Rather, they express different "ways in which the term 'cause [aixia\ is used"5 and are always woven together for any causal explanation of things. Thus, efficient cause and final cause are not isolated from each other but belong together in all causal explanations. They are not mutually exclusive, but only speak of different aspects of the "why" of a thing; jointly, they make the full explanation of something possible. The separation of efficient cause and final cause, along with the distinction between mechanical explanation and teleological explanation in modern thought, stems from a breakup of the inherent unity of the four kinds of cause. The breakup of this unity of causal relations occurs in medieval thought. The four kinds of cause are first reduced to formal and material cause, and these two are again reduced to efficient cause alone.6 The breakup of this unity, as a result of which final causation is dropped out and forgotten, anticipates an utterly different understanding of causation in modern thought. The rethinking of the validity and significance of final causation entails a careful examination of its meaning in Aristotle's teleology and a proper recognition of the difference between the Aristotelian and the modern concepts of causation. Before that, let us examine first some modern prejudices against final causation so as to give a preliminary justification of its plausibility and validity. One of the major difficulties that thwart contemporary scientists and philosophers granting final causes the status of "real" causes is the prima facie tension between the concept of final causation and the temporal order of causal relations. How can something in the future, something that does not really exist yet, exert any influence on present things? In order to resolve this tension, it is necessary to distinguish two kinds of final cause: final cause as that for which and as that towards which, or final cause as a purpose and as an end.7 The former is said of human beings and possibly animals, of beings with consciousness; the latter is said not only of beings with consciousness but of inanimate things as well.</page><page sequence="3">Rethinking the Validity and Significance of Final Causation 605 Peirce regards it "a widespread error to think that a 'final cause' is necessarily a purpose." For "a purpose is merely that form of final cause which is most familiar to our experience" (1.211). Many contemporary scholars, however, fail to distinguish clearly between a purpose and an end and repeatedly identify teleological phenomena with purposeful phenomena, or with what Mayr calls "goal-directed" processes. "If 'teleological' means anything," says Mayr, "it means 'goal -directed.'"8 Although Mayr asserts that "'goal-directed' is not necessarily the same as purposive,"9 he does not maintain a clear distinction between final cause as a purpose and as an end in his discussion. The word "goal" is ambiguous and its relations to the concepts of purpose and end remain uncertain. The reliance upon this everyday concept for the interpretation of the Aristotelian teleology has brought about a number of confusions in the analysis of some influential contemporary scholars such as Mayr and Cooper.10 For example, Mayr's rejection of natural selection as a teleological process is based upon the assumption that natural selection cannot be purposeful, and thus cannot be directed toward any specific goals.11 Granted, it does not make sense to posit a particular conscious purpose for natural selection. But natural selection may well be directed toward such general ends as "survival or reproductive success."12 The ambiguity and vagueness of the concept of "goal-directed" has eclipsed the distinction between final cause as a purpose and as an end in Mayr's analyses. Let us examine the validity of these two kinds of final cause one by one. The justification of final cause as a purpose incurs no serious problem, provided that we distinguish between the fulfillment of a purpose and the presence of a purpose. All purposes are human ideals or ideas. It is the presence of these ideas in human minds that have physical effects on present things, but not the fulfillment of these ideas. Thus, there is no temporal disorder between human purposes and their effects. For example, in building a house, the purpose is to provide a receptacle and shelter for human beings and goods. Now the fulfillment of this purpose, i.e., the actual establishment of a house, which is a future event, should indeed have no influence on the present things. But before people start to build the house, there must be in their minds already the purpose of providing receptacle and shelter. The presence of this purpose, thus, is indeed temporally prior to the actual building of the house. Moreover, the building of the house is continuously sustained by the presence of this purpose, without which the whole building process is simply inexplicable. For final cause as an end, however, the issue is much more complicated. For generally, nature by itself is not thought to be a conscious being with purposes analogous to those of human beings. Even today, there is a tendency among scientists and philosophers to think of nature as completely governed by mechanical laws and efficient causes. As a result, in order to explain how final causes are effective in natural things, we must first find answers to the</page><page sequence="4">606 Henry Wang following questions: what is the meaning of the modern concept of efficient causation? Are efficient causes sufficient for the explanation of nature? If not, what is the relation between efficient causes and final causes? If the meaning of causation has undergone a significant transformation in modern thought, then what is the essential difference between the Aristotelian and the modern concepts of efficient causation and causation? The answers to these questions call for a careful examination of the meanings of some key concepts in Aristotle's natural philosophy. Only on the basis of a comprehensive and accurate understanding of Aristotle's teleology, is it possible to discover the difference between the Aristotelian and the modern concepts of causation. The recognition of this difference is a starting point for our réévaluation of the validity and significance of final causation in the context of Peirce's pragmatism. II. Evépyeia, vvajuiç and the Unity of Causal Relations - A Recapitulation of the Aristotelian Teleology Both the Aristotelian and the modern concepts of efficient causation and causation in general refer to some kinds of motion or change. Peirce describes an efficient cause as "a compulsion determined by the particular condition of things, and is a compulsion acting to make that situation begin to change in a perfectly determined way."13 At first look, efficient causation in its modern sense, as Peirce interprets it, is different from the Aristotelian efficient causation in that the emphasis is not on the source of motion as an external agent but on the compulsion or force that brings a certain motion or change about. Aristotle defines efficient cause as "the primary source of the change or rest; e.g. ... the father is cause of the child, and generally what makes of what is made and what changes of what is changed."14 For example, the builder of a house is "what" makes of what is made, the house; the sun that is shining upon a tomato plant and makes it grow is "what" changes of what is changed, the tomato plant. The emphasis of the Aristotelian concept of efficient causation is on the "what," on the agents that bring a certain motion or change about; the emphasis of the modern concept of efficient causation, as Peirce shows, is on the forces that these agents exert upon that which is made and that which is changed. But this interpretation of the difference between the Aristotelian and the modern concepts of efficient causation remains superficial. It does not give sufficient consideration to the difference between the Aristotelian and the modern concepts of motion or change. While the focus of classical mechanics is on the kind of motion called "locomotion," the extension of the Aristotelian concept of motion or change is much wider. Besides locomotion, the concept of motion [Kivrjaiç] includes for Aristotle also qualitative alternation and quantitative increase and decrease. Moreover, motion constitutes only one kind of change [jusTaßoArj]. The two other kinds of change are generation and</page><page sequence="5">Rethinking the Validity and Significance of Final Causation 607 destruction.15 The Aristotelian four causes are applicable to all motions and changes mentioned above. They offer explanations not only of locomotion, qualitative alternation and quantitative increase and decrease, but also of generation and destruction of different beings or substances. In comparison to the Aristotelian four causes, the modern concept of efficient cause seems to have a much narrower application in locomotion alone. But let us first look more closely at Aristotle's interpretation of motion or change and his theory of causation. Aristotle's explanation of motion or change is dependent upon two central concepts of his natural philosophy: the concepts of actuality [évépyeia] and potentiality [Svvajuiç]. For Aristotle, these two concepts function in both the explanation of different kinds of motion [jcivrjcriç] and the explanation of generation and destruction of beings or substances.16 In the Physics, for example, Aristotle defines motion as "the actualization [évreÀéxeia] of the potentially existing qua existing potentially."17 Peirce applauds Aristotle's Svvajuiç and évépyeia as "wonderful conceptions" and claims that this idea of Aristotle "has proved marvelously fecund."18 The meanings of these two concepts, however, call for some careful interpretation and clarification. The Greek word ôvvajuiç was translated into Latin as potentia, and became "potentiality" or "potency" in English. In its original Greek sense, however, Sùva/uiç refers to a principle of motion and change and carries two major groups of meanings.19 First, ôvva^iiç means the capability or capacity possessed by somebody or something, which makes it possible for it to be changed. It is this sense of "capability" to which the Latin potentia and the English "potentiality" or "potency" point most of the time. For example, a tomato seed has the capability of becoming a tomato plant and producing new tomatoes; wood, bricks, glass, etc. have the capability of being used for the building of a house. Obviously, ôvvajuiç in the sense of "capability" tallies with the Aristotelian material causes. For wood, bricks and glass are matter - "that out of which a thing comes to be and which persists."20 They are the matter for the building of a house; just as a tomato seed constitutes one of the material elements for the tomato plant and the new tomatoes that it will produce.21 Moreover, and importantly, SvvajLiiç carries the meaning of "force" or "power." In this sense, Svvajuiç names the forces that bring a certain motion or change about. It refers for example to the forces that the builders of a house exert upon wood, bricks, glass and all other kinds of material in building a house; or to the forces that the sun, air and earth exert jointly upon a tomato seed and then the tomato plant, so that the tomato plant will grow and produce new tomatoes. vvajuiç in the sense of force, however, has been largely neglected and forgotten through its Latin translation potentia and the dominant understanding of this potentia in medieval philosophy as capability or passive potency.22 For Aristotle, moreover, ôvvajuiç is always used together with and as opposed to évépyeia, which was translated into Latin as " actualitas," and into</page><page sequence="6">608 Henry Wang English as "actuality." While the two senses of Svva/uiç corresponds roughly to material and efficient causes, the meaning of évépysia is often interpreted in terms of formal and final cause.23 The relationship between final cause and actuality is disclosed by the etymology of the word évusÀéxsiay which Aristotle often uses interchangeably with évépyeia. EvrsXéxsia is a compound of sv, xéXoç and exetv ("to have" or "to hold"), and means literally "the having-itself-in-its- end."24 For Aristotle, it is by having and maintaining itself in the end that a being becomes what it is in actuality. Thus, the belonging together of ôvvajuiç and évépysia demonstrates again the inherent unity of the Aristotelian four causes. Contrary to the common beliefs in modernity, actuality for Aristotle lies not in matter or force in itself, but in ideas as final and formal causes.25 Only when the different material elements constituting a tomato plant are brought into order in accord with the right proportion indicated by its genetic code, for example, does something in the form of a tomato plant come into presence in actuality. An individual being or substance only becomes actually what it is when the different material elements are ordered in accord with the right ratio or proportion contained in its form, when the formal and final causes as ideas or forms are united with the material and efficient causes. The unity of formal and final causes with efficient and material causes points to the unity of actuality and potentiality. This unity of actuality and potentiality is the unity of being that is the end or tsXoç toward which all things tend. It is worth noting that the word évépysia comes from épyov, which means "work." Thus, the literal meaning of évépysia is "standing in the work," where "work" means the fulfillment of a certain purpose or end.26 Only when something is standing fully in its "end," is it "standing in the work," viz. standing in its actuality. For example, in defining what a house is, "those who say that it is stones and bricks and wood speak of what is potentially a house, for these are matter; those who say that it is a receptacle for sheltering animals or goods, or some other such thing, speak of the actuality [évépysia] of the house."27 The definition of a house, which coincides with the form of the house, relies upon the purposes and ends the house is supposed to fulfill. It is only in the fulfillment of these purposes and ends that the house finally becomes what it is in actuality. The évépysia of a being lies in the actualization of its purpose or end when it is "standing in the work." For "performance is an end, and actuality is performance."28 Said in another way, every individual being or substance in the world moves towards a certain end; this end is its actuality, which is at the same time its form or whatness. It is in the fulfillment of its end as "standing in the work" that an individual being or substance finally stands in its actuality and in the unity of its being. For unity, Aristotle says, "has many senses (as many as 'is' has), but the proper one is that of actuality."29 This unity of actuality is the unity of the being of an individual substance and the unity of its whatness or quiddity?^ It points to the togetherness of ôvva/uiç and évépysia - a togetherness that lies in the core of the unity of the Aristotelian</page><page sequence="7">Rethinking the Validity and Significance of Final Causation 609 four causes in the causal explanation of motions and changes. At the end of last section, we raise the question of how final cause as an end, as something in the future that doesn't really exist yet, can exert any influence on the present things. Given our discussion of ôvvajuiç and évépyeia in the Aristotelian teleology, the question above has been transformed into the question of whether or not évépyeia as formal or final cause could be prior to ôuvajuiç. This is indeed a question receiving plenty of discussion in Greek thought.31 Aristotle argues that évépyeia is prior to Svvajuiç in formula, in substance and in time,32 viz. évépyeia is not only ontologically prior, but can also be temporally prior to Svvajuiç. We have shown that ôvva/uiç is inseparable from évépyeia; without évépyeia âvvajuiç could be nothing but chaotic forces and material elements. Evépyeia, therefore, is not only the end of ôvvajuiç, but continuously preserves and sustains the movement of material forces toward an end, in the attainment of which a certain being or substance comes into presence with a determinate form. Thus, évépyeia is the ontological foundation of ôéva/Liiç. At the same time, évépyeia can also be prior to ôvva/uiç in time in the sense that there always exists another thing of the same species as the thing in Svvafiiçy which is prior to the latter in time.33 For example, the form of a tomato can be prior to the tomato seed in time because this seed must itself come from another ripened fruit that has the same form of tomato.34 In summary, for Aristotle, final causes, along with the other three kinds of causes, are responsible for the explanation of the being of individual beings and substances, like the being of this man or that tomato plant. In the attainment of its final cause, an individual substance is said to have reached the unity of its being. By holding itself in the end, it attains the unity of actuality and potentiality and comes into presence as what it is with a determinate form. Thus, the Aristotelian teleology is based upon his ontology, upon his theory of being and substance. The actuality of an individual substance always requires another preceding actuality, "until we come to the actuality of the eternal prime mover."35 This eternal prime unmoved mover is God: a being that is the primary substance and the final cause of all other beings in nature. God as the self-thinking that is pure actuality is the end toward which all other beings move through their desire or love of God.36 Accordingly, it can be said that Aristotle's teleology is based upon a postulation of God, which as pure actuality constitutes the ultimate end of the cosmos. Whether or in what sense the Aristotelian ontology can be viewed as a kind theology is controversial. Since the major concern of this paper is to rethink the validity and significance of final causation in the context of Peirce's pragmatism, I will leave this complicated issue aside and turn to the investigation of the difference between the Aristotelian and the modern concepts of causation. For convenience, I will still characterize the ground of the Aristotelian teleology as a kind of theology. It must be noticed, however, that the word "theology" is used in a qualified sense - it differs significantly from the medieval theology according to which</page><page sequence="8">610 Henry Wang God is the "creator" of all beings in the world. III. Final Cause and the Modern Theories of Causation Now let us examine the difference between the Aristotelian and the modern concepts of causation. The recognition of this difference is crucial for us to understand the role of final causation in Peirce's pragmatism and the meaning of his developmental teleology. For Aristotle, "there must always be something which underlies that which is in the process of becoming."37 That which is underlying is a subject or a substance, on the basis of which all motions and changes are explained. Generation and destruction refer to the process in which individual substances are either brought forth into presence or destroyed. Other changes such as qualitative alteration and locomotion are always the qualitative alternation and locomotion of a certain individual substance. For example, for the process of change in which Socrates becomes musical, the underlying substance is the man called Socrates; just as in the motion of a chalice that finds its destination on the altar, the underlying substance is the chalice that is moved. In contrast, the modern mechanical explanation does not think motion or change in terms of individual substances as regards their generations and destructions, their qualitative and quantitative changes, or their locomotion. The modern concept of causation is not concerned with individual substances or beings, but with facts and events. Accordingly, while the Aristotelian concept of causation is meant to answer the question of "why" of an individual being or substance, the modern concept of causation is involved mainly with the question of "how" certain events occur and proceed. For Aristotle, both the four kinds of cause and the concepts of potentiality and actuality have their focal point upon the explanation of the question of the "why" of an individual being or substance [ovaia]. We do not understand a thing "until we have acquired the why of it. . . clearly we should do this as regards generation and destruction and every physical change so that, with an understanding of their principles, we may try to refer to them each of the things we seek."38 The four kinds of cause reflect four ways through which this question of "why" is answered; they are supposed to make manifest "why" an individual substance becomes what it is through a certain motion or change. Accordingly, all motions and changes are motions and changes of individual beings or substances.39 They are either the generations and destructions of these individual substances, or the qualitative alterations, the quantitative increases or decreases, and the locomotion that these individual substances undergo. The question of "why" asks a metaphysical question and is answered in terms of the actualization of an individual substance, i.e., of what an individual substance is. Every motion or change has an end, and this end is the actualization of what an individual being or substance is.40 It is by holding itself in the end of standing in the work that an individual substance stands in</page><page sequence="9">Rethinking the Validity and Significance of Final Causation 611 its actuality and becomes what it is. In contrast, the modern concept of causation does not have its center of attention on the metaphysical question of "why," but on the empirical question of "how." It is not concerned with the individual beings undergoing certain kinds of motion or change, but with physical events and the principle of motion governing these events. As a result, in the classical mechanics, the object of investigation is not concrete individual beings in the world but particles or point masses. The major concern of classical mechanics is not about "why" a certain motion or change takes place, but about "how" it occurs and proceeds. The task of mechanics is to describe how different types of motion occur and proceed under certain conditions. For example, Newton's first law of motion does not answer concretely the question of "why" any particular being is moving or is moving in this way or that. It only describes "how" a body will move when there is no external force impressed on it to compel it to change its state. Likewise, the second law of motion does not give any specific answer to the question of "why." It does not make manifest "why" a particular substance will move in a specific way under the influence of certain external forces. But it shows "how" any physical body will move under certain given conditions. It only describes that "a change in motion is proportional to the motive force impressed and takes place along the straight line in which that force is impressed."41 Therefore, causal explanation in its modern sense is involved mainly with the description of motions taking place at certain conditions and under the influence of certain external forces. Accordingly, the major task of modern scientific investigation consists in the search and verification of mathematically formulated mechanical laws that rightly describe the occurrence and procession of physical events in the world. I have mentioned that the dominance of mechanical explanation in modern thought stems from the breakup of the unity of four causes in the Aristotelian teleology, as a result of which efficient cause is singled out as the only effective or "real" cause. But the development of the modern theory of causation also involves two conflicting schools of thinking, which stem from medieval nominalism and scholastic realism. The clash between nominalism and realism carries on to modern thought and remains a controversial issue today. Given the complexity of the problem, I will confine myself in this paper to some major difficulties of nominalism and realism regarding their accounts of causal explanation. Peirce's pragmatism and his understanding of the reality of the laws of nature, as I shall show, provide an innovative alternative to the modern theories of causal explanation based upon nominalism and realism. Boler rightly summarizes that the real issue between medieval nominalism and realism is "whether the similarity, regularity, or uniformity of events (or members of a group) is grounded 'objectively' or 'subjectively.'"42 According to nominalism, universals - general concepts representing the common elements belonging to individuals of the same "genus" or "species" - are</page><page sequence="10">612 Henry Wang empty formulations that have no independent objective reality outside subjective human minds. Thus, the Aristotelian formal and final causes, which describe the genus or species of individual substances, cannot be real causes effective in the occurrence and procession of physical events. The denial of the legitimacy of universals by nominalism represents a movement against metaphysics in modern thought. Modern nominalism ventures to think of and account for events and facts in nature and human life as they are without presupposing an ontological or theological ground. The argument of modern nominalism is thoughtful and significant, but not without problems, some serious. First, under the nominalist theory of causation, the laws of nature are mere formulations of human mind with no independent reality in the world of objects. They are pure description of how physical facts and events occur and proceed in the past. This conception of the laws of nature as mere words makes it hard, if not impossible, to account for the predictive character of the laws of nature. Had the laws of nature no independent reality in the world, were they not really functional in nature, then there would be no way to assure or even to presume the reliability of the predictions of future events on the basis of the laws of nature. Second, the nominalist theory of causation, which is concerned solely with the question of "how," does not offer a sufficient explanation of things and events in the world. For most people, an explanation cannot be satisfactory unless both the question of "how" and the question of "why" are addressed in some ways. The question of "why" is so common and natural that we always feel something is lacking when it is not touched upon in an explanation. Thus, the burden of proof is on the nominalists who must show why the question of "why" is illegitimate and how a causal explanation concerned with the question of "how" alone can be sufficient. A simple denial of the legitimacy of the "why" question does not help much and a convincing proof is still called for to demonstrate the illegitimacy of the question of "why." Last but not least, it remains uncertain whether or not the thesis of nominalism, in its denial of universals of any kind, maintains any universal validity. On the other hand, the modern theory of causal explanation based upon realism involves likewise a number of ambiguities and difficulties. In classical mechanics, for example, the laws of nature, which describe motions and changes under certain conditions, are concerned with the question of "how." But the question of "why" has not been dropped completely; it is answered implicitly by the prescriptive character of the laws of nature. For example, Newton's second law describes that, under the influence of certain external force, the motion or change of a body "is proportional to the motive force impressed and takes place along the straight line in which that force is impressed."43 But why should a body move in such a way? Simply because that is the imperative of the law of nature. Taken as universal and real, Newton's second law is not merely descriptive. It also prescribes how the motion of a</page><page sequence="11">Rethinking the Validity and Significance of Vinai Causation 613 body occurs and proceeds under certain conditions. In general, what the laws of nature prescribe is the state of order toward which things in the world should tend in the end. Thus, contrary to conventional wisdom, the modern theory of causal explanation based upon realism has not really abandoned final causation but has presupposed it as a hidden foundation. Although Peirce's understanding of causation is not based upon realism, Peirce's account of the relation between the laws of nature and final causes helps in this context to clarify the role of final causation in modern mechanism. Helmut Pape has pointed out that for Peirce, "laws of nature are final causes"44 Under Peirce's elaboration, the prescription of the laws of nature articulates the state of order toward which all things in the world should tend in the end. A final cause, as Peirce says, "may be conceived to operate without having been the purpose of any mind: that supposed phenomena goes by the name of fate" (1.204). The state of order prescribed by the laws of nature is none other than the fate or destiny of the things in the world. For example, even gravity "might without falsity be conceived as a final cause, since it certainly destines things ultimately to approach the center of the earth" (MS 682, 1913). This relation between the laws of nature and final causes throws a new light on the role of final causation in modern mechanism. As Peirce shows, an efficient cause in its modern sense is a force or "compulsion determined by the particular condition of things, and is a compulsion acting to make that situation begin to change in a perfectly determined way."45 It may also refer to the necessitating and indispensable condition or antecedent of a physical event. In either of the two cases, an efficient cause in itself has nothing to do with the laws of nature. All mechanical explanations, however, presuppose certain mechanical laws, which are taken to be both descriptive and prescriptive of the occurrence and procession of physical events under certain conditions. All laws of nature, as Peirce demonstrates, are final causes. It follows that all mechanical explanations presuppose certain final causes in the form of mechanical laws. Final causation, thus, is the foundation of all mechanical explanations. Let us recall that nominalism and realism characterize two different theories of causal explanation after the breakup of the unity of the Aristotelian four causes and the abandonment of final causation in modern thought. While the nominalists venture to think causal explanation without presupposing any kind of ontological or metaphysical unity, the realists are less adventurous. With the center of attention shifted from individual substances to physical facts and events, the realist theory of causation does not advance to go without ontological or metaphysical foundations. It only replaces the Aristotelian unity of the being of substances with a new kind of unity based upon the reality of the laws of nature. When the laws of nature are taken to be universal and real, then it becomes an imperative that things in the world move toward the state of order prescribed by these laws. The realist theory of causation, thus, goes</page><page sequence="12">614 Henry Wang hand in hand with the doctrine of necessitarianism, according to which the laws of nature are predetermined and there is a fixed end toward which the whole universe should tend ultimately. While the Aristotelian teleology has its ground on the theological unity of God, which is the primary substance and pure actuality as such, the realist theory of causation is based upon a new kind of unity. It is the unity of the fixed end of universe prescribed by the laws of nature that are pre-established and predetermined. (The task of scientific investigation is nothing but to find these laws of nature out.) Thus, modern mechanism based upon the realist theory of causation is also teleological. Since final causation still constitutes a hidden foundation of mechanical explanation, modern mechanism has not truly done without metaphysical foundations. It always presupposes metaphysical frameworks of one kind or another. We have shown that with the breakup of the Aristotelian unity of causal relations, the modern theories of causal explanation based upon nominalism and realism have both encountered some serious problems. In the next section, I shall show how Peirce's pragmatism, characterized by his developmental teleology, offers an innovative alternative to the nominalist and realist theories of causation. IV. Peirce's Pragmatism and Developmental Teleology In opposition to the division between the subjective and the objective, between the mental and the physical in modern nominalism and realism, Peirce argues that "all phenomena are of one character, though some are more mental and spontaneous, other more material and regular" (7.570). Meantime, "the thought thinking and the immediate thought object are the very same thing regarded from different points of view" (6.339). Accordingly, both the subject and the object are essentially united in the same evolutionary process of Idea or thought. With this argument, Peirce moves forward to unravel the difficulties of nominalism and realism by proposing a pragmatistic idealism, which offers an inspiring way to think the realities of the laws of nature. For Peirce, in order to ascertain the meaning of an intellectual conception, "one should consider what practical consequences might conceivably result by necessity from the truth ofthat conception-, and the sum of these consequences will constitute the entire meaning of the conception" (5.9). The most striking feature of this pragmatistic idealism is "its recognition of an inseparable connection between rational cognition and rational purpose; and that consideration it was which determined the preference for the name pragmatism (EP II, p. 333). Obviously, Peirce's pragmatism is opposed to nominalism, which rejects metaphysics completely and grants no reality to the laws of nature. But it also departs strikingly from realism. It does not presuppose the reality of any predetermined laws of nature independent of human practice. Rather, the laws of nature articulate the state of order or</page><page sequence="13">Rethinking the Validity and Significance of Final Causation 615 harmony, the finious state (7.471 )46 toward which all things in the world should tend in the end. Peirce's concept of final causation does not entail a unity of the fixed end of universe prescribed by certain laws of nature predetermined and pre-established. The laws of nature do not possess realities until they come out in the end as results of evolution. Laws and generals are would-be realities to be reached through the fulfillment of rational purposes of human practice. The intellectual meaning of a conception or proposition always lies in the future?7 Peirce explains his understanding of the reality of laws and generals as a mean between nominalism and realism: "The nominalists say it is a mere [word]. Strike out "mere," and this opinion is approximately true. The realists say it is real. Substitute for "is" may be^ that is, is provided experience and reason shall, as their final upshot, uphold the truth of the particular predicate, and the natural existence of the law it express, and this is likewise true" (3.460). To say that laws and generals may be real for the present is to say that their existences are merely possibilities. But these possibilities are real possibilities4* that may be attained in the future. In other words, laws and generals will come out as results of evolution and will be believed in the final opinion of the community. Meantime, the development of their realities from the "may be" at present to the "would be" in the future is characterized by the logic of abduction. It is a continuous hypothetical process that alone, among all logical inferences, is able to introduce new ideas and to lead through experimentation to the final fixation of opinion.49 In Peirce's view, the maxim of pragmatism is a mere maxim of logic.50 It is the maxim of logic of abduction, through which we grasp the true meaning of intellectual conceptions and propositions and the reality of ideas. The process of abduction comprises a process of experimental verification.51 After enumerating all essential ingredients of an experiment, Peirce concludes that "the unity of essence of the experiment lies in its purpose and plan^ the ingredients passed over in the enumeration" (EP II, 339ff; emphasis added). The logic of abduction, thus, is also teleological. "The elements of every concept enter into logical thought at the gate of perception and make their exit at the gate of purposive action" (EP II, 241, emphasis added). The end of every stage of abduction is characterized by rational purposes, in the fulfillment of which the process of abduction moves towards higher levels of reality and generality. The process of abduction consists in a continuous fulfillment of a series of purposes and plans, at the end of which stands the final cause as the reality of laws and generals that will be thought in the ultimate opinion of the community. The progress of abduction is thus none other than the evolution of the Idea towards its final reality and generality. Since the rational cognition of laws and generals is inseparable from the rational purposes, causal explanation on the basis of Peirce's pragmatism points to a new kind of unity. It is the unity of the category of the thirdness, the abductive unity based upon</page><page sequence="14">616 Henry Wang the fulfillment of the rational purposes of human practice. By taking laws and generals as the category of thirdness whose reality lies in the future, Peirce finds a new way to bring back the unity of causal relations without falling into a deterministic understanding of the laws of nature. In "On Science and Natural Classes,5' Peirce illustrates this new unity of causal relations as the unity of efficient and final causation. Peirce compares the relationship between efficient and final causation to that between the sheriff and the court. Final causation cannot be imagined without efficient causation, just as "the court cannot be imagined without a sheriff." On the other hand, "an efficient cause, detached from a final cause in the form of law, would not even possess efficiency."52 In contrast to the realist theory of causation, this unity of causal relation in the form of the unity of efficient and final causation is not a unity that is predetermined and pre-established; it is always ready to break up for the sake of seeking continuously after new unities. For Peirce, the reality of laws and generals is never set once and for all, but is the would-be of the future. It is this on-going process of breaking up and uniting in the search after laws and generals whose reality "will be thought in the ultimate opinion of the community"53 that characterizes the continuous growth and evolution of the laws of nature. Thus, the teleological progress of abduction is marked by the continuity of the evolutionary process. Continuity, as Peirce puts it, "is an indispensable element of reality, and that continuity is simply what generality becomes in the logic of relatives, and thus, like generality, and more than generality, is an affair of thought, and is the essence of thought" (5.436). True generality, therefore, "is nothing but a rudimentary form of true continuity. Continuity is nothing but perfect generality of a law of relationship" (6.169). Peirce's account of the evolution of the reality of laws and generals on the basis of the concept of continuity provides a key to unravel the difficulties of the nominalist and realist theories of causation. With his pragmatistic idealism and synechism, Peirce transforms the Aristotelian concept of final causation and endows it with new vitalities in modern thought. In contrast to the Aristotelian theory of final causation, for Peirce, the laws of nature, which describe the final state of things towards which chances should turn in the infinitely remote future, have neither ontological nor temporal priorities. As results of evolution, they possess no predetermined forms or pre-established realities. As Reynolds interprets, what we have first are not laws already established, which are "occasionally violated by chance events." Instead, "what we have first is a rather unruly sequence of events, which only approximately follows the guidelines of law; then, with an increase of repetitions and of time, these events come to be more and more lawful and regular."54 Peirce's teleology, therefore, is characterized by its open-endedness. For Peirce, there must be some 'absolute chance' in the universe and cat any time ...an element of pure chance survives and will remain until the world becomes an absolutely perfect, rational and symmetrical system, in which mind is at last</page><page sequence="15">Rethinking the Validity and Significance of Final Causation 617 crystallized in the infinitely distant future" (6.33, emphasis added). Accordingly, "the only possible way of accounting for the laws of nature and for uniformity in general is to suppose them results of evolution" (6.13, emphasis added). This evolution of the laws of nature is a process in which a tendency of habit grows from pure chance and regularity evolves from chaos. "The idea that chance begets order" Peirce emphasizes, is one of the cornerstones of modern physics" (6.279). 55 Precisely because the laws of nature are not established beforehand, physical and biological events, along with all other phenomena in the evolution of universe, are fundamentally irreversible. They are irreversible because there are no pre-established and predetermined laws underlying the occurrence and procession of these events throughout. Rather, the laws of nature only come into being through the evolution of the universe itself.56 The kind of teleology that characterizes Peirce's pragmatistic idealism and synechism, therefore, is "more than a mere purposive pursuit of a predetermined end; it is a developmental teleology "S7 Although Peirce used the term "developmental teleology" only in the discussion of the development of human personality, Hulswit has pointed out rightly that it is also "applicable to the idea of teleology in general: learning from the developmental aspect of our own human purposes, we can inductively infer that all final causes in nature are, at least in principle, subject to evolution."58 Granted, Peirce's developmental teleology is not free of difficulties. The question remains how to think and account for the meaning and possibility of an evolutionary process without presupposing a definite end determined by the laws of nature. How, for example, can one acknowledge the possibility of laws and generals that will be thought in the ultimate opinion of the community without the postulation of a metaphysical ground like the pure actuality of a supreme divine being or the pre-established reality of laws of nature? Peirce's answers to these questions are inspired by the Kantian regulative principle. As Hookway claims, both "Kant and Peirce claim that inquiry rests upon principles which we grant objective validity, but which we cannot justify our adoption of without circularity."59 Accordingly, the reality of the laws of nature, which involves fundamentally a question of "why," cannot be established objectively. It is a regulative hope that is only attainable in principle. For both Kant and Peirce, the ideal of reason designates the goal or the end "toward which scientists always proceed but never completely reach. They are like a horizon that recedes at each forward step. One never arrives at its edge and never comes to a final stop."60 The rule of ethics, thus, "will be to adhere to the only possible absolute aim, and to hope that it will prove attainable. Meantime, it is comforting to know that all experience is favorable to that assumption" (EP II, p. 203). The legitimacy of the Kantian regulative principle, the role it plays in Peirce's developmental teleology, and its metaphysical and theological</page><page sequence="16">618 Henry Wang implications require separate study. But it is clear that, with all its difficulties, Peirce's developmental teleology offers some firm answers to the objections of final causation in modern thought. Mayr summarizes the following four major traditional objections to the use of teleological language and insists that "in order to be acceptable teleological language must be immune to these objections." 1. Teleological Statements and Explanations Imply the Endorsement of Unverifiable Theological or Metaphysical Doctrines in Science. 2. The Belief that Acceptance of Explanations for Biological Phenomena that Are not Equally Applicable to Inanimate Nature Constitutes Rejection of a Physico- Chemical Explanation. 3. The Assumption that Future Goals were the Cause of Current Events Seemed in Complete Conflict with Any Concept of Causality. 4. Teleological Language Seemed to Represent Objectionable Anthropomorphism.61 The legitimacy of these objections, however, may be questionable itself. We have shown in the first and second section that the third objection, which takes the concept of final causation as a doctrine that allows the future to influence the present, is not valid but stems from a confusion of concepts. The first objection, which asserts that teleological language implies theological or metaphysical doctrines in science, is indeed well founded. But, as we have demonstrated in the last section, even modern mechanism has not truly done away with metaphysical implications, but presupposes inexplicitly certain metaphysical frameworks. The other two objections, which put teleological explanation into conflict with physico-chemical explanation or modern causal explanation on the basis of psychological theory, are also problematic. They do not recognize the new meanings of causal explanation in modern thought and the two different questions, i.e., the question of how and the question of why, that the modern and the Aristotelian concept of causation are meant to answer respectively. If the concept of final causation and the concept of efficient causation are indeed concerned with two different questions, then they are not, or cannot, conflict with each other. It may well be the case that they are complementary to each other in any comprehensive explanation of things and events in the world. Thus, the objection that "teleological explanations were widely believed to be a form of obscurantism, an evasion of the need for a causal explanation"62 speaks only half of the truth. What teleological explanations do not offer is a detailed and scrupulous answer to the question of "how," which becomes one of the major concerns of modern scientific</page><page sequence="17">Rethinking the Validity and Significance of Final Causation 619 research and the focus of modern causal explanation. As Wieland points out, "on how exactly teleological connections in nature are regulated, Aristotle gives no information."63 The unity of efficient and final causation that Peirce argues for, on the other hand, sets a good example of how the question of "how" and the question of "why" can be answered in concert in his developmental teleology. The failure to recognize the different questions efficient and final causes are meant to answer has also led scholars like Mayr to insist upon a problematic distinction between teleological and "non-teleological phenomena or systems." Our analyses have shown that it is not the case that certain phenomena are teleological while others are not. For Aristotle, all individual substances in the world are explained in teleological terms. The final cause is thus indispensable for explaining the why of any individual substance. In modern mechanism, since final causation is the foundation of all mechanical explanations, efficient and final causes are always united, though inexplicitly, in the causal explanation of physical facts and events. Moreover, in Peirce's pragmatistic idealism and synechism, the teleological process in which chance begets order does not belong exclusively to a particular kind of phenomena such as biological phenomena. Instead, it characterizes the evolution of the whole universe, as a result of which laws and generals as final causes would be believed in the ultimate opinion of the community. Therefore, the distinction between teleological and non-teleological phenomena is untenable. It is based upon some modern prejudices against and misunderstanding of final causation. It also suggests an utter division of the phenomenon in itself and human conception of the phenomenon, i.e., a division of fact and theory that has become more and more problematic today. According to Mayr, "extending the term teleological to cover also static systems leads to contradictions and illogicalities."64 "One runs into serious logical difficulties when one applies the term 'teleological' to static systems (regardless of their potential) instead of process,"65 such as a torpedo in storage, the eye of a sleeping person or a hammer. But strictly speaking, no system is absolutely static. Everything in the world is always already in a continuous evolutionary process toward its réAoç, toward laws and generalities. For example, it might appear that a torpedo in an ordnance depot, like a house that is empty with nobody living in it, has nothing to do with any final cause, say, hitting and destroying a target. But a torpedo qua torpedo, even if it is in storage and not used at present, can never be really isolated completely from its past of being made with a purpose of hitting and destroying enemy targets and its future possibility of hitting such targets in the end. The present is not an independent and isolated moment, but is always defined in the continuity of temporal process. It can never be separated from the past and the future. The contradictions and illogicalities, thus, do not come from the application of the term 'teleological' to the so-called static systems, but from the rigid,</page><page sequence="18">620 Henry Wang isolated and fragmentary ways through which these phenomena are approached and explained. Since the major concern of this paper is to rethink the validity and significance of final causation in the context of modern theories of causal explanation and Peirce's pragmatism, I have confined my account of the Aristotelian teleology to a line of interpretation leaning toward the medieval Aristo telianism. As a result, we have still not uncovered fully the original meanings of the concept of réÀoç, akia and évépyeia in Aristotle's natural philosophy. Presumably, a further examination of the meaning and validity of Peirce's developmental teleology and a deeper study of the significance of final causation entail a more careful thinking of one important dimension of Aristotle's natural philosophy, which I have not elaborated in this paper.66 Nevertheless, it is clear from my analysis that Peirce's developmental teleology, which plays a critical role in his pragmatism, opens up an innovative approach to unravel the difficulties in the modern theories of causal explanation based upon nominalism and realism. The question concerning final causation is consequential. It deserves more serious investigations and should no longer be simply passed over.67 Pennsylvania State University hzwlol@psu.edu NOTES 1 .

Jonathan Barnes (London, Gerald Duckworth &amp; Company, 1975), p. 147: "Strictly speaking, therefore, we are dealing here not with four causes, but with the four senses in which we speak of causes." 6. Note that in medieval philosophy, with the reduction of the Aristotelian four causes to formal and material causes, the understanding of causation is largely in alignment with Aristotle's theory. For while material cause stands for both material and efficient cause, formal cause represents both formal and final cause. In modern thought, however, with the reduction of the four causes to efficient cause alone, the meaning of causation has undergone a significant transformation. 7.

I find Cooper's elaboration of Aristotle's natural teleology for the most part precise and insightful. But I have some reservations about a number of modern terminologies he uses in the interpretation of Aristotle. The identification of teleological with "goal-directed," for example, seems to pass over the distinction between final cause as a purpose and final cause as an end. In general, I believe the introduction of the concept of "goal" in the interpretation of the Aristotelian teleology has not helped to clarify the issue but only produced more ambiguities and confusions. As a result, Cooper's interpretation relies too heavily upon the teleological processes in plants and animals. It does not pay sufficient attention to the function of final cause in the formation of inanimate beings and substances. Another concern I have about Cooper's interpretation is his projection of the modern concepts of "fact" and "physical reality" into Aristotle's natural teleology. I will come back to this point later in this paper. 11. Mayr, Ibid, p. 96-7 12. Mayr, p. 96. Cf.

Granted, these two senses of ôvvafxiç were maintained in medieval philosophers, for example in Thomas Aquinas, as passive potency and active potency. But the emphasis on the meaning of passive potency was so great that the meaning of active potency became eclipsed and later forgotten. See Aquinas, Commentary on the Metaphysics of Aristotle Vol 2 Bk 9 Lsn 1 Set 1777, trans. John P. Rowan (Chicago: Henry Regnery Company, 1961), p. 656; cf. An Introduction to the Metaphysics of St. Thomas Aquinas, trans. James F. Anderson (Chicago, Henry Regnery Company, 1953), p. 30. 23. As regards the relation between the concepts of Svvapiç and évépyeia and the Aristotelian four causes, there are some ambiguities and difficulties I cannot elaborate in detail in this paper. To cut a long story short, the Aristotelian efficient cause carries two major meanings: an agent that makes a motion or change possible and the force or power the agent exerts upon that which is moved or changed. The latter sense of efficient cause overlaps with one meaning of the concept of Svvapiç. It is the former sense of "agent," as Aristotle says in the Physics (II, 7), that coincides with formal cause and final cause. For example, a father who begets a child contains the form of man and thus coincides with the formal and final causes of the child as a human being. A carpenter who makes a chair, likewise, must have the form of the chair in mind, and this form is also the formal and final causes of the process of chair making. So, when the sense of efficient cause as force or power refers to one meaning of the concept Svvajuiç, the other sense of efficient cause coincides with formal cause and final cause, and thus with évépyeia. As a result, there is no exact correspondence between the concepts of Svvajuiç and évépyeia and the Aristotelian four causes. In a rough sense, however, it is often workable to align material cause and efficient cause with ôvvajuiç, and to align formal and final cause with évépyeia. 24. Cf.

The proper meaning of "whatness" is "a substance and a this." It refers to the being of an individual substance. But the word "whatness" is also used in some secondary senses. For example, it may refer to a certain quality of an individual substance. {Metaphysics, VII, 4, 1030a 17ff.) In like vein, Aristotle also distinguishes two kinds of actuality. In some cases, actuality is to potentiality as "a substance to some matter," while in others, "as motion is to the power to move" {ibid., IX 6, 1048b 7-10). It seems reasonable to assume that the first senses of whatness and actuality tally with the generations and destructions of individual substances, while the second senses of whatness and actuality correspond to other kinds of motion or change, such as qualitative alternation or locomotion. 41.

Short, who asserts: "For Peirce and Aristotle, no final cause is actual" ("Peirce's Concept of Final Cause," Transactions, vol. 17, p. 369). It seems that for Aristotle, form and final cause are more actual than matter. In other words, in one sense, as is shown here, form and final cause is actuality itself, though in another sense, actuality can also mean the unity of form or final cause with matter, which is closer to "actuality" in its modern sense. Peirce's position is indeed different from that of Aristotle's. But Short's assertion that "no final cause is actual" for Peirce goes a little too far. The issue, as I see it, comes</page><page sequence="22">624 Henry Wang from the ambiguity of the English word "possibility." Short also says: "A final cause is not a future actuality: it is a present possibility." ("Teleology in Nature," p. 311) It is true that Peirce himself also says generals and laws are "real possibilities." But the word "possibility," which derives from Latin possum and is thus a cognate of the word potentia or potentiality, has two groups of meanings in English. On the one hand, it means potentiality, passive potency, or capability. On the other hand, possibility can mean "that which is possible," and thus the end or zéloç that is possible to be attained or realized. In this sense, possibility, though it involves some more uncertainty, compares to the Aristotle's concept of évépysia, actuality. It seems to me that it is this second sense of possibility Peirce is indicating when he uses the term "real possibilities." 49. Cf. EP II, p. 235. 50. Ibid., p. 134 51. Ibid., p. 235 52.

Cf. 6.33: "It would suppose that in the beginning - infinitely remote - there was a chaos of impersonalized feeling, which being without connection or regularity would properly be without existence. This feeling, sporting here and there in pure arbitrariness, would have started the germ of a generalizing tendency. Its other sportings would be evanescent, but this would have a growing virtue. Thus, the tendency to habit would be started; and from this, with the other principles of evolution, all the regularities of the universe would be evolved. " 56. For a valuable review of the irreversibility in physics, psychics, physiology and evolution in the context of Peirce's scientific metaphysics, see Reynolds 's Peirce's Scientific Metaphysics: The Philosophy of Chance, Law, and Evolution, Chapter 2-4. It seems to me that the "reversibility" of physical and other kinds of events is based upon a realist theory of causal explanation, according to which the laws of nature are real and pre-established. They are underlying and governing the whole procession of physical events throughout. The phenomenon of "irreversibility," thus, constitutes a major difficulty to this understanding of the laws of nature on the basis of realism. Peirce's understanding of the laws of nature as results of evolution, as we show in the paper, offers promising explanations of irreversible phenomena. 57. EP\, p. 331. Emphasis added. 58.
