Buiter The term 'country ownership' refers to a property of the conditionality attached to programmes, processes, plans, or strategies involving both a 'domestic' party (generally a nation state) and a foreign party (generally the IMF, the World Bank, the Regional Development Banks, and other multilateral and bilateral institutions). Under what circumstances and how can the concept of country ownership be relevant to a country with a myriad heterogeneous and often conflicting views and interests? Or to a country whose government's representational legitimacy or democratic credentials are in question ? The author argues that the term has been abused to such an extent that it is at best unhelpful and at worst pernicious: a term whose time has gone. Key Words: Aid; Governance and Public Policy Words matter. They can enlighten or obscure. Jargon is an example of the destructive use of words. It creates artificial barriers to understanding and participation and thus generates obscur ity rents that the insiders can appropriate. Scientific disciplines, professions, and institutions all have their own jargon. So do the international financial institutions (IFIs) and multilateral development banks (MDBs). The term 'country ownership' and the associated adjective 'country-owned' have become particularly pernicious examples of politically correct IFI-speak. 'Country ownership' may have been a useful term at some point. Regrettably, it has been used and abused in so many ways to gloss over realities deemed uncomfortable, and to create a pleasant buzz to distract the uninformed and unwary, that it now needs to be put out of its misery. Country ownership is a property of programmes, processes, plans, or strategies involving both a 'domestic' party (generally a nation state) and a foreign party. More specifically, it is a property of the conditionality attached to these programmes. The foreign parties I have in mind are the international financial institutions (IFIs): the IMF, the World Bank, the Regional Development Banks, and other multilateral institutions. However, most of what I have to say applies equally to bilateral relations between a developing country and a donor country and to the relationship between the EU and developing countries and emerging markets.

Buiter Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF); the World Bank's and IMF's Highly Indebted Poor Country Initiative (HIPC); The World Bank's Country Assistance Strategies (CAS); the World Bank's Low Income Countries Under Stress Initiative (LICUS); IMF Standby Arrange ments; World Bank Structural Adjustment Facilities (SAFs); Structural Adjustment Loans and Sector Adjustment Loans (SALs); and a range of similar stabilisation, structural adjustment, and reform programmes. 'Country ownership' can refer to a number of dimensions of the multidimensional relation ship of the domestic party to the programme/process and its conditionality. Specifically, it can mean one or more of the following: 'The country has designed and drafted the programme'; or its weaker siblings, ranging from 'The country has had a significant involvement in the drafting and design ofthe programme' to 'The authorities ofthe country were informed ofthe programme after it had been drawn up by other parties, typically the World Bank and the IMF'. 'The country agrees with the objectives of the programme.' 'The country believes that the implementation of the programme as envisaged will achieve the programme's objectives.' 'The country implements the programme'; or its weaker siblings, ranging from 'The country plays a significant role in the implementation of the programme' to 'The authorities ofthe country are kept informed of how and when the programme has been implemented'. Until this point I have gone along with the sloppy usage of the word 'country' as referring to a single purposefully acting agent. This anthropomorphic approach obscures reality and confuses the argument. Who or what is or are 'the country' that owns the programme, in any of the four senses just referred to? A country is made up of populations ranging from the tens of thousands to the billion plus. All countries, even the smallest and most homogeneous - racially, ethnically, culturally, reli giously etc. - contain many individuals and groups with diverse, often divergent and conflicting views, interests, policy objectives, and programmes. Under what circumstances and how can the concept of country ownership be relevant to a country with countless heterogeneous and often conflicting views and interests? If the country has institutions for political and economic governance that are representative and legitimate, there may be a limited number of national representative voices that can claim with some validity to 'speak for the country' or to 'represent the interests of the country'. The range of views and interests in the country may be so wide, however, that not even the repre sentatives of the legitimate government and of the worlds of work and business can claim to speak for 'the country' whose ownership is being sought for a programme. In the case of the PRSPs, recognition of this reality has led to the development of ad hoc consultative processes of ever-increasing complexity and duration. Not only representatives of the government (central, state, and municipal) and of parliament are now involved, but also representatives of many other groups, associations, agencies, institutions, and organisations. Increasingly, the PRSP process tries to involve a wide range of special interests and lobby groups, including political, environmental, cultural, and religious NGOs (both local and international) and other representatives of civil society. Quite how the views and voices of such a range of sectional and special interests are aggre gated into an operative concept of country ownership remains a mystery. Also, despite the large number of NGOs and civil-society groups, organisations, and factions involved in some of the PRSP consultative processes, the representativeness of the consultations remains an open issue. For instance, the spectacular under-representation of the enterprise sector, and especially the private-enterprise sector, in most PRSP consultative processes represents a serious dent in its 648 Development in Practice, Volume 17, Numbers 4-5, August 2007</page><page sequence="3">'Country ownership : a term whose time has gone claim to be representative of all the parties whose efforts are essential to a successful attack on poverty or who are affected by it. Moreover, it is only in a limited number of cases that there is a realistic prospect for putting together a consultative process (let alone a process that actually drafts the programme and designs the conditionality) that can make any claim to being representative of the interests, wishes, and views of the majority of the country's population. Unrepresentative and often repressive governments frequently preclude representative PRSP processes. This should come as no surprise. Why do countries become candidates for stabilisation, structural adjustment, or reform pro grammes? Why do countries take part in the HIPC initiative or the PRSP process? It is because they need and seek external assistance of three kinds: They need external financial resources and cannot access these through the markets, because they are not creditworthy. They need external expertise and do not have the resources to pay for it on market terms. They need an external commitment device because of weak domestic political institutions. Countries that need one or more of these external desiderata - finance, expertise, commitment - are countries that are in trouble, countries that cannot help themselves, countries that are in a mess. It is possible for a country with good institutions, good political leadership, and good policies nevertheless to be in a mess. The cause(s) could be 'exogenous bad luck': bad neighbours pre venting trade and transit and restricting the country's ability to participate effectively in the regional and global economy; armed conflict inflicted on a peaceful nation; natural disasters and public-health disasters such as tsunamis, earthquakes, or the AIDS pandemic; bad initial conditions, such as those encountered by many of the new CIS countries following the collapse of the Soviet Union. History can be a curse. Most of the time, however, bad luck does not explain why a country is confronted with the programmes and conditionality associated with external assistance. The most frequent reasons are bad institutions, bad political leadership, and bad policies. Countries subject to IFI programmes and the associated conditionality often have political systems that are unrepresentative and repressive, ranging from mildly authoritarian to brutally totalitarian. The political leadership and the elites supporting it are often corrupt and economically illit erate. Rent-seeking and cronyism offer higher returns to effort than socially productive labour and entrepreneurship. Public administration is weak, corrupt, and has very limited implementation capacity. Moreover, the countries with the most unrepresentative and repres sive governments do not permit a representative cross-section of civil society to participate. Indeed, civil society tends to be weakest precisely in those countries where it is most needed. What would country ownership mean in Zimbabwe, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (a HIPC-initiative country), and in Sudan? These are extreme examples, and neither Zimbabwe nor Sudan currently has a World Bank or IMF programme, but there are many others. What does country ownership mean in Algeria, in Egypt, or in the People's Republic of China? In Iraq after the fall of Saddam Hussain, and in Afghanistan? Closer to my operational home, we have the CIS-7 poor countries: Moldova, Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, the Kyrgyz Republic, and Uzbekistan. All but Uzbekistan have produced PRSPs. In Uzbekistan the World Bank Group has a modest programme of lending, technical assistance, and analytical and policy advice. There is no IMF programme, although an Article 4 Consul tation was completed in June 2004. What would country ownership mean in Uzbekistan? That the agreement of President Karimov has been obtained? Development in Practice, Volume 17, Numbers 4-5, August 2007 649</page><page sequence="4">Willem H. Buiter The term 'country ownership' is used to describe both positive and normative features of IFI programmes. These alternative uses are exemplified by the following two statements, both of which are commonly heard. First, 'Unless an IMF programme and the conditionality it embodies are country-owned, the programme will fail'. Second, 'Unless an IMF pro gramme and the conditionality it embodies are country-owned, the program deserves to fail'. I take the first statement to mean that for an IMF programme to be successful certain actions are required of 'local' agents. Unless these agents are willing and able to implement these actions, the programme will fail. This statement is true, but not very enligh tening. A programme and the plan of action that it involves have to be incentive-compatible in order to be credible and to succeed. The local agents whose actions are necessary for the programme to succeed are, however, not necessarily those who speak for the country in the meetings or consultative processes where these programmes are drafted and the conditionality is designed. And those on whom the success ofthe programme depends may not include all those affected by it. Often the majority of those affected by a programme have had no voice in the design of the conditionality, and the programme may not serve their interests, regardless of whether their efforts are essential to its success, and regard less of whether they can be cajoled or induced to implement it and make it 'successful'. If this is the reality in a country that is a candidate for a programme, it is beyond the ability of the IMF, World Bank, and other IFIs to remedy it. The effective choice for the IFIs is then between not having a programme and having one that is not 'country owned', in the sense of not in the interest of and supported by the majority of the population. There can be little doubt that at times pro grammes have been designed and implemented that served the interests of an unrepresentative few at the expense of the unrepresented many. Such illegitimate programmes do not deserve to be implemented. In many other cases, however, the issue is less clear-cut. Even legitimate programmes (that is programmes that are widely viewed as fair and desirable) are constrained by the requirement that their implementation must be incentive compatible. If they depend for their success on the adoption of rules or on actions that are not incentive-compatible, they are not credible. Conditionality (sticks or carrots conditional on outcomes, processes, performance, or actions) is a means of enhancing the incentive com patibility and thus the credibility of programmes. In practice, ensuring post-implementation irreversibility of reforms, policies, and actions is the hardest part of programme design. Most incentives (for example, the disbursement of a tranche of a loan or grant) have a natural expiry date. Good conditionality creates effective and lasting or irreversible incentives to take certain actions. Conditionality can apply to actions, outcomes, or processes. Ideally, incentives should be designed to increase the likelihood of actions that contribute to desirable outcomes. In practice, key outcomes may lag far behind actions, and the contribution of the action to the eventual outcome may be hard to identify, measure, and verify. The effect of privatisation on economic performance is an obvious example. Process conditionality does not directly target specific actions, policies, or outcomes. Instead it focuses on promoting good governance, in the hope that more accountable, transparent, responsive, representative, and democratic government institutions will produce better actions, policies, and outcomes. Process conditionality focuses on capacity building broadly defined, and requires that a process (like the consultative PRSP process) be implemented, or that certain institutions be in place to enhance the transpar ency and representativeness of governance at different levels. Making aid available to countries whose governments and institutions for political and economic governance are most effective (or at least meet certain minimum thresholds, defined, say, by international standards and codes) is an example of process or institutional conditionality. The US Millennium Challenge Account embodies this process approach to conditionality. 650 Development in Practice, Volume 17, Numbers 4-5, August 2007</page><page sequence="5">'Country ownership': a term whose time has gone If process conditionality and country ownership are to be taken seriously, we would need international standards and codes to benchmark acceptable practice. Failure to meet these benchmarks would mean that the country would not have access to the external funds, expertise, and credibility brought by an IFI-mediated programme. Sources of benchmarks could be initiat ives or reports like the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative; the Publish What You Pay, Publish What You Receive initiative; the FATF for anti-money-laundering benchmarks; the Corruption Perceptions Index of Transparency International; and the reports of the Organiz ation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and of the Council of Europe on elec toral and political performance. Standards for other key aspects of the accountability of the government to the domestic population could be set by defining benchmarks or minimum stan dards for freedom of the media, independence of the courts, freedom to organise and register independent political parties and labour unions, the right of peaceful assembly and protest, and the right to strike. Process conditionality is political or governance conditionality. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) has long practised this form of conditionality because of the political nature of its mandate, which in that regard is unlike that of the other IFIs.1 The requirement that we operate only in '... countries committed to and applying the principles of multiparty democracy, pluralism and market economics' has meant that the Bank no longer engages in new public-sector projects in Turkmenistan and in Belarus, and that similar constraints have been imposed on the Bank's ability to work with the sovereign in Uzbekistan. While process conditionality and political benchmarks may give one a warm glow inside, an unavoidable implication of their adoption is that a number of potential countries of operation will fail to qualify. The EBRD still operates, albeit at a low level of activity, in Turkmenistan, Belarus, and Uzbekistan, because the primary mandate of the Bank is in the private sector. The World Bank and IMF would be out of business altogether if they could no longer operate in and with the public sector. More generally, if the IFIs were to get serious about country ownership, there would be many fewer programmes. In conclusion, the concept of 'country ownership' has been used and abused in so many ways that it now is at best unhelpful and at worst misleading and obfuscating. When the statement 'this programme is country-owned' means no more than 'this programme is supported by the people who own the country', it is time to purge it from our vocabulary.
