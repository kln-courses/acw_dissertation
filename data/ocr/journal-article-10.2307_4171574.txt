Primary wood mahogany, secondary wood chestnut; with original finish, ormolu mounts, and mirror backs; marble tops not original; h. 82.5 cm., w. 110.5 cm., d. 49.5 cm.; and h. 83.8 cm., w. 111.75 cm., d. 50.75 cm. (dimensions excluding marble tops). Gift of the W. N. Banks Foundation. 1972.652-653. American furniture in the Empire style, much in demand during the first half of the nineteenth century, reflected a widespread enthusiasm for France as the arbiter of taste. Sympathy for France following its revolution ran high in the United States. At that time, eb6nistes like Charles-Honor6 Lannuier and Antoine-Gabrielle Quervelle left France to settle in our coastal cities, and their work quickly found its way into the most fashionable homes. Native American cabinetmakers in the early nineteenth century found inspiration for their designs in such publications as Recueil de d6corations int6rieures (1801) by the progenitors of the Empire style in France, Charles Percier and Pierre Fontaine. Although not a designer him- self, Pierre de la Mesangere reproduced the designs of his contemporaries in his periodicals Meubles et objets de goOts, from 1802 to 1835. English design books reflecting and interpreting the French style were also influential in America, particularly Thomas Hope's Household Furni- ture and Interior Decoration (1807) and George Smith's two books Household Furniture (1808) and Cabinetmaker's and Upholsterer's Guide (1826). French Empire furniture, with its handsome proportions, splendid ornamentation, and as- sociations with the art of ancient Greece and Rome, was admirably suited to the taste of the proud, newly independent and prosperous American middle class. The mahogany, pillared pier table epitomizes the imposing elegance of the style, and it was one of the first pieces of American-made furniture to be closely modeled after French Empire prototypes. The pier table, as its name implies, was designed to stand against the wall between a pair of windows. The top is relatively shallow, so as not to project too far into the room, but the mirrored back, by reflecting the front pair of legs, creates the illusion of greater depth and overall monumentality. The imposing appearance of the table is further emphasized by the architectural solidity of marble top, pillar and pilaster supports, and a heavy shelf base. Color is as important as form to the effect of Empire pier tables, which are richly ornamented with marble, mirror, highly figured mahogany veneers and ormolu caps, bases and mounts in classi- cal motifs. In many of the features just described, the Emmons and Archbald pier tables recently ac- quired by the museum are typical of their French prototypes and similar to pieces made in New York and Philadelphia. The ebonized ball feet with brass beading are particularly characteristic of Boston Empire furniture. Beneath the marble top of each table is stenciled EMMONS &amp; ARCHBALD No. 39 Orange Street (Boston) Cabinet, Chair &amp; Upholstery Manufactory Thomas Emmons and George Archbald are listed in the Boston Directory at the Orange Street address in 1813, 1816, and from 1820 to 1823. Thomas Emmons died in April 1825, at which time he and Archbald had moved their shop to 581 Washington Street (Orange Street was then a continuation of Washington, going toward Roxbury). On the evidence of their 92 labeling, it can be assumed that the pier tables were made between 1813 and 1825.</page><page sequence="3">The museum also possesses a pair of Emmons and Archbald card tables, the gift of the Misses Aimee and Rosamond Lamb (68.673-674). These tables bear the same stencil as the pier tables and were presumably also made between 1813 and 1825. At the time of his death in 1825, Thomas Emmons was more than fifteen thousand dollars in debt, principally in mortgages. Documents pertaining to the settlement of his estate include an inventory, several administrator's accounts and lists of debts, and newspaper notices of administrator's sales of his furniture and effects. Business was apparently good for Emmons and Archbald, despite the debt, for the inven- tory of Emmons' household belongings suggests that he lived very comfortably. The inventory of Emmons' portion of the workshop stock includes quantities of mahogany, rosewood, king- wood, whitewood, bay, chestnut, birch, ash, and more than four hundred feet of veneer; embossed velvet, hair cloth, French lace, yellow plush, and moquette for upholstery; and a large amount of hardware. Notice of the sale of cabinet stock in the Independent Chronicle and the Boston Patriot, June 1, 1825, mentions "a variety of elegant French CAPS and BASES, Rings, Knobs, and other Ornaments." This is evidence that the ormolu used on such pieces as the museum's pier tables may very well have been imported from France. 93</page><page sequence="4">94</page><page sequence="5">Some of the furniture from the Emmons and Archbald shop was also sold to settle Emmons' estate. The same newspaper announces on June 8, 1825, sale of "A number of articles of new FURNITURE, recently finished, made by the best workmet [sic] and in the newest style." In- cluded are "Grecian Card Tables," rosewood chairs with yellow plush seats, "1 white Italian Marble Slab for centre table," "2 elegant work tables," a sofa, sideboard washstand, easy chair, footstools, etc. George Archbald continued to be listed in the Boston Directory from 1825 to 1843, first at 581 Washington (the shop he shared with Emmons), then at 705 Washington (the location of Emmons' house at the time of his death), and finally at 695 Washington. His name does not appear after 1843, and there is no documentation pertaining to him at the Suffolk or Middlesex County probate courts. The Emmons and Archbald pier tables may well be the only pair of labeled American pier tables extant. They are most significant, both as fine, early Boston examples of high-style Empire furniture and for the relative precision with which they can be dated. G. S. W. Hanging vessel. Eastern Java, ca. 13th century; h. (excluding chain) 20 cm. Frederick L. Jack Fund. 1972.9. With the tenets of Hinduism and Buddhism the ancient Javanese inherited the cosmological concepts of the Indians. They visualized the world as the central continent of the universe, from which rose the mountain Meru, the pivot of the universe and the abode of the gods. The central continent was thought to be encircled by six concentric rings of land, separated from one another by seven oceans. The belief in Meru, the cosmic mountain, played a role of vital importance in the art and architecture of Southeast Asia. In Cambodia as well as in Indonesia elaborate architectural complexes were built as replicas of the cosmic mountain. On a much more modest scale the same ideas seem to have inspired the Eastern Javanese coppersmith who made this hanging vessel. The repouss6 lid has been given the shape of stylized mountains arranged in circles around a central peak. The oval body of the vessel was filled with water, symbolizing the oceans sur- rounding the foot of Mount Meru or the primordial ocean from which the nectar of the gods was churned, the pivotal mountain acting as a churning staff. The bowl is suspended from a chain fastened to two hooks, which are attached to the ves- sel by means of two square plaques with a stylized repousse decoration. An extension of the chain is fastened to the lid. The exact ritual use of this piece, of which several examples have been preserved, is unknown, but it is generally believed that this type of hanging vessel was used as a receptacle for holy water.

Cahn. 1971.241. Said to have been found many years ago in the Lago di Bracciano, this veristic portrait of a thin-faced old man with familiar features comes from an old European collection. The sur- faces have been cleaned extensively, but there are traces of a calcite deposit produced by long immersion in water, notably in the area above the upper right eyelid. The head, presumably from a bust after an original from a draped statue, seems to belong to the group of the bronze "Julius Caesar" in the Museo Nazionale Romano, which is to be regarded as a Renaissance creation based ultimately on a marble portrait of a Roman of about 50 B.C.' A second bronze head of this type, in the Galleria degli Uffizi, Florence, must be another Italian Renaissance product after one of the marble imperial copies or after a con- temporary Roman Republican original.2 The man portrayed in this sculpture looked strikingly like Julius Caesar, save that he had a peak of natural hair over the brow and a somewhat sharper face. There are, so it seems, no known clues as to his identity. Since a number of portraits of this man have survived, either in works from various periods of antiquity or as Renaissance interpretations, he must have been well known, presumably as a statesman and as the ancestor of men prominent in the Roman Empire. Based on the details of carving in the hair and around the eyes, this head is dated at the end of the first century or early in the second century after Christ. Such portraits of famous men were copied long after their deaths either because later ages admired their political views or so that many descendants could share a family heirloom. C. V. 1. See B. M.

Greek island marble; h. 37.5 cm. Edwin E. Jack Fund. 1971.393. This forthright young prince is the future Emperor Tiberius at the age of about twenty-three (19 B.C.). The portrait, head and neck, was probably carved when the Caesarwas in the East as chief legate of his father by adoption, the Emperor Octavius Caesar Augustus (ruled 31 B.C.- A.D. 14). The hair of the forehead and over the temples was evidently roughed away with a claw chisel after the statue was set up. This was done to receive a large, heavy crown, perhaps when Tiberius became emperor on the death of the founder of the Julio-Claudian dynasty. The statue probably showed the young man in the garb of a Greek magistrate, that is, wearing a chiton, or tunic, and a himation, or ample cloak. Tiberius was in Greece, Asia Minor, and Syria to negotiate a settlement with the kingdom of Parthia on the eastern Mesopotamian frontier. Roman legions under the Triumvir Crassus had been disastrously defeated by the Parthians at Carrhae (modern Harran), southwest of Edessa in northern Syria. One of the conditions of a lasting peace in the area was the return of the legionary standards and surviving prisoners taken by the Parthians. Tiberius was present at the final transfer and thus became a young hero throughout the East, since a pax Romana was effected that lasted for about eighty years. Many statues were set up, but this head seems to be one of the first documented survivors. Chronologically, the closest surviving freestanding portrait seems to be the marble head in the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek, Copenhagen, from Smyrna (Izmir), which shows Tiberius about 11 B.C., or at the age of thirty, when he married Augustus' daughter Julia.

Payne Fund. 1971.394. The infant Herakles was shown evidently as kneeling and grappling with two snakes, much in the manner and pose of the old Trojan priest Laocoon in the famous late Hellenistic group from Nero's Golden House in Rome. The chief difference is that Herakliskos is obviously triumphant, while Laocoon was being both bitten to death and strangled by his adversaries. Comparison with imperial bronze medallions struck by the Emperor Marcus Aurelius about the year 168 of the Christian era suggests that the head is a portrait of the future Emperor Commodus as a child or of his brother Annius Verus, more likely the latter. Annius Verus was born in 163 to the Empress Faustina the Younger and died at Praeneste in 170, much mourned by his father Marcus Aurelius. He had been given the title Caesar in 166 at the same time as Commodus. The statue could be a contemporary, that is, a lifetime, or a posthumous heroization, de- pending on the age of the child represented. Even if the face and features of Annius Verus- Herakliskos are too young for a boy of seven, the statue could still have been set up after the Caesar's death, being based on a prototype created in his babyhood. There are several other marble statues of the infant Herakles struggling with the snakes, but they present the hero as a chubby baby, do not as a rule have portrait features, and are prod- ucts of the precious, decorative Hellenistic rococo. This statue has turned the important mythological subject of Herakles' first triumph into a dramatic tour de force. Since the sculp- ture is based on the central figure of the Laocoon group, the style is more reflective of the Hellenistic baroque, which was widely revived in all media on all scales in the Antonine period of the Roman Empire. It is very likely that the sculptor saw the Laocoon group, as had Pliny the Elder nearly a hundred years previously, in Nero's old pleasure dome near the Flavian Amphitheater (the Colosseum). C.

Frederick Brown Fund. 1972.78. On one of his famous archaeological travels in Greece and Asia Minor, Karl Graf Lanckoronski acquired this most unusual monument of Greek art of the golden years of Praxiteles, Skopas, and their associates, shortly after the middle of the fourth century B.C. Mentioned in 1893 in the Catalogue of the Vienna Archaeological Exhibition (no. 1538), this relief soon became famous in the literature of extraordinary divinities and their iconography in Attica before the Hellenistic age. The sculpture remained in the possession of the Lanckoronski family until 12 June 1967, when the Countess Adelheid Lanckoronska sold it, and other marbles, at Sotheby's in London (as lot 21). The buyers, Munzen und Medaillen, A.G. of Basel, exhibited the double- sided relief at the Andre Emmerich Gallery, New York, from 7 February to 13 March 1968 (Art of the Ancients: Greeks, Etruscans anc/ Roimanis, no. 44). In due course it returned to Switzer- land, where it was acquired for the Museum of Fine Arts in July 1971. The scenes of Helios anid MWn, particularly the sun god in his chariot, have been associated 102</page><page sequence="13">with the artists responsible for the small frieze of charioteers on the Mausoleum at Halikarnas- sos, one of the Seven Wonders of the World. It was probably carved in the workshop of Bryaxis the Elder in Athens, when he returned from executing his share of the great sepulchral commission for the king and queen of Caria. On the first side, Helios, wearing a long chiton and with a nimbus behind his head, drives the four horses of the sun in an open gallop across the front of the relief's architectural niche. The composition is one developed in Greek painting in the last quarter of the fifth century B.C. On the second side, Men, the moon god from westerni Asia Minor, is represented in frontal view and seated "side-saddle" on a large ram; behind is a crescent moon of equal dimensions. In front is a table with votive offerings, which is approached by two bearded men, a youth, and a child, hands raised in worship. A cock arid a hen are under the table. The cult of Men was introduced to Attica shortly after 400 B.C., when Atheins had political and commercial contacts with the Persian Empire. Of the few reliefs of this class that have sur- vived from before the Hellenistic or Graeco-Roman periods, this monument, despite the obvi- ous damage it has suffered, is the finest and most significant. C. V. 103</page><page sequence="14">Medallion of Commodus. Roman, A.D. 190-191; bronze; diam. 41 mm. Gift of Mr. and Mrs. Cornelius C. Vermeule lI/. 1972.975. Commodus, the last of the Antonine emperors, began his sole rule in A.D. 180, following the death of his father, Marcus Aurelius. An unpopular emperor, he concentrated on his own pleasures, ignoring the welfare of his people. He was the object of a number of assassination attempts, one of which finally succeeded in A.D. 192. On a superb bronze medallion recently presented to the collections, a draped and cuirassed bust of Commodus faces to the right, his hair bound by a laurel wreath. This is an expressive portrait of the ruler, with his distinctive profile and deeply set eyes that stare slightly upward. In the later years of his reign Commodus often assumed the attributes of Hercules on his coinage, just as in his daily life he came to expect the worship of that divinity for himself. The only hint of that on this medallion is his fixed gaze toward the heavens. The inscription celebrates victories by Roman armies in Britain some years before the medallion was struck. On the reverse, Sol, personification of the sun, appears at the left, wearing a radiate crown. With a whip in his right hand and holding the reins in his left, he steps into a quadriga which will mount immediately up into the heavens. The feet of the rearing horses touch a bank of clouds. Ahead of the horses is Lucifer holding a torch. At the right is the reclining figure of Tellus, the earth personified, holding a cornucopia to symbolize abundance. The reverse sug- gests Commodus' close relationship with the sun and the earth, a theme more appropriate to an emperor who was concerned with procuring a good life for his people. Probably originally a presentation piece on a special occasion such as New Year's day, the medallion not only pro- vided an excellent likeness of the emperor but also associated his rule with a beneficial deity who could bring prosperity to the earth. This medallion was published in 1912 by F. Gnecchi in his famous corpus / Medaglioni Romani as formerly a part of the Martinetti collection. It can be traced through four auctions from 1907 to 1950, the latter being for the collection of Henry Platt Hall, sold in London. The museum has a number of medallions of Commodus, but this high-relief example, struck at the mint of Rome in A.D. 190-191, is surely one of the finest, having been treasured by its original 104 recipient and well preserved over the centuries prior to its arrival in Boston.

One variation of the Greek oinochoe, or wine pitcher, is slender, with the neck and body profile forming a continuous curve. Such a vessel is called an olpe by archaeologists. It was probably used as a well dipper as well as a pouring jug. The olpe that has recently entered the museum's collections is an excellent Attic black- figured example, exhibiting considerable influence from contemporary Corinthian ware. A figured panel runs around the belly of the vase. Two panthers stand with their bodies in profile facing the center of the panel and their heads facing the viewer. This type of composi- tion is characteristic of the Corinthianizing "heraldic animals style" popular among Attic vase painters in the early sixth century B.C. Between the panthers is a Corinthian helmet in profile, facing left. Along the edges of the helmet are touches of white, a Corinthian mannerism that indicates the holes piercing the helmet's edge where an inner lining was attached. In the space around the animals are Corinthian rosettes, although they are not crowded together so densely as on Corinthian ware. The composition is enlivened with touches of red (on the faces, necks, chests, flanks, and bellies of the panthers and on the rosettes) and other touches of white (on the tops of the panthers' heads, around their eyes and on their claws, on the helmet's crest and on the rosettes). Similar Corinthianizing compositions can be seen on other vases in the museum's collec- tion from the same period. For instance, a Euboean amphora (13.75) shares the olpe's heraldic panthers, although the decorative element between them is a double palmette. Heraldic sphinxes and other monsters decorate an Attic hydria (76.34); heraldic lions appear on an Attic tripod kothon (98.915) and on an Attic skyphos (97.366). These same creatures appear also in ceramic frieze compositions, as on a Chalcidian crater (01.8040) and an Attic lebes (34.212), both ca. 575-550 B.C. All of these are comparable to Corinthian heraldic and frieze compositions (cf. skyphos 03.809; pyxis 24.499). All the vases cited by accession number are on display in the classical department's first-floor gallery of archaic Greek art. E. M.

Friedman Fund. 1971.638. Jackson Pollock's paintings, and above all those from his "classical" period, 1947-1950, were pioneering for the New York School. Not only did they lead the way for the painterly type of abstraction of the 1940's and 1950's but, in their eschewal of depicted forms for the sake of a more direct, expressive use of the materials of paintings and in their allover, fieldlike articula- tion, they continue to have relevance for and influence on younger painters today. The first purchase of the new Department of Contemporary Art and now the cornerstone of the contemporary collection, Number 10 was executed at the height of Pollock's "classical" period. Working over and in his canvas, which was laid out upon the floor, Pollock dripped and spattered industrial pigments like black Duco enamel and aluminum paint across the sur- face. Since he was essentially a draughtsman, his drip technique was a way to avoid habits of the wrist by making rhythms from broad arm movements; he wished also to free line from its traditional shape-defining function and at the same time to render it painterly. The result was a new kind of structure - the allover picture in which on the initial encounter the same ele- ments seemed to be repeating themselves from edge to edge. Here the problem was to avoid both disorder and those mechanical rhythms which often result from motor actions. Number 10 is especially instructive in this regard, for it shows exceptional clarity and variety of accent; it has a charged liveliness and evenness of visual pressure from edge to edge. The drip technique and allover composition could easily result in a framed, inert piece of painted texture. Or the looping skeins of black pigment could create "holes." In Number 10 the black, dancelike rhythms play in and out of an atmosphere created by the glowing aluminum and smaller splashes of more positive hues. The result is a rich, dense, and con- tinuous pictorial fabric, which at the same time is light-filled and airy. And as is often the case in Pollock's pictures of this period, this work shows a slacking of attack, a diminution of density at the very edges. The effect is slight but enough to convey a sense of delimitation a sense that we are looking at a self-contained picture. Number 10 is one of a series of long, friezelike paintings done in 1949. Pollock's method of working across the surface must have suggested to him this very unorthodox format, which has a superficial resemblance to oriental scroll paintings. Actually they are, as is the case with all of Pollock's pictures, firmly in the tradition of Western easel painting; that is, they are meant to be seen at a single glance. For this reason these pictures raise spatial issues and prob- lems: the extended length determines the proper distance for the viewer as some distance from the surface. Yet the scale of incident is far more a question of the picture's relatively narrow width. Again this is solved in Number 10 with a rightness and surety that indicate that we are dealing with a masterwork. K. M. 106</page><page sequence="17">JL~ ~ ~ ~~~~~.

Railroad Horse. 1971; acrylic on canvas; 240.0 x 769.6 cm. Charles H. Hayden Fund. 1971.639. Larry Poons, who studied for a time at the Boston Museum School, first came to prominence in the early 1960's with a series of stained pictures showing small dots on a large field. The em- phasis was mainly on color and optical vibrations. Despite the great popularity of these paintings, Poons himself came to feel that they were not good enough, and around 1968 he began to accept the influence of Jules Olitski in an effort to challenge himself more deeply. The thickly painted, Olitski-derived pictures that he has executed in the last few years again gained critical recognition, but it is only in the last year that Poons has broken through to something truly personal and distinctly his own. As was true of Pollock's dripping and Olitski's use of the spray gun, a new and unconven- tional technique of applying paint has led Poons to a new style: he now throws buckets of paint against lengths of canvas (sometimes toned) stapled to the walls all around the studio. The paint streams and pours down the surface; then it is a question of cropping, that is, "find- ing" pictures in the whole. The result is a new kind of layout or composition and new effects of color (skeins are interwoven but not mixed). The most ambitious picture that Poons has thus far attempted, Railroad Horse, is a spectacu- lar twenty-five feet long. But it is not rhetorical; on the contrary, it belongs in the Impression- ist tradition of light and color nuances. The real precedent here is Monet's late style: the painterly handling, continuous fieldlike effect developing across the surface, and light-filled iridescent pastel colors - pink, rose, violet, yellow, pale blue. But Monet, at least in his Lily Pads, had continually to confront the disjunction caused by the perspective of the water's surface and the new and forcefully asserted flatness of the sur- face. Poons, on the other hand, organizes totally abstractly, that is, totally in terms of the surface. This is especially evident at the top, where, instead of a horizon, one finds a straight band of mustard yellow. This band squares off the whole, makes it into a self-contained picture, and inexplicably causes the salmon-stained area below to bite into the thickly built-up area. Despite its size, complexity, and richness, Railroad Horse has a compelling singleness of im- pact. And its double movement of undulating horizontality and the vertical cascading of thick gel-fortified acrylic paint evoke something of the feeling of a grand and gorgeous event in nature. K.

Usually associated with the second-generation Abstract Expressionists, Robert Goodnough has long been recognized as a highly gifted and accomplished artist. But unlike the work of most of his contemporaries, his art has retained a specifically late Cubist or even Synthetic Cubist look. A few years ago Goodnough simplified and refined his style in such a way as to make Cubist planes and collagelike effects deliver a very fresh un-Cubist kind of picture. In this way Goodnough has raised the level of quality of his works and achieved a far more personal style. Delicate grey and white angular planes are painted in clusters, usually near one of the upper corners of a raw canvas surface sized with a coat of very thin glue. The planes have a bas-relief or collagelike look, which is achieved by building up layers of paint, usually lighter over darker ones. The general opaqueness of these planes together with their different degrees of shininess and mattness, and the ridge left by their masked edges all make them cut away from the canvas while emphasizing by contrast its bare and threaded wovenness. More recently Goodnough has begun to loosely brush in the previously blank areas of raw canvas, and the nine-foot square Slate Grey Statement is the first in the new series. Here he uses a shade of grey different from that of the chips, but, as with his previous work, the pic- ture still depends on subtle tonalities and a shifting play between the literal and the pictorial. An absorbent and fugitive grey is informed with the crisp immediacy and tactile presence of the chips. The field is large, soft, warm, and transparent; the chips are small, sharp, cool in tone, and opaque. Moreover, the two areas set up contrasting but complementary types of pic- torial movement, one swirling, the other fluttering upward. Yet the planes remain very close in value to the field, giving the whole a wonderful, atmospheric, silvery unity. Goodnough seems to be aiming for a particular kind of fragile and ethereal weightlessness within a monu- mental format. K.

Open in Ochre. 1967-1970; acrylic on canvas; 233.7 x 175.3 cm. Charles H. Hayden Fund. 1972.211. For over twenty years Robert Motherwell has been recognized as one of the three or four out- standing painters of the New York School. He is perhaps best known for his sensitive collages and a series of paintings entitled "Elegies to the Spanish Republic." The latter show bold looped forms and rectangles painted in black and strung out across a white ground. Loosely painted and light and dark in structure, these pictures seem to relate to the "gesture" wing of Abstract Expressionism along with the work of Pollock, Kline, and de Kooning. But Mother- well's "Open" series, begun in 1967, meant for him a new departure, a kind of painting that one associates more with the color fields of Newman and Rothko. In a typical "Open" picture two vertical lines are dropped from the upper edge of the pic- ture and joined by a horizontal one. This creates a kind of rectangular form within a mono- chromatic field of color. The lines refuse to specify or enclose a shape but merely activate the implied color field and acknowledge its flat, two-dimensional structure. These pictures display all of those distinctive features which we have come to associate with Motherwell's art: the tremulous intensity present in the lines and edges; a remarkable feeling for scale and interval; a sensitive touch and use of underpainting; and a taste for neu- trals - black, white, and earth colors. Open in Ochre represents a special place in the series. The artist worked on it over a three- year period (1967-1970), and it is more complex because of the greater number of lines and the use of three rather than of two colors. Also, the lines here are painted rather than affixed charcoal as is usually the case. While most of the "Open" pictures tend toward lightness, elegance, and purity of feeling, Open in Ochre is dry, dense, and seemingly awkward. With its repainting and pedimenti the ochre looks almost muddy, but this unevenness of surface gives to the picture a slight sugges- tion of internal light and air without diminishing its uncompromising flatness. The black lines seem tentative and out of kilter, but their deviations as measured by the rectangle of the sup- port lend a special poignance to their graphic life. And the narrow, parallel white lines, which seem almost an afterthought, stabilize and flatten the eccentric twist created by the black ones. The triumph of Open in Ochre lies exactly in its expressive exploitation of a difficult, unart- ful, and labored look. Herein lies its essential quality, its somber nobility. It is the sort of paint- ing that improves on repeated viewing and for this reason its quality is all the more secure and lasting. K. M. 113</page><page sequence="24">Ovoid jar. North Syria, Ninevite V, ca. 2900 B.C.; clay with violet-brown paint over buff slip; h. 38 cm., diam. (max.) 34.2 cm. Otis Norcross Fund. 1971.346. The ancient Assyrian city of Nineveh was located on the east bank of the Tigris River (which, along with the Euphrates, gave Mesopotamia its name - land of the rivers). This city was for several millennia an important link in the northern Mesopotamian trade routes between Iran to the east and North Syria to the west. The painted pottery from the archaeological level V at Nineveh is particularly interesting because it represents a survival of prehistoric Iranian tradi- tions known from sites such as Tepe Sialk and Tepe Hissar, combined with new elements of the transition from the protohistoric Jemdet Nasr Period to the first Early Dynastic Period in Meso- potamia. In addition to a number of sites in Assyria and northwestern Iran, Ninevite V painted pottery has been discovered in the Khabur River Valley of North Syria. It is to the examples known from the Khabur region that the museum's recently acquired vessel is most closely related. The form of this ovoid jar, though somewhat lacking in elegance, is a suitable vehicle for the interesting painted decoration. The vessel seems to be handmade, rather than wheel- turned, although the latter technique is said to be more common in this tradition. The original surface of the clay was covered with a beige slip before the violet-brown painted decoration was added, no doubt to assure the proper application of the paint and to heighten the contrast with the background. The painted decoration is distributed over the surface of the jar in four separate areas, which are closely related to its form. The body of the vessel is divided into two zones, each of which is outlined by a continuous band of paint at the inner edge. The larger, upper zone contains the main decoration, the sil- houette of a mountain goat in four separate metopes, or panels. Each panel is outlined with a band of paint and separated from the other elements of the decoration by a geometric design. The artist has captured, with obvious affection, the playful spirit of the mountain goat, if not its exact form. The delightful, angular stylization of the animal's body is complemented by the undulating line of the horns sweeping back from the triangular head. At the rear, the wispy strands of the tail hang freely. The lower zone is more simply decorated with concentric bands, in four groups, which are rendered as if suspended from the encircling band above. The neck, with its everted rim, and the ring base are both decorated with painted bands. J.

Egypt, Dynasty 18, probably reigns of Hatshepsut and Thutmose IlIl, 1490-1436 B.C.; granite; h. 38 cm., w. 28 cm. Edward J. and Mary S. Ho/mes Fund. 1972.359. Although the Museum of Fine Arts is fortunate in having one of the finest collections of sculp- ture of the Old Kingdom, the era of the great pyramids, the excavations conducted by the museum and to which the museum contributed did not provide us with an equally significant representation of the sculpture of the New Kingdom. Of three recently acquired statues of this period the one assigned to the official Ah-mose, called Pa-tjenna, is the most impressive and now occupies a position of honor in our galleries. It is the upper half from a pair statue of the official and his wife. Son of the well-known Viceroy of Nubia Ah-mose Turo and grandson of one of the earliest viceroys, Ah-mose Si-Tayit, the representative of the third generation, though not as prestigious, probably flourished in the reigns of Hatshepsut and Thutmose IlIl around 1450 B.C. The round face contrasts with the narrower faces of his monarchs, yet the softness of expression is in keeping with the finest sculpture of the time of Hatshepsut and Thutmose Ill. The expression of the face conveys a seriousness of purpose without severity and embodies an ideal of the Egyptian Wisdom Literature, the truly silent man in the temple before his god. With a double wig setting off his face, he looks forward at the viewer, the left hand holding a folded napkin, and the right arm hanging down beside his missing wife. The sleeve of the gar- ment, the absence of the nipples, and the way the left arm is swathed in an ambiguous robe are the only indications in the upper part of the statue that the man wears a robe, for no indi- cation is made at the neck to show the seam. The identification of the official can be estab- lished from one of the two fragments of the seat found with it, with the name "[Ah]-mose, called Pa-tjenna" inscribed on the side. W. K.

Francis Welch Fund. 1972.985. The true perfection of a painted window is to be serene, intense, brilliant, like flaming jewellery; full of easily legible and quaint subjects, and exquisitely subtle, yet simple, in its harmonies. John Ruskin, The Stones of Venice This hitherto unknown panel of German stained glass, acquired recently for the Department of European Decorative Arts and Sculpture, is published here for the first time. Small as it is, the panel is a perfect illustration of the not always fully recognized fact that the leading paint- ers of the German Renaissance - Durer, Holbein, Baldung Gruen, and their satellites and suc- cessors - were also great designers for stained glass.' The depiction of Saint Jerome, with folded hands, meditating over an open manuscript (his Latin translation of the Bible), his lion at his feet, is surely based on a working drawing by Hans von Kulmbach, a leading Nuremberg master in the entourage of Albrecht Durer. 118</page><page sequence="29">Apparently the panel is the only one of a set representing the Four Doctors of the Church to have survived. In what context these panels were placed we do not know. However, among the great number of Kulmbach's working drawings for stained-glass windows that have been preserved, there is a magnificent one in the library of Erlangen University that obviously be- longs to this set.2 The drawing depicts another doctor of the Church, Gregory, Ambrosius, or Augustine, framed by a similar quatrefoil decorated with inhabited scrollwork. Proportions and composition are identical; the only difference is in the subject matter of the inhabited scroll. In the drawing there are devils and dragons; in the glass painting there are female nudes and birds picking at clusters of berries. In every stroke of the black lines of this glass painting, in the tiny parallel hatchings, in the design and modeling of drapery and face and figure, the hand of Kulmbach is revealed. The panel is in the style of the early years of the sixteenth century, still in the manner of Durer, but already betraying an independent, experienced, and mature draftsman. The tendency to merge the whole into a complicated network of forms, to crowd too much into a given space, is still noticeable. The modeling is not yet wholly homogenized; it still shows traces of the older Nuremberg Gothic tradition. The nudes in the frame still recall Durer's Four Witches of 1497. The magic of transparent light, characteristic of Durer's later graphic work, seems to be fore- cast, if not already achieved, by the medium - the-painted glass - and the luminous trans- parency of its colors: the ruby red of the cloak and hat of Jerome, in the attire of a cardinal, set against the foliated deep blue of the background and of the four semicircular inserts at the angles of the golden yellow quatrefoil frame. It is this transparency that in Ruskin's words is the "great spiritual character" of glass, "the character by which in church architecture it be- comes most touchingly impressive, as typical of the entrance of the Holy Spirit into the heart of man."3 Ruskin's valuation and definition of the essential qualities of the art of glass paint- ing can be traced back to the thirteenth century, to the Rationale Divinorum Officiorum of Gulielmus Durandus, but they still hold true. H. S. 1. A fragment of a cartoon in the Department of Prints and Drawings depicting The Fall of the Rebel Angel, for a stained-glass window allegedly by Durer in the Landauer Chapel, Nuremberg, commissioned in 1508 (destroyed in World War II), is now attributed to Hans von Kulmbach.

What might appear to be a semantic error in the choice of the term "porcelain" to describe faience is more indicative of motives that gave rise to the enormous Delft production of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The use of the word "porcelain" in this context was wishful thinking. Occasionally such confusion of terminology, innocent and, one would wager, sometimes intentional, resulted, in fact, in lawsuits that were intended to clarify the situation. Europe, from the sixteenth century on, was fascinated by the Orient and especially by the qual- ity, beauty, and the undiscovered secret of fine, true porcelain, whose production was un- known in the West until Bottger's breakthrough under the heavy pressure of Augustus the Strong in 1707 at Meissen. "A porcellana" ware, faience produced in sixteenth-century Italy at Siena (see MFA 55.831), and the few examples of "Medici" porcelain that exist (see MFA 12.717)2 indicate something of the intense desire of the European pottery trade and its patrons to achieve in ceramics what was possible only for the Orient. First contacts were made by the Dutch with China in 1596, and there soon followed impor- tation of Chinese porcelain to the Netherlands, largely through the network of the Dutch East India Company. Distribution of Chinese porcelain throughout the Netherlands was brought about by means of large auctions such as that held in Delft in 1615, and the magnetic attrac- tion of Dutch pottery maker and buyer alike to the prized oriental ware found its issue in con- tinued attempts to reproduce the imported material with only European materials (without kaolin, the pure ingredient of true porcelain) and with technical understanding only of faience and its tradition. In the history of Delft production a constant but not exclusive goal is the reproduction and emulation of the surface, design, coloring, decoration, and thematic mate- rial of oriental porcelain. The demand for Delftware was extraordinary within and without the Netherlands. Much of the production was, of course, routine. The form given by the many potters and factories was predominantly useful, often purely decorative, occasionally inspired, and extremely original. The earliest of this group of five pieces in our collection is generically related to the rest, even though it may be difficult at this time to assign the piece to Delft itself. Of warm white body, scallop edged and lobed, or gadrooned, the small dish presents a lively quality: the brightness and humor of the yellow and blue border design and the freshness of the winged putto decorating the center. Lobed dishes such as this are comparatively rarer than the more ordinary flatware. Still, the effect is of simplicity tempered by considerable verve - entirely a function of the decoration. Except for the decoration of this piece, one might well look to London, Lambeth, or Bristol for its origins, where Dutch potters are known to have worked, and where similarities of shape and surface often make separation of the English ware from the Dutch difficult. A teapot of the late seventeenth century presents something of a mystery concerning its 1. De Plateelbakker of Delftsch Aardwerk Maaker [The Delftware Potter, or Delft Faience Maker] (1794). Translation in C. H. de Jonge, Delft Ceramics (New York: Praeger, 1970), p. 11. (Plateelbakker is the Dutch term for Delftware potter.) 2. Arthur Lane, "A Rediscovered Cruet Medici Porcelain," Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, Bulletin 56, no. 304 (1958), 77-83. 121</page><page sequence="32">function, if not its style. Unmarked, the teapot shows direct quotations of figures in a land- scape and a tea ceremony derived from the repertoire of Chinese "transitional" porcelain (ca. 1630-1650). In style and coloring the piece suggests associations with the production of the Grieksche A ("Greek A") factory of the latter part of the seventeenth century. Of interest is the fact that the teapot is of one piece and was apparently not destined for use, therefore made to serve a decorative function as a shelf piece or a collector's item. Some of the special appeal of this small teapot lies in the quality of drawing and the richness of blues, almost becoming black in some areas of the design. A covered butter dish with stand neatly represents for our collection and our public the marriage of East and West, the absorption by Delft potters of the oriental example. The but- ter dish is signed "Z Dex," indicating Zacharias Dextra, who was manager in 1712 and owner in 1721-1757 of the Delft factory Die Drie Vergulde Astonnekens (The Three Golden Ash Barrels). The stand, or plate, is porcelain, probably Japanese of the eighteenth century and possibly made for export. The covered dish seeks frankly to reproduce the character and ap- pearance of its oriental companion. The shape of the plate is octagonal, while the curvilinear outline of the cover expresses eighteenth-century western European taste freed from the prior restrictions imposed both by the plate and the desire of the potter to fit and complement it. How clearly the potter was able to approximate in faience the ornament, color, and surface of the oriental porcelain original testifies to the technical achievement, sympathy for, and understanding of the model presented as the basis for the set. That Delft production found markets abroad and wide distribution is well known and amply demonstrated by a superb blue and white plate with the mark of the factory "De Paeuw" ("The Peacock"). Displayed over the surface of this large plate are peacocks, insects, lush foliage and flowers, which give the plate an exotic flavor not surprisingly oriental in character. The drawing is strong, the design knowing, the blues rich and controlled; the quality is well above the ordinary. Enclosed within a wreath on the rim is the name "Nathaniell Thorne," obviously that of an Englishman, undoubtedly the proud owner who commissioned the plate or possibly a service of plates and related ware. At the present nothing more is known of the man than his fondness for excellent Delftware! In 1718 the DePaeuw factory, which made the Nathaniell Thorne plate, finished a large bust of the Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius Antoninus, called Caracalla (A.D. 188-217). Con- sidered in the light of Delft production in general, the Delft Caracalla is an exceptionally am- bitious work. The figure is identified by the monogram composed of the letters "M," "A," and double, opposed "C" on the base and perhaps further by the letters "K" and "B" on each side of the base, which might refer to the fact that this emperor was also entitled "Koning van Brittanje" (King of Britain). Decorated only in blue and white, the well-modeled figure is pre- sented upon a rich, gadrooned base, with which it is a unit. Caracalla, crowned and wearing a cuirass with gorgon's head ornament, is represented gazing away from the frontal viewer, a device that gives this important faience "portrait" a measure of psychological content. Figural work from the Delft factories is of course known; it is rarer when earlier in date and, in any case, much less frequently found than functional forms, decorative vessels, plaques, or tiles. Figurines (for example, an amusing, early eighteenth-century figure of a monk, MFA 1970.371), diminutive busts of biblical figures, secular figures made later in the eighteenth cen- tury are occasionally encountered. There is a fine female (portrait?) bust in Brussels. The Rijksmuseum owns a bust (William of Orange?) slightly earlier than ours but of approximately the same size. At present no explanation can be given for the choice by a Delft factory of the 122</page><page sequence="33">subject a personage from Roman history and Caracalla in particular beyond continuing fascination in humanistic circles with antiquity. Such interest perpetuated itself frequently and variously, for instance, through such volumes as /cones Imperatorum (a copy of which, pub- lished in Antwerp in 1645, is in the collection of the Department of Prints and Drawings, 64.397).3 Beyond its exceptional quality, then, our Caracalla is an important document for the history of Delft faience, not only because of its grand size and ambitious conception but also because of the translation of this particular subject into the medium of Delft faience. These five pieces of Delftware are excellent - and in one case, distinguished - examples from a growing ceramics collection that illustrate moments and directions in the history of "De Plateelbakker" and his craft.

Landscape with waterwheel and boy fish- ing. 1853; oil on canvas; 76.2 cm. x 63.8 cm. Robert 1. Edwards Fund, Juliana Cheney Edwards Collection. 1971.53. The Missouri artist George Caleb Bingham is generally known for his genre and river scenes (such as The Squatters of 1850 and Wood Boatmen on a River [Western Boatmen Ashore by Night] of 1854, both in our collection), and portraits. Nevertheless, according to Maurice Bloch, author of the definitive catalogue of Bingham's work, documentary evidence shows that he painted a body of landscapes between the late 1830's and 1853, although less than half of these have been located.' Landscape with waterwheel (the original title is undetermined) was only recently dis- covered, having descended in the family of the original Illinois owner. The painting has the additional distinction of being possibly the only extant dated work of 1853. Shortly after that time, Bingham's interest in landscape painting declined, and apart from a few examples painted in Dusseldorf in the late 1850's and after an excursion to Colorado in 1872, Bingham did not direct his attention to landscapes again. 124 1. Maurice Bloch, George Caleb Bingham (Berkeley, California: University of California Press, 1967).</page><page sequence="35">The ordered composition and studied use of color, evident in all of Bingham's work, sug- gest that the museum's painting is a composite of landscape elements probably worked up in the studio rather than painted en plein air. The fisherman does not appear to inhabit the scene but seems to have been placed there to provide scale. Dark foreground foliage frames a pool in the middle ground before a milldam and mill. The curving waterwheel and spokes, the diagonal supports of the milldam lead to the limited far distance of trees hazy against the sky. The calculated placement and shape of the individual components and the arrangement of light create a harmoniously structured, serene painting. Bloch mentions the relationship of Bingham's landscapes to those of certain eighteenth- century English artists, specifically George Morland, whose work was proliferated by means of engravings after his paintings. Primarily, however, like other American painters of the nine- teenth century, Bingham was caught up by an enthusiasm to record the American environment on canvas at a time when it was beginning to change irrevocably. His landscapes, as well as the genre and river scenes, suggest sensitively and objectively the atmosphere of rural, even fron- tier, nineteenth-century America, without specific topographical references. It is as if the essential has been distilled without inconsequential details. L. G. FREDERICK CHILDE HASSAM, American, 1859-1935. Looking Across Boston Common. 1918; oil on panel; 25.4 cm. x 35.8 cm. Arthur Gordon Tomkins Fund. 1972.917. The Museum of Fine Arts has added to its American impressionist pictures a remarkable little painting by the Boston-born artist Childe Hassam. Looking Across Boston Common joins a</page><page sequence="36">relatively small collection of paintings by Hassam (the others dating from the mid-1880's to about 1910), although the museum is rich in his prints and drawings. The influence of the French impressionists Monet, Pissarro, and Sisley, after whom Hassam initially modeled his work, can easily be recognized in this painting - an influence that began during the artist's three-year stay in Paris from 1886 to 1889. Painted with the short, broken brushstrokes of the impressionists, the picture is full of light, clear and bright in the foreground and turning to hazy brilliance in the far distance over the buildings. One of the most striking aspects of Looking Across Boston Common is the sense of space created by the use of a very deep perspective, a device that fascinated Hassam and is often found in his work. Although by 1918 Hassam had settled and was painting in New York City, continuing his association with the "Ten American Painters" (of which he was a founding member in 1898), he still visited his favorite parts of New England in the summer. It is possible that Looking Across Boston Common was painted in one of his summer haunts (Gloucester, perhaps) from an earlier sketch. But the work conveys such a strong feeling of spontaneity and immediacy that it is hard to believe that it was not executed directly. L. C. L. ERNEST LAWSON, American, 1873-1939. Street Scene. Oil on canvas; 80 cm. x 59.7 cm. Charles Henry Hayden Fund. 1972.919. The development of twentieth-century American art may be traced from the formation in 1908 of "The Eight," or Ashcan School, as critics derisively called this social-realist group because of its choice of subject matter. Under the leadership of Robert Henri, "The Eight" was com- posed of artists with disparate backgrounds and styles, including Ernest Lawson, William Glack- ens, George Luks, and John Sloan, who broke with prevailing academic taste and established directions and exhibited as a group at the Macbeth Gallery in New York. Before joining "The Eight," Lawson had studied at the Art Students League in New York, with John Twachtman and J. Alden Weir in Connecticut, and at the Academie Julian in Paris. During this period, the 1890's, he absorbed impressionist tendencies, which he formed into an individual style. Possessing few impressionist qualities, the dusky Manhattan Street Scene is illustrative of "The Eight's" innovative emphasis on the American city and American life without sentimen- tality; it is also characteristic of Lawson's personal concentration on the environs of New York. The broad handling, the palette (earthy browns, blues, touches of olive green and yellow), the tunnel-like composition - all suggest the dark, sooty atmosphere and energy of the city. The painting is signed and probably dates from about 1910-1920. L. G. 126</page><page sequence="37">127</page><page sequence="38">128</page><page sequence="39">PAUL CEZANNE, French, 1839-1906. Self-Portrait with a Beret. Ca. 1900; oil on canvas; 63.5 cm. x 50.9 cm. Charles H. Bayley Fund. Partial gift of Elizabeth Paine Metcalf. 1972.950. Certainly one of the most important paintings to come to the Museum of Fine Arts in many years, Self-Portrait with a Beret takes a special place in the collection. The painting was first lent to the museum in 1929 by Robert Treat Paine 11, father of Elizabeth Paine Metcalf, and thereafter was lent to us on a regular basis until 1944. It has a complete provenance, having first been in the collection of the artist Egisto Fabbri in Florence, passing then to the publisher Paul Rosenberg before coming into the Paine collection. The work has been shown in several special exhibitions;' it has been published by Meyer Schapiro and Lionello Venturi2 and is in- cluded in John Rewald's forthcoming definitive catalogue raisonn6 of Cezanne paintings. Cezanne is known to have painted twenty-five self-portraits, the majority of which are in France. The Boston self-portrait, probably the last painted by this great artist, is the second to be acquired by an American museum; the other, dating from 1878-80, is in the Phillips Collec- tion, Washington, D.C. Self-Portrait with a Beret joins four other paintings by Cezanne in the Boston Museum: the earlier and extremely fine portrait of Madame C6zanne, a bequest from the Paine collection; a still life; and two landscapes. In this portrait Cezanne's mastery of color and construction is apparent. The paint is laid on thinly, yet in a way that is nearly sculptural as the planes of color come against each other, advance and recede and at the same time model the figure. C6zanne has portrayed himself almost without emotion, in a mood that seems remote and solitary, yet appearing at one with himself. L. C. L. 1.

Oil on canvas; 63.2 cm. x 76.5 cm. Ernest Wadsworth Longfellow Fund. 1972.981. Exhibited at the Royal Academy in the spring of 1777, together with the final version of The Copley Family (National Gallery, Washington), lost sight of for over a century until its reappear- ance late in 1971 at a Sotheby sale in London (as a Benjamin West, The Adoration of the Shep- herds), John Singleton Copley's The Nativity was placed on permanent exhibition in the Mu- seum of Fine Arts, appropriately enough, shortly before Christmas 1972. Professor Jules D. Prown of Yale, author of major studies on Copley, had made correct identification of the paint- ing when it was in a London dealer's after the Sotheby sale, and Clifford Ackley of the mu- seum's Department of Prints and Drawings was instrumental in recommending the painting's acquisition by the trustees. The Nativity was remembered, before 1971, from a series of three mezzotints and two drawings, the latter of the Virgin's veiled head and the classical white drap- ery of her body and legs. The first of these drawings has long belonged to the museum. Pro- fessor Prown owns the second.' Copley's Nativity has been recognized as a crucial painting of the transition from the artist's American to his English career. More than this, the small, highly finished oil, once called "a sketch," is a synthesis of Copley's New England heritage, his newly completed Continental travels, and his initial striving for recognition as more than just a popular portraitist of the Lon- don scene. Mary in her long white "Grecian" costume with its red sash and the infant Jesus on his big pillow have been inserted in a composition based ultimately on a Roman sacrifice of the seventeenth or sixteenth century A.D., a Raphael or a Domenichino with sources in an- tiquity. This seems more than natural, since Copley's sketchbooks must have been full of his Italian impressions, and since the Virgin Mary was undoubtedly Mrs. Copley and the Christ Child their new daughter Susanna. Three shepherds arrive, and a seated Joseph receives them. The man seen from behind, pointing in baroque fashion and looking back, may be the innkeeper; he may be waiting for the Wise Men, or ushering them in after the shepherds. Copley, with his twenty acres on Bea- con Hill, was enough of a farmer to separate the ass, in a low box stall, from the bovines. The light from the sky at the upper left is clearly heavenly, from the star of Bethlehem, since the full moon itself appears through the open window at the right. All colors are warm, some almost rich, and the shadows are not overplayed. Mary's sash echoes the reddish scarlet of one of the shepherd's ample cloaks. The woven rug thrown about the foreground balances the ac- tions or gestures of figures and animals against the intense concentration of Mother on Child. The wall in the upper left goes from golden yellow to brown, where the angle is in the shadow. Copley's Nativity symbolized the artist's long journey from Boston to London by way of Rome. In the capital of the English-speaking world he was reunited with his family at a very crucial hour in the history of his native land. The Nativity represented bonds with artistic achievement forever past and hopes for a future that never was to match what had been left behind in the New World. Copley's Nativity must have been finished just about Christmas of the year in which the Thirteen Colonies declared their independence. C. V. 1. J. D.

I have endeavored to realize and render intelligible in the picture the process and details of getting out the grain. If all the incidents are not at once obvious, I am sure repeated ob- servations will develop them. The system is in all probability but little varied from that which has prevailed in the Roman Campagna for many centuries and will long continue unchanged by modern im- provements or innovations - at least while the wages of labor are as low as they are and all the requisite force is at so ready and economical command of the farmer - who is still further favored by the advantages of the climate and comparative immunity of risk from uncertain weather during the season of harvest peculiar to the country. (From a letter, December 1867, from John Gadsby Chapman to Robert 0. Fuller of Cambridge, who com- missioned Harvesting on the Romani Campagna.)' Exciting in its theme of the "Italian Wild West," magnificent in its sweep of hallowed land- scape, perfect in its state of preservation, and flawless in its documentation, this painting is a heroic acquisition in the broadening "Victorian" aspirations of the Museum of Fine Arts.2 Mid- way between the Revolution and the Bicentennial, John Gadsby Chapman's panorama adds a note of visual excitement to the portraiture, historical documentation, petty poetry, genre, and pastorality of American painting from the Civil War to John Singer Sargent. Chapman was well known in his own time as a Virginia patriot, as an activist among Amer- icans in Italy, and, perhaps best, as painter of one of the great historical murals, the Baptism of 1.

The painting was exhibited by the Childs Gallery, Boston, in September 1972, and is illustrated in their brochure for this occasion. 132</page><page sequence="43">Pocahontas, in the Rotunda of the Capitol in Washington. His so-called Virginia period, brief years between his first visit to Italy and his prolonged residence in that country, produced fine portraits and a series of quasi-literary documentations of the landscapes in which George Washington lived and died (Washington's Old Tomb, Washington's New Tomb, etc.). As E. P. Richardson and others have remarked, Chapman did not reach the height of his talents until he turned again to the Italian countryside for inspiration. Sadly enough, it is difficult to judge his Virginia period to the fullest, since much of his best work at that time seems to have gone up in flames in the Civil War, probably in the burning of Richmond. Inferior engravings tell much of the story. This painting is one of four versions of the subject, three of which differ from each other considerably (in size, arrangement of figures, and terrain), and all but one (John Heinz collec- tion, New York) vary in some way from the composition acquired by the Museum of Fine Arts. Perhaps the first delivered version, this was certainly considered by the artist to be his master- piece in the series, the one receiving the most intellectual or literary as well as painterly atten- tion to detail. The precedent for repeated and slightly varied compositions among American artists of the Revolutionary through Civil War periods was a most honorable one; witness, in painting, John S. Copley's Watson and the Shark or, in marble, the busts of Eve, Faith, and America (Fogg Museum) by Hiram Powers. The fact that the Newark Museum has a notably different version of this painting and the Cleveland Museum of Art this precise composition on a vastly reduced scale only enhances the relevancy of this breath of the Italian plains, as seen by an American, to the museum's splendid collection of American painting. John Gadsby Chapman's Pines of the Villa Barberini (1856),3 his other painting in the museum, is more an outgrowth of the poetic little landscape phase practised to a high degree in the artist's Virginia years.

Zwei Minner, einander in h6herer Stellung vermutend, begegnen sich (Two men meet, each believing the other to be in a higher position). Inv. 6. (Kornfeld 7.) 1903; etching on zinc; 11.8 x 22.6 cm. (platemark). Lee M. Friedman Fund. 1972.404. In June 1903, Paul Klee, at the age of twenty-three, wrote in his journal "Toward the end of the month, I am going to prepare etchings; first through inventing suitable designs. Not that I now want to become a specialist. But I must recover from my failure in painting with smaller suc- cesses. Presently, I am a very tired painter, but otherwise a consistently strong draughtsman."' Two years later, after devoting himself almost exclusively to the task, Klee had produced fif- teen etchings that form a group quite distinct in technique, style, and subject matter from the rest of his work. The etchings were all executed in Bern with the aid of the printer Max Giradet. Klee exhibited ten of the fifteen at the 1906 Munich Secession with his title Inventions. Because these etchings were for Klee an experiment and a release from the rigors of paint- ing, his editions were small; the largest numbered fifty impressions. In recent years, these early etchings have rarely come up for sale, and until the Museum of Fine Arts acquired Zwei Man- ner, einander in h6herer Stellung vermutend, begegnen sich in June 1972, there were only two other etchings from this group known to be in Greater Boston public collections.2 The earliest Klee print owned by the museum had been a color lithograph of 1921-22. This particular impression of Zwei Manner, unknown to Klee's cataloguer, Kornfeld, is one of five trial proofs that constitute the first state. The second state consists of three trial proofs and an edition of thirty; for this final state, the plate edges were beveled and polished smooth in order to produce a clean platemark. In contrast, the rough plate edges of the first state hold the ink and leave an inky platemark. The first state is further distinguished by the printing of an etched inscription outside the image at the upper right. This is Klee's notation of the time required for the acid to bite the plate. From it one can surmise that the exposed lines were bitten by acid for twenty-five minutes, and the gradations from dark to light of the three back- ground tones for fifteen, five, and five minutes respectively. The tones were probably achieved by submerging in acid large exposed areas of the plate. Klee's journal entry for September 1903 reads "On the fourteenth of September, all was empty, cold and desolate, foul and accursed. Then I worked doggedly, much harder than the single result of the etching Zwei Minner ... would seem to indicate. In it I sought consolation for my social position. At first, out of im- patience, I etched the design for too short a time, then I went back to the composition and improved it considerably. I also had better luck with the biting than before."3 Zwei Manner bears in the lower left corner the etched initials "P. K." and "Bern Sept. 03" beneath a trefoil clover. (The German word Klee means "clover.") The print is typical of the early group of fifteen etchings in several respects. Klee himself described the group as being done in a 'strengen Stil"4 ("severe style"). Contour lines are firm, disciplined, and continu- ous; modeling is achieved only through short, restrained flicks of the etching needle. Klee's precise and dextrous manipulation of the etched line has created figures that are at the same 1. E. W. Kornfeld, Paul Klee: Das Graphische Werk (Bern: Kornfeld and Klipstein, 1963), no. 3.

He presents them removed from the natural world, almost as characters in a moralizing fable, as symbols or emblems of ideas. They stand out, isolated, like pantomimists on a bare stage or players performing in a tragicomedy. Klee's mordant, satirical wit is evident in Zwei Man- ner, where two men, though stripped of all signs of worldly and material accomplishment and placed in a barren landscape, still grovel, have pretensions, and try to flatter. The irony lies in the fact that, in their crouched symmetry, they lack all distinction and, like mimicking monkeys, mirror each other. In creating this print and the others like it, with their often sinister or bitter comments, Klee evidently managed to overcome his discouragement and presumably found consolation for his "social position." His journal entry for April 1905 reads "I almost believe it [the etching just completed, Head of Menace, Kornfeld 18] will be the last sheet in this severe style ... I ex- pressed myself honestly and truly with my etchings. I will never deny them, though at the bottom of my heart, I am already prepared for the new."' S. L. S. 5.

Charcoal heightened with white on tan paper; 45.5 cm. x 40 cm.; signed lower left: "E. John- son." Lucy Dalbiac Luard Fund. 1972.879. Adept at drawing as a youth in Maine, the earliest training Eastman Johnson had was as a draughtsman for a Boston firm of lithographers. In 1842 at the age of eighteen, he began drawing portraits in crayon or charcoal and by 1845 was earning his living by it. Like so many of his contemporaries he found the lack of art schools in this country limiting. His choice of a European art center was influenced by that arbiter of popular American taste the American Art-Union, which published an annual print for its thousands of subscribers. Encouraged by its secretary, whose advice he sought, Johnson went in 1849 to Dusseldorf where there was a school of painting specializing in meticulously rendered subjects of everyday life, history, and landscape. He was soon producing precisely contoured and subtly modeled drawings in char- coal, black chalk, and graphite. Several of these, including a portrait of the romantically hand- some artist Langhamer (dated 1849), are in the M. and M. Karolik Collection of the Boston Museum. Johnson spent two years in Dusseldorf, both at the Royal Academy under Carl Friedrich Lessing and working in the studio of the American-born Emanuel Leutze. In the summer of 1851 he visited the International Exposition in London and afterwards settled at The Hague, where he studied the color and free brushwork of Rembrandt and the Dutch masters. Here he remained until 1855, when, after a few months in Paris at Couture's studio, he returned to the United States. In this highly finished drawing, youth and innocence are poignantly combined with pov- erty and deformity. Such moralizing genre subjects were popular in mid-nineteenth-century America. Despite its sentimentality, the drawing has strengths that maintain our eye and ex- tend our interest. Its composite nature suggests that Johnson was trying his hand at something new. Several of his paintings known to have been done in Dusseldorf have disappeared, and not many remain from The Hague period; nor are his drawings of this time well published. At present it is not possible to date The Street Vendor more precisely than to The Hague period, 1851-1855. An oil sketch signed and dated "Hague 1851" of an Old Waterloo Soldier (St. Louis Art Museum) shows similarities in choice of subject, in the carefully differentiated tex- tures of flesh and hair, and in the liquid eyes. The Savoyard Boy, painted in 1853 (Brooklyn Museum), is also similar in subject but more restrained in its sentiment. The drawing relates to still another painting of the same year, The Card Players (private collection), in the handling of space and light as well as in the treatment of the main figure. The boy and the wooden fence are treated as sculpture with a hard, marblelike surface. Unlike the detailed and ex- plicit, almost trompe-l'oeil background of The Card Players, the drawing's background, drawn in a pale brownish charcoal, suggests rather than describes forms in a painterly fashion. Many white areas skillfully imply reflected light and cause some modeling within the figures to be obliterated. In his sensitive awareness of the power of light to expose or conceal, as well as in his choice of a street subject, Eastman Johnson shows that he has begun to benefit from his study of Rembrandt in Holland. The results of his observations are evident in the masterful lighting and beautiful color of his paintings of the 1860's and 1870's that depict haybarns, maple sugaring, cranberry picking, and other inherently American scenes.

A page from A la pintura, a poem by Rafael Alberti, 1945-1952, illustrated with original aqua- tints by Robert Motherwell, 1968-1972, printed by Donn Steward. Text set and printed by Juda Rosenberg. Published by Universal Limited Art Editions, 1972. 24 unbound pages, 64.75 cm. x 96.5 cm. boxed. Number 14 of an edition of 40. William A. Sargent Fund. 1972.952. In recent years members of the Department of Prints and Drawings have had the pleasure of visiting the workshop of Universal Limited Art Editions, West Islip, Long Island, as guests of its director, Tatyana Grosman. During those visits they were privileged to see a work in progress of unusual beauty, the painter Robert Motherwell's aquatint illustrations to the poem A la pintura ("To Painting") by the Spanish poet Rafael Alberti. This book of monumental format was begun in 1968, and when finally completed in 1972, it was immediately acquired for the museum's collection of fine illustrated books. The book consists of twenty-four loose sheets of thick, strongly textured paper, contained in a specially constructed wood and formica box with a sliding drawer and a clear plastic top for viewing. Twenty-one of these pages have one or more etched images by Motherwell. Their execution and printing were the result of a close and very creative collaboration between the artist and Universal Art Editions' master printer, Donn Steward. The majority of these prints, with their imagery of rectangles nesting within rectangles, of sensitively drawn lines on a field of subtly modulated color, relate very closely to the "Open" series of paintings, which Motherwell began in 1967. The museum has recently acquired one of these paintings, Open in Ochre (discussed by K. Moffett on p. 113 of this issue). Although the prints in A la pintura closely parallel the imagery of the "Open" series, they are not merely repetitions of painted works grafted onto a writer's text in order to create an artificial rarity for collectors; they are true illustrations to Alberti's poem. The title page informs us that A la pin- tura is a "poema del color y la linea" ("poem of color and line") illustrated with "aquatints of color and line." The imagery of the book consists of a rhythmically varied relationship of three elements: the blank white of the paper, the letterpress text in English and Spanish, and the aquatints. Much of the sensuous pleasure of looking at and handling the pages of the book derives from the way in which both type and aquatint plates have deeply embossed the thick paper. There are as many refinements in the typography as in the prints. The English translation by Ben Belitt is always printed in black, while the original Spanish text that follows is printed in color. In the sections "To the Palette" and "To the Paintbrush," which begin and end the poem, the Spanish text is printed in a sequence of varied colors, suggesting the spectrum of colors on the artist's palette. Within each of the sections named for a color ("Black," "Blue," "Red," "White"), which form the body of the poem, a single color is used for the Spanish text: e.g., in "Black" the Spanish text is always printed in brown, in "Blue" it is always printed in blue. The subtle, expressive relationship that exists between text and print may be seen if we examine the page with the fourth verse of "Blue," which is reproduced here. The translated verse reads The blue of the Greeks: columnar, asleep upon plinths like a god. The Spanish text that follows is printed in blue and echoes the blue of the U-shaped, rectan- 138 gular field of the print. The vibrant blue of the print is identical with the blue of the Gauloise</page><page sequence="49">4 The blue of the Greeks: columnar, asleep upon plinths like a god.

The center of the plate that prints the blue was not aquatinted, so that another plate, its spidery lines inked a wine purple, could be printed in this space. A light film of this red purple ink has been left on the unworked areas of the plate and prints on the bright white paper as a rectangle of rosy white. Seen in the context of the line of verse, this faintly pink rectangle suspended in a blue field has the power to suggest a column of warm-hued marble seen against sky and sea. The aquatints of A la pintura are characterized by an extraordinary luminosity of color. They seem to glow with light. This is in perfect accord with Robert Motherwell's statement that "it is light that counts above everything. Not colored light, but color that gives off light radiance!"' C. S. A. 1.

Peru, Spanish Colonial period, late 16th century or 17th century. Wool and cotton yarns, 7.15 m. x 4.24 m. Charles Potter Kling Fund. 1970.502. The long native tradition of excellence in weaving in Peru combined with European design motifs after the Spanish conquest to create tapestries of unusual and striking character. This carpet's design is a successful composite of motifs derived from Peruvian, Spanish, and Turkish sources. The border contains stylized scrolling vines upon which birds perch and among which rodentlike creatures stand. The latticework of the field is ultimately derived from Turkish (Ushak) carpets of the late sixteenth and the seventeenth centuries. Three wreaths common to Spanish (Alcaraz) carpets of the middle to late sixteenth century interrupt the lattice; they con- tain urns and a basket of fruit surrounded by birds and lions. This is the largest known Peruvian tapestry weaving of the Colonial period. Its great size and the thick yarns employed in the weaving suggest that it was intended to be used as a floor covering or possibly as the covering of a platform at one end of a room. Denman Waldo Ross, one of the museum's great benefactors, had the remarkable foresight and appreciation to collect Peruvian Colonial tapestries long before most other scholars even knew their place of origin. As a result of his many gifts in this area, made between 1897 and 1922, the museum owns at present one of the most extensive collections of Peruvian Colonial tapestries in the world. This carpet now becomes the crowning example in the collection, with its immense size, its brilliant colors, and its intriguing design, ready to overwhelm and delight any viewer's eye. L.

England, signed with the initials "M F," dated 1683. Wool yarns on cotton and linen twill, with tassel, h. (excluding tassel) 62 cm., w. 45 cm. Textile Income Purchase Fund. 1971.648. American ladies today often use plastic carryalls to store or transport a diversity of objects. For much the same purposes, many English ladies of the second half of the seventeenth century made crewel-embroidered work bags such as this one. In it the maker, who included in the embroidery her initials "M F" and the date of execution "1683," might have kept a book she was reading or possibly sewing and embroidery materials. The ground on which the embroidery is worked is a weft-twill cotton and linen fabric known as fustian. The pattern itself is worked with rich wools, once yellow-green but now faded to a dark green, in chain, Cretan, fishbone, buttonhole, stem, running, speckling, and various filling stitches to form fantastic giant leaves growing from thick stems. Such designs were very popular in the latter half of the seventeenth century in England and appear on many crewel-embroidered hangings, but only a few similarly patterned work bags are known today. Leaves such as these never adorned a living tree or shrub, so nature cannot be claimed as their inspiration. They may, however, be derived in part from one of two sources or from a combination of both. One is the "Oriental" botanical patterns created in Europe to be used in Indian painted cottons destined for the Western market. The second possible source is the verdure tapestries, featuring gigantic leaf forms, which were produced in great numbers in the sixteenth century in Flemish weaving centers such as Engihen and Grammont. The highlight of this bag's embroidery is the refreshing inventiveness with which the maker has filled the leaves with veins, riots of abstract geometric patterns, and even small stylized blossoms. No area was safe from the embroidery needle, and spaces between the leaves have been filled with slender coiling tendrils, executed in buttonhole and running stitches. At a slightly later date, the embroideress tended to work in polychrome wool yarns and to fill in the leaves completely with satin or long and short stitches. These crewelwork examples have a much heavier appearance. The museum is fortunate to have in its possession a set of four bed hangings worked in that manner, but this bag is the first important embroidery of the lighter monochromatic style to enter our collection.

The area of the major achievement of Classic Maya culture, as reflected in the density and size of "cities," the number and quality of buildings, and the excellence of sculptured monuments, was the Peten-Usamacinta rain forest of the Yucatan peninsula. There were also centers located outside this heartland where the minor arts such as jade-carving and pottery-making flourished. One such center is Chama, a small mound group on the Chixoy River in the northwest corner of the Guatemalan province of Alta Verapaz. Chama was the probable location of a highly original school of vase-painting, the products of which were traded downriver to the cities of the Peten-Usamacinta region. The Chama vase illustrated here is painted with the figures of two anthropomorphic bats, separated by columns of hieroglyphs. The bat motif appears also on a vase excavated by E. P. Dieseldorff at Chama in 1892,' now in the American Museum of Natural History, New York, and on Chama vessels in the University Museum, Philadelphia, and in the Palmer Collec- tion, Portland, Maine. Thus, the subject of the Boston vase is not unique; rather, this is a kind of "set piece" made for burial with the dead. Chama polychrome vases were made in a limited number of shapes, the most common of which is the footless cylinder jar. The potter's clay, highly refined, was a light buff color. After firing, the vessel rim and the outlines of the design were painted in black pigment. Subse- quently a yellow-ochre wash was added, and then some areas of the design were accented with splashes of red.2 The horizontal bands of alternating black and white chevrons that frame the painted scenes are the hallmark of the Chama painters. The two bats on the Boston vase have outstretched wings, painted with a sign whose con- notation is 'death.' They wear a collar with bell-shaped ornaments worn also by a skull-headed deity in the Dresden Codex known as the death god.3 A prominent nose leaf identifies the bat as a member of the tropical family of carnivorous bats Phyllostomatidae. Stylized bloodstreams issue from the mouth of the bat, indicative of the animal's bloodletting habit. Above the eye, like an eyelid, is painted the Maya glyph Akbal (night). The convention of using ornate scroll forms, as in the nose, ear, and claws of the bat, is a stylistic determinant of Maya art from the time of the Early Classic period. The glyphic text is repeated twice. The first of the three signs (reading from the top) is an "Initial Sign," which is found on more than half of all Maya painted pots. It is a compound glyph, consisting of a large primary element to the right and a smaller affix, which precedes the primary glyph and modifies its meaning. The connotation of the Initial Sign may be 'descent,' i.e., into the underworld.4 1. See Dieseldorff, "A Clay Vessel with a Picture of a Vampire-Headed Deity," Smithsonian Institution, Bureau of American Ethnology Bulletin no. 28 (Washington, D.C., 1904), 665-666. 2. The Research Laboratory of the Museum of Fine Arts analyzed the clay and found it to be a fine- textured clay, low in quartz, with traces of potassium, calcium, titanium, iron, rubidium, strontium, and zirconium. The black paint was found to be made from a manganese-iron oxide. The red and yellow colors were derived from iron oxides. 3. See J. Eric S.

However, it has been demonstrated for hieroglyphs carved on limestone monuments that a lock of hair on the forehead denotes a female personage.5 Since the black spots on the cheeks probably indicate decay or decomposi- tion of the flesh, this may be a death goddess. The third sign is Imix (earth or night), with Akbal (night or darkness) painted as an infix. The sign attached to the left of the Akbal glyph may be the "death-eyes" affix, a variant of the sign painted on the wings of the bats. Its meaning is probably 'expiration,' 'demise,' or 'end." If the precise translation of the glyphic text is not yet possible, the import of it is clear. It speaks of termination, death, darkness, the underworld. The meaning of the bat demon as a Maya symbol is fairly explicit. The notions of peniten- tial bloodletting and sacrificial death are expressed through the metaphor of the blood diet of the carnivorous bat. The bat demon as a symbol persisted into Aztec times, where it is known from the Codices Vaticanus B, Fejervary-Mayer, Borgia, and Porfirio Diaz. In Aztec drawings, the nose leaf of Phyllostomus is replaced by a flint knife, which it closely resembles in shape. The knife is a symbol of sacrificial death, for in the Aztec codices the bat demon is shown holding a decapitated human head or removing a human heart. The Maya bat demon of the Boston vase probably functioned in a context similar to the demons of the Aztec codices, as a symbol of death by sacrifice. This meaning is also suggested by the hieroglyphic text with its notions of descent, death, darkness. In 1904, when Dieseldorff published the first bat vase excavated at Chama, he wrote "The glyphs belonging to the picture on this vessel afford us no solution, since we do not under- stand them."' It is a tribute to scholars of the Maya hieroglyphs such as Proskouriakoff, Thomp- son, and Coe that the strange, expressive vigor of the painted design can now be considered also in the light of its accompanying hieroglyphic text.
