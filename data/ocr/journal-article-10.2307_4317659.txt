Nearly every literate American has been exposed by now to the fact that in the second and first centuries B.C. there lived at Qumran on the shores of the Dead Sea a highly organized Essenic Jewish sect which summed up in its monastic existence and apodictical writing a belief in the imminent end of the world and the necessity of a thoroughgoing spiritual preparation for that cataclysmic event. Readers of journals as otherwise diverse as Time Magazine and the New Republic have been kept fully abreast of the dramatic archeologi- cal and scholarly effort that has attended the location, recovery and translation of the documents secreted by the sect in inaccessible caves when the Roman army finally moved to destroy the religious basis of Jewish nationalism in 68 A.D. These documents, or Scrolls, are now available in an excellent English translation edited by Professor Theodore Gaster of Columbia University. They will be of particular interest to students of folklore and comparative religion since they portray the messianic and re- deemer myths of an isolated group caught up in an intense theological dualism symbolized and historicized in a gigantic struggle between a God of Good and a God of Evil for the control of the world and the spiritual allegiance of man. Because the Qumran documents bridge a two-century chronologi- cal gap between the latest of the Old Testament books and the earliest of St. Paul's Epistles, they are of immense historical and theological importance. The discovery, within a century of Christ's birth, of a tradition centering on belief in a Jewish Messiah (The Teacher of Righteousness) who transcended political and ritual goals has under- standably caused some consternation. For this reason it is not sur- prising that the "meaning" of the Dead Sea Scrolls has already become immersed in controversy as various religious and rationalist groups maneuver either to quiet the fears of the faithful or to discover in the Scrolls some verification or suggestion of their respective attitudes 163</page><page sequence="2">164 Midwest Folklore, VII:3 toward the origin and early development of historical Christianity. Thus the interpretive literature that began with Edmund Wilson's The Scrolls From the Dead Sea (New York, 1955) and Millar Bur- rows' The Dead Sea Scrolls (New York, 1955), has become a flood. Recently, John M. Allegro has viewed the documents from the natura- list viewpoint; Roland E. Murphy has countereed with a Roman Catholic evaluation; and A. Powell Davies has offered a Protestant- Unitarian version. Indeed, a form of competitive "Higher Criticism" has emerged that is becoming increasingly contentious. Much of this centers on a new assessment of the religious and theological currents abroad in the Palestine into which Jesus of Nazareth was born and the influence such movements as Qumran Essenism might have had on John the Baptist, Jesus and, later, St. Paul. Since the various sectarian interpretations that have appeared to date have vital creedal interests at stake, it is well that the reader proceed first to the docu- ments themselves. And on this journey the Gaster translation might profitably be compared with the Burrows translation at the most controversial points. The Qumran documents reveal that the sect was an economically communistic theocracy in which social status was determined by a dominant priest class on the basis of an individual's degree of right- eousness-an aristocracy of spirituality superimposed on a communism of materiality created and enforced by a body of rules and regula- tions derived from a rigid and sometimes arbitrary interpretation of the Mosaic Covenant and the Prophetic Codes. Their view of history denied the concept of linear progressive development common to Greek and Roman experience. Instead, they embraced the Indian and Persian view that history was a cyclical phenomenon, its motion imparted by constant conflict between God and Satan and their respective allies, the Sons of Light and the Sons of Darkness. Periodi- cally, when Belial, the Angel of Darkness, seemed on the verge of corrupting all mankind, God would intervene and in a cataclysm of fire and flood the old world of sin and flesh would be destroyed and a new world ushered in. The Qumranites believed that the Golden Age would be characterized by the gathering in of all the right-thinking and righteous Israelites (the "remnant" of mankind "saved" by God to launch the new cycle), and the emergence of both a Political Messiah and a Priest Messiah who would assist in spreading "the knowledge of the Lord" throughout the world reborn. The intense and deterministic dualism of the Qumran sect ex- hibits strong post-Exilic Persian influences not characteristic of ortho- dox Judaism in the century before Christ. Indeed, the Qumranites</page><page sequence="3">Robert Seager II 165 linked the bulk of the Jewish priesthood with Satan, and they singled out for special abuse a Preacher of Falsehood (Aristobulus II or Menelaus or both), who, contrasted with their own Teacher of Right- eousness, served to project the laiger cosmic dualism into contem- porary human history. Like Jesus, they argued that their mission was to purify and revitalize the ancient Covenant. They looked for- ward to the coming of the Kingdom of God, and they maintained that salvation and eternal life would come most readily to those who possessed an "inner vision" of or mystical identification with God. The mystical emphasis has a clear Iranian-Indian basis, as does the monastic withdrawal from society and the insistence on contem- plation as a road to truth. On the other hand, the bulk of the docu- mentary evidence places the sect firmly in the Jewish tradition-a reform Judaism with dualistic, messianic and mystical overtones, but one firmly anchored in Mosaic and post-Exilic propheticism. The view of man as "a mass of filth . . . prone unto wrong-doing," miserable in the sight of God, the concern with ritual cleanliness and legalistic behavior codes, a hymnology virtually plagiarized from the Psalms, the conception of the struggle between Good and Evil in secular military terms, a view of God ranging from the capricious and anthropomorphic to the omnipotent, omiscient, and omnipresent, and the egocentricity of "chosen people" nationalism and one-road salvationism, all serve to suggest this point. However, the true uniqueness of the Qumran documents lies in the fact that on two major points, the origin of evil and the nature and status of the Teacher of Righteousness, the sect worked out a theological eclecticism which looked both East and West-toward both the cosmological dualism of India and Persia and the Man-God or personified Logos concept of the Hellenistic world. In this sense, the theological nature of Jesus as expressed in the Epistles of Paul and the sharp dualism of the Fourth Gospel (long thought to be an early second century A.D. product of Gnostic influence) must be re- viewed anew in the light of the Scrolls. It is at this point that the controversy becomes heated. And it is at this same point that the folklorist concept of the culture hero becomes most suggestive. Surprisingly, the controversy to date has largely bypassed the problem of the origin of evil and has concentrated instead on the more immediate threat of the Teacher of Righteousness. But the Qumranites struggled heroically with theodicy, and compared with the somewhat inconclusive solution found in the Book of Job and the intellectually unsatisfactory answers summed up in the Christian doctrine of Original Sin, the ideas of the sect certainly warrant</page><page sequence="4">166 Midwest Folklore, VII:3 further study and analysis. Briefly, the Qumran community believed that God by some "inscrutable design" had created both Good and Evil. He also created man with the two distinct natures, of "equal measure," one tending toward righteousness revealing the dominion of the Pzince of Light, the other tending toward evil and revealing the dominion of the Angel of Darkness. God, it was believed, loved Good, and if man avaled himself of the pleasures of the Evil (which God himself had created) he would suffer "final annihilation in the Fire." Further, "when the time of Inquisition comes, He will deter- mine the fate of each living being in accordance with which of the two spirits he has chosen to follow." Thus while there was plenty of Free Will in the Qumran concept of salvation (a free will which the priest class of the sect sought to channel toward the "right" choice through the authoritarian imnposition of the Covenant purified) there was no idea of Original Sin and no searching concern with predestination. In the Zadokite Document it seems clear that Satan was employed by God as an instrument to destroy those who re- nounced the Covenant. It follows then that Satan had no independent, metaphysical existence but was a specific creation of the Deity for the purpose of testing, chastising, and seducing man. There is no suggestion that Satan was a fallen angel or that the Evil God (as the ancient Persian tradition had it) developed independently of the Good God. On the contrary, the Evil God was viewed as a mani- festation, a derivative of the Good God, much as in the Hindu concept. For this reason it was inevitable, by definition, that God could and would triumph over his own tool whenever the periodic and cataclysmic purging of mankind was necessary. But since the cosmic duality was essentially contrived and artificial, man could hope to escape the consequences of his wrongdoing. The Qumranites developed such an escape hatch for those who had exercised their freedom of will unwisely. According to the Za- dokite Document, chronic Covenant-breakers could, through confession and submission to God, achieve last-minute salvation, especially if they gave ear to "him who imparts the true interpretation of the law." Whether this figure should be called a "Teacher of Righteous- ness" as Professor Burrows translates the phrase, or "One Who Ex- pounds the Law Correctly" as Professor Gaster insists, or whether he was regarded as a true Messiah, it is difficult to read the Gaster translation and agree with the translator in his introduction that the "correct expositer" or "right teacher" was an office rather than a specific person, and that even if he were a person his nature and function in no way transcended that of any other Hebrew prophet.</page><page sequence="5">Robert Seager II 167 It seems clear that the sect looked forward to "the coming of the Prophet," a man separate and distinct from both the Political Messiah and the Priest Messiah, a person "wonderful in counsel, a hero divine," a teacher through whom God would work and whose function transcended both the political and the ecclesiastical. Accord- ing to the Habukkuk Commentary, this teacher would seem to surpass the status of other Hebrew prophets because it was believed that God had specifically endowed him with knowledge of "all the deeper implications of the words of His servants the prophets." Yet in the Commentary on Psalm 37 the impression is given that this teacher had already come and been persecuted by "the wicked priest" who had the Teacher "put to death" in order "to make an end of the Covenant and the Law." Thus whether the Teacher had come or was to come, he apparently summed up in his very being and existence both "the Covenant and the Law." One might argue, therefore, that this was no run-of-mine prophet, but a man who stood above the prophets and through whom life eternal might be achieved. To be sure, the concept of a Man-God in the later Christian sense is no- where suggested. But the overall Qumranite emphasis on status based on degrees and gradiations of righteousness made it entirely plausible for them to conceive of a redeemer and savior standing somewhere below God and above man. Neither wholly man nor God, nor Man-God, we have here a unique sort of culture hero. And since the references to the "wicked priest" and/or "the man of lies" seem to have positive historical identifications in mind, it is inconceivable that references to the "Teacher of Righteousness" would be to any- thing other than a historical personality. The projection of the cosmic dualism into human history logically demanded it, and the documentary references clearly suggest it. At the same time, Professor Allegro's argument that the Teacher was a "Christ-like" figure is only sound in the sense that folk religious literature abounds with Christ-like figures, messiahs, and redeemers. Allegro pushes the evidence too far in his attempt to unearth and historicize identical behavior motifs (such as crucifixion) for Christ and the Teacher. On the other hand, Father Murphy's unwillingness to see more than an "alleged parallel" between the Teacher of Right- eousness and Jesus and a possible similarity in the "form of expres- sion" in the literature treating the two, wholly begs the question. His assertion that the "specific Christian revelation-God's sending His only-begotten Son into the world to teach and to redeem mankind by His death-is simply not found in Qumran," not only belabors the obvious but seems to rule out the likelihood of much penetrating</page><page sequence="6">168 Midwest Folklore, VII:3 Roman Catholic speculation on the central issue of Qumran's influence on the emergence of later Christian redeemer concepts. A. Powell Davies, demonstrating a Unitarian unwillingness to accept the divinity of Christ, finds in the Qumran documents considerable evidence to support his contention that the Pauline deification of Jesus was a radical departure from the religious tradition which Jesus himself sought only to purify. Professor Gaster, writing from a Jewish view- point, spends little time worrying about the nature of Jesus and bends much of his effort to the task of converting the Teacher of Righteousness into a standard Hebrew prophet. It must, of course, be pointed out that there is nothing in the Qumran evidence to detract from the "uniqueness" of Jesus, so long as it is recognized that the quality of uniqueness rests primarily on St. Paul's Hellenized identification of Jesus as the literal, divine, historical Son of God, an identification which Jesus himself was either unwilling or unable to make. Certainly, the Qumranites made no such broad claim for their Teacher, and until Paul so characterized Jesus, it is probable that members of the sect worked closely with the Early Church of James in Jerusalem. To be sure, some of the specific teachings of Jesus differed significantly from those of Qumran. The sect, for instance, felt no missionary or redemption obligation toward mankind as a whole, and they urged their followers to hate and shun all sinners and Covenant-breakers. If Jesus is "unique" because he preached a doctrine of love to all men, then the Qumran Scrolls do not contest this designation. But if "uniqueness" is based on the conviction that Jesus is the only Man-God in history, then there is a considerable body of folk religious literature to contest the view- point. To this reviewer, it would seem that the Jesus of the Synoptic Gospels made on his own behalf no larger pretensions to divinity than the Qumranites made for their Teacher of Righteousness. Another interesting speculative point raised by the documents is that the sharp dualism of the Fourth Gospel might indicate Essene and Qumran influences rather than later Gnostic penetration and may even, in broad concept at least, pre-date the Synoptic Gospels. More important, and equally speculative at this point, is the extent to which Paul was influenced by the Qumranite view of the Teacher as he sought to delineate the theological nature and historical mean- ing of Christ. Murphy, Allegro and Davies all wrestle with these problems, Allegro and Davies realistically pointing out that the in- fluence of Qumran on the author of the Fourth Gospel and on Paul was pronounced. Indeed, it might be argued that Paul's conception of Jesus as the Son of God, separate and distinct from God, yet a</page><page sequence="7">Robert Seager II 169 God in his own right, seems somewhat closer to the Qumran Teacher who stood somewhere intermediary between God and the prophets than it does specifically to the philosophical abstraction that was the personified Logos of John. There will be much more controversy over the Dead Sea Scrolls. The whole question of the eclectic origin of Christianity has been raised anew and must again be forthrightly considered. It is to be hoped that the real questions raised by the Scrolls will not be swallow- ed up in a welter of denominational dogma and creedal inelasticity. Thus in welcoming further speculation, contention and study we should consider the joy of the unknown Qumranite hymnologist who gave thanks to God for his deliverance "from the congregation of them that seek smooth things" and pray that we too may be so de- livered.</page></plain_text>
