<plain_text><page sequence="1">Har Karkom Emmanuel Anati (Hebrew section: p. 129) During April 1998 the archaeological expedition of the Centra Camuno di Studi Preistorici returned to Har Karkom (see ESI 19) under the direction of E. Anati. Participants in the research teams were: A. Anati-Fradkin, C. Barbiero, F. Barbiero, R. Bastoni-Brioshi, A. Bergamini, S. Castelletti, K. Delevaux, G. Fornoni, S. Fornoni, G. Girolomoni, G.B. Girolomoni, M. Girolomoni, G.W. King, P. Longoni, I. Mailland, V. Manfredi, S. M'cormick, C. Oliveri, S. Robinson, T. Romani, W. Setz, R.D. Smith, M.E. Storm, O. Bouny, A. Gadnaor, E. Halevy, C. Duteil and R. Sion (administrator). Rock Art. Four rock art sites (HK31/32, HK56, HK110) which together produced over 1000 rock engravings, were studied. Statistical analysis re vealed that each site has its own thematic auton omy and a specific concentration of engravings in well-defined periods. Stone-built structures, such as circles, tumuli and platforms, seem to point to the social function of each site. The common symbol that appeared everywhere is the image of the ibex with rounded horns, in scenes of ritual character accompanied by images of worshipers or by footprints. This widespread phenomenon at Har Karkom seems to indicate that the makers of rock art had a very particular attitude toward this animal from the Neolithic period to the late Iron Age (II-IVc). During the Early Bronze Age (IVa) the ibex seems to be a totemic animal. The ibex apparently represents the symbol of the ancient Semitic Lunar god Sin, which was venerated on the Mountain. Caves. Several caves and shelters in the sector south and west of Har Karkom were examined. Soundings were carried out and sporadic relics of human presence, primarily of the Upper Paleo lithic and the Islamic periods, were noted. A cave 94*</page><page sequence="2">located above Site HK92 yielded flint tools belong ing to the Early Bronze Age. Thus far, over 30 caves and rock shelters have been surveyed, but several more still remain to be surveyed. Probes. At Site HK203bis an oval-shaped tumulus (3 x 5 m, height 1.5 m) was excavated. It is situated on the upper edge of the eastern side of Har Karkom, overlooking the Paran Desert. The tumu lus was built in two levels: an upper level made of heaped boulders and an inner level composed of large stones and beaten earth, which had been purposely compacted. At the very center of the structure a large, black stone was located on bedrock; on its top, early man had intentionally carved a white, calcareous, tabular stone (height c. 0.6 m) into a crescent shape. Near this stone, in the center of the tumulus, an Early Bronze Age flint knife was found, and near the black stone were remains of a fire. The analysis of the findings suggests the follow ing reconstruction: a site on the most prominent point of the eastern edge of the mountain was selected to hold a black, altar stone. On this altar, the crescent-shape white stone was placed along with a flint tool, which may have been used to carve it. At the foot of the altar stone a fire was lit. Then the site was covered by a heap of stones. This mountain may be a gal'ed erected for the com memoration and testimony of agreements or the dedication of the mountain. It is possible that the crescent-like white stone surrounded by black stones was dedicated to the lunar god, Sin. Such a hypothesis is particularly meaningful in light of the hypothesis of R. Bastoni, that the name of Sinai is etymologically connected with the name of the god, Sin. HK301, about 8 km south of HK203bis, is the only prominent peak overlooking and completely surrounded by the Paran Desert. It has already been suggested that it may be identified with Mount Paran mentioned in the Bible. On the top of the peak there are four rounded platforms (diam. 8-10 m, height at least 1 m), built with large stones and paved with tabular stones on which were remains of fire. A sounding in one of the platforms that went down to bedrock found only a fill of stones; its function could only have been con nected with its pavement. Two contrasting hy potheses posit their purpose: (1) they were bases for bonfires that could be seen from the desert all around; (2) they were altars. The 'Acropolis' (HK221bis). The exploration of the Mountain, which is a natural, dominant eminence, about 3 km from Har Karkom, continued. A stone wall made of large, calcareous blocks defines the northern edge of the 'Acropolis'. The top is a gently sloping plateau (15-20 x 170 m) surrounded by sharp edges. On the plateau, about 15 m west of the stone-built wall, there is an altar-like rectangu lar stone facing four standing orthostats, one of which has a vaguely anthropomorphic shape. At the western end of the acropolis is a small rectan gular Hellenistic temple, which has been exca vated. Around the acropolis, at the foot of the vertical walls, c. 4-7 m below the plateau, are several small caves and shelters. At the foot of the acropolis, at its northern end, about 4 m below the plateau, there is a natural crevice that was exca vated. It led to two, small man-made cisterns (c. 1 cu m each). From one of the cisterns Early Bronze Age pottery fragments were collected. Near the cistern is an orthostat with a naturally anthropo morphic shape. It is 2.1 m high, 0.6 m of which stands below the surface. General Survey. About forty sites, ten of which are new, were surveyed. Among the new sites two contain large concentrations of rock art, three in elude Paleolithic flint, eight have findings of the Bronze Age Complex, and two have Roman-Byz antine remains. One is a plaza site composed of six circles of stones (diam. c. 30 m). Two of the newly found Bronze Age sites include groups of orthostats and stone circles likely to have had ritualistic roles. With this survey, the systematic exploration of 100 sq km of desert has been almost concluded. The edges of the precipices, around the mountain, could not be reached; a professional team of rock climbers will investigate them in the future. 95Â»</page></plain_text>
