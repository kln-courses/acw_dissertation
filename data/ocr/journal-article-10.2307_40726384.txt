Teil 2: Die Lokalkulturen des Südens und Ostens. Monumenta Serica Monograph III. The Catholic University, Peking 1942. XIV, 558 pp. l Ever since the sensational lecture which Eberhard delivered in 1936 before the "Gesellschaft für Völkerkunde" at Leipzig1, in which he proposed to look at the civilization of the Chinese as agglomerated from the contributions of different ethnical groups, the scientific world has been eagerly waiting for more substantiated evidence of this interesting theory. In an amazingly short time Eberhard has now assembled three volumes of documentary material, of which the present is the last. The first volume, entitled Kultur und Siedlung, der Randvölker Chinas2, analyses the early Chinese accounts of the so-called barbarians, which are grouped into several distinct civiliza- tions. From these sources Eberhard has gathered the fact, that in early times (about the 7th century B. C.) not only the border districts but the whole of China with only few exceptions, was inhabited by these "barbarian" groups. This volume concludes with the hypothesis, that there did not exist anything like a "Chinese" civilization, but China as a cultural unit has been integrated by a slow process of the civilizing influences of these groups. In the second part, comprising volumes two and three3 of his researches, Eberhard has tried to trace the cultural character of these different groups from their evidences as far as they still can be traced in later Chinese civilization. According to his theory the heterogeneous character of the latter may in most instances still be split up and attributed to the different contributory civilizations. The results of this procedure are twofold. In the first place, the rather arid notes on the early "barbarians" are supple- mented and these groups have gained shape and life in his discourse, and secondly, the process of their stratification and mutual interaction, which led to the formation of Chinese civilization as a unit, has been more closely studied. 1) Wolfram Eberhard, Eine neue Arbeitshypothese über den Aufbau der früh- chinesischen Kulturen.

The primarily preponderant Turkish aspects of this originally coherent group are believed tó have gradually differentiated jn its eastern regions into what is called the proto-Mongol civilization. Next comes a Tibetan group, and the interaction between these two engendered a series of mixed civilizations in which also Turkestan influences made themselves felt. In the south there were the Tai ^, the Yao |R, and the Liao 2$, with the secondary civilizations of the Pa G in the West, and the Yuen M in the East. Lastly there was a proto-Tung- use civilization in the North-East. All these groups, Eberhard claims, can be traced back to the 3rd millenium B. C. with the exception of the mongrels, some of which have arisen only in historical times. The tradition of other ethnical elements which Eberhard suspects to have existed and which are documented by prehistoric excavations are too indistinct to furnish any evidence of their characteristics or of their relations to these local civilizations. These groups are supposed to have existed in a comparatively independent condition until the end of the second millenium when the first intermingling must have taken place which gradually led to the rise of the proto-Chinese and Chinese civilization. The first of these processes must have taken place in Southern Shansi and Honan, where Tunguse, Tai and Tibetan elements gained contact with each other and formed the Yang-shao -ftp Wa civilization, the aspects of which vary in accordance to the prepon- derance of one or the other of these different contributory influences. And later on, the Northern group was superimposed upon this stratum which led to the formation of the Hsia civilization. At the same time, a cross-breeding between the Northern and the Tunguse groups developed two proto-Mongol civilizations* In Eastern Szechuan another mixture took place between the Tibetans and the Yao and certain elements of the Tai; and the Pa civilization was the result, which in the middle of the first millenium underwent an evolution of special importance, pre- sumably by the adopting of the use of metal. In the same region other groups originated, of which the Fan Ü , which later on developed into the Miao t§" , were the most important. The fourth of these civilizing interactions must have taken place at a rather early date in Eastern China, through which the Lung-shan fl '1' civilization was formed. Tai and Tunguse elements are the strongest in this unit, but also influences from the North and from the Yao must be reckoned with. In the South-East the civilization of the Yüeh arose from a collision between the Yao and the Tai and it must have been in close contact with the Lung-shan. Finally the Shang realm rose as the historical sequence of these creative interactions representing a development of the Lung-shan civilization and it gained in vigour by drawing on the inheritance of the Hsia. At this time the influences of the Northern group and its two sub-groups were especially strong. Concurrently the Yüeh were advancing northwards along the coast, and intermingling with the Tung- use and the proto-Mongols, thus giving birth to the Corean civilization.</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 211 As a counterpart to the Shang realm, the evolution of the Chou civilization took place in the West, which kept much of its original nomadic character and upon which the Northern influences must have been especially powerful. Then it met with the Pa group and drew from this encounter additional features of great significance. But its features were mainly shaped by an exchange with the Shang themselves, from which the Chou inherited most of their civilization before going to their destruction. Thus the real Chinese civilization was formed, the later history of which is that of the «volution and the gradual absorption of the elements of other cultural groups. But these basic civilizations and their early intermixtures continued in part to lead an independent life. For isolated groups of these people maintained their cultural inheritance more or less free from outward influences, sometimes as an ethnical unit, sometimes as a delimited class or profession within the general civiliza- tion. And it is from the traditions of these groups and from their traces in earlier or later Chinese literature, that Eberhard tries to assemble the material out of which he shapes the picture of their original appearance. 3 The civilizations dealt with in this volume are the Yao, the Tai, the Yüeh, the Liao and the Tunguse. The earliest center of the Yao4, according to Eberhard, was Western Hunan and Western Hupeh from which they spread over Kueichou, Kuangsi, Kuangtung, Fukien, Chekiang and Kiangsi, and for a time even over Honan and Annuii The Yao are characterized as mountain-dwelling people, whose main feature was the cultivation of tuberiferous plants by way of a "Brandi eld-Trockenwirtschaft" with the help of a digging stick (Grabstock) which later developed into a primitive 4) The reasons, why Eberhard chooses the name Yao for the group, are not included in this volume. As far as I could make out, the use of the word yao to de- signate an ethnical group is comparatively late. It is met with, probably for the first time, in the Ti-li-chih % 3S sjg of the Sui-shu Ft #(ed. T'u-shu-chi-ch'eng ^ ^ % j£ 31, 11 r), where it is told that a group of aborigines living around Ch'angsha ë #&gt; was called Mo-yao M {§ , and where this name is explained as meaning "exempted from the corvée".

With the same explanation the term is used in one of Tu Fu's poems (Concordance to the Poems of Tu Fu, II, p. 229, 12. 4), where it is written Ä fó • In the Sung Dynasty the term Man-yao g£ fâ occurs (cf. D'Hervey de St. Denys, Ethno- graphies des Peuples Etrangers de Ma Touan-lin, II, pp. 31 sq.) and is explained as the group of Man, which submitted to the corvée, an explanation, which is also accepted by Johnson Ling in his Recherches Ethnographiques sur la Race Yao dans l'Asie du Sud Est, Paris 1929, pp. 2 sqq. Whether this etymology is correct or not I do not dare to decide. But so much is clear: the term yao is not old. In the begin- ning it was not used alone but in combinations only, and it was originally written fg or fâ and not %&amp;. 5) Apart from this diffused area Eberhard takes the documentation for this group even from places like Annam, Yunnan, Hainan, Szechuan, and Shensi.</page><page sequence="4">212 BOOK REVIEWS plough. Their social organization is described as rather loose, the social cell being the patriarchal clan, in which the position of women was rather strong. They had initation rites and a sort of family shamanism. They worshipped their ancestors but knew no priesthood. They were famous for their fecundity festivals, and promiscuity practised at such opportunities arose into a legal form of matrimony only after a child was born. Typical of their spiritual bearing was their dog-worship and their dog-taboo. The family lived in a quadrangular house, lightly built around the fire- place; and their dead were not interred but abandoned at the top of hills6. By an intermingling of the Yao with the other two basic civilizations of the South, the Tai and the Liao, a number of secondary ethnical groups originated such as the Ch'i-lao fê $g , the Li g£ , the Tan §f 7, and the Pai-man "g" 8£ . More important than these peoples were the Pa in the West, who took to proto-Tibetan influences and in their turn made themselves strongly felt in the Northern and North-eastern regions* while at the same time they engendered the Miao. Also the Yüeh, in the East, evolved out of a rather difficult process; and lastly, an important role played by the Yao was in the formation of the Shang-civilization, which arose in a center where the Yao gained contacts with Northern elements. The direct and indirect contributions to the constructive features of Chinese civilization are describe^ as manifold. Especially in the earlier strata, customs and institutions taken over from the Yao were numerous. But since Chou-times the influence seems to have weakened, counteracted as it was by other cultural groups and many contributions originating from them were later on lost entirely or kept on a prolonged life only in the conceptions of popular Taoism. The first and most important contribution of the Yao was the plough, which was developed from the digging stick and the spade, and which superseded the double- pronged digging implement, used by Shen-nung if §k, of which reminiscences were still alive during Han-times (e. g. spade-coins!)8. The second contribution was probably hemp, which first was used by the Yao for their bow-strings, supplanting bamboo-fibre, later on it was also spun and used as dressing materials. As another contribution, 6) Mentioned also in the Ti-li-chih of the Sui-shu; cf. Note 4. 7) In the above-mentioned Sui-shu passage, the Yao are called a sub-group of the the Tan! The Ch'i-lao and the Li are considered Tai by Rheinwald, Die nichtchinesischen Stämme Südchinas, Tokyo 1942, p. 30. Stübel, Die li Stämme der Insel Hainan, pp. 290-297, who attacks this question with great caution, finds a fundamental difference between Yao and Li, but a great similarity between Li and Tai. 8) pp. 74 sqq., 224 sqq. 9) p. 25. Eberhard could have mentioned that fibres of a sort of hemp have been identified among the Anyang materials, (Creel, Birth of China, p. 87), and that the Yü-kung S ^ mentions hemp as a product of Yü-chou m ffl and Ch'ing-chou # W (Bretschneider, Botanicon Sinicum, II, 205). The documentation he produces for this important plant is scanty and late. The cultivation of hemp was much older and was</page><page sequence="5">BOOK REVIEWS 213 Eberhard suggests that the old Chinese ritual and cooking vessels may have been derived from the bamboo sections in which the Yao did their cooking10. And probably the Chinese also took over from the Yao the cultivation of the sweet potato11. Apart from these material contributions, the Yao influence on Chinese myths and customs has been also considerable, especially in a series of festivals for which Eberhard traces a Yao background. As the Yao worshipped the moon and the moon-goddess, the mid-harvest full-moon was a most important date for them, probably their New- Year's day, which they celebrated with gaiety on the top of hills. The character of this festival greatly changed in the course of history, but still it is a full-moon festival12. «ertainly exercised already in a prehistoric age (cf. Lauf er, Sino-Iranica, p. 293). - It is not impossible, that the fairy Ma-ku J$t ft&amp; (E. p. 108 sqq) whom Werner has re- cognized as a composite deity (Diet, of Chin. Myth., p. 299 sq.) was in one of her forms originally the tutelary goddess of hemp. 10) pp. 82 sqq. His suggestion is not very convincing, as most types of old Chinese vessels can clearly be deduced from earthenware prototypes, which certainly did not originate in the South. 11) which Eberhard curiously calls a foodstuff for paupers (pp. 78 sqq.). Apart from the yü ^, he mentions also the kan-shu Ö* fjf , a word which he translates as mountain-sugar-cane. But sugar-cane certainly does not produce tubers as he ex- plains, and kan-shu is nothing else but a name of a species of batatas, the term yü !&gt;eing especially in use for the taro (Colocasia antiquorum) and kan-shu for the real batata (Ipomoea batata). Whether the Taro really could have been grown by moun- taineers is rather questionable, as this plant requires abundant moisture to do well, (cf. Rolfs, Subtropical vegetable gardening, N. Y. 1921, p. 279). Albert Kolb opines that the cultivation of Taro in irrigated fields was the original form and that the cultivation in dry fields was a later development. From his deductions it becomes likely, that Taro was first cultivated by the Polynesians, who knew it before they knew rice, and from them spread to other regions of Eastern and Southeastern Asia; cf. Forschungen und Fortschritte, 1940, p. 290. 12) pp. 22 sq. 103, 375 sq. According to Eberhard, the Chinese calendar is a new- moon calendar, in which, properly speaking, there is no room for a full-moon festival, and he calls the mid-autumn festival the only moon-festival of the Chinese. On the other hand he mentions himself the festivals on the 15th of the 7th month (p. 190) and on the 15th of the 1st month (p. 243) as old moon-festivals. - For the Yao this autumn festival was at the same time the birthday of their mythical forefather P'an-hu. But it is far from certain, that this festival was really a moon-festival. Eberhard himself mentions that it was also celebrated on the 25th of the 7th month. Stübel (The Yao of the Province of Kuangtung, M.S., Ill, p. 373) says it takes place in some regions in September or October, and its time is not definite in other regions. Johnson Ling (I.e. p. 31) quotes from the Kuei-hai yii-heng-chih ££ S SI ®x î&amp; the passage in which their festival on the 1st of the 10th month is described in terms which resemble very much the description of Eberhard. All this seems to indicate, that the</page><page sequence="6">214 BOOK REVIEWS The other great festival of the Yao, their Spring festival, was celebrated on the 3rd of the 3rd moon13. This festival was celebrated in the open, near flowing water, and was related to the souls of drowned women. But still it was not a mournful but rather a serene affair. It was an occasion for dancing and singing, boys and girls taking part and infringing upon the severe bonds of custom. Eberhard sees in this festival a continuation of the old dances of Cheng iß , of which Confucius spoke with so much disdain14. The souls of these drowned women have become river goddesses, protector- autumn-festival of the Yao was not necessarily a moon-festival. The influence of this. Yao festival on the Chinese mid-autumn festival does not seem to have been very strong, except perhaps for certain regions of Chekiang and Kiangsu. The character of the Chinese mid-autumn festival is totally different, for it is an indoor celebration, limited to women ( £ yf f$ M , ic ^ £t tt ). The Chinese festival of the double 9th suggests, itself much more strongly for this comparison; cf. E. p. 375 sqq. 13) Eberhard could have mentioned that this day is also the birthday of Hsi~ wang-mu 29 3: $?, (whom E. considers as belonging to the Pa civilization, p. 68), who is in possession of the peach of immortality, so that this day becomes a rejuvenation day (cf. Bredon and Mitrophanow, Das Mondjahr, pp. 245 sqq., Rousselle in Nachrichten der O. A. G., 50, pp. 14 sqq.). - The implications of this day are manifold, by the way. In the Peking region it is the proper day to shoot at a wooden hare from horse-back, (cf. Jih-hsia chiu-wen k'ao 0 ~F Ü H ¿g , 148, 12 v; Adam, Us et coutumes, p. 39). This is obviously a northern custom, whether or not the moon-hare is meant, I do not dare to decide. A collection of all the traditions about this day may be found in I-wen lei-chü ÍX^Í,4,8r-26r. 14) So does Hodous, Folkways in China, pp. 100 sqq. Hodous goes still further, and suggests, that it might be a continuation of the old spring-bathing rites, for which. he quotes a passage from the Chou-li (Biot, II, p. 104) and from the Lun-yii (Legge, p. 248). Granet gathered evidence for these bathing festivals not only from Cheng and from Lu # but also from the center of the Shang-civilization, that is to say from regions which probably did not belong to the sphere of the Yao (Fêtes et Chansons, pp. 155 sqq, 174). Apparently the Yao-f estival was gradually enriched by characteristics of other spring festivals. A detail of this sort seems to be the custom of the floating of wine-cups in curved rivulets, which is also documented for non- Yao districts (cf. Chang Chiang-ts'ai's âS it H Pei-p'ing sui-shih chih At ¥• Sc &amp;£ f&amp; , 3, 3 r) and not only for this day. Besides it is hard to imagine how wine-cups could have been floated on mountain-brooks (Eberhard p. 8 sq.). On the other hand, the Yao-customs of this day apparently have influenced other festivals, such as the Ch'ing-ming it K&gt;of which. Chou Tso-jen m fË A tells us, that at least in Eastern Chekiang, it is celebrated in a rather serene way with boating and looking for beautiful women (Chih-t'ang wen-chi fcH &amp; 3t JB, PP- 145 sqq. German translation in Dschunke 25, 38 sqq.). Also the use of the shepherd's-purse (on which compare Hodous, 1. c; Ch'iin-shu cha-chi g$ Hf ft IE. by Chu I-tung ^ ^ *$ , 9, 21 v; Kuang Ch'iin-fang-p'u M # ^ M , 15, 11 v sqq), which, originally belonged to the Yao-festival, has been taken over for Ch'ing-ming.</page><page sequence="7">BOOK REVIEWS 215 deities to this day, the most famous being Hsiang-chün M3Ê15&gt; ■ These river goddesses are in part identical with the goddesses of the moon, especially Ch'ang-o M Ì$ and Ch'ang-i ^ ü , who are dealt with in a special chapter in the book under review^. But Eberhard supposes that originally the spirit of the moon must have been male, not female, and that only later the moon-gods of the Yao were transformed into goddesses to match the male sun17. Reminiscences of this moon-god of the Yao are found by Eberhard in Sung Wu-chi $£ M &amp; , who was originally the God of the Flame, and in Wu Kang ^ W] , the man in the moon, who has to cut down the ever growing Cassia- treeis. 15) For a thorough discussion of this myth and the myths of other river-goddesses compare Ku Yen-wu ü &lt;£ ^ , Jih-chih lu H jgj f&amp; (Wan-yu wen-k'u ed. H ' ^ 3C Ü, Vol. 8, 77 sqq.), who proves beyond doubt, that the traditions about Hsiang-chün and the two daughters of Yao ^ belong to two different groups and were melted together only comparatively late. (In this connection he quotes a passage from the Po-wu-chih t# % iS &gt; in which a story of a goddess of T'aishan ^ 'l' is told, who is a daughter of the Eastern Sea, and whose day was also the 3rd of the 3rd moon). Chu I-tung in his Ch'iin-shu cha-chi, 11, 7 v sqq. also gives an analysis of the Hsiang $fl goddesses and their relations to the daughters of Yao M . 16) pp. 68 sqq. But the equation O-huang jg| i§ = ^ jg is not entirely conclusive. Chu I-tung (1. c. pp. 9 r sq) proves that it is based on a confusion of Ti Chün %? $£ (whose identity with Kao-hsin M ^ and K'u # , to which Eberhard still puts a question- mark, is established by Chu) and Shun ^ and not an original conception. 17) To support this theory E. could have mentioned the stories of the Yüeh-lao M 3Ë; , who is considered the match-maker, and thereby shows a certain kinship in function to Eberhard's river-goddesses, cf. Hodous I.e., p. 184; Bredon-Mitrophanow, p. 423. 18) According to the Yu-yang tsa-tsu © m Ü m (Chi-ku-ko ed. Wl t¡ HB,l,10r) this man is a native of Hsi-ho fâ p¡ , which would not be a region of especially strong Yao-traditions. As the conception of the Cassia-tree in the moon is presumably due to Buddhist influence, the man who cuts it down might have come from the same source. Eberhard holds against this a passage from Huai-nan-tzu fi ffi =£ , quoted in T'ai-p'ing yii-lan ± ^ $? ^957, 5a (which I could not locate in Huai-nan-tzu proper), who already knew the Cassia-tree in the moon. But I do not think, that proves much. Not only the Yu-yang tsa-tsu points out the Buddhist origin of this conception, but also Chu I-tung (Ch'im-shu cha-chi, 10, 18 r); cf. Hodous, Folkways in China, p. 188.- Stories about the seeds dropped by this tree are frequent, cf. Kuang Ch'iin-fang p'u, Kuo-p'u ^=f , 19 passim; Koehn, Fragrance from a Chinese Garden, p. 40; Hodous p. 189. But usually from these seeds only the earthly Cassia-trees spring, and the belief that they make women pregnant is rare and apparently late. So the relations between this tree and the moon-dances of the Yao-people do not appear to be close.</page><page sequence="8">216 BOOK REVIEWS But the conception most peculiar to the Yao people was their dog-ancestry story19. A dog taboo can be established for nearly all the people belonging tothe Yao group, where clothing and hairdresses resembling a dog's tail or a dog's head are met with20. The dog ancestor originally bore the name P'an-hu ^ U5 , but later, on account of resemblance of sound, this name became mixed up with P'an-ku £Ü ~¿" 21. But not only the Yao22 but also the Miao «f 23 and several other tribes, including the Chuang Sl 24, the Lao $f , the Ling Ï&amp; , and the Tung M 25, considered him their forefather. Three different centers of the P'an-hu myth are distinguishable, one in central Shansi and to the west of that place, one in Chekiang and one in the South-West. Whereas the latter two might be the outcome of Yao influence, it is difficult to include the first center also in the Yao sphere. It is likely that these places were originally independent centers of clans with a dog totem, on which only later the P'an-hu myth was uniformly superimposed26. The oldest tradition of this myth seems to have originated in the 19) For further literature on this question compare especially: C. H.

Leuschner, Die Yautze in Südchina (Mitteilungen der OAG, XIII, 241) tells a variant of the dog-ancestor story from the Yao of Kuangtung province, according to which an unnamed King's daughter falls ill and is promised to the one who cures her. A big dog succeeds in doing so and is married to the princess. They move into the mountain together, where the princess gives birth to a son. Thereupon the dog-father dies. After the son has grown up, he separates from, his mother. But the mother puts on a disguise and meets her son again. The son does not recognize her and marries her. And from this couple all the Yao sprang. - This is perhaps the original Yao variant of the story with which the P'an-hu myth was later on intermingled. It is interesting to note, that a very similar story is told by the Moken on the Burmese coast; cf.

Now, as other dog-stories quoted by Eberhard, such as that of King Yen HH of Hsü f£. who was saved by a dog29 and the curious story of Madame Hsieh |^ who was begotten by child with a white dog30, are by no means confined to Yao districts, the delimination of these different centers of the dog myths should not be difficult31. Besides the Ch'üan-jung, the Kuei-fang .&amp; Jj people also played a part in the history of the Yao32. Wang Kuo-wei 3E M USI has tried to prove, that the Kuei-fang and the Ch'üan-jung are identical33. Eberhard on the other hand opines, that they belonged to the Pa E group and lived in the Ch'u $g region34. The Kuei-fang occur 27) I take the version of the Sou-shen chi for the original one, as it explains the origin of the word "dog" in the name of the Ch'üan-jung ?ï j% . It is still an open question, whether the Ch'üan-jung should be considered a tribe with a dog totem, or whether this name is nothing but another transcription for the Hsiung-nu $j| $. (Wang Kuo-wei's j£ HI $8 hypothesis; cf. for this question: de Groot, Hunnen, 7 and 21; Religious System, IV, 269), whose custom of levirate must have been considered "dog- like" by the civilized Chinese. In this case the whole P'an-hu myth would burn down to a simple fairy-tale.

According to this evidence, they must have been people living in caves to the East of the T'ai-hang &gt;&amp;c ff mountain. The dog was not the only animal tabooed by the Yao-people. A certain group amongst them also had a monkey taboo and monkey-ancestor stories are current from Szechuan to Fukien37. Eberhard presumes, that this taboo, which was often connected with the clan-name Yang f$ , points to Tibetan influence, and that also the other con- ceptions of monkey-like creatures came from that source. Amongst these are the Mu-k'o :fc &amp; 38 and especially the Shan-hsiao [lj jg , which word today stands for the mandrill. These goblins, shaped like monkeys but frequently described with only one leg, are known throughout western and southern China39. They are supposed to live in mountains or on trees, and indulge in catching crabs and hoaxing people. They posssess a magic hood which makes them invisible. Fire-crackers are used to drive them away. Similar goblins are known in southeastern China under the name Wu-t'ung 2E si . Their stomach is described as drumlike. This feature as well as the one- leggedness bear resemblance to the famous monster K'uei H, who occurs frequently in the old literature40 and who later on developed into the inventor of music. Apparently this monster is a fusion of different conceptions, of which the one-leggedness became the common feature. The Shuo-wen |£ £ describes him as a dragon41, the Shan-hai- ching 'U M M mentions an ox-like K'uei42, and in the Kuo-yü i S we find a K'uei 35) mm m n, 1, 2 (1931). 36) &amp; -JS « Ä h m K in Ch'iin-ya # ffi, 1, 3 pp. 5 sqq. 37) Besides those mentioned by E. p. 27 sq. cf. the famous T'ang-novel Pai-yiian chuan â S&amp; ff, cf.

The first two seem to have no special affinities to Yao-regions44 and only the monkey-shaped K'uei is possibly a Southern contribution45. The one-leggedness of the Shan-hsiao and the K'uei reminds Eberhard of the dance of Yü M , which has been frequently described in foreign literature. The chief characteristic çf this dance is that it is supposed to have been performed on one leg46. Yü is one of the most complex figures of Chinese mythology. Besides some definitely western features47 he has a very old center of devotion on Mount Kuei-chi Hf f§ 48, whereas his transformation into a bear was regarded as introduced from the North49. As the dance of Yü was connected with this transformation, its southern implications are not self-evident, and its practice in the South does not necessarily have any too close connections with the Yü of the Deluge. We know from Shih-tzu P ■? , that Yü had a foot-disease, probably a one-sided paralysis, which made it impossible for one of his legs to be placed before the other. His way of walking was imitated by the shamans and called the step of Yü50 but this must have taken place comparatively late, after 43) Lu-yii # fg , 7v. The Shuo-wen s. v. ¡g also knows a monkey-like monster, called Mu-hou ftffît ( = fòffli or il ). 44) I could not find any proof for E 's statement that the monkey-K'uei was located in South-Western Hupeh and Eastern Szechuan. 45) It is not impossible that the monkey-K'uei is an adaption of the money Ch'üeh Vt . The shape of the character as well as the pronunciation point to that solution. The monkey-K'uei is not necessarily one-legged. The Ch'üeh is sometimes considered a transformation of aged monkeys; cf. de Groot, Rei. Syst., IV, 201 - In this connection E. mentions also a water-monkey called Wu-chih-hsi Éfc 3£ iff. The T'ai-p'ing kuang- chi, Vol. 57, 2 v (not 38 as E. says) writes M 3t IR- Werner mentions also the name 35 £ iß (Diet, of Chin.

Granet at that place gives a translation of the famous passage from Pao-p'u-tzu JS # =f- , where the dance of Yü is described in detail. But from this description it can not be inferred that it was danced on one leg; on the contrary, the movements of both legs are described in detail. Neither does Granet draw any such conclusion from the passage. It is only in the next chapter that he speaks of dances on one leg. 47) For documentation cf.

Probably the Yü of the South was originally not an anthropomorphic figure at all, but some water-monster51 and identified with the Yü of the Deluge either on account of some popular etymology, or, more probably, on account of the tendency inherent in all mythology to weld a hero and his counterpart together into one great ambivalent unit. The counterpart of Yü, the suppressor of the flood, may be found in something like the great tortoise of the Eastern Sea52. ' The fire-demons, who have their seats in big trees, especially camphor trees, are another characteristic of the Yao-group. Eberhard distinguishes between two softs of tree-worship, the one being typical of the Tai civilization and is especially connected with the trees planted around the altar of the Earthy whereas the other, typical of the Yao, worships the tree itself as magical in power or as the seat of the fire-god. It is to be questioned whether this distinction is feasible. Dendrolatry is common all over China, especially in Northern China5*. There is an interesting passage in Shih-tzu, which tells us that the camphor tree and another species of laurel arise from the ac- cumulation of Earth55, so that even the camphor tree is a derivation of the Earth and fits into Chavannes' theory. And in explaining the variety of differently shaped tree- goblins, de Groot is perhaps right in deriving them from the spirits of the dead56. One of these tree-demons is the Pi-fang *&amp; ^r57, which is conceived of as a one-legged bird5» and is usually explained as the wild-fire5^. This fire-bird Pi-fang is an attendant of one 51) cf.

Only herojis live on trees, cranes never. They are decidedly waders, so that they apparently have no room in the mountain-civilization of the Yao.

From other early quotations we know, that this clan was in possession of an especially efficient sword66, and that it also had to do with pottery67. The P'eng clan, on the other hand, was a continuation of the clan Shih-wei ^c # 68 (bearing the pig in its name), which is also frequently mentioned in the Bamboo Annals under Hsia-dates69.

A mythological figure of the Yao is also contained in the archer I # , about whom much has been said already in foreign literature1^. I will only mention in this connection, that Eberhard's assertion that the Hsi-Ho H $p myth belongs to the South is not undisputed73. 4 A discussion of the features of the Tai civilization covers the main part of the present volume. According to the evidence offered by Eberhard, the Tai have been the most influential group in the South. Many of their material achievements and spiritual conceptions became integrated into the body of Chinese civilization at a very early time, of which they form a very important part. The Chuang $É 74 are considered the mother-civilization of the Tai-group, having as their early center Kuangsi, Kuangtung and Southern Hunan. But the Tai influences radiated far beyond this region, not only in the entire South-west including Annam and Tongking, but even in Hupeh, Anhui, Southern Honan, Southern and South-Western 71) Eberhard (p. 260) considers the Tunguse the typical pig-breeders of Eastern Asia, but concedes another pig-center for this Tai civilization. Archaeological findings prove that pigs must have been domesticated in the Yang-shao civilization in Honan as well as in Kansu (cf. Andersson, An early Chinese Culture, in: Bull, of the Geol. Survey of China, No. 5, 123, p. 23; Preliminary Report etc. in: Mem. of the Geol. Survey of China, A, 5, p. 50), but it is still open to question, whether the Anyang pig was domesticated or not (information of P. Leroy, Institut de Géo-Biologie). On the whole question of pig-raising cf. Teilhard, Le Neolitique de la Chine in: Anthro- pologie, Paris 1926, 117 and 124; Erkes, Das Schwein im alten China, M.S., VII, 68 sqq. The conclusions drawn by Sowerby (China Journal, XIX, 1, 10 sq.) from the collection of the Heude Museum are apparently still to be received with caution. - Non-Buddhist pig-transformation-stories apart from the one mentioned above are told about Chu Tzu-chen 3c =¥- M. , who was canonized on Mount Mei f&amp; iJj (cf.

Thus the regions inhabited by the early Tai partly coincided with Yao regions, but whereas the Yao lived on hills and mountains, the Tai preferred the valleys and plains, and from the «diffierence of surroundings developed a totally different aspect of life. These two people apparently lived side by side without any contacts of civilizing importance. Certain similarities of their views and implements are explained by Eberhard not as an outcome of their symbiosis but as the growth from a common cultural stratum which underlay both of these civilizations. Strong Tai influences are shown already in the Lung-shan ft '1] civilization and again directly and indirectly in the realm of the Shang. So strong were these influences, that in many points the Shang seem to be the direct successors of the Tai, so that it is sometimes difficult to draw the line between the influencing and the influenced part. Only when, with the Chou, the northern element in Chinese civilization became more distinct, the Tai as a group of their own become more clearly discernible again. And from that time on the remnant group of undiluted Tai became more and more looked upon as "barbarians". The most important material contribution of the Tai was the cultivation of rice. This branch of agriculture, typical of the South and typical of people living in valleys and plains, was connected with the knowledge of artificial irrigation, which gained pivotal importance in regard to the integration of Chinese society. It was also con- nected with fish-breeding in the paddy fields. The spiritual overstructure of these occupations includes deluge-stories, the myth of the dog as the bringer of the rice, the sacrifices to the dog and to the ancestors culminating in the God Shang-ti _h $r , the elevated ancestor-God76. All these notions became absorbed into Chinese civilization at a very early stage, at a time for which no documents are extant. They became such obvious parts of the mechanism of this civilization, that nothing much has been said about them, and only scanty information as to their origin and development has been handed down. The mythical hero of agriculture is Shen-nung with his double-pronged plough and his invention of the market. Apart from his relations to the Pa and the Tibetan civilization77, he shows features which are typical of irrigated fields. Especially is his connection with the cow conceived as a proof of his Tai attachments. Now the cow (or the buffalo) is the animal which tramples down the ground of the paddy field, thus preparing it for cultivation. 75) pp. 353 and 361. 76) Rousselle isolates also a great mother-goddess for the Tai-civilization, who terminates in the Tao M conception of Laotzu; cf.

The fertility rites of the spring bull, bull-fights™ and bull-sacrifices, which must have taken the place of human sacrifices to a male god of the soil, of which the Ch'eng-huang M. 81 is a late deriva- tion79, are all considered Tai specialities. In the field of clothing the Tai excelled in preparing tissues from the bark and the fibres of different trees. Some of these fibres must have been rather similar to cotton. Also paper-manufacture was derived from these pursuits. In contrast to the Yao, the Tai were not a gay and cheerful society, but ridden with fear and possessed by conceptions of a dismal and gloomy character, Eberhard describes as one of their central features the Ku H charm80, around which a wide field of beliefs in magic and sorcery is grouped. This charm had a twofold use. It could be used to kill enemies, whose souls became serviceable to the practi- tioner of the charm, and it could also be used as a love-charm, which compelled the beloved person into sexual bondage. It was typical of this charm that poisonous animals, different species of reptiles and amphibia as well as insects, were used to prepare it; and some of these ingredients, such as the lizard, the frog and the toad, were of importance also in other features of the Tai, e. g. the deluge myth and the K'ung-sang *g ffe myth. The date for the most efficacious preparation of the Ku- charm was the 5th of the 5th moon and many conceptions connected , with the festivals of this day are of Tai origin. Another Tai festival was the 7th of the 7th moon and the myth of the cow-herd and the weaving girl, connected with this day is a remainder of their rites of matrimony. The Tai society was divided into two groups80a. The bridegroom, coming from one group had to put up a fight for his bride, who came from the other group; and as a token of reconciliation, the couple had to drink from a pair of con- nected cups. The division between the sexes, which was much stronger than with the Yao, engendered the habit of "Männergesellschaften" and of "Männerhäuser", with which initiation rites and sworn brotherhoods were connected. It is from the type of these houses, which used to be lake dwellings (Pfahlbau), that Eberhard derives the pile-construction of the Chinese house. Connected with the cultivation of rice and the fertility rites that its cultivation involved, he comes to speak of the dragon lung fi , which he sharply differentiates from 78) On which cf.

Especially the nine dragons which are found in the tribal myths of some of the southern clans are of importance. The modern Chinese dragon has derived most of his paraphernalia from his Tai forefather81. Above all, the dragon is the rain-bringer, especially for the spring rains and is connected with thunder- myths. But the Tai knew also a special Thunder-God82, who resembled a pig and who was related to other pig-gods and as such was of special importance in preparing, the paddy fields for cultivation^. The elephant-domesticator Shun ^r, who came from the easternmost regions of Tai civilization, has also his relationships with the thunder8*. Starting with the mythical emperors, Shao-hao &amp; ill , T'ai-hao p6c Jl and Chuan- hsü fñ gf 85 and their clans, Eberhard arrives at the No f|f processions and the use of masks8«, which with other influences became transformed into the Chinese theater. The last series of Tai conceptions which Eberhard treats of are those connected with the dead, with burial and the surviving of the soul after death. Most of these con- ceptions, which could have arisen only with a rice-cultivating civilization are in a slightly modified form still extant in the civilization of China Proper. 81) In this connection it is worth-while mentioning that in the older sections of the Book of Changes the dragon symbolizes the male principle but is superseded by the horse in the younger sections. The mare was originally the bearer of the female principle and was for its part superseded by the cow. The inferences which might be drawn from this fact are not without interest. The phoenix, a Yüeh-bird (according to E. p. 459) derived from the cock, does not seem to be an early Chinese conception. The cock and the pheasant are used as symbols for two of the "daughters" in the Book of Changes; cf. Shuo-kua R £h, Wilhelm p. 206. 82) on which compare: Herbert Müller, Über das taoistische Pantheon der Chi- nesen, in: Zeitschrift für Ethnologie, 1911, p. 425.

Vol. IX, 15</page><page sequence="18">226 BOOK REVIEWS 5 In the following chapter Eberhard arrives at the discussion of the Yüeh-civiliza- tion. This civilization originally spread over Chekiang, Kiangsu and parts of Anhui, Shantung, and Fukien. It has been traced in Corea and probably has also affected the Japanese. Later the Yüeh migrated to the South as far as Kuangtung, Kuangsi and Annam. According to Eberhard's hypothesis, the civilization was not an original unit but the product of a mixture of Tai and Yao influences. This process must have taken place rather early, according to Eberhard, the end of the 2nd millenium B. C. With the 3rd century A. D. the Yüeh disappear from history. Some of this group became boatsmen along the southern coast, but most of them became absorbed into the civiliza- tion of China Proper. The influence of this group on Chinese civilization made itself felt rather early and in a rather strong degree and always in a direct manner, for other cultural groups influenced by the Yüeh did not act in any fructifying sense on China* As this civilization was a product of Yao and Tai components - the Yao element is believed by Eberhard to have been the stronger one - we meet in it many features already known in the two earlier groups and from other sub-groups such as the Pa, which in their turn had been influenced by the Yao. Accounts on their material civilisation are only scanty. Eberhard tells us that they cultivated wet fields, which were burned before cultivation, that they did not know the horse, but that cattle were of importance; that they were versed in shipping, on inland waterways only in the beginning, but gradually conquering tfte coast and even the ocean; and that in their clothing the poncho-dress played a preeminent role. As to their beliefs and their mythology however the material is abundant. Firstly there exists a rich Yüeh-mythology about the great Yü, who, according to Eberhard, is pig-shaped and therefore pigs, especially a water-pig Pi Wèl are tabooed for his sake. The counterpart of Yü is the dragon (or snake) chiao j&amp;, which in one instance takes the form of a feudal lord by the name of Fang-f eng Bö M. 88, and the snake- and dragon-mythology is dealt with in great detail. This mythology involves the bull-shaped chiao89, the snake which is in possession of pearls^, and a great variety 87) On which compare Ch'iin-shu cha-chi, 12, 8v. 88) cf. also Erkes in TP, XXIV, 49, who considers Fang-f eng to have been a world- guardian, and recalls in this connection the soul-devouring giants of the East. 89) A curious slip occurred to E. as he identifies this with the rhinoceros, which is certainly no water-animal. Unfortunately E. does not reproduce the Chinese charac- ters, so that we do not know, whether he refers to the ssu SS or the hsi S . Bishop in his paper on Rhinoceros and Wild Ox in ancient China (China Journal, XVIII, 6, June 1933, p. 322 sqq.) identifies the ssu with a bovine animal, perhaps the gaur (Bibos gaurus) and holds that only the hsi was a real rhinoceros. 90) Pearls are recorded as coming from Ch'u 3i in Shih-tzu f* T-, II, 167.</page><page sequence="19">BOOK REVIEWS 227 of snaked-shaped gods9*. This whole complex is related again to the dragon-boat festival92 with its naval battles and the sacrifice of the defeated party to the beast-god of the water. This already shows to what degree the Yüeh conceptions are an evolution of Yao property. The same is the case with the maritime goddesses of the Yüeh93. Another center of the Yüeh mythology is the boneless King Yen of Hsü, whom Eberhard makes a fish94. This center points to Eastern Shantung, especially Lang- ya 38 35 , a place which always has been known for the cultivation of magical Taoism. Two very informative chapters are dedicated to the working of bronze and iron in the South. Eberhard concedes the Northern centers of bronze-casting the priority over the South; the Southern metallurgy must have either arisen independently from the North or must have spread from the North. But as far as iron is concerned, the priority of either region cannot yet be established. For the Yüeh especially, bronze- drums gained importance. Decorated with water-animals, frogs in particular, their significance went far beyond that of a simple musical instrument. Bells, perhaps derivations from the sonorous stones used in ancient times, have also a mythological bearing. Steles made of bronze and iron are interpreted as tokens of a developed megalithical civilization. Iron was of great value for warding off the chiao-dragons. The casting process often called for the sacrifice of human life. In a similar way, human beings were immured into walls and dikes. Magical figures made from pawlownia- or maple-wood are perhaps derived from these sacrifices. They are in any case of great magical value. 91) It is a pity that E. does not enter into the snakes (partly horned), which occur on the decoration of Shang bronzes; cf. for instance plate XVII of Ecke's catalogue of the Trautmann bronzes. E. does not examine the relationship between the Chinese and the Indian snake mythology. To my mind this relationship imposes itself to be rather close. Also the snake-eating birds have their pendant in the Garuda. Foster's theory that the Dravidas, coming from New Guinea, once inhabited India as well as a great part of southern China, would explain this relationship rather easily; cf. The Travels and Settlement of Early Man (1929), pp. 243 sqq. 92) This is the case also in the famous Pai-she-chuan fì JË (W&gt; a story which is rather revealing as regards the difference between dragon and snake; cf. Dschunke, 15 (Juni 1941) pp. 52 sqq. 93) According to Rouselle's conjecture the Yüeh must also have had the idea of a great mother-goddess, who revives her son, killed by a magician, and who might r have been the prototype of the tutelary goddess of the Yüeh; cf. Nachrichten der OAG, No. 50 (April 1939), p. 10. 94) The reasons for this equation are not very clear.</page><page sequence="20">228 BOOK REVIEWS Another chapter is devoted to the sun-birds, especially the cock and the raven and the much discussed sun-tree, fu-sang ^ fl9^. Chicken-worship, chicken-bone and egg oracles and cock-fights are described. This seems to be a bulk of conceptions which the Yüeh took over from the Tai. 6 A discussion of some of the contents of the Liao civilization follows96. This is- the most primitive of the mother-civilizations of the South, probably of Austro-asiatic origin, about which very little is known. Its original center was the border region between Szechuan and Hupeh, but it is also met with in Yunnan, Kuangsi, Kueichou, Hunan, and Kuangtung. It was a hunter-civilization, but did not know the bow. It became influenced very soon by the Yao and by the Tai, so that their original features are hardly discernible. The material which can be produced to document the habits and beliefs of the Liao is not untinted by the influences that they underwent. Their contributions to the civilization of China however are negligible. One of their conceptions seems to have been the world-egg Hun-tun ¿5 f$ , from which the world was created. This shows relations to the dog as well as to the thunder; it implies a shapeless chaos, or a shapeless ball of meat, which was divided and thereby developed into the world or into its first inhabitants. Reminiscences of this conception are still alive in the P'an-ku myth and the Chung-li myth, as well as in the image of Heaven and Earth as a couple. Also the marriage between brother and sister, especially between Fu-hsi $: ïl and Nü-kua $: iß97 might be derived from this source. Another group of the conceptions centered around head-hunting, head-worship and similar things. Cannibalism and initiation-rites involving the knocking out of teeth are known of also. 7 The last chapter collects information on the Tunguse civilization, especially on those parts which have had some bearing on China Proper. Their hunting fields were Manchuria and Corea, as well as parts of Hopei and Shantung. The most astonishing result of Eberhard's inquiries is, that he could not find any early trace of shamanism with the Tunguse nor did bear-worship seem to have been one of their original features. 95) cf. Feng and Shryock in JAOS 53, 1 (March 1933), p. 61; Schlegel in TP, a (1892) p. 129. There again Foster's theory (cf. Note 91) could explain the parallelism between Chinese and American mythology, cf. Bretschneider: Fu-sang, or who dis- covered America (Chinese Recorder, III, October 1870) and especially Erkes in TP, XXIV (1925/26), p. 33 sqq. 96) No Chinese character is given; probably the JJf are meant, but this tribe is usually pronounced lao.

On the other hand, their part in Corean civilization is also strong. One of their specialities was their living in caves, which were dug vertically into the earth. From these cave-dwellings cellars and jails evolved; people over sixty seem to have been interred alive in caves of this sort.- A Tunguse invention was also the heated K'ang-bed98. The dog was the guide of deceased souls and a protector against evil influences. Figures of dogs, made of grass, were able to absorb diseases etc., and they were thrown away or burned after having been used. The same use was made of these figures on burial occasions, and from them the mortuary objects made from paper were later derived, (so that their meaning is altogether different from those made from wood or €lay). 8 The material analysed in this book is abundant. Information and explanations of nearly every object and conception occurring in Chinese folk-lore is displayed. A short synopsis like the present cannot venture to exhaust all or even a part of its contents; it can only draw the contours of the main train of ideas. The reviewer of this volume works under a series of heavy handicaps at that. The ñrst concerns the author himself and his method of working. For Eberhard lives in a place, where library facilities are apparently not what is needed for a work like the one he has produced. Be has therefore to quote frequently from editions which are not to be recommended. Moreover a number of important works were apparently not accessible to him when he wrote this book, so he had to neglect much information which would have supported or perhaps even modified his opinion. In other instances, he had to resort to the old Chinese custom of quoting by memory, without being in the position to locate the quotation. For the bulk of the book, his information is drawn from quotations in encyclopaedias such as the T'ai-p'ing yii-lan ;&amp; ^ fâ ^, and the T'ai-p'ing kuang-chi :fc *F Ig I IE . For a book like his, this manner of proceeding is altogether justified, though we should have liked to see well known books like the Han-shu $t H quoted from the original. Eber- hard makes only parsimonious use of Chinese characters in names and titles. His intention was to furnish all the necessary characters in an index, but as this index apparently was worked out rather in a hurry, it is far from complete, and as he indulges in a rather unique kind of romanization, there are many instances, where it is impossible to ascertain actually what Chinese word he meant. Also his bibliography which could liave solved many a doubt, is incomplete and is meant to be so, as it lists only the titles of those books which have not been quoted in the first two volumes of his publication. And these two volumes have not yet appeared in print! 98) Also typical for the Lung-shan civilization; cf. Liang Ssü-yung, The Lung- shan Culture, in: Quarterly Bulletin of Chinese Bibliography, New Series I (1940), p. 254.</page><page sequence="22">230 BOOK REVIEWS This leads to the second handicap of the reviewer. For the documentation of many of his statements, Eberhard refers to these unpublished volumes and to another book of his which apparently has not been published either - at least it is not accessible in this town - which he calls "Meine Volksmärchen" or simply "Volks- märchen"". . And even for undocumented statements, when one is not expressly referred to one of these books, one is left to wonder whether they might furnish the explanatory link. Under these circumstances a review which does justice to Eberhard's- work is entirely impossible, much more a criticism. The reviewer had therefore, much to his own distress, to restrict himself to outlining the general ideas. It is only oc- casionally - especially in the part concerning the Yao - that I have ventured to put forward a few personal remarks. It is seriously to be hoped, that the missing volumes may be put at our disposal as soon as possible so that the real value of this book may properly be put to judgement and the stimulating results of Eberhard's endeavours, may be made use of by the scholars concerned.
