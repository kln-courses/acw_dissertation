INTRODUCTION PREHISTORIC settlement in central Macedonia, Greece (FIG. 1), had a high density in the Vasilika, Gallikos, and Axios valleys, with the Vasilika valley, and western Chalkidiki having a great concentration of Late Neolithic sites.2 The region is hilly and dissected by numerous small stream and river valleys, dry during summer, with the exception of the Vasilika valley, where water is always abundant. The valley, with a reasonable Neolithic arable potential, is open to the sea on the west and bounded to the north and east by mountains providing rough grazing. Several prehistoric sites in the Vasilika valley and its I Warmest thanks are due to the archaeozoologists Louis Chaix and Isabelle Chenal-Velarde, for their kind help towards species identification (based on photographs) of the Vasilika head, as well as Eftychia Yannouli, for kindly providing a copy of the proofs of her 2003 article, then in press, and commenting on wild fauna, and in particular Felidae, in prehistoric Greece. We also thank warmly the referees for their helpful comments. Special abbreviations: Bahn 1997 = P. Bahn, Journey through the Ice Age (Los Angeles, 1997). Becker 1986 = C.

Marangou): (a) top view, (b) bottom view. The object of which this head is a part should probably be reconstructed as a horizontal beam of rectangular cross-section (W. min. 6.38 cm) with a zoomorphic extremity; this beam could rest on a support, possibly leaving the jaw and muzzle protruding c.lo cm. It will have belonged to a structural element: it was not an 'autonomous' figure. Certainty about the identification of the animal represented is not absolute: the face seen frontally may even look somehow human, or ape-like, but the closest similarity seems to be with Felidae (lion?), particularly in the profile, the upright ears and schematically rendered mane.'l 13 On the ground that, having its eyes in front and not at the sides, it could not be a ruminant, Louis Chaix and Isabelle Chenal-Velarde thought that identification as a lion was not excluded (in so far as one could judge from photographs), and that in profile the resemblance was strong. Chenal-Velarde considers this identification as probable; Chaix suggests a second possibility, Mustelidae, in which case the figure would be larger than life-size. Yet this impression is rather due to the fragmentary condition of the muzzle, which looks pointed on some photographs but in reality is not.</page><page sequence="8">8 CHRISTINA MARANGOU AND DIMITRIS GRAMMENOS Although Neolithic and Chalcolithic (Eneolithic) clay figurines are not a rarity in central Macedonia,'4 the Vasilika head combines unusual or enhanced characters, in particular: (a) exceptionally large size or even monumentality (salience); (b) display (conspicuity): the front and sides of the face and the head summit were apparently put on view, projecting out supposedly from some larger construction, probably not at a higher, but rather at a lower level than the spectator's eyes; (c) probable practical functionality as element of a structure, in opposition to autonomous movable figurines, usually considered as of unknown practical function; and (d) animality and in particular wildness, or alternatively hybridity concerning the represented theme. These aspects are examined in the context of the Neolithic and Chalcolithic cultures of the area, as well as of those of SE Europe and SW Asia. II. 'MONUMENTALITY' NEOLITHIC FIGURES OF EXCEPTIONAL SIZE Variability in the size of figurines is common in the Neolithic and Chalcolithic in Greece and SE Europe.'5 Besides, a restricted number of large-size figures is preferred during specific periods and in some areas, while elsewhere or in other periods there is a preference for large numbers of smaller figurines.'6 In Anatolia, very early stone anthropomorphic statues of various dimensions, including life-size and larger than life-size, as well as relief representations on monolithic pillars, were carved at G6bekli Tepe (ioth-9th mill. BC) and Nevah ori (9th mill. BC).'7 Monumental sculpture is integrally related to 'cult buildings' although fragments of figures have usually been found in secondary contexts. Several pieces of limestone sculpture were found in a bench in a building at Nevalih ori, where the back wall contained monolithic pillars, a niche out of sight from the entrance, and a podium, possibly the pedestal for a 'cult statue'.'8 A head larger than life-size (H. 0.37 m) must have belonged to a large statue that might have originally been placed in such a niche.'9 In a later building, the bench was covered with stone slabs, pillars with relief decoration were situated in the centre of the room, and a small niche in the wall was, this time, visible from the entrance. In the southern Levant, in Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB) 'Ain Ghazal and Jericho, plaster statues were modelled on a reed structure, some of them life-size; atJericho there are three modules of these dimensions.2o It was this desire for greater scale that imposed such methods of construction on 'Ain Ghazal lime plaster figures (8th mill.

A massive clay double statue, and the clay podium on which it was fixed (W. c.o.6 m),28 were dried and subsequently burnt before the erection of the second-phase 'temple'.29 A double-headed statue-or two linked figuress3-perhaps 1 m high from the east space in the second 'temple' was presumed by the excavator to be female, because it had a pronounced belly, while the second head, found near the second shoulder, was taken for a bucranium.3' Several life-size busts of monumental figures were also said to have been found in the 'communal or cultic' buildings close to the 'temple'.32 Pillars supposedly used as busts were exceptionally well preserved, being made of dried clay with a sand core.33 Nevertheless, caution is necessary about the reconstruction of the 'statues' and heads of the Parta 'temples', since very little of the relative parts has survived. In the southern part of the area of the Vin a culture, a small number of very large terracotta heads from anthropomorphic figurines of very refined workmanship come from settlements,34 but the remaining parts of the figures have not been found. This monumental sculpture is a local feature of the Kosovo and Metohija regions in the later part of the Neolithic period (Vin-a-Plocnik, late 5th mill. BC).35 More precisely, such head fragments come from Predionica near Priftina,36 from Vitkova-ko Polje, and from Potporanj.37 There are stylistic analogies with material from Valai and Plovnik, but the region has its own conservative local character.38 A hollow head and neck fragment from Plovnik (phase Vinia-Gradac) was preserved up to a height of 20 cm (face 10.7 cm, neck 9.3 cm).39 Among rare 'monumental' figures from Serbia, two head fragments came from Vinia (L. pres. o10 cm) and Veliki Popovid-Mali Drum (nose fragment, L. 5.5 cm) but these disappeared during the First World War.4o The formation of this local group could result 22 The oldest occupation belongs to the Banat culture, corresponding to the Early Vinva culture, Vin'a A: Monah 1997, 32. 23 A construction system with pegs, used inter alia for fixing heads on torsos, had been used for standard-size Neolithic figurines: Marangou 1997, 227-65, pls. 62-70, esp. 229-34; 2000, 230-1; the heads of Rachmani Final Neolithic (Chalcolithic) figurines were also fixed into a hole in their body, and it has been suggested that they could be changed: ead. 1992, 143. 24 Lazarovici 1989, esp. 153. 25 Ibid., n. 35. 26 Double-headed Vinva figurines are known: Gimbutas 1984, figs. 86, o00-1; 1989, 171 fig. 271; 1999, 76; Trulesti double altars: Lazarovici 1989, 152; more double figurines and double- or multiple-headed figurines are known from Greece, particularly Thessaly: Marangou 1992, 165, 183 fig. 13 P, r-s. 27 G.

In fact, since the proportion of head to body was approximately 1:3,43 heads about 17 cm high would correspond to figures originally 50 cm high,44 if not more. Large (but not life-size) whole figures are also occasionally attested in other areas of SE Europe. An Eneolithic pair of a man and woman from Stara Zagora (Bulgaria) also measured originally 50 cm45 and a figure of a seated ithyphallic man from Late Neolithic Thessaly almost attains this height.46 Some Cucuteni A47 (but not Cucuteni B or C) figurines measure more than 50 cm48 and fragments of large examples, a female sitting on a seat and a horned animal head, the latter almost life-size, were found in relative proximity to each other at Dispilio49 (end of MN, around 5300 BC, western Macedonia).50 A fragment of a large animal (pig?) muzzle comes from Dimitra I (MN, eastern Macedonia).5' In Trugesti (NE Romania, Cucuteni A), some buildings contained fixed anthropomorphic objects of large dimensions, such as the lower part of a human figure (H. 55-5 cm, W. 34.2 cm), or an unbaked clay object (73 cm x 70 cm), possibly a human with raised arms or a 'building facade' with three heads (see below). Parts of one or two large anthropomorphic figures (at least one of them would have measured more than i m) were found near the hearths of buildings.52 Some small buildings with a hearth or oven had one large anthropomorphic representation in their centre, while large buildings had one permanent representation in the centre of the space or fixed to one of the walls, more rarely two large fixed anthropomorphic objects.53 Besides statues, quite large hollow anthropomorphic figurine-vessels have been found, also in significant locations. A female figure 85 cm high from Toptepe (eastern Thrace, Turkey, c.5000 BC) had apparently toppled from a raised platform in the centre of a room.54 Hollow rectangular human figures were found in several fifth-millennium SE European sites, including some more than 1 m tall, as in the Tisza Late Neolithic culture (SE Hungary).55 41 Garaianin 1952. 42 Kuzmanovid-Cvetkovid and Sljivar 1998, 175 and n. 13, 176. 43 Garaianin 1952. 44 Whittle 1999, 1o1. 45 Hdckmann 1999, n. 54. 46 G.

In contrast to standard-size Neolithic figurines, PPNB statues were public, according to Schmandt-Besserat.67 Chapman68 argues that the size, architectonic concept, and quality of modelling of the monumental Vinia figurines make it hard to imagine them in any context but a separate shrine. Cult, including rites (among others, rites involving monumental figures), was presumably performed in specific places during precise periods of time, according to Galovid.69 Chapman thinks that Vinda ritual and ceremonial would have been expressed not only at domestic levels, as with standard-size figurines, but also at public levels and that they would have constituted a primary force of social cohesion. They would have included prestige items displayed by individuals with ritually ordained higher status; in Vinia architecture, social inequalities seem likewise to be limited to the level of display.7o In the examples from SE Europe presented above, finds which are usually published without contextual information, precise evidence concerning structural elements, or the bodies to which large heads had belonged, is rare. In the same cultures, smaller figurines of similar types, often freestanding, could also be structural elements of tools or vessels.7' Evidence about more recent discoveries with contextual information, such as at Trugesti, 56 Cauvin 1997, 153; cf.

Other high-relief figures-or parts of figures, such as modelled breasts or heads-or real skulls had some specific connection with the building where they were found; in particular when they were fixed to or embedded in its walls, internal partitions or structures, such as hearths or ovens, and obviously interconnected with them. Both large freestanding figures and embedded elements were put on display for those entering the buildings. III. DISPLAY BUILT-IN OR FIXED APPENDAGES SUCH AS LARGE HEADS AND SKULLS Among the earliest occurrences of the symbolic use of animal skulls in the East, the first bucrania were buried in architectural structures, and were therefore invisible (Mureybet).72 In fact, from io,ooo BC onwards complete aurochs skulls were buried with their horns in the houses, in clay benches, and associated with scapulae of bovids or equids; later, horns are still buried in house walls. These intentional deposits were symbolic: wild bovids were not hunted then and use of their skulls does not reflect familiarity.73 Scapulae of bovids (not food refuse), were also found in (afer Hiyiik houses.74 Yet already at aceramic Hallan Qemi a semi-subterranean structure contained a complete aurochs skull which would have hung on its wall, displayed facing the entrance.75 The tradition of hanging one or more aurochs skulls on the walls of 'important buildings' continues at (aybnii (9th mill. BC): a horned skull hung on the wall facing the courtyard in the 'Skull Building'.76 Three massacres (antlers) and an aurochs bucranium, the latter probably connected to a necklace of clay beads, were hanging on the walls of the Maison aux bucranes at Jerf-el- Ahmar.77 Later, at (atalh6yiik (7th mill. BC), cattle horns78 and skulls had either been incorporated into architecture, fixed to walls, or (horns) embedded in benches.79 The highly symbolic treatment of cattle at Qatalh6yiik East is related to morphologically wild animals (not biologically domesticated cattle) that were probably hunted in some way rather than herded.8s If the first bucrania at Mureybet were 'natural', at 9atalhbyiik heads are modelled in clay, but with natural horns.8' In SE Europe, bucrania have been found, although at a later date, by the hearth or the oven of houses. A specific location was provided for them in the house, often related to the fire place. Near a house oven at Dikili Tash (eastern Macedonia, end of 6th mill. BC), the skull of a domesticated bovid of indeterminate sex, with broken horns and features modelled in clay, had presumably fallen from an originally vertical position. Its flat reverse side corresponds to the support on which it rested. Some other, smaller figurine fragments 72 Cauvin 1997, 171. 73 Ibid., 48. 74 Ibid., 124. 75 M.

Instead of a cult interpretation, the excavators prefer a function of 'displayed decoration, comparable to a trophy' (see below, n. 125),82 although the skull had belonged to domesticated cattle. At Dispilio (western Macedonia), in the end of the MN (around 5300 BC), a fragmentary clay head of a horned animal8s might also have fallen from a higher spot. A clay plaques4 with a horned animal head (ram?) in relief`5 could represent in miniature an animal skull hung or fixed to a house wall in Dimitra II (beginning of LN). In Opovo (see below) and Jakovo-Kormadin buildings, heads or bucrania were put on posts or on partitions by the oven. Bucrania, different in type from large figurine heads,"6 have in fact been found in the Vinia-Plovnik phase in Vin-a houses."7 In Jakovo-Kormadin (Serbia, Late Vin a),88 a fragmentary, clay-moulded skull of domesticated cattle was found beside an oven and an ash pit. It would originally have been fixed to a partition over the pit, near the oven and in front of the wall of a house that was divided into three compartments. Although in an everyday room, it was separated by its elevated position from daily activities.89 In one of the two compartments of another house of the settlement, traces of an oven and a decorated 'altar' with a fragment of another bucranium were preserved.90 Bucrania have thus been found in two houses of the settlement, but there are differences in their precise location.91 Furthermore, in an earlier phase of the Sabatinovka II (early Tripolje) 'sanctuary' (see below), at one end of a building, a big bull skull with intact preserved horns was found; on the skull sat a small female clay figure, represented seated.92 The custom of placing bucrania in elevated positions, sometimes in association with female figurines,y9 is attested in SE Europe mostly from the end of the MN (last part of 6th mill. BC) till the end of the LN (mid-5th mill. BC).94 Furthermore, animal (cattle or goat) skulls have also been found buried in post-holes or pits in Neolithic houses in central Europe and have been interpreted as foundation sacrifices.95 Animal skulls, particularly of bovids, were found, even two in one tomb, in Neolithic and Chalcolithic men's tombs at Durankulak.96 As bucrania are usually not well baked in Vinia culture, they could not have been placed in the exterior of buildings: VasiC has already established that Vinca bucrania were situated inside houses.97 This is consistent with the above evidence. Decoration of house interior walls is frequent in the Gumelnita and Vin-a cultures among others, and walls as well as bucrania were painted in the Vinca settlement.98 Structures with clay 'altars' decorated in relief, constructed against a wall of a large building, are found in the 82 P.

Indeed, David Lewis-Williams"6 has suggested that bull's heads and some other relief sculpture"7 may be seen as 'coming through' the walls, such as the vulture beaks, animal jaws, and boar tusks protruding from the walls into the interior spaces of buildings. But, even then, such figures were only visible to persons inside the buildings. Nevertheless, in some cases, horn ornaments or animal heads modelled on clay house- or 'fa*ade' models from SE Europe look like real animal heads on gable ends (e.g. Trugesti, Kdr6s, Gumelnita, and even Thessaly),"8 while human heads are rare."9 An animal represented lying on top of the roof of a clay house (or oven) model from Slatino (Late Eneolithic), its head towards the front end, has been interpreted as an apotropaic representation of a protector theriomorphic god, or as a totem animal.120 One could argue that animals are represented on the exterior of models, because it would be technically difficult to model them in their interior, or that they would have been invisible (which would not be the case with models of house interiors of the LN). However, in central Europe, in the Neolithic lakeside village of Arbon-Bleiche 3 (3384-3370 BC) by Lake Constance,121 several bucrania (bovids, goat, aurochs, and bison) would have hung mostly on the outside on the house walls, even several for one house, and would thus have been quite visible to outsiders. Skulls exhibited outside buildings might have had a different meaning from skulls or heads fixed to or embedded in walls within buildings, which were only visible to people inside them. Since at least the Middle Ages, horns hanging on the roof have protected houses from demons, evil spirits, illnesses, or lightning, and horn pendants have protected people from epidemics; the skulls at Arbon-Bleiche may be interpreted as apotropaic magic devices against epidemic illnesses and parasites, attested by other evidence on the site.122 They may also constitute the material form of beings protecting the house.123 Apotropaic magic is also practised in our own day with animal skulls, in northern Greece among other places, for the protection of fields or houses."14 With regard to skulls found by outer walls, it has also been suggested that horns and bucrania, in particular from domesticated cattle, might symbolize man's power, status and fertility, as ploughing bovids have a social and economic value, while bucrania of wild animals (possibly consumed on 112 Hodder 1999, 161. 113 Chapman 1981, 82-3. 114 Hodder 1990, 51, 84- 115 Hodder 1999, 163- 116 Quoted ibid. 163. 117 Mellaart 1967, e.g. 46 pls. 22-4, 48 pls. 27-8, 121 fig. 33. 118 Makkay 1978, 14; G.

It cannot be proved that the Vasilika head, probably representing a wild animal, was originally located inside a building rather than outside. Nevertheless, most of the Neolithic heads or skulls presented above, for which contextual evidence is available, were found in the interior of edifices. Although they were closely linked to their buildings, heads or bucrania on walls, and over or on fireplaces, do not seem to have had, in parallel to their apparent (though unknown), symbolic meaning, any practical function, in contrast to figurative architectural elements. IV. FUNCTIONALITY 'ARCHITECTONIC PLASTIC': VERTICAL AND HORIZONTAL FIGURATIVE ELEMENTS Despite occasionally coexisting with bucrania, sculptures should be distinguished from them, even from the functional point of view. At Nevalih ori, several anthropo- or zoomorphic structural elements are sculpted in stone in the interior of buildings, as are niches, posts, stelae, etc.127 Some monolithic statues are 'shaped as totem-poles',128 sculpted compositions forming the upper part of such pillars.129 Anthropomorphic pillars could have been functional, for example supporting the roof, but in some cases it was suggested that they were located in unroofed structures.'30 Limestone human masks could also have been architectonic elements.'131,13 Occasional zoomorphic so-called 'sceptres"33 at Gabekli Tepe could have been tenons inserted into walls.'34 125 The same suggestion, as a trophy, was advanced about the Dikili Tash bucranium by Darcque and Treuil (n. 82). B. Hell, 'Le culte du troph6e en Europe occidentale: reflexion ethnologique sur la continuite de l'imaginaire du sauvage', in J. Desse and F. Audoin- Rouzeau (eds), XIIIemes Rencontres Internationales d'archiologie et d'histoire d'Antibes, IVMmes Colloque International de l'Homme et l'animal (Juan-les-Pins, 1993), 440-52, recommends caution on extrapolations and establishing relations between hunting customs and practices concerning domestic animals. See also ibid. on later trophies and their significance. 126 Deschler-Erb 2002. 127 Hauptmann 1993. 128 Schmidt 1997, esp. 74- 129 Hauptmann 1999, 76 fig. 14. 130 Schmidt 2000.

BC) are considerably later than the material examined here: D. Berciu, 'A zoomorphic "sceptre" discovered in the People's Republic of Bulgaria and its cultural and chronological position', Dacia, n.s. 6 (1962), 397-409, esp. 405 fig. 3; Z. Va arova, 'Zoomorphes Zepter aus Kjulevca, Bezirk Sumen' Studia Praehistorica, 8 (1986), 203-8). According to L. Ghetov, 'Sur le problame des sceptres zoomorphes en pierre', Studia Praehistorica, 3 (198o), 91-6, they constitute the older evidence of the presence of the steppe tribes in the Balkans (III-II mill. BC), with their ochre inhumations of the first half of the 4th mill. BC. It is usually believed (as by Berciu, 398 and n. 15, Ghetov, and Va arova) that they were in fact used as sceptres, with a probable double function, suggesting social status and ritual 'distinction'. They should be clearly distinguished from the material examined here, in spite of their common points: the idea of a relatively large, zoomorphic or hybrid extremity of a functional element is similar, but their function was obviously different, as they were carved in stone and, during use, they should be positioned vertically, not horizontally, and would be movable. The part of 'sceptres' usually preserved forms a very stylized animal head (Mantu (n. 47), 274 fig. 13): they have generally a straight muzzle, two prominences on the</page><page sequence="17">'MONUMENTALITY', FUNCTIONALITY, ANIMALITY 17 VinEa 'sanctuaries' display architectural elements, such as monumental 'altars', decorated walls, or pillars/posts which served to carry bucrania.'35 A connection to fire places is again noted in several cases. The interior of the building at Parta'36 a 'shrine of some kind"37 was subdivided in the first phase'38 and a space was delimited, the entrance to which was 0.6 m wide, and which contained a tablelike 'altar'.139 A podium 0.5-0.6 m wide (for the bust of a figure, according to the excavator) was to the right of the hearth.14o The second phase building'4' was divided into two parts. A monumental 'statue' was found in the eastern part behind a double doorway,'42 at some distance from the walls. Large, tablelike 'altars' were divided by a clay wall in their middle into two parts. In the upper part of this wall, skulls of medium-large animals were fixed in the clay.'43 There was an 'altar' in the western space and a podium. 44 On an 'altar' there was a rectangular, chest-shaped clay container (Kassette), and nearby a figure-head with horns in it.'45 40%0/0 of the sanctuary, subdivided in spaces, was thus occupied by 'altars', benches and elevated platforms.'46 Two decorated and inlaid bucrania were found by the entrance,'47 initially attached to the clay upright posts on both sides of the door. In one of the bucrania, part of a charred horn was preserved. At Opovo (Vojvodina), a clay 'pedestal' (H. 40 cm high, D. max. 40 cm) is supposed to have originally stood to the north of an oven in feature 2, a domestic structure with ovens, internal divisions, pots, etc. (Late Vinva, Vinva-Ploanik C2, possibly D1). The 'pedestal' was probably made of the same clay as the building superstructure, and was associated with a number of vases, as well as with a hollow clay 'head' moulded into a half-dome with two 'ears' but without any preserved surface decoration. It was suggested that originally this 'head' stood on top of the 'pedestal'. Similar heads and pedestals are known, for example, from Neolithic settlements in South Bulgaria, such as that by the Stara Zagora district hospital.'48 One skull from Jakovo-Kormadin (see above) must upper part of the head (ears?), bulging eyes and forehead, but the species of the animal is not recognizable: horse, wild boar, pig and dog have been proposed (Berciu, figs. 1-2, 4). They are up to about 15 cm long, have a shaft- hole, and would have been fixed to a soft object, probably in wood, as a handle. A third protuberance or horn behind the ears could have been used for attachment. The animal head was therefore at the extremity of a wooden stick (Berciu). A small specimen (L. 8 cm) from Kjulevca (Sumen, Bulgaria) found in an ochre crouched burial of a man had belonged to a 40 cm long bone grip with a cavity at the upper end. On the upper part of the animal head, an oblong, rounded opening was used to fix it in the cavity of the grip, by means of a peg (Va arova). It may be significant that, for a black stone, zoomorphic, shaft-hole axe, found in a much later (EBA) level of Sitagroi Vb (C14 205514obc and 20211+4bc; "Long House"; C.

In another compartment of the building, a fragmentary bucranium has on its back the imprint of the supporting pillar, as well as of the hair coming from the front of the bovid skull.15o An arrangement similar to that inJakovo-Kormadin of two pillars at 1.5 m distance between them, in front of the oven, is attested at Vinva.'s' The Jakovo-Kormadin double posts with heads could be compared to a Cucuteni A flat 'building facade' model (1 m2) from Truaesti, with pairs of pole-shaped figures in relief, a gabled roof(?) with horn-shaped beams, and two unequal human heads on its upper part. The 'facade' had fallen down horizontally on the floor, but was probably originally set up vertically, either resting on the floor or fixed to the wall of a house.'5~ The 'facades' constitute another example of frontality of large, very flat figures, visible from one direction. On the other hand, pairs of pole-figures are not rare; H6ckmann'53 thinks that the pair of poles horizontally linked was an important Eneolithic cult object, with a possible precursor of anthropomorphic 'pole-beings' (Pfostenwesen) as early as the two painted pillars of the Cascioarele 'temple' from the Boian culture (c.5000 BC). Stone benches, often with decorated slabs, and pillars or stelae, are attested in the Near East very early, in particular in communal buildings. AtJerf-el-Ahmar, the bench is c. 1 m wide, worn by repeated use, and surrounds the interior of rounded or elliptical buildings, leaving a large empty space in the centre.'54 At Hallan Qemi I, a 'special' structure had benches along the walls. At Nevalih ori (from Level II onward), a stone bench im wide, bonded with clay, encircled the interior of a structure.' 55 A group of people would sit or perhaps more probably squat here, on fixed wide seats in a communal built space. Several examples of clay miniature furniture, including benches, chairs, or armchairs, have been found in Neolithic SE Europe,'56 such as several types of stool from Dikili Tash (LN),'57 a very deep armchair from Galabnik III (Karanovo I-III, 62oo-56oo00),'5 or a chair with separate anthropomorphic figurine from Topolnica (Vin a A-D, Karanovo III- V, 5500-4500).'59 They clearly imitate lost prototypes.'60 A natural size (seat diameter i m), empty, clay chair, originally covered with wooden planks, with a horned back, was found in the 'sanctuary' of Sabatinovka (Ukraine, Cucuteni culture, 4800-4600 BC), next to a large bench, on which a number of clay miniature copies were found, together with figurines.'6' It was assumed that an overseer ('priest or priestess') of the ritual and other activities (baking bread or grinding flour) sat on the large chair; or else that there was either a large wooden figure (now lost), or an invisible being, similar to the figurines on the bench.162 There are also clay miniatures, in the form of movable seats, which are separate and individual (though rarely large enough for two figurines).

The theme of a female or male figure seated on an (elaborate) seat (separate or combined) is well known,'64 although the figures on leopard 'thrones', as at (atalh6yiik, who are obviously important,'65 are exceptional.'66 Seats, posts, walls with bucrania, and representational and functional elements are combined in the interiors of some buildings; these are frequent and early in the Near East. See for instance the 'buildings for special purposes', with monumental carved pillars and sculpture which characterize the Early Neolithic (gth mill. BC) in the Urfa region.'67 There are several monolithic architectural features, a bench of stone slabs, and some pillars with animal relief decoration (snakes, ram, bovid, dog, bird, fox) in narrative scenes,'"6 in the possibly unroofed structures at G6bekli Tepe (EPPNA-E/MPPNB).'69 At Hallan Qemi, (ay6nii, Nevall ori, and G6bekli Tepe such exceptional large 'special (cult?) buildings' are architecturally distinct from the other structures of the village in plan, technique, size, and monumental approach, and must therefore have been specifically designed, setting them apart from the houses in the same location; their erection required an organized collaborative effort,170 and would have been used for the periodic assembling of a social group, or part of it, in a specific constructed space, on fixed seats. Both monumental buildings at Nevall ori could be interpreted as constructions for ritual ceremonies, as could the 'special buildings' at 9ay6nti.'7' AtJerf-el-Ahmar, the rounded, semi-subterranean, communal buildings containing a bench decorated with sculpted slabs, also seem dedicated only to meetings or ceremonies.'7' The auroch scapulae deposited in the benches, the flint in the walls, and the imported wood used for the central posts suggest that buildings with benches had been used for solemn meetings, although of unknown purpose (religious or secular?).173 A religious meaning for these structures was suggested by Schmidt and Hauptmann,'74 while Gebe1175 points out the possible conflation of a communal meeting place with a 163 Hegediis and Makkay (n. 55). 164 e.g. Marangou 1992, 165 fig. 9; 1997, pls. 66 a; 69 a-e; G.

These gathering places could have been intended for the performance of initiation rites according to Bischoff et a1.'76 A use for ritual assemblies could explain the hidden niches, the large sculptures, the narrative scenes, the dangerous animals represented, the restricted access to the interior of the buildings, the seats for spectators, and the empty space in the centre. Bucrania displayed in public buildings, and sculpted pestles or stone bowls, show elements that become apparent later at (ay6nti, Nevalih ori, and G6bekli Tepe: they reflect, not only symbolism, but also specialized craftsmanship and a very early 'non- egalitarian, complex form of socio-economic pattern' in a hunting/gathering society.'77 Persons particularly qualified, with individual gifts and a natural superiority, must have conducted the ceremonies, which would have involved symbolic activities.'78 The existence of a power elite belonging to a hunters' society has been suggested.'79 There is growing evidence that a social group related to the cults also controlled the economy, while the social structure was stratified, non-egalitarian. Trade, specialized crafts and some technological developments may have been stimulated, guided and monopolized by such a privileged group, according to M. Ozdogan.'so In central Anatolia on the other hand-(atalh6ytik, Aplklh, Hbyticek-the 'shrines' of 'cult rooms' were identified as such principally by the interior features and inventories, while architecturally they are nearly the same as the domestic structures. Any room or building could be transformed into a shrine and used for ritual ceremonies.'8' Mellaart's seventh-millennium 'shrines' at (atalhaiyiik had traces of a wide range of domestic activities, although certain buildings played a more central role in 'cultural elaboration'. s2 In SE Europe, relative evidence is again later (end of 6th mill. BC). Entrance into some spaces at Parta could be limited, in particular through narrow passages (W. 0.60 m).'83 The 'bust' with a hole into which an animal skull could presumably have been fixed, and its clay podium opposite the entrance, would mean that the latter was guarded by it.'84 A similar suggestion has also been proposed for Neolithic Sha'ar Hagolan (Jordan Valley), where most of the figurines were found near the room entrances, and could have been intended to guard the rooms, preventing evil powers from entering.'85 The animal heads or skulls on door posts or on internal partitions, or on top of vertical posts or structures'86 found in SE Europe, could suggest the liminality of doors or passages, internal or external, or restricted access to specific, separated spaces of buildings. Such heads could 'protect' fireplaces, or 'guard' particular areas, or, alternatively, such areas could have been selected in order to keep and display important symbolic items (namely, the heads). In addition, it is possible that, in those spaces, group lore was communicated or information revealed. This could obviously have happened through sight of these items, without excluding the use of other senses (e.g. smell: frequent existence of fireplaces nearby).

Such arrangements may then be assemblages of ancestral relics or hunting trophies; if not (only) functional, such zones might have had ritual or totemic relevance as display areas for cultic paraphernalia.'87 The Vasilika head and neck were permanently joined; the head could not be changed, nor does it seem to have been positioned vertically, as in the case of 'statues' or vertical posts, but rather horizontally, as its under-surface is left unworked. It could thus have protruded from a wall, a door-frame, or a vertical display or screen, or have belonged to a structure with horizontal elements, such as a bench or a chair with armrests. LN evidence from the Vasilika C settlement shows that the buildings had stone foundations, but that dried clay bricks were used for walls;'88 clay architectural elements or appendices are conceivable, as in numerous real as well as miniature buildings in SE Europe. Some standard-size figurines from Vasilika C show so-called bird-shaped, hybrid faces, and bulky bodies with a flat base.'89 These could also have been inspired by large examples of massive hybrid figures, or of heads possibly fixed to posts or pillars. It is not known if the character of the space where the Vasilika head was originally located was common or domestic. If its unusual solemn appearance might argue for the first alternative, this does not necessarily mean that it would be visible easily, permanently, or to anyone. Monumentality, display, and functionality could have been combined with liminality, if we take into consideration comparable examples from other areas, for which contextual information is available, and which were accessible through doors or internal building partitions. To these already uncommon points must be added the exceptional aspect of the iconic representation of a wild animal or a hybrid creature, probably with felid appearance. V. ANIMALITY 1. LIONS? Archaeozoological evidence Man and lion have known each other since the times of Australopithecus; cave lions, the ancestors of lions, lived in Africa, the Middle East, a large part of Europe, Siberia, and North America, from the Early Pleistocene190 and from the Palaeolithic in North Bulgaria (late Pleistocene Felis spelaea Goldf).19'Moreover, Palaeolithic remains of Panthera leo spelaea Goldf have recently been reported from Macedonia, Attica, and the Peloponnese. 9' There is a vacuum of about 5000 years in Bulgaria between late Palaeolithic and the earlier Neolithic evidence, but Panthera leo persical93 must have been indigenous in Bulgaria'94 '87 P.

Bones from two lions, a young individual and an adult, were found at Sozopol (Eneolithic). Lion bones from Kastanas come from at least five adult lions (one each from phases 13, 12, 11, 10, 8).223 Moreover, many of the lion bones found do not belong to parts of the skeleton such as claws, teeth, or skulls which remain after skinning, and which could have arrived at the settlements together with hides (but see below), or as amulets or curiosities from far away.224 Nor do they show traces of work, and therefore were not brought as artefacts, and only in a few cases could they have been refuse from tool manufacture.225 Most of the bones come from parts of the body associated with muscles and other soft tissues; such parts cannot be transported far without being damaged. Consequently, the animals were killed in the surroundings of the settlements where they were discovered, 26 which implies that groups of lions lived in the area. Even in early Archaic levels at Kalapodi (Boeotia) a scapula bone shows that lion must have been killed and consumed there.227 Indeed, most lion long bones from various settlements had been hacked, like those of other large animals which are typical meat suppliers, such as aurochs, cattle, deer, etc., and show the same traces of cutting as the meal refuse of cattle, sheep, goat, and pig with which they were found, permitting the hypothesis that lion meat was consumed at Tiryns,228 as well as at Kastanasl29 and Durankulak, where there are traces of the preparation of meat for eating.230o In mythology, Chiron fed Achilles on lion marrow and viscera,23' so that he should acquire the animal's strength; lion-meat consumption was not unthinkable for ancient Greeks, although they did not necessarily eat it frequently or during regular meals. This is also suggested by lion and leopard bones from the temple area (priests' quarter) in Bogazkby-Hattu-a. Here, the eating of felids may have had medicinal or magical purposes.232 In fact, cognitive or ideological factors play an extremely important role in Homo sapiens' adjustment to the environment, in particular concerning the choice of food.233 In any case, occasional consumption of lions would constitute evidence for wild lions sporadically hunted and killed by man234 in the vicinity. The rarity of lion remains discovered in Europe235 is in great part explained by the small probability today of finding large numbers of bones or teeth of free-living lions, because of natural decomposition in the open air, scavenging, and infiltration in the earth; 218 Ibid., 248, 295- 219 Ibid., 171, 261-2. 220 Ibid., 293. 221 Ibid., 166.

BC) at the Kalapodi Artemis/Apollo shrine, could have come from a hide, which might have been imported from Egypt or Asia Minor, according to the excavators.24' If a number of animals were hunted for their meat and/or their hide, others would have been killed occasionally in order to protect the settlements and domesticated animals24' from the danger of wild beasts living in surrounding areas. Wildcat remains occur in almost every prehistoric site of temperate Europe having a large bone sample: almost without exception, only adult wildcat bones are found, indicating that they were killed by herders protecting the young of their domesticated animals.243 Men are rarely eaten by lions, although this may happen when the lions' territory lacks wild fauna, but is occupied by men and their domestic animals.244 Agriculturalists and herders may then only try to protect their animals and crops, and drive lions off.245 However, the possibility of hunting for symbolic reasons cannot be altogether excluded. The importance of hunting in Bulgaria in the Neolithic and Eneolithic explains the extinction of some wild animals, while the high status of hunting could be shown by the social differences in the Varna cemetery.246 Bronze Age lion teeth at Mycenae, Pylos, and A. Irini are likely to have been prestige items or amulets.247 At Tiryns, the only animal bone found near the foot of a man's skeleton248 was a lion calcaneus, which could have belonged to a captive animal, or be an imported talisman. It has been suggested, concerning the hunting of animals which were very difficult to hunt, such as lion, and which provided small quantities of meat, that some inhabitants of Slatino (end of early Eneolithic) were experts in hunting and in undertaking hunting risks that did not provide 'any particular gain for the community'. Hunting would have become a 'pleasure and a favourite pastime' 236 Usener 1994, 12-13. 237 Demoule and Perlks 1993. 238 Halstead 1987, 77; id., 'Dimini and the "DMP": faunal remains and animal exploitation in Late Neolithic Thessaly', BSA 87 (1992), 29-59, esp. 36, 47; Demoule and Perlks 1993 with references. 239 Becker 1986, 168. 240 As Thomas 2003; Ninov 1989. 241 Felsch 2001, 195-6, pl. 62 b. 242 Ninov 1999, 324- 243 S.

Two men are in fact represented tying the legs of a lion lying on its back on a Mycenaean seal from Vapheio258 and wild animals were kept in enclosures in Mesopotamia.259 Remains of a family of captive lions come from Abydos in Egypt (3100oo BC); they were killed after the death of the pharaoh.260 Man has always feared the lion26' because of its strength and ferocity. It can attain 60 km/h in a sprint and a lion-hunt was complicated, needing both experience and courage.262 Group-hunting strategies and tactics, with defensive and offensive weapons, are represented in Mycenaean art.263 In fact, the lion-hunt is a collective task in most communities (cf. the Maasai in East Africa). Before the discovery of iron, the lion was only rarely hunted: a hunter might be killed by a wounded animal. Other technologies had to be developed for the successful fight of one man against one lion, such as horses and wagons in the late Hittite period.264 Precise methods for hunting lions by kings or princes, either on foot or in a chariot, as a sport, but at the same time possibly illustrating ritual gestures, are described in Mesopotamia.265 According to ethnographic evidence,266 killing a lion or other respected animal is surrounded by funeral, ritual, and purification ceremonies equal to that performed for homicide. A dead warrior-hunter is exposed, together with symbolic pieces of the large animals he has killed, such as lion and elephant bones, antelope and buffalo horns, etc. Phraseology concerning lions is human; kings are called lions; the lion has the highest position in the hierarchy of wild fauna, with only kings as its corresponding equal in the hierarchy of the civilized world.267 249 S.

Their habitats are steppes, savannahs, forests, karst territories with hilly relief and caves, plains, and mountains268 up to 3000 m high,269 but also bush, dry scrub, grassy plains, open woodlands,270 and in exceptional circumstances, dense forests (few cases are on record). 71 Lions live in a precisely-defined large territory, in small or large groups; they are rarely loners.272 They have a large nutrition spectrum, which can vary from small antelopes to buffaloes. 73 Their favourite prey consists of small and middle-sized mammals, particularly large bovids, and, if necessary, domesticated cattle or sheep; man only under exceptional circumstances. There is no direct reason for excluding the existence of lions, at least in small numbers,274 in the Balkan peninsula, and also in Greece, as the biological and geographical conditions for their existence were present.275 In the climatic optimum (c.5000 BC), in Neolithic and Eneolithic SE Europe, the main prey of lions, ungulates, were abundant (95% of wild animals)-aurochs constituted 0o% of wild animals (at Ezero 29.1% in the Eneolithic and 35-4% in the EBA)-and their presence makes that of large predators, including lions, very probable.'76 In Goljamo Delcevo,277 surrounded by dense forests, besides lion, other felidae (lynx and wild cat) are also found, as well as bison.278 In Durankulak, in the Dobrud a, a steppe at the beginning of the Holocene, there were typical animals of steppes and forest-steppes such as lions.279 Large and medium-size ungulates are also found in large numbers in both settlements.281 Ungulates constitute 98.2% of the wild animals, which make up the higher percentage (43.8%) of animal bones in Neo- and Eneolithic fauna complexes in Bulgaria.281 Lion remains were also found in Slatino, on the bank of a tributary of the Strymon in SW Bulgaria, where the importance of hunting increases sharply and where ungulates constitute again 98.2% of the wild-animal bones.285 The same percentage is attested at Neolithic Karanovo II. One should nevertheless be cautious concerning these percentages of bone material, for not only may bones have been lost selectively for various reasons,283 but early methods of recovery of excavated bones in Balkan sites may have favoured large-size herbivores. Current evidence is unequivocal that there must have been lions living free in prehistoric Greece.284 In addition, occasional lynx remains also argue for a habitat also adapted for lions.285 During the climatic optimum, the temperature was c.20 C higher than today in 268 Ninov 1999. 269 Becker 1986, 261. 270 Willms 1986, 142, 144. 271 Becker 1986, 261. 272 Willms 1986, 142. 273 Becker 1986, 171. 274 Usener 1994, 11. 275 Ninov 1999; Usener 1994, 5. 276 Ninov 1999. 277 Willms 1986, 140. 278 Extinct, as lion, in Bulgaria today: S.

The soil is very fertile, and there was good pasture and much timber in the foothills and the ranges to the north and the south.29' Kastanas is set close to a marine bay with bank vegetation and on the fringes of forests, by the coast of the Axios, a marshy area delimited to the west and east by mountains.'s9 It was an island in all its BC period of occupation, its shortest distance from the coast being 70 m. Its excavators think that the island was a central fortified settlement, and that the inhabitants were in close economic and social contact with an agricultural encampment on the coast, as shown by a large number of surface finds.293 In this natural environment, in the immediate vicinity of the mound, the inhabitants had access to a considerable part of their diet, but their radius of activities reached further regions of the wooded foothills and even up to the lowest altitudes of the nearby mountains. Fallow deer and red deer prevailed among the wild animals,294 while aurochs, roe deer, wild boar, bear, badger, wild cat, lynx, marten, and squirrel were regularly hunted and eaten; all these animals live near or in mixed woodland. This type of forest area seems to have been the natural habitat of lion,295 although it is unknown where, in the closer or further environment of Kastanas, lions found an adapted territory or at what distance from the settlement the inhabitants hunted them.296 If, from the earliest evidence on European soil, the lion has its widest distribution in the Holocene period, it was later to suffer a dramatic loss of territory.297 Lions would have been hunted and exterminated in the first millennium BC,298 although preserved in the north longer than in the south. Their extinction is due to man, not only through hunting, but through population growth, deforestation, use of new territories for the cultivation of plants and grazing, etc; their area shrank, their number diminished, and they progressively died out.299 Written Historical Evidence Homer's obvious biological knowledge about lions could have come from the Ionian- Aeolian area300oo and thus his evidence does not necessarily concern Greece.

BC), in Thrace. Pliny considers Greek lions much stronger than those in Africa and Syria, and Pausanias mentions that lions used to live in mountainous areas. There were thus lions in Greece till the historical periods,302 although the precise limits of their geographical territory are complicated. Until the reforms of Philip II, hunting was an essential form of livelihood in Macedonia: game of all sorts, including bear, boar, wild ox, and deer, was so abundant that lions, leopards, panthers, and lynxes preyed upon them.3o3 Herodotus mentions304 that lions from the mountains left their usual hunting territories and attacked Xerxes' camels while he was crossing the mainland3o5 from east to west, from Akanthos towards Thermi. Miiller argues that the largest part of Xerxes' army crossed Chalkidike taking the route south of the lakes Koroneia and Volvi, which are situated to the north of Vasilika, with a second section of the army crossing along the coast, and the last section possibly around Mt. Dysoron, to the north of the lakes.306 This mountain was heavily afforested in antiquity, infested with lions and wild oxen (a favourite prey of lions) with large horns, according to Herodotus."37 A testimony of the tenth century AD mentions oxen and deer in Mygdonia.3s8 Xenophon3o9 describes the hunting of lions, leopards, lynxes, panthers, and bears around the Pangaion mountain, the Kittos mountain 'inland of Macedonia', Olympus in Mysia, Pindos in Thessaly, and other areas such as Syria.'31 Hammond argues that Xenophon's Mt. Kittos was not Khortiatis near Thermi and the Vasilika valley, but 'Kitios' in the main Balkan chain.3" However, Mt. Khortiatis, 1201 m high,312 thickly wooded, was famous in antiquity for its forests and its game.3'3 Aristotle (Historia animalium), a century later than Herodotus, who confirmed the abundance of lions, notices their rarity.314 Pausanias'15 mentions lions in the second century AD, and he describes Polydamas (end of 5th c. BC) defeating a lion, as well as various other lion-hunts in the area of Mt. Olympus. Dio Chrysostom (AD 40-120o) affirms that in AD 68 there were no more lions in Europe,3'6 while Philostratus records their disappearance in Acarnania. Consequently, according to written evidence, the few lions existing in Aristotle's time were exterminated some time between his death and the first decades after Christ (c.300 BC-AD 1 oo), including in northern Greece,3'7 or during the first centuries AD.s'8 In 51 BC Cicero, the governor of Cilicia in Anatolia, captured panthers for Roman circuses in the Taurus mountain chain, where lions had also found refuge.

A topos in Greek and Roman literature, the lion symbolizes power, courage, heroism, and danger for man. Numerous representations of lions show that, in various periods and areas, the lion occupied a precise position in people's spiritual lives. Representations on cave walls of large felidae are attested since the Palaeolithic,32" although the felids represented are not always unquestionably lions.32 In fact, not only wild animals, but also hybrid figures (see below), such as the lioness's (?) head combined with a human body on an Aurignacian mammoth ivory statuette,323 are already present in the Palaeolithic. In tenth-ninth-millennium BC (PPNA-PPNB) Anatolia, the buildings in G-bekli Tepe (Urfa region) contained engraved, sculpted, or relief anthropo- or zoomorphic representations, the majority of which were lions, bears, bulls, gazelles, snakes, and other reptiles, as in the 'Lion Pillar Building',324 which dates from the latest phase of the site:325 the upper part of two pillars were adorned with lions in attacking position shown in low relief.326 Lions springing with open mouths, although without manes, were represented.327 A sculptured beast with open mouth (lion or bear) shows its teeth on a pillar fragment; a human head lies between the paws of an animal.321 Large-scale sculpture includes the head of a predatory beast and a human head in the clutches of a bird. Sculptured in high relief, wild animals could be interpreted as panthers or lions.329 Hunting and gathering provide the main subsistence means for the site, its location permitting access to large populations of a great variety of wild animals.33s Hunting weapons make up a high percentage of the finds.33' At Nevalih ori (9th mill. BC), lions, panthers, wild boars and horses, bears, and vultures are occasionally represented, often by heads only,332 along with snakes and predatory birds. Among these human and animal representations, outlining a symbolic world and defining man fighting against his environment, felids are quite striking.333 On the other hand, no panther or lion bones were found in Gbbekli Tepe, and one wonders if the inhabitants 319 X. de Planhol, 'Des forats et des fauves: la facade montagneuse m&amp;ridionale de l'Anatolie', Archiologia, 276 (September 2002), 6-9, esp. 8. 320 von den Driesch 1994, 20. 321 At least thirty-six specimens in the Chauvet Cave, about 14% of the animal figures: Bahn 1997, 153. 322 von den Driesch 1994, 11-12. 323 From Hohenstein Stadel, Germany, about 33.000 bp: Bahn 1997, 101 fig. 7. 21; Lorblanchet 1999, 257. 324 Liwenpfeilergebdude. 325 Schmidt 2000, 38. 326 Hauptmann 1999, ii. 51, fig. 24; Schmidt 1999, 11. 327 Ibid., 16, pls. 8. 2, 9. 1. 328 Schmidt 1997, 76-8 figs. 4-6; Hauptmann 1999, 79 fig. 25. 329 Ibid., figs. 27, 29, 31.

In the real world, such wild animals must have constituted part of man's hazardous environment in these parts of Anatolia. In the world of the imagination, these representations illustrate the ideas of maternity and control over felids, according to Cauvin.342 Wild animals (e.g. bear, snakes, birds, frog, hedgehog, turtle, deer, cat, boar, goat, and perhaps owl) and hybrids have exceptionally been identified in Neolithic and Chalcolithic figurines-which usually represent domestic animals-from Greece343 and the Balkans.344 Although the strong schematization of animal figures often renders precise identification of the species impossible or very difficult, this does not contradict the suggestion that big cats (lions?) may have been represented in the zoomorphic three-dimensional art of SE Europe. Willms345 discusses Neolithic and Eneolithic lion figurines from Bulgaria, from periods and sites which also yielded lions' bones. In particular, a figurine-vase from Goljamo Delkevo (horizon X) seems to have the typical characteristics and the posture of a recumbent lion.346 An atlas bone of Panthera leo L. also comes from early Eneolithic horizon II of this site. A fragmentary zoomorphic modelled figurine from Ploska Mogila shows347 in detail (paws) and general attitude the same animal species as the one from Goljamo Delievo, that is, a big cat, possibly a lioness, in a typical posture. The animal on the roof of the Slatino oven or house model (Late Eneolithic) would be a felid-a leopard, according to Nikolov348 and a cat would have been represented by a figurine from Paradeisos (where wild cat bones have been found), with upright ears, rounded at the top, eyes pierced horizontally through the face, with bosses (for whiskers?) both sides of the pinched nose, and by another one from OvEarovo, with encrusted shell eyes.349 An EN (Karanovo I) figurine fragment from SW Bulgaria (Elesnica, Blagoevgrad) could also represent a leopard or a lion.5so Makkay mentions 334 A. von den Driesch and J.

Numerous lion images come from the Bronze Age, among others at the monumental Lion Gate at Mycenae,356 as well as in more than 600 lion representations on seals or sealings,357 stelae, daggers, etc. in Minoan and Mycenaean art:358 lions being hunted, or lions attacking other animals, or lions controlled by humans are represented. Iconographical and mythological evidence from southern Greece, in particular the Peloponnese, includes Heracles' labour359 of the Nemean lion.360 Usener36' saw in the Mycenaean representations links with Egypt, because of their 'Cretan style' and the lion types. In the representations of lions in Greek art from the mid-eighth century BC he saw an orientalizing influence, the lion being the quarry of kings par excellence in the East. However, in spite of objections that representations of, and myths about, lions could have been imported into the Peloponnese,362 the archaeozoological evidence suggests first-hand knowledge of the animals.363 Moreover, Homer's descriptions apart,364 the frequently realistic rendering of certain details of lions in the Bronze Age iconography, and the natural posture of the body of lions attacking their prey, show detailed observation by the artists,365 and would suggest first-hand, direct encounter with lions in nature,366 not simply artistic tradition and copying. Therefore, iconographic evidence supports archaeozoological proof that lions not only existed, but were also still hunted in the Bronze Age in Greece.367 If the identification of the clay figurines from the Balkans as representing lions is correct, it is striking that neither on the complete Eneolithic figure from Goljamo Delcevo, nor on the Middle Chalcolithic zoomorphic lid from Tiszabura, is there any indication of a mane, and there is hardly one on the Endrod fragment. There was no mane either on the EBA stone carved axe of Sitagroi V.368 Perhaps it was female animals,369 with their superior hunting abilities, that were represented for preference, rather than males for all their strength and magnificence.37o Otherwise, we should presume that Neolithic/Chalcolithic 35' Ibid., 136 and nn. 6-7. 352 Ibid., figs. 1-3- 353 Ibid., figs. 4 and 6; but the identification of the latter, especially in fig. 6, as a lion, seems dubious. 354 Kathimerini Internet edition, October 2oo00, http/ /www.ekathimerini.com/news (accessed 20 Oct. 2001). a55 G.

By contrast, in fourth- millennium Mesopotamia, lions with manes are represented.372 Also in the Late Bronze Age, in addition to the numerous Mycenaean male lions, there are lionesses with manes.373 The Vasilika head may not represent a female animal, if the few incisions on the forehead and over the ears indicate an 'abbreviated' male's mane. Whatever the case may be, such ambiguities in representations of humans and animals are not a rarity in prehistoric art. 2. HYBRIDITY: CHERCHEZ LE MONSTRE Close connection between man and animal, attested since the Pleistocene, becomes obvious also in art. According to Lorblanchet,374 it is the dominance of the animal in the human world that is expressed in a combination of human and animal characteristics in ambiguous representations capable of interpretation both as animals and as human beings owing to the complete integration of the characteristics of both. Any sharp distinction between human and animal figures is then an illusion. In the Palaeolithic, the path from the 'animal' to the 'human' is marked by the 'animal.human', the 'anthropozoomorph',375 or the 'half- human', such as the bird-beaked 'dead man' of the Lascaux cave, the human/bison of Chauvet, the lion/human of Hdihenstein Stadel, or the human/reindeer/horse/feline 'Sorcerer' of Trois Freres, etc.376 Components belonging to different species are intimately combined, so that the figures become ambiguous or imaginary; indeed, the grouping may be so heterogeneous that identification is impossible, even though these composite images consist of parts of various identifiable animals.377 Hybrid human-animal representations in the tenth-ninth millennium BC, as at Gbbekli Tepe,"78 or creatures combining the attributes of man and bird at Nevall 9ori, may have had a particular meaning in cultic events, according to Hauptmann.379 Mixed creatures, besides implying combinations of two different beings (human-animal), or of animals of different species, are also attested in the Mesolithic, such as human/fish images from Lepenski Vir,3so as well as the Neolithic and Chalcolithic Balkans:38' some mixtures, or transitory representations with human and animal characteristics, are impossible to determine as either human or animal.38' In particular, several large terracotta heads of the Vinia culture already mentioned present human as well as animal (feline?) features. Furthermore, although some Neolithic vases bear realistic representations of a dog or a deer, a vase with a body shaped as a bull or a bird may be combined with a head with anthropomorphic features, or with the head of a doe. There are various other 371 von den Driesch 1994, 12; Bahn 1997, 153. 372 Limet 1993, 363. 373 Pini 1985, 164-5 n. 52 and 56. 374 Lorblanchet 1989, esp. 112, 124, 125- 375 Ibid., 140, 141 fig. 4. 20. 376 See descriptions e.g. ibid., 122; G.

One of the above-mentioned Jakovo- Kormadin heads cannot be identified with certainty as an animal head or bucranium; another could be an animal without horns or even a human.386 Furthermore, of two upper torsos on the roof of an early Eneolithic clay house(?) model from Vadastra (SW Romania, c.4500 BC), one has bull horns, the other cannot be identified and may also be human.387 Hbckmann388 correlates double beings with the 'paired-figure poles' having a human head and a more or less aniconic 'body' (Neolithic and Eneolithic). At 9atalhbytik, the link between women and leopards and between women and bucrania would show that the animals were attributes of the humans and thus that the latter were divinities.389 According to H6ckmann, representations of anthropo-zoomorphic beings played an important, possibly central role in Neolithic/Eneolithic cult.-9o For Renfrew, mythical39' or fantastic beasts must usually be considered as pertaining to the Other World, and therefore as indicating a cult image: composite animals exist in the mythology of many religions; they may have a decorative secular function, but when shown as subordinate to other beings in iconographic compositions, it is a plausible inference that the latter have divine status: cherchez le monstre could be a useful first step in order to identify cult practice.392 It has in fact been argued that the most important element in hybrid imagery is its dislocation from reality and that the production of a 'monstrous' image may indicate its removal from the material world and its attachment to the spirit world, where the boundaries of gender and species are irrelevant.393 Iconographic 'anarchy' seems to express 'otherness', in which order imposed by empirical observation of 'reality' is considered irrelevant to other states of being and to the supernatural world.394 A 'monster' figure may illustrate another reality from a different sphere which is not necessarily contradictory to our world, but parallel, as might happen with mythologies, dreaming, or altered states of consciousness, for example after drug use or meditation, dance, or ritual.g95 383 See e.g. Gimbutas 1984, figs. 69-70, i 1 1, 116-17; Marangou 2004, forthcoming; V.

The ambiguity and liminality-crossing the boundary between man and animal for example-in hybrid images may also reflect the contradictory nature of the human-animal relationship (i.e. animals dominated and revered at the same time).398 The Vasilika head might convey the impression that it represented a hybrid, a 'monster': its face, seen in full front, could seem human, were it not for the form of the muzzle which is particularly 'feline', rather lion-like, most obviously when seen in profile, with the bulging forehead, the incised 'mane', and the upright ears. The hybrid or lion thus represented is 'subordinate', in the sense that it was part of a structure. This zoomorphic structural element would indeed have been horizontal, possibly at the same or at a lower level than that of the spectators' eyes (note the almost unworked undersurface), and we cannot escape the suggestion of a similarity to the eastern, earlier, 'subordinate' felines, in particular those supporting the 9atalhayiik female figure, although in such cases it is not always clear who is 'subordinate' to whom. The animal itself represented here is obviously non-domestic and apparently local, but there are not enough similar representations399 in Greece to decide whether the apparent concept-that is, the idea of representing a wild animal, or a hybrid figure, with power to transfix, on a large scale as a functional part of a structure-is indigenous or an import, in particular a copy from the East.400 But even if an import from the East, its meaning and function might well have changed in a geographically, culturally, and temporally different context. The fact nevertheless remains that vital significance was apparently conferred on the wild animal represented or on the idea that it symbolized in material form. 396 D. Kloosterboer, 'Monstrous art', Anthropozoologica, 22 (1996), 23-8, esp. 25-6. 397 Green (n. 393), 909. 398 Ibid. 399 Bucrania are also extremely rare in Greece, according to the evidence available up to now (see above). 400 If there had been such an oriental influence, the obvious question is why there was such a delay in adopting eastern customs and beliefs in northern Greece? The most striking artefactual analogies between EN Greece and the East concern objects that required special care in manufacture (seals, earstuds, stone vessels), probably related to symbolic functions or status, as though symbolic artefacts or symbolically loaded techniques remained more strongly linked to earlier traditions (Perlis 2001, 63): analogies point alternatively to the Levant, Anatolia, or the Jordan valley, the valley of the Taurus or the Euphrates (ibid., 54)- She thinks (ibid., 96) that the first farmers who came to Greece may have belonged to a late phase of PPNB, that the first pioneer groups constisted of individuals continuing the PPNB great exodus and following different pathways up to Greece, each retaining only some of their most valuable symbols and techniques. This would explain the selectivity and heterogeneity of the parallels, and the hypothesis of maritime displacements could be retained (ibid., 62), in particular because of the absence of EN in central and eastern Macedonia (ibid., 1 18). Given the exogenous origin of domestic species in Greece, she considers an opposition of wild and domesticated reinforced by an opposition of local and non-local (ibid., 172). This is not the place to discuss the issue thoroughly, but see objections by K. Kotsakis, 'Catherine Perlis, The Early Neolithic in Greece', EJA5- 3 (2002), 373-7, who considers that the autochthonous inhabitants had a much stronger influence on the Greek Neolithic.</page><page sequence="35">'MONUMENTALITY', FUNCTIONALITY, ANIMALITY 35 VI. FEAR, LORE, SOLEMNITY, AND ZOOMORPHIC MATERIALIZED SYMBOLS 1. EMOTION AND KNOWLEDGE STORED AND TRANSMITTED Parts of animal bodies were intentionally placed in graves, presumably for symbolic purposes, by the first modern humans and perhaps the late Neanderthals (100,000- 60,000 bp). After 40,000 bp, images of anthropomorphic beings and body ornaments may represent symbolic relationships with the natural world, the first art already containing images of likely supernatural beings, such as the man/lion from Hohenstein Stadel.4o0 For a long time, man perceived himself as an animal; at some time, a crisis in his development resulted in the creation of a break between man and animal. This led (according to Boccara) mythic reason to face the problem of expression (the exteriorization of human thought) and to invent, with domestication of animals, and later, with writing, logical reason.402 Clearer details of animal symbols and cult practices emerge chiefly during the Neolithic period.4"s It has been argued that the Neolithic revolution was a mental mutation.404 New behaviours reflect particular disruptions in man's system of representing reality, perceptible in both art and ritual: Cauvin405 argued that this cognitive aspect of the revolution of symbols is fundamental, regularizing 'man's general theory about the world and consequently his own role in it: it is as if "religion" had developed first at a not directly utilitarian level, but as a "transcendental logic" that was later applied to reality, giving it new meanings in a renovated system of relationships'. PPNA symbolism varies at different sites; at Mureybet, it focuses on women and bulls, atJerf-el-Ahmar, on animals-preferably predatory or dangerous4o6-including felids, all of them 'frightening' or at least 'fascinating', with a spectacular evolution in the early Anatolian PPNB.4o7 Suffering, danger, fear, and death, personified by beasts, are present among the attributes of the female figure in the Neolithic East; felids, probably leopards, vultures, and other animals dangerous to man are her immediate followers; at 9atalhdyiik, wild animal jaws, boar tusks, or vultures' beaks are hidden in clay 'breasts' protruding from the walls.408 Women are associated with the wild and with danger, as much as with controlling it,409 at Qatalhbyiik, where the symbolic importance of animals, especially bovids (although sheep bones are the commonest), is obvious.410 According to Hodder, in the Early Neolithic, many aspects of the wild were brought into the house, as in the buildings and on the walls of Qatalh6yiik, where animal death is linked to human death, 'male' dangers to 'female' dangers. The juxtaposition-linking of two or more aspects of the agrios in the house-enhances the prestige of the social and cultural order which confronts and controls the agrios. The domestication metaphor would be the main mechanism for social control.4" 401 Mithen 1998, 99. 402 M.

He also maintained that systems of animal classification are not derived from social categories, but rather that categories taken from a system of classification of nature are used to express the nature of relations between human groups and individuals. In modem times4'6 animals, or rather cultural constructs of them, are used as metaphors in two different ways: some are idealized and treated as agents and social beings, used as models of order and morality, in animal stories and myths; other animals are sometimes represented as the Other, the Beast, the Brute, the model of disorder, or the way things should not be done. Animals are good to teach and learn with, particularly in those central areas of life affected by taboos and inhibitions.4'7 According to Mithen, the cognitive origin of religious (his term) ideas and concepts concerning supernatural beings is a manifestation of a transformation of human cognition (100,000-30,000 years ago). At that time new ideas arose by combining knowledge which had previously been domain-specific.4'8 The concept of supernatural beings brings together ideas that reside in contexts of 'physical objects', 'humans', 'society', 'nature', associating together material or abstract entities (symbolism). Supernatural beings possess features which cross-cut the 'natural' categories of entities in the world (a supernatural being may be able to transform itself into many different species). This transition from a domain- specific to a 'cognitively fluid' mentality occurred by bringing together knowledge and thought about the social and natural worlds, as in the assumed evidence for totemism and anthropomorphic thinking among the earliest modern humans (100,000 years ago). Later on, the integration of technical knowledge into the incipient cognitively fluid mind (60,ooo- 30,000 years ago) enabled religious ideas to be represented in material form (e.g. lion- man figurine). In Mithen's view, religious ideas arising from the cognitively fluid mind are such as to contradict our modern, apparently intuitive understanding of the world (of physics, biology, and psychology), e.g. believing that inanimate objects may have beliefs and desires, or that humans could once transform themselves into animals. Such violations of our (modern) intuitive understanding of the world are essential to the cultural transmission of religious ideas so as to make them attention-grabbing: they are 'something different, something special, something to be treated with reverence'.4'9 Such violations also make these ideas difficult to understand and to transmit, as they are susceptible to corruption and dissipation during cultural transmission, the latter often 412 Yet the significance of man-animal relationship in various contexts concerning animal hide dress (such as Hercules' lionskin) does not refer necessarily to totemism: D.

To have survival value (to 'anchor' in the human mind) during the process of transmission, religious ideas need to conform to some aspects of our intuitive knowledge of the world. If Palaeolithic man/animal figures indeed represent supernatural beings, they apparently violate our (modern) intuitive knowledge because they are composed of different species, but, in order to have survived, these beings must also have had conformities, e.g. shared features with normal humans. Furthermore,420 religious ideas gain survival value if represented in material form, as they become easier to communicate and comprehend. Material symbols are used for 'external symbolic storage' of ideas.421 Mithen's 'cognitive' approach to the external storage and transmission of ideas is complemented by Mundkur's thesis that emotion and mental imageries motivated early human societies to respond to environmentally generated stimuli through symbolic art:42 animals from time immemorial have given shape to myth, ritual, and the symbolic imagery of cults.423 Through myth, man goes back in time and restores continuity with the animal world from which he comes, and becomes a man-animal.424 Nevertheless, while several species are important in myth and ritual, some particular species would have induced hallucinatory imageries, and intrinsically religious sentiments, while only a few inspired art motifs, and the remainder were ignored for no obvious reason.425 Indeed, the choice of a particular animal to symbolize a deep emotional response must be due to the type of livelihood, and the composition of the local fauna.4'6 For example, the abundance of animals around Pleistocene man's shelters seems to have caused him anxiety, which may explain why Palaeolithic art is mostly zoomorphic; this art, with its naturalistic animal species and imaginary animal hybrids, particularly the zooanthropomorphs, is considered apotropaic or hallucinatory, with its ritual overtones or semiological ambiguities.427 Wild animals disconcert the mind, as is apparent from the imaginary qualities attributed to them in myths and symbols and originating from intrinsic religiosity (which is a part of human animality), according to Mundkur's definition:428 'a state of mind incited by belief in forces perceived as supernatural and numinous that must be appraised, ... an innate urge embedded in fear'. Fear and anxiety were--besides sexuality and aggression-the most primordial, as well as constant, factors in human evolution.429 Man's animal nature comprises both ecological (i.e. having a mutual relationship with its environment) and intuitive (i.e. cognitive) sensitivities.430 The strong but transient fears of humans in the face of the natural world are firmly embedded in our unconsciousness-realistic dangers such as the edge of a cliff, darkness, lonely places, thunderclaps, or certain animals. Experimental psychology recognizes anxiety (the persistent or recurrent apprehension of realistic or imaginary things),43' to transfer one's susceptibility to one specific stimulus, to other, quite unrelated, even imaginary, stimuli, through the use of animals as objects of fear: urban schoolchildren 420 Ibid., 103-4. 421 Ibid., 97. 422 Mundkur 1988, 175. 423 Ibid., 141-2. 424 Boccara (n. 402), 29. 425 Mundkur 1988, 146, 167. 426 Ibid., 177. 427 Ibid., 175. But all symbols are secondary developments loaded with obscure, highly variable sociocultural impetuses; interpretations of their meanings are often conjectural (ibid., 175)- 428 Ibid., 178. 429 Ibid., 174- 430 Ibid., 141-2. 431 Ibid., 148.</page><page sequence="38">38 CHRISTINA MARANGOU AND DIMITRIS GRAMMENOS today fear wild animals, such as snakes, lions, tigers, and bears, while there are high percentages of animal images among apprehensive dreams.432 Animals appear in mental imageries, by simile, metaphor, and reification through a range of emotional urges.433 Innate hominid cognitive faculties and psychic tensions are transformed into reverential fears, i.e. into an awe of animals and incipient rituals, according to Mundkur: cult practices are merely outlets for fear and the anxiety drive.434 Moreover, there is a continuum of belief from the physical to the non-physical. Recurrent features of religions include, according to Mithen,435 a belief in non-physical beings; that a non-physical component of a person may survive after death; that certain people within a society are likely to receive direct inspiration or messages from supernatural agencies; that performing certain rituals in an exact way can bring about change in the natural world; and the use of material symbols. 2. FEARSOME ANIMALS, ANIMALS 'GOOD TO THINK WITH' IN THE NEOLITHIC The reasons for choosing large-size representations, in particular clay heads or bucrania in addition to standard figurines (which may co-exist) in the Neolithic period are not clear. As a matter of fact, there is a remarkable contrast between these rare436 'solemn' figures and standard-size figurines, which usually represented normal humans and domestic437 animals and which were moved around during their life-cycle, accompanying everyday household activities and life, as it is attested by their find contexts.438 As we have seen, exceptionally large iconic representations of wild fauna and possibly hybrids, of striking appearance, are encountered in connection with communal as well as domestic buildings in certain phases and areas, the reasons for this selectivity remaining unknown. They have been chiefly found inside buildings,439 though occasionally in separated areas of restricted access, and were frequently linked to architectural elements. Large heads or animal skulls were fixed not only on post- or pillar-like structures located in delimited spaces, but also on walls, entrance or passage door-posts, partitions, over hearths or ovens or close to them, therefore possibly suggesting liminality in addition to solemnity. Special buildings (mostly in SE Anatolia and northern Syria) or parts of buildings (central Anatolia and SE Europe) may in fact have been used for ceremonial meetings, involving monumental figures and structures with figurative elements. If everyday ritual and magic was linked to domestic activities,440 processes referring to themes represented by large figures may have been distinct and rarer, probably taking 432 Ibid., 153, 157, 159, 161. 433 Ibid., 174. 434 Ibid., 153, 164. 435 Mithen 1998, 98. 436 Unless more large-size figures had been made in non-preserved materials, such as wood or unbaked clay. 437 Although wild animals are rarely represented, exceptionally, there are a remarkable number of them in some sites, in particular Dikili Tash: Marangou forthcoming and material under study from the same site. 438 Marangou 1992, passim; 1996; cf. Hauptmann 1999, 77. Standard figurines and models from Greece are only exceptionally related to death (tombs or cemeteries), and then are mostly found outside graves (FN) or in incineration areas (EN), not in the interior of graves or funerary vases: Marangou 1992, 228-9. 439 In Neolithic domestic contexts, redundant figurative symbols may also occur on tools or vessels: Marangou 2oo4. 440 Ead., 'Sacred or secular places and the ambiguous evidence of prehistoric rituals', in P. Biehl and F. Bertemes with H.

Such ceremonies may have involved, not only one or a few households, but a larger social group or category of individuals. Large animal or hybrid heads may have served cognitive schemes, or materialized emotions, or both, and therefore taken part in their transmission, although more archaeological evidence is needed to corroborate these hypotheses. Tentative suggestions for such procedures include initiation, transmission of lore, cult, or magic rituals. Any of these are likely to account for one at least of the more obvious objectives of such representations, namely to captivate or to induce fear, and eventually to control. Important social activities, including group decision-making, may have been related to a form of conduct or sanction, laid down in village lore, which was reflected in social groupings and kinship structure, according to Chapman.44' During group meetings, some influential individuals with special powers or abilities who were distinguished within the group, as possessing, controlling, and potentially transmitting knowledge, as well as possibly having the power of mediating between humans and other transcendental entities (the 'Other World' in Renfrew's terminology), would thus be able to assure order and the groups' cohesion. Such a process of transmistting lore or mediating between humans and the 'Other World', in short, of exerting influence, would make use of manipulation, surprise, the creation of emotion, and the inducement of fascination and awe. In Neolithic Greece, society relied on a broad range of economic, social, and ritual functions, each requiring specialist roles to be fulfilled by different individuals and groups; ritual thus implied ritual specialists.442 The Vasilika head, in spite of the lack of original contextual information, must have had an exceptional impact. Its striking appearance as an awesome wild animal or hybrid, its large size, its function as an impressive and transfixing component of an unknown, but unusual structure, and its possible location approximately at a level with the spectator's gaze would have made it surprising, captivating, and attention-focusing, whatever space it was located in! In particular, the effect of seeing its eyes443 in their original state, most likely in a colour contrasting with that of the face, would have been quite striking. The sight of such an exceptional head, especially if it were revealed unexpectedly, presumably during the solemn performance of some ritual, upon or after entering into a delimited space, or at the entrance to such a space, would have been disquieting, important, and powerful. This would especially have been the case in areas where dangerous wild fauna were feared and revered-this must explain the preference for such representations in particular geographic zones-and in a period when man's imaginary world had mutated, with the invention of Neolithic symbols. In this article, we have seen that it is mostly eastern miniatures (figurines and models), in addition to wall reliefs, that illustrate examples of 'association of ideas':444 that is, a combination of anthropomorphic figures (humans?) with zoomorphic figures (animals?), 441 Chapman 1981, 75; cf. ibid., 83, on VinEa society, where 'social ranking is not attested outside the context of ritual'. 442 Renfrew 1985 ('Other World'); Perlks 200o, 298 (EN); Marangou 1992, 221, 230 ('connoisseurs' and 'guardians' of Neolithic miniatures). 443 In Mari (beginning of 2nd mill. BC), bronze lions with enormous stone eyes kept the entrance to the Dagan temple; lions in several cases guarded entrances to sanctuaries: Cassin 1987, 184 n. 80, with references. 444 Cauvin 1997, 51.</page><page sequence="40">40 CHRISTINA MARANGOU AND DIMITRIS GRAMMENOS in particular wild beasts, as well as with structures,445 including elaborate zoomorphic seats, or animals used as seats. In relation to the Vasilika find, it is not only the question of the origin of this unique-according to present available evidence-theme in Greece that remains open, but also the intriguing issue of the reconstruction of the missing structure (seat, door frame, screen, or other structural element) and indeed of the presumably missing related being(s). We might assume that such an iconic representation was the symbol of an amazing creature, which if it was not 'subordinate', was at any rate somehow related to one or more high-ranking entities. But we may only speculate whether it was a real human being(s) of exceptional or perhaps ritual status, or a mental image(s) of some mythological scenario or collective fantasy that would have been connected to the structure with the zoomorphic head component. As yet we do not know if it (they) belonged to the invented or to the real world of the Neolithic social group whose members conceived, manufactured and used the clay figure.
