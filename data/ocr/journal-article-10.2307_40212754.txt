Astronaut's Organ Doses Inferred from Measurements in a Human Phantom Outside the International Space Station. Radiat. Res. 171, 225-235 (2009). Space radiation hazards are recognized as a key concern for human space flight. For long-term interplanetary missions, they constitute a potentially limiting factor since current pro- tection limits for low-Earth orbit missions may be approached or even exceeded. In such a situation, an accurate risk assess- ment requires knowledge of equivalent doses in critical radio- sensitive organs rather than only skin doses or ambient doses from area monitoring. To achieve this, the MATROSHKA experiment uses a human phantom torso equipped with ded- icated detector systems. We measured for the first time the doses from the diverse components of ionizing space radiation at the surface and at different locations inside the phantom positioned outside the International Space Station, thereby simulating an extravehicular activity of an astronaut. The re- lationships between the skin and organ absorbed doses ob- tained in such an exposure show a steep gradient between the doses in the uppermost layer of the skin and the deep organs with a ratio close to 20. This decrease due to the body self- shielding and a concomitant increase of the radiation quality factor by 1.7 highlight the complexities of an adequate dosim- etry of space radiation. The depth-dose distributions estab- lished by MATROSHKA serve as benchmarks for space ra- diation models and radiation transport calculations that are needed for mission planning. © 2009 by Radiation Research Society INTRODUCTION "The galactic cosmic ray (GCR) environment is the most complicated mixture of radiation known. It is doubtful that the GCR environment will ever be adequately simulated in the laboratory for biological experiments" (7). Though not precisely matching the complexities of research on its ra- diobiological effects, the intricacies of establishing an ad- equate, biologically weighted and workable dosimetry for this radiation field remains a challenging task. The dosi- metric measurements of an exposure in the low-Earth orbit (LEO) of the International Space Station (ISS) as described here constitute another step toward this end. In addition to malfunctions of propulsion, navigation and life support systems, the safety of human space crews is vitiated mostly by three major human factors: health det- riments from ionizing space radiation, progressive loss of resilience due to bone demineralization, and adverse psy- chosocial reactions due to prolonged confinement and the "Earth-out-of-view" syndrome (2-5). Assessment of radi- ation risks requires adequate knowledge of the radiation environment and the doses deposited in the body. The ra- diation environment in the Space Station orbit is deter- mined by three primary sources: the galactic cosmic radi- ation (GCR), the solar particle radiation (SPR), and the charged particles trapped in the Earth's magnetic field (Van Allen Belts) (6). The first source comprises protons and heavier particles and electrons of all energies that impinge from all directions on the solar system. Regarding SPR, 1 Address for correspondence: German Aerospace Center (DLR), In- stitute of Aerospace Medicine, Radiation Biology, Linder Hoehe, 51147 Cologne, Germany; e-mail: guenther.reitz@dlr.de. 225</page><page sequence="2">226 REITZ ETAL only particles in energetic solar particle events (SPEs), such as coronal mass ejections (CMEs), have sufficient energies to contribute directly to radiation exposures. These particles are mainly protons and electrons and varying, but usually small, amounts of heavier ions. The third source is com- posed of protons and electrons that are produced mainly by interactions of the first two sources with the Earth's atmo- sphere and are trapped by its magnetic field. In addition to its variation with location, the intensity and composition of the total radiation environment is subject to slow temporal variations due to oscillations of the solar activity in an ap- proximately 11 -year cycle and to impulsive disturbances caused by SPEs that may last for several days. As the spacecraft passes through this complex and variable exter- nal radiation field, the field inside the spacecraft and an astronaut's body is made even more complex by the inter- actions of the primary particles with the structural materials and finally with the body itself. At sea level on Earth, the exposure to cosmic radiation is reduced to about 0.3 mSv/year due to the atmospheric shielding of approximately 1000 g/cm2. In contrast, a typ- ical spacecraft provides only an average shielding of the order of 20 g/cm2, and a space suit for extravehicular ac- tivity with less than 0.5 g/cm2 gives even less shielding. Most of the primary particles can easily penetrate the spacecraft walls, causing (during quiet solar times) an ex- posure of up to 1 mSv/day compared to an average total exposure from natural sources on Earth of about 2.4 mSv/ year (7). Some of the more intense and energetic SPEs can increase exposures by more than several 100 mSv within a few days. Hence increased radiation risks ensue for cancer as the critical late effect and even for early radiation se- quelae. The orbit of the ISS is well enough shielded by the geomagnetic field that the probability for acute radiation effects - even during intense SPEs - is nearly absent, al- though, as a precaution, the astronauts remain in more heavily shielded parts of the ISS in the case of an intense SPE. Thus radiation protection for near-Earth orbits mostly deals with late stochastic effects, represented by genetic effects and the risk of cancer induction. Assessment of risks by means of personal dosimeters can lead to overestimates when the substantial uncertainties as- sociated with the computational extrapolation of skin doses to the sensitive organs are accounted for properly, i.e., in a worst-case approach. When anticipated exposures, e.g. in long-term missions, can approach protection limits (see Table 1), such overes- timates can lead to counterproductive restrictions in terms of overall safety by enforcing excessive shielding masses. Measurements using anthropomorphic phantoms represent the best tool to provide more reliable data for risk estimates and to benchmark computational radiation transport models in the radiation field of interest. To meet as closely as pos- sible the goal of determining the doses to critical organs by measuring the depth-dose distribution inside a human phantom, considerable care must be taken in the selection TABLE 1 Ten- Year Career Dose Limits for Astronauts (8) Effective dose, E (Sv) Age at exposure (years) Female Male 25 0.4 0.7 35 0.6 1.0 45 0.9 1.5 55 1.7 3.0 and placement of the phantom's structural materials and of the detectors themselves to minimize deviations from the necessary equivalence to actual human tissue. Some mea- surements exist from the exposure of a phantom head and later on a human phantom in a shuttle flight (9-11). Some results from the same phantom exposed on the ISS have been published (72), although they do not comprise esti- mates of a three-dimensional distribution throughout the phantom. The European Space Agency (ESA) facility MA- TROSHKA houses the first phantom experiment with ex- posure outside the ISS, simulating an astronaut performing extravehicular activity. The exposure conditions are mark- edly different from those inside the spacecraft, the walls of which absorb the trapped electrons, whereas the space suit is too thin to do so. The result is a very steep decrease in the exposure from the skin to the deeper organs. MATERIALS AND METHODS Dosimetric Concepts The complexity of the space radiation environment necessitates expo- sition of the dosimetric concepts employed. No real physical measure- ment system is able to measure the dosimetric quantities as they are defined for radiation protection since the energy deposited by this radi- ation depends on the actual atomic composition of the irradiated material. Any material other than biological tissue will yield a more or less ac- ceptable approximation to the real radiation dose to an organ. The ratio- nale for and the details of the procedures recommended as the standard procedure for personal dosimetry of astronauts are described in NCRP Report 142 (13). To appraise so-called stochastic effects (fatal and non-fatal cancer, he- reditary effects etc.), the conceptual framework of radiological protection uses effective dose, E (SI unit sievert, 1 Sv = 1 J/kg), as the primary measure of risk for health detriment from ionizing radiation (13). The effective dose E is the sum of the equivalent doses, HT (Sv), in all the tissues and organs, T, of concern, weighted by a factor wT that represents the relative contribution of the organ or tissue T to the total detriment. E = 2 WtHt. (1) T Tissue-equivalent doses Hr in turn are obtained as weighted sums of the contributions of all radiation components, /?, to the (physical) absorbed doses, DTR (SI unit gray; 1 Gy = 1 J/kg), averaged over an organ. The dimensionless radiation weighting factors, wR, account for the different biological effectiveness of the different contributing radiation compo- nents, /?, to HT\ HT=1 Y&gt;KDTJt. (2) R The determination of the equivalent dose HT according to this definition requires the designation of wR for every component R present. The char-</page><page sequence="3">ASTRONAUT'S ORGAN DOSES FROM EVA EXPOSURES IN LEO 227 acterization of the space radiation field in the introductory statement pro- hibits the use of such an approach, unless one is prepared to accept the burden associated with the overestimation of HT that arises from adopting the "default" International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) value of wR = 20 for all ions heavier than protons. Instead, the operational quantity dose equivalent to an organ (designated by the same symbol, HT, and measured in the same unit, Sv) may be applied. Here the discrete weighting factor wR is replaced by a continuous function of the (unrestricted) linear energy transfer, LET (=LET3C), of a radiation component, i.e. the quality factor, Q(L), defined in ref. (14): HT = Q(L) dDT(L), (3) Jl where dD^L) is the contribution to the absorbed dose from a radiation component with an LET between L and L + dL. Given the differential particle fluence in LET, O(L), then dDT(L) = f X L®(L) dL, (4) with a suitable conversion factor/ Finally, for operational applications, a dimensionless mean quality fac- tor, (Q), can be applied instead that if multiplied with the organ absorbed dose, DT, yields the organ dose equivalent quantity HT = (QT)DT, (5) with (Qt) = Q(Q dDT(L)/DT and (6) Dr = dDT(L). (7) Jl To the extent that, due to the body's self shielding, the dose distribution in LET, dDj(L), does vary in different tissues, the mean quality factor (Qt) wiU also be dependent on T. Any experimental determination according to Eq. (7) or (3) of absorbed dose DT or of dose equivalent HT has to deal with the fact that no single physical detection device can cover the complete gamut of interactions and the associated LET range that characterize the space radiation field. These equations, however, admit a convenient separation of contributions to absorbed dose or dose equivalent from two (or even more) different ranges of the LET distribution of the space radiation field, i.e., DT = dDT(L) + dDr(L) = D1T + D2T or (8) JU JL2 HT = Q(L) dDT(L) + Q(L) dDT(L) = H1T + H2T, (9) JLI Jl.2 where LI and L2 denote a disjunctive decomposition of the total LET range. Detector Systems Plastic nuclear track detectors are used to establish 3&gt;(L) for the directly and densely ionizing radiation components (75). Such heavy charged par- ticles induce latent tracks when traversing dielectric materials such as plastic sheets. After etching in caustic solution, these latent tracks develop into microscopically measurable etch cones due to an increased etch ve- locity, v,, along the particle's trajectory compared to the normal etch velocity, vB, of the undisturbed bulk detector material. The relative track etch velocity, s = vJvB, is related to the cone angle, 0, as vJvB = 1/sin 6. The LET of the crossing particle is obtained from the cone angle by an empirical calibration function with respect to the reduced track etch velocity or etch rate ratio, s-1, which is established from exposures to heavy ions of known LET at accelerators, also taking into account the long-term fading properties of the material (76). Among passive solid-state nuclear track detectors (SSNTD), plastic nuclear track detectors such as polyallyl diglycol carbonate (PADC) are optimal for this task. These detectors, which are commonly referred to in the (space) radiation protection community by the trade name, CR-39 detectors, are able to cover the entire relevant high-LET range above 10 keV/|jLm. By means of the differential LET spectra, &lt;£(L), as measured in the plastic detectors the distribution of the physical dose and the dose equivalent in LET, the dose and dose equivalent spectra, can be deter- mined from such plastic detectors. The efficiency of these plastic detectors to record the sparsely ionizing low-LET component starts to drop below an LET of ^10 keV/|xm. Here passive thermoluminescence detectors (TLDs, miniature LiF:Mg,Ti and LiF:Mg,Cu,P sintered chips or pellets, about 4 mm in diameter and less than 1 mm thick) can be employed; their efficiency is approximately equal to 1 in this region. TLD crystals accumulate energy deposited by ionizing radiation in interstitial energy levels. Upon heating, the stored energy is released as light emitted by the crystals whose intensity is proportional to the absorbed dose (77). TLDs were calibrated in terms of absorbed dose to water in a cesium- 137 or cobalt-60 reference radiation field r; i.e., the TLD signal S after exposure to an absorbed dose Dr is S = DjKr, which allows the determination of the calibration factor, Kr, for such a calibration field (in what follows, explicit reference to r will be dropped). TLD crystals respond with decreasing efficiency to absorbed dose at higher LET values. Therefore, their response, y\(L), relative to the refer- ence radiation has to be established as a function of LET. Then the total TLD signal, SD, from a given exposure D covering a large LET range can be decomposed into SD =\\ i)(L) dD(L) + ti(L) dD(L) k = SI + 52. (10) [Ju Jl2 I If an LET range LI can be selected so that y\(L) « 1 for L in LI, then the total "raw" TLD signal is SD = DIIk + 52, where D\ = dD(L) = kSd - kS2 = kSd - D2' (11) JLI is the absorbed dose received by the TLD in the LET range LI and D2' = ti(L) dD(L) (12) JL2 is the TLD weighted absorbed dose received in the LET range L2. Fur- thermore, if LI can be selected so that also Q(L) = 1 for L in LI, then the total dose equivalent is obtained as H = HI + H2 = 1 X Dl + Q(L) dDT(L). (13) Ju For the presently adopted Q(L) function as defined by the ICRP in ref. (14), the LET interval LI = [0,10] keV/(xm-H2O meets both the require- ments j\(L) « 1 and Q(L) = 1 for L in LI. Since in the LET interval L2 = [10,oc] keV/jxm-H2O a detection efficiency of approximately 1 can be achieved for particle tracks in the chosen CR-39 plastic detectors, the contributions H2 and D2 in Eqs. (8) and (9) can be determined from the differential particle fluence in LET, 4&gt;(L), according to Eq. (4). For the determination of Dl by Eq. (11), we can determine a contribution D2" given by DT = f X T|(L)LcD(L) dL (14) JL2 D2" is the absorbed dose deposited in the LET range L2 by interactions in the CR-39 detector material, weighted by the TLD response functions T\(L). Strictly, such interactions depend on the actual atomic composition of the detector material. In particular, the energy levels and respective volume densities of the electrons determine the energy transferred to the material by Coulomb interactions.

(Picture courtesy of DLR) a charged particle's path, this electronic contribution dominates the LET contribution. For interactions with the nuclei, their atomic weight also influences the dose contribution from such interactions. The TLD detec- tors as well as the plastic nuclear track detectors have found widespread use in radiation protection dosimetry since in both aspects they approx- imate biological tissue with sufficient accuracy. Being also closely similar to each other, we can approximate D2' by D2" so that all contributions in Eqs. (8) and (9) (resp. 13) are now quantified. Uncertainty of the absorbed dose as measured in TLD detectors arises essentially from the fluctuation of the sensitivity k among the individual TLD chips. Therefore, the sensitivity k was established individually for each chip. Since the calibrating doses, Dr, in the reference field were deposited from sources that are traceable to national standard laboratories, their uncertainties are negligible. The remaining uncertainties arising from the noise in the generation and processing of the TLD signal S were estimated from the standard deviation of repetitive exposures. The un- certainty of the doses D2 determined in the plastic detectors is dominated by the counting statistics of particle tracks, i.e., by Poisson statistics. From the associated standard deviation, the estimates for the uncertainties quoted for D2 were derived. Depth- Dose Distribution The depth-dose distribution inside the phantom that is reported here was determined using thermoluminescence dosimeter (TLD) measure- ments exclusively. Since different laboratories used different TLD ma- terials, their properties were studied in several intercalibration campaigns at heavy-ion accelerator facilities around the world (e.g. HIMAC, Chiba, Japan; NSRL, Brookhaven, NY; Loma Linda, CA) mostly in the frame- work of the ICCHIBAN (18-21) and other research projects of the par- ticipating partners (22). This allowed the merging of all TLD data for the phantom into one single depth-dose distribution. 3D Depth-Dose Model A numerical voxel model was created from X-ray CT scans of the slices of the phantom and the map of critical organs [Zubal phantom (25)], scaled to the masses of the ICRP reference man (24). With a res- olution of 5 mm in the body axis and 1 mm in the perpendicular planes, each of these volume elements can be assigned to one of the organs or body structures. The experimental point dose rates within MATROSHKA (measured with TLDs in a 2.5-cm grid) were interpolated in 3D to match the resolution of the voxel model by the inverse distance weighting meth- od (25). The steep dose-rate gradient between the phantom's "skin" and the nearest body TLDs required a different interpolation method. Here an exponential attenuation function was adopted whose slope parameter was determined from measurements in a separate dedicated TLD stack. The MATROSHKA Facility: Instrumentation And Timeline The phantom inside MATROSHKA (26) is an anthropomorphic upper torso made of tissue-equivalent polyurethane that comprises a human skeleton (RANDO®, The Phantom Laboratory, Salem, NY) (see Fig. 1A-D). It is cut into 33 slices, each 25 mm thick. The base structure houses the electronics for data acquisition and transmission of the internal temperature and pressure as well as the data from the active radiation detector sensors. A carbon fiber container with an average mass shielding of -0.5 g/cm2 simulates the shielding distribution of an astronaut's EVA suit. The phantom torso (see Fig. 2) is equipped with 4,800 TLDs distrib- uted in 354 polyethylene tubes in the 33 slices, enabling determination of the absorbed dose and depth-dose distribution at over 1600 measure- ment points in a 2.5 cm xlylz grid. Combinations of TLDs and plastic nuclear track detectors assembled in polyethylene boxes (60 X 40 X 25 mm) are placed at selected organ locations (eye, lung, stomach, kidney and intestine) as well as in a NO-</page><page sequence="5">ASTRONAUT'S ORGAN DOSES FROM EVA EXPOSURES IN LEO 229 FIG. 2.

The white cable connects to a temperature sensor in the head of the phantom. Near the periphery, the outline of the skull can be seen. The picture was taken during detector integration prior to the launch of the facility. (Picture courtesy of DLR) MEX® travel jacket ("Poncho"). For the determination of the skin dose, detectors are sewn into polyethylene strips directly on the surface, thereby measuring average dose at a depth of 0.6 mm. Seven active radiation detectors monitored the instantaneous dose rate. Five scintillation detec- tors (SSD) were installed at the positions of the above-mentioned organs to monitor the interior heavy-ion and neutron components. A silicon tele- scope (DOSTEL) on top of the phantom head and a tissue-equivalent proportional counter (TEPC) in front of the torso monitored its ambient exposure rate. For comparison with dose rates inside the ISS, additional detector packages were stored at several reference locations. The MA- TROSHKA facility was launched in January 2004 with a Russian Pro- gress cargo supply spacecraft from the spaceport of Baikonur and mount- ed in a fixed orientation outside the Zvezda module on February 26, 2004 (see Fig. 3). During the subsequent measurement period of 539 days, data from active radiation detectors were stored on memory cards or transmitted directly to ground via U.S. voice link. After exposure, the facility was transferred to the inside of the ISS; the passive detector systems were removed and sent back to Earth via Soyuz on October 1 1, 2005. Detectors were distributed to all the participating laboratories for processing and evaluation.

(Picture courtesy of NASA) terials employed and the determination of the LET calibra- tion functions for the CR-39 plastic detectors were an es- sential part of the joint international intercalibration cam- paigns. The efficiency r\(L) for ions and energies encountered in the space radiation environment was established by expo- sures at various heavy-ion accelerators. For one of the most frequently used TLD materials, LiF:Mg (Ti, Harshaw TLD 700), the dependence of -x\(L) on the ions' LET is shown in Fig. 4. As is known theoretically (27, 28) and reflected in these data, i)(L) is not a unique function of the LET. For practical purposes, however, a single fit function can be established that yields the TLD response in an acceptable approximation. More experimental and theoretical details can be found in refs. (18-22). The calibration function for the CR-39 plastic detectors has been established for representative ions and energies in the same accelerators exposures. Figure 5 displays the de- pendence of the reduced etch rate ratio, s- 1 , on the charged particles' restricted linear energy transfer LETA (which also is denoted as restricted energy loss, RELA). As for the ther- moluminescence efficiency, t\(L), the dependence of the re- duced etch rate ratio is not a unique function of LET. If instead of the unrestricted linear energy transfer LET,, (A = oc) only the linear energy is taken into account, which is transferred by secondary electrons with a kinetic energy e &lt; A, the dependence of s-1 on this restricted linear en- ergy transfer approaches a single function if A is chosen appropriately. A value of A = 200 eV has turned out to be a suitable value for the CR-39 material. Further details in- cluding the conversion of LET2(M) into LETX can be found in refs. (16, 29). Figure 6A-C shows the distribution of discrete TLD dose rates inside the phantom, i.e., with the exception of those to the "skin".

The figures show the buildup of the distribution of daily dose rates as measured by TLDs from different groups at over 1600 measurement points in a 2.5-cm-wide grid in xlylz directions in the phantom.

The significantly higher rates in the head, neck and shoulder region reflects the smaller self shielding of the body. The minimum at the bottom of the torso is also due to the shielding of the ISS. Figure 7 shows the interpolated depth distribution of dose rates including the skin measurement. It highlights the very steep decline within the first 8 mm by a factor of about ten. From this depth-dose distribution, an average organ dose rate was determined for each critical organ as the av- erage of the dose rates in those volume elements that were assigned to it in the voxel model. The corresponding results are given in Table 2. The calculated skin dose rate repre- sents an average of the outermost 3 mm. With about 1 mGy/day, it is by far the highest, followed by the dose rate in the eye. With the exception of the breast and the salivary glands, the dose rates for the other organs are in the range from 0.2 to 0.3 mGy/day. The high-LET range (&gt;10 keV/|xm) of integral dose equivalent spectra as measured in CR-39 at representative locations in MATROSHKA are shown in Fig. 8. Whereas in the LET region below 30 keV/|xm the vari- ation with shielding thickness (i.e. organ position) is quite marked, this difference dwindles above 100 keV/|mm. On the other hand, below 50 keV/|xm the spectrum for the reference detector in the ISS is very similar (apart from a constant attenuation) to that of the stomach in MATROSH- KA outside the ISS. The steeper decrease of the spectrum for the reference detector above 100 keV/|xm indicates that for the overall shielding at its location, absorption is begin- ning to take over secondary particle buildup. These depen- dences highlight the important point that not only particle intensities and physical doses change upon penetration through shielding matter but also the shapes of the LET spectra. This is the reason for the variation of the mean quality factor as seen in Table 3. Absorbed doses, D2, cal- culated from particle fluence spectra in CR-39 (not shown) are given in column 3 (DCR,39) of Table 3, whereas dose equivalents, H2, in column 5 (HCR_39) are derived from the spectra in Fig. 8. Column 2 (DTLD_L) shows the low-LET contributions, Dl, to the corresponding organ doses in Ta- ble 2 and the point doses for Poncho and reference detector. Column 4 (DTotal) gives the sum, D, of the preceding low- LET TLD and the high-LET CR-39 absorbed doses. The total dose equivalent, H, for an organ is given in column 6 (HTotal) as the sum of Dl (DTLD,L) (with an associated Q = 1) and the dose equivalent, H2, of the high-LET contribu- tion (HCR_39). The mean quality factor for the total dose to an organ in column 7 ((QT)) is the ratio between HTotal and The attenuation between the outside Poncho location and the interior ISS reference location in dose equivalent (HTotal) by a factor of 2.6 and in absorbed dose (DTotal) by a factor of 3.5 reflects the shielding provided by the wall and the equipment at this location inside the ISS. The associated increase in (QT) reveals the preferential attenuation by shielding of the low-LET component such as bremsstrah- lung and electrons because it is also evident in the ratio 3.8 of the TLD doses (DTLD.L). These data reflect the typical characteristics of the interactions with shielding matter of the space radiation environment in ISS orbits. Similar re- lationships (2.7, 3.9 and 4.2) hold for MATROSHKA's or- gan doses as exhibited by the corresponding data for the skin and the stomach.

The self shielding produces attenuation similar to that of the spacecraft, as is apparent from the comparable dose equiv- alents for the stomach and the interior reference detector. This is further emphasized by the similar quality factors for stomach and reference. The data highlight the fact that shielding not only attenuates particle fluences and thereby absorbed doses but also modifies the composition and "quality" of the radiation field. Since the radiation risk is a function of the biologically weighted dose it is also evi- dent from Table 3 that the considerable effort required for an adequate determination of the dose equivalent is indis- pensable. CONCLUSION MATROSHKA allowed for the first time the measure- ment of the depth-dose distribution throughout a whole hu- man phantom torso under EVA conditions, thereby repre- senting the radiation field inside an astronaut in this fixed orientation with respect to the ISS. The tissue equivalence of the phantom material included the presence of a human skeleton, thereby closely approximating the measurements that in a recent paper were characterized as impossible: "... direct measurements of dose equivalents to critical organs in humans cannot be performed" (30). The substan- tial increase in radiation exposure for an astronaut perform- TABLE 3 Daily Dose Equivalent Rate HTotal for Different Organs Dose contribution: Dl (DTLD.L) D2 (DCR_39) D (Dw) H2 (HCR_39) H (HT()J Tissue/location Gy/day mGy/day mGy/day mSv/day mSv/day {HID) (Qr) Skin 0.879 0.065 0.944 0.763 1.642 1.74 Eye 0.505 0.036 0.541 0.461 0.966 1.78 Stomach 0.211 0.031 0.242 0.407 0.618 2.55 Poncho 0.536 0.065 0.600 0.762 1.298 2.16 Reference 0.141 0.028 0.170 0.350 0.491 2.89 Note.

The TLD-L dose-rate data represent the corrected absorbed dose for LET &lt;10 keV/|xm, and the CR-39 dose-rate data represent the physical doses and dose equivalents for LET &gt;10 keV/|xm. The values for the Poncho and the reference detector represent point dose values instead of the average organ doses. Relative precisions for organ dose values range between 4 and 8% and for (QT) between 9 and 12%. For the point doses, the precision ranges between 1 and 5% and for (QT) it is 5%.</page><page sequence="10">234 REITZ ETAL. ing an EVA predominantly affects tissues and organs close to the body surface. Due to self shielding by the body, exposure of interior organs is only slightly enhanced over that inside the ISS. Noteworthy, however, is the significant increase of the mean quality factor as the radiation quality changes upon its penetration into matter. To be noted also is that the dose distribution determined here depends on the actual paniculate and energy composition of the radiation field at the orbit of the ISS during the exposure of MA- TROSHKA, which, e.g., was free of massive solar particle events. As time changes with respect to the solar cycle, or the orbit with respect to the radiation belts and the geo- magnetic shielding, or the mass shielding around an astro- naut, the internal dose distribution will change. Radiation doses for such varying exposure conditions can be appraised only by radiation transport calculations. Such codes have to deal with an enormous multitude of secondary high-energy particle reactions. Reference (30) e.g. addressed only the current state of the treatment of reaction cross sections in five of the most frequently used radiation transport codes by a joint comparison of their pre- dictions with measurements. At least as important is a suf- ficiently accurate knowledge of the external radiation field during the exposure and of the mass distribution around the astronaut. Regarding the latter, the long-standing contention is still valid (31): "It is impossible to overestimate the value of a thorough knowledge of the space craft shielding dis- tribution" [see also refs. (32, 33) for further discussions on this requirement]. A major purpose of the data gathered in the 3D dose distribution presented here (and presently being further ac- cumulated inside the ISS) is its application in the validation of particle transport models (34-38) that can calculate or- gan doses for the ISS orbit based on consolidated data re- garding the external radiation field and on an accurate shielding model of the ISS, including the Earth's shadow, and the self-shielding of MATROSHKA. A major research effort toward the establishment of such benchmarks is pres- ently launched under a European Commission (EC) re- search grant in the framework of the FP7 program for the HAMLET project involving most of the European partici- pants of the MATROSHKA project.
