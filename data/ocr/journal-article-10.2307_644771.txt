"You must learn the meaning of the Songhay adage," he is told-"One kills something thin in appearance only to discover that inside it is fat." For Stoller, this shift from the arcane, otherworldly goals of aca- deme to the immediate, mundane, and practical field of Songhay existence meant, quite literally, ap- prenticing himself to Songhay teachers, accepting their worldview in their terms, and exploring the contexts in which knowledge was used, that is, had power. Stoller opted for an instrumentalist view of knowledge that judges its worth in terms of its re- lation to the practical and ethical problems of exis- tence. In Sorcery's Shadow can thus be read as a critique of epistemologies that claim that truth is a matter of correspondence to the essence of things or a matter of logical coherence. A critique is also implied of those styles of writing that mask the con- nections between what we come to know in the field and the quotidian context of our life there. The transparency and integrity of Paul Stoller's ethnog- raphy disclose the connections both between Son- ghay magical knowledge and Songhay social life and between his own knowledge and the social cir- cumstances of his fieldwork. This is a considerable achievement. In Sorcery's Shadow is more than a memoir; it is a remarkable and thought-provoking account of sorcery beliefs and practices. In the first place, Son- ghay sorcery reveals a universal human dilemma. As Stoller observes toward the end of his book, If I have discovered anything from my experience of Songhay sorcery, it is that sorcery is a meta- phor for the chaos that constitutes social rela- tions-Songhay or otherwise. We all suffer zamba, a good friend's betrayal. Things crumble and are reconstituted in all societies; we are all in sorcery's shadow. As I see it, the common ground between the Son- ghay and ourselves is the problem of bringing the unseen into the realm of the seen-a problem as central to divination as it is to social science. Be- hind all human schemes, magical or scientific, lies an urge to grasp and control the world by decipher- ing its cryptic signatures. What is universal, then, is the irreducible tension in human life between the precarious and the stable. Our critical sense of the world as a place of risk, uncertain and uncannily unstable, is countermanded by conventions-both social and intellectual-which play down the alea- tory, contingent aspects of existence. But we have a choice here-either to take refuge in the consoling structures of tradition, custom, or science, or to keep alive the sense of perplexity, sustain the sense of contingency, through what Keats called "nega- tive capability." By deliberately bracketing out any schematic or definitive explanation of Songhay sor- cery, Paul Stoller's book testifies both to his per- sonal courage-remaining open to an alien world for as long as he did-and to his artistic integrity, allowing his readers to enter and make sense of this world for themselves. In the second place, Songhay sorcery belongs to a particular time and place, and is grounded in a worldview that many Westerners will find incredi- ble. Although people everywhere seek to preempt, subvert, or control the hidden and hazardous ele- ments of existence, the Songhay see these elements as almost invariably linked to human agency, not natural causes. This anthropomorphic view has as a corollary a notion that acts or events in the "objec- tive" world are inextricably connected to thoughts, desires, and intentions in the "subjective" world. Paul Stoller's apprenticeship was therefore more than a technical matter-acquiring a knowledge of magical medicines and incantations; it entailed em- bracing the view that "subjective" and "objective" states are refractions of a single reality and that thoughts and actions, knowledge and event, are equally aspects of the same empirical world. In this view (which is not really a view but a lived reality), the life of the mind is not etherealized or set over and above the world of the body and of the senses. Both mental and material domains, imagination and matter, are on a par; they are aspects or refrac- tions of a single, seamless continuum of being. For one to ask whether Paul Stoller and his Songhay teachers merely imagined they came under sorcery attack or really did succumb to malevolent spirits is to fail to come to terms with Songhay reality, to fall back upon Eurocentric antinomies-true/false, real/imaginary, thought/deed, knowledge/event, theory/practice, and so on-that give the impres- sion that our way of representing the world to our- selves is the way the world inherently is. Is there anything that we might learn from all this? Can we go along with Paul Stoller and enter seri- ously into the world of Songhay sorcery? I think we can profit by such an exercise, for the beliefs and practices of the people among whom we sojourn as anthropologists provide us with ways and means of developing a critique of our own beliefs and prac- tices-including those of our profession. Paul Stoll- er's book underlines the importance of immersing oneself in another culture rather than just observing it from a discreet distance, of recognizing that the experimental subject in anthropological science is the ethnographer himself or herself. In Sorcery's Shadow presages a radically empirical approach to anthropology, one that places thought, feeling, and activity on a par, which includes the seen and heard as well as the unseen and sensed, which encom- passes the field of crisis as well as convention, an- tistructure as well as structure, the biographical as well as the sociological, the domain of the lived body as well as the domain of words and ideas. Moreover, as this exemplary work so admirably shows, such a radical empiricism can only be a- chieved through radically new developments in ethnographical writing. Paul Stoller prefaces his forthcoming book on Songhay possession with a remark of Adamu Jeni- tongo's: "One doesn't study the spirits, one follows them." I hope that Paul Stoller isn't going to be the only ethnographer who takes this remark to heart. Discourse and the Social Life of Meaning. PHYLLIS PEASE CHOCK and JUNE R. WY- MAN, eds. Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian In- stitution Press, 1986. 232 pp., tables, figures, notes, references. $22.50 (cloth). GEORGE E. MARCUS Rice University reviews 391</page><page sequence="2">By one reading, this collection from the 1983-84 program of the Anthropological Society of Wash- ington is another set of well-crafted papers on a va- riety of ethnographic subjects exemplifying a diversity of contemporary practices in cultural anal- ysis. But read against the provocative lead papers by Stephen Tyler and Paul Stoller, the others might be understood as variously situating themselves in response to the radical critique of anthropology's capacity to treat discourse, experience, and mean- ing, posed by the first two papers. This is the specific framing for the volume that the editors have tried to construct with considerable success, given the many different ways the papers are pulled by their own senses of problem. Of the two initial metacritiques which place cul- tural analysis in a broad context of Western thought about language and representation, Tyler's is the more profound and unrelenting. His essay, "Post- Modern Anthropology," marks an evolution from his 1978 work, The Said and the Unsaid, in which he broke with the formalist tradition in semiotics, psychology, linguistics, and cognitive anthropol- ogy, toward a hermeneutics of spoken discourse that is based on a very different set of influences from that of the established ethnography of com- munication. Through a highly original, playful, and compelling genealogy of ideas that traces ancient and now renewed debates about the relationships among spoken and written expression, ethics, and knowledge, Tyler makes a villain of writing in a way that challenges much of the semiotic theory on which cultural analysis has depended. Instead, he conjures a post-modern anthropology to which the self-consciously "strange" visionary writing and thought pictures of the present essay remain par- odically true. As he concludes, in part, "The great problem for post-modern anthropology is either to give up on writing altogether or to achieve by writ- ten means what speech creates, without simply im- itating speech. It may well be that some kind of naive realism is what common sense will demand" (p. 45). Dismissable as nihilistic only in ignorance or from an anxious concern for the permanence of anthropological tradition, his critique is powerful precisely because he does not feel obliged to hedge by professing that ethnography or cultural analysis necessarily must be saved. As Lyotard might say, Tyler is "just gaming." Paul Stoller in "The Reconstruction of Ethnogra- phy" delivers a similar message, but he fully locates himself within the ethnographic project at the heart of cultural anthropology. He begins, appropriately, with two tales of his fieldwork among the Songhay; one of failure in a positivist mode of structuring fieldwork encounters, and one of an opening to a thoroughly "Other" world through dialogic rela- tionships. Favoring "lush, vivid, lyrical, and per- sonal writing" over the "flat, neutral, and 'sludgy' writing" by which distanced objectivity is achieved, Stoller stops short of approving Derri- dean free play and concludes with a statement of faith in an ethnography humanistically recon- structed so as to address multiple readerships and to invent strategies for incorporating the multiple voices that compose it. Reviving a form of etymological criticism prac- ticed by Giambattista Vico, Michael Herzfeld shows how the official (largely written) discourse of the nation-state has historically reified concepts equivalent to culture and ethnicity, and how these same concepts are continually deconstructed in the "naive [but fully contextualized] realism" of unself- conscious speech in village life. Herzfeld creates a complex subject to lend significance to his ethnog- raphy, a subject that transcends the basic represen- tational practices targeted by Tyler and Stoller. The intermingling of ethnographic, local, and official etymologies creates a critical self-scrutiny of the rei- fying tendencies of analytic language just as Herz- feld conventionally employs it in this essay. In a somber and controversial essay about how meanings associated with social identities are kept intact in American culture, Constance Perin gives the notion of liminality in culture theory a ground- ing in the neurophysiology of fear, anxiety, and aggression. American culture would seem intracta- ble and "thin" compared to the semiotic wholeness of, say, Amazonian cosmology, and the meaning of acts among Americans also would appear more co- gently derivable from the "unsaid." Perin's move toward a biological base will likely disconcert most cultural anthropologists. Yet, in a sense, it is a so- lution fully responding to Tyler's radical critique of representation in that it escapes discourse as object, without of course avoiding the strong claim for the operation of a culture-neutral substratum in the constitution of cultural meaning James Peacock's charming account of factional- ism among Appalachian Baptists fits squarely in the realist mode of ethnographic representation that Ty- ler and Stoller critique, but it is so filled with warmth and good faith, no one is likely to mind. Judith Goldstein uses contemporary discussions of narrative to excellent effect in explaining the sal- ience for the remnant Jewish community of Yazd, Iran, of stories told by its women of the attempt to convert these women to Islam. Goldstein finds that the constant decentering of individuals in a dialec- tic between individualized stories and anonymous ones sustains a strong ethos of collectivity despite a predominant condition of decline. She focuses on the conditions of self-representation among her subjects-how they textualize themselves in an or- ality that is sensitive to literate conventions. By describing the formal properties of associa- tions between popular mythologies and subtle theologies, Jon Anderson develops an innovative "site" for phenomenological analysis. He too deals with representations and their construction as well as their hierarchization, but in reading them ironi- cally-as mutually derived-he tries to avoid the Orientalist penchant for deriving little traditions from great ones. Phyllis Chock deals with the phenomenon of the genesis of Greek ethnic identity among third gen- eration, presumably assimilated Americans. Through the juxtaposition of and search for resem- blances among the testimonies of in-marrying wives, Chock clarifies the relationship between the pervasive discourse framework of individualism in American culture and ethnic identification. Texts, not dialogues, are Chock's data which she recog- nizes are pale alternatives to myths outside the modern world. Finally, Sharon Stephens examines the relations 392 american ethnologist</page><page sequence="3">between ideology and everyday practices in Sami (Lapp) cultural orders. Her aim is to enact the "rad- ical culture theory" argued in Sahlins' Culture and Practical Reason whereby material realities are fully mediated by cultural structures. Most of the papers work well within the tradition that Tyler and Stoller critique. Yet by treating rep- resentation itself as a subject of inquiry and by dist- ancing the written work from the fieldwork through the tropes of the historian and literary critic, the ho- rizons toward which more ambitious anthropolog- ical writing has recently moved, one would like to think that they manage to avoid the main thrusts of the critique. The Colonial Harem. MALEK ALLOULA. Min- neapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1986. xxii + 135 pp., photographs, selected bibliog- raphy. $29.50 (cloth), $13.95 (paper). LILA ABU-LUGHOD Institute for Advanced Study At first glance this might seem an odd book to rec- ommend to anthropologists. A "symptomatic" reading (p. 4) of a remarkable set of postcards of Al- gerian women which were made and sent by the French in Algeria during the first three decades of this century, Alloula's text is a rich and complex re- flection on the relationship between colonialism and sexual fantasy. His "reading" reveals in dev- astating detail how the French dream of dominating a colonial people was played out and asserted through the obsessive fantasy of entering the harem and unveiling and undressing Algerian women. As he confesses, Alloula, an Algerian writer living in France, is not left indifferent by these photo- graphs. His attempt, as he puts it, "lagging far be- hind History, to return this immense postcard to its sender" (p. 5), and to oppose and exorcize the "viv- isector's" gaze to which he and his fellow Algerians (and algeriennes) were vulnerable, takes the form, like Edward Said's Orientalism (Pantheon, 1978; Random House, 1979) of a critical analysis of the cultural productions of the West. He does not offer to correct the picture of Algerian women, to show what they are or were "really like." In fact he pro- vides little information about Algeria. That task is left to Barbara Harlow whose substantial and in- formative introduction to the historical and social context of Algerian life and to women's place in it will satisfy the student, the scholar unfamiliar with the Middle East, and any of us who feel ungrounded in the very French intellectual world of critical the- ory, Barthes, and psychoanalysis. That is the world Alloula inhabits and, ironically, it is in its language that he raises an indigenous voice against the hu- miliation of his colonial past. For anthropologists the most intriguing aspect of Alloula's argument may be his suggestion that eth- nography is implicated, perhaps complicitous, in this enterprise of exotic photography. Alloula shows how the colonial postcard sets up a "rhetoric of camouflage" which, no matter what the theme, forefronts its "avowed purpose" of providing "a photographic survey of society and landscape" (p. 28) or "a visual documentation of human types" (p. 4). His central argument is that ethnography pro- vides the alibi for this series of photographs whose "unsaid" is colonial ideology and whose "re- pressed" is a collective sexual phantasm (p. 28). He explores the techniques used by the photographers to "confer. . .some 'scientific' seriousness" (p. 130, n. 20) on their bare-breasted subjects. At one point he exposes the flimsiness of this ethnographic cover by juxtaposing three photographs of the same model, wearing the same clothing and photo- graphed in the same studio, captioned variously as "Young Bedouin Woman," "Young Woman from the South," and "Young Kabyl Woman" (p. 62). Given the recent development within anthropol- ogy of sophisticated critiques of the relationship be- tween ethnography and colonialism, The Colonial Harem (originally published in French in 1981) may seem not to go far enough in questioning ethnog- raphy itself. For the photographer ethnography may be just an alibi, but Alloula's insights regarding the equivalence of the colonial gaze and the photog- rapher's gaze raise interesting questions for those who are beginning to suspect that the ethnogra- pher's "objective" gaze is not as innocent as we like to think. Alloula links the "voyeurism" of the photographer and tourist with the soldier's and col- onist's opening up of the country; what keeps the ethnographer distinct from this company? Alloula's reading forces the postcard to reveal its silences. One must ask whether the silences of ethnography parallel those of the colonial postcard which, "in its illusive dissolution of actual resistance...offers a view of a pacified reality, restored to the colonial order, which presently proceeds to draw up an in- ventory of it" (p. 64). A book that provokes us to consider such questions is much welcome. Yet I found this book disturbing not so much for what it suggested about colonial domination and Orientalist dreams but for a silence of which Al- loula seems unconscious. As Harlow points out in her introduction, "women have long been at the center of the conflict between East and West" (p. xiv), and in The Colonial Harem they remain at the center as voiceless objects of a struggle between men, Algerian and French. One detects within Al- loula's disgust at the photographer's (and the colo- nist's) claims of access to the private space of women and the family an Algerian's sense of male honor violated. The exposure of these women, or rather those Algerian women for whom these pros- titute models are substitutes, to the "heavy desire" that pornography evokes is made the sign of the im- potence of a routed "male society" unable to pro- tect its women (p. 122). The French penetration of the harem is for Al- loula a metaphor for the conquest of Algeria. Some people would argue that sexual domination is not a metaphor. In publishing these postcards Alloula has once more offered these women-previously rep- resentative of Algerian women, but in the post-co- lonial age perhaps of all women-to the gaze of people for whom photographs of half-naked women are part of a familiar genre-pornogra- phy-whose message is women's sexual availabil- ity. The photographs' eroticism, half a century later, is all too real. "Commentary stumbles against the shabbiness of such infra-pornography" (p. 98), remarks Alloula reviews 393</page></plain_text>
