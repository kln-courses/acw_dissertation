<plain_text><page sequence="1">Sociometry 1975, Vol. 38, No. 1, 148-1 61 On The Work Of Jacob L. Moreno EDGAR F. BORGATTA ROBERT BOGUSLAW MARTIN R. HASKELL Jacob L. Moreno died on May 14, 1974 after almost 84 years of a vigorous, productive and multi-faceted life. Among his intellectual enterprises was the creation of this journal. Therefore, it is fitting that an attempt to assess certain of Moreno's accomplishments be published in Sociometry. The three statements which follow vary in their emphases, but all carry the picture of a man who attempted to exemplify his own first principle: our basic nature is fulfilled only through our ability to be creative and spontaneous. Moreno's creative spontaneity resulted in a corpus of work surrounded by controversy. At one time or another, the work has been critically debated by psychiatrists, psychologists, and sociologists. That one man could have been viewed as controversial in such a range of disciplines is perhaps one valid indicator of the importance of his ideas. The debate over the significance of Moreno 's work will not be resolved in what follows, nor should it be. The Editor THREE CONTRIBUTIONS OF JACOB L. MORENO Since J. L. Moreno had such an active and productive life, it is not possible to summarize his contributions simply. As a practitioner, teacher and scientist, his influence has been felt in many ways. The current brief comment leans heavily on personal impressions, reinforced by reconsidering a fair amount of Moreno's work.' A global view of his work reveals an overriding interest in the development of psychodrama, group psychotherapy, and a whole complex of therapeutically oriented procedures. His scientific tMoreno's output was enormous. The bibliography of Who Shall Survive? (Revised Edition) is an excellent starting point for anyone interested in getting a 148</page><page sequence="2">149 interest arises almost as the incidental concern for enabling means, even though this interest sometimes has been prominently and self-consciously brought to the forefront. In this comment emphasis will be placed on three contributions that seem impressive. The first contribution is one that occurs in the world of political and social realities, and this is Moreno's influence in the development of theories of behavior, particularly as they relate to the therapeutically oriented professions. In the early 1950's, Freudian theory and analytic systems were pervasive, and challenges to them on general theoretical grounds did not abound. The resistance of scientific communities to the mystique of Freud had been diminishing, and pockets of all-embracing acceptance of Freudianism developed in many locations. Moreno remained unflagging in his resistance, and his response was the positive one of presenting alternative approaches. But when attacked, he could counterattack. The following quotation illustrates part of his conception of the analytic approaches. The psychoanalytic system has in common with other analytic systems which followed its steps, the tendency to associate the origins of life with calamity. The key concept of the Freudian system is the libido. But Freud, instead of associating sex with 'spontaneity', associated it with anxiety, insecurity, abreaction, frustration and substitution. His system shows strong inclinations towards the negative and for negation, a tendency which grew stronger in him with age. Even sexuality, which owes him its permanent elevation to a respectable and powerful agent, he studied in its negative rather than in its positive aspects... .Surely, he hoped that by showing up the calamities in the course of analysis, a healthy sexual life, liberated from its shackles, will emerge. But all along he gave priority to the hindrances of sexual life and not to its performance, cultivation and training. Adler's system started with another calamity, the inferiority of organs and the feelings of inferiority. Rank started with a different calamity again, with the trauma of birth. All therapeutic prescriptions in these three systems were made to overcome the initial calamity which the human actor encounters. ..(1953: lii-liii). Possibly, his view may be better summarized by his comment: "To my mind, persons like Jesus, Buddha, Socrates and Gandhi were doctors and healers; for Freud they were probably patients" (1953:xxvii).The point is that Moreno was a dynamic force who was able to influence scientists and practitioners and turn their attention grasp of his work. The volume has a section on "Preludes" that introduces the reader to Moreno's view of history and the world. Moreno has often been seen as overly expansive in his view of the world, but there was, so to speak, method in his madness. Moreno cannot be dismissed by anyone who probes into his work.</page><page sequence="3">150 SOCIOMETRY to important alternative approaches in their attempts to explain human behavior. The second contribution is but another way of phrasing the first. Moreno developed his approaches in a succession of experiences, involving, from his own recounting, some accident in their discovery. He was experimental, but he was reactive and observant. While emphasizing concepts of spontaneity and creativity, he seemed always aware of patterns and designs. His adaptation of the theatre to the analysis of behavior and its possible change appears a natural progression, but to recognize the efficacy of techniques requires something else. In psychodrama, various techniques are employed, and sequence and programming give the concept unity. But some elements of psychodrama are more transportable than others. The procedure of role-playing as a technique that has been refined to become usable for many purposes and in many circumstances, has been an enormous contribution. Moreno 's unique and persistent contributions to group approaches suggest his sensitivity to the forces of social control which are part of the social order. The development of group therapy and group psychotherapy, including giving these procedures their names, was in no way accidental. In the particular forms to which Moreno gave most of his attention, psychodrama and sociodrama, he demon- strated that his knowledge, sometimes intuitive and sometimes derived from more systematic observation, went beyond the usual. Not only may the group be used as the source of social support, legitimation, and sanction-and not only may permissive and facilitating situations be devised for accomplishing this-but the individual may be affected (through particular procedures that situationally dispose him to become aware) to have insight, to learn, and to practice behavior. Role-playing can result in learning and behavioral change, when used by a master like Moreno. The variety of types of role-playing range from the simple reflection of human processes as we might encounter them in the socialization process to more complex and subtle designs. Role practice for example, might remind us of a mother saying: "Your rich uncle is coming to visit. Tell me what you are going to say to him." Role reversal may recall the procedure as we try to "understand" the point of view of the other, but as applied, of course, it has more efficacy in placing the demand for performing on the individual. Role-playing in this particular aspect-of taking the role of others or positions other than one's own-has been one of the few procedures through which change in beliefs and behavior have been demonstrated in experimental social psychology. Other procedures, such as the</page><page sequence="4">151 "mirror" or the "alter ego", relate directly to questions of probing processes of the self in relation to others, and in terms of the unique meanings one may give to events. The emphasis of these procedures on interaction, on the observation of the person as he behaves with others, and often in the presence of others beyond those with whom he interacts directly, represented an enormous thrust forward not only for the current period of social psychological theory and research, but also for the applied social and psychological sciences. The third contribution is the development of what has sometimes been called the sociometric approach. Here the development is not of a single procedure, but of a whole class of procedures. Moreno's major impact on the academic and research enterprises rests on this work. Moreno charts the origins of his interest in this area in the flow of interaction and pacing of action in the Stetgreiftheater, but also in the analysis of who influences whom in social interactions. The interest was one he developed in order to understand those processes which make psychotherapeutic applications more realistically grounded in the empirical world. Historically, in social science, there are many antecedents of things common to the sociologist's tool kit, but, whatever the origins, Moreno in this case clearly is the source of the major development of sociometry. In Who Shall Survive? Moreno developed distinctions among various sociometric criteria. In developing the notion that different information is obtained from asking a question and phrasing a "test", he emphasized the distinction between a choice and a judgment. Then followed distinctions between the analysis of structures of relationships and the attribution of characteristics to persons. In analyzing structures, the point of beginning for Moreno was the social atom: the set of relationships that impinge directly on the person. The social atoms join at various levels to become the fabric of the social order, and the analysis of these mergings is the objective in the representations of the sociomatrix, sociogram, and the concept of networks. Through these representations, the development of groups may be charted and roles (or statuses) described. Moreno was receptive to those who would extend his contributions, and encouraged many developments which he saw as going technically beyond his interests and use. In the area of sociometric analysis, he certainly represents the fountainhead. An appreciation of Moreno's contributions is difficult to develop without familiarity with the constant productivity of the man. From among his many contributions, the fundamental importance of two is beyond debate. Samuel A. Stouffer once commented to a somewhat overwhelmed young student regarding Moreno: Whatever</page><page sequence="5">152 SOCIOMETRY else, how many of us can look forward to leaving two such important contributions as role-playing and the sociometric test? Edgar F. Borgatta Queens College MORENO, SOCIOMETRIC METHODOLOGY AND THE REDESIGN OF SOCIETY Social scientists concerned with the relevance of their work for solving social problems often become quite irritated with methodological issues. Excessive concern with the issue of validity, for example, was once described by a leading sociologist as a form of "protective negativism" used by social researchers to gloss over the moral inconsequence, social insignificance and human irrelevance of their endeavors (Lee, 1954). One suspects that manifestations of "protective negativism" are more likely to occur these days in connection with the issue of reliability than validity. And if one wished to describe his concerns in this idiom, one might well say that Moreno's disappointment with sociometry stemmed precisely from a sense that even the journal bearing its name has seemed to sacrifice validity on the altar of reliability. Perhaps all this was predictable. From time to time it is helpful to be reminded that the root meaning of the word "validity" is the same as that for the word "value." There is at least an inescapable etymological sense in which a scientific judgment about thevalidity of a finding depends upon the value lenses thorough which it is viewed. For Abraham Kaplan, "The validity of a measurement consists in what it is able to accomplish, or more accurately, in what we are able to do with it; plainly this 'what' depends on the context of the measurement's use. Validity is not determined just by the instrument and scale of measurement, nor even by the 'intrinsic nature' of the magnitude being measured.... The basic question is always whether the measures have been so arrived at that they can serve effectively as means to the given end" (1964:198). One might ask, for example: what is the end for which sociometric tests are characteristically constructed? Is it to measure verbal choice behav- ior? It is certainly possible to define the technique in these terms and construct a self-contained scientific discipline dedicated to the recording and analysis of verbal choices. Such a science might devote its attention to the reliability of various sociometric criteria and confine its concern with validity to assessments of items as predictors of responses to question clusters. Alternate methods for wording</page><page sequence="6">153 questions could be explored and interesting indices for summarizing recorded choices could be developed. In a deeply troubled world, such a science offers many tempting attractions. It is safe, inoffensive, intellectually satisfying and even potentially rewarding in a pecuniary or professional sense. For the aspiring young academician who must compete feverishly in a publish or perish environment, it holds out the promise for quick and salable results. For others, it can be a continuing source of puzzle-solving gratification and a useful alternative to intellectual games such as chess, go or contract bridge. But clearly this is not what Moreno had in mind when he started it all. The validity with which he was concerned was not restricted to determining the soundness of written responses as predictors of verbal behavior. He rejected a science and a world restricted to paper parameters and word acts. In order to comprehend Moreno's conception of sociometry, it is necessary to understand that his self image was something much more than that of a scientist as defined in conventional contemporary terms. Perhaps the greatest of the scientists have always been healers and philosophers at heart. In any case, for Moreno, sociometry was always a complex combination of science, therapy and philosophy (see Nehnevajsa, 1960). For him the validity of a sociometric test or action technique depends, in the final analysis, on its usefulness in restructuring society. If a recorded response has no implication for significant behavior or states of being either in an existing society or for one in the process of being redesigned, then collecting and analyzing it is simply an exercise in futility. For Moreno, the cornerstone of sociometry is the "doctrine of spontaneity and creativity". To many, Moreno's view of the universe takes the form of a theology which describes life as containing both elements. Every being in the universe, by its very nature, has been awarded the blessing and curse of spontaneity and creativity (Moreno, 1953). For those having a need to remain fixated at a level of methodology, it is possible to read Moreno's apparently theological pronouncements as something of an extension of the familiar battle waged over the asserted differences between Geisteswissenschaften and Naturwissenschaften as developed by Wilhelm Dilthey and his successors-several generations of symbolic interactionists. Within this context, sociometric tests, psychodrama, sociodrama and group psychotherapy, as integral parts of sociometry, represent empirical techniques replacing the more diffuse and "unscientific" operation</page><page sequence="7">154 SOCIOMETRY of verstehen. But much more than methodology is involved. Moreno does seem to accept the proposition that it is possible, for some purposes, to place human beings into conceptual straitjackets and treat them as objects indistinguishable from other objects in the natural and physical world. But the accompanying rigidities in human behavior would be, in his view, quite pathological. To the extent that human beings do not in fact change-to the extent that they become completely predictable and lose their spontaneity and creativity-they have become somewhat less than human. Moreno was interested in a science and practice of human beings, rather than one restricted to tracing the paths of robots. Those who have lost their spontaneity and creativity may well be more tractable to study by means of conventional positivist methods, but they are also those most desperately in need of immediate therapy. The difficulty with a long run view of human actions is not simply that in the long run we all die; it also is that mummification can precede death. A long run perspective smooths the curve of human behavior but it can scarcely deal with unpredicted manifestations of spontaneity or creativity. For Moreno, then, there were two broadly distinguishable types of social research: (1) "the peripheral external, indirect, pseudo- objective" and (2) "the central, internal, direct, subjective-objective type" (1951:43). Obviously, he preferred the latter. Furthermore, there are two polar types of sociological imperative: (1) "Mankind may passively wait for the day when the scientific project of social research has completed its task; and (2) Mankind may now and here, actively take its social destiny in its own hands-initiate experiments and simultaneously check their validity" (1951:43). Evoking a vision of Moreno passively waiting for anything, becomes an exercise in short-circuiting the imagination. Of course he chose the second imperative. The chief methodological task of sociometry was, then, nothing less than the "revision of experimental method so that it can be applied effectively to social phenomena" (1951:31). Etymologically, sociometry is derived from the Latin metrum (to measure) and socius (companion). Moreno was interested in both derivatives, but felt that socius had been neglected far more than had metrum. The sociometric experiment consciously addresses itself to the problem of redesigning society. It "aims to change the old social order into a new social order. It is a design to rebuild the groups, if necessary, so that the official surface structure is as near as possible to the depth structure. The sociometric test, in its dynamic form, is a revolutionary category of investigation. It upsets the group from within and its relation to other groups; it produces a social revolution</page><page sequence="8">155 on a microscopic scale" (1951:37). In this connection, Moreno speaks approvingly of the methodol- ogy developed by Marx as opposed to the positivist methods elaborated by Comte and Mill. The essential difference was a simple one: Marx was a "theorist and thinker of practice. In his Theses on Feuerbach and Communist Manifesto, Marx was unconsciously following a model of experimental method more indigenous to the social sciences, a model of social actors in a world of action" (1951:24). But Marx (like a good sociometrist) was not interested in experimental precision and validation for their own sake. He was interested in significant methods which work in practice and are borne out by "experiments of nature". Marx's historic error, in Moreno's view, was to underestimate the power of religious and social-psychological forces in group behavior. "The deep analyst of the relation of merchandise to man was a poor psychologist of human interrelations. Marx thought that the... socio-psychological problems of man can wait; that, so to speak, two different revolutions were necessary and that the economic-social revolution has to precede what we have called the psychological or creative revolution of human society" (Moreno, 1953). It is easy to quarrel with what reads like a somewhat over-simplified presentation of Marx's position; but on another level, it is useful to recall that Moreno was nurtured in an intellectual climate that produced the Hegelianized Marxism of Lukacs as well as the critical Marxism of the Frankfort school. Participating in the often tortured polemics engaged in by many writers who were similarly nurtured was not consistent with Moreno's temperament. He did not wish simply to talk about praxis; he acted. He refused to wait for changes in consciousness to develop; he wanted to help people throw off the shackles of psychological bondage-the "cultural conserves"-and be free to create new worlds. Characteristically, he seized the largest tiger he could find by its own tail. He was not content to play with his sociometric gadgetry in the backwaters of provincial lands; he insisted upon invading the United States of America-the one place in the world where he was least likely to succeed. It was in the midst of the most advanced industrial state, in the very heartland of positivism, that he chose to do battle. He lived to see many of his most cherished inventions converted into lifeless rituals and intellectual toys, while spontaneity and creativity were shunted off into the back-waters of the cultural "underground" only to emerge now and again in the marketable form of "encounter groups" and related fads of group experimenta- tion.</page><page sequence="9">156 SOCIOMETRY But in a sense, Moreno's most profound contributions were always destined for marginality in a society whose central ethos revolves about industrial production and its concomitant rationalization of everyday life. As Henri Lefevre (1962) has pointed out, in such societies poets, artists and creative intellectuals can derive their creative inspiration only from marginal situations. The very society that asks them to be creative simultaneously tries to subject them to its own norms and to reduce their marginality. It tries to socialize them by integrating their activity into the established framework of production. Attempts are made to make creativity functional and even official through the use of such means as repression, seduction and compensation. Thus the greatness and tragedy of Moreno was that he chose to work as a non-marginal man in a society in which he was destined for marginality. He lived to see the less important aspects of his work enshrined in the hearts of academic, business and government establishments, while his most significant efforts still remain part of that marginality to which their very creativity condemns them. Robert Boguslaw Washington University-St. Louis MORENO'S IMAGE OF MAN J. L. Moreno must be considered as one of the greatest intellectual innovators of the twentieth century. His best known contributions were in sociometry, group psychotherapy, psychodrama and sociodrama. Because much of his work challenged some established concepts in psychology, psychiatry, and sociology, Moreno the man and his contributions were frequently the subject and object of controversy. It was not at all unusual for people who adopted or even plagiarized some portions of his work to reject strongly Moreno the man and various aspects of his work. That this phenomenon occurred as frequently as it did greatly disturbed Moreno. He re- sented the fact that many of the sociologists and psychologists who accepted and employed the quantifying techniques of sociometry either ignored or attacked the underlying philosophy. His contributions to group psychotherapy, psychodrama, and group dynamics received similar treatment at the hands of some clinical psychologists and psychiatrists, particularly those with a psycho- analytic orientation. Perhaps one explanation for these seemingly contradictory attitudes is that Moreno's life's work is broken up into many pieces which do not appear to mesh. Here, I shall attempt to</page><page sequence="10">157 present what I consider his work's unifying theme-his image of man. Basic to an understanding of the Moreno system is his religious philosophy. To Moreno, the limited success of Christianity, Buddhism, Judaism, and other religions of the past did not prove that the concept of religion itself had failed. He contended that religion should be tried again, and advocated a new variety, one modified by the insights provided by science. Rejecting an anthropomorphic conception of God, he postulated one which received varied interpretations. In my view, his conception of the Godhead was the "I" in man. The creative portion of each person was God, and the Godhead represented the infinite creativity of mankind. Moreno viewed the creation as a continuous process, with man creating miracles in the world. In the course of this process, man is continuously participating in the creation of the world of the future. The world which each person finds at birth is one which billions of human beings have aided in creating and to which he or she has the potential of making a contribution. People are not viewed as opposed to society nor is society seen as hostile to them. On the contrary, each person is regarded as a willing and active participant who shares in the creation. Active participation is viewed positively. Those who do not participate with others are isolated and alienated. All Moreno's contributions are related to this religious philosophy. "It may be said that I tried to do through sociometry what religion without science has failed to accomplish in the past, and what science without religion has failed to accomplish. All the cultural and social techniques which I developed in the course of the years have been motivated to serve this purpose" (Moreno, 1953: xv). To Moreno, man is more than a psychologic, social, or biologic being: he is a creator, co-responsible with others for the whole universe. His actions may contribute to the change or even the destruction of the universe. Many scientists found Moreno's religious philosophy unacceptable. Because they rejected his religious view of the universe and man's relation to it, they tended either to reject his contributions, or to apply his techniques in the furtherance of objectives based on other explanations of human behavior. In his magnum opus "Who Shall Survive?", Moreno set forth his theory of sociometry. He pointed out that Darwin had answered the survival question from the point of view of the biologist: Darwin's hypothesis of natural selection contended that the organisms best adapted to the environment survive; variations favorable to adaptations tend to be preserved; while those unfavorable to adaption tend to be destroyed. Moreno answered the question, "Who shall survive?" from a point of view of a sociologist or sociometrist.</page><page sequence="11">158 SOCIOMETRY Physically weak organisms were permitted to survive in many societies of our time. A social process of selection had supplemented and in some societies replaced the biological natural selection. Moreno sought answers to the question, "Which are the social laws of natural selection?" In an ideal sociometric society, each would be given the opportunity to participate to the best of his abilities. No one would be cast out. Each would be permitted to realize his potential and to survive. In the interaction that occurs in billions of small groups, this process of natural and social selection comes to the awareness of the sociometrist. In these groups one can observe the actions of the "socius", the whole person in interaction with others. Because the entire person is involved in any action, Moreno rejected as inadequate any reduction to simpler elements of abstraction. While sociometric techniques are often employed to determine the structures of groups and to relate other variables to those structures, the techniques were developed with broader purposes in mind. To Moreno, sociometry was a therapeutic procedure, and as such could not have less of an objective than that of assisting the whole of mankind. He saw mankind as a social and organic unit, and noted that tendencies existed between the different parts of the unity which drew them apart at some times and together at others. Such tendencies could be beneficial for some segments and deleterious for others. Applying this analysis to the United States, he described our nation as suffering from a social sickness he termed low cohesion. He felt that if we made a chart of the nation's social structure based on human relations, positive and negative, or sympathetic and prejudicial, we would find millions of small groups each gravitating around their own center-each a social atom. He saw the connections between these social atoms as missing, weak or distorted. In a spontaneously growing society, such as ours, he saw cohesion as rising or declining in proportion to the number of independent groups within it, each focused upon their independent goals. The social health of the nation was viewed as dependent upon its cohesion, as was the social health of mankind. His goal, therefore, was to combine in one society high individual freedom with high cohesion. Attractions and repulsions related to indices of biological, social and psychological criteria could be measured in small groups-in the social atoms. Complex patterns of social structure may be constructed from simple ones by increasing the number of individuals and the qualities of mutual interest in such a way as to achieve results of a social nature-greater cohesion, for example. Sociometry was intended to provide a method for a process of</page><page sequence="12">159 classification which may be calculated to bring people together who are capable of harmonious interpersonal relationships. A social group created in this way would be expected to function with a minimum of disruptive tendencies. Used in this way, sociometry as a therapeutic procedure encourages people to join those groups they are spontaneously inclined to join, as free as possible from indoctrination. It is in such groups that humans can be more spontaneous and creative. Such groups permit natural growth. To the extent that one can choose, one is free. Moreno searched for methods which would unify society. Sociometry and related techniques were developed to provide these methods. Man, Moreno believed, could best attain his potential, could become most spontaneous and creative, in groups which gave him acceptance and recognition. Isolation and alienation of the individual was seen as evidence of a deficiency in social relationships, a deficiency attributable in part to the behavior of the isolate and in part to the responses of others to his behavior. The problem of freedom arises in the clash of spontaneous forces (Moreno, 1944). The spontaneous creativity of an individual can be inhibited by the responses of others in the groups. The problem was to find social structures which permitted creative spontaneity. Group psychotherapy, psychodrama, sociodrama and other Moreno inventions were developed to provide man the opportunity to explore social relationships in a laboratory setting. These methods could be used to examine past and present relations and to experiment with new patterns. In synthetic groups, people could prepare for future situations in their natural groups. People could learn to accept others and in the process increase their own self-acceptance. Moreno first employed group therapy in Vienna in 1913 while working with a group of prostitutes. He was not motivated by a desire to reform the women nor was he trying to analyze them. His principal objective was to have them interact in order to examine the problems they encountered in their occupation, how they resolved them, and how others exploited them. In the process, Moreno hoped that they would begin to respect each other and accept themselves. He noted that the work of LaSalle and Marx resulted not only in better working conditions for the worker, but also in an improved self-image and greater self-acceptance. It is this self-acceptance that Moreno hoped to enhance in group therapy. The experience of community of interest in a group of persons that respected and accepted each other, he believed, led to this increase in acceptance of self and self-respect. In such a group, people could become more spontaneous (that is, seek novel solutions to their</page><page sequence="13">160 SOCIOMETRY problems) and more creative (establish new patterns of behavior). Moreno's hypothesis of "spontaneity-creativity" was that these were propelling forces in human progress beyond and independent of libido and socioeconomic motive. He further hypothesized that love and mutual sharing were powerful working principles in group life. Group therapy to him meant healing, which was produced autonomously through the forces in the group itself. Each member of the group was potentially the therapist of every other. Psychodrama and sociodrama added action to the group therapy process. On the psychodramatic stage, using the large number of techniques developed by Moreno and others, the individual could achieve a great deal more catharsis, insight and awareness of alternatives than was possible in therapy limited to verbal communication. The use of all of these techniques and methods taken together constitute a system which was designed to treat not only the disturbed individual nor even the poorly functioning group but actually all mankind. He summarized these objectives in the following terms: "The emancipation of the insane from the chains symbolized the first psychiatric revolution. The second revolution was characterized by the establishment of psychotherapy... .a medical psycho-therapy. The platform of the third psychiatric revolution consists of a medical sociology. It showed its first signs with the advent of group psychotherapy and psychodrama, and the decline of individual methods of psychotherapy. ...Its ultimate goal is a therapeutic society" (1956:25).
