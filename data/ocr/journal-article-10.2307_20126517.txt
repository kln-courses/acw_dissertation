New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1973. 183 pp. $7.95?This is the best general book available in English on Plutarch, written by the foremost scholar at Oxford in the Greek literature of this period, containing many fresh insights, along with a clear grasp of the subject and accurate scholarship. The scope is wide: Plutarch's life; the language; style; and form of his writings; his sources and method of writing ; his philosophy and religion ; the</page><page sequence="2">624 WILLIAM A. FRANK AND STAFF moral essays and his humanism; the nature of the Lives; and the inevitable Nachleben. The size, unfortunately, is small. Russell's best chapters are on Plutarch's style, with its baroque fantasies sometimes inspired by Plato's vision of the world beyond, and the chapters recreating the literary world and cultural values of the time. Through Russell we can come to an appreciation of the era from the end of the Second to the beginning of the Third Cen turies a.D. when a romantic revival of the past attracted by the pure Attic of Plato's literary classics stimulated an interest in Platonic philosophy. His treatment of Plutarch's more metaphysical works, however, leaves something to be desired. He correctly sees Plutarch as a somewhat unorthodox Middle-Platonist, but he does not push him too far into Neoplatonism. His comments on Plutarch's inter pretation of the world soul do not give a clear enough picture of Plutarch's method of interpreting Plato. In this case the use of isolated passages from dialogues other than the Timaeus led to an ingenious but illegitimate and anthropomorphic description of the world soul. Russell tends to overlook Plutarch's conception of the soul as mindless rather than evil. Further, he is not strong in noting the deviationism in so far as Plutarch confused or identified God, the Forms, and the soul, as well as God, the Good, and the One, and spoke of the phenomenal world as a mirror of the Ideal, while being the first to suggest the hypostases of being which became prominent in the Gnostic writings. His treatment of Plutarch's demonology (a crucial issue in Neoplatonism) is sane. One can happily cite him on Plutarch's religious writings: "The Platonist theme of the essential reliability and goodness of God is the key to Plutarch's attitude toward religion."?belief without dogmatism (p. 81). Much can be learned from his comments on the moral essays: the exercise of virtue as the key to moral improve ment; stress on the gentler forms of arete as the essence of the good life; stress on the education of women to improve society; and that philanthropia and stress on the mean as the heart of his ethical teaching. Finally one can cite his observation on the Moralia: "He lavished art and ingenuity on these elaborate set-pieces, in which imitation of Plato did not prevent him from adumbrating doctrines which Plato never knew and creating fantasies in the taste of his own age" (p. 75).?F.
