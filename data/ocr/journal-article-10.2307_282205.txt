Testing and excavation by SWCA of two Hohokam sites-Dutch Canal Ruin and Pueblo Salado-at Phoenix Sky Harbor Center were directed by David Greenwald and Richard Ahlstrom. Work focused on settlement and land use on the Salt River flood plain, including studies of possible buried agri- cultural fields and segments of irrigation canals up to 1.6 km in length. Dutch Canal Ruin is a primarily Preclassic scatter of field houses and canals, with late Classic and Postclassic components. Pueblo Salado consists of a Classic and a Postclassic settlement; in- vestigations contributed to understanding the little- known Postclassic Polvor6n phase. Dawn Greenwald (SWCA) conducted synthetic analysis of both ground- and flaked-stone data to compare project-area sites to similar sites within the Hohokam region. A model of the lithic composition of different site type (field house, farmstead, hamlet, village) assemblages was developed based on previous archaeological data and on expec- tations formed from site-type definitions. Dutch Canal and Pueblo Salado lithic-assemblage patterns were well within the range of variability for each site type. Investigations in the southern portion of the Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport on the eastern extent of Pueblo Salado were directed by David Greenwald (SWCA). One Classic-period habitation area was de- fined. Radiocarbon dates suggest that Canal Salado was used late in the Hohokam sequence, possibly into the protohistoric period. Analysis of ground stone by Dawn Greenwald and Kathleen McQuestion (SWCA) and flaked stone by Dawn Greenwald and Kimberly Spurr (SWCA) on ma- terials recovered from Phoenix Sky Harbor excava- tions revealed intrasite variation in resource-procure- ment strategies through time. Schist and phyllite, used in the manufacture of tabular tools, increased during the Classic and Postclassic periods and were procured primarily from a single source. Obsidian increased in frequency during the Postclassic period and was used as much to procure expedient tools as formal tools. Ground-stone analysis conducted by Dawn Green- wald (SWCA) on materials recovered from the Los Homos Archaeological Project (Richard Ahlstrom, principal investigator [PI]) in the Salt River valley, collected data on subsistence and material-procure- ment strategies. Artifact types supported macrobotan- 739</page><page sequence="2">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY ical and pollen records indicating a mixed subsistence strategy of cultigens and wild plant products. The num- ber of material types used on trough metates and rect- angular manos decreased from the Pioneer to the Co- lonial period, documenting the growing stability of the trough system during its late developmental phase. By the Colonial period, raw material used for the trough system was limited in type and attributes. The Coppermine survey was conducted by SWCA on the Navajo Nation under the direction of David Greenwald and Jean Ann Mercer. Coppermine, located south of Page, has a long but sporadic mining history. Forty-four sites were recorded, and 18 members of the Coppermine Chapter of the Navajo Nation were in- terviewed regarding their knowledge of the use of the area and traditional cultural properties (TCPs). His- toric Navajo, Anasazi, and Archaic sites were present, including the Coppermine Trading Post. Four Anasazi sites along the Coronado Coal Haul Railroad were investigated under the direction of Da- vid Greenwald and Richard Ahlstrom (SWCA). Sites consisted of two BMIII/PI multiple field-house loci, a PII hamlet, and a PII field. Work focused on Cotton- wood Seep, a BMIII area used seasonally for over 300 years. Investigations by the Museum of Northern Ar- izona in 1977 and the current excavations examined over 50 houses; an estimated 200 field houses may be present. Ground-stone analysis by Dawn Greenwald revealed evidence for local production of architectural stone and beads. Three stages of manufacture were indicated for the architectural stone, including slab- lined-pit and vent-framing stones and their covering stones. A bead abrader, blanks, and a sawn piece of debris were evidence of disc-bead manufacture. Vari- ation in production wear on artifacts and the abrader indicates that in the project area disc beads were usually produced individually rather than as strung beads shaped collectively, the process described historically. Analysis of pottery from two BMIII sites (Cottonwood Seep and Cottonwood South) by Kelley Hays-Gilpin (SWCA) identified Mogollon Brown Ware (Woodruff Brown, Red, and Smudged), Lino Gray, and La Plata and White Mountain black-on-whites (A.D. 600-700s), and a previously undescribed soft, sand-tempered, high- iron, reduced gray-brown polished pottery (Puerco Gray-Brown Ware), almost certainly locally made. In earlier levels at Cottonwood South (pre-A.D. 650), this gray-brown polished pottery is the only kind present, and much appears to have been fiber tempered. This local ceramic tradition was neither "Anasazi" nor "Mogollon" but shared characteristics with each and included unique features. Twenty-eight prehistoric sites along the Fence Lake Corridor were tested by SWCA under the direction of David Greenwald. The project revealed that the sites were predominately Anasazi, although a Mogollon presence is suggested in the western portion. Garcia Ranch Ruin, a large PIII village site with a great kiva, was mapped. Douglas Mitchell and David Greenwald (SWCA) be- gan an inventory and evaluation of cultural resources located on Williams Air Force Base. The base is sit- uated on the Queen Creek Delta, a broad alluvial area that contains a number of large prehistoric Hohokam villages. SWCA surveyed approximately 810 ha and identified three previously recorded sites and nine new ones, all occupied between A.D. 700 and 1400. The larger village sites, closest to the Queen Creek alluvium, account for the possible irrigation canal identified. Smaller sites, farther away, may represent specialized activity loci. M. Zyniecki and Jean Ann Mercer (SWCA) directed archaeological and ethnographic surveys in the Navajo Forest. In the 1,685-ha archaeological survey 68 sites were recorded, 60 of them single component and 8 multicomponent. All but 7 sites were associated with the historic or modem Navajo. Four sites had Anasazi components, and 1 had a possible Hopi component. The ethnographic survey covered 5,088 ha, and 11 TCPs were recorded. The TCPs were mostly springs or seeps used for traditional ceremonies. M. Zyniecki and David Greenwald (SWCA) directed excavations at four sites near Navajo. One site was occupied during the PI period, two were PII, and the fourth was PIII. The PI site contained nonlocally pro- duced ceramics, while the PII and PIII sites contained local ceramics indicating changes in ceramic produc- tion and social organization through time. One of the PII sites revealed structure abandonment and reoc- cupation, evidence for on-site ceramic production, and a small piece of a presumably ritual, painted wooden object. M. Zyniecki (SWCA) conducted excavations at Pueblo Viejo, which has a ball court, a platform mound, and three compounds. Excavations revealed a Classic- period Hohokam cremation cemetery with three cre- matoria, 31 secondary cremations, a palisade, and trash deposits. The association of the palisade with the cem- etery is unique. Cremation vessels exhibited use wear, indicating domestic vessels were used. Ceramic-tem- per analysis suggests there was little interaction be- tween the individuals associated with the cemetery and other nearby large Hohokam villages. SWCA (Richard Ahlstrom, PI) investigated the pre- historic Hohokam village of La Ciudad de los Homos, first explored by Frank Hamilton Cushing and the He- menway Expedition in 1887-1888. SWCA recorded 127 features consisting of pithouses, trash pits, pit fea- tures, hornos (pit ovens), and cremation and inhu- mation burials. The remains included one of the most substantial early Pioneer-period components ever ex- cavated. Features at the site dated from the Vahki phase (ca. A.D. 300-500) through the Sacaton phase (ca. A.D. 1000-1150). David Phillips (SWCA) directed a monitoring pro- ject at the Paloparado site in Santa Cruz County. Five Classic-period burials, a pithouse, and 20 other fea- tures were exposed. Based on the current work, the site is more extensive than previously known. Paloparado apparently was not the historic village of San Cayetano; the primary components date to the late Colonial through Classic periods. The skeletal series shows signs of malnutrition, despite evidence for a broad subsis- tence base. David Phillips (SWCA) conducted a 258-ha survey of a proposed slurry-pond location near Willcox Playa. The survey recorded one possible Archaic site, one Pefiasco-phase Mogollon site, and part of a Euroam- 740 [Vol. 58, No. 4, 1993]</page><page sequence="3">CURRENT RESEARCH erican habitation site. The two prehistoric sites were tested and it was found that they were largely destroyed by plowing. David Phillips (SWCA) directed a data-recovery program at an artifact scatter at the base of the Whet- stone Mountains in Kartchner Caverns State Park. Sur- face collection recovered over 30,000 pieces of flaked stone from a 7.6-ha area. Lithic analysis by Mark Slaughter and Susan Bierer (SWCA) indicated the pres- ence of at least eight distinct subsite loci, dating pri- marily from the middle Archaic to the Formative pe- riods. A Clovis-point base also was found. The scatter probably represented repeated encampments utilizing resources in the Whetstones. David Phillips and Mark Slaughter (SWCA) com- pleted archaeological testing and data recovery at AZ BB:9:144 ASM, a small middle Rincon site on the upper bajada in the Tucson Basin. Remains included a midden of horno refuse and a heavily disturbed hab- itation or activity area. Phillips and Slaughter (SWCA) conducted test ex- cavations at AZ BB:9:50 ASM, a large Tanque Verde phase village in the Tucson Basin. A dense occupation zone 200 m in diameter centered on a walled com- pound, along with a peripheral area of scattered oc- cupation loci, activity loci, and dry-farming features. The testing also located an adobe structure probably related to the historic ranch at Gibbon Springs. Phillips and Thomas N. Motsinger (SWCA) directed excavations at the Maja site in the southern Avra Val- ley. The Hohokam field-house site dates to the Tanque Verde phase of the Classic period (1-sigma 14C range 730 ? 80 B.P. [Beta-59949]) and consists of a pithouse and two extramural roasting pits distributed around an activity area. The site is one of a series chosen for their ak chin farming potential. Test excavations directed by Motsinger (SWCA) at the Gila Butte site, a large Hohokam village dating from the Pioneer through the Classic periods, have revealed at least three canals and associated agricul- tural features. One large main canal may be an up- stream component of the Classic-period channel of the Snaketown Canal. As a component of the Arizona Historic Preserva- tion Plan, Mark Slaughter, Lee Fratt, Kirk Anderson, and Richard Ahlstrom (SWCA) developed a manual for evaluating and identifying lithic sites in Arizona. This volume summarizes the flaked-stone and ground- stone artifact types, identifies the major raw-material sources, distinguishes the different property types of lithic sites, presents criteria for evaluating integrity, and address the significance of lithic sites and potential research avenues. David R. Wilcox, of the Museum of Northern Ari- zona (MNA), continues work on writing up the results of the MNA/Northern Arizona University (NAU) field school that ran from 1985 to 1990. Most recently the complex Cohonina site of Juniper Terrace (NA 1814) was mapped. Wilcox (MNA) and Curtis Hinsley (NAU) are pre- paring a documentary history of the Hemenway Ex- pedition led by Frank Hamilton Cushing from 1886 to 1889. Inventory of the holdings of the Huntington Free Library, Heye Foundation, and Brooklyn Muse- um is complete, and transcription into an eight-volume computer data base is underway. During the past year the Hopi Cultural Preservation Office (HCPO) under the administration of Leigh Jen- kins, director, with the technical assistance of Kurt Dongoske, tribal archaeologist, continues its efforts to- ward the preservation of Hopi cultural sites both on and off the Hopi Reservation. The HCPO is in the process of finalizing the report for a cultural-resources inventory along State Route 264 from the Coconino-Navajo County line to its junc- tion with SR 87. Mike Yeats (PI), directed the inven- tory of this 39.3-km-long segment of road, which runs across the top of both Third and Second Mesas. A total of 48 archaeological sites and 20 TCPs was identified. Four additional TCPs that had been destroyed by high- way construction were identified through ethnohistoric work. Ethnographic interviews and archival research also identified impacts to orchards and other agricul- tural features. Many of the orchards are eligible as his- toric properties. The HCPO, under the supervision of Katherine Johnson, has been conducting cultural-resource inven- tories in conjunction with a number of smaller projects on the reservation. Inventories are routinely performed for outside agencies (Arizona Public Service, Indian Health Service [IHS], and Office of Navajo/Hopi In- dian Relocation [ONHIR]) on development projects such as water/sewer lines, power lines, and relocation homesites. Larger developmental projects requiring cultural-resource inventories this year include the de- velopment of a new community for Hopi relocatees near Spider Mound by both ONHIR and IHS, and the installation of a water/sewer system within the village of Hotevilla by IHS. Inventories for developments that are the initiatives of the tribal government are also performed by HCPO, in lieu of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, for range management and development pro- jects. The HCPO performed a cultural-resources inven- tory for the village of Kykotsmovi, which is planning to build a senior citizens community center. The Con- solidated Villages of First Mesa are implementing a plan to construct a shopping center. This project has been developed and accepted by the SHPO for the implementation of test excavations to determine sub- surface extent and National Register of Historic Places eligibility. The HCPO will be conducting an intensive mapping effort of the Village of Bacavi and the adjacent terraced gardens. Ethnographic consultants from the Village of Bacavi will be employed in the identification of the extent of the village and the nature, sensitivity, and subsequent treatment of features mapped. This map will be part of the document used to nominate the Village of Bacavi to the National Register as a Historic District. The HCPO was awarded a grant from the National Park Service (NPS) Grants to Native Americans and Alaskans for Historic Preservation program to pur- chase surveillance equipment to be installed at the site of Kawaika'a. The site of Kawaika'a is a PIII-PIV pueblo that according to Hopi oral history was the first site where the Spanish encoantered the Hopi. Over the 741</page><page sequence="4">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY past few years, Kawaika'a has experienced extensive vandalism due to pothunters. The HCPO represents the Hopi Tribe as an active participant in the Glen Canyon Environmental Studies and the Glen Canyon Dam Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). Ethnohistoric research, conducted by T. J. Ferguson (Institute of the North American West [INAW] and Eric Polingyouma (HCPO), continues into past and continuing use of the Grand Canyon region by the Hopi. The Hopi Tribe is also represented on the Cooperating Agencies Group, which is charged with overseeing the development of the EIS, the EIS Writing Team, and the management group that will oversee the long-term monitoring of the impacts to the Grand Can- yon and the development of management recommen- dations for dam operations. This spring, a program- matic agreement between the affected Tribes, Bureau of Reclamation, and the NPS should be finalized which delineates the process for treatment of cultural re- sources affected by dam operations as required under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966. The HCPO recently completed an ethnohistoric study of Hopi use of Zuni Salt Lake (Sio Onga) in a collab- orative project with INAW. This work was done under contract as part of the development of a coal mine near Fence Lake. The coal mine will be located approxi- mately 19 km to the northeast of the Zuni Salt Lake. The Project area also includes a 64-km-long transpor- tation corridor connecting the proposed mine with the Coronado Generating Station near St. Johns. T. J. Fer- guson and Eric Polingyouma (HCPO) directed the pro- ject and coauthored a report on their findings. The HCPO fielded a team of four Hopi Cultural advisors who conducted extensive fieldwork with Ferguson and Polingyouma to locate, describe, and evaluate Hopi cultural properties in and near the project area. Twenty elders from the 10 clans and five Hopi villages were also interviewed to collect ethnographic information about Hopi use of pilgrimage trails to Zuni Salt Lake bisected by the Fence Lake Mine Transportation cor- ridor. Given the sensitive and proprietary nature of the ethnographic data collected for the project, Ferguson and Polingyouma's report was intensively reviewed by an 18-member Cultural Resources Advisory Task Team composed of elders from all the Hopi Villages. The review was essential to ensure that all information in- cluded in the report is both accurate and appropriate for presentation to the Salt River Project and state and federal regulators. A decision on whether or not to release the Hopi report to the public for scholarly use is still pending. INAW also worked with the Zuni Tribe, the Acoma Tribe, and the Ramah Band of the Navajo to conduct similar ethnohistorical studies for the Fence Lake Mine project for those tribes. E. Richard Hart, A. E. Dittert, and Ward Alan Minge (all INAW), Andrew Othole of the Zuni Archaeology Program, and Jean Ann Mercer of SWCA conducted research and prepared reports on those components of the project. James M. McKie (Prescott National Forest) con- ducted an archaeological survey of 1,079 ha along the upper Hassayampa River. The purpose of the survey was to locate and assess all prehistoric and historic properties. Twenty-nine sites were located, represented by PII/early PIII Prescott tradition occupations, along with historic mining and possibly historic Yavapai sites. Of special interest was the discovery of several large PII/early PIII pueblos. Such occupations are known to exist in the greater Prescott area and are typically as- sociated with grassland and chaparral resource areas. However, the upper Hassayampa pueblos are situated in a ponderosa-pine habitat where the subsistence strategy may have varied from their grassland/chap- arral counterparts. John Whittaker and Kathryn Kamp of Grinnell Col- lege (GC), conducted an archaeological field school near Flagstaff at New Caves, an extensive complex of more than 100 pueblo rooms on the Crest of O'Neill Crater. Research is focused on comparing a large site that has special features and may be central to the settlement system with nearby small sites more typical of the Sinagua. Testing a large (10-x-7.5-m interior) "community room" yielded massive masonry walls but lacked the expected benches, roof-support posts, and fire features. Two pueblo rooms were excavated; results so far indicate close similarity to smaller Elden- phase sites. Joel Clark (GC) led continuing survey of surrounding area. Under the direction of J. Scott Wood, The Tonto National Forest completed over 250 projects, bringing its inventory to over 7,200 sites. The Forest cospon- sored the Second Salado Conference held in Globe, Arizona, where over 40 papers were presented on ce- ramics, architecture, and site-settlement patterns. The conference proceedings along with a popular Forest history overview were also published. The Homol'ovi Research Program's third season of excavations were conducted at the fourteenth-century ancestral Hopi village of Homol'ovi II. Excavations in five kivas indicate all were burned, and some entomb individuals who died violently. The total number of kivas at Homol'ovi II is now estimated at 40. Part of the late pueblo covers an extensive pithouse village dating to the twelfth century. The presence of Sikyatki Polychrome in all major excavated two-story com- ponents of the pueblo suggest occupation can be revised to A.D. 1330-1400. E. Charles Adams and Richard C. Lange (Arizona State Museum) served as PIs. A small excavation project at the Adobe Pueblo site was conducted in order to assess the site's interpretive potential by the Homol'ovi Research Program (Doug- las W. Gann, PI). The site was seen to be unique in that formed adobe bricks were used as the main ar- chitectural component. Eight surface structures and one pit structure were located and excavated. Seven of the surface structures were found to be damaged by road grading. Despite this damage, detailed measurements for 28 adobe bricks were recorded. The adobe bricks were seen to be very regular in form, without any ob- vious organic temper. William Doelle and Bruce Huckell (Desert Archae- ology [DA]) tested over 20 ha adjacent to the Santa Cruz River; the area contained three spatially discrete loci. Two proved to be portions of Sedentary-period Hohokam settlements (ca. A.D. 950-1100), while the third was an early ceramic-period pithouse village with 742 [Vol. 58, No. 4, 1993]</page><page sequence="5">CURRENT RESEARCH 80-100 pithouses. The latters ceramic assemblage was predominately plainware with an approximately five percent redware; a pooled, calibrated average of four radiocarbon dates suggests that it was probably occu- pied at approximately A.D. 600-650. All are part of the large Valencia site community. DA completed their third and final field phase of the Roosevelt Community Development Study under the direction of Mark Elson, Douglass Craig, and Deborah Swartz. The work involved the excavation or testing of 29 sites. Investigations during the third phase fo- cused on two early Classic period (A.D. 1150-1300) platform-mound sites (Meddler and Pyramid Point) and the Griffin Wash site, a 100-room cobble-masonry pueblo also dating to the early Classic period. The first tree-ring dates recovered from the Tonto Basin suggest that the Meddler platform mound was constructed af- ter A.D. 1277(vv). An early ceramic-period pithouse component at the Eagle Ridge site was also investi- gated. The site contains around 40 pithouses and dates between 100 B.C. and A.D. 400. DA conducted several small monitoring and exca- vation projects near the intersection of Church Ave. and Alameda St. in present-day downtown Tucson un- der the direction of William Doelle, PI. Occupational horizons include prehistoric Preclassic Hohokam, Spanish Colonial, and nineteenth-century Tohono O'odham and Euroamerican. The 68 features identi- fied include prehistoric trash pits, a segment of Tuc- son's Spanish- and/or Mexican-period presidio wall, part of the presidio cemetery, and nineteenth-century building foundations and walls, privies, and trash de- posits. Phase II of the Lower San Pedro Survey south of Redington was initiated under the direction of James Bayman and Allen Dart (DA). The project seeks to identify Hohokam/Salado communities and post-A.D. 1450 sites. The 64 archaeological sites documented include artifact scatters, agricultural terraces and other features, rectangular stone enclosures, apparent pit- house depressions, and four places of possible Sobai- puri (early O'odham) occupation. DA excavated at the Julian Wash site (AZ BB:13: 17), a large prehistoric pithouse village site located on the east bank of the Santa Cruz River south of down- town Tucson (William Doelle, PI). The main features excavated included five pithouses grouped in an arc around a courtyard area with hearths and pits, several trash piles and pits behind them, and the postholes of a ramada structure with associated grinding slabs. Among the artifacts recovered were a grooved stone axe with ochre stains, pottery polishing stones, a pro- jectile point, ceramic spindle whorls, a number of res- torable ceramic vessels, and a fragment of a Hohokam figurine. Temper analyses of the ceramics indicate that most of the pottery was probably manufactured at two villages on the opposite bank of the river within 4 km of the site. According to typological identifications of the associated decorated pottery sherds, archaeomag- netic assays, and radiocarbon analyses, all of the in- vestigated features date to the middle/late Rincon phase transition in the Tucson Basin Hohokam sequence, between about A.D. 1070 and 1150. Mark Hackbarth (Northland Research [NRI]) di- rected data-recovery investigations at seven small sites near Payson for the Tonto National Forest. All seven sites consisted of low-density artifact scatters; three sites included masonry structures and rock alignments. The sites probably represent seasonally occupied loci. Competing settlement-system models of winter vs. summer occupation are being assessed. Absolute evi- dence for the sites temporal and cultural affiliations are generally lacking. William Marmaduke (NRI) completed analysis of the materials recovered during the El Paso Natural Gas San Juan Mainline excavations of five prehistoric and four historic sites in northern Arizona. Archaic lithic scatters and temporary Cohonina habitation loci were evaluated for information related to settlement pat- tems. The Cohonina lithic assemblages closely resem- ble the Archaic sites and suggest seasonal, hunting- related use west of Flagstaff. Thin sections of ceramics identified a tempering agent from the southern Chino Valley. Two historic trash dumps and two homesteads were investigated. Archival evidence for the farm- steads suggests a late nineteenth-century occupation. Todd Howell (NRI) completed a data-recovery pro- ject at Los Guanacos. Excavations uncovered a portion of the Classic-period Hohokam village, which included pit-structure and adobe-compound architecture, pits and hornos, and human remains. Analysis of the cul- tural materials is ongoing and focused on issues of subsistence, chronology building through seriation, and site abandonment. Kathleen Henderson and Mark Hackbarth (NRI) are currently investigating 17 Sedentary- and Classic-pe- riod Hohokam sites on the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community. Test excavations confirm that the sites represent 10 small farmsteads or limited-activity loci, six large habitation sites, and a prehistoric canal. Additional branches of the prehistoric Scottsdale canal system were recognized from aerial photographs and ground inspection. Mark Hackbarth (NRI) completed excavations at Verde Park, which lies northeast of the original Phoe- nix townsite and which contained the city's first wa- terworks and transit railway facility. Two habitation structures (1893-1935), the 1889-1934 waterworks, an 1893-1907 building for the electric trolley system, and associated structures were investigated. A study of eco- nomic class distributions and growth in Phoenix was conducted as a prelude to a reevaluation of previous archaeological research in the original townsite of Phoenix. Although substantial disparities in wealth were evident in Phoenix, ceramic assemblages did not reflect these differences. William Marmaduke and Steve Dosh (NRI) have completed two archaeological surveys in the Yuma Proving Grounds. Excavation and analysis of desert upland sites with rock rings and cleared circles contin- ues. Preliminary observations suggest that none of the features are older than 2,000 years. It has been spec- ulated that regeneration of the natural desert pavement may obscure earlier clearings. Jeffery A. Homburg and Jeffery H. Altschul (Statis- tical Research [SR]) published the results of a cultural- resources sample survey in the northeastern Barry M. Goldwater Range. A total of 4,253 ha was surveyed on 743</page><page sequence="6">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY three proposed helicopter gunnery ranges, resulting in the indication of 93 prehistoric and 13 historic com- ponents. Among these were Patayan, Hohokam, and Tohono O'odham settlements. A predictive model was developed that indicated the area was used in a similar fashion throughout prehistory. Stephanie M. Whittlesey, Richard S. Ciolek-Torrello and Steve D. Shelley (SR), completed the excavation of a small Colonial-period farmstead, AZ DD:7:22 ASM, near Arivaca. Architecture and subsistence pat- terns differ substantially from typical Hohokam prac- tices. Results indicate an indigenous people that inter- acted intensively with Trincheras populations of northern Sonora and with Hohokam populations re- siding in the Tucson and Phoenix basins. This is the first site in Arizona affiliated with the Trincheras cul- ture to be excavated. SR conducted a number of research projects on lands used and managed by Fort Huachuca. Ronald H. Towner and Jeffery H. Altschul (SR) completed a study of the Garden Canyon and Rappell Cliffs pictograph sites, which are associated with Formative and Apache occupations. Clement W. Meighan recorded the rock art, and Antoinette Padgett supervised the removal of the historic graffiti. In conjunction with the Garden Canyon panel study two rockshelters were excavated, one with sequential but closely spaced occupations dat- ing to the middle A.D. 1200s. Rein van der Pot (SR) completed survey on 8,910 ha of land on the fort and documented 175 sites dating from the Archaic through the Formative and Historic periods. Among the di- verse types of sites encountered are many rockpile fea- tures. Current interpretations of these phenomenon are that they are food-processing rather than agricultural or water-control features. Ronald H. Towner and Jeffery H. Altschul (SR) con- tinue to survey the upper part of the San Pedro Ar- chaeological Project. The project is testing a model of Classic-period settlement in the upper San Pedro River valley and intends to continue its work across the in- ternational border into Mexico, in conjunction with Cesar Quijada Lopez, Director del Centro Regional Sonora, Instituto Nacional de Antropologia e Historia, Hermosillo. Robert B. Neily (SR) tested a small habitation site (AZ EE:9:151 ASM) on the Buena Vista Ranch near Nogales. The site has Trincheras through historical- period components. SR has completed a variety of survey and docu- mentation projects in the lower Colorado and lower Gila river drainages. One of these projects was con- ducted by Joan Schneider (SR), who documented the Antelope Hill site along the lower Gila River. The locality primarily served as a ground-stone quarry with evidence of the manufacture of arkosic sandstone pes- tles, metates, and possibly manos. Rock-art panels, rock shelters, milling slicks, historic structures, and the location of a Butterfield Stage stagecoach stop were also recorded at the site. Jim Holmlund (SRI) completed a 232-ha survey of the Rippley Intaglio locality. A total of 482 features and 16,000 m of prehistoric and historic trails were recorded. Cultural resources included geoglyphs, in- taglios, rock alignments, dance circles, trails and trail markers, lithic-reduction areas, and artifact scatters. Joseph A. Ezzo (SR) conducted a 2,430-ha survey in the vicinity of Pilot Knob, Senator Wash, and Palo Verde Point along the lower Colorado River. Of par- ticular importance are the examples of lower Colorado River prehistoric (Patayan) and historic (Yuman- speaking peoples) rock art, geoglyphs, and a wide range of anthropomorphic, zoomorphic, and geometric in- taglios. Kim G. McClure (SR) surveyed 405 ha in the vicinity of Mittry Lake. Two prehistoric (an Archaic campsite and a prehistoric/protohistoric petroglyph site) and nine historic (ranging from prospector claims, work and mining camps, and a homestead, to the Laguna Dam) sites were recorded. Richard S. Ciolek-Torrello and Mark T. Swanson (SR) are completing a report on the excavation of a multicomponent, Hohokam through historic Territo- rial-period site on Block 180 within the historic Pre- sidio District of downtown Tucson. The prehistoric component is badly disturbed, but appears to represent a late Pioneer-early Colonial period farmstead or small hamlet. Over 100 historic features, primarily dating to the Territorial period, were investigated, including his- toric house foundations, privies, wells, and trash de- posits. Some of the most unusual features found were three extremely large trash-filled borrow pits that may represent some of the earliest attempts at communal refuse disposal in Tucson. Results indicate distinctions in the material culture of ethnic groups and, contrary to previous ideas, the arrival of the railroad in 1880 had relatively little immediate impact on lifestyles. Ciolek-Torrello, Ruth Van Dyke, and Chester Shaw (SR) are completing a report on the excavation of an early Formative-period site (AZ BB: 13:398 ASM) at the confluence of the Tanque Verde Creek and Agua Caliente washes. Results indicate the presence of a semisedentary hamlet with fully developed architec- ture and formative ceramic and flaked lithic assem- blages. Projectile points, bifaces, and ground-stone tools are holdovers from the late Archaic period. Architec- ture and ceramics suggest that the Houghton Road site is part of a widespread early Formative tradition with strong indications of Mogollon traits rather than Ho- hokam traits, which became established later. Lee W. Lindsay, Jr. and Jeffery H. Altschul (SR) have completed test excavation at a small base camp (AZ BB: 13:392 ASM) on Davis-Monthan Air Force Base. The site is a desert-plant-processing and hunting base camp. Director of Public Education Programs Carol Ellick is developing a permanent exhibit at the air base for public interpretation. Christopher J. Doolittle has completed excavations at the Badger Hole site (AZ AA: 12:40 ASM), a late Rincon-phase Hohokam site originally recorded by Joe Ben Wheat, for Inca Investments Company, prior to the construction of housing units. Excavated portions of the site revealed the remains of four pithouses and numerous extramural features. SR continues to conduct field research in the vicinity of Horsehoe and Bartlett Dams along the lower Verde River northeast of Phoenix. This project, on the lands of the Tonto National Forest, represents the first major excavation within this extremely rich archaeological region that was previously known almost exclusively from survey. The project is under the direction of Rich- 744 [Vol. 58, No. 4, 1993]</page><page sequence="7">CURRENT RESEARCH ard Ciolek-Torrello, Stephanie M. Whittlesey, Steven D. Shelly, and Jeffery Homburg (SR). Nineteen sites are currently being investigated in the Horseshoe area with seven more in the Bartlett Region. SR is also conducting a multifaceted study of the region's agri- cultural sites and subsistence resources that involves soil, paleobotanical, geomorphic, vegetation, ethnoh- istoric, and ethnoarchaeological studies. A ceramic and lithic sourcing study has also been initiated. A regional overview is being prepared that will link the lower Verde to other areas of central Arizona. Preliminary results suggest that indigenous populations of the re- gion were deeply involved in the Hohokam regional system during most of the Preclassic period. By the end of this period their interaction with the Hohokam was truncated, and they apparently became isolated, developing their distinctive cultural patterns. William L. Deaver (SR) surveyed 810 ha of land on the Florence Military Reservation in Florence. Over 60 sites were recorded, most of which were agricultural in nature, representing both runoff- and irrigation-based adaptations. Donn R. Grenda (SR) surveyed 810 ha of land on the Navajo Depot near Williams. Sites assigned to the Archaic through the Formative and into the post-World War II period were recorded. Of particular note were separate work camps and living quarters that were used by Navajo and Hopi workers who served the military to support Army activities during and shortly after World War II. Joseph A. Ezzo (SR) surveyed some 1,130 ha in the vicinity of the communities of Round Rock, Many Farms, and Ganado. The project was designed to eval- uate cultural resources prior to the rehabilitation of earthen dams on Navajo Nation lands. Prehistoric ar- tifact scatters were limited to the Anasazi PII and PIII periods. Scott J. Russell (SR) evaluated the status of TCPs on this project and learned that sacred sites in- cluding lightning-struck rocks, springs, and eagle-nest- ing grounds were in or adjacent to the project area. Stephanie M. Whittlesey and Jeffery A. Homburg (SRI) completed the report of excavations at Lee Can- yon near Cameron. Two multicomponent Kayenta An- asazi farmsteads with major occupations in the A.D. 11 00s were investigated. The first agricultural features found in the upper basin were excavated. Results con- firm the Kayenta Anasazi pattern of exploiting a wide array of wild resources, especially pinon, in addition to a firm commitment to maize agriculture. Petro- graphic studies of Anasazi ceramics indicate probable local manufacture of Tsegi Orange Ware as well as importation of ceramics from as far away as the Pres- cott region. Carla R. Van West and Richard S. Ciolek-Torrello (SR) excavated four structures dating to the late PI/ early PII and middle to late PII periods in Holbrook. The Archer site (AZ P:4:22 ASM) exhibits occupation and use as early as BMIII times and as late as early PIII. Connections with the Kayenta, Cibola, Little Col- orado, Sinagua, Mogollon, and Hohokam culture areas are inferred. Paleobotanical analyses suggest a repeated summer and early fall use of the site for at least the late PI through late PII period. Cultural &amp; Environmental Systems (C&amp;ES), contin- ued an ongoing study in the Silver Bell Mountains northwest of Tucson. Directed by Laurie V. Slawson and Ronald P. Maldonado (C&amp;ES), over 2,025 ha have been surveyed (100 percent coverage), 21 sites record- ed, and testing and mitigation conducted at 10 sites. The focus of the 1992 fieldwork was on the limited testing of an early Pioneer-period Hohokam village and the mitigation of two historic cemeteries, two historic mining camps, and two Sedentary-Classic period Ho- hokam limited-activity sites. The historic sites are as- sociated with the mining town of Silverbell, which was established in 1903 and abandoned by 1930. C&amp;ES conducted data-recovery excavation at a his- toric mining camp located south of Tucson. Directed by Laurie V. Slawson and Ronald P. Maldonado (C&amp;ES), surface collections and excavation concen- trated on a light-density trash scatter and a habitation feature that was a temporary dwelling. Initial analysis of the artifacts recovered from the camp suggests a time of occupation of 1900 to 1930. Archival investigations revealed that the camp was associated with the Prince Rupert claim, which was first recorded in 1896 as part of the Vulcan Mine. Limited testing and data-recovery excavations were conducted by C&amp;ES in Tucson, at two Sedentary-pe- riod Hohokam sites. Directed by Laurie V. Slawson (C&amp;ES), the purpose of the fieldwork was to define the subsurface extent of the sites within a road right-of- way. Although no subsurface evidence of the village site was found, a roasting-pit feature was identified during testing of the limited-activity site. A data-re- covery excavation was undertaken of the roasting pit, which yielded a date of occupation, based on ceramics, of A.D. 1050-1150. A data-recovery program was directed by Laurie V. Slawson and Ronald P. Maldonado (C&amp;ES) in Tucson, at a Hohokam Sedentary-Classic period village that was occupied between A.D. 1000 and 1300. Two fea- tures, a pithouse and a cremation, evidenced a tran- sition in prehistoric cultural practices. At the time of its destruction, the pithouse was being remodeled from a shape characteristic of Preclassic and early Classic houses to that of a rectangular style diagnostic of the late Classic period. The cremation, which consisted of the in situ cremation of a fully extended body, illus- trated burial practices that are transitional between the late Sedentary and early Classic period. Ronald P. Maldonado (C&amp;ES) directed the limited testing of a middle to late Archaic period limited-ac- tivity site in the Santa Catalina Mountains north of Tucson. The site consisted of a moderate to heavy- density artifact scatter of chipped stone and projectile points. When originally recorded in 1983, the site cov- ered about 1 ha. However, prior to the start of the testing program, development had severely impacted the site. Following surface collection, test units were excavated within the site, but no subsurface features were found. It was determined that Hohokam reuse of the site had occurred. Directed by Laurie V. Slawson and Ronald P. Mal- donado, C&amp;ES conducted a cultural-resources inven- tory of 1,130 ha near Kearny. As a part of this project, 730 previously unsurveyed hectares were examined. Four sites were found, including a Hohokam picto- graph and limited-activity site, a Hohokam agricultural field and lithic-scatter site that is associated with a 745</page><page sequence="8">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY similar site found in 1991, a historical-period home- stead ranch site, and a historic mining-related habi- tation site. Victoria Clark, Navajo Nation Archaeology De- partment, Northern Arizona University (NNAD- NAU), excavated four PIll-period (including at least three Tsegi phase) pithouses and one probable PII pit- house in an Indian Health Service waterline right-of- way near Red Lake. The structures are 40 m distant from a Tsegi-phase masonry pueblo. The PIII pit- houses were dug into PI and PII period trash deposits, and most were filled with Tsegi-phase Trash. One Tse- gi-phase pithouse contained 2 human burials with no offerings. Lumps of volcanic ash were found, probable evidence of pottery manufacture. Tusayan Black-on- white pottery from the site is tempered with identical ash, and is similar to late Tusayan White Ware sherds found throughout Red Valley, the Klethla Valley, Long House Valley, and as far north as Navajo Mountain. Miranda Warburton (NNAD-NAU, PI), Phil Geib (project director [PD]), Lanita Van Nimwegen (lab di- rector), and Kelley Hays-Gilpin (ceramic specialist) completed significance and extent testing of 40 pre- historic sites in the Inscription House to Navajo Moun- tain Road (N 16) right-of-way. Sites range in time from Archaic to the Tsegi phases (late PIII). Preliminary ceramic analysis by Hays-Gilpin shows that on the right-of-way nearest to Navajo Mountain a shift from coarse quartz sand-tempered Tusayan Gray Ware to utility ware with high-iron clay and local crushed sand- stone temper begins as early as the late PII period and is nearly complete by the late PIII period, when utility assemblages are dominated by sandstone-tempered Rainbow Gray. The proportion of decorated ware that is Tusayan White Ware decreases relative to Tsegi Or- ange Ware as one moves north along the right-of-way, at least for the PIII period. Ash-tempered Flagstaff and Tusayan black-on-whites, presumed to have been im- ported from the Cow Springs area to the south make up a large proportion of the Tusayan White Ware in the Navajo Mountain area. Miranda Warburton (NNAD-NAU), G. L. Berlin (Geography, NAU), and D. Ortiz (Anthropology, NAU) examined indirect impacts on archaeological sites in the Sanders Rural Community (New Lands), using re- mote-sensing techniques (aerial photography, ground- penetrating radar). Included is an assessment of TCPs, historical-period and prehistoric trails, and roads. Lanita Van Nimwegen (NNAD-NAU) completed excavation of AZ-P-54-10 NNAD, a small farmstead site near Sanders. The PII-period component is part of the Sanders Great House Community. The PIII-IV component may be related to the Emigrant Springs site about 1.6 km to the south of NNAD's excavation. Stanley A. Ahler's (University of North Dakota) report on chipped stone from the site is probably the most extensive treatment of expedient lithic technology from the New Lands area to date. Reid Nelson (NNAD-NAU) mapped, tested, and surface collected a PII artifact scatter (AZ-I-4-31 NNAD) in the Chinle Valley. Two pithouses (undated) were discovered during pipeline trenching. Larry Benallie of the Navajo Nation Archaeology Department (NNAD) conducted an archaeological in- ventory of a waterline system between Kintiel (Wide Ruins) and Klagetoh (Anthony Klesert, PI). A total of 111 archaeological sites has been recorded in the area. Survey data indicate that there was occupation of the Kintiel area from the BMIII through Historic Navajo periods. The Bad Dog Ridge site complex (a BMIII pithouse village) was recorded. A minimum of 43 pit structures are present on the site, including two great kivas. Three Chaco-style Great Houses have also been located in the project area. The results suggest that the Kintiel area was an important western focus for the Chacoan Anasazi. Larry Benallie (NNAD) conducted a reinventory and rerecording of 11 archaeological sites in the Tselani area (Anthony Klesert, PI). Sites recorded dated pri- marily to the PII period; a late 1800s Navajo site was also recorded. One of the prehistoric sites had a scat- tering of Hopi Yellow Ware sherds indicating that the Tselani area may have remained important to the Hopi people from the PIV period through early historic times. Douglas D. Dykeman (NNAD) directed excavations of five sites for the Office of Navajo Hopi Indian Re- location. Preliminary results indicate that two sites are activity areas of unknown cultural affiliation, another site is a PII-III activity area, and the remaining two sites are early Mogollon habitations. The habitations consist of multiple small pit structures. Associated with the structures are very large extramural storage pits and small roasting pits. The recovery of physical re- mains of corn, beans, squash, and gourds at these sites has implications for the early development of agricul- ture in the region. Chester Shaw, Jr. (NNAD) (Anthony Klesert, PI) directed the survey of a 1,620-ha block north of the Chacoan "outlier" known as the Chambers Great House, near Chambers. Survey revealed over 230 pre- historic and historical-period sites, with many sites dating to horizons prior to Great House construction. The latter finding suggests that the Chacoan movement into areas outside of Chaco Canyon was dictated, at least in part, by the presence of large extant populations to participate in regional exchange. Moreover, based on a 700-year-long, climate-sensitive tree-ring chro- nology from Wide Ruins, it is possible to correlate pre- great-house population growth in the Chambers area with a climatic interval optimal to agriculture. The view is that due to this protracted interval of optimal local climate, groups intensified agricultural produc- tion, population-growth rates accelerated, and these factors combined to make this area attractive to Chaco Canyon entrepreneurs. A cultural-resource inventory along N-4 (2-3) near Chinle was conducted under the direction of Peter J. Kakos (NNAD) (Anthony L. Klesert, PI). Nine ar- chaeological sites were inventoried and assessed for further testing and data recovery. Possible Archaic pe- riod, Anasazi, and Navajo sites are present within a dunal-ridge environment. Anasazi sites date from A.D. 750 to 1100 and consist mainly of sherd and lithic scatters and some probable surface structures. A pre- 1940 Navajo habitation site contains a hogan, ash pile, and three corral areas. A possible Archaic camp con- 746 [Vol. 58, No. 4, 1993]</page><page sequence="9">CURRENT RESEARCH tains milling equipment, evidence of lithic reduction, and possible hearths. The Upper Basin Archaeological Research Project (UBARP), was directed by Alan P. Sullivan (Univer- sity of Cincinnati [UC]). Students and staff from UC, Harvard, and the University of Minnesota excavated a 4-5 room Kayenta Anasazi site (MU 125) in the Tusayan Ranger District, Kaibab National Forest. Two tree-ring dates from a burned circular structure (pos- sible kiva) indicate occupation between A.D. 1070 and 1080; several maize fragments were recovered. Survey in the upper basin located an additional 64 sites, bring- ing the total to 236 sites in an 11-sq-km area. A survey area of 5 km on the east flank of the Juniper Mountains west of Chino Valley was conducted by Plateau Mountain Desert Research (PMDR). Directed by Donald E. Weaver, Jr. (PMDR), the survey resulted in the identification of eight sites, including four Ar- chaic-period sites and four ceramic-period Prescott culture sites. At the Archaic sites, ranging in size from 30 to 60, 100, and 600 m across, 2, 4, 31, and 63 potentially diagnostic points were recovered, respec- tively, primarily Pinto-San Jose (68), with Chiricahua (9), San Pedro (3), Elko (3), Gypsum (2), Amargosa (1), and Bajada (1) types identified. The Archaic sites probably contain intact buried features and/or cultural deposits. Two Paleoindian points (Eden and Folsom types) were also identified in the project area. The Ar- chaic sites constitute one of the largest concentrations of Archaic materials known in Arizona. A survey of 31.5 km2 around Bagdad was completed by PMDR. The survey, directed by Donald E. Weaver, Jr. (PMDR), identified 27 archaeological sites, includ- ing five artifact scatters, 22 artifact scatters with fea- tures (grinding slicks, hearths, roasting pits, lithic sources, rockshelters, rock structures, and probable pithouses) and one petroglyph cluster associated with grinding features. The sites span a period of at least 7,000 years from 5000 B.C. to about A.D. 1860, and include primarily Prescott culture sites, with Archaic, Cerbat, Pai, and historic Yavapai sites as well. PMDR surveyed 810 ha in the Prescott National Forest (Donald Weaver, PI) that had been identified for juniper eradication. The area had initially been subjected to a juniper push in 1954. Of particular in- terest was the identification of four Archaic-period sites, one of which exceeds 40 ha. A total of 113 diagnostic points was collected and subsequently analyzed indi- cating that the sites date primarily from the early and middle Archaic, although the entire Archaic is repre- sented. Additionally, an Eden-point fragment (rhyo- lite) and a Folsom base fragment (obsidian) were col- lected. Plans to date the Folsom base fragment are underway. The Pueblo Grande Project (Soil Systems [SS]) en- tered its fifth and final year culminating in an eight- volume final report due to be published in the fall of 1993. Directed by Cory Breternitz, Chris Robinson, and Michael Foster, the Pueblo Grande Project rep- resents the largest effort ever undertaken at a single site in the American Southwest. Over 3.75 million dollars and 37 person years of effort in the field and 73 person years of effort on analysis and write-up were devoted to the project. The project results have altered a num- ber of previously held beliefs about Hohokam local and regional exchange, chronology, population density, social organization, and health. The third year of fieldwork has been completed for the Roosevelt Platform Mound Study in the vicinity of Roosevelt Lake. The project is directed by Glen Rice and Charles Redman, Arizona State University (ASU). The excavation of the fifth and last platform mound, the Cline Terrace Mound (AZ U:4:33 ASM), was con- ducted under the direction of David B. Jacobs (ASU). This formally laid out community dated to the four- teenth and fifteenth centuries, and consisted of two main mound areas connected by a raised walkway. The smaller mound area only had one elevated room and plaza, while the larger mound had 17 elevated resi- dential rooms and 3 plazas. One striking feature of this site is that the exterior walls of the mound and several interior room walls were lined with dressed gypsum blocks, which is unusual for this location in Arizona. The wall fall from an elevated "tower" room on the east side of the large platform mound perfectly pre- served its doorway and indicated that the gypsum blocks extended the full height of the structure. Other signif- icant features at the site include a massive compound wall that was 3 m wide and 3 m tall, and an L-shaped storage room with gypsum-block walls. This room was located within the smaller platform mound and faced the plaza in front of the gypsum "tower" room. The room contained two caches of artifacts, both of which had similar collections of jars, decorated bowls, raw pigment, manos, three-quarter grooved axes, and crys- tals. Portions of the site were destroyed by burning, and the site was visited by the Apaches after its aban- donment by the Salado. Apache ceramics have been found above the roof fall and within the erosional fill of one of the rooms. A community of small- and medium-sized settle- ments surrounding the platform mound at School- house Point was excavated under the direction of Owen Lindauer (ASU). Most of the 18 archaeological sites that surrounded the mound had occupations that pre- ceded or overlapped with the early range of the oc- cupation at the mound. With the exception of a few rooms, all the settlements surrounding the mound were abandoned by the time the community at the platform mound had reached its greatest size. The first settle- ments on the mesa were composed of Hohokam-style pithouses that were established some time in the elev- enth century. Surface-masonry compounds containing three to five rooms enclosed by a low wall replaced the pithouses. There is evidence from one site of a sequence of architectural styles: from pithouses to a pithouse with masonry wall to rectangular surface-masonry rooms within a compound. All 18 compounds inves- tigated probably were occupied at the time construc- tion of the platform mound began. Most compounds had lightly built architecture, evidence of sequential occupation, and small cemeteries. One compound within 200 m of the mound had an extensive cemetery containing several burial shafts containing multiple in- terments. By the fourteenth century all the com- pounds were abandoned, and the only residences away 747</page><page sequence="10">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY from the mound were two small settlements consisting of one isolated room and a small cluster of three rooms. In both instances the architecture consisted of free- standing wall masonry placed in a shallow pit. Under the direction of Denise Ryan (Prescott Na- tional Forest), the Chino Valley Ranger District has been conducting non-project-related para-archaeolo- gist training surveys on the bajada terraces bordering the Big Chino Wash. A total of 648 ha has been sur- veyed, resulting in the identification of 23 Archaic- period sites ranging in size from 50 sq m to 19.8 ha. The entire range of the Archaic appears to be repre- sented. Preservation is exceptional, with two sites hav- ing distinct knapping stations. The University of Arizona (UA) Archaeological Field School completed its thirtieth and final season at Grasshopper in 1992 under the direction of J. Jefferson Reid (UA). Excavation of three late-abandoned rooms at Grasshopper Pueblo provided information on household assemblages and ritual architecture dating to the late A.D. 1300s. Research continued to focus on the rapid social and economic changes that occurred around A.D. 1300 involving ceramic production and distribution (Daniela Triadan [Free University of Ber- lin], Stephanie Whittlesey [SR], Nieves Zedefio [UA]), projectile-point form and function (Leon Lorenzen [UA]), household organization (Barbara Montgomery [SR]), diet and the shift from horticulture to agriculture (Joe Ezzo [SR], John Welch [UA]), and ritual organi- zation. Barbara Montgomery completed her disserta- tion Understanding the Formation of the Archaeolog- ical Record: Ceramic Variability at Chodistaas Pueblo, Arizona, the seventeenth dissertation in a continuing program of graduate research. Deni Seymour (Mariah and Associates [MAI]) con- ducted research on Pima sites along the middle Santa Cruz River. Sites date to the Precontact and early Con- tact eras; some are noted in historic Jesuit and military documents and on maps dating to the 1690s and early 1700s. The site inventory has increased, and a data base has been assembled that defines early Pima material- culture attributes and settlement patterns. Under the direction of Keith Kintigh and Andrew Duff, ASU completed two full-coverage archaeological surveys near St. John's on the Hinkson Ranch. A 12- km2 area along the Zuni River revealed 91 sites. The occupation from A.D. 900 to 1150 and prehistoric trails were particularly notable. Lyman Lake State Park, along the upper Little Colorado river, was completely surveyed. About 5 km2 contained 47 archaeological sites ranging from the Archaic to A.D. 1350. There were extensive lithic-procurement sites, pithouse vil- lages, pueblos, and petroglyphs. Two pueblos dating from A.D. 1300 to 1350 were mapped. In a cooperative effort, the Amerind Foundation (Ann Woosley, PI) and the Bureau of Land Managment re- cently completed excavations at Pueblo Devol, a mul- tiroom cliff dwelling situated above Bonita Creek. Ini- tial dates suggest a ca. A.D. 1300-1350 occupation. Rooms separated into three alcoves may be associated with distinct households. Perishable remains were par- ticularly abundant and included textile fragments, bas- ketry, clothing, an intact bow, as well as a thick layer of corn-husk debris. Material-culture analyses (ceram- ics and architecture) are directed toward assessing pos- sible Anasazi migration into the Gila River drainage as a response to droughts occurring ca. A.D. 1276- 1299. The Office of Contract Archaeology (OCA), Uni- versity of New Mexico, completed fieldwork at the final four sites along the Transwestern (ENRON) Pipeline Expansion Project. Rick Morris was in charge of field- work at the four sites, while Carl Phagan served as project administrator and Joseph Winter as PI. The sites consisted of an 1880s homestead in Fort Valley near Flagstaff, a 1920s lumber camp near Flagstaff, a small lithic scatter near Big Chino Wash, and an iso- lated hearth near Hunters Point. This brings the total number of sites treated during mitigation to 165; 43 current cultural resources were also investigated in de- tail. Laura Leach-Palm (Zuni Cultural Resource Enter- prise [ZCRE]) (Roger Anyon, Elizabeth Skinner, Peter Noyes, PIs) continued excavations at AZ-P-60-31 within the right-of-way of N-2015 in Apache County. Dates indicate a BMIII (A.D. 500-700) occupation and a minimal PII (A.D. 900-1100) component on the sur- face. Excavation exposed 18 variably constructed pit structures, extensive midden, and 100 features. Mul- tiple instances of superimposition indicate reuse; that few artifacts were found on possible living surfaces suggests final abandonment. Dates cluster around A.D. 650. Subsistence remains include agricultural produce, wild plants, game, and possibly domesticated turkey. California and Gulf of Mexico shell are present. Few gray brownwares are present; this ware increases after BMIII/PI, suggesting a shift in the use of clay resources. Thomas F. Fletcher (Zuni Archaeology Program [ZAP]) directed excavations (Roger Anyon, PI) on por- tions of the Sanders Great House and six other sites near Sanders. The project research goals focus on pro- cesses of settlement development, community orga- nization and organizational change, and regional re- lationships, including involvement in the Chacoan regional system. Results to date indicate occupation of the great house site and vicinity from the late 900s into the twelfth century. Data indicate changes in settlement composition through time, suggesting the possibility of variability in patterns of community organization and regional interaction. Scott Kuhr, ZCRE (Elizabeth Skinner, PI) directed Phase I data-recovery efforts at 11 sites south of Navajo along Route N-2007. Sites date primarily to PII/III times and represent Anasazi habitation and limited activity areas. Two pit structures and four features were excavated, with numerous flaked-stone, ground-stone, and ceramic artifacts recovered. The research domains for the project included settlement formation, settle- ment variability, settlement patterning, resource spe- cialization, and regional cultural dynamics. COLORADO. The 1992 Fort Lewis College Ar- chaeological Field School under the direction of W. James Judge, was held at Puzzle House, an early PIII site located in southwest Colorado near Lowry Pueblo. Puzzle House is an isolated five-room structure with an enclosed elevated kiva. The southeast portion of the enclosure consists of double, or "bi-wall" masonry, [Vol. 58, No. 4, 1993] 748</page><page sequence="11">CURRENT RESEARCH possibly to shore up the kiva. It has a very complex architectural history, and appears to have little, if any, residential use. The possibility of the elevated kiva being a converted tower is being investigated. A pos- sible major lunar standstill alignment with a tower at the Pigg site is also being pursued. Bruce Bradley and Melissa Churchill (Crow Canyon Archaeological Center [CCAC]) directed the second year of excavations in civic architecture at Sand Canyon Pueblo, a large late thirteenth-century A.D. settlement. Churchill's work in the great kiva showed that the pe- ripheral rooms had been added in a series of construc- tion episodes. Bradley's investigations in the large D-shaped building corroborated that the two interior kivas had been added during remodeling, and had been abandoned in the same way as several other typical kivas at the site. Ricky Lightfoot and Kristen Kickelman (CCAC) di- rected the third season of excavations at Castle Rock Pueblo, a late thirteenth-century village. Judgmental sampling, primarily in architectural areas, was used to supplement previous random sampling, and to im- prove data on chronology, architectural and spatial patterns, and abandonment processes. Preliminary ev- idence supports local accounts, attributed to pueblo legends, that a battle occurred at the time of site and regional abandonment. Karen Adams and Mark Hovezak (CCAC) contin- ued long-term ecological studies aimed at understand- ing the modem and prehistoric Sand Canyon Locality environment; analyses of prehistoric excavated floral remains also continued. SS has completed the first of three field seasons of data-recovery excavations on the Ute Mountain Ute Irrigated Lands Archaeological Project. Under the di- rection of Cory Bretemitz, Chris Robinson, and Robert Bimie (SS) the project will test and excavate aceramic (n = 15), PII Anasazi (n = 33), and historic (n = 4) sites. The highest site density occurs in the Cowboy Wash area during PII times with some limited late Archaic and historic herding camps. The project hired 14 local tribal members and obtained archaeological- field-school credits for four tribal members through a cooperative venture with Fort Lewis College. Multiyear cultural-resource inventory, by Alpine Ar- chaeological Consultants (Jonathon C. Horn, Alan D. Reed, and Susan M. Chandler, PIs), of 535 km of pipe- line right-of-way and other facilities, totaling 3,523 ha for the proposed TransColorado natural-gas pipeline through western Colorado and northwestern New Mex- ico, from north of Grand Junction, Colorado, to Bloomfield, New Mexico. An overview and research design for the survey was produced prior to the initi- ation of fieldwork. A total of 412 sites was recorded that included 118 historic components, 2 Paleoindian components, 50 Archaic components, 37 Anasazi components, 53 late Prehistoric components, 22 Ute components, 4 Navajo, and 190 sites of unknown cul- tural affiliation. NEW MEXICO. Limited excavations were direct- ed by David Phillips (SWCA) at four prehistoric sites and a CCC Camp along a right-of-way in the Sacra- mento Mountains. The prehistoric remains were from Archaic and Jomada Mogollon camps related to hunt- ing and foraging. The CCC site was a side camp later used as a Forest Service ranger station. The Center for Anthropological Research (CAR) at New Mexico State University (NMSU) (Neal W. Ack- erly, PI) completed excavations of LA 88047 and LA 88048 in Hidalgo County. These sites were situated along a tributary drainage of the Animas Playa and were located between Animas and Lordsburg, New Mexico. Both sites consisted of surficial fire-cracked rock concentrations and quantities of sherds or chipped stone. The recovery of low densities of sherds, debitage and ground-stone implements was consistent with short- term hunting and plant-processing localities. Radio- metric dating of residual bulk carbon from a feature at LA 88048 resulted in an uncorrected age of 1560 ? 60 B.P. (Beta-54016). NMSU (Neal W. Ackerly, PI) began long-term ex- cavations at 12 prehistoric sites at Tortugas Mountain near Las Cruces. Two sites have been excavated. NMSU 1625 contains debitage and cores consistent with quar- rying activities. Three obsidian-hydration dates from the site suggest at least two horizontally stratified oc- cupations at ca. 499 A.D. and 1500-1650 A.D. (DL- 93-64 to DL-93-66). Excavations at NMSU 1565 show large quantities of chipped stone and at least 11 strat- ified hearths. Based on artifact densities, as well as the absence of some kinds of artifacts (e.g., ground stone), occupations at this site appear to have been of limited duration and focused primarily on hunting. The range of uncorrected radiocarbon dates using residual soil carbon from hearths varies from 960 ? 130 B.P. (Beta- 57537) to 1010 ? 110 B.P. (Beta-57215) to 1290 ? 80 (Beta-61396) to upwards of 1610 ? 100 B.P. (Beta- 57536). Relying on radiocarbon dates, the majority of features range in age from 960 to 1290 B.P. Obsidian- hydration dates vary from 986 A.D. (DL-93-68), with a modal occupation ranging from A.D. 1500 to 1733 (DL-93-67, DL-93-69, DL-93-70). These data suggest that NMSU 1565 was reoccupied on a short-term basis over a substantial period of time. Preserved plant pol- len has been recovered from sediments adjacent to the hearth dated at 960 ? 130 B.P. The recovery of Carya sp. (hickory or pecan) from these sediments suggests possible recent contamination with modem pollen. Plant macrofossils and pollen from a packrat midden dated in excess of 300 ? 80 B.P. (Beta-57538) are being used as a comparative basis for analyses of plant re- mains recovered from late contexts at these sites. NMSU (Neal Ackerly, PI) is continuing its research on irrigation systems in southern New Mexico. After completing inquiries in the Mesilla Valley, research has shifted to the Rio Mimbres Basin. As with the Mesilla Valley Project, activities have focused on compiling archival information, collecting oral histories, and con- ducting on-site inventories of irrigation systems in the Mimbres. While Bartolome Saenz (1756) and Bande- lier (1884) claimed to have found prehistoric irrigation systems in the region, later accounts by Pattie (1834) and Mansfield (1853) suggest that historic irrigation systems did not appear until sometime in the 1860s. Interestingly, documents in the Michael Steck papers at the University of New Mexico (UNM) indicate that the Federal government initiated the construction of 749</page><page sequence="12">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY acequias in the Mimbres and Gila valleys in 1858 in support of policies designed to convert the Mimbrefino and Gileiio Apaches into farmers. This may prove to be the earliest example of a de facto federal recla- mation project in New Mexico. CAR has collected a map series of acequia systems dating from 1853 to the present. These maps have been digitized and overlain to examine (1) changes in the spatial extent of irrigation and (2) longevity or persistence of specific canal align- ments. A joint project between the U.S. Forest Service (Tom Cartledge, Santa Fe National Forest [SFNF]) and the Office of Archaeological studies (OAS), Museum of New Mexico (directed by Adisa Wilmer, Steve Lent, and Joan Gaunt [OAS]), is currently underway to study the effects of prescribed burning and wildfire on mod- erately and heavily burned archaeological sites and ma- terials. Results of Phase I were used to refine the re- search design and various hypotheses to be tested in Phase II, in which different sites with different kinds and quantities of combustible fuels will be burned un- der conditions to establish damage thresholds. The Kwastiyukwa Interdisciplinary Archaeological Research Project (KIARP) focuses on intensive, non- invasive examination of the large, ancestral Jemez pueblo of Kwastiyukwa and its surrounding use area (William J. Whatley, Jemez Pueblo Archaeologist, PI). A multidisciplinary approach has been used to map and analyze the site. Field artifact analysis on the site is ongoing as is detailed archaeological survey of the land surrounding the site to determine the land-use patterns around the pueblo during its occupation. Carol Raish and Marian Revitte (SFNF) have di- rected survey of lands surrounding Stable Mesa Ruin, a large, late Puebloan site located in the Jemez Moun- tains. The site contains an estimated 1,800 rooms and is seen as an ancestral site to the Jemez people. The multiyear survey project seeks to understand the pat- terns of mesa-top land use around the large site during its occupation. The survey will be undertaken as a part of the Forest Service archaeology volunteer and edu- cation program, "Passport in Time." The final phase of the recording of the petroglyphs, pictographs, and related features in the SFNF Jemez Ranger District has been completed by Lance Trask (Maxwell Museum, UNM). Five mesas were surveyed with 76 rock-art sites cataloged. The project has sur- veyed a total of eight mesas and cataloged 149 rock- art sites. Data compiled from the compass bearings from all the panels indicate a preference for a south- east orientation for the majority of the sites. Also, the use of the geography to restrict general access is being examined. Three Western Archaic tradition petroglyph sites were recorded in May 1992 near Pecos in a cooperative effort with the SFNF and the American Rock Art Re- search Association (ARARA). The project was con- ducted by Brent Abel (SFNF) Frank Brock, and A. J. Brock (ARARA). During recordation at two of the sites, petroglyphs were discovered buried under soil along the periphery of the outcrops. In the fall of 1993 ex- cavations will begin using volunteers via the Forest Service's Passport in Time program, to determine the extent of the buried rock art. Ronald Dom of ASU will provide assistance in determining the age of the sites via soil and rock-varnish analysis. The Rio del Oso Cultural Resources Survey was con- ducted by the University of Michigan (UM) under a special-use permit from the SFNF. The project, di- rected by Kurt Anschuetz and Richard Ford (UM) con- sisted of pedestrian survey of the Rio del Oso drainage, a tributary of the Chama River. During the survey over 100 sites were recorded. The majority of the sites were large agricultural systems associated with Classic-pe- riod settlement. Additional sites recorded included an open-air Archaic midden being eroded by an arroyo, a historic Spanish rancheria, and a Athabaskan com- munity with tepee/earthlodge rings. There is some indication from sites recorded during the survey that occupation of the Rio del Oso occurred prior to the Classic period during the late Coalition. The Caja del Rio Norte Survey, directed by James Snead, University of California-Los Angeles, consisted of systematic pedestrian survey around the Caja del Rio Norte site, a large Classic-period pueblo on the Caja del Rio Norte overlooking the Rio Grande. Sites recorded during the survey included an outlying system of agricultural features and field houses. Some smaller pueblo sites were also recorded. Data-recovery excavations were carried out at La Plata Mine, northwestern New Mexico by MAI. Work at LA 82669 brings the total number of prehistoric and protohistoric sites partly or completely excavated at the mine since 1982 to 36 sites. LA 82669 was exca- vated in the fall of 1991, with analysis and production of the final report accomplished during 1992 under the direction of Gary M. Brown. Shrub charcoal from this logistical site was radiocarbon dated to the A.D. 250- 500 interval, making the occupation one of a growing number potentially filling a hypothesized gap between classic BMII and III. One of a number of pipeline surveys conducted as part of the large-scale, multicompany expansion of the Fruitland Coal-Gas Gathering System in northwestern New Mexico was the Trunk "D" Loop inventory. Lo- cated in the Gobernador District, this inventory was conducted under the direction of Gary M. Brown (MAI). A total of 122 ha was surveyed on the 17-km pipeline right-of-way, revealing 27 sites with at least 35 pre- historic, protohistoric, and historical-period compo- nents. Most of the components are attributable to PI Anasazi and Gobernador-phase Navajo occupations, along with some Archaic, BMII, possible Dinetah phase, and historical-period Hispanic occupations. MAI has been conducting investigations on Kirtland Air Force Base. The 21,303-ha project, implemented under the direction of Deni Seymour (MAI), consists of a six-phase work plan. After assessing the results of more than 100 projects and evaluating over 200 sites, known and new sites were recorded and evaluated, National Register recommendations made (including Multiple Properties Documentation), and a historic- preservation plan developed. Geomorphological re- search, paleontological studies, and the collection of oral histories will result in the production of profes- sional reports and several popular volumes and exhib- its relating to the history and prehistory of the base. Meade Kemrer (MAI) is managing the phased survey 750 [Vol. 58, No. 4, 1993]</page><page sequence="13">CURRENT RESEARCH of Lake Sumner on the Pecos River. A 1,376-ha parcel contained extensive prehistoric lithic-procurement lo- cales and the abandoned town of Los Ojitos, occupied within the 1864-1938 interval. A Rio Grande Classic period or Protohistoric farm- stead and a late nineteenth-century jacal structure and associated features were excavated near Pecos, under the direction of James L. More and Joan K. Gaunt (OAS) (Tim Maxwell, PI). LA 76138 was a two-room farmstead and shallow midden. An associated diffuse surface-artifact scatter may represent the location of an agricultural field, and pollen samples were obtained to test this possibility. LA 76140 contained a one-room jacal structure dating between ca. 1880 and 1930, and three associated trash pits. This complex may be the remains of a line camp associated with the late nine- teenth-century cattle industry on the Pecos Pueblo grant. Two sites, a possible Archaic camp and a Mesilla- phase residential site, were tested at the Santa Teresa Port-of-Entry facility by James L. Moore (OAS) (Tim Maxwell, Yvonne Oakes, PIs). LA 86774 covers 1.3 ha and contained at least one buried hearth and an ephemeral pit structure. LA 86780 covers 2.8 ha and contains numerous hearths and burned-rock features that have been exposed by earth-moving activities. A 10.6-km survey south of Carlsbad by Peter Bullock (OAS) (Yvonne Oakes, PI) revealed the presence of five sites consisting of burned-rock middens. The larg- est is 40 x 120 m in size and contains seven middens. Cultural affiliations or temporal periods could not be determined. Pedestrian survey by Peter Bullock (OAS) (Eric Blin- man, PI) east of Gallup resulted in the recording of a ground-stone and lithic artifact scatter of unknown cul- tural or temporal affiliation. Also found within the pro- ject area was a portion of the Fort Wingate Ruin, a Chaco outlier. The outlier was mapped, and a TCPs study of the project area found no locales of traditional Navajo or Pueblo use. Testing west of Gallup by Peter Bullock (OAS) (Eric Blinman, PI) confirmed the presence of a large PI- period site. At least one structure, a slab-lined hearth, and an intact midden were found. Portions of LA 83772, a multicomponent Mogollon site at White Signal, south of Silver City, were exca- vated by R. N. Wiseman (OAS) (Yvonne Oakes, PI). Remnants of a pithouse yielded three dates of 1770 + 70 B.P., 1770 ? 50 B.P., and 1610 ? 60 B.P. from one construction timber. The samples, two of outer rings and one of inner rings, were submitted as a blind test. Ten sites, west of Reserve, were tested by R. N. Wiseman (OAS) (Yvonne Oakes, PI). Based on testing results, four sites will be excavated: a small, late Re- serve/early Tularosa pueblo originally recorded in 1931 by Emil Haury for Gila Pueblo; a second small pueblo and pithouse kiva of the same time period; an early pithouse village; and an Archaic site. Archaeological survey between Sheep Springs and Narbona Pass by Nancy J. Akins (OAS) (Eric Blinman, PI) resulted in the recording of 13 sites including three Navajo habitation sites, three rock alignments prob- ably related to livestock activities, a recent water-con- trol feature, a recent shrine, a PI-period field house, and four ceramic or lithic artifact scatters. Anasazi sites are predominately in the eastern grassland ecozone, while Navajo activity sites are most common in the scrub and woodlands. Excavation was conducted under the direction of Nancy J. Akins (OAS) (Tim Maxwell, PI) in portions of the midden at San Antonio de Padua in Bernalillo County, a pueblo site occupied in the fourteenth cen- tury, again in the seventeenth century, and by Hispanic residents since the early 1800s. The trash deposits are being studied to gain information on social interaction and settlement of the area. Under the direction of Mollie Toll (OAS) (Tim Max- well, PI) the OAS Ethnobotanical Laboratory is study- ing ca. 600 flotation samples from 28 sites in the La Plata Valley, northwest of Farmington, where recov- ered remains consist largely of maize; the remains re- covered from vessels and baskets from sites near Gallo Mountain; flotation samples from Archaic and Apache sites near Reserve; remains from pithouses near Pot Creek pueblo; samples taken from corn fields at San Ildefonso Pueblo; ceremonial materials from San La- zaro Pueblo in the Galisteo Basin; and samples from sites in southeastern and south-central New Mexico. For the NPS, macrobotanical remains from BM- through PI-period sites in Chaco Canyon are being studied. The University of New Mexico's Office of Contract Archeology (OCA) completed a reconnaissance survey of segments of the Butterfield Trail. The survey, di- rected by Peggy Gerow (PD) and Patrick Hogan (PI) verified the route of the trail between Las Cruces and the New Mexico-Arizona border, identified several ar- eas where remnants of the trail were still visible, and documented stage stations and other features related to use of the trail between 1858 and 1880. OCA continued excavations at Archaic sites in the Rio Puerco valley near Albuquerque. The fieldwork was directed by Patrick Hogan (PI) and Janette Elyea (PD), and involved areally extensive excavations at eight shallowly buried residential sites ranging in age from ca. 4000 to 1600 B.P. Structures at the sites ranged from ephemeral brush shelters to shallow pithouses, and there was considerable variation in both the as- sociated facilities and number of structures present. Patrick Hogan (PI) and Peggy Gerow (PD) super- vised OCA's investigations at a cluster of 13 Archaic sites in west-central New Mexico. Projectile points from the sites include both Oshara and Cochise styles, sug- gesting an occupation span of ca. 7500-3000 B.P. Al- though the sites are largely surficial, they appear rela- tively unaffected by postdepositional processes. OCA completed a survey of an Anasazi community in the El Malpais region south of Grants. Fieldwork, under the direction of Janette Elyea (PD) and Patrick Hogan (PI), documented 64 sites representing a dis- persed PII community of pithouse villages with an as- sociated Great Kiva, and a larger early PIII community centered on the Dittert site, a suspected Chacoan out- lier. Peggy Gerow (PD) and Patrick Hogan (PI) super- vised investigations by OCA at San Pedro, a small Hispanic farming and mining community in the central Rio Grande Valley. It was founded in 1846 and com- 751</page><page sequence="14">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY pletely abandoned by the end of World War II. The project involved mapping the village, documentation of the remaining buildings, and archival research and interviews with former inhabitants. Jeanne A. Schutt (OCA) (Richard C. Chapman, PI) directed an OCA Class III survey of 729 ha in seven parcels near Stanley. Thirty-two archaeological sites and 113 isolated occurrences were identified. The ma- jority of sites, including small structural sites, water- control features, and nonstructural sites, date to the PIV period and are probably associated with the oc- cupation of Pueblo Blanco, a large 1,450-room pueblo immediately outside of the survey area. A number of historic short- and long-term camps and residences occupied between 1907 and 1920 were also identified. William H. Doleman (Richard C. Chapman, PI) completed and published the final phase of OCA's analysis for the ground-based laser project on White Sands Missile Range. Analyses focused on developing models of geomorphic and biological effects on ar- chaeological deposits and the resulting biases in sur- vey-documented surface assemblages. Stereo photoin- terpretation was used to develop an environmental framework consisting of landforms (1000s m) and ma- crotopography (10s-100s m) for settlement-pattern analysis of previous survey data. Results indicate pat- terned variations in project-area landscape usage at both landform and macrotopography scales. These pat- terns differ across the Archaic-Formative transition. Jeanne A. Schutt (Charles W. Amsden and Richard C. Chapman, PIs) directed the remainder of OCA's 10 percent sample survey of the Fort Wingate Army depot near Gallup. Twenty 80-acre (32.4-ha) quads within five ecological zones were surveyed; 80 sites and 170 isolated occurrences were recorded. An additional sur- vey of an area surrounding Fenced Up Horse Valley and the Casa Vibora community (208.5 ha) identified 71 sites and 70 isolated occurrences. Many of the sites are apparently associated with the occupation of Casa Vibora and date to the PII and III periods (A.D. 900- 1300). A number of historic Native American sites were also recorded that date to the turn of the century through the late 1920s and 1930s. Western Cutural Resource Management (WCRM) is completing work initiated by the division of Conser- vation Archaeology along an El Paso Natural Gas Pipe- line in northwest New Mexico. The project, directed by Tim Kearns, investigated 43 sites: Mid-Archaic (ca. 4500 B.P.) and BMII camp, structure, and storage lo- cales; BMIII ceramics and PI architecture; PI residen- tial and limited-activity sites; PII-III unit pueblos, iso- lated kivas, limited-activity sites, and a road or ceremonial avenue; and early Navajo campsites. The Whirlwind outlier community was also recorded. Forty of the sites are in the southern Chuska Valley, and research is focused on the chronology, environment, demography, economy, and sociopolitical organization of prehistoric occupations in the region. The Rio Bonito Archaeological Project is a multiyear cooperative research agreement between the New Mex- ico BLM and Eastern New Mexico University [ENMU]) (Phil Shelly, PI). Project research focuses on land use and misuse as well as shifts in settlement and subsis- tence patterns in the late Jornada Mogollon occupation of the Sierra Blanca Uplands. Results of survey, ex- cavation, and analysis completed to date indicate that the major occupation of the valley occurred between the late part of the tenth century A.D. and the beginning of the fifteenth century. Analysis of pollen from local wood-rat middens indicates the existence of relatively stable plant communities throughout the occupation of the valley. However, there does appear to be a rel- atively steady decline in Juniperus pollen, which has been interpreted as reflecting local deforestation. Changes in subsistence strategies in response to local and regional short-term climate fluctuations appear to have involved settlement relocation up and down slope, shift in varieties of maize cultivated, and varying de- grees of reliance on local nut resources. It has been known for many years that there was a cluster of Navajo refugee pueblitos dating to the turn of the eighteenth century in the La Jara Wash area of Carson National Forest's Jicarilla Ranger District. Re- cent surface-survey activities by John Nathan Young of the Carson National Forest have located a number of unique items dating to that same period: (1) two cradleboards and a saddle, (2) a stone pipe-carved in the likeness of a detachable bayonet, and (3) a petro- glyph panel consisting of representations of bows and arrows and corn plants and a bear paw and a yei figure. Sally and Weber Greiser of Historical Research As- sociates have completed a survey of potentially irri- gable lands at Taos Pueblo. Findings include twelfth- century irrigation communities consisting of ditch networks paralleled by small "pueblitos," reservoirs, and agricultural fields. Irrigation strategies had changed by the fourteenth century coincident with changes in community structure. These ditches are associated with extensive water- and soil-control features in the form of terraces, cobble-gridded fields and gardens, gravel- mulched gardens, and field houses. Particularly signif- icant is the findings of pre-aggregation ditches. The Northern Rio Grande Research Project, direct- ed by Winiford Creamer, (Northern Illinois University [NIU]) and Jonathan Haas (Field Museum of Natural History) continued study of protohistoric population size and distribution. Twelve rooms spanning four room blocks at Pueblo Blanco (LA 40) were excavated. Field- work was aimed at assessing the condition of a series of rooms at the time they were abandoned and ob- taining additional chronometric dates. Two tree-ring dates, 1488v and 1505+vv, were obtained, and an archaeomagnetic date is pending. The largest excavated room had painted wall decoration that appeared to be stenciled in black repeated in several places. Analysis by Patricia Hamlen (NIU) of surface collections from transects placed across each room block indicates that the site can be divided into three temporally distinct groups of room blocks. NIU has also began ceramic analysis of midden sam- ples from 13 protohistoric sites. Analysis of the 90,000 individually coded sherds is expected to continue through 1994. The University of Denver Archaeological Field School directed by Dean Saitta continued its work in Togeye Canyon near Ramah. Research focused on the relation between canyon settlements during the late twelfth and thirteenth centuries, just prior to popula- 752 [Vol. 58, No. 4, 1993]</page><page sequence="15">CURRENT RESEARCH tion aggregation. Two rooms were excavated at a small 15-room pueblo, and a resurvey was made of canyon sites. Excavation results dovetail with previous find- ings that small pueblo sites in the canyon replicate patterns of room construction and function, as well as ceramic patterns, evident at the large Scribe S phase Pettit site. Lawrence E. Vogler, Kristen Langenfeld, and Dennis Gilpin (NNAD) have recently completed an overview of the work on the Navajo Indian Irrigation Project (NIIP). The overview summarizes work undertaken by a number of archaeological contractors from 1974 to 1984 on over 87,480 ha of land located south-south- west of Farmington New Mexico. Over 2,300 com- ponents present at over 1,900 sites were recorded dur- ing the course of the project. Of these sites, 14 percent were tested and/or excavated. The data base generated from the project is quite extensive and provides im- portant data on Archaic, Anasazi, and Navajo adap- tations in the Gallegos Mesa area. Copies of the data base are available to qualified researchers from the Bureau of Indian Affairs or NNAD Farmington Office. The NNAD Farmington office, under the direction of Lawrence E. Volger, has undertaken numerous pro- jects within San Juan County in 1992. Work has in- cluded Indian Health Service water projects, Navajo Tribal Utility Authority powerline projects, chapter- development projects, and numerous individual ho- mesite leases. During these projects, over 405 ha of land were surveyed, and some 150 new archaeological sites were documented. These sites include Archaic, Anasazi, and Navajo manifestations dating from 6000 B.C. to the twentieth century. In particular, these sur- vey projects have provided additional data concerning Anasazi adaptations along the Chuskan slope and have elucidated Navajo settlement patterns in the checker- board area east of the Navajo reservation during the twentieth century. Under the direction of Douglas Dykeman, NNAD archaeologists conducted excavations at six sites in the Navajo Reservoir District. Jeffrey T. Wharton and Paul F. Reed (NNAD) provided direct field supervision for the excavations. Archaic, Anasazi, and early Navajo components at LA 74196 and LA 74243 indicate a special-use area and a habitation, respectively. Spe- cialized faunal and floral processing are indicated at sites LA 73518 and LA 74239. Stephen R. Durand (ENMU) continues a research project that seeks to define the source area(s) for the wood used in the construction of the buildings in Chaco Canyon. The working model is that modem trees will evidence a trace-element chemical signature specific to the bedrock they are growing on. Once possible source areas are distinguished with modem samples, it may be possible to match the ancient wood from Chaco with their source area(s). Modem tree stands in the Mt. Taylor region, Lobo Mesa region, and the Chuska Mountains have been sampled. Initial ICP analysis of this wood from Pueblo Bonito and Chetro Ketl has been analyzed, and while it cannot be identified to source yet, these samples show consistent and pat- terned trace-element chemistries. This research is a collaborative effort with Martin R. Rose and Fred Nials (Desert Research Institute), Phillip H. Shelley (ENMU), Ronald Sletten (University of Washington), Linda S. Cordell (Maxwell Museum), Charles K. Shearer (Uni- versity of New Mexico), and Thomas C. Windes and Dabney Ford (NPS). Robbie L. Brewington and Harry J. Shafer (Texas A&amp;M) have undertaken research to examine geograph- ic variability of the Mimbres-Mogollon. Initial results are based on comparisons of excavated material, both lithic and ceramic, from surface pueblo components of the West Fork (Catron County) and NAN Ruins (Grant County). The lithic analysis indicates that, while the proportions of raw material vary, there is a ho- mogeneity of formal tool types. In contrast, the ceramic assemblage of the West Fork site contains far more Reserve ceramic types than the NAN Ruin and the Mimbres Black-on-white ceramics appear to be of an earlier style than those of the NAN sample. Barbara J. Roth (Tierra Services) and Cynthia Bet- tison (Western New Mexico University Museum) have begun the first year of a three-year project at the Lake Roberts Vista site, a Classic-period Mimbres pueblo with an earlier pithouse component located in the Gila National Forest near Silver City. The field school was a cooperative effort between Western New Mexico University and the Gila National Forest. The first sum- mer of fieldwork involved surface collections and lim- ited excavations. Two pueblo rooms, a plaza area, por- tions of two pithouses, and a segment of a possible Great Kiva were excavated. This is one of a small number of Mimbres sites excavated in the mountains, and should provide important information on Mimbres occupation away from the major rivers. Studies by Tom Windes and Dabney Ford (NPS), continued at the East Community, a Chacoan com- munity of over 50 small houses and a great house located between Wijiji and Pueblo Pintado. The area and the community was first occupied in the A.D. 900s, with a decrease in population in the A.D. 1000s and 1100s and then a subsequent major Mesa Verdean oc- cupation in the A.D. 1200s. Many of the later houses were built over the earlier houses. This community holds promise for determining shifting occupancy du- ration through time Chacoan and Mesa Verdean oc- cupations. Testing in six rooms at Pueblo Bonito formerly ex- cavated by George Pepper (1890s) and Neil Judd (1920s) was conducted by Tom Windes, Dabney Ford, and Jim Trott (NPS) to assess the architectural preservation of the rooms since they were backfilled. Preservation of walls and wall plaster was generally good, although wood elements had suffered from wet and dry rot. Gen- erally, the fill cultural material reflected deposits mixed during the backfilling process. A relatively intact de- posit from the A.D. 900s, however, was found in Room 83 that had been tossed from adjacent Room 85. There were also large amounts of faunal material recovered from Rooms 83 and 384, the most complete collections curated from the site, thus far. The sixth year of inventory, documentation, and sampling of wood in the great houses of Chaco Canyon was completed by Tom Windes and Dabney Ford (NPS). Approximately half of Chetro Ketl was inven- toried and documented, with only the remainder and Kin Ya'a left to be done. The major focus of sampling 753</page><page sequence="16">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY was at Pueblo del Arroyo, where approximately 1,100 tree-ring samples have now been collected from an inventory of 1,500 pieces of wood (73 percent of the total). Two major construction episodes are evident; the central core of the site at A.D. 1078 and the rest between A.D. 1101 and 1105. As an extension of the Chaco Wood Project, the first year of sampling at Aztec West Ruins was completed with the collection of 350 samples from a total inven- tory of 4,700 pieces of wood. The inventory was com- pleted primarily through the efforts of Bert Croken, a volunteer. An inventory and sampling of the East Ruin was conducted earlier by Peter J. McKenna (NPS, now BIA). An additional inventory will be made of the West Ruin wood in the visitors center, Earl Morris's former home. Tom Windes (NPS) reports that for the first time, a complete year's precipitation record was recorded from an array of 11 weather stations placed throughout Cha- co Canyon. Gauges have been set in two series 3 km north-south across the canyon through the large Cha- coan communities at South Gap and Fajada Gap, with a third covering about 25 km of canyon bottom, east- west. These will help to assess microclimatic variation as a means to understand the prehistoric occupation of the canyon. Kaea J. Morris (ZCRE) directed two cultural-re- source inventories on Navajo Nation Tribal Trust Lands (Peter Noyes, Roger Anyon, and Elizabeth Skinner, PIs). The smaller inventory entailed the survey of 9.07 ha. Two isolated occurrences and one site (LA 89851) dating to the PII-III period (A.D. 1000-1200) were located. A total of 46.5 ha was surveyed in the larger inventory and resulted in the location of 13 sites (LA 89933-89944 and HS-1) containing 18 components (13 prehistoric, 2 historic, and 3 modem), and 43 iso- lated occurrences. All of the prehistoric sites date to or have components that date to the PII-PIII periods. The historic site and historic component date to the 1920s. All modem components are younger than 50 years and are currently in use. No structures were found in as- sociation with the prehistoric sites; all sites consisted of surface-artifact scatters. Ramona Avallone (PI, ZAP) directed a total of 34.6 km of survey in McKinley County. A total of 23 sites was recorded on seven projects. Sites included: 3 mul- ticomponent, 5 historic Navajo, 1 undated rubble mound, 1 undated rock alignment, 1 prehistoric lithic scatter, 1 PII ceramic scatter, 1 PII artifact scatter, 6 PII-III artifact scatters, 2 PII-III artifact scatters with rubble mounds, 1 PII-III artifact scatters with room- blocks, and 1 PII-IV artifact scatter and rubble mound. Robert Waterworth (PI, ZCRE) directed testing and/ or mapping of 18 prehistoric and historical-period sites along the right-of-way on Navajo Route 48 southeast of Crown Point. Maps were made of all sites, and six prehistoric sites of questionable eligibility were tested. Both architectural and nonarchitectural sites were doc- umented. Prehistoric sites range from BMIII to PII periods. Subsurface testing at most of the prehistoric sites revealed probable middens or features. Among the historic sites are the Borrego Pass trading post, several possible sweatlodges, and a collapsed fork-stick hogan. Southern Methodist University Archaeological Field School under the direction of Michael Adler continued excavations at Pot Creek Pueblo (TA-1) and initiated surface investigations of a small pueblo (TA-25) lo- cated on SMU's Fort Burgwin Research Center campus near Taos. Fieldwork included excavations in two ado- be surface rooms and an associated pit structure on the Mound 6 room block at Pot Creek Pueblo. Excavations in the pit structure, originally interpreted as a Valdez phase (A.D. 1000-1200) pithouse buried under 4 m of cultural deposits, indicate the structure was probably a kiva occupied during the early portion of the Mound 6 occupation (A.D. 1260-1320). TEXAS. The University of Texas-Institute of Tex- an Cultures (UTITC) and the Southern Texas Archae- ological Association (STAA) cosponsored their field school near Castroville under the direction of Thomas H. Guderjan (UTITC, now St Mary's University). The goal of the field school is to study the dynamics of hunter-gatherer adaptations in the Medina River val- ley and the edge of the Edwards Plateau. This year, teams continued excavations at the Quinta Medina site (middle Archaic-late Prehistoric: supervised by Bar- bara Meissner, University of Texas, San Antonio [UTSA]), the River Bluff (late Prehistoric: supervised by Jan Watts [STAA] and Jos6 Zapota [UTSA]), and the Diversion site (Paleoindian-middle Archaic: su- pervised by Jose Zapota [UTSA]). UTAH. Alpine Archaeological Consultants, Inc. (AACI) (Alan D. Reed, PI; James Firor, PD) excavated a small lithic scatter in Natural Bridges National Mon- ument. Excavation of an 8 m2 area revealed a burned slab-lined storage cist and a hearth. Radiocarbon dates from the two features, B.P. 1660 ? 60 (Beta-57405) and B.P. 1880 ? 50 (Beta-57406), confirmed the sus- pected BMII cultural affiliation. The site appears to have functioned as a field camp and probable short- term storage location for agricultural products. AACI (Susan M. Chandler, Alan D. Reed, and Jon- athan C. Horn, PIs; Rand A. Greubel, PD) conducted the Interstate 70 Castle Valley to Rattlesnake Bench data-recovery analysis. The project comprised analysis of data recovered by the University of Pittsburgh in 1988 and 1989 from 11 prehistoric sites along Inter- state 70 in the San Rafael Swell region. Archaic, Fre- mont, and Protohistoric components were investigat- ed. Radiocarbon assays from the sites have yielded age determinations ranging between 3760 and 285 B.P. Of particular significance is site 42EM1887, a pithouse village site where an early, unnamed, phase of the San Rafael Fremont seems to be represented. This aceramic "proto-Fremont" component is characterized by shal- low pithouses associated with bell-shaped storage pits, corn, and Rosegate-series projectile points. The site has yielded radiocarbon dates ranging from 1730 ? 85 B.P. (PITT-552) to 1240 ? 80 B.P. (Beta-60745). AACI (Alan D. Reed, PI) conducted excavations at Shadow Shelter, a rockshelter site in Canyonlands Na- tional Park threatened by planned staff-housing con- struction. Excavation of 30 m2 revealed stratified cul- tural deposits associated with at least four components. Radiocarbon determinations of 2040 ? 80 B.P. (Beta- 754 [Vol. 58, No. 4, 1993]</page><page sequence="17">CURRENT RESEARCH 57401), 3130 ? 70 B.P. (Beta-57402 ), and 3180 ? 270 B.P. (Beta-57404) indicate at least two occupations during the late Archaic period. Another component was discovered below the earliest chronometrically dated component, and probably represents an earlier Archaic occupation. A Desert Side-notched point found on the site surface suggests a possible Numic compo- nent. Robert D. Leonard MESOAMERICA MEXICO. The Proyecto Urichu, directed by Helen P. Pollard (Michigan State University) and funded by the National Geographic Society (NGS), the Wenner- Gren Foundation, and Michigan State University Re- search and Global Competence Grants, began in 1990 as a pilot project at the site of a known Tarascan administrative center in the Lake Patzcuaro Basin of Michoacfn. The goals of the project were: (1) to eval- uate an ethnohistorically derived model of ethnic uni- fication associated with the emergence of the Tarascan state at what was hoped to be a deeply stratified site in the political core of the state; (2) to establish a cul- tural sequence for the Lake Pfitzcuaro Basin; and (3) to establish the material correlates of elite identity be- fore and after Tarascan political centralization. The research, which involved the first systematic excavations of pre-Tarascan occupations in the Patz- cuaro Basin, has revealed a much more complex set- tlement, and a far more significant site, than was pre- dicted on the basis of historic documents. The site covers more than 85 ha, with at least two pyramid- plaza complexes and the remains of a sixteenth-cen- tury chapel. Ten test pits excavated in three sectors of the site revealed one zone with Late Postclassic plat- forms and an elite occupation (burials with ceramics and bronze artifacts); one habitation zone with a deeply stratified midden dating to at least the Middle and Late Postclassic (510 ? 80 B.P. [Beta-39996]); and one zone with Late Postclassic materials overlying two ear- lier occupations. The earliest occupation, encountered in a tomb, dates to the Epiclassic/Early Postclassic (1210 ? 90 B.P. [Beta-50864]; 1090 ? 60 B.P. [Beta-50863]); ceramics suggest a connection with the Lerma River drainage. Analyses of artifacts, soils, and skeletal ma- terial are nearing completion, and regional surveys and expanded excavations are planned for the future. In January 1990, Dan Healan (Tulane University) began a comprehensive investigation of Prehispanic settlement and obsidian exploitation in the Zinape- cuaro, Michoacan, obsidian-source area. The field in- vestigation involved intensive, field-by-field, regional survey of a 62.5 sq km area to locate quarry sites as well as habitation and other non-quarry sites; explor- atory excavations were conducted at a sample of 30 sites, including four major settlements previously known from ethnohistorical sources (Zinapecuaro, Taimeo, Araro, Ucareo). More than 1,000 individual obsidian- quarry pits were identified; they vary from small, doughnut-shaped clusters of shallow pits ringed by quarrying debris to massive trenches with well-defined lithic-reduction and debitage-dumping loci. Analysis of ceramic, lithic, and other materials is under way. Preliminary ceramic analysis indicates material rep- resenting a strong local tradition spanning the For- mative through Late Postclassic periods with ties to both central and western Mexico. Kenneth Hirth (Pennsylvania State University [PSU] and University of Kentucky) directed stratigraphic ex- cavations at Xochicalco in the summer of 1992. The purpose of the excavations was to investigate the or- ganization and degree of craft specialization at the ur- ban center during the Epiclassic period (A.D. 700- 900). The 12 excavated areas were previously identified as obsidian-workshop sites on the basis of surface col- lections made by the Xochicalco Mapping Project. Subsurface remains of obsidian-tool production were recovered in eight of the 12 workshop sites. Research in 1993 focused on extensive horizontal clearing in several of these workshops with the intent of defining the organization of chipped-stone craft activity in both domestic and nondomestic production contexts. The Proyecto Xochicalco, under the direction of Norberto Gonzalez Crespo (Centro Regional Morelos, Instituto Nacional de Antropologia e Historia [CRM- INAH]), continued archaeological explorations in the upper ceremonial zone of Xochicalco in 1992. Inves- tigations by Silvia Garza T., Pablo Mayer, Hortensia de Vega, Gisel Canto, and Octavio Rocha concentrated on horizontal clearing, consolidation, and restoration of buildings and platform facades around the Obser- vatory on the north side of the Xochicalco acropolis. Additional excavations and large-scale horizontal clearing in the Centro Ceremonial Plaza, the Plaza of the Stela with Two Glyphs, and other parts of the acropolis continue in 1993. A team from the State University of New York- Albany, directed by Michael E. Smith, conducted an intensive surface survey of the town of Yautepec, Mo- relos, during the summer of 1992. The investigations defined the extent of the Late Postclassic city of Yau- tepec as determined by surface distributions of arti- facts. Aztec-period Yautepec covered about 210 ha on both sides of the Rio Yautepec. Settlement was nucle- ated around the Yautepec Palace, a large structure (ca. 65 x 95 m) under excavation by Hortensia de Vega (CRM-INAH). Preliminary analyses of the surface col- lections suggest that the area around the palace was an elite residentia 1 zone, a hypothesis that is being tested by excavations in 1993. The survey also located four small Classic sites and a large hilltop Epiclasssic site, all within modem Yautepec. Excavation of houses dur- ing winter and spring 1993 are exploring the social, economic, and spatial organization of Yautepec. Ex- cavations have produced burials with offerings of dis- membered human body parts, a burial of an individual with an obsidian projectile point embedded in a rib, one house with subfloor offerings including a bronze axe, and several midden deposits with extremely dense artifact contents (more than 10,000 sherds per cubic meter). A substantial Middle Postclassic occupation underlies the central sector of the Late Postclassic city. In the summer of 1992, Gary Feinman and Linda Nicholas (University of Wisconsin-Madison) contin- ued their research at the Ejutla site in Oaxaca where they have previously documented Prehispanic craft ac- 755</page><page sequence="18">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY tivities, including shell-ornament manufacture, ceram- ic production, lapidary work, and possibly cloth work. Detailed analyses of shell collected during the 1990- 1991 field seasons provide the basis for new obser- vations concerning the technologies employed by the ancient Ejutla craft workers: (1) documentation of the extraction of the base of the columella from large gas- tropods to make thick cylindrical beads; (2) recognition of different technological sequences followed in the manufacture of small and large matte shell beads; and (3) a better understanding of the relation among specific taxa, the tecniques of manufacture, and the classes of ornaments produced. Continuing fieldwork in the same sector of the Ejutla site where prior research had been undertaken concen- trated on excavation of stone walls that appear to be the foundation of a Prehispanic multiple-room struc- ture. Analyses of the heavy fraction from flotation sam- ples suggest that shell and stone were worked within an area defined by the stone foundation. Horizontal exposure of this feature will continue in the near future. Cambridge University Press will publish the results of 10 years of research by Arthur G. Miller (University of Maryland [UM]), supported by NGS and UM, on painted tombs in the Valley of Oaxaca, including Such- ilquitongo (Huijazoo) Tomb 5. Miller, Nancy M. Far- riss (University of Pennsylvania), and Angeles Romero Frizzi (Centro Regional Oaxaca-INAH) are currently working on a project in the Zapotec Sierra funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Getty Trust. The project focuses on examining to what extent early Colonial native calendars and maps reflect the interaction of Zapotec and European symbolic, ide- ological, and economic systems. Of special interest is how the native ritual calendars and maps, produced during the first two centuries after conquest, were in- fluenced by the introduction of European writing and the mode of thought it represents. Project participants have been learning Sierra Zapotec with the help of Juana Vasquez from Yalalag in order to translate sev- eral important Early Colonial documents written in transliterated Sierra Zapotec dialects. Investigations include surveying Prehispanic, Colonial, and contem- porary sacred sites in the Sierra and correlating them with their Colonial-period cartographic referents. In January 1993, Miller was invited by the Mije of Jal- tepec de Candoyoc to assess a major site in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec on the edge of the lowland Mije zone. The Mije themselves will oversee the archaeological excavations of the site, coordinated by UM; this will be the first time the directorship of a mesoamerican archaeological project has been in the hands of indig- enous peoples. An international conference on anthropology and history-Veracruz en la Cultura: Encuentro y Rit- mos-was held to mark the Columbian Quincentenary in Veracruz City in September 1992, under the spon- sorship of the state government and the Universidad Veracruzana. The many symposia in archaeology in- cluded sessions devoted to El Tajin, to the Laguna Manati Olmec offertory site, as well as to a broader look at settlement patterns in central and southern Ve- racruz, featuring the results of long-term investigations in the Gulf Coast region undertaken by Barbara Stark (Arizona State University). In 1992 Michael P. Smyth (University of Cincinnati) and Christopher D. Dore (University of New Mexico) completed systematic surface collection and intensive soil testing at Sayil funded by NGS, the Center for Field Research, the H. John Heinz Charitable Trust, and the American Anthropological Association. Survey data from 5,261 collection units are providing information on community activities across 3.5 sq km of urban settlement. The spatial associations of exotic ceramic wares, serving vessels, and architectural feature clusters supply evidence for high-status neighborhoods away from large public buildings. Patterns of soil chemistry, including organic phosphates, indicate that most flat, open areas of Sayil were under intensive garden cul- tivation. The largest of these garden plots are adjacent to zones identified as elite neighborhoods. High den- sities of over-fired sherds (Puuc Slate ware) and certain vessel forms in a large area of southwestern Sayil sug- gest a barrio devoted to ceramic manufacture. A new sacbe connecting northwestern Sayil with the nearby site of Chac II implies that they were part of the same urban center. Brief explorations at Chac II revealed a painted ("red hands") stucco mural in the three-story Chac Palace, several temple pyramids, a possible ball court, and numerous settlement remains atop one of the largest raised platforms known in the Puuc region. In 1993 Lawrence G. Desmond (University of Col- orado), William A. Sauck (Western Michigan Univer- sity), James M. Callaghan (Universidad Aut6noma de Yucatan), John Muehlhausen and Kristen Zschomler (Institute for Minnesota Archaeology), in collaboration with codirectors Peter Schmidt and Agustin Pefia of the Centro Regional Yucatan-INAH, carried out a geo- physical survey of selected areas of the Great Plaza, Ball Court, and Sacred Cenote sacbe at Chichen Itza. The purpose of the survey, which involved ground- penetrating radar, resistivity, and self-potential, was to gain an understanding of Maya construction methods; to map the depth of fill and extent of terracing; to detect features and artifacts within the fill; to detect natural formations such as caves or other geological features within the bedrock; to test geophysical survey methods in the Chichen Itza environment; and to develop a data base of radar signatures for use in future geophysical projects in the area. Radar antennas were pulled in linear transects for a total of more than 6 km, forming a grid in the surveyed areas. Preliminary results indi- cate buried architectural remains such as sacbes, large geological anomalies such as fissures in the limestone bedrock, and a number of smaller anomalies that may be worked stone. William Ringle (Davidson College) and George Bey (Millsaps College) directed a third season of NGS- funded fieldwork at the northern Maya site of Ek Bal- am. Bey continued excavations in an elite architectural group apparently dating to the final florescence of the site. There is remarkably little evidence of Itza in- volvement in Ek Balam's decline, despite the site's proximity to Chichen Itza. Don Graff extended the site survey along a section of the sacbe system. Charles Houck continued survey of rural sites to define the extent of the larger polity and its population distri- bution. In 1991 a sixteenth-century chapel was dis- covered in the eastern section of Ek Balam. Graff's survey encompassed the southern part of the associated 756 [Vol. 58, No. 4, 1993]</page><page sequence="19">CURRENT RESEARCH reduction community, and Craig Hanson made inten- sive surface collections and limited excavations in four colonial housemounds. Test probes of the chapel nave by Ringle and Sharon Bennett indicate that it was a Colonial cemetery with dense interments. In 1993 Jen- nifer Sandlin, Hanson, and Bey began a modal analysis of the pottery, focusing on defining the Formative as- semblage, subdividing the Cehpech complex, and clar- ifying the Late Postclassic/Colonial complex. BELIZE. Mary Pohl (Florida State University) and Kevin Pope continued their research on the end of the Archaic and the transition to agriculture in the south- ern Maya Lowlands. John Jones, who analyzed pollen from cores taken in wetlands throughout northern Be- lize, reports that the appearance of maize cultivation is associated with a dramatic decline in pollen of forest species (e.g., Moraceae); the project has dated this phe- nomenon to between 3000 and 2500 B.C. Excavations have produced evidence for activity areas such as a wooden construction, perhaps a platform, that was built on the edge of the swamp. Coastal core data suggest that water levels rose in the Classic period because of sea-level rise, forcing the Maya to curtail their use of wetlands after A.D. 200. The Maya Research Program under the direction of Thomas H. Guderjan (University of Texas-San An- tonio) began excavations at the Blue Creek Ruin in northwestern Belize in 1992, focusing on understand- ing cultural interaction between northern Belize and the Pet6n. Initial construction of the main plaza oc- curred during the Late Preclassic period, and massive expansion of the site occurred during the Late Classic. During the spring of 1993, the K'axob Project, under the directorship of Patricia A. McAnany (Boston Uni- versity), completed a third season of excavation of Middle and Late Formative deposits. The focus of the project is on the genesis of ancestor veneration at K'axob, and toward this end, seven large-scale hori- zontal exposures have been excavated. The largest ex- posure, a 6-x-8-m area in a large plaza group, has yield- ed a stratified series of floors, middens, platforms, a shrine, and pyramid fill that spans the Middle For- mative to the Late Classic. During the 1993 season, the initial Middle Formative structures built directly on top of the paleosol were investigated. These deposits provide an early example of the familiar, dual struc- tures of Maya households with a cooking structure (rep- resented by a series of thin burned floor surfaces) ad- jacent to a larger, raised platform representing a more substantial living, sleeping, and storage structure. Bur- ials in the paleosol and the earliest platform structure exhibit a marked degree of differentiation in grave ac- couterments. Large-scale excavations in six "satellite" residential units within 200 m of the large plaza re- vealed no additional Middle Formative construction, confirming the pattern of small, nucleated Middle For- mative settlements described elsewhere in the Maya Lowlands. Late Formative to Protoclassic construction and burials occur in all satellite contexts, however, indicating significant settlement growth at this time. Large-scale exposures in 1993 revealed the close se- quencing of burials and episodes of structure refur- bishing. These data indicate the crucial role of ancestral interments in structure renovation, even at the "house- hold" level, a relation that has implications for social practices such as the intergenerational transmission of resources. Analysis of materials from the 1990, 1992, and 1993 seasons is now under way. A field season that will combine undergraduate field training with a research design that focuses on evaluating the political autonomy of K'axob during the Late Classic is planned for the spring of 1995. Archaeological work on Ambergris Caye directed by Elizabeth Graham (York University [YU]) and David M. Pendergast (Royal Ontario Museum [ROM]) began in 1986 with exploratory work at the site of Marco Gonzalez, at the caye's southern end. Research and excavation expanded considerably in 1990 under the sponsorship of the Social Sciences and Humanities Re- search Council of Canada, ROM, and YU. The 1990 work focused on Maya maritime trade, marine re- source utilization, the Late Classic to Postclassic cul- tural transition, the long-term environmental effects of reef resource exploitation, the role of salt procurement and processing, and soil and vegetation changes over time. These investigations included excavations at Marco Gonzalez, a reef survey, ethnographic-data gathering at the San Pedro Cooperative, and prelimi- nary soils and vegetation studies. In 1991 salvage work was carried out in the village of San Pedro itself where modern hotel and condo- minium construction is resulting in disturbance of an- cient occupation. During the 1991 season, the project pinpointed the location of the sixteenth-century San Pedro community in the center of the modem town and began excavating the portion of the community in the area of the Sands Hotel. The 1992 season involved intensive soils test pitting and sampling at Marco Gon- zalez and Santa Cruz (located about 24 km north of San Pedro on the lagoon or leeward side of the island). Geologist S. J. Mazzullo worked on the reconstruction of the Precolumbian geomorphological environment and on developing soils and other tests to interpret the stratigraphy, particularly the levels that seem to be related to salt and lime procurement and processing. Phil Sollins (Oregon State University) continues to work on the problem of the caye's anthrosols and the soils and cultural formation processes that contribute to their development. James Eckenwalder (University of To- ronto) is studying botanical materials. The 1993 in- vestigations, funded by ROM and YU, focused on the sixteenth-century community; questions of particular concern included cache practices and their significance, and the status of women as reflected in grave accom- paniments and skeletal indicators of health. Studies of the extensive, well-preserved skeletal material by Christine White (University of Western Ontario) and Henry Schwarcz (McMaster University) are also geared to answer questions concerning coastal Maya diet and use of marine resources. GUATEMALA. During the summer of 1992, Ste- phen Whittington (Hudson Museum) and David Mil- lard Reed (PSU) analyzed skeletal materials from Iximch6 dating to the Late Postclassic and Contact periods. The human and animal remains, excavated by George Guillemin more than 20 years ago at the Conquest-period capital of the Cakchiquel Maya, show evidence of decapitation by the Cakchiquel, with no 757</page><page sequence="20">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY indication that Spanish metal weapons were used. Healthy male and female adults from several social statuses composed the collection of decapitated indi- viduals. Frequencies of paleopathological indicators of stress are low relative to indicators observed for other contemporary Maya populations. Reed has also com- pleted a stable-carbon and nitrogen-isotope study of 18 humans from the Iximch6 collection. He interprets the carbon-isotopic ratios, some of the heaviest ever reported, as indicating a diet mostly composed of maize, but strongly affected by either altitude or environmen- tal conditions. C. Roger Nance (University of Alabama-Birming- ham) continued working on ceramics excavated by Guillemin at Iximche. In the summer of 1992, he re- corded and digitized information on 9,500 sherds. The project will also involve study of Guillemin's maps, photographs, and notes housed at CIRMA in Antigua. HONDURAS. Nancy Gonlin (PSU) completed a study of rural households at Copan dating between A.D. 535 and 1025. Eight low-status Maya sites were compared to examine the similarities and differences among households in the Late Classic Maya polity. Results are reported in detail in her 1992 dissertation (Rural Household Archaeology at Copdn, Honduras). David Millard Reed (PSU) completed a stable-car- bon and nitrogen-isotope study of collagen extracted from 60 Maya human remains dating to the Coner phase (A.D. 700-1250) from Copan. The skeletal spec- imens came from elite and nonelite contexts at rural and urban sites within the ancient polity. Diet, as in- ferred from the isotopic signatures, was rich in maize, with notable differences across social statuses and be- tween the adult males and females. The Proyecto Arqueolo6gico La Entrada continued intensive excavations at the main group of El Puente during 1992 under the direction of Seiichi Nakamura (Japan International Cooperation Agency), with the support the Instituto Hondurefno de Antropologia e Historia. Fieldwork in 1992 focused principally on clearing two structures in the main group (Strs. 3 and 10) revealing their Late Classic final occupation, and on the tunnel excavations into Strs. 1 and 31. Six stages of occupation, covering Early to Late Classic were con- firmed. Str. 31, with a plain stela and altar, was totally restored after excavation. A series of well-preserved rooms with benches was discovered in the northwest- ern corner of the main group. These rooms are very similar to those of the Las Sepulturas elite residential group in the Copan Valley. Outside the El Puente site, a geological survey was conducted by Toshiharu Tash- iro and Kazuo Aoyama looking for obsidian sources. A new obsidian source was found at San Luis, and its ancient exploitation has been confirmed by neutron- activation analysis (NAA). John S. Henderson (Cornell University [CU]) and Rosemary A. Joyce (Harvard University [HU]) di- rected excavations at Campo Dos, a Late to Terminal Classic settlement in the lower Ulua Valley in 1993. These investigations are the first stage of a long-term study of community and residential organization in the region in these periods. Excavations supervised by Margie van de Guchte (University of Illinois), Jeanne Lopiparo (HU), and Trisha Thorme (CU) emphasized horizontal exposures of domestic features along with collection of samples for soil chemistry and paleobo- tanical analyses (now in process under van de Guchte's direction). Excavations supervised by Lena Mortensen (CU) explored a ball court featuring cobble construc- tion with plaster facings. EL SALVADOR. The University of Colorado- National Science Foundation [NSF] project at the Cer- en site, directed by Payson Sheets, conducted research in several disciplines, including geophysics (searching for anomalies representing structures under 5 m of volcanic ash) and volcanology (determining that the source of that volcanic ash was Loma Caldera volcano, not Laguna Caldera). David Lentz began intensive eth- nobotanical research, confirming the utilization of a wide variety of species. Andrea Gerstle directed ex- cavation of a village-level ritual structure with unusual architecture and artifacts. Stored on a high shelf were a modeled and painted caiman vessel and a red and white painted deer skull complete with two antlers and most of the skull bones, along with a string used for attachment. Brian McKee directed excavations in the midden south of the sauna, where obsidian prismatic blades were discarded (primarily because they had bro- ken into small segments, rather than because they be- came too dull to use). Marilyn Beaudry-Corbett con- tinued her ceramic analyses, defining groups based on NAA of samples of whole vessels. Human footprints were found along a muddy section of a walkway, and using the ratio of foot length to height, Fran and Julie Saul estimate that Ceren residents were 152-170 cm tall. Research funded by NSF, continued in 1993, fo- cusing on the village religious structures. John S. Henderson CENTRAL AMERICA The past year saw an upsurge in research in lower Central America, by both country nationals and vis- iting scientists. A threat to cultural resources that began to accelerate in the 1970s with the increasing level of tourist development subsided as interregional conflicts diminished investor and tourist interest. Now that the area is experiencing relative calm once again, the threat of uncontrolled and uncoordinated tourist and other economic development threatens the region's cultural heritage. NICARAGUA. Ronaldo Salgado (Museo Nacion- al de Nicaragua [MNN]) and Laraine Fletcher (Adelphi University) continued research in the Esteli region of northern Nicaragua, despite increased field dangers from social and political unrest. Research is being supported by the Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research, National Geographic Society (NGS), and the Organization of American States (OAS). Building on previous survey efforts, test excavations were con- ducted at three sites. Preliminary analyses are still un- derway, but strong associations with southern Hon- duras have been noted. 758 [Vol. 58, No. 4, 1993]</page><page sequence="21">CURRENT RESEARCH Edgar Espinoza and Rafael Gonzilez (MNN) com- pleted a reinventory of materials excavated by Richard Magnus in 1974, but which were never analyzed. With this updated inventory, analyses by current museum personnel are expected to begin. Rafael Gonzilez and Dominique Rigat (MNN) con- tinued research in the Lake Managua Basin, increasing the number of sites in the regional inventory; so far, all sites identified range in time from A.D. 300 to 1520. In early 1992, Rigat was awarded his doctorate from the Sorbonne in Paris (based on an analysis of lithics frm an earlier project carried out in the Chontales area of Nicaragua with Franck Gorin), and he plans to con- tinue research in Nicaragua. Jorge Zambrana (MNN) is participating with Silvia Salgado (State University of New York-Albany) in sur- vey and excavations near Granada, Nicaragua. The project is supported by an National Science Founda- tion (NSF) Dissertation Improvement grant to Salga- do, and is emphasizing the development of a regional chronological sequence and a more detailed under- standing of Precolumbian settlement patterns. Al- though deep in the heart of the Greater Nicoya Ar- chaeological subarea, some of the sites show strong ceramic affiliations with southern Honduras. Rafael Gonzalez also participated with Lena Flodin and Ake Johansson (Swedish Cultural Assistance Pro- gram) in the first season of survey of Zapatera Island in Lake Nicaragua. Frequently visited, and in some sectors heavily vandalized, this island was the original location of many of the famous stone statues frequently identified with Nicaraguan archaeology, but has never been systematically surveyed. Evidence to date sug- gests occupation from A.D. 300 to 1520. This survey in particularly urgent because, despite the fact that the island is part of a national park, there are plans to build a tourist hotel on the island. In February and early March 1993, Frederick W. Lange (University of Colorado-Boulder) coordinated the first half of a three-week training course for young Nicaraguan archaeologists, and other Nicaraguan mu- seum and university personnel. The course was funded by the OAS, and 20 persons participated in the first module. The course included a three-day field-survey component in the area of Lake Moyua, about 60 km north of Managua. The lake is currently dry, and two large "islands" in the middle of the lake both contain extensive Precolumbian settlement remains dating from A.D. 300 to 1520. Richard Cooke (Smithsonian Trop- ical Research Institute [STRI]-Panama) was the guest lecturer during the third week of the course and pre- sented a series of lectures on floral and faunal analyses in archaeology. COSTA RICA. John Hoopes (University of Kan- sas [KU]) conducted a second field season of research on Golfito Bay in southern Pacific Costa Rica. The project was funded by the NSF, with additional support from KU's Office of Study Abroad and General Re- search Fund. Research focused on the study of rela- tionships of three sites discovered during survey in 1990 (Current Research 57:728-729), with an overall temporal range from A.D. 200 to 1500. Additional site survey was also conducted. Research focused on re- covery of faunal and shell remains for reconstruction of prehistoric hunting, fishing, and agricultural pat- terns. Ceramic and lithic artifacts were also recovered. The prehistoric occupants appear to have taken ad- vantage of the enormous biodiversity presented in the bay environment. Juan Vicente Guerrero (Museo Nacional de Costa Rica [MNCR]) has continued work in Guanacaste province, concentrating on rescue excavations at late Zoned Bichrome period cemetery sites, supported by emergency funding from the NGS. He also conducted excavations at a large cemetery with numerous cre- mations at a site at the foot of the Cordillera of Guan- acaste. The cemetery appears to date to the early Pol- ychrome (A.D. 500-800) period. Ellen Hardy received her doctorate from the Uni- versity of California-Los Angeles, based on the anal- ysis of mortuary patterns from the Nacascolo site on the Bay of Culebra, Pacific Costa Rica. Wilson Valerio (MNCR) also reported on excava- tions at the Pleistocene site of Nacaome, where fossil bones were found with human artifacts in apparent association. Analysis of bones from a mastodon re- vealed numerous butchering marks. Radiocarbon anal- ysis of the bone is in process. In May 1993, the National Science Foundation sponsored a research-planning workshop at Cuajini- quil, Costa Rica, where 20 Central American, North American, and European archaeologists discussed the current status and future of research in Greater Nicoya. PANAMA. Luis Alberto Sinchez and Adrian Bad- illa (Universidad de Costa Rica) prolonged the exca- vations at the 2,200-500 B.P. Cerro Juan Diaz site, under the auspices of the Panamanian Institute of Cul- ture. They recovered part of a dwelling capped by large quantities of polychrome and modeled pottery. Three burial units were also investigated, and a variety of gold, faunal, and shell artifacts were recovered. This find will modify existing models for cultural geography in Precolumbian Panama. Work continues in 1993 with assistance from a NGS grant. Richard Cooke (STRI) and Gonzalo Tapia (Univ- ersidad de Panama) are continuing their actualistic re- search into artisanal fishing on Parita Bay. Data from an intertidal barrier trap near Aguadulce are beginning to suggest strong correlations between seasonal climatic variations and the movements of various species of turtles and fish.
