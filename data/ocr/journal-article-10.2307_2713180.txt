<plain_text><page sequence="1">Inscribing the Self in the Heart of the Family: Diaries and Girlhood in Late-Victorian America JANE H. HUNTER Lewis and Clark College SCHOLARS HAVE EMPHASIZED THE DISCONTINUITY IN THE LIVES OF such middle-class women as Jane Addams and M. Carey Thomas, who emerged from sheltered Victorian girlhoods into the social activism and committed vocation of New Women. In particular, they have stressed the role of college education in breaking the dependence of daughters on families. Without minimizing the significance of the collegiate experience for women, this paper suggests that the roots of turn-of-the-century change also extend back into the Victorian family itself. The practice of the diary, for one, contributed to the development of the "enhanced sense of self," which one scholar considers central to claims of New Women for a public role. It did so without requiring girls to reject the support or many of the familial principles of home. ' This paper focuses on the function and the practice of the Victorian girl's diary, providing an analysis of the strategies by which girls used diaries both as technique and discipline in their formalization of one kind of self.

We know Victorian girls in the United States as avid readers -of romances, biographies, his- tories, and serials. A rich scholarly literature now debates the signif- icance of their reading to their own aspirations, the publishing industry, and turn-of-the-century culture.2 Victorian girls were also avid writers. They spent long hours at writing desks producing pages of letters, composing poetry, copying passages from literature, keeping all man- ner of diaries and journals. The historical literature has been less attentive to the cultural significance of girls' writing. Like their reading, girls' writing emerged in the context of new leisure available when parents hired servants; like reading, its meaning was shaped by parental hopes for refinement and improvement. And like reading, parental expectations could not control the fantasy released in private literacy. Unlike reading, writing obliged girls to organize their daydreams or structure their self-scrutiny, to experiment with a voice that they could call their own. The diary initiated a discourse about the self rather than establishing a definition of what the self was or ought to be. Diary-keepers and advice-givers alike often failed at first to distinguish girls' individu- alized needs and desires from familial roles. As Michel Foucault sug- gested about sexuality in the nineteenth century, the act of writing constrained individuals as much as it freed them. Parents and authorities promoted diary-writing among girls as an effort to contain selfishness and encourage conformity to social expectations. Like the Catholic confessionals described by Foucault, diary-writing was an internalized discipline of the self. But like the Greco-Roman rituals also described by Foucault, diary-writing became a constructive "technique of the self," adopted lovingly by girls.3 As both discipline and technique, diary-keeping contributed to the process by which late-Victorian girls amassed fragments of experience into identity. The exhortation to diary-keeping in part reflected the flowering of a romanticism which encouraged the recording of reveries as part of an exploration (or construction) of the secular self. Karen Lystra's work demonstrates how the experience of romantic love in nineteenth- century America fostered an "ideal of an essential self, what we today call a personality," which challenged a God-centered universe.4 Yet religious moralism made an equally important contribution to the Vic- torian idea of the self. Richard Rabinowitz's history of religious ex-</page><page sequence="3">DIARIES AND GIRLHOOD 53 perience notes the impact of an activist moralism in challenging Cal- vinist passivity. As orthodoxy crumbled, the characteristic narrative of the self changed from the conversion narrative to a daily diary which documented a route to salvation through good deeds and regular habits.' The Victorian tension between the dictates of romanticism and mor- alism was nowhere more apparent than in adult relations with children or youth. Though adults claimed rights to privacy for themselves, and granted them to other adults, they generally did not extend these rights to their children. Although they often presented their daughters with diaries for self-exploration, they remained ambivalent about girls' rights to a self separate from family duties and responsibilities. The conflict between romanticism and moralism especially in adults' relations with youth is apparent in the historiography of Victorianism. Thus, Peter Gay celebrates the nineteenth century as "the golden age of the diary," and argues that self-reflective diaries "became almost obligatory companions to a class endowed with a modicum of leisure."6 At the same time, he notes that parents would "open children's letters, superintend their reading, chaperon their visitors, inspect their under- wear." Gay asserts, "if parents exacted truthfulness from their children, this all too often served as a screen for the brutal assertion of adult power, as an arrogant, and at times prurient, invasion of young lives."7 Unlike the romantic explorations of some Victorian adults, girls' diaries did not permit uninhibited freedom, but instead remained "working papers" filled with tension and controversy. In response to this tension, girls initiated demands for privacy against intrusive parents. They came to use their diaries not as an escape from the Victorian family, but as a way of discovering -or constructing -the self within it. "Victorian" is a contested and complex term which in America has connotations of gender, class, and region. "Victorians" -those who participated in a trans-Atlantic culture of literacy and uplift- were disproportionately female, and clustered in the middle and upper classes and the Northeast. Yet the precepts and aspirations of Victorianism spread beyond those focal groups and influenced many of those on the frontiers and many second-generation immigrants in the cities. The thirty-odd girls whose diaries constitute the primary source for this paper reflect this pattern. They lived predominantly in the urban East, and were likely to be from comfortable, even elite, native-born families. Their diaries are primarily archived in New England. As Peter Gay suggests, a degree of leisure helped to define both their lives and their</page><page sequence="4">54 AMERICAN QUARTERLY diaries and contributed to the formation of a "Victorian" sensibility. Although all Victorian girls had chores, those represented here were not "working," either at shops, in factories, or as mainstays of the domestic work force. Most were attending school. Thus, the journal of Lizzie Morrissey, second-generation Irish from East Boston and a schoolgirl, is included here along with the journals of members of the Boston elite. Although Lizzie Morrissey's family employed no ser- vants, Lizzie herself wrote an extensive diary in which she described watching the toils of mother and grandmother, excused from helping them by her attendance at Girls' High School and by the family as- pirations she embodied.8 The Victorian ideal for girlhood-like Vic- torianism itself- cast its influence well beyond those whose prosperity originally occasioned it.9 This paper is primarily a study of the role of the diary in the lives of Victorian girls; in its exploration of the interactions of romanticism and moralism, it is also a study of Victorianism itself. But it speculates about how diaries might have contributed to the evolution of a gen- eration of Victorian girls into the New Women of the Progressive Era. The dense documentation left by one diarist, Annie Winsor, especially illuminates the role of the private diary in helping girls formulate separate selves in the context of close family relations. Sharing middle- class origins and a notion of women's special gifts with their mothers, New Women differed from their Victorian mothers in their access to higher education and in their willingness to consider a public career. This paper raises the possibility that their later lives of some autonomy outside the home were in part enabled by their earlier discovery of regions of autonomy within it. Girls' diaries were the ideas of parents, who promoted diary-writing for their daughters as a means to good character and refinement. Parents had always encouraged virtuous conduct among their offspring, but in eighteenth-century New England, sustained good behavior was sec- ondary to a conversion experience as the mark of a good Christian. The disestablishment of the church and the dislocations of urbanization and industrialization ushered in new standards rewarding internalized character and steady habits. During the nineteenth century, moral char- acter became an everyday affair, and diaries assumed new importance as regulators and also demonstrations of sustained virtue. Parents pro- moted diaries as a valuable "discipline" useful in structuring time and character.</page><page sequence="5">DIARIES AND GIRLHOOD 55 Parents and advice-givers suggested journals for girls and boys. But the conventional wisdom was that girls took to diary-keeping more naturally. Agnes Repplier, who wrote a piece on "The Deathless Diary" for an 1897 issue of the Atlantic Monthly, repeated this common as- sumption: Even little girls, as we have seen, have taken kindly enough to the daily task of translating themselves into pages of pen and ink; but little boys have been wont to consider this a lamentable waste of time. . . . As a rule, a lad commits himself to a diary, as to any other piece of work, only because it has been forced upon him by the voice of authority.10 There were structural reasons for the popularity of diary-keeping among girls. The affluence of middle-class urban families marginalized daughters' work within the household. When servants were hired, as they were in approximately 15-30 percent of the households in North- eastern cities, "I girls usually had more spare time than boys. As advice- writer William Thayer put it in 1859, Many who continue to reside with their parents, have several hours at their command each day. Some spend these hours in fancy work, music, and idleness. With not a few it may be almost a study how to kill time. Thayer proposed an alternative. "What an opportunity for mental cul- ture and religious improvement!" By this Thayer did not mean that girls should indulge in introspection. Instead, he encouraged the de- velopment of order, answering the "pert miss" who asked, "how can a girl like me be orderly, when I have nothing to order?" with the wisdom, "There are [your] own wardrobes to superintend, and [your] rooms to arrange. "12 Along the same lines, of course, there was one's own life to systematize. In 1878, the children's magazine St. Nicholas gave as the first reason to keep a journal that it taught habits of order and regularity.'3 In addition to its moral purposes, the keeping of a diary joined other activities sanctioned by parents to fill the time of privileged daughters. Lessons, either in school or out,'4 were one such activity as were piano classes and exercise. Girls were urged to walk regularly, sometimes as much as two hours a day. Piano practice was even more regulated, with girls recording in their diaries their obedience to a demanding daily practice schedule. Writing in a diary, then, was a similar obli- gation, considered character-building, time-filling, and refining.</page><page sequence="6">56 AMERICAN QUARTERLY The general principles of diary-writing reflected these values. Ideally, a diarist wrote daily, and often copied her sometimes copious diary entries twice. The diary was to be a credit to a girl's accomplishments, and those included her hand.'5 Writing a diary, like a constitutional, was usually a ritualized part of the day, which often took place in the bedroom immediately prior to retiring. It was considered less stressful than schoolwork by both parents and daughters.16 Since the purpose of a journal was to train a girl in orderliness, clearly the entries themselves ought to be orderly and reflect an orderly life. The St. Nicholas adviser, W. S. Jerome, suggested a routine recording of the weather, letters received or written, money paid or received, the day of beginning or leaving school, visits, books read, all set down in the correct order of time. The end result would be a useful family history. As he wrote, "Perhaps, some evening when the family are sitting and talking together, some one will ask, 'What kind of weather did we have last winter?' or 'When was the picnic you were speaking of?' and the journal is referred to. "' 17 Clearly the journals Jerome had in mind were semi-public family records rather than per- sonal confessions. They were also designed for self-grooming along prescribed lines rather than experimentation. The advice literature acknowledged that diaries could fill different functions for girls, though, and it rushed to close off those possibilities. No diary at all was certainly better than a diary which encouraged fantasy and ambition and distracted a girl from her domestic priorities. Almost simultaneously with its publication of Jerome's 1878 article article of advice "How to Keep a Journal," St. Nicholas published two stories which represented a direct attack on the practice of school girl diary-keeping. These stories especially focused on the expanded agenda of the schoolgirl diarist and ended with schoolgirls repudiating their diaries, their fantasies, and even themselves, and taking a place again within their mothers' domestic households. Unlike Jerome's hortatory piece on diary writing, which was addressed to both girls and boys, the protagonists of these didactic pieces were both girls. The ultimate violence and finality of both these Victorian "chil- dren's" tales is striking. "Jottings Versus Doings" by Margaret Eck- erson describes a twelve-year-old diarist who renounces and then burns her diary. The eldest of several sisters, the diarist Margy is constantly besieged by demands on her time and person-babysitting duty and loans of her new silk parasol, for example. She escapes to her journal,</page><page sequence="7">DIARIES AND GIRLHOOD 57 where she embroiders on the mundane details of domestic life with musings about love, kindness, and the beauty of death. A dangerous fall down the stairs forces Margy to realize that she does not actually want to die, and she turns on her journal: "I haven't written the real truth about anything," she concludes contemptuously, and then pro- ceeds to make a bonfire of the offending book. While her mother regrets its loss, her father, a minister, concludes, "Margy's burnt journal is no loss to her, dear, . . . for sometimes there is a vast difference between jottings and doings."'"8 Beneath this mild comment lies a polemical position-a denial of Margy's right to imaginative self-definition and a reductionist insistence on appropriate role behavior as the measure of a person. Whereas Margy's problem is silly fantasy, vain ambition is the prob- lem for Dora, the heroine of Kate Gannett Wells's tale about diaries. Published in 1879 and described in the subtitle as a "Story for Big Girls," it was ominously titled "She Couldn't."'9 Alienated from her mother and brothers, fourteen-year-old Dora was a " 'funny girl' or a 'queer girl'" who ''wrote in her journal and made up stories." What she couldn't do was to reach fame by the age of fifteen. She launched several schemes for greatness, but failed in each, and finally resolved "to give up all idea of doing anything except school work and being good" -in itself a momentous undertaking. To commemorate this de- cision, she locked her door and made one last entry in her journal. Her entry took the form of two columns labeled "Wants" and "Oughts." Under the first she wrote: Want 1, to be real good; 2, to write splendid novels; 3, to be beautiful and great. Under the 'oughts' she wrote: 1, to love stupid people; 2, to make everybody happy when I can; 3, not to think about myself, but just keep going on; 4, to talk all the time to my mother; 5, never to write another word in this journal. For Dora, writing her journal was an assertion of ambition and of self at the expense of duty to others. (Interestingly, even a desire to be "real good" seemed to be overstepping.) Following this listing, she blotted the ink, tied her journal in black ribbon, had a good cry, ate some candy,20 and returned to her mother's side, saying 'Mamma, I have given up all trying after what I can't be. I am just going to love you all at home with all my heart, and then you'll love me; and I wont [sic] feel badly because I can't write books or help in big ways.'</page><page sequence="8">58 AMERICAN QUARTERLY Wells appropriately described Dora's ritual of renunciation as "a kind of funeral over herself." For it is clear that in destroying their diaries both Dora and Margy are destroying their dreams and their independent selves, and rejoining a domestic world of self-surrender. So what do we make of Wells's and Eckerson's tales of adolescent renunciation, published in one of the major magazines for youth and children in the late-nineteenth century? Together with Jerome's piece from the same decade, they set the parameters of the girl's diary. As Jerome explained, a diary should promote order and discipline, even record the writer's "progress as a thinker and writer." As Wells and Eckerson made clear, it should not indulge in fantasies, or entertain inappropriate ambitions. The advice-givers thus agreed on the goal of promoting dutiful daughters but differed on the costs and benefits of the diary to this campaign. Jerome advocated the diary as a tool for self-discipline; Wells and Eckerson feared it as a surrogate for "splendid novels" and self-absorption. The moral for all the advice-givers was the same, though (as Wells's Dora puts it,) "if I try to make you all real happy in little bits of ways, I guess it will 'come out gloriously' " -a classic message of fulfillment through domestic sub- ordination. The girl's diary was clearly not meant to participate in the introspective romanticism or the self-creation which encouraged some nineteenth-century journals. Rather, the writing promoted by St. Nich- olas had earlier roots. In endorsing writing for self-improvement, but not for fantasizing, the latter-day Puritans who published St. Nicholas were reflecting a frequently voiced Puritan judgment on appropriate reading.2" From the outset, then, diary-writing was considered both, or alter- nately, dutiful and dangerous. Girls who received diaries from mothers and fathers on birthdays participated in the explorations of duty and pleasure anticipated and feared by adult pundits. Most began their diaries in the dogged spirit of accountants of the soul. But what began as parentally enforced "discipline" often evolved into a self-referential "technique." This evolution sometimes involved only minute adjust- ments of perspective and often consisted of the internalization of strat- egies of self-discipline. Nonetheless, the evolution was real, and also practical. Girls' diaries offered them a compromise a way to release and contain rebellious impulses, however circumscribed, without breaking with families. Like their own rooms, they claimed their diaries for themselves, beyond the gaze, but within the bosom, of their fam-</page><page sequence="9">DIARIES AND GIRLHOOD 59 ilies. In these protected spaces, girls charted a middle way between the fiery rebel and the good daughter of advice books and fiction. Diaries offered several routes of mediation. Sometimes they served as surrogate battlefields upon which girls struggled to blend family ex- pectation with personal impulse. Sometimes they served as parental talismans - and as security blankets -in girls' developing relations with peers. Sometimes they served to compartmentalize desire and to fore- stall conflict. Each of these strategies enabled Victorian girls to entertain imaginative freedom while preserving the networks of affiliation at the center of their lives. The key to both the appeal and the success of the practice of diary- keeping was a growing claim to privacy- a gradual appropriation by youth of a notion central to their parents. Privacy for adults was an important Victorian notion. As recent historians of the bourgeois family have shown us, the cloak of privacy allowed for illicit behavior which was tolerated as long as it was veiled.22 The same protections were not offered to children. In fact, adults' increasing rights to privacy within their homes meant greater parental obligation to monitor chil- dren. The result was the surreptitious surveillance which we associate with Victorianism. Although we think of the Victorians as inappro- priately intrusive, their recourse to indirection was a sign of their deference to the idea of privacy. Earlier generations would have had fewer scruples about direct intervention.23 Motivated perhaps both by the greater actual autonomy of their daughters, who were no longer constantly at their mothers' elbows, and also by their own increasing responsibility for girls' upbringing, parents were often interested in the contents of daughters' diaries and journals. Earlier in the century, parents who had scrutinized their children's writings for signs of grace were not indulging idle curiosity; they were fulfilling their highest parental responsibility to see to the spiritual salvation of their children. The substitution of character-build- ing for salvation-seeking as the goal of adolescent socialization was a change in vocabulary rather than a revolution in parent-child relations .24 The result was that Victorian parents pried. The practice of Bronson Alcott's family in the mid-century was only an extreme form of common parental participation in the diary-keeping of children. Both Bronson and his wife Abba provided written commentaries on the journals their four daughters kept and sometimes read aloud for them.25 In the 1890s, Rose Nichols's mother requested a journal of her European travels for</page><page sequence="10">60 AMERICAN QUARTERLY all the family to read. And Agnes Hamilton reported a tantrum from her young brother who "flew into a terrible passion because Mamma told him to write in his diary which he keeps for Papa."26 For good reason, girls felt that they needed to declare and fight for the privacy of diaries. In fact, the unviolated diary was rare. The best-documented culprits were friends and sisters, who often flaunted their violations. A (perhaps former) friend of Emily Eliot's cracked her diary and lingered to give herself away with a comment on Emily's bad handwriting and a pre- diction: "When this meets your eye You will cry 0 fie!" Marian Nichols's younger sister Margaret wrote directly in her sister's diary "to make Marian mad." Cassie Upson's outburst against an "ugly little snip" who peeped into her "sacred diary" suggests the likely response to provocateurs.27 The language used on the covers and the front pages of diaries to warn off snoops was similarly direct and unmuted, quite distinct from much of the Victorian language of circumspection which characterized entries in diaries. In invoking a claim to privacy, Victorian girls knew they were invoking a household God. Emily Eliot had attempted to warn off her critical friend in 1870 with a front page inscription: Look not in this book for fear of hate. For except to the owner it is strictly private. Ella Lyman titled her notebook of scattered thoughts "Private pages," and then elaborated, "To read another's secret is a crime. Pause and reflect and dare not do so! " Mary Thomas declared that if anyone read her diary, "I should hate them forever after for it, that is unless I gave them permission. "28 Within these curses and ritual incantations girls unleashed a kind of vocabulary -including the harsh "hate" which otherwise was outside of appropriate usage. This harsh language was a necessary defense, for among the issues that girls broached in their diaries, tentatively and carefully, were their relations with parents and authority. For extremely good reasons, con- cerns for privacy accompanied challenges to authority. In 1882, when she was fifteen years old, Margaret Tileston made the following (for her) momentous entry in her journal: "In the a.m. after church, Papa told me not to read the Bible. Very well, I acquiesce. Perhaps he considers it a bad book for the young." After writing that covert</page><page sequence="11">DIARIES AND GIRLHOOD 61 criticism of her father, Tileston grew concerned and at the bottom of the page made a resolution: "That this diary be not perused by others." At some later reading she regretted both the implicit criticism and the resolution of privacy, and attempted to obliterate both. Mary Thomas was not as protective of her diary, nor as circumspect within it, but when she challenged her father's view of the world (and simultaneously advanced a plan for her own financial security), she imagined how it might strike him: if I ever have to work for my living, I think I will give lessons in Calysthenics [sic].... I wonder what Papa would say, if I was to read him this part of my Journal, he would feel like shaking me, he has so much pride, he could never bear to see his daughter teach &amp; right there where he is so well known &amp; everyone thinks he is so well off too.29 Mary Thomas made her secret a potential challenge to the great secret of her father's insolvency. Diaries allowed girls to at least experiment with (and sometimes even savor) the feeling of challenging parental authority.30 Having done so, they transformed their energies into a defense of their privacy. As long as such challenges were still secret, they were safe. And as such, secret diaries facilitated the development of a multi- facted itself. Claims for privacy allowed for girls' experiments in independence without subjecting them to the battles and isolation of earned autonomy. With private diaries, girls could have it both ways retaining the protected status of obedient daughters at the same time that they carved out a measure of imaginative independence. With private diaries, they could compartmentalize their experiment. Diary-keepers agreed initially that the goal of being good required the suppression of self and the subordination of girls to their mothers. In the antebellum period, thirteen-year-old Louisa Jane Trumbull ex- pressed a series of motivations for diary-keeping which characterized later diarists as well: "In keeping a journal I at first did it because my sisters kept one- afterwards I wrote because it was the wish of my mother." Now, she wrote, "it is done not only to serve as means of being employed about something useful and proper but because it is a source of pleasure to me."'3' This sequencing suggested the role of family, including older siblings, in sponsoring diaries; when sociali- zation was most successful, girls internalized familial standards and defined their pleasure in the same breath as doing something useful and proper.</page><page sequence="12">62 AMERICAN QUARTERLY A prototypical model for this journey to goodness was literary-the immensely popular Stepping Heavenward by Elizabeth Payson Pren- tiss, the daughter of a Congregational minister. Stepping Heavenward appeared first in 1869 in fictional diary form and over the years sold 100,000 copies. It documents the efforts of Kate, a willful daughter, to grow up and be good. As with many actual diaries, Stepping Heav- enward begins on a birthday with a series of resolutions. Kate no sooner makes these resolutions (while lolling in bed before school) than she breaks them (she grows late, forgets her prayers, disobeys her mother, and storms out the door). Her mother knows best, however, for upon Kate's return home, she finds her mother smiling wisely and a new writing desk in her room. This writing desk will allow Kate to keep the first resolution she has made -to begin her journal.32 It is clear that at the least, writing a journal, like her other resolutions, is a form of self-denial that will lead to self-improvement; at the most, it might even be the exemplary discipline that will set the pattern for other forms of self-control. Charting Kate's progress through the loss of her father and a disappointed love affair, Stepping Heavenward finally brings Kate to a love of God and a simultaneous reconciliation with her mother. Her minister responds to her desire for greatness with a gentle reminder that her first act of heroism should be in "gratifying her mother" by helping around the house. The morality play and the plan for action embodied in Stepping Heavenward were clearly models for adolescent diarists. If some of its readers "felt that they had written Stepping Heavenward them- selves" (as some were said to have),33 others attempted to use it as a model for their own chronicles of improvement on the way to good character and to womanhood. Mother and daughter Georgia Mercer [Boit] and Mary Boit both read Stepping Heavenward repeatedly, iden- tifying with its impetuous heroine and its hopeful message of the possibility of improvement. For young Georgia, writing at the age of eighteen in the post-Civil War South, moral improvement meant in- creased love for God. On her nineteenth birthday, she stayed up late to ask for spiritual aid in serving God in the coming year, and recorded it in her journal.34 Georgia Mercer married a Bostonian and died young, leaving behind two daughters to a privileged existence. In 1891 her eldest daughter Mary Boit, who had remained in extended mourning, read and reread Stepping Heavenward, unaware that she was replicating the experience</page><page sequence="13">DIARIES AND GIRLHOOD 63 of her mother years before. Like her mother, Mary Boit also identified with Kate, but she focused on her efforts to be good rather than on her efforts to believe. She especially identified with Kate's hot temper and her anger towards her mother, for Mary Boit had a troubled re- lationship with her new stepmother. "I think that Katherine in the book before she gets good is exactly like me," she wrote. "I feel the same ways. I love her &amp; I love the book this is my third time reading it. On my birthday I am going to try to turn over a new leaf &amp; be a better girl." Twenty years and half a continent apart, mother and daughter patterned their experience on the same template-using the occasion of a birthday to redouble their efforts for goodness, and to record these efforts in a moral account book.35 There has been much debate over the impact of Victorian propriety on Victorian behavior.36 Schoolgirl diaries testify to the strength of norms of denial and repression for girls in that era. The resolutions sprinkled throughout diaries suggest that exhortations to self-denial and service were not simply the stuff of advice manuals, but made their way into girls' own self-expectations. At the age of sixteen, Charlotte Norris made the following plans for the year 1886: "Duty shall precede pleasure. Save ten dollars by June 1st. Bathe regularly every day. Use chest weights every day until June 1st." In 1892, at nineteen, Marian Nichols offered a graver list: Incipit hic Vita Nuova. Resolved. not to talk about myself or feelings. To think before speaking. To work seriously. To be self restrained in conversation and actions. Not to let my thoughts wander. To be dignified. Interest myself more in others. Repentance is good, but it should not distract one's thoughts.37 Marian Nichols's listing of resolutions all tended to a narrowing of her possibilities-of conversation, action, thought. Even the feelings of guilt and repentance themselves, those staples of the Victorian mental diet, should be spurned as indulgences, a digression from the dull business of being good. Nichols's list of negations and self-denials recalls the adolescent negation of another member of the Boston elite of an earlier era, the self-renunciation of Alice James, -the invalid sister of Henry and</page><page sequence="14">64 AMERICAN QUARTERLY William James. At the age of fourteen, James wrote in a later account, she discovered "what Life meant for her." What it meant was a kind of smothering of impulse, desire, -and expression. I had to peg away pretty hard between 12 and 24, 'killing myself,' as some one calls it-absorbing into the bone that the better part is to clothe oneself in neutral tints, walk by still waters, and possess one's soul in silence. By nineteen, Alice James's struggles to suppress her spirit and negate desire had led to a breakdown, to "full-blown hysteria," according to her biographer Jean Strouse.38 Alice James's life story is a famous and extreme case of the impact of narrow parental expectations on girls' behavior and self-estimation. Her description of the mysterious moment of self-repression and ne- gation which ended her autonomous life at the age of fourteen resembles the black-binding or the burning of diaries -the funerals over the selves -mentioned in St. Nicholas fiction. We know about her decision of denial only because of an adult autobiography. Other girls used their teenage diaries as battlegrounds in these psychic wars, exhorting their wills to ride herd on their rebellious spirits. Agnes Hamilton's re- markable diary of her life in the illustrious Hamilton family is primarily a prolonged account of her struggles to be better. Within the terms of the Hamilton family (not so different from those of the James family), this meant in part to be more accomplished. Agnes made plans not to loiter, to stop talking so much, not to speak unkindly about anyone, not to read so many novels, and "not to think of myself and how stupid I am but of other people and how bright and splendid they are."39 Agnes Hamilton's girlhood diary is a document in self-discipline. But it is also a confessional diary which reveals some growth in self- understanding. At the age of nineteen, after four years of making and breaking resolutions, Hamilton made an important New Year's reso- lution: not to make so many resolutions, "never to plan at night what I shall do the next day . . . never to plan in the summer what I shall do in the Winter or in one term what I shall do in the next." The purpose of this resolution was not to give up resolutions entirely (for it is a case in point), but to make them more realistic. Therein Agnes acquired greater tolerance of herself by virtue of a better understanding of her family. "All this planning and never carrying out," she rec- ognized as a family characteristic. And she even went so far as to say that it might not even be a fault "for we would be pretty miserable if</page><page sequence="15">DIARIES AND GIRLHOOD 65 we had to come out of our air castles."40 After pages of writing about herself in which she inveighed against egotism and self-preoccupation, Hamilton used her understanding of the dynamics of her family to forgive herself. In the efforts of girls to be good and repress self, diaries seem to have had a moderating effect. Certainly keeping a diary which recorded successes and failures on the road to virtue was an additional incentive to be good. A success could be recorded and celebrated. ("I was good and did not do much of anything," Mary Boit recorded ambiguously at the age of ten.)4" At the same time, an always-listening, never- judging diary was something of a tonic. Girls who talked enough about their efforts to be good availed themselves of a simplified version of the "talking cure" which would be used soon by Sigmund Freud and Josef Breuer with middle-class Viennese girls. (The disproportionate number of adolescent or late-adolescent females in Freud and Breuer's early work, and indeed the role of hysteria in their formulation of psychoanalysis, corroborates the special salience of language therapy for Victorian girls.42) Diarists were likely to talk themselves through some of their most censorious impulses and end up with a modicum of self-awareness. It is significant that Alice James, whose adolescent renunciation represented a victory for the dark side of genteel Victo- rianism, did not record her life and her thought in diary form until she was forty-one and only then did she declare and explore the renunciation of her youth years before. Had she embarked on this venture in younger years, the creative transcendence that Jean Strouse attributes to the articulation of a "voice of her own" might have modulated her earlier decision of denial. Within their diaries, girls assiduously recorded their efforts to be better-echoing, internalizing, and ultimately softening parental im- peratives. Just as diaries moderated parental dictates, they mediated parental identifications. As Katherine Dalsimer suggests, they proved to be revisited "transitional objects" useful in the processes of ado- lescent separation.43 No other metaphor quite captures the depth of attachment which girls sometimes demonstrated to their "darling" diaries than that analogy to the anthropomorphic blanket or teddy-bear of early childhood. Literally within vessels chartered and christened by parents, Victorian girls embarked on imaginative journeys which did not threaten to take them too far from home. The function of the diary as mother substitute emerges especially</page><page sequence="16">66 AMERICAN QUARTERLY dramatically in the disproportionate number of full, emotive, conver- sational diaries kept by girls without mothers. Elaine Showalter has observed that many Victorian women writers had lost, or were alienated from, their mothers. Showalter concludes that the resulting male-iden- tification contributed to their careers. The diary evidence from the United States suggests that the loss of a mother in itself may have encouraged writing a form of communication with an absent or imag- ined other which may initially have been a lost parent.' For bereaved adolescents, a diary might function to preserve the memory and the moral voice of a lost or absent parent and to retain some level of parental participation from beyond the grave.45 For girls whose parents were living, the role of the diary as a tran- sitional object, not only "of," but "away from" parents, was more direct. Girls frequently resorted to diaries to experiment with and negotiate new allegiances. Diaries granted more freedom than parents; girls could take on new attachments without abandoning old reliances. Thus, when Margaret Tileston went away to boarding school and developed a crush on an older girl, she recorded it in her diary- as well as the news that she had just written a twelve-page letter to her mother, "the longest letter I ever wrote."46 And when Helen Hart fell in love with her cousin, she confessed to her diary the prolonged anguish of one "who had never a thought, much less a sorrow" without sharing it with her mother.47 Such confessions to diaries replaced those to parents -but with parents' informal acquiescence. The diary was thus a tool for legitimating the ongoing reorientation of girls from parents to peers. Often the diary's role in this transition was not symbolic at all, but quite concrete. Like rolling hoops, diary-keeping was a late-Victorian recreation which girls sometimes shared with friends. The playful fabrication of different personas in diaries was an engrossing amuse- ment within Victorian friendships. Girls described writing diaries to- gether in their rooms, on New Year's Eve, at boarding school, and even in the park.48 Shared diary-keeping carried more possibilities for emotional ex- perimentation than rolling hoops, and diaries often became actors in the friendships themselves. Girls who wrote diaries together frequently wrote about each other, producing provocative documents that became the stuff of suspicion and intimacy. Writing diaries became a way of confessing, protecting, or creating secrets too private for speech. Mary</page><page sequence="17">DIARIES AND GIRLHOOD 67 Boit spent a delightful vacation with her cousin Manny "a witch and a gypsy," with whom she became infatuated. The two girls did not do much at Manny's summer house on Cape Cod, Mary explained, except "write in our js [journals], bathe, read, and draw." They had a tiff, however, over Manny's request (which Mary refused), to let her read her journal. "Poor little witch," Mary exclaimed, repenting all the while. "I really think she will have to as I like her so much." Manny's reading of Mary's journal, of course, would let her know, as it does us, of the depth of her cousin's secret admiration.49 Writing both privileged and protected that secret. Without the embarrassment of spoken avowals, writing could sum- mon a world of high seriousness distant from casual schoolgirl banter. The exchange between schoolmates Mattie Walker and her friend Mary Thomas (recorded by Walker in Thomas's diary) is a case in point. Walker had seized Thomas's diary in playful protest at being denied permission to read it. After ribbing Thomas for her appetite for peaches and then her penchant for flirtation, Mattie Walker's thoughts became more serious, as she explored the possibilities of writing for confession. Mary Thomas if I tell you something you declare that you wont tell. Did you know that I am engaged to a fellow that I talked about so. You have been the only person that I have ever told. Dont never tell Lessie or Ida [roommates], for I would not have any bodie to know it for anything now please dont tell, I was ashamed to tell you with my mouth so I will tell you by writing it; you can judge yourself who he is, I cant tell you if I do I will have to tell a story for I promise him that I would not tell it; if you ever tell I never will forgive you. I never will speak to you. Well I must close. Please dont let any bodie see this. Good bye my honest friend. I remain yours until Death. Despite her conversational writing style, Mattie expressed shame at the idea of "telling with my mouth," revealing another dimension to the dynamics of the diary. In a Victorian world which celebrated civility, the diary could function as a conduit around awkwardness- even for such blithe spirits as Mattie Walker and Mary Thomas. As Ellen Rothman discovered in her study of Victorian courtship, writing allowed for intimacy which direct conversation inhibited. Written ex- pression of course need never be acknowledged.50 For the same reasons that parents might encourage their daughters to write to them-as a way of communicating without the embarrassment of face-to-face</page><page sequence="18">68 AMERICAN QUARTERLY expression-girls might use their diaries among themselves. Writing allowed for the keeping up of appearances. And that seemed sometimes to be the point of girls' diaries. Self- governance was expected in feeling no less than conduct, and the diary could prove both a convenient receptacle for- and an incitement to- emotional spillover. In addition to moderating harsh norms and me- diating new allegiances, the girl's diary could inspire and then com- partmentalize confusing emotions. Almost all diaries contained at least one moment of a confessional nature-sometimes crossed out, some- times written down the spine in minute handwriting, sometimes just left dangerously on the page. But there were some girls for whom the diary's primary purpose seemed to be to provide a safe ground for documenting, exploring, and disciplining nascent sexuality. Victorians strictly limited open expressions of sexuality, but as Foucault persua- sively argues, they dramatically encouraged discourse about sexuality. Precocious sexuality was both most censured and most discussed-an adult secret imperfectly kept from adolescents themselves. Harriet Burton's diary, written between the ages of thirteen and seventeen, is a document "saturated" with desire. Initially, when she embarked on her diary at the age of thirteen in 1887, she was reticent: "I find it rather hard to confide all my 'inmost soul' to a journal for my 'inmost soul' is -very inmost! " But before long, she had discovered the purpose for which she came to rely on her diary -what she would later call her "de-praving-deep raving. " Though she felt her passion "cannot be natural" for anyone her age, and imagined "how anyone would laugh, how greatly amused they would be at the mere idea of a 'mere-child' of fourteen-loving," she found her feelings "sweet" and despaired at the difficulty of doing them justice -of keeping them from seeming "small and weak." Her self-descriptions are as one crazed -for instance in this passage after her arrival for a summer visit in Oneonta, New York. I am in a very hilarious frame of mind today, and can hardly curb my prancing spirits enough to 'wright' as this scrawl bears witness. My silvery voice has been heard at all hours of the day rolling forth in diabolical waves of laughter, and striking terror into the souls of the inhabitants of the house. My mind is so filled with plans which wont come true that I'm nearly crazy. My emotions for other people . . . become so conflicting that they brake from the narrow bounds of my inner man and find vent in a mad race around the house.</page><page sequence="19">DIARIES AND GIRLHOOD 69 Despite her descriptions elsewhere of complete freedom for outdoor escapades of all kinds, Harriet Burton described herself here as a confined hysteric, very much within the mode of the "mad woman in the attic," the mad woman of Gothic romances. Her confinement was clearly metaphoric, a fictive imprisonment of impulse within a fragile shell. As in much of women's Gothic literature, Burton saw herself as really two people-a passionate inner self and an outer mask, "a placid calm expression of contentment on my face." And she lamented "how dreadful has [providence] been in giving no times of solitude times which the soul may assert itself and the face throw off the mask, and break out and away from conformity and be itself." In her appro- priation of the spiritual term "soul" to refer to her uninhibited impulse, Burton demonstrates a modern, romantic tendency to regard human desire rather than moral conduct as the core of the authentic self. For Harriet Burton, the only place where this self could be con- fessed-with all its inadequacies-was in her diary. "It seems so ri- diculous and sentimental to think of writing in a journal, and I would not for anything have anyone know that I keep one," she wrote. "But I will confess it to myself it is a sort of comfort to sit and write, although it is only talking to myself, and it is often putting down in black and white the things I most despise myself for." She explained the same day, when she was seventeen years old, what is evident from the diary itself, that her diary was for a special purpose. "I only keep this book to write in when I feel a sort of wild feeling like this." She was determined not to be "such a creature of emotions and strange passions," and looked upon her diary as an "outlet.""5 Harriet Burton's description of her crazed state of mind and her need for writing as an outlet are echoed by Charlotte Perkins Gilman's fictional heroine in her 1892 story "The Yellow Wallpaper." In Gil- man's tale, a physician-husband has forbidden his wife (the narrator) from writing, arguing that "with my imaginative power and habit of story-making, a nervous weakness like mine is sure to lead to all manner of excited fancies, and that I ought to use my will and good sense to check the tendency." The protagonist (a Gilman surrogate), demurs though: "I think sometimes that if I were only well enough to write a little it would relieve the press of ideas and rest me," she remarks.52 Burton's experience bears out both physician and protagonist. As the physician-husband argues, Burton's "nervous weakness" -or per- haps simply normal libido-did lead to "all manner of excited fancies,"</page><page sequence="20">70 AMERICAN QUARTERLY which were initially fueled rather than dissipated by the act of writing. But as Gilman's alter ego points out (and Gilman knew as a writer herself), the writing eventually helped to play out the fantasy and relax the writer. After a many-paged reverie of unfocused fantasy, Harriet Burton checked herself with her own "will and good sense." The wisest thing that I can do is to go and duck my head into cold water, eat something then go downtown where I can see plenty of faces, real ones, then come home study my latin-real latin, then go to bed, a real bed,- to real sleep, get up in the morning eat a real breakfast, go to school make some real recitations, by that time I may be in the realms of reality and common sense!53 In Gilman's story, the physician-husband was the censor of fantasy, but in Burton's diary, the writer had become her own censor; either rested or fatigued she had orchestrated her own return to reality. As in girls' efforts to be good, the impact of the diary was a moderating one. The diary could soften behavioral commands issued by internalized authority; and it could also give rein, and then harness runaway fan- tasies. As such it offered a middle way, a way of integrating feelings of independence with social expectations for appropriate behavior. The use of youthful diaries alone as the major evidence for under- standing the function of diaries has something of a self-referential quality. We usually have few outer sources to suggest how they fit into the context of a full life. The extraordinary paper collection left by Annie Winsor rAllen], however, allows us to assess the relationship of her private "journal" as she called it, to other ways of writing about and formalizing her life. Her writings demonstrate the way that a girl's private diary might function as a "compartment" for exploration and release within the context of an overarching loyalty to familial values. In addition to her private journal, Winsor wrote numerous letters to various family members and kept a diary for her parents to read. Winsor's journal allowed her private space within the heart of her close and even intrusive family, while her diary was the work of a dutiful daughter. Together Winsor's writings allowed her to express her griev- ances and affirm her separate opinions without threatening her familial lifeline. The resulting compromise between parental domination and personal rebellion helped her to go on to a notable career as a Pro- gressive educator, while she continued to be sustained by her natal family. Winsor's characteristic Victorian diary was an accomplice in</page><page sequence="21">DIARIES AND GIRLHOOD 71 her transformation into a New Woman of the turn of the century. Winsor grew up in Winchester, Massachusetts, the daughter of a normal school graduate and a Harvard-educated physician. The former Ann Ware Winsor was a powerful presence, both inspiring and over- bearing. She took seriously her responsibilities for supervising the moral development of her seven children, and to this end, she expected access to their thoughts. Annie kept a college diary "For My Mother dear, and because it is for her, For My beloved Father," and when another daughter mentioned a journal she was keeping, her mother requested to see it. Most of all, Ann Winsor insisted upon reading her daughters' letters to other family members. When Annie was traveling in England at the age of twenty, for instance, her mother confessed that her feelings were hurt at not being the recipient of confidences exchanged among the sisters. Mary does not show me your private letters to her; which makes me sorry. ... I don't love to think that my children say things &amp; feel things that they are absolutely unwilling that I should know, even though I can understand their not wanting to say them at first hand. She had no choice but to conclude, somewhat contrary to the evidence, that "Still, I can trust my children, &amp; I do trust them."54 Her daughters, for their part, despaired of ever pleasing her, and alternately retreated from and resisted her intrusiveness. At the age of twenty-one, Annie wrote a revealing letter to her mother. I know very well-and I know it much to my mortification that I seem sort of sneaking and evasive when I am with you (and indifferent too). I have worried about it and even cried over it, mother. The conclusion I've come to is this. I am so afraid of the criticism, correction or dissatisfaction that may be in your face and eyes that I do not dare to look up. She concluded with insight, "You see I care more than anything else at home to be a daughter who shall repay all the worry and care that have been expended on her."55 Especially on the matter of reading personal letters, though, the eldest sisters attempted to take a stand in defense of their privacy. The elder, Mary, in a letter addressed to her fourteen-year-old sister, asked that her mother be instructed to wait her turn "and that meantime she must possess her soul in patience and not be fired with jealousy." It was easier when the sisters grew older and had left home, Mary thought,</page><page sequence="22">72 AMERICAN QUARTERLY "so that my letters to you won't either be shown round or make the family jealous by being kept for yourself." Voicing incantations more often used to defend diaries, the younger Annie at age twenty began a personal letter to her sister with a series of warnings: "Pedlars and mothers ragmen and sisters warned off the premises. Private. No Ad- mission Except on Business! All rights reserved." And the next year, she addressed a curt reprimand to her mother for her snooping: "How did it happen, I wonder, that the letter you forwarded was opened. Can you explain the principle if you please?"56 In the face of this intrusiveness, Winsor kept a private journal to help her think about the rights of young people. Begun when she was sixteen and continued through the age of twenty-one, her journal con- sisted of high-minded reflections on the appropriate relations between the generations, a forum which allowed her to vent her frustrations with her own upbringing obliquely. In contrast with the direct language she used in defending her privacy, the private journal itself used the language of high-Victorian rationalism and abstraction (and the ob- fuscation of either the third person "one" or the first person plural). Through these means, Annie Winsor began to express a rebellion against her mother which she could not admit to more personally. She started her journal with an epigraph: "What youth saw plainly manhood loses sight of," and went on to explain her goals: "to help me to remember my faults, and my convictions as relate to the behaviour of older people toward younger." (She later simply referred to "O.P.s" and "Y.P.s.") She also voiced her hopes that her journal would remind her in later years "to try to keep up with the fashions and with the new manners and customs which are continually coming and going, so that when I have young people in my charge I may be in sympathy with them, and not restrain them with my 'old fashioned ideas.' "57 She embarked on a program of reflection ("Must we girls never think of the questions of love and marriage?"), self-admonition ("I incline to be too heavy and serious"), and resolve ("Perfect goodness is the only thing worth aiming at"). Her journal tentatively voiced complaints about her censorious home environment. "I can't see why a person who is evidently trying to do right as hard as she can, should ever be blamed as harshly as though she meant to do wrong," she wrote, and then pondered "why any person should ever be blamed harshly at all." She explored her claims to privacy, a right she had declared on the cover of this "private" journal. "I have a hatred of showing letters</page><page sequence="23">DIARIES AND GIRLHOOD 73 which come to myself," she wrote. Certainly parents had a respon- sibility to make sure the letters were suitable, she agreed, and she even agreed that "in the case of letters of general interest this feeling should be overcome. . . ." But at eighteen she protested having "one's faults, failings or anything of that personal kind talked of before a whole family. 58 Before she was done, Annie Winsor had offered the skeleton for a generational rebellion against parental authority. She observed that little children often expect "to love without liking" because adults make themselves so disagreeable. She defended peer culture arguing that "the way for people to have a really delightful time is to be with their equals." She supported the custom of going out to commercial estab- lishments-presumably soda fountains or fairs-with young men, "since young men have no way of returning the hospitalities shown them by ladies except by taking the ladies to places of amusement, etc." And she even defended, and participated in, sexual high-jinks. To me, there is an exquisite thrilling pleasure in real, hand to hand, private 'fooling' with a boy that I like.... And yet I can easily see that an older person ought not to openly countenance it. I don't think it does me harm, but-positive good-it sort of ennobles me.59 Her vocabulary was high-minded, but with it Annie Winsor was de- fending the "ennobling" qualities of sexual pleasure and the rights of youth to defy parental dictates. Winsor's journal from her sixteenth year was written in 1881, when she was a student at coeducational Winchester High School. She went on to attend the Harvard Annex (later Radcliffe), to teach school and participate in social reform, and then to found her own school, the Progressive, coeducational Roger Ascham school. Under a pseudonym she wrote frequent columns of advice on women's subjects. Winsor became an archetypal New Woman, attending college, marrying late, developing a career, and campaigning for sex education-however euphemistically she delivered her advice.0 Her private journal was an important part of that development. In the measured voice of a true Victorian, she used that protected space to chip away at the fetters of obligation and guilt which still constrained her. Her critique declared a generational revolt. Winsor's bid for personal autonomy within her family was always muted by family claims, and it is for-this reason that her journal needed</page><page sequence="24">74 AMERICAN QUARTERLY to be private: she was in no way eager to sever family bonds, quite the contrary. "It is my duty to confide in my mother, even though it be most difficult for me," she wrote after a declaration of her need for privacy. And that same year, she observed in her journal that journal- writing did not always satisfy her, that it seemed a little abstract and remote. "I want something more substantial. So I write to my mother. I can put my love in as much as I like.""6 Winsor might rail in her journal against the way Old People misunderstood Young People, yet she remained too dependent on her parents' moral and emotional uni- verse to break away from home completely. Ultimately Winsor wanted to be good, and depicted her life as an independent woman with the moral earnestness of a good daughter. In this she shared emotional bedrock with Dora, Kate Gannett Wells's heroine who finally set aside her ambitions, bound her journal in black and resolved "to talk all the time to my mother," and "to love you all at home so you'll love me."62 But unlike Wells's heroine, Winsor did not forswear her ambitions- or her journal. Rather she protected her conflicted self within its private pages. This claim for privacy allowed Victorian girls to assert new selves without rejecting their domestic identities. They thereby could maintain without being oppressed by the maternal bonds which many historians see as the heart of the nineteenth-century women's world.63 For Victorian girls, a blend of private experiment with public loyalty made sense. Diary-writing by itself did not turn Victorian girls into New Women, but it allowed them saving compromises. Private diaries allowed for the retention of familial ties without forcing girls to retain familial destinies. Of course, one could argue that this effect was primarily conservative-that diary-writing provided a safety-valve which re- leased and contained rebellious impulses, preventing the telling break with family that might lead to "true" autonomy. Recent work in the social science of adolescence, however, has suggested the importance of familial connection to the formation of identity. Research on priv- ileged girls from troubled families concludes that "even in difficult circumstances, young women may struggle to maintain connection in order to know themselves and to be known by their parents."'M Both our understanding of domestic culture and recent work on adolescent maturation suggest the advantages of exercises in identity which al- lowed Victorian girls to have it both ways: to entertain imaginative freedom while preserving the networks of affiliation at the center of</page><page sequence="25">DIARIES AND GIRLHOOD 75 their lives. Sustained by rather than isolated from natal families, Vic- torian girls participated in the modest historical evolution of their era. This evolution was not without conflict, as attacks on the entire practice of the diary made clear. The willingness of a figure such as Kate Gannett Wells to condone the black-binding of a diary as a funeral over the self suggests the strength of the opposition to girls' separate selves. A clubwoman and educational reformer, Wells was also a leading Boston "anti" -an opponent of the woman suffrage movement. Her rejection of secret diary and of secret vote reflected her support for an older notion of a domestic sphere where women set aside self for service. Such diarists as Harriet Burton and Annie Winsor, who ignored Wells's moral admonitions (if they read them), used their diaries for explorations of themselves, including their own innermost "deep rav- ings." Victorian girls worried about egotism, but in writing a diary about themselves-of whatever sort-they affirmed their rights to a degree of autonomy. Like Winsor and a scattering of other Victorian girl diarists, Harriet Burton went on to marriage and to a significant public life, in her case, as a leading turn-of-the-century suffragist.65 The disagreement between Kate Gannett Wells and Harriet Burton over the rights of women to the vote embodied a more fundamental difference between Victorian and Progressive ideology over the autonomous fe- male self.66 Not necessarily "New Girls," Winsor and many other Victorian schoolgirl diarists nonetheless became New Women. Barbara Sicher- man has argued the significance of reading in broadening the horizons of Victorian girls and stimulating their later accomplishments as Pro- gressive women.67 But writing provided an even more active exercise in mediating between parental authority and personal autonomy. The mediations diaries accomplished in the exploration of sexuality, the indulgence of fantasies, and the forsaking of mothers for peers rep- resented small but enabling victories over the constraining force of domestic rectitude. Girls continued to write diaries in the twentieth century, but under different parental dispensations -at once less demanding and less in- trusive. In popular culture today, diaries are almost exclusively the domain of the preadolescent girl -often merchandised in pastel colors with lock and key already affixed. But without the authority of the parental mandate (and the moralist religious premises behind it), and</page><page sequence="26">76 AMERICAN QUARTERLY without the intrigue of possible surveillance, the appeal of the girlhood diary has diminished-and with it, too, cultural validation for the containment, rather than the enactment, of adolescent strife. NOTES 1. Carroll Smith-Rosenberg states that New Women "repudiated their mother's world" (245). "College education thus functioned to draw young women out of their mothers' and grandmothers' domestic mindset" (253). "The New Woman as Andro- gyne: Social Disorder and Gender Crisis, 1870-1936," in Disorderly Conduct: Visions of Gender in Victorian America (New York, 1985). Sara M. Evans suggests that the first generation of New Women "had been formed in the intense world of women's colleges" and notes the "stark choice" they faced on graduation between "the traditional domesticity of marriage and a career of paid work" (147). Born for Liberty: A History of Women in America (New York, 1989). In contrast, Nancy Woloch describes how the New Woman of the turn-of-the-century "integrated Victorian virtues with an activist social role." She also refers to the "enhanced sense of self, gender, and mission" which characterized the New Woman's move outside of the family. Women and the American Experience (New York, 1984), 269. 2. Ann Douglas initially blamed the development of a popular (and debased) sen- timental culture on the reading habits of women and girls. The Feminization of American Culture (New York, 1977).

The diaries of the eighteenth and nineteenth century were kept as often by men as by women, and served a variety of purposes, both practical and religious. While some diaries provided useful chronicles of farm and family life, others documented an ongoing relationship between self and God. Rabinowitz's account describes the importance of diaries to devotionalism as well as to moralism. He describes devo-</page><page sequence="27">DIARIES AND GIRLHOOD 77 tionalism as private and intimate, especially an urban phenomenon, and characterized by female parishioners. Rabinowitz concludes that many devotional diaries "were kept by urban middle-class women, for whom devotionalism offered a flowering of one's internal spirituality that compensated for a woman's declining role in social and economic spheres." Richard Rabinowitz, The Spiritual Self in Everyday Life (Boston, 1989), 39, 257, 164. In noting the importance of separating spheres; Rabinowitz echoes the work of historians of the middle class, who emphasize the significance of the development of separate public and private spheres in generating a new kind of romantic self-con- sciousness, to which women were especially prone. Margo Culley, A Day at a Time (New York, 1985) underscores the significance of women's separate sphere to their diary-writing. "As the modern idea of the secular diary as a 'secret' record of an inner life evolved, that inner life-the life of personal reflection and emotion-became an important aspect of the 'private sphere' and women continued to turn to the diary as one place where they were permitted, indeed encouraged, to indulge 'self- centeredness'" (3). Culley's work, like the work of Rabinowitz, sees the diary as compensation for women, a world they turned to with increasing frequency because it offered them a freedom unavailable elsewhere. 6.

Hall notes the imprecations of seventeenth-century moralists who warned "Let not your Children read these vain Books, profane Ballads, and filthy songs.

Flaherty writes of colonial New England "The prevailing theory of family government, while beneficial for the main- tenance of good order in a Puritan society was inimical to personal privacy.

Foucault describes the dynamics of "pleasure and power" which characterize challenges to rulings on appropriate sexuality, but his analysis applies equally well to subterfuges of other kinds of authority: "The pleasure that comes of exercising a power that questions, monitors, watches, spies . .. and on the other hand, the pleasure that kindles at having to evade this power, flee from it. . . . Capture and seduction, confrontation and mutual reinforcement: parents and children, adults and adolescents . . . all have played this game continually since the nineteenth century."

Sigmund Freud attributes the origins of psychoanalysis to Josef Breuer's work with hysteria. "The History of the Psychoanalytic Movement," in A. A. Brill, trans. and ed., The Basic Writings of Sigmund Freud (New York, 1938), 933. Elaine Sho- walter writes of patient Bertha Pappenheim [Anna 0.] that "Anna O., in fact, was the inventor of the 'talking cure' of psychoanalysis, Breuer's partner in a remarkably shared and egalitarian therapeutic exchange." The Female Malady: Women, Madness, and English Culture (New York, 1985), 155. Pappenheim was a bright, young woman of the middle class, who upon leaving school had become bored with enforced do- mesticity. "Her monotonous family life and the absence of adequate intellectual oc- cupation left her with an unemployed surplus of mental liveliness and energy, and this found an outlet in the constant activity of her imagination, a disease considered to affect young women." Freud and Breuer, Studies on Hysteria 1895-1898, The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud, vol. II, trans. and ed. James Strachey (London: The Hogarth Press, 1955), 41-42. Brumberg suggests that Victorian girls lacked "voice," and resorted to appetite as one way of "speaking." "Since emotional freedom was not a common prerogative of the Victorian adolescent girl, it seems reasonable to assert that unhappiness was likely to be expressed in nonverbal forms of behavior." Fasting Girls, 138. However, like therapy, the diary represented one solution to the problem of emotional restraint that Brumberg sees embodied in food refusal. 43. This term is introduced and explored in Dalsimer, Female Adolescence: Psy- choanalytic Reflections on Literature (New Haven, 1986).

In fact parental loss complicates the process of adolescent development by blocking normal separation impulses. Instead the mourning adolescent seeks to sustain rather than to attenuate the maternal bond. Dalsimer, Female Ado- lescence, 124. 46.

See also correspondence between 15-year-olds Eleanor Hooper and Annie Winsor: "Perhaps but few girls have experienced this longing so soon as we, for as a rule, womanhood comes before such feelings can grow while we are but girls in our first teens.... There are few girls with such mature, intense natures as we have. In truth, as far as I can find out, we have the thoughts and feelings of women with the few years and inexperience of little more than children."

In a letter to Mrs. Eickhoff, dated 29 Oct. 1907, she explained that "the virginal delicacy of a girl's very nature, the instinctive shrinking that is part of our own rightful inheritance" makes it inappropriate to "speak graphically and explicitly to any girl." But she did feel that a girl should know "from the time she enters her teens, that children, like flowers and all young things, spring from the union of a life-giving essence with a seed of the race," Winsor papers, Schlesinger Library. 61. Journal of Annie Winsor, May 1885, [n.d. 1885?] 62. Wells, "She Couldn't," 462-67. 63. Carroll Smith-Rosenberg has emphasized the significance of mother-daughter bonds to nineteenth-century female identity. "The Female World of Love and Ritual," and "Hearing Women's Words," in Disorderly Conduct. Mary Ryan describes daugh- ters and mothers "lolling [together] in placid domesticity." "As in Chodorow's ty- pology," she writes, "the Victorian daughter enjoyed a privileged position in a feminine</page><page sequence="31">DIARIES AND GIRLHOOD 81 universe where with relatively little trauma and at an easy pace, she learned her adult gender role from her mother, the source of her first and most enduring emotional connection." Cradle of the Middle Class: The Family in Oneida County, New York, 1790-1865 (Cambridge, 1981), 193-94. As Carol Dyhouse has observed, even Virginia Woolf, who wrote so famously about killing "the angel in the house" remained at heart divided. Her strong words represented "the rational, intellectual part of herself," while her portrait of Mrs. Ramsay in To the Lighthouse "the apotheosis of that Angel," represented the emotional bond, and was a tribute to the memory of her mother. Girls Growing Up in Late Victorian and Edwardian England (London, 1981), 38. Woolf's strong words were perhaps the part that less forthright predecessors might have secreted in diaries. Thus Woolf reversed the Victorian pattern, with her public words of rational discourse bolder than the private emotions which emerged in the loving portrait of Mrs. Ramsay. 64. Judith P. Salzman argues the significance of attachment to adolescent devel- opment. Referring to the inadequacy of Freudian theory in this area, she suggests that "orthodox assumptions regarding adolescent development have not fully recognized the continuing importance of family attachments." "Save the World, Save Myself: Responses to Problematic Attachment," in Carol Gilligan, et al., eds., Making Con- nections: The Relational Worlds of Adolescent Girls at Emma Willard School (Cam- bridge, Mass., 1990), 111. 65. Harriet Burton Laidlaw was active in the New York Woman Suffrage Party, and after 1917 was one of the directors of the National American Woman Suffrage Association. Her husband, James Laidlaw, whom she married in 1905 at the age of 32, served prominently in the National Men's League for Woman Suffrage, "Laidlaw, Harriet Burton," Notable American Women. 66. New work suggests the importance of nineteenth-century women's culture to modern ideas of the self. Lystra, Searching the Heart, documents the role of romantic love in creating the modern idea of a unique "personality." Gilian Brown, Domestic Individualism: Imagining Self in Nineteenth-Century America (Berkeley, 1990), argues the role of domestic ideology "in updating and reshaping individualism within nine- teenth-century American market society." My view contributes to this literature, but stresses the conflict between romanticism and moralism in setting the terms for female identity and for a domestic woman's sphere. 67.
