<plain_text><page sequence="1">EVIDENCE FOR THE ORIGINS OF THE PUEBLO KATCHINA CULT AS SUGGESTED BY SOUTHWESTERN ROCK ART POLLY SCHAAFSMA CURTIS F. SCHAAFSMA Rock art studies have indicated that the katchina cult and associated religious sodalities arrived in the Pueblo Southwest in the early 14th century from the Jornada region of the Mogollon. Recent studies of prehistoric Pueblo social organization suggest that population aggregation after A.D. 1150 led to the need for means of intravillage social integration. It is proposed that the arrival of the katchina cult and its widespread acceptance occurred in response to this need for intravillage integrative mechanisms. THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION focuses on certain rock art styles in the Southwest and the information that these have brought to bear upon particular aspects of prehistoric Pueblo Indian society and religion. Recent rock art surveys in Arizona and New Mexico have led us to propose that many modern Pueblo religious concepts and ceremonial institutions, including the katchina cult, either entered the Anasazi world directly from the Jornada Mogollon (Lehmer 1948; Marshall 1973) between A.D. 1325 and 1350 or were rapidly developed in response to the new ceremonial concepts from this direction (Fig. 1). The implications that follow from this statement are numer- ous, and some of these will be examined below. First, however, it will be helpful to review the ethnographic data pertaining to the katchina cult in the Southwest in order to outline its modern distribution and to provide a background against which the archaeological configuration can be drawn. It will be observed that the history of the katchina cult as reconstructed from ethnographic data on its distribution (Dozier 1970) is somewhat different from that provided by archaeology. ETHNOGRAPHIC DATA Katchinas are benevolent anthropomorphic supernaturals vaguely considered ancestral and associated with clouds and rain. They very often personify the power in objects such as the sun, earth, corn, and so forth, and bring rain and well-being to the people. Although it is these supernaturals which are personified in the masked dances, the dancers also are referred to as katchinas. Ethnographically the katchina cult crosscuts clan affiliations and serves as an integrative device within the village. It is strongest and most highly developed among the western Pueblos, specifical- ly at Hopi, Zuni, and at the western Keresan villages of Laguna and Acoma. It is secondarily complex among the Rio Grande Keresans (Zia, Santa Ana, San Felipe, Santo Domingo, and Cochiti) and Towa Jemez, and it is less important in the Tewa villages (Tesuque, Nambe, San Ildefonso, Santa Clara, and San Juan). Katchina supernaturals are not impersonated in the north- ern Tiwa pueblos, and at the southern Tiwa village of Isleta, they are said to have been introduced by ceremonial refugees from Laguna at the end of the 19th century (Dozier 1970:156). The foregoing pattern of distribution has led ethnographers to suggest that the cult, with rain-making as one of its prime functions, was introduced to the eastern Pueblos from the drier areas to the west. Frank G. Anderson (1955, 1956, 1960), who has made an exhaustive study of the subject, is of the opinion that Zuni is the primary source for the diffusion of the cult: Zuni remains . .. the most important source for much of the cult, originating many basic features as well as details. This widely held opinion is based on the obvious complexity of all aspects of the cult here, and its thorough integration with the general socio-ceremonial organization [Anderson 1960:377]. Dozier (1970) implies that the katchina cult was brought to the Rio Grande by an influx of population from the west around A.D. 1000, possibly a Keresan immigration. The rain-making 535</page><page sequence="2">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY A AWAIuvI I HOTEVILLA 8 SANTA CLARA 15 SANTO DOMINGO B PUERCO RUINS 2 ORAIBI 9 NAMBE 16 SANTA ANA C POTTERY MOUND 3 SECOND MESA 10 SAN ILDEFONSO 17 SAN FELIPE D TENABO 4 POLACCA II TESUQUE 18 ZUNI E HUECO TANKS 5 TAOS 12 JEMEZ 19 ACOMA F CASAS GRANDES 6 PICURIS 13 COCHITI 20 LAGUNA 7 SAN JUAN 14 ZIA 21 ISLETA Fig. 1. Map showing relevant archaeological sites, modern Pueblo villages, and cultural sub-areas of the Southwest. function of the cult helps to substantiate this view. He points out that among the Keres, the mythical homes of the katchinas is said to be in the west, at a place called Wenima. Due to the simpler nature of the cult in the Tewa villages, ethnologists have proposed that the Tewa borrowed it from the Keres during prehistoric times (Dozier 1970:174). Although the Tiwa Indians of Taos, Picuris, and Sandia are said to hold a fairly typical series of beliefs concerning katchinas, the objective features of the cult in these villages are few or lacking. Thus, based on distributional data from modern pueblos, the history of the cult can be recon- structed as moving from west to east, and as noted above, this reconstruction is assumed by Dozier to have considerable time depth. Anderson (1955:416-417), on the other hand, proposes that the cult, although definitely pre-Conquest in age, is not very old among the Pueblos, being in his opinion a "relatively late specific manifestation" of a more generalized underlying set of beliefs and practices. He also considers the possibility of cultural influences from Mexico leading to the development of the cult in the Southwest. In keeping with this trend of Anderson's thinking is the evidence provided by rock art distribution and other graphic material, clearly suggesting that the cult was not present among the Anasazi until the early or mid-1 300s, and that its primary source was the Jornada Mogollon to the south (Schaafsma 1972:161-162). The implication is that the modern pattern of the distribution of the katchina cult outlined above is recent. Obviously, the history of the cult will need to be reexamined in light of the archaeological evidence. 536 [Vol. 39, No. 4, 1974 F -..:.:...:::, a r A ^UATwA Ir .. . _ _ _ ._ _ _ _ . . . _ . _ _</page><page sequence="3">ORIGINS OF KATCHINA CULT THE KATCHINA CULT IN SOUTHWESTERN ROCK ART The first and unequivocal appearance of the katchina cult in the Pueblo world is between A.D. 1325 and 1350 with the advent of a new art style in the Anasazi domain referred to as the Rio Grande style (Schaafsma 1972). The style occurs most dramatically in the rock art and in the elaborate kiva murals of the Pueblo IV period (Smith 1952; Dutton 1963; and Hibben 1960, 1966), although elements of the style are also found on late black-and-white and early glaze wares. It also occurs on artifacts such as ceremonial pipes (Kidder 1932:156-182). It is important to stress (1) the distinct break that occurs between the Rio Grande style and the rock art which precedes it both along the Rio Grande itself and on the Colorado Plateau, and (2) the iconographic and stylistic continuity between the Rio Grande style style and the Jornada style rock art from the Jornada division of the Mogollon. Anasazi Rock Art Prior to A.D. 1300 Anasazi rock art prior to A.D. 1300 has its roots on the Colorado Plateau west of the Rio Grande Valley. In general, it can be lumped into a single conservative tradition which manifests a unified pattern of growth and change from its first appearance with Basketmaker II sites to its subsequent developments through Pueblo III times, a period of about 1300 years. This tradition is characterized by a variety of elements-anthropomorphs, fluteplayers, quadrupeds (including both lizards and mammals), birds, snakes, animal tracks, hand- and footprints, and simple abstracts such as spirals, concentric circles, and wavy lines (Turner 1963:6-7; Schaafsma 1972:3). Depending on the time and place, intricate geometric pottery and textile designs may also be found. In Basketmaker sites, relatively complex human representations are commonly large in size, with trapezoidal or rectangular bodies. These figures occur both as solid or outlined depictions, often elaborated with sashes, necklaces, earbobs, and peculiar headgear. The head itself varies in size, and features are shown only occasionally. This form of anthropomorph gradually gave way to generally smaller, simpler representations which continued to characterize Anasazi art until after A.D. 1300. The latter are usually solidly pecked into the rock, and numerous types of stick figures varying from lifelike to rigid abstract types are most typical of the last part of this era. Throughout this time the humpbacked fluteplayer with his distinctive attributes of hump, phallus, and flute is the only personage which can be identified with certainty. Although other figures are shown wearing headgear which may have ritual significance, there is nothing that can be interpreted clearly as a katchina in this rock art. The implication that the cult is not present at this time is further strengthened by Dean's observation (1970:166) that none of the characteristic artifacts associated with the katchina cult are present in the extensive collections from the Tsegi Canyon cliff dwellings, most of which date from the Tsegi phase between A.D. 1250 and 1300. Animal representations also tend to be basically simple. Like the anthropomorphs, they are usually solidly carved with small heads and have few distinctive features. Mountain sheep and deer may be distinguished by the presence of antlers or horns and cloven hooves. Long-tailed qua- drupeds may represent mountain lions. Lizards and "lizard-men" and birds are other life forms depicted. Wavy lines may signify snakes, and sometimes this interpretation is supported by a blob at the end which suggests a head. The specific figure types encountered and the emphasis given one element over another vary throughout the Anasazi area according to the place and the time period involved, but essentially this constellation of figures is basic to the old Anasazi rock art tradition. The Rio Grande Valley and neighboring regions, between the river itself and the high plains to the east, marks the eastern edge of the Pueblo world. The pre-14th-century Puebloan rock art found in the vicinity of the Rio Grande seems to have derived from the Plateau, although there are larger numbers of very ele- mental abstracts such as wandering lines, rakes, circles, sunbursts, reticulate patterns, and rows of dots in some of these sites. The Jornada Style The second art style of concern here is the Jornada, which appears in the Mimbres and Jornada Mogollon of southern New Mexico and in the vicinity of El Paso, Texas, at the same time that the Schaafsma and Schaafsma] 537</page><page sequence="4">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Anasazi tradition is flourishing in the northern parts of the Southwest. The Jornada style was present in and near the Mimbres Valley perhaps as early as A.D. 1000 where it appears in the petroglyphs as well as in the decorative life motifs on Mimbres Bold face and Classic Black-on-white pottery. As yet, its earliest appearance in the Jornada division has not been firmly dated. However, indications at present suggest that it appeared in this area around A.D. 1150, and the style is believed to have persisted there until the end of the El Paso and San Andres phases be- tween A.D. 1375 and 1400 (Lehmer 1948:87). The Jornada art style has been described in detail in a recent publication (Schaafsma 1972:95-122). Complex mask drawings and a wide variety of life figures in bold outlines, varying from naturalistic renditions to extremely formalized designs, characterize this rock art. Zoomorphic representations include fish, turtles, serpents, tadpoles, and occasional insects, as well as the usual mammalian quadrupeds. The latter tend to be highly stylized and decorative, frequently depicted with humped backs and bent legs, and their heads are given special emphasis. They are usually shown with eyes and long snouts, and teeth may be indicated. The many birds are shown either in profile with raised wing, or as formalized "thunderbird" types in a frontal position with tail down and wings out to either side. Anthropomorphs, also rendered in outline, show the same range from naturalistic to stylized forms. Other elements of significance found in Jornada rock art are equilineal crosses and cloud terraces with rainbows in the base. Mask representations are more characteristic of the Jornada than they are of the Mimbres region. Painted masks, well-known from Hueco Tanks northeast of El Pao (Newcomb and Kirkland 1967:173-202) are very sophisticated in design (Figs. 2 and 3). Commonly, they are shown with almond-shaped eyes and a small triangular nose, while the rest of the face may have abstract negative or positive decoration. Jornada-style petroglyph masks show these same basic characteristics but lack the exquisite detail which is possible in the paintings. Double dots often occur in the eyes of the petroglyph. One of the personages represented in Jornada-style art has the attributes of the Mexican deity Quetzalcoatl. For example, among the Jornada-style petroglyphs east of the Mimbres Valley is a mythical being with the head of a bearded man and a forward-projecting horned headdress (Schaafsma 1972:106). The figure is shown with arms reaching forward, but the body is that of a snake which curves out behind. Irregularities at the end of the tail suggest rattles. Portrayals incorporating similar features have been recorded from Mimbres pottery (Fewkes 1916:539; Cosgrove and Cosgrove 1932, PI. 230e). The Rio Grande Style Sometime after A.D. 1300, just shortly before the demise of the Jornada Mogollon, the Rio Grande style with figure types and iconography in Jornada style appears among the Anasazi in the Rio Grande Valley north of Socorro and as far west as the Hopi villages. Indications are that this style, containing most of the religious symbolism found in modern Pueblos, spread rapidly throughout the Anasazi domain once it was adopted. A katchina representation on a Talpa Black-on-white sherd from Taos County (Wetherington 1968:56), dating no later than A.D. 1400, testifies to an early knowledge of the katchina cult in the northernmost pueblos along the river, although neither the cult nor the art style ever prospered here as they did elsewhere. The earliest of the elaborate kiva murals at Hopi Awatovi date from the late 1300s (Smith 1952), and the presence of masks, Jornada-type quadrupeds, and other elements in the petroglyphs at Puerco River Village in the central Little Colorado river drainage with a terminal date of 1350 (Gumerman and Skinner 1968:196), further substantiates the immediate adoption of the complex by the Pueblo Indians. It might be argued that the central Little Colorado river drainage received some previous Jornada style contact from Mimbres sources west of the Jornada region. For the most part, however, the style in the intervening Mogollon Mountains is only sparsely represented by isolated figures (Schaafsma 1972:27, 84). It is more likely that this configuration reached Hopi and other western Pueblos at least in part from Pottery Mound, an important early Pueblo IV site dating 538 [Vol. 39, No. 4, 1974</page><page sequence="5">ORIGINS OF KATCHINA CULT 0 5 10 15 cm 0 2 4 6 inches 4'vX w 0 5 10 15 20 cm 0 4 6 8 inches 47DDDDD4j) 1 81 Nt' Fig. 2.

This large village had at least 16 elaborately painted kivas, the earliest of which are believed to date from around the mid-1300s (Hibben 1960, 1966). Extensive contacts between Pottery Mound and the western Pueblos, including Hopi, are well-demonstrated through the pottery. As in the Jornada style, a dominant motif in the Rio Grande style rock art is the mask. Early mask paintings from the Tompiro section (Mera 1940) near the old pueblo of Tenabo (Schaafsma 1972:131-135) share many characteristics with Jornada mask representations, suggesting that the southeastern Pueblo region had close ties with the nearby northern Jornada Mogollones (Fig. 4). The masks in question are curved in outline, but the top of the head is flat and decorated with a series of vertical feathers. The paintings are done in thin washes of red, yellow, and turquoise-green, and the faces are elaborated with delicate negative patterns. One of the masks has each eye indicated with two dots. All of these features, as well as their very elegant and abstract nature, are traits held in common with Jornada style masks. Complete anthropomorphic figures from the same vicinity are portrayed with the sashes and kilts of modern katchinas as well as with abstract masks. To the north and west, mask depictions continue to be numerous both in the neighborhoods of the old Tano pueblos of the Galisteo Basin and along the Rio Grande itself from San Marcial below Socorro to Frijoles Canyon at the northern edge of the Keresan section. Many of these are simplified, showing only the head outline with eyes and possibly a nose and mouth; others are rendered in enough detail to relate them to individual modern katchinas (Figs. 5 and 6). The Rio Grande style encompasses not only numerous representations of masks and ceremonial figures but a rich inventory of other elements as well. There are thick serpents with forward-reaching horns, two-horned serpents, and a variety of birds and animals in outline form. Many of the latter with hunched backs and bent legs are indistinguishable from their Jornada prototypes although, on the whole, the Rio Grande-style figures tend to be less elaborate. The old Anasazi standbys-the deer and mountain sheep-are found only occasionally, while skunks, badgers, rabbits, and small quadrupeds of unknown identity are an especially common group. Large mountain lions are depicted in some localities. The Jornada cloud terrace and the rainbow, which are taken for granted in Pueblo art today, make their appearance at this time, and the four-pointed star begins to figure importantly in the iconography. Certain elements such as the spiral, concentric circle, tracks, handprints, and the fluteplayer are carried over from earlier times, with stylistic differences in some cases. It has been proposed that the Rio Grande-style, with its distinctive complex of Jornada-like figures, may be viewed as an archaelogical document of a new religious and ceremonial pattern in the Pueblo world. In addition to the katchina cult, the presence of which is evident in the [Vol. 39, No. 4, 1974 540</page><page sequence="7">ORIGINS OF KATCHINA CULT 0 5 10 15 20 cm 0 2 4 6 8 inches Fig. 4.

Petroglyph panel near Cochiti. numerous masks, the subject matter suggests that other institutions and ideographic systems also may have been either newly introduced or elaborated at this time. The representation of the horned or plumed serpent, commonly found in association with star figures, is significant in this regard. As the star and the horned serpent are symbolic of Quetzalcoatl in Mexico, and figures with attributes of this deity are present in the Jornala style of southern New Mexico, it seems reasonable to suggest that this Mexican personage began to assume importance in the northern parts of the Southwest when we find this symbolism so apparent in Pueblo art. Archaeologists have suggested that round towers in San Juan Anasazi sites may indicate the presence of the Quetzalcoatl cult in the Pueblo III period, and one instance of a painting of a plumed serpent in the vicinity of the round towers of McElmo Canyon has been cited (Ferdon 1955:8-12). Comparatively, the round tower-Quetzalcoatl connection in these instances is somewhat nebulous, however, whereas the numerous depictions of plumed or horned serpents and stars in Pueblo art after A.D. 1325 indicate that the cult or a clearly derivative aspect of it had unequivocally arrived. The presence of shields and shield-bearers in Rio Grande-style art suggests that the warriors' association may have developed as a part of this ceremonial complex. A particular stress on hunting and war is characteristic of the Tanoans (Dozier 1970:171) and, near the old Tano villages in the Galisteo Basin and within the Tewa province, spectacular shield designs and arrows have an important place in the rock art. Petroglyphs of mountain lions may have been made in connection with the hunters' association that is symbolized by this predator. Most of the known rock art examples of this animal, along with the famous stone lions (Hewett 1938), are found in the vicinity of the Pajarito Plateau, the highland hunting grounds for the Keresans as well as the Tewa (Schaafsma n.d.). More will be said about the significance of these ceremonial sodalities later. 542 [Vol. 39, No. 4, 1974</page><page sequence="9">ORIGINS OF KATCHINA CULT Returning now to the earlier consideration of the distribution of the katchina cult, it is apparent that the situation is more complex than it first appeared. Katchina representations made soon after A.D. 1325 in the Pueblo IV period (A.D. 1300 to Spanish contact) are numerous in the rock art of the southern Pueblo regions, a circumstance implied by their apparent Jornada origin. The close lose similarities between the Tompiro rock art art and that of the Jornada are important here. Along the Rio Grande itself, petroglyphs indicate that the katchina cult was, and still is, of considerable significance among the Keresans. The many carvings in the Piro and southern Tiwa sections of the river, including the vicinity of Tiwa Isleta, are indistinguishable in subject matter from those in theresan section, thus suggesting that the in the Keresan section, thus suggesting that the cult was strong and widespread widespread among all of the southern Pueblos on the Rio Grande at one time, regardless of linguistic divisions. The paintings of masked ceremonial figures on the walls of the painted kiva at Kuaua (probably also Tiwa) reinforce this view, as do Spanish accounts from the mid-1600s that suggest that the katchina cult was flourishing everywhere in the east at that time (Anderson 1955:410). The complex katchina representations near the Tano ruins of the Galisteo Basin, which pre-date the Pueblo Rebellioinin 1680, are noteworthy in light of the fact that among the modern Tanoan speakers (the Towa Jemez with a well-developed katchina cult being an exception here) the katchina cult has a marginal aspect (Dozier 1970:176). Prehistoric katchina representations in the Tewa province are found in abundance as designs scratched into the wall plaster of cavate rooms in ancestral Tewa villages on the Pajarito Plateau (Chapman 1938), but their occurrence among the petroglyphs along the Tewa stretches of the Rio Grande is not frequent. They appear in notably smaller numbers here than in the Keresan area to the south, suggesting that the cult never reached the proportions among the river Tewa that it achieved among the Keresans and southern Tanoans, in spite of the fact that refugees from the Tano villages joined their Tewa relatives north of Santa Fe when the Galisteo Basin was abandoned around the time of the Pueblo Rebellion (Dozier 1970:61-62). Thus, the northeastern part of the Pueblo world along the northe nort reaches of the Rio Grande seems to have been truly peripheral in regard to the distribution of the cult. As noted earlier, by the time one reaches the northern Tiwa villages of Taos and Picuris, the cult has virtually disappeared. Also, there is nothing in the rock art in the Taos district to indicate that the cult flourished here before the historic period (Schaafsma 1972:169-183). One of the most obvious reasons for the greater complexity of the cult today among the western Pueblos is that these villages escaped the intense oppression inflicted on all of the eastern villages and particularly on the katchina cult by the Spanish friars in the 1600s, who attempted to eradicate native religious practices in order to replace them with Catholicism. It is highly likely that while the cult was being repressed along the Rio Grande (and possibly, in the case of the southern Tiwa, even destroyed), it was not only very active among the western Pueblos, but that new developments were taking place. Diffusion of such changes and innovations from these western centers at Zuni and Hopi back to the Rio Grande would contribute to the appearance that the entire cult had originated in the west. Spanish oppression, however, does not explain the simpler nature of the katchina cult among the prehistoric Tiwa or its failure to be adopted as an institution by the northern Tiwa. These circumstances will probably be best explained by an in- vestigation of the relationships between the cult and the total sociocultural matrix. SOCIO-CULTURAL IMPLICATIONS OF THE KATCHINA CULT Up to this point we have discussed the Rio Grande style and its concomitant ceremonial aspects largely within an historic framework. Anderson has proposed that there long existed in the Southwest and Mexico a general set of beliefs and practices which preceded the development of the katchina cult and prepared the way for its acceptance and efflorescence among the Pueblos (Anderson 1955:407). It is necessary, however, to inquire more specifically into the reasons why the presumably new ceremonial institutions, which included the katchina cult and the associated relatively flamboyant art style, were adopted by the Pueblo Indians. These Indians had, from all appearances, until that time a conservative religious and artistic tradition grounded in the centuries of the Colorado Plateau. What changes were wrought in the total cultural system once this Schaafsma and Schaafsma] 543</page><page sequence="10">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY ceremonial complex from the south arrived? Or more to the point, what sociocultural developments occurred in the Anasazi area that allowed the widespread adoption of this ceremonial complex? On the basis of what is known about the social organization in the Southwest at that time, it is possible to suggest some answers to these questions. Archaeological studies in recent years have demonstrated that the Anasazi settlement pattern after A.D. 1150 was characterized by trends toward increasing population aggregation and the development of larger villages (Hill 1970:88; Dean 1970:151; Zubrow 1971:137). In commenting on this trend in eastern Arizona, Longacre has pointed out that the development of larger villages must have been accompanied by concomitant sociocultural changes: Related to these changes was a change in the nature of the organization of the community itself. Villages up to A.D. 1300 probably were more commonly composed of single localized lineages. The economic advantages accruing to larger aggregates of people in the face of environmental pressures resulted in the establishment of communities of more than a single lineage after 1300. Strong localized lineages are not conducive to a strong village integration when a village consists of several lineages. I would expect the development of integrative ties that crosscut social groups to develop within the village under these circumstances. These would be such things as the development of societies with strong ritual functions, the breakdown of the association of kiva with clan, and the assumption by the kivas of more villagewide significance (for example, by association with societies). Crosscutting integrative mechanisms such as these would promote community solidarity at the expense of the disruptive lineage strength, and this is the pattern today among the western Pueblos [Longacre 164:1455]. The formation of multilineage villages would, as Longacre indicates, have led to the need for means of intravillage social integration that crosscut lineages and produced an integrated whole. It is our proposal that the arrival and spread of the Rio Grande art style in the early 14th century documents the appearance of socioreligious institutions capable of successfully integrating the multilineage villages which were forming at that time in the Pueblo region. As discussed above, the major identifiable components of this art style are related to the katchina cult and a number of sodalities such as the warrior and hunting societies. Ethnographically, all of these institutions function to integrate multiclan villages. They all share the salient feature of drawing their membership from the entire village, thus crosscutting lineage affiliations (Dozier 1970). Furthermore, it is evident that these are the specific "integrative ties" to which Longacre alludes. In expecting the development of the necessary mechanisms of social integration to take place in the cultures that were in need of them, Longacre was in harmony with Anderson (1955), Dozier (1970), and many others who have viewed the katchina cult and other pueblo sodalities as indigenous developments. The evidence provided by rock art studies, however, indicates very strongly that these institutions did not develop in situ. Rather, they or their prototypes had been present in the culture of the Jornada Mogollon for perhaps 150 years previously. They were incorporated into the Anasazi cultural systems at the point when the trend toward aggregation had become irreversible and lineage-oriented institutions and concepts were proving incapable of the task. Once these components were adopted, they would have furthered the trend of village growth and social integration (Hill 1970:99), leading to the formation of the modern pueblos as they were when first contacted by Europeans in 1540. Unquestionably, this proposal needs to be examined in depth and cannot be regarded as proven. It does, however, provide a conceptual framework grounded in empirical data from which hypotheses for future work can be generated. Acknowledgments.
