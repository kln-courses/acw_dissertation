ROBINSON, Editor Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore NECROLOGY Alan Blakeway died October 9, 1936, at the age of thirty-eight. He received his education at Shrewsbury School and Christ Church, Oxford, where he took a first in Greats. For six years he was a master at Winchester. In 1931 he was ap- pointed Fellow and Tutor in Ancient History at Corpus Christi College, Oxford. After the death of Humfry Payne, he assumed temporarily the duties of Director of the British School in Athens. With Payne he had excavated in Crete and at Perachora. He had only recently begun to publish the results of his archaeological researches: "Pro- legomena to the Study of Greek Commerce with Italy, Sicily and France in the Eighth and Seventh Centuries B.C." in the B.S.A. xxxiii, 1932-1933, pp. 170-208; "Demaratus," J.R.S. xxv, 1935, pp. 199-149; and "The Date of Archilochus," an essay in the volume presented to Gilbert Murray on his seventieth birthday, Greek Poetry and Life, pp. 34-55.

The history, archaeology, and topography of Thessaly were his province; it is probable that by his work he did more than any of his contemporaries to systematize and clarify our knowledge of Thessaly. The results of Stahlin's work are to be found in two excellent books, Das Hellenische Thessalien, Stuttgart, 1994, Pagasai und Demetrias (with Ernst Meyer and Alfred Heidner), Berlin and Leipzig, 1934, and in many very good articles in Pauly-Wissowa- Kroll, Realencyclopdidie der Klassischen Alter- tumswissenschaft (beginning with the word Glaphyrai). Stihlin's articles on Thessaly prior to 1994 are listed in the bibliography of Das Hel- lenische Thessalien. Since 1994 the following have appeared: "Thessalien als Brticke zwischen der Nordeuropiischen und igiischen Kultur in der Stein- und Bronzezeit," Festschr. Hampe, Niirn- berg, 1996; "Inschriften aus Thessalien," Ath. Mitt. lii, 1997; "Das Schlachtfeld von Pharsalos," Bldtter fiir das Bayerische Gymnasial-Schulwesen, lxviii, 1931; "Zur Thessalischen Strategenliste," Philologus, lxxxviii, 1933; "Zu I.G. IX2, 90 u. 91, Inschr. aus Narthakion," ibid., lxxxix, 1934; "Das Leonidasdenkmal in den Thermopylen," For- schungen und Fortschritte, xi, 1935. Not connected with his favorite subject, Thessaly, are a short monograph on poetry in Plato and two articles on Homer: Die Stellung der Poesie in der Platonischen Philosophie, Miinchen, 1901; "Der geometrische Stil in der Ilias," Philologische Wochenschrift, lxxviii, 1993; "Die Vorbereitung und Bedeutung der Patroklie in der Ilias," Bldtter fir das Bayer- ische Gymnasial-Schulwesen, liii, 1918. Allen Brown West, Professor of Ancient History in the University of Cincinnati, was born on June 19, 1886, and was killed in an automobile accident on September 18, 1936. In 1918 West published in the Bulletin of the University of Wisconsin, History Series, a monograph on The History of the Chalcidic League, which remains the best state- ment and interpretation of the evidence concerned 522</page><page sequence="2">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS 523 with this vexing subject. Problems of Macedonian history further claimed his attention in "Forma- tion of the Chalcidic League," C.P. ix, 1914; "Notes on the Multiplication of Cities in Ancient Geography," C.P. xviii, 19293;" Coinage of Philip II of Macedon," Num. Chron. iii, 19293; Fifth and Fourth Century Gold Coins from the Thracian Coast, Numismatic Notes and Monographs, No. 40 (19299). From the history of Macedonia West's chief interest gradually shifted to that of Athens. In C.P. x, 1915, appeared his article, "Chronology of the Years 4329-1 "; this was followed by "Notes on Certain Athenian Generals of the year 49.4-3," A.J.P. xlv, 19294; "Pericles' Political Heirs," C.P. xix, 1924; "Thucydidean Chronology An- terior to the Peloponnesian War," C.P. xx, 19295; "Notes on Payments Made by the Treasurers of Athena in 416-15 B.C.," A.J.A. xxix, 199.5. In 1925 begins the long series of articles and mono- graphs on the Athenian Tribute Lists, written often in collaboration with B. D. Meritt. This work is listed in the bibliography in the preface of S.E.G. V, 1931. Since the publication of that bibliography have appeared "Cleon's Assessment and the Athenian Budget," T.A.P.A. lxi, 1930; "Two Assessments of the Athenian Empire," Metropolitan Museum Studies, iii, 1931; "A Frag- ment of a Parthenon Treasure Record," Mdlanges Glotz (1932); "The Two Callias Decrees," A.J.A. xxxviii, 1934; The Athenian Assessment of 425 B.C. (with B. D. Meritt), Ann Arbor, 1934. Not directly concerned with the Tribute Lists, but dealing with problems in Athenian history of the first part of the Peloponnesian War are "Corre- spondences between the Delian and Athenian Calendars in the Years 443-439. B.C.," A.J.A. xxxviii, 1934, and "Prosopographical Notes on the Treaty between Athens and Haliai," A.J.P. lvi, 1935. In addition to his work on the Tribute Lists, West found time to prepare the publication of the Latin inscriptions found in the Corinth excavations: Corinth, VIII 2, Latin Inscriptions, Harvard University Press, 1931. Connected with his studies for this volume is the article "Lucilian Genealogy," A.J.P. xlix, 19298; and again in the field of Greek history of the Roman Period "Notes on Achaean Prosopography and Chronology," C.P. xxiii, 19298. MESOPOTAMIA IRAQ Babylonian Religion during the Age of Abra- ham.-In The Illustrated London News, Septem- ber 5, 1936, pp. 388-391, Professor HENRY FRANKFORT, Director of the Iraq Expedition of the Oriental Institute of the University of Chi- cago, gives a general survey of the discoveries at Tell Asmar, Khafaje and Ishchali. The well pre- served sanctuary of Ishtar-Kititum discovered at Ishchali is the most complete temple complex yet known from the period 9.100-1900 B.C. It is built of sun-dried brick. The base of the walls was protected from wash-outs by pavements of baked brick. The walls still stand to a considerable height. A neighboring shrine was dedicated to the sun-god Shamash. Some tablets were found with accounts of grain loaned by the god. Evidences of popular religious customs were discovered in a small shrine at Tell Asmar; two large cauldrons decorated with serpents and other animals were found in situ. The serpent was a personification of the generative force of nature; live snakes may actually have been kept in these cauldrons. Cult-statues and scenes of worship are sometimes pictured on terracotta reliefs. Two fine examples were found at Khafaje. On one, a demon, repre- sented with a single eye, is to be identified with Cyclops, an interesting connection with Greek mythology. Tell-Agrab.-In The Illustrated London News, September 19., 1936, pp. 439.-436, Professor FRANKFORT reports briefly on the excavation conducted by the Iraq Expedition at Tell Agrab. There had been no previous excavation on the site. It was possible to locate on the surface the site of a temple and a part of the town wall. The uppermost layer of the temple was cleared, reveal- ing three sanctuaries. In one was an altar and offering tables, and a door leading into two rooms, where a great number of amulets and fragments of stone statues were found. The statues repre- sented worshippers. Among the other small finds were a large quantity of stone mace-heads, sculp- tured stone vases, and two fragments of a cylin- drical vase of green steatite. The motives of the scene on this vase shed new light on the connec- tions between the civilization of Sumeria and the Indus Valley. The Early Temple at Khafaje.-In The Illus- trated London News, September 9.6, 1936, pp. 5294-5296, and one color-plate, additional informa- tion is given about the early temple at Khafaje. The deity worshipped there has not been identi- fied. A good many cult objects were recovered. Interesting are pottery vases in the shape of animals, the ritual use of which is confirmed by</page><page sequence="3">594 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY the scene on a cylinder seal, now in Dresden. The remains at Khafaje are identical with those found in contemporary strata at Tell Agrab and other sites of the Jemdet Nasr age, illustrating the homogeneity of Mesopotamian culture. A statu- ette of a woman found in the Jemdet Nasr level is certainly the earliest representation of a human being yet found in Western Asia. PERSIA Persepolis. - In The Illustrated London News, August 22, 1936, pp. 321-323, there are pictures of the important new sculptures found at Perse- polis. They consist of two sets of wall reliefs, each more than twenty feet long, on the terrace. They adorned two porticoes of the courtyard. Both represent audience scenes; each has nine figures. Darius is seated on his throne, and behind him stands Xerxes. These two figures are over life size. A fragment of a Greek statue, a seated woman, was also found. The style seems close to that of the Parthenon pediments. It may have been imported by Xerxes from Athens. GREECE GENERAL AND MISCELLANEOUS Greek Religion. - The existence or non-exist- ence of animal worship at the base of Greek religion is the object of an exhaustive study by CONSTANTINE GHEROGHIANNES, Arch. Eph., 1934-35, pp. 18-37. An examination of myths, religious customs, and Minoan and Mycenaean artistic creations leads the author to conclude that the transition from aniconic to anthropo- morphic representation and worship of the Gods was made without the intervention of a zoo- morphic or theriomorphic conception and stage; that a worship of animals did not exist in Greece; that zoomorphism and anthropomorphism were two distinct and separate conceptions. The former, originating in magic, served for the representation of daemons, the servants of the Gods; the latter developed from the aniconic stones and baetyls when religion appeared, through emblems, such as thrones, double axes, etc. It will be interesting to learn where in his scheme can be placed the Aurignacian female statuettes, which must certainly represent di- vinities, since the Neolithic statuettes are so accepted. Excavations near the Nike Bastion.- In Arch. Eph., 1934-35, pp. 85-116, Professor A. KERA- MOPOULLOS gives a report of the excavations he conducted in 1998 beyond the Nike bastion. His keen analysis of the few walls still existing in that area and of the results of his excavations enable him to give us a most interesting account of the "Pelargikon," of the early history and limits of the " Asklepieion," of its relations to the "Pelargi- kon" on the one hand and to the "Eleusinion" on the other, and of the various roads and pathways that led to the Acropolis from the South. The latter include the famous "promenade road" running around the cavea of the Odeion of Herodes Atticus, a change made in its course after the construction of that building; a second road running parallel to the first and situated within the walls of the Pelargikon, but joining the first over the cavea of the Odeion; and a third-the oldest-skirting the rock of the Acropolis and forming an early means of communication be- tween it and the lower city. These roads termi- nated on the square above the Odeion and to the south of the Nike bastion. From there a gradual winding ascent led to the Propylaeum of the Acropolis. The various problems connected with the identification of the roads and the various monuments of this section are once more exam- ined and a proper understanding and solution of them is suggested with clearness and force. Pro- fessor Keramopoullos' study will form an impor- tant and essential supplement to the topographical studies of the south slope of the Acropolis. A large topographical map of the area by Mr. Travlos, and two excellent airplane views of the Acropolis help to illustrate the important points advanced by the author. Hissarlik.- In Rev. des Etudes Hom&amp;riques, IV, 1934, pp. 55-101 (Controverses autour de Troie, VII, VIII) CHARLES VELLAY contributes two more chapters to his discussion of the site of Homeric Troy: I. He answers the arguments of Petroni for placing the Greek camp at Besika Bay, based on (a) the location of Aegae, (b) Homer's account of the obliteration of the Greek wall, (c) the orientation of the Trojan army in the battles of the Iliad. II. He finds in the result of Blegen's first four campaigns further evidence against the identification of Hissarlik with Homer's Troy. In the failure to trace the missing north wall and to find a necropolis commensurate with the importance of Homer's Ilios, he sees corroboration of his view that Hissarlik is the site of a small Trojan town, destroyed by the Greeks and used by them for their own polyandrion. Excavations at the Cave of Amnisos in Crete.-</page><page sequence="4">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS 525 Dr. SP. MARINATOS gives a brief report of the results of his work in 1934 at the cave of Amnisos in Crete, in the Praktika, 1934, pp. 128-133. This year it was limited to the clearing and study of the historic sanctuary built on an earlier Minoan building. It proved that this sanctuary was in use from the Protogeometric period to later Roman times. The use of the Minoan walls for the historic structure is accepted as evidence for the belief that the historic cult was but a con- tinuation of the Minoan. The many objects made from Egyptian faience found in the lower filling of the sanctuary seem to indicate that close relations existed with Egypt, which lasted down to the Roman period. Among the objects of stone found in the upper layers, most important is a marble head successfully identified as representing Pluto-Osiris. Mycenaean Cemeteries.- Dr. N. KYPARISSES has continued his explorations of the Mycenaean cemeteries of Achaia and especially those around Patras. In the Praktika, 1934, pp. 114-115, he reports the excavation of a cemetery near the village of Paulokastron, where cist graves made of small river stones are regularly found instead of the well-known rock-hewn Mycenaean chamber tombs. The kterismata were usually placed outside the cist. A Beehive Tomb near Marathon. - In the Praktika, 1934, pp. 29-38, Professor SOTERIADES describes briefly the excavation in 1934 of a bee- hive tomb near the site of Marathon. It contained two cists, in one of which was found a golden cup. The floor of the tholos was found covered with a layer of ashes, averaging 10 cm. in depth, filled with bones of animals. The cemetery, located in 1933 near the site of Marathon, was further explored and it was found to contain both in- humation and cremation burials belonging to a long period lasting from Geometric times to the fourth century B.C. A special section of the ceme- tery was reserved for the burial of children. Further evidence was also obtained proving that the church of St. Demetrios is the site of the Herakleion. Excavations at Megara.-The very fruitful researches of Messrs. JOHN THREPSIADES and JOHN TRAVLOS at Megara are briefly described in the Praktika, 1934, pp. 39-57. The foundations of a large building in use in the fifth or fourth cen- tury B.C. were uncovered near the eastern ex- tremity of the town and opposite the church of St. Theodore. On the Alkathos they cleared the rocky summit revealing very clear traces, carved on the rock, of the plan of an ancient peripteral temple measuring 14.50 x 35.50 min., which they identify as the temple of Athena mentioned by Pausanias (I, 42, 4). Trial trenches dug on the adjacent slope brought to light sherds and figurines belonging to the seventh and later centuries. The slopes of the hill of Nisaia, on top of which the remains of a mediaeval castle are still standing, were also tested and yielded sherds dating from the Early Helladic period to Byzantine times. A few graves were also found in an undisturbed section of the hill. Researches in Macedonia.- The important pioneer researches conducted in Macedonia during the summer of 1934 by Professor A. KERAMO- POULLOS are outlined in the Praktika, 1934, pp. 67-91, and their importance duly pointed out. The regions of Almopia, Florina, and Elimeia by the Haliakmon were investigated and a number of graves and fortified settlements were located. The latter seem to belong to the period of Philip, the father of Alexander, who according to Arrian (VII, 9, 2) settled the Macedonian tribes in fortified villages. The identification of the remains of Florina with the site of ancient Herakleia was established by the discovery of tiles bearing stamps with the name of Philip II, the father of Alexander. The organization and establishment of numerous collections and Museums by Professor Keramopoullos at various points in Macedonia, mentioned in the report, as well as his extensive explorations will prove of great importance to the study of Macedonia. A catalogue of objects now preserved in the Museum of Kozane prepared by Mr. Macaronas completes Professor Keramo- poullos' report. Further Excavations on the Site of Ancient Herakleia.- A brief report of Mr. G. BAKALAKIS' work at Florina is published in the Praktika, 1934, pp. 91-114. The fourth campaign conducted by Professor Keramopoullos made possible the estab- lishing of the plan of the ancient city. The clearing of a number of houses proved that their rooms were placed around a rectangular open court. Among the architectural remains recovered are six fragments of tile bearing the name of Philip stamped on their back. This Philip is identified with the father of Alexander, who thus appears to be the builder of the site of Florina. This strength- ens the identification of the site as the ancient Herakleia advanced during the previous cam- paigns. A number of rock-hewn graves were</page><page sequence="5">526 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY located on the east slope of the hill of Florina, one of which was cleared. Sicyon.- The interesting investigations con- ducted at Sicyon by Professor A. K. ORLANDOS are outlined in the Praktika, 1934, pp. 116-122. Professor Orlandos states that the objective of his work for 1934 was to clear the area to the south- east of the Theatre where previous excavations revealed a propylon. His work resulted in the clearing of a large structure which he believes to be the Gymnasium of Sicyon. On the north side of a rectangular court he discovered a series of rooms faced by a portico of the Ionic order, while on the west side he uncovered a second fountain house, placed on the other side of a stairway uncovered in 1933. In that year also, beyond the stairway, a second fountain house was cleared. The cistern of the fountain was found covered with a cylin- drical vault, another example of vault construc- tion in Hellenistic times. This Gymnasium the excavator believes to be the one mentioned by Pausanias. If this identification proves correct, the structure is of great importance since it will make possible the identification of the other buildings mentioned by Pausanias. Fiftieth Anniversary of the British School in Athens.-In The Illustrated London News, Octo- ber 17, 1936, pp. 689-692, Mr. A. J. B. WACE summarizes briefly the most notable achievements in archaeological research, conducted under the auspices of the British School in Athens, which this year celebrates its fiftieth anniversary. An exhibition of some of the discoveries made in Greece and Crete is being held at the Royal Academy in London. Heron's Screw-Cutter.- A machine for cutting an inner screw-thread in wood has been con- structed by A. G. DRACHMANN from the specifica- tions given in Heron's Mechanics, and is found to work successfully. It is described in J.H.S. lvi, 1936, pp. 792-77. The Semantics of Greek Names for Plants.- R. M. DAWKINS, in studying the use of modern Greek words as a guide for identifying the plants mentioned by ancient writers, comes to the conclusion that, with the exception of such well- known plants as the vine, ai/7reXos, baytree, &amp;Owty, plane tree, irXaTavos, and some others, this source of information should be used with great care, owing to the popular habit, in the absence of any scientific classification, of applying the same name to various plants related only by some external characteristic, such as shiny leaves, thorniness, shrubby growth, or even the purpose for which they are used. So in England, "butter- cup" may mean almost any bright yellow, cup- shaped, spring flower. Such variations are largely local, and they are found from Pontus on the east to Magna Graecia on the west. (J.H.S. lvi, 1936, pp. 1-11.) ARCHITECTURE The Place of the Continuous Frieze on the Entablature of Greek Temples.-In B.C.H. lix, 1935, pp. 1-6, R. DEMANGEL studies this problem, with the use of plans. There are five Doric temples in which the continuous frieze is employed: Assos, the Parthenon, the Theseum, and the temples at Sunium and Bassae. In each it is in a different place. To these the temple of Nemesis at Rham- nous is added, as probably a continuous frieze in the vestibule was part of the original plan. On the other hand, in the Ionic order, the place of the continuous frieze is always the same, regardless of the dimensions of the building. In Asia Minor, however, in some cases, this continuous frieze takes the place of the architrave-it will be noted that this is the case at Assos, where this frieze is surmounted by the regular Doric triglyphs and metopes. The scheme of continuous decoration is found in almost every part of the Ionic order, from plinth to cornice. The Heraeum of Samos.-In Ath. Mitt. lviii, 1933, pp. 146-173, ERNST BUSCHOR and HANS SCHLEIF discuss the altar of the Heraeum of Samos in its pre-Rhoecus phases and its relation to the earlier Hera temples there. They find tangible remains of seven successive altars, each larger than its predecessor by the thickness of its new walls, except that the seventh differs from the sixth only in height. Altar I goes back to Mycenaean or sub-Mycenaean times; Altar II, to judge by the fragments of votive pottery found under its eastern part, to the early geometric period of the middle ninth century; III, to the first half of the eighth century; IV and V to the latter half of the same century. The filling in about the fifth altar contains nothing which is post- geometric or orientalizing, so that it may fairly be placed at the end of this, the eighth century. Altar VI, evidently contemporary with the second Hekatompedos, is to be dated early in the seventh century, and Altar VII, because of the nature of the filling under the road at its north border, comes down into the later part of the seventh century. The first Hecatompedos seems to have</page><page sequence="6">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS 527 had no peripteros until the time of Altar III, when its east part had seven columns (the middle one being in the axis of the middle supports of the cella) and the west front, where the cella was closed, only six. The cella itself measured one hundred feet. The temple was built shortly after Altar II but earlier than Altar III, for its architect was unfamiliar with the squared-block structure of this third altar. We may place its building at the turn of the ninth and eighth centuries, and the addition of the Peripteros at a date not long after this. Under the eastern part of the first Hekatom- pedos was found a drum 61.5 cm. high, with a diameter of 96 cm., and having a square hole in the top 31.6 cm. deep and 57 cm. in breadth. This may well have been the basis of the old cult statue of Hera. The last part of the article dis- cusses various roads leading apparently to streams which have changed with the altered lay of the land and were evidently connected with a ritual- istic bathing of the cult-statue. Remains of an artificial conduit for freshly running water were found. The sacred willow, the Xy0os of Pausanias (vii, 4, 4) seems to have been N.E. of the temple and N.W. of the altar. The latter seems to have been oriented with this (it faces 300 south of east) and not with the temple, furnishing evidence for the fact that this rather than a wooden statue of Hera was the original object of worship. Ibid., pp. 174-9210, HANS SCHLEIF describes the extant remains of the great poros altar of Hera in Samos built by Rhoecus in the sixth century B.C., and later rebuilt in marble on virtually the same lines in Roman times, perhaps just subsequent to the wars with the pirates. Of this poros altar which was seven times as large as its immediate pred- ecessor, almost nothing remains but its sub- structure. The old orientation, 300 south of east, was now made to conform to the nearly due east- west axis of the new Rhoecus temple, which was twelve times as large as the second Hekatompedos which it replaced. East of this temple, which was 100 ells long and 50 wide, was laid out a square 70 ells by 70 ells (36.57 m. square), and on the eastern and smaller part of this, measuring 16.58 m. by 36.57 m., the great altar was erected. The foundation consists of four thick substructural walls which enclose a parallelogram of 5.40 m. by 928.30 m., and measure about 5.30 m. in thick- ness, except that the west wall is more than half again as thick, and is, furthermore, set in between the ends of the north and south walls with which it is not structurally connected. This latter wall, which covered the remains of the earlier altars, supported a broad stairway of fifteen steps which led up to the altar itself. As Buschor has noted in his article on the poros friezes, the later marble restoration seems in these friezes and other architectural decorations to have followed closely the poros altar. According to these marble re- mains the north and south walls of the super- structure were carried toward the West at an even height so as to flank the stairway at right and left, and then all three walls were carried higher in a sort of upper storey above the level of the altar, forming a parapet that also surmounted the flanking walls of the stairway. This upper parapet was separated, on the outside of the altar as well as on the inside of the walls that flanked the steps, from the lower part of the altar by a beautiful egg-and-dart and anthemion moulding, and the parapet was crowned by a similar cornice, below which ran the low frieze of couchant animals, described by Buschor in another article. Ibid., pp. 211-244, HANS SCHLEIF gives an account of the buildings which at various epochs existed in the region between the temple and the great altar at Samos. This "foreground," which had originally taken up the western part of the square on which the altar was built and which lay immediately in front of the Rhoecus temple, was increased threefold when, after the burning of this temple, the new structure was removed forty metres further west. The following buildings are to be noted: A. A monopteral structure, without a cella, with its axis lying north and south, and situated just east of this new and never finished temple. It had 14 columns, 3 on the short sides and 5 on the long. A basis-like foundation was found on the northern half, but without any exact relation to either axis. The fact that this coincides in location with the basis of the cult-statue of the second Hekatompedos indicates that this balda- quinlike periptero-monopteros was built to protect the statue which, when the temple was moved, was left in the open air. B. The failure to complete the huge temple, the cella of which had long been used simply as a storehouse for votive offerings, led in Augustan times to the construction of the so-called Roman peripteros, as a more worthy home for the cult- statue. This was a double temple in antis with a colonnade of 17 columns, the long sides having 6 columns, the west end 5 and the front 4, of which two were the east columns of the long sides and two were in line with the antae. This left a double</page><page sequence="7">528 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY intercolumnar space in the middle before a wide doorway into the celia. Three or four possible arrangements of the roof are discussed, two of which have the quadrangle before the cella wall, the antae and these two columns unroofed. C. North of the Roman peripteros was a small temple in antis without a colonnade, the Naiskos, which protected the sacred willow. D. In the second or third century A.D. a small Corinthian temple was built just northwest of the Roman peripteros with an eastern porch of six columns (4 in front). Of this building the numer- ous remains permit practically a complete re- construction. E. At about this time also two further build- ings were constructed in the space west of the enlarged Roman peripteros: one, a large hall-like room which extended from this building to the second step of the monopteros (A) and used its four northern columns in its own west wall; and two, a Roman bath (the smallest one known), which seems later to have been turned into a steam bath. This lay north of the building men- tioned immediately above. F. Finally a Byzantine church was built which, with its surrounding buildings (including a guest house), most ingeniously made use of the walls, columns, etc., of nearly all these buildings, above described. SCULPTURE The Niobids.- Dr. SP. MARINATOS, Arch. Eph., 1934-35, pp. 1-17, describes and discusses two statuettes of the Niobid cycle, discovered acci- dentally in February, 1929, on the south side of the island of Crete, at a place identified as the site of ancient Inatos. The statuettes, made of Pentelic marble, represent Artemis holding her bow, and Niobe with her young daughter dying in her arms. They are successfully proved to be of Attic workmanship, and the work of an inferior carver of sarcophagi of the late second century A.D. They exhibit marked differences in composi- tion, execution, and details. Artemis possesses almost clumsy proportions and is a very unpleas- ing type, while the Niobe group, in spite of its technical limitations, makes a pleasant and even strong impression when viewed from a distance. This difference leads Marinatos to conclude that in the rendering of Niobe and her daughter the cutter followed and used an existing prototype, while for Artemis he used his own poor creative ability because no prototype in the round existed which he could follow. This seems to prove that the gods were not represented in the original Niobid composition. A comparison of Niobe with the Florentine type shows a marked difference in the details of rendering drapery and especially in the facial expression prompted by different psychic emotions. These differences could not be attributed to the carver of the statuette, whose lack of creative ability is proved by his Artemis. They must be attributed to the existence of a prototype differing from the Florentine work, belonging to another edition of the Niobid compo- sition, to which also belongs the Chiaramonti Niobid, a prototype exhibiting a more plastic rendering of drapery, less theatrical motions, and a dignified facial expression. The statuettes are placed in the Antonine period. Sculptures from Philippi. - In B.C.H. lix, 1935, pp. 175-192, E. LAPALUS continues his study of this material, begun in ibid., Ivii, 1933, pp. 438-466. The present article is divided into two parts, the first of which deals with the acroteria of the two Corinthian temples, four in number. First of these is a life-size statue of Athena; the head and raised right arm are missing, and the upper torso and lower legs are badly weathered. The figure wears the peplos and aegis. It was meant to be seen from the front, the back being very much more roughly rendered. Fragments of a round shield of marble were found with the statue. It is a commonplace Roman replica of a well-known type, the Athena at rest; the lost right hand held a lance, and the left hand rested on the shield at the side. It is believed that this statue was one of the acroteria of the northwest temple of the Forum, and therefore dates in the period of Marcus Aurelius. Next is a torso of Victory; the head, arms (which were raised) and legs are lost; the torso is badly corroded by weather; the drapery consists of a sleeveless chiton caught up below the girdle on the right side, leav- ing it bare. The pose can be restored; she leaned slightly forward, arms raised as if in movement, not unlike the Nike of Paeonius in some respects. It is believed that she is one of the side acroteria of the northwest temple, and therefore is of the same period as the Athena. Third in order is the lower part of a statue of Victory, put together from a number of fragments, including the larger part of the socle, most of the left leg, and part of the right, which are concealed by draperies. The whole is much weathered. It is without doubt an unsuccessful imitation of an original of the fourth</page><page sequence="8">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS 529 century B.C., and was also a side acroterion of the northwest temple. Last comes another lower part of a statue of Victory. The whole upper part of the body is missing. The figure is represented as in motion, clad in long flowing draperies, bound with a girdle under the breasts. The draperies are very disordered. A fragment of a wing was found with this statue, and belongs to it. This is un- doubtedly the south acroterion of the eastern temple in the Forum, the only one from this temple preserved, and probably also belongs to the period of Marcus Aurelius. The second part of the article discusses miscel- laneous pieces of sculpture found at different parts of the excavations. (1) Torso of a boy, preserved from above the navel to the knees, and probably intended as a youthful Eros. (92) Frag- ment of a statuette of a seated boy, much mutil- ated, perhaps intended as a sleeping Eros-a Roman copy of a Hellenistic original. (3) Torso of a young man, apparently part of a statue posed in violent motion, of fairly good workmanship. This is probably a representation of a youthful Herakles. (4) Lower part of standing draped female statue, a Roman adaptation of a Hellen- istic type. (5) Head of Cybele, or "Tyche" of the city, wearing a mural crown, of which the details are carefully given, even the crenelations at the summit being shown. The cult of Cybele is known to have existed at Philippi, and in Roman times Cybele was often figured wearing a mural crown. But the identification as Tyche, or the personifica- tion of the city, is also possible. Poros Friezes from Samos.-In Ath. Mitt. Iviii, 1933, pp. 1-21, ERNST BUSCHOR treats of twenty-six fragments of four poros friezes which were found during the excavations of the Heraeum in Samos. They date from the last decades of the sixth and the early part of the fifth centuries B.C. The varying dimensions of the fragments and the proportions of the figures represented on them lead him to distribute them among (1) the altar, (92) the "South Building," and (3) the Temple. The fragments of the first group seem to indicate a frieze of about 44 cm. in height with figures of crouching lions, a siren and a serpent. This frieze was in Roman times, perhaps as late as the Julian- Claudian period, replaced by a marble one of like dimensions bearing similar figures: lions or pan- thers devouring cattle, two sphinxes, a Triton, etc. Buschor discusses the location of these on the sides of the altar-platform or flanking the steps leading up to the altar itself. He finds them far inferior to their poros originals which he regards as of incalculable value in the study of Samian art in the time of Rhoikos and Theodoros. The chief fragment of the frieze of the "South Building" is the upper part of a male or possibly female figure of more than life size belonging to the frieze of a large building. It bears a mantle showing traces of red color, thrown over the left shoulder and permitting a linen chiton with fine folds to appear below it. The hair on the forehead is delicately traced, and lightly waved, and four long crimped locks hang down over the shoulders. Light is cast on the original appearance of this face by an art- ist's sketch on a limestone block found in 1879 in the ruins of the temple and now in the Louvre (Mon. Grecs, 1880, 15). It is to be dated about 530 B.C., shortly before the building of the Treas- ury of the Siphnians. The fragments which Buschor assigns to the temple are in part smaller and in lower relief than those of the "South Building" and in part larger and in much higher relief; the former, representing figures in proces- sion, he attributed to the antae walls of the pronaos and the cella wall connecting these, and the latter, to the outer cella walls. The frag- ments of the higher frieze seem to have portrayed a variety of mythological scenes; Hercules, Phaethon (?), Cerberus (?), Admetus (?), Pro- metheus (?), Hera. Among the objects seen are: a lion's skin, fetters, a couch, feathers, waves, the nostril of a horse and its mane or tail, a hand, and two fragments of drapery. The fact that these figures are of more than life size and in very high relief convinces him that this frieze was placed higher up than that of the pronaos. They made the temple worthy of the reign of Polykrates and a fit precursor to the Parthenon of Pericles. Samian Grave Stelae.-In Ath. Mitt. lviii, 1933, pp. 922-46, ERNST BUSCHOR discusses the Samian grave stelae of the sixth and early fifth centuries B.C. Fifteen of these have been ade- quately treated by Boehlau in his Aus Ionischen und Italischen Nekcropolen (1899) and by Evan- gelides in the Arch. Eph., 1924, but since that time their number has more than doubled and many of the most beautifully voluted forms have been found. The stelae are of varying material, marble being at first rare, then more common in the late sixth century, and finally prevalent in the fifth. In the third quarter of the sixth century the height of the stelae was three or four times as great as their breadth; before this time they were more stubby in their proportions and later more</page><page sequence="9">530 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY slender. They taper slightly from base to top and are for the most part crowned (except where the bottom part is alone preserved) with nine- or eleven-leaved anthemia rising from single or double tiered volutes. These Buschor calls "two- storied" anthemia. Some of the stelae have relief figures of the dead approximating life size, but many carry simple inscriptions such as Hb6Ymos T Z -6 AqoKpiL'Eos.. VASES AND PAINTING Early Pottery from Samos.-In Ath. Mitt. lviii, 1933, pp. 47-145, RICHARD EILMANN dis- cusses very fully the early Greek pottery found in the Heraeum of Samos, dealing particularly with the geometric vases. In most of this ware the colour of the finished product varies from a reddish brown to a bluish or greenish gray, these varia- tions sometimes appearing in the same vase in gradually changing strata. The clay contains considerable mica and also shows light and dark, often reddish brown, spots. It varies too in hard- ness, and the gray ware is not always harder than the red. The bluish clay is usually very pure, fine and firm and seems to have been carefully selected. The glazing shows at times gray-black strips, giving a surface that feels like lead. A similar ware is produced today in the potteries of Mauratsdii, an hour or so north of the sanctuary. The greater part of the article deals with the shapes of the various vessels, cups, bowls, sky- phoi, kraters, kantharoi, plates, shield-shaped vessels, covers etc., and with their decorations. Diagrammatic profiles are given and the figured bands, dogs, birds (geese?), fish, horses, deer, metopes, diamonds, circles, waves, criss-cross patterns, spirals, maeanders etc., are reproduced as originally found or restored. The article is a most important one for students of East Greek pottery, being the first detailed study of the geometric ware. The statement that Herodotus makes about the Samian dialect, Z4Atot U~9 r' EaVT, ov oiot, may well be applied to the unique character of Samian pottery. An Illustration of Bacchylides.-A small Attic bell-krater, an average piece of painting of about 380 B.C., said to have been found at Corinth, is notable for the subject of the picture on one side. This is the arrival of Theseus in Attika, as he waits at the altar of Zeus Meilichios to be puri- fied of blood-guilt. He is seated at ease behind the altar with travelling cloak and hat discarded, while Peirithoos and Phorbas stand at one side facing a somewhat defiant Athena on the other side, with Poseidon or Aegeus behind her. The scene illustrates Bacchylides XVII, 11. 45 ff. (F. N. PRYCE, J.H.S. Ivi, 1936, pp. 77-78.) A Terracotta Sarcophagus in the Fitzwilliam Museum.-A group of five closely related sar- cophagi of the Clazomenian type, one of them now published for the first time, and another group of three from Clazomenae itself, all stand- ing somewhat apart from the main Clazomenian tradition, are described and discussed by R. M. CooK in J.H.S. lvi, 1936, pp. 58-63. They are smaller, narrower, and less tapering than the average. The decoration is simple, consisting of lions, panthers, sphinxes, and human heads apparently influenced by Attic red-figure vase- painting, palmette and scroll designs, wavy lines, and especially the St. Andrew's cross. No purple or white paint is used. The inner edges have a simple S-ornament. They belong between 480 and 460 B.C. The writer believes that these open coffins were not set upright during the prothesis, and certainly not in the tomb, but possibly, if at all, in the salesroom of the dealer, where econ- omy of space would allow a larger number to be kept on hand for emergency needs. INSCRIPTIONS Epigraphical Notes.- GEORGES DAUX con- tributes, in B.C.H. lix, 1935, pp. 92-100, notes on four inscriptions. The first is the oracle of Apollo to the Cyzicenians, dating in the end of the third century B.C., where texts from Delos and Delphi are compared; the second is the text making the island of Anaphi an asylum of refuge, where previous publications are emended and corrected; the third, an inscription from Delphi, previously published by Pomtow, deals with an arbitration at Daulis, and is given a rather detailed com- mentary; and the last deals with one of the archons of Delphi, Menes, who appears on an inscription here republished from the Fouilles de Delphes. An Explanation of I.G. XI, ii, 165.-In B.C.H. lix, 1935, pp. 121-1925, FERNAND ROBERT com- ments on the phrase, EVbOtwrTJpla TOU -ro vXwaTOS in line 31 of this Delian inscription, regarding the Asklepieion. The word euthynteria is usually in- terpreted to mean the foundation of a building, but in this case, when combined with *bXw1a, which obviously refers to wooden construction, it must have a different significance, and means the stone course which governs the horizontal posi- tion and balance of the woodwork. The position</page><page sequence="10">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS 531 of the Asklepicion at Delos has been identified and numerous fragments of its construction dis- covered, so that a restoration of the elevation is possible. It is known that it was a Doric prostyle tetrastyle temple, and that above the walls there was a course 60 cm. thick, and above that there was a stone frieze half the thickness of the course below, without triglyphs, on which the cornice rested. Behind the frieze there must have been wooden construction-three different possible forms are illustrated. The frieze was true Doric in front, but not on the walls, nor did the walls have a true epistyle. Instead, they had this mem- ber, called the EbOvvmrpla ro) vXwLaroS, just be- low the frieze. The Upkeep of "Sacred Houses" on Delos.- In B.C.H. lix, 1935, pp. 78-91, PHILIP A. DAVIS reports the results of discoveries made during a visit to Delos in 1934-35. To the Delian inscrip- tion I.G. XI, ii, 156, now in the French School in Athens, he is able to add I.G. XI, ii, 170 and 173, now in the Museum at Delos, which he discovered fitted together. This join necessitates a re-exami- nation of the inscription, and makes it possible to identify the houses in which improvements were made. The information offered by the inscription concerning building is shown by a detailed table. A commentary of notes on readings concludes the paper. Inscriptions from Delphi. - In B.C.H. lix, 1935, pp. 7-35, R. FLACELIE'RE publishes ten inscrip- tions, previously unpublished, which he had stud- ied at Delphi in October, 1934. All date in the third century B.C. The first is a proxeny decree, in favor of a certain Akidon, whose patronymic and nationality are uncertain. The name of the archon, Philaitolos, though only found on one other inscription, can, however, be dated between 205 and 201. This Akidon, in return for an ex- emption from a tax (XEtpo9,T'xtov) is to repair the roofs of the armory of Pronaia, the lower gym- nasium, the great portico, and other buildings, and workshops, the city to supply the necessary material. This inscription, apart from giving in- formation regarding the granting of proxenies, and tax exemptions in return for services ren- dered, throws light on the identification of the site of the sanctuary of Athena Pronaia, in which the armory was doubtless maintained. Other inscriptions refer to an armory, and it is prob- ably the same one, though there may have been one in the sanctuary of Apollo at that time. It was in the Marmaria, and the "lower gymnasium" must refer to the one already discovered in that region. This would imply an upper gymnasium, the site of which has not been discovered. The "great portico" is identified as that west of the sanctuary of Apollo. The workshops mentioned were in the suburb of Thyiai, so that it is not improbable that the other buildings mentioned were also in that region. The buildings are men- tioned in the order followed by pilgrims entering the city from the East. It would appear from this inscription that at the end of the third century the city undertook certain responsibilities which hitherto had been performed by the Amphictyons, and suggests the troubled state of Delphi at that time. The second inscription, found in July, 1934, is in very fragmentary condition, and only the first seven lines out of a total of twenty-nine can be transcribed. These lines are an Amphictyonic list. It can be dated by the name of the archon Nikodamos, who antedates the second century, and is probably after 225. An archon Nikodamos is dated in 958; this would suggest a Nikodamos II, in the last quarter of the century. In this con- nection two other hitherto unpublished inscrip- tions are here published (nos. 3 and 4) in which this name as archon occurs. From these texts a date of about 220 for Nikodamos II is reached. The remaining inscriptions are of relatively little importance. See also an explanatory note in the Addenda, p. 310. Inscriptions and the Topography of Central Greece.-In B.C.H. lix, 1935, pp. 193-209, Louis ROBERT publishes a number of inscrip- tions dealing with these subjects. This article, the first of at least two on the subject, is divided into five parts. The first is concerned with The- ban festivals. In this connection, the inscription from Delos, C.I.G. 3067, in honor of the flutist Kraton, and now in the Louvre, is re-examined. The restoration of the Herakleia for Thebes, adopted since the days of Boeckh, is considered false, and festivals of Dionysos substituted. This substitution is proved certain by three texts where festivals of Dionysos are mentioned-I.G. IV, 682, Fouilles de Delphes, III, 1, 351, and S.G.D.I. 2687. The name of these festivals was Agrionia, in honor of Dionysos Kadmeios. In an Appendix to this part a text from Kos, of analo- gous nature, unintelligible to Maiuri, by whom it was published in 1995, is explained. The second part takes up the inscription pub- lished by Plassart in B.C.H. xlv, 19c1, pp. 1-85,</page><page sequence="11">532 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY giving the list of the theorodochoi of Delphi. The name of the town of Parochthiae is restored in this inscription. This town was situated in the eastern part of Central Greece, but its exact loca- tion is unknown. Further confirmation for this reading is given in the Addenda, p. 310. The third part is devoted to the publication of four stones studied during a visit to Daulis in July, 1932. The first of these, which was first published by L. Ross in 1834, was at that time built into the walls of a church of St. Theodore on the Acropolis. This stone has long been con- sidered lost; but the church has been torn down, and the stone has been found, and is here pub- lished in full with a commentary. It belongs in the middle of the second century B.C. The second of these inscriptions was also published by Ross, but owing to being built into the church he could only read the beginning of the last five lines. Now the ends of these lines can be read, the middle being lost. This fragmentary stone is published with a commentary. Found in two fragments at different times, they have been united, and are now in the Museum of Chaeronea. Two other funerary inscriptions, one of the third century B.c., and one of the Christian era, were also found. The fourth and fifth parts of the article pub- lish one inscription each, from Thebes, of Phthio- tis and Thespiae. The former was published by Giannopoulos in Arch. Eph., 1932, p. 19, no. 5, and certain emendations are proposed; the latter, published by Lolling in Ath. Mitt. iii, 1878, p. 140 and elsewhere, is also much emended, based on a re-reading of the stone in the Thebes Museum. Inscriptions from Philippi.-P. LEMERLE, in B.C.H. lix, 1935, pp. 126-164, continues the study of this material begun in ibid., lviii, 1934, pp. 448-483. In this article the Greek inscriptions found in the excavation of the Christian basilica at Philippi are published. There are twenty- five, numbered 38-62 inclusive. One of these inscriptions, no. 38, has been previously published - a dedication to a certain Baebius Valerius Firmus, dating in the third century A.D. The other inscriptions are all new; nos. 39, 40 and 41 are similar dedications. In no. 39, mention is made of a Museum, which the writer identifies with that of Alexandria; this, too, is of the third century A.D. Nos. 40 and 41 deal with a father and son, and were set up as a memorial by the religious college of Serapis. They also belong in the same period. All the rest of the inscriptions are funerary; nos. 42-51 are on slabs, and have suf- fered much mutilation. No. 492 is a metrical text in hexameters, and the writer gives a detailed commentary. This stone is also decorated with crude reliefs, and is dated in the second century A.D. The rest of these inscriptions have no great importance. Nos. 52-56 are stelae; all of them have the top decorated, either with a gable, or with reliefs. No definite date for these is given. Finally, nos. 57-62 are Christian inscriptions; of these the first two date early, the others belong at the time of the decline and impoverishment of the place; all, however, have been re-used to build the basilica. A prosopographical index concludes the article. Thessalian Studies.- Y. BEQUIGNON continues his series of articles on this subject in B.C.H. lix, 1935, pp. 36-77. This is the seventh of his articles on Thessaly, and is concerned with in- scriptions from this region. Four inscriptions are here published, with transliteration, commen- tary, translation, and discussion. First of these was seen by him in the village of Boukhlar, 20 km. from Larissa. It is a square stone, inscribed on all four sides -one side had already been published in 1887, at a time when the stone was built into a wall, and the other sides could not be seen. This inscription is a decree, relating to loans of money agreed to by the citizens of Cran- non. Each side is separately published, with a commentary on the text, a translation, and a discussion. The city was in debt, and to free itself, calls on the citizens to undertake, by a voluntary subscription, to satisfy the creditors. Similar documents are not uncommon. Some of the names on this stone are of personages already known to us, and from these a date not earlier than 168 B.C. is arrived at for face 2. The sides are also inscribed, and transliteration given; these are later, and are texts of enfranchisement. The other three inscriptions in the article are all in the Museum at Larissa. The first of these is a long document, and consists of honorific de- crees from certain residents of Alexandria in the Troad. It was undoubtedly found at Larissa. The transliteration is followed by a long com- mentary and discussion. A date anterior to 168 is given. The next inscription of unknown prov- enance is also of great length and consists of decrees in honor of foreign judges. Transliteration and commentary are given, and a date not earlier than 109/8 is assigned; it certainly deals with the city of Larissa. The last inscription, probably</page><page sequence="12">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS 533 from Larissa, is a fragment of a decree in honor of judges of Karystos in Euboea. A date of 50-48 B.c. is given. Finally, in an Appendix, a text recently published by Arvanitopoulos in the re- view HoX~ w,, and now in the Museum at Volo, is republished, with commentary and corrections of previous readings. This is a decree of the deme of Iolkos, and is dated in the time of Antigonos Gonatas. Craton, Eumenes II, and Attalus II.-In B.C.H. lix, 1985, pp. 9210-280, GEORGES DAUX calls attention once more to the decree of the Dionysiac technites of lonia in honor of Craton, first published by Boeckh in C.I.G. 3067, and now in the Louvre. This inscription is republished, with many new readings and a detailed commen- tary. The text thus established brings up numerous questions. As far as Craton is concerned, a list of inscriptions where he is mentioned is given. In the earliest, an inscription from lasos, he is engaged as a flute-player among many others. A little later he appears to have been a priest (in the inscription of the synagogists, C.I.G. 3068 B). The inscription here under consideration is the next in chronological sequence, where he is not merely a priest, but also an agonothete. Later, in another inscription (C.I.G. 3068 A) he is mentioned as "agonothete and priest of King Eumenes" - subsequently on two other stones he is referred to as the founder of a group of "Attalists." Probably still later is to be dated an inscription (C.I.G. 3068 C) in his honor by the technites of the Isthmus of Corinth and of Nemea, where he is called a Pergamenian; before this, he was from Chalcedon. And finally, on his death, a decree is voted by the Attalists in his honor, praising his generosity, since he left them an important legacy. The problem raised is to identify the Eumenes and Attalus mentioned in these inscriptions, and particularly in the one in the Louvre, where the "kings and queens and brothers of King Eumenes" are specifically mentioned. Boeckh identifies the Eumenes as Eumenes II, and the Attalos as Attalos Phila- delphos. The "queens" are certainly Apollonis, widow of Attalus I and Stratonice, wife of Eumenes. But Boeckh must be rejected for the kings, who are the deceased Attalus I, and his successor Eumenes II. Although Attalus II was crowned king towards the end of the reign of Eumenes, he was not king in 166, the date of this inscription. Comparison is made with certain decrees from Delphi, which place the death of Eumenes about 159. Attalus II was already called "king" in 160 in Delphian and Athenian inscrip- tions of that year; the date of the Athenian in- scription, long in doubt, of the archon Tychan- dros, has been established by Dinsmoor. There is also a decree of Miletos, found at Didyma, in which Attalus is called "king" during the life- time of Eumenes; the date of this inscription has been assigned from before 166 up to 160/59, by different scholars, but Daux would place it at the latter date. The conclusion is that Boeckh's theories as to the kings should be rejected, and that Attalus II was given the title of king during the last months of his brother's reign. The Athenian Archon, Polyeuktos.-In R. Et. Anc. xxxviii, 1986, pp. 5-28, Louis ROBERT dis- cusses the date of the Athenian archon Polyeuktos in the light of an inscription, C.I.G. IX, 12, p. 87, Epimetrum (19392), Fouilles de Delphes, III, 1, 483, in which the people of Smyrna accept the invitation to participate in the establishment or renewal of the festival of the Soteria at Delphi by the Aetolians, in commemoration of the defeat of the Gauls in 978 B.C. One of the five inscrip- tions in which various places accept this invita- tion is an Athenian decree (Sylloge3, 408) dating from the archonship of Polyeuktos. Robert, with Segre, each independently of the other, recognized from the mention of &amp;]ovXov (1, 929) and -LKL&amp; (1, 24), that the former inscription was a similar acceptance from Smyrna, to which city avMaXa was granted under Seleukos II in recognition of its having established a cult in honor of Aphro- dite Stratonikis, Stratonike being the grand- mother of Seleukos II. He is convinced that all these inscriptions are nearly contemporary and he therefore places the archonship of Polyeuktos at any rate later than 9246, the date of the acces- sion to power of Seleukos II. Other scholars had put it, on what Robert calls ingenious combina- tions, at various dates: Dinsmoor, The Archons of Athens in the Hellenistic Age, in 9249/8; Beloch, in 9.61/0; Kirchner (Gnomon, 1939, pp. 4592-456) in 9.56/5; Ferguson, Athenian Tribal Cycles, pro- poses two dates as possible; in one list Polyeuktos is dated 9255/4, and in the other 9248/2. Robert thinks that Segre's dating of the Smyrna inscrip- tion in the reign of Antiochus II, which presup- poses a reference to an asylia which was actually granted 10 years later, is extremely unlikely and regards his emendations, in an inscription where only 10 letters exist in lines which have about 96 letters, as more than doubtful. He states that</page><page sequence="13">584 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY Ferguson has misquoted him as agreeing with Segre in the latter's contention that in a casual acceptance of the Aetolians' invitation a question of such importance as the asylia of Smyrna could have been requested. A careful reading of the inscription in May 1981 (his article had appeared in B.C.H., 1980, pp. 3926-338892) which showed that the A of the name 'A[v-rloxos (1, 921) had been mis- read, and that this was really a 2 for 2[XCevKos has confirmed Robert in his previous supposition and has led to the writing of this second article. The author also insists that the epithet, OE6e, can only be used after a king's death. Ferguson's earlier date seems to him to indicate too long a lapse between the issuing of the invitation and its acceptance, and the parallels for such a delay advanced by Ferguson seem to him to have been quite different from this case. Inscription of Philip V.-In Arch. Eph., 1984-85, pp. 117-127, Mr. CH. I. MAKARONAS publishes an inscription accidentally discovered in 1982 at a short distance from Kozane in West- ern Macedonia, and now in the Museum at Sa- loniki. It is inscribed on a stele of local marble measuring 88 by 42 cm. Apparently the stone was used in modern times as a fountain piece and it bears in its centre a large hole, used for the inser- tion of the spout. Eighteen lines and traces of a nineteenth are preserved. They are proved to form an epistle written by Philip V of Macedonia in 181 B.C. to his representative Archippos, ap- proving the request of the tetrarch Nikanor and his military associates for an area in which to worship. The peculiarities of the inscription are pointed out and a list of similar epistles thus far known is given. The text and the type of the in- scription lead Makaronas to the study of, and to very interesting and important conclusions rela- tive to, the existence of a "royal year" in Mace- donia. The difference also existing between epistles and "diagrammata "is very accurately pointed out. Inscription from Rhamnus.- Mr. PH. D. STRAV- ROPOULLOS publishes in Arch. Eph., 1984-835, pp. 128-182, an inscription from Rhamnus, deal- ing with the property of the later temple of Nemesis. Inscribed on an oblong slab of Pentelic marble, 1.055 x 0.81 m., it contains thirty-eight lines and four "anagraphas," setting the property of the temple at four distinct periods. Apparently the letters were cut by two technicians. The names of a number of officials are included, but these are proved to be local archons and consequently do not help the author in establishing the date of the inscription. This is accomplished, however, on the evidence of the letter forms, and the years 445-4492 or a little later are taken to be the ones during which the various parts of the inscription were cut. The lack of any reference to Rhamnus in Athenian inscriptions leads the author to the conclusion that the inhabitants of Rhamnus refused to store their treasure on the Acropolis and kept it in their own town and care. The inscription is important because very few such documents from small towns and demes are known in contrast to the great numbers of Athen- ian examples. Miscellaneous Inscriptions.- Mr. N. J. GHIAN- NOPOULLOS publishes in Arch. Eph., 1934-35, pp. 140-150, five inscriptions found accidentally at Ghounitsa, Pharsala, Trikke, Phthiotic Thebes, and Demetrias. Of these the first is an archaic "thesmos," similar to the Locrian published by Papadakis, ibid., 1924, and it seems that origi- nally it was set up in the ancient town of Atraga. The second belongs to the Fourth century and records the history of the erection of a stoa for the exercise of the youth by Leonidas of Proteus. It provides for the establishment of an athletic festival to be held annually, in the month of Dipsios, to be known as the Leonideia. This is the first mention of this festival. The third inscription is an epistle of the Roman general Publius Sex- tilius, and the last two are grave inscriptions of no importance. In the Chronicle of the Ephemeris, pp. 1-16, Professor KERAMOPOULLOS begins the publication of the inscriptions he found and stored in the Museum at Thebes. One hundred and eighty-nine such inscriptions from Thebes and one from Attica are catalogued with a few very pertinent remarks. Scholars will be grateful to Professor Keramopoul- los for his willingness to present this vast material in a preliminary form, thus making it available for further study. CIG 3938, 3952, and 3953f.-These three in- scriptions from southwest Asia Minor (Laodicea ad Lycum, Attouda, and Heraclea Salbace) were incomprehensible when first published, but have now been restored with the help of more recently discovered texts and are published, with com- ments, by W. H. BUCKLER. The otherwise un- known word 6rwXovpy6b in the first one, meaning "maker of singlets" or one-piece garments, is appropriate to the city famous for the manufac- ture of cloth and clothing.

KAMBANIS, in ibid., lix, 1935, pp. 101-120, discusses once more the problems raised by the hoards of Athenian tetra- drachms found at Halmvros and Zarova. The former hoard was found in 1930; since his previous article, 102 more tetradrachms from this hoard have been deposited in the Numismatic Museum at Athens; of these thirty-four are forgeries, but very clever ones, made by the previous owner when desirous to sell the originals of which they are copies. A table of these coins is given, and then a table giving the entire hoard of 828 coins. The newly deposited coins bear out the conclu- sions reached in the former article. Next the hoard from Zarova (Langada) is discussed. Since the previous article the writer obtained, through the courtesy of the late Prof. Dr. Kurt Regling of Ber- lin, a list of the coins from this hoard in Istanbul, of which there are 218 pieces. A similar number went to Vienna, and another to Athens, amount- ing to from 675 to 700 pieces. There may have been a fourth lot as well. A table of the specimens from this hoard in Athens and Istanbul is given; and a summary of conclusions, reached after a detailed study of the two hoards, concludes the article. ROMAN Insignia and Dress of the Roman Emperors.- In R6m. Mitt. L, 1935, pp. 1-171, in an elaborate study, A. ALFLDI discusses the significance of the imperial attire to which, in his estimation, too little attention has been paid in the past. Momm- sen had dismissed the subject too briefly by saying that "the imperial rights and insignia are gen- erally speaking those of the republican magis- tracies." Alfdldi admits that the old emblems of office were retained but that the emperors grad- ually and inconspicuously transformed them into significant symbols of monarchy, carefully reserving them for the highest office only, to serve as expressions both of imperial dignity and authority. Whereas Mommsen evaluated cor- rectly the political significance of the republican relicts in the monarchical scene, he neglected a large part of the constitutional side of the ques- tion. According to Mommsen, a sceptre was but a perquisite for a triumph, the crown of spikes not in use during the first few centuries, jewels on the attire and equipment of the emperors as late as Diocletian, the diadem an innovation of Con- stantine. Alf ldi finds fault not so much with what Mommsen states as with what he fails to state, namely, that there were attributes and symbols of imperial power which grew out of a religious and emotional aspect of the principate. Most of these insignia were not introduced through legal channels but through channels of flattery and adulation under the pretext of artistic and poetic license. Of the two main divisions, the first takes up the republican juridical aspect of the principate as reflected in the imperial attire and attributes. What was originally the dress or emblem of the citizen or the soldier was gradually adapted to special imperial use. Augustus wore the civil dress, the home-spun toga, without purple. The early emperors wore purple only in consular or priestly functions. Since Claudius the corona civica was reserved exclusively for imperial use. The subsellium in the senate hall was replaced by the throne of the autocratic rulers. The emperor was the optimus senator. The praetexta, the dress of the old curule magistrates, especially after Tiberius, became a symbol of imperial position and remained, even in the third century, the peace dress of the emperors, side by side with the tri- umphal garb and the general's garb. After 19 n.c. the fasces were conferred on the emperor for life. The laurel wreath, in republican times an honor only for the vir triumphalis, was the head- dress of the emperor after Caesar. If there were co-regents, only those bearing the title imperator could assume this headdress; first of these was Titus. The sella curulis of the emperor reflected his legal position. Caesar was entitled to sit in it between the consuls in the curia. Later the emperor could sit in it anywhere. Under Caligula the seat was raised on a podium. By 200 A.D. it had developed into an ornate throne. Of the imperial emblems only one was taken over from the functions of the priest, namely the augur's staff. The Triumphal garb, reserved for very special solemn functions in republican times, became the imperial dress for all festive occasions, worn even in the senate. Parallel with it is the bro- caded dress of the empresses, whereas the vassal princes wore silver dresses. In Roman tradition the triumphal garb was not only the ornatus optirni maximi Iovis but also the attire of the old kings, specimens of which were found among</page><page sequence="15">536 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY the treasures in temples. With this tradition Julius Caesar established contact purposefully. A variation of the attire is the vestis alba trium- phalis, a white toga with a golden border. Despite its increasing importance, the trium- phal garb was eventually restricted to the capital and connected with traditional functions. The appearance of gems on the dress surely antedates Diocletian; but it is probable that he regulated the usage. The laurel wreath and other accom- panying symbols signify that the wearer is not a mortal but semper triumphator, semper victor. With triumphal dress and gem-studded wreath, Caesar was also granted a gilded seat-not a triumphal chair, as Mommsen thought, but a sella curulis- which his successors again adopted. The imperial box at the games grew out of old privileges for the magistrates. In early times the princeps represented the entire body of citizens; hence the significance of the toga as imperial dress. In subsequent cen- turies, the leadership of the state rested on mili- tary support and accordingly the emperors took over the military attire. The imperial palace was now considered a castrum. The coins testify to the importance of the consensus exercituum. The earlier attempt to keep the general's uniform away from the city ceased with Commodus. The purple war dress became the symbol of the monarchy because only the imperator was entitled to wear it. The ceremony of inducting the new ruler consisted practically of putting on the paludamentum (the corresponding chlamys of the Hellenistic kings). Therefore the purple band as a symbol of the highest authority is older than so far assumed. Perhaps even before the diadem was introduced by Constantine, a military ceremony took place, a precursor of the coronation cere- mony. So far this fact has been overlooked. The ceremony of putting on the torques, accompanied by raising the imperator on the shield on the Cam- pus Martius, was probably older than Julian. The first step toward the mediaeval sacred coronation was the wreath placed on the head of the emperor Constantius II by the hand of God, in effect the Christianized version of the pagan allegory of virtus and victoria. In 450 the Bishop of Constan- tinople actually took part in the coronation cere- mony, but at the palace; only in the sixth century were the sacred and military ceremonies combined. Alfdldi then describes the military peace cos- tume and the military war costume and states among other things that Mommsen was wrong in saying that the sword was the symbol of mon- archy. Actually the sword was part of the gen- eral's uniform and not until the gem-studded parazonium or spatha was introduced did the sword take on imperial significance. In the second part of his treatise the author stresses the fact that until recently the legal aspect of the principate was chiefly studied. It was overlooked that other than legal means were employed when leading statesmen were first elevated above the common citizen. Great im- portance must be attached to the emotional and religious note in the adulation of the emperor, varying all the way from the simple, hymn-like praise of the ruler to his glorification as Ruler of the World after the fashion of the highest deity. The adulatory addresses were carefully motivated, bound by a well-delineated court etiquette which had grown up. The human and divine honors which the emperors received were not kept apart. There was a purposeful blending of the national Roman titles of honor and the divine cosmic attributes of the ruler. Subse- quently a change of emphasis from the rational and political to the abstract and divine aspect is evident on the coins. Finally the legal forms of address were entirely replaced by adulatory sup- plications to the ruler. Accordingly, through such subjective, emotional laudation of the emperor the rational element disappeared also in the political field. Legally the divine conception of the emperor was fixed by a number of religious acts, by the oaths of loyalty to the emperor demanded reg- ularly of the subjects, by the sacred character of auctoritas, by the official interpretation of divi filius, and by the various titles which were granted to the emperors. The divine station of the emperor is evident in the much discussed emperor-cult as it is represented on coins. Furthermore, the emperor surrounded himself with the Hellen- istic symbolism of the World Ruler, the pacator orbis, the restitutor orbis, as Alexander and his suc- cessors had done, whose conception of ruling on earth was similar to that of Zeus in heaven. Under Augustus the Jove-like image of the young ruler was officially not sanctioned but flourished all the more, privately, in art and poetry. The ruler was depicted in art with Jove's eagle, his thunder- bolt and aegis. The symbols of other deities were less used. There were even less restrictions to the use of the divine symbolism for the imperial women.</page><page sequence="16">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS 537 In discussing certain sacred insignia of rulers such as the sceptre and the globe, the author emphasizes that Mommsen wrongly attempted to minimize and explain the divine symbolism at- tached to these objects. Eventually the imperial palace was officially called a temple. The empty throne of monarchs on which had been placed their insignia was wor- shipped after the manner of the sellisternia of the gods. Last of all Alfoldi discusses the Hellenistic origins of the imperial attributes, the significance and early introduction of the crown of spikes (again understated by Mommsen), the nimbus, and the diadem. He says, that contrary to Momm- sen's view, the vestis Graecula formed a regular part of the imperial wardrobe. To the article is added an index of names, sub- jects, and passages quoted and a handsome set of plates. The Porta Aurea of Ravenna. - In R6m. Mitt. L, 1935, pp. 172-224, HEINZ KXHLER attempts to reconstruct the Porta Aurea of Ravenna, and to establish its rightful place in the history of art. Of two parts, the first is purely archaeological, the second, interpretative. This city gate was destroyed entirely in 1582. There are drawings extant, however, and a fresco in Mantua. The gate is described in contemporary and later literature by Zirardini, Rossi, L. Alberti and others. From these accounts we know that it had been cleared from obstructions in the middle of the sixteenth century as part of the plan of the prior Francesco da Vicenza to transfer it to the square before the church of Sta. Maria in Porto. But eventually it was used as building material by Cardinal Guido Ferreri. Six different views, quite independent of one another, have come to the attention of the author. They are reproduced in the text. Additional aids to the reconstruction are architectural fragments in the museum of San Vitale. These were discov- ered in various places in other buildings or exca- vated in 1906. After a description of the fragments Kihler discusses the reconstruction of the facade and its relation to the different extant sketches. The task is beset with difficulties because there does not exist a report of the excavations in 1906. The author interprets the architecture as fashioned after the triumphal arch, representing a later stage in the development of the city gate, the earlier design being primarily for purposes of defense. The date is given on an inscription as 43 A.D. Thus the Porta Aurea becomes an important link between the numerous Augustan buildings and the arch of Titus which was erected in 82 A.D., that is, for a period of which we have scant knowledge. In comparing the Porta Aurea with other struc- tures, it is pointed out that a certain similarity exists with the arch of Trajan in the treatment of the capitals, and also in slightly varied form with that of the arch of the Gavii in Verona. This raises the question as to where the design origi- nated. It is not likely that Roman architects copied from Ravenna, although the arch of Trajan was built a hundred years later. An examination of other architectural schemes shows two such designs in Rome. The one, part of the temple of Apollo and now to be found near the Theatre of Marcellus, has been recently dated as of 32 B.C. The other is an unidentified fragment. The differ- ence in execution plainly indicates that at least no interchange of workmen had taken place between northern Italy and Rome. Possibly, however, the Roman sketches were used in Ravenna or a Roman architect was sent there. The question is still unsolved. Recent Archaeological Researches in Italy and Sicily as reported in Not. Scav. xi, 1935.-Regio III (Lucania and Bruttium). Cosenza.-Near Cosenza, the ancient Consentia Bruttiorum, an extensive Hellenistic necropolis has been investi- gated, as reported by MICHELE SCORNAJENGHI. About seventy graves were excavated. It is dated in the fourth and third centuries. Listed and illus- trated are thirty-nine items found; some others are mentioned in the article. The important con- clusions are that Cosenza was not earlier than the fourth century, and that in the pre-Roman period it was probably a collection of disunited villages. The same writer records the finding of Greco-Roman graves in Cosenza itself. (Not. Scav. xi, 1935, pp. 1892-190.) Matera.-In this neighborhood have been excavated graves con- taining skeletal and ceramic remains, which are described by ELEONORA BRACCO. They show the same juxtaposition of burials of the archaic period with those of the fourth and third centuries already familiar from other investigations in this district. The writer records the finding of a grave with the skeleton, containing bracelets of second century B.C. style. (Ibid., pp. 107-125.) Tricarico. -About twenty kilometers from Tricarico a Roman necropolis has been discovered, which is described by ENRICO MELE. Thus far twenty-</page><page sequence="17">538 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY five graves have been opened. Below them are foundation walls of a house, probably Greek. From these and other mural remains nearby it is deduced that the site was earlier occupied by a Greek town, destroyed by invasion or earthquake. All the graves contained complete skeletons. Also among the finds were three coins of C. Albius Bala (90 B.C.), Gordianus Pius and Con- stantine, terracotta tiles with Greek imprints, and grave furniture of glass, iron, bone, pottery, etc.; this last group is listed by individual graves. Subsequent finds included seven vases intact or slightly damaged, fragments permitting restora- tion of some others, fragments of Arretine pottery proving the persistence of the necropolis to the last century of the Republic, and about a dozen items of bronze, iron, and bone. (Ibid., pp. 190- 201.) Regio VI (Umbria). Assisi. -ENRICO STEFANI reports the excavation of remains of a portico in Assisi, at the junction of the Vicolo Bovi and the Via del Commune Vecchio, which may have be- longed to one of the entrances of the Roman city. (Ibid., pp. 19-924.) P. ROMANELLI records twenty- one sepulchral cippi found at Assisi in 1926. Some are inscribed, one bearing the name Propertia. (Ibid., pp. 25-928.) Gualdo Tadino.-ENRIco STEFANI reports a number of finds in the vicinity of Gualdo Tadino. He describes the remains of a cult building unearthed on top of a hill north of the town and lists the objects of bronze, iron, terracotta and bone found in it. The sanctuary is of early date and the cult endured to Roman times. Found at Malpasso were three graves and below them a fourth of exactly opposite orienta- tion. The three graves contained skeletons and a very few objects. The lower grave contained two warriors' skeletons, each furnished with iron spearhead, bronze strigil, bucchero krater, kylix and small bronze vase. Beside the course of the ancient Via Flaminia were found a small patch of paving, red with white inset; a bit of Roman wall; and part of an inscribed sepulchral monu- ment. Two fine arches belonging to the sub- structure of the Via Flaminia have also been found. On the acropolis of ancient Tadinum has been discovered a grave of curious type, in which the corpse was protected by iron arches con- nected by pieces of wood and supporting a sheath- ing of lead. Also on this site were found a large block of clay and other fragmentary remains be- lieved to indicate the presence of a forge of rather early date. (Ibid., pp. 155-173.) Massa Martana. - P. ROMANELLI describes a female bust, found in 1928 at Massa Martana, which he believes is Faustina. (Ibid., pp. 29 f.) Spiano.- FRANCESCO SAVINI records the finding of a Roman bath, and, more important, a stele with Sabellic inscription. (Ibid., p. 105 f.) Regio VII (Etruria). Giannutri.- BICE VACCA- RINo FORESTO gives a brief history of the is- land of Giannutri and resumes the slight earlier archaeological exploration there. He then de- scribes in detail the excavation since 1928 of the very considerable and interesting remains of a villa, which he calls "villa Domitia" because of the known large holdings of the Domitii Aheno- barbi on the mainland directly opposite the island. There were found a large bronze coin of Domi- tian, brick stamps of the late first and early second centuries, much marble ornament, mosaic floors and architectural fragments. Staircases and the walls of rooms are preserved to a sufficient height to make the plan of the house clearly discernible. (Ibid., pp. 127-154.) Fonte Vivo.- The excavation of an Etruscan necropolis at Fonte Vivo near San Miniato is reported by A. DE AGOSTINO. About thirty urns were found of about the latter half of the third century B.C. They contained the usual Etruscan grave furniture of pottery and bronze utensils. A bronze mirror bears the repre- sentation of two nude ephebes, perhaps the Dios- curi. The importance of the find is topographical; the establishment of an inhabited center here is of value in determining the course of the ancient roads in the area. (Ibid., pp. 31-38.) Regio X (Venetia and Histria).-In four brief articles ADOLFO CALLEGARI reports finds in Este and its vicinity. The first describes minor antiqui- ties of bronze and iron; a cemetery containing eleven graves of the second Atestine period; two ossuaries, one biconical, belonging to the second Prosdocimi period; a grave with several fibulae (one interestingly decorated with three little birds), an iron axe and a bronze knife; seven other graves (representing both burials and cre- mations) with two skeletons and small antiqui- ties; four amphorae; a grave containing three ossuaries; and several casual finds including two mosaics and a bronze handle in the shape of a dog (?) rampant. The second article records a stele found at Baone which represents a child holding a bird. At Vo Euganeo were found amphorae, pipes, tesserae, and coins including: bronze pieces struck by P. Lurius Agrippa and a denarius of the gens Barbatia. The last article</page><page sequence="18">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS 539 describes a white marble head of a young man of late republican or early imperial times, found at Monselice. (Ibid., pp. 3-18.) Regio XII (Etruria).-The excavation of twenty-one Etruscan tombs at Veii and the an- tiquities found are described in detail by ROBERTO VIGHI. The twenty-one comprise six chamber tombs, seven trench graves and eight corridor tombs; there are examples of both inhumation and cremation; and the burials range chrono- logically from the seventh to the third century. Over two hundred articles of pottery, bronze, lead, bone, etc. are listed and described. (Ibid., pp. 39-68.) Rome.--Just to the left of the Via Flaminia not far from the Piazza del Popolo has been found a polychrome mosaic with a youth's head as its central figure. Its discovery is reported by EN- RICo STEFANI, and a plate in full colour is provided by O. FERRETTI. (Ibid., p. 68 f.) Beside the Via Veientana three Etruscan chamber tombs have been discovered, all previously violated. ENRICO STEFANI lists the pottery remains found in and about them, totaling ninety items, about two- thirds being bucchero vases. Nearby were found small remains of a country villa. (Ibid., pp. 174- 181.) PIETRO ROMANELLI describes a fragmentary vase of Greek marble, 1.30 m. in diameter, found in 1929 near the Lungotevere. It is decorated in relief with figures of sea monsters, nereids, cen- taurs, swans, cupids, etc. The style is reminiscent of Pergamene and Rhodian sculpture. The vase was undoubtedly for a fountain and belongs to the late Republican or Augustan period. Also in the same district were found a statue of Cupid, a copy of Lysippus' Eros with a bow, and two other pieces of statuary. (Ibid., pp. 69-75.) GIOVANNI ANNIBALDI describes a large group of marble statuettes found in the excavation of a Roman country house on the Via Appia Nuova seven kilometers from the city. There are sixty- nine items all told, mostly statuettes, some bearing inscriptions in Greek or Latin. Noteworthy are a Jupiter, two figures of Hercules, Diana of Ephesus, a portrait head of an empress of about mid-third century (perhaps Etruscilla), a bas-relief of Astarte, dedications to Zeus Bronton. Annibaldi believes that slaves and soldiers of the Gordians here maintained the Phrygian cults and that the statuary was destroyed by one of the Christian emperors into whose hands the property later passed. (Ibid., pp. 76-104.) Sicily. - JOLE BOvI-MARcONI reports a frag- mentary dedication in Greek to Scipio Africanus after the defeat of Carthage. (Ibid., pp. 201 f.) The same writer records the finding of prehistoric graves with skeletons and pottery. The latter included three small vases, one of which con- tained ochre. (Ibid., pp. 202 f.) CHRISTIAN, MEDIAEVAL AND BYZANTINE Castles in the Region of Skorta.-The iden- tification of the sites of two of the castles in the region of Skorta forms the subject of a very in- teresting study published by Mr. JOHN SARRES in Arch. Eph., 1934-35, pp. 57-84. In mediaeval times the mountainous region that embraces today the provinces of Gortys and Olympia was known under the name of Skorta. It possessed five strong and famous castles, often mentioned in the Frankish chronicles, two of which, the castle of Araklovo and that of St. George, have never been satisfactorily identified. Based upon an ex- haustive study of the mediaeval chronicles, of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth century lists of castles, and upon an accurate topographical sur- vey of the region, the author definitely identifies Araklovo with the ancient "Samikon" which dominates the plain stretching from Elis to Triphylia. The ancient fortification works con- structed by the Elians were used during the Frank- ish period, but were allowed to fall to ruins during the Turkish occupation. The castle of St. George is proved with equal success to be the ancient citadel of Lykosoura. The identifications help to establish the topography of the region in mediaeval times and to elucidate the military campaigns that took place in the district during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. A topo- graphic map including the results of the study is attached to its text. Churches in Corcyra.- Mr. JOHN PAPADEME- TRIomou describes the church of Sts. Jason and Sosipatros in Corcyra in Arch. Eph., 1934-35, pp. 37-56, and incidentally gives a very interest- ing account of the early churches around the capital of that island. The church of Sts. Jason and Sosipatros, of a cruciform plan with an octagonal dome, is proved to belong to the twelfth century and to occupy the site of an earlier building, perhaps that of the first basilica built in the island and dedicated to St. Andrew. The architecture of the building, excellently discussed, presents the reasoned and logical arrangement that char- acterizes the central type of Byzantine churches</page><page sequence="19">540 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY of the twelfth century. It is not burdened with applied sculpture or other decoration. The in- terior was originally covered with frescoes which unfortunately were destroyed and covered with whitewash in 18920. A few traces of these can now be seen in the narthex, most important of which are fragments of a fresco representing St. Ar- senios. Among the ikons preserved, of especial interest are the works of the well known Cretan post-Byzantine painter, Emmanuel Zanes Bouni- ales, whose work and remunerations are noted in a seventeenth century manuscript recently found by the author. It contains a list of the possessions and property of the church. This beautiful church seems to have been damaged during the first siege of Corcyra by the Turks in 1537, and to have been repaired and restored to its present form in 1641. Daphne. - Dr. ANDREW XYNGOPOULLOS in Arch. Eph., 1934-35, pp. 1392-140, describes the fragments of a mosaic representation of the seated Virgin holding the Christ child ("Platytera"), placed in the apse of the Bema of the monastery of Daphne. The mosaic was almost completely destroyed by rain, and its fragments were reset in position by F. Novo between the years 1893 and 1897. They remained hidden, however, by a piece of cloth placed over them after the partial restoration. This cloth has been removed and the fragment is now exposed to view. The composition is similar in detail to the Virgin in the apse of Monreale, but superior in technique. It seems to have been the prototype of the fresco painted by Thiersch in the Russian church in Athens. It is placed between the well known mosaics of the Archangels and with them it forms a triptych. Thus it forms a unique example of such an ar- rangement of the well known theme of the "Platy- tera." Basilica at Anchialos.-Professor G. A. So- TERIOU reports in the Praktika, 1934, pp. 58-66, the progress of his excavations at Anchialos. His work in Basilica C proved that it belongs to the closing years of the sixth century of our era, or to the beginning of the seventh, and that it was built over an older structure dating perhaps in the fifth century. It also revealed a beautiful floor mosaic in the "aethrium" of the basilica, that was entirely cleared from its accumulation. At 300 m. from the fortification works of the old town and to the southwest end of it he also began the exploration of another church, Basilica D. The "bema" and part of the right aisle of the basilica were cleared and the stylobate of the east- ern row of columns was revealed. The basilica seems to be surrounded by vaulted tombs of the Christian era, filled with architectural members and inscriptions, which seem to indicate that Basilica D was the church of the cemetery of the Byzantine town. Basilica at Sparta. -Professor A. ADAMAN- DIOU reports, in the Praktika, 1934, pp. 123-128, that the final clearing of the Basilica of Hosios Nikon proved that the whole acropolis of Sparta was occupied by a monastery, the main church of which was the basilica. At a short distance from the acropolis he explored the ridge separat- ing Taygetus from the hill of Prophet Elias, where in 1931 he discovered a vaulted chamber, the walls of which were covered with a painting representing Apollo in the midst of the Muses. Near this chamber, which he calls the Heroon of the Muses, he discovered ten vaulted chamber- tombs, including eighty graves, originally bearing similar paintings. These burial chambers are badly preserved and only prove the existence at this site of an Early Christian cemetery believed to be contemporary with the catacombs of Rome. Proto-Bulgar Inscriptions from the Basilica at Philippi.-In B.C.H. lix, 1935, pp. 165-174, GEZA FEHER republishes two incriptions previ- ously published by DVORNIK, ibid., lii, 1928, pp. 1925-147. Since this publication, other fragments have been found, one of which fills a lacuna of the first of these inscriptions. The article begins with a note by P. Lemerle, to whom the author owes permission to publish these inscriptions, on the plan of the South stylobate of the basilica, from which these inscriptions come. A photograph of the first inscription is given, and a commentary in which Feher takes issue with previous publica- tions of the text, precedes the transliteration and translation. The second inscription is then given in transliteration, and with a translation. Both of these inscriptions are believed to belong to a single text, of which one stone is the beginning, and one the end. The inscription shows that the By- zanritines had disregarded their treaty obligations to the Bulgarians, and had been defeated by them; but that the Bulgarians had not destroyed the basilica at Philippi, but had permitted the Christians to continue in their use of it. An Editorial Note concludes the paper, calling atten- tion to other publications of these inscriptions.</page><page sequence="20">NEWS ITEMS FROM ATHENS The most noteworthy piece of archaeological news from Athens this autumn was the announce- ment that the German government would provide funds for a six years' campaign of extensive and in- tensive excavation at Olympia. The work was in- augurated by the retiring Director of the German Institute, Dr. Karo, just before his departure from Greece early in October. The German Institute also announced that Mr. Oberlaender, who has so generously provided the funds for the excavation of the Kerameikos in Athens, has now given a further sum to build a museum on this site to house the important series of funerary offerings and sculpture found during the course of the work in this area. From the end of September, 1935, to the mid- dle of March, 1936, Dr. KUibler excavated in the Kerameikos, investigating and clearing the wedge-shaped section of ground, formerly cov- ered by the mound and Church of Hagia Trias, which lies between the Street of Tombs, the Sacred Way, and the modern Piraeus Street (Fig. 1). The stratification here was so compli- cated that the work lasted several months longer than had been anticipated. The chronological sequence of graves with their interesting burial offerings has been established for three extraor- dinarily significant periods, namely: the period from Sub-Mycenaean to the end of the Geo- metric, the seventh century or the important Early Attic period, and the second part of the fifth century. In the region nearest Piraeus Street, twenty more Protogeometric and Geometric graves were discovered, thus making a total of forty for this section. Most of the Geometric graves contained incineration burials, and in one instance remains of the libation crater were dis- covered above the amphora containing the ashes.1 The closed group of objects from the separate graves again gives important evidence for the dating of Geometric pottery. The Protogeometric graves, as was to be expected, were without ex- ception incineration graves. Their splendid, and for the most part, well preserved ash amphoras (Figs. 2, 3) and their accompanying objects, to- gether with the sherds from the fill, lead from the earliest down to the late stage of Proto- Similar remains had been found in the earlier excavation.

A careful comparison of the groups from the various graves indicates that in the Protogeometric period burial began in this area at the north and proceeded southward. Four of the later graves, because of their differing orientation, east to west, stand out topographi- cally and chronologically as a closely associated group, perhaps the graves of one family. The pot- tery from the latest graves leads directly over to the Early Geometric. The earliest Geometric graves with their beautiful cinerary amphoras come next in position, as well as in time, to the southernmost Protogeometric graves. Thus the topographical position of the burials in this region corresponds to the course of development, as can be determined from a comparison of the form and ornament of the Protogeometric pottery down to the beginning of the Geometric. It was only the very latest Geometric graves that encroached on the Protogeometric cemetery and extended still farther northward. This is a welcome and unique proof of the validity of the conclusions as to the course of the development of the style, drawn from a study of the style itself. The most beautiful object found in the graves of later date is the Early Attic krater with two sphinxes which sit facing each other (Fig. 4). This vessel forms a connecting link with the large animals and human beings pictured on the vases of the last quarter of the seventh century and shows how much the final establishment of this form owes to the Protocorinthian (Fig. 5). The stratification in the section under Hagia Triada (Fig. 6) was more complicated than in the strip bordering Piraeus Street. In the region in- vestigated since 1935, twenty-one grave mounds and structures, including the Late Geometric erection of stone slabs, were found here in a tangle, intersecting and overlapping one another. These burials continue down to the end of the fifth century, the latest structures of the sixth and fifth centuries being of considerable extent. A grave mound of the second half of the seventh century and another, perhaps of the early sixth, bore at their summits the bases and lowest parts of the two earliest post-Geometric Attic grave stelae. Unfortunately, these were without in- scriptions. The earlier stele, a simple schist slab with irregular surface, broadens towards the top; 541</page><page sequence="21">E-4 P4 Pq 0q Hq 04 z- P4 P4</page><page sequence="22">NEWS ITEMS FROM ATHENS 543 the later one, of poros, is well worked and already shows the form narrowing toward the top. Both stelae were carefully fastened with lead into their bases. The Homeric grave monument, mound or stele, is here exemplified, for the first time in Attica, for the seventh century B.C. The definitive transition from the rough grave-stone without a base, of the Geometric period, to the developed stele, accordingly falls, at the latest, in the first half of the seventh century B.C. Among the later graves, some deserve especial mention. A large rectangular shaft grave under a FIG. 0?.-KERAMEIKOS. PROTOGEOMETRIC ASH AMPHORA substantial mound, dated by the stratification to the middle of the fifth century B.C., yielded not the slightest trace of a burial. It has a parallel in an earlier deep shaft grave of the late sixth cen- tury B.C. This latter, likewise under a regularly heaped up mound, contained clearly recognized remains of a revetment and floor of wood, but no traces of a skeleton nor any burned bone ash. On the wooden floor, however, surrounded by some small funerary offerings consisting of a chubby lekythos and a Lydian unguent jar, lay a block of poros. From its workmanship it appears to come from an earlier archaic building, and has thus been re-used here. The stone, consequently, can not have fallen into the grave pit at a later date through the sinking of the fill, since there would in that case have been a considerable layer of earth beneath it. It is equally unlikely that it lay originally on the cover of the wooden coffin and slipped down to the floor when the coffin collapsed, for no traces of such a lid are preserved. It is clearly, therefore, a second cenotaph. In place of the body, which for some reason was not buried here, the stone was deposited as a symbol and to take the place of the departed with reference to the cult of the dead. The wonderful bronze dinos, or cauldron, with tongue pattern, egg and dart and guilloche FIG. 3. - KERAMEIKOS. PROTOGEOMETRIC ASH AMPHORA decoration (Fig. 7) comes from a large sarophagus of shell limestone. It contained the ashes of the dead, wrapped in a finely woven cloth decorated with purple rectangles. The cauldron itself was in a coarse covering of bast or matting with broad purple stripes, and had been placed in a wooden chest, the decaying remains of which covered the floor of the sarcophagus about the dinos. Near the bronze vessel lay two unguent boxes of alabaster. The sarcophagus, closed with thick slabs, stood in the interior of a tomb built of crude bricks, only a small part of which was preserved. From the spread of the earth fill, how- ever, the building must have had a considerable extent.

The bronze cauldron must have been made in the same decade. In the sharp bend of the shoulder, the deep narrowing of the neck, and the under- cutting of the rim, it is later than the heavy Argive bronze urn in the British Museum. The urn in the Metropolitan Museum must pre- sumably also belong to an earlier stage of develop- ment. Among the toreutic works of the fifth cen- tury B.c. which have been preserved, the shape is rare. The grave of Hipparete herself may be recognized in an inhumation burial, covered with tiles from a well-shaft, close behind the founda- FIG. 7.- KERAMEIKOS. BRONZE DINos The Grave Table of Hipparete, the granddaugh- ter of Alcibiades, must have been erected over it soon after the levelling of the ground and the covering of the building at the end of the fourth century B.c. The connection of the stately build- ing of about 400 B.c. with the family of Alcibiades is also likely and has already been suggested. Any conclusion as to the identity of the person buried in this bronze cauldron would be prema- ture, and must wait for the examination of the bones and ashes to determine the sex of the dead. The exact date of the grave within the last third of the fifth century B.c. cannot be definitely es- tablished. It may well be only a trifle earlier than tions of her Trapeza. At the feet of the female skeleton lay two tear bottles and a stone spindle whorl. The left breast was decorated with a large rosette in stucco with traces of red and blue color and of gilding. Among the early Archaic graves an incinera- tion burial of the seventh century deserves men- tion. The accompanying offerings, including a beautiful Protocorinthian jug with animal frieze, were here burned with the dead, instead of in a separate offering channel. Another grave of this period, at the turn from the eighth to the seventh century, was an inhumation one and contained, as an important find, a pedestal cup, late Geomet- ric in shape, but with Protocorinthian affiliations, to judge by the color of the clay and technique. 1 Arch.

The loop ornaments on the pedestal end in serpent heads. In the decoration on the rim are traces of an Attic prototype of the "Phaleron" stage of development. For other in- teresting discoveries, cf. Figs. 8-11. To the eighth century belong three newly dis- covered Geometric graves under Hagia Triada, one, an amphora burial which contained Late Geometric offerings of interesting style and the other two, remains of pithoi with incised decora- tion, damaged by later graves. The earliest grave yet found in the Kerameikos is of importance as a continuation of the short series of closed Pre-Mycenaean groups in Athens, from the south slope of the Acropolis and from the Agora. This dates from the last stage of the Middle Helladic period. The skeleton was de- stroyed by later graves. Three handmade pots had been deposited with it; one of these is very like the covered vessel on a high foot from Aphidna. The Cycladic connections are clear. Another, a cup, has been coated with dark paint and decorated in white. Its shape is curiously distorted, the foot recalls Minyan ware, the deco- ration, Kamares ware. The third, a red polished bowl, is a survival of the widespread Early Helladic bowl of this shape. A small bowl of the same kind, but turned on a wheel, was recently found in a Protogeometric grave in the Agora. The total yield of Pre-Mycenaean sherds from the excavations in the Kerameikos comprises merely the foot of a Minyan crater and an imitation of a similar one, a small sherd with matt paint and a rim fragment of a deep-sided Early Helladic vessel with a delicate high handle. The investigation of the foundations of the Pompeion by H. Johannes is practically finished. It yielded some new evidence for the predecessors of the Pompeion in the fifth century. In 1934-35 there had been found under the Greek Pompeion of the fourth century another Pompeion or gym- nasium belonging to the second half of the fifth century, and it was thought that no earlier large building had stood in this marshy area. Mr. Johannes has, however, found indisputable re- mains of a large stone structure which appears to correspond in size and form to its successor of the second half of the fifth century. Beneath it again were three rows of about a hundred post holes, which may have been used in the construction of wooden stands for the spectators at the time of the Panathenaic Procession. Further exploration of the region north of the Dipylon which had been interrupted in 1915, was carried out by H. Johannes and K. Gehauer. Hardpan was reached in some places. It contains a number of early graves, chiefly Geometric. Between the Dipylon Gate and the Grave of the Lacedaemnionians, Mr. Johannes and Mr. Gebauer have cleaned the late Roman and mediaeval layers and made complete plans, so that they can now be removed and excavations continued beneath them. It had already been determined by the work in 1914-15 that the street to the Academy had, in Roman times, been pushed toward the northeast by some large rectangular tombs, and that the side road to Piraeus entered the main one at more and more of a diagonal from the south- east. The history of the street can now be traced down to the fifth century B.C. in its series of layers and rebuilding. In uncovering an earlier water channel, holes for wooden posts were found similar to those under the Pompeion. These ex- tended the entire distance from the Dipylon Gate to the modern Piraeus Street. They belong, ap- parently, to three successive periods, dating from the fifth to the middle of the fourth century B.C. These may have supported tribunes for spec- tators or possibly flagpoles. Through the building of the Lacedaemonian Tomb, in 404/403 B.C. on the southwest side of the street, the corner formed by the intersection of the side road from Piraeus with the Dromos, became larger. At that time, when the street sur- face was relaid with marble chips, a Bath which had not long been used was given up. In it was a mosaic pavement, the importance of which is evidenced by its three predecessors of the same diameter, all belonging to the fifth century. The two earliest are simple trodden floors of packed earth, the later ones consist of very good polished- pebble mosaic. The centre is slightly raised so that water would run off to the narrow channel around the edge. All four structures had drains of terracotta pipes or stone channels that carried the water to underground canals. Some large cisterns nearby that are coated with stucco may have belonged to this establishment. The circular mosaic pavement is shown, by parallels in Thera, Eretria, Oiniadai and Piraeus, to be the floor of a closed bathroom. According to Isaeus in Harpo- kration, s.v. Anthemokritos, a Bath stood, in the first half of the fourth century, before the Thria-</page><page sequence="27">FIG. 8. -KERAMEIKOS.

Pausanias, I, 36, 3, mentions the bath as being beside the Sacred Way. The side road in this area crosses the road to Eleusis and the first public grave situated on its other side may well be that of Anthemokritos. This would, therefore, give a fixed starting point for the topography of the public tombs. Further excavation is needed to settle the question. In the first half of the fourth century a house with mosaic floors and stuccoed rooms was con- structed at the intersection of the roads and about this same date the adjustment between H 0 PO0~ 2 before theLacedaemonians'Tomb, and H 0P0* 1 which stands some 2 m. higher beside the city wall, must have been made; this adjustment was per- haps connected with the new construction of the Pompeion and with the extension of the Themis- toclean predecessor of the Dipylon Gate. In the later fourth century, when the level of the side road had also risen, the fill in the Dromos, prob- ably to be dated to the time of Konon, was ex- tended northwestward and H 0PO: 2 disappeared beneath the level of the street. The Hellenistic Period occasioned only slight changes in the course of the street but with the same tendency which was also followed in Roman times. The large bath basins of the second and first centuries B.c. were probably destroyed by the siege under Sulla when they were covered over by concrete which may have served as a substructure for siege engines. From the first century B.C. down to this period the area between the Lacedaemo- nian Tomb and the Dipylon had thus served pro- fane uses, which is all the more surprising since numerous Geometric graves had already been cut in the hardpan and the crude brick wall of an archaic tomb appears in the sand of a small stream that ran here in early times. Among the objects found in this region especial attention is merited by the head, worked in the round, of a seated figure in high relief. Although the proportions recall Parthenon heads, the piece must be dated to the second half of the fourth century, since before that date portions in the round do not occur on grave reliefs. The head is probably to be assigned to a grave relief on ac- count of the expression. From the treatment of the hair it appears to be a woman. This was dis- covered in the foundations of a late Roman wall. In a stone ossuary which probably belongs to a grave monument of the second century A.D. was found a completely preserved marble urn. In it lay the twelve leaves of a golden wreath and, representing the obol of Charon, a gold plaque, stamped in imitation of the late Athenian coins with a representation of an owl and an amphora.' During June and July, 1936, Homer Thompson and R. Scranton investigated the remains of the ancient fortification of the Pnyx. The wall ascend- ing the north slope of the Hill of the Nymphs could be traced some distance farther until it disappeared in the garden of the Observatory. Immediately southeast of the dwelling house of the Director, on the ascent to the Pnyx, there came to light a tower (ca. 7.50 x 9.50 m.) from which a hitherto unknown wall extends south- ward. This wall may have been built at the end of the third century B.c. and may form part of the fortification of Eurykleides and Mikion. It con- sists of conglomerate blocks of moderate size, is only 2 to 2.10 m. thick, and has, on its inner side at short intervals, peculiar buttresses. Only isolated portions of this wall have yet been un- covered in the trial trenches. It follows the line of the crest of the Pnyx and behind its central sec- tion a tower (?) abuts against it. This tower (?) is more than 9 m. square. The wall may have been stepped here. Just to the south is another but- tress on which lies a stone cannon ball. About 140 m. farther southward there is a broad terrace in- side the walls and below it are two house walls and pottery of the middle of the third century B.c. Close against the fortification wall on the outside was a grave with an Augustan lamp. The wall must therefore have been still standing in that period. To the south, a tower, now excavated for the first time, abuts at the corner of the wall. Nearby, towards the east, at the end of the long colonnade is the tower of beautiful conglomerate blocks with cushion finish, which was excavated in 1935. It has now been completely cleared and can be dated to about, or shortly after, 4C0 B.C. A massive, almost quadrangular structure of ca. 14 x 16 m., it was, perhaps, an independent watch tower like the one excavated years ago by the Greeks on the Hill of the Muses.2 The Hadrianic wall runs eastward across the tower. Some repairs and two rough towers date from the fourth to fifth century A.D.

In the region of Plato's Academy, the foolish opposition of the neighboring inhabitants and their political leaders have succeeded in holding up the work of Mr. Aristophron for more than a year, but in May, 1936, he was once more able to resume his excavations. He has confined himself chiefly to the Middle Helladic settlement dis- covered the preceding year and two more houses have been uncovered. In the National Museum the Director, Mr. Philadelpheus, and his assistant Mrs. Karusu- Papaspyridi, have done some very successful re- arranging of the collection. In the Mycenaean Hall, and especially in the small adjoining Pre- Mycenaean room, a great improvement has been made. In the latter are now shown the important finds from the Cycladic settlement at Hagias Kosmas on the south coast of Attica, beyond Old Phaleron. In the halls of the pottery and other minor arts a new arrangement has been made and here also are exhibited the water colors of E. Gillibron, the copies of the wooden tablets from the cave at Pitsa. In two side rooms Gillieron has now united his own and his father's unique collec- tion of copies of Minoan and Mycenaean monu- ments of all kinds and periods. Among the new acquisitions of the Museum by far the most important, is the rear part of a life- size bronze horse. It was recovered from the sea about 15 km. west of the place where the former forepart of a horse was found. The new fragment comprises the left side with the leg down to the fetlock. Unfortunately, none of the fragments from the earlier discovery actually fit this bronze and the whole problem still remains open as to the connection of the new piece with the old, as well as with the small Hellenistic rider. A large and admirable grave relief of the end of the fourth century was found in June, 1936, during building operations at Psychiko, north of Athens. This shows a child held by a serving woman, while turn- ing toward his mother, who is seated to the right. In its unusual vivacity this is one of the best an- cient representations of children. There should be mentioned also a Late Archaic bronze horse; a life size nude male torso of marble from Liopesi, in Attica, of the middle of the fifth century; a marble grave lekythos from Markopoulo, with three figures in a scene of parting, inscribed "Aristeides" over the man at the left, of fourth century date; a table leg of Roman times with a lion's head and lion's paw, the latter on a cubical base, with a bull in relief; a head of Augustus from the Roman Agora; and a marble ram from a grave found in Muller Street, near Piraeus Street. Through the Society of the Friends of the Museum some examples of the minor arts were acquired, namely: a bronze mirror from Vonitsa in Akar- nania, with Dionysos and Ariadne seated; three Mycenaean jugs, one of which has a unique deco- ration, another with a "stirrup handle," and a tubular spout. James H. Oliver of the Agora staff, assembled in the Epigraphical Museum forty-four inscribed fragments of Pentelic marble belonging to a tripod base perhaps three metres high, a triangular monument of which the sides, slightly concave, were about 0.865 m. wide. Most of the fragments join as one piece, and the monument has been partially rebuilt near the entrance of the Epi- graphical Museum. The monument originally stood in the Asklepieion. It was erected in the first half of the third century after Christ by a certain Statius Glaucus in honor of his grandfather Sara- pion, who had composed a paean. On the front of the monument were engraved a preamble in prose anid a philosophical poem in the dactylic hexam- etre composed by Glaucus, and in smaller letters the paean of Sarapion, most of which has dis- appeared. On the left side was engraved an old paean of the tragic poet Sophocles. This is the most valuable inscription. The three main frag- ments of the paean of Sophocles were already known as belonging together, but it was not real- ized that they join and form a continuous text of some extent. On the right side was engraved a list of distinguished citizens who chanted the paeans in the archonship of Munatius Vopiscus (ca. 174/5 A.D.). The monument seems to reflect a religious ceremony at the time of the plague of Antonius. Before rebuilding the base in the Epigraphical Museum Mr. Oliver received permission to turn over and clean old stones on the south slope of the Acropolis on the chance of discovering other frag- ments. In regard to the Sarapion monument the search was disappointing, but several unpub- lished inscriptions came to light. Of these the most important is a sizable fragment of I.G., 12, 22, the Athenian decree concerning Miletus 1 in 450/49 i.c.2 ELIZABETH PIERCE BLEGEN I T.A.P.A.

Their activities went on unabated, even though the war in Ethiopia kept most tourists away, and the hotels, tradespeople, dragomans, and donkey men had a discouraging winter. The Expedition of the Metropolitan Museum of Art found in the hill Sheikh Abd el Kurneh at Thebes, just below the earlier of two tombs pre- pared for Senmfit, Steward of Amfin in Queen Hatshepsut's reign, the tomb of Senmfit's parents (Fig. 1). Their small burial chamber was intact, having been protected by limestone chips thrown down from the excavation of their son's larger tomb, and it was crowded with funerary material (Fig. 2). Inscriptions on the respective coffins established the identity of the father Ra'mose and the mother Hatnfifer, whose names were known through other sources. On two jars from the tomb are dates in the seventh year (of Thut- mose III); the burial, then, presumably took place in that year or soon after. And on some of the linen and on jar sealings occur the name and titles assumed by Ijatshepsut when she became King of Egypt; this event, therefore, would appear to have taken place within seven years of the time when Tbhutmose III inherited the throne. In the same part of the necropolis was discovered the mummy of a horse, wrapped, and interred in its own coffin. As it is quite certainly of the XVIIIth Dynasty, it is probably the earliest horse ever found in Egypt.' Much valuable and, in part, exciting material was uncovered a few miles south of Thebes at Armant 2 and Tftd,1 in the home territory of the war-god Montu. For example, both sites yielded reliefs of the Middle Kingdom reused as founda- tion and pavement blocks, among which perhaps the most delicate and beautiful are of the reign of the elusive last king of the XIth Dynasty, S'ankh- kari'-Mentuhbotpe, whose actual burial place-if his political fortunes permitted a typical royal interment-is still unknown. At Armant reliefs of the time of Thutmose III included a subject unique in the known art of Egypt, a rhinoceros that had been captured by the king (Fig. 3). And it was at Tad, across the river, that below the Ptolemaic temple a cache of four chests came to light containing ingots of precious metals and rich art objects of foreign origin dated to the second half of the XXth century B.C. by the name of the Pharaoh Amenemhit II on the lids of two of the chests (Figs. 4-6).

There, the last stage of ancient Egyptian, hitherto supposed to have died out completely by the XVIth century of our era, still has a little use as a "secret" language.' The discovery was con- firmed by William H. Worrell of the University of Michigan, who regards it as promising new aid to the study of Coptic phonetics. Of excavations in the region of Cairo, the out- standing news concerns forty-two unplundered storage chambers at Sakkareh in the tomb of the Vizier Hemaka of the 1st Dynasty, who lived earlier than 3000 B.C. There, Walter B. Emery and Zaki Sa'd working for the Department of Antiquities of the Egyptian Government found what had been missed by ancient robbers and previous modern scientific investigators, and in the second week of April, samples of the contents of the chambers-formidable looking arrows of several types, an enormous bone-pointed lance, disks of varying materials and ornamentation, in- scribed sickles of wood with flint teeth, etc.- were exhibited as "Recent Accessions" in the Egyptian Museum, Cairo.2 Selim Hassan continued his excavations for the Egyptian University, opening tombs in the ceme- tery around the Second of the Gizeh Pyramids.3 The Egyptian University's excavations in west- ern Hermopolis Magna under Samy Gabra par- tially uncovered a temple of the Ptolemaic and Roman periods.4 In excavations of the University of Strassbourg at Tanis, among other recoveries in late struc- tures, Pierre Montet turned up blocks of the Old Kingdom, notably a doorjamb bearing the name of Kha'efr' and fragments of bas-relief.5 Though naturally attracting less attention than the recovery of new material of unexpected char- acter, much valuable work on publications was in progress last winter in Egypt. At the Harvard camp only minor excavations were conducted to elucidate questions that arose in connection with the series of publications which George A. Reisner and his assistants are now pushing toward com- pletion; one volume on tomb development to the accession of Khufu, an epitome of Dr. Reisner's accumulated knowledge of the years, came off the press before the end of the season and will be reviewed in this JOURNAL presently. The Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago was busy at its two centers in Thebes and Memphis throughout the winter, despite the blow which it received in December in the death of its distinguished Director, James H. Breasted. Two folio volumes on the small temple of Ramesses III within the Karnak enclosure by Field Director Harold H. Nelson and his associates were issued in May, and from the northern center (now re- grettably given up) under Field Director Prentice Duell the copy for two folios on the tomb of Mereruka was dispatched to the publishers (Fig. 7). In addition, a quarto by former members of the staff at Thebes, William F. Edgerton and John A. Wilson, who has succeeded to the Di- rectorship of the Institute, came out in March; this book discusses texts published in the earlier Medinet Habu folios I and II. At Abydos, in the temple of Sety I, where Amice Calverley and Myrtle Broome are copying in facsimile under the joint auspices of the Egypt Exploration So- ciety6 and Chicago's Oriental Institute, work went on apace, and all copies in color are now completed; the material for Vol. III was ready at the close of the season, Vols. I and II being already issued. The Egyptian Government's activities included the strengthening of ancient temples in many lo- calities under the direction of E. Baraize, and, to some extent, the replacing of ancient blocks, notably so at Hatshepsut's temple, where for several weeks in the Spring the chants of the na- tive workmen resounded from the Deir el Bahri cliffs. At Karnak, Henri Chevrier went on with his procedures for conserving edifices still stand- ing and assembling in the so-called Mus6e the recoverable parts of structures which had been discarded in antiquity, their blocks surviving only as reused building material. At Sakk.reh, in De- cember 1935, for days, a procession of workmen 1 See Vycichl's forthcoming essay in the Mit- teilungen des deutschen Instituts fiir idgyptische Altertumskunde in Kairo.

Within the season of 1935 to 1936 four royal quarto vol- umes on the remarkable discoveries of recent years at the Step Pyramid appeared, the authors being the late Cecil M. Firth, the late J. E. Quibell, and the architect of the Sakkareh field, J. P. Lauer. At South Sakk.reh at the Pyramid temple of Pepy II, where Gustave Jequier has worked for the Egyptian Government for several seasons, the chief attention was given to the final collation of new Pyramid Texts and drawings of the decora- tion of the Sanctuary, of which more remains than of any other sanctuary of the Old Kingdom; this sanctuary has the further distinction of being the largest surviving hall of the period. At the lower end of the causeway, evidence for a hitherto un- known type of terraced approach was found - to some degree suggestive of the later terraces at Deir el Bahri-and by the Pyramid of Queen Neit the adobe houses of her priests were dis- covered, having party walls and equal depth but unequal size laterally and having stairs leading either to a second story or the roof.1 In April the late King Fuad enriched the Egyptian Museum in Cairo by the gift of his col- lection of scarabs and other small objects.2 Before the end of the winter the Directorship of the Department of Antiquities was vacated by Pierre Lacau who wishes to devote himself, un- hindered by administrative duties, to those sci- entific labors in which he is so eminent. Early in the summer Etienne Drioton of the Louvre Mu- seum was appointed to the post with Selim Has- san as Sub Director. 1See "Rapport prdliminaire sur les travaux executes en 1935-1936" to appear soon in the Annales du Service des Antiquites de l'Egypte. I have to thank M. Jequier for kindly permitting me to use a final proof of this report. 2 Eg. Gaz., April 9, 1936; Chron. d'IEg., 22, pp. 471-472. C. R. WVILLIAMS TOLEDO, OHIO</page></plain_text>
