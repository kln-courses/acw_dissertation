<plain_text><page sequence="1">Principles of Gestalt Psychology. By KURT KOFFKA. New York, Har- court, Brace and Co., 1935. PP. xi, 720. This important work by one of the leading authorities in the field of Gestalt theory outlines a systematic survey of psychology. Repre- senting years of preparation and study, it succeeds in apprizing the reader of the vast amount of experimental research behind the system, while yet impressing upon him the developmental character of the</page><page sequence="2">No. 4.] REVIEWS OF BOOKS 413 movement. The work also reveals the consistent program and progress of this system, for, beginning with the study of the fundamental laws in elementary problems of perception, it then turned to the more com- plex phenomena of memory, thinking, and acting. A general criticism of Gestalt theory has been that it does not provide an explanation of emotion, personality, and the like; but now these objections lose much of their force. Professor Koffka begins his book by mapping out his conception of the nature and function of psychology. He states that a psychology that has no place for meaning and value and culture in its system is inadequate. Koffka explains the interest of Gestalt theory in these matters by pointing to the circumstances under which Gestalt psy- chology took its origin in Germany: it was a way of meeting the criticisms of speculative psychologists and philosophers who belittled the achievements of experimental psychology. The author's own posi- tive conception of psychology is that it must be integrative, having for its function the assimilation of life and nature. Thus through its psy- chology Gestalt theory aims to make a contribution to our philosophical attitude toward the world. In developing this thesis Koffka is rather critical of American positivistic tendencies, especially behaviorism. No doubt some opponents will feel that he exaggerates the contrast between German and American culture in order to make Gestalt theory appear more original and more German in origin than it really is. The central problem of Gestalt theory is that of organization, the forces which produce it, and the relations of such local segregations to the wider background of events. Gestalt theory is always seeking for the dynamics of the situation. By taking over the notion of "tensions" and reading into it the necessary anthropomorphism, an assimilation of physics and psychology is attained. Another concept which looms more important as time goes on is the notion of isomorphism. This term refers to the similarity of structure in phenomenal, physiological, and physical Gestalten. Whether such structural identity is based upon one-to-one correspondence, or one-many, or many-one, is a problem which apparently has not thus far been considered. It is in connection with this notion of isomorphism that one funda- mental criticism of Gestalt theory may take its origin. It is generally known that the theory originated in an effort to explain perceived motion (Wertheimer's phi-phenomenon). Koffka fully realizes the foundational character of the problem of seen motion and therefore considers at length the perception of temporal patterns. He even feels called upon to show the fallacy in Zeno's paradoxes of motion. In view of the necessity that Gestalt theory give a good account of motion and the perception of motion, it is surprising to find the statement (685) that "Gestalt theory would not be refuted if its hypotheses of per-</page><page sequence="3">414 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XLV. ceived motion were proved to be false". Since the refutation of posi- tivism is found in the direct experience of causality (continuity of motion), can this statement-be true? In developing his theories of perceived motion Koffka relies upon the experimental work of F. J. Brown, who has shown the erroneous nature of the assumption that the "apparent" velocity has a simple relation to the "real" velocity. That is, the phenomenal velocity of an object seen in motion is field-conditioned, depending on the brightness- field, the size and orientation of the object, and its direction of motion. Brown points out the conditions under which "phenomenal identity of velocity" may be obtained. Koffka then notes (296) that since the definition of velocity is impossible without time, it is pertinent to in- quire into the relation between phenomenal time and behavioral velocity. The result he describes as "astounding", for it turns out that the ex- perience of time is also a field-conditioned property which is influenced by factors apparently having nothing to do with it. This is satisfying so long as the world in which we have our being is a "phenomenal" world. But in Gestalt theory this experienced world must be assimilated to the world of physics. We are specifically told (28I) that "the physical correlate of perceived motion must be a real process of change within the total physiological process patterns". These process patterns in turn, we have been told, are conditioned by physical processes and structures. But how is this phenomenal velocity related to the physical velocity? If we are not to violate the "psy- chological" facts, must we not reexamine the notion of isomorphism? To be a thoroughgoing physical theory Gestalt theory will, of course, have to be assimilated to relativity theory. Koffka's reference to Hel- son's tau-effect substantiates this. If we allow the physicist to interpret the psychological facts in terms of the four-dimensional space-time manifold of relativity, we get a true "isomorphism", but then we do not have the opposition of "phenomenal" and "real" velocities. It has frequently been pointed out that the separation of space and time is artificial (i.e., what is a space-interval in one frame of reference may be a time-interval in another). Gestalt theory splits the spatial and temporal Gestalten by the virtual reintroduction of the notion of "local" times (of the ego-frame), but if we are to take our physicizing seri- ously we will have to recognize that every Gestalt is a four-dimensional space-time organization. If we do this, however, we must then face the difficulty of fitting the asymmetry (irreversibility) of experienced time into the symmetrical space-time continuum of relativity theory. As Mile Meyerson has pointed out, even the irreversibility of the second law of thermodynamics appears as an "irrational" in the con- tinuum of relativity physics. On the whole, however, Professor Koffka has courageously under- taken a difficult task and carried it through in an exceedingly able</page><page sequence="4">No. 4.] REVIEWS OF BOOKS 4I5 manner. Nevertheless it is clear that we are still far from the final synthesis of nature and life which Gestalt theory seeks to envisage. Undoubtedly it is one of the merits of Koffka's work that it does not exaggerate the achievements thus far attained, and instills into the reader a vivid anticipation of future work to be undertaken.
