<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE METRIC SYSTEM IN THE UNITED STATES LEWIS M. BRANSCOMB Director, National Bureau of Standards (Read November 12, 1971) A FAMOUS REPORT on weiglhts and measures by Jolhn Quincy Adams, submitted to the United States Senate on February 22, 1821, said: Weights and measures may be ranked among the necessarys of life to every individual of human society. They enter into the economical arrange- ments and daily concerns of every family. They are necessary to every occupation of human industry, to the distribution and security of every species of property, to every transaction of trade in commerce, to the labors of the husbandman, to the ingenuity of the artificer, to the studies of the philosopher, to the reaches of the antiquarian, to the navigation of the mariner and the marches of the soldier; to all the exchanges of peace and all the operations of war. The knowledge of them, as an established use, is aimong the first elements of education and is oft- learnt hy those who learn notlhing else, not even to read and write. This knowledge is riveted in the memory by the habitual application of it to the eill- ployments of men throughout life. Adams made clear that measurement is mani's second language. It is absorbed from birth, almost unconsciously. It is used to describe the world about Us. The units in a measurement language serve as words, and measurement standards provide definitions of the words. The International Bureau of Weights and Measures and, in this country, the National Bureau of Standards serve as dictionaries where we can look up the definitions. These meclhaniislmis ensure an intelligible and accurate measturemiienit language.

Changing one's measurement language, then, is essentially unlearning something never really taught in the first place. From Adams's examples, we see the monumental difficulty in the concept of changing the measurement language of an entire nation. It is essentially the changing of folkways, not simply a straightforward educational problem. Yet, we read more and more in the press these days of the possibility of this country's conversion to the metric system. Congress has been considering legislation to formalize the pro- cess of "going metric." The dream of a world measurement language has been almost as elusive as the dream of a universal verbal language. Now it seems that we are closer to a universal measurement language than ever before. Virtual world-wide acceptance of the metric measurement language, however, finds the United States, a leading world power, in an unusual posi- tion-dead last. The map (fig. 1) shows in gray the nations that have been metric for some time, in black those that have made their commitment to convert since the war, and in white those who have not yet made that decision. Among the non- metric nations are Barbados, Liberia, Muscat, Sierra Leone, Nauru, South Yemen (the Northern Yemenite might be more progressive), Tonga, Trinidad, and the United States. We are the last industrialized nation which is neither speaking the metric language as its predominant language nor committed to it in the near future. However, we have undergone considerable amount of metric adaptation already. Whether more metric conversion will be the sort of offici- ally-sponsored total conversion that other nations have already undergone or merely the continua- tion of the creeping metrication we now have (or something in between) is not yet clear. The question was put to the National Bureau of Standards by the Congress in Public Law 89- 472. The resulting three-year study has now been completed and the findings transmitted to the Congress last July with recommendations by Secretary of Commerce Maurice H. Stans. In brief, the secretary recommended that we change to the metric system deliberately and carefully through a coordinated national program; that the Congress establish a target date ten years ahead; and that there be a firm government commitment to this goal. Details of the study have been pub- lished in twelve volumes, plus one very readable well-illustrated summary.' Most recently the de- partment has sent legislation to Congress to help the United States accept the ultimate shift in our national measurement language. The subject of measurement language has to start with some consideration of the strange and wonderful growth of that measurement language most of us think of as our very own-that formerly called English, or the customary system as I shall call it. (We must no longer attribute it to our neighbors across the sea who have abandoned it.) When I took office as Director of the National Bureau of Standards I did not expect to preside over the total demise of the customary weights and measures system; it is unlikely I shall live to see such an event. In some form and in some uses our customary units will be with us for a very long time. Today horse races are run in furlongs, and in California land is still sold by the square vara. The customary system has never really had smooth sailing; yet it has survived. One argu- ment that was put forth by Adams in his report at the beginning of the last century-he con- cluded we should not adopt the metric system at that time, by the way-was that it would be folly for us to adopt prematurely a measurement lan- guage which would be different from that of our major trading partners. The thing to be sought, according to Adams, was compatibility and uni- formity in a world measurement language, after which we would then know what to adopt. One argument which British industry used in opposing that country's metric conversion was that they should not use a measurement language different from that of the United States. Yet, we have never used the same size gallon and only since 1959 have we used the same size inch. Speaking the same measurement language has never been protection against disagreement. A man from the National Bureau of Standards, traveling in Ethiopia a few years ago, went down a street in Addis Ababa, along which there were many little market stalls. At the end of the street was a fellow selling melons in a very poor com- mercial location. To try to make up for his dis- advantaged position he had a sign above his melon stand that said "Buy your melons here. My kilo- gram is bigger." 1 A Metric America: A Decision Whose Time Has Come, by D. V. Simone, (U. S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D. C.).</page><page sequence="3">296 LEWIS M. BRANSCOMB [PROC. AMER. PHIL. SOC. FIG. 2 Additional measurement languages only com- plicate life. I recently uncovered some notes by Count Rumford on the management of fire and the economy of fuel. There, in the welter of measure- ment languages of the late 1700's, the count wrote with admirable composure of using a copper boiler 22 Rhineland inches in diameter, which weighed 50 Bavarian pounds, which is 61.92 pounds avoirdupois. He filled it with 95 Bavarian measures of water, which he kindly informed us is 28 English wine gallons. The water, inci- dentally, weighed 187 Bavarian pounds, or 232.58 avoirdupois pounds. His fuel is dry beech wood, a cord of which (or clafter as it was then called) was 5 feet 8.9 inches high and weighed about 2,200 Bavarian pounds or 2,724 avoirdupois pounds. Just as an additional historical note, I think that you should know that a clafter of beech wood cost him 315 kreuzers or 51 florins which, of course, is 9 shillings 6 pence ha'penny. Through all of this the good count not only kept his sanity but did enough sound experimentation to make his name immortal in the history of science. Our customary system of measurement flows from the Anglo-Saxon usage which probably traces back to that fountain head of measure- ment, the cubit, used in Egypt as the standard of length for the construction of pyramids. The cubit represents a link with man's earliest mea- surements using parts of his body as gauges. His hands and arms were always with him to measure short lengths; his stride served as a measure of longer distances. The cubit was the distance from the elbow to the tip of the middle finger, usually about 18 inches. Lin Yutang tells us that the oriental starts a bridge from both sides of the river. If the two pieces meet in the middle, he has a bridge. If they do not meet, he continues both and has two bridges, which is better anyway. The Egyptians, concerned that a small stone mason and a big one would work connecting sides of a pyramid and not end up meeting, produced a granite royal cubit as their length standard. The Anglo-Saxon measurement units, though they existed centuries after the Egyptians used physical standards, still depended heavily upon anthropomorphic origins. In addition to the cubit they used the inch, which was the length from the knuckle to the tip of the thumb. The palm was four fingers, the measure we still use, though civilized behavior advises that we limit ourselves to one or two fingers per drink. Strangely enough, the foot did not originate with its namesake. This is one of those devastations which the gods of language visit on chaotic systems. The foot was originally four palms of sixteen fingers. The yard was the distance from King Edgar's nose to the tip of the middle finger of his outstretched arm. A fathom was the length of a Viking's em- brace. Eventually, the British came back to the Egyptian realization that not everyone's thumb or embrace was the same. They standardized the foot 1 ,000 year ago as thirty-six barleycorns taken from the middle of the ear. At the same time, the Germans were defining the rod or pole or perch as the combined length of the feet of sixteen good men selected at random as they came out of church (fig. 2). Churchill Eisenhart of the National Bureau of Standards has an original edition of the book in which this plate is con- tained. He took the tables of distribution of American foot sizes developed by the shoe industry and computed that, if people's feet varied in size in those days as they do now, the same procedure would result in a precision within about three per cent simply by selecting sixteen people at random coming out of church. It is only a short step from standardization of this sort to the use of measuring bars, metal weights, and such measures as we are accustomed to today. There is an interesting parallel between these early attempts at standardization and our present practice. The barleycorns and the feet were defined in naturally occurring regularities to give better reproducibility. Today we define our second of time (a unit of time interval) in terms</page><page sequence="4">VOL. 116, NO.4,1972] METRIC SYSTEM IN THE UNITED STATES 297 of the natural frequency of the nuclei of cesium atoms, and the meter is defined in terms of a wavelength of light from certain krypton atoms. Both are naturally occurring regularities, but regularities which possess a degree of precision to meet today's needs. We now have the capability of improving the definition of the unit of length by using light from a stabilized laser. With such a definition it will be possible to define length reproducibly and independently in any location to twelve digits, which should greatly benefit science and technology. The metric system evolved from this desire to base an entire consistent measurement system on some natural constant. It developed from the appointment by the French National Assembly in 1790 of a committee to explore the possibilities of a rational system of measurement. They, by the way, addressed a communication to the King of England and invited the Royal Society of London to join with them in developing jointly an inter- national system of measurement. Unfortunately, the Royal Society declined to participate, which was undoubtedly the single event that prevented the emergence of a unified world measurement system. Thomas Jefferson proposed, in the same year, that the United States look into the adoption of a new and more rational unit of length. While Jefferson's efforts came to naught, the French committee proposed the new unit of length, the meter, to be defined as one ten-millionth of the quadrant of the earth measured on the meridian passing through Dunkirk and Barcelona. The unit of mass was set as that of one cubic decimeter of water at the temperature of its maximum density; this volume would be called a litre. Unfortunately, the standard of length derived from measurements of the earth and marked off on a bar proved to be quite different from one ten-millionth of the earth quadrant. And the mass derived from the water measurement was not very close to the definition. In the end, the metric system might better have been founded on the use of a platinum bar and a platinum weight. But the idea of a measurement system based on natural standards such as the geometry of the earth is sound. It is a concept we are returning to as we adopt atomic definitions of length, of time, and I predict within the next ten years, of mass as well. The definition of measurement units, as fasci- nating a process as that might be, is not the main purpose of this discussion. I want to discuss some of the practical ramifications of our evolving mea- surement language. Whether we undertake a coordinated national effort to convert to the metric measurement system-as England and Australia are now doing and Canada plans to do-or whether we elect to let events take their course, use of the metric system of measurement will in- crease in this country. In the world we stand isolated as the only industrialized nation not yet committed. Only the tremendous strength of the American economy and American technology give us any choice in the matter. We can hold out for some time using our present measurement system. What such action would cost us in the long run and save us in the short run is very much in doubt. Also in doubt is the cost of conversion now and the savings that might accrue in the long term. The National Bureau of Standards metric study was partly directed at trying to answer these questions. The metric system is as firmly woven into our national fabric as the customary system of mea- surement. In 1866 the Congress passed a law making the metric system legal in trade and com- merce; in fact, it specifically makes it illegal to forbid the use of the metric system in trade and commerce. The law reads: It shall be lawful throughout the United States of America to employ the weights and measures of the metric system and no contract or dealing or pleading in any court shall be deemed invalid or liable to objection because the weights or measures expressed or referred to, therein, are weights or measures of the metric system. The customary system of inches and pounds has never been similarly recognized by Congress, It is, however, recognized at the state level where the constitutional authority for regulations of weights and measures in retail trade has been permitted to rest. Congress, in unusual self- restraint, has not exercised its authority under the Constitution for establishing the weights and mea- sures for the United States of America. Why it has not is another story; a story of what Samuel Wesley Stratton, working with the States in 1904, did to make it unneccessary for the federal govern- ment to preempt that state authority.2 We at the National Bureau of Standards have been aware that this country has been, legally speaking, on the metric system for a long time. 2 This story is told in chapter 2 of Measures For Progress, A History of the National Bureau of Standards (U. S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D. C.).</page><page sequence="5">298 LEWIS M. BRANSCOMB [PROC. AMER. PHIL. SOC. In 1893 this country adopted a meter bar as its standard of length and a kilogram mass as the standard of mass. Since then, by international agreement, by the Metric Convention in particu- lar, the meter bar was put aside and a wavelength of light adopted as the standard of length. But the wavelength still defines the meter. The inch and the pound are only recognized as fractions of metric units. They have no physical embodiment and there are no longer any prototype standards of inches and pounds that have any significance. As a matter of fact, in 1960 a most effective change was adopted by the international treaty agreement: the rationalization of the inch to be precisely 2.54 centimeters with an arbitrary number of zeros after it. As a result of that definition, a gear with 127 or 254 teeth can be matched with a gear of 50 or 500 teeth to convert any inch-based machine to a metric machine without loss of precision. Science in all nations, including ours, uses the metric system almost exclusively. Here, I should point out that I have been using the phrase, "the metric system," for purposes of communication. We properly should describe it as the Systeme International (SI) or International System of Measurement. The reason is that the work of the Metric Convention Treaty Organization and the General Conference of Weights and Measures is adhered to by some forty-four nations. This is the international body which now establishes a single international system of measurement and has resolved the substantial discrepancies among the many measurement systems in use around the world. There is now one unique metric system- the Sl system-which I refer to in common lan- guage as the international metric system. Our industry is gradually getting on the metric system. The whole pharamaceutical industry has switched, and the ball-bearing industry has virtu- ally completely changed over. But there are other places where we exhibit a metric schizophrenia. For example, the width of photographic film is given in millimeters but the distance between the film sprocket holes is standardized to fractions of an inch. Spark-plug threads are metric, but the plug heads and the wrenches are specified in inches. And there are many, many other examples. The Ford Motor Company is building a $100 million factory in Ohio to make metric Pinto engines. Twenty-three per cent of the cars on the road in this country are based on a signifi- cant amount of metric design. Thus we shall soon be alone in the metric world, with metric language totally infusing our vocabulary. Yet we are still faced with a decision which for two hundred years has plagued the Congress. On many occasions Congress has narrowly approached the decision to go metric, and has always retreated from it at the last moment. The issue today is really not which is the intrinsically more meritorious system of measure- ment-metric or customary. I would accept John Quincy Adams's judgment, indeed, that the metric system is intrinsically superior. Mathematics teachers believe, after some considerable study, that a significant amount of teaching time in elementary school can be saved if the metric mea- surement language becomes habitual and the teach- ing of fractions can be postponed and the intro- duction of decimals brought in sooner. There are some arguments, of course, in favor of the customary system. One of the most familiar is its anthropomorphic character. The decimal system, with its much greater ease of mathematical manipulation, alEo has a unique anthopomorphic characteristic which must not be forgotten. That is the base of ten, which is not there by accident- I learned how to count on my fingers. The issue is not which is better. It is not whether a duodecimal base for mathematics is more convenient. Probably it would be. But it is too late for that now. The real issue is: What is the value of international compatibility of mea- surement language? What is the value of the inter- national compatibility of certain industrial prac- tice? What are the penalties of being dual- customary and metric-for a certain period of time? And what are the potential advantages of conversion ? The United States metric study attempted to address these and related issues. The first thing we did was expose the alternative courses of action that might be evaluated. Before coming down to two courses of action that might be seriously considered, we rejected two "out-of- hand." One is the possibility of reversing the world and persuading other people to adopt the customary system. I think I can prove by ther- modynamic argument that the United States will eventually be metric. The argument is that most nations have converted from their customary system to metric in the last one hundred years; none have converted the other way. So it is only a matter of time that transition will occur here as well. The second thing we rejected of out-of-</page><page sequence="6">VOL. 116, NO. 4, 1972] MIETRIC SYSTEM'[ IN THE UNITED STATES 299 hand is the practical possibility of a craslh con- version program. Thus we homed in on two alternatives. The first is laisseZ faire, a perfectly sound principle and indeed the one that should be recommended in the absence of contrary evidence. The United States follows n1o overall plan; everyone does their thinig. We do( not set a target date for being metric and the governmenit does nothing either to impede or to foster the change, but allows indivi(luals and companies to make their own decision. That is of course what we are doing now. And we are seeing a steady, perceptible, not yet dramatic, acceleration in the introduction of metric language ilnto the country. The second alternative is a planned program of metric con- version based on anl overall national program with a target for becoming predominantly but not ex- clusively metric. Within this framework, seg- ments of the society would work out their own timetables and programs, dovetailing them with the programs of other segments. Such a plan would involve voluntary conversion; voluntary in the sense that it is not driven by any legislative or mandatory requirement, involuntary of course to the extent that if a consensus of the cotunitry decides to go that way then the com- mercial pressures to participate will be great for the minority of those who choose not to. They would be privileged to choose not; but it would become inconvenient for them. What did we discover in our study? First, we found that there is a surprisingly strong consensus. I single out manufacturers because they are the most affected; the stuidy shows that a preponder- ance of mantufactturers, nearly 70 per cent, favor accelerated use of the metric system in the United States. There is a tendency for the larger companies to favor this movement over the smaller ones. We also asked 5,000 manufacturers what approach should be taken to conversion. Some 93 per cent of the respondents said that, if we are going to use the metric system, a planned approach wotldI be preferred over laissez faire. While we did not define what we meant by mandatory and volunitary, there was a quite stronig sentiment for man(latory change, whatever that moans. I took that to mean that if there is a plan it had better be workedI out and understood; that everybody "plays ball" or a lot of confusion will result. We found that the general public does not know much about the metric system (fig. 3). We rode "piggyback" oIn a very sophisticated Institute i t . . . . . . . .

Presumably they know little or nothing about it. Twelve per cent know a lot about it. The correlation of ttat understanding with education is impressive, Of thspee Who know nothing about the metric system almost all (82 per cent) have less than a high school education. Thohe who have a college degree know a great deal about the metric system. Attitudes reveal that those who have never heard of it do not like it, and those who know a lot about it like it. That is not true of everything. People know a lot about taxes and they do not like them. It is also impressive that among those who know nothinlg about it, 16 per cent would be happy to change to it ! There is obviously an educational job to do, especially when one considers that the school children starting first grade this year will be thirty-five years oldl in the year 200}0 and will have approximately half of their adult lives ahead of them. We obviously must do something-whether we speed conversion or not-to prepare people in school for the use of this measurement lan- guage.</page><page sequence="7">300 LEWIS M. BRANSCOMB [PROC. AMER. PHIL. SOC. Thus far I have only dealt with the software problem. Industry wants to know: What do you change when you go metric in the way of hard- ware? How do you tell a metric valve when you see one? A valve is designed to perform a func- tion. It is not designed to have any particular measurement attribute except that it must be com- patible with the threads on the pipes used with it. So the real question is, what industrial standards are you going to use ? This introduces a question that took a long time to explore but it is the basis for the argu- ment: Why go metric in the next decade? There are only about 2,500 international stand- ards that have been adopted by the International Electrotechnical Commission and the International Standards Organization (non-government bodies) in which sixty-five countries participate at a private sector level to develop international in- dustrial standards. A modern nation needs about 20,000 to 30,000 standards. We live on our national standards. We do not depend on the handful of international standards. But inter- national activity is increasing exponentially. In the next ten years 10,000 international standards will probably be recommended. If we allow the Europeans to use the International Standards Organization as their vehicle for eliminating the non-tariff barriers within the European market, if we let them write their industrial technology into what will be a package of 10,000 to 20,000 metric industrial standards, then the process of going metric later means to convert to European industrial practice. If, instead, we get in there in the next ten years and get our technology written into those international standards, the Europeans will have to change to our technology as often as we to theirs. The question, then, will not be the cost of going metric. The question will be the cost of becoming compatible internationally. It is for this reason that we put great emphasis in the United States metric study on more effective participation of American industry in the inter- national standards process. And it is for that reason that Secretary Stans, before the study was finished, introduced to Congress the voluntary International Standards Cooperative Act of 1971 which would permit the government to assist the private sector in that objective.</page></plain_text>
