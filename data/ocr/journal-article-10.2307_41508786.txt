Bueno Received: 23 February 2010 /Accepted: 4 December 2010 /Published online: 16 December 2010 © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2010 Abstract Abiotic factors often are the most impor- tant factors influencing a species' distribution. Nev- ertheless, when investigating the underlying causes of a species' distribution, it is important to assess both the abiotic and the anthropogenic factors (land-use variables) that might have influenced the species' distribution. That is especially true in the Mediterra- nean Basin, where natural ecosystems have under- gone significant changes in response to anthropogenic pressures in the region. In this study, we examined the effects of abiotic and anthropogenic factors on the distribution of Quercus faginea in the Spanish Central Pyrenees. Information on the presence- absence of Q. faginea , and abiotic and anthropogenic variables, were derived using GIS based on digital maps and aerial photographs. To identify and quan- tify the factors that have affected significantly the spatial distribution of Q. faginea , we used Bayesian Model Averaging and hierarchical partitioning. In the Spanish Central Pyrenees, on a broad scale, abiotic variables; i.e. climate and lithology, were the factors that had the greatest effect on the spatial distribution of Q. faginea ; however, recently introduced pine plantations and previous livestock pressure have had a negative effect on the distribution of Q. faginea in the region. Keywords Species distribution models (SDM) • Explanatory models • Bayesian model averaging • Hierarchical partitioning • Land-use variables Introduction An understanding of the factors that influence the distribution of a species is important because it enables us to estimate the drivers of a species' distribution within a region. To model the relation- ship between a species and its environment, ecolo- gists often use empirically based statistical models (e.g., Coudun et al. 2006; Segurado and Araújo 2004; Thuiller et al. 2004). Statistical models of species distributions (i.e., presence-absence of species) quantify the relationships between the dependent variable and a set of explanatory variables such as temperature, slope, and elevation. These models can be used as (1) explanatory: to make inferences about which variables are important in controlling the distribution of the focal species, i.e., examine the underlying causes of a species' distribution by examining the statistical significance of an explana- tory variable influence on dependent variable or (2) predictive models: to estimate the spatial distribution Y.

But, in many cases, these models are used only to predict the potential distribution area of a species (i.e. as predictive models), while the under- lying causes tend to be a secondary consideration. Consequently, few modeling studies have addressed those causes (e.g., Graham et al. 2004; Nally 2000). Usually, the spatial distributions of terrestrial species are studied in the context of abiotic variables only, i.e., climate (e.g. Araújo and Pearson 2005), climate and topography (e.g. Raxworthy et al. 2007), climate and soil conditions (e.g. Coudun et al. 2006), and climate and lithology (e.g. Gaston et al. 2009). These abiotic variables are postulated to be the most important factors influencing the distribution of a species. However, human land use (e.g., agricultural and livestock activities and reforestations) may affect the distribution of plant species (Randin et al. 2009; Dirnböck et al. 2003) or communities (Fischer 1990). In the Mediterranean Basin, one of the world's biodiversity hotspots (Myers et al. 2000), human activities have contributed significantly to the frag- mentation of natural communities and the loss of species (Maltez-Mouro et al. 2009). For instance, plantations recently introduced in mountainous areas of Spain have replaced the native forests with faster growing species (Perry 1998), which has led to a reduction in the amount of area occupied by species and landscape diversity (Lasanta et al. 2009). Con- sequently, it is imperative to include anthropogenic factors when investigating the underlying causes of a species' distribution. Quercus faginea was the subject of this study because it is sensitive to abiotic and anthropogenic factors. It is a winter-deciduous tree that usually does not exceed high-shrub stature because of anthropo- genic disturbances or environmental limitations (Maltez-Mouro et al. 2009). In many mesic forests in Mediterranean environments, Q. faginea is an important structural component of native plant com- munities because it provides habitat for a wide diversity of plant and animal communities and, therefore, is of great interest for ecosystem conser- vation (Rey Benayas et al. 2005). Despite its interest and its importance in rural populations as a source of several resources (e.g., timber and acorns), this species has been relatively little studied. The objective of this study was to quantify the effects of abiotic and anthropogenic factors on the distribution of Q. faginea forests in the Spanish Central Pyrenees. Methods Study area and species The study was conducted in the Spanish Central Pyrenees between 42.47N and 42.14N, and between 0.32W and 0.1 0E (Fig. 1), an area that encompasses a wide elevation range (500-3000 m a.s.1.). The 4394- km2 area included about 325 villages and had clear rural character. In the area, the climate is quite variable, with oceanic characteristics in the western portion and a Mediterranean influence in the eastern- most portion (Lasanta 2002). Mean annual rainfall is &gt;800 mm year-1 at the lowest elevations and, above 1500 m, annual precipitation is &gt;1500 mm year-1 (Vicente-Serrano et al. 2004). Throughout the area, intra-annual variability is very high, and the rainy season extends from October to June. At the lowest elevations, mean annual temperature varies between 9 and 1 1°C and, at the highest elevations (&gt;1500 m), it is 6°C. The relief of the study area occurs in three parallel bands that have a NW-SE orientation (Vicente-Serrano et al. 2004); specifically, they are Fig. 1 Up right corner map shows the location of the study area within Spain.

The landscape is a mosaic of natural and semi-natural forests, shrublands, grasslands, agricul- tural fields, and urban areas. In the Central Pyrenees, Q. faginea is one of the most abundant tree species and it occurs naturally, it is not artificially reforested. The communities in which it occurs form a transition between conifer- sclerophyllous forests of Q. ilex and Pinus halepensis and high mountain forests of P. sylvestris , P. nigra, Fagus sylvatica , and Abies alba (Jiménez et al. 1998; Loidi and Herrera 1990). The ease with which Q. faginea hybridizes with congeners, e,g, Q. pubes- cens , has led to numerous hybridogenic populations within the study area, which has made it difficult to identify individuals (Himrane et al. 2004; Loidi and Herrera 1990); therefore, we treated those hybrids (mainly Q. subpyrenaica) within Q. faginea species. Distribution of Quercus faginea A distribution map of Q. faginea in the Spanish Central Pyrenees was derived from the Third Spanish National Forest Inventory map (IFN3) (MMA 2007). In the IFN3 map, the three principal tree species were considered for each patch and classified as either the first-, second-, or third-most dominant tree species based on an visual estimate in the field of the proportional coverage of each species in the patch. All patches, in which Q. faginea was among the three most dominant species, were used to create the distribution map of this species within the study area. Overall, the contribution of Q. faginea to patches varied from 20% (in the patches where Q. faginea was the third most dominant species) to 90% (in the patches where it was the most dominant species). The distribution map was imported into a GIS for further processing, including correcting the edges of patches and the removal for each patch of the areas where Q . faginea was absent. This process was done by visual inspection of ortho-rectified, 0.5-m-resolution aerial photographs (1:30 000) from the Spanish National Plan of Aerial Orthophotographs (IGN 2006). The accuracy of the final map (96%) was quantified by sampling 200 random points and calculating confusion matrices (Congalton 1991). Data sampling was based on 20-m2 grid layers that included all of the dependent and independent variables, from within which 2000 pixels were chosen randomly (among them 900 records of Q. faginea occurrences) using the ArcGIS extension, Hawth's Analysis Tools 3.27. A distance of 400 m was used as a minimum threshold in selecting sampling (see "Statistical analysis", below), which prevented spatial-autocorrelation in the data (Legen- dre 1993). To avoid non-representative sampling, each patch (polygon) of Q. faginea was represented by a minimum of five records of occurrence. Abiotic data The explanatory variables were chosen based on previous studies (Austin 2007; Guisan and Zimmermann 2000; Purves et al. 2007) and the approach we used relies on the combination of abiotic variables that might have a direct or indirect influence on Q. faginea (Corcuera et al. 2004; Lansac et al. 1994; Mediavilla and Escudero 2004) and anthropogenic variables that reflect the anthropogenic disturbances. Following Coudun et al. (2006), we selected abiotic variables that have an influence on (1) biophysical processes (elevation, slope, terrain curvature, and lithology), (2) frost conditions (number of frost days per year and mean monthly minimum temperature), (3) drought (water balance and mean monthly maxi- mum temperature), (4) primary production (insola- tion). We expected that most of the Q. faginea would occur at 500-900 m a.s.l., in areas that had a sizable positive water balance, and moderate temperatures. The topographic variables, elevation (m a.s.1.), slope (degrees), terrain curvature (concavity/convex- ity), and insolation (Wh/m2) were derived from a Digital Elevation Model of Aragon (CITA 2009) at a 20-m resolution using ArcGIS 9.2 (ESRI 2006). The data for climatic variables, obtained from the Climatic Atlas of Aragon (DMA 2007) at 100-m resolution, were averaged over the period 1971-2000 and included water balance (mm), number of frost days per year, and mean monthly maximum and minimum temperatures (°C). The elaboration process of the climatic maps was based on the combination of local and global methods of interpolation. Topo- graphic (latitude, longitude and insolation) and geographic variables (distance to rivers and Canta- brian Sea,) were used as independent variables to Springer</page><page sequence="4">1002 Plant Ecol (201 1) 212:999-1007 explain the spatial variability in the climatic factors. The following equation was used to predict the values of the climatic variable in areas without information: z(*) = b0 + b'P' + b2Pi H h bnPn where z is the predicted value at point x ,b0,..., bn are the coefficients of the regression, and P', . . . , Pn are the values of the set of independent variables at point x. Measures of water balance were obtained by subtracting potential évapotranspiration estimated using the Hargreaves equation (Hargreaves 1975) from mean annual precipitation. The climatic maps were downscaled from the original grid (100-m2) to a 20-m2 using nearest-neighborhood interpolation. The lithological map was derived from the geological map of Aragon (CITA 2007) and included two classes: flysch-limestones rocks and other types of rock. Anthropogenic data (land-use variables) In our study, we assessed several land-use variables that might have influenced the spatial distribution of Q. fag ine a, which included the distance to the nearest village, an index of exposure to human activities near villages (i.e., in the study area the villages are located in the valley bottoms or in flat areas near croplands, which allows them to be a good indicators of human activities), and to determine whether Q. faginea was influenced by the wood harvesting associated with mining, the distance to the nearest mine was quan- tified. In addition, to assess the extent to which livestock activities affected the distribution of Q. faginea , we included the explanatory variables: cost distance to pastures and cost distance to livestock roads (see below). Extensive reforestation with pine plantations in the area within the last 50 years might have influenced the distribution of Q. faginea ; therefore, the distance to the nearest pine plantation was included in the analyses. We expected that Q. faginea would be more common away from villages, mines, pastures, livestock roads, and pine plantations. A map of the villages was derived from a map of the settlements in Aragon (CHE 2009) and a map of the mines in the area was derived from a map of the CORINE Land Cover 2000 5th Level Project (IGN 2002). Raster layers were created based on the Euclidean distances to the nearest village and mine within each pixel. The cost distance to pastures and cost distance to livestock roads were calculated based on a map of the CORINE Land Cover 2000 5th Level Project (IGN 2002) and a livestock road map of Aragon (DMA 2010), respectively. The cost-distance function calculates the least accumulative cost for moving from the source pixel (in this case, pasture or livestock road) to each of the other pixels using slope as a cost layer. Up to a slope of 35°, cost distance significantly positively correlated with slope; beyond that steepness, areas are effectively inaccessible (maximum cost) to livestock and men. To identify a variable that best reflected the effect of pine planta- tions on Q. faginea forests, we created a map of the pine plantations (P. sylvestris and P. nigra) in the study area based on the Third Spanish National Forest Inventory map (IFN3; MM A 2007) and calculated the Euclidean distance to the nearest plantation for each pixel using ArcGIS 9.2 (ESRI 2006). Statistical analysis First, collinearity was checked in the potential predictor variables using the Pearson's correlation coefficient. Water balance was highly positively correlated with elevation (r^son = 0.89) and highly negatively associated with mean monthly minimum temperature (Гре^оп = -0.88) and mean monthly maximum temperature (r^son = -0.87). From the four variables, only water balance was retained, because (1) it was highly correlated with the response variable compared to the other three variables, and (2) the three drooped variables were reflected well by water balance (Mp^on &gt; 0.87). Contrary to the four variables, the other predictor variables were weakly correlated (for all other variables Irlpe^n &lt; 0.35). The final set of potential explanatory variables included lithology, slope, terrain curvature, water balance, insolation, number of frost days per year, distance to the nearest plantation, distance to the nearest village, distance to the nearest mine, cost distance to livestock roads, and cost distance to pastures. Spatial autocorrelation was evaluated in the Q. faginea distribution map (pixels of 20-m2) using the row-standardized Moran' s I Test (Cliff and Ord 1973). Spatial autocorrelation decreased monotoni- cally above a lag of 15 map pixels (~300 m); therefore, 400 m was used as the minimum threshold in selecting sampling (Millington et al. 2007). Springer</page><page sequence="5">Plant Ecol (201 1) 212:999-1007 1003 To model the responses of Q. faginea to abiotic and anthropogenic factors, we used Bayesian model averaging (Madigan and Raftery 1994), which incor- porates model selection and parameter estimation uncertainties into inference and prediction (Hoeting et al. 1999; Raftery et al. 1997) and produces more accurate predictions than methods that select a single best model (Thomson et al. 2007; Wintle et al. 2003). We used the function "bic.glm" in the "BMA" package (Raftery et al. 2009) in R (R Development Core Team 2009), which performs Bayesian averag- ing model (BMA) for GLM (binomial error distribu- tion and a logit link function). The function uses the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to compare models, and a "leaps and bounds" algorithm to identify the most probable models (Raftery et al. 1997; Thomson et al. 2007). In BMA, the posterior probability that a variable has a non-zero coefficient in the predictor model Pr (/?vs. # 0) is used as a measure of the influence of that variable on the response. Explanatory variables that had high values of Pr (j?vs. # 0) contributed most to the final model and those that had low values of Pr (/?vs. # 0) were included in least probable models, only (Nally et al. 2008; Thomson et al. 2007). Explanatory variables that had values of Pr (j?vs. # 0) &gt; 0.75 were identi- fied as "key factors," (Nally et al. 2008; Viallefont et al. 2001). More than one key factor was identified in our analysis; therefore, to determine relative importance of each key factor, we used Hierarchical Partitioning (HP) in the "hier.part" package in R (Walsh and Nally 2008). HP estimated the "independent" con- tribution of each "key factor" to the total variance explained by the model (Chevan and Sutherland 1991; Nally et al. 2008). Log-likelihood goodness of fit measure was used. A logistic model was most appropriate because the dependent variable was binary (presence or absence). Note that hierarchical partitioning, as currently implemented in the "hier.- part" package, assumes a monotonie relationship between the dependent and the explanatory variables (Luoto et al. 2006). To assess the nature of the relationship between the dependent variable and each one of the key factors (i.e., linear or non linear) we used univariate generalized additive models (univar- iate GAMs); the smoothed function was plotted for each univariate GAM. The linear and quadratic terms were used in the HP analysis for those key factors that showed a non linear relationship with the dependent variable. Results "Key factors" influencing the distribution of Quercus faginea Bayesian averaging model (BMA) identified the factors that had the most effect on the distribution of Q. faginea in the Spanish Central Pyrenees. Among the 1 1 explanatory variables included in the model, the following six were identified as key factors: three abiotic variables (lithology, slope, and water balance) and three anthropogenic variables (cost distance to pastures, cost distance to livestock roads, and distance to nearest plantation). BMA suggested that insolation, terrain curvature, number of frost days per year, distance to the nearest village, and distance to the nearest mine did not have a statistically significant effect on the distribution of Q. faginea in the region [Pr (/?vs. ф 0) &lt; 0.25]. All of the key factors had a high probability of being included in the final model [Pr (ßvs. Ф 0) &gt; 0.94], which reflected their strong rela- tionship with the occurrence of Q. faginea. Water balance and cost distance to the livestock roads were negatively correlated with the occurrence of Q. faginea because the posterior means (PM -h SD) of the coefficients associated with each variable were negative (Table 1), i.e., the probability of occurrence of Q. faginea increased with a decrease in the water balance, and in accessible areas from livestock roads. Slope, lithology, distance to the nearest plantation, and cost distance to pastures had a positive effect on the likelihood that Q. faginea was present (Table 1), which indicated that the probability that Q. faginea was present increased with an increase in the slope (the cross tabulation between slope and the Q. faginea distribution maps indicated that almost all (&gt;90%) of the areas occupied by Q. faginea had a slope between 5° and 30°. This result indicated also that the probability that Q. faginea was present was higher in lithological zones that were formed by flysch-limestone rocks than it was in other zones. The probability of occurrence increased with an increase in the distance to the nearest plantation, and cost distance to pastures, which indicated that Q. faginea Springer</page><page sequence="6">1004 Plant Ecol (201 1) 212:999-1007 Table 1 Bayesian averaging model (BMA) and hierarchical partitioning (HP) used for identifying the key factors (variables with Pr (ßvs. # 0) &gt; 0-75, bold) that affect the distribution of Q. faginea over the Spanish Central Pyrenees Variables BMA HP (%) Pr (ßn.

Independent explained variance HP analysis (Table 1) suggested that the abiotic factors explained &gt;67% of the total independent variance, which reflects the importance of those factors on the distribution of Q. faginea. Water balance (33.66%), lithology (17.43%), and slope (16.00%) made the greatest independent contribu- tions. Anthropogenic factors explained about 33% of the total independent variance, with distance to the nearest plantation (14.70%) and cost distance to pastures (10.10%) making the greatest contribution. Those two variables had a negative effect on the probability of Q. faginea presence. Cost distance to livestock had a lowest contribution (08.09%) to the total independent explained variance. Discussion Effects of abiotic factors In large part, abiotic factors, particularly climate, lithology and slope, explained the spatial distribution of Q. faginea in the Spanish Central Pyrenees; precipitation and soil water recharge can have a significant effect on the establishment of Q. faginea plants (Corcuera et al. 2004), and a high soil water recharge favors the growth of Q. faginea (Corcuera et al. 2004). Our study indicated that water balance and the occurrence of Q. faginea were negatively correlated because of a particularity of the Central Pyrenees, where water balance increases with an increase in elevation and where temperatures are very low values in winter. Water balance was strongly correlated with elevation and mean monthly mini- mum temperatures (see "Statistical analysis" sec- tion). The cross tabulation between elevation and Q. faginea distribution maps indicated that, in the Central Pyrenees, all of the areas occupied by this species were between 450 m and 1500 m a.s.l. The species does not occur above 1500 m because freezing temperatures hinder the establishment and growth of seedlings. As in our study, Sánchez de Dios et al. (2006) found that Q. faginea forests on the Iberian Peninsula were associated with continental areas that have low precipitation. The phenology of Q. faginea is similar to that of species that produce roots that can access deep water reserves (Castro and Montserrat 1998). In the Central Pyrenees, the probability of Q. faginea occurrence was high in areas that were characterized lithologically by flysch- Springer</page><page sequence="7">Plant Ecol (201 1) 212:999-1007 1005 limestone rocks and were rich in calcium carbonate, which generates calcareous soils that are suited to the establishment and growth of this species (Ceballos and Torre 1979; Jiménez et al. 1998). In addition, the results showed that the probability of Q. faginea occurrence increases with a raise in slope values; the cross tabulation between slope and the Q. faginea distribution maps revealed that Q. faginea occupied areas that had a slope between 5° and 30°. In the Central Pyrenees those areas were mainly occupied by croplands, grasslands, and abandoned fields. Particu- larly, in grasslands and abandoned fields the high radiation and low water availability during summer, and herbaceous plants competition (i.e. herbaceous plants are strong competitor for resources, particularly water) limit the establishment of Q. faginea seedling (Rey Benayas et al. 2005), and therefore, prevent this species from spreading in those areas. Effects of anthropogenic factors In the Central Pyrenees, anthropogenic factors appear to have played a secondary role in influencing the spatial distribution of Q. faginea , acting to restrain the expansion of this species. In particular, livestock grazing and introduced plantations have affected negatively the distribution of Q. faginea in the region. Elsewhere, the probability that Q. faginea was present was lowest in areas near pine plantations, which indicates that native forests can be severely affected by introduced species, particularly those that are fast growing and have strong dispersal abilities (Teixido et al. 2010). In the Central Pyrenees Q. faginea forests were extensively deforested to increase the amount of croplands and pastures (Lasanta 1989), but latter reforested with pine plantations (Amo et al. 2007). Currently, these plantations occupy areas that were previously cov- ered by Q. faginea forests. In addition, the introduced species are characterized as fast growing and have dispersal ability, which allows them to be great competitors to Q. faginea , i.e., creating a competition that prevents Q. faginea from spreading in those plantations. This study showed that Q. faginea was less likely to occur in areas close to pastures that were accessible to livestock. In areas that experience livestock overgrazing, the regeneration of tree pop- ulations is practically impossible (Barbero et al. 1990). Livestock eliminates seedlings, which diminishes recruitment and, consequently, hinders species regeneration (Cierjacks and Hensen 2004). In some areas of the Central Pyrenees, Q. faginea forests were used in a "dehesas" system (Barbero et al. 1990; Montserrat 1990), i.e., a silvo-pastoral system that had sparse Q. faginea and perennial grass layers. In these particular ecosystems, the high grazing pressure increases the acorns consumption and creates abiotic conditions unfavorable for seedling establishment (Pulido and Diaz 2005; Plieninger 2006) which hamper the regeneration of Q. faginea and therefore lead to its disappearance from those sites. Between 1200 and 1500 m a.s.l., Q. faginea forests were harvested and summer livestock pastures were created (Lasanta et al. 2005). Conversely, Q. faginea seemed to be favored in accessible areas from livestock roads, which is probably a consequence of silvicultural practices (thinning, pruning) used by the forestry service alongside the livestock roads, which helped to maintain the health of Q. faginea stands near livestock roads. BMA suggested that distance to the nearest village did not affect the likelihood of Q. faginea occurrence, which means that the spatial distribution of this species was not directly affected by the human activities, concentrated around villages, probably because of the important decrease in the anthropo- genic pressure on the territory (e.g. the abandonment of agricultural fields) as consequence of human exodus that occurred in the region during the second half of the twentieth century. Conclusions This study has demonstrated that abiotic variables operating on a broad scale, e.g., lithology and climate were the main factors influencing the distribution of Q. faginea in the Spanish Central Pyrenees, and anthropogenic factors, particularly the recent addition of plantations and previous livestock pressure, affected negatively the distribution of Q. faginea in the study area. Much attention has been focused on the role of abiotic variables as main factors influencing the distributions of terrestrial tree species; however, our study showed that anthropomorphic changes in land use can affect the distribution of tree species, espe- cially in the Mediterranean region, where natural ecosystems underwent substantial modifications caused by changes in the anthropomorphic use of land.
