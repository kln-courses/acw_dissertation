Dorn** *Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory, Columbia University **Department of Geography, Arizona State University orrelating the timing of events that oc- C curred in different places, though a difficult problem in geographic re- search, is important for understanding the de- velopment of human and physical landscapes. This paper focuses on the evolution of natural arid landscapes and prehistoric human activity in drylands over timescales of 1 03 to 1 05 years. Our approach examines the dark rock coatings called rock varnish that are ubiquitous in arid and semiarid areas (Dorn and Oberlander 1982) and attempts to determine whether lay- ers of rock varnish can serve as a natural GIS (geographic information system). Is it possible, in other words, to map these unique layering patterns for the purpose of establishing tempo- ral correlations? Orange and black microlaminations in rock varnish were first recognized by Perry and Adams (1978) as miniature sedimentary strata with the potential to record environmental change. As we point out below, orange layers record arid climates, while black layers form in humid settings. We verified Perry and Adams' findings that the black layers are rich in man- ganese, the orange layers are rich in iron (but not manganese), and layering can be laterally continuous. Subsequently eschewing spatial analysis of these optical sedimentary se- quences, investigators turned to microchemi- cal measurements of Mn and Fe along depth profiles using either wavelength dispersive electron microprobes (Dorn 1990; 1994c; Dragovich 1988a; 1988b) or energy dispersive X-ray units attached to electron microscopes (Reneau et al. 1992). Although electron micro- scopes provide increased resolution of chem- istry in these transects, this approach was analogous to restricting analyses of an entire Landsat/SPOT scene to the data from one row or a soil catena in a road cut to samples along one tape measure. If varnish layers are to be used as a tool for understanding environmental change, it is nec- essary to move beyond one-dimensional per- spectives. To do so requires that we realize the potential of visual m icrolam inations. Hereto- fore, these microlaminations have not been as- sessed principally because of the practical difficulty in making sections that are thin enough (&lt;5-10 gim) to see through the var- nish, which in normal thin sections is opaque. Using conventional section preparation tech- niques, our failure rates exceeded 80 percent, and even then sections were often too thick to see details. Recently, however, the senior author has developed a method of making ul- tra-thin sections that reduces failure rates to less than 5 percent and permits more rapid sample preparation (Liu 1994). Unlike electron microscope methods of analyzing varnish, op- tical layering has the advantage of accessibility; samples can be prepared with materials pur- chased at hardware stores and observed with relatively inexpensive light microscopes. Our research assesses the reproducibility of patterns in the optical layers of rock varnish and the usefulness of these layers in geo- graphic research. This paper presents our findings on the spatial comparability of visual microlaminations in rock varnishes. It also ap- plies this experimental tool to understand spa- tial variabilities in environmental change. With this tool, we may be able to correlate the en- vironmental history of different places exposed at the earth's surface and thereby assist stu- dents of prehistory, for example, in placing rock engravings in an established cultural se- Annals of the Association of American Geographers, 86(2), 1996, pp. 187-21 2 ?1 996 by Association of American Geographers Published by Blackwell Publishers, 238 Main Street, Cambridge, MA 02142, and 108 Cowley Road, Oxford, OX4 IJF, UK.</page><page sequence="2">188 Liu and Dorn quence, or students of geomorphology in cor- relating alluvial fans, glacial moraines, and other landforms having disjunct locations. Death Valley serves as our main study area. Following a discussion of methods and results, we present the pattern of varnish layering in the Death Valley region, an analysis of the method's uncertainties, and an exploration of its utility for mapping alluvial fans and other cases. We conclude that while this method is still experimental, it seems to have consider- able potential for addressing a fundamental problem in geographic research, namely the temporal correlation of different physical and anthropogenic surfaces. Study Area and Methods The Death Valley area offers an excellent test case for dating rock varnishes. The area's arid- ity aids varnish preservation and surfaces of known and variable age are in close proximity. Our evaluation of m icrolam inations involves comparisons of varnish samples from sites where age control (in the form of radiometric dates) exists and from a large number of un- dated sites. These samples are then used to note the recurrence of layering patterns on single boulders, on adjacent boulders, on dis- tant boulders on the same geomorphic surface (e.g., transects from the distal to the proximal end of an alluvial-fan unit), and on boulders on landforms of different ages. Sampling sites with independent age control exist within Death Valley and adjacent areas in the western Basin and Range (Figure 1). Age control is based on: independent 14C data on the genesis of the landform on which the var- nish has grown; uranium-series measurements of tufa on shorelines of paleolakes; cosmo- genic 3He, 10Be, and 26Al ages; and 14C ages on subvarnish organic matter that record when the time sequence started (Table 1). Figure 2a maps the study area of Death Valley and Fig- ure 2b illustrates, for one alluvial fan, the den- sity of sampling sites that were used to assess the reproducibility of the layering pattern in the 320 km2 area of southern Death Valley. The most critical and perhaps the most con- troversial aspect of this paper concerns rock varnish sampling in the field. There are two schools of thought on how to maximize the chances of collecting the oldest varnish: 1) col- lection based on visual appearance (cf. Har- Calibration Sites 120?

While both schools agree that the objective is to sample the oldest var- nish, i.e., the varnish most closely related to the exposure of the underlying rock by a geo- morphic or archaeological event, they adopt different strategies to achieve that objective.1 Since different sampling criteria will result in the collection of different types of varnishes and very different types of data, we will return to this issue momentarily. In all, we prepared 420 ultra-thin sections (each with multiple micro-sedimentary basins) from 360 subaerially exposed rocks. Each sec- tion contains several rock-surface depressions where varnish collects, and some 2900 de- pressions or "microbasins" were analyzed for this study. The different lithologies collected are indicated in figure captions. A simple innovation in preparation of ultra- thin sections made this research feasible.

The preparation pro- ceeds as follows. First, a varnished rock chip is placed in epoxy and a polished cross-section of varnish is made on side 1. Then, the section is placed again in epoxy, and the sample is ground down on side 2. Lastly, the varnish is polished on side 2 until it is thin enough for layering to be visible with light microscope. The key to sample survival in the final thinning is in binding epoxy to epoxy, rather than bind- ing dissimilar materials (epoxy on glass)-an ap- proach used in prior studies (Dorn 1992; Pe- terson et al. 1995).

We also completed wavelength dispersive (WDS) electron microprobe transects in order to test the conclusion that orange layers are Mn-poor and black layers are Mn-rich (Perry and Adams 1978). Quantitative chemical data were obtained by WDS with a fully-automated JEOL JXZ-8600 electron microprobe. Although overlaps are a problem with energy dispersive analyses (such as the Mn-Kp peak resting on the Fe-Ku peak), this problem is resolved by WDS. The probe was set to 10 nA with a counting time of 30 seconds for a focused beam with a diameter of ~-2gm. Results Our most basic finding (Figures 3 and 4) confirms earlier conclusions that color corre- sponds with manganese abundance in laminae (Perry and Adams 1978). Orange/yellow (Fe- rich) layers are not as enriched in manganese as are the black layers. We also found that Fe-rich varnish has more clay minerals as reflected in higher totals of [AI+Si]. This is con- sistent with analyses using infrared mineralogy (Potter and Rossman 1977; 1979) and scanning electron microscopy (Dorn 1986). An important observation (Figures 4, 5 and 6) is that the surface layer is universally or- ange/yellow (Mn-poor). This applies to all sam- ples of subaerial rock varnishes examined from</page><page sequence="5">Rock Varnish Laminations 191 Chemistry of Laminations Mn:Fe Ratio 0 2 4 0 2 4 0 2 4 0 1 2 3 4 5 0 2 4 0 2 4 0 1 2 3 4 5 0 2 4 0 u n rik b with specific black l YD H r- b 20.

In contrast, black (Mn-rich) sur- face layers occur only on subaerial varnishes in humid regions (Figure 7a-c) and non-subaerial varnishes in arid regions (Figure 7d-e). Underneath this first orange/yellow layer are complex patterns of black and orange micro- laminae. It is our aim to assess the reproduci- bility of these patterns. Our first test focuses on microlaminations developed on rocks at sites with numerical age control (Table 1). The ages in Table 1 provide a maximum age for the on- set of the varnish laminae at each site. Se- quences were reproducible from place to place on a single boulder and from boulder-to- boulder on these dated landforms. Figure 4 presents an illustrative section from each con- trol site, while Figure 5 presents a "stacked" generalization of the sequence, with basal age control indicated on the side. After examining the patterns at control sites, we examined those sites which did not have independent age control for the presence of a reproducible relative sequence of layering in varnish at sites throughout Death Valley (Fig- ure 6). After examining the 2900 or so se- quences, a pattern became apparent. Figure 8 generalizes our identification of the "layering units" that are repeated from site to site in the Death Valley area. These layering units are dis- tinctive stratigraphic patterns. In some cases a layering consists of a distinctive single strata, e.g., the yellow/orange of Unit 1. In other cases, the layering units form multiple layers, e.g., thin black layers separated by a thin or- ange layer in Unit 2. Figure 8 provides readers with a guide to the layering units that they would see when viewing a section in a light microscope. Our assignment of ages to layering units is based on data in Table 1. While the ages in Table 1 are state-of-the-art, we realize that our calibration will be refined as dating methods improve. Our calibration thus should be re- garded as a first approximation. Unit 1 devel- oped during the last -10,000 14C yr B.P; the two black layers in Unit 2 at -10,000-11,000 14C yr B.P. and -14,000 14C yr B.P.; the promi- nent orange layer in Unit 3 between 15,000 and 20,000 14C yr B.P.; the first black layer in Unit 4 at -21,000 14C yr B.P.; and the second black layer in Unit 4 before -24,000 14C yr B.P. The timing of black layers in Unit 4 (older than -24,000 14C yr B.P.) is not constrained by radiocarbon dating because the 14C ages are infinite for sections o and p (Figure 5; Table 1). The basic pattern of 5 black layers in Unit 4 is repeated in samples throughout Death Valley (Figure 6) where Unit 4 is constrained to be younger than the relatively thick yellow layer underlying it, called here Unit 5.

YD and H1-H6 indicate pos- sible correspondences between black layers and the Younger Dryas (YD) and Heinrich Events Hi through H6. Radiocarbon ages are placed stratigraphically un- derneath the layering sequence for that varnish. For example, the radiocarbon age for AC-8 (I in Table 1 ) is 18,340?1 80 and the bottom layer is Unit 3, hence chronometric placement occurs in Unit 3 in the ide- alized sequence. tom four black layers in Unit 4 probably date from between -24,000 14C yr B.P. and - 70,000 yr B.P. And Unit 5 probably dates from be- tween -70,000 and 130,000 yr B.P. (based on uranium-series ages, Table 1, for the high stand of Pleistocene Lake Manly; Hooke and Dorn 1992; also Ku et al. 1994). Units 6, 7, and 8 have no age control except for a single cosmo- genic 10Be/26A1 age at -318,000 years (Table 1 ) on a surface on Galena Canyon Fan (Nishi- izumi et al. 1993). Interpretation of Layering Units and Environmental Conditions We interpret orange/yellow (Mn-poor, clay- rich) layers as indicative of a dry climate and black (Mn-rich) layers to indicate a wetter cli- mate. Our interpretation is based on both em- pirical data and theory. Empirically, the orange/yellow (Mn-poor) uppermost layer formed during the Holocene (Table 1; Figure 4) in areas that have been arid for the last 10,000 years (Benson et al. 1990; Spaulding 1985; Wells and Woodcock 1985). In arid climates, Mn-poor varnish is universally found at the top of the sequence of varnish layers on landforms older than Holocene (Fig- ures 4 and 6). Moreover, varnish that is pres- ently forming in more moist areas is Mn-rich (Dorn 1990) and black (Figure 7a-c). The assignment of orange to arid and black to humid is also consistent with what is known about climatic changes in the western United States for the last 24,000 14C years (Figure 4 and Table 1). The orange/yellow layer, Unit 1, formed in the last 10,000 14C years when the western United States has been quite arid (COHMAP 1988). As for the three black layers that formed between 10,000 14C yr B.P. and 24,000 14C yr B.P., the top black layer is Unit 2 corresponds in time with a wet pulse about 10,000-11,000 14C yr B.P. (Benson et al. 1992; Elliott-Fisk 1987; Gosse et al. 1995b); the sec- ond black layer in Unit 2 corresponds in time with a wet pulse about 14,000 14C yr B.P. (Ben- son et al. 1990); the distinctive orange layer of Unit 3 may correlate with a period of warming in the western United States near the end of Pleistocene (Cerling et al. 1994) when glaciers were retreating from their maximum positions (Dorn et al. 1990; Zreda and Phillips 1994; Zreda et al. 1994); and the uppermost black layer in Unit 4 (third black layer) corresponds to the last glacial maximum about 20-21,000 14C yr B.P. (Bach and Elliott-Fisk 1995; Dorn et al. 1991; Gosse et al. 1995a; Phillips et al. 1990). From the standpoint of theory, our interpre- tation of layers focuses on factors that control manganese enhancement in rock varnish. The two extant models of manganese enhance- ment-the abiotic and the biotic-relate changes in Mn concentration to fluctuations in pH. The abiotic model of manganese enhance- ment (Hooke et al. 1969; Moore and Elvidge</page><page sequence="8">194 Liu and Dorn Increasing Complexity with Age Epoxy aY b nt EpoxY C __,=_S, J _ ~~~~~~~~~~~Epoxy Unit 1 . 1 Unit 2 (top layer) Unit 1 Rock Unit 2 (top layer) Epoxy CdEpoxy Unit 1 Unit 1 Unit 2Ui Unit3 3nit 3 Rock Rock Ut E yUnit 2 Unit 2iUnit 3 Unit1 3 _ - j Unit- Unit 3 - _i_ Unit i Unit 44 I Unit64 (3lyers Rock~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Rc Unit 1 h Epoxy Unit 2~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Ui Unit 4 Unit 4 Unit 5 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Unit 2 Uniti j~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Ui Unit 34ni Unit 4~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Ui Unit 6 Unit 5.....- Unit 6 Unit 7 Unit 7 Unit 8?

Under the redox constraints of the abiotic model, an environ- ment that is too alkaline retards the reduction of Mn(IV) from source material (dust); hence varnish formed during arid-alkaline periods of high pH are poor in Mn. The biotic models of Mn-enhancement in varnish (Drake et al. 1993; Dorn and Oberlander 1981; Jones 1991; Krumbein and Jens 1981; Nagy et al. 1991; Pal- mer et al. 1985) posit that bacteria and perhaps other organisms result in the bioaccumulation of Mn. Note however that experimental data on cultured Mn-bacteria indicate that pH val- ues higher than 7.5 inhibit Mn bioaccumulation (Bromfield and David 1976; Dorn and Ober- lander 1981; Schweisfurth et al. 1980; Uren and Leeper 1978; van Veen 1972). Jones's (1991:127) working model of biomin- eralization in rock varnish combines aspects of the abiotic and biotic models: During wetter times eolian clay minerals spend more time in contact with dew and fog, thus in- creasing the amount of Mn put into solution. At the same time, wetter soils, increased plant cover, and flooded playa lakes decrease the total amount of alkaline eolian material settling on varnish sur- faces. Less alkaline surface conditions favor Mn precipitating bacteria . . . thus allowing them to take full advantage of the increased levels of dis- Figure 6.

Varnish layers display the same stratigraphic sequence as in Figure 5, but from sites without numerical age con- trol. This figure depicts just a few of the &gt;2000 micro- basins examined within a 320 km2 area in Death Val- ley. On Holocene varnishes, only the yellow/orange layer is found. A basal black layer occurs in varnishes on terminal Pleistocene landforms (a, b). Unit 2 (two black layers) occurs between Unit 1 (Holocene) and Unit 3 (relatively thicker orange layer) (c, d). The number of tightly-layered black bands in Unit 4 depends upon sample age (e, f). Unit 4 is underlain by Unit 5, a yellow layer that is optically similar to the Holocene (g, h).

A reduction in circulation of eolian clays may also reduce the amount of clay minerals incorporated into the var- nish, thus reducing the amount of Fe in the varnish as well. High Mn production and precipitation plus less Fe incorporation yields a higher Mn:Fe ratio. Conversely, drier conditions reduce the contact time between clay minerals and varnishing solu- tions, inhibit Mn-precipitating bacteria through in- creased deposition of alkaline eolian materials, and increase the amount of Fe-bearing eolian clay min- erals incorporated into varnish. A low Mn:Fe ratio results. In summary, biotic and abiotic mechanisms of Mn-enhancement seem to have been "turned off" or "reduced" in deserts during the Holo- cene, which is supported by empirical obser- vations of Mn-poor varnishes formed in the arid western United States during the last 10,000 years. Analysis of Uncertainties While the foregoing data and interpretations suggest the methodological potential of layer- ing in rock varnish, the method is not yet a "mature" research tool. Significant uncertainties remain. Continuity in Layering One set of complications arise in the exami- nation of ultra-thin cross sections (Figure 9): Section Thickness. Layering disappears alto- gether in sections that are ground too thin (Figure 9a). Conversely, when the section is too thick, black layers merge optically (Fig- ure 91). Erosional Unconformities. Rock varnish is soft, having a Moh's hardness of &lt;4-1/2 (Dorn and Oberlander 1982). Abrasion thus can remove layers, which is easiest to see when the unconformity is angular. In Figure 9b, for example, the orange layer of Unit 3 rests on an abrasion surface that truncates the un- derlying layers. Conversely, abrasion is sometimes conformal as in Figure 9g. In this case, the double black layer of Unit 2 pre- sent in the middle of the section is "shaved" down to only one black layer on the sides. The complete erosion of Unit 2, not uncom- mon in Death Valley (Figure 9h), hints at widespread aeolian abrasion event(s) in the early part of the Holocene. These disconti- nuities in optical varnish layers also occur at</page><page sequence="10">196 Liu and Dorn Importance of MicroEnvironment S - e A__~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~4 N-. A.. -Fci, ... .A.

Under wetter conditions in arid lands, capillary water flow through the var- nish leaches Mn, Fe and other cations (Krin- sley et al. 1990). Areas of leaching often ex- ist as pockets that interrupt varnish layering (Figures 9c, 9d, and 9f). In wetter regions, however, entire varnishes can display evi- dence of leaching-and thus varnish layer- ing cannot be used in these circumstances. Facies Changes. These changes occur when depositional rates vary laterally. Our exam- ples in Figures 9i, 9j, and 9k all come from the same thin section. Note how Unit 3 var- ies in thickness, and subdivisions of the two black bands in Unit 2 can be seen in Fig- ure 9k. Variable Sedimentation Rates. When sedimen- tation rates are too slow (&lt;-0.5 jim/ka), some layers may not occur. In contrast, when rates of sedimentation are extremely fast, the continuity of the layering may be interrupted by the development of botryoi- dal growth forms-diagnostic of varnish growth in wetter conditions (Dorn 1986), e.g., in Figure 4f where black varnish tends to grow in columns making a wavy bound- ary with Unit 1. Rates of varnish accretion at this site are -15 gm/ka. Spalling of Weathering Rind. Rapid spalling of the rock by fire (Dragovich 1994), for ex- ample, resets the varnish clock. Although</page><page sequence="13">Rock Varnish Laminations 199 Figure 9m and 9n are from the same boul- der, the latter displays a less complete re- cord because of rock spalling at the place where the sample was collected. Sampling Non-subaerial Varnishes. The layer- ing sequence described above occurs only in varnishes formed in a subaerial environ- ment. There are, however, many other types of varnishes (Dorn 1994b; 1994d; Engel and Sharp 1958), e.g., "crack var- nishes" starting to form in a rock crevice and later exposed by spalling (Figures 7e, 7f, and 9e). The difficulties in interpretation occur in about half of the microbasins that we have studied. In about ten percent of these cases, problems prevent identification of a layering sequence. On the other hand, in most of the sections complications are limited in area to a rock-surface depression or a portion of a de- pression. Ninety percent of the time, it is still possible to identify varnish layering patterns. A Local or Regional Signal? A second set of complications has to do with the general issue of local or regional controls on a paleoenvironmental record. Similar prob- lems arise when mapping vegetation change through pollen or macrofossils, profiling ice- volume changes with oxygen isotopes in dif- ferent marine cores, or mapping soils. One side in the debate over local or regional controls on the chemistry of varnish layers is represented by researchers at Los Alamos Na- tional Laboratory. They stress the lack of con- sistency in Mn-concentration in the surface layers of varnishes chemically profiled in the Cima Volcanic Field in the Mojave Desert (Fig- ure 1). Reneau et al. (1992:719) suggest "that local conditions on the varnish surface play a larger role in determining the composition of accreting varnish than regional climatic fluctu- ations." The other side of the debate is based on our analyses of data from the same field area (Fig- ure 1). The presence in -2900 microbasins of a surface-orange layer that is Mn-poor (e.g., Figures 3-6, 8, and 9) contradicts the Los Alamos findings. Our explanation of this em- pirical contradiction is that the two sides in the debate have used different sampling criteria and these have resulted in the collection of different types of samples2 (See Dorn 1994b; 1 994d for further discussion on different types of varnishes). When we collected samples that did not develop in a subaerial environment, we replicated the Los Alamos results and we also failed to obtain a consistent signal. In these cases of varnish formation (Figure 7e-7h), local influences appear to be a dominant factor: Crack Varnish. When a rock crevice opens wide enough to permit the influx of clay micelles and solutes, an orange crack var- nish may grow (Tricart and Cailleaux 1964). As the crevice opens further and clays are washed from the walls, a black crack var- nish grows on top of the orange varnish-as seen in samples from sites where we forced open the rock crevices (Figure 7e) or where natural spalls exposed the walls of rock crevices (Figure 7f). Ground-Line Band (GLB). Processes that move cobbles in desert pavements (e.g., up- thrusting, overland flow, flotation on aeolian dust, and net soil erosion) (Mabbutt 1979) can move GLB varnish originally formed at the air-soil-rock interface (Engel and Sharp 1958) into a subaerial position. Varnish on a cobble that started out in a GLB position but is now 2 cm above the current soil surface provides an unclear Mn signal (Figure 7g). Small Cobbles. When a desert pavement clast (8cm x 5cm x 2cm) was exposed by the manufacturing of a sleeping circle in the Si- erra Pinacate, northern Mexico (Hayden 1976), a black subaerial varnish developed within a few centimeters of the soil surface. In cross-section, however, it presents an in- consistent pattern of Mn-enhancement (Fig- ure 7h). All of our subaerial samples display, in con- trast, an overwhelmingly clear signal. These varnishes were collected from the tops of boul- ders where they would be most sensitive to a regional signal of eolian fallout.3 Subaerial var- nishes collected from western U.S. deserts have a surface layer that is poor in manganese and orange/yellow in color (Figures 3-6, 8, 9). Those surface layers with high manganese concentrations in subaerial rock varnishes are correlated with lower soil pH, lower varnish pH, and a positive water balance (Dorn 1990). Manganese in currently forming varnishes is more plentiful, for example, in wetter regions with coniferous forests (Figure 7c) than in drier areas with desert scrub vegetation (Figure 7d). We emphasize that such a clear signal could</page><page sequence="14">200 Liu and Dorn not occur if "local" influences were dominant on subaerial varnishes. Our study is limited to the western United States, hence our findings may not necessarily apply to other regions because varnish layering patterns vary with different paleoenvironmen- tal histories. Orange (Mn-poor) surfaces are found in varnishes on the flanks of the Tien Shan in western China and on glacial moraines in Patagonia, and a low-manganese signal is also found in the hyper-arid Peruvian coastal desert (Jones 1991) and the Sahara (Haberland 1975; White 1990). Yet in the drylands of Aus- tralia, the surface layer can be comparatively enriched in Mn (Dragovich 1988b; Nobbs and Dorn 1993). Manganese-rich varnishes mean- while are found in wetter areas, e.g., Iceland (Douglas 1987) and the European Alps (H6ller- man 1963). Case Studies and Implications Varnish microlaminations will never have the high temporal resolution of such techniques as tree rings or coral. This is because varnish lay- ers form at variable rates in response to envi- ronmental changes. Nor can current analyses of varnish layers provide the type of internal age controls that are available in analyses of marine or lacustrine cores. Additional analytical and methodological refinements will be re- quired before varnish microlaminations can move beyond the stage of an experimental method. Perhaps the key problem involves in- ternal age controls for specific layers-a prob- lem on which we are working. While these shortcomings limit our ability to make defini- tive environmental assertions, we believe that optical microlaminations provide a means for correlating surfaces at a level of resolution heretofore unavailable. Mapping Alluvial Fans in Death Valley Geomorphologists have used many different approaches to the mapping and correlation of alluvial-fan deposits, for example, morphostra- tigraphy (Hooke 1972), remote sensing (White 1993), and weathering and soils (Bull 1991). Although various properties of rock varnish have been used in alluvial-fan research (Dorn 1994a; Hooke and Dorn 1992), the technique of microlaminations may offer more precise correlations than previous approaches. In our remapping of alluvial-fan units in Death Valley using varnish microlamination patterns, we assume that alluvial-fan surfaces are correlated if the varnish microlamination stratigraphy has the same basal unit, that is, in the longest layering sequences. The layering unit at the bottom of the varnish thus approxi- mates most closely the time of alluviation. Of course, the basal unit provides a minimum-lim- iting time signal because varnishing must fol- low deposition of a fan unit. It is also important to remember that the temporal resolution of varnish layers is on the order of thousands of years. Figures 1 Oa and 1 Ob present our mapping of fans debauching respectively from Galena Canyon (Figure 2) and Six Springs Canyon in Death Valley (Figure 2). In describing the gen- eral characteristics of these fans, the term lay- ering unit (LU) denotes both the basal micro- lamination and the geomorphic unit on which this microbed is in the basal bed: Fan Unit LU-1. LU-1, the youngest fan surface, is located mainly at the toes of the fans and adjacent to the active channel in fan-head trenches. Some LU-1's consist of deposits abandoned so recently that only brown or orange varnish has formed; black patchy varnish (which is orange/yellow in thin sec- tion) is barely visible to the naked eye. Fan Unit LU-2. LU-2's typically consist of de- posits with a rough bouldery bar-and-swale topography. On the mapped fans, these units often constitute inset deposits next to the trunk stream channels. Millimeter-scale patches of dark varnishes grow on boul- ders-but again, the uppermost varnish layer is always yellow/orange in thin section. Fan Unit LU-3. Most of LU-3 surfaces are re- worked from older fan units. Some LU-3 surfaces have developed a smooth desert pavement. More often, the pavement has not completely smoothed out and original depositional bar-and-swale features can still be seen. Black varnish has spread more evenly over the surface boulders. Fan Unit LU-4. LU-4 surfaces have the best-de- veloped desert pavements, and to the na- ked eye very well developed varnishes. In- cipient drainage systems have started to develop on these surfaces. Soil develop- ment is restricted to cambic, argillic, and</page><page sequence="15">Rock Varnish Laminations 201 calcic horizons; no petrocalcic horizon can be observed beneath the pavements. Fan Unit LU-5. LU-5 surfaces are characterized by well-varnished desert pavements. Well- developed petrocalcic horizons (stage-4) can be observed beneath the pavements where they are undercut by active fluvial incision. Varnishes appear dark on boulders, but cobbles are often too weathered to pre- serve a dark varnish. Fan Units LU-6 and LU-7. LU-6 and LU-7 sur- faces are characterized by dissected desert pavements. Beneath the pavements there are well-developed petrocalcic horizons; some calcrete rubble (representing erosion of overlying soil horizons) has been incor- porated into the pavements. Although ero- sion of the pavement occurs, varnishes with LU-6 and LU-7 layering sequences can be found on boulders that have retained their fluvially-rounded surfaces. In the field, LU-7 fan surfaces are differentiated from LU-6 surfaces by two features: well-varnished larger boulders are far less frequent on LU-7 than on LU-6, and LU-6 surfaces are often inset into LU-7. Fan Unit LU-8. LU-8 surfaces are topographi- cally well above any of the younger fan units. They are characterized by ridge-and- ravine (ballena) topography. Most of the surface deposits consist of rubble from the erosion of the petrocalcic soil horizons be- neath the original fan surfaces. Well-devel- oped varnishes can be seen only where iso- lated patches of flat desert pavement remain. Fan surfaces of ?LU-8 are the oldest observable Quaternary deposits in Death Valley. They are most commonly located in fan-head embayments and tucked up against bedrock outcrops. Varnishes older than LU-8 could not be sampled on these surfaces because the boulders on them re- tain no original (abraded) surfaces. Although a full examination of the geomor- phic implications of these findings is beyond the scope of this paper, this case study sug- gests the method's utility for correlating the relative age of geomorphic units and its poten- tial for assigning correlative ages to the layering sequence. Finally, we note that alluvial-fans elsewhere in the southwestern U.S. have sur- faces with different degrees of varnish devel- opment (Bull 1991), and these too may be mappable with varnish microlaminae. Connection with Heinrich Events? There is growing evidence that global cli- mate in the last ice age changed suddenly and dramatically to the unsteady beat of Heinrich Events-those "armadas" of icebergs released episodically from the Laurentide ice sheet into the northern Atlantic (Bond et al. 1993; Broecker 1994). The most recent Heinrich Event correlates with the Younger Dryas (Keig- win and Lehman 1994), a globally synchronous cold snap thought to have occurred about 10,500 14C yr B.P. (Denton and Hendy 1994; Hodell et al. 1991; Kudrass et al. 1991; Wright 1989). Heinrich Events H1 through H6 from -14,000 to -65,000 years ago (Bond et al. 1993; Broecker 1994) are correlated with dis- tinctive characteristics of Greenland ice cores (Bond et al. 1993), Florida pollen cores (Watts and Hansen 1994), French lake deposits (Thouveny et al. 1994), New Zealand glacial advances (Denton and Hendy 1994), and pos- sibly with glacial advances in western North America (Clark and Bartlein 1995; Gosse et al. 1995a; 1995b). These correlations suggest a link between the iceberg armadas and sudden changes in global climate (Birchfield et al. 1 994; Broecker 1994). Much to our surprise, we discovered that varnish microlaminations in Death Valley grossly corresponded with the sequence and timing of Heinrich Events (Figures 5, 6, and 11). The two black layers in Unit 2 seem to corre- late with the Younger Dryas and H1 (Broecker 1994). The next black layer (uppermost in var- nish Unit 4) occurs at -21,000 14C years ago, the age of Heinrich Event H2 (Broecker 1994). The correlation of the next four black layers in Unit 4 with H3-H6 is more speculative, how- ever, because our chronology is not sufficiently precise at the present time (Figure 5). An im- portant point is that the ubiquitous distribution of rock varnish in drylands makes them poten- tial tools for evaluating general hypotheses about the "global extent" (Broecker 1994:421) of sudden climatic changes, e.g., by mapping the distribution of wet periods in desert areas.

Black layers are enriched in Mn, and the orange/red layers are Mn-poor; the different appearances of the Mn poor layers is due to different effects of the polarizer. The assignment of the annotated layering units is tentative and is based on the sequence in Figure 5. In the western U.S., older 14C ages correspond with more complex layering patterns.

The time-scale of laminae formation is too coarse for use on recent arti- facts, Holocene petroglyphs for example, be- cause the orange/yellow surface layer is diag- nostic of the last 10,000 years; see Figure 1 2a. However, older varnishes with their distinctive layering patterns may permit the dating of older worked stone (see Figures 12b and 12c). Paleoearthquakes The determination of future seismic hazards is dependent on information about the timing of past earthquakes. Microlaminations can aid in constraining the timing of past earthquakes in arid regions where age control is frequently lacking because organic remains are typically oxidized. To illustrate this potential, samples were collected from surfaces above, on, and below fault scarps at the base of Hanaupah fan (Figures 2a and 13). If the stratigraphy in Ta- ble 1 and Figure 5 are used, varnish layering sequences suggest the occurrence of a major faulting event just after 11,000 to 14,000 14C yr B.P. (upper black layer in Unit 2) and a minor faulting event sometime after 10,000 14C yr B.P. (Unit 1). Implications for Other Varnish Methods Varnish thickness cannot be used as a dating tool. As Figure 4 illustrates, rates of varnish ac- cretion vary greatly. Microbasins with only Unit 1 can be thicker than microbasins with a much more complex layering pattern. The wetting that fosters faster varnish growth also enhances decay of the underlying rock, which eventually spalls and resets the varnish clock. Slower- growing varnishes have greatest potential for longer-term survival because they exist in the most xeric sites. Quartzite, which provides the longest varnish sequences in Death Valley, ap- pears to be the most stable substrate. That said, even the most stable boulder surfaces are sub- ject eventually to spalling. In the case of Death Valley, we have not found a distinct layering unit more complicated than Unit 8 (Figure 6 and 8)-probably about 300,000 years old (Table 1). Our data also reveal that, contrary to a recent study in the Mojave Desert (Reneau 1993), nei- ther bulk manganese abundance nor thickness can be used successfully as a tool to date the subaerial exposure of rock surfaces. The mass of manganese per unit surface area depends upon the abundance and thickness of black layers. Varnishes of the same age with thicker black layers will have more Mn than varnishes with thinner black layers. Implications for Landscape Stability If even a micron of the underlying rock erodes, the varnish is lost. Some boulder sur- faces do not survive long (Figures 9m and 9n), but these easily-eroded boulders may rest next to boulders that have experienced no erosion by fluvial, aeolian, or slope processes for 1 04 to 105 years (Figure 5). Boulder erosion cannot, therefore, be treated as a constant-a result that should not be surprising to those who have seen glacial polish on bedrock that pre- dates the last-glacial maxima (Dorn et al. 1991; Nishiizumi et al. 1993) or Pleistocene paintings in European caves (Valladas et al. 1992). Our observations on varnish stability are consistent with a maximum uranium-series (non-iso- chron) age of ?300,000 yr B.P. on rock varnish (Knauss and Ku 1980). Doubtless our finding that boulders can re- main stable for tens to hundreds of thousands of years will be resisted by scholars who model landform development on the assumption that boulder erosion can be treated as a constant (Hallet and Putkonen 1994). However mathe- matically inconvenient, boulder erosion is not a linear process; it tends to occurs in slabs and at irregular time intervals. Our results imply that only those boulders that remain stable for a long period are useful as tools for dating glacial moraines with cosmogenic nuclides (Brook et al. 1993; Phillips et al. 1990; Zreda and Phil- lips 1994; Gosse et al. 1995a, 1995b). Accord- ingly, the process of selecting the most stable boulders for cosmogenic nuclide sampling would be aided by the study of varnish micro- laminations. Conclusion We are approaching the bicentennial of scholarly research on manganese-iron coatings on rocks.

Of the fourteen methods for analyzing the time signals within rock varnish devised thus far (Dorn 1994d), we believe that the method of visual microlaminae has the most potential for widespread use because: first, "a picture is worth a thousand words," especially when thousands of rock depressions replicate a pat- tern; second, material costs are minimal; third, the manufacturing of ultra-thin sections (Perry and Adams 1978; Dorn 1992) has become efficient and reliable (Liu 1994); fourth, con- ventional transmitted light microscopes are readily available; and fifth, sampling is not difficult once investigators realize that, like any sample collected for dating, "not all samples are alike" and in the case of varnish the "best looking" is not necessarily the best for dating purposes.4 Collection requires a rock hammer, an understanding of different types of rock var- nish (Dorn 1994d; Liu 1994), and an apprecia- tion of the field relationships of surface textures and geomorphic or archaeological processes of interest. If, for example, an investigator is interested in the age of an alluvial-fan unit, flu- vially abraded cobbles should be collected- not smooth planar surfaces that are charac- teristic of joints exposed by spalling. The method has a further advantage in that it is a "conservative" technique. First, the var- nish layering pattern always provides a mini- mum time signal for the exposure of the un- derlying rock because aeolian abrasion, lacus- trine action, spalling of weathering rinds or along joints, and biochemical erosion all "reset" the varnish clock. Second, even without pre- cise temporal "calibrations" (Figure 5 and Ta- ble 1), the technique can be used to correlate the relative ages of surfaces. And once calibra- tions are established, the technique has the potential to be used to assign correlated-ages. While we do not know if it is possible to es- tablish calibrations outside of the Death Valley region, continuous optical microlaminations in varnishes are evident throughout the drylands of the western U.S. as well as in Antarctica, the Kunlun Mountains, Negev Desert, Patagonia, the Sinai Peninsula, South Australia, southern Peru and the Tien Shan Mountains. Our optimism for optical microlaminations as a chronometric tool is tempered, however, by the realization that this method is still in the experimental stage. Yet, we remain confident that this approach will yield precise and accu- rate age-determinations and low-cost correla- tions of non-contiguous surfaces in drylands. A potentially powerful record of place-specific and long-term environmental change thus lies literally beneath our feet. Acknowledgments We thank A. Bach, W. Broecker, P. Beyer, J. Clark, R. LeB.

The visual school of varnish collection, promoted mostly by varnish researchers at Los Alamos Na- tional Laboratory, is best summarized in their pa- pers. [O]ur sampling protocol, based on the assumption that clasts most closely representing the exposure age of a surface are those with the most developed (oldest) varnish (Harrington and Whitney 1987; Whitney and Harrington 1994). To maximize the probability of selecting the oldest clasts on a surface we originally collected -20 clasts from a deposit or surface and then culled them to the best 8 to 10 clasts, based on the macroscopic quality of each varnish coat . . . (Harrington and Whitney 1995:168-169) . . .relative darkness may be the best field criteria for relative age. (Reneau et al. 1992:687) Sample collection at each site involved repeated traverses across the surface, selecting clasts whose varnish appeared exceptionally dark or continuous when compared with other clasts on the same sur- face. These clasts were then culled by roughly half, those with less-developed varnish being rejected, thereby resulting in sample collections of 21 to 49 clasts from each sample site.... Typically, the best varnish on each geomorphic surface of the Soda Mountains piedmont occurs 1-2 cm above the soil surface on relatively small clasts having intermediate axes generally less than 10 cm. (Reneau 1993:311) The notion that appearance is equivalent to age is intuitively appealing, but appearance is influenced by many factors other than age, e.g., varnish</page><page sequence="23">Rock Varnish Laminations 209 chemistry, lithology, the underlying weathering rind, patterns of water flow over surfaces, other rock coatings, epilithic organisms, surface rough- ness, soil proximity, and, most importantly, the type of rock varnish (cf. Dorn 1994b; 1994d). We agree that darker varnishes are the oldest, but only when time is the only variable. We tried to collect only varnishes that have re- mained exposed to the atmosphere. We collected rounded cobbles, because these had the highest likelihood of relating to the geomorphic event (e.g., flooding, wave abrasion) of interest. Salt- weathering and other types of rock weathering tend to shatter rocks along angular planes of weak- ness, both in the subsurface and at the surface. Varnishes were collected from the tops of boul- ders because these have been exposed only to airborne fallout. We purposely avoided the "best looking" varnishes, because these start in un- opened rock fractures and at ground lines on de- sert pavement cobbles (Dorn 1994b; 1994d). These positions allow rapid and thick cementation of clays to rock surfaces-all the while avoiding exposure to the acidity of rainfall and rock-surface organisms. Varnishes formed in rock crevices and too close to the ground surface are influenced by local microenvironmental changes-not a regional climatic signal. In contrast, truly subaerial positions are exposed to alternating conditions of dust deposition, precipitation, and organic acids. In es- sence, exposure to the elements means that subaerial varnishes do not look the darkest, but they do provide the records reported here. Dis- cussion and tables detailing sampling criteria are presented elsewhere (Dorn 1994b; Dorn 1994d; Liu 1994). 2-4. See note 1. References Bach, A., and Elliott-Fisk, D. L. 1995.

Annals of the Association of American Geographers 86(2):187-212. Abstract. A fundamental problem in the analysis of landforms and surface artifacts is how to correlate the ages of non-contiguous surfaces. One solution to this problem may lie within the varnish coatings on desert rocks. When viewed with a light microscope in ultra-thin cross-sections, rock varnish reveals orange and black layers that record drier and wetter climates, respectively. Consistent patterns of alternating orange and black microlaminae are evident in some 2900 rock-surface depressions in 420 ultra thin sections from 360 rocks in Death Valley and the surrounding region. Microlaminae are organized into distinct layering units that provide relative ages for geomorphic and archaeological surfaces. The largest uncertainty in developing calibrated chronologies for layering units is the inability to date specific layers; we resolve this problem by correlating layering units with independent numerical ages. Because rock varnishes are ubiquitous in de- serts, their visual microlaminations have great potential as a tool to assess temporal and spatial variations in dryland environments. This potential is illustrated for alluvial-fan deposits in Death Valley, petroglyphs, and fault scarps. One of the most surprising, if speculative, findings is that the ages of black laminations (wetter periods) in Death Valley coincide with the timings of iceberg armadas in the North Atlantic (Heinrich Events). Key Words: alluvial fans, climatic change, Death Valley, deserts, drylands, environmental change, faulting, geomorphology, Heinrich Events, petroglyphs, rock varnish.
