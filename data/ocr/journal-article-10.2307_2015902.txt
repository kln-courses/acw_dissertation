Multiple and various are the ailments that have been claimed for our world. Today, in an age of specialized science and technology, it is the fashion to regard reason and the machine, these dual constitu-</page><page sequence="2">156 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY ents of modern culture, as the forces making for man's downfall. Ever since Nietzsche issued his pungent indictment of certain fea- tures of modernism, questions pertaining to the "crisis" of Western man and culture have been constantly in the foreground. The World War, in particular, has given a strong impetus to the discussions in Germany, especially among non-academic circles. Of these, Lessing's Europa und Asien is perhaps the most passionate and eloquent statement. Asia is the symbol of man's innocent origin, of his creative dream- world. It stands for the unrestraint and boundlessness of the soul, for reliance on the instinctive and intuitive; it implies the certainty and harmony of spontaneous activity; it is the temper that engenders a generous social polity. Asia represents nature and instinct. Europe is the symbol of man awakened to consciousness, reflec- tion, and purposeful activity; of man selecting, judging, and evalu- ating; of his incessant willing and desiring. It prepares the soil of an unsocial attitude. It makes for restraint, limitation, calculation. Europe represents culture and reason. (Lessing uses Geist loosely to denote the collective symbol). The history of the earth reveals the gradual domination of Europe over Asia, that is: the victory of logic over life, of consciousness over instinct, of egocentricism over socialism. So long as man lived in nature's embrace, he was simple and certain, and his life then pos- sessed " fulness. " Consciousness and a rationalizing spirit, however, have since impoverished it. Consciousness has split the primeval unity of man, making him uncertain and wavering. Logic and sci- ence with their tendency toward the general have brought about the atrophy of the living content, the essence of which is the unique and the particular. With the birth of consciousness and thinking began thus the downfall of the earth. And with the advent of Christianity, there developed another disastrous conceit: anthropomorphism, by which nature and history were dressed up in a teleological garment that was man-cut. This philosophy of history introduced a series of unwarranted pretentions to the effect that man had the power to forecast the course of events and that these could be grasped in terms of time. Europe furthermore brought ethics, that is, evaluations based on selections that were necessarily arbitrary, norms in terms of which the innocence of nature was condemned and its infinite bounty found wanting. Thus have consciousness, thought, and hom- inism alienated man from nature, made of him a sceptical, artificial, and self-centred being. Culture, far from attaching itself to life, has become autonomous to the extent that it is now the antithesis of life. The most hideous form that this process has assumed is to be</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 157 found in mechanized America, "a sleepless land without nightin. gales, inhabited by loud people without music, hopelessly mediocre and soul-barren." Here the machine (latest aspect of Geist) has most effectively chilled the soul of man. The primary function of our machine-culture generally, has been the destruction of Pan. It has been demolishing forests, exterminating land- and water-animals, inciting wars for the control of the world's markets, fostering the unscrupulous exploitation of the proletariat classes. To be sure, there is an effort on the part of the scattered Asiatic remnants to halt the crushing onward tramp of this cold automaton; but it is in vain. Asia too is going the way of Europe. The machine is march- ing on and soon we shall also have in Asia the victory of the pale man's burden, of Sunyatsen over Laotse. This thesis is more sweepingly condemnatory than was Spengler's cyclical pessimism. Though sharing Lessing's anathema of reflective consciousness and reason, Spengler did not include culture in his castigation of what he called "civilization." For Lessing, both are cursed with the same leprous disease: rationalizing and purpose- giving to life. Spengler's theory, furthermore, did not exclude the possibility of a new and vital culture arising from the debris of Western civilization. For Lessing, the year 1900 marks the begin- ning of a process in the course of which historical humanity is doomed to extinction. Now history knows of no pessimistic philosophy that does not point the way to some escape out of the dreary situation it portrays. And Lessing's is no exception. The tacit and acknowledged assumption throughout the work is that there exists a sharp diremption between nature and reason. The last chapter suddenly announces that this either-or dichotomy is methodologically unsound-the finest insight in the book. Human existence necessarily entailed the transcendence of the natural state. As human beings, we are perforce citizens of both Europe and Asia, and our tragedy consists more precisely in that we are at home in neither. Now this homeless dualism can not be bridged by a " return to nature." We must continue on the road that leads away from her warm green fields on to the cold icy peaks of reason. But in this very process, Lessing believes, salvation can be found. Through con- tinued intellectualization, the heart of nature will be further chilled, and since reason must have nature as material to flourish on, the high point of reason's triumph will be also the moment of its complete extinction. The labor of this Nirvana-salvation thus involves con- tinued and active participation in and promulgation of the cultural and intellectual life. (Echo of von Hartmann's cheering exhorta- tion: man must cultivate such activities which will assure his ultimate</page><page sequence="4">158 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY annihilation.) A new race must come (uill come, since life is bound to assert itself) that no longer performing the act of thinking will manage to survive. That race may find it necessary to ignore the truth. The power to live probably requires the power to self-decep- tion. Well, so be it! This book, too, will then be forgotten, if forgetting it will be more conducive to life than would be the knowl- edge of its message. The human race will be saved from being ship- wrecked on the sharp cliffs of reason by steering into the sleepy harbor of Nirvana. "Our questions are solved. For they shall be forgotten." (The book also contains a brief "exoteric answer": the suggestion of a conciliation between nature and Geist, stated only as a possible logical alternative.) The prophetic manner in which Lessing proclaims his thesis and the ridiculous extremes to which he drives it, makes it tempting to dismiss it briefly. Nor is it difficult to expose the logical flaws of his argument. All of Lessing's dramatic accounts of the unjust distributions and irresponsible squanderings of economic goods do not, as Lessing believes, reveal the baneful effects of culture, but only the workings of the economic principle of surplus-value produc- tion, characteristic of a specific system. Lessing condemns civiliza- tion and culture wholesale, because of a particular and perhaps pass- ing economic form of such, and he confusedly argues that machine- production necessarily makes for worker's exploitation. His central thesis of the self-sufficiency of the natural state is equally untenable. It seems to be contradicted by Lessing's own leading idea that con- sciousness and reason arose because of "need," because of some disturbance within the natural process which reason came to remove. Does not this principle argue against the position that nature can best solve her problems when left to herself? Did not reason arise precisely because nature was not sufficient unto herself ? If the light of the spirit can break only through wounds (p. 36f.), then these wounds could have been inflicted only by nature herself. And if that be so, then Lessing's nature-Nirvana will offer no abiding refuge- ground and after a time, man will again have to take recourse to the scorching medicine of reason. With respect to ethics, selection and evaluation do not imply, as Lessing argues, "rejection of life," but rejection (as well as acceptance) only of a part of life. And this necessity of the spirit of saying "no," of being (in Scheler's term) "an ascetic of life," is a specific and valuable human quality that distinguishes it from an animal's indiscriminate acceptance. At the same time, these logical considerations do not abolish certain facts that provide the inner substance of the current revolt against intel- lectualism. In the heat with which rationalism is defended, it is sometimes forgotten that reason has necessary and serious limitations</page><page sequence="5">BOOK REVIEWS 159 set by its subject-matter. Nature's infinite aspects can not be ex- hausted by rational analysis and can be approximated perhaps only through paradoxes. The elements of indeterminancy and chance of- fer irremovable stumbling-blocks to the powers of reason. And though thinking may be the effect of an intensive act and may stimu- late activity, contemplation by itself can never cope with the problems of living; indeed, it often leads to doubt and uncertainty which paralyze the wings of action and produce our Hamlets. And in the weary moments which the nerve-wearing life of the spirit brings, or in the hubbub of busy hours, the soft song of Asia with its promise of freedom from our compulsive actualities, has allurements that are almost irresistible. But while sub specie aeternitatis there is thus value in not losing sight of the dangers of a life tyrannized by reason, it is on the other hand myopic to ignore (as Lessing does) the great service reason renders in fighting intolerance, superstition, and preju- dice. And the spread of that anti-intellectualism which Lessing, with writers of related temper like Bachofen, Klages, Leopold Ziegler and their motley following are encouraging, is particularly unfortunate. These men do not point to the limitations of reason with a view of guarding its frailty from the animal-robustness of superstition and of assigning reason to its safe and proper sphere. Their irrational- ism rather lends moral support to a reactionary obscurantism that regards logical consistency as sufficient indication of error, to which, as Thomas Mann puts it, the way to the "Mothers" is an affair of a casual walk. The readiness with which philosophies that are tinged with pes- simism are accepted today by many can be well enough understood in the light of a World War and the miseries of a post-war period. But to claim that these maladjustments are the necessary corollaries of a culture nourished by reason and supported by a system of ma- chine-production, is to argue post hoc. The failure to consider that it may have been the misuse of these ingredients of Western culture that has brought about those cataclysms, is the spear-point on which all of these pessimistic criticisms remain hanging. But unfortunately they are not alone philosophically unsound. Such gospels as Lessing's nature-Nirvana or Leopold Ziegler 's "new Middle Ages," held forth as the ideal fulfillment of Western culture, are today practically dangerous: their confused irrationalism and irresponsible mysticism are playing into the sinister hands of the Fascist forces that are making for the racial, social, and economic reaction to which Ger- many, among other countries, is today a prey.
