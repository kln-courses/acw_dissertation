<plain_text><page sequence="1">AN INTRODUCTION TO THE PHENOMENOLOGY OF SIGNS The single words and verbal combinations which make up ordinary dis- course are signs. Hence an adequate theory of signs is required for any truly scientific understanding of language. It is also required for an under- standing of logic and the abstract, technical symbols it employs. All knowledge, in fact, would seem to involve the interpretation of signs and symbols. So far as this is true, epistemology itself would seem to rest fundamentally on a theory of signs. Hence it is no wonder that semantics in the broad sense of this term, once regarded as an important part of logical theory, is once again beginning to arouse serious philosophical attention and that a rather extensive literature on the subject has now accumulated. Because of their more thoroughly philosophical and representative character, we shall select the views of two recent authors for special exam- ination. These views are expressed by C. W. Morris in his Foundations of the Theory of Signs,' and in his book, Signs, Language, and Behavior, and by C. J. Ducasse in two articles, "Symbols, Signs, and Signals,"2 and "Some Comments on C. W. Morris' 'Foundations of the Theory of Signs.' "3 These writers are in sharp disagreement on certain points. After considering special features of each theory, and then points on which they are in substantial agreement, we shall try to use the results of this critical analysis in attempting to formulate a phenomenological theory of signs, i.e., one that is both intelligible and in conformity with the actually given phenomena. MORRIS' THEORY OF SIGNS According to 'Morris' first view ,4 "S is a sign of D for I to the degree that I takes account of D in virtue of the presence of S." For example, a dog (the interpreter) responds with a certain type of behavior I (the interpre- tant) involved in the hunting of chipmunks D (the designatum) to a certain sign S (the sign vehicle). But as Ducasse has pointed out,5 the term "takes 1 International Encyclopoedia of Unified Science, I, University of Chicago Press, 1938. 2 Journal of Symbolic Logic, IV (1939). 3This Journal, III (1942-3), pp. 43 ff. 4Foundations of the Theory of Signs, p. 4.

Morris' Foundations of the Theory of Signs," pp. 44-5. 217</page><page sequence="2">218 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH account of," which Morris uses in a behavioristic sense, is far too vague for specific application to the sign situation. If the term is thus broadened so as to cover not only noetic apprehension but physical behavior as well, Morris' definition will apply to many instances of instrumental causation which certainly are not sign situations. Imagine, for example, three billiard balls, A, B, and C. A and B are at rest and in contact. C then collides with B, and A moves. If the term "takes account of" covers "behavior or motion because of," then this situation will fall under Morris' conception of a semiotic situation. A moves (takes account of) C in virtue of the presence of motion in B. B is then a sign of C for A. This absurd conclusion results from Morris' attempt to omit the noetic factor which is essential to semiosis. A sign is not something physically present, exercising efficient causation. It is something Poetically present, leading the interpreter Poetically to take account of somethig other than itself. In his later book, Morris seems to answer this objection by restricting semiosis to "goal-seeking behavior,"' and by attempting to identify it with the influence of sensory cues on animal action.7 According to this analysis, the sign does not act as a substitute stimulus by setting off a complete response. Thus a man reading a book about Alaska in his inter- pretation need not run through all the overt responses which would be called forth by Alaska itself,8 and the dog conditioned to a buzzer need not actually complete the act of eating the food.9 All that is required for the interpretation of a sign is a disposition or "preparatory response" leading to the attainment of the goal. Hence it is suggested that "if anything, A, is a preparatory-stimulus which in the absence of the stimulus- objects initiating response-sequences of a certain behavior-family causes a disposition in some organism to respond under certain conditions by response-sequences of this behavior-family, then A is a sign."10 Thus "the buzzer is the sign; the dog is the interpreter; the disposition to seek food at a certain place, when caused by the buzzer, is the inter- pretant; food in the place sought, which permits the completion of the re- sponse-sequences to which the dog is disposed, is a denotatum and is denoted by the buzzer; the condition of being an edible object (perhaps of a certain sort) in a given place is the significatum of the buzzer and is what the buzzer signifies."1 This attempt to think of all signs as sensory 6 Signs, Language, and Behavior, pp. 7 and 354, definition of sign.

Two of the most basic of these become evident in the further development of Morris' own analysis. The first is a certain unavoidable vagueness in the notion of the sig- nificatum. Which is signified by the sign, the consummative responses of the organism or something known to exist independently in the world? In the case of genuine signs the answer is clear and unambiguous. Both the sign and the significatum are real, independent entities related together by a certain relation, that of signification. Thus smoke is the sign of fire, a real, existent entity, having nothing to do, as such, with the goals or re- sponses of animals. Of course such responses, like everything else, can be signified. But when this occurs, they are signified as objective existences having nothing to do with the subjective goals of those who may be inter- preting them. The interpretation of signs may or may not have an influence on the conduct of the interpreter, but in neither case is the former to be confused with the latter. The sign, the relation sign of, and the sig- nificatum which terminates this relation are in some sense objects of noetic apprehension, not subjective goal-seeking behavior. Especially is this true of the significatum, which is always an object of knowledge, never some- thing sought for as an end. Thus the symptom signifies the real objective disease, not any consummatory response of the doctor. Mr. Morris adopts "this usage" as a way of speech. According to him, "the buzzer does not signify the dog's disposition to respond but signifies food at a given place and time."12 But it is hard to see any justification for this "usage" in his own theory which states that "the interpretant . . . answers to the behavioral side of the behavior-environment complex; the significatum as the set of terminal conditions under which the response- sequences to which the organism is disposed can be completed, connects with the environmental side of the complex."'3 How then can the significa- tum be separated from the subjective interpretant? Surely the terminus of a response belongs to the response. "Each therefore belongs to the other."'4 On this view, we cannot signify anything which is not a "com- plex" involving our own subjective responses and purposes. But this is palpably false. Smoke does not signify the responses of any animal re- garding it, but fire. Mr. Morris' introduction of the purposive inter- pretant into semiosis involves him in a subjectivism which is implicit in his whole "behavioral theory,"'5 but clearly revealed in his statement 12 Ibid, p. 19. 13 Ibid. p. 18. 14 Ibid. 15P 4</page><page sequence="4">220 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH that "there are no signs which signify without dispositions to respond (that is, without interpretants)."16 Mr. Morris becomes involved in a second major difficulty in his attempt to distinguish behavioristically between the individual designatum and the universal significatum of a sign.17 In his earlier work, Morris states that of the three elements interpretant, sign, and designatum, "all three are necessary."' Such a view is really demanded by any consistent behavior- ism, for no animal can produce a universal act. All behavior is concrete, individual, and directed towards an individual object. Nevertheless most of the intelligible signs of discourse have universal significata. Fur- thermore, there are signs of fictitious entities, such as centaurs and mer- maids, which have no designata at all. Hence even in his earlier treatise, Morris is forced to the opposite conclusion that "obviously every sign does not, in fact, refer to an actual, existent object."'9 We can put this diffi. culty in the form of a dilemma: either a consistent behaviorism (all signs have individual designata) which is inconsistent ivith the universal sig- nifications of ordinary discourse; or the view that certain signs possess universal significations, which is inconsistent with behaviorism. In his recent book, Mr. Morris chooses to defend the latter horn of this dilemma, without, however, giving any explanation of how the individual act or tend- ency to act of an individual organism can become an "interpersonal"universal. A language sign "is producible by organisms and has for these organisms a common signification regardless of which organism produces it. "2O Morris calls such signs comsigns, and refers to the work of George H. Mead in attempting to defend a behavioristic account of their origin and nature. On this view, language arises from the peculiar fact that the sounds of one organism are "heard by that organism as they are heard by other organisms.'?21 Thus one can learn to respond to his own sounds as another. Finally "the sound would then have the same significatum to A and B whether produced by A or B, and so would have become a comsign."22 Unfortunately this conclusion does not follow for, similarity is not equivalent to sameness. No doubt there are many vocal signs given forth by an animal to which he learns to respond as others hearing him. Thus at the warning cry of a herd sentinel, both the sentinel and the others flee. A snarl may call 16 P 19. 17 See especially "The Interpersonality of the Language Sign," pp. 39 if. 18 Foundations of the Theory of Signs, p. 4. 19 Ibid, p. 5. 20 Signs, Language, and Behavior, p. 39. 21 Ibid, p. 39. 22 Ibid, p. 40 (my italics).</page><page sequence="5">PHENOMENOLOGY OF SIGNS 221 forth similar attitudes of belligerence both in the combatant animal and in his opponent. But to assume that such sensory cues have the same meaning for all and to put them on a level with linguistic communication is to indulge in an irresponsible anthropomorphism. For us, the utterance of a moan is a natural sign of pain. For certain animals it may be a cue for responses of assistance or of attack. Such similar, individual responses may fit together in a pattern of cooperative action which may be useful or harmful. They cannot ever give rise to the sharing of a signification which is one and the same for all. The cue of a subjective, individual act cannot be identified with the sign of an objective, universal meaning. In human beings such ejaculations are natural signs of danger, pain, rage, etc., which may be truly or falsely interpreted. As a result of inter- preting such signs, human beings may then perform acts which resemble those of animals in responding to similar sensory cues. But it is arrant anthropomorphism and a false analogy to assume that because animals respond to these sounds as we do, they must, therefore, be interpreting them as signs. Even in man such natural signs as moans must be sharply distinguished from language and vocal signs. Language is not made up of moans and growls and grunts. To understand a groan as a sign of pain is not the same as to understand the word pain. What is the difference then, since each is a sign of pain? The ejaculation is a sign which never frees itself from the concrete situation here before me. It is a natural sign of this pain, here and now, in this particular organism. The word signifies something abstract and free from all particular contingencies. This freedom affects even the sign itself which need not be any particular kind of a sound but may vary indefinitely. The word is an arbitrary sign of the universal pain in general, which is always the same wherever it occurs, and wherever noetically apprehended. The cue to action is not a sign at all. It leads to an activation, not an interpretation, either individual or universal. The natural sign, which leads the mind to an individual designatum is not the linguistic sign of a universal significatum. These distinctions are revealed by an examination of the actual phenomena. They are slurred over by Morris' behavioral analysis which ignores the crucial distinction between similarity of response and sameness of signification. Time after time, Morris identifies the two without explanatory comment. Thus he says "it is because of the fact that similar interpretants are aroused ... that we can say that the sounds uttered have the same signifaction. to both of them."23 This inference simply does not follow. Between two similar, individual responses dif- fering in many respects and two concepts signifying the very same, there is an unbridged chasm. 23 Ibid, p. 41 (my italics); cf. pp. 40, 42, and 44.</page><page sequence="6">222 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH We must conclude that while Morris has doubtless given an adequate description of the tripartite structure of a behavioral cue (cue, act or in- terpretant, and individual object), he has failed to give any adequate ex- planation of the bipartite structure of the semiotic relation (sign- significatum). As he himself points out, "a sign must signify."24 It does not signify some behavioral complex in which a purposive object fuses with subjective responses of the animal, but a noetic object inde- pendent of such responses. Linguistic signs are universal and "inter- personal" not because they are produced by living animals nor because they are attached to similar responses, but because they signify universal concepts and their universal objects. The full explanation of this fact can be given only by a thoroughly developed epistemology, but no theory of signs can be adequate which does not recognize this fact. The inter- pretation of signs may of course affect the behavior of animals capable of pretation. But in itself the interpretation is noetic, not active or be- havioral. A sign is something to be understood, not merely responded to. DUCASSE 'S THEORY OF SIGNS According to Ducasse also, the sign situation necessarily requires an interpreter. The sign relation is not independent of the mind, but essen- tially psychological in character. Without an actual interpreter, there can be no such thing as a sign. "Interpretation is a kind of mental event consisting in this, that consciousness of something causes us to become conscious of something else."25 In this respect, Ducasse differs from Morris only in the greater clarity and consistency with which he clings to this psychologistic position. But as we have noted, this will not allow us to speak in realistic terms of apprehending or discovering sign relations in rerum nature. But surely the footprint of the tiger is a sign of the tiger not in virtue of any psycho- logical imposition, but in virtue of a real extramental relation. Is it not true that smoke is a sign of fire even when no one happens to be interpret- ing it as such? There are also other aspects of M\Ir. Ducasse's theory which seem open to question. For example, he says that a sign proper begets an opinion or leads us to assert a proposition, whereas a symbol merely leads the mind to think of something else without asserting any proposition. This conception of a sign seems dubious. If a sign is something causing us to believe in a certain proposition, we shall be forced to classify the persuasive rhetoric 24 Ibid, p. 18. 215 "S Symbols, Signs, and Signals," p. 42.</page><page sequence="7">PHENOMENOLOGY OF SIGNS 223 of an orator which causes us to believe in a certain opinion as the sign of that opinion. Thus the German propaganda of 1942-3 which convinced many Germans that their country was winning the war will have to be classified as a sign that Germany was winning the war. Is this correct? Furthermore if that which begets or causes an opinion is a sign of that opinion, we shall have to classify the true premises of a valid syllogism which cause me to believe in the opinion as a sign of this conclusion. All men are mortal. I am a man. Are these premises a sign that I am mor- tal? If so, this is a novel usage of the term. Signs as such are not the causes of belief or disbelief. But Mr. Ducasse's definition of a symbol, as a matter of fact, is close to the correct definition of sign in general. No sign as such exercises any kind of efficient causation. But a sign is that which leads the knowing faculty to apprehend something other than it- self, in virtue of a real relation between the two. Another dubious feature of Mr. Ducasse's analvyis is his definition of a discursive entity, or word, in terms of three essential notes: (1) it must be readily uttered; (2), it must be recognizably similar in different exam- ples; and (3), it must always be artificial or man-caused.26 But, like Mor- ris' corresponding conception of language, this definition would seem to be too broad, and to apply to natural ejaculations which are quite distinct from words. For example, a human moan would seem to meet these three criteria. It is readily uttered, recognizably similar, and man-caused. Is it then a word? If so, sobbing and laughing are also words. As we have already indicated, they are natural signs of individual sorrow and joy, but few of us, I think, would agree upon careful reflection that they are, therefore, words in any exact sense of this term. Is this not because Mr. Ducasse has omitted a fourth essential note which distinguishes words from animal noises? In addition to the enumerated traits, I suggest that a word must be a repeatable type of noise, arbitrarily chosen to symbolize a concept. GENERAL CRITICISM OF MORRIS AND DUCASSE A. Their Causal Theory of Signs. Both Morris and Ducasse take the position that instead of being con- nected by a real, extramental relation apprehended by the interpreter, the sign is connected with the signatum only via some efficient, causal ef- fect which the former exerts on the interpreter. This is responsible for the psychological subjectivism which characterizes both theories. Thus for Morris the sign "controls behavior towards a goal."27 It 26 Ibid, p. 44. 27 Signs, Language, and Behavior, p. 7 (my italics).</page><page sequence="8">224 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH "causes a disposition in some organism to respond."28 The interpretant, stead of being a noetic apprehension, is something caused efficiently by the sign. Thus in the case of a dog conditioned to a buzzer, "the dis- position to seek food at a certain place, when caused by the buzzer, is the interpretant."29 Ducasse rightly segregates signification from all non- noetic causation.30 But as we have seen, he still clings to a causal theory of signification, as though the interpretation were in some way efficiently caused by the sign. Thus the sign situation is one in which "conscious- ness of something causes us to become conscious of something else,"'" irrespective of whether the sign and its signatum are apprehended as extramentally connected. Thus in his view also, the sign is related to its term only through some subjective connection, arbitrarily -(non-noetically) caused or imposed upon the interpreter. This subjectivistic view of mean- ing is the root of most of the ambiguities and difficulties in the two theories. As we have seen, it leads us to a view which cannot distinguish a sign from a sensory cue to action, or even from instrumental efficient causation in the inorganic world. Neither will it enable us to distinguish a sign from a mere subjective reminder or mnemonic device. For instance, as the result of an earlier experience of a train wreck, the consciousness of a train may cause a given individual to think of pain and death. But we would not say, nor would the given individual say for this reason that the train was a sign of pain and death. He would say rather that seeing a train sug- gested or reminded him of these experiences. This is because a reminder or mnemonic device is only subjectively connected with what it reminds us of. On the other hand, a sign is really connected with its signatum. The reminder functions only by acting on us to make us think of something else. It either reminds us in functioning in this way, or it does not. But a sign really signifies its signatum irrespective of its effect on us. Hence we can misconstrue or misinterpret signs. But there is no such thing as being misreminded by a reminder. It either reminds us or it does not. Most of the examples given by either Morris or Ducasse clearly show that there is a real relation between the sign and its signatum. The squeak of a chipmunk is really related to the chipmunk (as effect to cause), the roar of a lion to the lion, and the picture to its archetype (as similar to it). The sign relation is not merely psychological, as Ducasse holds, but real, and extramental. It actually signifies whether we are aware of it or not, and whether we correctly interpret it or not. This is in a sense true, as shall see, even of conventional signs. Take the written words of a book 28 Ibid, p. 10 (my italics). 29 Ibid, pp. 17-18 (my italics). 30 "Comments on Morris' Theory of Signs," p. 44-5. 31 "Symbols, Signs, and Signals," p. 42.</page><page sequence="9">PHENOMENOLOGY OF SIGNS 225 now closed! If they are only psychological reminders they are not actually signifying until the book is open and they are read. Or take the signs of the Cretan language which no one now knows how to interpret. Does this mean that they are not really signs? If so, how can we interpret the efforts of investigators to discover what they already mean? These fact, I think, are enough to show that signs must be distinguished from mere psychological suggestions or associations which refer to. some- thing only through some psychological association. If this were true, any- thing could be the sign of anything, and it would be impossible either in the case of natural signs (such as smoke) or arbitrary signs (such as words) to distinguish between the true interpretation and a misinterpretation. The sign as such does not influence or cause the will to act in any way. To signify is not the same as to argue or persuade or advise. It is not to exercise any mode of efficient causation. The sign does not efficiently make us think of another object. It renders this other object knowable in vir- tue of some real relation to this object. No entity which exerts any efficient causal efficacy upon us thereby sig- nifies anything to us. The wind that blows us in a certain direction does not signify this direction. The psychological conditioner who plays upon our appetites does not signify. The tooth-powder advertisement does not signify health, even though it may make us think of it. The sign rela- tion and the signatum to which it leads are not causes of knowledge but rather (except for formal signs) objects of knowledge. They are already in existence, and hence capable of being known. A sign is anything capable of noetically specifying (not causing, except in the sense of an extrinsic, formal cause) the noetic faculty to apprehend something other than itself, in virtue of some real relation to this signatum. B. Their Classification of Signs. In spite of certain minor differences, Morris and Ducasse both offer a scheme of classifying interpretanda which agree in certain essential respects. This common framework of classification suggests certain questions which I shall now consider. In the first place, it is strange that neither Morris nor Ducasse regards concepts as signs, though they would seem to be perfect examples of some- thing leading the noetic faculty to what is different from themselves, and, therefore, signs par excellence. Certainly they fall under Morris' earlier definition: "S is a sign of D for I to the degree that I takes account of D in virtue of the presence of S."32 The mind, I, takes account of (in a noetic sense) D (the object of the concept) in virtue of the presence (not the phy- 12 Foundations of the Theory of Signs, p. 4.</page><page sequence="10">226 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH sical presence) of S (the concept). Concepts, therefore, are signs. But they are strangely absent from Morris' list. According to Ducasse, if the consciousness of x "causes us to become conscious of something else," x is an interpretandum or sign in the broad sense.33 At first glance, it would seem that concepts also fall under this definition. As we have pointed out, there is no question of any efficient causation here. The concept is able to lead the noetic faculty to its object, "something else." In the concept, we understand that of which it is the concept. But does this necessarily imply that we are conscious of the concept? I think not. One may know a thing without having any clear consciousness of the concept bV which he knows. This is probably the reason why neither Morris nor Ducasse recognize concepts as interpre- tanda. They exercise their signifying function so perfectly and unobtru- sively that they fail to arouse our attention and we pass them over. But surely they are signs in the sense that they lead the mind to something other than themselves. Indeed, their whole nature lies in their exercise of this signifying function. They are nothing but signs, The smoke which is a sign of fire, the squeak of a chipmunk, and the word, all the other signs recognized by Morris and Ducasse, are something else besides signs. Smoke is not only a sign of fire. It is also physical vapor in the air. The squeak is physical sound, and the written word is ink on paper. Their signifying function is incidental to their physical being. But a concept does nothing but signify. If it does not refer to something else other than itself, it is not a concept. It is essentially a sign, a sign par excellence. Hence we must conclude that it is not necessary for a sign to obtrude itself upon our consciousness as a separate entity. Indeed, the most ef- fective signs are precisely those which call the least attention to themselves in exercising their referential function. This is illustrated by the process of learning the signs of a foreign tongue. The more we are forced to pay attention to the signs as such and to their syntax, the less is our mastery of the language. Anything that leads the knowing faculty to something other than itself is a sign. The more inconspicuously and vicariously a thing does this, the more it is a sign. The most perfect sign is a concept which is literally nothing but a sign and which almost entirely vanishes in exercising its signifying function. The failure of Morris and Ducasse to recognize concepts as signs must, therefore, be viewed as a serious defect in their schemes of classification. In the second place, there is a strange neglect of the vital distinction be- tween natural signs, like smoke, and the symptoms of disease, which occur in nature independent of human usage and decree, and arbitrary signs, like 3Op. cit., p. 42.</page><page sequence="11">PHENOMENOLOGY OF SIGNS 227 words, which are imposed by man. But neither system finds any place for natural signs. Morris recognizes three basic categories: indexical, iconic, and characterizing signs.34 But smoke, for example, is not. an indexical sign nor a characterizing sign which exercise their referential functions only through the mediation of animal responses. Smoke is a sign of fire, whether or not any organism happens to respond, and may be recognized as such by any man, whatever words or characterizing symbols he may happen to use in referring to it. Neither is smoke an icon or image of fire. It is not even similar. Natural signs do not coincide with .any of the three basic categories recognized by Ducasse, symbols, signs, and signals,35 for symbols and signs are defined as mental events,36 and signals are a kind of "deliberate utterance."37 This omission is no doubt traceable to that common causal or subjectivistic view of the sign relation on which we have already commented. This leads them to regard all signs as arbitrarily imposed by usage and habit, and hence blinds them to the im- portant category of natural sign. Both writers hold that icons or pictures are signs.38 We may agree that incidentally, under certain circumstances, an image may become a sign of its archetype. But are the two (image of and sign of) related as species to genus? If so, every image will ipso facto be a sign. This, I thinkk, is open to serious question. Imagine two eggs in a basket before you. One is an image of the other. Is either one the sign of the other? A man's picture may also be a sign of the man, when he is far away. But would anyone say that it is a sign of him when he is physically present in the same room? I suggest that this seems dubious. Why? * This, I think, is because the essential function of a sign is to lead the mind (not behavioristically but noetically) to something other than itself. This requires that the sign qua sign must be better known to us than its signatum, and, therefore, as a sign, dissimilar to it. The sign relation may be founded on a real relation of similarity or iconicity. It may be in virtue of some real similarity that the mind is led from a better known image to a hidden archetype. But though the two relations may coincide in the same material objects, they are not formally the same. The picture, qua picture, is not a sign. It becomes a sign only through some dissimilarity which makes it better known to us, and, therefore, leads the mind to its signatum. Ordinary discourse suggests a distinction between ordinary signs, 34 Morris, Foundations, p. 24. 35 "Comments on Morris' Theory of Signs," pp. 48 ff. 36 "Symbols, Signs, and Signals," p. 42. 37 "Comments on Morris' Theory of Signs," p. 51. 38 Morris, Foundations, p. 24; cf. Signs, Language, and Behavior, pp. 191-2. Du- casse, op. cit., p. 48.</page><page sequence="12">228 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH which simply signify some entity other than themselves, and another kind of sign (the signal), which signifies some act to be performed, as the stop- light, and the rocket from a sinking ship. This distinction is not perhaps of major importance, but it is worthy of note, and should be recognized by any systematic attempt to classify the different kinds of sign. It does not seem to be sharply defined in accordance with common English usage by either Morris or Ducasse. Morris does not seem to distinguish between natural signs and signals. According to him, "a person may interpret his pulse as a sign of his heart condition or certain sensations as a sign that he needs food; such signs are simply signals."'39 This is readily understandable in view of the fact that he regards all signs as stimuli calling forth active tendencies to respond, and, therefore, really as signals. Ducasse, I think rightly, tries to distinguish between signs and signals, but it is doubtful if his definition of the latter brings out the difference with sufficient sharp- ness. He defines a signal as "a deliberate utterance of something the per- ceiving of which the utterer believes will cause in the other person a certain idea-or as the case may be, a certain belief, or a certain feeling, or a certain attempt . . . ")40 A signal would thus seem to be a sign or symbol deliberately uttered. But this would not seem to be an adequate expression of the difference. Surely many linguistic symbols may be deliberately uttered in a purely referential sense without signalizing any action or "attempt" to be per- formed on the part of the recipient. This latter, I suggest, is the differenti- ating mark of a signal-a sign that signifies an act to be performed. All signals are signs, for they refer to something other than themselves. But not all signs are signals, for many signs refer to entities which are not purposive acts to be performed by the hearer. Even the signs of purposive acts are not signals, unless these acts are meant to be performed by the recipient of the signal. A REALISTIC THEORY OF SIGNS By a brief examination of these uncertainties and difficulties we have tried to bring certain facts into view. We shall now attempt to suggest in outline a realistic theory of signs which will faithfully follow these facts. This outline will be divided into two parts: (1) a description of the sign relation and (2) a classification of the major kinds of sign. We shall here adopt the realistic position first suggested by Aristotle in the De Inter- pretione, and shall follow the general line of doctrine which gradually ,9 Signs, Language, and Behavior, p. 26. 40 Op. cit., p. 51.</page><page sequence="13">PHENOMENOLOGY OF SIGNS 229 emerged in the later development of the realistic tradition.4' It is our contention that this realistic theory is phenomenologically more adequate than the views we have so far considered. (1) The Nature of the Sign Relation A sign is anything capable of manifesting something other than itself as an object to the knowing faculty. . According to this definition, a sign is a real relation and, like any real relation, must have a foundation and term. If a white piece of paper A is similar to another paper B, the foundation of the relation is the whiteness of A, and the term is B qua white. In this case, the foundation of the rela- tion is not something relative, but the quality of white in A. Sometimes, however, something relative is the foundation of a relation. Thus the relative act of generation founds the relation of father to son. In a similar way the sign relation is founded on a relative capacity of the knowing fac- ulty to manifest or represent an object. But to signify is not the same as to manifest. A single object may be manifested. Nothing can signify itself. Signification is a relation between two objects A and B which are con- nected in such a way that B can be manifested to the faculty via A. This requires three conditions. First, A must be more knowable than B, as the footprint of the animal is more knowable than the animal. Second, A must be dissimilar to B, as smoke to fire. Third, A must be related to B, as the symptoms to the disease. Whenever these three conditions obtain, A is a sign of B. But certain points demand a fuller explanation. First of all, it must be strongly emphasized that manifesting is not the same as signifying, though the two are often confused. Light manifests color. The microscope manifests the cellular structure on the slide. But neither the one nor the other signifies the object manifested. Knowing is a kind of manifesting, and signifying is a kind of knowing. All signify- ing is knowing, but all knowing is not signifying. Thus nonexistent en- tities, like mermaids and centaurs, may be known or represented, but not signified. Furthermore, it must be noted that A may really signify B when neither the one nor the other is actually known. Thus, as we have pointed out against the subjectivistic view, smoke is a real sign of fire whether or not anyone knows the smoke. Of course it is essential to the sign relation that 41 A most illuminating account of this will be found in the Cursu8 Philosophicus, loannis a Sancto Thoma, Reiser ed., Marietti, Turin (1930), I, Ars Logica, Qu. XXI- XXIII.</page><page sequence="14">230 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH it can be known. But it can actually signify without being actually known. This brings up the question as to how the sign acts on the noetic faculty. Both Morris and Ducasse reflect a widely held opinion that the sign acts in some way on the mind as an efficient cause. The efficient causes of knowledge are not outside the mind but primarily within it. Nevertheless there is a sense in which we can truly say that the sign leads or moves the mind to the signatum. Knowledge must not only be brought into being by an efficient cause. It must also be specified as the knowledge of this or of that. In knowing a single entity (not a sign), this formal specification is due to the single extrinsic object known. But in knowing a sign, this formal specification is due to two extrinsic entities, the sign and the sig- natum. The sign only begins to specify the object, and leads the mind formally or noetically to the signatum which completes the specification. Thus Morris is correct in maintaining that there is something inceptive or preparatory about a sign. But it prepares for the completion not of a behavioral act but of an act of knowledge, something quite distinct. Ducasse is also correct in holding that the sign causes knowledge of the signatum. But the precise sense in which it is a cause needs to be more clearly specified. It belongs to the order of formal, not efficient, causation. Knowing the sign causes knowledge of the signatum as knowing the foundation of any relation causes knowledge of its term. Thus in knowing the relation of similarity which A has to B, we cannot say that A efficiently causes the mind to bring B into existence without denying the extramental reality of the relation. A is a moving specifier in a formal sense, leading the mind to a terminating specification in B. The same is true of the sign relation. The sign inaugurates not a process of efficient causation on behavior, but a noetic process of specification which terminates in the signatum. It is true that some sudden event, like a noise or a flash, may exercise efficient causation on us, and bring some sign to our attention, but paying attention to a sign is one thing, interpreting it is another. The act of inter- pretation is a noetic act whose efficient causes lie primarily within the mind. These acts are formally (not efficiently) specified by the sign in a mobile, vicarious manner, and by signatum in a final, terminative manner. Neither of these acts efficiently on the mind to bring something new into existence. Neither of these is efficiently projected by the mind into being. The sign relation is an object of knowledge, not an efficient cause of knowledge. This enables us to agree with common experience in distinguishing signs from behavioral cues to behavior and subjective reminders, as something discovered, not made. Real relations exist in the nature of things. When one of the related entities is more knowable to us than the other, and, there- fore, dissimilar to it, the former is a sign of the latter. Thus the tem- perature reading on the thermometer, which we can more easily know, is</page><page sequence="15">PHENOMEN OLOGY OF SIGNS 231 a sign of the disease which we cannot so easily know, and the smoke of the fire, which we can more easily see, is a sign of the fire which we cannot so easily see. These signs exercise their signifying function whether or not anyone interprets or misinterprets them. Wherever there are real relations between dissimilar entities there are signs. Let us now see whether on the basis of such a realistic theory of signs we can work out an intelligible classification of the major kinds of sign which will do justice to the rich variety of facts. (2) The Classification of Signs The first and most basic division is that between natural and arbitrary signs, and it is most important not to confuse the one with the other. The world of nature is full of relations such as those of causal dependence and similarity. Since we cannot know the whole of nature all at once, we must begin with a tiny circle of sensible objects which are directly available. Once we know something of their relational order, we may know what they signify in virtue of these real relations. Thus effects become signs of their causes, as a moan is a sign of pain, and one event of another similar event, as the climax of disease is a sign of death. These signs really exist in nature independently of whether anyone interprets them or not. They are dis- covered, not made, since they are really connected with what they -signify, Hence they are always capable of leading the mind to something other than themselves. They are natural signs. Arbitrary signs are not really connected with what they signify. A word, for example, is itself related to its meaning. But this relation has to be externally imposed upon it by arbitrary, human decree. Once im- posed, the word retains its meaning as long as the imposition endures. But the relation does not actually inhere in the word. It is extrinsic to it, as the relation of being seen is extrinsic to the wall, not characterizing it intrinsically or changing it in any wN-ay. So the signs of a closed book or those of an unknown language do not actually exercise their signifying function while they are uninterpreted. In this state, they are foundational signs. The relation does not actually exist but only potentially in its foundation the word. If this were the foundation of a real relation the relation itself would come into existence together with its term. Thus, as soon as the child is born the relation of fatherhood arises. Similarly, a natural sign relation, given its foundation, comes into existence together with the existence of its sig- natum. As long as it really exists, the sign will go on signifying. But an arbitrary sign, like a word or a signal, is very different. Even though its term exists, it will not actually signify unless the right mental relation is again extrinsically imposed. Since this relation is extrinsic to the word,</page><page sequence="16">232 PHILOSOPHY AN-D PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH however, there is no discernible difference in the word as such, whether it is signifying or not. Nevertheless, without the imposition of meaning it is not actually a sign, but only a potential foundation. When we know that a sound or a written word signifies something but cannot specify its exact meaning, this is an incomplete sign which partially signifies. We only begin to apprehend the relation, without being able to fulfill it. Natural signs are divided into those which are formal and those which are instrumental. Concepts, for example, are formal signs. That is to say, their whole nature is to signify, i.e., to specify the noetic faculty by some- thing- other than themselves. A concept which is not of some object is ipso facto not a concept. As we have said, it is nothing but a sign, and it can function in no other way than by signifying an abstract object. The imaginative image is also a formal sign. Its whole nature lies in referring to a concrete. object other than itself of which it is the particular image. An image which is not of something is ipso facto not an image. Its signify- ing function is not in any way incidental, but is essential to the image. Concepts and images are formal signs, and they certainly do not signify in virtue of any relation which is extrinsically imposed by arbitrary decree. The concept of a triangle, for instance, is intrinsically related to its object, and no arbitrary decree can relate it to any other object. Hence it is a natural, formal sign. All other natural signs are instrumental, that is, their whole being is not exhausted in the exercise of their signifying function. Smoke, for example, is certainly something more than the sign of fire. It is a physical entity with physical properties of its own. The sign relation is only one among many such properties and relations. It is, therefore, an instrumental sign. W~e must place under this classification all natural signs which are not images and concepts (formal signs). All formal signs are natural. All natural signs are not formal. Arbitrary signs, like words and traffic signals, are physical entities possessing many traits and attributes besides the sign relation imposed upon them. Hence they are also instrumental signs. Arbitrary signs fall into two distinct divisions, signs proper, which indicate some reality through the mediation of a concept, and signals, which also indicate some purposive act to be performed by the recipient. Thus a signpost and a demonstrative gesture are signs. They indicate some object to be known, not some act to be done. But a traffic light and a cry for help are signals. They not only signify an object, but an act to be performed by the recipient. All signals are necessarily signs for they lead the knowing faculty -to something other than themselves, a purposive operation to be performed. But not all signs are signals for many things can be signified which are not operations to be performed. Signs are not relative to the active tendencies</page><page sequence="17">PHENOMENOLOGY OF SIGNS 233 or purposes of the interpreter. Hence they cannot be truly interpreted in different ways. They are either understood or misunderstood. But signals are relative to the purposes of the interpreter. Hence they may be rightly interpreted in different ways relative to the purposes of different interpreters. This is true of the natural cues of the subhuman brutes. Thus the same cue will set off one mode of response in animals of the same species and a very different mode of response in those of a different or inimical species (with different active tendencies). This is also true of the analog- ous, arbitrary signals of men. As signs they can be truly interpreted only in one way. But as signals they may be differently interpreted in relation to different human purposes. Thus in time of war the very same signal will rightly indicate one course of action to a friend and another to an enemy. JOHN WILD. HARVARD UNIVERSITY.</page></plain_text>
