<plain_text><page sequence="1">METAMORPHOSIS OF ¡ŠAIVISM IN RAJASTHAN, C. AD 600-1000: THE CULT, SECTS AND MONASTIC ORDER By Shanta R. Sharma Radical changes in the chftacter of Šaivism and its monastic order occurred in c. AD 600-1000 Rajasthan, with the prominence of temple worship, adoption of the market concept of investment in contravention of ancient scriptural dictums, accrual of commercial levies, extension of religious rights to the ritually lower classes, and the patronage of various new ruling dynasties including the Cãhamãnas, Guhilas and the Rajor Pratihãras. Organized activity by Šaiva monks of the Šaivasiddhantin and Pãsupata sects at Rajor, Kãmãn and Harsa strengthened Šaivism, as did the selfless life of the Pãsupata sages at Harsa. While the Šaiva preceptors at Rajor maintained close interaction with other monasteries, the Šaivas at Kãmãn held charge of the shrines of other sects as well. Šiva's multifaceted terrific-cum-beneficent personality , as ardhanãrisvara , the eight- formed god, bearer of the liñga form enshrined at Harsa and glorified in the liñgodbhava image, held universal appeal. The alluring prospect of the acquisition of siddhi-s and boons added to the Pãáupata sect's popularity, evident from the numerous Lakulíša images and the inscriptions at Harsa, Ekaliñga and Kãmãn. The Kãpãlikas too, associated with miraculous powers and disregard of caste, attained popularity. Religious developments are a reflection of the contemporary political and socioeconomic processes. The supplanting of the tribal with a territorial polity, the distant military expeditions of the rulers of Rajasthan, the assimilation of tribais and urban growth in c. AD 600-1000 Rajasthan found expression in the assimilation of tribal cults, popularity of the fierce forms of the different deities, the emergence of Ganapati as a major deity and syncretism.1 What is intriguing is that despite Visnu's projection as a saviour, 1 Cf. Shanta R. Sharma, 'Evolution of Deities and Syncretism in Rajasthan. c. AD 600-1000: the Dynamics and Material Implications', Paper read at Waves International Conference, New Jersey, 2000.</page><page sequence="2">140 Annals BORI, LXXXIII ( 2002 ) the widespread conception of the goddess as the manifestation of manifold power, the popularity of the sun-god and the ascription of almost similar powers of beneficence to the different gods, Šiva's popularity was in the ascendant. The present paper shows that a singular transformation in the nature of Šaivism and the monastic organization was responsible for this phenomenon. Šaivism assumed a new form from the seventh century onwards as both the Unga and iconic representations, popularly worshipped in the Kusãna and Gupta periods , came to be increasingly enshrined in the temples . This stemmed from the growing belief that the building of a temple and providing for its unkeep was conducive to high religious merit. The Dabok inscription of AD 644 specifically records that the physician ( vaidya ) Gîyaka established a temple of Šiva and also granted fields for its repair and maintenance in order to secure an increase of religious merit and fame for his parents and himself. 2 According to a c. seventh century inscription from Kalyanpur a person named Ãmnãya built a Šiva temple for the attainment of communion with Šiva.3 The Jhalrapatan inscription of AD 689-90 states that Voppaka, a dyütasabhäpati, seeing that a chain of sufferings produced by old age and separation clings to embodied beings, built a temple of Šiva for spiritual merit in order to avoid (future) births and deaths. 4 Though temple construction was undertaken by the other Purãnic sects as well, nowhere did it have such far-reaching effects on the religious organizations as in Šaivism. The Nagar inscription of the Guhila ruler Dhanika, AD 684, 5 clearly reveals the strength of Šiva's personality as a terrific-cum-beneficent deity. Though the cause of the annihilation of the universe, he also held the power to bestow happiness. Though half of his form was shared by his consort Gauri, the inscription declared, he was the foremost amongst the ascetics of controlled minds, and though all-powerful, he never cherished conceit. He was perceived as all-pervasive, with his body composed of the sun and the moon, water, fire, earth, air, sky and the sacrificing priest. The last description is indicative of the deity as the bearer of the eight forms, i.e., the sun? moon, the five elements and the sacrificing priest, eulogized and worshipped in the earlier Abhijnãnaiãkuntalam of Kãlidãsa6 and the 2 Epigraphia Indica (henceforth EI), XX, pp. 122f. 3 EI, XXXV, pp. 55f. 4 Indian Antiquary (henceforth I A), pp. 180f. 5 Bhãrata-Kaumudl, I, p. 267 6 Abhijñánasákuntalam, 1,1.</page><page sequence="3">Shanta R. Sharma : Metamorphosis ofŠaivism in Rajasthan 141 Harsacarita of Bãna.7 The invoking of the flaming third eye of Šiva, which in splendour resembled the twelve suns and consumed the god of love, for purification by the Jhalawar inscription8 also reflects the dual personality of Šiva, wrathful and powerful, yet beneficent. Further development ensuring the popularity of Šiva in eighth century Rajasthan are borne out by the Kanaswa and Kãmãn inscription. The former, dated AD 738-39, eulogizes Šiva as the deity who makes men cross the sea of mundane existence and invokes him for the protection and preservation of the world. It ecstatically dwells on the beauty of his matted hair bearing the serpent-filled heavenly Ganga and the gleaming moon-diadem, the flashing tongues of fire in his eye and his dance. Soon after it showers praise upon the Mauryan race of the reigning king as one that adorns the world with the moon- like beautiful jewels in the diadems (of its princes), is able to protect kings beset with difficulties, is served by armies come from afar and is bright in all manners of precious things; it appears like the ocean which adorns Šiva with the moon, the beautiful jewel of (his) diadem, is the resort of big serpents, is able to affored shelter to mountains, and has for its retinue the rivers.9 It is a very evident attempt to lay claim to an elevated status for the ruling line on the basis of an association with Šiva via an ingenious poetic imagery. The construction of a Šiva temple and donations made to it are considered the only appropriate use of wealth and attributed, as in earlier cases, to the realization that life is burdened with every affliction, old age, separation and death. 10 The inscription bears testimony to the extension of patronage to Šiva temples by rulers, who were emerging as a new political force in Rajasthan, replacing the erstwhile tribal polity, and were seeking both worldly and spiritual merit. Kãmãn has a set of inscriptions with dates ranging from AD 786 to AD 905-6. 1 1 While the fragmentary first part of the inscription refers to the erection of a Šiva temple on realization of the transitoriness (of earthly fortune) and to Šaiva ãcãrya who were successively in charge of it, the second part registers various deeds recording the donations to the deity Kãmyakeávara from time to time. These include a donation made by a merchant named Vajrata, the date and nature of which is not clear. In AD 835 we have the gift of two plots of 7 Harsacarita, ed K.P.

Three successive inscriptions from AD 835, 838 and 839 record that the guilds of potters, gardeners, and artisans livings in Kãmyaka, in consideration of an amount paid in advance to each one of them, stipulated to pay respectively a permanent cess of one pana per wheel every month, the permanent supply to sixty garlands and one dramma per artisan. An inscription dated AD 826 records the endowment of three plough-measures of land by a person named Untata and another inscription, dated AD 786, that of two ãvãri-s (enclosures) by a worker on conch-shells ( sãnkhika ) . The document dated AD 905 records that the earlier gift of some dramma- s made by Bhoja (identified with the Imperial Pratihãra ruler Bhoja) to Pramãnarãsi was made over by the latter to ãcãrya Cãmundãka, and by him to the trustees ( gosthika-s ) of the temple, who purchased two enclosures with shops with the money. The rent from these was to be utilized in meeting the expenses of white- washing, vermilion and lights for the temple. These donations may be tabulated as below: - Date Donor Occupation Donation - Vajrata merchant donation unspecified AD 835 guild potters one pana per wheel AD 835 a person two plots of land AD 838 guild gardeners sixty garlands AD 839 guild artisans one dramma per month AD 826 Untata three plough-measures AD 786 šaňkhika two enclosures ( ãvãri-s ) AD 905 Bhoja ruler dramma- s from which enclosures with shops were purchased and rented out Comprising a collective copy of a large number of deeds, the inscription shows careful recording of various donations and their meticulous management, evolution of efficient organizational activity by the Šaivas and the availability of substantial resources at the disposal of Šaiva temples. The mention of the name Gunarãsi in the first part of the inscription and Pramànarãái in the second12 indicates that the temple was placed in charge of Šaiva ãcãryas of the Pãsupata sect, who are known to have the suffix 'rãsi' generally added i2 Ibid,</page><page sequence="5">Shanta R. Sharma : Metamorphosis of Šaivism in Rajasthan 143 to their name. 1 3 The actual management, however, appears to have been carried out by the trustees or committee (gosthi) appointed for the purpose. The inscription testifies to their successful maintenance of the temple of Kãmyakeávara over a period of more than a hundred years.14 There is no evidence of the other Purãnic sects evolving similar organizations. Rather, the AD 838 document at Kãmãn, recording the arrangement of the delivery of thirty-four garlands and twenty-six garlands respectively to the Visnu and Cãmundã temples, indicates that the shrines of Visnu and Cãmundã were also under the charge of the Šaivas.15 Organizational activity of the Šaivas is also evidenced by the separate Kãmãn inscription of AD 869. Enumeration of the names of eight gosthika-s in the context of a Šaiva temple built by three brothers in the memory of their father indicates that the gosthika-s were trustees of an endowment created for the maintenance of the temple.16 The Kãmãn inscription reveals that the Pãsupata sect was not averse to the participation of artisans and potters in temple activities in the form of regular contributions . They publicly reposed faith in the guilds of these classes , classified as Šůdras by the earlier Amarakoša 17 and the later smrtis.18 This is significant in the light of the earlier statement of Kaundinya, the prominent ãcãrya of the Gupta period, that the disciple must be a member of the higher sections of society and that the aspirant who talked to a Šůdra must atone for his lapse.19 It is apparent that the Pãsupata sect had come to terms with the contemporary urban milieu characterized by the emergence of new productive forms, viz., widespread trade, money economy and flourishing arts and crafts.20 This was manifest also in the Šaiva adoption of the market concept of investment in order to safeguard and augment the temple resource-base. 13 Cf.

The Saddaršanasamuccaya of Haribhadra (c.8thcentury) reveals that the Pãáupatas did not care for the caste system in admitting people to their ascetic orders.23 Ninth century inscriptions reveal that merchants and women also took part in temple construction. The c. eighth-ninth century inscription from Kalyanpur records the construction of a Šiva temple by a lady called Vonnã, the wife of a ruling chief, with the help of a Šaiva teacher, Kutukkãcãrya and her monetary donation for future repairs and maintenance.24 The AD 807 Khandela inscription records the construction of a Šiva and Pãrvati temple by the merchant (vanik) Adityanãga for the merit of his parents and himself. In consonance with the devotee's pacific occupation, the inscription opens with stanzas referring to the ardhanãrlsvara aspect of Šiva. A very homely picture of Šiva is presented, as the sight of Bhavãni on his side, when the children Skanda and Ganapati have gone to a festival, is said to have aroused great passion in him, and caused him to absorb her in half his body.25 The dedicated life and efficient organization of Šaiva teachers of the different Šaiva sects, their active propagation of the cult by participation in the erection and management of temples and the patronage of rulers ensured further popularization of Šaivism in the tenth century. The Rajor inscription, AD 959, records that Mathanadeva, the Pratihãra ruler of Rajor, established the deity as Lacchukešvara, named so after his mother, Lacchukä. His grant of a village to the temple was entrusted to the holy ascetic Onkãrasivãcãrya, a disciple of Šrikanthacarya. He was a member of the Sopuriya line or school (of devotees) started at Amarddaka, and an inmate of the Nityapramoditadeva matha at Rãjyapura, which was connected with the Gopãlidevitadãgapãlí 21 Supra. 22 Kaundinya.

Sharma : Metamorphosis ofŠaivism in Rajasthan 145 matha at Cchattrašiva.26 Evidently there was a well-established line of Šaiva teachers and also interaction between different Šaiva monasteries. The inscription of Dharanívarãha, a Cãpotaka ruler feudatory to Mahipãla, suggests that these ãcãrya- s belonged to the Šaivasiddhánta school.27 The Tantrãloka' s ascription of the founding of the dualist school to Amarddaka, the mind-born son of Durvãsa28 (at the latter 's instance), strengthens this conclusion. The Šaiva temple of Rajor was well provided for as the various types of income arising from the village grant were utilized for defraying the expenses of bathing (the god) thrice a day, of unguents, flowers, incense, naivedya offering, light and oil, of applying whitewash and red lead, of repairing what may have been damaged or broken, putting on the sacred thread and paying labourers, gardeners etc. This resource-base was further supplemented by the proceeds of various taxes and tolls , made over to the deity jointly with the god Vinãyaka set up in the adjoining chapel. These included three Vimšopaka-s on every sack of agricultural produce brought for sale to the market, two palikãs on every ghataka-kupaka of clarified butter and oil, two vimšopakas per mensem from every shop and fifty leaves from every collika (of leaves) brought from outside the town.29 Evidently the intimate association of Šiva with Ganeša, who was emerging as a deity especially close to the business class, made him a worthy co-recipient for a contribution from the business community. The Šaiva temple, operating within an urban ambit enjoyed the dual benefit accruing from rural income and commercial activity, supplying it with income in both cash and kind. The liňga form of Šiva was especially revered by the Cãhamãnas of Šakambhari. The mother of Vãkpatirãja I (c. AD 918-43), Rudrãni, is said to have lighted a thousand lamps daily before the liňgam- s at Puskara.30 According to the Harsa inscription of Vigraharãja II, AD 973, Šiva enshrined in the liňga form was the family-deity of the Cãhamãnas of Šakambhari. The temple of Harsanãtha, originally built by Güvaka I , received a grant of abundant wealth from Simharãja, the father of Vigraharãja II, who set a golden shell on the spire. The temple was renovated in AD 956 by the Pãáupata sage Aliata 26 El, III, pp. 263 f. 27 Historical Inscription of Gujarat, III, no. 236; D.

After him, his pupil Bhävadyota, in accordance with the instructions received from his preceptor, raised an orchard for furnishing flowers to the Šiva temple, a watering place for the cattle and a well. He also paved the floor in front of the temple.31 The Harsa inscription records various endowments of villages and fields made to the temple by the ruler's father, uncle, brothers and the ruler himself as well as by various pious people. It also mentions cash grants assigned in the form of one vithšopaka on every kütaka of salt assigned by the Bhammaha guild and one dramma on every horse by horse-dealers of the north. The Harsa temple was thus generously endowed with both land and cash donations. Specific mention is made of their being assigned for the purpose of bathing, worshipping and anointing (the god), for oblations, incense and lamps, and for the celebration of processions on festive days, and that donations were not misused is evident from the austere life of the Šaiva preceptors. Considerable details regarding the dedicated life of the Pãáupata ascetics in charge of the Harsanãtha temple are recorded in the Harsa inscription. The preceptor Visvarüpa is described as a learned teacher of the Lakula doctrine expounding pancãrtha, i.e., the Pãáupata doctrine. His disciple was Allata's preceptor, Prasasta, purified by pure knowledge and a true worshipper of Pašu pati. Aliata is described as a religious student by birth, with mere space for his covering, with his soul completely controlled and practising austerities. His mind solely bent on worshipping the holy Harsa he had forsaken the infatuation of the outer world and renounced all desires. His disciple again was Bhävadyota, a perpetual student who fervently practiced the vows of a Pãáupata ascetic and acquired holiness by fierce austerities. Raiment consisting of mere space, matted hair, ashes, a broad couch formed by the earth, food received as alms, and the hand used as a drinking-cup, represented all his earthly wants.32 Such a life of self-abnegation led by Šaiva sages who had immensely vast resources at their command was bound to win the respect and admiration of the people. Šaivism, particularly the Pãáupata sect, was equally popular under the Guhilas. A detailed account of the Lakulxáa sect of Šaivas is given in the AD 97 1 Ekaliñga inscription of the reign of Naravãhana the Guhila ruler of 3i EI. II. p. 116; I A, XLII, pp. 57 f. 32 Ibid.</page><page sequence="9">Shanta Ii. Sharma : Metamorphosis of Šaivism in Rajasthan 147 Mewar. The sage Bhrgu, it is stated, once cursed by Visnu, in the country of Broach, propitiated Siva, who became incarnate as an ascetic holding a club (lakula) at Kãyãvarohana. Mention is made*of Kušika and other sages who were conversant with the Pãsupata-yoga and who resorted to the use of ashes, bark and matted hair. The widely famed sages who were worshippers of Ekaliňga were instrumental in the building of the temple of Lakulišá raised on Mt. Ašvagrama. At the end occur the names of Supüjitaräsi. Sadyorãsi and Viniscitarãái.33 Epigraphic and bardic tradition ascribes the royal power of the legendary Guhila ruler Bappa Rawal to the favour of the Šaiva ascetic Hãritarãsi, whose name-suffix 'rasi' suggests that he belonged to the Pãsupata sect. According to Muhanot Nainsi, the sage Hãrita, a devotee of Ekaliňga, propitiated Šiva and obtained the boon of the kingdom of Mewar for Bappa, who tended cows and served him for twelve years.34 The Chittor inscription, AD 1274 35 and the Mount Abu inscription of Samarasimha, AD 1285, 36 also respectively state that Bappa became lord of Medapãta and obtained regal splendour through the same sage. The Ekalmgamãhãtmya , written in the time of Mahäräna Kumbha, tells us that in V.S. 810 Bappa, who had received the boon from Ekaliňga Šaňkara, became the first king.37 According to the Kumbalgarh inscription of AD 1460 the temple of Ekaliňga was built by Bappa. Bappa 's gold coin depicts the Šivaliňga, with the trident and couchant Nandi at its left and right sides.38 It is evident that the later Guhilas sought to capitalize on the popularity of the Pãáupata sect in their dominions by the attribution of their power and authority to the grace of a Pãáupata sage. The patronage of Harsanãtha by the Cãhamãnas must have added to their prestige as well. The epigraphic evidence of the flourishing state of the Pãsupata religion at Ekaliňga, Harsanãtha and Kãmãn is supplemented by the archaeological evidence represented by the discovery of many early medieval sculptures of Lakuliáa, regarded as an incarnation of Šiva. These 33 Ed. D.R.

But an even weightier factor was the nature of its conception of Šiva and its doctrine. These held universal appeal, catering to the needs and aspirations of different sections of society. An insight into these can be had from the Harsa inscription, which starts with ten verses devoted to the glorification of Šiva. Part of the description is convetional. It refers to the anthropomorphic form of Šiva. holding a trident in one hand and an alms-dish in the other, bearing the serpent-necklace around his throat and the Ganga in his matted hair. It also describes his dance, at which the world verily changes its position, and fire from his eye, which destroyed the god of love. In keeping with the Pãsupata theology that God is the karana or cause, it regards Harsa as 'the unfathomable architect for the construction of the world, by whose will and power all that was not is produced and vanishes again'. Last comes the description of Harsa as the eight-formed god and the Lord of eight siddhi- s or miraculous powers.40 This reference to the siddhi- s of Šiva is of profound significance as they represent the final goal that a Pãsupata devotee strives for, viz, dukkhãnta, end of sorrows, characterized by the state of mahaisvarya or the attainment of the powers possessed by Mahešvara. 41 Enumerated by the earlier Pãsupata-sutra- s 42 and reiterated in the Ratnatikã on the Ganakãrikcft (c. 10th century) and Madhaväcärya's Sarvadaršanasamgraha 44 (14th century), these include the five supernatural powers of omniscience, the knowledge of all objects, sounds, thoughts, sciences and principles, and the three powers of omnipotence, extraordinary speed in action, assumption of shapes at will 39 Cf.

The promise of unlimited power was well suited to the martial proclivity of the rulers, the material outlook of the urban masses as well as the aspirations of peoples of various cultural levels. Epigraphic and literary sources also evidence the general belief that one could have recourse to the benefits of these siddi- s by the grace of those who possessed them, i.e., the God himself and the Pãsupata sages. This is quite a justifiable corollary derivable by the popular mind from the unique Pašupata doctrine of the absolute independence of God presented by Kaundinya 45 and the Ratnatlkã 46 In practical terms this meant that God acted without regard to human actions or karma.41 Madhavãcãrya notes the opposition that this theory evoked from the believers in the efficacy of karma as also the Pãsupata reffirmation that God was not actuated by the efficacy of actions.48 Another virtue of Šiva emphasized by the Pãáupata religion was his grace through which one who observed constant caution gained liberation.49 It is against this theological background that we have to peruse the Harsa inscription which describes Šiva as the bestower of compassion and later attributes the origin of the virtues of the great rulers of the Cãhamãna dynasty to their devotion to Šambhu. The illustriousness of their family is also attributed to Šiva in the form of Harsa, their family-deity.50 The Ekaliñga inscription describes the Pãáupata sages as the repository of curse and beneficence.51 The widespread ascription of Bappa's royalty to either the grace of Šiva or the Šaiva ascetic Hãritarãsi has already been noted.52 Another feature of Šaivism was liñga worship. Evidence regarding the worship of Šiva's Ekaliñga form, the enshinement of Harsanãtha in the liñga form and the liňgas as Puskara has already been noted.53 The Dhiirtãkhyãna, an eighth century Prãkrit work from Rajasthan, cites the legend that Visnu and Brahmã ran up and down for a thousand years but 45 Kaundinya on Pašupata Sutra, V. 47. 46 Ratnatikã on Ganakarikã , cited by D.N.

Brahma and Visnu are again shown as respectful attendants of Šiva.56 Another such image found at Lamba in Marwar has been assigned to the Pratihära period.57 As the Unga form is believed to have been originally borrowed from the non-Aryans,58 its popularity must have helped in tribal assimilation. The Šaiva sect of Käpälikas mentioned by Vâcaspati's Bhâmatï 59 (c. AD 850) finds mention in contemporary Jaina Prãkrit works from Rajasthan. In the Kuvalayamãlã (AD 778), the conduct of a disconsolate woman, who placing her husband's skeletal remains on her shoulders, roamed about the cremation-ground, clad in tattered clothes, her body besmeared with dust and dirty in appearance, subsisting on begged food, is said to be akin to that of a Kãpãlika girl (kãpãlikabãlã).60 the Caiulakaušika (AD 900- 950)61 and Prabodhacandrodaýa (12th century)62 also describe the Kãpãlikas as wearing a garland of human bones, living in a cremation ground and carrying a skull. Notwithstanding their uncanny practices, the Kãpãlikas enjoyed a position of great respectability. The Samarãiccakahã relates the story of a penitent gambler desirous of respect, fame, good company and benevolence. He reflected that in view of his lack of wealth and the ephemeral nature of life the best course open for him was to adopt the religion that bestowed happiness in both worlds. Accordingly he joined the Kãpãlika order. He is later represented as having attained the garudu mantra, a most powerful mystic 54 Dhãrtãkhyãna, I. 39-40. 55 Cf. R.K.

Sharma : Metamorphosis of Šaivism in Rajasthan 151 formula which acted as an instant antidote to snake-bite on recitation.63 In the Kuvalayamãlã, we find the observance of the Kãpãlika vow being prescribed as a means of expiation for the most heinous crimes by certain village elders.64 It also refers to Jaina occult vidyã- s being practised under the guise of Kãpãlikas.65 The attitude of Jainism in Rajasthan to the Kãpãlikas was thus much different from that in Karnataka where Somadeva's Yašastilaka prescribes penance for the Jaina monk who came into contact with them.66 A plausible reason for this could be that the sect in Rajasthan remained largely free from extremist practices such as recourse to wine and women since the Prãkrit works, though Jaina, do not associate these with them. Haribhadra's Saddaršanasamuccaya (8th century) indicates that the Kãpãlikas did not care for the caste system while admitting people into their ascetic order.67 To conclude, Šaivism assumed a new form with the widespread temple construction and the efficient organizational activity of selfless Šaiva preceptors. Patronage by the powerful new ruling families such as the Guhilas and the Cãhamãnas, merchants and women brought in both cash and land grants. The assignation of commercial levies to Šaiva temples and the latter's productive investment in flourishing guilds indicates the profitable forging of links with the commercial and artisan classes in consonance with contemporary urban development. The Pãáupata sect was highly popular in the Cãhamãna and Guhila kingdoms, Kãmãn and different parts of Rajasthan, holding out the prospect of the attainment of siddhi- s and boons as well as entertaining a liberal attitude towards the lower classes. The Šaivasiddhántins at Rajor were well orgainzed, having interaction with other Šaiva monasteries. The association of the Kãpãlikas with miraculous powers and their disregard for the caste system offered fulfilment both to the mundane aspiration of the masses and the religious needs of the lower classes. 63 Samaraiccakahã. pp .20 1 , 209 ,217. 64 Kuvalayamãla, p. 63. 65 Kuvalayamala .pp . 1 3 1 -3 66 Yašastilaka, VI, 3; cited K.K.
