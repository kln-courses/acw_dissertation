<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS 219 md4, is a hapax leg. whose meaning is clear even if the nuance is not. Brunner cannot avoid a choice, of course, in his translation, and he chooses wisely. The general tone of a work is helpful in such matters. P. Chester Beatty I ('The Contendings'), for instance, is unmistakably playful, but the present texts are seriously ceremonious and religiously austere; and this is confirmed by the representations, although these may be following, as Brunner points out, a slightly different tradition. In some cases Brunner rejects a physical interpretation in the textual narrative; he believes, for instance, that the sentence He surrendered his heart to her (IV D a: sw rdi ibtf rs), while it has a more precise meaning than the modern locution might suggest, since the heart as the seat of being or the hidden core of the person is involved, yet is not to be explained in line with a suggestion mooted by Grapow, that the heart as the source of male semen is intended. In the latter case the sentence would denote the act of sexual union. Brunner is doubtless right in making it refer rather to the god's self-revelation as a divine person, since his first appearance is in the form of the king and since the following sentence is He allowed her to see him in his divineform. He rejects Gardiner's version of a later sentence (After this the Majesty of the God did all he wished with her: Eg. Gr., ? 389, 3), preferring the view of Sethe and others that this is a subordinate clause; both versions are grammatically possible, but a comparison of the form in L enables Brunner to decide convincingly in favour of the second, while resolving also the grammatical difficulty of the demonstrativen being followed by a feminine relative form. His literal version recognizes too an instance of badal-apposition: . . . after this which the Majesty of this God had done, namely everything that he wanted to do with her. He adduces, moreover, a compelling argument from the narrative sequence. The whole commentary is indeed a model of clear and careful exposition. A linguistic feature of these texts is the use of sw sdm.f or sw with the participle (cf. the instance quoted above). It is a narrative form in these examples, denoting a slight advance in the sequence of events. Brunner agrees with Erman, Sethe, and Lefebvre in regarding it as an ancient construction deriving from 'Early Egyptian' (Friihdgyptisch: a phase preceding classical Old Egyptian), but admits that this is only an hypo- thesis. Another archaic feature is the use of the old personal pronoun twt / swt rather than the later ntf. It is not often that one is impelled to disagree with the author's explanations. On p. 43 Jacobsohn's suggestion that the plural in the sentence they found her refers to Amiin and the king is a little too brashly rejected, especially as the text has just mentioned the assumption of the king's form by the god. On p. 5 there is a too easy acceptance of Sethe's claim that the Dramatic Ramesseum Papyrus, 39 refers to the adultery of Osiris and Nephthys. A rigorous examination of linguistic and artistic factors leads Brunner to the conclusion that the origin of the myth goes back to the period before the Fourth Dynasty. Hie demonstrates, further, that the Luxor material is not a copy of that in Deir el-Bahri, and he rejects the view that Hatshepsut used the cycle as propaganda to legitimatize her position. It is only an accident, he urges, that accounts for the full preserva- tion of the cycle in the two known instances. It is a striking fact, which agrees with the posited early origin, that the whole concept is free from Osirian influence. Already in the Fourth Dynasty, however, as Brunner notes, occurs the idea that the king was the son of a god; and the evidence of P. Westcar is given full place. The difficult question of ritual significance is closely examined. Brunner rejects Maspero's view that generation and birth actually took place in these rooms, nor does he accept the suggestion of Daumas that a dramatic representation of the cycle was enacted, although he thinks that this may have happened in the Mammisi of the Graeco-Roman era. He rightly points to the absence of dramatic features in the texts; and he shows that the interrelation of texts and vignettes in the Book of the Dead is somewhat different from the more independent functions of the texts and pictures in this cycle. Here, then, we have mvth divorced from ritual and expressed in a unique double form. Brunner must be congratulated on a masterly study. J. GWYN GRIFFITHS Wandrelief und Raumfunktion in agyptischen Tempeln des Neuen Reiches. By DIETER ARNOLD. Miinchner Agyptologische Studien, ed. H. W. Muller and W. WVestendorf, Bd. 2. Berlin, 1962. Pp. 138, pls. 33. No price given. While this work is based on a dissertation presented at Munich, Dr. Arnold has also embodied in it the results of researches in Egypt, including the examination of wall-reliefs in some temples which have hitherto been unpublished or only partly published.</page><page sequence="2">220 REVIEWS The Egyptian temple is shown to have been regarded as an image of the world, the centre of creation, and as a stage for the cult of the gods. These meanings are expressed by representations and inscriptions which indicate the validity of rites enacted in the past and guarantee, at the same time, through the magic power of the depictions, the temple's efficacy in times of possible ritual neglect. What is implied, it seems, is a meaningful order of representations within the building and the linking of a scene with the place where its action occurs. The representations, accordingly, together with the few building inscriptions, point to the function of the rooms, passages, and halls, and in this study eleven groups of rooms in New Kingdom temples are examined: cult-statue chambers, rooms for barks, offering-table halls, royal funerary offering- rooms, cult-places for the king's statues, purification chapels, chambers for ointments and clothes, treasuries, slaughtering-courts, appearance halls, and festival courts. The author's method in discussing these, one by one, is to give first a descriptive account of his conclusions and then to append a detailed catalogue of the evidence from each temple. His general account naturally refers often to his appended catalogue and also to the useful plans and plates with which the book ends. It is a well-ordered investigation. Some of the plates are not quite adequate because difficulties of lighting were not fully overcome in the photography. One important conclusion reached is that the theme of the temple reliefs is not related everywhere with equal strictness to the ritual function of the place where they occur. The relation is best preserved in the rooms for cult statues and the offering-table halls, where the sacred nature of the objects and rites furthered a correct location of the scenes. In several cases the reliefs refer, not to the room where they occur, but to a neighbouring room; this applies usually to representations in the vicinity of doors and particularly to many depictions of the king. An interesting point emerges with regard to the direction in which the repre- sentations face: the men engaged in ritual activity are shown facing inwards, whereas the deity venerated faces outwards from the temple. A continuous movement can be observed extending from the temple facade to the back wall of the sanctum sanctorum behind the cult-statue, and this stream of figures reveals a sig- nificant trait of Egyptian architecture in the attempt to accompany one who enters the temple and to lead him eventually to the middle point of the building. The rear wall is the point of vision which attracts the eye of the incomer; and here he is told who is the lord of the sanctuary, what king has endowed the building, and in what favour the king consequently stands with the god. There is some variation in the location of gods. Not unnaturally perhaps, the lord of the temple can intrude into reliefs on the rear wall of chapels devoted to subordinate deities; and Amfn can thus intrude even when the temple includes no specific cult of his. An inherent difficulty in this investigation is the initial identification of the several rooms. The criteria are described on p. 5 as consisting of the Egyptian designations, the building-inscriptions, and other descrip- tive texts; but the basic pointer is seen in the content and grouping of the wall-reliefs. This seems a reason- able approach provided one realizes the nature of the underlying assumption in the last statement: it means that from the start there is a disposition to favour a nexus of the room's function with the theme of the wall- reliefs. Inevitably there are occasional doubts even when the criteria are accepted. On p. 17 we are told that Kees designated a certain room (here no. 29 in Plan 15) in the Festival-temple of Tuthmosis III at Karnak as the pr-dwft. Arnold believes it is the cult-statue chamber, arguing that its situation in the temple makes it unsuited to be the pr-dw;t and that, further, the representations of purification form only a small part of the varied scenes depicted, which offer, in fact, a cross-section of numerous rites, but do not belie the function of the room as a cult-statue chamber. It is noteworthy that an argument relating to structural position has been adduced here; actually it figures fairly prominently in the criteria applied and its applica- tion is perhaps too confidently pursued. In the particular instance cited, Arnold may well be right. He must in any case be thanked for a valuable study of a significant theme. In a discussion on p. 109 of the representations of the king smiting his amassed enemies with a club or sword, the possibility is suggested that an ancient rite of human sacrifice is implied. This is obviously hypothetical. Arnold's further remark, that an apotropaic intent is apparent, is in some ways more accept- able. The representations are located on the outer wall near the gate, overlooking the temple court, and these, as Arnold points out, are 'critical places' in a temple, since they are the barriers which separate the ordered cosmos of the gods from the chaos of the surrounding world; they therefore need special protection. The smitten prisoners, however, refer rather to countries outside Egypt, and the increasing importance of such scenes in the New Kingdom, as Arnold goes on to show, probably reflects Egypt's</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS 221 contemporary experiences in war. Through these scenes the king's battle-triumphs are seen to be blessings bestowed by the gods, and the implied link between religion and the nation's military prowess is, of course, a widespread phenomenon. J. GWYN GRIFFITHS Gott und Mensch nach den dgyptischen Tempelinschriften der griechisch-romischen Zeit. Eine Untersuchung zur Phraseologie der Tempelinschriften. By EBERHARD OTTO. Abhandlungen der Heidelberger Akademie der Wissenschaften, Phil.-hist. Klasse. Heidelberg, 1964. Pp. I96. DM 36. Gott und Mensch stands out typographically as the substantive title of this work. As such, of course, it is too expansive, but an accurate complementary description follows. Lest even this might be deemed to be too ambitious a denotation, Professor Otto has added a sub-title, and in his introduction he explains that his study is based on the analysis of a large number of religious phrases and expressions emanating from the temples of the Ptolemaic and Roman eras. The phrases studied are derived mostly from texts relating to cult and ritual, and their selection is based on their relevance to the general theme. It is stressed that an exhaustive record is not intended and that this is not a 'phraseological lexicon of the temple-inscrip- tions'; furthermore, it was not possible to use the recent publications by Junker, Sauneron, and Firchow of texts from Philae, Esna, and Thebes respectively. A considerable range of material has none the less been included, and the results of a detailed study are presented under the headings 'Statements about God', 'Man and the World before Deity', 'The Role of the King', and 'The Idea of God and Cult Reality'. An excursus deals with 'The inter-relation of the polarized concepts wnmt--ibt (right and left eye); nh.h-dt (endlessness and eternity): nySwt-bity (King of Upper Egypt and King of Lower Egypt)'. There is a long (pp. 95-I63) alphabetical compilation of the more common expressions and epithets, followed by a word- index and an autographed hieroglyphic appendix. It is difficult to indicate in a review the usefulness of this wide-ranging study. In essence it is a careful and well-documented compilation which is equipped also with illuminating remarks on a large number of separate items. In addition the author attempts a general synthesis. A strongly anthropomorphic picture of the gods emerges, save that omnipotence, omniscience, and related qualities are often assigned to them. The claim to uniqueness is often ascribed too in expressions like nn wn mity.f, 'his like does not exist'. The formula is used of the king as well, and also of buildings; it is shown to derive from the biographical litera- ture of the Middle Kingdom. It follows that no monotheistic tendency can here be associated with the concept of uniqueness. A constant feature of the treatment is the attempt to correlate and derive the ideas encountered, and in this way the book is much more than a guide to concepts attested in the eras with which it is specifically concerned. Very often there are abundant earlier prototypes. An interesting exception is the idea of a primitive paradise in Edfou, v, 85 which Otto thus translates: 'Ma(at came from heaven to earth. She consorted with all the gods. Nourishment and food were abundant without limitation. There were no evil-doers (isftyw) in this land. The crocodile did not ravage, nor did the serpent bite in the time of the primaeval gods.' Similar allusions were collected by Sethe, Amun und die acht Urgotter von Hermo- polls, 63; cf. Sethe-Firchow, Urk. vIII, 76 and 8I. Otto concludes, 'with all due reserve', that the idea is not of Egyptian origin, and tentatively suggests that there may either be Gnostic influences, with an equa- tion of Ma'at and Sophia, or that Hesiod's scheme of ages may be reflected here. One is reminded of Walcot's thesis that the Instructions of (Onchsheshonqy reflect the influence of the Opera et Dies: see JNES 2i (1962), 215-19; certainly he has discovered some striking resemblances. It may be questioned whether Otto has given proper weight to the early Egyptian ideas of a primitive age of bliss when the gods ruled, notably Horus or Rec.I Whereas the texts of the Graeco-Roman era to which he refers introduce new details into the picture, the contrast between Macat and isft (cf. isftyw in the passage quoted) is as early as Pyr. 1775 b (N); see further Morenz, Agyptische Religion, 121 f. A remarkable feature of the king's role in these inscriptions is his frequent assumption, in certain ritual procedures, of priestly titles, a phenomenon which apparently occurs first in the Ptolemaic era. Otto notes In addition to Grapow, 'Die Welt vor der Sch6pfung', ZAS 67 (93), 34 ff. which Otto cites, cf. F. L. Griffith in Hastings, ERE i (1908), 192 a; J. Gwyn Griffiths, 'Archaeology and Hesiod's Five Ages', Journal of the History of Ideas, 17 (1956), 109-19; R. T. Rundle Clark, Myth and Symbol in Ancient Egypt (London, 1959), 263 f.</page></plain_text>
