Mills: communicated to the International Congress of .Anthropological and Ethnological Sciences, London, 1934 (Compte Rendu, pp. 264-5). It was on a very hot March day in a village of the Ao Naga tribe on the S.E. frontier of Assam that I received a letter from the President of this Section, asking me if I would speak to you briefly on the inter-relation of the ceremonial, industrial and artistic life of the Naga tribes. My inclination was to decline the honour, but he is an old friend and knows my limitations. He knows I am no scholar with a library at my elbow, but an official in charge of a remote area, who can only tell you something of what I have seen every day during the many years I have spent in the Naga Hills. I propose to divide what I have to say into several parts. Firstly, I wish to deal at some length with agriculture and its ceremonies, far the most important aspect of Naga life, secondly with other industries, thirdly with Feasts of Merit and the stimulus they exert, fourthly with head-hunting and its effect on the decorative arts, and, lastly, with the disastrous effects of the beliefs regarding fires and unnatural deaths. 1. Every Naga is an agriculturist and his life depends on what he grows. He lives in a village which is a closely knit community and which acts together in seeking the favour of spirits for the crops of all. The essential act of worship is a day of rest, on which no one is allowed to do any work in the fields at all. At the risk of being rather long, I intend to take you through the whole agricultural year of a typical Rengma Naga village. The details have never been recorded before and there is no other way in which I can so clearly show how the maximum of worship is combined with the minimum of interference with work, which, as every farmer knows, waits for no man. The dates I give are those on which the rest days fell in 1931. It will be convenient if I use the Rengma word kennu for the day of rest. The year opens with kennu days of purification, on January 4th, 6th and 7th. The work of clearing the old jhums of weeds then begins, and on the 15th there is a kennu to prevent fires, of which [ 132 ]</page><page sequence="2">September, 1935.1 MAN [No. 144 there is great risk at this season, and on the 16th another to mark the end of the period during which pots can be made. Then the sowing of millet, the earliest crop, begins and the new jhums are felled, left to dry and burnt. It is a busy time and few days can be spared for kennibs. One is kept on January 21st as a rest from sowing and another on February 10th to bring luck in hunting. In March it is time to think of the rice, a far more important crop than millet, and from the 10th to the 15th are days of kennii and feasting, preparatory to beginning the main work of the year. After this the ground is hoed over and prepared for sowing, which, as one might expect, is preceded by a whole series of kennil days. On the 25th, there is one for the millet, which is sprouting by now, on the 26th one to mark the end of the period during which red dye may be used, on the 27th one to avert any bad luck which might be brought by new shell beads and ivory armlets, which are white, the colour of the dreaded hail, and on the 28th, one to prevent worms in the stomach of cattle from giving rise to grubs on the crops. Finally, there is one on April 1st to mark the beginning of sowing, which goes on for most of the month, interrupted only by kenniis for rest on the 11th and 20th and one for hail on the 16th. On the 25th, kennii is kept for the growing millet and on the 28th another to make rice beer for the series of kenniu days that follow, for the rice is beginning to sprout now and needs special protection. April 30th and May 1st are kennit days on which rice beer is offered to the rice " to keep it damp." On the 3rd, kennii is kept to prevent drought, on the 4th to avert cloudbursts, on the 9th to keep ants away, on the 10th to keep grubs away, on the 14th to keep caterpillars from the blades and on the 16th to keep wire-worms from the roots. The millet is now getting high and on the 20th, kennu is kept and offerings are made to it. On the 24th, kennil is kept for rice pests in general and on the 27th eggs are offered. June is equally full of kennii days. On the 4th a day is kept to prevent the precious crop from being scorched, on the 8th a day for rain, on the 9th a day for fine weather. on the 10th a day to keep rats away, on the 11th a day to keep evil spirits away and on the 13th a day to prevent housewives from being wasteful. At this time every one is busy weeding his crop and in the second half of the month there is only a kenniu for grubs on the 20th and another for ants on the 29th. Jungle grows with amazing speed in Assam, and in July the paths to the fields have to be cleared, that men and spirits may move freely along them. This is done from the 6th to the 13th, during which days all ordinary work in the fields is stopped and the villagers combine a great deal of feasting and jollification with the jungle clearing. Then the weeding of the rice continues with kennvi days only on the 19th for caterpillars, on the 23rd for rats and on the 28th for drought. Only the first half of August is full of kennil days, for by the middle of the month the rice is in the ear and tempting to monkeys and birds. Men therefore cannot afford to stay in the village, but must be down guarding their fields. On the 4th, kennil is kept for rats, on the 6th for evil spirits, on the 7th for gales which would flatten the standing crop, and on the 8th for hail. On the 10th and 11th the good spirits are worshipped and on the 17th, offerings are made for the ears of rice. All that can be done has been done now and harvest is awaited. On September 5th kenni4 is held for the house-spirits and on the 8th to prevent waste. The 10th and llth are kennil days for the solemn eating of the first fruits. On the next day harvest begins and every one is busy till the middle of November. On November 14th kenniu is again observed to stop waste and on the 15th to make thank-offerings to the spirits. Finally, from November 24th to December 5th the whole village gives itself up to the great feast that marks the end of the year's work. If we add up, we find that a village observes about 70 kennil days, but these are so carefully timed that work is never seriously interfered with. It is far different with private ceremonies. A ceremony for illness or a birth in the house may keep a man away from his fields at his busiest time. A death is more serious still. In most tribes, near relations have to refrain from work for anything up to five days, and distant relations for one day. In one group of Memi villages in Manipur State the custom is even more severe. There no one at all in a village may begin sowing till the village has been free from death for a certain number of days. The result is that in an unhealthy spring a series of deaths will drive the impatient villagers almost to desperation and one wonders how the custom can have survived, when the risk of a fatally long postponement of sowing is so great. [ 133 ]</page><page sequence="3">No. 144] MAN [September, 1935. 2. I am afraid I have been very long and detailed but I wished to present to you what I believe to be a new aspect of Naga agricultural life. I can deal with other industries far more briefly and will begin with salt making. All Nagas use salt. Much of it is brought from the plains, but for many purposes salt from their own wells is greatly preferred. These are not numerous and are prized possessions. Yet all villages which own wells do not make salt. For example, the Eastern Rengmas do not. They say they once tested the prohibition and made some, but the crops failed and they never repeated the experiment. They seem to see nothing curious in the fact that other villages can make salt with impunity. Similarly all tribes use earthenware pots, but all tribes do not make them, even if they have the clay on their land. In the huge Ao tribe, for example, the industry is confined to one small section, which traces its descent back to a different stock. Even a Christian Ao who does not belong to that section will not make pots. Even in villages where pots are made they can only be made by women and only in the cold weather between harvest -and sowing. Obviously if pot-making were allowed throughout the year the women would be tempted to neglect their work in the fields. I think, too, that the tapping of the moulding sticks on the clay would be thought to be harmful to the fields, which are always regarded as pregnant between sowing and harvest and easily startled by noises. Again, all Nagas use iron spears, " daos," etc., but only some villages make them, and in places where they are made the industry is often confined to rather despised families. It is an unlucky trade. A smith lives under special tabus and is not allowed to work at all during important village ceremonies. All Nagas wear clothes-though some of them wear rather few! Yet the arts of spinning and weaving are not universal among them and are so strictly confined to women that men usually will not even step over or lay hands on a loom. Some tribes, notably the Eastern Semas, buy all their cloths. They feel vaguely that spinning and weaving would bring bad luck to their villages. A woman, in a village where it is allowed, may spin and weave at any time except during certain ceremonies and when her men-folk are on a raid. If she were to handle thread at such a time they would trip over creepers and fall into the hands of their enemies. A great deal of cotton is dyed, the colours used being almost exclusively dark blue and scarlet. With dark blue there is no great difficulty. Any woman can use it, provided she speaks to no strangers while the thread is in the vat. But scarlet dye, of the colour of blood, is so full of magic that it can only be handled by a few old hags whose continued existence is held to be of no great importance. Even they can only use it in the cold weather between harvest and sowing. In some villages it is not allowed at all, and all red thread has to be bought. 3. It might be thought from what I have said above that Animism as held by the Naga tribes is wholly hampering to industry. This is not so. Certain aspects are most stimulating, notably the system of Feasts of Merit obtaining, with a few unimportant variations, among all tribes. The essence of this system is that every male Naga, if he is to acquire merit and status in this world and the next, must give a series of feasts, every detail of which is strictly prescribed. It probably takes him from youth to middle age to accomplish them. They begin with the sacrifice of a pig and end with that of at least one domestic bison garnished, so to speak, with quantities of cattle and pigs. An immense amount of rice and rice beer is consumed, and more rice than money goes to the buyIng of the animals. The Feasts therefore directly stimulate agriculture. More important still are the privileges they win for the giver. At stated stages in the series he and his wife gain the right to wear special cloths, which increase in splendour and in the elaborateness of their embroidery the further he advances. He is also entitled to embellish his house with carved posts and beams. It is important to remember that, no matter how rich a man may be, he can win the right to these cloths and carvings only by giving the feasts. Therefore a great number of very fine embroidery patterns and carving designs owe their existence entirely to this system of Feasts of Merit and will continue to exist only as long as the system does. To prove this, one has only to stroll through a Christian village. There may be many rich men with granaries bursting with rice, but not a fine cloth or a carving will you see. 4. Very similar is the stimulus afforded by head-hunting. It is the ambition of every Naga to take a, head, not only for the sake of the glory he wins for himself and the magical benefits he confers [ 134 ]</page><page sequence="4">September, 1935.] MAN [No. 144 on his village, but for the sake of the ornaments it entitles him to wear. Head-hunting is not allowed in British territory and the invariable complaint of Nagas living there is " Our ornaments will die out." This, alas, is only too true, for the orniaments which wealth can buy are few compared with those only to be won by the taking of a head and the performance of the ceremonies attendant thereon. I will give a few examples. In most tribes, besides the cloths connected with the Feasts of Merit, there are others which can only be wom after taking a head and yet others which a man may wear only if he has both taken a head and given the full series of feasts and so has reached the pinnacle of earthly success. In particular, in the Konyak tribe certain anthropomorphic designs of great interest can be used only on the haversacks of successful warriors. It is fortunate that most tribes count the killing of a tiger as equivalent to the killing of a man, for this has preserved the peculiar art of painting on cloth practised by the administered Rengmas. Similarly, spear shafts encased in scarlet goats' hair can, in most tribes, be carried by a man who has killed a leopard. But this is not the case with the beautifully made cowrie gauntlets of the Semas, or the superb hornbill feather head-dresses now only worn by a few old Angamis. These are strictly confined to successful warriors. I could give many other examples of dress, but must pass on to carving. Naga carving in the round probably reaches its height in the little wooden heads Konyak warriors wear on their chests. If head-hunting is ever abolished in the tribe, this art will perish with it. Connected too with war are the huge buildings near the gates of villages which serve both as guard- houses and as dormitories for the bachelors. They are the finest buildings Nagas erect and the carvings they contain are very fine. Enemies' heads are stored in them and their decoration is designed to stimulate the budding warrior. When peace is enforced, it is found that they survive for a time as dormitories and as clubs where the senior men sit and talk of the old days. But their life has gone from them and they gradually fall into disuse and disappear. 5. Lastly, there are two other matters I must mention very briefly. The first is the paralysing belief regarding fires. In the spring the jungle is as dry as tinder and people lighting fires are so hopelessly careless that hundreds of square miles are accidentally burnt every year and rendered unfit for cultivation for several seasons, thus seriously aggravating the land shortage. Yet many tribes, notably the Angamis, refuse to demand any fines from the culprits, believing that to accept a fine would appear to the spirits to acquiesce in fires and so be liable to cause more. Other tribes will accept a fine, but regard the money as tainted and bury it outside the village, for use wvhen next they have to pay a fine themselves. Nothing therefore is done to discourage carelessness and the damage goes on year after year. This inertia causes a very serious problem for all w-ho have the welfare of the tribes at heart. With regard to the fires that sweep through the crowded bamboo villages, the situation is equally serious. Instead of combining to pull down houses and so control the fire, every man's first thought is to find an egg to throw into the flames, not to put them out, but to avert the evil from himself. He then postpones pulling his house down till it is too late. Everv village is destroyed sooner or later and the few old ornaments and relics surviving get less every year. Secondly, there is the ritual which has to be followed in the event of an accursed death, that is to say, a death in childbirth or by drowning or other accident. In its strictest form, such as is still followed by the Lhotas, everything the household of the dead man possessed is abandoned. Even coin is thrown on the ground and never touched again; .cattle are left untended in the jungle, or driven over a cliff, and crops are unreaped. There is a strong and very natural tendency to relax these rules, but where they are strictly kept the effect of ritual on industry is as disastrous as it is possible to imagine. To sum up, the evidence seems to show that the routine ritual of the Naga tribes rarely hampers and often stimulates their industrial and artistic life. Even the tabus localizing industries tend to encourage trade. This is what we should expect, for ritual which seriously and constantly dislocates life tends to die out. It is only the ritual connected with extraordinary events that hampers industry and art, and, when it does so, its effect is sometimes even more damaging than the misfortune which called it into play. The object of my paper will have been achieved if my remarks induce others to tell us how things stand in this respect in other parts of the world. J. P. MILLS. [ 135 ]</page></plain_text>
