<plain_text><page sequence="1">A SURVEY OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES IN THE ALTAR VALLEY, SONORA INTRODUCTION The information contained in this paper was obtained in the summer of 1954 when approximately six weeks were spent in the Altar, Sonora, area in the employ of the Amerind Foundation, Inc., under the direction of Dr. C. C. Di Peso. It was hoped that tie-ins could be found in the Altar with material obtained from the Paloparado (Arizona EE: 8: 1) site which Dr. Di Peso was excavating at the time. The Altar Valley was covered from Rancho Arizona and Buisanic in the northeast to the ruins of San Valentin de Bisaini some 15 miles southwest of Caborca. The above does not imply that all sites in the valley were visited, but merely that sample sites in each area were located, visited, and collected from. Archaeological remains are so thickly strewn along the Altar that a really comprehensive survey could hardly be accomplished in less than six months. THE ALTAR VALLEY The Altar River rises in the mountains directly south of the interna- tional boundary a ,few miles west of Nogales. Two branches, the Rio Aquimuri (called also Rio Planchas de Plata upstream) and the Arroyo BAsanic, combine about a mile from Saric to form the Rio Altar. The river flows some 50 miles southwest, hence into the Rio Magdalena below the town of Altar. This stream-variously known as the Rio Caborca, Rio Altar or Rio de la Concepcion-runs into the gulf west of Caborca. Most of the year it is a dry arroyo. From Tubatama south the valley is a desert. North of Tubatama the land rises until above Saric upper Sonoran vegeta- tion appears on the Rio Aquimuri. The natives say that the country has dried out considerably in the last 40 years. The swamps and meadows of Bi6sanic mentioned in the late 1700's in Spanish accounts are now a dissected arroyo (Rudo Ensayo, 1951, p. 12). However, the Altar River still runs today at many points and several beautiful cultivated oases are found. Recently pump irrigation has been introduced on many ranches and a dam has been constructed at Santa Teresa below Tubatama. As a result, much new land has been put under cultivation. This is resulting in the forests of huge mesquite that covered certain areas of the valley being cleared, as well as many archaeological sites on the valley floor being plowed and planted in cotton and wheat. Some of the sites described by Sauer and Brand (1931, pp. 95-100) have disap- peared in this way. The Altar was visited by Sauer and Brand in 1930. They give a good, if somewhat sketchy, account of this area in their survey report. Gladwin previously included the area in his site surveys, but gave it no more than brief mention (Gladwin, 1930, pp. 11-13). [1]</page><page sequence="2">TYPES OF SITES The archaeological remains fall into the following types: 1. Rock trincheras or entrenchments, on the slopes of hills and rock corrales usually located on the summits of hills. 2. Trincheras Purple-on-red pottery sites located on the valley floor or on low mesas overlooking the river. 3. Plainware sites usually on small mesas or terraces overlooking the river. 4. Mission sites of the contact period. Twelve of these were visited and 10 yielded sherd collections. 5. Spanish or early Mexican mining camps. These are apparently con- temporaneous with the missions. 6. Late sites which are evidently recent Papago camps. 7. Pictographs. 8. Petroglyphs. SONORAOOD M -. sJ S 1)E" ..... "..A-h7. .

Map of the Altar Valley, Sonora [21</page><page sequence="3">Sites were located both with the help of local inhabitants and by personal reconnaissance. Some of the local people have a good knowledge of archaeological locations, especially those where visible remains such as rock corrals are encountered. Many, however, do not recognize open cul- ture areas as such. All the many local people dealt with were extremely friendly and anxious to help with any information possible. However, I was accused, half jokingly, half seriously, on several occasions of secretly searching for Spanish treasure. DESCRIPTION OF ALTAR SITES The following descriptions are based on a tentative chronology. Each type of site will be described briefly; and, where it is considered feasible, a sample site from the survey will be cited to illustrate the type. The site numbers are from the Amerind Foundation Museum file. The classification system is the same as that of the University of Arizona save for the last number which indicates the number of the site in the Amerind system. The sherds collected in the survey are housed in the Amerind Foundation Museum. Early Man In the course of the survey no conclusive evidence of early man was discovered. It may be noted that though projectile points were often picked up, none of the Pinto-like types so common to the northwest in the western Papagueria were found (Ezell, 1954, pp. 6-13). Only three points that resembled San Pedro types were seen, all in association with rock corrales. Trincheras Pottery Villages Probably the most abundant archaeological remains throughout the Altar Valley are those containing Trincheras Purple-on-red pottery (Sauer and Brand, 1931, pp. 107-110). This pottery was found abundantly along the Altar from Rancho Rodeo and Brisanic above Saric to La Calera west of Caborca. The heaviest concentration of sites, as well as the richest sites, was encountered from La Pera above Tubatama south to the town of Altar. They appear on the valley floor or on the lower terraces overlooking both sides of the river. Collections were made at 14 pure sites of this type while Trincheras Purple-on-red sherds were found in nearly all areas visited. The remains on the valley floor are characteristically covered with silt and consist of numerous fist-sized cracked boulders strewn over eroding surfaces accompanied by Trincheras Purple-on-red and occasional polychrome Trin- cheras sherds. Where there has been no other occupation or disturbance, these sites are remarkably pure in that almost no intrusive pottery occurs. In some of the large sites the pottery is nearly 100% Trincheras. Shell fragments are abundant with Glycymeris and Cardium bracelet fragments common at all ruins. Glycymeris shell bracelet blanks appear around Altar and at the Boquillas site at La Playa (Sauer and Brand, 1931, pp. 91-94). Schist rasps accompany these blanks. Marine worm casings as well as Conus tinklers and Olivella shell beads are common in the surface debris. Stone tools include round felsite Hohokam-style hammerstones, me- tates and manos, as well as smaller flat stone bowls of a square shape. [31</page><page sequence="4">Points found were often crude with shallow to absent side notches and 1 to 11/2 inches in length. However, several finely-chipped points were also seen. Material for points is chert, obsidian, and quartz. Other stone ar- tifacts include a schist toothed saw found near Atil and a paint palette from the Contreras site at La Pera. I was shown long, finely-made pestles, a stone ring, and decorated "arrow shaft straighteners" by local rancheros which may or may not have originated in these sites. The axes were three-quar- ter grooved and the majority had raised ridges around the groove. They were characteristically of extremely fine workmanship, well polished, and of greenish felsite. Malacates or hand modeled spindle whorls came from this type of ruin at the Contreras site at La Pera and from Sonora F:6:5 near Oquitoa. The sites of this type on the mesas overlooking the river produce the same artifacts. Some of these have dim rows of stones, apparently wall outlines. These appear to be square. An example of a Trincheras Purple-on-red pottery site is Sonora F:6:5 which is 1.3 miles north of Oquitoa, Sonora. The area is situated on a 30-foot-high mesa rising from the east bank of the Altar River. The culture area stretches some 200 yards up the mesa, probably covering in all about five acres. Two cone-shaped hills rise some half a mile to the east. These are terraced with rock trincheras (Sonora F:6:6) and contain plain pottery with only a very rare Trincheras sherd. There is a sterile area of several hundred yards between the mesa site and the trincheras. Artifacts 1 large, flat, rectangular biface mano. 1 unnotched, white chert projectile point, 1 inch in length. 2 rounded felsite hammerstones. 1 fragment of a polished 3/4 grooved axe. 1 clay malacate. Pottery Trincheras Purple-on-red, 86% plain, 111/2% painted, both specular and non-specular paint. Trincheras Polychrome 21/2 %. Shell 1 Glycymeris bracelet fragment. Miscellaneous shell fragments. Hou.we Types Dim lines of river stone; these are probably jacal outlines. The earth is permeated with ashes in several parts of the area. No other evidence of structures was observed. Plainware Sites Eleven of these sites were located. The same artifact and pottery com- plex also appeared at the five rock trincheras and rock corrals collected from, hence I feel that these stone works probably belong to the same period. All open sites of this type were located on small mesas or river ter- races on both sides of the Altar River. [4]</page><page sequence="5">Trincheras pottery is all but absent, being replaced by late Gila Plain and a hand-finished plain ware. A type that appears related to Sells Red appears in some of these sites. Shell is represented by Glycymeris bracelets, Conus beads, and Olivella shell beads. Stone points were triangular and not notched or were concave based. Both slab and basin metates were seen. Large, rectangular, biface manos as well as small, flat, discoidal ones were in evidence. All metates seen on these sites had been broken. Fragmcnts of cremated human bone appear in these sites. Sr. Luis Lopes of Altar showed me a plainware olla filled with burned human bones he had excavated from Sonora F:5:2 adjoining the Altar airstrip. This type of cremation is also reported from Cerro Las Huertas (Sonora F:2:3) near Atil where gambucinos or small-scale placer miners are said to have unearthed olla cremations. Dim lines of stone in both squares and circles were visible at some of these sites. At Rancho Basanic (Arizona DD:15:6) a definite mound containing several rooms and several smaller detached square room outlines of stone appeared, along with the characteristic plainware pottery. This site yielded a Topawa Red-on-brown sherd and two Tanque Verde Red-on- brown sherds, one of the rare cases of these types appearing in the Altar Valley. Rock trincheras or "entrenchments" are found on practically every suitable hill in the Altar country. They have been well described by Sauer and Brand (1931, pp. 67-70) and others so a description will not be re- peated here. The corrales de piedra or rock corrals are evidently contemporaneous with the hillside trincheras. They are located on hill tops and high out- crops throughout the Altar area. The usual construction is large volcanic boulders piled one on top of another. No evidence of mortar is visible. They range in size from about 20' x 20' to as large as 60' x 60', or possibly even larger, and up to 6' in height. All visited were square, except for some smaller round structures on the edge of a mesa at Rancho Arizona (Arizona DD:16:1). Vaqueros told of other torreones or round rock corrals on the hills of the upper Altar. Excellent examples of a square rock corral can be seen on the top of Cerro La Aurora at La Pera and on the summit of Cerro Prieto de Babocomari between Saric and Tubutama. These corrales de piedra extend at least as far downstream as Cerro La Calera west of Ca- borca. Various other stone walls of the same construction are encountered on other hills. One such wall 6 feet high cuts off the approaches to Cerro Prieto de Babocomari from the east. The west face has been filled in, leav- ing the wall facing the east. Another such wall a few hundred feet far- ther up the tongue of the mesa affords additional protection. Pottery is thickly strewn over the areas of the trincheras and the rock [5]</page><page sequence="6">corrals. It is overwhelmingly of plain type with late Gila Plain and the hand-finished plain ware, "Altar Plain," found at the other plainware sites predominating. A very occasional sherd of Trincheras ware is picked up on these sites. However, as these hillsides often support thick growths of pitaya, the organ pipe cactus, the Trinucheras ware may well be the result of earlier fruit-gathering expeditions. Three rock trincheras and four rock corrals were collected from, and numerous others were observed from a distance. As an example of a plainware site, (Sonora F:5:2), which I have called the Lopez site, seems fairly typical of the majority. It is located 1.5 miles southwest of Altar, Sonora, adjoining the Altar airstrip. The culture area is situated on a mesa above the river on the north side of the Rio Altar. The site covered some five acres. Pottery Fairly abundant. Of 116 sherds collected: Late Gila Plain 98% Trincheras Plain (doubtful) 2% The olla of cremated bones mentioned above came from this site. Shell A fragment of a Glycymeris bracelet. Stone 1 rectangular biface mano 18" x 4". Fragments of slab metates. 1 pierced slate disk. 1 green steatite bead. It may be significant that these sites appeared especially abundant in close proximity to what later became mission locations such as at Saric, Tubutama, Atil, and Buisanic, but in most places were not mixed with mis- sion remains. I believe they may be pre-contact Pima, later than the Trin- cheras pottery culture though possibly with some overlap and continuing up into contact times. It appears likely that the rock trincheras were constructed by these people. The belief that these sites run into contact times is strengthened by the fact that this type of sherd and artifact com- plex, except for cremated bones, is the only one in evidence at Santa Ger- trudis de Saric built in 1702. Contact Sites - Mission Settlements Twelve mission sites were visited of which 10 yielded sherd collections. The fact that the missions were located at points of optimum population and were probably favorite dwelling places for centuries previous leaves a great confusion of debris in each of these locations. Pottery at the old mission town of Saric, for example, ranges from early Gila Plain through Trincheras Purple-on-red, Tanque Verde Red-on-brown, late Gila Plain, Whetstone Plain, Papago Red, Spanish and Mexican glazes into modern china. The church itself has had several locations in the past, so instead of one ruined mission, another, and even two previous groups of supposed mission ruins are pointed out by the Sariqueiios. [6]</page><page sequence="7">Four of the Altar churches are still in use. These are at Tubutama, Oquitoa, Pitiquito, and the church at the Pueblo Viejo de Caborca. Others such as San Bernardo de Aquimuri, Santa Gertrudis de Saric, and a site near the Cerro Prieto at Caborca pointed out as the original Jesuit mission are now almost obliterated. The walls of Santa Teresa below Tubutama stand today in a cotton field, while the mission walls at Atil are still stand- ing but rapidly disintegrating. Los Dolores de Saric is an extensive group of mesquite-grown mounds on the edge of Saric, pocked here and there by the pits of treasure seekers. San Valentin de Bisini serves as a cemetery for the present-day Papago. The ruins of San Bernardo de Aquimuri at Rancho de los Nopales is also used as a campo santo by the present inhabitants. San Valentin de Bisdni (Sonora E:7:2) This is a good example of an Altar mission site. These ruins are lo- cated on a desert flat on Rancho Bisini owned by Alejandro Contreras of Caborca. San Valentin is approximately 15 miles southwest of Caborca, Sonora. It is probably the least disturbed of all mission sites in the Altar and has a great wealth of debris. The site dates from Jesuit days. The main church walls stand to a height of about 10 feet at one spot. The rooms now contain Papago graves and there is a small Papago shrine in the ruins where candles are burned. There are four mounds north of the church. These are only a few inches in height but are heavily strewn with pottery and other debris. One of these reveals the outlines of a square structure. The construction is adobe and mescal. Pottery Sherds are extremely abundant over an area of about three acres. Of a random sample, the following percentages occurred: Oquitoa Red-on-brown Oquitoa Plain 1 77% Late Gila Plain (stoned) 18% Papago Red 3.5% Sells Red 1% Altar Plain (hand finished) .5% The names of some of these types are explained under the section on ceramics. In addition, Spanish green glazes as well as olive glazes, white glazes, and china of undetermined age appear on the site. However, these Euro- pean and Mexican wares are much in the minority. Shell Shell of several species is very abundant. Cardium, Conus, Olivella, Glycymeris, Oliva, and several unidentified species occur. Several whole specimens of Conus were picked up. Stone 1 ungrooved felsite axe, apparently unfinished. [7]</page><page sequence="8">Flat, discoidal manos. 25 obsidian or white chert points. Most of these were triangular or concave based, unnotched, .5 to 1.5 inches in length. Spanish Artifacts 1 lead seal, age undetermined. Spanish Mining Camps Evidence of early mining activity is plentiful in the upper Altar. Buried brick walls of what the natives say are carboneros or smelters were pointed out at Rancho Arizona, Saric, and Santa Teresa. Other Spanish mining camps are reported at Sombreretillo and on the slopes of Cerro Santa Teresa. Fragments of slag, apparently of silver ore, are common around all the upper Altar missions. At Saric a graphite crucible, evidently a smelter tool, was obtained from a Sariquefio who reported it was un- earthed by treasure seekers in the ruins of Los Dolores de Saric. Except for slag and brick fragments and occasional plainware sherds, these mining sites have little else observable on the surface. It should be mentioned that the people of the Altar have innumerable stories of lost Spanish mines and buried treasure. One of these tales, the story of the Jesuit treasure of Saric, "once millones de pesos duros," has re- sulted in the development of several avid treasure hunters among the Sari- quefios. The result is many gaping excavations in the ruins of the old church and muralla or fort. Papago Camps The latest in the four periods of Altar archaeological chronology is represented by sites which appear to be Papago camps. Four definite and one probable sites of this type were located. Those visited contained sparse sherds of Papago Red or late Gila Plain or sherds of slipped and polished red bowls. A few stones were scattered about. Glycymeris and Cardium shell fragments, chert and obsidian chips, an occasional unnotched point, and small one-handed biface manos complete the artifact assemblage. Two of these sites were on the playas between Caborca and Bisini, an area which still has Papago inhabitants. According to local people the Papago came to Saric and other Altar towns yearly up until about 40 years ago to trade, work in the fields, or to gather pitaya. An olla was seen at Altar and another at Caborca which were pointed out as "miel de pitaya ollas" and which had been found in old Papago camps. They were narrow-necked plain ware with fireclouding. A similar specimen from near Saric, however, was decorated in sloppily painted red scrolls. This vessel, 20 inches high and 15 inches in diameter, was unearthed with six others at Rancho de los Nogalitos downstream from Saric. Pictographs PRctographs were observed at two points on the Rio Aquimuri above Saric. No clues were found as to their creators other than a few late Gila Plain sherds at one of the sites (Arizona DD:15:9) located on Ran- cho Rodeo between Saric and Rancho Arizona. These were painted in black paint on the face of a cliff adjoining the river. [8]</page><page sequence="9">Another group, called "cara pinta" locally, is 3.4 miles up the Rio Aquimuri from Saric. These were figures in red, black, and white paint on a cliff immediately adjacent to the river. These groups consisted of animal figures and geometric designs. Petroglyphs Extremely elaborate petroglyphs were seen at La Calera (Sonora E: 8:5) and at Cerro La Provedura (Sonora E:8:2), both west of Caborca. These contain anthropomorphic and zoomorphic as well as geometric figures. Mazes and circles are common. Cerro La Calera has especially extensive "monos" or figures on the rocks. Many others are reported by the vaqueros near Atil, near Oquitoa, at the Cerro Prieto at Caborca, in the vicinity of Altar, and at Cerro de los Monos in the Papagueria northwest of Caborca. CERAMICS Altar pottery could probably all be classified under the Sonora Brown Ware group (Ezell, 1954, p. 16). Several types were collected in the survey which show affiliations with previously known types, but which show differences in such items as temper, paste, and finish. The following is a very rough account of the types found. Some are undescribed or are being described at present. Until they are adequately described, only a sketchy account of them can be given. The names of the previously un- named types are tentative and are mentioned here only for convenience. 1. Trincheras Purple-on-red (including unpainted sherds of the same ware). Abundant at Trincheras pottery sites. Both specular and non- specular types of paint were used. 2. Trincheras Polychrome. Found at 6 sites, not plentiful anywhere. The Contreras site (Sonora F:3:4) at La Pera above Tubutama yielded the greatest percentage of polychrome sherds, a little over 2%. 3. Late Gila Plain. Common in nearly all sites except in the large Trin- cheras ware sites. Here it was sparse or even absent, being replaced by undecorated Trincheras ware. 4. "Altar Plain," a hand-finished plainware. Resembles Ramanote Plain but is more micaceous. This type is very abundant in the predomi- nately plainware sites. 5. "Oquitoa Plain," a very hard, thin ware with a gray core, tan to brick colored, and stoned. Oquitoa Plain was found at mission sites from Saric to Bisini. This type was especially plentiful at the site of San Antonio de Oquitoa and at San Valentin de Bisini where, with Oquitoa Red-on-brown, it comprised 77% of the sherds. The other missions yielded a few such sherds each. 6. "Oquitoa Red-on-brown." This appears to be the decorated variety of Oquitoa Plain. The decoration consists of rather crude red lines 1/8 to 1/6 inch in width, and occasional dots. Many are bowls which have a flat fillet rim of from 1/2 to 1 inch in width. Its nearest affiliate is evidently Papago Red-on-brown. [91</page><page sequence="10">7. "Altar Red." This is evidently affiliated with Sells Red. It is a highly polished, slipped red, often thin. Many are bowls. 8. Peck Red. This appears in several sites, especially on the extreme up- per reaches of the Altar. 9. Sherds of several unidentified types of unpolished but lightly stoned red appear at the sites on the upper Altar. These account for 14.3% of the sherds at Arizona DD: 15:6 Buisanic. Intrusives Intrusives are scarce throughout. Those found in prehistoric sites are exclusively from the upper reaches of the river. 1. Tanque Verde Red-on-brown. Five of these sherds appeared at (Ari- zona DD:15:6) B6isanic and two at the Saric mission ruins. 2. Topawa Red-on-brown. One sherd was picked up at (Arizona DD:15:6) Buisanic. 3. Whetstone Plain (Sobaipuri Fillet Rim). A few sherds were picked up at Saric, Santa Teresa, and Oquitoa missions. 4. Thin striated sherds of a type found on the Seri coast. Three of these turned up at Santa Teresa Mission. 5. One sherd of paddle-marked pottery came from the sherds collected at the Oquitoa Mission. The large mission sites also produced a few sherds each of Spanish green glazes, olive glazes, white glazed ware, Mexican brown and red glazes, and china of unidentified age. Occasional sherds of Mexican wheel-turned pottery came to light in the areas of the old church settlements. SUMMARY The results of the survey seem to indicate that four periods can be segregated from the archaeological remains of the Altar area. 1. The Trincheras Purple-on-red culture sites. These apparently rep- resent a very extensive occupation of the valley floor and mesas overlooking the river. Trincheras pottery, 34-grooved polished axes, shell bracelets, paint palettes, elaborate arrow straighteners, stone bowls, stone rings, mala- cates, and probably cremation burials make up part of this cultural com- plex. In addition, late Gila Plain and a hard-finished plainware appear. This period is probably contemporaneous with the Hohokam between 700 and 1200 A.D. 2. Plainware sites with late Gila Plain pottery, shells, steatite beads, cremation burials, 3-grooved axes, small obsidian and chert points, and square stone room sites. These people were likely the builders of the rock trincheras. This period probably represents early Pima and runs into the contact period. Some could, however, date earlier than the trincheras sites. 3. Contact sites. These are Spanish missions. Gila and "Altar" plain- ware continues. "Oquitoa Plain" and "Oquitoa Red-on-brown" appear [10]</page><page sequence="11">and become the most common wares at Oquitoa and Bisini. Spanish wares are in evidence. Shell bracelets and abundant use of shell continue, as well as the 3/4-grooved axe. The points are now triangular and unnotched. Fruitful research could probably be done in sites of this period. Com- parison could then be made of the cultures of Jesuit with later Franciscan periods. 4. Recent Papago camps. These sites are probably of the 19th and early 20th centuries. Shell fragments and triangular points are still com- mon. There are large ollas, some with narrow necks. There is undoubtedly considerable artifact overlap in each of these periods. This is easily imagined in observing the modern Mexican inhabit- ants of the area using prehistoric stone axes to pulverize their camne seca or jerky. Small prehistoric stone bowls and pestles are prized as chile grinders. Nearly every household keeps its drinking water in hand-made ollas, much like the Papago ollas but made today by Mexican women. The potters use stone axes to crush their clay on salvaged Indian metates. Pitaya, tunas, pechita, and pinole are still gathered or made in the old ways. In such cir- cumstances of re-use the artifacts invariably become mixed. BIBLIOGRAPHY REFERENCES CITED Di Peso, Charles C. The Sobaipuri Indians of the Upper San Pedro Valley, Southwestern Arizona.

Hinton Tucson, Arizona MUSEUM NOTES Although summer is traditionally a "slow" time in Tucson, the past one was anything but that at the Museum. Five new wall cases, which will house Mexican exhibits, were built in the north mezzanine (part of the long-range modernization program). In addition, a new display case was constructed in the lobby and is now filled with an attractive array of wares which may be purchased at the sales desk. Included are publications on Indians and the Southwest, decorative tiles, bronze reproductions of mam- moths and other prehistoric animals that lived in Arizona during early Cochise culture times, silk screen prints of sandpaintings and Indian design motifs, stationery and greeting cards. In order to fill the minds of sweltering Tucsonans with cooling thoughts, a display of Eskimo clothing and artifacts was arranged in the northeast alcove. Part of this display, including a ten-foot polar bear skin, spilled over into other parts of the Museum. The Eskimo materials are on loan from Mr. Robert Shankel, who spent a year among the natives of Cape Prince of Wales making a moving picture of their daily activities. The exhibit gives one a renewed admiration for the Eskimo and his adaptation to a rigorous environment. The clothing points this up espe- cially. Certain boots are worn for cold dry weather; others for wet, slushy weather. Harpoon points and knives are highly specialized-each type fashioned to perform its task with a minimum of time and effort. Finally, the beautiful carvings in modern and fossil ivory are convincing evidence of the artistry and love of beauty of these sturdy people. Museum acquisitions during the past six months have been numerous and varied. They include Paleolithic stone tools from a cave in Israel; prehistoric clay figurines from Guerrero, Mexico; quartzite tools from an [12]</page></plain_text>
