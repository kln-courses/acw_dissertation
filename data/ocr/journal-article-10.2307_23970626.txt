<plain_text><page sequence="1">ZwischenZwischen Hebraischer Bibel und Altem Testament. Eine EinfuhrungEinfuhrung in die Septuaginta. By Folker Siegert. Pp. viii+342. (Munsteraner Judaistische Studien, 9.) Munster: Lit. Verlag, 2001. isbn 3 8258 5012 9. Paper €25.90. SiegertSiegert bemoans the lack of a German-language introduction to the Septuagint, a lack felt all the more keenly in the land of the great Septuaginta-Unternehmen. The particular interests and detailed specialisms of scholarship in Hebrew Bible, early Judaism, and early Christianity, have led to a situation where the Septuagintal wood can no longer be seen for the trees. What he offers here is not so much fresh presentation of a researched discipline, as practical aid for Septuagint users. Siegert has a flair for epitomizing quotation; and he has assembled a wealth of information in this modest but far-reaching and suggestive handbook. The treatment of so many topics in relatively small compass is both interesting and competent throughout (all the more surprising to find Josh. 9:2a-f, in fact identical to MT 8:30-35, described as additional material in LXX). His presentation of LXX as the first great text in a modern language likens the recipe for its success to that of modern English: its combination of a large vocabulary with simple syntax. The range of the work is best suggested by sketching the contents of the six main sections: 1. name, origin, and attestation of the Septuagint (Septuagint as overall title; translations in antiquity and Greek as target language; the legendary origin according to the Letter of Aristaeus; the development of the legend and the dogma of inspiration; the identity of the translators, their time and place; the naming and order of the books; and variations in order, extent, and counting); 2. the long</page><page sequence="2">196 REVIEWS way to the original text of the Septuagint (inner-Greek errors in transmission; approaches to the underlying pre-masoretic text; earlier shorter versions [Jeremiah, Job]; one original text or more; the problem of revisions, Jewish and Christian; manu scripts and editions); 3. the Septuagint as translated output: language and style (translating and interpreting; oral tradition in lieu of a lexicon; translation technique; the normative influence of the Pentateuch; the requirement of correctness; primary and secondary doublets; coping with wordplay and poetry; Egyptian colouring; errors in translation); 4. coping with names: transcription, translation, and replacement (Hebrew names in Greek transcription; from YHWH to Kyrios; epithets of the one God; names of gods, persons, peoples, places, and cultic objects); 3. translation trends in the Septuagint, particularly concepts (the comparability and incomparability of two languages; equating words; simplification and rearrangement—cultic vocabulary and the concept 'sin'; coping with metaphors; modernisation and avoidance of anthropomorphism; modification of Greek concepts and avoidance of expressions current in Hellenism; rare exp ressions and fresh coinages; transcription in lieu of translation); 6. translating and editing (interventions in the wording of the Pentateuch, with excursuses on redefinition of chronology, and on eschatology and messianism in the Septuagint; redactional issues from the narrative books and the prophets; the art of small correction—the translation of the Psalms; adaptation by expansion in the hagiographa; and Daniel and 1(3) Ezra: two remountings and their reacceptance). A seventh section, on the reception of the Septuagint, is promised in a further volume. A. Graeme Auld A. Graeme Auld</page></plain_text>
