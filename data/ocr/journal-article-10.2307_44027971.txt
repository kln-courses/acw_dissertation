Among those in opposition was one person who regretted the misfortune that works so unsuited to their purpose should be so durable and per- manent. A respected local architect made the common complaint that by the time Butterfield undertook his major works at Rugby (between 1867 and 1885) his early creative genius had burned out, so he had repeated the same building with only a little variation in its dressing. The headmaster echoed another commonplace cri- tique, offering that Butterfield was simply a church architect inept in his handling of domestic buildings. But John Summerson spoke persuasively in favour, describing the architect as an 'unfathom- able individualist' whose 'towering and deeply expressive' buildings were portraits of the unique character of his age, in their earnest- ness, efficiency and grandeur. Then, somewhat rashly, he closed with the shockingly inflammatory words 'a magnificent Victorian monument', thereby ensuring the motion was roundly defeated, by 75 votes to 45. It has been a long time since we have scorned the idea of the 'monument', or have been offended by 'magnificence', or equated the idea of the 'Victorian' with a dark, sexless, moralistic and for- bidding world. Where once our view of its vaunted probity might have been filtered through Lytton Strachey's characterisation of the false sincerity of its illustrious men, or Steven Marcus's 1960s por- trayal of a society assiduously concealing a life of vice, our present understanding, or misunderstanding, of the Victorian age is more complex, subtle and inflected. We now look upon that near-century as varied and changeable. Yet Butterfield - the most essential, con- sistent and original of its major architects - remains a contentious monolith. With one or two clichéd images in mind, his work is still debated in much the same terms as it was by the Rugby schoolboys in 1961. He seems frozen mid-nineteenth century, standing for dia- pered brick churches, for a strange contradiction between the gar- ish and the ascetic, for the first flowering of Anglo-Catholicism and for a sort of insular, anti-intellectual brand of Englishness. His work is still seen as something freakish and eccentric that always - even to his greatest admirer, the odd and errant poet Gerard Manley Hopkins - 'errs on the side of oddness'. In fact, Butterfield worked largely in stone, rather than in brick. He travelled on the Continent for six weeks every other year, studying every early fresco in sight and spending days measuring and drawing churches and their details - that is, when he wasn't taking tutorials in Italian irregular verbs. All the same, his secular and domestic works outnumber his ecclesiastical spaces. And far from burning out by the time of his work at Rugby, the 1870s and early 1880s were the produc- tive height of his career. Tiny village schools, minor estate buildings, modest parsonages, quiet collegiate residences and humble cottages run alongside his monumental works throughout his life. Above all, his old-fashioned high-church principles were grounded not in what he scorned as the false emphasis on private devotions, on represen- tational sacred art or on 'feelings' and 'fancy rituals' revived by the Anglo-Catholics of the 1850s, but in the idea of a national congregation of all estates join- ing together in equality to rehearse with pre- cision the ancient English rites of common worship. His was an apostolic and apocalyp- tic vision of Christianity, where the founding of the church was the central historical event, with faith in its creed and authority being the obligation of the present, and the coming judgement the promise of the future. In this scheme of things, the English church was the true bearer of his nation's history and the principal guardian of a sober, distinctive and harmonious English society, while its parishes and landed patrons, its schools, colleges, charities and hospitals were the sole agents of a moral agenda for national education and 'social improvement'. All of this was clearly expressed in Butterfield's scrupulous obedience to ancient rubrics relating to the pattern, symbols and performance of the liturgy in the plans of his churches, in the adherence to precedent and creed that governed his approach to their decoration, and in the absolute denial of all earthly hierarchies that he wrought into their spatial sequence, their entry points and their progressions of light, so that only the boundaries between the worldly and the divine were evident. But it appears just as emphatically in the apparently secular aspects of his work, not least its extraordinary economy. Everything is intended as the visible expression and instrument of a particular sense of England, to be both preserved and advanced by the English church and its allied institutions. Butterfield's is in every sense a missionary architecture. He cali- brates the placement and proportions of bell tower, porch and entry gate to landmark the parish church as exactly and emphatically as possible, varying each element to meet the different scales and order of town, suburb or village. His charitable homes, seminar- ies, schools, hospitals and colleges all carry into modern language, often to extraordinary height and scale, the syntactic odour of the medieval monastery and lay communities - a language enriched through his lifelong work at the hostels of St Nicholas on Salisbury Close and St Cross in Winchester. That medieval vernacular, often at its stoniest, most archaic and English, is just as potent in his cot- tage rows, his little parish and national schools, his schoolmaster's houses and village parsonages, even his great country house at Milton Ernest Hall. All are planned to a moral scheme of domestic life or childhood experience, incisively efficient, economical and modern. But inscribed in the landscape with a deep feeling of per- manence, they echo with the distant strains of continuity. As for magnificence and gaudiness, most is not of Bufterfield's making. Unlike his contemporaries, writes Henry-Russell Hitchock, Butterfield was a pragmatist. He refused to fly buttresses or lace vaults that bore no relation to structure. His buildings feature no carved capitals, no terracotta reliefs and no gargoyles. In an expan- sive age he left room for accretion, either by avoiding the overween- ing symmetries that might prevent it or by planning his designs in phases. And while Butterfield's plans were dictated by liturgy, they took shape through his adept deployment of modern technologies. In an age of steam and smoke, he welcomed ornament manufac- tured in tile, iron or glass. Rather than applying colour he built it into the fabric of his work. He designed gas lights for his churches, invented simple beam systems to hold up a great roof, measured the 74 AA FILES 73 Don't you dote upon the Middle Ages, Mr Corker?... Such charming times!...

Above all, he matched design and material to cost, availability, tim- ing and the builder's skills. Only ten years after that debate at Rugby, Paul Thompson took Summerson - and Nikolaus Pevsner - to task for the way they had tried to rehabilitate Butterfield with their rather backhanded praise of 'ugliness' and, through his own exhaustive catalogue and analysis of Butterfield's work, laid the foundation for a less glib and reflex- ive appreciation of his genius. With this knowledge in hand, then, why do we continue to look at Butterfield as Norman Shaw did - as a lone idiosyncratic artist going up an unfamiliar inlet 'on a boat of his own'? As early as 1951, Pevsner himself had ventured two reasons for our inability to 'assess values' in high Victorian architecture, or to look at it with a discriminating eye: 'lack of knowledge and lack of accepted criteria'. The mistakes we still make no longer arise for want of available knowledge, but the curious absence of criteria remains. At least two almost accidental obstacles stand in the way of a more generous, informed and open reading of Butterfield and his work. One is Balliol College Chapel (1857), a much-derided and conspicu- ous attempt to follow Ruskin's recommendation to build in bands of highly finished, highly coloured stone. (This is perhaps the only building where Butterfield strays so far from his usual precedents as to reach a kind of exotic territory.) The second is the too-famous London church of All Saints, Margaret Street (1850-59), intended as the beacon of the Ecclesiological Society and extravagantly funded by members and the imperious political patron Beresford Hope. The interiors were flamboyantly decorated in an attempt to revive the church fresco, first in a figurative and narrative manner that Butter- field never approved and later in more egregious redecorations of its walls. Though he continued to love the asymmetry of the massing of All Saints and its constructive details - as evidenced by the drawings that hung forever after behind his desk - and supplied new instru- ments and furniture whenever asked, Butterfield spent most of his life avoiding such showy rituals and gaudy scenes. The reasons for eschewing such ostentation are not, however, explained in any journal or notebook. Unlike most illustrious Vic- torians, Butterfield left no volume of recollections, nor did friends and family choose to publish a traditional memoir. His drawings and papers are scattered. Notoriously reclusive and secretive, he gave no lectures, refused to attend his riba gold medal ceremony and never, from 1844 onwards, exhibited drawings at the asso- ciations. In his most productive later years he refused to approve printed illustrations of new work, not only because these black- and-white reproductions eliminated the colour that was so essen- tial to the designs, but also because it was not in his 'disposition' to see his work presented in those forms. But while his built work covers ground in every corner of England, as well as Scotland and Ireland, New Brunswick, Melbourne, Cape Town, even Madagascar, much of it has been mangled by time. Between the Luftwaffe, devel- opers, school modernisers and church refits, many of his finest urban works have been destroyed, demolished or totally disfigured - including six London churches and chapels, as well as major parish churches in Newbury, Leeds and Portsmouth, the spg Offices Viollet- le-Duc so admired, and his only London con- vent hospital. Gaslight fumes and city fog have darkened the polychrome brickwork rather than softening it, as intended. The careful calibration of light in a number of churches is now distorted, either by intensely coloured memorial windows or the mania for adding a clerestory. Butterfield was ruthless in his adherence to uncluttered space and lucid sequence in the planning of his churches, drawing people in through a simple gate or shelter, welcoming them in a space of wide simplicity under a high-beamed roof, seating them communally and low, and then focusing all their attention on a very gradually raised square-ended sanctuary, a sort of glowing treasure chest that was designed to 'speak only of heaven and of the risen and glorified'. Indeed, this relentless approach to the vista of the chancel left even his friends at the Ecclesiological society askance. But empty space, the great feature of his sacred work, is now routinely disguised by the accretion of furniture, monuments, figurative sculptures, stations of the cross, banners, screens, roods, embroideries and decoration. But in addition to these architectural anomalies, there is a funda- mental obstacle to a fair and complete understanding of this pillar of Victorian architecture, in the form of Paul Thompson's 1971 mono- graph itself. Though profoundly informed and exhaustive in its exca- vation of the corpus, the book is constructed in topical segments that scatter different elements of the life and projects across 500 pages, making it difficult to trace the arc of his career or follow the narrative of each work. Its illustrations, almost entirely black-and- white photographs, are didactic rather than evocative and include none of the colour working drawings that most truthfully - and often most seductively - present the ideas. Apart from its essential dis- cussion of the Oxford movement and Butterfield's patronage, and a glance at his 'influence', much of the essential context is also miss- ing. For 50 years, Butterfield was building in an era of rapidly accel- erating urbanisation and social, political and technological change. To understand his work, then, we need to chart it chronologically, alongside these changes - alongside the growth and new character of the railway towns, resorts and suburbs in which much of his work was made, for example; or the disruption of inner-city suburbs (the locations of his London churches) as the merchant and professional classes moved out and the infrastructure of railways and goods dis- tribution came in; or the effect of the great Whig church reforms and the growth of national schools, to which his parsonages and schools were essential; or the epidemics and urban distress that led him to his long study of cemeteries and funeral practice; or the efforts to develop hygienic means of rehousing the rural population, to which his cottage groups so signally contributed. There were vast changes, too, that were specific to the construction industry. The telegraph and the penny post, improved canals and express trains made it pos- sible for an architect to take on and supervise work further afield. At the same time he no longer had to rely on local suppliers of bricks or stone, and could assign work in one city (as Butterfield did at Keble) to a builder from another (Rugby), or treat a favoured contractor, like Joseph Norris in the southwest, as a regional builder. But as much as Butterfield exploited the advances of the steam age, his practice was deeply informed by his lifelong study of early English forms, which he used not as a source of applied motifs or as a means to produce high spectacle, but as object lessons in reducing shape, space, light and decoration to the expression of structure. In Philip Webb's words, he treated his favour- ite precedents as a 'logical system' for plan AA FILES 73 75 Overleaf: William Butterfield, Temple Reading Room and Art Museum, Rugby School, 1878-79 © Architectural Archives, University of Pennsylvania, Gift of Holmes Perkins</page><page sequence="4">■27c&gt; rrL^&gt; 7? t' cat ci7 &lt;* M y /? c? «&gt; raiy cc^c/ ^ &gt;~e ^t u.vi &lt;&lt; u a ¿3 v s c /-/ o o ¿~ /ve 6 i /% : ■-• Ů :%~ /. $c&gt; ct tt / J / i ( * a / /' o / &lt;</page><page sequence="5">: " -h .-s ñ- -H 'l / i" Tí;; ; í rT il , .

It is therefore essential to resist the notion that Butterfield belongs to some generic canon of 'High Victorian Gothic' and to see instead how his practice was distinct. He lived and worked for much longer than Street, Scott, Woodyer, Teulon, Burges or Carpenter, though he started before most of them, and the scope of his work - almost certainly by choice - is markedly different and markedly more limited and less prolific. There are no municipal buildings, no competitions after the early 1840s, no commercial buildings, no rail- way hotels or museums. With the exception of the single great hos- pital in Winchester, even the churches, primary schools, grammar schools, boarding schools, Keble College, cottage rows and London row houses all come from private patrons rather than diocesan or governmental commissions. He is fully in charge of every building after the late 1840s. There must have been a clerk among his drafts- men, but he never assigned the design of details, and personally directed each work - even as far afield as Melbourne. Every building is a gesamtkunstwerk of his devising. Here was an architect with the boldest national and moral intentions, working in the sector of the public realm that he felt could most likely realise them, and serving an interlocking group of patrons whom he educated so assiduously to his intentions and methods that they came to regard themselves as partners in his process. Butterfiefd was also not just a builder of churches and dedicated religious houses. He built for use and in answer to need. He said that he would readily agree to 'build a pig-sty, if a pig-sty were needed', and at Ardingly College farm he did just that. Nevertheless, a sense of religious purpose, and a distinctive system of ethics, underpin almost everything that he built. He designed the wards of his tuber- culosis home in Axbridge to open so that the sisters' prayers in the chapel could be heard. He saw his quadrangles and courts and lodg- ings at Rugby, Winchester College, Merton and Keble as a kind of monastic ensemble propagating manly Christian virtues. The teach- er's house attached to his model for a one-room school in the second set of Instrumenta Ecclesiastica is presented as the scrupulous work- ing out of a pious and moral dwelling system; likewise, his labourers' cottages and his tradesmen's houses in Paddington. His gymnasium at Rugby reads as a sacramental space in light for the exercise of the body, and the libraries at Keble, Rugby and Lord Coleridge's house in Ottery St Mary can be read as almost sacred chambers for the exer- cise of the mind, housing the knowledge of the divine in nature and printed repositories of guides to right thinking. In this, as in their search for a specifically English modernity that could echo the mem- ory of the 'better' England of the high Middle Ages, all of his build- ings were directed towards a more meaningful purpose that came out of obedience to the spirit (but not the letter) of precedent and was intended to last through the ages. We generally have no trouble accepting that the cause of architec- ture is to effect a grand purpose. Frank Lloyd Wright saw the home as a design 'for the growth of the spirit', and Le Corbusier's late works speak of 'heralding a new era for humanity'. But in the case of Butter- field, the principles he invoked - and what his buildings were meant to express and advance - were grounded in concepts now far removed from our cast of mind: the notion that we are living and governed by the rubrics of Christ's kingdom and its apostolic authority, or the idea that the nation is a Christian college of all estates brought together by the church both on earth and, as he so frankly put it, 'in doom'. This was a pattern of thinking readily recognisable to his own gen- eration but already 'quaint' by the time he died, and extraordinarily remote from our own. Thus we are bound to consider, with whatever scepticism we choose, his ideal of churchmanship, his adherence to that difficult lamp of architecture Ruskin called 'obedience', and his determination to lay aside any human construction of beauty, not as Summerson would have us believe, in favour of a wilful ugliness, but in order to discern and defer to a higher and less penetrable ideal of divine beauty - that is, to echo Gerard Manley Hopkins' well-known words, the beauty that emerges from the various, the contrary, the piebald, the multiple and the strange. Only then can we begin to rec- oncile the contradictions we find between the oddness, vividness, force and individualism that we see in Butterfield and his own sense of his works as simple, severe and serene. By the time Butterfield died, his welding of the Whiggish and late- Georgian concept of the moral universe to the ideal of an England reformed by re-learning the poetic and ethical lessons of the thir- teenth century was already an anachronism. But for the generation that came after him - among them Hopkins, Webb, Lethaby and Norman Shaw - he was still the master. In 1900 the arts and crafts architect, teacher and designer Halsey Ricardo published the first of two memorial essays that set out to establish Butterfield as a fig- ure of unsurpassed conscience, independence and artistry, and the sole architect whose work could stand apart from 'the general heap of litter which the nineteenth century has compiled'. Ricardo - But- terfield's friend and neighbour on Bedford Square and, before that, a pupil at Rugby - describes in almost metaphysical terms Butter- field's linking of beauty with efficiency, and fragility with strength. And he sees in the architect's work an allegory for understanding the present moment. It is as if Ricardo has become the narrator in Thomas Hardy's hymn-like ode, 'The Darkling Thrush' (published that same year, 1900). Leaning against the coppice gate in fraught contemplation of the doubts and fears ushered in by the new cen- tury, Hardy's man listens closely to an aged thrush 'fling his soul/ upon the growing gloom'. For Ricardo, in turn, Butterfield's archi- tecture is 'some blessed Hope', speaking of an ageless confidence in simple means used to attain great purpose. Ricardo places Butterfield apart because: His buildings are meant for use... It is this loyalty to existing fact, this sincerity of purpose, that ... separates them, by their manliness, their straightforwardness, their quiet strength, from the buildings of other men. In his work one is conscious of a reserve of power; he reaches impres- siveness and dignity without straining for them. There is mystery and romance in what he does, but got so simply and ingenuously that though the effect is supreme, the means seem quite ludicrously inadequate. After a nod towards All Saints, Margaret Street - not for its dec- oration, but for its brilliant economy of plan, which carved a rising precinct from a mean rectangular lot - Ricardo carves a route from Rugby Chapel to Keble College, selecting seven other works along the way as his signal points of reference. Four of the works are sec- ular and in brick - the new schools at Rugby, the new model Royal Hampshire Hospital at Winchester (designed and built under Flor- ence Nightingale's guidance from 1863 to 1869); the Keble quadran- gles with their great library and dining hall, started in 1867; and the Chanters' House - known as Heath's Court - in Devon, a vast expan- sion of the Coleridge family's country home for Butterfield's friend John Duke Coleridge in his first years as Lord Chief Justice in 1880-82. Three are later parish churches: the towering ensemble that makes</page><page sequence="9">William Butterfield, Heath's Court (Chanters' House), Ottery St Mary, Devon, 1880-82 © Drawing Matter Collections</page><page sequence="10">William Butterfield, Heath's Court (Chanters' House), Ottery St Mary, Devon, 1880-82 © Drawing Matter Collections</page><page sequence="11">up the brick slum church and clergy house for St Alban the Martyr in Holborn, which Butterfield completed in 1862, much of it lost in the Blitz; the quiet symphony in stones at Babbacombe, from 1865-74; and the more vivid stone church of St Andrew's Rugby, which Butter- field started in 1876 and which, 20 years later, would be the last work he saw to completion. Ricardo adds one example of restoration, not- ing the meticulous fidelity in the long sequence of revisions to the medieval hospice of St Cross in Winchester, where Butterfield served without fee for 45 years, from 1853 until the end of his life. Ricardo does not note that Butterfield, like Pugin, took the human history of St Cross as the model of a charitable commu- nity, nor that the rising and falling architectural disposition - its low, unselfconscious and easy ranges of dwellings forming the abutments and close to a strong, open, settled and unforbidding chapel - gave him the vocabulary of a loose connected ensemble for the schools, convents and college that were to come. He fails to acknowledge Butterfield's vast but scattered inventory of small country parsonages, cottage rows, farm buildings, small schools and teacher's houses, sketched and admired by Philip Webb and the genesis of much that came out of the first arts and crafts generation. Otherwise, this is a scrupulously balanced selection from the rela- tively small catalogue of Butterfield's major monumental works, and if we were to reconsider starting points in the line of Pioneers of Modern Architecture, where Butterfield surely belongs, this would still form the core of the list we would start with. These are build- ings of their time and for their circumstances. Each finds propor- tions and economies of material and means to match their purpose and budget, and - as Ricardo expounds in detail at Rugby Chapel and at Keble - each suggests that ancient patterns and recollec- tions could be recalled in a modern mode. We can now add to this list other late secular works marked by their decorative simplicity: St Michael's Hospital at Cheddar (1878-82), built largely in rough- hewn local stone to house 48 tuberculosis patients and, eventually, a mortuary, lodges and chaplain's house; and the toweringly efficient brick ensemble of Exeter Grammar School (which Ricardo may not have known, as it was then only recently finished). Until near the end, when Butterfield seemed to give up his life- long rebellion against classical symmetry, nearly every building was treated as a changeable ensemble, sometimes even a collision, of differences in scale, height, volume and rhythm, both horizon- tally and vertically. There is often apparent symmetry, but it is rarely real, and if one facade seems close to achieving it then the other will surely break it. Sometimes this is done with future accretions in mind, but it is never wilful, since the height, fenestration and articu- lation of entries and cover are determined by the function of that segment in the structure. And they are always brought together by one means or another - often by a common string course or fixed roof line and always by common gestures in the shape and pattern of their structural expressions. Butterfield also eschewed certain modes of representation, nota- bly the perspective, though the few that are known, like his render- ing of Shottesbrooke, are marvellous in their precision. His mature drawings, in which his draftsmen follow a repeated formula, are a statement of the builder's art, serving both as elaborate instruc- tions from which his contractors could not swerve and as precise statements of specification on which quotes can be based, signed and held to. Favouring the general section, they are completely in character with the intention of the built work, in their use of colour (an extraordinary blue wash that captures the light of the windows), in their crafted calligraphy, and in their two-dimensional synop- sis of the relentless logic underlying the spatial whole. At the same time, Butterfield gave unrivalled attention to how his drawings were laid out on a page and how they would communicate his first prin- ciple of design: that the building be seen and conceived as a whole and built with a unified approach to construction, proportion and detail. Notes on the measurements of floors and ceilings are pre- cisely written in the smallest hand, in a way that extends the lines of the divisions they specify. No punctuation mark or joint is missed. On the page Butterfield shows the same passion for materials as a mason or carpenter in the quarry or the lumberyard, as if he had found them himself and, in Ricardo's words, 'mingled them with a lover's fondness' on the site. A lover, perhaps, but an exacting one, since he required his build- ers to clear, wash and sweep a site before he entered for inspection. Carpenters, masons and bricklayers recalled him striding through in perfectly polished boots, with all the imperial frostiness of Mr Gladstone, whose dress and demeanour Butterfield emulated, and with whom he shared the idea that the church should be the gov- ernment's instrument in improving the nation's education and its moral life. But he had a deep knowledge and affection for the work- men's crafts. As one who had started his career among the dese- crated, whitewashed ruins of the Middle Ages, he was passionately committed to using their best constructive skills in the most dura- ble materials so that the texture, shapes and colours of his buildings would last. When the fledgling building trades unions staged their first great dispute in London, they turned to this odd and impolitic figure when asked to nominate a board of arbitration. But there was never any question of who was in charge. Butterfield left his build- ers no room for improvisation. In consequence, Ricardo notes, 'As far as a man may go, who does not actually hew the stone, lay the bricks, and shape the timbers, he had his hand on the work. There is nothing permitted but what has been foreseen, and this ... gives his work a rigidity, an inability to minister to any but the exalted moods'. What may at first read like Ricardo's sole complaint is perhaps his greatest praise, for he sees in the result of that rigid execution build- ings that - though they take neither the human form, nor the recipes of classical order, nor the flamboyance of nature - through their pro- portions in their settings appear 'happy and at their ease'. In personifying these inanimate projects Ricardo grants them 'a heart which is alive', and ultimately captures what is most powerful about Butterfield's works: that each one displays a nearly human, and sometimes humanly awkward character. Each one strives for the same sentinel, English and manly qualities in architecture that Butterfield called on mankind to display in society. They show that they are useful. They are conspicuous in their efforts to encourage a moral life. They speak of a way (in the promises uttered in the Gen- eral Confession) that is 'godly, righteous and sober'. Above all, they speak vehemently of these solemn, forceful and vivacious things - through their complex plays of proportion, their simple height and grandeur, their curious conjunctions of palette, mass and line - per- haps in ways the quietly contentious and reclusive fellow who made them could not. It is there, in the oddly anthropomorphic effect that comes from portraying what Ricardo calls the 'beauty of an earnest soul, awake' that the real glory of their apparent oddness lies. This is not ugliness, but a vision for modern times of what Hopkins called 'God's better beauty, grace ... counter, original, spare, strange'.</page></plain_text>
