<plain_text><page sequence="1">BETWEEN ETHICS AND PURE PHILOSOPHY. RESPONSE TO DANIELA VALLEGA-NEU AND MIGUEL DE BEISTEGUI by PETER WARNEK University of Oregon I would like to show how both papers can be heard addressing the same question. To say this, however, is to say also that each paper takes up this same in its own unique way and thus comes to articulate a distincdy different reservation, even if tentatively and cautiously, with regard to Heidegger's thinking in Contributions. Both papers present strong and decisive interpretations that draw out important connections between Contributions and Being and Time. They show how this later work grows out of, and yet entails a thorough transformation of, the earlier project. In each case, Heidegger's word and thought is opened up by being submitted to a kind of repetition and translation; in each case, this is carried out by thematizing and pursuing a certain delim ited question that is established in advance and that guides the inquiry. On the one hand, there is the "ethical" concern with the theme of the decision over beyng's historicality; on the other hand, there is the question of da-sein as the being that both transcendentally enables and yet possibly limits Heidegger's thinking and saying of being. Each paper insistently follows its own strategic line of interpretation, and precisely this insistence is what sets these papers apart from each other, although in a kind of related opposition, or counter-valence to each other. (I hope to make this opposition more explicit.) But, for this reason, it also becomes possible to bring the two papers productively into dia logue, to allow them to bear upon each other in their difference. And perhaps this difference then also offers a promising way to gain access to the very matter at issue here in Heidegger's thinking in Contributions. I begin my response by considering the conclusion of Heidegger's 1936 lectures on Schelling's Treatise On the Essence of Human Freedom} These lectures were given shortly before Heidegger began to work on Research in Phenomenology, 33 © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands 2003</page><page sequence="2">BETWEEN ETHICS AND PURE PHILOSOPHY 265 Contributions to Philosophy. Heidegger's discussion here provides an excel lent place to begin to open up the question that I see running through and connecting both of the papers. At the very end of the Schelling lecture, Heidegger raises the con cern over what he calls the "anthropomorphic" character of Schelling's thinking. At issue is the way in which Schelling—even as he attempts to address questions that concern the absolute, creation, nature and being—proceeds always through a reliance upon an analogy with human life. The apparently anthropomorphic character of Schelling's thinking is brought up usually as a way to justify a dismissive attitude toward it, says Heidegger, since, in the end, such thinking is thought thereby to be wholly unproductive toward the attainment of "objec tive" knowledge. Heidegger insists that the most appropriate response to this kind of objection is first of all to concede its most basic assertion, namely, that everything does indeed come down to how it may be measured in relation to the human. Yet what is immediately exposed in this way, contends Heidegger, is simply that all reservations and objections against anthropomorphism implicitly rely upon an assumed knowledge con cerning humankind, that the question that concerns the human as such has already been decided. What is most insidious here pertains, then, not only to anthropomorphism but also to all possible objections against it: it is not simply that the άνθρωπος is taken as the measure, but rather that, even when such a measure must be rejected, the rejection already understands this measure itself to be something self-evident and clear. Thus, without regard to whether anthropomorphism is to be affirmed or denied, what is most insidious here is that a closer determination of the human is already thought to be a superfluous endeavor (cf. GA, 65, §43).2 Heidegger thus states that if the inquiry is to proceed beyond this point, if it is to move to a different level, this requires first taking up a decisive question: the question that concerns how and why this meas ure becomes necessary at all. But this question, then, is only a beginning, according to Heidegger, as it in turn releases a manifold of further questions. Without rehearsing the complete series of questions unleashed by Heidegger in this passage, it is worth noting that this questioning culminates with a strange and paradoxical characterization of the human: the human is that being that, the more originally it is itself, is precisely not only itself and first of all not itself. The way in which the human becomes proper must happen according to this apparently</page><page sequence="3">266 PETER WARNER contradictory loss of propriety: it is itself most of all or first of all through an onginary not bdng itself The question of the human thus confounds any metaphysics of identity. And if this is the case, Heidegger sug gests, then what is at stake in all "humanizing" (Vermenschlichung) has to be rethought from the bottom up. Moreover, this must occur in such a way that we would then be compelled to read all great phi losophy (including Schelling's Freedom Essay) "with different eyes." It is worth recalling briefly how Heidegger, in the end, will come to situate Schelling's thinking firmly within the metaphysical tradition he struggles against. Schelling—who, aside from Heidegger himself, must be reckoned as the foremost thinker of the occurrence not only of de-cision, but of the prior cision (Scheidung) in which decision is grounded—remains nevertheless caught in a metaphysics of the will, according to Heidegger. Schelling's determination of factical human freedom in the end does not surpass the legacy of the system: as in Kant, what we comprehend is precisely freedom in its incomprehen sibility. Schelling, in this way, experiences the limits of metaphysics. And Heidegger's final assessment is that Schelling does not twist free of those limits but falls back into the rigidified tradition of Western thinking, failing to transform it creatively. (This Heideggerian assess ment of Schelling is also found after Contributions in Besinnung, GA, 66:263.) This failure on the part of Schelling—which finds its attestation in his silence during the forty-five years following the Freedom Essay— Heidegger will think alongside the breakdowns of two other Germans, Nietzsche and Hölderlin. All these events point to the same limit, according to Heidegger. But anyone who reads Heidegger here can not overlook how Heidegger himself repeatedly speaks of the failure of his own project set forth in Being and Time, the project of funda mental ontology or philosophy as science. But failure, Heidegger declares here, belongs to the essence of philosophy; to understand philosophy means nothing less than to think it in its failure. This is a statement which reverberates throughout Contnbutions. With regard to precisely such failure, in this 1936 lecture, Heidegger issues a revealing statement. He tells us that whoever would think this failure to its ground—whether it now be understood as only the fail ure of Schelling or also that of Nietzsche, or even of Heidegger him self—this one would have to become the founder (or grounder) of another beginning in Western philosophy. How, then, might we begin to understand the limits of Western phi</page><page sequence="4">BETWEEN ETHICS AND PURE PHILOSOPHY 267 losophy through the questions that arise when a more radical consid eration of the human becomes necessary? And is not Contributions pre cisely the attempt to answer such a question? Virtually throughout the text, from its beginning to its end, Heidegger's Contributions speaks continually and repeatedly of "the essential trans formation" or "metamorphosis" of the human, the transfiguration or the translation of humanity (Wesenswandel des Menschen, Verwandlung des Menschen), an occurrence that must unfold in a thinking of the truth of Beyng. In a thinking and speaking that attempts to think and speak from the appropriating/disappropriating event of being, the human must become other to itself precisely in what is ownmost to it. To begin with, this means only that Contributions develops a massive critique of the determination of the human as the rational animal. But let me say upfront that I see this to be a most fruitful place to begin a reading of Heidegger's monstrously difficult work and to attempt an understand ing of the task it gives itself. I also see both of the papers making such a beginning, albeit in dramatically different ways. I turn now to Vallega-Neu's paper. The reading she develops enters Heidegger's Contributions strategically, which is to say, not with an agenda, but nonetheless with a certain determinacy and orientation. Something from the beginning is thus already decided, has already been decided: we are asked to read Heidegger's work by allowing the theme or notion of decision to be our guide. In this way, by focusing upon the notion of decision, Vallega-Neu tells us, the ethical dimension of the work will be highlighted. I think we have to weigh this point with utmost care. But since, according to Vallega-Neu, this reference to the ethical must not be confused with any system of thought about "moral conduct," but refers more origi nally to ήθος in the Greek sense of (human) dwelling, we have here a clear reference to the concluding passages in Heidegger's well-known Humanismusbrief, where, through an interpretation of the Heraclitean fragment ήθος άνθρώπφ δαίμων, he explicitly takes up the question of the relation between his work and the possibility of an ethics. I suspect that much more could be said about the way in which this original or originary sense of ethics, which Heidegger only briefly develops in a later text, is informing Vallega-Neu's reading of Contributions, espe cially since Heidegger himself, to my knowledge, does not speak of Contributions in such ethical terms. It is also not irrelevant that this later Heideggerian text is concerned primarily with the limits and possibil ities of humanism, a theme also at the forefront of de Beistegui's paper.</page><page sequence="5">268 PETER WARNER It is thus all the more significant that Vallega-Neu then continues in her paper by stating that the word "decision" must be freed from its subjective and anthropological connotations, something of course that Heidegger himself repeats many times. Decisions, according to Heidegger—she states correcdy—are nothing we make, but something determining us (my emphasis). This reversal, as a transformative move ment, has to be considered carefully. How are we to understand the way in which this other sense of decision emerges from out of the commanding metaphysical determination of decision as an anthropo logical category? This is a question that obviously also bears direcdy on de Beistegui's paper. If the anthropological determination of decision cannot be dismissed simply by edict, and if what is most thought pro voking here is precisely the way in which we remain caught in this anthropological determination of decision, then we have to take seriously how Heidegger's thinking affirms itself as only transitional and inceptive. What has to be noted here, above all, is how such a reversal con cerning decision has a double effect: it both displaces and transforms decision in the traditional sense, since decision is indeed taken away from us, no longer made by us, no longer simply a matter of "choice," and so on; and yet, at the same time, such a statement also keeps us in relation to decision, since we still come to be determined by it, as we find ourselves in it. This last point is made more clear by Vallega-Neu subsequendy, as she explains more fully how she understands Contributions to have an ethical dimension. It is not first of all ethical simply because as a work it deals with the historical decision concerning machination, which for Heidegger names the globalizing and totalizing power that now ever increasingly determines the way beings occur. It is not ethical because it is concerned with the fate of the West. Rather, it is ethical because the work is itself an enactment of the decision over being's disclosive occurrence. Yet what is remarkable is how this is the case all the more so, strangely, as the decision is emphatically not made by us: it is ethical as a movement of disappropriation or expropriation. Heidegger's think ing, Vallega-Neu says, both finds itself in the decision and occurs as this decision. I take this statement, which opens up a great tension in Heidegger's thinking, to be decisive for Vallega-Neu's latent sense of the ethical. What is especially important and compelling here in Vallega-Neu's discussion is the way in which Heidegger's sense of attunement, already developed in Being and Time, allows for a greater determination of deci</page><page sequence="6">BETWEEN ETHICS AND PURE PHILOSOPHY 269 sion in Contributions, precisely in its inceptive and transitional character. Above all, the decision shows itself in the reservedness of thinking. But Contributions does not seek only to delimit these ways of disclosure in attunenment and to render them conceptually clear; it also thinks in them, comes to itself out of them. It thus attempts to be, we might say, not simply some sort of report or message about a state of affairs, but rather also the very happening of the decision that it thinks. But here "to think" must also be taken to mean an attunement, which means a human way of dwelling, an ethical habitus. Vallega-Neu makes clear that being's occurrence as decision, as Ent scheidung, as a kind of sundering, should be heard to mean the grant ing of (concrete) possibilities of being, but precisely through withdrawal and concealment. To think the granting of being in its withdrawal as decision is nothing less than to think historically in Heidegger's sense, but at a place where another possible history opens up. Heidegger's work thus does address a historical decision, in the sense that it thinks his torical possibility by thinking the concealment or withdrawal that always must be harbored in the presence of things, what Heidegger calls the truth of beyng or its essencing, its coming to pass, its Wesung. But I would like to emphasize that what I understand Vallega-Neu's point to be, more importantly, is that this work is ethical because it respon sively takes up the history in which it finds itself, it is in the historical decision it addresses, but it is in it as it also becomes the very occur rence of that decision. Vallega-Neu thus points out that what struc tures and articulates Contributions is "not a system . .. but decision itself, i.e., being's occurrence as decision." That Heidegger's thinking finds itself in the decision as it occurs as this decision means that the ethical character of Heidegger's Contributions must be thought as a certain doubling that we can readily compare to the double sense of da-sein developed by de Beistegui. But here I think it would be helpful to make more explicit how the question of respon sibility thoroughly haunts such a doubling, as it does also Vallega-Neu's paper. We are called to take a stand in decisions, she says more than once. And yet, although "thinking has no power to complete the deci sion," the decision "cannot occur without humans." And while this being called to take a stand in the decision, strictly speaking, cannot be iso lated from the decision itself, at least formally there is nonetheless a decision before the decision as such, and thus a responsibility before this being-called. One can be called only because one is first of all responsible, able to respond.</page><page sequence="7">270 PETER WARNER This doubling in the ethical—which could also be seen as the very genesis of the ethical—could also be considered in its connection with the double sense of finitude in Being and Time (life/death and factical historical singularity), which Vallega-Neu only briefly develops but relates in a compelling way to the double sense of concealment that one already finds in the essay "On the Essence of Truth." These two modes of concealment or untruth have to be rigorously distinguished and maintained. There is the ineluctable concealment that, on the one hand, belongs to the basic structure of all disclosure: the λήθη of αλήθεια. This most enigmatic concealment occurs, however, alongside a second concealment that, on the other hand, is grounded in a kind of singular and necessary human contingency and indeterminacy (errancy). Each form of concealmenet has its own distinct form of necessity. Vallega-Neu thus speaks in this context of a double blind ness. Precisely in the difference that separates these two senses of con cealment, we come closer still, I suspect, to the responsibility that lies in the ethical dimension this paper wants to open up. Let me read a passage from Vallega-Neu's paper: Translated into the notion of decision this means that the decision in which the thinking of Contributions finds itself is blind in a twofold man ner: blind with respect to its source or ground, which is abysmal, and blind when it finds its concretion in a specific moment and site that is held open in beings and—in the case of thinking—in words. We could say that decision finds its second moment of blindness (of indeterminacy) in the moment it finds a determination in words. Could this "second moment of blindness," to use Vallega-Neu's words, be thought as a decision before the decision? Would it not then be, first of all, a "human" responsibility to enter the decision, to take a thinking attuned stand in it? In this question, if we consider it carefully, I think we arrive at a decisive point. From the vantage point of this question, we can consider the reservation that Vallega-Neu articulates in this paper. I want to stress that Vallega-Neu has done us the service of open ing up in a powerful way how the thinking in Contributions continually deprives the reader of any sure footing, as it doubles back on itself in the very movement of its thinking. This is perhaps most clear if we consider, briefly, how what is in question in this decision—as the very decision to be decided—is also bound up with the determination of decision itself. The decision in question thus brings us to a kind of vertigo: the decision is also to decide (the meaning of) decision as</page><page sequence="8">BETWEEN ETHICS AND PURE PHILOSOPHY 271 such. In the decision there opens up the possible transformation of the very sense of decision. Let me read only one quote from Heidegger's text which I think resonates with Vallega-Neu's paper in this respect. 'decision' can be and ought to be meant at first as a human 'act'—even if not in a moral sense but nonetheless according to enactment—until suddenly it comes to mean the essencing of beyng... This 'reversal' is not, however, simply a formal trick where mere word-meanings are altered; it is rather the transformation of the human itself. (GA, 65: 84/58) In this passage I think Heidegger is pointing to precisely what Vallega Neu wants to understand as the ethical dimension of this work, as the movement or transformation of the decision that is opened up through a certain doubling. But how, then, does one begin to think here, in what appears to be a radical and necessary indeterminacy, both with regard to what must be thought in its transformation (decision as such) and with regard to how this thinking is to happen (namely, as decision)? In order that the sense of decision undergo such transformation, that it be articulated in the transitional way in which it first shows itself— which means that it be freed from its initially humanistic character, so that it can come to name the essencing of beyng—Heidegger tells us this requires nothing less than the transformation of the essence of humanity. So, on the one hand, the sense of decision cannot be altered without humanity already undergoing an essential transformation. But, on the other hand, such a historical transformation, it seems, would already have to presuppose that decision no longer be determined pri marily as a human act. Thus, to think the historical event of this decision, as the possible transformation of both decision and humanity, is already to find one self (to find oneself lost) in the decision: which means nothing less than to encounter the decision as such. And Heidegger is quite explicit: coming to find oneself in this way, coming to find oneself redeter mined in this way, must not be reduced to a process in which word meanings are simply redetermined, behind which and over which we still find the master-subject prevailing. We are to experience—or undergo— a historical event in which we who experience the event do not only find ourselves transformed, as we take on a new identity, but in which our identity itself in that transformation is thereby exposed to an abyss, grounded in a ground that continually falls away, Ab-grund. What is most provocative in this regard is Vallega-Neu's assertion that we are to consider this as an ethical matter.</page><page sequence="9">272 PETER WARNER That the strategy of this paper is not exhausted simply in an elab oration of decision in Heidegger's Contnbutions becomes clearer toward the end of Vallega-Neu's paper as she confronts what she speaks of as Heidegger's "totalizing move" with regard to history. Her concerns involve two interrelated points, but I think they both lead to the ques tion I am raising, that of a human responsibility in thinking and acting: (1) Heidegger's thinking is caught between two irreconcilable necessities: on the one hand, there is the necessity of suspending or postponing the decision in a certain undecidedness, in the indefinite postponement of the decision as such; and, on the other hand, there is the necessity of bringing the decision to language in a concrete way, the necessity of sheltering the decision in words, as the very concretion of thinking and the occurrence of being. Vallega-Neu shows how these two neces sities arise out of the double blindness or twofold concealment of truth. (2) The second point is not fully developed but has to do with the way Heidegger's thinking is said to be thoroughly determined (or decided?) by a privileging of the Western tradition. This is, according to Vallega-Neu, Heidegger's own second kind of blindness, which is to say, his errancy: Heidegger is blind to "what escapes the lineage of the Western history he constructs." (Let me say here only that I am suspicious of the language of "construction," since it seems to revert to the subjectivism of modernity.) These concerns do not so much amount to a compelling conclusion as they are a provocation toward further questioning. It is also clear that they stand in sharp opposition to each other. I ask: What is the "totalizing move," which is said here to lead to a construction of his tory, if not precisely the ability to think in a concrete and decisive way, to project or put into work bold and powerful determinations that are precisely transformative of being? That, however, an errancy belongs to such "totalizing" and such "construction"—if we can still speak this way—would also have to confirm, it seems, Heidegger's thought concerning the first structural blindness or enigmatic conceal ment at the heart of truth, since the construction is also precisely the attempt to put into relief that concealment. We should never neglect that Heidegger understood Contnbutions—a "work" that he himself, no doubt in a mood of reservedness, withheld from publication—as only a Versuch, as, namely, an attempt or experiment, but also as a dan gerous temptation. Let me turn now to de Beistegui. I think that much of what has been said thus far can also be brought direcdy to bear upon his paper</page><page sequence="10">BETWEEN ETHICS AND PURE PHILOSOPHY 273 in a productive way, and thus can be seen as a kind of preparation for an understanding of the question I now wish to pursue. I have tried to show how Vallega-Neu is attempting to push Heidegger, how ever tentatively and provisionally, toward what I have ventured to call a "human" responsibility, toward, namely, a sense of decision that arises before the decision as the occurrence of being. This decidedly eth ical orientation, however, as it raises this distinctly human question, seems now to be opposed to the concern raised by de Beistegui, which is grounded in a certain understanding of Heidegger's task. The con cern has to do with whether Heidegger's commitment to humanism, to his "other humanism," does not, in the end, amount to "a form of anthropocentrism." The concern rests upon the presupposition that the possibility of establishing a discourse that would be appropriate to the event of being or to being as event—a discourse beyond all repre sentational thought and all metaphysics of substance—must first of all face the enormous difficulty of freeing itself of all ontical determinacy. It is a matter of de-reifying thinking and language, of releasing the transitive force of the copula, of moving from the metaphysical deter minations of being in terms of the what to a non-representational think ing of the how, of thinking not simply the operation whereby beings come to be, but of thinking the operation of being itself, its very com ing to pass, its granting, its truth, its Wesung. The question is thus raised whether Heidegger's reliance (or insis tence) upon the role of dasein (or da-sein) in the event of beyng does not betray a basic limit in his thinking, as if beyng itself were sent or destined to precisely the human, as if in the human, thinking finally arrives at the proper name of beyng. De Beistegui thus asks: "can the question of being be deployed anew so as to not even presuppose the human as one pole of its unfolding?" Such a possibility of the redeployment of the question of being is pursued by opening up a doubling or even a duplicity within da-sein itself as it comes to be articulated by Heidegger in Contributions. Da sein functions both adverbially and nominally, as de Beistegui puts it. It designates both the preindividual how of being's coming to pass, and the site, or the proper name of the site, where such a coming to pass finds itself, comes to itself, is made proper. Da-sein in its doubling thus names the great difficulty or conflict of Heidegger's thinking in Con tributions. De Beistegui retraces the conflict of this double character of da-sein in an effort to show how Heidegger's thinking is caught in a contradiction that exceeds its capacity to determine or account for</page><page sequence="11">274 PETER WARNER itself, but also therefore in an effort to show how Heidegger resists the movement in his own thinking that would take him beyond his fun damentally humanistic position. Heidegger thus both brings about and also resists the most radical implications of his thinking. Let me read two passages from de Beistegui's paper which express this difficulty or this conflict. First: there is a general movement away from the singularity of the individu ated Dasein, a general decentering of man, and further into the preindi vidual... what Heidegger calls the Zeit-Raum. But then: Heidegger will have never been in a position, or indeed even willing to dissociate entirely the adverbial, preindividual aspect of the Seinsfrage from the question of what, with the necessary caution, I would call the "sub ject" of being, thus pointing to the "who" of being. In other words, Heidegger will never have been in a position to separate completely the question of the how of being, which does not immediately call for an individual qualification of this how, with the question of man as the "proper" name of being. The overall effect of de Beistegui's reading, to hazard a formulation, is to imply that Heidegger, in remaining thus stuck in a humanistic metaphysics, does not complete the trajectory of his thinking, does not succeed in following such a thinking to its extreme conclusion. Let me say straightout that while I admire tremendously the lucidity and the subtle rigor with which de Beistegui opens up Heidegger's text—and I have learned much from his analysis—I nevertheless see this ambi tious strategy to be highly problematic. Before I try to make plain why I think this, I first want point out also how de Beistegui's paper seems to me to hesitate before its most decisive claims. On the one hand, the goals of this paper seem quite modest. It seeks only to retrace the difficulty of the matter. De Beistegui states: "in a sense all I shall be attempting here is to show the way in which this difficulty persists in Heidegger's work." Thus, the point here is only to open up a tension or conflict, without deciding that conflict, without privileging one side, without settling the question. But, on the other hand, I also have the sense that a bolder and more ambitious confrontation with Heidegger's thinking is lurking here. This becomes most apparent in the sugges tion, barely articulated at one point, that the ambiguity or duplicity in da-sein has a "traitorous" character. Here I think we glimpse perhaps how de Beistegui understands the authentic task of Heidegger's think</page><page sequence="12">BETWEEN ETHICS AND PURE PHILOSOPHY 275 ing, since only in this context could it thus be possible to speak of Heidegger's failing to be true to himself or to his own thinking. But if de Beistegui is promising here to show how the doubling is, in fact, traitorous, I do not see that he makes good on this promise. The paper, for example, concludes with a sentence that seems to me to backpedal or to retreat from such a confrontation with the traitorous character of the doubling, or at least it neglects to bring such a con frontation into the open. We are left only with an undecidable conflict at the heart of Heidegger's thinking of da-sein. If, in fact, Heidegger resists or remains unwilling to follow the rad ical implications of his thinking—and I think this is disputable—it seems it is also necessary to ask why this happens? For only if we come to a deeper appreciation of the origin of Heidegger's humanism can the difficulty as such be considered. Where exactly is the difficulty? Are we to speak at all of Heidegger's desire or "will" here? Or Heidegger's strategy, for that matter? Why the lingering commitment to humanism? Whence the necessity or the compulsion to continue to think beyng as Ereignis, which is to say, not simply as event, but as the space opened in the responsibility of human thinking? That human thinking ecstati cally exceeds itself in a disappropriating or expropriating movement, that its movement of appropriation is an othering of itself, an expro priation—Ereignis enteignet, Heidegger sometimes says—this only confirms the necessity of the relational character between the human and beyng's event. The human is "of the other," de Beistegui says. Thus, we must ask: how is it that Heidegger is compelled to insist not only that the human belongs to beyng but also that beyng needs the human. Such a compulsion, it seems, is not at all accounted for adequately if we sim ply attribute it to profound grammatical habits or to the representa tional tendency of Western conceptuality. De Beistegui says that the two senses of da-sein have to be understood as interdependent, and I agree with him. Yet his analysis only makes evident how the two senses differ. So, the question arises: how do we account for their interde pendency? How are they to be thought as grounded in the same? I think it would be helpful if de Beistegui could tell us more about how he takes both senses of da-sein to be bound together in the one prob lem of the origin of what Heidegger calls time-space. Thus, everything hinges on how we are able to think the way Heidegger attempts to ground propriety, and ultimately therefore even seljhood, in the originary self-concealment of beyng. Here I think de Beistegui's analysis of the da in da-sein is most promising, since it does</page><page sequence="13">276 PETER WARNER reveal a kind of necessary movement between the there as the clear ing and the concealment that is necessarily sheltered in that clearing. As de Beistegui righdy says, Heidegger's phenomenology is, paradox ically, "a phenomenology of the inapparent," thus a phenomenology at the limit of phenomenology. But such an extreme phenomenology could never simply disregard the manifestness of things and attend solely to pure concealment; it can let the originary concealing show itself (in the manner of its self-showing) only because the concealing shows itself precisely and only in the becoming apparent of beings. Heidegger's phenomenology must also offer a kind of genetic account of appear ance. This is how I understand de Beistegui's provocative statement that da-sein is a repetition of ώ-sein, which is to say that the nomi nal sense repeats the adverbial sense. But this in itself would not refute the necessity of the repetion. If anything, it only becomes more urgent to ask the question of the human, as Heidegger already says in his Schelling lecture. Let me close with another question. Is it the case, finally, that Heidegger does want something like a discourse of pure beyng, a pure discourse of the eventing of being, freed from all ontical determinacy? Would such a pure discourse still allow for the inescapably ethical or practical moment of a distinctly human—if not all too human—deci sion? I think here we come to a place, perhaps, where these two papers can begin to speak to each other.
