Jade (nephrite), h. 3 in. (7.6 cm) Provenance: Baron and Baroness von Oertzen, Johannesburg, by 1969-2008; sale, Christie's, South Kensington, London, November 7,2008, lot 239; [to J. J. Lally &amp; Co., New York], Purchase, The Vincent Astor Foundation Gift, 2009 (2009.176) This handsomely crafted plaque is one of the rarest examples of jades from the Hongshan culture of Neolithic China (ca. 3500-2000 B.c.), whose jade carving remained unknown until the 1980s. Hongshan jades show an extraordi nary command of the material and the tech niques of carving it. They are characterized by their intriguing shapes, great attention to detail, phenomenal subtlety of surface, and engaging tactile quality, all of which are well demonstrated in the elegant form, fluent lines, subtle luster, and smoothly modulated grooves of this plaque. Large ceremonial structures built with rocks and graves lined with stone slabs have been excavated at Hongshan sites in northeastern China. Jade seems to have played a particular role in the culture; most, and often the only, artifacts found in Hongshan burials are jade. Many Hongshan jades are ornaments of some kind: they are either bracelets or pendants or they have fixings or holes that would allow them to be attached to the body or to clothes. But the exact function of several other types, this plaque among them, remains a mystery. zjs Monstrous Male Figure Eastern Iran/Bactria-Margiana, late 3rd—early 2nd millennium B.C. Chlorite, calcite, gold, iron; h. 4 in. (10.1 cm) Provenance: Noriyoshi Horiuchi. Purchase, 2009 Benefit Fund and Friends of ¡nanna Gifts; Gift of Noriyoshi Floriuchi, 2010 (2010.1661 In the world of the ancient Near East, images and beings that combined human and animal qualities were thought to possess supernatural powers. This small yet potent figure, with its human face and serpentine-scaled body, prob ably represents such a creature, enlivened and charged with magical efficacy whether propi tious or demonic. The monstrous figure's most enigmatic and distinctive features are the prom inent scar across its face and the two holes pierced into its upper and lower lips. The scar may indicate that the figure was defaced, and the holes suggest that the lips may have l^een sealed, literally. Taken together, the scar and the sealed lips imply that the figure portrays a decommissioned being whose power is no longer operational. Having served its purpose, it may have been ritually muted and "killed."The unusual form of composite construction used to create the figure, achieved by using tangs to join together several sections of differing mate rials and colors, further enhances its powerful effect. As is true of so many great works of art from the ancient Near East, the forcefulness of the rendering and the unsettling imagery work to make the figure appear much larger than its actual size. rb Kneeling Statue of Bay Egyptian, New Kingdom, early Dynasty 19, reign of Seti I or later (ca. 1294-1250 B.C.) Limestone, h. 11H in. (28.2 cm) Provenance: Top half: [Esoterica, New York, the shop of Count Stefan Colonna Walewski]: sold to Albert A. Gallatin, 1948. Bottom half: Purchased in Egypt by Robert J. Demarée, 1965-66. Purchase, Fletcher Fund and The Guide Foundation Inc. Gift, 1966 (66.99.94)Gift of Dr. ft J. Demarée, 2009 (2009.253) While visiting the Department of Egyptian Art at the Metropolitan in 2008, Professor Robert J. Demarée of Leiden University noticed the upper half of a statuette in one of the study galleries. During lunch he informed us that he owned the bottom half of this statuette, which he had purchased in Cairo in the 1960s, when the sale and export of antiquities was still allowed. Upon returning to the Netherlands, Professor Demarée confirmed that the two frag ments were indeed parts of the same statuette, and he generously donated the lower half to the Museum. The top half of the statuette came to the Museum in 1966 as part of the collection of Albert Gallatin. The completed statuette depicts a kneeling man holding a stela inscribed with a hymn to the sun. The inscription on the bottom half identifies the owner as Bay, who was a scribe attached to the temple of Seti I, a post he probably held into the reign ofSeti's son, Ramesses II.This dates the statuette to the first part of Dynasty 19 in the early Ramesside period. Complete statues of nonroyal individuals from this period are uncommon, and pieces of this fine quality are extremely rare. chr 4 I RECENT ACQUISITIONS</page><page sequence="3">?· j». - 5 k, ; 4Γ .· Ptah Egyptian, Third Intermediate Period, ca. 1070-712 B.C.

The god's body is covered except for his hands, and his rounded arms and jut ting elbows are emphasized by the tight garment. He wears a skullcap and a ridged beard. Tucked behind the beard are the tops of three overlaid staffs that end above his ankles: an animal headed was (dominion) visible in side view, an ankh (life) with its loop and crossbar, and a djed (stability) with four horizontals. The deity would have been housed in a wooden shrine; when the doors were opened he received offerings, incense, prayers, and songs. When the statuette's life as a temple image was over, it would have been deposited in a sacred cache. The statuette is remarkable for its beauty, size, and state of preservation, as well as for the distinctive methods and quality of the casting. It belongs to the Third Intermediate Period, a time of political fragmentation when temples came to the fore, pro ducing a crescendo of experimentation and expression in metalwork. mh Ptah Egyptian, Third Intermediate Period, ca. 1070-712 B.C.

Terracotta, h. 3'/e in. (7.9 cm) Provenance: Sale, Münzen und Medaillen, Basel, December 13,1969, lot 47; Ariel Herrmann, 1969-2010. Gift of Ariel Herrmann, in memory of Brian T. Aitken, 2009(2009.529) This spirited sculptural vase is among the earli est extant representations of a Greek ketos, or sea monster. The creature has a formidable leo nine head with big eyes and a goatee, a striped belly, scales, and two flipperlike fins. With its long, furry ears pressed back and its large, prominent teeth bared, it gestures menacingly. A hole in the top of the head would have been used to fill the vase, and liquid would have poured out through the hole in the tongue between the large fangs. Except for the loss of the end of the body and tail, the vase is remarkably well pre served, with much added red paint on the ears, face, and alternating scales. The iconography of the Greek ketos was established in the Archaic period (ca. 600— 480 B.c.) and remained amazingly consistent for centuries, long into Roman Imperial times. It is one of the creatures that after the con quests of Alexander the Great (reigned 331— 323 B.c.) traveled to the East, where it appeared in Gandaran art and influenced representations of monsters from Afghanistan to India. The ketos has even been suggested as a partial inspi ration for the Chinese dragon. sh Bottle with a Head on the Spout Peru (lea Valley Paracas), 6th century B.C. Ceramic and post-fired paint, h. 7 in. (17.8 cm) Provenance: [Jean Lions, Saint-Tropez, France, before 1970]; private collection, New York, 1995; sale, Sotheby's, New York, November 20,1995, lot 5; [David Bernstein Fine Art, New York, 1995], Purchase, Arthur M. Bullowa Bequest, 2009 (2009.106) Bowls and bottles in various shapes and sizes are consistendy found among the burial goods that ancient Peruvian peoples took with them to their graves. Both the bottles and bowls con tained foodstuffs, but while the contents of the bowls remain more or less intact, even centu ries later, due to the extremely dry climate, the bottles are usually empty. They undoubtedly contained a liquid, perhaps water. In the arid region on the southern Pacific coast of Peru where this bottle was found, the valleys had only sparse river water from the Andes, but groundwater oases provided enough supple mental moisture to support communities of some size and moderate wealth, particularly in the lea and Nazca valleys. This beautifully rounded and finished bottle is an example of the fine ceramic vessels produced in the region in the first millennium B.c.The significance of the unusual grotesque head at the junction of one of the branches of the stirrup spout is uncertain. The head is painted yellow and has a wide red mouth, a large pug nose, red ears with plump, circular earrings, and a topknot. On its forehead is a large ornament decorated with concentric circles around a red center. Most mysterious of all, it is missing an eye. jj Alabaster Alabastron Etruscan (said to be from Vulci), Archaic, early 6th century B.C. Alabaster, h. 14 in. (35.6 cm) Provenance: H. J. P.

The neck and rim are now missing, and the back of the body is also badly corroded, revealing part of the narrow drilled tube that held the contents. The flask belongs to a small group of sculptured stone alabastra; some of them may have been produced in the East, perhaps by Phoenician craftsmen, but others, found at Etruscan sites in central Italy, are seen as local adaptations. When it was first published, in 1963, this highly elaborate and unusual example was regarded as an Etruscan work. Despite its Orientalizing style, the heads on the flask, with their sharp, rather rudimen tary features, recall other Etruscan sculptures of the late seventh and sixth centuries B.c. CSL Attributed to a painter of the Princeton Group Neck-amphora Greek, Archaic, Attic, black-figure, ca. 540-530 B.C. Terracotta, h. 13 in. (33 cm) Provenance: [André Emmerich Gallery, New York [Masterpieces of Greek Vase Painting, exh. cat., April 22-May 30,1964, no. 13)]; George and Rosemary Lois, New York, from 1973. The Bothmer Purchase Fund, 2010 (2010.1471 Greek vases are not usually famous for their individuality. Among the works made in Athens during the sixth century B.c. in the black-figure technique, this one is exceptional for its shape: the broad body tapers rapidly to the base that was never provided with a foot. Noteworthy also is the allocation of the subject matter to opposite sides of the body, a feature more com mon on later red-figure vases. The front shows Herakles, foremost among ancient Greek heroes, wearing his lion skin and drawing his bow against Geryon, depicted on the back. Consisting of three fully armed bodies, Geryon lived to the far west on an island in the stream of Ocean. He owned a large herd of cattle that Herakles went to capture. Herakles has wounded one of Geryon's bodies, shown falling to the right, and will presently dispatch the others. On each side of the neck appears a procession of men and youths led by a flute player. Long attributed to the circle of artists around the painter Exekias, since its acquisition by the Museum the neck-amphora has been associated with the Princeton Painter, an inventive artist of the third quarter of the sixth century B.c.

(19.1 cm) Provenance: Found at Bettoile in Tuscany before 1879, the year it was recorded as in the collection of the Counts Passerini; Münzen und Medaillen, Basel, sale 22, May 13,1961, lot 157; Heinz Hoek, Riehen; by descent to his grandson William Hoek, Brussels; sold to Robert Haber, New York. The Bothmer Purchase Fund, and Promised Gift of Andrés A. Mata, 2010(2010.64) A notable example of early red-figure Attic vase-painting at its best, this evocative plate depicts in its well-balanced tondo a composition of two male revelers obviously enjoy ing their participation in a lively symposium. The youth on the left, dressed in a himation and wearing a red wreath in his hair, plays a flute he holds in his right hand while hold ing another in his left. Both flutes were rendered in added red paint that is now barely discernible. The second youth, who seems slightly younger due to his lack of facial hair, wears his himation draped over both shoulders and carries a skyphos (deep drinking vessel) in his right hand as he turns appreciatively toward his musical companion. The plate can be attributed to Paseas, an accomplished Athenian artist of the late Archaic period who worked in both, the black-figure and red-figure techniques. Paseas has been credited with at least ten red-figure plates, all of which demon strate a consistent and recognizable elegance of style as well as a marked refinement of the potter's technique. cap Globular Cup with Two Handles Etruscan, last quarter of 6th century B.C. Terracotta, h. 53/4 in. (14.6 cm) Provenance: Münzen und Medaillen, Basel, sale 26, October 5,1963, lot 162; Jacques Schotte (1928-2007), Belgium; sale, Bonham's, London, April 29,2009, lot 121. Rogers Fund, 2009 {2009.316) The distinctive form of this cup was influenced by metal prototypes and is also known in Etruscan Bucchero. It belongs to a select group of black-figure vases, termed Pontic ware, that were produced in Etruria by an artist known as the Paris Painter and his followers in the second half of the sixth century B.c. Its decoration is especially notable. The main scene on each side of the body represents a phallos-bird with spread wings among black birds. During the Late Archaic period (ca. 520—480 B.c.) the phallos-bird was a popular motif for vase painters in Athens, where it had obvious erotic connotations and was frequently associated with young women or satyrs in a Dionysian milieu. While its specific meaning in Etruscan art is less clear, its depiction on this vase in a natural setting among more common birds displays a vitality that is characteristi cally Etruscan. From the black-figure technique, the ico nography, and other features, it is apparent that this globular cup was made to emulate East Greek and Athenian painted vases that were desirable to Etruscan collectors. sh 8 I RECENT ACQUISITIONS</page><page sequence="7">Ring Celtic, 4th century B.C.

Gift of Josefand Brigitte Hatzenbuehler, 2009 (2009.532.1) Perhaps the most lavish Celtic example to survive, this imposing ring is constructed of gold repoussé and has a rhomboid-shaped bezel supported by an inner wall of gold. On the bezel are two bearded Janus masks separated by rams' heads. A related late fifth century B.c. ring from the vicinity of Speyer, Germany, suggests an approximate geo graphic region for the origin of the type. Celtic goldsmiths admired Etruscan forms, and this ring was inspired in part by an Etruscan ring from the early fifth cen tury B.c. like one fromVulci in the Muse um's collection. In Etruscan mythology Ani, the god of the sky, was sometimes depicted with two faces and is thus equated with the Roman god Janus, who symbolizes the Torso of a Priestess Egyptian, reign of Ptolemy I or Ptolemy II, 306-246 B.C.

Liana Weindling Gift, in memory of her mother, 2010(2010.181 Even with its upper part missing, this is a beautiful example of a fairly rare type of nonroyal female image from the time when Alexander the Great's General Ptolemy and his son ruled Egypt. The tightly fitting sheath worn by this woman is well known from Pharaonic female representations, especially of the Old and Middle Kingdoms (ca. 2649—1640 B.c.), and her long-limbed body is still close to the dominating ideal of female beauty of Pharaonic times. Ptol emaic artistic trends, however, predominate in the rounded abdomen and the subtly indicated pubic area. According to the inscription on the back-pillar, the woman was called Tagerem. She was the daughter of a priest and held the priestly position of "god's wife" at Sakhebu, a town in the southwestern Nile Delta. DA change from the past to the future. The Celts regarded the ram's head as a sign of fertility and aggression and evoked it in the worship of Camulos, the god of war. Similar imagery was used on a great gold torque of the first century B.c. from Frasnes-lez-Buissenal, Belgium, that is displayed in the Medieval Gallery in the same case as this ring. ctl Ring Celtic, 4th century B.C.

Zoullas Gifts, 2010(2010.2601 Sixteen full-size Roman marble copies of this famous group are known today.The Museums acquisition is one of the finest and best-preserved examples.The Three Graces—Aglaia (Beauty), Euphrosyne (Mirth), and Thalia (Abundance)— the handmaidens of Aphrodite, are represented as nude young girls standing with their hands on each other's shoulders, the center figure facing the other two. Large, drapery-covered water jars frame the group. The graceful frieze like pose is one of the most famous composi tions known from antiquity. Where and by whom the scheme was invented is not known, but it was most likely developed in the late Hellenistic period, probably in the second century b.c. It soon became a canonic formula for representing the Graces, appearing in every medium and on every kind of object from mir rors to sarcophagi, and its popularity continued into the Renaissance. The representation derives from the famous classical statue of Aphrodite by Praxiteles at Knidos, in western Asia Minor. Venerable cults devoted to the Three Graces existed throughout the ancient Graeco-Roman world. This sculpture may have originally been placed in a garden or a public building such as a bath. It can be dated to the Hadrianic or early Antonine period by the ovoid form of the base and the molding on its front. cap 10 I RECENT ACQUISITIONS</page><page sequence="9">Belt Buckle and Ornamental Plaques China, Tang dynasty (618-906), 7th century Gilt bronze inlaid with glass and pearls, silk backing; 1 '/β χ 20 in.

Gift, 200812008.299a-il Belts embellished with plaques made of various materials were worn in many of the nomadic cultures that roamed the Central Asian steppe in the first millennium B.c. and later. Some were made in China for its northern neighbors; others were fashioned and used domestically, particularly from the fifth to the eighth century, when nomadic confederacies often ruled parts of northern China. This elegant set is an unusual example of such adornments made using glass, a precious commodity in Tang China that was both pro duced locally and imported from western Asia. Minute pieces of comma-shaped brown and green glass have been carefully placed into small enclosures defined by thin gilt bronze wires to create images of a bird against a fiorai back ground in the rectangular plaques and a flower with four petals in the square one.Tiny seed pearls fill the borders of all the plaques, which were once backed with silk. This extraordinarily rare group is similar to a set excavated in Xi'an in 1992 in the tomb of Dou Jiao (died 646), a member of the Tang imperial family who served as a military officer for his cousin the emperor Taizong (reigned 627-49). dpl Three Standing Figures Mexico (Veracruz), 7th—10th century Ceramic and hematite crystals, h. of each 8 té In.

Culturally diverse and environmentally rich, the people ofVeracruz took part in dynamic interchanges between the three regions that over the centuries included trade, warfare, and migration. During the middle cen turies of the first millennium the artistically gifted Veracruzanos created particularly inven tive ceramic sculpture in diverse yet related styles. Each of these three standing figures is unique, but they share many details: the curled hair (or hats with curls) with traces of white coloring, the barlike chest ornaments, the pro jecting ear ornaments, and the elaborate belts or loincloths. The wide mouths are open to show off sparkling teeth that have been black ened with hematite crystals, which are rare on Veracruz ceramic figures. The black pupils of the wide eyes, on the other hand, are a resinous material called chapapote that is not uncommon on Veracruz figures. The varying details on the costumes give the figures an odd appearance of rank, as if they were performers of some kind or military men in dress uniform. It is a narra tive note unusual among groups of ceramic figures of this period. jj Belt Buckle and Ornamental Plaques China, Tang dynasty (618-906), 7th century Gilt bronze inlaid with glass and pearls, silk backing; 1'/sx20K2 in.

Purchase, Harris Brisbane Dick Fund, The Vincent Astor Foundation Gift, Acquisitions and 2008 Benefit Funds, and John Stewart Kennedy Fund, by exchange, 2009 (2009.60) This is among the finest of the early bronze Buddha images surviving from first-millennium Sri Lanka. The style is closely associated with the Buddhist kingdom of Anuradhapura, where great monastic complexes (mahaviharas) prospered, and communities of monks, both Hinayana and Mahayana, expounded the Buddha's teachings. This Buddha is seated in a meditative yogic position, gesturing the imparting of Buddha-dharma with his raised hand (vitarka-mudra).The torso is erect and the chest full of breath (prana), signifying the presence of inner life, and the naturalism of the form, aided by the use of inlay (probably rock crystal) in the eyes, adds to the realism. The distended earlobes and the hair, raised in a series of tight curls as textually prescribed, evoke the memory of the Buddha's renunciation, when he cut off his hair and gave away his princely adorn ments. The flame-shaped head protuberance (ushnisha) is one of the principal auspicious marks of Buddhahood (lakshanas), here denoting his enlightened state. The Buddha wears a single robe, the uttarasanga, the untailored length of cloth worn by monks, drawn tautly around the body to create a highly animated surface rippling with energy beneath the rhythmically articulated folds. The robe is worn off the right shoul der, in the "southern manner" of Sri Lankan Buddhism. jg The Goddess Durga Slaying the Buffalo Demon (Durga Mahishasuramardini) India (Himachal Pradesh, probably Chamba), 12th century Brass, h. 22'Áin.

This is an ancient and much-favored subject that has been depicted in sculpture since the Kushan period in the second to third century A.D.The combatants are framed by a highly elaborate shrine evoking the temple architec ture of Himachal Pradesh: leogryphs surmount elephants, makaras issue from moldings, and demigods preside in the heavenly heights amid tapering towers and pavilions. The icon is a portable "heavenly palace" in which the epic drama of the precarious victory of order over chaos is enacted for the daily wonderment of devotees. jg Game Piece with Three Men Battling a Bear or a Lioness Northern France, ca. 1125-50 Walrus ivory, d'lam. 23/e in. (6 cm) Provenance: Gertrude Crisp, Little Wenham Hall, Suffolk, from at least 1925; her daughter Margaret Crisp, from 1936; Nicolas Salgo, New York, from at least 1981 to 2005; The Salgo Trust for Education, New York, 2005-10. Gift of The Salgo Trust for Education, New York, in memory of Nicolas M. Salgo, 2010 (2010.109.1) Games of tables, predecessors of modern back gammon (the origins of which can be traced to antiquity), were extremely popular in Europe in the Middle Ages. The checkers, or tablemen, from medieval tables game sets were often dec orated with inventive narrative and allegorical subjects.This unusual disk, all that is left from a thirty-piece set of playing pieces, is deeply carved with a scene showing two men strug gling with a bear or feline as another man drives a spear into the creature's open jaw. Some scholars have identified the scene as an interpretation of the story from the Odyssey in which King Menelaus of Sparta battles the sea god Proteus, transformed here into a bear or a lioness. Several other surviving tablemen depict hunt scenes that also suggest a reliance on the ancient verse ofVirgil, Homer, and Ovid for subject matter.This disk belongs to a group of game pieces from different sets that were prob ably produced in northern France, where there was a continuing interest in classical heroic combat and survival stories. This tableman, along with several other game pieces and two fine liturgical chalices, is part of a large gift to the Museum from The Salgo Trust for Education. ctl Processional Cross Ethiopia (Lasta regioni, 12th—13th century Bronze, h. 12 in. (31.6 cm) Provenance: Private collection, Germany, 1967 (acquired in Addis Ababa market) to 2007; [Sam Fogg, London], Purchase, Tianaderrah Foundation, Daniel and Marian Malcolm, Noah-Sadie K. Wachtel Foundation Inc. and Mr. and Mrs. Paul Ruddock Gifts, 2008 (2008.502) In the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, proces sional crosses were commissioned by individual patrons to be given to religious institutions as acts of devotion. Composed predominantly of bronze and cast by clerics using the lost-wax method, each of these crosses is unique. During liturgical processions and services such vener ated creations were affixed to tall staffs and held aloft to maximize their visual impact. In their formal interpretation of this motif, regional artists have emphasized its identification with the Tree of Life. In this example, the earliest in the Metropolitan's collection from the Lasta region, the central cross is amplified by a multi plicity of outwardly projecting crosses that sug gest organic luxuriance, creating the overall effect of a cross embedded in an intricate arrangement of alternating arched flourishes (though the perforations may have been intro duced not only to heighten the intricacy of the silhouette but also to minimize the weight). The complex configuration relates this cross to a processional cross in the Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, but here the design is more ele gandy attenuated and the execution is crisper and more sharply resolved. al 775-1300</page><page sequence="12">Embroidery Fragment Switzerland, late 13th or early 14th century Silk embroidery on linen plain weave, 1354 χ 21 '/e in. (33.7 χ 53.5 cm) Provenance: Leopold Iklé, Saint Gall, Switzerland; his descendants; sale, Christie, Manson and Woods, South Kensington, December 4, 2007, lot 11; [Sam Fogg, London, until 2010], The Cloisters Collection, 2010(2010.28) On this rare and highly attractive embroidery fragment, alternating roundels of white and yellow enclose beasts and ornamental devices. Each of the two complete roundels contains a bird with its wings spread, its feet extended, and a bough or vine tendril in its beak. In the adjacent partially preserved medallions are dragonlike creatures and a knotlike linear orna mental device. The silk embroidery, in remark ably well-preserved colors of red, olive green, blue, yellow, pale pink, and white, mostly obscures the undyed linen ground, the bottom edge of which preserves a selvage (the other three sides have been cut). The areas of loss in the silk reveal the underdrawing that was applied to the linen to outline the design before it was embroidered using satin and stem stitches. The imagery and the large scale of the bold design (the roundels are each approximately 8% inches in diameter) suggest that the embroidery was intended to be used as furnishing for a secular purpose. pb Portable Mosaic Icon with the Virgin Eleousa Byzantine, probably Constantinople, early 14th century Miniature mosaic set in wax on wood panel with gold, multicolored stones, and gilded copper tesserae; some portions restored; 4% χ 3)4 in. (11.2x8.6 cm) Provenance: Private collection, London, by late 1980s; [Sam Fogg, London, sold 2002]; John C. Weber, New York, 2002-8. Gift of John C. Weber, in honor of Philippe de Montebello, 2008(2008.3521 In the fourteenth century Byzantine artists developed a new art form: micromosaics worked in exceptionally tiny tesserae in a painterly style. These intimate images were made primarily for use in private devotions, and few of them survive. The Museums micro mosaic, which depicts the Virgin Eleousa, the Virgin of Compassion, emphasizes the human ness of the Christ Child, as he reaches forward to touch his head to his mother's cheek. The Virgin lovingly embraces her son, while her mournful gaze invites the viewer to contem plate his future sacrifice and death. On the reverse of this mosaic is an inscrip tion in a late fifteenth-century Humanist hand that identifies it as the icon that moved Saint Catherine of Alexandria to convert to Christi anity in the fourth century. Such labels attest to the popularity of micromosaics in the Latin West, where during the Renaissance they were often inaccurately dated to the first Christian centuries. This icon first came to scholarly attention when it was lent to the Museum's 2004 exhibition "Byzantium: Faith and Power (1261-1557)." hce 14 ¡ RECENT ACQUISITIONS</page><page sequence="13">Attributed to Abu Muhammad 'Abd al-Qayyum ibn Muhammad ibn Karamshah al-Tabrizi Jalayirid Qur'anic Compilation Page Iraq (Baghdad), ca. 1370 Ink, gold, and gouache on paper; 16'/sx 1354 in.

Folios from the manuscript are now dispersed, but the name of the calligrapher, Abu Muhammad 'Abd al-Qayyum ibn Muhammad ibn Karamshah al-Tabrizi, is given in the colophon on a page in a private collection. The colophon does not provide the date of the manuscript or the name of its patron, but the style of the illumination and calligra phy is comparable to that in Qur'ans made for Mamluk patrons in the late fourteenth century and in slightly later copies made for the early Timurid rulers. The manuscript is thought to have been commissioned by a member of the Jalayirid royal family, probably Shaykh Uvays, who reigned from 1356 to 1374 and had a capital at Baghdad.

Bonna Gifts, 2010 (2010.119) The refinement of the International Gothic Style and the flowering of the visual arts in Prague at the court of Emperor Charles IV and his successors are both apparent in this sheet, which is among the few drawings of this period to have survived. Most of these drawings are likely to have once been part of pattern books, which artists kept in their workshops to provide them with models for paintings and illuminations. This draw ing, one of the most outstanding of its kind and appar ently unique in its use of color, probably served as a model for representations of the Virgin. Its style has been linked to a sheet (now in the Cleveland Museum of Art) from the so-called Seitenstetten Antiphonary, made for a Bohemian monastery about 1405, and it can be attributed to an artist active in the workshop that produced that manuscript. Its importance as a relatively precisely attributed early fifteenth-century drawing is matched by its exquisite beauty. sa 1275-1410</page><page sequence="14">Forehead and Poll Plate from a Shaffron Tibet, 15th—18th century Iron, gold, and silver; 1614 x5ye in.

Purchase, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Gift, 2008 12008.291) Most of the surviving Tibetan shaffrons are purely functional pieces of armor with minimal if any decoration. This outstanding example is one of the few exceptions to that rule. It is made up of two plates from the center of a shaffron, or head defense, that must originally have been part of an extremely elaborate set of horse armor belonging to a high-ranking Tibetan or Mongolian nobleman. It is the only known shaffron decorated in this style, with dragons amid scrollwork pierced, chiseled, and engraved on the thick iron ground and dama scened in gold and silver. The same materials, techniques, and motifs are often seen (although usually on a thinner iron ground) on Tibetan saddle plates, ritual objects such as censers, and luxury items such as pen and cup cases and the reinforcing straps found on the entrance doors of important temples and monasteries. The only other known Tibetan shaffron with truly notable decoration is also in the Metropolitan Museum. That piece is worked in a completely different manner, however, with a textilelike pattern in gold and silver damascening on its flat iron plates. dlr Attributed to the workshop of Ghaybi al-Tawrizi Active in Tabriz and Damascus, mid-15th century Tile Panel Probably Syria (Damascus), ca. 1430 Stonepaste molded and painted under a transparent glaze, complete panel 45 χ 45 in.

Madina and Dr. Marilyn Jenkins-Madina, 2009 (2009.59.21 This set of sixteen ceramic tiles comes from a square panel that decorated the interior of a building, perhaps the mosque and tomb com plex of Ghars al-Din al-Khalil al-Tawrizi (died 1423) in Damascus, which contains tiles of a similar style. The blue and white palette, flower sprays, and composite scrolls of this panel and others from the tomb are thought to reflect the popularity of Chinese ceramics and decorative motifs in Syria in the fifteenth century. They were probably made by the workshop of Ghaybi al-Tawrizi, whose name is written on some of the tiles still in situ.The suffix al-Tawrizi indi cates that Ghaybi, like Ghars al-Din, was origi nally from the city ofTabriz in northwest Iran. He must have trained in Tabriz, a noted ceramic center, before moving to Damascus in the early fifteenth century and finally settling in Cairo, where additional tiles signed by him or his workshop have been found. A ewer also in the Museum's collection and a tile panel from the mosque of Sayyida Nafisa in Cairo signed by Ibn al-Ghaybi are evidence that Ghaybi's son continued in the trade.

Tavitian, Karen Bedrosian Richardson, Elizabeth Mugar Eveil lard and Arax Simsarian Gifts and funds from various donors, 2010(2010.108) Illuminated manuscripts are among the finest works of Armenian art, for the "Word" as recorded in the Bible has been the focus of veneration in the Armenian Church since its founding in the early fourth century. During the fifteenth century in the region of Khizan, near Lake Van, Armenian artists developed a dramatic style to illuminate the narrative of the gospels. Among the greatest of those artists was Khach'atur of Khizan, the probable illuminator of this gospel. Following the Armenian tradi tion, these gospels' eleven surviving narrative images are grouped as a unit before the canon tables at the beginning of the text. The initial images of the Nativity of Christ and the Pre sentation in the Temple (illustrated here) are vividly colored, while those that follow display dramatically posed figures against the plain ground of the paper. In the Nativity scene Christ's future death is evoked by his shroud like dress and the manger's rectangular red form, which suggests the porphyry slab on which, according to tradition, he was anointed for burial. Of the Evangelist portraits that marked the opening of the four gospels, those of Matthew and Luke survive. In modern times, Arshile Gorky would identify the Khizan style as an influence on his development as an artist. hce Chalice Central Europe, 1462 Silver, gilded silver, filigree enamel, and pearls; h.

Furthermore, paintings in the fragile technique of oil on paper laid down on wood rarely survive. Rather than being cut down from a larger composition, the tightly edited image was probably planned as an inde pendent portrait. The painter may have found it practical to continue to work up in paint a likeness that he had already begun as a drawing on paper. Closely observed and meticulously rendered in the manner of early Netherlandish painting, this portrait also conveys a psychological inten sity and objective realism that relate it to the work of Hugo van der Goes. In its subtle illu mination and attentive modeling, it is similar to male faces in Hugo s religious works, especially the Monteforte and Portinari altarpieces of about 1470 and 1473-78. Indeed, the costume of the sitter—a purple robe with a fur collar and a deep green chaperon, or hat, with trailing cor nets at the sides—dates to about 1470-75. Inde pendent portraits by Hugo are extremely rare, and further investigations will help to situate this splendid example in its proper place within the context of Netherlandish portraiture. mwa Gerard David Netherlandish, ca. 1455-1523 Studies of Ten(?)

Most of David's drawings are exe cuted in metalpoint on prepared paper. Some, like this one, are inscribed with numbers in a fifteenth- or sixteenth-century hand that prob ably record their original order in the sketch book to which they must have belonged, and they show the same damage, probably caused by humidity, in the lower half of the sheet. Unlike earlier Northern artists, David used the stylus in a loose manner, and the liveliness and fresh ness of observation strongly suggest that this drawing was made directly from life. None of the heads appears in any of David s known paintings, but certainly it was sketches of this kind that allowed him to imbue the figures in his painted works with striking realism and profound humanity. The figure at the right in the recently discovered sketches in black chalk on the back of the sheet is preparatory to one of David's major paintings, The Flaying of the Corrupt Judge of 1498 in the Groeninge museum, Bruges.

Stylistically the painting of the paten is close to that of a large altarpiece devoted to Saint Sigismund also produced by Wertinger for the cathedral at Freising. Represented is the patriarch Abraham, freshly victorious in battle, meeting the king and high priest Melchizedek, who at once gives Abraham bread and wine, blesses him, and takes a tenth of his booty. Melchizedek, wearing Episcopal robes and a crown, kneels before Abraham and holds a chalice and a paten with a loaf of bread resting on it, clearly placing the scene in a Eucharistie context.

The image was adapted from Byzantine icons brought to Flanders in the fifteenth century and made popular through copies by David and his predecessor Hans Memling. Different from the Byzantine models is the freshness of obser vation evident in Christ's physiognomy and the delicate articulation of the hands, which were based on David's metalpoint studies after life. David worked as both a panel painter and a manuscript illuminator. Such tighdy cropped images of Christ were a standard feature in illu minated Books of Hours, where they often accompanied the "Salve sancta facies" prayer. Around 1500 David produced several diptychs of the Virgin and Child and a Christ Bidding Fare well to His Mother that are similar in scale and treatment to this Christ Blessing. The arresting psychological presence of all of these images was intended to intensify the meditational experi ence of the viewer, especially when such tiny personal icons were handheld as inspiration for the recitation of daily prayers. mwa 20 I RECENT ACQUISITIONS</page><page sequence="19">Andrea Briosco, called Riccio Italian, 1470-1532 Oil Lamp Padua, ca. 1515 Bronze, h, 9% in.

In the course of composing the monument that was his masterwork, the Paschal Candlestick of 1507-16 in the Basilica of Sant'Antonio, he brought superlative technique and a familiarity with classical motifs to a host of bronze statuettes and decorative utensils. This lamp, cast by the lost-wax method, takes the shape of an ancient galleon whose decoration combines imagery from land and sea. Riccio rotated his wax model on a stick, using a wooden tool to bestow deft, delicate touches to the arrangement of arcs responding to arcs that occupies space so commandingly. The metal shows few signs of tooling after the casting. The two tapered friezes on either side display children sporting with rams, and a large bearded mask terminates the lid above the vessel's stern. Known as the "Rothschild lamp," this is probably the latest of three surviving lamps by Riccio, preceded by the "Cadogan lamp" in the V&amp;A in London and the "Morgan lamp" in the Frick Col lection in New York.

Although his drawings are rare—not even thirty are accepted today—almost all of them count among the highlights of sixteenth-century Netherlandish art. A recent and unexpected addition to Lucas's small drawn oeuvre, this drawing complements one of comparable size and technique in the Kupferstichkabinett, Berlin, that depicts the Virgin looking up in surprise at hearing the archangel's message. Both were presumably made as designs for stained glass windows. In these drawings Lucas married the monumentality of figures he admired in contemporary Italian art with a drawing style that is thoroughly Northern—a rich and subtle pattern of lines, hatch ings, and cross-hatchings that lends great plasticity to the figures.

Goldner, curator of drawings and prints at the Metropolitan, this drawing has been identified as Andrea del Sarto's study for the main figure in his monumental fresco The Trib ute Presented to Julius Caesar in Egypt, painted in 1521 in the salone, or great hall, at the Villa Medici in Poggio a Caiano, near Florence. The drawing, executed in Sarto's favorite medium of red chalk, offers a precise portrait of Julius Caesar, based on the design of marble busts or coins representing the Roman emperor that were widely known during the Renaissance. The artist's actual source may have been either an antique or a fifteenth-century Florentine work. Caesars profile and especially his long aquiline nose were carefully drawn with a fine, rela tively continuous outline, then reinforced, while the rest of the head is more freely executed, with softer contours and delicate internal model ing. The faint exploratory lines along the profile, especially the nose, attest to the artist's concern for getting these features right. Commissioned by Pope Leo X and his half brother Cardinal Giulio de' Medici, the fresco cemented Sarto's position as the leading painter in Florence, soon after he had returned from his visit to the French court in 1518. cbb 1520-29 23</page><page sequence="22">Guidobaldo II della Rovere, Duke of Urbino Italy, ca. 1580 Oil on copper, frame of gilded copper; frame 7/bx 4% in.

His aristocratic pose and rich civilian dress belie the fact that Guidobaldo was a professional soldier (condottiere) who maintained his state by hiring out his services as a military commander (alluded to by the armor and batons of command behind him). Doubdess copied from a larger portrait on canvas, this was one of a series of twelve miniatures on copper portraying members ot the della Rovere family that Guidobaldo's son Francesco Maria II commissioned in about 1580.The miniatures had matching gilded frames, each inscribed on the reverse with the subject's name and title. Neither the identity of the painter nor the fate of the other miniatures, which passed by inheritance into the Medici collection in Florence, is known. This fine portrait enhances the Metropolitans display of Renais sance parade armor by Filippo Negroli of Milan. The Museum pos sesses a dolphin-shaped right shoulder defense from the same Negroli armor as the helmet and breastplate illustrated in Guidobaldo's portrait.

Gift ofBernice and Jerome Zwanger, 2008 (2008.638.1) Hunting equipment made for the Saxon court was among the most splendid in Europe. No exception, this powder flask is a virtuoso masterpiece of Renaissance iron chiseling fully in keeping with the sophisticated tastes of its owner, Prince-Elector August I of Saxony (ruled 1553-86), founder of the Dresden Kunstkammer. The flasks body is embossed in high relief with five medallions.The scene in the center medallion, represent ing Abraham's sacrifice of Isaac, is based on a woodcut illustration by Jost Amman in a Bible published in Frank furt in 1572. The surrounding medallions enclose the arms of Saxony and of Denmark, the AA monogram of August and his wife, Anna of Denmark, and crossed swords, the arms of the archmarshal of the Holy Roman Empire, the exalted post held by the ruling duke of Sax ony. Etched on the back of the flask is a pelican in her piety. August collected a number of works in chiseled iron, including rapiers, matching daggers, and at least two other flasks like this one but with different biblical scenes in the center medallions and different etched motifs on the back (one is in the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the other in a private collection). swp 24 I RECENT ACQUISITIONS</page><page sequence="23">Possibly Hernando Solis Spanish, active late 16th century Beaked Ewer ( Jarro de Pico) Spain (Valladolid), late 16th century Silver, parcel-gilt; h. 7% in.

Purchase, Friends of European Sculpture and Decorative Arts Gifts, in memory of Olga Raggio, 2009 (2009.227) A luxury utensil of near-mythic status, the jarro de pico was the quintessential domestic object of the so-called golden age of Hispanic silver. These ornately beaked ewers, intended for hand washing at the tables of the wealthy, typically meld elements of Renaissance style with the geometrically conceived forms of the Philip II and Philip III periods, or the last half of the sixteenth and early part of the seventeenth century. In the jarro de pico the austerity of the ewer's turned body is offset by the powerfully modeled detail on the spout, which is often reminiscent of the grotesque designs popular in Renais sance Italy. The sculptural vigor of this ewer's spout, in the form of a bearded man with a foliate crown and pointed animal's ears, contrasts with the sleekly functional, almost ergonomie form of the flamboyant handle, which features a spiky curve at its base and an unusually prominent thumb scroll that extends its height. The purity of the body is accented only by gilded horizontal bands and moldings. Inside the foot of this jarro de pico are a mark bearing the arms of the city ofValladolid and a partial mark that has been tentatively identified as that of the silversmith Hernando Solis.

Purchase, Patti Cadby Birch Gift, 200912009.343) The Futuh al-Haramayn explains the rituals of the pilgrimage (hajj) all Muslims must complete once during their lifetime and describes the holy sites they can visit in the cities of Mecca and Medina. The text was written by Muhi ai-Din Lari, completed in India in 1505-6, and copied many times afterward with a standard set of illustrations— bird's-eye views of the monuments and sites with labels for the reader. Most known copies were made in Mecca during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, but the book was also popular in Turkey and India. This is the first copy thought to have been made in Bukhara. All copies of the Futuh al-Haramayn include a painting of the Kaaba, the monument at Mecca to which all Muslims pray, shown here as the black-shrouded rectangular struc ture at the center of the domed arcade representing the sacred enclosure called al-masjid al-haram.Two details indicate that the manuscript must have been painted in the late six teenth century: the first gate into the enclosure is labeled "blocked" (sadda), thus reflecting the closing of this gate sometime between 1569 and 1573, and there are seven minarets, thus including the one added by the Ottoman sultan Suleyman in 1565—66.

In a style sixteenth-century Flemish weavers called "English fashion," it was intended to hang between the cornice and the dado of a wood-paneled room. The tapestry is attributed on stylistic, iconographie, and technical grounds to Flemish weavers who sought refuge from the religious tumult of the era by relocating to England, probably London. The tapestry is notable for its remarkable use of color in the construction of forms and the effects of light and cast shadow. The idyllic landscape contrasts vignettes of pas toral relaxation with a hunting scene flanking a central moated building. In the magpie spirit that circumstances demanded of them, rather than working from a brand-new design, the weavers artfully assembled the elements of the tapestry cartoon around a reused design source: the central manor house takes its inspiration from a woodcut representing King Solo mon's palace by the Swiss artist Jost Amman. eahc Hunters in a Landscape England (probably Londoni, ca. 1575-95 Wool and silk, 5 ft. 107/b in. χ 15ft.

In addition to his achievements as a painter of fresco cycles and altarpieces, he launched the vogue for carefully constructed landscapes in which nature is transformed by the imagination into an idyllic setting for biblical or mythological stories. The subject of this one is based on John 1:29: "The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, who taketh away the sin of the world." This beautifully preserved work was described by Annibale 's biographer, Malvasia, in 1678, when it was in the famous Farnese collection in Parma. It seems to date to about 1600—1602, when Annibale was fasci nated by Roman sculpture, as is evident in the figure of Saint John the Baptist. Anni bale sometimes employed assistants to realize his ideas, and some scholars have suggested that this picture may have been painted by Francesco Albani, who assumed a dominant role in Annibale's workshop after about 1604 and who later painted versions of the theme. None of Albani's paintings, however, attains the quality of this one. kc Jacob de Gheyn Netherlandish, 1565-1629 Studies of a Saddled Horse and a Horse with a Boy Astride; Study of a Bean Plant Ca.1603 Pen and brown ink, with green and brown watercolor and gray wash on verso; 7 χ 11Ά in.

This double sided study sheet, which has only recently resurfaced, exemplifies the artist s careful and sensitive observation of nature, as well as his virtuoso drawing technique, which was rooted in his training as a printmaker. Studies of the same horse are found on two other drawings, one in Amsterdam (Stichtung P. en N. de Boer) and the other in Paris (École Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts).The latter sheet also bears sketches related to a print dated 1603, which provides an approximate date for the Museum's drawing. The provenance of this sheet can be traced back to several of the most outstanding eighteenth-century Dutch collectors of drawings. One of them wrote the words "Keer Om" (Turn over) at the lower left to point to the study of a bean plant on the back, one of the rare examples of watercolors by De Gheyn. sa * I I Jacob de Gheyn Netherlandish, 1565-1629 Studies of a Saddled Horse and a Horse with a Boy Astride; Study of a Bean Plant Ca. 1603 Pen and brown ink, with green and brown watercolor and gray wash on verso; 7 χ 1154 in.

He died rela tively young, at the peak of his fame, leaving few works. His most frequent subjects are scenes of merriment, with music making, drinking, and fortune-telling. This figure, a sol dier of fortune singing a love madrigal that is unique in Valentin's work, may be emblematic of"Amador" (Spanish for "Lover Boy"), the sobriquet the artist took when, in 1624, he joined the society of foreign artists in Rome known as the Bentveughels (Birds of a Feather). The picture is painted with a directness and vividness for which the only parallel is in the early work of Velazquez. It belonged to the prestigious collection of Cardinal Mazarin, minister to Louis XIV and one of the great collectors of the seventeenth century. kc Shirt of Mail and Plate India and Iran, plates dated A.H. 1042 (1632-33) Iron, steel, gold, leather; h. 31 in.

The plates are dec orated with two-color gold incised through to the dark oxidized iron ground with Qur'anic inscriptions in elegant calligraphy entwined with delicate foliate scrolls. An engraved inscription on the inside of the right breastplate identifies the armor as a gift of Sayf Khan, a high-ranking Mughal prince and military official at the court of Shah Jahan, who ruled from 1627 to 1658. Two additional inscriptions inside the plates record valuations assigned to the armor in the later-years of Shah Jahan's rule, confirming that the armor was indeed the emperor's. The plates were at some unknown time fitted into a mail shirt that may date as early as the fifteenth cen tury and is possibly of Iranian origin, produced in the territory ruled by the Ak Koyunlu, or White Sheep Turkomans. Its thick, double riveted rings are stamped with many of the ninety-nine names of God. The plethora of inscriptions had a talismanic value, as did the fish-shaped buckles at the center. Arguably one of the most beautiful surviving Mughal armors, this is also among the earliest dated examples and the only one that can be direcdy associated with Shah Jahan. swp 30 I RECENT ACQUISITIONS</page><page sequence="29">Maternity Figure Nigeria, Mbembe peoples, 17th century Wood, h. 38 Yi in.

Ross, David and Holly Ross, Noah-Sadie K. Wachtel Foundation Inc. and Mrs. Howard J. Barnet Gifts, 2010 (2010.256) This spectral relic of a maternity figure was carved hundreds of years ago by an Mbembe artist working at the confluence of two major sculptural traditions—those of Cameroon and Nigeria. It is one of only a dozen Mbembe works created as early as the seventeenth century, making them the oldest wood sculp tures to have survived south of the western Sudan. Each of these figures appears to have originally been an integral part of a monu mental carved drum positioned at the epicen ter ofMbembe spiritual life. The exposure of the surviving examples to the elements over extended periods of time has resulted in intensive weathering, which has become a dramatic dimension of their aesthetic. A great deal of detail still remains intact throughout the composition of this figure: the fingers melt fluidly into the knees, the ears are crisply outlined, the deep eye sockets create a com manding gaze, and an expression of contem plative introspection remains apparent. A synthesis of intense rawness and quiet poetry, this icon interprets the fundamental relation ship between mother and child in a highly original way. The placement of the child hor izontally across the mother's torso, with its legs wrapped around her body, emphatically underscores their profound connection.

The House of Kano served as official painters to the imperial and military elite for more than four centuries. In addition to excelling in the family style, Eino is widely known as the author of History of Painting in This Realm (Honchö gasili), the first major history of painting written in Japan. His text, based on drafts by his father, was heavily influenced by Chinese histories of the subject, reflecting a continental bias that is also evident in his and other Kano artists' paintings. While the felicitous theme of these handsome small-format screens, One Hundred Boys, first appeared in China during the Song dynasty (960—1279), they are indebted to prototypes from the later Ming dynasty (1368-1644), when the subject also appeared widely on ceramics and other decorative arts objects.The detail, variety, and sheer number of figures, executed in fine-quality pigments, indi cate that the family who commissioned these screens was aristo cratic.

Cockcroft, Bequest of Fiorarne Waterbury, in memory of her father, John I. Waterbury, and Gift of Robert H. Ellsworth, by exchange, 2008 (2008.636) The theme of Zhong Kui, found in both painting and the decorative arts, is often traced to a poet of the Tang dynasty (618—906) who passed the challenging civil service examina tions but was banned from the court due to his disfigured appearance. He committed suicide, but later returned from hell to protect one of the Tang emperors from the demons who were haunting his sleep. He is thus popularly known as "the demon-queller," a protector against evil. In this amusing carving Zhong Kui sits on a recumbent demon under a gnarled pine tree. A kneeling attendant offers a glass of wine, an additional demon stands behind Zhong Kui and cleans his ear, and two others push and pull a reluctant deer toward the semi mythical figure. The Chinese art of bamboo carving flourished during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, particularly in the area around the city of Shanghai. Bamboo ornaments like this one, as well as scholarly implements such as brush pots and brush rests, were produced for the literati, the wealthy, and well educated merchants. The quality of the carving and the skillful use of the natural shape of the bamboo to create a complicated group of figures help date this piece to the seventeenth century.

The depiction of complete flowering plants, carved in low relief and placed in a symmetri cal arrangement, is the hallmark of this style, which had its genesis in the reign of the Mughal emperor Jahangir (1605-27). In accor dance with their patrons' interests, artists of this period studied European herbáis, borrowing the techniques of combining front and side views and infusing the petals and leaves of the plants with a sense of movement. During the reign ofjahangir's son Shahjahan (1627-58), and especially from the 1630s on, the plant studies were transformed into decorative motifs, arranged in rows to cover textiles, objects, and architectural spaces. As they were incorporated into stylized, symmetrically balanced compo sitions like those on the carved dadoes and inlaid panels at the Taj Mahal, the plants lost their botanical specificity. The use of wood was limited in Mughal architecture, and little of it remains. These doors are thus rare survivals of a tradition known through only a few other examples, including a pair of similar doors in the David Collection, Copenhagen.

Purchase, The Vincent Astor Foundation Gift, 2010 (2010.54) Fa Ruozhen is known for his fantastical moun tainscapes permeated with clouds. This impos ing landscape, painted in 1684 when the artist was seventy-two years old and still in his prime, is an exceptionally well-realized composition by this important scholar-artist of the early Qing dynasty. While most of Fa's paintings are on paper, this work is executed on silk, which suggests that it was intended for an important recipient. Paintings by Fa are rare and seldom come on the market. This handsome piece fills a gap in the Museum's collection and enhances its outstanding coverage of the seventeenth century—one of the most creative eras in Chinese painting. Like a great cumulonimbus cloud, the land scape billows upward in roiling layers of earth punctuated by misty vales harboring half concealed groves of trees. The composition is conceived in the classic "three distances" manner, with foreground trees and piled-up boulders giving way to a ridge line in the middle ground that is in turn overshadowed by distant rugged peaks. But Fa flattened forms and compressed distances to maximize the verticality of his restless landscape. Aided by the stream that meanders through the mountains, the judiciously placed passages of mist and cloud sustain the illusion of separa tion between the three distances, giving depth and mass to the agitated outcrops. mkh 1600-1700</page><page sequence="34">and bridge. Because its label is lost and no comparable seventeenth-century viol has yet come to light, dating this instrument and attributing it to a particular maker or workshop is difficult. The date 1640-65 is based on con struction details and decorative style. The viol's top is assembled from five bent staves, instead of a carved single board, and the ornamental carnation inscribed with a hot needle just below the fingerboard imitates embroidery patterns fashionable in England about 1600 and after. Furthermore, the portrait of a young man that decorates the viol's finial, or head, is intrigu ingly similar to one in The Yarmouth Collection, a still life commissioned in 1665 (Casde Museum, Norwich, England). hh Attributed to Rai Kalyan Das, known as Chitarman II Indian, active 1715-60 Nawab Muzaffer 'Ali Khan on Horseback India, ca. 1730 Ink, opaque watercolor, and gold on paper; 7 % χ 9% in.

Purchase, Friends of Islamic Art Gifts, 2009 (2009.317) A Persian inscription on the reverse identifies the subject of this portrait as Muzaffer'Ali Khan, who was appointed governor of the province of Ajmer by the emperor Muhammad Shah in 1725 and was killed in 1739 while fighting honorably in the Battle of Karnal. The portrait can be attributed to Rai Kalyan Das, who was called Chitarman II after the legend ary seventeenth-century artist who worked for Shah Jahan. Under the guidance of Rai Kalyan Das, considered the master artist of the period, from about 1715 to 1760 Mughal court paint ing experienced a resurgence, although the size of the workshop and the scale of its production never regained the heights they had reached in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centu ries. Rai Kalyan Das's work is known from seven signed or ascribed paintings and draw ings. His paintings are characterized by crisp detailing and large passages of white spiced with a few bold colors. The graceful line of the horse's back and its distinctively angled tail support the addition of this previously unknown portrait, perhaps a preparatory drawing for a painting, to his oeuvre. ms Division Viol England, ca. 1640-65 Spruce and maple, I 45Î4 in.

Saint Ignatius is distinguished by his heart shaped face and the Latin motto of the society, "ad maiorem dei gloriam" (for the greater glory of God), displayed on the pages of the book held by the angel beside him. Saint Francis has a walking staff, sign of the peripatetic missionary, and parts his short cape, the mantellina, near his heart, an allusion to his frequent moments of mystical union with God. The two saints are conceived in a conservative spirit, retaining the long, slowly unwinding movements of late sixteenth-century Venetian sculpture, to which Francesco Bertos added brisk, shimmery tooling. It is chiefly the frolicsome demeanor and retroussé noses of the atten dant angels that bespeak Bertos, usually seen as a confectioner of quasi acrobatic groups, whether of bronze or marble. These well-ponderated saints, which must have flanked a Jesuit altar of Baroque splendor, stand out as the best of his figures. jdd Ί 640 -1730 Δ!</page><page sequence="36">\l vi Ik '$ \ \ the style of the dress came into vogue.

He seems to have specialized in the craft of lacquer, a distinc tive feature of the art of this period. The subjects of his paintings are comparable to those favored by the best-known artists of his time, a tight-knit circle that included Hajji Muhammad, who spe cialized in lacquer objects with Europeanizing landscapes, and his brother Muhammad Zaman, under whom 'Ali Ashraf trained. His signature on one end of the box, "zi ba'd-i Muhammad,'Ali Ashraf shud" (After Muhammad, 'Ali Ashraf is noblest), is a punning refer ence to his teacher, and the irises he combined with architectural views in its decoration could be a nod to Muhammad Zaman's well-known series of iris studies.

Delacorte, 2009 (2009.145) Benedict XIV, who was elevated to the papacy in 1740, is shown wear ing the ermine-lined cape (mezzetta) and hat (camauro) characteristic of papal winter garb. The stole is decorated with the papal keys and the armorial device of the pope's family, the noble Lambertini of Bologna. Pierre Subleyras had been chosen in 1740 to paint the state portrait of the pope (now in the Musée Condé, Chantilly), but this informal like ness painted six years later takes us much closer to the man whom Hor ace Walpole described as "a priest without insolence or interest, a prince without favorites, a pope without nephews." Benedict was an avid stu dent of the Church, but he was also a witty and spirited conversational ist. (He once declared: "The pope orders, the cardinals do not obey, and the people do as they please.") Subleyras conceived his portrait as a rich harmony of reds and golds. In 1743 Subleyras received from Benedict the prestigious commis sion for an altarpiece in Saint Peter's; the modello for that altarpiece, dated 1746—the same year this portrait was painted—was acquired by the Metropolitan in 2007.

In this scene Rinaldo, a Christian knight on his way to the Holy Land, is detained by the pagan enchantress Armida until two of his fellow knights break the spell. Fragonard's drawing imagines the decisive moment of Rinaldo 's victory, as he brandishes his sword overhead in the act of chopping down Armida 's massive myrtle tree, thereby dispelling its enchantments. This sheet was made soon after Fragonard had returned to Paris after having spent five years in Rome, from 1756 to 1761. Exposure to the masters of the Italian Baroque led him to move beyond his early style, which had been indebted to the sweet Rococo manner of his teacher François Boucher, and to endow his figures and compositions with a new energy and dynamism. Along with this stylistic shift emerged a marked predilection for sketchlike canvases and large, painterly drawings. pvs 40 I RECENT ACQUISITIONS</page><page sequence="39">John Singleton Copley American (1738-1815) Ebenezer Storer Jr. Mrs. Ebenezer Storer Jr. (Elizabeth Green) Ca. 1767 Pastel on paper mounted on canvas, each 23'/s χ 17% in.

Jesup Fund and Lila Acheson Wallace Gift, 200812008.249.2, 1) John Singleton Copley produced at least fifty five pastel portraits before he left America for England in 1774, a rare achievement for a colo nial painter in such a costly, rare, and painstak ing medium. Among the clients willing to trust Copley with renderings other than in oil was the Storer family of Boston. In 1767 Copley drew portraits of Ebenezer and Mary Storer, their daughter, Mary (Mrs. Edward Green), and their son, Ebenezer Jr., and his wife, Elizabeth. All five portraits are now in the Metropolitan Museum. These last two came to the Museum in 1995 as a loan to the exhibition "John Singleton Copley in America" and remained here until they joined the permanent collec tion in 2008. Copley took full advantage of the brilliance afforded by pastel crayons to re-create Ebenezer Storer's figured silk damask banyan, the soft pile of his velvet turban, and the stubble on his side burns and cheeks. He had ordered a full array of the crayons from the great Swiss master Jean-Etienne Liotard but had never seen a work in the medium, making his accomplishment all the more astonishing. crb 1761 -67 41</page><page sequence="40">Attributed to Thomas Affleck American, born Scotland, 1740-1795 Armchair Philadelphia, ca. 1768 Mahogany and white oak with modern yellow silk upholstery, 40 χ 27% χ 255Ίί in.

Each piece is emblematic of the particular dynamic of the furniture trade in that colonial city during the 1760s and 1770s, when it was a haven for skilled and ambitious London-trained artisans anxious for personal inde pendence and home to a clientele desirous of the latest London style but insistent upon local manufacture. Thus it is a pleasure to add to that group an example from the most famous set of Philadelphia seating furniture, the stately and superbly carved open-arm chairs almost certainly made for John Penn, grandson ofWilliam and the last governor of colonial Pennsylvania, by Thomas Affleck. Penn, recently minted as governor, arrived in Philadelphia in 1763. He married Ann Allen, daughter of Chief Justice William Allen, in 1766 and purchased a grand house on Third Street in 1768. Affleck, who had moved from Scotland to London in 1760, also arrived in Philadel phia in 1763, a copy of Chippendale under his arm. Its plate 17, two "French Chairs," was the inspiration for the masterful chairs he made for Penn. mhh Bernhard Heinrich Weyhe German, 1702-1782 Tureen and Stand Augsburg, 1769-71 Silver, partially gilded; h. 10ft in.

The sophisticated play of textures, daring juxtaposition of plain and light catching areas with detailed Rococo decoration, and whimsical sculp tural elements reflect the commanding originality of the Augsburg artisans, particularly Bernhard Heinrich Weyhe, the maker of this piece and the leading Augsburg master. The touch of exotic chinoiserie in the pagoda-shaped outline of the tureen's lid, so en vogue at the time, exem plifies Weyhes contributions to the Rococo style, which helped to define its interpretation in southern Germany. His creations are also famous for their highly sculptural finíais. On this one, an elegant young woman in hunting costume holds a hooded falcon as a fox howls in the background. Falconry was one of the rare hunting sports that feudal ladies were allowed to participate in. The fox may allude to the contents of the game stew that would have been served in the tureen at hunting banquets, which at the time were lavish court rituals.

It may represent the scene in which Rama's brothers Bharata and Satrughna visit the hermit Bharadvaja while en route from Ayodhya (visible in the background here) to find Rama and persuade him to return from his exile in the forest. The brothers pay respect to the ascetic in his rustic retreat, and he, according to Valmiki's text, in turn enter tains their troops with miraculous spectacles. Drawings and preparatory sketches provide a glimpse of the exploratory journey taken by an artist such as the great Punjab court painter Nainsukh and of the collaborative nature of the art produced in studios like those at the Punjab courts of Guler or Kangra in the late eighteenth century. Drawings like this one, intended to serve as a study for a painting, were on occasion intentionally left unfinished. Cre ated by the renowned master who headed the studio, they served as a guide to others in the atelier as they produced finished paintings in his style.

Richardson Gifts, 2010(2010.24) After his success as the leading sculptor at the Imperial Court in Vienna in the 1760s, Franz Messerschmidt was prompted by personal and professional crises to leave for the provinces, and by 1777 he had settled in Pressburg (today Bratislava). There he concentrated on a series of character heads, completing more than sixty in his preferred media of tin alloy and alabaster. While they acknowledge the long-standing artistic tradition relating facial expressions to emotions, these busts are highly original in their combination of realism and abstraction. A few of the subjects, like this one, are deeply introspective (an early critic called them "refus ers"). With powerful simplicity the sculptor portrayed a balding, blocky man with his head sinking to his chest, his concentric wrinkles and symmetrical jowls creating tense patterns. The meaning of the busts has been long debated. The series likely reflects Messer schmidt's awareness of contemporary medical theories like his Viennese neighbor Franz Anton Mesmer's belief that outward senses connect to inner emotions. However one interprets it, the series was exceptional in eighteenth-century sculpture. The busts' reductive simplicity presaged modern Minimalism, and Messerschmidt's idea of rendering serial states of mind was a novel project in a pre-Freudian world. iw Circle of Bhawani Das Great Indian Fruit Bat India (Calcutta), ca. 1777-82 Pencil, ink, and watercolors on paper; IVA χ 32% in.

Sackler, Theresa Sackler and Family, 2008 (2008.312) In 1777 Sir Elijah Impey, chief justice of Bengal between 1774 and 1782, and his wife, Lady Mary, hired local artists to record the specimens of Indian flora and fauna they collected at their estate in Calcutta. Over the next five years, at least 326 paintings of plants, animals, and birds were made for the Impeys. On most of these works the name of one of three artists—Bhawani Das, Shaykh Zayn al-Din, or Ram Das—appears along with the Hindi name of the animal and the phrase, in English, "In the collection of Lady Impey at Calcutta." Although this painting bears no such inscription, it is closely related to another painting of a bat by Bhawani Das, and it has always been associated with Impey patronage. One can imagine Bhawani Das and the anonymous artist of this painting working side by side, observing the animals, but whereas Bhawani Das's painting depicts a tawny-colored female bat cen tered on the page with both wings outstretched, his fellow artist has created an asymmetrical composition in shades of gray and black of an emphatically male bat with one wing dramatically unfurled.

Lehman Bequest, 2010(2010.138-141) This magnificent pair of royal kettle drums was made for the Royal Life Guards of George III (1738-1820), king of Great Britain and Ireland and elector of Hanover, whose royal coat of arms they bear. These ceremonial instruments would have been played by a drummer on horseback accom panied by similarly mounted trumpeters leading the royal procession for state events. Sets of silver kettle drums were made for royals from the seventeenth through the nineteenth century as symbols of splen dor and wealth. Only a handful of sets survive, as many were melted down for the immense amount of precious material they contained. This is the oldest of four pairs built for English monarchs of the House of Hanover; two later pairs remain in the possession of the British Crown, and a set commissioned by William IV in the 1830s is in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. The original crimson banners that would have been draped around the lower portion of the drums while they were being played have also survived.

Gift of Mrs. Charles Wrightsman, 2009 (2009.357) Francis Wheatley, whose father was a London tailor, received some formal training at William Shipley's academy in London and in 1762 and 1763 won prizes for his figure drawings. In 1769 he was among the first students admitted to the Royal Academy. He was elected a mem ber and in 1774 a director of London's Society of Artists. Wheatley worked in both oils and watercolors, at first painting landscapes and small full-length portraits, the success of which led him to take up the conversation piece (a group portrait of family members or friends in a landscape or an interior), of which The Saith ivaite Family is an elegant example. Although it has not as yet been possible to confirm the identity of the sitters, the name Saithwaite is commonly found in Lancashire. On the mantle shelf is basalt ware similar in design to Wedg wood, and on the floor is a Turkey carpet. The woman wears a bright summer dress with a gauze fichu and a stylish hat decorated with blue ribbons and ostrich plumes. Wheatley had not previously been repre sented in the Museum's collection, and this canvas rounds out its display of group portraits by English painters, from William Hogarth to Sir Joshua Reynolds. kbb 1770-85 45</page><page sequence="44">Royal Porcelain Manufactory, Sèvres French, established 1740 Pair of Vases Sèvres, 1789 Hard-paste porcelain, gilded bronze, marble; h. 91/e in. (23 cm) Marked with interlaced Ls with a crown above, the date letters mm, and an anchor (unidentified painter's mark) Provenance: Mme Albert Bordeaux; private collection, Normandy; [Michele Beiny, New York], Wrightsman Fund, in honor of Edith de Montebello, 2008(2008.529,530) Made in 1789, on the eve of the French Revo lution, this pair of vases reflects the superb quality and luxuriousness achieved by the Royal Porcelain Manufactory at Sèvres at the peak of its production. The vases were made to be purely decorative, and their diminutive scale was especially well suited to the intimate inte riors that were in vogue in late eighteenth century France. They are painted with delicate scrolls that incorporate vegetal motifs, cornuco pias, and birds' heads. This type of decoration, known as the arabesque style, was very much in fashion in the 1780s not only throughout the decorative arts but also in interior decoration. On these vases the scrolling motifs surround panels painted to resemble prints depicting a male river god and a woman in classical dress. The richness of the decoration is enhanced by the two colors of marble employed for the base and by the finely worked coiling snakes that form the handles.

Among those who remained to treat the stricken was Dr. Philip Syng Physick, "the father of American surgery." For his excep tional dedication, the directors of the City Hospital presented him with two magnificent pieces of silver, each fashioned in the Neoclas sical style with bright-cut paterae and floral festoons. The twelve-sided urn is further orna mented with lion's-head handles and an Ameri can eagle finial. The tray, exceptionally large for its date, is inscribed underneath: "John McMul lin / Fecit / Philad' 1799." Each piece is also inscribed: "From the Board of Managers of the Marine &amp; City Hospitals to Philip Syng Phys ick, M.D., this Mark of their respectful appro bation of his voluntary and inestimable services as Resident Physician at the City Hospital in the Calamity of 1798." Dr. Physick valued these objects so highly that he named them specifi cally in his will, bequeathing the tray to his eldest son, Philip, and the urn to his youngest son, Emlen.

It also adds considerable depth to the Museum's holdings of French and Belgian painters, notably Achille-Etna Michallon, Camille Corot, Simon Denis, and Pierre-Henri de Valenci ennes, whose treatise Elémens de perspective pratique of 1800 included the era's most widely read text about landscape painting. All of these artists were trained in an academic tradition in which oil sketching out of doors was held to be an exercise prefatory to more deliberate and considered com positions, almost invariably with figures, that were executed in the studio. The practice would eventu ally become a vehicle for the successive innovations of Romantics, Realists, and Impressionists. Highlights of the Thaw Collection include a diaphanous early study by François-Marius Granet, Dusk, Monte Mario, Rome, in which the light and atmosphere of a sunset were captured in as little as half an hour.

Hôtel Drouot, Paris, June 26,2009, lot 57; [Kunsthandel Katrin Bellinger, Munich], Purchase, Rogers Fund and Promised Gift of Leon D. and Debra ft Black, 2009 (2009.423) This newly discovered drawing by Ingres depicts the dramatic story ofVirgil reading the Aeneid to Augustus, his wife Livia, and his sister Octa via. As the poet recites the words "tu Marcellus eris," he is abruptly halted by Augustus, for Octavia has just fainted into the emperor's lap upon hearing the name of her dead son. Livia, who is believed to have commanded the murder of Marcellus, appears impassive, while Augustus's advisors Marcus Agrippa and Gaius Maecenas whisper in the background. A nude statue of Marcellus presides over the nocturnal scene; illuminated by a flickering candle, it projects a ghostly shadow onto the wall at the upper right. Marcellus was Augustus's nephew and adoptive son. When he died, Livia s son Tiberius became heir to the throne. The drawing is a wonderful example of Ingres's Romantic-classicist interpretation of antique subjects, fusing archaeological exacti tude and carefully calibrated emotional drama. The artist used white highlights throughout the composition to illuminate and animate the figures and to direct the viewer's gaze within the scene. The blue paper further enhances the nocturnal lighting effects and lugubrious mood A related painting by Ingres (Musée des Augus tine, Toulouse) was commissioned in 1811 by General Miollis, Napoléon I's French governor in Rome. cm August Heinrich German, 1794-1822 The Watzmann Seen from the Northeast and Some Sketches of a Mountain 1820-22 Watercolor over charcoal sketch on recto, graphite on verso; 6 Vs χ 97/« in.

Purchase, LilaAcheson Wallace, Charles and Jessie Price, and PECO Foundation Gifts, 2009 (2009.124) In the early nineteenth century theWatzmann, one of Germany's highest mountains, became a beloved subject for a new generation of artists to whom the mountain appealed as a magnificent creation of God as well as a natural phenomenon of scientific interest. In this exquisite drawing, by ignoring the space between it and the viewer, August Heinrich isolated the mountain as if it were a divine vision. At the same time, he surpassed himself in trying to capture every detail of the Watzmann's profile and structure. The sketches beneath the watercolor and the view on the verso of the village of Sankt Bar tholomä on the other side of the mountain attest that this drawing was at least started on the site. Another drawing by the artist of the same mountain seen from the same side is in the Nasjonalgalleriet, Oslo. Both works can be dated to Heinrichs long stay in Salzburg and southern Germany in 1820—22.They can be connected with a famous painting of the Watzmann (Alte Nationalgalerie, Berlin) by Heinrichs older (and longer-lived) contempo rary and friend Caspar David Friedrich. Fried rich, who never traveled outside northern Europe, is assumed to have referred to one of Heinrichs views while making his painting.

Dark clouds move off to the right. A shepherd leans on a rock at the left and plays his flutelike instrument. His two companions point to the rainbow and celebrate nature's restored tranquility after the danger of the storm has passed. Joseph-Anton Koch dis tilled this rich Mediterranean landscape into a magically organized universe. From the bucolic foreground the eye is led by clear compositional lines over copses and lush valleys to sunny plateaus and rugged mountains. Classical and medieval towns on the slopes descend to the sea on the left. However idealized the landscape might appear, it is based on the artists vivid mem ories of traveling on the Gulf of Salerno on his way to Paestum in 1795. Koch painted four versions of the composition between 1805 and 1824, culminating with this one. The series renewed the "heroic" seventeenth century landscape tradition of Nicolas Pous sin and Claude Lorrain and established Koch as the most influential landscape painter in Rome. He was admired as well as a teacher of the next generation of German Roman tic painters, among them Karl Friedrich Schinkel and the Nazarenes. SR 1809-24 51</page><page sequence="50">George T.

Gift of A. Grima Johnson, 2008 (2008.573) The masts of ships docked on the Hudson River can be seen through the window of John Q. Aymar's home on Greenwich Street in New York, marking his success as an importer of rum and coffee from the West Indies. More to the point, his mercantile prowess is displayed in his richly furnished parlor, replete with fine carpets, draperies, and furniture in the latest fashion: a marble-top center table adorned with fruit and a paisley shawl, a pier table with a gilded mirror, and a sideboard. Aymar's wife, Elizabeth, and two daughters, Mary and Elizabeth, com plete the scene of domestic harmony. Long attributed by the Aymar family to Samuel F. B. Morse, the painting has been reassigned to George Twibill, who was a student of Morse s at the National Academy of Design. Twibill's rare works are unfailingly meticulous and charming, and here the expression of warmth is redoubled by the accuracy of the interior. The Aymar family presented this painting to the Museum along with most of the furniture that is shown in it. It is thus not only a lovely portrait but also an extraordinary document of life in New York in the 1830s. crb William Henry Fox Talbot English, 1800-1877 Nelson's Column under Construction, Trafalgar Square April 1844 Salted paper print from paper negative, 6% χ 83/e in.

Made just five years into the history of photog raphy by the medium's inventor, Nelson's Column is among William Henry Fox Talbot's most complex and beautiful images, and this example is a particularly fine print. By April 1844 photography was still new and hand crafted but no longer experimental. Talbot could turn his attention from the mechanics of making a picture to the aesthetics, and, having executed numerous carefully arranged photo graphs at his home, Lacock Abbey, he felt con fident enough to go out into the world to find his subjects. Many of his images taken "on the road" were predictably picturesque or topo graphic, but at Trafalgar Square Talbot found a compelling perspective, a daring composition, and a fascinating intersection of the religious and secular, the historic and present-day. Instead of choosing a more distant vantage point or a vertical format to show the entire column, with its bronze capital and seventeen foot-tall statue, he framed a view in which the bill-posted construction fence and the column's massive base dominate the foreground, while the steeple of St Martin-in-the-Fields rises in the background to the very edge of the picture. Nelson's Column marks the beginning of a new, photographic way of seeing. md 52 I RECENT ACQUISITIONS</page><page sequence="51">mi = &lt; dead, or used to dress the tau-tau, a wooden effigy representing the deceased.

Purchase, William Cuiten Bryant Fellows Gifts, 2008(2008.595) In the mid-nineteenth century, at the time this outstanding quilt was made in Carmel, New York, a town about fifty miles north of New York City, the florid and intricate Rococo Revival style was in fiali bloom. The grapevines and appliquéd flowers entwined into wreaths stitched onto the surface are reminiscent of the decoration found carved into the rich rosewood backs of high-style New York furniture of the same era. While many bed quilts are quite modest objects meant for everyday use, this one would have been considered stylish and sophisticated when it was created. Its exceptionally good condition reinforces the notion that it was meant to be a "best" quilt, taken out only on special occasions to beautify its maker's home. Emeline Travis Ludington had an ambitious artistic vision for her quilt, lay ing out and stitching a stunning overall design and adding an unusual scalloped finishing detail to the edges. Ludington was married to a banker, George, and was the mother of six children.

The Sa'dan and the Mamasa Toraja, in the eastern part of the district, use sarita in rituals connected both with the east (associated with life, vitality, and fertility) and the west (associ ated with death and funerary rites). In one fertility rite a circle of eight women are united physically and supernaturally by a sarita draped around their shoulders.

Menschel Gift, Louis V. Bell Fund, Alfred Stieglitz Society and W. Bruce and DelaneyH. Lundberg Gifts, 2010(2010.231 A French diplomat and gentleman amateur photographer, Baron Jean-Baptiste-Louis Gros first learned of photography while stationed in Bogotá, Colombia, in the early 1840s. In the years that followed, he made daguerreotypes in South America, Greece, Egypt, London, and Paris that were greatly admired by his fellow photographers and continue to entrance view ers today with their starding detail and irides cent surface. This work, one of fewer than twenty plates now known by Gros, is thought to show the salon of his Paris home. Gros's exceptional mastery of the technical aspects of the young medium was paired with a refined visual sensibility, seen here in the richness of the setting, with its multiple pat terns and textures in fabric and decorative objets d'art, and most of all in the subtle and seductive play of light. Every detail is perfectly calibrated—the ewer carefully silhouetted in the window, the stylish high-back chair posi tioned invitingly in the glancing sunlight, the daguerreotypes on the easel clearly visible despite their mirrorlike surfaces, and the closed curtains that provide a theatrical backdrop.

In the nineteenth century, particularly during the War of 1812, Mex ican War, and Civil War, the U.S. Congress commissioned a large number of highly ornate presentation swords with hilts of gold or silver from leading designers and silversmiths. This sword presented to Major General John E.Wool is one of the finest and most original. The sword, in pristine condition, was awarded to Wool by Congress in 1854 in belated recognition of his pivotal role in the American victory at Buena Vista during the Mexican War. The massive gold hilt incorporates the American eagle as the pommel, an ear of corn for the grip, and a cactus branch entwined with snakes (for Mexico) as the crossguard.The blade is etched with the American arms, and the gilded brass scabbard has gold laurel branches as suspension mounts.The original silver-mounted storage box also survives. The sword's elegant propor tions, novel design, sculptural conception, and superb finish make it an outstanding example of mid-nineteenth-century silver smithing. The inscription on the blade names a Baltimore cutler; the unmarked hilt may have been made in the same city.

Herring Gift, 2009 (2009 64) Drawn curtains and outside shutters keep out the bright light of a summer day. Some rays of sunlight enter, however, through the gap below the shutters, bathing the room in a luminous twilight. The artist worked quickly, intent on capturing the fleeting effect of the sunlight. With light brushstrokes, he broadly indicated furniture and objects. This sitting room was part of Adolph Men zels spacious apartment on the third floor of a building at Ritterstrasse 43, in what is today the Kreuzberg district of Berlin, where he lived with his two younger siblings, Emilie and Richard, from 1847 until i860. During his life time Menzel was famous as a painter of mod ern history and everyday life. He made a career of chronicling the court of Emperor Wilhelm I of Prussia.Today he is admired for the group of small paintings in which he recorded impressions of his immediate sur roundings between 1845 and 1851. He regarded these works as mere experiments and never exhibited them. Lingering in his studio, they came to light only after his death in 1905. This is the last in a series of pictures of empty rooms in which the momentary effects of light serve as the sole motif, a novel subject for the time.

Commissioned by the Viennese firm of Stammer &amp; Breul to be shown at the 1855 Exposition Universelle in Paris, the nearly nine-foot-tall prie-dieu was clearly inspired by religious architecture of the Middle Ages. It was an ambitious piece for these tabletiers, or dealers who specialized in the sale of small pieces of furniture and luxury goods. A critic reviewing the Paris exposition in The Ecclesiolo gist of October 1855 praised the paper-thin micromosaic surface decoration as "so elaborate that it is said to consist of 2,500,000 pieces, [which] throws into the shade our boasted elab orate exiguities ofTunbridge ware." Once even more colorful, the amazingly fine mosaic tech nique, usually reserved for the embellishment of small-scale objects such as those produced in the British spa town Tunbridge Wells, further enhances the prie-dieu's Gothic character with its almost textilelike patterns incorporating trefoil arches, lancets, quatrefoils, and roundels.

Guided by the example of Pierre Puvis de Chavannes and his close friend Gustave Moreau, the young Degas sought to invent scenes that conveyed a sense of distant times and places. Moreau may have suggested this subject to Degas; an early notebook bears the title "Young Egyptian Girl Feeding Ibises." Prob ably begun in Rome over the winter and spring of 1857-58, the canvas was brought back to Paris, where Degas is thought to have added the Oriental cityscape. He based the pose of the figure on Hippolyte Flandrin's painting Dreaming, which itself derived from the figure of Stratonice in Ingres's famous Antiochus and Stratonice (Musée Condé, Chantilly). In contrast to the meticulous fin ish of the figure, drapery, and cityscape, the flamboyant ibises are only sketched in. Degas failed to finish many of his early canvases, most of which, like this one, he kept until his death.

Gift of Mrs. Charles Wrightsman, 200812008.547.1) This arresting picture was made after Jean Léon Gérôme returned to Paris from a twelve week expedition across the Near East in early 1868. Enjoying fame, prestigious clients, mem bership in the Institut de France, and a lucra tive relationship with the art publisher Goupil (his father-in-law), Gérôme was at the height of his career when he dressed a model in his studio with the exotic textiles he had acquired in the Levant. Calling the picture Bashi-Bazouk ("headless" in Turkish), he evoked the ferocious, lawless, and unpaid soldiers who fought for plunder—although it is difficult to imagine this beautiful man charging into battle wearing such an exquisite silk tunic. Famous for rendering textures with the subtlety of the best seventeenth century Dutch genre painters, Gérôme spared no effort in this tour de force, endowing the model with a dignity not typical of his orient alist fantasies. In 1884 Henry Cox, who owned it at the time, lent the painting to the landmark exhibi tion of modern French painting held to raise funds for the pedestal of the Statue of Liberty. A reviewer noted that "there is a great deal of character and dramatic power in the picture, and although not large it is an admirable example of the famous artist." gt Zouave Uniform Schuylkill Arsenal, Pennsylvania, 1863-66 Wool, leather, metal Provenance: Sale, Heritage Auction Galleries, Dallas, November 24, 2008, lot 57506. Purchase, Alfred Z. Solomon-Janet A.

Menschel, 2008 (2008.669) P. H. Emerson's work grew from an examina tion, at once both highly personal and anthro pological, of the environment and daily rituals of rural life in East Anglia, the marshy coastal region northeast of London. In the course of his ten-year photographic career he passed on his expertise in more than a half-dozen books illustrated with platinum prints or photogra vures, but his first publication. Life and Land scape on the Norfolk Broads, remained his most lavish production and the one in which text and image are most coherently integrated. With its forty platinum prints from glass negatives, it is a landmark in the history of photographically illustrated books. For his aesthetic models Emerson looked to the work of French painters Jean-François Mil let and Jules Bastien-Lepage and the painters of the New English Art Club, including his collaborator on Life and Landscape, Thomas Goodall. By breaking the existing molds of ambitious photography—sharp, straightforward documentation on the one hand and contrived tableaux on the other—and opting for a more impressionist or, in his words, "naturalistic" style that more closely simulated human vision, Emerson blazed the trail that would be fol lowed by the American Pictorialists, the Photo Secession, and modern photography. MD Pectoral Ornament Central Asia or Iran, Tekke tribe, late 19th— early 20th century Silver, gilded, engraved, and inset with carnelians; 4% χ 4 in. (12.1 χ 10.2 cm) Provenance: Marshall and Marilyn R. Wolf, New York, until 2008. Gift of Marshall and Marilyn R. Wolf, 2008 12008.579.3) Turkman jewelry is worn because of its protec tive powers, and its design is not merely guided by aesthetic preference but has specific references in a set of beliefs that predate the conversion of the Turkman tribes to Islam. This ornament is attributed to the Tekke tribe that once inhab ited the Achal oasis in the southern part of present-day Turkmenistan, close to the northern border of Iran. While much of the jewelry made by the Turkman tribes combines silver, gilded silver, and carnelians, Tekke pieces are instantly recognizable from the gilded scrolling patterns covering much of their surface and the open work scrolls used on many, but not all, pieces. The pair of confronted birds that form the main motif of this object is unusual, however. Although birds are commonly used in the jew elry of other Islamic cultures, a parallel for this piece in Tekke jewelry is nearly impossible to find. The form is also unusual. While the piece is similar to a headdress element, its overall size and the proportion of its height to its width suggest that this was a pectoral ornament, prob ably worn strung together with several other ornaments that covered most of the chest.

Those who could afford it commissioned the House ofWorth to manifest their fantasies. This rare costume is in fact an authentic Turkish woman's ensemble, heavily embroidered in gold by Turkish artisans, that was refashioned at the House ofWorth into the form-fitting silhouette of the 1870s. The voluminous drawstring pants retain their origi nal form, but the formerly loose bodice was completely remade, presumably at the behest of the client, and the embroidery artfully inte grated into the new cut of the garment. It was not uncommon for couture clients of the era to commission custom designs using fabrics or decorative trims they had purchased themselves, often during their travels. Fancy dress balls originated in London and Paris in the early eighteenth century as mas querades held in public spaces and developed into more structured indoor events in the nine teenth century. Costumes evoking what was perceived as the "exoticism of the East," espe cially Turkey, were a perennial theme of choice, culminating in Paul Poiret's famed 1002nd Night Ball of 1911. jr Thomas Moran American, bom England, 1837-1926 Colburn's Butte, South Utah 1873 Graphite, watercolor, and gouache on blue wove paper; 14 χ 9 in.

It is the first polychrome watercolor by this master of frontier American landscape painting to enter the Museum's collection. In late July 1873 Moran was en route from Salt Lake City to the north rim of the Grand Canyon to join the expedition of John Wesley Powell. Near Kanarraville, Utah, he recorded in his sketch book two Navajo sandstone pinnacles that offered a preview of the magnificent Zion Canyon to the south, which he visited days later. With Moran was Justin Colburn, a cor respondent for the New York Times, to whom he eventually gave the watercolor he made from the sketch and whose name he gave to its principal feature. Colburn s Butte, today called Tucupit Point, is in the Kolob Canyon section of Zion National Park. In Moran's watercolor it is distinguished by the white cloud swirling down to silhouette its peak. The spontaneous-looking passage sets off a zigzag pattern, of hill and grass that con tinues to the bottom of the sheet. Such celestial terrestrial dynamics were a hallmark of the work of the English-born Moran, an admirer of the turbulent landscapes of J. M.W.Turner. From the watercolor Moran designed an engraving that was published in the art maga zine The Aldine in 1874. kja George A.

Rockefeller when she married in 1884) harks back to the tradition of the great eighteenth-century French boudoirs of Madame de Pompadour and Marie Antoinette. This jewel box of a room features elaborate wood work in the finest materials: satinwood with rosewood marquetry and carved details, further embellished with mother-of-pearl. In the fash ion of the Aesthetic movement then in vogue, the walls and ceiling are covered with wallpaper patterned with stenciled motifs and canvas painted with a frieze of cupids holding garlands of shells and jeweled necklaces.The original gilded bronze lighting fixtures are similarly ornate, with leafy scrolled arms and panels inlaid with mother-of-pearl in the American Renaissance style. The design and craftsmanship of the woodwork and furnishings, by the little known firm of George A.

Its acquisi tion by the Metropolitan has transformed the Museum's holdings in this area. Formed by Robert A. Ellison Jr. over a period of nearly half a century, the collection is acknowledged to be one of the finest of its kind in private hands. The ceramics date from the Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia in 1876, an impor tant catalyst for the emergence of the art pot tery movement in the late 1870s and early 1880S, to the beginning of the studio pottery movement in the mid-1950s.They represent iconic work by major art potteries such as Newcomb Pottery in New Orleans and Grueby Pottery and Paul Revere Pottery of the Satur day Evening Girls Club in Boston. Of great depth are Ellison's holdings of the early under glaze slip-decorated (barbotine) vases, tiles, and plaques of Charles Volkmar and the extraordi nary glazed vessels of the Chelsea Keramic Art Works and its successor firm, the Dedham Pot tery. Ellison was one of the first collectors to recognize the artistic achievement in the thin-walled, hand-thrown and manipulated abstracted glazed vessels of the eccentric ind inventive potter George E. Ohr of Biloxi, Mississippi, and his comprehensive collection demonstrates the range and virtuosity of Ohr's work. Ellison also acquired examples of Art Deco pottery from the 1920s and 1930s by W. Hunt Diederich and Henry Varnum Poor and of early studio pottery from the mid 1950s by such California artists as Otto and Gertrude Natzler and Peter Voulkos.

Zeshin studied lacquer under Koma Kan'ya (Kansai II) from the age of eleven and trained in the painting style of the Shijö school under Okamoto Toyohiko. His works capture the dynamism of the popular culture of the capital of Edo (now Tokyo) during the transition from military to imperial rule. In the final year of his life, Zeshin had the honor of being appointed an artist of the impe rial household. This box, designed for the stor age of sumptuous edibles presented at festive occasions, has a continuous design across its five tiers of summer and autumn fruits, including grapes, melons, loquats, and pears. In its execu tion Zeshin demonstrated his virtuosity with the lacquer medium. The lacquer ground is a rich, very dark brown decorated with colored layers in a variety of maki-e techniques. Two interchangeable lids feature independent designs on their surfaces. The interiors of both lids are signed Zeshin in raised black lacquer characters and sealed Tatryuko (the name of Zeshin's workshop in Edo) in red lacquer.

A notable exception is Mutuaga, a master carver who lived and worked in the Massim region of eastern New Guinea in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. His distinctive ren dering of the human figure and the precise and elegant surface decoration of his sculptures make Mutuaga's unique style immediately rec ognizable. He created objects for local use, but he also, beginning in the 1890s, developed a relationship with Charles Abel of the London Missionary Society. Abel became Mutuaga's patron and promoted the acquisition of his work among the growing numbers of European mis sionaries, traders, and visitors in the area. Many of Mutuaga's most accomplished works were lime spatulas like this one. A lime spatula is used to scoop a small portion of lime, made from burnt shell or coral, from a container and apply it to betel nut, the fruit of the areca palm that is chewed as a mild stimulant. This spatula is too large, however, to have served any practi cal function. Such oversize lime spatulas were reportedly used locally as ceremonial objects, but it is also possible that the piece was intended for a European client.

Goldstein and Marie Sussek Gifts, 201012010.127) This woven panel emblazoned with an elegant serrated design exemplifies the apogee of technical refinement that was achieved in one of eastern Africa's major decorative arts traditions. Across both Rwanda and Burundi finely woven basketry in the form of recep tacles and architectural elements were historically the creations of privileged Tutsi women. Given the inherent fra gility of the medium and the vulner ability of works from this tradition to destruction due to regional conflict in the last decade, this early example is a rare survival. Such woven screens (insika) enhanced the domestic interiors of wealthy Tutsi as a form of mural decoration that compartmentalized the space. Judging by its scale and convex structure, this particular example appears to have enclosed the area at the base of a bed. The front face is composed of natural and black-dyed reeds, with individual passages cut and arranged to create a dynamic wave design. Three sets of complex structures have been skillfully integrated to create the distinctive curvature of the panel. al Firm of Carl Fabergé Russian, active 1882-1917 Three Picture Frames Left: Master August Hollming, Saint Petersburg, 1908-17; partially gilded silver and blue enamel, 2% χ 33ί in.

(127.6 χ 54.3 cm) Gift of American Decorative Art 1900 Foundation, in honor of Alice Cooney Frelinghuysen, 2008 (2008.535) The preeminent Prairie School architect George Washington Maher designed this win dow to grace the main hall of the James A. Patten house in Evanston, Illinois. The Patten house embodied Maher's belief in the complete integration of the various elements of a build ing. The window's design owes its origin to Louis Sullivan, in whose architectural studio Maher worked prior to establishing an inde pendent practice. Sullivan's principles of organic architecture promoted a decorative style based on the simplification and stylization of living plants. Maher added his own ideal, called the "motif rhythm theory," whereby a single motif was repeated, in a variety of materials and in varying proportions and details, throughout an interior to yield a unified design. The thistle, perhaps a reference to the owner's Scottish origins, was the unifying motif in the Patten house. Maher employed stylized variations of the motif throughout the house in elements such as portieres, mosaic panels, wall stencils, and carved woodwork. In keeping with the principles of the Arts and Crafts movement, on this window an abundance of transparent glass surrounds the thistle made of textured and green glass, mitigating the separation between the interior and the outside environment.

(2.27 m) Provenance: [Tony Bingham, London], Purchase, Amati Gifts, 2009 (2009.430a,b, 4311 A longitudinal slit on one side of a hollowed log or metal cylinder provides a striking surface to sound instruments that are used almost worldwide for ritual and secular music or for signaling. These loud instruments, frequently used in groups of two or more with different pitches, provide music, mark the time, or send messages. Small versions may be handheld, or even worn, but larger ones are either placed horizontally or, like these imposing Madurese gulgul, stand upright. Both of these larger types may be suspended from beams. On each of the Museum's gulgul two scaly nagas, the serpentlike creatures of Hindu myth ology, are carved into the tear-shaped log, one on either side of the vertical slit, and a naga-head finial completes the design. Further Hindu influenced elements include stylized lotuses and floral motifs at the ends of the slits. An unidentified doglike animal is clasped in each of the naga's constricting coils, perhaps reflect ing a local legend or emphasizing the instru ment's protective role as an alarm. jkm Georges Demeny French, 1850-1917 Fencer 1906 Gelatin silver print, 6% χ 10% in.

Using an innovative camera that made multiple exposures on a single photographic plate in rapid succession, Marey and Demeny cap tured the visible traces of an entire action at regular intervals, allowing an analysis of movement impossible for the naked eye to discern in real time. Demeny, a pioneer of cinema and a founder of physical edu cation in France, was particularly interested in the practical applications of Marey s investigations of movement and contin ued to make "chronophotographs" long after parting ways with his teacher in 1894. At the National School of Gymnastics and Fencing at Joinville, where Demeny was professor of physiology, photographs such as this one of a lunging fencer were used to teach the sport s repertoire of precise, economical moves in their ideal form. At the same time, one can easily see in Demeny s useful document from 1906 the sort of dynamism that would soon appear in the art of the Italian Futurists and in Marcel Duchamp's famous Nude Descending a Staircase. md Paul Poiret French, 1879-1944 Evening Dress 1910 Green and ivory striped silk, black silk chiffon, white linen Brooklyn Museum Costume Collection at The Metropolitan Museum of Art, Gift of the Brooklyn Museum, 2009; Gift of Ogden Goelet, Peter Goelet and Madison Clews in memory of Mrs. Henry Clews, 1961 (2009.300.1289) A rare example of Paul Poiret's early revolutionary designs loosely based on the upright, columnar, high-waisted styles worn in ancient Greece, this gown is an innovative melding of the avant-garde and the traditional. The tubular shape and graphic horizontal stripes are harbingers of the modern era, while the below-the-knee gathering of the overskirt suggests the "hobble skirt" that Poiret introduced in 1910 and was briefly the height of fashion. Decorative touches taken from traditional sources mollify the radical form. One of Poiret's signature decorative techniques was to use folkloric textiles and trims that he collected on his travels. Here the collar and cuffs are fashioned from a traditional French pleated linen bonnet, and brightly colored brocade rib bons that would have adorned a festive folk bon net or costume encircle the raised waistline. Requiring less restrictive undergarments and conforming more to the natural shape of the body, Poiret's designs of 1908-11 are regarded as pivotal in the transition from the rigidly corseted silhou ettes of the Victorian and Edwardian eras to styles providing greater freedom and comfort in dress that would characterize twentieth-century fashion. This dress is reunited with other Poiret designs in The Costume Institute's collection that were owned by Mrs. Henry Clews.

Jesup and2004 Benefit Funds, 2010(2010.731 End of the Trail is emblematic of the western American subjects created by turn-of-the century French-trained artists such as James Earle Fraser who were expressing themselves as American through their choice of subject mat ter and as modern through their sophisticated command of current aesthetic and composi tional principles. The weary Indian, slumped dejectedly upon his windblown pony, is a stir ring interpretation of the damaging effects of advancing white settlement on the Native American population. Based on Fräsers first hand experiences growing up on a ranch in Dakota Territory in the 1880s, his sculpture, rich in narrative detail, was intended as a sym bolic comment on the confinement of Native Americans on government reservations. The sculptor earned popular acclaim in 1915 when he displayed a monumental plaster version at the Panama-Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco. He then produced statuettes in two heights, of which this is a larger example. This cast, with its superlative attention to tex tural detail and thinly applied original patina, was produced at Roman Bronze Works, the preeminent American foundry of its day. End of the Trail will be a centerpiece of a new western American art installation in the American Wing's paintings and sculpture galleries when they reopen in early 2012. TT Henri Matisse French, 1869-1954 The Three O'Clock Sitting 1924 Oil on canvas, 36Μ χ 28M in. (92.1 χ 73 cm) Provenance: Stephen C. Clark, New York, by 1931; sold to Cordelia H. Cushman, Syosset, Long Island, 1948; her gift to her son, Roderick H. Cushman, 1958. Gift of the Roderick H. Cushman Family in memory of Paul and Cordelia Cushman, 2008 (2008.551) Beginning in December 1917 Henri Matisse spent increasing amounts of time on the French Riviera. The Three O'Clock Sitting is set in one of the two studios in Matisse's third-floor apart ment on the place Charles-Félix in Nice, just two blocks from the Baie des Anges. The paint ing features elements that reappear in many of his canvases from this period: boldly patterned wallpaper, elaborately pierced and appliquéd textiles of North African origin, representations of the artist's own work (a plaster of a reclining nude is visible atop the mirrored armoire), and an alluring view of palm trees and the Medi terranean Sea outside the studio window. The woman shown at the easel was Matisse's favorite model at the time, Henriette Darricarrère, and the androgynous figure posing in the fore ground is thought to be her younger brother, who worked as a bellhop at a local hotel. An accomplished musician and ballerina, Darricar rère suffered from stage fright so severe that in 1924 she decided to forsake live performance and pursue a career in the visual arts. Matisse painted this canvas later that year, after he had begun instructing her. rar 68 I RECENT ACQUISITIONS</page><page sequence="67">1918-24 ! 69</page><page sequence="68">Elsa Schiaparellí Italian, 1890-1973 "Cocteau" Evening Jacket Fall 1937 Linen, metallic foil, beads, paillettes Provenance: Sale, Millón Cornette de Saint Cyr, Drouot-Richelieu, Paris, July 3,2009, lot 200. Purchase, Friends of The Costume Institute Gifts, 2009 (2009.421) Elsa Schiaparelli was a well-born Italian designer who made her mark in Paris from the late 1920s to the 1950s. Her initial success was based on a trompe l'oeil sweater with the illusion of a knotted cravat, but she quickly moved from designing knitwear to the establishment of a cou ture house, where she continued to play with whimsical Dada- and Surrealist-inflected conceits. Schiaparelli's collaborations with artists resulted in some of the most renowned works of twentieth-century haute couture. A jacket with dresser drawers for pockets, her notorious "Shoe Hat," and a provocative "Bug Necklace" came from her partner ship with Salvador Dali. An evening coat embroidered in a pattern that reads simultaneously as a vase and two confronting faces and this jacket, with its trompe l'oeil profile, were products of her collaboration with Jean Cocteau. Although she is best remembered for these playful works, they appear to have been ordered by only a limited number of clients, and most of the surviving examples are from Schiaparelli's own collec tion. This jacket, which has a place in any comprehensive view of the Schiaparelli oeuvre, is therefore a particularly serendipitous discovery, having been only recently sold by the family of a client who was clearly enamored of the designer's more assertive and signature work. hk Hedda Sterne American, born Romania, 1910 Self-Portrait Ca. 1938-40 Pen and ink and pencil on paper, 11 χ 10)4 in. (27.9 χ 26 cm) Provenance: [CDS Gallery, New York, by 2008], Van Day Truex Fund, 2009 (2009.36) Hedda Sterne arrived in New York in 1941 from her native Bucharest and soon met other émigré artists, including her future husband and fellow Romanian, the cartoonist Saul Steinberg. Sterne made portrait drawings throughout her life but regarded her stylistically diverse body of largely abstract paintings as her paramount achievement. Although she was well acquainted with members of the New York School and like them, exhibited at the Betty Parsons Gallery, she never adhered to one signature style or expressed allegiance to any particular group. For portrait subjects Sterne turned to her distinguished coterie of art world friends and, occasionally, to her own lovely visage. In this unusually detailed and haunting self-portrait, Sterne's face looms above the horizon of a stark landscape, partially obscured beneath a lacy over lay of swirling lines that commingle with the waves of her dark hair. At the time Sterne made this drawing she was in close contact with Sur realist artists in Paris. She brought it with her when she fled Bucharest and made her way to New York in 1941, after narrowly escaping the Nazis' seizure of Jewish residents in her apartment building.

The form alludes to the extreme bustle of the i88os, which swayed seductively with the wearers movements. At the same time, as the name implies, the form has morphed the female body into a butterfly with iridescent wings that shimmer as they move. The curva ceous satin side flanges serve both to heighten the eroticism of feminine curves and to under score the wing motif. References to the past aside, this was a form hitherto unknown in the history of fashion, giving it modernist status. The dress weighs eighteen pounds. Twenty-five yards of tulle were used in its making. Charles James's oeuvre is diverse and com plex. He was a restless, creative force, constantly pushing the boundaries of convention and of his own previous accomplishments. Because it took many forms with coundess variations, his work is difficult to characterize or classify. Some pieces are elegant and timeless, while others are odd and controversial, with biomor phic features. Many are based onVictorian styles, yet are the essence of modernity. This gown epitomizes the strong influence of the Surrealist designer Elsa Schiaparelli that runs throughout James s work.

(91.4 cm) Provenance: Collected from the Asmat people in New Guinea by Tobias Schneebaum, New York, ca. 1973-2005. From the Tobias Schneebaum collection, Gift of Cary Schneebaum, Jeff Schneebaum and Randy Slakter, 200912009.502.1) Religious life among the Asmat people of southwestern New Guinea centers on an elab orate series of rituals accompanied by ceremo nial feasts. Feast foods are often collected and served in ordinary wood food bowls or simpler vessels made from the bases of sago palm fronds. Some Asmat groups, however, create ornate ceremonial containers like this one to hold sago grubs (the larvae of the capricorn beetle), an indispensable element of all feasts. To ensure an adequate supply of this prized food, at least six weeks in advance of a feast the Asmat cut down a large quantity of sago palm trees, the trunks of which contain a starchy pith. Holes are drilled into the fallen trunks to allow adult beetles to lay their eggs in the pith, and the people return six weeks later to harvest the fully grown grubs. This container has carved brackets and fiber straps on the reverse that allow it to be carried like a backpack. It was likely used both to collect grubs at the harvest site and to transport them to and present them at the feast. The human figure almost certainly represents a recently deceased ancestor, and the spear he carries suggests he was a warrior, ek Charles James American, bom England, 1906-1978 "Butterfly" Ball Gown 1955 Gray silk chiffon and satin; aubergine, lavender, and white silk tulle Brooklyn Museum Costume Collection at The Metropolitan Museum of Art, Gift of the Brooklyn Museum, 2009; Gift of Mrs. John de Menil, 1957(2009.300.8181 Ceremonial Container Indonesia (Papua Province), Asmat people, mid-20th century Wood, paint, fiber, cassowary quills, seeds, feathers; h. 36 in.

Her diverse body of work is not especially well known in this country, but her paintings have been widely exhibited in Europe for more than five decades. This abstract oil belongs to the Outburst, or Éclatement, series she undertook from 1954 to 1956. Using brushes, bent curtain rods, or her hands, Reigl applied or threw generous amounts of paint onto the canvas, spreading and scraping the medium in a spon taneous, vigorous manner while leaving large areas of the ground exposed. Here she coaxed paint toward and away from the center to create a powerfully centrifugal composition. In 1954 Reigl had been invited by André Breton to exhibit her quasi-figurative paintings at a Parisian gallery that featured Surrealist art. After the show she disassociated herself from Breton's circle but maintained an interest in automatic methods, which informed the unpremeditated manner she employed in the Outburst paintings. Reigl has said that the title of the series coincides with her rupture with the Surrealists and with the beginnings of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956.

Purchase, Gould Family Foundation Gift, in memory of Jo Copeland, 2008/2008.3051 Paco Rabanne presented his first collection, Twelve Experimental Dresses, in 1964 and followed it in 1966 with a couture collection he called Twelve Unwearable Dresses.This sculptural micromini dress, constructed of square and rectangular aluminum plates joined with metal rings, is a rare surviving example from his "unwearable" collection. With its allusion to chain mail, the dress establishes Rabanne's practice of citing historical elements in his space-age aesthetic. The innovative construction and unconventional use of material epitomize the exploratory and experimental sensibility of much 1960s avant-garde fashion. Rabanne was born Francisco Rabaneda Cuervo in the Basque region of Spain. His mother was the head seamstress for the famed Spanish-born couturier Cristobal Balenciaga. Rabanne initially studied architecture at the École Nationale des Beaux-Arts in Paris. He began his fashion career only in the early 1960s, with a collection of large plastic accessories he sold to the couture houses. From these humble beginnings and with his unconventional approach, he fashioned garments that reflected the Zeitgeist of the mid-1960s. But unlike Pierre Cardin and André Courrèges, who employed traditional couture techniques for their "futuristic" designs, Rabanne was interested in creating fashion with uncharted and imaginative production methods using novel postwar industrial materials. sbp Mary Rogers British, born 1929 Bowl Ca.1971 Porcelain, h. 17a in.

In 1968 she began to work with porcelain, rather than the stoneware of her earlier projects, because of its translucent qual ity. Rogers forms her paper-thin, nonutilitarian vessels directly by pinching and modeling the porcelain, which she finishes by scraping the piece once it has dried. For added surface decoration she frequently carves the edges and occasionally pierces the body of a vessel. Like this one from the early 1970s, many of her bowls are stained or painted in a pointil list style.

Both pupil and professor were rapt admirers of the French director Jean-Luc Godard, considering his films to be object lessons for a radical Conceptual art that did not monastically refrain from visual elaboration. For Untitled, Salle cast four women he knew, costuming and posing them in their actual morning wear at their respective kitchen windows—the kind of subliminally recog nizable moment that the ad execs who designed the neatly pasted coffee labels would have tapped into to sell these women their chosen brands. For Salle, these labels represent things that are in the picture but not neces sarily visible, and for which we have to take the artist's word. The way the labels "speak for" the women in the photographs only highlights the inac cessibility and implied poignancy of their thoughts. Salle's flair for piquant juxtaposition, his still controversial (for advanced visual art if not its equiva lents in cinema or literature) foregrounding of women as the engines of his art, and his pinpoint accuracy in rendering the ineffable are all seen in embryo here. dse Richard Long British, born 1945 County Cork, Ireland 1967 Gelatin silver print, 30 χ 40 in.

A student of the sculptor Anthony Caro at Saint Martins Col lege of Art in London, Long was well versed in the reductive quality of geometric abstraction but sought to make the form of his works even more elegantly simple and wedded to life. Fie would go for soli tary walks in the English countryside, and at a particular place he would create an elemental form such as a line, an X shape, or a circle by walking over the ground to leave a temporary imprint. A photo graph like County Cork, Ireland—in which the shape seems to hover in the image like a flying saucer—is thus an imprint of an imprint; the form of the work is derived from the holistic relationship between the concept (idea), the action of the body (figure), and the site of his ges ture (ground).The photograph also extends and revises the very par ticular relationship between British culture and the landscape, from prehistoric hill figures through theories of the Picturesque. dse David Salle American, born 1952 Untitled 1973 Four gelatin silver prints with affixed product advertisements, each 24 χ 20 in.

Instead of chronicling the campaign, he produced a composite portrait of the power elite—heads of state, union leaders, bankers, media moguls— that was published as a special issue of the magazine. Although his innate sympathies lay outside the realm of the Establishment and his liberal politics often guided his choice of sub jects, Avedon tried to avoid expressing any opinion about his sitters, preferring to let them pose themselves so that his bias would not skew the results.

The Restorers is the curtain raiser for Struth's most celebrated series, the large-scale color photographs that show people looking at art in museums, churches, and other "cathedrals of culture" for a secular age. It dra matically announces his astonishing ability to laminate the timeless and the ephemeral, the ideal and the real, onto a single plane, embodied here in the central female figure, who seems to have stepped right out of one of the paintings under her care. It is also one of Struth's first essays in the genre of portraiture. It is a family portrait of sorts, describing a group of individu als united not by blood but instead by a com munality of purpose—rescuers of the past for the needs of the present, much like Struth him self. The vital connection between its largest meanings and the mission of the Metropolitan make it an especially fine fit for this institution.

Kathryn £ Hurd Fund, by exchange, 2009 (2009.4731 In the 1980s Pat Steir developed a technique that involved applying paint exclusively by dripping and flinging it onto the canvas. Despite the freedom of execution and the large areas of canvas to be addressed, Steir exercises expert control over her methods, which she developed in part through in-depth studies of Japanese and Chinese painting. The pouring process also evokes comparison with the work of Jackson Pollock, but rather than painting on the floor, Steir works from a ladder on unstretched canvas tacked to the wall, pouring and flinging paint, water, or solvent from over saturated brushes and allowing the fluid media to cascade down the length of the support. As she has explained, "the paint itself makes the picture.. .. Gravity makes the image." Sixteen Waterfalls is one of Steir's most mag isterial waterfall compositions and the first of her paintings to be composed almost entirely of dripped paint. Steir also narrowed the param eters of the process in 1990-91 by restricting her palette to black and white.

Nakagawa trained in the Kaga style, which was first developed in the Edo period (1615-1868) and practiced in Kanazawa, and apprenticed to one of only two remaining masters of the method. In his works, which often focus on landscapes at moments of transition, he combines his train ing in contemporary industrial design with his mastery of the traditional inlay technique. For this flower vase he used complex layers of metal inlay to re-create the dark sky of an afternoon rain clearing as sunshine pierces and scatters the clouds. The vase is molded into an almost oval shape, with elongated sides and an indentation at each end.The indenta tions divide the surface into two pictorial areas. One side illustrates heavy rain in vertical lines inlaid in shihuichi, an alloy of copper, silver, and a trace of gold. Dark storm clouds inlaid in shakudô, an alloy of copper and gold, contrast with lighter clouds inlaid in silver and late-day sunshine inlaid in gold.

Gift of Calvin Tomkins and Dodie Kazanjian, 2009 I2009.533a-cl When Cecily Brown moved to New York in 1994 from her native London, her bold, pro vocative paintings drew instant attention. Despite its relatively small scale, this triptych contains all of the intensely expressionistic brushwork and veiled, erotic subject matter for which her large-scale paintings are admired. The three panels represent three interlocking themes and sources that have pervaded Brown's work over the past decade. In the left panel is what appears to be a woman in nineteenth century costume seated before a mirrored van ity. The rounded profile of the mirror and the figure's dark hair merge to create the ghost image of a large skull, the memento mori that is so often present in moralizing representations of"vanity."The center panel, which also bears 80 I RECENT ACQUISITIONS</page><page sequence="79">the ghost image of a skull, is likely based on a favorite source of Brown's, William Hogarth's tavern scene, the third painting in his cycle The Rake's Progress (1734). Here, Hogarth's scene of drunken foreplay dissolves into Brown s turbu lent brushstrokes. The right panel is more dif ficult to place, although it bears a resemblance to other paintings of Brown's that are based on her artistic forebears' depictions of pastorals, picnics, and fêtes champêtres. MP Raqib Shaw Indian, born 1974 Death, Beauty, and Justice V 2008 Mixed media on paper, 32Vi χ 29% in. (82.6x75.2 cm) Gift of the artist, 2010 (2010.146) Death, Beauty, and Justice V depicts the death of one of the many distinctive creatures that inhabit Raqib Shaw's fantastic world. A deceptively beautiful hybrid creature, part dragon, part ostrich, restrains and stabs a bear-headed man, while the skull of an earlier victim and another sword hover above.Yet in this otherwise shock ing scene of bondage and execution the viewer is drawn to the magnificence of the bird's plum age and the mass of colorful butterflies. Born in Calcutta and raised in Kashmir, Shaw now lives and works in London. Joining the traditions and techniques of his native Asia with cosmopolitan and eclectic sources of imagery that he mines in the museums of London, Shaw's pictures present a collision of nature and fantasy, violence and eroticism, that exposes the otherwise hidden side of hedonism. This work was made for Shaw's 2008 show at the Metropolitan, his first solo exhibition in NewYork. gt 2005-8 81</page><page sequence="80">El Anatsui Ghanaian, born 1944 Dusasa II 2007 Found aluminum and copper wire, 17 ft. 11 in. χ 21 ft. 6 in.

Anatsui's wall hanging sculptures are assembled from found materials—typically thousands of discarded aluminum caps and seals from liquor bottles, which he flattens, shapes, perforates, and painstakingly assembles with copper wire. Although he considers himself a sculptor, Anatsui meticulously orchestrates his materials like a painter working with oil on canvas or the director of a tapestry workshop. His work is anchored firmly in his traditional culture (Ghanaian kente cloth),Western art (mosaic, tapestry, chain-mail armor, the paintings of Gustav Klimt), and contemporary life (the consumption of alcohol, the detritus of con sumerism). According to the artist, the title Dusasa can be translated as "a communal patchwork made by a team of townspeople" analogous to his team of assistants. als El Anatsui Ghanaian, born 1944 Dusasa II 2007 Found aluminum and copper wire, 17 ft. 11 in. χ 21 ft. 6 in.

(130.8 χ 251.5 cm) Provenance: [Paula Cooper Gallery, New York], Purchase, Alfred Stieglitz Society Gifts, 2009 (2009.B) Over the past three decades Christian Marclay has carved out a unique place in contemporary art making visual art from the material culture of music: collages of stitched-together album covers, sculptures made from accordions and electric guitars, a pillow knitted from tapes of every Beatles song ever recorded. As both an artist and a noted avant-garde composer, Mar clay explores the fertile territory between sound and vision. Memento (Soul II Soul) belongs to a recent series of photograms cre ated by cracking open commercial cassettes and scattering the unspooled audiotapes in droopy skeins across the image surface. The scale and allover composition of these works recall can vases by Abstract Expressionists such as Jackson Pollock and Cy Twombly, while the medium— cyanotype, a process using light-sensitive iron salts—harks back to the dawn of photography. With their festive yet melancholy compositions, Marclay 's pictures stand as stunning memento mori for two antiquated media: the cyanotype of the 1840s and the cassette tape of the 1970s and 1980s. For this composition Marclay sacri ficed his cassettes of the late 1980s British dance band Soul II Soul. mf 2007-8 83</page></plain_text>
