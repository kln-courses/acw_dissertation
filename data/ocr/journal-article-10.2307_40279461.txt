FARIS TERMS "BAROQUE" AND "NEOBAROQUE" have been frequently used in the last ten or fifteen years to highlight certain modern and contemporary artistic trends and characteristics, particularly in the aesthetic realm. A large body of novels produced in the West since the 1960s has been categorized spo- radically under these rubrics. We are dealing here with a complex issue of defini- tion that concerns Latin America - in other words, Hispanic and Luso-Brazilian America, the French Caribbean, and a wide variety of examples in North Amer- ica, including the U.S., Anglo and Francophone Canada, especially Quebec, and Western Europe.1 In the following article, I propose a brief taxonomic analysis Editors' Note: This article was originally published in French: "Le (Néo) Baroque: Enquête critique sur la transformation et l'application d'un champ notionnel," Imprévue 1 (1987): 11-43.

This is, first and foremost, an attempt to devise a hypothetical notion of the (Neo) Baroque, to clarify certain aesthetic and narrative trends that characterize its novelistic production, and then to develop general theoretical and methodological foundations to test my hypothesis. I will be brief in my discussion of Alejo Carpentier, because his work as a whole would involve us in issues that, while related to our concerns, nonetheless complicate - even confuse - a field that is already complicated enough. I am thinking here, naturally, of "lo real maravilloso" (the marvelous real), which Car- pentier associates with the German Franz Roh's Magischer Realismus (magical realism) of the twenties, on the one hand, and with Haitian cultural roots, on the other. (In this context we must not forget to mention the "réalisme merveilleux" [marvelous realism] of Jacques Roumain and especially Jacques Stephen Alexis.)2 For Carpentier, the Baroque isn't a seventeenth-century invention or a deca- dent art form, and still less a historical style, but rather a mental constant char- acterized by fear of a void, of plain surface and linear-geometrical harmony - a style in which what he calls "proliferating nuclei" multiply around a central axis. In his words, decorative elements that completely fill the space of the construction, the walls, all architecturally available space: motifs that contain their own expansive energy, that launch or project forms cen- trifugally. It is art in motion, a pulsating art, an art that moves outward and away from the center, that somehow breaks through its own borders. . . ("The Baroque and the Marvelous Real" 93) Taking off from the formulations of the Catalonian Eugenio d'Ors, who finds Baroque elements in the arts of every century, Carpentier further expands the idea of the Baroque by universalizing it. Thus, in the literary realm, all Indian litera- ture, all Iranian literature, is Baroque. And if, in contrast, Cervantes is not Baroque, Carpentier, Quevedo, Calderón, Góngora, and Graciân are; likewise Rabelais ("the prince of French Baroque writers"), Ariosto's Orlando Furioso, and Shake- speare are Baroque; so are Novalis's Heinrich von Ofterdingen, Goethe's second Faust, Rimbaud's Illuminations, even Lautréamont's Chants de Maldoror, as well as Proust, and even (surprise!) Mayakovsky's poetry. Carpentier considers the Baroque a human constant that cannot be confined to an architectural, aesthetic, or picto- (alias Reshard Gool), but also recent novels from the Prairies (the great plains of Central and Mid- Western Canada) from authors of differing origins, such as Joseph Skvorecky, Robert Kroetsch, Jack Hodgins, Leon Rooke, Geoffery Ursell; Quebec: Hubert Aquin, Réjean Ducharme, Gérard Bes- sette, Jacques Ferron, Victor-Levy Beaulieu, Michel Tremblay, among many others; Western Europe'. the English writers D.M. Thomas and Anthony Burgess (in The End of the World News) ; some character- istics in the German novelist Günter Grass; the Italians Italo Calvino and Alberto Moravia (in The Inner Life)', the Frenchmen Claude Simon (Géorgiques) , Ranaud Camus (and his various aliases), and even some aspects of Georges Perec; the Spaniards Juan Goytisolo, Miguel Espinosa, and the novels of the "narraluces boom," or even some Canary Islanders like Emilio Sanchez Ortiz. 2 An in-depth study of the different and often contradictory relations between the marvelous real (in Carpentier), magical realism (in Roh), and their successors is yet to come. On this topic, see Juan Barroso VIII, especially the two first chapters; see also Aragon's Le Paysan de Paris (Nightwalker) , Sur- realism in general, as well as other more or less neighboring and parallel ideas, like négritude, or qué- bécitude, and (why not?) "mythological realism," in Michel Butor's La modification.</page><page sequence="3">THE (NEO) BAROQUE EFFECT / 297 rial movement born in the seventeenth century because "we discover that the baroque has flourished in all ages, sporadically at times, and at times as the main characteristic of a culture" (94). Thus America, a "continent of symbiosis, muta- tions, vibrations, mestizaje, has always been baroque" (98). Ever since the Popol Vuh and the books of Chilam Balam, through Aztec sculpture and the Nâhuatl language, Latin America is the preferred land of the Baroque, because all symbiosis, all mestizaje, engenders the baroque. The American baroque develops along with cri- ollo culture, with the meaning of criollo, with the self-awareness of the American man, be he the son of a white European, the son of a black African or an Indian born on the continent. . . , the aware- ness of being Other, of being new, of being symbiotic, of being a criollo; and the criollo spirit is itself a baroque spirit. (100) And again, our world is baroque because of its architecture - this goes without saying - the unruly complexities of its nature and its vegetation, the many colors that surround us, the telluric pulse of the phenomena that we still feel. (105) In the twentieth century, from Ramón del Valle Inclân to Rubén Darfo's early works, Carpentier asks, "[w]hat, then, is modernismo, especially in its first stage, if not extremely baroque poetry?" (106), while at the same time admitting that its excesses verge on the absurd (in Herrera y Reissig's poetry, for example) . He even cites the writers José Marti (!), Rómulo Gallegos, Jose Eustacio Rivera, Miguel Angel Asturias, and, of course, includes more recent writers: The baroque that you are familiar with in the contemporary Latin American novel, which is often called the "new novel," of the "boom" - and the "boom," as I have said before, is not a concrete thing nor does it define anything - is the result of a generation of novelists still alive today who are produc- ing works that translate the scope of America from its cities to its jungles and fields in a wholly baroque fashion. (107) From Alejo Carpentier, in fact, we get an ontological conception of the Baroque "à la Eugenio d'Ors," but it is as if it were a reversed d'Ors or, rather, an upside down d'Ors. For d'Ors, the Baroque appears at crucial cultural moments that mark decadent periods, whereas for Carpentier, far from signaling deca- dence, "this baroque always projects forward and tends, in fact, toward a phase of expansion at the culminating moment of a civilization" (98). This idea of a Baroque that traverses particular eras and cultures more or less at random is something like the narrator of Carpentier's "Semejante a la noche" ("Like the Night"), who is just as much a warrior in Agamemnon's army as a new world con- quistador or an allied soldier liquidating "the new Teutonic order" (an allusion to Hitler's troops) . All of this concerns an idea of history as a series of repetitions that nonethe- less encompasses moments of transformation and change. Like Michel Foucault, Carpentier understands historical process in terms of epistemological para- digms that can be expressed by certain aesthetic options in the realm of artistic production. Here it is a question of "Baroque" options and, from a methodolog- ical standpoint, a question of an ahistorical structuralist approach. In similar fashion, Severo Sarduy's ideas derive from what I would call "syncre- tism" in literary theory, a syncretism articulated in a critical spirit based solidly on structuralist principles. We should clarify at the outset what is meant by syn- cretism. First, the term designates, in a more or less neutral way, a philosophical</page><page sequence="4">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE / 298 system that tries to reconcile different ideologies. Thus, in the Latin American context, by syncretism we mean the process whereby the interaction and mixture of ideologies, religions, and rituals (Catholicism and indigenous beliefs) even- tually produce cultural "hybridity" in general. But recall that the word syncretism comes from the Greek ai&gt;yKpr|Ti(j[ioç ("the convergence of two opponents with a third"), of oòv ("with"), and from kpt]to£(ji&gt; ("to act or speak like a Cretan, i.e., an impostor"). Thus the reconciliation seems to be based on a closing of the gap between contraries whose combination verges on treason in the form of (ideo- logical and semantic) deception. This etymological interpretation resembles the definition of syncretism that derives from Vereiningung ohne Verarbeitung (unifica- tion without digestion) . Given the way I use the term here, the following definition seems more appropriate: "a factitious combination of originally disparate ideas or theories that seem compatible only because they are not clearly understood" (Lalande 1087). Sarduy's main thesis is that today there is a Baroque experience. He writes: To be Baroque today means to threaten, judge, and parody the bourgeois economy, which is funda- mentally and centrally based on the miserly management of wealth: the space of signs, of language, the symbolic foundation of society, the guarantee of its functioning, of its means of communication. To waste, to squander, to spoil language just for fun - and not, as we do every day, for informational purposes - is an attack on moral and "natural" common sense - like Galileo's circle - which forms the basis for the whole ideology of consumption and accumulation. The Baroque subverts the suppos- edly normal order, like an ellipse - an added value - subverts and distorts the shape of a circle, which idealist tradition thought to be the most perfect shape of all. (Barroco 99-100) Thus, if we are living at a time when the Baroque is possible, "how can we cre- ate, what would it be to create, Baroque effects today?" ("Disequilibrium" 35) and, more precisely, "where can we find the results of a Baroque aesthetic discourse today?" (La doublure 97). Sarduy begins with this ontological idea of the Baroque, which is to say a Baroque that can reappear at different historical periods, but, in contrast to Carpentieri ideas, he retains the theory that the Baroque originated in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. If it is clear that the Baroque exists today, the problem, as far as he is concerned, is to locate and define it: If it is easy in retrospect to see how [the Baroque] was created in the seventeenth century, it is much more complicated to guess how we would create it today. A simple understanding of Baroque effects assumes, for example, that Baroque literature and painting are proliferating arts, and that deliber- ate strategies like kitsch, camp, retro, etc. are metaphors for it - as is all adjectivally excessive or luxu- riously narrative art. ("Disequilibrium" 35) For Sarduy, it's a question of Baroque effects: Distorted and overemphasized repetitions, or like the discourse that arose in the seventeenth cen- tury out of a desperate will to teach, a wish to convince, to prove without a doubt - by means of theatrical lighting, by clearly defined outlines - what the accompanying words were trying to say. Not the repetitions of the original Baroque, but, as with Lezama Lima in literature, the laws and premises of a new Baroque that integrates the pedagogical clarity of the older forms, their legibil- ity, their informational power, at the same time that it undertakes to penetrate them, to expose or undermine them from inside by using their own parody, their own humor and intransigence - this belongs to our times. (La doublure 97-98) This last quote suggests an "angry Baroque," a contemporary Baroque effect that Sarduy describes as being "nothing like it seems, the persistence or recurrence of a symptom, or an imitation, faithful though it may be, but a substitution - albeit</page><page sequence="5">THE (NEO) BAROQUE EFFECT / 299 very sober and austere - of one paradigm, like the circle, by another one, like the ellipse ("Disequilibrium" 35). Returning to the traditional distinction between Classicism and the Baroque, Sarduy briefly describes what his idea of a "Baroque treatment" of information is: [Figurative language, the Classical sentence, conveys information via the simplest route: "straight- forward" syntax, a hierarchical arrangement of characters, and an orchestration of their actions aimed at presenting the essential elements of l'istoria, or the meaning of the parable, without any extra "sound effects." Baroque spectacle, in contrast, postpones conveying meaning, delaying it as long as possible through its theatrical apparatus and its multiple readings, disclosing at last not a fixed and univocal meaning, but glimmerings and ambiguities. (La doublure 98) And finally, in a typically structuralist (methodological) move, Sarduy transfers this same dichotomy to modern linguistics: After Saussure, in virtually everything from molecular biology to electronics, the general model we used for reading the world was basically a linguistic one - and the really essential thing is that we used a binary system. So, what would happen if the system were replaced either by a much more proliferating one of Chomskyian trees, or even by a cosmology . . . that could work only with a plu- rality of models that contradicted each other? ("Disequilibrium" 35) All of these long passages are quoted in order to show that for Sarduy the key term - typically Lacanian - is the (modern, contemporary) effect, whose proce- dures and components we need to determine. A Baroque redefined in terms of a Neobaroque, this is the purpose of his essay "The Baroque and the Neobaroque." Here he tries to formulate a working definition of the Baroque that could read- ily be applied to twentieth-century Latin American art: Rather than amplifying the concept of the Baroque - uncontainable metonymization - we would, on the contrary, prefer to restrict it, to reduce it to a precise operating schema that eschews inter- stices and the abuse of terminological casualness from which this notion has recently suffered, especially among us, and instead try to codify the pertinence of its application to present-day Latin American art. ("Baroque and Neobaroque") Aside from all the difficulties that appear immediately with what Sarduy proposes, one should note that he is certainly the first, in the Hispanic world anyway, to try to formulate this problem in specifically theoretical terms. What is Sarduy trying to prove in this essay? First of all, he insists on the ambi- guity inherent in the idea of the Baroque (he spends about ten lines pointing out etymological problems), and he laments what he considers the movement from one ideology to another, rather than from an ideology to a scientific study of the Baroque - in other words, a real epistemological break. Thus, and this seems emi- nently logical, he looks to Jean Rousset for a descriptive basis to characterize the Baroque (in relation to Classicism) on the aesthetic level, and Rousset responds in terms of artificialization. Sarduy emphasizes that Rousset's work on the French Baroque, like that of Dâmaso Alonso on the Spanish poet Góngora, "deconstructs" the process of artificialization by means of a strategy analogous to what Chomsky terms "metametalanguage." Given the extreme artificialization of certain Latin American texts, Sarduy advises us that he will describe three or four contemporary techniques of artificialization: substitution, proliferation, condensation, and its varia- tion, permutation. Their functions are described in the Saussurian terms of rela- tions between signifier and signified (see "The Baroque and the Neobaroque"). Inspired by Roman Jakobson's linguistics and Jacques Lacan's psychoana- lytic thought, from an analytic standpoint Sarduy 's approach clearly fits into the</page><page sequence="6">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE / 300 framework of the Tel Quel group (to which Sarduy belonged in the sixties) . Their work attempts to assert the autonomy of the signifier with respect to the signi- fied, and thereby quite radically modifies the Saussurian system while still utiliz- ing the same terminological structure. Heavily influenced by Julia Kristeva in particular, Sarduy goes so far as to merge psychoanalysis and the semiotics of language. We are now confronted with what I would call a first theoretical syn- cretism: within an analysis of the techniques for creating artifice there is a theo- retical abstraction of Saussure's ideas, then a recuperation of his terminology that is subsequently superimposed on a description of the workings of the Freud- ian unconscious, especially in dreams. The sometime result is no longer a tex- tual or a linguistic analysis but rather a "psychotextual analysis." In short, it is by means of the things revolving around the drifting signifier that Sarduy attempts to define an idea of multiplicity that underscores for him the process of creating a language of Baroque artifice. At this point in his analysis, Sarduy introduces Mikhail Bakhtin. Inasmuch as the Latin American Baroque permits implicit readings, readings that reveal and decipher second hidden texts underlying the first, this contemporary Baroque participates in the idea of parody as Bakhtin described it. For Sarduy, carnivaliza- tion immediately implies parody in the sense of confrontation, of interactions on different levels, different linguistic textures, intertextuality. Thus the Baroque occurs simultaneously as "a space of dialogism, polyphony, carnivalization, par- ody and intertextuality, . . . [that] presents itself, then, as a network of connec- tions, of successive filigrees whose graphic expression would not be linear, two- dimensional, flat, but instead voluminous, spatial, and dynamic" ("The Baroque and the Neobaroque"). Sarduy suggests a "semiotics of the Baroque," in which we find, among other things, Kristeva's principles of "pheno-text" and "genotext." In "The Baroque and the Neobaroque," Sarduy explains that by intertextuality he means everything that comprises visible discourses in the form of collage ("super- imposition on the surface of this text, an elementary form of dialogue that modi- fies none of its elements, nor alters its voice"), which he merges with quotation and reminiscence (a procedure that, the reverse of collage, is an "incorporation in which the foreign text melds indistinguishably with the original.") And intratextual- ity refers to texts that are only decipherable between the visible lines of the text, which Sarduy classifies, after Kristeva, as phonetic, semic, and syntagmatic elements. All of this allows Sarduy to grasp Baroque space in terms of overabundance and waste: The Baroque, superabundance, brimming cornucopia, prodigality and wastefulness - hence the moral resistance it has provoked in certain cultures of economy and moderation, like the French - a mockery of all functionality, of all sobriety, is also the solution to this verbal saturation, the trop plein of the word, the abundance of nouns in relation to what is named, what can be enumerated, the flooding of things bywords. Hence also its mechanism of periphrasis, of digression and detour, of duplication and even tautology. ("The Baroque and the Neobaroque") Baroque language is not an economical mode of communication, strictly reduced to its ordinary function of conveying information, as Sarduy continues to explain, but rather one that delights precisely in the supplementary and the overdeter- mined, in the search for the incomplete object. That search engenders repetition of the useless and defines itself as a game, in contrast to the resolute nature of Clas- sical texts, which Sarduy consistently defines as work.</page><page sequence="7">THE (NEO) BAROQUE EFFECT / 301 Let us pause for a moment to note another syncretism, this time a double one. First, as with Kristeva and the Tel Quel group generally, we can detect the influ- ence of the Russian Formalists in Sarduy's work, especially in the idea of literariness that comes to differentiate poetic/literary language from daily/communicative language. Sarduy revisits this principle in order to work out the (indefensible) distinction between work and the communicative nature of the text called Classi- cal, on the one hand, and the play and pleasure of the text called Baroque, on the other. Second, if Sarduy manipulates certain characteristic elements belonging to the Kristevan sense of intertextuality, we should recall that this idea is not found anywhere in Bakhtin, no matter what Sarduy and Kristeva say.3 Furthermore, Sar- duy's argument distances us considerably from Bakhtin's anti-Formalist remarks, making Bakhtin say just what he said he was opposed to! This same mindset characterizes Sarduy's description of the elements of Baroque language in general, where he finally engages the distinction between Baroque and Neobaroque. The European Baroque and the first Latin American Baroque (which are treated as a single entity - yet another syncretism) produce images of a mobile universe, decentered but always harmonious and still homoge- neous since it was defined from the outside by the double authoritarian logos of the Jesuits' God and his earthly equivalent, the king. The Neobaroque, by con- trast, seems to define itself from the inside by an internal rupture: The contemporary Baroque, the Neobaroque, reflects structurally the disharmony, the rupture of homogeneity, of the logos as an absolute, the lack that constitutes our epistemic foundation. Neo- baroque of disequilibrium, structural reflection of a desire that cannot attain its object, a desire for which the logos has organized only a screen to conceal this lack. The gaze is no longer infinite: as a partial object, it has converted itself into a lost object. The route - real or verbal - no longer simply leaps over innumerable divisions; we know it attempts something that constantly escapes it, or, rather, whose route is divided by the very absence around it, which it displaces. Neobaroque: a necessarily pulverized reflection of a knowledge that knows it is no longer "calmly" closed upon itself. ("The Baroque and the Neobaroque") Sarduy doesn't identify the transformative processes, the ruptures between the Baroque and the Neobaroque; rather, he considers them to be two styles, like two different "animals" [bêtes] appearing in different historical periods. Nonetheless, he grasps elements that belong to both. In this analysis, then, there is no taxo- nomic distinction between different levels of literary practice or different kinds of artistic production. What is defined in terms of procedures for the creation of Baroque artifice is nothing other than his initial concept, the contemporary Neo- baroque. According to Sarduy's own examples, the bases for these techniques can be applied as well to Góngora as to Pablo Neruda, to Gregorio de Matos and Har- oldo de Campos, to Velazquez and Cruz Diez, and in a general way to the mod- ern and contemporary novel, whether Leopoldo Maréchal, Guillermo Cabrera Infante, Lezama Lima, Guimaräes Rosa, or Maurice Roche. This also explains his confusion of carnivalesque space with the space of polyphony; for Bakhtin, car- nival develops in the tension produced by oppositions (which can't be substituted for each other), whereas polyphony refers back to the coincidence of multiple 3 Even as she claims to be operating from a Bakhtinian standpoint, Kristeva's perspective stems from an ahistorical view of textual productivity, while Bakhtin always emphasizes the particular social, economic, and historical situation of textual production. On this topic, see my articles listed in the works cited.</page><page sequence="8">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE / 302 consciousnesses or of different but equivalent narrative situations in dialogical interaction with each other. In short, Sarduy's analysis exemplifies the general pro- cess of non-axiological syncretism that typifies a large part of contemporary West- ern thought and philosophy, and whose theoretical analogue is the desperate desire to change a concept into a component of an ideology at any price. With the notion of Baroque effect, Sarduy describes and encounters above all a symptom; he makes all historical reality into a pure and simple abstraction. For him, it's not a question of the metabolic transformation from Baroque to Neobaroque; if there is any system operative in the construction of the Neobaroque, as Sarduy claims, it is a systematized violation of the system itself, which limits the Neobaroque to the modernization of the Baroque, in short, to the "neo"-baroquizing of the Baroque. And once again we encounter structuralism pushed to an extreme, even an aberration, whose distinguishing characteristic is an analytical method based on ahistorical paradigms in which everything is replaceable, assimilable, adjustable. In Haroldo de Campos we encounter the same mistakes as in Sarduy. This is most flagrantly obvious when de Campos claims that the novels Paradiso, by Lezama Lima, and Grande Sertäo (translated as The Devil to Pay in the Backlands), byjoäo Guimaräes Rosa, are "baroque books: neobaroque, really' ("Beyond" 233; my emphasis). Of course, he explains what he understands to be the characteristics of these two texts, but he makes no distinctions anywhere between Baroque and Neobaroque styles. Thus Guimaräes Rosa's book is Baroque (or Neobaroque?) because of its continual inventions of words, its innovative syntactical features, its lexical hybridity that goes from archaisms to neologisms and verbal montages, its oxymoronic confrontation between savagery and refinement, its trope of "for- bidden" or "perverse love." Lezama's book is Baroque (or Neobaroque?) because of its Gongorist metaphorization of the ordinary, its prodigious language that seems scandalous in a novel, its substitution of the multifaceted unity of poetic discourse for the conventions of the realistic novel with its required verisimilitude, its concrete mysticism, its fusion of the sophisticated with the naïve (which at times almost verges on kitsch) , and, finally, its theme of love that also comes under the rubric of forbidden Eros. Elsewhere, in a more recent article, de Campos refers to Sarduy in order to clar- ify his own idea of the Baroque: "the baroque seen by Severo Sarduy as a Bahk- tinian phenomenon par excellence: the ludibrious space of polyphony and of lan- guage in convulsion" ("Rule" 50) . Again we detect the confusion between polyphony and carnival: in Bakhtin, modalities such as ludic space and convulsive language refer to literary techniques of a carnivalesque vision rather than to those charac- terized by polyphony. So Haroldo de Campos reveals another kind of connection that I would not hesitate to call completely bewildering from a theoretical standpoint. Indirectly, under the guise of an explanation of the Baroque, de Campos assimilates carni- valization to a "cannibal reason," a unique feature of Brazilian (and certain aspects of Latin American) culture. Here he is revolting against approaches coming out of a naïve or uninformed sociological perspective, against the kind of reduction- ism that declares an economically underdeveloped country necessarily and auto- matically underdeveloped with respect to its literature; de Campos understands an "underdeveloped literature" to be a literature that is incapable of innovation or an avant garde sensibility. On the contrary, he works from the assumptions of</page><page sequence="9">THE (NEO) BAROQUE EFFECT / 303 Voloshinov/Bakhtin to propose that all literature is open, inter-semiotic: "a point of intersection of discourses, a necessary dialogue and not a xenophobic mono- logue, a parallelogram of forces in dialectic tension and not a mimetic-pavlovian equating" ("Rule" 43). An example would be Oswaldo de Andrade's Cannibalist Manifesto, which de Campos considers a trenchant example of the need to think about the national in a dialectical and dialogical relationship to the universal. For de Campos, Andrade practices this kind of "cannibal reason": the thought of critical devoration of the universal cultural heritage, formulated not from the insipid, resigned perspective of the "noble savage" (idealized within the model of European virtues in the "nativist" line of Brazilian Romanticism by Gonçalves Dias and José de Alencar, for example) but from the point of view of the "bad savage," devourer of whites - the cannibal. The latter view does not involve a submission (an indoctrination), but a transculturation, or, better, a "transvalori- zation": a critical view of History as a negative function (in Nietzsche's sense of the term), capable of appropriation and of expropriation, de-hierarchization, deconstruction. (44) Recalling ideas about the autonomy of art, especially those of Theodor Adorno and Hans Robert Jauss, de Campos addresses an ontological and modal nation- alism that is defined precisely by and through difference: Hence the necessity to consider difference, to consider nationalism as a dialogical movement of dif- ference (and not as the Platonic apotheosis of origin or as a homogenizing leveler): the dis-character, instead of the character, the rupture instead of the linear course; historiography as the seismic graph of fragmentation, rather than the tautological homologation of the homogenous. A refusal of the essentialist metaphor of gradual, harmonious natural evolution. A new idea of tradition (anti- tradition) to be made operative as a counter-revolution, as a countercurrent opposed to the glorious, prestigious canon. (45) So, Haroldo de Campos finds the original bases for this Brazilian "devouring dif- ferentiation" in the Baroque. Because Latin Americans began with the Baroque - imported from Europe and therefore universal - it had no infancy (infans: he who does not speak). They were never aphasie. They were born adults (like certain mythological heroes), speaking an extremely elaborate international code: the Baroque rhetorical code (with late medieval and Renaissance traces, already-distilled, in the case of Brazil, by the Mannerism of Camöes - this last, moreover, a stylistic influence in Góngora). To articulate itself as a difference, in relationship to this panoply of universalia: this is our "birth" as a literature, a sort of parthenogenesis without an ontological egg (we could say - the difference as origin or the egg of Columbus . . .). (47) As far as colonial Brazilian literature is concerned, to talk about a Baroque code was to try to create distance from Europe "by metamorphosing the same models" ("a diferença de moriose do mesmo") (48). The outstanding example, the pre- mier "transculturator," is obviously Gregorio de Matos, who translated two sonnets by Góngora in a very personal way, adding an ironic touch to the combination of metropolitan and tropical materials (see "Rule" 48). De Campos also mentions, in Hispanic America, Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz in Mexico and Juan del Valle de Cav- iedes in Peru, thus arriving at his main idea: Already in the Baroque a possible "rule of anthropophagy" develops; it deconstructs the logocen- trism we inherited from the West. Differential within the Universal, it began with the Baroque dis- tortions and contortions of a discourse which could disentangle us from the same. It is an anti- tradition which passes through the gaps of traditional historiography, which filters through its breaks, which edges through its fissures. This is not based on a directly derived anti-tradition - for this would be the substitution of one linearity for another - but on the recognition of certain marginal paths or patterns alongside the preferred course of normative historiography. In prose, at a certain point in this meandering process, within a specific configuration, it would produce the seam of the picaresque novel [romance malandrò] . . . (49-50)</page><page sequence="10">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE / 304 It is an anti-tradition that, beginning with Gregorio de Matos and passing through Oswaldo de Andrade, continues in contemporary Brazilian poetry, an "anti- normative" concrete poetry. For Haroldo de Campos, this anti-tradition is just another name for "carnivalization." While Bakhtin himself would agree that the literary carnivalesque and its par- ticular aesthetic modes and ideologies derive from a kind of noncanonical anti- tradition when we are dealing with the theory of the novel, the problem is that Haroldo de Campos makes "carnivalization" into an all-encompassing theoretical/ ideological synonym for "cannibal reason," for polyphony, for the Baroque: For some time, these new barbarians' devouring jaws have been gnawing at and "ruining" a cultural heritage that is ever more global, in relationship to which its ex-centrifying and deconstructing attack functions with the marginal impetus of the carnivalesque, de-sacralizing, profaning the anti-tradition evoked by Bakhtin in counterpoint to the privileged course of Lukâcsian epic positivism, to mono- logical literature, to the closed, single-voiced work. In contrast, the combinatory and ludibrious poly- culturalism, the parodie transmutation of meaning and values, the open, multi-lingual hybridization are the devices responsible for the constant feeding and re-feeding of this Baroque soulmoment, the carnivalized trans-encyclopedia of the new barbarians, where everything can coexist with everything. They are mechanisms which crush the material of tradition with the teeth of a tropical sugar-mill, changing stalks and protective coverings into husks and cane syrup. (55) From a strictly narratological perspective, Haroldo de Campos engages the con- cept of intertextuality as Kristeva defines it: Lezama criol-izes Proust and inter-communicates Mallarmé with Góngora: his quotations are trun- cated and approximate, like the remains of a diluvian digestion.

Of Carpentier, Carlos Fuentes, and Vargas Llosa, we could sayjust as much: other decoctions, other arabesques, various and singular assemblages. (55-56) Cannibal reason, intertextuality (in other words, textuality with all its various pre- fixes), carnivalization, polyphony, the Baroque, the Neobaroque: let's be clear. They are all historical variables; they derive from different categories; they are different entities with different functions; they developed in hierarchically specific power relations and cannot be substituted for each other; still less can they be synonymous terms. Naturally it is not possible to examine here the development of all syncretic combinations. On the other hand, we can clarify the relationship between Bakhtin's categories and the idea of the (Neo) baroque, relationships that seem to me espe- cially questionable as Sarduy and Haroldo de Campos have presented them. I propose an etymological digression that rewrites the principal definitions of the Baroque as they relate to the objects and events to which they refer. In other words, we need to find the kind of argumentative logic that accounts for the prom- ulgation of the (Neo) baroque as a contemporary aesthetic program; we need to restore to that term the particular qualities that belong to it and that define it as a precise and useful conceptualization of the phenomenon to which it refers. It is certainly not a question of asking ourselves whether such and such a definition best defines the idea of a contemporary (Neo) baroque, and certainly we want to avoid the old idea that "to name is to understand." The strategy of an etymological digression, need we recall, is not a game of "floating signifiers" but, on the con- trary, a search for signifieds.</page><page sequence="11">THE (NEO) BAROQUE EFFECT / 305 First of all, the term "Baroque" is not polysémie; rather, it is made up of hom- onyms that intersect semantically over time. One can trace the encounter between meanings and linguistic accidents, as in the case of the words estimer (to respect) and aimer (to love), which, toward the thirteenth century, become aismer (to love), favoring the mystical nature of courtly love and bringing sexual attraction into the notion of respect. From a historical point of view, the word "Baroque" traces three large trajectories - and in this context I refer you to Bruno Magliori's article "Etimologia e storia del termine 'Baroco'" ("The Etymology and History of the Term 'Baroque'"), whose ideas are the basis for my discussion. The first trajectory comes out of the scholasti- cism of the logicians: in the thirteenth century, baroco was a mnemonic term that referred to one kind of syllogism. The second trajectory is the one most continu- ous with our usage; it is probably the most widely used and, little by little, encom- passes the arts in general. It refers to the Portuguese word barroco, which designates an irregular pearl (whence the homologous Spanish words barrueco or berrueco, and, much later, the French word baroque) and which, toward the eighteenth cen- tury, moves semantically into the realms of artistic and aesthetic form. The third trajectory, and the one with which I will begin my etymological digression, repre- sents perhaps the least known meaning of the word baroque, and certainly not the least interesting one. It comes from an old system of financial transactions, and is specifically associated with the economic realm. At the end of the fourteenth century in Tuscany, the terms barocco, barrocolo, and even barrochio designated a kind of usurer's contract that consisted of selling merchandise on credit at a high price and then buying it back in cash for a mod- est sum. It was a kind of fictional exchange by means of which the letter of credit played the crucial role of raising the actual value of merchandise artificially, and for a determined period of time, at the expense of a third party. This use of the term barocco figures in many theological, literary, and legal documents in Italian and Latin, and notably in a 1606 Florentine treatise on criminology (Resolutio- num criminalium centuriae duo, by Pietro Cavallo or Petrus Caballus). In French, Molière's The Miser (1667) is a well-known example of this kind of swindle. In Act2, the Flèche - the English translation retains the French names - Cléante's valet, reads him the lender's contract (drawn up by Harpagon, who doesn't know that the borrower is his own son), which Cléante requests in order to marry Marianne. Even while stipulating an interest rate of five and a half per cent on the loan, the contract specifies that the lender, not having the amount of cash requested, will himself borrow at twenty per cent, and that naturally the penalty for that higher rate will be paid by the first borrower. Furthermore, the lender affirms that there are still one thousand ecus missing from the requested amount and that he will provide the borrower, at a so-called modest price, with a whole batch of more or less damaged merchandise, actually worth scarcely two tenths of the value of the missing cash. It is a double scam in which inflation is created artificially to profit the lender. From its purely economic beginnings, the expression stóc e baróc passes into the vernacular. In the area around Bologna, we still find a frequently used phrase, férdi stócc e barlóc, meaning a deceptive practice of buying something and in the process making money, in other words, of investing for unwarranted</page><page sequence="12">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE / 306 profit - compiere imbrogli, raggiri ("to practice deceit for profit," or simply "deceiv- ing and cheating").4 The second trajectory, in which the term baroco concerns a syllogism, appears in the Summulae logicales by Pietro Ispano, who was born in Lisbon around 1210-20 and died in 1277. He lists examples of the neologisms whose syllables and vowels serve as mnemonic devices to remember different types of syllogisms: Barbara, celarent, darii, ferion [sic] , baralipton Cesare, camestres, festino, baroco, darapti In this treatise, the author explains the baroco formula: the first vowel (a) indicates a universal affirmative proposition in the first part of the syllogism, while the second and third (o) indicate a particular affirmative proposition. The letter b shows that it is an irregular syllogism that can be reduced to the first mode of the first figure (Barbara), and the letter c (in baroco) indicates the way the reduction is effected. André Lalande explains that the word baroco (sometimes baroko) is a mode that refers to Barbara by a regression or a reduction to the absurd (Lalande 107-08). From the end of the fourteenth century on, the syllogistic formula begins to change in meaning; Erasmus declares its uselessness in Ratio verae theologiae (The Method of True Theology, 1519) and in 1570 a certain Giovan Francesco Ferrari calls it an " argomento in baroco."0 The phrases argomento in baroco and sillogismo in baroco are used repeatedly over a long period in Italy, and Ferrari's fantastic imagination plays on the names of the different types of syllogisms: "rimasi convinto in bara- lipton, per riconstrar certi darii, che l'ferono parer un baroco" ("I was convinced by a baralipton, in order to come up with the meaning of some darii, which made the baralipton look like a baroco").6 In the sixteenth century in France a polemic evolved around the validity of the syllogism; Antoine Artaud still defends it while Montaigne, in his anti-scholasticism, 4 Barlóc or berlóc, respectively Bolognese and Milanese for "dumb," probably have little to do with the term "baroque." Originally, they were popular names for the devil, particularly in folk tales where the devil is duped by a clever peasant. The standard Italian spelling for the word is berlicche, and "to remain like berlicche" is an expression still in use. We are grateful to Alessandro Carrera at the University of Houston for his help on matters of Italian usage and syllogistic logic here and in the following footnote. - EDS. 5 Giovan Francesco Ferrari was a poet from Modena (d. 1588) whose poems ("Rime"), where the reference to argomento in baroco is probably found, were published in 1570. This phrase indicates a weak argument or weak logic, because - despite its formal correctness - the structure of the baroco syllogism may lead to irrelevant or pointless conclusions, as Ferrari's phrase concluding this para- graph suggests. This may explain the use of the term as a negative judgment on a particular work of art, or an entire artistic style. - EDS. 6 A paraphrase would be: "I was convinced by 'All politicians are thieves; all who fear prison are politicians; therefore all thieves fear prison'" [baralipton], in order to come up with the meaning of "All thieves fear prison; some politicians are thieves; therefore some politicians fear prison" [darii] , which made the baralipton look like "All thieves fear prison; some politicians do not fear prison; therefore, some politicians are not thieves" [baroco]. This phrase plays with the absurdity of syllo- gistic logic when it is pushed to the extreme, because the initial premise "All politicians are thieves" is "logically" denied by the conclusion of the third syllogism ("Some politicians are not thieves"). It is likely that Ferrari meant to indicate that every meaning can be reversed by means of purely syl- logistic logic. The trick is that the minor premise of the baralipton ("All who fear prison are politi- cians") cannot be demonstrated. It is perhaps worth noting that Aristotle did not include the bar- alipton among the syllogisms that he accepted as valid. - EDS.</page><page sequence="13">THE (NEO) BAROQUE EFFECT / 307 has already disengaged himself from it. After the eighteenth century, the syllo- gism falls out of use and becomes nothing but a term for classification; it loses its meaning, becoming merely a symbol of nonsensical formalism. Thus, at a certain point the term becomes purely figurative, and at the same time acquires a pejora- tive connotation; in 1711, Saint Simon designates "an incongruous project" by the word "Baroque." Thus the term begins to operate in homonymie synthesis with the first etymology that I mentioned: a venture that is seen as going against the rules of savoir-faire or good manners joins the deceitful impropriety of the usu- rer's contract. The 1740 edition of the Dictionnaire de l'Académie française speaks of the Baroque in precisely the sense of "irregular, bizarre, uneven [inégal]. A Baroque mind, a Baroque expression, a Baroque figure of speech." With the word uneven we encounter, further, a homonymie syncretism with the Portuguese word barroco, meaning an irregular or imperfectly spherical pearl. All the same, the etymological relationship with the old scholasticism of the logicians persists for another few years; thus, in the 1766 supplement to the Dictionnaire de la Musique Jean-Baptiste Rousseau adds to his definition of Baroque music that "it would seem that this term [Baroque] comes from the logicians' Baroco" And in a letter dated the 6th of April 1788, signed by Mme. Roland, we find the following sen- tence: "I no longer know whether you are making a Baroque argument or some other kind" [i.e., your argument is confused. - TRANS.]. But it is the term barroco as it designates an irregular pearl that provides the richest trajectory of meaning because it allows us to trace the word "Baroque" as it is applied to the arts up to our own time. Barroco designated an irregular pearl throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Thus we find, for example, the following entry in the Glossaire archéologique (1531), the French inventory of Charles V: "97 large ajorffes [pearls] called Baroque wrapped in seven nets." The word baroque is used for the first time in French in Furetière's 1690 diction- ary as a "jeweler's term for pearls that are not completely round." After 1700, the term gathers meanings that tend in the direction of the bizarre and the extrava- gant; in 1771, Trévoux's dictionary places it definitively in the realm of taste and aesthetic style: "in painting, a picture, an image in Baroque style, in which the rules of proportion are not followed, in which everything is represented accord- ing to the artist's whim." In his Dictionnaire de la Musique, Rousseau emphasizes that "Baroque music is music in which harmony is disrupted, full of modulations and dissonance . . . and the movement is constrained." Moreover, this definition implicitly coincides with the effect provoked by polyphony when it bursts through in a musical composition. It is around this time that "Baroque" begins to refer to buildings that were break- ing away from a strict adherence to the rules of ancient Greco-Roman architec- ture, such as the ones that appeared at the end of the sixteenth century in Italy, inspired by the work of the aging Michelangelo and his disciples. Neoclassicism considered this aesthetic distance to be a horrible failure of taste, whence comes the adjective baroque for describing distortions of Classical lines. Thus, in the Dictionnaire méthodique {The Dictionary of Methods, 1788), The Baroque in architecture carries a hint of the bizarre. ... It is, so to speak, refinement, or per- haps we could even say abuse. What severity is to good taste, the Baroque is to the bizarre. The idea of the Baroque brings with it the idea of ridiculousness indulged to excess.</page><page sequence="14">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE / 308 Influenced by the Neoclassical theoretician Johann Joachim Winckelmann, the Italian critic Milizia confirms in 1797 that the Baroque is the height of the bizarre, ridiculousness taken to the extreme (Borromini was delusional . . .). This connota- tion of abuse and excess is transformed in the nineteenth century into a connota- tion of decadence, thus endowing the word with a decidedly negative tone. Jakob Burkhardt, for example, uses the term "Baroque" in 1843 to talk about Counter Reformation architecture in Italy and Germany, and considers this period as the decline of the Renaissance. He uses the term rococo the same way and suggests that every period has its stage of decadence. This is the first step that the word baroque takes toward the idea of historical periodization, but the implication is that the Baroque is a time in between periods, a moment of (always) transitory eccentric- ity. Baroque thus becomes a link between historical paradigms. For this reason, until the Romantic period the word baroque had all sorts of divergent meanings, but it did not designate art forms. Only after the second half of the nineteenth century does the Baroque begin to accrue the idea of period- icity in art history, subsequently coming to describe all stages of cultural decline that put an end to a "great" period. Thus we find Nietzsche, who in his Human, All too Human (1878) adopts a cyclical idea of history, referring to the Baroque as a recurring phenomenon (a historical period that follows a renaissance) when artistic production declines and whose characteristics are rhetoric and theatri- cality. As a result, the Classical philosopher Wilamowitz-Moellendorf speaks of an "ancient Baroque" in relation to Hellenic art, while the art critic L. von Sybel discovers an ancient Roman Baroque. On the other hand, we have Heinrich Wölfflin's Hegelian ideas: with his 1888 essay Renaissance and Baroque, the revaluation of Baroque art begins - a revalua- tion that continues into our own times. Wölfflin's study is the first systematic attempt to apply the term to literature; he cites Ariosto's Orlando Furioso (1584) as an example of a "distinctive" Baroque art. In Tasso, Wölfflin finds the broad out- lines of the definition of Baroque art that he will develop in his 1915 Principles of Art History (to which I will return shortly) . We should also note several references near the end of the nineteenth century in Polish literary theory, and several applica- tions of the term "Baroque" to seventeenth-century literature in Spain and Italy. Beginning in the twentieth century, two trends in the use of the term "Baroque" in the arts appear. The first serves to designate a phenomenon recurring through- out history - that is, a literary trope or typology - while the second designates a specific phenomenon operating at a particular moment of history - that is, a his- torical trope or typology. The majority of post World War I critics tend toward the first usage. For German theorists and cultural historians Oswald Spengler, Wil- helm Worringer, and Oskar Walzel, the Baroque is a variety of the Gothic and Romanticism; Georg Weise thinks of it as late Gothic that escaped the influence of the Renaissance. We should also add Leo Spitzer to this list. And for Benedetto Croce, the Baroque is first of all a kind of aesthetic ugliness; Croce then leans toward the other meaning, calling the Baroque a perversion and locating it between the end of the sixteenth century and the beginning of the seventeenth (The History of the Baroque in Italy, 1929) . In 1927, the German Hispanist Helmut Hatzfeld speaks of the "Jesuit Baroque" and the Counter Reformation with respect to Cervantes, arguing that Spain is eternally Baroque and at the heart of the Baroque sensibility in Europe.</page><page sequence="15">THE (NEO) BAROQUE EFFECT / 309 And now we come to the Catalonian Eugenio d'Ors - Carpentier's "inspiration" - who is especially interesting since we find a pre-contemporary syncretism in his writings. A late neo-Romantic, d'Ors takes up Nietzsche's cyclical ideas and sees the Baroque as an aesthetic that appears in all historical periods. As a good Freudian Catholic, d'Ors feminizes the Baroque, finding in it the eternal femi- nine, who "never knows what she wants." He exclaims in his 1935 study entitled Lo barroco: The Baroque spirit, to put it bluntly once and for all, doesn't know what it wants. It wants both the yes and the no. Here are columns that want to fall and to fly, whose form is a paradox of the senses. I remember a certain large angel, in a certain side chapel of a certain church in Salamanca, who wants to raise its arm and lower its hand. It recedes and approaches in a spiral ... It laughs at the principle of contradiction. (74; ellipsis in the original) With d'Ors, strangely enough, the Baroque becomes synonymous with a never- ending quest for the lost paradise ("the beginning and end of History") - a quest for the masculine, full speed ahead in pursuit of the myth of the (betrayed) "noble savage." It is an adventure that, from Robinson Crusoe on, according to d'Ors, reap- pears in Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Bernardin de Saint Pierre, Chateaubriand, Uncle Toms Cabin, and even in Paul Gauguin's painting. He contrasts Rome/Classicism ("spirit of unity, an eternal ideal") with Babel/Baroque, "a diffuse spirit and style, an archetype of those polymorphous expressions in which we think we can see the presence of a common denominator - the secret revelation of a certain human element - more clearly every day" (35-36). In fact, the ontological idea of the Baroque in d'Ors allows for a huge fascistic recovery of history - a fascistic oper- ation that is barely hidden behind the idea of (reactionary) revolution and char- acterized by a cyclical persistence. Eugenio d'Ors stresses that "every revolution is at the same time a reaction and contains within it a nod to precedent." This allows him to build his famous scenario in which the Baroque style appears in twenty different ways. As for contemporary criticism, leaving aside general studies (such as those by Pierre Charpentrat, Claude-Gilbert Dubois, Marcel Raymond, and Victor Tapie, among many others), we see a flowering of examples that carelessly take up the term "(Neo) baroque" and all its variations in order to point to some modern aes- thetic trends amidst the general confusion. Thus, P.M. Albérès (alias René Marill) describes the French New Novel and neo-New Novel as Baroque or Neobaroque, and in the U.S.John Barth uses the term "Neobaroque" to talk about postmod- ernism, and the Canadian Margaret Atwood uses "Baroque realism" in a review of John Updike's latest novel. We are talking about a resurgence of interest, espe- cially in the last ten years, and it indicates a certain fascination, even an obsession, for everything that verges on the Baroque (examples: various colloquia, theses, the re-publication of texts from the seventeenth century, etc.). With Wölfflin and the revaluing of the Baroque, we can make an initial connec- tion to certain of Bakhtin's propositions, albeit differently from the ways in which Sarduy and de Campos understand the connection. Bakhtin articulates theoreti- cal foundations (anti-Lukâcsian for the most part, except perhaps for the idea of "totalization") that allow us to rethink the genre of the novel and, more spe- cifically, to find its origins squarely in the seventeenth century. In my view, this is</page><page sequence="16">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE / 310 because the idea of polyphony plays a fundamental theoretical role in describing the contemporary (Neo) baroque. Wölfflin is very much a Hegelian (whereas we should remember that, on the whole, Bakhtin is an anti-Hegelian). Wölfflin systematically contrasts the Baroque to Classicism in order to construct an idea of the Baroque as a separate and dis- tinct aesthetic. Wölfflin proposes five descriptive categories to illustrate this basic opposition: 1) a Classical conception of linearity that delineates objects / a Baroque conception of pictorial space that locates forms in relation to each other; 2) Classi- cal space that deploys its three dimensions in succeeding planes / vertical Baroque that calls for evasiveness and continuous space; 3) Classical closed structure in which subordination, exclusion, or connection reigns / Baroque open structure in which, by contrast, a collaborative element and a non-predetermined future inscribe themselves; 4) Classical unity imposed by an overriding superstructure / Baroque multiplicity created by the infrastructure; and 5) clarity and purity of Classical lines / darkness and a certain Baroque confusion. The essence of what Wölfflin proposes is that with the Baroque a multiplicity of viewpoints (a multi- plicity unknown to Classicism) begins. In other words, the Baroque offers several ways of thinking about a thing, a concept, or an idea, several ways in which the object (of artistic representation) can be defined. Thus we find a certain conceptual analogy between Wölfflin's Baroque and Bakhtin's literary polyphony. Wölfflin's system articulates the antithesis between Baroque multiplicity and Classical unity, and Bakhtin's system articulates, just as antithetically, the relation between polyphony and homophony; the polyphonic multiplicity of different discourses contrasts with the unique and deceptive "Truth" of monological discourse. Bakhtin insists that polyphony battles against an objec- tive definition of man, and makes thinking simultaneously about the world's diverse phenomena its aesthetic goal. Wölfflin's idea of the Baroque poses an essentially metaphysical question that rethinks the ontological and thereby redefines man: the single viewpoint becomes multiple as it is deplaced and decentered. Polyph- ony, in turn, accumulates several different points of view to endow the world with a prismatic multiplicity. What particularly interests us is the fact that, historically, the widely accepted idea of the Baroque as a historical period following Classicism coincides with the disappearance of the (Rabelaisian) novelistic genre that Bakhtin considers directly influenced by Carnival. At the end of the fifteenth century and throughout the sixteenth century, Carnival begins to lose its sociohistorical nature as a popular institution. So, it is precisely from the seventeenth century on that Bakhtin notices the emergence of polyphonic narrative elements in the Western novel. Don Quixote becomes the first novelistic example - certainly the most important - of some- thing that is no longer the "carnivalesque novel" strictly speaking, but not yet the "polyphonic novel." At a transitional moment in the history of the Western novel, Don Quixote responds to a functional deregulation that deconstructs hierarchies; recall, for example, the instances of Sancho's "quixotification" and Don Quixote's "sanchification" or, genealogically, the parody of traditional novels of chivalry, the picaresque novel, and even older pastoral literary modes. We see the strategies of an embryonic polyphonic multiplicity that nonetheless still derive from a decen- tered, carnivalesque world view. Like Carnival, which is limited by time and space, everything in Don Quixote is "resolved" and finds its correct place in the social hier- archy. Don Quixote reverts to his "true identity" - Alonso Quijano - recovers his</page><page sequence="17">THE (NEO) BAROQUE EFFECT / 311 single Truth, and dies a mere shadow of his former carnivalization. He accepts the idea that he is just a metaphor for authority and not authority itself; Don Quixote submits to divine authority and expires as he falls into the arms of the all-powerful churchmen. The habitual procedures of carnivalesque enthronement, which exist only in Don Quixote's space, and dethronement, when he becomes the ordinary Alsono Quijano again, persist in the new narrative genre. Thus polyphonic narrative embryos emerge from the carnivalesque and its transpositions into literature, which endow texts with "Baroque" (multiplicitous) status but not with a (Baroque) dynamism that would subsume the carnivalesque and pre-polyphonic world view. Recall once again that for Bakhtin "the carni- valesque" refers to the basic components of the Rabelasian fictional text, while "polyphony" emphasizes certain narratological features of the Dostoyevskian novel, which Bakhtin calls "polyphonic" and which takes shape at a point in the history of the novel that has long ceased to be directly influenced by popular man- ifestations of Carnival. On the contrary, Bakhtin never develops a relationship between Carnival and polyphony in his writings, but I believe that this relation- ship is fundamental. The lack of its theorization with respect to the seventeenth- century novel has provoked the confusion we find throughout literary theories addressing this topic today. Here we should stress the fact that carnivalization cannot be conflated with the "cannibal reason" that Haroldo de Campos speaks of. That would represent a major theoretical mistake. For Bakhtin, the carnivalesque view of the world never empties the discourse to which it refers and which it carnivalizes; there is neither exclusion nor "devouring." Quite the contrary, there is no rapprochement between the oppositions (of the official and the informal, to recall Bakhtin's terminol- ogy) such as is engendered by dialogic interaction, but just the simple effect of substitution. The carnivalesque vision is a totalizing world view that encompasses the totality of its diverse aspects, which are included within the possibility of difference. From this perspective, it is difficult to see Baroque modes functioning under the Bakhtinian rubric. The Baroque is the centralizing and absolutist European product of an economic, political, and socio-cultural context. Historically, the American colonies are exemplary instances of that sensibility being put into prac- tice. Studies that try to find a true sense of the "Baroque" sensibility in the autoch- thonous and pre-Colombian arts, for example, are proceeding, despite themselves, in a neocolonizing spirit - a spirit inherited from the conquistador who always judges from his own (European) perspective and imposes his own criteria and methods. The problem becomes decidedly more complex if we accept a priori the hypo- thetical idea of a contemporary (Neo) baroque. In this respect, putting aside Car- pentier's tautological (and cyclical) conception and Haroldo de Campos's "can- nibal" propositions, Sarduy's vision can only be explained in psychoanalytic terms. If his definition of the Baroque refers to a kind of ontological break, but a break still anchored in the sociopolitical reality of the times (the polarization of per- spective between divine authority and its earthly metaphor, divine monarchy), his Neobaroque, on the other hand, becomes perfectly ahistorical by defining itself as an "internal" kind of para-schitzoid break, built on a problematics of the (Lacanian) unconscious and linked to a Nietzschean metaphysics - the terrified gaze of the "(super-) Ego" as the structural mirroring of a desire that cannot (any</page><page sequence="18">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE / 312 longer) achieve its object. The common denominator among these three theoreti- cal designs, taken as representative of the majority of contemporary ideas of the (Neo) baroque, is to look desperately for one or another of the alternative modes that precede contemporary history: that "Other." The absence of the prefix "neo" in Carpentier, de Campos's complete fusion of the Baroque and the Neobaroque, and Sarduy's lack of taxonomic definition prevent from the outset even the mere hypothesis of a historically precise contemporary (Neo) baroque. This situation leads me to propose a terminological and conceptual hypothe- sis. The Baroque as such has evolved; it refers to a historically precise period that is not our own. The terms "Baroque" and "Neobaroque" cannot simply be juxta- posed in their definitions, their objects, or their functions. All of their elements must be recontextualized inside a historical continuum. Here, we should address the constitution of the term. In any compound word, the prefix generally connotes a revival of the word it is attached to. In his thesis The Political and Social Vocabulary in France from 1869 to 1872, the grammarian Jean Dubois deepens the analysis of the system of prefixes. Thus, he emphasizes that the role of the prefix is especially well suited to translating the dynamic relationships that characterize social and politi- cal structures The system of prefixes owes its privileged place in political vocabulary to the very nature of writing, which explains the system's historical permanence since the eighteenth century. Better than the simple or suffixed term, the prefixed word can express a fundamental relationship, since the root word, the signifier, keeps its morphological appearance; the semantic content is understood right away. (140) Jean Dubois established a chart of prefixes in written and spoken discourses in France (between 1869 and 1872) in which the use of "neo-" implies a sense of modernization; likewise, he points out that words constructed with "neo-" hardly ever appear before the eighteenth century. After that period, certain compound words appear, above all in the form of borrowings from the Greek - for exam- ple, neologue (1726), neologism (1735), neographism (1740); they had the effect of vulgarizing the term, without however entering the pre-1789 Revolutionary political vocabulary. While in religious and philosophical vocabulary a few words appeared accompanied by a hyphen - neo-Catholicism (1833), neo-platonism (1842) - socialist writings from 1930 to 1848, for example, still ignore the use of this kind of composite words. He adds that Neo signals not only a new ideology, but also a link with the past that is thereby renewed: it is thus perfectly suited to philosophical vocabulary, for qualifying ideologies in which tradition and origi- nal thought merge. (156) It is not until the Second Empire that this prefix enters political discourse, and only then does "neo" extend into social usage and spelling. In our articulation of the term, I would like not to break the link between past and present to which Dubois alludes, inasmuch as the sense of polyphony would inhere in the prefix "neo" and determine the nature of the contemporary Baroque. More precisely, "neo" would renew the root word Baroque. Polyphony is what specifies synchronically the diachronic (historical) component of Baroque in the compound word, and hence places the term "neo (-) baroque" in a contempo- rary context, its polyphony producing the morphological overdetermination of the term.</page><page sequence="19">THE (NEO) BAROQUE EFFECT / 313 Nevertheless, there remain two relatively complex theoretical points, the first generating the second. First, one must note a semantic change when a word with a prefix lacks a hyphen. According to Dubois, A word affected by another sign theoretically assumes the existence of a word that is not affected by the sign. I say theoretically because it happens that the prefixed term ceases to have an exact and direct relationship to the non-prefixed term, and that the distinction between the two words has a tendency to disintegrate. The compound word thus acquires a limited lexical autonomy, its content is essentially no longer expressed by a relationship, but turns out to be more complex and difficult to analyze; the hyphen often disappears. (140) He gives as an example the word anticlerical, which appears at the end of the Second Empire when the attitude of the clergy, which favored the imperial regime, provoked the hostility of the republican opposition. Dubois makes a distinction that seems important to me: "the shift to lexical autonomy is fully accomplished when deriva- tions are developed from the compound word. 'Anticlericalism' would thus be derived from 'anticlerical/ and not made up of anti- and 'clericalism'" (Dubois, 141). Thus it is with reference to this kind of lexical autonomy in relation to the term Baroque that I am proposing the spelling Neobaroque, without parentheses or hyphen, to indicate that the term refers to the present. Neobaroque doesn't indi- cate an effect that derives from a previous model, in which the prefix "neo" would signal only a historical posteriority or a psychoanalytic regression. A hypothesis of the Neobaroque shouldn't be limited to modernizing, to "neo"-baroquizing the original model of the Baroque, or to beginning a sporadic but eternal Baroque afresh, or to repeating it (cyclically or tautologically) . The term "Neobaroque" can only be built according to the blueprint of the historical development that pro- duced it. Thus we may contrast the overarching modes of Baroque tension and dis- tension to Neobaroque distortion and contortion in an attempt to draw distinctions that will enable us to define particular contemporary aesthetic styles. The tension of the institutional Baroque is the result of carnivalesque decenter- ing already deprived of its popular character. It is the viewpoint between the poles of divine authority and its worldly metaphor of the king: anthropomorphism, yes, but where worldly authority can be only a mere approximation of divine authority. The Baroque didacticism that we see in Don Quixote is that if man is made in God's image, he can only be a flawed representation of Him; he can never be the exact image o/God, so a tension results from a forbidden relationship, an "irregular" relationship (such as an imperfectly round pearl). There follows a kind of trompe l'oeil, or deception, which is the stretching that results from the Baroque aes- thetic acting on the Classical; it endows the latter with the appearance of volume and the illusion of depth, just as the different sensibilities of embryonic polyphonic discourse in the seventeenth century (still close to the carnivalesque vision) broke up monological discourse. Neobaroque distortion, on the other hand, designates the inordinate accumula- tion to which the polyphonic multiplicity that Bakhtin talks about in Dostoyevsky's novels is often subjected. It is a question of distortion in the literal sense of the word, for instance, a defect of photographic equipment that provides an image that dif- fers from the object, or the defect of a radio receiver that emits a sound that doesn't correspond to the sound transmitted. I am thinking of the kind of contempo- rary "polyphonic grimace" that makes use of the narrative techniques proposed by Bakhtin in order to warp and mutilate them - contortions, exaggerated posi- tions, parody, of course, and sometimes caricature. All of this means that there</page><page sequence="20">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE / 314 is something in polyphonic (un) reasonableness that tends to reduce carnival- ization to the absurd. So history always bears the marks of its past, and so the old meaning of syllogism contained in the word Baroque still plays a part (albeit a very small one) today. This is true to the extent that, as I've already mentioned, polyphony appears as a component of the novel just at the point when Carnival is losing its popular meaning and becoming part of the royal festive culture of masked balls and military parades, before later undergoing a true folklorization. And, finally, there is also a purely economic aspect to the concept of the Neo- baroque: we talk about "distortion" with respect to the tension resulting from a disequilibrium between two economic systems. Neobaroque, then, also reflects the old sense of Baroque {barocco) as something that originates in a harmful finan- cial transaction, and that today refers to the kind of aesthetic overdetermination that characterizes the contemporary novel: an exaggerated aestheticism through which a whole sector of current narrative economy reduces Bakhtin's dialogism to the status of pure narrative functionality under the guise of polyphony. One might articulate a theory of contemporary aesthetic economy, as I've sketched it briefly elsewhere, in terms of surplus theory with respect to the system of interest-bearing capital (see "Anamorphose"). How can I resist quoting Sor Juana's magnificent (and quintessentially Baroque) poem: Este, que ves, erigano colorido, que del arte ostentando los primores, con falsos silogismos de colores es cauteloso engano del sentido: este, en quien la lisonja ha pretendido excusar de los anos los horrores y venciendo del tiempo los rigores triunfar de la vejez y del olvido, es un vano artificio del cuidado, es una flor al viento delicada, es un resguardo inutil para el hado: es una necia diligencia errada, es un afan caduco, y, bien mirado, es cadaver, es polvo, es sombra, es nada. (134) This that you gaze on, colorful deceit, Art's Beauty and its skill exhibiting, With syllogisms false of coloring Is for the senses quite a crafty cheat; This, in which flattery always discreet Has tried to excuse the years so harrowing, And of time all the rigors conquering, Thus old age and oblivion to defeat, Is but care's artifice of vanity, Is fragile flower that the winds distress, Is futile ploy to counter destiny, Is foolish and mistaken eagerness, Is faded zeal, and as all can well see, Is corpse, is dust, is shade, is nothingness.

Cobb from The Sonnets ofSorJuana Ines de la Cruz in English Verse (Lewiston: Edwin Meilen Press, 2001) and reprinted by permission of Edwin Meilen Press.- EDS.</page><page sequence="21">THE (NEO) BAROQUE EFFECT / 315 Naturally, it is impossible to draw conclusions from a study that engages all sorts of applications and verifications as it proceeds to apply its ideas. This is simply an initial attempt at clarifying a few aspects of a complex and, in some ways, ideo- logical problem. Such a clarification might eventually lead to a rereading of the contemporary novel. University of Warsaw Works Cited Barroso Vili, Juan. Realismo màgico y lo real maravilloso.
