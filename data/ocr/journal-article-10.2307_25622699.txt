The discovery of similar objects at the ancient harbor of Zea, and more recently in association with a Classical Greek ship wrecked off the Aegean coast of Turkey, makes clear that all are examples of the eyes that decorated the bows of ancient Greek ships. Three hypotheses are offered to explain the presence of nautical artifacts within the Agora: they may have served as honorific fixtures relating to the fleet; represented surplus naval equipment stored in the Strategeion; or belonged to a wheeled ship used in the Anthesteria or the Greater Panathenaia festival. SHIPS' EYES FROM THE ATHENIAN AGORA Fragments of three sculpted marble eyes, or ophthalmoi, have been dis covered in the course of excavations at the Athenian Agora.1 The first was found during the spring of 1938, when archaeologists working along the western edge of the Agora explored one of two wells associated with Building F, a large Archaic structure that preceded the circular Tholos constructed after the Persian sack of Athens in 480 B.C. Unlike many of the wells in the Agora, which are carved into the natural bedrock, this one had been carefully walled with small fieldstones that continued to the very bottom of the well, to a depth of over 9 m.2 The bottom third of the well contained ceramic vessels, lamps, and figurines that suggested that the well had been in use during the first decades of the 5th century B.C., while the 1.1 extend my appreciation to John Camp, director of the Agora Excava tions, American School of Classical Studies at Athens, for his permission and encouragement to present the three Agora fragments included here, as well as to George Bass, director of the Tektas Burnu shipwreck excavation. I am grateful to Camp, Kathleen Lynch, and Susan Rotroff, whose comments on earlier versions of this paper resulted in several key improvements. Sylvie Dumont, Marcie Handler, and Jan Jordan helped to facilitate my research on the Agora fragments; Carrie Atkins and Alexis Catsambis assisted in countless other ways. I also thank the anonymous Hesperia referees for their detailed and very constructive remarks. 2. Well G 11:3. See Thompson 1940, p. 25; Camp 1977, pp. 175-182. ?

Photo ^^^^^BM^f courtesy American School of Classical ~^*W Studies at Athens, Agora Excavations upper two-thirds contained an earthen fill interspersed throughout with stones and fragments of ceramic pithoi, millstones, and querns. One of the marble objects retrieved from this fill is a large sculpted eye (1), broken at both ends but still about 60% complete, finished with a low raised border around the edges and a round hole through the center (Fig. 1). Black-figure potsherds and fragmentary roof tiles belonging to the Tholos and found near the mouth of the well indicate that it was closed at the same time the Tholos was nearing completion, ca. 475-465 B.C.3 A second fragmentary marble eye (2), comparable in size but less well preserved than the first, was excavated in another well to the southeast of the Tholos (Fig. 2). Opened about 50 years after the Tholos was completed, this well had been dug to a depth of 12 m.4 The mouth of this well was capped with two courses of poros blocks, but, unlike the well associated with Building F, the well shaft was left unlined, and before too long the walls collapsed and the well became unusable. The collapse of the well walls created a small pit at the surface that served in the short term as a dump for a large quantity of burned roof tiles, millstones, and broken pottery dating from the last decades of the 5th century. This deposit, character ized by the excavator, Homer Thompson, as a kitchen dump, appears to have been the result of a fire that damaged or destroyed the Tholos near the end of the 5th century. Finally, in 2007, pieces of a third eye (3) were discovered in a 5th century context approximately 20 m southwest of the Tholos (Fig. 3). 1 Marble eye fragment Fig. 1 Agora A 3811.

SHIPS' EYES AT ZEA HARBOR The identification of the three Agora marbles as fragments of sculpted ophthalmoi was facilitated by the discovery, almost 60 years earlier, of nu merous intact and incomplete examples from the Athenian harbor town of Piraeus (Fig. 4). News of the find was first reported in 1880 by H. G.

In 1885, as excavation of the northeastern part of Zea harbor con tinued, archaeologists exposed the remains of 10 low sloping slipways with columnar partitions (Fig. 7) that suggested a series of roofed sheds, presumably designed to cover and protect the renowned Athenian war galleys.9 The Zea shipsheds thus provided some of the earliest direct evidence for this important naval feature,10 as well as indirect evidence for the actual dimensions of ancient warships. In 1898, Dragatses unearthed a portion of yet another marble ophthalmos^ apparently now lost,12 but by that time the maritime context of the Zea marble eyes seemed assured. In various locations around Piraeus and Athens, a series of inscribed marble slabs have been found that document the provisioning and supervi sion of hundreds of ships and naval equipment. These stelai, published in the second and third quarters of the 4th century B.C., are often described collectively as the tabulae curatorum navalium, or the Piraeus Naval Inven tories.13 Some of the inscriptions serve as an inventory of naval gear, divided broadly into two types: wooden (rowing oars, steering oars, masts, ladders, poles) and hanging (sails, ropes, screens, anchors, oar port covers).14 Other inventories provide detailed information about the ships themselves, including their class, name, location, and condi tion; in several cases, a ship s ophthalmoi are described as either broken15 or missing.16 The logical inference, then, is that the marble eyes un covered at Zea in the late 19th century are pieces of naval equipment likely to have been stored with lines, rigging, and other gear in a nearby warehouse.</page><page sequence="8">354 DEBORAH N.

BURNU WRECK The recent excavation of a Classical Greek merchant ship wrecked off the Aegean coast of Turkey atTekta? Burnu provides the first clear evidence for ophthalmoi in association with an actual ancient ship (Fig. 8). The Tekta? Burnu vessel, which probably sank between 440 and 425 B.C., was a small and probably local trader carrying a mixed cargo of East Greek pottery, pine tar, and wine contained in amphoras produced at nearby Erythrai.17 During the first excavation season in 1999, archaeologists uncovered a white marble disk (11), about 14 cm in diameter, pierced through the center by a large lead spike (Fig. 9).18 As on the Zea ophthalmoi, the outer face is convex and incised with concentric lines, while the back?which would have rested against the ship s wooden hull?is flat and roughly worked. Within the incised lines are the faded remnants of a dark painted ring that indicates the outermost edge of the iris, while the flattened head of the lead fastener, at center, is reminiscent of the eyes pupil. A second ophthalmos (12, Fig. 10) was found the following season, at a distance of little more than a meter from the first, suggesting that 17. Bass 2002; Carlson 2003.

May, courtesy Institute of Nautical Archaeology after the ship had sunk, its wooden planks were quickly consumed by shipworms, leaving behind only the marble ophthalmoi and the fasten ers that once held them in place. The near-total disappearance of the ship's hull over the course of two and a half millennia means that the two marble eyes provide some of the only direct evidence for the location of the bow and the vessel's orientation on the seabed. Furthermore, the intact lead spike penetrating the center of 11 was encrusted with marine growth along the length of its shaft; the only portion relatively free of marine concretion was an area 2.5 cm long directly behind the marble eye, which should correspond to the thickness of the ship's vanished hull planking. 11 Intact marble eye Fig. 9 TK 007.

EVOLUTION AND FUNCTION OF SHIPS' EYES The ancient Greek tradition of endowing a ship with eyes dates back at least to the Late Bronze Age, as indicated by a painted terracotta boat model, 12 cm in length, excavated in the settlement at Phylakopi on the island of Melos.21 Far more plentiful are the depictions of eyed warships featured on Attic black-figure vases of the 6th century B.C.22 In these examples, the ram?the primary offensive weapon of an ancient galley? takes on the menacing appearance of a wild boar, suggesting that the resemblance between an attacking warship and a charging animal was not lost on the ancient Greeks. This association between boar and ship's ram is also a central feature of Archaic silver coins from Phaselis, which show the forepart of a boar, complete with front legs pulled in close to the head as if in pursuit, in the guise of what is clearly intended to be a ships prow (Fig. II).23 While the evidence suggests that the eyes associated with a ship's ram were feral in nature, other Archaic vase paintings indicate that some ships were also decorated with larger, more prominent ophthalmot on either side of the partition where the forward lookout (prorates) was stationed (Fig. 12); the Zea marble eyes are likely to be examples of these adornments. Despite numerous technical similarities in the surface treatment of the ships' eyes from Tekta? Burnu and Zea, the differences in their shape and size are both obvious and important. Circular ophthalmot like the pair excavated at Tektas Burnu appear on a handful of Archaic Greek vases (Fig. 13).24 The present corpus of depictions is too small to permit definitive conclusions, but it seems to imply that merchant ships routinely carried circular eyes, while oared galleys were equipped with larger, more naturalistically rendered ophthalmoi. The discrepancy in size between the modest ophthalmoi of the Tekta? Burnu ship and the larger, more robust eyes from Athens may simply be a matter of proportion: the Tektas. Burnu ship was probably not more than about 12 m long, whereas a trireme?the Classical Greek ship of the line?must have measured about three times that length.25 The iconographic and archaeological evidence seems sufficient to conclude that Archaic and Classical ships, especially oared galleys, were routinely portrayed with eyes at the bow. The tradition, however, was not uniquely Greek; Aeschylus describes the Persian ships that gathered off the</page><page sequence="12">358 DEBORAH N. CARLSON IV 1 . . .. ..... . . . . . . . . . ....... coast of Salamis in 480 B.C. as linen-winged and dark-eyed.26 And Danaos recognizes the fleet of vessels approaching Argos as Egyptian owing in part to the eyes painted on the prow.27 To be sure, in some cases, ophthalmoi were painted on a ships wooden hull using either an admixture of wax and pitch or tinted wax in an encaustic technique.28 Pliny the Elder reports that many of the Hellenistic worlds most accomplished painters, such as Protogenes of Kaunos and Heraklides of Macedon, began their careers as ship-painters.29 It is conspicuous, however, that the only marble specimens of ships' eyes to have survived from the ancient world all hail from Greek contexts. Even within the modest corpus of a dozen examples presented here, it is possible to discern a stylistic evolution from the rigid Archaic angularity of Agora eye 1 toward the more naturalistic and supple Clas sical curves of Zea eye 4.30 The remnants of five concentric painted rings, colored red, yellow, and possibly blue on the Berlin eye 10, are particularly interesting in light of the recent discovery of red and blue pigments in the Classical shipsheds of Sicilian Naxos.31 As a motif, eyes appear on everything in ancient Greece from coins to cups to shields to amphora stamps; while it is not within the scope of this article to account for these many manifestations,32 it is appropriate Figure 12.

Pliny (HN35.31.49) suggests that the practice of eye-painting origi nated on warships and was subse quentiy applied to merchant vessels; perhaps we should imagine a similar evolution among the ancient Greeks? 31.

Photo cour tesy Museum Meermanno-Westreenianum to question the symbolic motivation for endowing a ship with eyes. Conventional explanations typically conclude that ships' eyes were either apotropaic or anthropomorphic in nature, as there is evidence to support both interpretations.33 Apotropaic eyes, like the Gorgoneion, served a protective function by warding off the ill effects of the evil eye.34 In this capacity, it is noteworthy that the marble ophthalmot under discussion stare directly outward, not ahead in the direction of a traveling ship, and their pupils are often painted with concentric circles reminiscent of a mask.35 An anthropomorphic function endows the ship with a spirit capable of seeing the sea, and the accounts of Aeschylus and Philostratos suggest that the ancient Greeks did indeed believe that ships' eyes behaved in this way.36 THE CONTEXT OF THE AGORA EYES The two marble ophthalmot fromTekta? Burnu and the 11 examples from Zea harbor come from decidedly nautical contexts, but the same cannot be said of the three fragments from the Athenian Agora. Two of these were retrieved from wells adjacent to the Tholos, a circular building where the 50 prytaneisy the executive officers of the Boule, convened and dined, and where a smaller number slept in the event that they were needed to respond to a state emergency.37 But inasmuch as the earlier of the two fragments 33.

CARLSON was associated with debris deposited during the initial construction of the Tholos ca. 470 B.C., it must have belonged to a different, earlier structure. An obvious but problematic prospect is Building F, an Archaic structure of irregular plan that may have served as the private residence of the Pei sistratid tyrants.38 Another candidate in the immediate vicinity is the (Old) Bouleuterion, or council house, probably constructed at the very end of the 6th cen tury B.C.39 It was the council (Boule) that presided over state naval matters, including the construction and maintenance of warships, their equipment, and the shipsheds, as well as the supervision of hundreds of trierarchs.40 Bouleutic decrees concerning naval affairs were enforced by the dockyard officers (epimeletai neorion), who published the naval inventories discovered in the Piraeus.41 Fragments of similar stelai, representing at least three additional mid-4th-century inscriptions, have been found in the Agora. Some of these appear to duplicate the Piraeus inventories, while at least one fragment actually joins them, though none makes mention of ships' eyes.42 All of the fragments were either reused in modern construction or come from unstratified or otherwise disturbed contexts; two, however, were retrieved from fill west of the Metroon, a sanctuary dedicated to the Mother of the Gods. With the construction of a New Bouleuterion in the late 5th century came the conversion of the Old Bouleuterion to the Metroon, which functioned primarily as an archive for state documents of which these naval inventories may have formed a part.43 Regrettably, we will probably never know exactly where or how (or even if) the Agora ophthalmoi were displayed. Were they intended to serve as a visual reminder of one of the Boule s many civic responsibilities, or did they commemorate a specific historical event, as did the bronze shields taken from the Spartans at Pylos in 425 B.C. and exhibited for centuries in the Stoa Poikile?44 Chrysoula Saatsoglou-Paliadeli conjectured that the marble eyes from Zea may have been inlaid into flat wooden frames painted to mimic a ship's hull, which were then erected as dedications by the trierarchs.45 In this vein, it is worth noting that the votive dedication of naval equipment is a conspicuous and persistent phenomenon in the ancient world, represented by everything from anchor stocks to naming 38. Thompson 1940; Shear 1978; Camp 1986, pp. 44-45.

Schweigert (1939, pp. 17-25) understood the five fragments to be a slightly altered copy of IG IP 1611; Laing (1968) showed that one Agora fragment (I 5419) clearly joins two of the Piraeus inscriptions (IG IP 1628 and 1630). Shear (1995, p. 180) rightly asserts that "the discovery of naval inventory fragments in the Agora does not require that the fragments be copies of those in Piraeus," but she fails to concede that a single join among those fragments does not rule out the possibility of duplicate inscriptions; for the moment, the issue is best left open for discussion. 43.

Because little of the actual building has survived, its identification is based on the descriptive testimonia of ancient authors, as well as several Hellenistic inscriptions found nearby, which were intended to be set up in front of the Strategeion.50 A late-4th-century B.C. inscription found on the Acropolis records the transfer to the strategoi of certain hanging gear (ropes, screens, sails) for deposition in the Strategeion.51 Although ophthalmoi are not included in this or other lists of similar equipment, the inscription does provide a possible justification for interpreting the eye fragments as remnants of naval gear stored in the Agora. This interpretation, however, ultimately hinges upon the identity of the structure long referred to as the Strategeion. Renewed excavation of this area suggests that the character of the building was more commercial than civic; recent finds include transport amphoras and a hoard of almost 400 silver tetradrachms that appear to be virtually contemporaneous with the aforementioned Acropolis inscription.52 Yet another interpretation of the Zea ophthalmoi comes from Mat thias Steinhart, who has proposed that the eyes may have belonged to a ship of a different kind?the ship-chariot of Dionysos.The ship-chariot is traditionally associated with the Anthesteria, a three-day spring festival in which the Greeks honored Dionysos by opening and sampling the season's newest vintage.53 Although we have no written accounts of the god's annual return to Athens,54 several late-6th- or early-5th-century Attic black-figure vase paintings show him being conveyed in a wheeled ship.55 The obvious implication of the ship-chariot is that the procession to the god's sanctuary in the marshes originated in a seaport, which was doubly significant as the festival is likely to have coincided with the opening of the sailing season. While a cache of 11 marble eyes seems excessive for a single ship chariot, Steinhart s hypothesis gives us good reason to evaluate the Agora ophthalmoi against the evidence for a similar ritual vehicle, the Panathenaic 46.

Like its Dionysian counterpart at the Anthesteria, this wheeled ship was a main attraction at the Greater Panathenaia festival held in late sum mer every four years, when the Athenians presented their patron goddess Athena Polias with a newly woven woolen peplos carried on the mast like a hoisted sail.56 While scholars do not agree on the antiquity of the ship-cart as a feature of the festival,57 there is general consensus that the processional route originated in the Kerameikos and continued along the Panathenaic Way through the Agora and ultimately up to the Acropolis. The wheeled ship, however, was undoubtedly not well suited for the final steep ascent through the Propylaia and onward to the sacrificial altar, and as such was apparently moored elsewhere.58 Comparable vehicles are depicted on two fragmentary sculptural reliefs from Athens, though neither is sufficiently well preserved to indicate the presence of an ophthalmos.59 Nevertheless, the fact that the ship-cart passed through the Agora along the Panathenaic Way is assured, and provides yet another possible explanation for the discovery of the three fragmentary marble ophthalmoi found there. CONCLUSIONS The excavation of two circular marble ophthalmoi from the 5th-century B.C. shipwreck at Tektas, Burnu provides undeniable proof that the ships' eyes depicted on many Archaic and Classical Greek vases were in some cases three-dimensional sculpted objects and not superficial paintings. Further more, the discovery confirms the accuracy of several illustrations that sug gest that merchant ships (such as the wreck atTektas Burnu) were equipped with circular eyes, while more anthropomorphic, almond-shaped eyes were reserved for warships. More than a dozen examples of the latter type have been found in the port and marketplace of ancient Athens and are thus certainly to be regarded as ships' eyes,60 which prompts the question: What was naval material doing in the center of Athens? Taking into consideration the provenience and date of the three marble eye fragments from the Athenian Agora, I have proposed three hypotheses 56. IG IP 3198; Philostr. VS 2.1.5. Modern bibliography on the topic is vast, but see especially Davison 1958; Simon 1983, pp. 55-72; Mansfield 1985; Neils 1992; Shear 2001; Parker 2005, pp. 253-269. 57. E.g., Robertson (1985, p. 294) argues that the Panathenaic ship predated and "supplied the pattern" for the ship-cart of Dionysos. Barber (1992, p. 114) suggests that the pro cessional phenomenon was a direct and logical development (and celebration) of the Greek victory over the Persians at Salamis. Norman (1983, p. 44) sees the Panathenaic ship as a Hellenistic innovation, judging it "extremely unlikely that the ship could have existed and been part of the procession from the inception of the festival ritual, sometime in the sixth century B.C., and have escaped all notice in literature, art and other documents until the third century B.C." 58. According to Pausanias (1.29.1), the ship was moored near the Areo pagos, while Philostratos (VS 2.1.7) recounts that the ship, equipped with 1,000 rowers, circled the Eleusinion, passed the Pelasgikon and the Pythion, and was displayed nearby. For discus sion and interpretation of the Philo stratos account, see Gardner 1914; Wycherley 1963;Tobin 1993; Welch 1998, pp. 138-145. A terminus in either locale would explain why the ship does not appear on the Parthenon frieze depicting the final procession to the Acropolis (Rotroff 1977; Norman 1983). 59. In the 2nd- or 3rd-century sculpted relief built into the Byzantine church of Ayios Eleutherios, a cross was carved over the ship, obliterating any potentially diagnostic details. For an earlier fragment from the area of the Eleusinion showing what appears to be the stern of a ship-cart, see Spetsieri Choremi 2000. 60. Contra Assmann (1888, p. 1613), who judged the Zea marble ophthalmoi to be too small, too thin, and of unsuit able material to have served as ships' eyes.</page><page sequence="17">SHIPS' EYES IN CLASSICAL GREECE 363 for the function of the ophthalmoi. The eyes may have been honorific, af fixed either to a commemorative monument possibly erected by one or more trierarchs, or to a structure (the Bouleuterion?) that highlighted the Boule's civic duty as custodians of the fleet, Athens' most illustrious and awesome asset. Like the marble ophthalmoi, fragments of inscribed stelai documenting the naval activities of the Boule have been found in both the Piraeus and the Agora, which appear to constitute two major spheres of bouleutic activity as far as the fleet was concerned. An equally plausible theory is that the eyes represent the remains of surplus naval equipment surrendered to the strategoi and stored in the Strategeion. There is little in the existing naval lists, however, to suggest that ophthalmoi were routinely classified with other pieces of a ship's gear; rather they appear to have been treated as permanent fixtures of the ship itself. Equally ambiguous is the true character of the supposed Strategeion; inscriptions and other more recent finds suggest that the building's real identity may continue to elude us for some time. Finally, a third and more remote possibility is that the Agora eyes once belonged to a ritual wheeled ship of the type featured in the Anthesteria and the Greater Panathenaia festivals. Although the origin, destination, and antiquity of each festival's procession were distinctive, both followed a route along the Panathenaic Way through the Agora. As a result, neither can be ruled out as a possible source of the three fragmentary marble ophthalmoi found there over the course of 75 years of excavation.
