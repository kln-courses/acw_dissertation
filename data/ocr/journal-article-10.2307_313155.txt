By extension, the new borders created in 1947 are often thought of as incision scars.2 At first sight, it seems unremarkable that this surgical imagery has been so central to the way in which the process of partition has been represented. It is consistent with the British portrayal of their position in these events as one of clinical detachment. It also complements the anthropomorphic conception of the nation (as mother) that was evoked so often in Indian nationalist discourse. From the standpoint of the independent Indian state, moreover, it is easy to see why it has been convenient to depict Pakistan as a diseased limb that had to be sacrificed for the health of the national body-politic. The surgical analogy is, however, as misleading as it is vivid. For one, the deployment of medical phraseology has lent weight to the impression that partition was a necessary part of a process of heal- ing: that it was a surgical solution to the communal disease. Fifty years on, however, it is clear that partition has not cured the sub- An early version of the first part of this article was presented (in absentia) at the South Asian Studies Conference in Copenhagen in August 1996. The author is grateful for comments on that paper, as also for the critical suggestions (on this one) made by Tanika Sarkar, Anil Seal and Samita Sen. 2 Medical and surgical analogies have been used to describe partition ever since 1947. In fact, Jinnah first spoke of it thus in a meeting with Mountbatten in April 1947: 'It would have to be a surgical operation.' (Mountbatten replied, 'An anaes- thetic is required before the operation.') Alan Campbell-Johnson, Mission with Mountbatten (London (1951), 1985), p. 57. In 1969, Hodson described partition as 'a period of dissection', another variation on the surgical theme. See H. V. Hodson, The Great Divide: Britain-India-Pakistan (Karachi (1969), 1993), PP- 322-55. It was also very common to talk of communal violence as 'blood-letting', another expres- sion that harks back to an earlier era of medicine.

The surgical metaphor suggests, further- more, that partition was something that was done in India: that she was the passive object of the surgeon's knife and therefore not responsible for the act or its consequences. This has accorded well with the nationalist version of partition, which has been content to hold the British policy of divide and rule (and Jinnah's collusion with it) responsible for the events of 1947. Recent research has shown, however, that India's nationalist leaders were actively involved in the partition and their agency and culpability in the tragic events of 1947 is increasingly coming to be recognized. But there are other implications of thinking of partition in this way, some of which have not seriously been questioned. One outcome has been the tendency to view partition as a single, definitive act, a clean-cut vivisection that was executed-with clinical precision-in a single stroke. By 17 August 1947, when Radcliffe announced his Award, the operation is thought to have been concluded, all loose ends tied up. But in fact, as we shall see, partition was a messy, long-drawn-out process. It was in no sense finally or tidily concluded in August 1947; indeed, one could argue that the process had just begun, and that it is still unfinished today. The surgical metaphor has also supported the idea that the actual business of drawing the borderline was a technical affair informed by detailed specialist knowledge, just as the work of a surgeon is based upon specialist scientific knowledge. This could hardly contrast more sharply with the facts. Sir Cyril Radcliffe, author of the Bound- ary Awards, was a rank outsider to India. He had no background in Indian administration, nor did he have any prior experience of adjudicating disputes of this sort.3 If his appointment to the position of Chairman of the Boundary Commissions did not generate contro- versy it was because it was a tradition in British Indian civil adminis- 3 Sir (later Viscount) CyrilJohn Radcliffe (1899-1977) was, by 1938, 'the out- standing figure at the Chancery bar'. His 'meteorical [sic] legal career' was inter- rupted only by the Second World War, when he joined the Ministry of Information, becoming its director-general in 1941. This had been his only experience of admin- istration when, in 1947, he was called upon to chair the boundary commissions in India. Subsequently, however, he chaired so many public enquiries in Britain that one critic was led to denounce 'Government by Radcliffery'! Lord Blake and C. S.

Those who 'implemented' partition may have been, in their own eyes, disinterested professionals who simply carried out their orders to the best of their ability, who did their job in the best traditions of administrative professionalism-rationally, carefully and deliber- ately, without fear or favour.5 Because they regarded themselves as non-partisan, it has been assumed that the process by which they partitioned India was apolitical. This assumption has bolstered the prevailing impression that while politics informed the decision to divide India, politics and politicians had little bearing on the execu- tion of partition. Chronologically speaking, 3 June 1947, the date of Mountbatten's partition plan, is assumed to be a dividing line. Before 3 June, politicians are known to have jockeyed to influence the terms of partition and the transfer of power. After 3 June, the bureaucrats are believed to have taken over. As a result of this, historians of partition, all of whom have been interested in the political rather than the administrative issues involved, have tended to end their stories with the 3 June plan. Few have ventured beyond this date. Yet the moment one crosses this Rubicon, the picture that emerges could hardly be more complicated. The politics and admin- sitration of partition prove to have been too intricately intermeshed to be separated neatly into mutually exclusive domains. Political con- cerns were in play at every stage and at all levels of the very pro- tracted process of partition. The object of this article is to unravel some of these complexities by looking at the making of the borderline between West Benegal 4 In his discussion of the Indian Civil Service tradition, Potter observes that 'the whole structure of the Raj celebrated generalist control and continuity, not special- ist expertise and innovation'.

The first part looks at the Bengal border from the top down, at the actual mapping out of the Radcliffe line through Bengal. It asks how and why this line came to take the precise shape that it did, by investigating the Boundary Commission and its procedures. The second part looks closely at the Bengal border itself, as viewed from the ground. How did a line drawn on a map become a tangible geopolitical reality? How was it institutionalized and administered? How was it given legitimacy? How did it affect the people who lived in its vicinity? How, in other words, did it work? The particular emphasis, dictated chiefly by the availability of source materials, is on West Bengal's experience. I The 3 June Statement Before we begin to look at this process, it is worth recalling that certain significant political choices on the form that partition would take had been written into the 3 June Plan itself. Though apparently leaving the entire question of partition open, the Plan delimited the parameters within which a division could take place. According to the Plan, the Bengal Legislative Assembly was to divide itself into two parts, one consisting of the representatives of Muslim-majority districts and the other of the Hindu-majority districts. Each assembly was to meet separately to ascertain whether the majority of its mem- bers wished to partition their province. In the event that they did, they were to indicate whether they wished to attach their half of the province to India or to Pakistan.' Accordingly, on 2oJune, these two provisionally partitioned units met to vote on the question of parti- tion. The majority of representatives of the Hindu majority districts voted in favour of the partition of Bengal, while those of the Muslim- majority districts voted against it.7 On the basis of this vote, it was 6 'Statement by His Majesty's Government, dated the 3rd June 1947'.

It was only after this vote that the Boundary Commission was set up to determine the real or final border between the two Bengals. This procedure had some remarkable features, which become apparent if we consider the process by which the people's will to partition was assumed to have been established. The vote that was taken to establish their will to partition had been cast in an Assembly temporarily or notionally divided into two parts. Before the Boundary Commission had given its Award, there was no knowing to what extent these notional units would match the final shape of the two partitioned states. The partition vote was therefore necessarily an imperfect one because members of the notional West Bengal Assem- bly voted for partition without knowing for certain whether their constituencies would continue to be in West Bengal when the Award was finally made. Whether or not such fore-knowledge would have made a difference to the final outcome-the majority in the West Bengal assembly deciding in favour of partition-must remain a matter of conjecture. But it is significant that the procedure for establishing the will on a question of such momentous import was dealt with so summarily. It is also significant that the two voting blocs were divided, in the first instance, on territorial lines. This is noteworthy because every- one agrees that the basis for the partition was to satisfy a communal demand for autonomy; that its purpose was to ensure, for those who demanded it, a communal right to self-determination. But from the very start of the process of implementing the partition, this principle had to be tempered by a host of other considerations, amongst which territorial questions were paramount. The two voting groups into which the Bengal Assembly was divided were composed of the repres- entatives of territorial rather than communal units: Hindu-majority and Muslim-majority districts respectively. Hindu and Muslim mem- bers were not invited to meet separately to determine their collective communal will on what was, in its primary form, a communal ques- tion. There is little doubt that the result of the voting (Hindus voting aye and Muslims nay) would have been the same. But it is interesting Bengal should join the existing Constituent Assembly. At a separate meeting later on the same day, members of the East Bengal Assembly voted against partition by 106 votes to 35. Burrows to Mountbatten, telegram dated 2 June 1947. Document No. 278, N.

By this stage, therefore, the parties appear to have accepted that communal autonomy was to be realized by the creation of separate territorial sovereignties. There are subtle but significant differences between the notions of communal autonomy and territorial sover- eignty. The first emphasizes the rights of the people of a community to self-determination, rights which could in theory be achieved within a single state. The second stresses the bounded space within which a community is sovereign, and could be realized only by a territorial separation.8 The tension between the two concepts is not always apparent but nevertheless it emerged quite sharply when the actual process of division began, as the focus of attention rapidly shifted from the question of how communal autonomy could be real- ized to the issue of how much territory was to be made available to each state. The Constitution of the Bengal Boundary Commission Once the will to partition had been established in this singular fash- ion, the next step was to set up a Boundary Commission that would draw up the final or 'real' border, on the basis of which power would be transferred to the two dominions. The establishment of the Commission, though on the face of it uncontroversial, reveals some of the priorities of the key players at this stage of the negotiations for the transfer of power. Jinnah had been in favour of having a Commission composed of three 'impartial' non-Indians, appointed on the recommendation of the United Nations.' But his proposal had not found favour with the Earl of Listowel, then Secretary of State for India. Listowel was not only worried that 'the Russian and other Slav states [might] create ... difficulties'; he was also concerned that an appeal to the UN might 'suggest that we ourselves had proved incapable of transferring power without recourse to that body...'.i0 The Congress also 8 Indeed, it has been argued that it was precisely this ambiguity that Jinnah exploited when he refused to define Pakistan in precise terms.

'0 Listowel to Mountbatten, telegram dated 13 June 1947, ibid., No. 195-</page><page sequence="7">THE FASHIONING OF A FRONTIER 191 opposed Jinnah's proposal, though for different reasons: Nehru feared that going to the UN would cause an unacceptable delay. He suggested instead that 'each Commission should consist of an independent Chairman and four other persons of whom two would be nominated by the Muslim League and two by the Congress'; that they should all be 'of high judicial standing' and should elect their own Chairman." Eventually, Mountbatten accepted this proposal word for word.'2 The significance of all this lies not only in its demonstration of the extent to which, by this stage, Mountbatten was happy to take his cue from Nehru and the Congress.'3 The fact that the members of the Boundary Commissions were to be nominated by political parties indicates the degree to which party-political considerations were expected to play a part in the Commission's findings. No one at the time appeared to have any doubt that the work of the Commissions was not going to be simply technical. In the circumstances, the fact that the Commissioners were to be judges of the highest standing was neither here nor there. If the impartiality and professionalism of the Commissioners had already been vitiated by the manner of their appointment, every effort was made to protect the credibility of Sir Cyril Radcliffe, whose name Mountbatten proposed as Chairman jointly of the Bengal and Punjab Boundary Commissions.14 Perhaps one reason for this was that the Congress party had initially objected to Radcliffe, appar- ently under the impression that he was a conservative and therefore likely to favour the Muslim League.'" (Here was another example of the part that party-political bias was expected to play in these events.) Mountbatten took pains to ensure that Radcliffe as Chair- man 'should not only be, but appear to be, free from official influ- ence'. He insisted, for instance, that Radcliffe should be housed nei- " Nehru to Mountbatten, ioJune 1947, ibid., No. 128. 12 'Minutes of the Viceroy's Eighteenth Miscellaneous Meeting', ibid., No. 175- 13 Mountbatten had initially agreed with Jinnah, telling Listowel that personally, he 'could think of no better proposal'. Mountbatten to Listowel, telegram dated 9 June 1947, ibid., No. 120. But he did a volte-face as soon as Nehru made his objec- tions known. No doubt the arrangement recommended by Nehru suited his strategy better: it would give an Indian gloss to the Commission while ensuring that the effective deciding voice would be that of an 'independent' (non-Indian) chairman in whose appointment the Viceroy should confidently expect to have a say. 14 Radcliffe had been recommended to Mountbatten for the job by the Secretary of State as a man of high integrity, legal reputation and wide experience.

And there are reasons to believe, despite all protestations to the contrary,18 that this belief was not entirely unfounded. Mountbatten did not influ- ence the fine print of the Award but he undoubtedly inspired some of its broader features. For one thing, it was Mountbatten's idea that Radcliffe should chair both Commissions with the idea that a single chairman would keep the larger picture in mind.19 No doubt with an eye to enhancing the palatability of the Awards, he went so far as to advise Radcliffe to compensate each party's gains on one border with losses on the other.20 So although the two Commissions were inten- ded to be entirely independent, in fact they were not. This brought into play the prospect of a quid pro quo between Bengal and Punjab. Radcliffe subsequently insisted that he paid no heed to Mountbat- ten's advice and treated each Commission strictly independently.21 Nevertheless, the parties framed their respective cases before the Commissions under the impression that the two Awards would be linked, and that some loose principle of balance between them would be followed. This certainly influenced the final contours of both borders. It is also true that Mountbatten, by and large, left Radcliffe to interpret his own terms of reference.22 But the terms themselves 16 Abbott to I. D.

This drastically limited the scope for the</page><page sequence="9">THE FASHIONING OF A FRONTIER 193 were set out by the Viceroy, who once again saw fit to accept Nehru's advice on the subject. Nehru was clear that the work of the Boundary Commission was to be done as quickly as possible, believing (with characteristic nalvete) that 'when the two States have been formed, those States will mutually consider modifications and variations of their frontiers so that a satisfactory arrangement is reached' and that 'this was likely to be a fairly lengthy process involving the aser- tainment of the wishes of the people concerned in those areas'.23 If, he argued, this was left to the Boundary Commission, its work would be 'heavy and prolonged',24 making it unlikely that the borders would be defined by 15 August. In these circumstances, the transfer of power would either have to be delayed or be carried out on the basis of the existing notional boundaries. Nehru was convinced that both these options were unacceptable and that, for the purpose of trans- ferring power, a makeshift border would do. Mountbatten (at least on the face of it) agreed with him. So when Nehru suggested that the Boundary Commission be instructed only 'to demarcate the boundaries of the two parts of Bengal on the basis of ascertaining contiguous majority areas of Muslims and non-Muslims', taking 'into account other factors',25 Mountbatten accepted Nehru's proposal to the letter.2' The fact that the border was never intended to be any- thing other than a rough-and-ready improvisation was impressed upon Radcliffe,27 and the result of his labours bore all the marks of the rush job that it was. This insistence on speed flew in the face of the administrators' advice. The clearest warning came from Evan Jenkins, Governor of transfer of territories from Assam to East Bengal. It has also been revealed by Christopher Beaumont, who acted as Private Secretary to Radcliffe, that Mountbatten (allegedly under pressure from Nehru) persuaded Radcliffe to change the Punjab borderline in India's favour, so that Ferozepur tehsil was awarded to India instead of Pakistan.

His assessment was that '... in the time available it [would] be quite impossible to make a clean job of partition, and even if... disorder [were checked] up to 15 August ... there [would] be appalling confusion [afterwards] ...'. Making a pointed reference to Mountbatten's ignorance of civilian (as opposed to military) affairs, he stressed that '... in civil administration, certain things cannot be done in a matter of days or weeks, and "standstill" orders (most of which will be accepted very grudgingly by the Parties) do not really solve the administrative problem . . .'. But his counsel was not heeded by the Viceroy, whose entire strategy for partition appears to have been to rush it through without giving anyone a moment to pause for thought.29 And the Indian leaders, perhaps tempted by the short-term gains that a speedy settlement seemed to offer, went along with him.30 Radcliffe's Award was ready on 12 August, well in time for the transfer of power in Pakistan on the fourteenth. But in a remarkable 28 'Meetings of the Partition Committee', he said, 'resemble a Peace Conference with a new war in sight. ... The Chairman of the Boundary Commission does not arrive until 14July.

One might conjec- ture (uncharitably) that perhaps both the League and Congress leaders were in an inordinate hurry to assume office, or that the Congressmen in particular were anxious to wrap things up while a friendly Viceroy, Mountbatten, was in command. A kinder view might be that they were all eager to avert a communal holocaust. Yet in hindsight one can see that in their very haste, they hurtled blindly towards precisely the scenario they wished to avoid: for there is little doubt that the Punjab violence was in no small measure a response to perceived injustices and irregularit- ies in the Punjab Boundary Award. One can only share the bafflement of Maulana Azad, when he writes, 'Why was there such a hurry in taking a decision which almost everybody regarded as wrong? If the right solution to the Indian problem could not be found by 15 August, why take a wrong decision and then sorrow over it? I had again and again said that it was better to wait until a correct solution was found. I had done my best but my friends and colleagues did not support me.

He brought his influence to bear upon Radcliffe, who agreed reluctantly to post-date the Award for the thirteenth, by which time Mountbatten had already left for Karachi, and ultimately the Award was only published on 17 August. We cannot be certain whether Mountbatten genuinely changed his mind upon realizing late in the day just how unpopular the Award would be, or whether to delay the announcement had been his inten- tion all along. Once again, he ignored administrative advice, this time from the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces. Auchin- leck warned that because it was already widely known that the Award was ready, the delay in announcing it, by allowing 'the wildest rumours' to gain currency, was 'having the most disturbing and harmful effect'."3 But Mountbatten's concern to protect his Govern- ment's image overrode all other factors. As he explained to the Brit- ish Government, although 'from the purely administrative point of view there were considerable advantages in immediate publication so that the new boundaries could take effect on 15 August ... it had been obvious all along that, the later we postponed publication, the less would the inevitable odium react upon the British... '." More personal considerations also appear to have been involved in this decision. By all accounts, Lord Mountbatten was a man who enjoyed pomp and circumstance more than most. So he was particularly anxious that no unpleasantness should mar the transfer of power celebrations in which he would play viceroy for the last time. For reasons of this sort, power was transferred on the basis of the notional boundaries after all, and the hurry with which the Radcliffe line was drafted turned out to have been completely-and as we shall see, tragically-unnecessary.

The Commission was sup- posed to arrive at its decision by studying closely the claims and representations put to it by members of the public. But, in fact, constraints of time meant that only the petitions presented by the key political parties could be examined with any degree of thor- oughness. Also, as we have seen, the four presiding judges were party-political appointees, so it was only to be expected that their recommendations to the Chairman would be deeply partisan.33 And because Radcliffe arrived at his Award essentially through evaluating their respective arguments, the claims and counter-claims of the political parties had a direct bearing on the final outcome. The Bengal Boundary Commission's brief was to 'demarcate the boundaries of the two parts of [the province] on the basis of ascer- taining contiguous majority areas of Muslims and non-Muslims' while also taking into account 'other factors'.34 The cases put before the Boundary Commission by the Muslim League and the Hindu 'Co-ordination Committee' both used this last ambiguously worded clause to press for the inclusion of territory that could not conceiv- ably have been claimed on the grounds of contiguous majority areas. But there were significant differences of emphasis between the two representations made before the Commission. Within the Hindu Co- ordination Committee, inter-party disagreements broke out on the question of what constituted a reasonable claim. There are also tan- talizing hints of schisms within the Congress party's ranks on the question of the shape and size of the new West Bengal. These dissen- sions throw light on the kind of concerns that were uppermost in the minds of the politicians when they lobbied before the Commission. One striking feature of both cases was the language in which they were couched. Both cases were written in a highly legalistic, tech- nical style that could not have been more different from the hyper- bole of the communal propaganda generated for popular consump- tion. Both were persuasive and insisted on the reasonableness of their respective demands. Both were backed with reams of 'evidence' and called on 'experts' to validate their arguments. The style in which the arguments were presented (and also much of their substance) calls to mind a property dispute being fought in a court of law. In addition, the fact that all the Commissioners were judges 3 See the 'Report of Non-Muslim Members' and the 'Report of Muslim Mem- bers', in PP, VI, pp. 29-70; 71-115. 34 'Statement by His Majesty's Government, dated the 3rdJune 1947', PP, I, p. 2.</page><page sequence="13">THE FASHIONING OF A FRONTIER 197 and the Chairman was a lawyer, has bolstered the widespread impression that the Award and the cases on which it was based were the product of legal expertise, resting on judicial (rather than political) rationality; and by extension that the Commission's rulings met the technical requirements of legal justice. But the picture that emerges from a closer reading of the Commission's deliberations is not so clear cut. The 'Muslim' case was the simpler of the two. For one thing, there was just one party involved; only the Muslim League came forward to represent the Muslims before the Commission. The Bengal Pro- vincial Muslim League was deeply divided by this time and the two main factions, led by Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy and Khwaja Nazi- muddin respectively, were on the bitterest of terms. But these differ- ences did not affect the Muslim League case before the Commission, because only Nazimuddin's party took any interest in it. It will be recalled that Suhrawardy and Abul Hashim had co-authored a pro- posal for a united and sovereign Bengal, independent of both India and Pakistan. Having made public their opposition to the partition of Bengal, the two men were not disposed to sit down to work out the details of a division they had already rejected.35 And for obvious reasons, Congress-minded Muslims (such as Ashrafuddin Ahmed Chowdhury), who were staunchly opposed to partition in any form, took no part in the Boundary Commission's proceedings. Nazimud- din's group, on the other hand, supported the creation of a single Pakistan: they had opposed the partition of Bengal only because they wanted the whole of the province for Pakistan. Moreover, as the faction with the closest ties with Jinnah and the All-India Muslim League, Nazimuddin's group could confidently expect to take charge of East Pakistan after partition and they therefore had the greatest stake in the Commission's proceedings.36 So at the end of the day, Nazimuddin's party took charge of the 'Muslim' case on its own. 35 Hamidul Huq Chowdhury, who framed the Muslim League's case, thus recalls, 'I did not receive any assistance from ... Suhrawardy.... [T]he group represented by ... Suhrawardy was not on talking terms with me or my group. .... As a result, during.., the Boundary Commission I was left entirely to my own resource [s] with- out any assistance or help from the [Suhrawardy] party. Not for one single day did any member of the party of the Ministry take any interest in the Boundary [Com- mission] proceedings in Sylhet or Bengal...'.

In order to achieve this, it insisted on particular prin- ciples. The first was that the scope of the term 'contiguity' was to be limited to areas within Bengal; i.e. that if a Hindu-majority area was not contiguous to any other Hindu-majority area in Bengal it should go to East Bengal, even if it were contiguous to any other Hindu- majority outside Bengal in the Indian union. On this basis, the League claimed for East Bengal three districts where Muslims were a small minority of the population, namely the Chittagong Hill Tracts, Darjeeling and Jalpaiguri.37 The next point that the League insisted upon was that the unit of partition should be either the union or the subdivision. As the small- est units of administration, it was argued, they were cohesive and integrated in terms of politics and governance and could not easily be divided. Of the two, it favoured the subdivision, which would, it claimed, yield a straighter borderline. The League's spokesmen urged that the communal majority of each subdivision be worked out and that contiguous Muslim-majority subdivisions be allotted to East Bengal. Of course, there was merit in the argument that adminis- trative and political units (such as unions) might have real advant- ages as units of partition over thanas (or police stations), which were merely criminal jurisdictions. But the point was more that a division based on contiguous majority subdivisions or even unions would give East Bengal more territory. In addition, the Muslim League claimed huge territories for East Bengal on the basis of a variety of 'other factors'. The scope of the 'other factors' clause was interpreted most liberally to make a bid for Calcutta. The League insisted that East Bengal must be given a share of the provincial revenue proportionate to its share of Bengal's population, and this could only be achieved if Calcutta went to the east.38 On these grounds, not only did the League demand for East 37 This description of the Muslim League representation before the Bengal Boundary Commission is based on the 'Report of the Muslim Members' before the Bengal Boundary Commission, reproduced in PP, VI, Reports of the Members andAwards of the Chairman of the Boundary Commission (West Bengal Government Press, Alipore, 1950), pp. 71-82. 38 It asserted that 'The total revenue of Bengal is about forty crores [rupees] of which thirteen crores are ... contributed by Calcutta alone. If Calcutta goes to West Bengal, the result will be that West Bengal with about one third of the total population of the Province will appropriate 66.9% of the revenue, while East Bengal with two thirds of the population will have at its disposal only 33% of the revenue .

But they insisted that '.. . the partition [was] not to be effected on the basis of putting the maximum per- centage of any class of population on one side or the other or balan- cing the populations in the two provinces. The basis is the determina- tion of contiguous majority areas . . .'.42 Hence, in order to claim for East Bengal the greatest possible amount of territory, the Muslim members of the Commission were driven to insist that the aim of partition was not to ensure self- determination for the largest possible numbers of each community, apparently reversing the Muslim League's proclaimed objectives. Their reasons for taking this position become clearer if it is borne in mind that the party had opposed the partition of Bengal. It had good reasons for this. Muslims constituted a majority of roughly 55% in Bengal as a whole. If Bengal were not divided, a government elected by the Muslim majority would exercise sovereignty over the entire territory of Bengal. The 1946 elections had proved beyond doubt that this would be a Muslim League government.43 A partition could only serve to reduce the extent of territory over which the League's sovereignty could extend. Once the partition of Bengal had been accepted in principle, the logical aim for Muslim spokesmen was to limit, as far as possible, the loss of territory and assets to West 39 This very loose reading of the 'other factors' clause contrasted sharply with the case presented by the judges nominated by the Muslim League for the Punjab Boundary Commission, who insisted on the narrowest possible interpretation of the same clause. See, for instance, the report of MrJustice Muhammad Munir, 6 August 1947, in Kirpal Singh (ed.), Select Documents on Partition of Punjab-1947, India and Pakistan (Delhi, 1991), pp. 419-20. 4 See Map I. 41 The exact figure was 66.89%.

By claiming almost four-fifths of the province, they had noth- ing to lose and everything to gain. For the Hindu members of the Commission, however, the position was not so straightforward. The Hindu members of the provisional West Bengal Assembly had voted for partition so as to secure a 'homeland' for the Hindus of Bengal. They had wanted, in other words, to create a separate space within which Hindus, by virtue of their larger numbers, would determine their own future.44 So it was crucially important to have a homeland with an outright and sizeable Hindu majority. Like their Muslim counterparts, on the other hand, they also wanted enough territory to accommodate the population and sustain a viable economy. The imperative for a communal major- ity had to be balanced against the requirements of space and eco- nomic rationality. How much territory was 'enough'? How far could the communal majority safely be watered down? These were ques- tions with no obvious or determinate answer. Inevitably, there were differences amongst the spokesmen for Hindu interests on what con- stituted the best possible solution. These disagreements were accentuated by the fact that four parties jointly presented the Hindu case before the Boundary Com- mission. In addition to the Congress, the Hindu Mahasabha, the Indian Association and the New Bengal Association45 were repres- ented on the Central Co-ordination Committee. The barrister Atul Chandra Gupta was appointed by the Congress president, J. B. Kripalani, as its chairman. He also led the Congress camp on the Committee. Differences emerged when the spokesmen of the four parties put their heads together to formulate the case to be argued before the Commission. The representatives of the three smaller parties consti- tuted a majority of ten in the twelve-member Co-ordination Commit- tee. They insisted that the maximum possible extent of territory must be claimed. In addition to the ten Hindu-majority districts (Burdwan, Midnapore, Birbhum, Bankura, Howrah, Hooghly, 24 Par- ganas, Khulna, Darjeeling and Jalpaiguri), they demanded that two entire Muslim-majority districts (Malda and Murshidabad), large parts of Nadia, Faridpur and Dinajpur, and selected thanas in Rang- 44 For more details on the Hindu communal campaign for the partition of Bengal in 1947, see Chatterji, Bengal Divided. 4 The New Bengal Association was formed towards the end of 1946 to agitate for the partition of Bengal.

Indeed, even this maximal claim fell far short of what was being demanded by some of their wilder supporters. The Arya Rash- tra Sangha, for instance, insisted that as much as four-fifths of the territory of Bengal be made over to West Bengal, on the grounds that four-fifths of all lands were owned by Hindus; that every single town in Bengal should go to the West because over 75% of their population was Hindu, and so on.48 The New Bengal Association itself was a right-wing pressure group which had come into existence in 1946 as a forum to lobby for the partition of Bengal. Run by a self- styled Major General, it was a front-runner in all subsequent cam- paigns to demand more Bihari areas for West Bengal.49 Not much is known about the association or its leaders. But its pamphlets suggest that for 'Major General' Chatterjee and his cohorts, Hindu Bengalis were a distinct race of people, and that they were of the view that for this people to fulfil its destiny, it was crucial to have enough space.50 Territory was clearly central to the Association's vision of 'New Bengal'. The Bengal Provincial Hindu Mahasabha, as a branch of a larger all-India organization, could not advocate patently aggressive Bengali chauvinism of this sort, however much some of its members 46 See Map II. 47 Memorandum for the Bengal Boundary Commission.

But there were other important party-political considerations that pushed the Bengal Mahasabha to make implausible demands for territory. Such inroads as the Bengal branch of the Mahasabha had been able to make in building an organization were chiefly limited to the eastern districts, to Barisal and Dacca in particular."5 The party had also worked hard to woo the Scheduled Castes into the Mahasabha fold through shuddhi and sangathan campaigns in the early forties.52 The largest and most influential of these castes, the Namasudras, were clustered in the districts of Jessore and Faridpur: this was one per- suasive reason for the Mahasabha to demand that these areas be included in West Bengal."5 In the aftermath of the 1946 elections, in which the Mahasabha had been humbled by the Congress, it was understandably anxious to salvage as much of this base as possible. It also clearly hoped to recover some lost ground by winning the allegiance of Hindu refugees from East Bengal, who had begun to arrive in thousands after the Noakhali riots. So it justified its excess- ive territorial claims on the grounds that 'the new State of West Bengal should be in a position to provide for the inclusion and accom- modation of immigrants from Pakistan'.54 Though undoubtedly 5' Writing in August 1045 Ashutosh Lahiry, the Secretary of the Bengal Provin- cial Hindu Mahasabha, claimed that there were 1,400 branches all over Bengal.

His claim cannot be substantiated, but the party's papers indicate that the most dynamic branch was in Barisal, while those in Narayanganj, Dacca, Sirajgang, Noakhali, Brahmanbaria, Pabna and Chandpur were active. 52 For further details on the Mahasabha's campaign for the allegiance of the Scheduled Castes, see Chatterji, Bengal Divided, pp. 195-203.

Indeed, even after the Radcliffe Award was announced, Dr Shyama Prasad Mookerjee continued to insist in Parliament that more East Pakistani areas be seized so as to accommodate the refugees in West Bengal, and the issue remained one of the focal points of Mahasabha campaigns at least until the first general elections in 1952.</page><page sequence="21">THE FASHIONING OF A FRONTIER 205 aware that it was very unlikely to succeed in persuading the Bound- ary Commission that its demands were fair or reasonable, its leaders probably calculated that it could do the party no harm to try. If they failed, as they almost certainly would, they could still claim to have fought for the Hindu cause until the bitter end. If, on the other hand, they succeeded in winning for West Bengal even the smallest piece of extra area (in excess of the Congress demand), they would come out as heroes who had stood up for Hindu rights, in contrast to the weak-kneed moderacy of the Congress. Atul Chandra Gupta, the lawyer who represented the Congress party, took a very different view of the Hindu cases. He was con- vinced that to put forward this maximum demand, which claimed over 57% of the land for 46% of the population, would be suicidal because 'no one seriously thinks that it will be accepted by the Com- mission'.55 It was, he argued, bad legal strategy to argue a case that could so easily be shot down. He held that it was more crucial for the Hindu side to present a patently reasonable case, because it was the Hindu side that had called for partition in the first place. When the other Hindu parties refused to accept this argument, he offered to put two plans forward. The first, called the 'Congress Scheme', outlined the Congress party's maximum demand. Although it called upon 'other factors' to demand a good number of Muslim-majority thanas, it still fell considerably short of the Mahasabha's more fan- tastic claims."6 The second plan (known as the 'Congress Plan') was a lesser, more plausible claim, drawn up strictly on the basis of con- tiguous majorities. As Gupta explained, the point of having two plans was tactical: he wanted to demonstrate the shortcomings of the Plan to strengthen the larger claims put forward in the Congress Scheme.57 But the other parties felt that this procedure was so com- 55 Atul Chandra Gupta to J. B. Kripalani, 12 July 1947, AICC-I/G-33/1947-48. 56 So, for instance, while the Mahasabha demanded the whole of Malda (a Muslim-majority district), the Congress scheme did not claim its five eastern thanas. Similarly, while the Mahasabha wanted all of Jessore, the Congress asked only for those parts of that district that lay to the west of the River Gorai. In Rajshahi, the Mahasabha asked for three thanas, the Congress scheme asked for only one: namely Boalia. See the Memorandum on the Partition of Bengal presented on Behalf of the Indian National Congress before the Bengal Boundary Commission (filed on 17 July 1947), AICC-I/CL-14(D)/i947-48. 57 As he explained to Kripalani, his purpose was 'to show the defects of the plan to strengthen our argument for adopting the Scheme of partition ... this cannot be done by keeping Plan I up the sleeve and bringing it out only after the attack on the Scheme of partition by the Muslim League and Muslim commissioners .. .'.

Gupta then threatened to resign from the Commit- tee."58 At this point, the Congress leadership intervened: Dr Prafulla Ghosh wrote to Kripalani in support of the Chairman's view,59 Gupta retracted his resignation and the two cases were presented side by side. Why did the Bengal Congress dig in its heels, even to the extent of overruling the majority in the Hindu Co-ordination Committee? At one level, the party was merely following its lawyer's advice on the best strategy (and that it was sound advice was proved sub- sequently when the Award was made). But would Atul Chandra Gupta's purely technical view of the case have prevailed if there had not been good political reasons to support it? Dr Prafulla Ghosh, as Chief-Minister-in-waiting and as leader of the shadow cabinet, was obliged to take a more responsible position than the Hindu opposi- tion.60 He was also alive to the security implications of the border and was concerned that no demands be made that might jeopardize the safety of Calcutta.6' But perhaps, more importantly, the Con- gress leadership in Bengal was enjoying its first ever taste of power. Like the all-India Congress leadership, it could see the logic of cut- ting out potential trouble spots where its writ might be challenged.62 It could also see clearly that it was inadvisable to water down too much the Hindu majority of West Bengal, by including large Muslim- majority areas. From the point of view of those who would take over the reins of the West Bengal government, a compact state with a clear-cut Hindu majority would be the best guarantee for the 58 Ibid. 59 Prafulla Ghosh to J.

Prafulla Ghosh to Acharya Kripalani, 12 July 1947, AICC-I/G-33/1947-48. 6' As he pointed out, 'According to Plan No. 1, the boundary of Pakistan will be 40 miles off from Calcutta. If we demand more than that, we shall have to concede that as far as the Pakistan capital is concerned.. .'.

But there were also different sorts of rumblings within the Con- gress party. Now that power was at last within reach, it was hard indeed to accept a smaller share in it. Once the decision to partition Bengal had been made, cracks began to surface in the alliance that had led the Jatiya Banga Andolan (or the 'Bengal National Move- ment' as the Congress described the movement for partition it had led). In May 1947, a pamphlet entitled The Origin and Progress of the Partition Movement in Bengal was published by the West Bengal Provin- cial Committee. The Provincial Committee was a Congress- sponsored body which had been set up in December 1946 at Calcutta with the object of mobilizing support for partition.64 The pamphlet alleged that in January 1947, dissension had emerged within the Committee on the question of the boundaries of the proposed new West Bengal state. The dissidents within the Committee had formed the Jatiya Banga Sangathan Samiti, with Jadabendranath Panja of the Burdwan District Congress Committee as President and Atulya Ghosh, secretary of the Hooghly Congress, as its Secretary. This Samiti lobbied for the exclusion of the entire Muslim-majority districts of Nadia, Jessore and Murshidabad, and also of the Hindu-majority districts of Jalpaiguri and Darjeeling in North Bengal.65 It also opposed plans to demand the inclusion of Bengali-speaking areas of Bihar in the new West Bengal state. This proposal points to the existence, within the Congress party, of minimalist pressures for the creation of a small and territorially compact state that would include only the districts of south-west and central Bengal. This is significant in itself, particularly as a counter- point to the wild claims of Mahasabha and other parties, and also to the expansionism of the West Bengal Congress in later years.66 But it is also revealing to look at the particularities of the plan: at what areas it proposed to include and what it wanted to jettison. The demand to exclude North Bengal was particularly significant. North Bengal was something of a frontier region, ethnically and cul- 63 See Map III. 64 Hemanta Kumar Sarkar was its general secretary and Upendranath Banerjee its president.

But from the economic point of view, North Bengal was enormously important. Darjeeling and Jalpaiguri produced practically all of Bengal's fine teas and were destined to be key revenue earners for the new state. Indeed, so great was the economic potential of these two districts that neighbouring states coveted them for themselves. In September 1947, there were reports that Assamese politicians were encouraging anti-Bengali movements in North Bengal. In Darjeeling, the Gurkha League demanded independence from West Bengal, allegedly with the backing of Assamese politicians and Brit- ish tea planters (the latter no doubt could see the advantages of having their estates in the less volatile state of Assam, safe from the communist menace). At the same time the Raja of Cooch-Behar began a campaign against Bengali bhatias (outsiders), insisting that the autochthonous Rajbangshi tribals ofJalpaiguri and Cooch-Behar had more in common with their neighbours in Assam than with the Bengali babus.68 If Cooch-Behar could not be allowed to exist as a separate state, he insisted that it must go to Assam rather than to Bengal. Not long afterwards, when the boundary disputes between West Bengal and Bihar began to gain ground, the police reported secret meetings between Bihari and Gurkha leaders, at which they discussed the possibility of Darjeeling's transfer to Bihar.69 It was plain to all, therefore, that North Bengal was a glittering prize. Yet there were Congressmen in West Bengal who would gladly have thrown it away. Murshidabad also had a special significance as the site of the head- waters of the Hooghly. It was generally agreed that the survival of Hooghly as a port (and of Calcutta as an entrep8t of trade) depended on its link with the River Ganges, which flowed through the northern edge of Murshidabad. The representatives of all four Hindu parties had therefore insisted that Murshidabad be included in West Bengal, although it was a Muslim-majority district. There appears to have 67 For an excellent ethnography of the area, see Ranajit Das Dupta, Economy, Society and Politics in Bengal:Jalpaiguri I869-I947 (Delhi, 1992), pp. 5-26. 68 Secretary, Dacca District National Chamber of Commerce to Prafulla Chandra Ghosh, 5 September 1947.

If, moreover, these three districts were sacrificed, it would mean that the claim to parts of Dinajpur and Malda (and eventually Cooch-Behar) on the grounds of contiguity would also have to be given up. All in all, six districts (Darjeeling, Jalpaiguri, Cooch-Behar, Dinajpur, Malda and Murshidabad) were being written off in exchange for one: Khulna. Three of the six (Darjeeling, Jalpai- guri and Cooch-Behar) had outright, unequivocal, Hindu majorities. What imperatives could have prompted this remarkable demand? One obvious answer is that Khulna Congressmen were involved in this move. From their point of view, any territorial or economic losses that the state might have to suffer in the future would be preferable to the immediate loss of Khulna to Pakistan. But neither of the office holders of the Samiti was from Khulna, nor is there any evidence that Khulna men were particularly strongly represented on the Samiti. So clearly this was not the only consideration. It seems very likely that the formation of the Samiti was the first phase in the process by which territorial factionalism emerged as a powerful force within the West Bengal Congress. The notorious fractiousness of the Bengal Congress had not been much in evidence during the forties. Once Subhas Bose and his supporters had been expelled from the party, the Congress leadership that had taken over the party had displayed a rare cohesiveness and unity of purpose, particularly during the campaign for the partition of Bengal. But immediately after Independence, groupism re-emerged with a ven- geance. For three or four years afterwards, Congressmen in West Bengal would engage in a rancorous contest for the control of the party organization, in which the battle lines were drawn on territor- ial lines. Partymen from the West Bengal heartland (chiefly Hooghly, Burdwan and Midnapore) would form themselves into an alliance in order to wrest control of the party from the refugee Congressmen from East Bengal who, by virtue of their larger numbers, continued to dominate the organization after partition, despite the fact that they had left their constitutencies behind in Pakistan. Atulya Ghosh 70 Murshidabad had a Muslim majority of 56.55%. Atul Gupta, in his letter to Kripalani, insisted that this district had to be claimed for West Bengal 'in any event'.

AICC-I/G-33/1947- 48.</page><page sequence="28">212 JOYA CHATTERJI of Hooghly and Jadabedranath Panja of Burdwan were key players in this battle in which the stake was nothing less than the capture of political power.71 The involvement of these two men in the Jatiya Banga Sangathan Samiti suggests that the nucleus of the new alli- ance had begun to crystallize well before 15 August 1947. The move to limit the boundaries of the new state to the West Bengal heart- land may well have been a pre-emptive strike by Atulya Ghosh, a man whose foresight and ruthlessness would win him the secretary- ship of the West Bengal Congress in 1950o. By January 1947, when the Jatiya Banga Sangathan Samiti was formed, it must have been clear to him that while nothing could stop the Congress party from taking office in West Bengal after partition, it was not clear which Congressmen would seize power in the divided party. If the state boundaries were drawn so as to include only the districts of the Burd- wan and Presidency divisions in the new West Bengal, Congressmen from these districts would have the best chance of controlling the party and government after partition and independence. Atulya Ghosh and the members of the Sangathan Samiti seem not to have been unduly concerned about the fact that such a partition would involve sacrificing to Pakistan the sizeable Hindu population of six northern districts. If this is correct, it would seem that canny politicians had realized very early on that the Radcliffe line would do much more than demarcate the boundaries between two nations. It would shape the very contours of control and influence in the divided successor states. It would help to define not only the political futures of political par- ties in the two successor states, but also of the individuals and fac- tions within the parties that would rule them. The disputes between the Congress and the Mahasabha on the boundary question indicate that their leaders could see that the shape of the border would have implications for the future of their respective parties. Within the Congress, equally, at least some partymen seem to have been keenly conscious of the part which the borderline would play in determining who would capture the organization. The Hindu and Muslim cases presented before the Boundary Com- mission thus reflected concerns and aspirations that had little to do with a communal vision of the welfare of the 'communities'.

Party-political, factional and personal ambitions were also very much in evidence in the list of issues that influenced the final shape the border would take. To return to the metaphor of the surgical operation, this would suggest that by the time the surgeon had begun his task, the original problem he had been called in to solve had been so overlaid with other secondary factors that it had been all but forgotten; or if not forgotten then certainly pushed far into the background. Radcliffe's Award These were some of the pressures and counter-pressures tIat Rad- cliffe had to weigh against each other while making his Award. He had to appear to be even-handed to all sides, while keeping in mind the imperatives of British policy for the future of the sub-continent. Inevitably, his Award pleased no one entirely, but there is little doubt that it displeased some less than others. The Award gave West Bengal an area of 28,ooo square miles, containing a population of 21.19 million people of which nearly 5.3 million (or 29%) were Muslims. East Bengal got 49,000 square miles for a population of 39.11 million, of which 29.1% (1 1.4 million) were Hindus.72 West Bengal got 36.36% of the land to accommodate some 35.14% of the people, while East Bengal got 63.6% of the land to accommodate 64.85% of the population.73 These figures make it immediately obvious that Radcliffe accepted the two 'cardinal principles' of the Congress case: firstly that the two parts respectively were to contain as large a proportion as possible of the total Muslim and non-Muslim population of Bengal, and sec- ondly that 'the ratio of Muslims to non-Muslims in one zone must be as nearly equal as possible to the ratio of non-Muslims to Muslims in the other'.74 Radcliffe's Award created two states in which the 72 Saroj Chakrabarty, With Dr. B.

Radcliffe also conceded the Congress argument that thanas (police stations), as the smallest units for which census figures had been published, were the most acceptable units of partition.7" He accepted the Congress argument about the importance of the Murshidabad and Nadia river system for the survival of the Hooghly and gave the whole of Murshidabad to West Bengal. Khulna went to Pakistan except for those parts of it that fell to the east of the River Mathab- hanga. It goes without saying that Calcutta went to West Bengal. The tea-producing districts of Darjeeling and Jalpaiguri also went to West Bengal,76 with the exception of the five Muslim-majority thanas of the Boda-Debiganj-Pachagarh area.7 In awarding these areas to West Bengal, Radcliffe rejected the first principle of the Muslim League's case: namely that the scope of the term 'contiguity' was to be limited to areas within Bengal. In its broad principles, therefore, the Radcliffe plan looked remarkably like the Congress scheme. The only major point that the Congress did not win was its insistence that the boundary must be continuous."78 Radcliffe would not allow this, so there were in effect two Radcliffe lines. A continuous boundary would have given West Bengal a corridor connecting the two North Bengal districts with the rest of the province: as it was, the two halves were separated from each other by a substantial stretch of foreign (and for the most part), hostile, territory." This awkward arrangement was not put right until 1956, when the States Reorganization Committee awarded a narrow piece of Bihar to West Bengal.80 Nor would Radcliffe allow the principle of contiguity to be com- promised too much: so the thana of Boalia in Rajshahi, the four 75 The Memorandum on the Partition of Bengal presented on Behalf of the Indian National Congress Case before the Bengal Boundary Commission, p. 27. 76 'The Schedule', Sir Cyril Radcliffe's Award, 12 August 1947; in PP, VI, p. 119. 77 See the telegram from Kaviraj Satish Chandra Lahiry toJ.

Despite this, Rad- cliffe's package was very similar, on the whole, to the Congress pro- posal. The Award placed 71% of the Muslim population in East Bengal and 70.8% of the Hindu population in West Bengal. Had the Congress scheme been followed in its entirety, the figures would have been 73% and 70.67%, respectively."8 Why did Radcliffe accept so much of the letter and spirit of the Congress scheme? Was he simply guided by his legal training to accept what was undoubtedly the soundest and best-reasoned case? The Award itself, brief and baldly stated as it is, gives no indication of Radcliffe's mind. Moreover, since Radcliffe refused steadfastly to elaborate further upon, supplement or discuss his Awards once they had been made, perhaps we shall never know the reasons for cer- tain.82 But if it is recalled that Mountbatten had allowed the Con- gress leadership not only to determine the structure and composition of the Boundary Commissions but also to draft their terms of refer- ence, is not entirely surprising to find that the Commission awarded, to such extent as it did, in the Congress party's favour. II Ambiguities and Errors in the Award Saroj Chakrabarty, whose memoirs are a key resource for the study of West Bengal in this period, writes that 'there was considerable resentment particularly among Hindus, over certain features of the Award'.83 If the Congress had got more or less what it wanted from Radcliffe, how do we explain the extent of discontent with the Award in West Bengal? Why is the Award remembered as a monument of folly? Much of the most vocal discontent with the Award was specific rather than general: while particular aspects of it were criticized in the strongest terms, the Award as a whole was not challenged. This sort of discontent was voiced chiefly by Hindus and Muslims who "8 See the Memorandum on the Partition of Bengal presented on Behalf of the Indian National Congress before the Bengal Boundary Commission, p. 4- 82 Hodson, The Great Divide, p. 353- 83 Chakrabarty acted as personal secretary to three successive chief ministers of West Bengal: Dr Prafulla Ghosh, Dr B.

They belonged mostly to areas immediately to the east or south-east of the Radcliffe line. So while Muslims in Murshid- abad84 and Nabadwip85 were furious to find that their distict had gone to West Bengal, Hindus of the five southern thanas ofJalpaiguri protested bitterly against their inclusion in East Pakistan.86 So did Hindus who found themselves in the wrong part of Dinajpur.87 In Nadia, particularly in Meherpur, Gangni and parts of Chuadanga west of the River Mathabhanga, Hindus took the view that their inclusion in East Bengal violated the spirit of the Award itself.88 But the most trenchant and bitter (albeit partial) attack on the Award 84 A police officer reported that because under the notional division, Murshidabad had been included in East Bengal, when Radcliffe awarded the district to West Bengal 'underground and open activities started for the inclusion of Murshidabad in East Pakistan ...

Khulna was a Hindu-majority district, covering an area of roughly 4,800 square miles to the east of the 24 Parganas. Under the provisional cabinet arrangements it had been included, in its entirety, in West Bengal. Now, after the Award, the whole district went to Pakistan in what was widely believed to be an exchange for Murshidabad. This did not, as we have seen, come as a complete surprise: nevertheless, feelings in the district ran so high that even the Khulna District Congress Committee petitioned that Khulna be exchanged back for Murshidabad.89 Justices Mukherjee and Biswas, the two Hindu members of the Bengal Boundary Com- mittee, were forced to make a public declaration to the effect that no territory had been 'exchanged' in the first place,"9 but Khulna's Hindu spokesmen found this denial hard to believe.91 Murshidabad's Hindu leaders, for their part, reacted fiercely against what they described as the 'utter selfishness and lack of perspective' of the Khulna Congress and urged the party leadership to 'cry halt to this sinister move'."9 They insisted that any agitation for the modification of the Radcliffe Award must demand territory in addition to that which had already been placed in West Bengal.93 Each aggrieved district and thana, in other words, was looking out strictly for itself. It would seem, therefore, that as the reality of partition hit them, Hindu politicians east and west very quickly forgot about the putat- 89 Associated Press of India report, cited in Ramagopal Banerjee to Acharya Kri- palani, io September 1947, ibid. 9o Ramagopal Banerjee to Acharya Kripalani, io September 1947, ibid. 9 Memorials, resolutions and all manner of petitions poured in from Nangla, Sujanshahi, Nagarghat, Tala, Mashaldanga and Sakdali (see AICC-I/G-33/1947- 48); from Bagerhat, Kamira, Katipara and Gangarampur (see AICC-I/CL-14(D)/ 1946). 92 Ramagopal Banerjee to Acharya Kripalani, io September 1947, AICC-I/G-33/ 1947-48. 93 Powerful Hindus of Murshidabad issued a statement in which they agreed that the award was 'unfair, illogical and full of inconsistencies'.

But new, equally unattractive particularisms now rose in its stead-sud- denly, the district emerged as a new locus of political solidarity. So while Hindus in Khulna resented being 'sacrificed' for the Hindu homeland, they were quite happy to demand that someone else (Murshidabad Hindus) be offered up at the altar instead. (The same spirit characterized the Murshidabad Hindu leadership's defence of the new status quo.) It is fair to say that this sort of criticism of the Radcliffe line was far from being a critique of partition, or even of the Award as a whole. It was the panic-stricken response of people who realized, too late, that they had been shut out of their promised land. But there were also a number of more general and fundamental problems with the Award, which emerged only gradually with the first efforts to implement and administer it. Despite its appearance of thoroughness and finality, the Award was surrounded by uncer- tainty. A good part of this was the result of misinformation. Most people simply did not have access to the printed document and did not know what it contained.94 The controversy that surrounded the Award, the strong (if localized) campaigns against it, and the confu- sion about the scope of the Arbitral Tribunal that had been appointed to referee disputes about the division of assets,95 all cre- ated the impression that the Award might substantially be amended. For more than a year after the Award was made, rumours that this or that district was going to be exchanged for the other fuelled hopes and fears among many people on both sides of the border. A 'strong rumour throughout Nadia district to the effect that Nadia and Mur- shidabad would be included in Pakistan in exchange with Khulna', for instance, was reported to have sparked off panic amongst Nadia 94 In his short story, 'The Champion of the People', the Bengali writer Satinath Bhaduri has portrayed vividly the confusion and uncertainty surrounding the precise terms of the Boundary Commission's Award. An English translation of this story is included in Alok Bhalla (ed.), Stories about the Partition of India, Vol. I (New Delhi, 1994). 95 The Arbitral Tribunal, chaired by Sir Patrick Spens (ChiefJustice of the Fed- eral Court), was to make awards on the division of assets and liabilities between India and Pakistan, and on the apportionment between the two dominions of expenses incurred by the Joint Defence Council. It was also to decide 'other matters arising out of partition'. It was perhaps this last clause that encouraged hopes that the Tribunal would consider border disputes. See 'The Arbitral Tribunal Order, 1947' dated 12 August 1947, PP, Vol. I. pp, 58-9.</page><page sequence="36">220 JOYA CHATTERJI Hindus; no doubt it also was the cause of vain hope for Hindus in Khulna.96 People of bordering areas lived in a state of anxiety believ- ing that any day they could wake up to find themselves in India where they had been in Pakistan, as part of a majority where they had once been minorities, and vice versa. This wildly unstable equi- librium between the communities strained communal relations to breaking point. The pettiest incidents sparked off brutal killings and the most unsubstantial rumours caused people to flee their homes in their thousands. For both governments, this became a problem of unmanageable proportions. On 14 December 1948, Nehru and Lia- quat Ali Khan signed the Inter-Dominion Agreement in a desperate bid to bring calm to the troubled borders.97 Both sides agreed to set up a tribunal that would resolve, once and for all, boundary disputes 'arising out of the interpretation of the Radcliffe Award'. This Tribu- nal, chaired by the Swedish judge Algot Bagge, announced its decisions in February 1950.98 In it, Justice Bagge interpreted and clarified those parts of Radcliffe's notification which had been ambiguously worded. The Boundary Disputes Tribunal's decision cleared up some of the doubts and misinformation about the correct interpretation of the Award. But there was another whole order of problems that it did not begin to address. Even where there was no room for doubt about what Radcliffe meant, there were still enormous difficulties in first defining and then administering the border. When he drafted the border line, Radcliffe based it upon physical or natural markers and pre-existing administrative borders. Parts of it were traced over the boundaries between thanas and districts, other parts followed the course of large rivers and their tributaries. 96 Memo from the Superintendent of Police, Nadia, to the Inspector General of Police, West Bengal, dated 31 March 1948, in GB IB File No. 1238/47 (Nabadwip). 9 Proceedings of the Inter-Dominion Conference held at Calcutta, 15-18 April 1948, Government of West Bengal Home (Political) Department Confidential Files (hereafter GWB HPC) for the year 1948 (no file number).

See the 'Decisions given by the Indo-Pakistan Boundary Disputes Tribunal in conformity with the agreement concluded at the Inter-Dominion Conference at Delhi on December 14, 1948 between the Dominion of India and the Dominion of Pakistan relating to the interpretation of the report of the Bengal Boundary Commission, August 12 and 13, 1947', PP, Vol. VI, pp. 315-21.</page><page sequence="37">THE FASHIONING OF A FRONTIER 221 On paper the result was a clear and tidy line. But as Radcliffe would have realized if he had visited the border areas himself, the picture on the ground was very different. The frontiers between thanas, and even between districts, were not physically marked out. Actual administrative boundaries could only be established with reference to survey and settlement maps, which were often inaccurate and almost always outdated. 'There is nothing to demarcate the bound- ary line except an imaginary one supported by settlement maps showing the border of villages', complained one intelligence branch officer of the Nadia border. 'In the event of encroachment ... the matter will remain disputed until it is ... amicably settled by both Dominions or decided by a court of law by reference to the Settle- ment documents, which may or may not be accepted by both Dominions . . .'.99 Such disputes could only be resolved by goodwill on both sides, which, in the strained aftermath of partition, was not often to be had. The problem became even more complicated in cases where settle- ment maps differed from the crime maps used by the local police stations to establish their jurisdiction. Radcliffe had settled on the thana as the smallest unit of partition, but he used settlement maps (rather than crime maps) to mark out the border. Contradictions between the two maps were sought to be exploited by both sides, each insisting on whichever interpretation would give it more territ- ory. On the border between Khulna and the 24 Parganas, for instance, just to the east of Hasnabad, lay a village called Rajnagar. Until October 1945, this village had been included within the juris- diction of the Debhatta thana police in Khulna district. But in 1945, the Land Record and Surveys Department had decided to add the village on to Hasnabad thana in the 24 Parganas. This change had not, however, been marked on to the relevant crime maps. In August 1947, it had been included, de facto, in West Bengal. Muslims in Khulna challenged this,100 and the village became the scene of a protracted and bitter stand-off between the two states. Nor did geographical or 'natural' boundaries work any better as border posts. If anything, they were even more ambiguous. Some of the rivers which were a part of Radcliffe's line were fed by the melt- ing Himalayan ice-caps and flowed all year round. Others were rain- 99 Inspector's 'Report on Border Intelligence of Nadia district', 23 April 1948, in GB IB File No. 1238-47 (Nabadwip). oo00 Extract from the report of the Chief Inspector of Police, Basirhat, dated 31 December 1947, in GB IB File No. 1238-47 (24 Parganas).</page><page sequence="38">222 JOYA CHATTERJI fed, and except for the monsoon months, dried up to a trickle. The Mathabhanga river, for instance, which was the dividing line between the two halves of Nadia, 'lies totally dry throughout the year except during the rainy season .. .'. But once the rains began, it would burst its banks and flood large tracts, obscuring the border completely. 'During the heavy and constant downpour, the western portion of the district [would] be practically cut off from the district headquar- ters', noted one observer, and 'the only way of transport and com- munication [would become] impassable'.1'0 So not only was this sec- tion of the border invisible for several months of the year, it was also unapproachable; with disastrous effects on border security and administration. Even the more perennial rivers created difficulties when they stood in as the border. For one thing, they were apt suddenly to change their course. Radcliffe had designated the River Mathabhanga as the border for the north-western part of Nadia, starting from the point at which 'the channel of the river Mathabhanga takes off from the river Ganges...'.''02 The problem was that the erratic Mathabhanga had already changed its path, starting off at a new point some dis- tance to the west of the old source. The new course had not been depicted on the Bengal Government Press map which Radcliffe used (although it had been shown correctly on the updated Revenue and Survey Department map). The result of this error was that almost 500 square miles of territory went to Pakistan when it should have gone to India.'"3 Nor was there any guarantee that Bengal's volatile rivers would stick to the course they were following at the time of partition. In January 1948, a police officer reported that the River Ichhamati, which defined the boundary between Khulna and the 24 Parganas, had taken a new course sixteen miles south of Hasnabad. 'The new stream, after taking a crescent course, now joins the original river at Ghumti ... about twenty miles south of Hasnabad.'

Taradhar char in the River Ichhamati was no longer navigable except during the flow tide: during the ebb tide all boats would have to use the new stream. In between the old course and the new stream, there was a piece of uninhabited land which had become a char (the Bengali word for a strip of sandy land rising out of the river bed above water level). The new char in the Ichhamati, called Taradhar char, was about two miles long and almost a mile wide."14 This tiny tract of land was submerged during flow tide, but during ebb tide was of enormous strategic significance. By virtue of its position, it was the key to the control of the entire river."15 Both sides were quick to realize this, and Taradhar char became a flash-point as each tried forcibly to claim it. Radcliffe had not given any thought to the possibility of rivers changing course; a serious lapse in a province whose rivers were notoriously wayward. Nor did he pay attention to the question of the chars which were a common feature in all the large rivers of Bengal. In all likelihood he did not know that they existed, otherwise he would surely have foreseen the difficulties they would create. The River Padma, which divided Murshidabad and Rajshahi, was dotted with chars. These 'became a bone of contention and a source of con- 104 See Figure 1. 105 Superintendent of Police (DIB), 24 Parganas, to the Assistant Inspector Gen- eral of Police, West Bengal, 14 January 1948.

Both countries scrambled to occupy them, adding to the ill will between India and Pakistan. Some of chars in the River Padma were so large that they had whole villages built upon them, and the people who inhabited these little islands became victims of a protracted tug-of-war. Biren Mandal?08 lived on Rajnagore char in the Padma river. As was typical of Bengali villages, his homestead was made up of several thatched huts, two of which fell in Rajshahi in Pakistan, while the other huts were in Murshi- dabad in India. According to a police report, both Indian and Pakistani troops periodically 'claimed his allegiance'. What this meant in real terms can only be guessed at. We do know that one of his neighbours, Bishnu Pramanik, died in the crossfire.109 Like Toba Tek Singh in Sadat Hasan Manto's celebrated story, Rajnagore char belonged nei- ther here nor there and its inhabitants paid a heavy price indeed for the Boundary Commission's careless oversight. Tragedies of this sort could have been avoided, or at leat minim- ized, had Radcliffe and the Boundary Commissioners done their job with greater care and sensitivity. Indeed, one is struck by the auda- cious haste with which they executed their task. Radcliffe did not come out to India until 8 July; the sittings of the Bengal Boundary Commission were held between 16 and 24 July, and Radcliffe gave his decision on 12 August. Radcliffe did not attend any of its public sittings in person, he merely examined the papers presented to the Commission by all parties.1o He made no effort to survey the areas 106 'Note showing the developments in Murshidabad district since the partition of Bengal', 1 December 1948.

An aerial view of the Murshidabad and Nadia rivers could have revealed some of the more obvious prob- lems, such as the new course of the Mathabhanga and the existence of chars. But it seems that no one, not even the Congress and Muslim League leaders, thought that such a survey was necessary. Police- men, revenue officers and bureaucrats in the border districts were not consulted: they undoubtedly would have given the Commission valuable advice on the conditions on the ground. It is no surprise that an Award drafted with so little attention to detail was so slipshod, so full of gross inaccuracies. All those involved in its making must bear culpability for the sheer human cost of their astounding negligence. The Border and Everyday Life But if we look to yet another level-to the everyday operation of the Radcliffe line-it becomes clear that no such Award, however care- fully and sensitively worked out, could ever have been just or rational in the way that it impinged upon the lives of people. The border cut a channel several hundred miles long, mostly through settled agricultural land. The Bengal countryside was a dense patchwork of small and large holdings, rights over which were shared in a variety of ways. Landlords, jotedars, tenant proprietors, sharecroppers and a host of other intermediaries all claimed a part of the produce of each plot of land. The same person often share- cropped one plot, held tenurial rights over another, cultivated part of this with the help of his family and let the other part out to be sharecropped by someone else. A zamindar, in the same way, might have owned one or two estates outright, but held taluqdari andjoted- ari rights over several other plots scattered over large areas. The line which severed this landscape was bound to disrupt every aspect of existence for the rural community, criminalizing the rou- tine and customary transactions by which it survived. It separated the peasant's homestead from the plot he had sharecropped in the last season and the peasant-proprietor from his holding. It cut cred- itors off from debtors; landlords from tenants. When a bhag-chashi (sharecropper) crossed the line to bring home his share of the standing crop, he risked arrest and beatings. So, for instance, when a peasant of Kumarganj in West Dinajpur was returning from Phulbari across the border with a maund of paddy that he had earned, he was</page><page sequence="42">226 JOYA CHATTERJI arrested by the East Pakistani border militia."' A Hindu zamindar of Kazipur in Nadia, who, in January 1950, crossed over to Damur- huda 'to realise rents from his tenants .., .was arrested by the Pakis- tani border patrol and released with a warning never to return'.112 That October, a resident of Dinhata in Cooch-Behar, while returning from Rangpur with money he had reclaimed from a creditor, was robbed at the border of forty-five rupees."' In another similar incid- ent, Subroto Dutta and his servant Narendra Ghosh of Puthikhali in Nabadwip went to Medinipur across the border to reclaim a grain loan. Narendra was carrying 35 seers of paddy back to Puthikhali for his master when he was caught and severely beaten by a Pakistani constable."4 The same thing happened on the western side of the border. In March 1951, some Muslims of Balabari in Cooch-Behar, who had sought shelter across the border during a communal flare-up, returned to reap the paddy they had sowed on their own plots. As one of them told the police: 'Sometime after we proceeded with harvesting, I noticed four soldiers along with [a member of the] Panchayat coming towards us. I informed my companions and asked them to run away.. .'. But the Indian police shot one of them dead as he tried to cross back to safety."5 The border thus ruptured agrarian communities all along its lengths. Now it is important to recall that these communities were by no means always harmonious ones, and the relations between their members were often bitterly antagonistic. During the forties, particularly in parts of north and deltaic Bengal, sharecroppers were engaged in a protracted and often violent struggle to retain a two- third share of the produce (tebhaga). Where the border cut through tebhaga areas, its impact on such local battles could be momentous. If it cut ajotedar off from the land he had given out to sharecroppers, it became almost impossible for him to insist on his share. Con- versely, it was greatly to the disadvantage of sharecroppers if the lands they held in barga fell on the wrong side of the border. If they insisted on crossing over to reap their 'rightful' share, the concerned "' Report for the second half of August 1950, Fortnightly Reports on Border Incidents in West Bengal (hereafter FRBI), GB IB File No. 1238-A/47. 112 FRBI for the second half of January 1950.

For their part, the sharecroppers could and did ask for the support of border patrols from their side to assist them in harvesting their crop and the policemen often obliged. Every harvesting season (at least until 1952), cases of 'forcible harvesting of paddy by Pakistani Mus- lims' were reported in large numbers; so much so that in December 1950, the West Bengal Inspector General of Police issued a special notice to all Border Superintendents to be vigilant in preventing such incidents."' In this way, border policemen and militias were drawn into agrarian conflict along the length of the border, and local struggles assumed international dimensions. In the same way, livestock could become the cause of international incidents. Cattle were not allowed freely to cross the border. It had been a common practice for poorer sharecroppers (adhiars) to enter into agreements withjotedars in which the latter would lend them the seed-grain, plough and bullocks with which they would sow and till the land. But now, if the adhiar was on the wrong side of the bound- ary, it could be difficult to get the cattle and implements across to him. So, when a Hindu resident of Mathabhanga in Cooch-Behar tried to send a pair of bullocks across the border to his adhiars at Balarhat, they were snatched away by militiamen and he never saw them again."'117 Grazing one's herds along the border also became a risky business. If they strayed across the line, they could be seized by the police or stolen by villagers on the other side. Cattle theft was particularly common on the stretches of dry border between Cooch-Behar and Rangpur, between Malda and Rajshahi, and between Nadia and Kushtia. In one week in May 1950, as many as 250 head of cattle were stolen from English Bazar."" It was difficult and dangerous to try and recover lost livestock. In one incident, an Indian Muslim of Sitalkuchi crossed over to Hatibandha to retrieve a cow that had strayed across to Pakistani territory. He was caught by a Pakistani patrol party. They beat him to death."9 Where rivers formed the borderline, fishermen who customarily fished in their waters found that their traditional occupation was now regarded as an offence. Those who fell into the hands of the river patrols were not only threatened and abused, their nets, boats 116 FBRI for the first fortnight of November 1950. GB IB File No. 1237(A)-1947.

A fisherman of Karimpur was fishing in his boat on the Mathabhanga, when he was captured by the Pakistani police. They harassed him and relieved him of his catch.'20 Some fishermen of Gaighata in the 24 Parganas were fired at while they fished in the Ichhamati. They jumped into the river and swam to safety, but their boats were seized by the police patrol.'21 The communities that fished in the many bils (shallow ponds or lakes) that spanned the border faced similar difficulties. In Dinajpur, the boundary line between Porsa and Tapan thanas passed through a large bil that was almost three miles wide. Fishermen from both thanas who depended on this bil for their survival now risked their lives every time they went out to fish.122 Border patrols and vigilantes were not the only source of danger. Sometimes fisherfolk of one side attacked fishermen from across the border. In April 1950, two hundred Pakistani fishermen attacked Indian fishermen who were casting their nets on the Indian side of Panchbar bil, and drove them out by force.'23 Here was another case of the border being exploited to settle older political scores: one section of this fishing community made the most of the opportunity to claim the sole right to fish in a bil that they had shared with other fisherfolk before partition. Even people who lived at some distance from the border found that it disrupted their lives in all sorts of ways. Few villages had their own shops. Most depended on weekly haats and on bigger markets several miles away. The border cut many villages off from the mar- kets that served them. This meant that villagers now had to brave crossing the border to purchase their personal supplies of salt, cloth and oil and whatever other goods they needed. But it also meant that the local trade on which whole regions depended was seriously hampered. The border divided towns from the hinterland that habitually supplied their needs. For instance, oilcakes, green veget- ables, potatoes, brinjals and pulses were not grown or produced in the villages surrounding Rajshahi town.

Prices were substantially lower in Murshidabad than in Rajshahi, so it had been worth their while to cross the river and carry their produce all the way to Rajshahi to sell in the markets there. After partition, the Padma became the border and people were not allowed to cross it with commodities. As a result, a whole sub-economy was destroyed.124 The suffering that resulted from the loss of markets must have been widespread. By this time, Bengali villagers had become fully integrated into the market economy. Because they all had to pay their rents and other dues and service their debts in cash, they had to sell at least part of their produce in the market.125 After partition, they naturally continued to try to get to their regular markets, often with grave consequences. A goala (milkman) of Kushtia, now in East Pakistan, was shot dead as he crossed the border to Nadia with milk for his customers.126 Border policemen drove a potter of Chapra (Nadia) away as he crossed the border to sell earthenware goods at Thakurpur, but only after they had robbed him of all his pots.127 Two Indians were arrested while they were returning home to Karimpur in Nadia after buying a maund of paddy at Brajanathpur haat in Kush- tia.128 A vegetable vendor was beaten up and robbed as he returned from Daulatpur to Jalangi in Murshidabad.129 Even when villages and their respective markets were fortuitously on the same side of the boundary, there were problems when the roads or railheads that served them were on the wrong side. The thanas of Porsa and Patnitala, which went to Bogra in East Pakistan after partition, produced two million maunds of surplus paddy every year. This paddy was sold at Nithpur haat, also in Pakistan. But the railhead connecting Nithpur went to West Bengal. The nearest line in East Pakistan was over forty miles away. The paddy now had to be transported this distance by bullock-cart or lorry, raising its price substantially.'3" While Radcliffe made an effort to preserve, as far as 124 President, Rajshahi District Congress Committee to Dr P.

Of course, the most serious disruption to transport, communica- tion and trade was caused by the separation of North Bengal from the rest of West Bengal. Between Rohanpur railway station and God- agharighat, people had to suffer 'the hardship and humiliation of passing through Pakistani territory, where they were subjected to searches'. To get to Calcutta from Malda, they had to take a circuit- ous route via Rajmahal in Bihar, with numerous changes and long waits.'"' All this caused a major setback to the multi-million-rupee tea trade.132 Not surprisingly, months after partition, the Indian Tea Planters' Association submitted a detailed road-cum-rail plan that would connect Jalpaiguri, Darjeeling, Malda and West Dinajpur with Assam and with the rest of West Bengal. The West Bengal govern- ment naturally took this plan very seriously and regarded the task of re-establishing this link as an urgent priority. But the problems of smaller roads and markets were never addressed, with long-term effects on the economy of the border zones. Towns were not only major markets of rural produce, they were also administrative headquarters and housed public institutions. Their hospitals, dispensaries and law courts drew people from miles around. The Radcliffe line cut many of them off from the people they were designed to serve. A constable of Malda who took ten days' casual leave to go home to Faridpur so as to attend the hearing of a civil suit was arrested, locked up for several hours, and prevented from attending the hearing.'33 In cases such as this, litigation already under way had to be abandoned by appellants from the wrong side of the border. In many more, legal cases could not be instituted at all because of the border had made the old district headquarters inaccessible, and the nearest court on this side of the line was too far away. The border also sometimes set these institutions apart from the staff that manned them, as in the case of the doctor who '~' Resolution passed at a public meeting at Malda on 18 February 1948.

It would take years, even decades, before problems of this sort were even addressed.'35 And finally, the border separated people from their families. Par- ticularly for those unfortunate women whose natal and affinal homes were on opposite sides of the boundary, the rare visits home to their parents became a difficult and dangerous proposition. One woman was robbed at Jadabpur on the border as she tried to go home to her family in Meherpur.

'35 The effect of partition on institutions, particularly in the east, was com- pounded many times over by the massive exodus of refugees from both sides of the border. The first wave of refugees from east to west was predominantly composed of middle-class Hindus: and amongst them were many of the doctors, lawyers, teachers, clerks and white collar employees who had manned public institutions in East Bengal. Of the 1.1 million refugees who migrated to West Bengal by June 1948, 350,000 belonged to the urban bhadralok and 550,000 to the rural bhadra- lok. Prafulla Chakrabarti, The Marginal Men.

They would join the ranks of the unemployed and disaffected, creating enormous problems for future governments.

In Punjab, both governments had agreed in principle to compensate all migrants for property that they had left behind, thereby ensuring that they would not return to reclaim it. Nehru's government also undertook a fairly vigorous scheme to resettle and rehabilitate Punjabi refugees.'" These policies were a clear indication that both India and Pakistan intended to treat the partition of Punjab as final and irrevocable. But because conditions in Bengal were not as volatile at the time, and because the flow of refugees across the eastern border was not as sudden and torrential, the two countries took the view that nor- malcy in Bengal could be restored more easily. To this end, they agreed that Bengalis could retain their title to land on both sides of the border and undertook to safeguard evacuee property for its owners until such time when they could safely come back to claim it.'38 This meant that, in theory, many West Bengalis continued after partition to own land in East Pakistan and vice versa. It also meant that, officially, the Bengal border was to be porous. Government policy decreed that people were to be allowed freely to cross the Radcliffe line to attend to their legitimate business on the other side.'1 At a meeting in Dacca in February 1948, government repres- entatives of East and West Bengal '.. . agreed to ensure the imple- mentation of the two Premiers' agreement allowing nationals of one state to move the produce of his land lying in another State in the border areas . . .'.'" For those who migrated to the other side from places that were far away from the border, these rights remained on paper. But people who lived beside the border could and did try '37 See Gyanesh Kudaisya, 'The demographic upheaval of partition: refugees and agricultural resettlement in India, 947-67', South Asia, Vol. XVIII, Special issue (1995), PP. 73-94- 138 At the Inter-Dominion Conference, Nehru and Liaquat Ali Khan agreed to set up Evacuee Property Management Boards on both sides of the Bengal border.

Two factors prevented the government's design to achieve a porous but peaceful border from having the desired effect. The first was the drive to stop smuggling. The second factor was the difficulty of impressing the official policy of openness upon border police and militias. In the turbulent aftermath of parti- tion, local policemen and vigilantes on both sides of the border were inclined to be vicious and vindictive towards minorities and over- zealous in guarding the frontier. People who were brave or foolhardy enough to cross over regardless ran the risk of being robbed, of being arrested on trumped-up charges, being beaten or even, as we have seen, being killed.143 Immediately after partition, the Standstill Agreement between the two dominions had provided for the joint administration of currency, trade, imports and exports.'44 But after it lapsed in March 1948, the Radcliffe line became an economic frontier across which trade, particularly in certain key commodities, was strictly controlled. This had the effect of notifying as criminal a whole range of customary economic activities along the border. Even though the two govern- ments agreed at the Dacca Conference to make an exception for the inhabitants of the border areas, we have seen above that this provi- sion was largely disregarded by officials on the spot. So, in fact, by the middle of 1948, there were three different and conflicting directives 141 So, for instance, every year Pakistani Muslims would cross the Bongaon border to farm the 200 bighas of land they owned at different points along the border.

First: citizens of one dominion could legally own property in the other; second: the govern- ment would control all trade in commodities between the two coun- tries; and third: inhabitants of the border area would be allowed to continue to buy their personal requirements and sell their individual produce across the border. The result, as we have seen, was messy. Officials on the spot were left with the discretion to decide which particular policy prevailed in each individual case, and they were usually harsh in dealing with border crossing by border-dwellers on genuine and legitimate busi- ness. But, on the other hand, this somewhat confused policy created space for the emergence of smuggling as a thriving enterprise in the border areas, usually with the connivance of the border police. Smuggling across the Bengal border was an attractive proposition. The price of food was higher in East Bengal than anywhere else in India,'45 and there was a huge demand in West Bengal for East Bengali raw jute. Anyone could see that there was a fortune to be made in smuggling rice across the border for sale in the markets of East Bengal,"14 and in bringing jute into West Bengal. The Indian government, struggling as it was against severe and chronic food shortages, was anxious to prevent any foodgrains from being lost to government procurement schemes. The government of East Pakistan was equally concerned to prevent raw jute from being spirited across the border. Jute was one of its key trading advantages over India, and East Pakistan could not allow it to be squandered.'47 So both governments made arrangements to secure the border against smugglers.148 Despite this, smuggling was widespread. In April 1948, border secret police reported that 'smuggling of foodgrains, textile goods 145 'The Viceroy's visit to Bengal: Note by the Viceroy', PP, Vol. I, p. 188(C). 146 On the Nadia-Kushtia border, the difference in the price of a maund of paddy could be as high as Rs. 6/-.

Consumer goods such as soap, matches, tobacco, cigarettes, soda and torch cells also regularly made their way across the border to East Bengal.'50 Jute dominated the list of clandestine exports from east to west.51' Betel nuts and chillies, which were substantially cheaper in East Bengal, were also routinely smuggled westwards.'"2 How did all of this affect everyday life on the border? It would appear that a good many border-dwellers became involved in this clandestine trade. Of course, many of them were treated as smug- glers even when they were merely conducting their habitual business across the border, selling their wares and buying a few goods to meet their personal needs. But there seems little doubt that many indi- viduals and even entire village communities took deliberately to smuggling on a regular basis. This was, in a sense, the one door of opportunity that had been opened to them when partition shut all others. As border-dwellers, they were formally entitled to cross over with their individual produce: this made them the only nationals of one state who had the right to enter the other with goods of any description. They could exploit this position to conduct their own petty illegal trade in locally produced commodities, or to act as covers or delivery-men for wider smuggling networks. One intelli- gence officer was surprised to find 'no disorder and very little bad feeling among the people of the two dominions' when he surveyed conditions in border villages in the 24 Parganas. His assessment was that 'the expected bad feeling is probably nipped [in the bud] by the self-interest of both the people of India and Pakistan. They are too made to strengthen police presence at points such as Augalbari in Karimpur which was an entrep6t for the illegal export of foodgrains and cotton to East Bengal.

Patri- otism and communalism were luxuries that they could ill afford now that partition had ruptured so many of their traditional subsistence networks. The District Magistrate of Khulna in Pakistan recognized this when he held a meeting at Kaliganj to warn its inhabitants against smuggling. He reportedly said that '... all sorts of exports to India were stopped now, "especially the export of jute". He warned them that the Pakistan government would not hesitate to shoot smugglers. He added that "Muslims should realise that Pakistan is their own dominion and requested them to check all sorts of corruption and smuggling"...'.'" His appeal to Pakistani nationalism was real- istically backed up with the threat of force, a sign that the communal and nationalist argument alone was not enough to persuade his audi- ence. In other words, border villagers appeared to be developing an attitude of rough-and-ready cynicism towards the official ideologies of their respective states: an attitude which the authorities were inclined to regard as subversive. To cope with this kind of mass subversion, it was not enough simply to beef up border patrols, although both governments did their best to strengthen and invigorate border security."55 In all like- lihood, the idea of setting up border militias was first proposed to deal with the enemy within. In February 1948, 'the Pakistan govern- ment was reported to have given a call to Muslim youths to build up a 150,000 strong non-official Muslim military organisation' to be called the Ansar Bahini. An expensive recruitment campaign using cinema slides and magic lantern shows was taken up in earnest.156 '53 Report on border affairs dated 20 March 1950.

They would act as a vigilante force, rooting out the bad eggs in the home camp and injecting a healthy dose of the state's political ideology into the border-dwelling communities. There were plenty of suitably indoctrinated young men out on a limb now that organizations such as the Muslim National Guard had become defunct. They flocked to the new Muslim militia and within months, lathi-wielding Ansars had become a familiar and dreaded sight all along the border. Not only were they involved in many of the crimes committed against border-crossers, they were also responsible for raising the communal temperature along the border. Ansars seem to have been behind a new trend which emerged after 1950, in which Muslims from border-lying villages in West Bengal would cross over to Pakistan after burning down their homesteads. Presumably this was to prevent Hindu refugees from occupying evacuee Muslim property. If they were not able to set fire to their homes before crossing, Ansars would do the job for them.'"5 Before this, it had not been uncommon for Muslims intending to migrate to Pakistan to enter into informal agreements to exchange some property with Hindus crossing the other way. It was also quite common for Muslims who left for Pakistan when the communal situ- ation was fraught, to return to their homes in India later when the air had cleared a little.'58 But once the Ansars began to display a dog-in-the-manger attitude towards Muslim evacuee property in India, communal attitudes hardened and informal and temporary arrangements such as these became much harder to achieve. In one typical incident, Ansars arrested a Hindu of Gadra in Jalpaiguri on a border road for plucking mangoes from a tree (on the Indian side of the road) that had belonged to a Muslim who had left for Pakistan. In retaliation, the man's brother attacked a Pakistani Muslim when he crossed over to graze his cattle. Communal tempers were frayed for a good while afterwards as a result.'59 The West Bengal government did not lag behind in setting up a militia of its own. In February 1948, Dr B. C. Roy announced his Government's plans for the prevention of smuggling along the fron- tier. These included arrangements not only for the establishment for a volunteer corps but also for 'training villagers in border areas to '57 See, for instance, the FRBIs for April 1950.

It was a provincial volunteer force of a 'semi-military nature', made up of trained youths from the six border districts: Jalpaiguri, West Dinajpur, Malda, Murshidabad, Nadia and the 24 Parganas.'6' The Rakshi Dal was exempted from the ban against holding parades and wearing uniforms that had been imposed upon private organizations in the wake of Gandhi's killing. It was administered in each district by a high-powered committee consisting of the Magistrate, the Superintendent of Police, the Pres- ident of the District Congress Committee and the local Assembly Member. The Government's instruction was that 'the administration of the Bangiya Jatiya Rakshi Dal should take the highest priority over routine administration'.'62 Not much information is available about the Rakshi Dal's activit- ies. But one horrific incident is perhaps indicative of the general pattern. In March 1950, Muslims from various parts of Dinhata thana in Cooch-Behar began to leave their homes and take shelter in Pakistani enclaves along the border. Masaldanga was one of these enclaves, into which about 1,500 Muslims crowded together seeking security in numbers. Some time at the end of March, the local Rakshi Dal led by the secretary of the Nazirhat Congress Committee, began to drive them out. In a campaign that resembles the ethnic cleansing of today's world, they besieged the little enclave, cutting its inhabit- ants off from access to food and other essential supplies. The people of Masaldanga decided to shift wholesale across the border to safety. On 28 March, they made their way to the check-post under the pro- tection of a Hindu mercenary who had collected a ransom from them as the price for his services. When they reached the border, they found the local Congress secretary waiting for them in the company of excise inspectors, who insisted on searching them and their belongings. This added insult infuriated the Pakistani Muslims who had collected on the other side of the border to watch. They forced their way through and a riot broke out. The Congressman, who was armed with a dagger, stabbed one of them to death, whereupon the mob turned on him and killed him with his own weapon.

If this is correct, it would seem that they played an important part in strengthening the border and making it more impregnable. This was not just because they carried lathis (and even guns) and tended to use them indiscriminately. In this they merely supplemented the already considerable physical force wielded by the official border security force. Their special contribution was to act as an ideological bulwark, not only against outsiders but against the fifth-columnists within. Their presence in the community served as a warning to the so-called 'anti-nationals' who would trade with the enemy. And for ordinary law-abiding villagers they acted as teachers in citizenship, preaching patriotism and loyalty to the new nation-state, and defin- ing the neighbour across the border as the enemy.164 Villagers were encouraged to keep their eyes open and report suspicious activities to them: in other words, to carry tales against fellow-villagers and neighbours to the authorities. So it is significant that it was Bana- phool Panchayat, head of the village council ofJaigir Balabari, who betrayed his neighbour Ershad Ali Khondokar and his companions when they crossed the border to reap the crop on their own plots in March 1951: Banaphool actually led the soldiers to the spot and pointed the culprits out to them.'65 There was also an important symbolism in the Ansars' act of burning down houses evacuated by the Indian Muslims who crossed the border to Pakistan. It was not just that the Muslim refugee now no longer had anything to go back to, although this was undeniably important. By encouraging him to set fire to his home, the Ansar was asking the Muslim refugee to repudiate his entire Indian past, to be 'born again' as a Pakistani. It was almost a rite of passage which made migration to the new state a final and irrevocable act. This flew in the face of the official policy of openness, just as the Rakshi Dal's effort at ethnic cleansing in Cooch-Behar defied Nehru's 'psychological' approach of guaranteeing security to minorit- '63 Note dated 19 April 1950.

The militias ensured that life could not go on as usual on the border. We cannot be certain how far this was the result that the two governments intended to achieve. On the Indian side, we know that there were differences of opinion between Nehru and Dr B. C. Roy, the Premier of West Bengal. The latter favoured a hard-line approach towards Pakistan and would have preferred to seal the border completely, even to Hindu refugees from the east. He also recommended that the border zones be cleared of Muslims and resettled with 'loyal' Hindus, but Nehru would have none of it.'66 It is perhaps significant that the decision to set up the Rakshi Dal was taken by the West Bengal (rather than the Indian) government. On the Pakistani side, we know only that from the middle of 1951, the border was further fortified in preparation for the impending war between India and Pakistan. In August 1951, Khulna Hindus were reportedly shifted out from areas within a radius of three miles from the border, and the entire population, Hindu and Muslim, was evacu- ated from the Jalpaiguri border. Jungles in the border zone began to be cleared and the booking of goods between Rajshahi and Godagari was stopped. In September, Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code was declared along the entire Nadia border, and in October, haats along the entire length of the border were closed down.'67 All of this changed life on the border beyond recognition. Long before war actually broke out, the little villages and once-sleepy ham- lets had become busy centres of militia activities. People whose clos- est contact with the state had once been the local chowkidar now became accustomed to seeing armed men in uniform. Where they had once lived off the land as best as they could, earning a little cash by selling their wares at the weekly market, now they could, if they dared, turn to smuggling instead, or else offer to supply the needs of the nearest police picket or army barracks. Village politics that 166 Nehru wrote: 'I have had some reports about the border areas of Nadia dis- trict. It is stated that large number[s] of Muslims living on our side of the border are being uprooted and taken elsewhere. Presumably, the policy is to clear those areas, up to a certain depth, of Muslims because it is thought that they might be unreliable elements in case of trouble. I feel that such a policy would be definitely wrong and harmful even from the narrowest view of expediency. It would, of course, be against any general principle that we follow. ... Any such attempt would do us injury in many ways. .... I should like you to look into this matter and take steps to rectify any such action which might have been taken...'.

This suggests that, even if the border zones were geographically on the periphery of the new state, politically they were not. Once these regions had been quiet backwaters where the state was a dis- tant presence. But now, paradoxically, the border catapulted them into the closest touch with the state. It has been customary to think of borders as being peripheral to the state. If the centre is the core of the state, where its political, economic and cultural hegemony is strongest, the border has been generally thought of as its opposite, as a terrain where the political power of the state is most comprom- ised.'68 But as we have seen, on the Bengal frontier the relationship between the nation-state and its borders was far more complex, intense and direct than the centre-periphery model would have us expect. Conclusion In the first part of this paper, we saw how the Radcliffe line came to take its final shape. We saw how the making of the border was influ- enced by calculations that often had little to do with communal or even national interest. The arguments and appeals presented before the Boundary Commission demonstrated, if anything, how quickly communal solidarity could fall apart along lines of territory, party, faction and personal ambition when it ran into the reality of parti- tion. If the original purpose of the Bengal partition was indeed to wrest a separate homeland for the Hindu community, it is striking how many Hindus were sacrificed in order to achieve it, and how readily these sacrifices were made. Yet the myth of the homeland had to be kept alive, especially at the border. We saw in the second part of the paper how the border, once defined, quickly became sacrosanct. And it had to be honoured as such by the ordinary village people who happened to live along its path, even at the expense of their homes, their lands, their livelihood and their very lives. If heavy-handed persuasion and even force were '"8 See the introduction by Julian Minghi in Dennis Rumley and Julian Minghi (eds), The Geography of Border Landscapes (London and New York, 1991).</page><page sequence="58">242 JOYA CHATTERJI necessary to extract their compliance, it was justified 'in the national interest'. To return to the discussion of the surgical metaphor with which this paper began: the first half of this essay has shown how inappro- priate it is to consider the drawing of the border as a purely technical affair. The border was not drawn dispassionately, with clinical preci- sion and attention to detail. It was a hastily and ignorantly drawn line, in whose drafting political pressures played no small part. More- over, the political considerations that shaped the drawing up of the border were substantially different from the concerns which had influenced the 3 June plan. In this sense, the politics of partition was far from being over and done with on 3 June or even on 17 August 1947. Partition was a political process which continued to unfold long afterwards, and indeed continues to unfold even today. So partition was in no sense like an operation that was concluded in August 1947. The border is far from being the trace of an event long over, like a healed and fading incision scar. It is still in the process of being formed. Its creation was not merely a matter of drawing a line through a map by a qualified technocrat: it was cre- ated again and again, by a number of different agencies, on the ground through which it ran. Its shape (both literally and metaphorically) has varied, and continues to vary, through time. But it is the second part of this paper which has shown us what is really wrong with the surgical metaphor. We have seen how extraord- inarily violent and crude an instrument the border was. Looked at from the ground, from the eyes of those whose lives it shattered, this violence was the more terrifying because it was irrational, because there was no sense in which it could ever have been rational. Even if in one place the Radcliffe line had not cut this sharecropper off from his field, or separated that woman from her parental home, they would have been the lucky exceptions and their lives undoubtedly would have been damaged in a thousand other ways. The idiom of surgery puts a gloss on this experience. Surgery is pain- ful and bloody, but it serves a purpose-it makes things all right in the end-and the pain of surgery is comprehensible and endurable because of this. By describing the creation of the border in these terms, the violence that was involved in this process (and the destruc- tion that could never be put right) has been contained within an acceptable, comprehensible and even meaningful idiom. The surgical metaphor has thus worked to lend legitimacy and credibility not only to the Radcliffe line but to the very idea of partition itself.</page></plain_text>
