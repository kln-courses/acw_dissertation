<plain_text><page sequence="1">Herbert Fischer THE USE OF GESTURE IN PREPARING MEDICAMENTS AND IN HEALING I. HEALING GESTURE AND FINGER POSITION Today, the study of physical posture has again been brought into a closer relationship to research in pharmaceutic medicine.' Again, that is, for in historical traditions and popular usage, there have long been points of intimate contact between the two. To be sure, these are not at all evident today, but rather must be disclosed and compiled in arduous detailed work. Obviously, the precise forms in which such contiguity is manifested are determined by the respective stage of culture in question and its underlying thera- peutic conceptions. Thus, mythical, magic, religious (in the nar- rower sense of dogma), alchemistic, or rational categories must be applied where appropriate for such interpretation. But one under- lying concept is unmistakable throughout: The administration of medicaments is combined with particular positions or movements of the body and limbs even down to the apparently insignificant finger positions and motions.2 Moreover, such gestures alone have Translated from the German by Joyce Adams. 1 See Die Starnberger Gesprdche. 1960.

A truly immense field of bodily positions and movements presents itself for investigation. All the basic positions of the human figure as a whole-lying, sitting, kneeling, and standing-have a part to play;4 we encounter every form of arm and leg position (crossing, spreading out, reaching upward, wrapping around the body)5 and, above and beyond this, there appears a wealth of combinations of the individual component gestures extending to real acrobatic accomplishments.6 Yet "dislocation of the limbs" is never an end in itself; change of position is regarded much more as the means employed in the healing process.7 plantes magiques (1938), pp. 143-44. Most of the classical writings quoted in this matter have already been mentioned (in another connection) by A. Gornatowski, Rechts und Links im antiken Aberglauben (dissertation, Breslau, 1936), pp. 20-21, 29-30. For basic material see also Th. Echtermeyer, "Proben aus einer Abhandlung iiber Namen und symbolische Bedeutung der Finger bei den Griechen und Romern," Vollstdndige Berichte des Pddagogiums zu Halle (1835). For the use of the fingers in healing gestures of the Germanic tribes, see esp. I. Reichborn- Kjennerud, "Leegeradene i den eldre Edda," Maal og Minne (1923), pp. 36ff.; and his "Eddatidens medisin," Arkiv f. Nord. Filologie XL (1924), 117ff. 3 See H. Fischer, "Heilgebarden," Antaios II (1961), 318ff. 4 Lying (on the ground) has been very widespread in popular usage up to the present (A. Wuttke, Der deutsche Volksaberglaube der Gegenwart [3d ed., by E. H. Meyer, 1900], pp. 94-95, sec. 117). By way of comparison, we shall touch on a similar phenomenon in discussing the alchemist's gestures (standing to symbolize sulfur, the seated position to symbolize salt, etc.). Interestingly, a hunched-over, crouching position indicates "terrestrial" sulfur (see n. 149). Although high cultures may still maintain such primitive forms, the medical magic of primitive peoples often deviates from them; the peculiar "horseback position" of the European sorcerer belongs just as much to this group as do the figures shown in Figs. 1 and 2, one from a South Sumatran medicine man's collection of magical substances found in G. Buschan, iber Medizinzauber und Heilkunst im Lebender Volker (1941), P1. facing p. 209, or its North Sumatran counterpart found in H. Weigert, Kleine Kunstgeschichte der Vorzeit (1956), Fig. 2. Here, not only are healing forces sought directly in the primal ground of life, but even the "followers" of the chthonic are invoked, as shown by the image of the animal grown together with the lower part of the magician's body.

Lauffer, "Die Hexe als Zaunreiterin," Gie/,ener Beitrdge zur deutschen Philologie, LX (1938), 114ff.; and his "Rudol- stadter und Saalfelder Beitrige zu den volkstumlichen Vorstellungen vom Zaun und der Hexe als Zaunreiterin," Mitteldeutsche Bldtter fur Volkskunde, XVI (1941), 18ff. 5 For instance, a Brandenburg folk custom recommends the crossing of the arms and legs as a soporific (Wuttke, op. cit., p. 285, sec. 419. The relaxation of the arms is practiced in rather serious illnesses or febrile diseases (H. Fischer, "Die offene Kreuzhaltung im Rechtsritual," Festschrift fir A. Steinwenter [1958], pp. 33-34. For the upward extension of the arms, see Fischer, "Heilgebarden," op. cit., pp. 334ff. (and, in addition, the example given in n. 148 below). Turning one- self around as part of a more complex gesture is found in Delatte, op. cit., p. 2 (Medea's magic). 6 Certain ritual positions of the old world correspond to the healing methods of Yoga (H. Fischer, "Indogermanischer Kriegeryoga," Festschrift fur W. Heinrich [1962]).

See the school dis- ciplinary measures given by L. Schmitt, Atemheilkunst (3d ed.; 1958), p. 558, Fig. 400 (in which case the therapeutic effect has already been recognized). 8 This type of gesture surpasses in subtlety what is usually called "hand gesture." Thus no special attention will be given to instructions such as those of antiquity for curing nightmares, which advises the victim to fold his hands or make a fist (see W. H. Roscher, "Ephialtes," Abhandlungen der Sdchsischen Gesellschaft der Wissenschaft, XX, No. 2 [1903], p. 20). 9 It is therefore significant for the sphere of primitive law as well (E. Pfleging, "Handen. Den aldsta riitssymbolen," Ord och bild, LX [1951], 436ff). For those gestures in use in the Middle Ages, see K. von Amira, "Die Handgebiirden in den Bilderhandschrift des Sachsenspiegels," Abhandlungen der Bayrischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, XXIII (1905), 163ff. 10 See for the microcosmic organic theories of ancient times the literature mentioned in nn. 140 and 170ff. See at this point n. 14 as well. 11 When this category is interpreted in the broadest sense, it can include methods of tying off or pressing particular fingers or parts of fingers (E. Busse, "Soforthilfe," Erfahrungsheilkunde, V [1956], 14). 12 S. Rodelli, Hdnde- bungen als Heilgymnastik (1961). 13 The peculiar differentiation of an art of finger-dancing as developed in the Far East is probably completely unknown in Europe (see C. Hagemann, "Tanz der Volker," in J. Gentens, Tanz und Reigen [1927], p. 19). 14 See for a general treatment Th. Ohm, Die Gebetsgebdrden der Vilker und das Christentum (1948), pp. 231 ff. E. L. Rochholz, Alemannisches Kinderlied und Kinderspiel (1857), p. 99, says "German law had thus given each finger a particular connection to the deity and the law he had laid down." Also very characteristic is the Biedermeier picture in Fig. 3 (from A. Spamer, Das kleine Andachtsbild vom XIV. zum XX. Jahrhundert [1930], P1. CIII 2). To the attribution in the picture of one of the divine functions to each individual finger, cf. the derogatory com- ments made only two generations later by an exponent of magnetopathic healing, Philipp Walburg Kramer (1815-99): "One school of therapy (more like a parlor- trick) prescribes magnetization to cure complaints of each of the five sense organs with a specific finger: The thumb is to be used for disturbances of the sense of touch; the index finger, for eye trouble; the middle finger, for earache and hearing difficulties; the ring finger, for diseases of the nose; and the little finger, for a sore tongue. According to this system, then, every finger must be the storehouse of a particular healing force!" (Der Heilmagnetismus [3d ed.; 1949], p. 33). This seems to me an underevaluation of the indigenous tradition (E. Richter, "Orientalische 20</page><page sequence="4">broadly as a universal cultic practice.15 Herein exists a definite inner connection to that Far Eastern world of ritual which has conserved better than the Western world the original Indo- European ritual idea in the form of mudrd and hasta.16 Yet even in view of this, the actual correspondence between East and West in the symbolism of finger gestures as it still existed in the Middle Ages is amazing. It extends to areas outside medicine as well;17 for instance, in representations both of Charlemagne18 and of the (equally revered) King of Sahor19 the bridge formed with the middle finger appears as a sign of that regimen esteemed by the charis- matic ruler. Here we can only mention what is characteristic for the realm of healing in order to allow the later exposition to demon- strate more fully the elementary phenomenon of correspondence with which we are dealing here. This correspondence occurs in the symbolism of the physician's service. Without the possibility of an external connection between the two traditions, this function is symbolized in East and West by the same gesture. The thumb and little finger are lifted away from the other three fingers, which are stretched outward or bent down toward the palm.20 The use of this hand position, which is required of the Chinese physician in feeling the pulse, is also car- ried over into self-treatment and self-diagnosis.21 Similarly, in late und kabbalistische Ursprungsbezirke der Geistlichen Hiinde," Deutsche Gaue, XLTTT [1951], 18 ff.). 15 The general underlying concept could perhaps be formulated more approp- riately thus: The expression of the infirmity as tendency toward recovery leads to an invocation of the healing power. From the natural expression, which at first was formed involuntarily and unconsciously, there develops a ritual invocation which corresponds to the original expression with respect to form. See for the present Fischer, "Heilgebirden," op. cit., pp. 328 ff. 16 In the latter connection, see J. Auboyer, "Moudra et hasta ou le langage par signes," Oriental Art, III (1950-51), 153 ff.; and E. D. Saunders, Mudra: A Study of Symbolic Gestures in Japanese Buddhist Sculpture (1960). 17 See Fischer, "Heilgebiirden," op. cit., pp. 321 ff. 18 C. Clemen, "Die Portratdarstellungen Karls des GroBen," Zeitschrift des Aachener Geschichtlichen Vereins, XI (1889), 252; P. E. Schramm, Die deutschen Kaiser und Konige (1928), Vol. I, Fig. 10a. Moreover, the same gesture is ascribed in the early Middle Ages to Christ the King (Majestas Domini) (Lexikon fir Theologie und Kirche [2d ed.], Vol. III, P1. facing col. 1248, Fig. 6). 19 W. Y. Evans-Wentz, Das tibetische Buch der grofen Befreiung (1955), Fig. 1 (preceding title page). King Padma Sambhava attained as the "Great Guru" cultic honors equivalent to the canonization of Charlemagne. 20 When made with fingers bent inward, this gesture usually indicates "posses- sion" of the corresponding ability; with fingers extended, however, it denotes its "application" (in taking the pulse); thus a theoretical and a practical manifestation of the gesture appear in contrast to one another. Their underlying common nature nevertheless becomes more apparent when both variations of the combined thumb and little-finger extension are compared with another gesture symbolizing the "physician." See below, p. 50. 21 Fig. 4, as reproduced from H. Wallnofer and A. v.

For the same gesture was customary, as carved tomb monuments indicate, in the ancient Egyptian "mouth- opening" rite.23 This rite was intended primarily for the symbolic nourishment of the dead with finely prepared food and drink, but was in addition believed to create an "access" to the departed one, to "locate" him in the world beyond.24 Moreover, the emphasis on thumb and little finger becomes evident in other healing customs as well.25 Perhaps even more specific correspondences obtain with respect to the use of the middle finger in preparing medicaments, thus in one of the very fields of the more limited actual subject of the study at hand. In Indonesia the ingredients are taken up with the tip of the middle finger, for which no rational explanation need be sought.26 In Europe we learn of similar customs even beyond the Middle Ages:27 "According to Sir Thomas Browne, ancient doctors customarily mixed their medicaments with the middle finger."28 In Ireland, without exception, salves were spread on boils by means of the middle finger.29 Moreover, we also 22 Leibniz, Collectanea Etymologica CCCXCIX, No. 84 (see Fig. 5). 23 Fig. 6, as reproduced from H. Bonnet, Agyptische Religion; =Haas, Bilder- atlas zur Religionsgeschichte, Vol. II, No. 4 (1924), Fig. 135 (see also E. Otto, Das dgyptische Munddffnungsritual [1960], pp. 20, 65, 93). 24 This aspect is important for the symbolism of the "discoverer," to which we shall return later (see p. 50 below). At this point, I shall begin to stress the com- plexity often to be encountered in later occurrences of precisely these fundamental symbols. E.g., the symbolic meaning of the little finger is carried over from the "body" to "property" (see n. 106), while retaining the associationwiththe stomach. This takes place in a single intact rite (n. 241). In the mouth-opening ritual, the complexity consists in the participation of the little finger not only as a "nourish- ing finger" (a widespread symbolic role; e.g., the little finger is employed thus in the obtaining of milk by the boy Abraham n. 83; see also n. 197) and as "trail- blazer" or "discoverer" (a role which originated still earlier), but also as a "son" (cf. n. 196, below, with n. 107). In the last-named capacity, it indicates how child- like piety finds the way to the deceased parents in order to provide them with food and drink. 25 K. Knortz, Der menschliche K6rper (1909), p. 157, says, "Galician Jews believe that a case of scrofula disappears as soon as a bechor (first-born) touches it with his thumb and little finger." See n. 235 below. 26 W. Weck, Heilkunde und Volkstum auf Bali (1937), p. 229. 27 It is probably a misinterpretation caused by the ambiguous appellation digitus medicinalis (see at this point nn. 34, 35 ff. and 72), which prompts W. Grimm ("Uber die Bedeutung der deutschen Fingernamen," Kleinere Schriften [1883], III, 442) to connect with the ring finger rather than with the middle finger the old interpretation given by Henisch: "medicus dictus, quod prisci medici miscerent eo pharmaca." 28 H.

In like manner, according to Persius II, pp. 32-33, the wet nurse protects the child with saliva applied by means of the third finger (see S. Seligmann, Der b6se Blick und Verwandtes [1910], I, 295; II, 184). 31 C. Sittl, Die Gebdrden der Griechen und R6mer (1890), p. 123. 32 Fig. 7, from Robertus de Fluctibus, De chiromantia in genere, reproduced from A. Rosenberg, Zeichen am Himmel (1949), p. 129, Fig. 6. Even in classical anti- quity, the middle finger is called simply "medicus" and not "medicinalis" (Gornatowski, op. cit., p. 30, n. 179). Interestingly, present-day physicians also apply the term "medicus" to the middle finger (F. Volgyesi, Die Seele ist alles [1948], p. 24). 33 In addition to the subsequent discussion in this article see n. 14 above. 34 The Germanic tribes generally refer to it as a healing finger (Grimm, op. cit., pp. 441 ff.; E. Goldmann, Neue Beitrdge zur Geschichte des frdnkischen Rechts [1928], pp. 108 ff.). 35 Previously discussed only by Gornatowski (op. cit., p. 30, n. 179). See also n. 72. 36 Cassius Felix, De medicina, c. 43: "curationis vero tempore flebotomia in manu sinistra adhibita circa medium digitum minorem desinit splenis extantia." V. Rose adds to this in his edition of Cassius, p. 233, the note: "s. v. digiti: i.e. anularem" (Gal. XI, 296). M. Hofler gives the following rather strange explanation in his Volksmedizinische Botanik der Germanen (1908), p. 14: "The ring finger is the middle or physician's finger ... The middle finger was once called the 'Lachener"' (healing finger. Cf. AS. lsece). For a discussion of the latter designation, to be sure as applied to the ring finger, see esp. Goldmann, loc. cit. 37 See n. 125 below. 38 Not only the ring but also the middle finger are quite obviously characterized by Marcellus XXXII, sec. 5, as digiti medicinales. See n. 72 below. 39 Echtermeyer, op. cit., pp. 21-22. The designation "impudicus," also derived from classical antiquity, is used in the Lex Thuringorum 5, 8 and in the eleventh century in a law of Henry I as well (Grimm, op. cit. p. 438). 40 For a discussion of the fundamentals, see Fischer, "Heilgebarden," op. cit., pp. 320-21. 23</page><page sequence="7">The Use of Gesture in Preparing Medicaments and in Healing sensation experienced in the hand and thus take on a therapeutic function determined specifically by the nature of the disturbance which had led to the illness. II. GESTURE AND THE PREPARATION OF MEDICAMENTS The simplest relationships within the realm of phenomena dis- cussed here obtain for the custom of using particular gestures in the very acquisition of medicaments. Most important here is the taking up of medicinal herbs or of animals to be used in healing. Bridges formed with the fingers, that is, by touching one of the fingers with the thumb, are especially significant. Thus, according to an ancient custom, the lizard was to be picked up with a bridge formed by the ring finger of the right hand.41 In classical antiquity most medicinal plants were also to be plucked with this gesture, although, to be sure, the left hand was used.42 Further- more, the fingers were held in the same position in Anglo-Saxon usage for collecting mulberries (for curing hemorrhages).43 It might be added that an ancient Indian expiatory ritual demands as a "curative punishment"44 the gathering of the penitent's "pigeon fodder," probably with the bridge of the ring finger.45 At first, the mere concern for precise, cautious selection and retention might be assumed as the reason for such a finger position. But aside from the fact that the "fingertip grasp" is more com- fortable and secure when one of the remaining fingers is used,46 other formulas make it very clear that achieving a precise grip is not at all the determining factor.47 According to classical teachings, henbane had even to be dug up with the ring finger and thumb 41 Pseudo-Theodorus add., p. 282, 30 ff.: "stellionem manu dextra ... pollice et digito medicinali prende." In this author's works, medicinalis is doubtless to be interpreted as "ring finger." See Gornatowski, op. cit., pp. 20-21. For medicinal uses of the lizard in classical antiquity, see, e.g., the hanging of this animal above a patient as described by Marcellus XXIII, sec. 50; also the mention of incineration in n. 129 below. 42 Plinius Naturalis Historia XXIII, 110; Marcellus XIV, sec. 65, 52; XXXI, sec. 33; Ps. Theod. add. 283, 1; Alex. Trallianus II, 584. See Gornatowski, op. cit., p. 29; Delatte, op. cit., p. 143. 43 E. Goldmann, Chrenecruda (1931), p. 66. 44 See, in connection with the poenae medicinales, Fischer, "Heilgebarden," op. cit., p. 319; for the use of gestures in carrying out such punishment, see Fischer, "Kreuzhaltung," op. cit., pp. 37 ff. 45 Baudhdyanadharmasutra III, 2, 15, refers only to the use of two fingers in gathering (W. Gampert, Die Sihnezeremonien in der altindischen Rechtsliteratur [1939], p. 192, n. 2). However, in other related expiatory rites, the ring-finger bridge, even the ring finger alone may be used. See nn. 217-18 below. 46 Cf. p. 34 with nn. 118 ff. 47 Delatte, op. cit., 144, notes only: "Dans toutes les recettes, l'intention domine de servir des doigts qui sont les moins 'profanes."' For the fingertip grasp itself cf. p. 28 below with n. 73. 24</page><page sequence="8">alone,48 a tedious procedure indeed. Ribwort might be dug up as desired, but immediately afterward, a spell was to be cast on the roots with the ring finger.49 It is the quality of "purity"50 attri- buted by all cultures to the ring finger which here is the obvious decisive factor. It need only be made clear how a particular ritual motif can become associated with an extremely general rule of procedure. For the ancient Indian expiatory ritual mentioned above, the chief concern was that the penitent not be allowed to gather his means of subsistence "with the entire hand"; but the symbolic value of the ring finger to a man living for purification inevitably brought about, in time, the finger differentiation. The gatherer of medicinal herbs followed a different chain of reasoning. He also gathered poisonous and dangerous plants which were able to cause harm when used inappropriately: the removal of all that boded ill, the cleansing from every flaw is therefore extremely important to the gatherer.51 Thus a gap in associative reasoning is bridged so that the particular conception of the ring finger as a healing finger emerges. It must only be kept in mind that here the healing effects arise from a purity of the soul,52 while those of the middle finger, the ring finger's most prominent rival, are awaited as from the source of life.53 The thumb and little finger, again, have a still different effect, according to the teachings of antiquity, one which we have already encountered in the gesture denoting the physician's service.54 Finally, the influence of the index finger 48 Th. Hopfner, Griechisch-dgyptischer Offenbarungszauber (1921), p. 122, sec. 485. 49 M. Hofler, Volksmedizinische Botanik der Germanen (1908), p. 14; A. Haber- landt, "Magie im Volksglauben und Volksbrauch," in Mdchte des Schicksals (1953), p. 273. Still further removed from the act of obtaining medicaments is the exten- sion of the ring finger in the therapeutic application of the root (n. 168 below). 50 For Occidental symbolism, see Grimm, op. cit., p. 446; Rochholz, op. cit., p. 105; M. R. Buck, Medicinischer Volksglauben und Volksaberglauben in Schwaben (1865), p. 25. For the Far East, see nn. 215-16 below. In the Greek church, the bridge formed with the ring finger is still used for the bestowal of blessings (Ohm, op. cit., p. 295). Here, understandably, the particular connection to the Logos is the decisive factor (n. 211 below). 51 Similarly, Hofler (op. cit., p. 14) has already pointed out in connection with the use of the ring finger to cast a spell on ribwort that "its magic power must not cause harm to the digger of roots." However, the ring finger is used not only by the extractor of rhizomes but also by the healer, namely, in administering medicinal roots. See n. 168 below. 52 The ring finger still symbolizes the soul in the procedure set down in modern legal documents for the taking of oaths and in the printed oaths which were hung in magistrates' offices until recently (see Freiherr E. v. KiinBberg, Schwurgebdrde und Schwurfingerdeutung [1941], pp. 3ff.; H. Baltl, "Steirische Eidtafeln," Zeitschrift des historischen Vereins fur Steiermark, XLVII [1956], 11 ff.). For the symbolism of purity, see also n. 219 below. 53 For a discussion of the fundamentals see H. Fischer, "Leben und Tod in alter Mittelfingersymbolik," Basler Nachrichten, Vol. LIV, 1960, Sonntagsbeilage No. 462. 54 The influence of the thumb is felt to come from the primal source of love: the little finger represents corporeality. See nn. 231, 241-42. 25</page><page sequence="9">The Use of Gesture in Preparing Medicaments and in Healing has yet another source, the primal significance of which derives from its use to symbolize impulse.55 But at the outset our pre- sentation of the material must keep the pharmaceutical connection in the foreground. The employment of a bridge with the little finger for the gather- ing of herbs is much less frequently prescribed, although a gesture in this form has been maintained up to the present for particular therapeutic purposes without any material accompaniment.56 Nevertheless, the same classical writing which mentions the gathering of herbs with the bridge of the ring finger calls especially for the combination of thumb and little finger for the young sprouts of bitter rue.57 And, moreover, the connection to this particular plant is in itself very significant for the underlying rationale of the gesture. For just as rue represents an herb especially favored for sexual purposes,58 so in East and West the bridge of the little finger has also served to indicate this realm.59 Still other plants, whose symbolic connection is less apparent, should surely be included here. Thus in the Anglo-Saxon locutio per signa, the little-finger bridge is the gesture symbolizing cress.60 The pantomime of other religious houses has passed on to us the little-finger bridge as a sign for lentil.61 A dynamic form of the 55 See nn. 85, 101. 56 See Fischer, "Heilgebiirden," op. cit., pp. 322-23. 57 Ps. Theod. add. 321, 20-21: "cymulas rutae pollice et minimo dextrae manus lege." See Gornatowski, op. cit., p. 20; Delatte, op. cit., p. 143. 58 Rue is used to cure female complaints of all kinds. Moreover, it is laid by the bride in her shoe, a gesture well known in erotic symbolism (Wuttke-Meyer, op. cit., p. 103, sec. 133). 59 In order to regain his full sexual prowess, a man must relieve his bladder through a ring formed by the bridge of the little finger (Buck, op. cit., p. 25; G. Lammert, Volksmedizin und medizinischer Aberglaube in Bayern [1869], p. 153). The occasional substitution here of the bridge of the index finger for that of the little finger (Buck, op. cit., p. 46) is explained by the procreative symbolism of the index finger (n. 101 below). At a rendezvous, an Arabian girl was required to hold a glass for her lover "between the thumb and little finger (with the remaining fingers bent inward)" (M. Quedenfeldt, Verhandlungen der Berliner Gesellschaft fur Anthropologie [1890], p. 330). A comparable use of the little-finger bridge in India is mentioned by Fischer, "Heilgebarden," op. cit., p. 323 (with P1. 6, Fig. 10). For further little-finger symbolism in wedding customs see A. Baumann, Das doppelte Geschlecht (1958), pp. 302-3; H. Fischer, "Die eheliche Verantwortung und das Schultersymbol," Antaios I (1959), 205, n. 60. Gestures of the little finger associated with free sexuality are mentioned by R. Engelhardt, Das Wissen von der Hand (1932), p. 57. 60 Indicia monasterialia IX, 63: "Cesana tacen is paet mon sette his puman on his litlan finger foreweardne" (F. Kluge, "Zur Geschichte der Zeichensprache," Internationale Zeitschrift fur allgemeine Sprachwissenschaft, II [1885], 123). 61 While the tip of the thumb was to be held under the outermost segment of the index finger in making the sign for "pea," it was placed in the sign for "lentil" under the corresponding segment of the little finger (G. Schmutz, "Die Gebiirden- sprache der Kluniazenser und Hirsauer," Bldtter fiur Taubstummenbildung, XXXVI [1923], p. 353). According to Schmutz, the bringing together of index finger and the thumb also served to indicate the "bean," but here the tip of the 26</page><page sequence="10">same gesture served to indicate mustard, insofar that in the second part of the "mustard" gesture (the first consists of directing one fist into the bent mid-joints of the other fist) the thumb must jump out before the first segment of the little finger.62 Now if the lentil is related to biblical tradition,63 this is true in the greater degree of the little finger, as indicated by a Babylonian healing ritual,64 since for King Rehoboam the scorpion and the little finger corres- pond to one another as do the whip and the lions.65 Greco-Roman antiquity, regarding the little finger as sacred to Mercury,66 associated it with the scorpion.67 Since this animal, as Zodion, "governed" the sex organs, according to the teaching of Nechepso- Petosiris,68 the above-mentioned symbolic relationships of the little finger are brought finally into a closed circle.69 Moreover, the bridge formed with the middle finger is also significant for ritual herb-gathering even into the Middle Ages.70 But, like the little-finger bridge, it does not attain the importance of the ring-finger bridge, although the middle finger is strongly emphasized in other healing customs71 and could even contest the claim of the ring finger to the ritual function digitus medicinalis.72 index finger was placed under the first segment of the thumb so that the thumb, not the index finger, protruded. See also p. 32 below. 62 Schmutz, op. cit., p. 353. 63 For the connection of the pottage of lentils with primogeniture, see p. 32 below. 64 The patient had to extract a scorpion with his little finger from a small kaolin hut (M. Riemschneider, Augengott und Heilige Hochzeit [1953], p. 97). 65 I Kings 12:10, 11. 66 Echtermeyer, op. cit., p. 7; E. Stemplinger, Antiker Volksglaube (1948), p. 209. 67 See W. Deonna, "Mercure et le scorpion," Coll. Latomus, XXXVII (1959). 68 O. Schissel-Fleschenberg, "Eine kosmische Ausdeutung des menschlichen K6rpers," Wiener Studien, LXI-LXII (1943-47), 95. 69 We shall return later to a still more elementary symbolism for the little- finger bridge (n. 250 below). Here, however, see also n. 108. 70 In the "Little Garden of Paradise" of the Master of the Upper Rhine, the use of the middle-finger bridge is still represented for the plucking and collecting of fruit (Fig. 8, reproduced from G. Hartlaub, "Das Paradeisgiirtlein," Der Kunst- brief, 18, Pls. 1, 4). For this usage in classical antiquity see the material presented by Gornatowski, op. cit., p. 29, n. 177. 71 See Fischer, "Heilgebarden," op. cit., p. 320; and my "Der AderlafB. Eine spatgotische Buchillustration," Zeitschrift fiur drztliche Fortbildung, L (1961), 794-95. The fundamental significance of this finger will have to be mentioned often in the subsequent discussion, especially in n. 223 below. 72 Both fingers can, however, be used simultaneously in a double bridge, as stipulated in the instructions for the gathering of camomile given by Pseudo Apuleius XXIII, sec. 2 (Delatte, op. cit., pp. 143-44); for another use in obtaining medicaments, see Marcellus XXXII, sec. 5; Gornatowski (op. cit., p. 30, n. 179), wishes to include, besides the ring finger, not only the middle finger but also the thumb in discussing this usage. However, in naming specifically the forms of the fingertip grasp or the finger bridge, the role of the thumb need not be stressed particularly. Therefore, as a rule, such descriptions have occasion only to emphasize the role of one or more of the other four fingers. Reichborn-Kjennerud ("Loegeradene," p. 39) had also at first contested that the middle finger, too, appeared as a healing finger; only a year later, he was forced to retract this protest 27</page><page sequence="11">The Use of Gesture in Preparing Medicaments and in Healing What we must assume, at least for the bridge with the index finger, is perhaps also true for that of the middle finger: The "fingertip grasp"73 of the thumb with the index finger, or at any rate with the middle finger, is frequently employed for taking hold of very small objects. The bridge formed by the thumb with either of these two fingers has been mentioned so seldom in connection with the act of gathering for the obvious reason that it corresponds to the normal pattern of behavior, while the ring- and little-finger bridges are markedly unusual gestures. Still, the interpolations in Apuleius prescribe the gathering of cinquefoil with the middle finger and thumb;74 the Antidotarium Bruxellense (II, 154) makes the same stipulation for the violet.75 Apart from medicinal usage, moreover, the gathering of fruits, leaves, and blades of grass has a special connection here because of the view, widespread in sym- bolic thought, of the middle finger as a "harvest finger."76 This finger in its most elementary meaning symbolizes the very mani- festation of life, thus also the fulfilment of every natural matura- tion process.77 In classical texts, the bridge formed with the index finger even gives way in part to the middle-finger bridge.78 But illustrative material provides considerable evidence for its use; Hygieia her- self, the personification of health care, holds up with this gesture ("Eddatidens medisin," p. 118, n. 2)! R. Ganszyniec ("Welches ist der 'taLCptKo &amp;aKrvAos," Byzantinisch-Neugriechische Jahrbiicher, I [1920], 342) is obviously greatly impressed by the Eastern tradition, which always stresses the ring finger (see the Greek Orthodox gesture of blessing and n. 50 above). 73 F. J. J. Buytendijk, Allgemeine Theorie der menschlichen Haltung und Bewegung (1956), p. 187. The fundamental characteristic of the "refined grasp" is treated very thoroughly in F. Kiener, Hand, Gebdrde und Charakter (1962), pp. 188 ff. 74 Ps. Apuleius II, sec. 12. 75 Delatte, op. cit., p. 143. 76 The middle finger "represents gathering" (Knortz, op. cit., p. 159). 77 In the study mentioned in n. 53, an attempt has already been made to work out this idea for the sphere of religion. Important additions from the "secular" realm of kingship are made in my-as yet unpublished-"Manifestatio" of the Thirteenth German Legal Historians' Convention, held in Saarbriicken in 1960. 78 According to Quintilianus Institutio oratoria XI, 3, 92, the bridge formed with the middle finger was the most common of all finger gestures for the Romans: "est autem gestus ille maxime communis, quo medius digitus in pollicem contrahitur explicitis tribus." Unfortunately, scholarly writing has neglected this important piece of evidence which, nonetheless, must be an essential clue to the occurrence of the middle-finger bridge in other texts. Thus it appears as used for apotropaic purposes in Ovid Fasti V, 433: "signaque dat digitis medio cum pollice iunctis." Even in Echtermeyer (op. cit., p. 32) is found the mistaken interpretation of the "fig" gesture which has been perpetuated; see the text edition by H. Peter (3d ed.; 1889), p. 235 or V1. Riffer, "Sykophantes," Indogermanische Forschungen, XXX (1912), 389. But for the fig, the middle finger is not joined with the thumb, but rather the thumb is extended between the index and middle fingers (see also n. 173 below). 28</page><page sequence="12">the medicament blessed by the serpent of healing.79 From medieval sources we also learn of connections to plant symbolism,80 in regard to which the historical significance of the legumes for the realm of medicine must be considered.81 The elementary concep- tions are most easily understood if the symbolism quite clearly expressed in the finger realms of an old children's saying is taken into consideration.82 Here, to be sure, the middle finger appears kathexochen the finger for gathering, but only in the sense of "bringing in," not for consumption. That is, the little finger83 "eats the plums all alone," while "the middle finger, according to the well-known children's rhyme puts the plums in the sack."84 The index finger is assigned its characteristic role, for it is the inter- mediary of impulses:85 "It shakes the plums." Furthermore, in some versions the labor of harvesting is still more precisely divided: Only the actual gathering (cutting, etc.) is the duty of the middle finger, while the job of piling-up the fruit falls to the ring finger86 in analogy to its symbolic function, namely, the unearthing and storing of both material and spiritual treasures.87 79 Fig. 9: late Roman ivory carving (Liverpool) reproduced from K. Kerenyi, Der g6ttliche Arzt (1956), p. 59, Fig. 34. 80 See in this connection n. 61 above; the complex nature of this symbolism will be discussed further below. 81 F. Olck, "Bohne," Realenzyklopddie der klassischen Altertumswissenschaft (ed. Pauly, Wissowa, and Kroll (Stuttgart, 1939)), Vol. III, cols. 613 ff. 82 See Grimm, op. cit., pp. 449-50; Rochholz, op. cit., p. 108; Buck, op. cit., p. 24; Knortz, op. cit., pp. 154, 159. 83 This appears even in ancient times as the nourishing finger. See, e.g., the legend of Abraham in E. Zehren, Das Testament der Sterne (1957), p. 190; or the vase-painting representing Hercules at a meal in A. Gromer, Kunst des Abend- landes (1955), I, 39, Fig. 175 (here Fig. 10). See also n. 239 below. 84 Knortz, op. cit., p. 159. 85 This conception was expressed in the older symbolic tradition chiefly through the connection of the index finger with lightning, since lightning was regarded as the supreme bearer to earth of impulses from the heavens (see also n. 101 below). Zeus himself balances the lightning on his index finger in classical representations (Archdologische Zeitung, Vol. XLII [1884], P1. 6). Medieval and moder popular belief sees in the extended finger the possibility of attracting lightning (Buck, op. cit., p. 24; W. Gaerte, Rheinisches Jahrbuch fiir Volkskunde [1952], III, 265). See also a discussion of this custom in A. Reith, Der Blitz in der bildenden Kunst (1953), p. 13. This symbolism is not peculiar to the Occident; in the case of the deities of the Mahayana, the thunderbolt is also combined with the extension of the index finger (tarjanika) (W. Kirfel, Symbolik des Buddhismus [1959], pp. 71, 87, 102-3). See, in addition, n. 143 below and, esp. for the symbol of order, n. 184. 86 "Licker shakes down the plums, Longman gathers them, Goldfinger carries them home..." (Grimm, op. cit., p. 450). An analogous division made by the Swabian tradition is mentioned in Buck, op. cit., p. 24. 87 Here a solar symbolism of the ring finger emerges, esp. as attributed to Apollo in classical antiquity (Echtermeyer, op. cit., p. 7;1 Stemplinger, op. cit. p. 209), for "the determination of punishment is given over to the Apollo of Delphi when a treasure was lifted up by an unauthorized person" (W. Knoch, Die Strafbestimmungen in Platons Nomoi [1960], p. 130; cf. Nomoi XI, 914a). In folk tales the turning of the ring on the fourth finger is a traditional means of gaining treasure or fulfilling similar wishes. The significance of this finger also for spiritual 29</page><page sequence="13">The Use of Gesture in Preparing Medicaments and in Healing Now we have almost arrived at the ancient symbolic series found in all cultures of the world: Index finger=spirit; middle finger=life; ring finger=soul; little finger=body.88 But the thumb, which governs the attribute of love,89 serves as a basis for all the other categories in the characteristic gesture which each finger bridge presents.90 Thus the bridge formed by the thumb and the "finger of the spirit" understandably symbolizes the intellectual healing art of the god of medicine just as the gesture characteristic of Hygieia corresponds to her nature. When used without an accompanying object, the bridge of the index finger serves to indicate the har- monizing of the intellectual nature of man.91 Furthermore, in an organic context, the index finger as "finger of the spirit" is at the same time the "finger of the head,"92 which necessarily renders the gestures made with it valuable in rituals used to cure head- ache.93 The index-finger bridge, as such, is also mentioned in this treasures is doubtless to be understood in terms of the association of the heart with the sun; for according to a classical theory disseminated further in the Middle Ages, a fine artery connected the ring finger with the heart. This explains for instance the fact that in a late creation legend, only two acts of Prometheus are mentioned: the creation of man and the institution of a ring for the ring finger: "ut in quarto digito, quem medicum vocant, poneretur ad ornatum, digniorem hunc reliquis dicens, quia ab eo usque ad cor quaedam vena pertingit" (Petri Comestoris, Historia Scholastica [2d ed.; Venice, 1729], p. 89). The ring finger as a symbol of the "precious soul" is often mentioned in the rural legal documents. See, e.g., the "Taiding von Miirktl," Osterreichische Weistiimer, VI, 390. 88 The associations of interest mentioned here will be discussed individually (esp. nn. 230 ff.). 89 See n. 231. "Love" is meant here as a polar category which embraces good- ness and strength (Fischer, "Heilgebirden," op. cit., p. 321). See also nn. 246 ff. in this connection. 90 Even up to the present, mother love is represented symbolically as a base: "In Oldenburg, if a child cannot find a place to sit, his mother says to him, 'Sit on my thumb; no one has ever fallen down from there"' (Knortz, op. cit., p. 158). Mary's thumb plays a similar role for the child Jesus in icons of the type Mater de perpetuo succursu. 91 See Fischer, "Heilgebarden," op. cit., p. 325. Even in ancient Egypt, this gesture is used specifically for "harmony" in the musical sense (F. Weege, Der Tanz in der Antike [1926], p. 23, Fig. 21; J. Spiegel, Das Werden der altdgyptischen Hochkultur [1953], P1. 53b). A temple relief from Sparta portrays Apollo holding the lyre and displaying the bridge of the index finger (N. Himmelmann-Wild- schiitz, "Spendende Gotter," Antaios, Vol. I [1959], P1. 6, Fig. 2). 92 According to some sources, the finger of Jupiter governs the realm "head and neck" (Engelhardt, op. cit., p. 115). On the other hand, if the index finger is effective in curing eye diseases (Kramer, op. cit., p. 33; see n. 14 above), then its significance as lightning finger (n. 85 above) makes itself felt, since look and light- ning were considered to parallel one another (as shown by the German word Blick and Blitz). 93 See Fischer, "Heilgebarden," op. cit., p. 325. Even the simplest gestures demonstrate this association; the shaking of the index finger thus corresponds to the shaking of the head (M. Quedenfeldt, Verhandlungen der Berliner Gesellschaft fir Anthropologie [1890], p. 331). The specific symbolism of these gestures for insanity is discussed in Sittl, op. cit., p. 115.

Mon., IX, 62: "Gyf pu beana habban wille, ponne sete pui pinne scytefinger foreweardne on pines ipuman forman lide." For the general symbolism of the bean see finally Th. Klausner (Ph. Rech), "Bohne," Reallexikon fur Antike und Christentum, II, 490 ff. 96 Clemens of Alexandria passed on this tradition (Stromata III, 24, 2) in Christian times: "Among the Pythagoreans and their followers circulated the verse: 'It is as horrible to eat beans as to devour your parents' heads"' (Klauser, op. cit., p. 496). Yet, on the other hand, the "child's head" also corresponds to the bean (J. J. Bachofen, Das Mutterrecht [3d ed.; 1948], II, 879). In both cases the symbolism of the succession of generations appears as well (see n. 101 below). There existed also in classical times the superstition that 'if you put a bean in a new box and cover it forty days with dung, you will find it again transformed into a human face" (Klauser, op. cit., p. 493). 97 In Athens and Thebes, beans were used in the election of the magistrates (Bachofen, op. cit., I, 387, n. 2; Klauser, op. cit., p. 492). 98 Johannes Lydus (4, 42) reported "that in March the Romans spread bean mash on their faces in honor of Mars, to whom the bean was sacred because of its connection with the blood" (Klauser, op. cit., p. 491). Besides the associations with the blood and with Mars, the connection to the human head is significant. 99 This results chiefly from the association of the index finger with the ethereal element, since, according to the theory of humors, that element corresponded to the blood (see p. 46, n. 201 below). It is, however, also implicit here that primarily the "intellectual" significance of the blood is indicated; according to its "signi- ficance for the soul" (hematic theory of the soul), blood is connected by the greater part of the tradition with the ring finger, and finally, according to its "significance for the body," with the little finger. One aspect of the association of the index finger with the blood due to its intellectual character is, e.g., its connection with war, the god of war, and the warrior caste (while the thumb is associated with priesthood; the middle finger, with the peasantry). 100 F. G. Groschuff, Abhandlung von den Fingern (1756), p. 57; Echtermeyer, op. cit., p. 7; Stemplinger, op. cit., p. 201. Other aspects of this finger explain its attribution to Jupiter and Mercury. 101 See, e.g., W. Gaerte, Rheinisches Jahrbuch fur Volkskunde III (1952), 266, n. 241. Even today, the act of copulation is symbolized by a gesture in which the index finger is brought into the hollow formed by holding the opposite hand loosely in a fist. For classical antiquity, the symbolism of procreation was also embraced by the concept "lightning finger" (n. 85 above). See H. Cohen, Zeitschrift fur Volkerpsychologie VI (1869), 113-14; K. Ker6nyi, Archiv fiir Religionswissen- schaft XXVI (1938), 322 ff. Moreover, association with lightning also demonstrates that, here, the intellectual aspect of fertilization was stressed, while the middle finger as a phallic symbol emphasized the preservation of life as a function of reproduction (n. 225 below). Furthermore, the attribution of the index finger to the warrior caste mentioned just above is related to the symbolism of pro- creation (see G. Dumezil, Aspects de la fonction guerriere chez les Indo-Europeens [1956], p. 63 [supervirilite of human and divine warriors; the god of war "with 1000 testicles"]). 2--H.O.R. 31</page><page sequence="22">The Use of Gesture in Preparing Medicaments and in Healing a further connection to the bean,102 which can represent either these acts103 or the organs participating in them.104 Even this single example demonstrates with what a multiplicity of symbolic interconnections a discussion of the peculiar finger gestures must deal. Nevertheless, there can be perceived a con- sistent system of attribution not only for the index finger as symbolic of the bean but equally for the lentil as represented by the little-finger bridge,105 for the little finger symbolizes pro- perty,106 on the one hand and, on the other, the right of "juniority."107 This fact demonstrates most clearly why it should be a pottage of lentils with which the younger brother purchases the right of primogeniture and thus the inheritance.108 We shall 102 The bridge made with the same finger has among others a corresponding use; cf. n. 59 above with n. 61. 103 "The bean is wholly procreation" (Klauser, op. cit., p. 492). 104 "The single shelled bean resembles the female aidos just as the peeled bean resembles the male genitals" (ibid.). Thus it becomes possible to represent symbolically "the zpr-pvia concealing the male semen" (Bachofen, op. cit., pp. 875-76). 105 See n. 61 above. 106 This is clearly a function of its elementary significance as the finger of the body (n. 241 below), for "the body and property go together" (E. Graf and M. Dietherr, Deutsche Rechtssprichworter [2d ed.; 1869], p. 153, no. 69). Still farther in the background is the attribution to the little finger of the element "earth" (n. 195). If a gypsy wishes to purchase something cheaply, he first touches it with his little finger (Knortz, op. cit., p. 159). And in this connection, "moving the little finger of the right hand" means "the stranger is searching for a stolen object" (G. GroB, Handbuch der Kriminalistik [9th ed.; (by E. Seelig), 1954], II, 57. In the early Middle Ages, amputation of the little finger was associated with mis- demeanors involving property (F. Liebermann, Die Gesetze der Angelsachsen [1903], I, 191 [Edmund III, 4]). Even today, a denial of material demands employs the expression: "Not as much as in my little finger" (P. Wigand, Der menschliche Korper in Munde des deutschen Volkes [1899], p. 28). Mishandling the little finger (as in cutting the nails) results in poverty (I. Low, "Die Finger in Litteratur und Folklore der Juden," Gedenkbuch fiir D. Kaufmann [1900], p. 82). 107 Bachofen, op. cit., II, 545-46. As Bachofen has explained, this symbolic role also arises from the fundamental symbolism of property. It is also related to other symbolic aspects of the little finger such as that of "Junkerfinger" (alluding to the order of succession in the old nobility). See Grimm, op. cit., p. 448: "Henisch and Stieler call it the Junkerfinger because it is regarded as the last born; kenkes in the dialect of Aachen is most easily explained as a derivation from kenk = Kind (child). Finally, the little finger has this name in Sanskrit and Persian according to Pott, pp. 285, 287." The last reference here is to F. Pott, Die quinare und vigesimale Zdhlmethode bei Volkern aller Weltteile (1847), esp. pp. 225 ff. See also nn. 179, 196 below. 108 Gen. 25:34. If the "pottage of lentils" for which the rights of primogeniture were squandered has (understandably) been proverbial for the trivial, the gesture under discussion obtains added significance, for the concept "trivia" is illustrated by the gesture of joining the nail tips of the thumb and little finger (G. Pitre, Usi e costumi [1889], II, 361). A further relationship proceeds from the symbolic portrayal by Esau and Jacob of the primal colors of sexual polarity: masculine red and feminine white (H. Fischer, "Rot und WeiB als Fahnenfarben," Antaios IV [1962], pp. 147-48; p. 153, n. 32). As a counterpart of solar, masculine red, feminine white belongs to the moon, which is attributed to the little finger. (The mons lunae is still looked for at the base of the little finger.) Chiromythically, then, the lentil symbol appears indirectly combined with the "white" figure of Jacob. 32</page><page sequence="23">refrain from mentioning the other astounding connections which could be demonstrated here in order to resume the central train of thought. Finally, the great pharmaceutical significance of the hand, as such, for an age thinking in terms of myth is demonstrated by Chiron who, as the inventor of therapeutic treatment with herbs, was not named for these but rather for his hand.109 Besides medicaments of animal and vegetable origin, still other substances, such as dew, rainwater, mud, farm soil, mold, and masonry sulfur, are gathered with special gestures in ancient natural medicine and in present-day popular medicine. According to certain Belgian customs, even water which has condensed on windowpanes is to be taken up with the middle finger in an attempt to cure dry scab and other skin diseases.110 We are already on the borderline between the category "acquisition of medicaments," and the essentially different category "therapeutic treatment." For the latter, the main emphasis is on the curative effect on diseased parts of the body of particular finger positions which occur subsequently, with no accompanying object, and without the use of any material substance, while in the instances con- sidered previously the fingers and the particular forms of combin- ing them were merely an aid in obtaining medicaments. To this borderline category belongs, for instance, the spreading of saliva collected on the middle finger upon limbs which have "gone to sleep."111 In proceeding we find as a healing custom the touch of the middle finger without the use of any medicaments: The apotropaic or curative power of this finger is the only influence felt here.112 In a gesture representing a further step in this direc- tion, the healer stretches out his middle finger toward his patient without touching him.113 Diametrically opposed to this healing 109 P. Kretschmar, "Mythische Namen," Glotta, X (1920), 59-60; H. Usener, Gotternamen (3d ed.; 1948), p. 157. The invocation of a "five-fingered woman" for the therapeutic use of herbs and roots in a Slavic rite is mentioned by E. Gasparini in "Le symbole de la main aux doigts ecartes," Atti dell' VIII Congresso Inte- nationale di Storia delle Religioni 1955 (1956), p. 386. The physician Philon called the medicaments he prepared "hands of the gods" (Pott, op. cit., p. 295; Reich- born-Kjennerud, "Eddatidens medisin", p. 118). 110 W.

For usage of the spreading of saliva with the middle finger in classical antiquity, see n. 30 above. 112 Thus the rose (Herpes zoster) is simply stroked "three times crosswise with the middle finger" (K. E. Haase, "Volksmedizin in der Graftschaft Ruppin," Zeitschrift des Vereins fur Volkskunde, VII [1897], 411, no. 30). 113 A usage especially prevalent in the healing rituals of the charismatic ruler, in which connection see the monograph mentioned in n. 223 below. A blessing with the middle finger (although within the framework of a more complicated finger position involving a double bridge formed with the ring and the little finger) 33</page><page sequence="24">The Use of Gesture in Preparing Medicaments and in Healing gestureTl4 is the extension of the middle finger by the patient himself1l5 in order to awaken his own powers of regeneration or to come into contact with superpersonal healing agents,16 in par- ticular with cosmic "healing streams."117 But let us continue for the time being to consider the methods of preparing medicaments. Even for the simple act of gathering herbs, the rationale of a convenient method of working (the fingertip grasp), did not form the point of departure. This is demonstrated not only by the practices which have already been discussedll8 but also by the equally long-standing custom which employs merely the extended finger for the same act of gather- ing.1l9 An act carried out conveniently when the middle-finger bridge is employed is much more difficult to perform solely with the aid of the extended middle finger.120 The girl in the rain rite de- is used in the Greek church (E. Fehrenbach, "Benir," in Dictionnaire d'archeologie chretienne et de liturgie, II, 1B, 756, Fig. 1,491 [Benediction avec le medius]). 114 In the case of blood-letting, this finger position represents an interesting intermediate stage between the patient's extending his middle finger independently and the healer's aiding him by means of a gesture, as illustrated by a late medieval book illumination (Fischer, "Heilgebarden," op. cit., pp. 320, 341-42, with PI. 6, Fig. 8; and my "AderlaBl," op. cit., pp. 794-95). 115 A ligature is healed by having the bewitched extend his middle finger" (S. Seligmann, Der bose Blick [1910], I, 335). 116 Here, to be sure, widely differentiated conceptions could be drawn on. In the case of a Thuringian healing custom recorded by Wuttke (op. cit., p. 347, sec. 518), an epistaxis (nosebleed) is to be treated by holding aloft the arm on the bleeding side with the middle finger outstretched, while the other arm is held downward in the same manner. Here, the afflicted person surely desires first and foremost to direct the curative "stream of life" towards himself. But beyond this, through the divided extension of the arms-both up to the heights and down to the depths-the dual relationship of the middle finger to heaven and earth is invoked: The primal heavenly and terrestrial forces are opposed to one another in their activity, so that the cosmic motion which had led to the bleeding is contained by an internal tension. Regarded on a still deeper level, the human problem which had led to the bleeding is contained, is solved, as it were (see Fischer, "Heilgebarden," op. cit., pp. 324, 335). 117 That particular significance was attributed to the middle finger in obtaining the aid of superpersonal powers seems clear from its Franconian name: "Zapfhahn" (in Modern German, tube for draining off liquids), or "taphano" (Malbergische Glosse in Lex Salica 41; see Grim, op. cit., p. 440). Rochholz, op. cit., p. 104, has obviously not comprehended the deeper ritual significance, since in his perplexity he interprets this word as: "Zapfhahn, more or less, the 'snapping cock,' who snaps up everything." It remains for a more detailed study of this symbol to determine for the middle finger the nature of the complex polarity of association with cosmic powers, on the one hand, and individual preservation, on the other. See pp. 21 ff. above. The same is true for the association of this finger with Saturn, which calls to mind among other things the role of this god as lord of the Roman aerarium. 118 See p. 24 above. 119 In a special adaptation, moreover, a finger bridge could be combined natural- ly with the extension of a single finger. Thus, the combination of the little-finger bridge of the left hand with the extension of the right-hand little finger is men- tioned for one curative procedure in Marcellus De medicamentis XXVIII, sec. 74 ("Pollice sinistro et duobus minimis digitis ventrem confricans dices . .."). 120 For the gathering of medicaments with this finger, see nn. 84, 110 above. 34</page><page sequence="25">scribed by Burchard von Worms must uproot henbane with the little finger of the right hand.121 The same procedure is still more difficult to carry out with the relatively clumsy ring finger,122 which some people cannot even extend independently of the other fingers.123 Yet this finger was in fact preferred for minor surgical operations such as the removal of splinters.124 For particular eye medicaments, the use of the separately extended ring finger pre- vailed in classical antiquity.125 Here the custom of finger extension is incorporated in the instructions for the pulverization, or rather for the mixing, of certain medicaments. And yet in this field the preference for the middle finger, which continues into the pre- sent,126 cannot be explained in terms of purely rational considera- tions, since the thumb is, after all, stronger. Moreover, those finger extensions are significant for the dosage of ingredients in which the little finger protrudes freely. In the case of the apothecary's scale, this gesture possesses mystical significance preserved even up to recent times in the image of Christ the Apothecary.127 But even in present-day advertising, the little finger is extended in illustrations of the procedure for dosage with eye droppers.128 Also to be considered are the more or less complicated procedures of a chemical nature which medicaments underwent.129 Logically enough, this was an area in which the wealth of symbols belonging to the alchemistic theory of life could be developed especially easily.130 Extension of the index finger and the thumb as a sign 121 P. Herrmann, Altdeutsche Kultgebrduche (1928), p. 11; Delatte, op. cit., p. 144. 122 Germanic adaptations demonstrate very clearly the magical motivation (see O. Davidsson, "Islandische Zauberzeichen und Zauberbficher," Zeitschrift des Vereins fur Volkskunde, XIII [1903], 278). 123 The practice of gathering herbs with the ring finger is extended in certain sources to instructions for the use of ring finger and thumb (see below, p. 41 and nn. 217-18). However, for the curative act itself, the extension of the ring finger alone is generally preferred even in the medical use of herbs (n. 168 below). 124 H. Bachtold-Staubli, HWb. d. dt. Abergl., II, col. 1495. 125 According to Isidore of Seville (Etymologia XI, 1, 71), the ring finger is called medicinalis, "quod eo trita collyria a medicis colliguntur" (see Sittl, op. cit., p. 123, n. 6; Goratowski, op. cit., p. 29, n. 178). For the multiplicity of the sub- stances used see F. W. Bayer, "Augensalbe," RAC, I, 972 ff. 126 See p. 22 above. 127 K. Ganzinger, Apothekenaltertiimer aus Osterreich (1951), p. 14 (here Fig. 11). 128 A slip included by the Phanex Co., Ltd., in each container of Pandigal (a Beiersdorf product), depicts a hand in such a position dispensing the correct dosage of the drops. The effect is, to be sure, unconscious, but is thus all the stronger. 129 The lizard mentioned above (n. 41) had, among other things, to undergo incineration (cf. Marcellus XXXIII, sec. 6 with Plinius Nat. Hist. XXX, 143). 130 This subject has, to my knowledge, been treated up to now in monograph form only by R. von Sebottendorf, Die Praxis der alten tirkischen Freimaurerei (2d ed.; 1954), to be sure within the limits given in the title and to a great extent without consideration of material provided by the historical investigation of gestures. See also W. Schr6dter, Geheimkiinste der Rosenkreuzer (1954), pp. 102 ff. 35</page><page sequence="26">The Use of Gesture in Preparing Medicaments and in Healing of the male factor (Sol rubeus) in the opus found a kind of counter- part in the "horn gesture"131 denoting the female factor (Luna alba).132 That this is no mere reproduction of the vulgar "making horns" (to indicate cuckoldry) is obvious and also illuminates the whole context of this hand position. Connections of the alchemistic gesture to popular finger symbolism do become evident, since pre- cisely in the latter the gesture of the manus cornuta also appears under the name manus lunata.133 Generally speaking, we recognize in many customary healing gestures the symbolism of a truly al- chemistic mastery of process. Upon such a principle is based, for example, the extension of the arms in opposite directions (up- and downward)134 with the fist closed, but with the middle finger ex- tended.135 But, for the most part, alchemistic methods have been reserved for a very small group.136 Some forms found within the alchemistic tradition were doubt- less taken over from early Christian Gnosticism, and even from the official rites of the early church.137 It was, however, only the de- velopment of an older, not yet specifically hermetic, philosophy 131 The extension of index and little finger is generally referred to under this name (see L. Schmidt, "Die volkstiimlichen Grundlagen der Gebdrdensprache," Festschrift fiir A. Spamer [1953], p. 242). The lunar symbolism of this gesture is clearly documented (see n. 133 below) and corresponds to other traditional evidence as well (n. 108 above). 132 Fig. 12, reproduced in C. G. Jung, Psychologie und Alchemie (2d ed.; 1952), p. 647, Fig. 269, and originally taken from the "Mutus Liber, in quo tamen tota Philosophia hermetica, figuris hieroglyphicis depingitur" (Rupellae, 1677), 14. 133 G. Wilke, "Weitere Beitrage zur Frage der Mondmythenmotive in der vorgeschichtlichen Kunst," Mannus, XVII (1925), 51. 134 The combined gesture of raising the right arm and lowering the left one indicates in the symbolism of alchemy the basic law of all alchemistic processes, the "Solve et coagula" (see G. Schwartz-Bostunitsch, Die Freimaurerei [Ham- burg, n.d.], P1. 3 facing p. 24; F. Schwab, Geburt und Tod als Durchgangspforten des "inwendigen" Menschen [1939], p. 149, Fig. 1). 135 See in this connection n. 116 above. 136 It is doubtless for this reason that Jung (op. cit., p. 647) refers in the legend of his illustration merely to a "gesture denoting a secret." Yet in the strictest sense, only the laying of the index finger of the left hand over the lips of both partners could be cited, and not any gesture of the right hand. But here it is surely decisive for this gesture that the pair (as Jung continues to assert) is por- trayed "at the end of the opus"; they are persons who, having completed their work, await its results. They have silenced their own thinking and speaking in expectation. Their entire mental activity is directed only toward what they will obtain as the mature fruit of the opus operatum-through which, to be sure, they will also acquire the key to open the mystic gate beyond which heaven is perceived. 137 A gesture of the medicina coeli corresponds exactly to the form described by Cyrill of Jerusalem (Cathecheses Mystagogicae 5, 1; Patrologia Graeca 33, 1125): "Make of the left hand a kind of throne for the right." In this gesture, moreover the hands were laid crosswise, as is confirmed by John of Damascus, De fide Orthod. IV, 13; Patr. Gr. 94, 1149 (see Ohm, op. cit., p. 279). A gesture of the Lapis aureus (the "knight of the golden stone") corresponds to the ritual hand position with which the priest holds the host between the doubled index-finger bridge of his folded hands (see also M. Gatterer, "Die liturgische Zeichensprache bei der heiligen Messe," Zeitschrift fur Aszese und Mystik, III [1928], 344 ff.). 36</page><page sequence="27">when the individual fingers served to represent specific metals, since this was a development of the old associations of deities with planets.138 Thus gold was attributed to the ring finger (which even today is sometimes called the "gold finger") ;139 lead (by way of its association with Saturn), to the middle finger; copper (associated with Venus), to the thumb.140 On the other hand, the association of tria prima (sulfur, quicksilver, salt) with particular gestures was specifically alchemistic.141 (Here the concept "quicksilver" is ambiguous, since, on the one hand, it could designate one of the seven basic metals, and, on the other hand, one of the three primal substances: the media substantia.)l42 Especially obvious is the association of sulfur with the index finger,143 since the older Ger- man alchemy employed this symbol in a manner144 which formed -and forms even today-one of the practices of the Arabs and Turks.145 Yet not only finger positions but also postures of the whole body could serve to incorporate this symbolism, which illustrates the principle of analogy,146 for upward extension is as 138 See E. Bischoff, Der Sieg der Alchymie (1925), pp. 147-48 (with the older literature); W. Gundel, "Alchemie," RAC, I, 254. 139 For still older usages, see Grimm, op. cit., p. 444. 140 For the astromythical attributions of classical antiquity (which differed according to particular viewpoints), see Echtermeyer, op. cit., p. 7; Stemplinger, op. cit., p. 109. The work of a French late Romantic begins a renewal of this symbolism (A. Desbarolles, Les Mysteres de la main [19th ed.; Paris, n.d.], pp. 275 ff.). See also U. v. Mangoldt, Der Kosmos in der Hand (1950); K. Graf Diirckheim and U. v. Mangoldt, Der Mensch im Spiegel der Hand (1955). 141 The basic practice discussed in Sebottendorf, op. cit., p. 16 (see ibid., pp. 40 ff.) is obviously related to the teachings concerning the gnostic primal deity IAO, whose name, with its three vowels, corresponds to the tria prima. 142 C. G. Jung, Symbolik des Geistes (2d ed.; 1953), pp. 97-98. This refers to the anima media natura-i.e. to the extent to which sulfur as spirit forms the upper pole and salt, as matter (body), the lower pole, while quicksilver, as soul, represents the connecting link between the two. 143 Among other symbolic factors, the "lightning finger" (see n. 85 above) should here be influential, since the stench of sulfur is perceived after lightning flashes of certain kinds. 144 L. Thurneisser zum Thurn, Quinta Essentia (Leipzig, 1553), p. 70 (here Fig. 13), attributes to the personification of Spiritus sulphur the gesture of the extended index finger, and, more exactly, the characteristic vertical orientation toward the earth, since the spiritual influence of sulfur (analogous to the influence of lightning, n. 143) is expected from above (for which reason the person performing the rite holds the index finger upward). The great importance attached by Thur- neisser to this gesture is shown by way of contrast with its counterpart, the Corpus Sal (p. LXXXIII, Fig. 14), for the placing of the hands on the hips em- ployed here is a ritual gesture denoting "earthly life" as such (see H. Fischer, "Die kosmurgische Symbolik der Sonnenerdestellung," Symbolon. III [1962], 89 ff.). 145 Through the upward extension of the index finger, the spirit of the vowel "I" (English "e" as in "me"), as a force condensing the elements can be taken up (Sebottendorf, op. cit., p. 16); the achievement of success after repeated practice is attested by "a faint smell of sulfur" (ibid., p. 19). 146 Thus a hand gesture (crossing the fingers) corresponds to a posture of the whole body (crossing the legs); one example is a particular form of the gesture representing a plea for asylum (Schmidt, op. cit., pp. 244, 246). 37</page><page sequence="28">The Use of Gesture in Preparing Medicaments and in Healing important to the whole body as to the finger,147 at least in repre- senting sulfur caelestis.l48 To be sure, "terrestrial sulfur," that is, the material actually used in the retort process, was symbolized, at least in Arab alchemy, by a hunched-over position.149 This position was obviously meant to illustrate "being about to spring forth"; the start of a new chain reaction (since sulfur represents the "impulse power" of chemical processes).150 These selected examples have already brought us to the second major group of healing gestures, those which are intended to re- place medicaments. Even the late Artifices employed in their more or less material alchemy certain hand gestures (or "grasping positions" as they were usually called)151 which, perhaps from a very early date, were constantly being taken over by the mystics for their own spiritual alchemy,152 special emphasis being placed 147 In alchemic usage the vertical line represents "the philosopher's sulfur," while the horizontal line indicates "curdled or coagulated mercury as the passive, receptive substance in which the effective agent can manifest its entire power and be utilized for all purposes" (Die Sonne von Osten oder Philosophische Auslegung der Kette des Goldenen Vliesses [reprinted, 1866], p. 111). The cross formed from both the horizontal and the vertical lines indicates "that both entities are united in marriage, kill one another, and rise from the dead" (ibid., p. 115). 148 The Sheik Mehemet Rafi explained to a Bektaschi-dervish: "The spirit I stretches the body and forces it into an upright posture" (Sebottendorf, op. cit., p. 41). This "I spirit," however, achieves the absorption of celestial sulfur (see n. 145 above). In this connection, a posture has been traditional until recently which involves not only standing in a vertically stretched position but also lifting both arms straight upward with hands outstretched. The right hand is held in front of the left one (palms perpendicular to face) with the back of the right thumb touching the back of the left little finger. This corresponds to the position of the feet, since here the right foot must be set directly in front of the left one. This leg position, which can be identified even in prehistoric drawings (Gaerte, Altger- manisches Brauchtum auf nordischen Steinbildern [1935], I, 57, Fig. 6; see p. 62), is still found among the military postures of the nineteenth century as the "Schlulischritt" (closed step) (H. Rothstein, Anleitung zum Betriebe der gym- nastischen Freiitbungen bei den Truppen der Kdniglichen Preu/ischen Armee [2d ed.; 1857], p. 16 [cf. sec. 14 with Fig. 9b]). 149 A pseudonym for sulfur is al-gati 'ala rukbataihi, "cowering down and ready to jump forth" (A. Siggl, Decknamen in der arabischen alchemistischen Literatur [1951], p. 37). The author connects this identifying term with the difference between yellow and white sulfur (ibid., p. 54, n. 8); "white" is the color symbolizing the spirituality of heaven, while the color of terrestrial sulfur is yellow. 150 The form of this posture should not be confused with that of the "sitting position for salt," which corresponds to sitting on the heels (the seated kneeling position), with the sole variation of spreading the shanks so that the person taking the position can sit between his heels instead of on them (see Fischer, "Indo- germanischer Kriegeryoga," op. cit., n. 197; cf. Fig. 10). 151 G. v. Welling, Opus mago-kabbalisticum (3d ed., 1784), p. 525, writes, e.g., "If there be an art in the world demanding powers of deep recognition or requiring subtle concealed holds, then it is surely Ars Hermetica." A more detailed treat- ment is found in Schrbdter, op. cit., pp. 102 ff. See also the words quoted from Thurneissen in Sebottendorf, op. cit., pp. 37-38. "Holds" came to designate the sign-language of the hands in the conceptual world of the Free Masons. Cf. W. E. Peukert, Geheimkulte (1951), p. 600. 152 E.g., in chap. vi of the well-known Parabola (recently re-edited by H. Silberer in Probleme der Mystik und ihrer Symbolik [1914], we read concerning the 38</page><page sequence="29">on the fingers.153 For the alchemist's conceptual world, the sym- bolism of the human lap, that is, of the lower end of the trunk, also continues to be very important, since this part of the body was thought of in terms of a plant as the "root."154 This corresponded to a fundamental conception which was Indo-European,155 if not still more primitive,156 and which had long been paralleled in Occidental plant symbolism. Representations of the mandragora in late antiquity show the anthropomorphic root with wrists crossed in the middle of the lap,157 and, still later, South Slavic folk art employs this motif in portraying plant spirits.158 But the creature depicted in the latter representations has already reached the point of turning impatiently back and forth in the wish to escape from the situation which it had been destined to occupy, to leave the upright primal connection of the trunk-like axis between heaven and earth.159 In contrast to this image, the man- dragora symbolism, to which clerical writers also devote com- paratively wide attention, portrays a steadfast adherence to the straight, perpendicular attitude, especially as a means of resistance mystical conquest of the "lion": ". .. and recalled many a grip which I had learned by rather great diligence in this Athletica . ." (see also K. Weinfurter, Der brennende Busch [3d ed.; 1949], p. 256). Yoga-like exercises of the early Christians, too, seem to have been called "athletics." Cf. M. Martin, L'Athlete chretien (1944); J. M. Dechanet, Yogin du Christ (3d ed.; 1959). 153 At least Artefius, who wrote around 1130, should be mentioned here (n. 178 below). 154 Thus, according to the Codex Ashburn (fifteenth century), the root of the arbor philosophica becomes identical with Adam's lap (Jung, Psychologie und Alchemie, p. 352, Fig. 131). Adam appears as the rhizome of all human growth, as radix apostatica (H. Rahner, Griechische Mythen in christlicher Deutung [1957], p. 315). 155 Indian tradition has to this day maintained the designation miuldhara (M. Eliade, Yoga [1958], p. 241 [mula=root]). The center "is situated at the base of the spinal column, between the anal orifice and the genital organs (sacrococ- cygial plexus)." 156 Man's firm mooring to the "earth" is felt for definite reasons not to be centered in the feet, which are usually located on the ground, but rather in the lower part of the trunk. See E. Neumann, Die Gro,pe Mutter (1956), p. 102, on "this 'sedentary nature' attributed to the buttocks as to a 'counterpart' of the feet, which symbolize free movement upon the surface of the earth." 157 Fig. 15, reproduced according to the Herbarius of Ps. Apuleius, Corpus medicorum Latinorum IV (1927), p. 223, and appearing in Rahner, op. cit., P1. facing p. 228. 158 The Ljeljo (Lelum), the "spirit of the tree's soul," is referred to here (see J. Belovic, Die Sitten der Siidslaven [1900]). 159 Fig. 16 (reproduced from ibid., P1. facing p. 132) shows the raylike vertical behind the figure's back in special prominence, which is all the more striking because of the contorted position of the tree-creature attempting to escape from its simple connection to God and nature: The creature would like to "enjoy" life, to spread out the hands crossed over the root and reach the fullness around it. But its leaves are already beginning to fall, and the small animal in the foreground turns its back to him so as to flee from such rebellion. The whole is, of course, a reflection of the unconscious awareness of human vegetative traits at the threshold of our century. 39</page><page sequence="30">The Use of Gesture in Preparing Medicaments and in Healing to "the dogs devouring the soul,"160 which pull at the root. Here the root-man wishes, through concentration of his powers and through holding fast to the inner primal ground, to flourish, bring- ing forth leaves and bearing fruit. The hands do not yet dare to wrest anything from the cosmos161 but are crossed over the root to cover it while it absorbs (pure) chthonic powers. At the end of this symbolic development, however, is an image, also preserved pictorially, in which the human root, whose arms are now spread out, obtains its head from Christ, the head of all.162 Here the spreading out of the arms corresponds to a gesture frequently found in the practices of popular medicine.163 In its use is evident, among other things, a connection to the human concept of mea- surement.164 A man in the position of the cross is, on the other hand, also associated with that highest form of plant life, the tree. The vertical trunk of this ideal form combines heaven and earth, while horizontal growth is characteristic for the formation of the tree top. 165 III. GESTURE AS A MEANS OF HEALING That, in primitive as well as in high cultures, the gesture itself could be conceived of as a type of medicament becomes quite evident from the abundant written material. The crystallization 160 Rahner, op. cit., pp. 302 ff. The essentially negative image of the "cur" attempting to pull the creature away from its simple striving towards heaven becomes positive inasmuch as it represents an advance along the way "through darkness to light" with its tension of backward and forward impulses. All the mud-covered dregs are uprooted, brought to light, and elevated through sub- limation. In the pictorial language of alchemy, even the noble mature fruit of the philosophers' stone (Lapis philosophorum) is dug up by a dog (Lapis per caudam canis ex suis sedibus evelli debet; see Rahner, op. cit., p. 312, with the well-known tract: Der kleine Bauer). That the tail is used for the act of unearthing indicates the symbolic significance of roots for the body; the animal's tail is considered the root of its fertility, thus of the "animal drives" as such (see H. Wagenvoort, "Zur magischen Bedeutung des Schwanzes," in R. Muth, Serta Philol. Aenipontana [1961], pp. 273 ff.). 161 In this connection see pp. 46f. below. 162 See Rahner, op. cit., pp. 341 ff.; see Fig. 17, the "crowning" of a mandragora represented in a miniature from St. Florian, Cod. XI, 80 (1301). 163 Very commonly combined with the knees (H. Hepding, HWb. d.dt. Abergl., Vol. IV, col. 1,582; Fischer, "Offene Kreuzhaltung," pp. 34, 42). 164 For use in the "measuring" of body length and width of arm span, see J. Grimm, Deutsche Mythologie (4th ed.), II, 974-75, and III, 342; Wuttke, Volksaberglaube, pp. 339-40, sec. 506; Buschan, Medizinzauber, p. 736; Fischer, "Kreuzhaltung," op. cit., p. 14, n. 22. If the length of the body is found to be less than the breadth of the arm span, a fatal "loss of the mean" is referred to; the impulse-giving strength of the vertical axis is then thought to be declining. 165 Documentary evidence from the old and new worlds appears in Fischer, "Kreuzhaltung," op. cit., p. 13.

Thus the above-mentioned "measuring" of the patient is given more or less the following form: His arms and hands are first placed on his back, then extended horizontally, and finally laid upon his head.166 Certainly, associations with the gestures for herb-gathering, which are discussed above, were particularly signi- ficant for the fingerbridges, although they must not be regarded as a purely practical fingertip grasp or fine grasp.167 And it can be proven, even for the finger extensions, at least in individual instances, that the autonomous use of this gesture still goes hand in hand with the application of medicinal roots.168 Butt i is here that far simpler fundamental concepts claim our attention. The simplest point of departure is probably the healing, or at least soothing, practice of touching oneself with one finger: Ubi dolor, ibi digitus.169 From the highly differentiated system of attributing particular bodily organs170 to individual fingers, or even segments of fingers, can be recognized the importance, even in this simple therapeutic method, of touching with the finger in its various manifestations.171 This auturgic process is probably not much older than its cos- murgic counterpart:172 Here the elemental healing substances of the earthl73 are believed to be taken up or seized with the help 166 Wuttke, op. cit., p. 340. 167 See p. 24 above. 168 Josephus, Antiquitates Judaicae VIII, 2, 5, describes a magic healing process, in which is employed a Root of Salomon (mandragora), which Eleazar practised before the later emperor Vespasian: "Then he held his ring finger to the nose of one possessed by a demon, let him sniff at the root, and then drew out the evil spirit through the nasal passage" (Rahner, op. cit., p. 305). The miraculous Ring of Salomon originates with the Archangel Michael (ibid., p. 311, n. 2; Patr. Gr. 122, p. 1317 A). 169 S. Singer, Sprichworter des Mittelalters (1944), I, 57. See W. Grimm, op. cit., p. 443, where the famous quotation from Tristan, "der vinger bi den smerzen" ("the finger on the pain"), is connected specifically with the ring finger. 170 Thus, according to the teachings of Hippocrates, the liver is attributed to the index finger; the spleen, to the middle finger; the heart, to the ring finger (Engelhardt, op. cit., p. 114). Here too, as in the case of the elements (n. 195 below), a symbolic and a practical system are distinguished, except in the case of the index finger, which remains constant, while spleen, for instance, could be associated with the little finger as well as the middle finger. 171 Schrodter, op. cit., p. 104, n. 12; p. 105 ad, n. 14, introduces material from recent times, although without explaining the system of interconnections involved, which differs from that presented here. 172 The connection between the two processes depended, above all, upon the view of astromythical qualities as related to individual fingers (see n. 174 below), for only in its capacity as finger of Jupiter was the index finger associated with the liver (Engelhardt, op. cit., p. 114), which was itself regarded as the organ of Jupiter. (This organ thus bears the punishment of Jupiter, as in the myth of Prometheus). See H. v. Hentig, Die Strafe (1956), I, 339. 173 K.

See also H. Fehr, Die Dichtung im Recht (1936), p. 62: "Every finger is a particular symbol . . ." Even the "fig" gesture, according to an old explanation, denoted "nothing more than the power of the sun to generate all life and the thirst of the earth to receive it" (Groschuff, op. cit., p. 185). 174 For the astromythical attributions of antiquity, which to a great extent are maintained in the Middle Ages, see n. 140 above. But even where astromythical systems have not yet been worked out, every healing gesture as ritual act repre- sents in its original conception a transmutation of earthly power to the primal cosmic power. See M. Eliade, "Kosmogonische Mythen und magische Heilungen," Paideuma, VI (1956), 194 ff. 175 Cf. the biting off of the fingers or toes by the mother to avoid the infirmity of old age (R. Bilz, "Das aberglaubische Heil," Universitas, XVI [1961], 80). 176 Sucking the fingers is an intermediate stage in this process (O. Weinrich, Antike Heilungswunder [1909], p. 34 and n. 3). See in this connection R. D. Scott, The Thumb of Knowledge in Legends of Finn, Sigurd, and Taliesin (1930); Th. F. O'Rahilly, Early Irish History and Mythology (1946), p. 334. See also Kiener, op. cit., p. 45: "Apparently the bending and stretching of the hand musculature is experienced in the same way as are the motions of the oral musculature in suck- ing." For more detail concerning the corresponding quality of "taking in," see R. A. Spitz, "Die Urh6hle," Psyche, IX (1956). 177 For primitive peoples as well, finger differentiations can often be shown to originate in the belief in a supernatural heaven, although, to be sure, they corre- spond to belief in totemistic categories. Baiame, the supreme being of the Australian Wiradyuri-Kamilaroi, "had a totem for every part of his body, even one for each finger and each toe. And whenever he passed through new regions, he gave to every kinship of a clan one of these totems" (Schmidt, Ursprung der Gottesidee, III, 863). 178 Sebottendorf, op. cit., pp. 33-34 (together with Artefius, Clavis maioris sapientiae). In a miracle of the Virgin Mary, the Madonna commands: "Celestem suge digitum" (Weinreich, op. cit.). See also J. J. Bachofen, Versuch iber die Grdbersymbolik der Alten (3d ed.; 1954), pp. 212-13. 179 Fig. 12, cf. esp. n. 136. The man is here the impersonal acquirer, who still needs a like-minded person (soror mystica) to whom he can intrust his work and his intellectual treasures, and with whom he can work. Thus, the appropriative func- tion is dominant for the man. For the woman, the personal factor is crucial; whatever is given her, she absorbs completely into herself, into her very being. For the woman holds the back of her hand turned forward, which gives the gesture a protective component, while the back of the man's hand faces rearwards. The woman makes, as it were, a passage of herself, through which what has been acquired makes its way to corporeality, to lunarity (see n. 133 above), indeed, to birth; here, the little finger held upward symbolizes childhood (cf. nn. 107, 196). 42</page><page sequence="33">Despite all the culturally determined characteristic forms of this phenomenon, certain simple fundamentals are not to be over- looked. On closer analysis, certain connecting links between objectively differentiated manifestations appear to be altogether naturally ordained.180 If the index finger occurs repeatedly as a symbol of the spirit, of legitimacy and order,181 while the middle finger continually represents life, the eternal ebb and flow,182 then material found both in historical tradition and that of folklore is confirmed by the data of natural science. For instance, according to precise investigations, "measure counters" tend to favor the index finger, while those possessing "natural rhythm" prefer the middle finger.8l3 "Measure" refers to order, classification, exact- ness, and legitimacy; thus it is attributed according to each of these aspects to the index finger: as bringer of order,184 as one who admonishes, points the way, and sets aright. The middle finger as bearer of life is assigned a much more comprehensive task. It not only gives heed to the strict underlying beat, but also feels the pre- determined succession of individual measures as a picture of ordered flux, of rising and falling tides, of hesitation and accelera- tion which is wholly movement,185 that is, progress, development, and finally life. It could also be said that the measure-counter wants to reproduce the order of life, while the naturally rhythmic person wants to perceive the flux of life. Whoever wants to isolate the actual facts of development in an organic genesis will, it is true, begin with less differentiated gestures, for it is these which establish with greater clarity the cosmurgic associations referred to at the outset of this section. Primitive man, in spreading his fingers, was already seeking 180 Groschuff, op. cit., pp. 84 ff., emphasizes that "after the predetermination of their function by the soul and the mind, all the fingers alternate with one another for performing certain acts." 181 In the following observations, just as in those preceding, only data significant for the history of medicine will be introduced to any extent. To be sure, the docu- mentation of attributive symbolism from the realm of legal history might have still greater significance. See, e.g., K. v. Amira, "Die Handgebarden in der Bilder- handschrift des Sachsenspiegels," Abhandlungen der bayr. Akad. d. Wiss., XXIII (1905), 212 ff., 216 ff.; J. J.

Hirsch, Die Bewegungsformen der Hand in ihrem Verhdltnis zu Rhythmus und Takt (Bonn, n.d.); Kiener, op. cit., p. 182. 184 Important in this regard is, above all, its classical connection with Jupiter, since this god of the heavens appeared as a giver and guarantor of law and order. 185 According to the previously mentioned investigations by Hirsch, the fre- quency of movement is twice as great for rhythmic persons as for measure- counters. 43</page><page sequence="34">The Use of Gesture in Preparing Medicaments and in Healing curative powers from the sun;186 even today, this is identifiable as a spontaneous gesture of the hunger for light, as a struggling and striving for outer and inner "sunshine."'87 Yet the hand was held in a closed hollow, as in the process of dipping water188 when primitive man wanted to represent with a gesture medicinal "primal waters."189 Not only the upward scooping gesture but also the closing of the fingers lives on in the medieval gesture for aqua.190 In addition, however, there is a form to which only the closing of the fingers is essential,191 and it is this latter gesture which occurs again in the American Indian sign language for "drinking water."192 Here too, then, the elementary idea becomes clear. But even early cultures arrive at greatly differentiated ritual forms of the appropriation of primal elements. Most decisive, again, is the differentiation of the fingers. The thumb, for instance, governs ether; the middle finger, fire.193 Closer investigation re- veals two systems distinguished from one another by the invoca- 186 The prehistoric cave paintings from Litsleby reproduced in O. Almgren, Nordische Felszeichnungen als religiose Urkunden (1934), p. 90, Fig. 54, prove that the gesture had this meaning for primitive man, since it is toward the sun that the spread-out fingers are lifted (see also ibid., p. 98, n. 1). The Germanic tribes therefore did not derive this ritual form from the Byzantines, among whom its use is documented at a later date; see Ph. Wolff-Windegg, Die Gekronten (1958), p. 202. Spreading out the fingers and the rising of the sun (dawn) are related to one another by G. Wilke, Die Religion der Indogermanen in archdologischer Bedeutung (1925), pp. 142 ff. 187 See Fischer, "Heilgebarden," op. cit., p. 329. The previous study of gestures from the point of view of ethnology and folklore likewise connected the spreading of the fingers only with the two most frequently appearing groups of motifs: fertility magic and apotropaic rites; see for the present E. Gasparini, "Le symbole de la main aux doigts ecartes," Atti dell' VIII Congresso Internazionale di storia delle religioni (1956), pp. 384 ff. (Yet even here can be found traces of the associa- tion of the "sun tree" and the spread-out hand). Nevertheless, both of these motifs have been attributed equally often to the isolated extension of individual fingers (from little finger to thumb), or to the making of a fist. A real clarification of particular meanings of gestures must employ more precise formulations of the issues, which need not detract at all from a treatment of the fundamentals. That the sun's energy, to continue with the example already used, can be "put to work," on the one hand, for the strengthening of fertility and sexuality, and, on the other, for purposes of security and defense is already a secondary phenomenon. 188 On this general subject, see Sittl, Gebdrden, p. 110; Ohm, op. cit., pp. 261, 266 ff. 189 E.g., the Egyptian figure personifying the soul accepts with this hand gesture the primal water offered by Isis, as mentioned in J. Campbell, The Hero with a Thousand Faces (1953), Fig. 7, cf. Fig. 21. Moreover, a well-known Brahman rite employs the same gesture with similar meaning. 190 "Digitos iunctos elevare," Leibniz 384, no. 6. 191 Leibniz 400, no. 98: "Holstu alle 5 up nahe thosamen, dat is Water" (if you hold up all five close together, that is water); no. 99: "Holstu se dahl, dat bediidet Regen" (if you hold them downward, that is rain). 192 G.

Fire Earth Ring finger ... . Word Water Middle finger . Earth Fire Index finger .... Air Air Thumb ...... Water Ether The missing elements in each category can be found in the remaining parts of the hand: Palm .. . Might Might Center of palm . . Being Word Hand aura .. . Ether Being 196 Thus, an animal can be prevented from giving birth by means of the hooking of the little or middle fingers (HWb. d.dt. Abergl., II, col. 1,487). Spleen belongs to the little or middle finger (n. 170 above). Deep creases on the little or middle finger indicate sons (G. W. Gessmann, Katechismus der Handflichenkunde [1898], p. 44 with Fig. 19). The little finger as "children's finger" is a strong competitor for the role of son symbol (see n. 107 above). In this respect it is interesting that the rite of opening the mouth with the little finger (n. 23 above) is almost always per- formed by a person designated as "son" (Otto, op. cit., p. 20). 197 "Milke = Drawe thy left litle fynger in maner of mylkyng" (Kluge, op. cit., p. 132). This gesture of the little finger to indicate milking is found in the system used in Hirsau; the system used in Cluny indicates milk by putting the little finger into the mouth (Schmutz, op. cit., p. 354). This use of the little finger occurs also in the above-mentioned Legend of Abraham (n. 83 above), and in Baroque representations of the Madonna, it is the little finger which is extended by the Mater lactans (Fig. 18). A corresponding association with the middle finger is just as much at home in monastic systems of sign language; see Ind. Mon. X, p. 66: "Gyf pe meolce lyste, ponne strocca pfi pinne wynstran finger mid pinre swypra handa pam gelice swycle pu melce" (Kluge, op. cit., p. 123). 198 The fundamental conceptions underlying the parallelism in myth of con- stitution and function can only be indicated here. The milk of the middle finger is the vital fluid of life; that of the little finger is strength for the body. The vital fluid is that liquid which, together with the blood, maintains a necessary flow of organic matter-a liquid bearing in itself the element of motion, and thus main- taining motion as such, that is, life. Strength for the body is a resource for which motion, fluidity, and flowing are less important than the component parts, such as salt and nourishing substances, i.e., the combination of elements in this fluid of which the body is composed. A force piles stone on stone to build a tower; the fluid works through its flowing to keep life in motion. Only in the latter sense can milk become the "Pharmakon of immortality." See Reitzenstein, Archiv fir Religionswissenschaft, VII (1904), 403. 199 See for example Yuan Kuang, I Ging, ed. Ch. Canone (1951), p. 70. Inasmuch as a supply of air is indispensable for the burning of every fire, the index finger can be related to this basic element as well. For the monastic sign for ignis 45</page><page sequence="36">The Use of Gesture in Preparing Medicaments and in Healing as the all-penetrating element indispensable to every being even for short periods of time, appears as the best intermediary of that power of the universe which determines not only Wirken but also Werken.200 Moreover, from here we proceed directly to the theory of humors, since in the view of classical antiquity, the element air corresponded to the blood.201 This association, in turn, brings us back again to the above-mentioned relationship of the blood to the index finger.202 There is a similar correspondence with the indirect influence of the thumb as a symbol of water,203 which also becomes evident through its use in legal ritual in ordeal by water204 or in the cultic ritual of baptism by water;205 further, in the association with phlegm206 and its corresponding use in connection with formations of phlegm.207 Moreover, a symbolic chain extends from the finger of blood to wine, since these two substances are frequently conceived of as corresponding to one another,208 as, for instance, in the medieval locutio per signa, a gesture of the index finger serves to indicate wine.209 In other cases, the healing gesture has no connection at all with material substances. A transition group is represented by those forms which attempt to reach not the "lower" four elements but characterized by blowing on this finger, see Leibniz 387, no. 64. Conversely, the influence of fire on the air is identical with the basis for the origin of sulfur, accord- ing to the theory of alchemy, for which reason the association with the index finger (see nn. 144-45 above) should also be mentioned here (see Sebottendorf, op. cit., p. 42, with the quote from Seton, op. cit., p. 43). 200 One interesting individual trait of the index finger is its role as warrior finger and the resulting connection to the history of ritual (nn. 100-101 above). For the warriors in most ancient Indo-European times were accustomed to "give the chest air for battle" (through breathing exercises: see Fischer, "Kriegeryoga," nn. 33 ff. 201 A. Lumpe, "Elementum," RAC, Vol. IV (1959), col. 1,077. 202 See n. 99 above. 203 "The thumb has fallen into the water" is the opening of a children's verse rich in meaning (Rochholz, op. cit., p. 99). "Drinking" can also be expressed by means of thumb gestures (L. Flachskampf, "Spanische Gebardensprache," Romanische Forschungen, LII [1938], 227); the figurative meaning of "swallow- ing," too, is then symbolized by the thumb (G. v. Beseler, Subsiciva [1929], p. 19. Many classical authors associate tears with the thumb (Echtermeyer, op. cit., p. 7). Feeling behind the ear with the wet right thumb while washing protects against toothache (HWb. d.dt. Abergl., II, 175). The thumb is the magnet "providing the water for which you thirst" (Sebottendorf, op. cit., p. 41). 204 See the ritual of judgment by ordeal described in J. Grimm, Rechtsalterthiimer, II, 584-85. 205 This rite, involving both the forehead and the crown of the head, came to be employed in confirmation as well as in baptism. 206 Phlegm corresponds to water according to the explicit teaching of the Corpus Hippocraticum (Lumpe, op. cit., col. 1,077). 207 Gheranda Samhita I, 34: "Rub the hollow of the forehead with the right thumb. By means of this practice, phlegm is removed" (see B. Sacharow, Das Offnen des dritten Auges [1958], p. 93). 208 H. v. Hentig, Die Strafe (1954), I, 158, n. 7. 209 "Vinum= index curvatus positus super nasam" (Leibniz 392, no. 139). 46</page><page sequence="37">rather the "upper" four,210 such as "ether" or the yet more spiritual, but in general still materially regarded, "word." Here again, attributions to individual fingers can emerge, such as that of ether to the thumb211 or of the word to the ring finger.212 But there are also bodily postures in which the hand has only to estab- lish a connection of the entire body to the appropriate organ (for instance, the "word organ"). Both possibilities are to be charac- terized briefly by means of individual examples. For an example of the first possible case, the reader is referred to the finger of the word in medicinal symbolism, which alludes chiefly to a kind of "suspension of the word." For, while the ex- tended ring finger represented the influence of the word, the same finger, when bent inward completely (usually with all other fingers extended outward), reproduced the suspension of this influence. Suspension of sound (or more simply, the absence of sound) thus is symbolized at first by this finger gesture in its aspect as stillness in the external sense.213 Further, "stilling" in the figurative sense is then given the same form. As a treatment of "hiccups,"214 it continues to be associated with the word, for the effects of this disturbance are felt most strongly in the throat region, that is, in an organ typical of the "word" itself. The stanching of a flow of blood is still attempted by means of bending both ring fingers downwards.215 And one more step is possible if the goal is not only that a momentary loss of substance be stanched but also that the general disposition to such losses be counteracted. An Indian rite216 thus calls for the following treatment of loss of semen: The man is to take up the spilled fluid with the ring finger and touch 210 This archaic, even elementary division still occurs-even though within a classification deviating somewhat from the original one-in teachings of late antiquity; as the four elementa superiora, Ps. Apul. Ascl. names the following: anima, sensus, spiritus, ratio (Lumpe, op. cit., col. 1,083). The teaching comparing ether with the Anima Mundi serves to illustrate the interpretations which connect the various categories with one another. 211 "The thumb characterizes endless space, the void or ether" (Ohm, op. cit., p. 239, n. 3). The late conceptions of the thumb as bestowing invisibility represent the idea of transmutation of matter to ether; see Knortz, op. cit., p. 158; HWb. d.dt. Abergl., II, col. 174. 212 This association is reflected not only in the numerous rites concerned with the word in a narrower sense (see here "stilling through the word"), but also in the frequent attribution of the bridge of the ring finger to Christ as the "word" (Logos) (Sittl, op. cit., pp. 304-5). 213 Vincenzo Requeno, Scoperta della Chironomia ossia dell' arte di gestire con le mani (Parma, 1797), p. 103; A. de Jorio, La mimica degli antichi investigata del gestire napoletano (1832), p. 154. 214 "Both ring fingers are to be bent inwards to the palm without the remaining fingers" (J. F. Osiander, Volksarzneymittel [1826; 2d ed., 1957], p. 48, no. 46). 215 Ibid., p. 240, no. 30, even recommends an intensification of this position, namely: "tie down securely the gold fingers of both hands." 216 Gampert, op. cit., p. 150; Fischer, "Heilgebarden," op. cit., p. 346. 47</page><page sequence="38">The Use of Gesture in Preparing Medicaments and in Healing the middle of the breast or the eyebrows with it in a ceremonious manner.217 Beyond this restoration of vigor is the case in which this rite of treatment is not carried out with the bent ring finger, but with the ring-finger bridge, so that the thumb forms a base for the process.218 Furthermore, the particular aspect of "purity" ascribed to the ring finger becomes apparent in this instance.219 To illustrate the second possibility of an invocation of the "word" perceived as substance-assigning to the hand a con- nection to the organ which corresponds to the position of the entire body-let us consider a unique treatment for throat ailments with which I became familiar in Styria. The accompanying verbal formula suffices to prove it a true gesture of invocation: "Thy word nourishes me." First of all, the patient, standing upright, places the tips of both thumbs in the hollow of the neck between the collarbones. Then the hands are extended level with one another, palms inwards, to the back of the neck, so that the tips of the middle fingers touch at the nape of the neck,220 thus precisely at that spot which, in primitive belief, was the abode of the word transcendant, providing that impulse which is the source of the word to be made manifest.221 From this position, the hands are brought forward without moving the tips of the thumbs and folded as in prayer with the fingertips pointing upward.222 After this action has been performed quietly, the original position is resumed with equal deliberation, so that the rhythmical alternation of the two hand positions can take place several times in an attempt thus to surround the neck with the healing forces of the Logos. 217 Brhadaranyaka Upanisad VI, 4, 4 f.; Yajfiavalkyasmrti III, 278. 218 atapathabrahmana XIV, 9, 4, 5. 219 Even in the case of the left hand, which is otherwise prone to evil influences, this finger is not "affected" according to German popular belief (HWb. d.dt. Abergl., II, 1495). The bishop has a ring placed on this finger as signaculum integrae et plenae castitatis: Rituale monasterii Lyrensis (Martene II), 357. Even in cleaning the nose, it was customary once to emphasize the ring finger (K. v. Amira, Die Dresdener Bilderhandschrift des Sachsenspiegels [1902], Vol. I, P1. 165, no. 5; see in this connection as a counterpart in the realm of magic one of the rites of Eleazar, n. 168 above). The purity function of the ring finger has already been mentioned in connection with the herb gatherers and rhizotomes (see nn. 49 ff. above). Evidences of "purification" as applicable to the legal ritual procedure, which must remain to be discussed elsewhere, would also be relevant here (see Rochholz, op. cit., p. 105; Buck, op. cit., p. 25). 220 The hollow of the neck above the collarbones has also been associated with strength in the nape of the neck by oriental tradition (see W. Weck, Heilkunde und Volkstum auf Bali [1937], p. 65, n. 14: "Udana in the neck produces speaking, singing, and other tones; weakening of it results in illness above the collarbones.") 221 H. Fischer, "Das Wort im Nacken," Zeitschrift fur Ganzheitsforschung, V (1961), 125 ff. 222 "Folded" as in Upper, not Lower German usage in which an interlacing of the fingers is meant; rather, the laying of one hand to the other with the fingers flatly extended (see Ohm, op. cit., pp. 267 ff.). 48</page><page sequence="39">Alongside such special gestures for treating disturbances of particular organs, the vast majority of which cannot even be men- tioned here, elementary gestures of general healing power have existed since ancient times. Among the finger positions there is none so characteristic as that of laying the middle finger obliquely over the index finger.223 Gestures of this type appear even in medieval sign language to indicate the concept of medicine as such.224 The elementary meaning results naturally from the sym- bolism of the "finger of life,"225 which is here dominant, yet the broad underlying concept of healing as attaining wholeness of body (both health and safety) also explains the use of the same gesture in obtaining asylum.226 In the more specific symbolism of healing, the medicinal gesture just mentioned could be extended to the gesture signifying the "physician" by making the sign for "master,"227 which consisted in holding the nostrils together with the crossed fingers.228 It is both intriguing and instructive to compare this form of the gesture for "physician" with the one mentioned initially.229 There, the little finger as a symbol of "corporeality"230 and the finger signifying "love"231 have a joint effect.232 Here, however, the 223 A detailed monograph on this subject entitled Freiungsgebdrde und K6nigs- schutz will appear shortly.

Since procreation serves to continue the natural life of the species, the procreative member can also be symbolized by the middle finger (Buck, op. cit., p. 25; Quedenfeldt, op. cit., p. 331; Flachskampf, op. cit., p. 244-45. See also Bachofen, op. cit., p. 214). The "finger of life" is also related to its counterpart, death, just as the "finger of love" (the thumb) is related to hatred and hardness, and the index finger to meaninglessness, etc. Interestingly enough, the little finger competes with the middle finger here (see n. 196 above); this relationship has been discussed thoroughly in the study first mentioned. 226 See F. Sch6n, Zeitschrift des Vereins f?ir Volkskunde, XXI (1911), 298 ff.; Schmidt, op. cit., pp. 243-44; I. and P. Opie, The Lore and Language of School- children (1959), pp. 143, 230-31. 227 Leibniz 389, No. 79: "Medicus, idem cum signo Magistri." 228 "Magister =index &amp; medius includens nasum" (ibid., 389, No. 75). 229 I.e., the extension of both thumb and little finger (n. 22 above). 230 See n. 241 below. 231 This attribution is evidenced in that the thumb was sacred to the goddess of love in classical antiquity (Echtermeyer, op. cit., p. 7; Stemplinger, op. cit., p. 209). The role of the thumb in late antiquity in symbolizing Venus-like other charac- teristics from the ritual sphere of the dove goddess-is partially carried over into the medieval cult of the Virgin Mary, so that the enlarged thumb of the Madonna de perpetuo succursu is inclosed by the hands of the Christ-Child (F. Schwab, Von der Venus zur Madonna [1940], pl. 5). 232 Paul Verlaine still spoke of the thumb and little finger as magnetic poles (Schrbdter, op. cit., p. 106, n. 19). 49</page><page sequence="40">The Use of Gesture in Preparing Medicaments and in Healing finger of "life" and that of the "intellect" are brought into a re- lationship charged with intensity, in which the former must assert itself against the latter. Here the doctor as preserver of life takes the initiative,233 while in the other symbol he typifies the over- coming of illness through the establishment of a harmony, as he seeks the inner causes of disease.234 We confront here the contrast- ing roles of discoverer and healer, that is, of diagnostician and therapist; thus of the two basic types of physician, or more pre- cisely, the two aspects of the physician. The relevance of this inter- pretation derived from Occidental symbolism,235 for the corres- ponding Oriental practice is demonstrated by the Chinese tradition mentioned earlier236: To "take someone's pulse" is after all an elementary form of diagnosis. In closing, we must return from this comparison to the finger bridges. We have been able to demonstrate by means of striking examples that their use in various forms for gathering medicaments had inner connections and, at times, very precisely determinable ones to concrete therapeutic views. This resulted, however, in the emphasizing of very specialized individual traits which are neces- sarily less meaningful for elementary medicine than are the broader categories of attribution. One example of a late medieval symbolic gesture for illness shall be isolated by way of comparison. It is a finger bridge, to be sure, but one formed in a particular way: If the thumb chokes the little finger, the gesture means "sick."237 Here the little finger does not represent sexuality as in the bridges of the little finger discussed previously;238 here it is not invoked as a "nourishing" finger;239 nor yet is it the finger of the athlete found 233 See the symbolic portrayal of impulse by the index finger (nn. 81, 101 above). It is also highly characteristic that this gesture was at first reserved only for healing by the king, since, in myth, the king was regarded as the supreme bearer of impulses for his people. 234 Thus, e.g., in terms of one view, the thumb is associated with psychic dis- turbances (the ring finger, on the other hand, with heart ailments) (Schrodter, op. cit., p. 105). For the competition of thumb and ring finger in the attribution of the heart, see Fischer, "Heilgebarden," op. cit., p. 326. 235 The "magnetic" symbolism of thumb and little finger mentioned here by way of comparison has certain consequences relevant to these observations. Thus, a "drawing up" of the most hidden things seems significant for the tradition mentioned by Knortz, op. cit., p. 157. To be sure, other symbolic aspects are meaningful in this connection as well (n. 25 above). 236 Cf. Fig. 4 with n. 21. 237 Leibniz 402 (more correctly, 400), No. 109: "Klemmet de duhme den luttiken finger, dat is krank." 238 See at this point nn. 59, 63 above. 239 Here, present-day children's usage and the symbolism of antiquity corres- pond completely (cf. pp. 29 ff. with n. 83). The stomach is also associated with the "nourishing finger," as is maintained for therapeutic practice by Marcellus XXVIII, p. 74 (n. 119 above); chiromantic tradition corresponds to this in allowing the line of the stomach (linea stomachi) to run to the little finger (HWb. 50</page><page sequence="41">in the symbolism of classical antiquity.240 Instead, it represents here that comprehensive symbolic capacity ascribed to the little finger in the most elementary classification up to very recent times. The little finger is a basic symbol for the "body"241 or for man's physical nature.242 There is, however, no contradiction as yet to the particular symbolic meanings previously discussed;243 for bodily strength is nourished according to ancient physiological theory chiefly through sexual power, just as, on the other hand, an athlete cultivates physical strength or the man nourishing himself seeks to restore it.244 Thus, the simple underlying significance of a subtle symbolic language is demonstrated with complete clarity. The use of the little finger among monks to indicate illness provides evidence of this: If the physis is depressed, then the body is ill245 and the whole person appears to be sick. And that here the thumb is chosen to hold down the little finger again corresponds to the ecclesiastical view that all sickness is divinely inflicted. For, just as the thumb d.dt. Abergl., II, p. 50). In connection with the concept "milk finger," see n. 197 above. 240 Evidence is already given in Fischer, "Kriegeryoga," op. cit., n. 239. 241 That the little finger indicates the "body" is still demonstrated by stipula- tions made until very recently for oaths (see Kuinfberg, op. cit., p. 3 ("min Lib, der bediitt wird bin dem fiunften finger"; "my body, as signified by the fifth finger") (Baltl, op. cit., pp. 11-12). Historically determined individual repre- sentations of the association of little finger and body occur not only for physical characteristics such as those mentioned here; rather, the material aspect of the human being is also related to the material aspect of the human environment, as with property (n. 106 above). To what extent the realms can depend on one another, especially in primitive thought, is demonstrated by an African custom: "In Usanbara and Pare, everyone must touch with the little finger a dead man's clothing and the stomach contents of the dead sacrificial animal; thus the property of the dead man is cleansed from communicable diseases" (W. Schilde, Orakel und Gottesurteile in Afrika [1940], p. 9). In the background, of course, is the funda- mental association of the little finger with the earth (n. 195 above). 242 Spontaneity in the owner of a hand is, according to H. Wolff, Gib deine Hand (1949), p. 55, "made apparent by the position and movement of the little finger." 243 The association of the little finger with blood (n. 99 above) has a connection not only to a specific body, but also, by virtue of its elemental significance, to the material in the sense of property. For while the gypsy believes it necessary to touch an object unnoticed with the little finger of the right hand in order to pur- chase it cheaply (n. 106), the opposite case of selling as dearly as possible pre- supposes moistening the object "with the blood from the little finger of the left hand" (Knortz, op. cit., p. 159). 244 For a religious embodiment of the idea of restoration as late as the Bieder- meier Period, see the inscription of one little finger in the votive picture; Fig. 3 (see n. 14 above): "God preserves all." 245 Individual observation of the effects of various illnesses upon the little finger may have played a role in this process even for primitive man, but was certainly not the decisive factor in forming the concept "finger of the body." An objective example is given in L. S. Pernrose, "The Creases and the Minimal Digit in Mongolism," Lancet, CXXI 2 (1931), 585-86. 51</page><page sequence="42">The Use of Gesture in Preparing Medicaments and in Healing was the finger of omnipotence246 in heathen antiquity, so it be- came later the finger associated with God the Father.247 The de- velopment of the body is temporarily obstructed because a greater power deems it fitting to descend upon human existence. Here, in an apparently insignificant part of the body, we meet with that powerful experience which, even in modern times, has been able to move great men.248 That the sole quality ascribed to this omni- potence in elementary finger symbolism is that of "love"249 has also been significant for the fundamental meaning of therapeutic gestures.250 But even where healing practices-in view of this- distinguish sharply between the thumb and little finger, the latter is nevertheless honored in its capacity as a suffering creature.251 Count Karlfried Diirckheim has pointed out that the complete healing of man and the corresponding bodily condition of health "arises from the use of the right gesture."252 To be sure, he thought 246 "In the Lex Salica, it is called alathuma, finger of God" (Knortz, op. cit., p. 157). 247 This phenomenon too has been preserved into the nineteenth century by the symbolism of oath-taking mentioned in n. 52 above. 248 If formation only by physical forces were apparent in the hand, Newton would not have said: "Lacking other proofs, I would be convinced by the thumb of the existence of God" (H. Gross, Kriminalpsychologie [2d ed.; 1905], p. 120). 249 See n. 231 above. This association and the experiences which transmit it are unrelated to those "pleasurable sensations in the hand" which were over- emphasized by earlier psychology, especially in the case of finger gestures. See, e.g., on the crossing of the fingers (during worship!) J. Hermann, "Sich- Anklammern, Auf-Suche-Gehen," Internationale Zeitschrift fur Psychoanalyse, XXII (1936), 350. 250 Here, a reference is intended to the "bridge of the little finger" in its above- mentioned (n. 59) capacity as a remedy for sexual disturbances. The finger of sexuality, indeed, of all corporeality, must be so connected with the finger of love that the latter becomes its base (see also n. 90 above). If this powerful connection has been established, it then invokes the "lightning of purification" as does the little-finger bridge (the "seal attesting to the expulsion of demons") in an oriental rite (Yuan Kuang, I Ging, 71). This can be expressed otherwise as the liberation of the activity of the index finger (the lightning finger; see nn. 85, 101), just as for Yuan Kuang, an emphatic gesture of the index finger follows the seal of the little-finger bridge mentioned immediately above (ibid., p. 72, Nos. I and II). Related in meaning is the interchangeability of the bridges of the little finger and index finger, especially in the association with sexual restoration mentioned here (n. 59 above). A further connection becomes evident when we regard the tradi- tional use of the bridge of the index finger as a sign for pea (n. 61 above); for it is the pea which is attributed to Donar, the god of lightning (Wuttke, op. cit., p. 105, sec. 136). 251 Thus, in treating toothache, the index, middle, and ring fingers are laid gently on the cheek and the thumb held with its tip against the chin, while the little finger rises freely into space (HWb. d.dt. Abergl., Vol. IV, col. 1,483), a Prussian custom also found in Styria. The concentrated force of the terrestrial body in the finger is not to be added to the toothache, but rather, the opposite of this is to be attempted, so that the pain itself is drawn into the force or "diverted" by means of the little finger. (In Styria, the hand is to be laid in water previous to this ritual). 252 K. Graf Diirckheim, "Die heilende Kraft der reinen Gebarde," in W. Bitter, Meditation in Religion und Psychotherapie (1958), p. 161. 52</page><page sequence="43">in terms of pure gesture, thus eliminating not only those concerned with medicaments or some other material objects, but indeed, all others as well, excepting those "free from the ego, thus free from domination by those postures which have as their end man's self- preservation."253 Such a final goal is of course in no way attain- able immediately. Mankind must run its course through attempts to subdue nature, which indeed appears subject to human domi- nation. And in the course of such development, the healing gesture is employed as a means of dislodging matter which has useful con- sequences for man or, of making manifest the supernatural in the human body.254 This again is surely instructive for every discipline attempting to understand the phenomenon of man. 253 Ibid., pp. 169 ff. 254 For further development of these ideas see G. R. Heyer, "Vom Umgang mit sich selbst," Eranos-Jahrbuch, III (1935), 135 ff., esp. 168 ff.; and his Praktische Seelenheilkunde (3d ed.; 1950). 53</page></plain_text>
