Although not a great number by the stand- ards of earlier national or international exhibitions, and only an adjunct to the more spectacular scientific, technological and industrial exhibits, their presence meant that the exhibition rivalled or surpassed other Festival exhibitions in terms of the representation of contemporary British art.2 Yet the exhibition has tended to be overlooked by writers on the art of the Festival or misleadingly character- ised on the basis of a few untypically 'abstract' sculptures and murals (parallel- ing mis-characterisations of the exhibition's architectural aesthetic based on the untypically futuristic Skylon and Dome). There are several reasons for this ne- glect or misperception: firstly, since there was no definitive catalogue of the artworks, it has been difficult to establish exactly what was on display; secondly, since the 'abstract' works generated more press attention and were less adversely affected by post-Festival dispersal or destruction, they have become better known. In this essay I will attend only to the sculptures, though many of my ob- servations are applicable to the mural paintings. Having elsewhere detailed the surprising number and heterogeneity of sculptures in the exhibition,3 1 will con- centrate here on their relation to the architectural 'townscape' and to the repre- sentation of 'New Britain' as an exemplary social democracy. MODERN SCULPTURE The better known sculptures on the South Bank - Jacob Epstein's Youth Advances, Barbara Hepworth's Contrapuntal Forms and Henry Moore's Reclining Figure- were commissioned by the fledgling Arts Council. What is less well known is that all of the other sculptures were funded by the Labour government's temporary Fes- tival of Britain Office. While the Arts Council paid out nearly £5,000 to three of Britain's most distinguished, if most controversial, sculptors, the Festival Office distributed no more than twice that sum among more than twenty sculptors, fa- vouring 'young and comparatively untried talent'.4 The Festival Office's selection was made by the Festival Design Group (a team of architects, urban-planners, and designers), principally Hugh Casson and Misha Black, who had the greatest knowledge of contemporary art. They invited proposals from associations rep- resenting both traditionalist and progressive artists, and encouraged the South Bank's architects to commission works from their own budgets. But as Casson explained afterwards, with some apparent exasperation, 'nearly every architect would suggest, first, the name of Mr. Henry Moore, and then his ideas ran out ... nearly every sculptor employed ... had to be proposed by the Festival Office'.5 Given that many of the sculptors were little known, their fees were comparatively generous; however, perhaps because fees were inclusive of expenses, sculptures were frequently made from inexpensive and unresilient materials, such as terracotta, plaster and concrete, which proved vulnerable when the exhibition was dismantled. Casson later explained that the Design Group chose artists 'whose work was figure 1 R.

I will maintain two distinctions which were generally observed by those who selected, catalogued, reviewed and finally disposed of the South Bank's sculptures: the first is between the sculptures and the vast range of other three- dimensional display material in the exhibition (some of it made by professional sculptors) and the second is between the sculptures and the exhibition's design features, above all, the Skylon, which despite sharing formal affinities with certain modernist sculptures belongs in terms of its genesis and reception to the exhibition's architectural history. 2.

Since compiling the catalogue, I have identified the presence of other sculptures on the South Bank: Dora Gordine's Dyak (1925- 30), Maurice Lambert's Herring and Dogfish (c.1950-1) and an unidentified wood mobile by Edward Wright. 4. My estimate is extrapolated from the fees which are known, taking into account the size and materials of sculptures. Mitzi Cunliffe, for example, was paid 550 guineas for a large pair of concrete figures but fees could vary from as little as £30 for Lynn Chadwick's mobile to £2,500 for Siegfried Charoux's colossal relief sculpture. It represents less than 0.2% of the total expenditure on the exhibition which is recorded as £5,636,100 (Ministry of Public Building and Works, Festiual of Britain 1951, London: hmso, 1953, p.5). 5.

'6 However, this eclectic and populist aesthetic resulted in a selection which tended toward moderation and, at times, mediocrity. Senior academicians were excluded, despite the Royal Academy's desire for its members to be involved in post-war reconstruction.7 There was only one work in the social-realist tradition, Peter Peri's Sunbathers. And while there were a few neo-constructivistand neo-surrealist works by young and still little-known modernist sculptors such as Reg Butler, Lynn Chadwick and Eduardo Paolozzi, these had often been commissioned direcdy by architects rather than by the Design Group. As the illustrated London News observed, the sculptures 'for the most part are not of the most advanced modern school.'8 Rather, the majority belonged to two principal tendencies within the more mod- erate forms of figurative, modernist sculpture: on one hand, the classicising fol- lowers ofMaillol, such as Frank Dobson, two of his RCA students, Keith Godwin and John Matthews, and a number of émigré sculptors, including Dora Gordine, figure 2 J.

The only 'direct' carvers to be included were those who also modelled sculpture, like Heinz Henghes and Maurice Lambert, or who produced relatively genteel forms of primitivism, like Anna Mahler and David McFall. Similar caution was exer- cised in the selection of mural painters who, with few exceptions, practised forms ofNeo-Romanticism, Naturalism or popular illustration. Deviations from the juste milieu were met with extreme anxiety. When a newspaper alleged that Mitzi Cunliffe's surrealistic sculpture of embracing figures entwined in giant plant tendrils was obscene, a nervous Herbert Morrison ('Lord Festival') dis- patched the Festival's Director-General, Gerald Barry, in person to Manchester to inspect the offending work.9 But the greatest threat to aesthetic consensus came from the involvement of the Arts Council, whose officers saw their respon- sibilities primarily in terms of stimulating public interest in what they regarded as the best modern art, unlike the Festival authorities who were more sceptical of the suitability of modernism to 'the People's Show'. Indeed, Casson refused space in the exhibition for eight further Arts Council sculpture commissions predominately from younger 'ultra-modernists'.10 9. See M.

IOO TWENTIETH CENTURY ARCHITECTURE 5 SCULPTURE FOR TOWNSCAPE Rather than have a Palace of Art or Sculpture Court as had been customary at national and international exhibitions, Barry advocated 'the widest possible use of mural decoration and sculpture throughout the South Bank'.11 Casson de- scribed the Design Group's desire for the 'close harmony of sculpture and build- ing, of landscape and mural painting ... ', and Black recalled their wish to show that 'painters and sculptors could work with architects, landscape architects and exhibition designers to produce an aesthetic unity.'12 Barry later identified 'the marriage of architecture and sculpture' as one of the principal and most influ- ential features of the 'Festival style'.13 According to Black, an easy and enlight- ened relationship had ensued between artists and architects: The architects ... ensured that walls were available for murals and plinths/or sculpture. Practically euery concourse was designed to contain a major work; each building was a sanctuary Jor important works of art ... . Associating the artists with the architects presented no problems. Each accepted the authority, wisdom and skills of the other; the task of the co-ordinating architects was the simple one of bringing together those o/like mind and intention.14 The exhibition offered an opportunity to show that sculpture could be an inte- gral aspect of urban space without being assigned the decorative function typi- cal of architectural sculpture. Sculptures were positioned to achieve a great variety of effect, giving interest and identity to particular areas of the exhibition. Free-standing sculptures were placed on terraces and concourses, in or beside protective reflecting pools, near changes of ground level, and even under the ready-made loggia formed by the arches of Hungerford railway bridge. Relief sculpture was used as a foil to create ornamental contrast: curvaceous forms were set against architectural geometry, smooth plaster or concrete forms against tex- tured brick or concrete, and dark bronze or plaster forms against pale concrete. The emphasis on variety, contrast and surprise was well suited to the South Bank's 'picturesque' architectural layout. In contradistinction to Beaux- Arts classicism or high-modernist formalism, the exhibition had an intimate, asym- metrical layout which exploited contrasts in the pattern, texture, level and colour of 'floorscapes' and 'wallscapes'.15 The Architectural Review hailed the exhibition figure 6 • top left J.

(Crown copyright, nmr) MODERN SCULPTURE IN THE SOUTH BANK TOWNSCAPE as 'the first modern townscape',16 a term it reserved for describing the 'urban picturesque'. Despite a common perception among historians that the sculptures on the South Bank bore little or no relation to their place in the exhibition,17 the Festi- val Office sculptures were invariably positioned for thematic reasons. Thus, Godwin's Neptune was commissioned for the Sea and Ships Pavilion, Matthews's The Sisters (personifying domesticity with infant and bird) for Homes and Gar- dens, F.E. McWilliam's The Four Seasons for Country, and Vogel's The Industries: Heavy, Light and Electricity for the façade of Power and Production. Where exter- nal, free-standing sculptures were at some remove from their relevant pavilion, the relation was less apparent; nonetheless, McFall's Boy and Foal belonged to Country, Jonzen's 'Figure Symbolizing Youth, Open Air and Sport' to Sport, and CunlifFe's 'Group Symbolizing the Origins of the Land and People' joindy to both the Land of Britain and People of Britain pavilions. 18 While the Design Group ad- mitted a small number of 'decorative' sculptures, even these often carried subtle allusions to their siting: Mahler's Woman with Pitcher was inside a café and Hardy Henrion's Youth outside a bar. Other decorative sculptures transformed that quintessential feature of the eighteenth-century, picturesque garden, the water cascade, into a modern form suited to townscape: Richard Huws's 'Water Mobile Sculpture' flushed water regularly down a stack of pivoting aluminium recepta- cles, Paolozzi's 'Wall Fountain' emitted a stream of water from a scaffolding of steel pipes and concrete basins, and Victor Pasmore's shallow-relief mural, The Waterfall, on the side of the Regatta Restaurant represented eddying currents of water with black spiral motifs on unevenly-laid, white, ceramic tiles. The Design Group's self-conscious attempt to integrate sculpture into the formal organization and conceptual meaning of the exhibition followed an ap- proach already championed in the Architectural Review. A short article on 'Pro- gramme Sculpture' by Andrew Hammer, published on the eve of the Festival, had stressed its appropriateness to the Review's conception of townscape: In a jùlly realized townscape every street is its own sculpture^allery . Of course that doesn't mean rows of worthies in bronze, or even personages in iron. Hydrants, pillar-boxes, bollards, pumps, lamp-posts - these are some of the many things which may be sculpture in the street. But there is a place/or sculptor's [sic] sculpture too, particularly - and this is the point -if it is strictly ad hoc, purpose-made in relation to its surroundings.19 That members of the Design Group were in sympathy with Hammer's opinions is suggested not only by their preoccupation with 'street sculpture' - bollards, lamp-posts, sign-posts, litter-bins, kiosks, planters, and so on - but also by their 16.

(The Architectural Press) attitude that 'sculptors' sculpture' should remain subservient to architecture and, for the most part, avoid both the traditional and the ultra-modern. Appro- priately enough, the Review's idea of 'programme sculpture' revived a practice associated with eighteenth-century, picturesque gardens where complex allego- ries involving antique gods and goddesses, portrait busts, and so on, were set amid lakes, cascades, garden pavilions, temples and grottoes, alluding to the identity of a garden's owners or to particular themes like Love or Liberty.20 In such gardens, as at the South Bank, sculptures were sited for thematic reasons - for example, Flora among flowers, Acteon in woods, and Bacchus in vineyards. But just as Georgian sculpture programmes were frequently incomplete, the South Bank's programme was compromised by several sculptures which were purchased, hired or borrowed 'off-the-shelf and not, despite the official guide's assurances, 'specially commissioned'.21 However incomplete the programme, the commitment to art and architec- tural integration shared by the artists, architects and administrators was a symp- tom of their democratic aspiration. Barry argued that teamwork 'might bring the artist out from his seclusion, and give him a place in the social order.'22 Cunliffe longed for a return to the situation 'in medieval France or in Greece when artist and craftsman were one word',23 thereby 'bringing sculpture into everyone's im- mediate and accepted environment' and allowing it to 'speak to the commu- nity.'24 Even the supporters and practitioners of the more extreme forms of modernism championed the idea of integration. Herbert Read had recently drawn parallels between the condition of modern and Gothic art which had achieved 'unity and greatness' through its 'alliance with the practical activity of the architect. '25 Hnery Moore, in the year after the Festival, claimed that an 'inte- gral conception of the arts . . . has been characteristic of all the great epochs of art, ' though he argued that greater formal integration was ultimately impossible without the social integration borne of wider political change.26 Behind these aspirations was Ruskin's medievalising hope of cultural and social unity which by re-integrating artist and artisan undid the capitalist division of labour and restored to art its social and moral purpose. PROGRAMME SCULPTURE AND MODERNISM Notwithstanding Misha Black's rosy recollections of this collaboration between artists and architects, at the time he and other participants were less confident of their achievement. At a meeting of participating artists and architects held at the ICA in 1952 to discuss 'The Integration of Painting, Sculpture and Architec- ture at the South Bank Exhibition', the consensus of opinion was that it had 20.

When Morrison was invited to give his response to the South Bank, he admitted that there had been surprises, 'especially the sculpture'.33 The controversy must have been especially galling to the members of the Design Group who had conscientiously avoided the most abstract forms of modernism. Integrating modern art and architecture had always been problematic, given Modernist antipathy to architectural sculpture. Justas 'programme music' (writ- ten to accompany a preconceived narrative or literary idea) had met opposition in the twentieth century from modernist composers who favoured 'absolute' or 'abstract' music, programme sculpture inevitably conflicted with the aspirations of ultra-modernist sculptors who wished to assert the autonomy of their art. Notwithstanding Henry Moore's pronouncements on the desirability of integrat- ing the arts, he later more famously identified himself with architects who wished 'not to have sculpture on a building but outside it, in a spatial relation to it.' As he explained, 'the beauty of this idea ... is that the sculpture must have its own strong separate identity.'34 The strategy Moore advocated was neither new nor confined to him. A very similar formulation had been arrived at fifteen years earlier by the critic Stanley Casson in his analysis of the siting of two sculptures at New York's Rockefeller Center: Sculpture can be used to the highest advantage , not on buildings, but in association urith them. Thus a statue can stand in a garden or courtyard and bejfashioned by its maker to haue in itself certain proportions which exist in relation to the buil dings around it ... . So in more subtle ways statues and works of sculpture can be designed and placed in or near buildings so as to bear not only a relation in size and bulk to those buildings , but also a relation in space ... . Both stand in a spatial relationship to the building as a whole and illustrate the wide possibilities of the use of sculpture in modern architecture, [emphasis original]35 Given the growing acceptance of Modernist polemic for the autonomy of the arts, it was not surprising that some Modernist sympathizers gave ambivalent re- sponses to the application of a programmatic approach to 'public' or 'exhibition' sculpture at the South Bank, believing that such art was inevitably inferior or that, in Philip Hendy's words, 'an exhibition artist is a contradiction in terms'.36 Evidently sharing this attitude, the Arts Council had informed Epstein, Hepworth and Moore of the Festival Executive Committee's preferred themes but assured them that 'no restriction is placed on the subject of your group'.37 In- deed, in an instruction which was fundamentally at odds with the Festival au- thorities' desire to integrate the exhibition's art and architecture, the Arts Council's Director of Art, Philip James, told Hepworth, 'We want our sculptors ... to do what they are moved to do and not necessarily to accommodate their ideas to the temporary surroundings of the Festival.'38 The Arts Council's sculp- tors, however, seem to have been more sympathetic to the Design Group's aims, creating works which all bore some relation to their location in the exhibition, though this has been overlooked by almost all commentators.

Cadbury-Brown, to ensure the appropriate scale and siting of her anthropomorphic monoliths, re- specting the given theme in their uplifted, expectant gaze. Barry, for one, con- tinued to refer to the work as an 'abstract sculpture symbolizing the spirit of Jiflurei5 D. Hardy Henrion, Youth, 1950-1, Portland cement, h. 108 ins., '51 Bar.

The extent to which modernist sculptors of all persua- sions were prepared to engage with specified themes and sites at the South Bank has been obscured by alterations to the layout of the exhibition, by post-Festival 39.

SCULPTURE FOR DEMOCRACY Describing itself as 'one united act of national reassessment', the Festival pre- sented two particularly dominant ideas about Britain. Firstly, it portrayed a na- tion which had successfully reconciled the past and future in the present. The South Bank's official guidebook, for example, represented Britain as an ancient land, rich in varieties of landscape and farming, which is peopled by an ancient hard-working, heroic people who have a deep understanding of animals and plants but who, nevertheless, lead the world in scientific discovery, technologi- cal invention, and manufacturing capability.47 It juxtaposed images of rural land- scape, agricultural labour and the natural world with those of recent British achievements in industry, engineering, science and telecommunications, leisure and entertainment, and contemporary domestic design. At a less overt level, the Festival asserted Britain's position as an exemplary social democracy which had always avoided political extremism. In the midst of the Korean War, Barry pro- claimed that The Festival could help to ... assert the strength and value of the democratic way of life ata time when it was being subjected to sharp strains and challenges.'48 Underlying these perceptions of national identity were those ubiq- uitous stereotypes of Britishness/Englishness - moderation, tolerance and com- promise. A similar account of national identity is found in Sir Ernest Barker's contemporary anthology, The Character of England (planned with advice from Attlee), which represented the nation ás 'a blended country of compromise' where tradition and modernisation are productively balanced.49 At the heart, then, ofwhat Festival publications liked to call 'our way of life', was the claim that Britain governed itself democratically, reconciled tradition and modernity, and valued compromise, variety and - one other favourite Festival concept - 'unity in diversity'.50 Such values corresponded with the social-democratic ideals of Morrison's ascendant, strongly anti-communist wing of the Parliamentary La- bour Party which controlled the Festival's gestation during years of deteriorat- ing Cold War. The popular conception of the national genius for moderation, compromise and diversity was embodied in the style of the South Bank's art and architecture. Barry claimed that ' [t] he very architecture and exhibition design were themselves significant statements.'51 Hugh Casson's appointment as Director of Architec- ture and first chairman of the Design Group ensured that the Festival would be dominated by a humanistic, moderately-modernist aesthetic.52 The historical derivation of the principles of townscape and programme sculpture from the pic- turesque gardens of Whig landowners associated them with indigenous tradi- tions of Liberty and democracy (albeit anomalously with Englishness rather than Britishness), while Beaux-Arts classicism and ultra-modernist formalism were deprecated as 'un-English' and authoritarian. Moreover, the exhibition's mod- erate and eclectic aesthetic gained further democratic resonances through com- parison with the styles favoured by fascist and communist regimes. At the Paris World Fair of 1937, for example, the classicising architecture and sculpture of the German pavilion and the Socialist Realist architecture and sculpture of the So- viet pavilion had confronted one another across the main avenue, demonstrat- ing a shared taste for grandiosity and historicism. Although one member of the Festival Executive Committee had suggested that they 'might learn something from the recent techniques adopted in Eastern Europe',53 it was inconceivable that the architecture and sculpture of social-democratic Britain should resemble that of 'totalitarian' nations. Revealingly, the only sculpture at the South Bank which attracted adverse ideological criticism was Siegfried Charoux's colossal, overtly nationalistic, relief sculpture of sea-faring 'Islanders' which awoke figure 17 D.

An early, confidential Executive Committee report suggested that 'the Festival must give a picture not only of the essential unity of our democracy in action, but also of the diversity within that unity which is an essential ingredient of that democracy ' ('Festival of Britain: Purpose and Approach to Theme', August 1948, pp. 2-3, nal/aad [el 6/23]). 51.

(Central Office of Information) liberal sensitivities in at least one critic who found it 'a little too close for comfort to the totalitarian style of Exhibitionism.'54 The example suggests that the presence of a number of sculptors who were refugees from Nazism or Stalinism - including Charoux, Ehrlich, Henghes, Mahler, and Vogel - entailed some threat to the dominant conception of national identity: if artists' styles and/or politics were too extreme, they risked transgressing the mythical national tradition. That the architectural conception of the South Bank reinforced its meaning as an exemplary site of social-democratic citizenship is evident from ideas dis- cussed at the 19 5 1 Hoddesdon conference of the Congrès Internationaux d'Archi- tecture Moderne (attended by many of the South Bank architects). The exhibition's design corresponded with ciam's call for the reintroduction into the 'urban core' of non-commercialized, public spaces - modelled on the Ancient Greek agora - where citizens could meet and debate, supposedly ensuring the survival of democracy and preventing the rise of totalitarianism.55 The Festival Office's sculptures in these outdoor spaces were the ideal complement to ciam 's vision of the 'humanisation of urban life' since they not only conformed to ciam's perception of the need to integrate art and architecture but also to its espousal of a moderately-modernist, humanist aesthetic. Moreover, the correlation of a moderately-modernist, figurative styles of sculpture with the values of social democracy had near precedents in the wartime strategies of the War Artists' Advisory Committee and the Artists' International Association which had pre- sented similarly moderate styles of painting as the representative art of democ- racy. Misha Black, as the wartime chairman of the aia, had described art as the 'propaganda of the imagination'56 and his conception was readily transferable to the ideological purposes of the Festival.
