From its base, the tramway cage ascended four hundred feet to reach the monument. Borglum's fear of vandalism made him take great comfort in the monument's inaccessibility. The gargantuan heads of Mount Rushmore's four Great White Fathers- all intellect and logic, disembodied and soulless-stare down from the lands of their victims, the vanquished Native Americans. The faces are ostensibly benign, but the story behind their cre- ation reveals the darker side of this American monument and the sculptor who chiseled it into being. Indefinitely postponed by the sculptor's death and the outbreak of World War II in 1941, Mount Rushmore National Memorial's dedication has finally been set for 4 July 1991, the monument's fiftieth anniversary. The quintessential flag- waver, George Bush, is scheduled to attend the extravagant, star-studded ceremonies-on the order of the hoopla staged for the Statue of Liberty's centen- nial-to formally dedicate the sculpture and kick off a nationally televised tribute. Considered America's "shrine" of democracy and as popular a national icon as the Statue of Liberty, Gutzon Borglum's Mount Rushmore has served satirists and cartoonists as a source of inspiration since its inception. The me- morial's colossal faces carved in granite have come to symbolize, in the words of the sculptor's son, "an accomplishment born, planned, and created in the minds and by the hands of Americans for Americans.... There on the mountain the sculptor has spoken eloquently with his art, an eloquence that says simply, 'This is what it means to be an American!' "' Gutzon Borglum (1867-1941), the sculptor of Mount Rushmore, was a singularly energetic and versatile artist who had to overcome any number of human and material impediments to realize his ambitious scheme. Not the least of these were the problems of working at great heights while suspended in space. Equally challenging were the difficulties in developing a system of transferring the models' measurements to the mountain surface so that untrained miners and laborers working with jack- hammers and dynamite could perform the work of assistant sculptors. He himself had no reservations about his qualifica- tions for making "a nation's memorial" to Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln, and Teddy Roosevelt that would project "a serenity, a nobility, a power that reflects the gods who inspired them and suggests the gods they have become."2 Borglum always claimed that the idea of the mountain memorial, which he wanted to dedicate to democracy, was to represent American ideals. The strain of "democracy" that he and his peers advocated, however, contained an essen- tial ambivalence-an ambivalence that shaped Mount Rushmore's Rock of Ages less into a hymn to democracy than into another Art Deco expression of the 1930s in which authoritarian impulses and imperialist politics were masqueraded.3 The son of Danish immigrants who settled in the West, Borglum internalized the fierce chauvinism of his parents. His heritage made him a belated and anachro- nism heir of "magisterial aeshetics," my</page><page sequence="3">William Tylee Ranney, The Scouting Party, 1851. Oil on canvas, 22 x 16 in. Thyssen-Bornemisza Foundation, Lugano, Switzerland term for the imperial point of view that is often expressed in American landscape painting of the nineteenth century and that remains deeply embedded in the national consciousness. The elevated vantage point-and the sense of mastery and control that vantage point inspires- is the metaphorical embodiment of the aspirations of Manifest Destiny. Borglum the explorer-artist-spectator stood at an observation point that submitted the vast reaches of the wilderness to a gaze sym- bolizing the exercise of unlimited physical and intellectual power. This controlling line of sight, or "magisterial gaze," is a pervasive motif in American literature and landscape painting, in which the experi- ence of power and domination often takes place on a lofty vantage point, as in William Ranney's The Scouting Party. With its monstrous, omniscient heads looming over the western landscape, Mount Rushmore literally crystallizes this experience into rock hardness. Borglum's staring effigies are in fact surrogates for the sculptor-spectator himself, surveying the endless tracts of land and consuming them with his gaze, internalizing the government's actual expansionist ideol- ogy-allegorized by the cyclopean busts-and converting it into an aesthetic response to the landscape. In this sense, Mount Rushmore prefigures the Orwellian gaze with a quartet of Big Brothers. Borglum recorded his feelings when he stood for the first time on the crest of Mount Rushmore, towering 6,200 feet above sea level: "I was conscious we were in another world ... and there a new thought seized me-a thought that was to redirect me and dominate all my carv- ing-the scale of that mountain peak." He continued: We looked out over a horizon level and beaten like the rim of a great cartwheel 2,000 feet below. We had reached upward toward the heavenly bodies ... and it came over me in an almost terrifjing manner that I had never sensed what I was planning. Plans must change. The vastness here demanded it. In justification of his visionary monu- ment, he wrote, "Everything in modern civilization has so expanded that the very scale, the breadth of one's thought, is no longer limited by town, city, county or state, but daily reaches to the boundaries of the world." And he immediately drew the conclusion that it was wholly "natural and consistent with the great modern awakening that I should have turned to the huge cliffs of our land, the lofty granite ledges, and in them carve monu- ments and there leave records of the founding of our great nation and the development of our civilization."4 Borglum's visionary transformation of a mountain into gigantic father figures sharing an omniscient gaze may be traced in part, I believe, to the unusual circum- stances surrounding his birth and early childhood. He was the child of a plural Mormon marriage between his father Jens Borglum and the sisters Ida and Christina Mikkelsen. All three were Mormon converts who had left the hostile religious climate of Denmark for a better life in the United States. Jens and Ida were initially 144 Winter/Spring 1991</page><page sequence="4">P.

The following year Christina arrived from Denmark, and all three were subsequently united in marriage. They then traveled by wagon train to the Idaho Territory, where Christina gave birth to Gutzon on 25 March 1867. (The next year Christina bore another son, Solon, whose later success as a sculptor piqued Gutzon's competitive streak.) Restless and ambi- tious, the Borglums kept moving-from Idaho to Utah to Nebraska to Missouri to California. This movement from one frontier line to another recapitulated the striving of their pioneer predecessors. Quarrels between Ida and Christina and pressure on the plural marriage from the outside, however, led to the family breakup. In Omaha it was decided that Christina, Gutzon's mother, should withdraw from the marriage, after which Ida, Jens, and the three sons proceeded to St. Louis. Ida, now the nominal mother 145 American Art \a 9</page><page sequence="5">Borglum, suspended in a bosun's chair, supervises work on the Lincoln head.

Not a single worker was ever seriously injured during the entire project, although there were several close calls. of the three boys, and the elder Borglum swore the children to secrecy about their Mormon past. Recalling his mother's tearful departure, Borglum reflected: "I never forgot it, but I wondered why. I thought she was going to stay with us. She and father had always been with us. I could not understand." Borglum, then four or five years old, clearly felt deserted by his biological mother, but he was never allowed to mourn his loss and had to carry a "guilty secret" with him into adulthood. As he confessed: "By the time I was seven, I knew what it meant not to have a mother of my own. I thought I didn't want to stay around things that reminded me of her any more. So I ran away." Later autobiographical statements reveal Borglum's denial and even outright prevarication concerning the circum- stances of his birth and the identification of his mother-he veered from Ida to Christina and often cast blame on a cruel stepmother for a brooding, unstable childhood.5 The rage and paranoia that lay just beneath Borglum's expansive personal- ity-ready to flare up instantly with little provocation and inevitably creating conflict in his business and social relation- ships-most likely developed from this childhood trauma of abandonment, which probably was at the root of his chronic fighting with his father and his frequent attempts to run away during adolescence. His first attempt to stabilize his life took the form of an early marriage to his matronly and highly devoted art teacher, Elizabeth ("Lisa") Jaynes Putnam.

Lincoln figured prominently in Borglum's project. Borglum even named his son after the president who preserved the union. nearly the same age as his mother. Borglum kept news of their relationship secret from his father and other members of the family until after the marriage. Later, he abandoned this wife for another woman and then proceeded to efface Lisa from his history. A creator of monuments to public history, he was a destroyer of his own personal history. The circumstances surrounding his childhood may also help explain the contradiction inherent in Borglum's aggressive pursuit of the friendship of the rich and powerful, while simultaneously regarding himself as an outsider. I believe that it is not possible to isolate his sculp- tural aspirations from the impact of his early experience. The representation in perpetual, enduring granite of four powerful males whose steady counte- nances suggest the security of omniscient and omnipotent fathers may be traced to 147 American Art</page><page sequence="7">Tseng Kwong Chi, Mt.

Such protective males would never leave a child in the clutches of an uncaring or unsteady woman and would themselves remain a stable force to dissipate the child's inner rage. In building monuments to withstand time and nature (he had a horror of vandalism and delighted in the memorial's inaccessibility), Borglum was creating a heavy armor to guarantee the continuity and coherence he lacked in his childhood. The hardheartedness of his actual parents was transmuted into rock- hard metaphors of perpetual loving care. His anxiety about "fathering" can be seen in his own relationship to his son Lincoln, whom he kept close to his side at all times even into adulthood, much to his mother's distress. Lincoln in fact gave up the idea of his own career to devote his life to the Mount Rushmore project, which he helped realize after his father's death in 1941. All four figures represented on Mount Rushmore constitute a monument to Borglum's patriarchal preoccupations with the common man. Although he internalized the aristocratic view of the artist-genius who deserves unqualified support from society, he held populist convictions about the small farmer and urban laborer. Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln, and especially Theodore Roosevelt embodied for the sculptor the strong and wise ruler's compassion for the underdog. As an answer to his personal sense of parental loss, the psychological role of these colossal father figures in Borglum's life helps explain his own paternalistic attitude toward his employ- ees. He fulminated continuously against corruption in high places-one of his most audacious adventures being his investigation and condemnation of the aircraft industry during World War I- because it threatened his sense of the good father.6 But unlike the authentic muckraker and Populist, he almost always took his case directly to the presidents or institutional heads to warn them against corruption from below, invariably sparing them any blame, which he placed on bureaucratic middle managers. Borglum's maturation coincided with the consummation of the new industrial order in America at the end of the 148 Winter/Spring 1991</page><page sequence="8">Alfred Hitchcock's spy thriller North by Northwest (Metro- Goldwyn-Mayer, 1959) exploits the Shrine of Democracy as the symbolic backdrop for the undoing of foreign thugs and their local collaborators and the salvation of the enlightened American heroes. century, when the imaginative ideal of the pioneer who could chart new worlds in the wilderness was giving way to the postbellum myth of enterprising captains of industry who could restructure the world through their inventive genius and daring. Borglum's contribution to American culture may be seen as an expression of his need to fuse both ideals in his life and work. He lived out the western fantasy of rugged individualism and dominion over larger and larger units of land, but he accomplished his goals with modern technology and an army of subordinates. He carved a granitic mountain as a piece of sculpture with pneumatic jackhammers and plugs of dynamite. It is no coincidence that Mount Rushmore was conceived from the first as a tourist site not in its original state like Niagara Falls or Yellowstone National Park, but in an altered state wrought by human artifice. The initial idea for a monument carved into the Black Hills sprang in 1923 from Doane Robinson, state historian for South Dakota, who felt that natural scenery was not enough to lure tourists-that "something of special interest to make it impressive" was required.7 Robinson received fundamental help from South Dakota's senator Peter Norbeck, an influence peddler in Wash- ington involved in the development of the state's recreational and scenic areas. Mount Rushmore was to represent not only the wild grandeur of its local geogra- phy but also the triumph of modern civilization over that geography through its anthropomorphic representation. God- created man could now recreate nature in his own image, realizing through modern technology the old myth of the artist as usurper of the Creator's prerogative. Like Disneyland, Mount Rushmore trans- formed history into theater, something only a megalomaniacal actor with bound- less energy and confidence could have pulled off. This desire to transform the environment seemed part of Borglum's character: when he purchased several properties in North Stamford, Connecti- cut, in 1910, he promptly created a vast estate and named it "Borgland." Borglum was remarkable for his abundant creative and entrepreneurial capacities. His ambition embraced not only the symbolic shaping of material through an art of the imagination but the physical subjugation of the material world as well. He was able to map out his schemes, however, only through a vulgar kind of representation that resembled popular illustration. Because he confused bigness with greatness, he thought of himself as an artist producing monuments that rivaled the achievements of the ancients. But Mount Rushmore, like the Statue of Liberty, succeeds primarily through the impact of scale rather than through its aesthetic quality. Actually, because Borglum transferred the conven- tional formula of the bust to a wholly unprecedented context, Mount Rushmore can be regarded as a kind of inverse version of those plastic reductions of the Statue of Liberty and the Eiffel Tower 149 American Art</page><page sequence="9">that serve as decorative paperweights. While the paperweights miniaturize the original work and shift its context from the outdoors to the indoors, Mount Rushmore magnifies what is typically ornamental and shifts it from the indoors to the outdoors. This notion of the bust transplanted to a "natural," public setting becomes somewhat analogous to the idea behind topiary design. In this sense, Rushmore seems to be more kitsch than art. The Fathers of the Country, like ordinary fathers, required a place of residence. Borglum's theme for Mount Rushmore was "the founding, preserva- tion, growth, and development of the nation."8 The sculptor elaborated on his concept: The Memorial at Mount Rushmore is the first monument erected on the Western Hemisphere dedicated to a conception and the organization of this great Western Republic. It will include its struggles to maintain its unity as well as record its territorial completion and development.9 Seeking information on Thomas Jefferson from George Gordon Battle at the outset of his Mount Rushmore commission, Borglum stated: Jefferson s place in this memorial is more important even than Washington's. By that I do not mean to eclipse Washington one iota, butJefferson purchased the Louisiana Territory, in the center of which, on a spur of the Rocky Mountains, this memorial is located. I am literally converting a spur of the Rockies into a memorial and a monu- ment to the great Western Republic. Borglum understood Jefferson's acquisi- tion to be the key to the unfolding of the saga of Manifest Destiny: It was the acquisition of the Louisiana Territory that led to the colonization of Texas by Americans and that eventually to the Mexican trouble. It was the struggle over the precise relationship of Texas to the United States that led to the acquisition of California. It was the opening of the Northwest by Lewis and Clark, the direct agents of Jefferson, that developed the Oregon Trail and that, in turn, determined the boundary with Canada. In other words, it was Jeferson's political strategy in securing the Mississippi that incidentally gave us the Continent westward to the Pacific. ' Mount Rushmore allegorizes the idea of Manifest Destiny and inadvertently invokes all the tragedy this "doctrine" implied for native peoples. Borglum's professed intent demonstrates that his imagination had been nurtured in part by William Gilpin, the nineteenth-century lyricist of the Rockies and of Manifest Destiny: "I want, somewhere in America on or near the Rockies, the backbone of the Continent, so far removed from succeeding, selfish, coveting civilizations, a few feet of stone that bears witness, carries the likenesses, the dates, a word or two of the great things we accomplished as a Nation, placed so high it won't pay to pull down for lesser purposes." Although it did not illustrate an obvious narrative, Borglum's program for the memorial clearly suggested a summary of American conquest. His wife Mary, who served as his amanuensis, wrote that the memorial constituted her husband's "sincere patriotic effort to preserve and perpetuate the ideals of liberty and freedom on which our government was established and to record the territorial expansion of the Republic."1 Borglum's choice of four presidents for the Mount Rushmore memorial testifies to his position as a latecomer to the stage of magisterial aesthetics: each of the four had a role in founding and consummating the myth of America's Manifest Destiny. Their roles are clear: George Washington, who dominates the ensemble by project- 150 Winter/Spring 1991</page><page sequence="10">Roosevelt's head was dedicated in 1939.

Borglum's original plan was also 151 American Art</page><page sequence="11">designed to include a huge panel in the shape of the Louisiana Purchase. In- scribed in eight-foot-high, five-inch-deep gilded letters was to be his selection of the nine great events in American history. Significantly, seven of these-after the signing of the Declaration of Independence and the framing of the Constitution-had to do with the acquisition of territory: the Louisiana Purchase, the admission of Texas to the Union, and the acquisition of Florida, California, Oregon, Alaska, and the Panama Canal Zone. Borglum's nationalist project could not have been better timed. The post-World War I era was marked by a social narrow- ness and growing intolerance of foreign- ers, with white, Protestant Americans of older stock displaying overt hostility against Asians, African Americans, Catholics, and Jews. In 1924 Congress passed the National Origins Act, which limited immigration, especially from southern and eastern Europe, and in- cluded a provision that forbade the immigration of Asians. It was during this same period that the spectacular rise of the Ku Klux Klan reached its zenith. The prim Vermonter Calvin Coolidge, who presided over the dedication pageant at Mount Rushmore in 1927, was the president who signed the National Origins Act into law. Coolidge's trip to South Dakota in 1927 was also motivated by his desire to placate the impoverished farmers of the western and midwestern states. Farm politics particularly irritated Washington, D.C., during Coolidge's second term, when farmers stepped up their demands for a government marketing plan. Coolidge consistently vetoed agrarian legislation designed to alleviate the plight of American farmers. Perhaps Coolidge saw in the Rushmore project a cheap means of mollifying regional anxieties and rural resentment against his farm policy by tapping into the farmers' ethnic prejudices as well as their identification with the continent's first European settlers. In any case, Coolidge signed the bill that established the Mount Rushmore National Memorial Commission and allo- cated $250,000 toward its completion. The signing of the bill took place in February 1929, when only six days remained in Coolidge's presidency, leaving Herbert Hoover to do the practi- cal work of organizing the commission. Congressional support for the Rushmore bill manifested the heady optimism of the 1920s, when general prosperity seemed to bear out the national promise of unlim- ited expansion. Only in this climate could Borglum and his confederates persuade the government of his project's symbolic significance. With the stock market crash in 1929 and the Great Depression of the 1930s, however, what had been a luxury item for Coolidge and Hoover became a necessity for Franklin Roosevelt. Roosevelt actively supported Mount Rushmore, exploiting its popular appeal to promote his New Deal policies. Roosevelt's philosophy of spending the country out of the Depression played a role in Borglum's success: Mount Rushmore could be classified as a large-scale public project designed for hiring the unemployed, another instance in which federal money could be used to create jobs.12 Roosevelt traveled to South Dakota in 1936 to be present for the unveiling of Borglum's Thomas Jefferson. The president's trip coincided with an exten- sive tour of the West, ostensibly to evaluate the effects of the long drought but actually to campaign in traditional Republican strongholds during an election year. During Roosevelt's previous campaign, South Dakota had slipped into the Democratic camp for the first time in its history, and Roosevelt wanted to make sure it stayed there this time around. Significantly, the president's Mount Rushmore speech emphasized his attempt to preserve the democratic principles embodied in the monument's effigies.'3 152 Winter/Spring 1991</page><page sequence="12">Gutzon Borglum, Staging in California, 1889. Oil on canvas, 60 x 108 in. Joslyn Museum, Omaha, Nebraska, Gift of J. L. Brandeis and Sons He took advantage of the occasion to include Mount Rushmore as part of his national crusade to restore confidence in the government and regenerate the nation's morale; at the same time, he fended off conservative critics who accused him of behaving like a dictator with his sweeping New Deal measures. Borglum's penchant for "can-do" leaders and obsession with territorial aggrandizement predisposed him to feel most at home with robber barons like railroad tycoon Collis P. Huntington and newspaper czar William Randolph Hearst. Despite his respect for the two Roosevelts, Borglum considered a railroad magnate like Huntington to be greater than either. His belief in the need for a dominant authority to maintain social order is evident in his 1931 letter to his dear friend Lester B. Barlow, the eccentric founder of the Nonpartisan League of America, who considered Hoover a "robot." Borglum complained that America lacked someone with "guts" who could "take over the Presidency and put the company in order." He found his model in Europe: "There is only one man in all Europe with vision and courage and fortunately has the power to carry it out, that's Mussolini."14 Borglum clearly admired those with the power to move mountains, irrespective of their politics or ethics. He profoundly admired western explorers and entrepreneurs like Thomas Hart Benton (the granduncle of the painter) and Benton's son-in-law John Charles Fremont. Like them, he imagined himself a "lone crusader" in the quest to make an enduring monument for the American republic. It was Benton who, in an address proposing a transcontinental road in 1849, declared that it would be crowned with a colossal statue of Colum- bus, "hewn from a granite mass or a peak on the Rocky Mountains ... pointing with outstretched arm to the western horizon, and saying to the flying passen- gers-'There is the East; there is India.'" Borglum shared Benton's reverence for Columbus, who, in his mind, "did more for mankind than any other since Christ" and "who started into this great un- known, untraveled, and discovered this country."15 For Borglum, Columbus's genius represented the legacy of the Renaissance within America. Young Borglum's orientation was decisively affected by the achievements of Benton and Fremont. The reviews of his painting Staging in California brought 153 American Art</page><page sequence="13">For the unveiling of the Jefferson head on 30 August 1936, Borglum draped a huge flag over the boom of the pointing machine used to transfer measurements from model to mountain. At a prearranged signal, Lincoln Borglum detonated charges of dynamite to slowly shift the boom and pull the flag away from Jefferson's face. Further demonstrating his flair for dramatic dedications, Borglum proclaimed in a stentorian voice, "I want you, Mr. President, to dedicate this memorial as a shrine to democracy; to call upon the people of this earth for one hundred years to come, to read the thought and see what manner of men struggled here to establish self-determining government in the western world."17 Hat in hand, Borglum shares his vision for the developing memorial with President Roosevelt. . ~ ,~,~,..a. ?

His attendance was due in no small measure to Borglum, who had written to the Democratic party chairman to warn him of the Republican nominee's imminent victory unless the president appeared at the unveiling. him to the attention of Jessie Benton Fremont, Benton's daughter and Fremont's wife, who became Borglum's most enthusiastic champion. When she persuaded her husband to sit for Borglum, she brought together men who typified two generations of the American male, each desiring to transfix the world with his magisterial gaze. As Fremont, the intrepid mountain climber, wrote in his Memoirs: Shut in to narrow limits, the mind is driven in upon itself and loses its elasticity; but the breast expands when upon some hill-top, the eye ranges over a broad expanse of country, or in the face of the ocean. We do not value enough the effect ofspacefor the eye; it reacts upon the mind, which unconsciously expands to larger limits andfreer range of thoughts.'6 When he first dedicated Mount Rushmore in 1925 by climbing its vertical walls and planting a flag on its peak, Borglum was emulating Fremont's dramatic unfurling of the flag on the summit of the Rockies. Although Borglum's dedication occurred much later, it is certain that he and the Fremonts hit it off nicely. Jessie Benton Fremont recommended Borglum to members of her social and political circle in Los Angeles, leading to the admiration and purchase of his work. When Borglum and his wife headed for Europe by way of New York in 1890, they carried letters of introduction from Jessie Fremont to her friends across the United States, together with more than fifty paintings they hoped to sell along the way. Eventually Jessie Fremont introduced Borglum to Theodore Roosevelt, then New York's police commissioner, with whom Borglum became a close friend and political ally. Borglum's preoccupation with national conquest is reflected in the themes of his earliest works. He sculpted Death of the Chief (1891) while in Paris, and in 1893 he began, but never completed, a monu- mental canvas called Noche Triste (or The Conquest ofMexico) for the World's Columbian Exposition. The latter depicts Cortez's battle for survival against his formidable Aztec foes. Borglum's fascina- tion with the conquest theme was also apparent in his symbolic dedication ceremony for Mount Rushmore on 1 October 1925. On top of the mountain, huge flags representing the former European owners of the land that encom- passed Mount Rushmore were dramati- cally raised and lowered by assistants in French, Spanish, and English costumes. The Indians-always hired by Borglum to 155 American Art</page><page sequence="15">perform at dedication and unveiling ceremonies-were represented by one Sioux brave in full native regalia. Borglum's experience was grounded in the annexation of territories grabbed from Spain, Mexico, and native peoples in the nineteenth century. Consistent with the pattern of destruction characteristic of national exploration and empire building, the creation and the dedication of the Mount Rushmore monument was one more symbol of the white man's racist and intolerant Indian policy. While nascent environmentalists and other groups are recorded as having opposed the defacing of the mountain, there is scant reference to Sioux Indian protest or to the violation of their rights. Ironically, Mount Rushmore stands between what are now the boundaries of Harney National Forest and Custer State Park, named for two of the most hated names in the Sioux lexicon. Both Harney and Custer engaged in Sioux massacres that included the murder of women and children and led illegal expeditions into the Black Hills to provoke Native Americans to hostile confrontation. The Black Hills, of which Mount Rushmore is part, were then known as the sacred site of Paha Sapa, holy mountains where ceremonies were held for the spirits of dead warriors and where the young came alone to meditate and pray for guidance from the Great Spirit. No Sioux lived in the Black Hills, the revered center of Sioux spiritual life. But the harmonious relations between Native Americans and the land were disrupted by the Yankee expansionists. As more and more wagon trains and empire builders invaded Sioux hunting grounds, Indians retaliated by raiding the trains. Civil War generals still thirsting for blood, like Sherman and Sheridan, treated Indians as an enemy foreign nation. Sheridan-the subject of a flattering equestrian statue by Borglum in Sheridan Circle, Washington, D.C.- uttered the famous comment, "The only good Indians I ever saw were dead" (which became, in the popular version, "The only good Indian is a dead Indian"). Following the bloody Sioux war from 1865 to 1867, the United States negoti- ated the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1868, which established, for the exclusive use of the Dakota Indians, the forty-one- thousand-square-mile Great Sioux Reservation that encompassed the Black Hills. The treaty was ratified by the Senate on 16 February 1869 and signed by President Andrew Johnson a week later.18 Again, however, whites violated their contract when surveyors for the Northern Pacific Railroad extended their survey through the Sioux reservation and the government provided troops to protect them. In 1874 General Custer led an army of one thousand men into the Black Hills under the pretext of surveying for a possible fort site. Deliberately construct- ing a glowing official report on the fertility of the region and the possibilities for cattle grazing, Custer shrewdly tacked on near the end of his report the news of the discovery of a gold vein.'9 As might be expected, the news leaked, spurring tens of thousands of gold prospectors to swarm into the Black Hills. The government, making only half-hearted attempts to honor the treaty, thus relinquished its commitment to the Sioux during a period of economic depression and high agrarian unemployment. The government then offered to buy the land, but the outraged Sioux refused and reacted violently. Eventually President Grant resorted to all- out war, during which Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse annihilated Custer and his elite Seventh Cavalry at Little Big Horn. But the full weight of the U.S. Army began to take its toll. The Indians, suing for peace, were compelled to assemble in barren preserves in Indian territory, where they were ravaged by hunger and disease.

National Anthropo- logical Archives, National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution selected chiefs to enter into an agreement to turn over to the United States govern- ment the land-more than seven million acres-that comprised the Black Hills.20 The last incident of the Sioux wars was the sickening Wounded Knee massacre in 1890, in which U.S. troops slaughtered two hundred largely unarmed Lakota men, women, and children. Although the wars were over, the Sioux were now forced to undergo a different kind of attack on their society, customs, religion, and tribal unity, as the govern- ment tried to integrate them into white society as permanent second-class citizens. The Sioux fought back in the white man's court, trying to obtain satisfaction for the theft of their land and the violations of the treaties. With Sioux litigation still in progress at the time he planted the American flag on the summit of Mount Rushmore to dedicate the site for the memorial, Borglum would soon be swept up in the network of Native American claims. As if to stake out the territory, the sculptor then proceeded, like a typical colonial, to desacralize the holy place by defacing it permanently with the effigies of four Great White Fathers hewn directly into the granite. Thus, the harmony that the Native Americans had established with their environment was disrupted in a double sense by Borglum's monument- first, a religious and cultural site had been violated; second, an integral feature of the indigenous landscape had been perma- nently altered. Borglum's memorial, which constituted the crowning touch to western expansion, literally etched the magisterial gaze into the conquered landscape. It is no wonder that the Sioux came to despise the pale face's monumental impress on their sacred hills, a humiliating symbol of their oppression. As Lame Deer, a Sioux medicine man, interpreted it: What does this Mount Rushmore mean to us Indians? It means that these big white faces are telling us, "First wegaveyou Indians a treaty thatyou could keep these Black Hills forever, as long as the sun would shine, in exchangefor all the Dakotas, Wyoming and Montana. Then wefound the gold and took this last piece of land, because we were stronger, and there were more of us than there were ofyou, and because we had cannons and Gatlingguns, whileyou hadn't even progressedfar enough to make a steel knife. And when you didn't want to leave, we wipedyou out, and those ofyou who survived we put on reservations. And then we took the gold out, a billion bucks, and we aren 't through yet. And because we like the tourist dollars, too, we have madeyour sacred Black Hills into one vast Disneyland. And after we did all this we carved up this mountain, the dwellingplace ofyour spirits, andput ourfour gleaming whitefaces here. We are the conquerors." Lame Deer noted the psychological impact of the great white heads on the tourists who look up to them "and feel good, real good, because they make them feel big and powerful." They strut and think, "We are white, and we made this, and what we want we get, and nothing can stop us." Lame Deer concluded: "And this is what conquering means. They could just as well have carved this moun- tain into a huge cavalry boot standing on a dead Indian." As one type of symbolic protest against this desecration, Native American males would often form a death-defying human chain just to urinate down on the noses of the faces. Mounted police had to stand guard out of fear that Native American protestors would dump red paint on the faces. Led by leaders of the United Native Americans and the American Indian movement, Sioux women and men-some of whose ancestors had been killed at Wounded Knee-occupied the site behind Mount Rushmore in the summers of 1970, 1972, and 1973, occasionally demonstrating on top of the heads for the return of their 157 American Art</page><page sequence="17">The signing of the Fort Laramie Treaty in 1868 foreshadowed one of the grossest violations by the U.S. government of its contractual bonds with Native Americans and left a lasting feeling of bitterness among the Dakota Sioux.

In his address, however, the president stressed that the monument, in its location and design, was "distinctly American in conception, in its magnitude, in its meaning," ultimately representing "a picture of hope fulfilled. Its location will be significant," Coolidge unequivocally proclaimed, going on to describe the site "here in the heart of the continent, on the side of a mountain which probably no white man had ever beheld in the days of Washington, in territory acquired by the action of Jefferson." Coolidge made it known that the monument cemented forever the white man's grasp on the sacred land.23 Unlike Coolidge, however, Borglum often translated his paternalism into direct action on behalf of Native Americans. When he learned that the Oglala Sioux were starving in the drought and depres- sion of the 1930s at their Pine Ridge, South Dakota, reservation, Borglum- impatient with the responses to his many requests to politicians for help-rounded up cattle and clothing for the stricken tribe. An example of the official govern- ment attitude was the response to his call for help from Ray Lyman Wilbur, secretary of the Interior under Herbert Hoover. Wilbur argued that empty Indian dwellings do not necessarily imply hunger, since Indians indulge excessively in "feasts" one day and are destitute the next. "The real Indian," he asserted, continues to be essentially a primitive man and as such is quite naturally satisfied with 158 Winter/Spring 1991</page><page sequence="18">The last incident of the Sioux wars was the Wounded Knee Massacre of 1890, during which U.S. troops slaughtered about two hundred largely unarmed Lakota men, women, and children. National Anthropological Archives, National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution primitive conditions. Regardless of what we may do to hasten the progress of their evolution toward a higher civilization the fact remains that the majorpart ofsuch progress can only be worked out by the Indian himselfafter there has been aroused in him the will to better his mode of life.24 Borglum shared this attitude, although he evidently felt more keenly the historical injustice perpetrated against Native Americans. Although he was sympathetic to the plight of the indigenous peoples and to the abuses against them, Borglum nevertheless did not accept the Indian as a potentially full and equal partner in his vision of America. He used the Sioux in dedication ceremonies as colorful accesso- ries but still considered them wards to be taken under protective custody. Borglum's earliest childhood memory was of a "Sioux Indian's face pressed closely against the window of our main room." He was so frightened that he hid in the folds of the clothing of his grand- mother, who had been telling him Norse stories. Borglum suffered nightmares of Indian raids, with the fierce Vikings of Denmark and the Sioux Indians fused forever in his imagination. Indeed, Borglum's childhood dread of Native Americans on the frontier became public knowledge, subject even to satire by one West Coast cartoonist. In another anecdote, Borglum recalled that during an expedition to Oregon his father was selected to converse with a delegation of Indians encountered on the trail. One of them asked permission to examine Borglum's revolver and accidentally shot himself with it. The chief blamed Borglum for this mishap and demanded that he be turned over to the chief's people for punishment. This request was denied, and the Indians departed shouting threats.25 These childhood memories and imaginative reconstructions of frontier life-his earliest paintings, drawings, and 159 American Art</page><page sequence="19">Following his inaugural drilling at Mount Rushmore's dedication ceremony on 10 August 1927, Coolidge accepted the chief's bonnet from the Oglala Sioux as well as the honorary title "Wanbli Tokaha," Chief Leading Eagle. Coolidge's visit to South Dakota was a turning point in the monument's history. In addition to his direct support, the project benefitted from the publicity generated by the visit. sculpture represented western landscapes, horses, Indians, and cowboys-help explain his ambivalence toward Native Americans. Borglum's mixed feelings are reflected in a 1934 letter in which he claimed to have known American Indians since "babyhood." He acknowledged that Americans had stripped the Indian of everything "we wanted and punished him or imprisoned him if he complained." At the same time, he revealed his belief that Native Americans had had time to reflect on right and wrong and should now accept "as justified our [i.e., the descen- dants of the pioneers] 'right to be free and pursue happiness.' "26 Borglum's involvement with the Sioux during the early years of the monument's development may also be attributed to a shrewd political sense. Among Borglum's personal papers is a report on a 1931 class action suit on behalf of the Sioux against the United States.27 It should be noted that during 1930-31, the Sioux Nation's action against the United States, known as the Black Hills Claim, was reaching a final judgment. This suit demanded various benefits as well as reparations for past injustices. The pressures of this major suit and the hardships of the period may have prompted Borglum to intercede on behalf of the Indians. His letter of 2 October 1932 to the Interior Department's Joseph M. Dixon demonstrates that he was in direct communication with the Sioux delegates, even mediating their quarrels with the government. The month before, he had written to Secretary Wilbur from his home in Stamford, Connecticut, to say that he would "be very earnestly questioned" when he returned to the Dakotas and that he was "very anxious to 160 Winter/Spring 1991</page><page sequence="20">bring back to these people something besides regrets and delays." Borglum's paternalistic attitude is then spelled out: I had thought of asking the Department to give me some authority with the Sioux tribes in South Dakota so that I could, without interfering with their agents, develop a simple plan of lifefor them and restore a little of their confidence in the white man's administration. He concluded his letter with a blistering attack on the Indian Bureau, saying it "is so incompetent that only the dumb patience of the Indian himself has pro- tected this government from the severest censure."28 Borglum's protectiveness, however, was probably fostered less by his concern for the Indians' welfare than by his own anxiety about his tenuous connection with the sacred hills he was then subjecting to jackhammer and dynamite. Borglum was useful to enterprising Native Americans who played up to his desire for "local color" in connection with his ceremonies. Chief Henry Standing Bear asked Borglum to use his influence with the organizer of the upcoming Pageant of America, at which the chief hoped to "head and handle the Indians should they want to use them and to put on for them Indian act or play." Despite his obvious affection for the Sioux chief, Borglum's exaggerated and hyperbolic responses to Chief Standing Bear's periodic requests suggest his political manipulation of the Pine Ridge community: I wish you would write to me ratherfully about what is on your mind. I wantyou to know that I am the friend ofyour people and when I say that I mean that Iplace friendship andgood honest service to the Indian as one of thefirst obligations of the American people and the Government of the United States toward the original inhabit- ants and owners of this country-and that I will always do everything I can-perhaps more than I can aford-to do what is right andproperfor the American Indian.29 Borglum's aid to the Sioux during the Depression and his periodic gifts to them for performing at his dedication sideshows endeared him to a certain number of the chiefs, who made him an honorary member of the Sioux with the name "Inyan Wanblee"-Chief Stone Eagle. Yet in 1938, at the height of the Sioux protest against Washington, when Chief James Red Cloud requested that he grant Native Americans equal time on Mount Rushmore by carving the head of his father or one of the great Sioux chiefs, the man who could reshape mountains claimed to be "helpless."30 Seven years earlier the Oglala Sioux had first requested a monument to their people on the order of Mount Rushmore. Chief Standing Bear wrote Borglum in December 1931: When I visited the reservation last summer I heard thatyou were sculptoring theface of George Washington in the Black Hills which isfine. But would it not be most appropriate to have theface of the great Crazy Horse placed there too. I spoke of this to the people at Kyle last summer and they agreed with me. Crazy Horse was the guardian of the Black Hills-the great patriot-and is still so revered by all the Sioux today even those who catered to the white man. Crazy Horse stands out as not [sic] other Sioux in history and when he met death no one took his place. With him the nation fell and the Sioux went into bondage. He is deserving ofhonor. I do not, of course, know how you feel about the matter but it does appear as a mostfitting tribute to pay to a greatAmerican.31 Chief Henry Standing Bear's apparent acceptance of Borglum's defacement of the sacred place can be understood as a 161 American Art</page><page sequence="21">strategem to encourage the sculptor to embrace the interests of the dispossessed owners of the land. But Crazy Horse had no place in a memorial dedicated to the Great White Fathers; it was, in fact, his very absence that signified their triumph. Despite Borglum's aid to the Sioux and his awareness of the injustices meted out to them, he needed the Black Hills- sacred Indian land-for the embodiment of his vision of empire. The Native American claim to the land made it all the more appropriate for his shrine of democ- racy: the spread of the republic was, after all, the story of the conquering white men and their accomplishments, and the carving of Mount Rushmore attested to this spirit of conquest. Native Americans did not want Borglum's charity; rather, they wanted him to convey to the Great White Father in the White House their request to fulfill the treaty of 1868. Borglum, however, advised them against going to Washing- ton to demand restitution for their stolen land. He suggested that they instead barter their votes for political favors and even plea for charitable donations: There is only one way to get landforyour children andyour wivesfor the very hot months to give a little green and a little shade, that would be for afewfine men to contribute it to you and to give you a deed for it so that the Government or no one else could ever take itfrom you. In addressing the idea for an Indian counterpart to Mount Rushmore, how- ever, Borglum's disregard for the Native Americans he claimed to support is apparent: "I have never received a nickel for the work of the last year-for the carving of the head of Lincoln. How could I ever carve a head of your Father?"32 Borglum resisted blaming these problems on the Great White Father in the White House or his chiefs, but focused instead on "the little men" the same "little men who kill your buffalo and take them away-meat and hides. The Chiefs in Washington know nothing about these things, and you must be patient." He viewed himself as a "progres- sive," which to him meant possessing "an independence of thought and a desire on the part of the individual to place policy and action above party habits and conven- tion."33 Unfortunately, this often meant working out a plan of action to suit his own interests. Borglum's true position on the Native American question may have been best stated in his letter to P. E. Byrne, author of Soldiers of the Plains, who wrote to Borglum in 1927 to propose "a fitting memorial to THE INDIAN." Byrne's letter ended with something of an appeal for a "national monument worthy of the Indian warrior at his best, and of America's contribution to the story and the glory of the vanquished." Borglum replied that he was sympathetic to the project but was unclear as to what shape it should take and preferred that such a memorial be embedded into a more general monument of frontier life. As he explained, it was a matter offact [the Indian] has done nothing himself, and he became great only when he was fighting to resist civilization; that is he showedphenomenal mental ability, greatfighting qualities, but he has contributed nothing to literature; nothing to science. In his great human qualities he is certainly our equal So, when I seem to criticize him don't think it is because of any lack of lovefor him.34 Borglum's apologetic note at the end of the passage clearly resulted from his sense of having gone too far in disparaging Native Americans to an author bitterly critical of their treatment. Borglum's divided sentiments toward Native Americans came to the fore again 162 Winter/Spring 1991</page><page sequence="22">Unknown cartoonist, "At the Bottom of the Ladder," reproduced in the San Francisco Chronicle, 1 February 1924 Borglum's childhood fear of Native Americans on the western frontier became public knowledge through cartoons such as this. in 1932, when Chief James Red Cloud wrote to thank him for the gifts of blankets and clothing that he had re- quested from the Great White Father. Red Cloud had heard that Borglum was preparing for a journey to Washington, D.C., and he wanted him to marshal a delegation of Pine Ridge Sioux to the president to discuss the violations of the old treaties and the miserable conditions of Native Americans. He explained: We are a vanishing race and our bows and arrows are no longer useful. Our eyesight is dim, our muscles are stiffand we are like women. We are told that we mustfarm and work like ourpaleface brothers. We do not like to beforced to live like whitepeople. We are happier when we are in Council or dancing. We are not lazy like thepaleface says we are, but our civilization is different. The Black Hills still belong to us, and if the treaty of '68 is carried out, we will be happy and will not ask help from the Red Cross.5 Red Cloud concluded his appeal with a request to Borglum, should permission for the Pine Ridge group to meet with the 163 American Art</page><page sequence="23">Makpiya-luta, or Red Cloud.

National Anthropological Archives, National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution president be denied, to "plead with the Great White Father to fulfill the 'Treaty of'68.' " Since the chief's plea would have meant giving back Mount Rushmore, Borglum could only have received it with his customary ambivalence. The District Council of Pine Ridge, however, resolved that all plans for a Washington visit should be arranged by the members themselves. If Borglum were to act on their behalf, it should be only as a messenger of statements made and prepared by them. They rejected any advocacy role by whites. Borglum, in turn, rejected the Pine Ridge Council's resolution and seemed deeply offended by its implications. In a petulant tone, he declared to the council's president: This means that I must hold my tongue and do nothingfor you, that I must not go to the great whitefather with your story andyour needs. I shall respectyour wish. It is bad; some evil spirit has done this, driven from you a goodfriend. I shall not go to Pine Ridge, shall not go to the great whitefather, shall not go to the Indian Office and shall make no suggestion foryou have told them to give "no consideration to any request I make. " He concluded that he would never "come to you again."36 Yet Borglum himself seemed to understand the Indians' mistrust of whites. In January 1932, he wrote to James H. McGregor, superintendent of the Indian Bureau in Pine Ridge, and admitted his astonishment at the readi- ness of Native Americans to trust whites and his regard for their "sincerity and earnestness." As he rather cynically put it: This amazes me the more when I see so much myself to distrust, in those in charge. Their gratitude to me is pathetic, it does not please nor deceive me, it is pathetic, it shows me how eager they are to grab at a new straw, a new hope to lean upon and to this I now see clearly, from my records, they would have hadpractically nothing, had not someone "outside" insisted on meat rations, clothes, blankets, presented those needs to Washington andfollowed each item to its successful conclusion.7 Closely related to Borglum's paternalis- tic attitude was his idealization of the Native American as a "noble savage." This paternalism shows through in his letter of December 1931 to General Douglas MacArthur, then chief of staff of the United States Army: [The Indian of South Dakota is] a capable, high spirited, intelligent human being, left overfrom the Stone Age. Without our metal they would still be usingflintpointed arrows or volcanic glassfor their tools. They are the nation s wards. From our standpoint of civilization, under the restrictions we have prescribed by law and which are in force, they are helpless, practically homeless. They don't know how to live as we do and will notfor some hundreds ofyears even arrive at thepueblo stage.38 Borglum then recounted his achievements on behalf of Native Americans and stressed the incompetence of the Indian Bureau. It seems fair to conclude that if Borglum could not perform at the center of events as the "father who knows best," he wanted no part of collective action. Borglum's racist, paternalistic attitudes toward Native Americans were emblem- atic of his overall political and cultural sensibilities. For Borglum, in spite of his own Danish-Mormon heritage, Anglo- Saxon origins most truly marked the ideal individual. His racist beliefs characterized many of his dealings-he hired, for example, no African Americans or Asian Americans to work on Mount Rushmore. His fierce anti-Semitism, however, best illustrates the extent of his prejudices. On the eve of America's involvement in World War II, Borglum wrote, "We 164 Winter/Spring 1991</page><page sequence="24">The Stone Mountain sculpture was conceived in 1915 but ended in a fiasco in 1925 due to squabbles over financing and control of production. The profile head of Lee alone was completed but was later effaced by the sculptor who was subsequently hired to complete the job. But it was never carried out. will not get into the war [because we are] utterly sick of it and no combination of Jews, Communists, and John L.] Lewis et al, can force us into it."39 His attitudes here echoed those of Gerald L. K. Smith, Father Charles Coughlin, and other leading anti-Semites, who believed there was an international conspiracy of mostly Jewish bankers to subvert traditional Christian values. Although he spoke out against the Nazis, Borglum and others like him helped establish the "intellectual" foundations of fascism and institutional- ized racism. Borglum's involvement with the darker side of right-wing politics also included an ill-fated association with the Ku Klux Klan, which lent its support to a plan for Borglum to create a monument to the Confederacy at Stone Mountain, near Atlanta, Georgia. Although the plan was never carried out, Borglum found the KKK's views congenial. He not only added a Klan altar to his design for the memorial but also became a Klansman himself. He was attracted to the Klan's outsider, populist status and hoped to see it become a major political force that would put a member in the White House and influence national policy.40 Borglum identified with those in high public office and symbolically expressed power himself through his love of the colossal. His attraction to adventure and danger was part of his desire to emulate the western "macho" ethos, at odds with an effeminate character he perceived Jews to possess. He dissociated himself from the stereotype of the sensitive "artiste" and made much of his boxing and wrestling skills. He had a contradictory personality, perhaps also marked by an element of self-hate: while identifying, for example, with Populists and farmers (whom he wanted to see wrest power from the bankers and brokers), he pursued his fame within the wealthy strata he professed to despise. As an artist, Borglum was equally conservative, opposing the Works Projects Administration's support for artists during the Depression and rejecting the tenets of modernism. "Cubism," he once wrote, "is the extreme of our inability." His ambition was for popular success- not even his most monumental projects transcend the look of popular illustration. "Art is not self-sustaining," he wrote when he turned thirty, "until it becomes commercially valuable, and a man is not to be counted until he is in popular demand."41 His technique was to aggran- dize style with scale. Borglum's sculpture on Mount Rushmore was an artist's fantasy of immortality come true. His obsession with fame, the force behind his best known work, could not have found a more appropriate site: his Mount Rushmore is packaged in a form geared to popular consumption. Almost overnight, Borglum turned Mount Rushmore, originally the outcome of a geologic process spanning some sixteen million years, into a colossal piece of kitsch, which his Native American critics have compared to a gigantic paperweight, among other things.42 Borglum, by contrast, compared Mount Rushmore very favorably with the Egyptian and Greek monuments of antiquity, even declaring it "infinitely greater than anything those ancient civilizations had accomplished.43 In effect, he attempted to re-create nature in his own image. Mount Rushmore was to be a monument that would resist change and outlast corruption in society. In trying to tame a hostile environment as the pioneers had tamed the frontier, Borglum deeply carved into the Indians' holy mountain an eternally tangible yet spiritually shallow magisterial gaze. 165 American Art</page><page sequence="25">Notes I want to express my gratitude to Clare Spark for her insightful comments.
