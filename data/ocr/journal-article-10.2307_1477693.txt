<plain_text><page sequence="1">WORKING AND DANCING: A RESPONSE TO MONROE BEARDSLEY'S "WHAT IS GOING ON IN A DANCE?" Noel Carroll and Sally Banes Professor Beardsley's paper is distinguished by his customary clarity. Many of the distinctions he draws will undoubtedly be useful not only for dance theoreticians, but for dance critics as well. Nevertheless, the way that these distinctions are placed in the service of a putative characterization of what constitutes a dance "moving" seems to us problematic. This brief note will be devoted to exploring the adequacy of Professor Beardsley's proposal. Beardsley appears to conclude his paper by stating a condi- tion requisite for a motion to be counted as a dance "moving." He writes, If, in other words, there is more zest, vigor, fluency, expansiveness, or stateliness than appears necessary for its practical purposes, there is an overflow or superfluity of expressiveness to mark it as belonging to its own domain of dance.' We interpret Beardsley's basic point here as the claim that a superfluity of expressiveness (above the requirements of prac- tical exigencies) is a defining feature of a dance "moving." However, in our opinion, this attribute represents neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition of dance. First of all, "superfluity of expressiveness" is not exclusive enough to define a dance moving. We often hear of the fervor of socialist volunteers, urbanites, who travel to rural areas to help with a harvest and boost productivity. Imagine a truck- load of such patriotic workers arriving at a cane field some- where in Cuba. Some of them may even be professional dancers. They raise their machetes much higher than neces- sary, use more force than is required by their task, and per- haps their swinging becomes rhythmic. Their activity is expressive of patriotic zest and revolutionary zeal, but it is not dance. Here we have an overflow of expressiveness, and it is not related to the practical purpose of the event, which is aimed at increasing productivity, not at displaying class soli- darity. Of course, a journalist might describe the harvest as a dance, but we would have to understand this as poetic short- hand, meaning "dance-like." To take the term "dance" liter- ally in referring to such an event would commit us to such unlikely ballets as some sweeping infantry maneuvers and the dramatic tantrums of an adolescent. If a dance critic were to review these events, we would be very surprised. Undoubtedly, a choreographer could take our truckload of harvesters, place them on a proscenium stage, and transform their enthusiasm into a dance. But in such a case, it seems to us that it is the choreographer's act of framing, or recontex- tualizing, rather than an intrinsic quality of the movement, that is decisive. In general, whether one is speaking about art dance or social dance, the context of the event in which the movement is situated is more salient than the nature of the movement itself in determining whether the action is dance. Professor Beardsley's definition not only fails to be exclusive enough, but also falters in inclusiveness. There are, we believe, incontestable examples of dance in which there is no super- fluity of expressiveness in the movement. One example is Room Service by Yvonne Rainer, which was first performed at the Judson Church in 1963 and again the next year at the Institute of Contemporary Art in Philadelphia. Rainer de- scribes it as "a big sprawling piece with three teams of people playing follow-the-leader thru an assortment of paraphernalia which is arranged and rearranged by a guy and his two assis- tants."2 Part of the dance includes climbing up a ladder to a platform and jumping off. A central segment of the Philadel- phia performance (and of particular interest for this paper) was the activity of two dancers carrying a mattress up an aisle in the theater, out one exit, and back in through another. Although Room Service may appear similar to a dance Beardsley discusses-Anna Sokolow's Rooms-it differs from it in important ways. The ordinary movement in Room Ser- vice is not marked by "the intensified way"3 in which it is carried out. The point of the dance is to make ordinary move- ment qua ordinary movement perceptible. The audience observes the performers navigating a cumbersome object, noting how the working bodies adjust their muscles, weights, and angles. If the dance is performed correctly, there can be no question of superfluity of expression over the requirements of practical purposes, because the raison d'etre of the piece is to display the practical intelligence of the body in pursuit of a mundane, goal-oriented type of action-moving a mattress. That is, the subject of the dance is the functional economy of Dance Research Journal 15/1 (Fall 1982) 37 I I _</page><page sequence="2">Room Service by Yvonne Rainer and Charles Ross, in its first performance at Concert of Dance #13, Judson Memorial Church, November 20, 1963. ? 1963 by Peter Moore. a movement in the performance of bodies involved in what Beardsley calls a working. Room Service is not a representa- tion of a working; it is a working. But it is also a dance- partially because through its aesthetic context it transforms an ordinary working (the sort of thing whose kinetic intricacies usually go unnoticed or ignored) into an object for close scrutiny. Rainer immediately went on to make another dance, Parts of Some Sextets, comprising a variety of activities in- volving ten dancers, twelve mattresses, and gears, string, rope, and buffers. Again, the emphasis in the dance is on the working human body. Room Service is not an atypical dance. It is an example of a genre of avant-garde performance that might loosely be referred to as task dances, which have been made continuous- ly since the Sixties. The roster of task dances includes other works by Rainer, Trisha Brown's Equipment Pieces and her Rulegame 5 (1964), and Simone Forti's "dance construction" Slant Board (1961), in which three or four people move con- stantly across a wooden ramp slanted against a wall at a 45? angle to the floor, by means of knotted ropes.4 The existence of this genre is an important motive in writing this reply to Professor Beardsley, because we fear that his definition is unwittingly conservative, operating to exclude prescriptively some of the most exciting work of contemporary choreog- raphers. Of course, Beardsley may wish to defend his definition by arguing that Room Service, and works like it, are not dances. This seems ill-advised for several reasons. First, the dance shares a set of recognized aesthetic preoccupations with con- temporary fine art. For example, it is what has been called "anti-illusionist." That is, it attempts to close the conceptual gap between artworks and real things-a major theme of modernist sculpture and painting. In this vein, Jasper Johns reportedly has said that "people should be able to look at a painting 'the same way you look at a radiator.'"5 Johns's flag paintings, especially Flag (1955, Museum of Modern Art), ingeniously implement this "demystifying" attitude toward artworks, since in certain pertinent respects the painting is a flag (or one side of one), rather than a representation (or "illusion") of one; schoolchildren could pledge to it with no loss of allegiance. Johns's bronzed beer cans or his Savarin can with paint brushes are sculptures that likewise attempt to narrow the categorical distinction between mundane objects and works of art. The choice of ordinary working movement as the subject of Room Service is on a par with the "demythologizing" tendency toward fine art that one finds in many of Jasper Johns's pieces. Stated formulaically, we might say that "ordinary object" in art is equivalent to "ordinary movement" in dance. Now, Johns's work is (rightfully, we believe) considered among the major accomplishments of the art of the Fifties, Sixties, and early Seventies. There can be little doubt that it is art or that his patterned canvases are paintings. Why? One answer is that his works are the intelligible products of a century of animated interplay between art making and art theorizing. Since the rise of photography, anti-illusionist arguments for the role and destiny of painting abound. Part of the rhetoric of this theorizing is that a painting is essentially an object (a "real" object), like any other (e.g., a radiator or beer can), rather than a cypher (a virtual object) standing for real ob- jects. The Johns examples, as well as Warhol's Brillo boxes, attempt to literalize this type of theory by proposing master- pieces that in terms of certain relevant features are indis- tinguishable from everyday objects. Room Service bears a strict genetic resemblance to the above cases of modernist painting and sculpture. If they are full-blooded examples of 38 Dance Research Journal 15/1 (Fall 1982)</page><page sequence="3">Jasper Johns, Flag (1955) painting and sculpture, as we believe their position in the history of twentieth-century art establishes, then Room Ser- vice is a dance. Specifically, it is an art dance, since the tradition it directly emerges from is that of the artworld rather than custom, ritual, or popular culture. Indeed, it is an art dance in a triple sense. First, it is presented to the spectator as an object of aesthetic contemplation and not as a social or ritual activity. Second, and more importantly, it mimes (or, less metaphor- ically, transposes) the theoretical donnees of fine art in the medium of dance. And third, in doing this it is also in the domain of art dancing proper, since both the balletic and modern traditions of dance have always made a practice of exploring other arts for inspiration and invention. In making this argument, we hasten to add that we do not believe that it is necessary for the anti-illusionist theories that form the conceptual background of Johns, of Warhol, or of Rainer to be true or even compelling philosophically in order that the putative paintings, sculptures, and dances be classi- fied as paintings, sculptures, and dances. It is enough that the theories have currency in their appropriate communities of discourse and that the works in question can be seen as their consequences. We are assuming this on the grounds that a genetic link between an evolving artistic tradition (including theory, practice, and the cross-fertilization between the two) and a candidate for inclusion in that tradition is a prima facie reason for classifying the candidate as part of the tradition. Room Service is both art and art dance because of such genetic links. Indeed, insofar as it is even less ambiguously an ordi- nary working than painting the design of the Stars and Stripes is a flag, it is perhaps a more effective implementation of modernist concerns than the Johns example. In terms of our use of Room Service, and dances like it, as counterexamples to Beardsley's characterization of dance, it is important to iter- ate that these dances are able to articulate the modernist theme of anti-illusionism precisely because their movements are completely practical-a literal performance of a task- with no superfluity of expressiveness. A related, though less persuasive reason to believe that Room Service is a dance (specifically, an art dance) is that it performs a major (though not essential) function of art in general and art dancing in particular. Namely, it symbolical- ly reflects major values and preoccupations of the culture from which it emerged. In other words, it behaves the way we expect dances to behave. Its anti-illusionist stance and its disavowal of representation, formal decorativeness, and the kinds of expressiveness found in most modern dance (e.g., Graham, Humphrey, and Limon) evince a reductive bias, a quest to get down to basics, to eschew the layers of conven- tion, coded symbolism, and elaborate structure that "ob- struct" the spectator's perception of movement. This search for fundamentals is in many respects utopian. Nevertheless, it does reflect a particular post-war mood-a positivist search for the hard facts of dance, bereft of illusionist "nonsense." Again, whether there are such hard facts is beside the point; it is the quest implied by this dance that reflects the temper of the times. And, to return to Beardsley's definition, Room Ser- vice reflects the values and prejudices of its cultural context be- cause of the sheer practicality of its movement. (Interestingly, a Labananalysis of Rainer's non-task dances of this period shows a striking similarity between the efficient motions used in work and those used in the dances: a somewhat narrow and medium level stance, an even flow of energy, and sagittal ges- tures-in two planes, forward and backward plus up and down-rather than the three-dimensional shaping, gathering, and scattering movements of much modern dance.)6 Dance Research Journal 15/1 (Fall 1982) 39</page><page sequence="4">Admittedly, Room Service is an extremely complex dance, with several levels of symbolic import. It is not our intention to argue that it is not expressive. For example, it communi- cates a conception of dance, albeit a reductive one, and, as the previous paragraph argues, it espouses identifiable values. However, this sense of expression is different from Beardsley's. It is not a matter of the movement having intensified, non- practical qualities, but of the movement implying certain polemical commitments, easily statable in propositions, due to the art-historical and cultural contexts in which the dance was produced. Here the propositional import of the dance hinges on the practicality of the movement; this level of expression, in other words, cannot be mapped in terms of an overflow of intensified qualities, above and beyond the func- tional. Though Room Service has propositional meaning, it is not what Beardsley calls a saying, nor is it a representation of a saying. Professor Beardsley's sayings are highly convention- alized signals, e.g., a wave of the hand is regularly associated with "hello." However, we do not "read" the significance of the movement in Room Service, but infer it as the best expla- nation of Rainer's choreographic choices within a specific historical context. Room Service might also be called expressive in the sense that the choreography metaphorically possesses certain anthropomorphic qualities; we have already called it "posi- tivist." It might also be called factual or objective. But each of these labels fits the dance specifically because of the theoret- ically "hard-minded," anti-illusionist position it promotes. That the subject is work in the context of a culture that often identifies art and dance with play also has expressive reper- cussions: the choreography is "serious" rather than "senti- mental" or "frivolous" (in the idiom of the Protestant ethic). Again, it is the choice of unadorned workings as its subject that is the basis of its expressive effect as well as the basis, as previously argued, of its being recognizable as an art dance. Given this, Professor Beardsley's stipulation, identifying dance with a superfluity of expressiveness above practical purposes, does not seem to fit the facts of a major work of post-modern dance and, by extension, a genre of which it is a primary example. Professor Beardsley's paper also raises issues relevant to post-modern choreography in the section where he argues that the basic constituents of dance are not bodily motions as such. Instead, Beardsley holds that dances are composed of actions that he calls "movings" and "posings." It is interesting to note that in certain post-modern dances and dance theoriz- ing it is presupposed that dance is fundamentally bodily motion and that the function of a dance is to make the spec- tator see bodily motions as such. The motive behind this enterprise derives from the modernist bias outlined earlier. In brief, in contemporary theoretical discussions of fine art, the conception of a painting as an ordinary object easily becomes associated with the idea that it is an object as such. It is a surface. Thus, the role of an artist like Jules Olitski is seen as acknowledging the flat surface of the painting. Painters are cast in a role akin to nuclear physicists, exploring the basic physical constituents of their medium, as if plumbing the mysteries of the atom. The result is paintings "about" paint or, to change media, films "about" celluloid. This anti-illu- sionist move is also in evidence in post-modern dance. Dances like Trisha Brown's Accumulation identify dance as a concat- enation of physical motions without any ostensible formal, conventional, expressive, or representational unity. Accumu- lation is a list of abstract gestures-simple rotations, bends, and swings of the joints and limbs-that are accumulated by repeating the first gesture several times, adding the second gesture and repeating gestures one and two several times, and so on. There are no transitions between gestures. Accumula- tion suggests a position about the nature of the basic elements of dance, a position which holds that dance consists of bodily motions. The philosophical problems raised by dances like Accumu- lation can be quite vexing.7 But in our opinion, such dances are not counter-examples to Beardsley's claim that dances are made up of actions and never mere bodily motions. Our reasons for believing this are, for the most part, contained in our gloss of Room Service. We have admitted that the search for the fundamentals of dance by post-modern choreographers is utopian. Making dances like Accumulation, which are designed to imply that dance essentially consists of bodily motions, requires that the basic movements chosen for the dance be purposively made so that a) they are not straightfor- wardly classifiable in terms of traditional categories of dance actions (e.g., Beardsley's "suggestings") and b) they are intel- ligible, due to their historical context, as rejections of the traditional categories. In meeting the first requirement, each movement is a type of action-namely, a refraining. Speci- fically, each movement is a studied omission of the movement qualities found in ballet and modern dance.8 In the context of the Sixties, this sort of refraining implied a commitment to the idea that dance consists primarily of bodily motions. How- ever, the movements used to articulate that position were actually anything but mere bodily motions. They were actions, refrainings whose implicit disavowal of the traditional qualities of dance movements enabled them to be understood as polemical. Thus, though we feel that certain developments in post-modern dance, specifically task dances, threaten Professor Beardsley's concept of dance, we do not believe that the existence of dances like Accumulation challenge Beards- ley's point that dances consist of actions rather than mere bodily motions. 40 Dance Research Journal 15/1 (Fall 1982)</page><page sequence="5">NOTES This paper was originally an invited response to Monroe Beardsley's paper for the expanded proceedings of the "Illuminating Dance" conference.
