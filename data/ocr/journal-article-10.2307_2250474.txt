Morality and Salvation AiY treatment of recent criticisms of Spinoza would be inex- cusably incomplete that paid no attention to the strictures that have been passed again and again upon the ethical principles and conclusions advocated by the philosopher; and, in spite of the difficulty of presenting and defending his views adequately in the space that remains to me, I propose to devote this final article to some such purpose. The alleged ethical shortcomings of Spinoza's philosophy are a somewhat older story than that of his personal moral integrity. It began in 1664 with the Blyenburgh correspondence, published in the Opera Posthuma thirteen years later, and it has continued without very much de'nouement down to recent times, appearing with some emphasis in the criticisms of de Burgh and Taylor.' This consistency is not to be wondered at in view of the almost uniformly parallel misunderstanding of the metaphysical basis and framework of Spinoza's theory throughout the whole period, and especially of the doctrines of cause, finite individuality, freedom, eternity, and duration; and above all, nay rather, at 1 W.

HALLETT: the root of all, the persistent assumption of the metaphysical priority of time-a conception denied a' outrttnce by Spinoza him- self. Such fundamental misinterpretations form an unpromising ground for effective criticism. Taylor is undoubtedly the most vehement of recent critics of this, as of other parts, of Spinoza's philosophy, though not the most careful, acute, and philosophical, for his aim is icono- clastic rather than elucidatory and critical in the better sense of the term: being directed towards the discrediting of " Spinoza- worship "1 rather than providing an effective criticism of the doctrine based upon a sufficiently serious effort to expound it. His reputation as a philosopher in our time, however, and the consequent ex cathedra effect of his assertions, render it expedient to treat his account with greater solicitude than its zealotry would otherwise invite. Logical slips of great importance may well be found in the work of the most eminent thinkers, but no philosopher could be called even competent who failed to detect incoherencies so blatant as those imputed to Spinoza by Taylor in relation to his ethical doctrine; or honest if, having seen them, he allowed them to stand in a work prepared for even posthumous publication with the meticulous care concentrated upon the Ethics for at least a duodecade. sNatural moral sense, or "personal religious faith " might well prompt a " refuisal to be logical " (and, not knowing its urgency, I am not prepared to blame subservience to the prompting), but not a refusal to admit the breach; yet I cannot discover, either in the Ethics or elsewhere, any hint that the doctrine of Spinoza is not "singleminded ". In the space at my disposal I can hardly expect to do more than lightly to indicate the manner in which I conceive the main ethical factors to find their place and exercise their functions within the Spinozistic metaphysics: viz. how, and how far, the finite singularis is free, the nature and efficiency of his moral endeavour, his true goo4, and the power that he possesses to find salvation from the " summum periculum " or " mortal disease " of the "vain and futile " flight ad consolatiunculas creaturulae. This does not mean, of course, that I seek to assimilate the ethical opinions expressed by Taylor with the system of Spinoza: in so far as ethical " objectivity " is taken as implying that " good " is other than a " relational quality "; the moral law as independently imposed on the individuals who "ought " to be governed by it; moral freedom as entailing "indetermination " in the real; there is no need to take pains 1 T., p. 301.</page><page sequence="3">SOME RECENT CRITICISMS OF SPINOZA. 3 to show that Spinoza is in agreement with Taylor, for plainly he is not. But, on the other hand, the absence of a Kantian insistence on " duty ", " obligation ", and anti-moral " in- clination ", is no proof of " naturalism " ; nor is the exclusion of praise and blame a sign of ethical neutrality. I have suggested more than once in these articles that the root of most of the objections that critics have raised to the philosophy of Spinoza generally has been the inveteracy of their own empiricism and " objectivism ". In their anxiety to avoid " speculative exposition " they have accepted the very thing that their anxiety should have been directed against, viz. an izmaginative exposition in terms of principles ignored or rejected by Spinoza himself. This is eminently true in the realm of ethics: having interpreted the earlier Parts of the Ethics wherever even remotely possible in! terms of * the metaphysical priority of time; having thought always of causality as essentially temporal and transeunt; they receive a shiock when suddenly confronted by propositions in the later Parts grounded on the priority of eternity, and the essential and prior immanence of causality. The inflexible exponent or willing critic thereupon concludes that the philosopher is guilty of a " refusal to be logical ", of introducing "'extra beliefs" "going beyond what :his metaphysical postulates can justify ",1 of " breaking away . . .from the very foundations of his own doctrine ; 2 whereas in fact these later propositions, and the whole ethical doctrine, so far as it concerns liberation from the passions, are the very crux of the system,,pointing back to its fundamental postulates. and to the true interpretation of the propositions to which an exclusively mechanistic turn had naively' been given by the empiricistically biased interpreter. i. " Automatum Spirituale" Let me first of all underline some of the more important features of the account of the finite individual that I have at- tributed to Spinoza in contrast with those too often, and uncritically, assumed by his critics, and even by his expositors. " The mere description of man 4s an automaton spirituale ", says Taylor,3 " will never satisfy any thinker who, like Kant, takes the moral law seriously." iHe does not explain in what sense he understands the term " automaton ", though the general tenor of his discussion suggests that he takes it as connoting a self-acting " perpetual motion "-machine operating 1 T., p. 301. 2 T., p. 299. 3 T., p. 291.</page><page sequence="4">4 H. F. HALLETT: under the principles of transeunt causality and reciprocity. His discussion also implies that Spinoza himself actually describes the finite temporal individual as an automatum spirituale. I do not know whether Taylor is really ignorant that Spinoza makes no such assertion: the term is introduced by the philosopher in the course of his discussion of the " true idea ", and then only with a qualifying " quasi "; and its ap- plication must thus be limited to the finite mind as thinking adequate or true ideas, and not as involved in pseudo-cognizance: " True science proceeds from the cause to the effects . . . the mind acts according to certain laws, as if it were an automatum spirituale ".1 But, even so, nothing was further from the mind of Spinoza than the notion that true knowledge can be explained as a totum of transeunt psychical " causes ", or even an " impli- catory linkage " of reciprocating and successive judgements. The essence of truth, we have seen, is the inward self-generation of concepts whereby the reality of a conceptum is certified. Now this condition is only fulfilled in so far as the rmind thinks; it has only indirect bearing on the imaginative " nimbus " that is by far the most extensive part of human experience in " this present life ", and is the " field ", though not the source, of moral endeavour. It is to Deus quatenus finitus that the term " automatum spirituale" is applicable in relation to man; and this only because it has absolute application to creative Deus quatenus infinitus alone. It is the eternal finite in constitutive communitas with its complement in Natura naturata that acts " quasi aliquod automatum spirituale " That communitas is partially occulted in " this present life" as struggle, opposition and co-operation, sub specie durationis, and the moral life is the effort to retrieve it. I have again and again reminded the reader that the imputation of Lockian and Humian characteristics to the Spinozistic " idea" is a mischievous anachronism; there is no ground whatever, or none that will stand inspection, for Taylor's dogmatic assertion that " Spinoza simply identifies a man's mind with the series of his acts of cognition and volition" ; 2 so that his statement that " when I say that I am engaged in a certain train of thought, I mean, or suppose myself to mean, something more than that such a train of thought is an actual occurrence" has no pertinence as a comment on Spinoza, though it is per- fectly true that the philosopher does not attempt to avoid this I De Intell.

The integrity of the self is derived from its source: it is not superadded to its complexity or imaginative seriality; on the contrary, this is derived from the integrity. To begin with the seriality of sophisticated Imaginatio, and on that basis to seek for the integrity of personality, is only to pose an insoluble problem, and one insoluble ex hypothesi; for, as Hume found, there is no integrity and no power to be dis- covered among separate " ideas "-nor, I may add, even among temporally, causally, or implicationally, linked serial " ideas ". Wholeness and efficiency must be sought at the source if pseudo- wholeness and conatus are to be explained in the sophisticated " nimbus " of Imaginatio. And this is evidently the view of Spinoza, for throughout, as JoachiM 2 says, he "implies that 'we' have an experience: that a single and continuous con- sciousness combines (or contains combined in itself) all the ideae which form the complex of our men-tal life " ; it is indeed the integrity of the finite mode as it issues from its creative source that is the root of the " conatus in suo esse perseverare " that characterizes (and indeed constitutes) the durational suburb of finite individuality. The " eternal part " of the mind is in- tegral, though in a derived and abstracted degree, for it springs from eternal immanent causality that derives from the self- generating Natura; and in its distinction it is proximately generated in se. But the " durational part " is no more than the eccentricized " perspective " of that eternal communitas which determines the degree of the perfection of the finite self in Natura naturata, thus reduced to process with a nisus derived from the causality of the maczocosm, that finitely urges the temporalized microcosm towards an integrity that its tempor- ality indefinitely postpones, and its finiteness truncates. The " unity " of the serial mind of Imaginatio is an indefinitely postponed unity only because it issues durationally from the eternal unity of the finite self under the creative nisus of Natura. Complete integrity is thus reserved to Natura; the integrity of the finite singularis, its individuality, its personality, is im- perfect: quatenus eternal it is limited in amplitude and derivative; quatenus durational it is further limited by its alienation from itself and from God and from things, and its causality is in- adequated to conatus. In Natura naturata it is a derived abstract automatum; in " this present life " it is no more than a " pse'd- automatum ". 1 T. p. 148. 2 A Study of the Ethics of Spinoza, p. 140, note 1.</page><page sequence="6">6 If. F. HALLETT: ii. Desire and Good Spinoza's psychological doctrine of desire, of its relation to conatus and to its object, as developed in Part III of the Ethics, is usually taken by his critics as if it foreclosed the philosophy to ethical development which requires the emendation of desire, the adequating of conatus, and the substitution of a moral or " frue " good for the " natural " good. Closer attention to the matter will, I think, show that it does no such thing. The well-known assertion that "we neither strive for, will, seek, nor desire anything because we think it good, but, on the contrary, we judge a thing to be good because we strive for, will, seek, or desire it", 1 has been the constantly recurrent text upon which depreciation of Spinoza's supposed amoralism has been hung. Taylor's rehash of this familiar polemic will serve as an example,: "on such an assumption neither a moral code nor a philosophy of morals is possible. Both are possible only on the presupposition that it is possible to pronounce on the worth of different human passions and desires by reference to a standard independent of the passions and desires to which it is applied ".2 This is an assertion to which, bating the term "independent ", Spinoza is in complete agreement, as his dis- tinction in the Tractatus de Intellectus Emendatione between the " vain and futile " goods of ordinary endeavour, and the " true good " of the philosophic life strongly suggests, and the references in the Preface to Part IV of the Ethics (where the specifically ethical discussion begins) to the " exemrplar " neces- sary for ethics completely attest. Taylor is willing to admit the deliverance of " the great Greek tradition " that what we desire is always the "apparent good ", but "the ' apparent good' and the 'good' are commonly different things ".3 With Spinoza's imputed implication that " ' this is good' means that this is being actually pursued " he connects " the much admired proposal to treat moral actions exactly as though they were geometrical figures "-'a proposal that Taylor characterizes as " really ridiculous " because " it is to ignore their specific character as moral ".4 Then follows a passage in which the familiar Blyenburgian ignoratio elenchi is once more expounded, but with remarkable carelessness or naivety of interpretation more worthy of that " metaphysical tiro " than of the author of The Elements of Metaphysics. To this I will presently return. Spinoza's dictum is, of course, (i) an assertion that- " good " is a " relational quality ": a thing is good not in itself out of I Eth. III, ix Sch. 2 T., p. 282. 3Ibid. 4Ibid.</page><page sequence="7">SOME RECENT CRITICISMS OF SPINOZA. 7 all relation to -an other, but good for an other; "good mneans "good for ". It is as meaningless to assert the goodness of a thing without stating or assuming for what it is good as to assert that the sun is distant without stating or assuming from what it is distant. " Good simpliciter " means good for the person judging, or for similar persons ; " good in itself " means not good out of all relation to a referent, but good not as means to some other object, or under special conditions, or in combina- tion with something else, but as complete objective end in itself, i.e. none the less for such and such a referent or class 'of referents. But (ii) it is an assertion, further, that this relativity of good to a referent is no mere formal relativity like that of " distance where the referent is a mere "origin" of measurement; nor even a " qualitative relativity" like that of a colour where the referent is an " origin " of estimation (as when we say " that mountain looks purple to me "); but the goodness is a function of the referent who is " gooded " (or, as -we say, " bettered ") by relation to the thing said to be good. The thing's goodness is its capacity to " good " the referent. In and by itself even the thing said to be good in itself has no such attribute, and the supposition that it has is only another instance of our proneness to allow verbal expression to govern philosophical opinion. The goodness of a thing is the betterment of the self that is judged to lie within its capacity when appropriately related to that self. Now this " judgement " is, of course, an action of the self that judges the thing to be good; and it takes various forms accord- ing to the perfection enjoyed by the self: it may be no more than a semi-blind craving or appetite for the object; it may be a conscious striving or desire for it; or the will to possess it.' But these forms of conatus, one and all, are related to the thing that is the object of the endeavour as involving an estima- tion or " judgement" of value. Thus the value of a thing depends upon its nature (or our estimate of its value depends upon our idea of its nature), but not on this taken absolutely in itself. The value depends upon its nature taken in relation to the capacity of that nature to " good " the self (or our judge- ment of its value depends upon our judgement of this capacity); and it is in this sense that a thing is good because we " strive for, will, seek, or desire it ": apparently good where our conatus involves assent to an uncertain or unassured judgement; truly good where it is certified or assured in its estimate. 1 Cf. Eta. III, Ix Sch. for the relations of "will ", " desire ", and "4 appetite ".</page><page sequence="8">8 H. F. HALLETT: But further, (iii) this " gooding " of the self can only be so described in so far as we estimate the nature of the self in rela- tion to an "exemplar ", and it is here that we pass to the conception of the morality of good as distinct from its psy- chological or physical character. It is often forgotten that Spinoza's dicttum is formulated in the psychological discussions of Part III of the Ethics and not in the ethical discussions of Parts IV and V where its morality is explicitly considered. Yet Spinoza himself draws emphatic attention to this transition in the Preface to Part IV which Taylor appears to have read to little advantage. " One and the same thing may at the same time be both good and evil and indifferent. . . . (Yet) we must retain these words. For since we desire to form for ourselves an idea of man upon which we ;lay look as an exemrplar of human nature, it will be of service to us to retain these expressions in the sense I have mentioned. By 'good ' therefore, I under- stand in the following pages everything which we are certain is a means by which we may approach nearer and nearer to the exemplar of human nature we set before us. By 'evil', on the contrary, I understand everything which we are certain hinders us from reaching that exemplar ". Spinoza, it is true, is here speaking of the exemplar of " man ", and not of " this or that man ", for it is Ratio directed upon communia that is the cog- nitive source of the moral philosophy of Parts IV and V (ad xx); and an effort of speculative development is required to identify the intrinsic exemplar of this or that man with his real singular essence as Deus quatenus finitus: the source of his moral effort after his own proper perfection, i.e. after integration with his other and with his source, that has formal expression in the absolute imperative of morality, and inadequate manifestation in the conatus in suo esse perseverare. But speculative develop- ment is, of course, tabu among determined critics of Spinoza. The " minutest " scholar and the most zealous iconoclast, how- ever, can hardly afford to ignore the doctrine of the rational exemplar of human nature. One reason why Spinoza's dictum, has been resented is the facility with which it may be misinterpreted as making altruistic conduct incredible; and I think that it is true that it does involve the incredibility of what I may, perhaps, call " pure altruism", i.e. the notion that a man can pursue the good of another in absolute independence of his own good. But to my mind it is a self-evident proposition that the good of a man is his own good e'ven when the thing called good is the benefit of another. The real altruist finds his own betterment in the good of others;</page><page sequence="9">SOME RECENT CRITICISMS OF SPINOZA. 9 he may thus sacrifice (if that is the right term) some immediate, temporal betterment of some subordinate part of his nature, but not of his own true or eternal nature. That his own true good should be totally divorced from that which he makes his moral object seems to me incredible, for it supposes a moral action without a motive. Nor is this to explain away altruismn as " rationalized " egoism; candid readers who have understood, the Spinozistic notion of moral improvement (viz. the emendation, of the intellect), and the distinction between the preser4ation. of temporal being and its improvement (i.e. the preservation of moral being) will need little beyond the statements of Ethices IV, xxxiii-xxxvii, xl, xhvi, and App. ix, together with the recognition of Spinoza's general principle that the real life of the finite self is its communitas with its other of all grades, to convince them of the essentially rational altruism of Spinoza's ethical doctrine. Now, according to Taylor, the priority of desire to good ex- cludes the distinction of right and wrong, of merit and demerit, and consequently debases morality to a distinction of private taste; and, he thinks, the result is that Spinoza's " ethical " theory developes as a combination of pococuranteism and ruthless brutality: tho murderer, e.g. must not be blamed, but he musti be killed like a venomous snake. A truly moral theory, on the contrary, will certainly blame him, but at the same time will regard him as " a man to whom we have obligations, and not a. dangerous animal ".1 The short reply to this account of Spinoza's doctrine is that it is not true that Spinoza makes no distinction between " apparent " and " true " good (as the opening sections. of the Tractatus de Intellectus Emendatione sufficiently attest, and the whole tenor of the latter propositions of the Ethics- emphasizes); and that it is most unphilosophical to take an extreme illustration as the adequate expression of a general principle.2 The persistence with which this type of criticism has recurred in the history of Spinozism, however, shows that such a laconic retort is in need of expansion to bring home its. incidence. Let me say at once that the root-cause of the difficulty is the 1 T., p. 283. 2 The man who " goes mad from the bite of a dog " and is " excused"' yet "rightly suffocated " (Ep. lxxviii) is hardly comparable with the6 relatively sane criminal. Spinoza merely accepted the common treat- ment of his day, regrettable as it may have been. But this affords no basis for a polemic against his ethical system. Many of the customs now accepted by Taylor will doubtless be regretted in future ages, yet they may be based on detail-ignorance rather than bad moral theory or nature.</page><page sequence="10">10 H. F. HALLETT: false interpretation of Spinoza's doctrine as a psychological "atomism": an atomic self is, and can be, no moral self, and so far as a man is degraded towards such a condition %in " this present life " under the disintegration of time and passion he suffers "perdition ". This is the summumn periculum of the moral life; and such a man is hardly a "man at all. The claracteristic moral agent, however, is in no such case: true, his state at this or that epoch of his temporal life is no adequate expression of his personal microcosmic nature as a member of the communitas of Natura naturata; but it is not." atomic His eternity is never far from him: in the very certainty of his reality he " feels and discovers by experience that he is eternal" 2 ago ergo sum; even his durational actuality as he persists in love and strife with his environment liftsl him above mere atomism-conor ergo sum. In so far as a man acts his ideas are adequately caused from within his own nature; in so far as he struggles they are inadequately caused, partly from within and partly (and imaginatively) from without; in so far as he is passive he is nothing. The false supposition that there is an independent natural order of temporal causes that stands in the way of morality and negates freedom is the sole ground of the supposed insoluble riddle elaborated by de Burgh 2 as to " how man can ever rise . . . from a lower plane of knowledge to a higher ", how he can sever " the deterministic chain " and initiate " the saving process of liberation ". The " fr-reaching incoherence " in Spinoza's philosophy imputed by de Burgh, is no more than a deep-seated incoherence in the mind of the writer himself. When he agrees with Guzzo 3 that there is a contradiction in Spinoza's statement that hatred is increased by reciprocated hatred but can be destroyed by love ",4 he forgets that in so far as there is integration (as there must be) in " this present life " esse is posse, just as in man's eternal life of corn- munitas esse is frui, and in God esse is creare. The summum periculu*n of the bad man is the approximation for him, under the dispersal of time, of esse and non posse: " the wages of sin is death ". In the life of struggle undoubtedly there is always a limit to what a man can do; but that he is unable to do any- thing at all because his actions are determined a praeterito is a gloss derived from an anachronistic, theory of nature, and intro- 1 Eth.

At all stages of its emanation and salvation the finite individual transcends its temporal actuality and participates in th-e eternal nisus. Nothing that possesses any degree of individuality (i.e. of reality) is a purely temporal being determined by mechanistic " causality "-for this is the realm of non-being, both individual and causal. Though a man may, in " this present life ", be partly'subjected to the causality of the -confused " self-other " imaginatively represented as the transeunt causality of an " other-absolute ", and thus in servitude " participate in non-being ",1 yet even here he is in part deter- mined by his own immanent causality, and is thus so far free. And this freedom entails an urge towards salvation, nigh- impotence it may be, but authentic; for without this he is nothing. The limitation of the ability of a man to achieve salvatikn is not independent opposition by mechanistic " causes but the negatinvty of his own actuality-limitation to restricted steps in the "emendation of the intelloct "; and though this may be, and often is, hypostasized to seeming ineluctability by the pretence that is " privation ", it is never absolute, and may be mitigated by the right use of moral leisure, by the cultivation of "exertions ",2 by the aid of the better instructed or better natured, and by that happy contingency that is sometimes called " the grace of God " by those for whom God is no more than the " asylum of ignorance ". iii. " Cum Natura Pugnat"; "A Quo Natura Abhorret" It would be instructive to examine in detail the objections originally advanced by Blyenburgh, and Taylor's summary account of certain of them, and I hope to be able to do this else- where. Here, however, I have space only to consider one, and not the happiest, of their efforts. It concerns the " motives " actuating the finite temporal being in its movement towards or away from a greater perfection. Blyenburgh had argued that if, as Spinoza had asserted, to God evil is no more than negation (though it is " privation " to the sinner) so that God has no knowledge of evil, it is incredible that he will punish the evil man: "what reasons are there, then, why I should not eagerly commit all villanies, since I escape the judge ? Why not enrich myself by detestable means ? why not do whatever pleases us indisdriminately, and whatever the flesh prompts us to ? "- 1 " The wicked . . . are no more than tools in the hand of the master, that serve unconsciously, and perish in the service " (Ep. xix). 2 I.e. " active affectus " as opposed to " passions ".</page><page sequence="12">12 H. F. HALLETT: and so on through the usual polemical catalogue of crimes per- missible to the Spinozist. Spinoza's reply is that morality is not a mere matter of sanctions, or obedience to a feared authority, but the essential life of the soul, just as sin is its essen- tial suicide: " surely he who only abstains from (crime) from fear of punishment (which I hope is not the case with you) in no way acts from love, and embraces virtue as little as possible. So far as I am concerned, I avoid or endeavour to avoid crimes because they expressly oppose my individual nature (expresse cum ,mea singulari natura pugnant), and would make me stray from the love and knowledge of God." 1 This vigorous sally into the moralistic camp proved too much for Blyenburgh's urbanity and only extreme irritation could have concealed from him the ignoratio that informs the ana- logical self-defensive distortion of his reply: " You avoid the things that I call wicked because they oppose (pugnant) your individual nature, but not because they involve vice. You refrain from doing them just as we refrain from eating food that disgusts us (a quo natura nostra abhorret). Surely he who avoids evil things merely because they disgust him cannot brag about his virtue." 2 The same irritation is observable also in Taylor's discussion of this point: Spinoza, he says, refrains from acting like Nero because such actions do not agree with his nature-" exactly as I abstain from certain dishes because they do not agree with my digestion";3 and he rightly commends the assertion of Blyenburgh that " he who only abstains from crimes because they disagree with his par- ticular nature cannot plume himself on his virtue ". It is nothing to Taylor that what Spinoza had said was that he seeks to avoid crime because it is in conflict with his nature, whereas Blyenburgh sophistically substituted the gloss that this means that he does so only because, like offensive food, it disgusts him; and unlike Blyenburgh, who at least had the excuse of provocation, he neatly covers the ambiguity under the question-begging phrase " do not agree with my digestion "-which may mean either that the food is unsuitable or that it is merely disliked. The issue is that between mere taste and grounded judgement: if Blyen- burgh had said that Spinoza avoids crimes as he avoids food that is unsuited to his alimentary nature, food that he cannot 'Ep. xxi. Cf. Eth. V, xli Sch. 2Ep. xxti. 3 T., p. 284. It is.characteristic of Taylor's treatment of Spinoza that he attributes to Spinoza himself the analogy proposed by his opponent -including the parentheses and textual reference to reassure the trustful reader. The labour of iconoclasm demands no nice precision.</page><page sequence="13">SOME RECENT CRITICISMS OF SPINOZA. 13 digest, the analogy would at least have had some pertinence, though it would not have relieved his irritation or done any- thing to clarify the issue. The whole distinction of virtue and vice turns upon the true judgement of the former and the false judgement of the latter. The good man is one whose deeds and thoughts are determined in accordance with the clear idea of God; the bad man one whose deeds and thoughts ar e deter- mined only in accordance with confused ideas of " earthly things ". The latter acts from taste at best, the former from a judgement of propriety based upon a true idea of the relation of self with complement and source. The fact is that Blyenburgh introduced the analogy with the sole and sophistical intention of scoring a debating point, and Taylor " improves" on him by attributing the analogy to Spinoza himself. Blyen- burgh was, of course, as Taylor says,." simply right " in saying that morality is more than a matter of taste: he was not right, nor is Taylor who should have known better, in supposing that the principle is in opposition to the ethical doctrine of Spinoza. The superstructure that Taylor erects on this childish misinter- pretation is equally irrelevant; to say that Spinoza's explanation of the distinction of the good act or man and the bad one, by reducing it to a difference in degree of realitas, fails because " degree of reality " means nothing (the apostle Paul being no more real than the emperor Nero) 1 overlooks the whole structure of Spinoza's epistemology, according to which realitas is action, i.e. self-.generation or generation through self;, and Spinoza was as little likely as Kant to " equivocate on the word perfeat ".2 I do not even see why it should be supposed that Spinoza's rejection of anthropomorphism in theology necessarily implies an equal objection to theomorphism in ethics, i.e. to saying that the good man is " more like God "-certainly he is more like Deus quatenus finitus. When, however, Taylor goes on to offer his " best defence " of Spinozism in this matter in terms of the extended insight of the good man " into the universal order and concatenation of things ", the term " concatenation of cause and effect throughout nature " indicates the nature of the "insight " of which he is thinking. Undoubtedly, a " great man of science " in this sense of the term " insight " may be " a very bad man indeed ", just as a man who has not this sort of exceptional excellence may' be highly virtuous. But here, once again, Taylor's apparent ignorance of Spinozistic episte- mology blinds him to the significance of the insistence on the " emendation of the intellect " as the philosophic road to virtue. T., p. 285. 21bid.</page><page sequence="14">14 H. F. HALLETT: As to the " curious silence " of Spinoza about " justice " and "obligation ", it is not impertinent to mention that Plato him- self shows also a curious silence about moral obligation, and ,speaks of justice, not in terms of debitum, but as " the health of the soul ". The prominence of the conception of duty in Kantian doctrine is connected with the transcendental mode of approach to ethical philosophy, the value of which I should be the last to depreciate, and not to his superiority over all others as a moralist. Every moralist worthy of consideration takes " obligation " in some form or other; as a foundation-concept of ethics, though the object of the debitum varies from theory to theory. Certainly Spinoza did so, and not alone in the impressive opening sections of the Tractatus de Intellectus Emendatione, and in the insistence on the difficulty of the moral life in the closing words of the Ethics; it is implicit throughout the whole ethical system which cannot be understood at all if it is denied or ignored. Take for instance Spinoza's analysis in the letter to Blyenburgh following that to which I have been referring: " For example, Nero's matricide in so far as it contained something positive was not a crime; for Orestes too did the same outward deed, and had the same intention of killing his mother,.and yet he is not blamed, at least not in the same degree as Nero. What then was Nero's crime ? Nothing else than that by this deed he showed that he was ungrateful, unmerciful, and disobedient. . . . God was not the cause of (these things), although he was the cause of the act and the intention of Nero." 1 The action itself as an action has its own, perfection or reality, and as such may be said to be either virtuous or vicious according to its relation to the moral order. The good soldier kills the enemy in the interest of his " country " (i.e. the communitas that its organization subserves), and through his country the communitas of mankind; the murderer's same deed is for his own presumed private advantage at the expense of another, and ultimately of each man's civic communitas in which the murderer himself must participate, and thus contrary to general communitas. This is the " priva- tion " of his act that constitutes it a villany while the same act in the good soldier is virtuous' It is not the deed, or the in- tention, that is virtuous or vicious but the response to the demand of the man's own moral nature either for obedience to moral precepts or to secure and ensue communitas with God and with things. This is what we demand of ourselves: our proper perfectiohl as eternal microcosms in constitutive corn- 1 Ep. xxiii.</page><page sequence="15">SOME RECENT CRITICISMS OF SPINOZA. 15 mrunitas with our complement and our source iff operative in the moral consciousness as the nisus to fuller communitas sub specie durationis congruent with our insight into moral principle. Nero's action was vicious in proportion to his insight into its contrariety to moral law, whether conceived as the law of God or the nature of the real. If " knowing the better he chose the worse " his act was vicious because disobedient, though such a choice of the worse is possible only in so far as knowledge of the better is defective. He who really knows the better, i.e..as certified knowledge and no mere dogma or hearsay-opinion, cannot choose the worse. Thus to Blyenburgh's question whether.a mind for which the pursuit of lust and the perpetration of crime are not in conflict (non pugnaret 1) but in agreement with its individual nature, would have any "ground for virtue that would necessarily persuade it to do good and avoid evil ", Spinoza replies that the question " supposes a contradiction ", as if one asked whether on the supposition that suicide is in accordance with a man's reality he ought not to hang himself: for of course he ought. In relation to such a perverted human nature crimes would be virtuous because they would best realize the man's true nature. But that there could be such a man is precisely what Spinoza's whole doctrine denies. The question that Blyenburgh should have asked (and perhaps thought -he was asking) is: how can a man, here and now in " this present life ", when he at once desires to pursue lust and crime, and yet also entertains the demand of his individual nature to seek communitas with his other, or to obey the moral law, " pull himself together " (se cogere) to obey the demand and eschew the desire ? For this is certainly a matter of crucial importance for practical morality, the answer to which must be in terms either of the " emendation of the intellect " or of the love or veneration of the mind for God as lawgiver-the one being the philosophic way of enlightenment, the other the way of obedience. iv. Moral Improvement We have seen that according to Spinoza the moral life is not in essence a temporal movement towards the improvement of human nature but an approximation to that nature by which " this present life " approaches the reality of eternal communitas in Natura naturata. But it will be objected, and I think justi- fiably, that the real issue is how this approximation is actualized from.the point of view of the temporal individual at this or that ' The word is here Blyenburgh's own.</page><page sequence="16">16 H. F. HALLETT: moment of his present life. How is a man's actual " nature" saved from its unnatural actuality and approximated to its real nature ? Is the improvement inherent in temporal practice, or does it demand some special " effort " which may or may not be forthcoming on this or that occasion ? And is this ," effort ", too, inherent when it is present and irretrlevable when it is absent ? These are searching questions, and in spite of their somewhat question-begging formulation (under the sug- gestion of temporal causality, transeunt or final) I will attempt to make clear the kind of answers entailed by the philosophy of Spinoza. Let me, in the first place, deal briefly with the relatively sub- sidiary question of the inherence of improvement in temporal practice. It is empirically obvious that practice does not necessarily tend towards moral improvement: men get more vicious as well as more virtuous in the course of " this present life ". "Practice makes perfect ", but not morally so; " ex- perience teaches ", but it does not necessarily teach morality. The man of inflexible " good will " who does "improve" with experience already enjoys the root of morality, and improves primarily in the adjustment of means to ends. He becomes morally better chiefly in the sense of more effective. The man of " weak will " makes little improvement of any kind save in the art of avoiding painful issues; and the man of vicious will may even become more viciously effective and more confirmed in wickedness. But who cannot see that the validity of these statements is based upon the sophisticated intellectual schema under which they are proposed ? What is this " will " that is characterized as " good ", " weak ", or " vicious ", and how is it supposed to operate in relation to the man's deeds ? Is it something that a man has together with his impulses, appetites, desires, etc., and in addition to his intelligence; or is it something that he is, while also being impulsive, appetitive, desiderative, and intelligent ? And does his effective will determine his actions transeuntly in accordance with or in opposition to his impulses, appetites, and desires ; or is this co-operation or struggle immanent in the very man himself; or partly immanent and partly transeunt? And how is his intelligence related to his will and his impulses, appetites, and desires ? Is it a mere means to the practical effectiveness of the will, and of the desires, appetites, and impulses of the struggling or co-operating causes ", or is it biased in favour of, or against, the will, the desires, etc.? Indeed, is not the whole nomenclature significant of abstraction, sophistication, and hypostasization of entita</page><page sequence="17">SOME RECENT CRITICISMS OF SPINOZA. 17 imaginationis: of vague exhortatory or dehortatory utility, but with no legitimate place in an analysis of the moral situ- ation-its prima facie appearance of definition and expository lucidity being but the cloak of real confusion, misconstructioQn, and hermeneutic impotence ? It is greatly to the credit of Spinoza that he firmly refuses to discuss the ethical problem in terms of any such jejune rigmarole: " will ", cc desire ", CC appetite ", are' alternative expressions for the conatus in suo esse perseverare 1 which is " nothing but the actual essence of the thing itself ",2 and is the imperfected expression of the eternal actio that is the proper perfection of the thing in the communitas of Natura naturata. Further- more, " will " (or the conatus qua related to the mind alone)- is identical with the intelligence,3 which is by nature causal, though in the case of finite intelligence derivatilely causal.4 There is thus no need to suppose the introduction of some extraneous " effort " to make an idea effective; though I have admitted that the question does remain as to how we can secure those more adequate ideas with their superior effectiveness which are the root of temporal moral improvement. Let me say at once that by "securing" these I mean not merely " entertaining " them as dicta derived by hearsay, or from the opinions of experts, but truly thinking them as " beyond a peradventure "-for only so can they be genuine ideas, certified or assured, and by nature effective: or indeed be truly said to be " secured ". There are two main ways of achieving this result according to Spinoza, corresponding to two main types of morality: the morality of obedience and the morality of enlightenment, as I shall call them. To these we may add, for the sake of completeness, and also; because of its prominence in human life, the pseudo- morality of sanctions. Spinoza has a good deal to say about the first two, as well as admitting the practical utility of the morally deficient third. (a) The Morality of Obedience The reader will recall that in the course of his correspondence with Blyenburgh, Spinoza explained that the sin of Nero in killing his mother consisted not in the outward deed or inward intention but in the " ingratitude, mercilessness, and disobedience; that informed it; 5 and it is one of the chief contentions of the 1 Eth. III, ix Sch. 2 Ibid., vii. 3Eth. II, xlix Cor. 4 Ibid., xlviii. 5Ep. xxiii. 2</page><page sequence="18">18 H. 1, HALLETT Tractatus Theologico-Politicus that the Bible teaches no meta- -physical doctrines about the nature of God and his relation to meix, but solely such knowledge as is needful to convince men that he is " the perfect pattern of the true life ' "It is the object of the Bible to make men not learned but obedient ".2 "A man is pious or impious in his beliefs only in so far as he is thereby incited to obedience, or derives from them licence to sin and rebel. If a iman by believing what is true becomes rebellious his creed is impious; if by believing what is false he becomes obedient his creed is pious; for the true knowledge of God comes not by commandment but by divine gift. God has required nothing from men but a knowledge of his divine justice and charity: and that, not as necessary to scientific accuracy, but to obedience ". It is on this basis that Spinoza formulates the essential dogmas of universal religion: the divine existence, supremacy, justice, and mercy; his unity, omni- presence, supreme right, dominion, and freedom; his right to human obedience, his laws of justice, mercy, and love towards one's neighbours; and the doctrine of salvation and perdition as dependent on obedience and disobedience respectively. Obedience to God as he is revealed through the prophets (i.e. not predicters of future events but interpreters of God's will), however, is not the only obedience that conduces to piety: " It is certain that duties towards one's country are the highest that men can fulfil . . . there can be no duty towards our neigh- bour which would not become an offence if it involved injury to the whole State, nor can there be any oflence against our duty towards our neighbour, or anything but loyalty in what we do for the sake of preserving the State. For instance, it is my duty 4 when my neighbour quarrels' with me and wishes to take my cloak, to give him my coat also; but if it b. thought that such conduct is hurtful to the maintenance of the State, I ought to bring him to trial, even at the risk of his being con- demned to death." 5 I Tr. Thieo.-Pol., xiii. 2 Ibid. 3 Ibid. 4 " In the abstract ", Elwes interpolates; "in a state of nature ", says Taylor blunderingly (T., p. 293). Spinoza, of course, does not suppose Christian morality to apply to the " state of nature ". It is my duty as a religious man believing the divine-revelation. 5 This is the passage on which Taylor founds his assertion that in his political theory Spinoza " ignores morality ". What, in fact, Spinoza asserts is that " ideal " morality only remains " ideal " under conditions essenti- ally ideal, or where the unideality of the conditions does not negate the effectiveness of the ideal demand-for reason cannot negate reason, and the State is a prior condition of the possibility of applying ideal morality.</page><page sequence="19">SOME RECENT CRITICISMS OF SPINOZA. 19 For the multitude, therefore, Spinoza conceives morality as in the main a matter of obedience to the commands, of God either as revealed by the prophets or as embodied in the State regarded as the rational basis of human survival. And such obedience, when truly such and not the effort to avoid sanctions, is based on belief in the prophetic revelation or' recognition of the superiority of the civic life. Reverence for God and for the State is what provides the superior efficiency that constitutes the strength of the moral ideas in their opposition to passion. The strength of the affectus of veneration or devotion 1 in so far as it is a continuant that more or less uniformly moderates the fragmentary passions is for the most part, with the majority of men, in normal times, sufficient. The man of simple faith, or the true patriot, will be obedient, not merely from fear of perdition or the hope of salvation, or again, from fear of the gallows or the hope of civic reward, but from natural piety or native civic virtue. In so far as he is,'it is the love of God or the love of his concives that constrains him; and these are not passions but " exertions ": principles of integrity and co-operation, and -not principles of alienation and strife. This is the morality of obedience at its best and surest. Doubtless it is easily confused with the pseudo-morality of sanctions, and doubtless it is often contaminated with it (just as it may be partially elevated, by insight into the harmony of the laws and commandments with reason, to a genuine morality of enlighten- ment), but it is distinct from both. Obedience can only rightly be so called in so far as the motive is no extraneous passion artfully imposed by the law-giver or the prophet, but devotion to accepted and venerated authority. The pseudo-morality of sanctions lacks the inward reality of morality. It is in fact a sort of pre-morality, and I have no space to set forth Spinoza's views of its value and ethical contemptibility. In relation to the civic State it is, of course, essential-men being what they are: "although aft are persuaded that religion teaches every man to love his neighbour as himself . . . yet . . . this per- suasion has too little power over the passions. It avails, indeed, in the hour of death when disease has subdued the very passions In the " state of nature " Christian morality would be wholly inapplicable; thus to apply it unconditionally in the. " civic state " so as to undermiiie that state would be to cast out Beelzebub by means of Beelzebub-a process advantageous only to Beelzebub himself. 'Veneration is astonishment (i.e. imagination of a thing as egregious) at a thing much superior to ourselves; and is devotion in so far as it is united with love for it (Eth. III, lii Sch.).</page><page sequence="20">20 E. F. HALLETT: and man lies inert, or in temples where men hold no traffic, but least of all where it is most needed, in the lawcourt or the palace. . . . Reason can, indeed, do much to restrain and moderate the passions, but . . . the road which reason herself points out is very steep; so that such as persuade themselves that the multitude, or men distracted by politics, can ever be induced to live according to the bare dictate of reason, must be dreaming of the golden age- of the poets, or of a stage-play." 1 And what is true of " the bare dictate of reason " is true also in great measure of the religious and civic sentiments. As to the ethical value of this pseudo-morality I need only refer the reader -to the indignant words of Ethices V, xli Sch. and to Spinoza's sly dig at Blyenburgh's " virtue ". (b) The Morality of Enlightenment I have already suggested that the maimidifficulties that have been felt by critics of Spinoza's central ethical doctrine arise from their failure to understand and to apply the causal doctrine upon which his whole philosophy is framed-particularly in relation to human activity sub specie durationis. In the real, finite and infinite, there is no transeunt causality; for this is the eccentric appearance of immanent genesis emanating from the self-reference of the finite self, by which the complement by communitas with which in Natura naturata the finite self is real, is partially occulted and thus makes appearance as an other. If now the finite self were a mere " finite centre " this self-reference would result in its diminution sub specie temporis to nonentity -a condition only asymptotically approached by the ens simplicissirmum. Man is a microcosm of Natura, and his self- reference involves him therefore only in partial impotence: he is, even in " this present life ", in part eternal and has adequate knowledge of God and ,co-operation with " things ". His tem- porality partially inadequates that knowledge to Imaginatio and brings him into strife with things as imaginatively alienated. Thus transeuncy is not something independently limiting him ab extra, but the shadow of his own self-referen6e or " original sin ". What is at issue, therefore, in moral improvement is not man's power over given external " causes ", but over him- self as he appears in the self-referent perspective-his power' to emend his intellect, to generalize his metaphysical relativity. This seems to be recognized so far by de Burgh when he ex- presses his ultimate dissatisfaction with Spinoza's theory, as 1 Tr. Pol., I, v.</page><page sequence="21">SOME RECENT CRITICISMS OF SPINOZA. 2i1 resident in the issue " how man can ever rise . . . from a lower plane of knowledge to a higher "; I but the whole issue is clouded for him because he takes transeunt causality as a metaphysical prior, and the " emendation of the intellect " as mechanistically limited by the existing impulses, desires, -etc., that appear as the actual essence of the man at the moment of action. So again, when Taylor says that consistency in the elaboration of the doctrine of " intellectual conversion " demands that Spinoza should " be prepared to hold that truth, at least truth about good, as truth, has an inherent attractive power which can master the emotions ", that " reason must be able to encounter and defeat'the passions in its own strength ",2 it is equally evident that he makes no distinction between the causality of reason and the pseudo-causality of the affectus, interpreting Spinoza's assertions that affectus can only be restrained or removed by opposing and stronger affectus,3 and that no affectus can be re- strained by " the true knowledge of good and evil " qua true, but only qua affectus,4 as meaning that " a true and adequate idea has in itself no more hold over our 'passional nature' than a false and inadequate one; it can only prevail if it happens to be associated with a more powerful 'affect ' ". This is but another example of the fatal mischief of attempting to expound Spinoza's philosophy under an anachronistic empiricistic schema. Taylor is not even checked in this enterprise by the statement of Ethices IV, viii interposed between the very propositions on which he bases his criticism: " Knowledge of good' and evil is 'nothing but an affectus of joy or sorrow in so far as we are con- scious of it", which makes it clear that determination by " knowledge of good and evil " is not determination by reason, but by Imaginatio (which is not necessarily false, but always in fact in some relativistic eccentric sense based on truth), and it is thus that it operates in the'temporal life. But this is not to say that truth is ineffective in practice, but only that in the imaginational life its effectiveness is represented sub specie affectus, i.e. as informing the passions and " exertions " of the actual essence of this or that man. So far is it from being true that reason can do nothing without the " chance association" of an affectus, reason alone is fully active, and the " exertions" of the durational mind are the imaginative expressions of that actio pura. " Killing truth " may not " glare upon" 4 the pas- sions and nullify them at the mere choice of the durational agent, 1 Great Thinkers (VIII): Spinoza. (Philosophy, XI, 1936); p. 286. 2 T., p. 287. E3 Eth. IV, vii. 4 Ibid., xiv. 5 T., p. 287.</page><page sequence="22">22 J. F. HALLETT: for the passions also have truth at their source, though relativized and truncated, but the "exertions " are the durational appear- ance of the actio of reason, sub specie conatus. In them the real eternal self lies perdu, and since temporal duration is no meta- physical prior, but a derivative of eternity, it is not in principle impossible, but only in fact a rarity, for the self to enjoy a " miraculous " conversion, or pentrification, by which the " exertions "'flame up to eternal action, nullifying the passions in the sudden (but not chosen) vision of the communitas of all things in the creative focus. The answer, then, to de Burgh's question "how man can rise, conformably to Spinoza's system, from a lower plane of knowledge to a higher ", is, first, that he cannot do so on this or that haphazard occasion by the exercise of " a motiveless choice between motives ",1 but, secondly, that he can do so because he is free in the measure of his actualized microcosmicity, i.e. he is partially self-determining in accordtance with the self- legislation inherent in his self-hood at all stages of his creation and emanation. By nature he is a self-enlightening individual: remove this power and he is nothing, at all. The root of freedom is in him, though never its completion sub specie durationis. In so far as he is at all, he has adequate and cQrtain knowledge, even if it is no more than the certainty of his own existence and finiteness, for this is his reality as a mind. And this adequate knowledge as such has self-generative, though derived, power. No man is a series of states, and no-one before Hume ever seriously suggested that he is-nor, perhaps, did Hume. Again, when Taylor says tha-t " Spinozism, like all ' natural- istic ' doctrines of morals, cannot consistently admit determina- tion by such a motive" 2 as the judgement of rightness, he only betrays his complete failure to understand the theory that he is so zealous to censure. Mere "rightness " is, in fact, the characteristic motive of " the morality of obedience "; and intelligible " rightness" is not other than accord with the deliverance of Deus quatenus finitus, the man's eternal self in the communitas of Natura naturata, which defines his true good, or what is his true profit. And this is his sufficient motive in so far as it is understood as certain: for in face of that know- ledge (as distinct from hearsay, dogmatic, or even venerated, opinion) no man can " choose the worse ". So far, then, as I have grasped the difficulties expounded by de Burgh and Taylor, they are generated and supported by the T., p. 291. 2 Ibid.</page><page sequence="23">SOME RECENT CRITICISMS OF SPINOZA. 23 false conception that the passions that oppose man's liberation operate as independent " forces " that are a part of his nature only as falling within the series' of states that we denominate "the man "-a conception wholly foreign to Spinoza. The passions d6rive their power from the immanency that they partially occult, or rather, of which they are the -partial occulta- tion. It is knowledge that is the freedom of the mind; and " learning " is no mechanistic process, but a process of self- enfranchisement. But, it may be objected, the passions stand in the way of learning! As well might we say that ignorance stands in the way of knowledge-an evident and trifling analytic .proposition. What stands in the way of learning is error, i.e. pretentious ignorance, constituted by " privation ": but this is no ineluctable impediment operating as a mechanistic " cause ", but an enemy with a traitor in his citadel ever seeking to open the gates. Spinoza never said, and, no-one with any real under- standing of the moral life will suppose, that the moral life is easy-a mere matter of free choice: the way of salvation for the isolated soul is indeed " steep " and " difficult ", nevertheless it may be found just because passion is no mechanistic " force ", and reason holds the key to its citadel. If critics of Spinoza will cease to imagine the human mind as a series of states, and their "causality ' as mechanistic, and will take the imaginative seriality and transeuncy as the imperfections of the durational mind, and not its native perfection, as derivatives and not as ultimates, they will see that " though strait is the gate and narrow is the way that leadeth unto life ", and " though few there be that find it ", there is nothing in the doctrine of Spinoza to suggest that it is impossible or a mere matter of haphazard. There is nothing actual in "this present life " that is not derived, directly or eccentrically or privatively, from eternal reality, finite or infinite; and consequently no durational " present " is utterly closed to the eternal. To be is to be active ; to be active is -to be free; consequently, nothing that in any degree is is doomred to perdition or saved by accident. It is saved sub specie durationis by its own " exertions ", informed by the Deus quatenus finitus that 'it eternally is, and durationally is, in Augustinian phrase, "towards ": as the theologians say, "Christ dwelleth in us ". "Indetermination " by mechanistic "causes " is undoubtedly the presupposition of morality; but this is nothing miraculous in universal etiology, for nothing is so determined. But absolute indetermination is the bankruptcy of science and morals alike. (Concluded.)</page></plain_text>
