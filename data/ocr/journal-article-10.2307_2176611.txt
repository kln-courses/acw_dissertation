<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Theory of Reality. An Essay in Metaphysical System upon the Basis of Human Cognitive Experience. By GEORGE TRUMBULL LADD, Professor of Philosophy in Yale University. New York, Charles Scribner's Sons, i899.-pp. xv, 556. Professor Ladd has been in the eye of the philosophical public for so many years that much can be taken for granted concerning any work on metaphysics that may issue from his hand. We can be cer- tain, before opening the book, that its knowledge is broad and accurate; that its psychology is well digested; that its method is the analysis of experience rather than speculative synthesis; that the spirit and the results of the sciences pervade its pages, and that its general standpoint is some form of theism sharply contrasting with both ma- terialism and absolute idealism. These general virtues of his Theoly of Reality may therefore be dismissed with a mere reference. Its not altogether agreeable style, however, is likely to secure less than justice for the able contents. To demand that an essay in meta- physics be a work of literary art would, of course, be unjust to the metaphysician; but a metaphysician may do himself equal injustice by an unfortunate division of labor between himself and his readers. The drift of Professor Ladd's discussions is generally plain enough, but the details often make excessive demands upon the patience of the reader. In places, too, a certain drift takes the place of per- spicuous arrangement and development of the topics. Of faulty proof-reading I have discovered but two instances-ffillt for flihit (p. 6 i ), and inh/bited for (apparently) independent (p. 5I2). The present discussion is a continuation of the line of thought most prominent in the author's Philosophy of Knowledge. It was there maintained that knowledge is always of a ' trans-subjective object,'</page><page sequence="2">628 THE PH.IL OSOPHICAL RE VIE W [VOL. VI1I. i. e., of realities; that the categories are forms of reality as well as of knowledge; that the knower has, in his own self-knowledge, an intuitive insight into reality; that other reals are known by analogy of the self, and that, finally, the being of the world is the life of a self. In the new volume the categories are interpreted seriatin in accordance with this ontology, and various features of the resulting scheme are coor- dinated so as to give a connected general view of the world. Of the twenty chapters, the first four are, in a broad sense, intro- ductory. Chapters V to XIV (inclusive) have to do with the ontological interpretation of the categories. By categories, Professor Ladd means the essential forms of knowledge under which men both conceive and perceive all they call real (p. 85). In view of the fact that no principle for the derivation of the categories is given, and that completeness of enumeration is not claimed (p. 84), one is at a loss to know what mean- ing to attach to ' essential,' and why 'perceive ' is added to ' con- ceive.' The list actually given is as follows: Quality, Relation, Change, Time, Space and Motion, Force and Causation, Quantity and Measure, Unity and Number, Form, Law, and Final Purpose (p. 67). Chapters XV to XIX (inclusive) contain the general view of the world just referred to, under the headings ' Spheres of Reality,' Matter,' 'Nature and Spirit,' 'The Actuality of the Ideal,' and 'The World and the Absolute.' The concluding chapter explains the relation of this work to the author's previous productions. Many of the conclusions of these chapters can be inferred from the author's known presuppositions. Thus, change and identity and relation in general find their content only in self-consciousness. Law and form are understood as immanent idea, and this leads directly to teleology. flatter is reduced to energy, and this is identified with will. All these positions are in so large a degree common property in the philosophical world that detailed analysis of the author's reasoning about them may here be omitted, especially as his position on some other points is so original, and possibly debatable, as to call for some- what extended comment. He shares with current theistic idealism the epistemological founda- tion upon which he builds. That reality is implicated in cognition as such; that all truth and reality get their concrete filling from consci- ousness as self-experience, and that, consequently, the world-energy must be interpreted as will, and the laws of nature as the thoughts of a cosmic mind-this seems to premise theistic idealism pure and simple. But the admission of three other premises turns the argument out of this direct channel. The first is a metaphysical outcome of Professor Ladd's</page><page sequence="3">No. 6.] REVIEWS OF BOOKS. 629 well-known leaning toward a voluntaristic psychology. "I know that I am, because, as the basis of all discriminations as to what I am, and as the core of all such self-knowledge, I immediately know my- self as will" (p. 69). The second is his inclusion of space and time among the ' essential' forms of knowledge (p. 67). They are " uni- versal and inescapable forms of knowledge " (p. i82). The third is the doctrine that every real thing is " an actualization . . . of all the categories " (p. 64). " Every particular being embodies [them] in a concrete way " (p. 86). To get the full force of the last two quota- tions it is necessary to notice that they occur in connection with an analysis of the conception of reality, and that no specific exception is anywhere made to the proposition that all the categories, time and space included, are concretely real in every real being. Were these premises to be taken strictly, the outcome would re- semble Schopenhauer's doctrine of the world as will. Of this ten- dency, too, the author is well aware, as his references to the apostle of the will clearly show. No one, moreover, knows better than he what a fallacy is involved in going to consciousness for the clue to reality, and then, instead of taking consciousness in its concrete fulness, erect- ing one of its aspects, whether will or intellect, into an exclusive on- tological principle. That he intends to take the complete self as an index to reality is clear enough; but his success in this most difficult and desirable undertaking is not so unequivocal. As between the ontology that rests upon intellectualism and that which rests upon voluntarism, he leans strongly towards the latter. The point of Professor Ladd's departure from idealism can best be il- lustrated from his treatment of substance. He proceeds at once to what the idealist, as well as himself, regards as the core of the matter, the na- ture of the logical judgment. But, whereas the idealist dwells upon the logical character of the judgment, he places the whole stress upon a single psychological characteristic, namely, its quality as " a deed of will " (p. I24). The judgment is a self-activity which is made con- scious by being inhibited; this inhibition is not my doing; hence, I know substantial being other than myself. By " a necessary and nat- ural analogy," I attribute to this not-self the same essential being which I myself have (p. I 23 if. ). Certainly the author does not need to be told that the primary fact of knowledge is more than 'a consciousness of doing'; why, then, were not these other factors given equal influence in determining the view point ? Again, the content of the judgment cannot be univer- sally described, much less defined, as inhibition of my activity. And,</page><page sequence="4">630 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. VIII. finally, does the determination of the analogy present in the judg- ment as ' necessary and natural' do anything more than conceal the logical problems that groan for deliverance? On the whole, it still appears that the importance of the logical judgment for metaphysics lies not more in its psychological qualities than in the ontological significance of the unity of objective truth that is implicated in every mental assertion. The consequences of adopting time and space as universal forms of reality are accepted with a fair degree of consistency. Both time and space have transcendental reality (p. I 8 2). But, as we are bound to be anthropomorphic, their reality means their existence as mental 'media' (p. I8I), or some sort of constitutional principles. It is true that the argument sometimes proceeds as if Kant had never writ- ten the Transcendental /Esthetic; yet the insistent reiteration of the trans-subjective reality of these categories is doubtless intended to show, simply, that they are principles of thought as well as of per- ception, and that they are constitutional to the infinite mind as well as to the finite. God's being is an " unending time-series" (p. 207),and the Absolute Self has memory (p. 2Io). The existence of the Absolute Mind in space also is a direct inference from the doc- trine that space is one essential principle of individuation. " All that is other in man's known world is external to each man's self" (p. 228, cf. p. 225). Now, the Absolute Mind is a " Being not our- selves " (p. 252). We must, therefore, regard this mind as in space, and specifically as in space apart from our own. How, then, it can be conceived of as unitary, or inclusive of us, is not clear. Some of the grounds of this unusual doctrine are these: (I) that time and space are categories; (2) in order that the ' now ' of different observers may be the same, time must be more than a sub- jective affair (p. i89) ; (3) the physical sciences assume and verify tri-dimensional space (p. 248); (4) otherwise knowledge is of mere appearances (p. I82 f.), and there is no possibility of society, of history, or of the exact measurement of time (p. I90). Of course eth- ical and religious interests are involved (p. 209). The third and fourth of these grounds bring back a form of misunderstanding rather than argument that one might have hoped not to meet with again, at least among philosophers by profession. The second requires us, in strictness, to assume some ground that shall provide for the communicability of our judgments regarding events. The first pro- pounds a questionable principle. In the Plzilosoplzy of Inoozledge, p. 359, the author distinctly declares that what he affirms is the va-</page><page sequence="5">No. 6.] REVIEW1,S OF BOOKS. 631 lidity for reality of the "Imost fundam;zental of the so-called categories.'" From this it would appear that some of the "so-called categories" have only a limited sphere of application, and space and time would naturally be expected to fulfil this description. In short, Professor Ladd nowhere shows reason for giving the same rank to the categories of per- ception and to those of thought. It may be said, also, in dismissing this topic, that too much deference is shown to the understanding of the uninstructed. " Everybody knows perfectly well what it is for the self to be in time, and equally well for the entire world of being to be in time" (p. 201). So, also, with space (p. 234). Hence, the book absolves itself from all responsibility for analyzing and construing the conllent of the two concepts. What, now, is the resulting view of the world as a whole? The world consists of real beings of various grades, each grade being dis- tinguished by the amount of essential self hood possessed by its members (p. 401). Things are imperfect and inferior selves (p. 403), but man reaches a high degree of relative independence (p. 5 I4). Neither things nor men are mere manifestations of the Absolute Mind (p. 5 IO), for all have self-activity, relative independence (p. 518), and their own ideas of what they want to be and to do (p. 519). Yet all exist together as a unitary system which is related to the Absolute Mind as object to sub- ject, though finite things are not mere objects to this mind as subject (p. 505). All activities of finite things are, in fact, double ; they are at once acts of the finite being and acts of the Absolute Being which is their ground (p. 513). The question of human freedom is handed over to ethics and the philosophy of religion. In the doctrine that all reality is comprehended in an infinite self co- existing with and in finite selves, the author comes close once more to some of the idealisms that vex his soul. But by what a roundabout way has he reached this conclusion ! Idealism, analyzing the act of judging, discovers at once the implication of a unitary sphere of ab- solute truth, and hence of an absolute mind somehow coexisting with a lesser dependent mind. But this new realism, starting at the same point, fixes attention upon the will-aspect of judging, makes the judg- ment a case of interaction with its object, and thus (whether legiti- mately or not) finds itself and a multitude of particular things jostling together in space and time. To idealism nothing is more certain than the existence of an absolute mind, but to this new realism such a being is conjectured rather than known, while our first-hand, verifiable knowledge is of particular existences (pp. I33, 4I7). Finally, when the system undertakes to understand what the world really is, it is</page><page sequence="6">632 7JHE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. VIII. obliged to interpret everything, space and time included, back into terms of mind-with what uncertain footsteps we have seen. The last, and least certain, step remains to be pointed out. It is true that our author wishes to understand nature in terms of spirit (Ch. XVII), but it is also true that he makes the self, composed of spirit and body (p. 4II), the sole clue to reality. The spirit and the body are in interaction, and the Absolute Mind " furnishes the vital cement, so to speak " (p. 41 I) that binds them together. Doubtless, then, the supreme self is also a soul joined to a body, but if so we lose ourselves, not in dualism merely, but in unlimited reduplication of principles. The escape from this is, of course, by stricter fidelity to the program of a spiritual interpretation of existence. Following the suggestion of the sub-title, we must base our metaphysics upon the cognitive, or rational, element in experience; or, to adopt a phrase from the dedication, we must have " the faith of reason."
