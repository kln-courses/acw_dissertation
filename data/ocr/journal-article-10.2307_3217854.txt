<plain_text><page sequence="1">Reviews of Books Scripture and Exegesis in Early Imami Shiism. By MEIR M. BAR-ASHER. Leiden: BRILL; Jerusalem: THE MAGNES PRESS, THE HEBREW UNIVERSITY, 1999. Pp. xv + 274. $94. This book, originally a Ph.D. dissertation submitted to the Hebrew University in 1991, is a study of four early ShiCi Quran commentaries, those of Furat b. Furat al-Kufi (fl. early fourth/tenth century), 'Ali b. Ibrahim al-Qummi (fl. 307/919), Muhammad b. Mascud al-'Ayyashi (fl. early fourth/tenth century), and Muhammad b. Ja'far al-NuCmani Ibn Abi Zaynab (d. 360/971). The significance of these tafsirs, as expounded by Meir Bar-Asher, is that they date from the period between the Minor and Major Occultations of the twelfth Imam, which is also the period immediately prior to the establishment of a Shii'-friendly Buwayhid dispensation in 334/945. Bar-Asher's interrogation of these texts is primar- ily directed at extracting what it is that they tell us about the early development of ShiCi thought and doctrine during a period when the Imami community was attempting to define itself both in the recent wake of the disappearance of the pivotal figure of the divine guide, and in an often hostile political and intellectual environment. After a lengthy bio-bibliographical survey in chapter one, Bar-Asher goes on in chapter two to identify four common characteristics that "qualify the pre-Buwayhid Imami-Shl'i exegesis as a unique school" (p. 73) and that distinguish the tafsirs under study from the subsequent definitive Imami tafsirs of Abu Ja'far al-Tusi and al-Fadl al-Tabrisi. First, the pre-Buwayhid tafsirs record the reported exegetical opinions of the Imams, generally Ja'far al-Sadiq (d. 148/765) and Muhammad al- Baqir (d. ca. 114/732), unlike al-Tusi (d. 460/1067) and al-Tabrisi (d. 548/1153) whose exegesis is more "independent"; also, "later Imami exegesis aims at investigating the veracity or falsehood of traditions-a characteristic that ... was absent from the pre-Buwayhid exegesis" (p. 76). Second, the pre-Buwayhid exegetes were concerned only with those verses in the Quran that were relevant to "their exegetical agenda, which is to find scriptural authority for various ShiCi beliefs" (p. 80). Third, the earlier tafsirs are characterized by "an extreme anti-Sunni tendency and a hostile attitude to the Companions of the Prophet"-this attitude is moderated in commentaries of the Buwayhid period when "it may well be that the improved standing of the Imamiyya ... required that it abandon its iso- lationist attitudes towards its overwhelmingly Sunni surroundings and conceal its opposition to them, while strategically emphasizing their common heritage" (p. 86). Bar-Asher's thorough reading of the sources has unearthed a particularly interesting illustrative report that appears in an early lithograph edition of al-Qummi explaining Quran 66:2, in which Abu Bakr and 'Umar are presented as conspir- ing to assassinate the Prophet. In an instructive section entitled "censorship of anti-Sunni material" (p. 39), Bar-Asher points out how the wording of this report was adjusted by the modern editor of al- Qummi's tafsir to remove any reference to the idea of an assassination plot. The last defining char- acteristic of this "pre-Buwayhid school" is a "scant interest in theology and in certain issues bearing on the institution of the Imama" (p. 73), to the exposition of which Bar-Asher devotes the fourth and longest chapter of the book. In chapter three, Bar-Asher illustrates the exegetical methods by which these mufassirun effect their Shici interpretations of the Quranic text. These include the invocation of Shi'i-oriented variant read- ings, such as kuntum khayra a'immatin ukhrijat li 1-nas instead of khayra ummatin, and the addition of words to the Quranic text, often set phrases such as ft 'All or al Muhammad. The main exegetical method is the employment of allegorical and typological interpretation in which Quranic phrases are taken to have encoded meanings: thus al-rasikhuna ft al-'ilm means "the Imams," while al-mufsidin fl al-ard and al-maghdub 'alay-him are Abu Bakr, 'Umar and 'Uthman. Bar-Asher also indicates the secret vocabulary that the exegetes used: for example, Abu Bakr is sometimes referred to by them as habtar ("fox"), 'Umar as zurayq ("shiny blue-eyed") or even shaytan, 'Uthman as na'thal ("long- beard," "fool"), the Banu 'Abbas as Banu Siba' (siba' being the word produced by reversing the con- sonants that make up the word CAbbas). Chapter four looks at the treatment in these tafsirs of the Shici idea of imama. The concepts examined here are the pre-existence of the Imama and the Imams, the duties owed to the Imam, such as ma'rifah (knowing the Imam), mawadda or hubb (loving the Imam), and walaya (loyalty to the Imam). Especially informative are Bar-Asher's expositions of the respec- tive issues of the differences between Imams and Prophets (such as in the nature of their knowledge and reception of Revelation), and of the shafa'a (intercession) and 'isma ("immunity from sin and 183</page><page sequence="2">Journal of the American Oriental Society 123.1 (2003) error") of Imams and Prophets. On the latter subject, he both synthesizes the existing knowledge and adds new information in an especially clear and accessible manner. Chapter five examines the overt hostility expressed in these works towards the Umayyad dynasty, and the more covert hostility towards the 'Abbasids. The sixth and final chapter, an earlier version of which appeared in Arabica in 1990, examines two unusual early exegetical reports. It seems to me, however, that Bar-Asher has misunderstood the import of one of these, "the traditions of the isrd'." The report, given in the Tafsir of al-Qummi in re- lation to Quran 10:94, states that during the course of Muhammad's Night Journey: God revealed to him that which He revealed to him about CAli's honour and importance with God [awhd Allah la-hufi 'All ma awha min sharafi-hi was 'izami-hi 'ind Allah-I have amended Bar-Asher's slightly awkward and unnecessarily anthropomorphic translation, "God revealed to him what he did regarding 'Ali's honour and importance in His eyes"]. Something interposed itself in the mind of the Messenger of God on account of the magnitude of what God had re- vealed to him about 'Ali, ['arada fi nafs rasul Allah min 'izam ma uhiya 'ilay-hi fi 'Ali; cf. Bar- Asher: "A doubt entered the heart of the Messenger of God because the greatness of that which was revealed to him concerning 'Ali was so powerful" (p. 226)], so God sent down to him "If you are in doubt regarding what we have sent down to you, ask those who recite the book be- fore you [=Quran 10:94]," meaning the Prophets, for We have sent down upon them in their books what we sent down in regard to him [i.e., CAli] in your book... [Ja'far] al-Sadiq said: "By God! He did not doubt, and he did not ask!" Bar-Asher takes this report as problematically portraying "Muhammad's envy of 'Alh," and devotes a section to this difficulty. I detect no indication of envy. Simply what is happening here is that Muham- mad, who is, after all, the Messenger of God, is having some uncertainty about the reported greatness of CAli, who is, after all, not the Messenger of God. However, God himself makes it emphatically clear that 'Ali's greatness (however that greatness might be specifically constituted) is a divinely de- creed and eternally witnessed fact. Muhammad's doubts about 'Ali's unusual stature were very likely shared by a good many individuals coming into contact with early Shi' doctrines: this story told them not to worry about encountering such doubts-after all, even the Prophet had them-but, like the Prophet, to accept this simply as one of the divine truths; don't doubt and don't ask! This is, perhaps, an example of how such reports are used by these tafsirs for purposes of preaching, which, in turn, brings in the issue of the audiences for whom these commentaries were composed. The question of audience-which is also related to the question of authorial motivation-is not something that Bar- Asher really considers. Indeed, most criticisms that might be made of this book are, perhaps, somewhat churlish as they have less to do with shortcomings in what Bar-Asher actually does, and more to do with things that he does not do but might profitably have done in the context of the present study. For instance, having made the case that the four tafsirs under study are representative of a single loosely defined "school," Bar-Asher then proceeds to use them throughout the book in a somewhat undifferentiated manner with the result that one does not really get a sense of these commentaries as distinct works produced by individual authors. In this regard, Bar-Asher's treatment of his sources emerges as, perhaps, slightly less nuanced than that of Andrew J. Newman's contemporaneous treatment of early Imami Hadith collections compiled in Qum and Baghdad as documenting inter-regional debate within the Shi' com- munity. 1 Also, while Bar-Asher uses the early Shl'i Hadith collections in his study, his treatment does not really consider the nature of the discursive relationship between these Hadith texts and the early Quran commentaries. The assumption seems to be, here, that since all these texts are a part of the same larger Shi'i enterprise, no further nuancing is necessary: however, since a unifying characteris- tic of the pre-Buwayhid tafsirs is their use of Hadith, it may have been instructive to investigate broadly the degree of overlap between their Hadith content and those of the Hadith collections.

Retrospectively, this reviewer was also, perhaps unreasonably, hoping to see some consideration of the issue of those even earlier Quran commentaries whose authors were characterized by early Sunni critics as being Shi'ites, but that do not seem to have been adopted in the Shili corpus (for example, the al-'Awfi family tafsir that is ex- tensively cited by al-Tabari)-although, it should be noted that Bar-Asher does attempt to sift out an earlier Jarudi substrata from the Tafsir of al-Qummi. Finally, I suspect that the author has done him- self a clear disservice by failing to end with a chapter for his conclusions. A concluding chapter, by pulling together the interesting arguments and valuable observations scattered through the book, would likely have helped dispel the doubtless unfair impression sometimes received by the reader-an impres- sion which is probably difficult for an author to avoid in a book that relies so much on detailed illus- trative examples-of an occasional preponderance of description over analysis. None of these criticisms should, however, detract in the slightest from the fact that this is a thor- oughly researched, well organized, and clearly written study that provides a great deal of valuable new information and informed analysis on an important and hitherto neglected subject. SHAHAB AHMED HARVARD UNIVERSITY Mullahs on the Mainframe: Islam and Modernity among the Daudi Bohras. By JONAH BLANK. Chi- cago: UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PRESS, 2001. Pp. viii + 408. It has taken more than eighty years for a new and original study on the Bohras to appear. Mian Bhai Mulla Abdul-Husain's Gulzare Daudi for the Bohras of India (Burhanpur, 1920) was the main source of information for practically all studies written on the Indian Tayyibl Isma'ili Bohras in the twentieth century. Hollister, Engineer, and Daftary are only a few of the scholars who relied primarily on the Gulzare for their accounts of the Isma'ili community. However, Abdul-Husain's involvement in the opposition movement to the fifty-first ddai mutlaq Syedna Taher Saifuddin (d. 1965) (I will follow the author's example and use the common Bohra vocalization for personal names) is enough to make us wary of an account that has enjoyed a quasi-authoritative status. This alone should make us welcome Jonah Blank's Mullahs on the Mainframe to fill a longstanding gap in the field of Ismacili studies. The book, which is a revised version of a doctoral dissertation in anthropology submitted at Harvard Uni- versity in 1998, includes much to be praised. It is based on extensive field research conducted among the Daudi Bohras in India and Pakistan, a first for a scholar from outside the community. Through studying Bohra rituals, domestic life, education, and the role of the politico-religious ruling elite, Blank portrays an Islamic community that embraces modern technologies in order to strengthen its centralized unity and traditional values. The book is divided into two main parts. The first, the eth- nography, starts with "the historical background." Blank begins with the succession to the Prophet, covering the history of the da'wa until the establishment of the Fatimid state in North Africa and later in Egypt. The major event in Tayyibi/Bohra history was the assassination of the Fatimid imam al- Amir in 524/1130 and the resulting concealment of his infant son al-Tayyib, according to the Tayyibi tradition. The Yemeni Isma'ilis under the Sulayhid queen Arwa bint Ahmad followed the concealed imam and seceded from Fatimid Cairo. They soon formed themselves into an independent da'wa headed by a dd'l mutlaq. The Tayyibi da'wa ended up moving to India in the tenth/sixteenth century when its existence was threatened by the politico-religious tensions with the dominating Zaydi imams. The local Indian Tayyibi community, known as the Bohras, was mainly concentrated in Gujarat. Soon after, a major schism divided the Tayyibi/Bohra community into Daudis (Dawuidis) in India and Sulaymanis in Yemen. Blank's coverage of the remaining history of the Daudi Bohras is mainly an 185</page></plain_text>
