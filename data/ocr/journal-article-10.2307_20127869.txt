Rachels, J. Glover, J. Bennett, et al. The distinction (AOD) is shown not to be as vague as these writers contend. Its moral relevance to assessments of culpability, which the author calls The Greater Culpability Principle (GCP) is then defended by means of a distinction between the internal features of actions and the external factors that affect culpability. It is argued that the denial of the moral relevance of AOD is due to a conflation between internal features and external factors. The consequences of re jecting AOD and GCP are then shown to be far more serious than their critics seem to realize. AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY Vol. 19, No. 4, October 1982 Mill's Substantive Principles of Justice: A Comparison With Nozik, FRED R. BERGER Recent work on John Stuart Mill's moral theory has called attention to the important role of his theory of justice. Little has been done, how ever, with the substantive principles of justice he employed in writing on economic and political subjects. This paper attempts to pick out such principles from his discussions of desert and punishment, property rights, the principles of taxation, rights of bequeathal and inheritance, and so on. Principles of desert and equality are discussed, along with a basic principle of economic reward that requires that rewards be proportioned to effort. Mill's application of these principles to the taxation of wages is discussed, and a comparison is made with the contrary views on that * Abstracts of articles from leading philosophical journals are published as a regular feature of The Review.

Though it is not claimed that Mill's argument refutes Nozick, Mill's view seems at least as plausible. Unsolvable Problems and Philosophical Progress, WILLIAM J. RAP APORT Philosophy has been characterized (e.g., by Benson Mates) as a field whose problems are unsolvable. This has often been taken to mean that there can be no progress in philosophy as there is in mathematics or science. The nature of problems and solutions is considered, and it is argued that solutions are always parts of theories, hence that acceptance of a solution requires commitment to a theory (as suggested by William Perry's scheme of cognitive development). Progress can be had in phi losophy in the same way as in mathematics and science by knowing what commitments are needed for solutions. Similar views of Rescher and Casta?eda are discussed. (Winning entry in the 1982 American Philo sophical Quarterly Prize Essay Competition.) Kant's Pragmatic Horizon, DAVID A. LONG Kant's thinking is supposed by Russell and others to operate within rigid "Prussian" limits. Considerations of the connections between the Critique of Pure Reason and the later works Anthropology and Logic show this supposition to be false. Critique was not meant as a system but as a voyage of reason?one directed towards the pragmatic horizon in which a later generation of American philosophers made its conceptual home. Kantian philosophy was a crucial point of departure for the development of pragmatism by Peirce, James, and Dewey who were freer to voice cer tain common concerns than European contemporaries, as instanced by the long-delayed publication of Vaihinger's Philosophy of "As-If. " Con versely, the transatlantic horizon affords a coign of vantage on the critical philosophy, enabling it to be appreciated as an integral whole. Examples are here adduced from epistemology, morals, and metaphysics. Can Philosophical Beliefs Be Rationally Justified?, GARY GUTTING The author approaches the title question by reflecting on four par adigm examples of contemporary analytic philosophical practice: Kripke's discussion of proper names as rigid designators; Plantinga's of the on tological argument; Goodman's of induction; and Rawls's of justice. For each case the author tries to determine the methods of rational persuasion used and the extent to which they are effective. These case-studies sug gest that there is little basis for thinking that philosophers are able to establish their claims by rational argumentation of any sort. The author concludes with some reflections of what, short of rational justification of their theses, we can expect philosophical discussions to achieve.</page><page sequence="3">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 483 Morality Not a System of Imperatives, MICHAEL SLOTE Morality is often said to be essentially and universally practical; and even those who think of morality as containing nothing but hypothetical imperatives regard the central part of morality that concerns right and wrong action as comprised entirely of principles, rules, and precepts for the guidance of action. But the author attempts to show that various prin ciples concerning family obligations and self-defense are not properly conceived as action-guiding. Someone acting permissibly in the heat of self-defense, for example, cannot reasonably be expected to be following a rule against killing that allows an exception for the kind of case he is in, and so there are times when our standards for critical moral appraisal are not to be thought of as mirrored in the deliberations or thoughts of moral agents. In certain central and crucial respects, morality is eval uative without being practical. Identifying Subjects, MARY WISEMAN Understanding stories in which there are characters requires readers' imaginative identification with the characters because of the connection between interpretations of characters and conceptions of the self: char acters are all and only what people may imagine themselves to be, and people may conceive of their identity in all and only the ways in which they individuate characters. Something is a character iff it is a set of descriptions given by a text, and a character is more than the words in the text; it is whatever is both consistent with the words and such that the reader can know what it is like to be it by performing an experiment in imagination. One character is the same as another iff all of its de scriptions are the same. Characters are plural. They may be elaborated in ways that do or do not cohere with the assumptions of the reader's culture. Elaborations that do cohere with the culture and its tradition are invited by what Roland Barthes calls texts of pleasure, those that do not, by what he calls texts of bliss (jouissance). The experience of liter ature occasioned by the way of reading that unsettles the tradition teases us from our fixed points of view and begins to shake the conviction that we are one thing. People resemble characters in this: where their objec tive moment is the words on the pages of the text, ours is the stuff of which we are made and on which our histories are inscribed. For the rest?the subjective moment?we are as various as they. Deviant Causal Chains, DOROTHY MITCHELL This paper argues that the problem of deviant causal chains arises only if one assumes the transitivity of causation. It then argues that in stating the problem, philosophers have used a conception of causation in which causation is not transitive. They have picked out one obvious factor from a set of sufficient conditions and treated that as the cause (as we do when we say that lightning was the cause of the fire). If we regard</page><page sequence="4">484 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS such things as causes, causation is not transitive. If we regard the entire set of sufficient conditions for an occurrence as its cause, causation might be transitive, but one will be unable to state the problem of deviant causal chains. Finally, it is concluded that there is no objection to defining action in causal terms. Are There Nonexistent Objects?, TERENCE PARSONS Is Democracy Possible?, ELIZABETH RAPAPORT AUSTRALASIAN JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Vol. 60, No. 3, September 1982 Utilitarianism and Large-Scale Cooperation, ARTHUR KUFLIK The author argues that to enjoy stable and efficient cooperation on a large scale, utilitarians in a predominantly utilitarian society need to regulate exemption from the cooperative burden by public rules more specific and restrictive than the aci-utilitarian maxim, "do not cooperate when sufficiently many others do." To deepen the case for this "practice rule" approach, he considers J. J. C. Smart's suggestion that the game theoretic device of "randomized choice" provides the basis for an act utilitarian solution. First the author shows why randomization is usually an inefficient tool for remedying the inefficiency that typically afflicts large-scale cooperation. He then argues that even when randomization is the best strategy, it is a practice-rule, not an act-utilitarian, solution. For in taking an act-utilitarian attitude toward the randomization pro cedure, we would only be exchanging our original coordination problem for another, equally vexing one. The author concludes by drawing some general implications for utilitarian theory. The Psychological Turn, HILARY KORNBLITH Arguments for psychologizing epistemology are by now quite famil iar. While many of the proponents of these arguments suggest that they result in a radically new approach to epistemology, others carry on with business as usual. The extent to which the psychologization of episte mology must change the way in which epistemology is done has yet to be made clear. In this paper, one reason for thinking that the psychologi zation of epistemology need have very little effect on epistemological theo rizing is carefully examined and found lacking.</page><page sequence="5">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 485 Some Recollections of Ryle and Remarks on his Notion of Negative Action, MAX DEUTSCHER The first part of the article contains recollections of Ryle; these are connected with his interests in, and repulsions from, various sorts of phi losophy. He is compared and contrasted with Merleau-Ponty and with Sartre, both in style and preoccupation. The second part is a detailed analysis of his "Negative 'Actions'," in which is displayed Ryle's great ability to make phenomena clear by apt choice of clusters of examples. Also, Ryle is criticized for his tendency to minimize his own discoveries by his accounts of them. It is argued that negative "actions" really are actions, and that we cannot understand them, or the appeal of Ryle's examples, without reference to our "inner life," in the ordinary sense of that phrase. The Nature of Natural Laws, CHRIS SWOYER Multisets and Relevant Implication II, ROBERT K. MEYER and MICHAEL A. MCROBBIE INTERNATIONAL PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY Vol. 22, No. 1, March 1982 Four Problems in Aesthetics, RICHARD SHUSTERMAN This paper analyzes four central problems concerning the work of art: its identity, ontological status, interpretation, and evaluation. The author's analysis shows how all of these issues are conceptually inter related and interdependent, and how positions on one entail decisions with respect to the others. Tracing the relations between these four issues and examining some of the different positions on each of them, we see the emergence of different and often incommensurable critical frame works or models, which differently conceive the identity and mode of existence of the work and consequently differently interpret and evaluate it. This can explain the frequent unresolvable controversy over variant interpretations and evaluations. INTERNATIONAL PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY Vol. 22, No. 2, June 1982 Perennial Philosophy, Primordial Tradition, HUSTON SMITH This essay outlines an outlook?roughly the Great Chain of Being? which has not only appeared in all known civilizations and cultures but</page><page sequence="6">486 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS has presided over them, the sole important exception being our modern West. Beginning by distinguishing between transcendent and immanent domains, it proceeds to divide the former into its knowable and unknow able (kataphatic and apophatic) regions, and the latter into parts that are visible (material) and invisible (immaterial). The anthropological cor relate of this world view is that man is a microcosm; he intersects all four levels of reality. The object of life is to identify with the higher levels as they appear within us; the object of ethics is to remake the self into a subject that can see things as they truly are. Cassirer's Philosophy of Culture, DONALD PHILLIP VERENE This paper examines Cassirer's sense of symbol and how it is the basis of his conception of culture. It claims that Cassirer's Geist-centered philosophy fails to respond to the problem of life or Leben. Cassirer's inability to treat Leben successfully lies in his inability to move from his theory of the symbol based on the functional concept to a non-conceptual understanding of the image and the power of images. Cassirer created a most important theory of mythical thought and the aesthetic symbol but he failed to grasp the sense of the symbol that is uniquely tied to the imagination as a power separate from the power of conceptual under standing. JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Vol. 79, No. 4, April 1982 Do the Guilty Deserve Punishment? RICHARD W. BURGH After arguing that a morally tolerable account of legal punishment must include the idea that the culpable offender deserves to be punished, the author asks whether the idea of penal desert can be consistently de fended by an appeal to principles of justice. After showing that the strongest arguments in support of penal desert fail, the author concludes that we are left with a serious moral quandary. If punishment involves our doing to people what we ordinarily think it wrong to do, then if it cannot be defended by an appeal to principles of justice, we have a com pelling reason to cease punishing offenders and hence to search for another paradigm upon which to base the criminal law. JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Vol. 79, No. 6, June 1982 Weirich on Conditional and Expected Utility, WAYNE A. DAVIS In "Conditional Utility and its Place in Decision Theory" (The Journal of Philosophy, 77 [1980]: 702-715), Paul Weirich tries to show that con</page><page sequence="7">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 487 ditional utilities are not the utilities of conditionals, that common for mulations of the expected utility law are inadequate, and that better for mulations of the law use conditional utilities in uncommon ways. The author argues that all three attempts fail. JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Vol. 79, No. 7, July 1982 Why Agents Must Claim Rights: A Reply, ALAN GEWIRTH In Reason and Morality the author argued for the thesis that every agent logically must hold or accept that he has rights to freedom and well-being as the necessary conditions of his action. This argument was part of a more extensive argument to establish that all persons equally have certain moral rights. In the present paper, after briefly summarizing the bare essentials of his argument for the first thesis, the author shows that the objections raised by Edward Regis Jr., in "Gewirth on Rights" (Journal of Philosophy, [December 1981]: 786-794), overlook at least four salient points. The author also shows that Regis's criticisms of my di alectically necessary method are based on a confusion between relational and nonrelational truths, and the author gives reasons for holding that successful arguments for rights can only be dialectical, not assertoric. Leaving the World Alone, JONATHAN LEAR The Inverted Spectrum, SYDNEY SHOEMAKER JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Vol. 79, No. 8, August 1982 Moral Saints, SUSAN WOLF The ideal of a person who is as morally good as can be is not un equivocally attractive. Yet in the background of most discussions of moral philosophy there lurks an assumption that one ought always to strive to be as morally good as possible. Common sense, utilitarianism, and Kant ian moral theory yield different conceptions of what a perfectly moral person would be like, but, it is argued, none of these conceptions provide models to which it would be particularly rational or desirable for a human being to aspire. Moreover, it is suggested that the problem lies not in the particular content of the conceptions of morality considered, but rather in the metamoral assumption that it is always better to be morally</page><page sequence="8">488 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS better. This has implications both for the content of any acceptable moral theory and for the set of problems and projects that moral philosophy more generally ought to comprehend. On Doing Good: The Right and Wrong Way, JAMES MONTMARQUET This paper concerns the moral injunctions (a) not to kill, (b) to save lives and (c) to do good. The author shows, that (a) differs from (b) exactly in its capacity to override (c)?i.e., that questions of saving lives differ from questions of taking lives in that the former, but not the latter, are properly to be decided on a consequentialist basis. He goes on to argue that the additional strength of the prohibition against killing flows from a fundamental axiom of justice: it is wrong to inflict substantially more harm on a person, even for the sake of bringing about the most possible good, than one finds that person already threatened with. This rule is shown to yield an intuitively more successful treatment of "trolley cases" than its rivals (due to Foot, Thomson, Tooley, and Russell). THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Vol. 79, No. 9, September 1982 Naive Semantics and the Liar Paradox, HANS G. HERZBERGER JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Vol. 79, No. 10, October 1982 Realism and Relativism, HARTRY FIELD The author discusses the views on metaphysical realism and on rela tivism that Hilary Putnam puts forth in Reason, Truth and History. After removing various excesses in the metaphysical realist position as Putnam characterizes it, the author defends the remaining metaphysical realist doctrine, and criticizes Putnam's proposed alternative to it ("internal re alism"). He then turns to the issue of relativism about values, and in particular to Putnam's claim that relativism about cognitive values (jus tification etc.) is incoherent. The author argues that on the contrary such epistemological relativism is a coherent and plausible doctrine and is quite compatible with metaphysical realism.</page><page sequence="9">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 489 Converse Intentional Properties, RODERICK CHISHOLM The problem of intentionality, or objective reference, may be illus trated by asking: "How does one thing cause another to have such a prop erty as that of being thought to be a thief V Among the answers that have been suggested are these: "By asserting in inner speech a sentence in which the other thing is described as being a thief"; "By using an inner system of representation in which the other thing is represented as being a thief"; and "By accepting a proposition p of this sort: there is a property Q which is such that the other thing has Q, and p is true if and only if there is just one thing having Q and that thing is a thief." It is argued that: (i) answers of the first two types are relatively empty and leave us with that "action at a distance" which gives rise to the original problem; (ii) the third type of answer lacks this defect; and (iii) so does an even simpler answer that construes belief in terms of the attribution of prop erties to oneself. The latter two answers presuppose what might be called "the primacy of the intentional." Metaphysical Realism and Moral Relativism: Reflections on Hilary Putnam's Reason, Truth, and History, GILBERT H ARM AN Putnam rejects "metaphysical realism," which takes "the world" to be a single complex thing, a connected causal or explanatory order into which all facts fit. He argues that such metaphysical realism is respon sible for views he finds implausible; in particular, it can lead to moral relativism when one tries to locate the place of value in the world of fact. I agree that metaphysical realism will lead a thoughtful philosopher to moral relativism, but find neither of these views implausible. In partic ular, Putnam's main argument against metaphysical realism seems fal lacious and his suggested alternative, to think of truth as the idea limit of rational inquiry, is clearly incorrect. An Ontology of Senses, J. N. FINDLAY This paper attempts to work out an Ontology of Senses, the latter being conceived of, in Fregean fashion, as objective entities which mediate the relation of our speech, of our expressions and sentences, to the world, but which can also be enjoyed and savoured subjectively, and which are so enjoyed and savoured in all our awareness of objects and persons around us, and of reactions to objects in ourselves. And such enjoyments or savourings can be intimately attached to our words and sentences, though this does not always happen when we talk intelligently and intelligibly. Senses can, however, be subjectively present without any attachment to images or sense-presentations and such unverbalized, unillustrated, but still enjoyed Senses constitute, in fact, the greater part of our normal experience of the world. The author goes further, however, and holds that Senses or general Meanings also inform the whole phenomenal world as given to us in perceptual acquaintance: we live among mountains, trees,</page><page sequence="10">490 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS houses, tables, chairs, cousins, parents, colleagues, pets etc. of varying degrees of familiarity. And we also live among absences, possibilities, dangers, impending and past happenings, numbers, consequences, and all the apparatus afterwards symbolized by Logic and Science. It is in fact only because Senses everywhere structure the phenomenal world that we can be taught the uses of the verbal combinations that enable us to char acterize and refer to them. The author considers in this regard that Wittgenstein was hopelessly wrong in confining Meaning or Sense to the Meanings present in the Use of linguistic expressions, failing to see that language-meanings necessarily arise out of, and are taught by way of prior phenomenological meanings. To understand the Use of someone's expressions is in fact to understand a Sense of second order: we must conceive of a Sense as informing someone's talk, and this Sense must be connected with the Sense which we experience when we hear his words. The author's treatment of Senses goes further, however, and adopts the Platonic-Hegelian view of Senses as in some sense active presences in the world, forms which limit the variety in the world and ensure its continuity, and so render it intelligible to ourselves, who are ourselves as intelligences limited in our resourceful variety. The author here ventures to think with Francis Bacon, Lord Verulam, of induction as the laying bare of basic Forms of restrictive patterns, through a careful experimental dialogue in which natural objects tell us what they deeply are, reveal their Kripkean structures to us. The author thinks further that just as Senses operate unconsciously in the world, so they often operate unconsciously in our own behaviour and experience. The following of rules does not necessarily involve any experiences of understanding them, as Wittgenstein has so often insisted. The author's paper ends with the query: are Senses, Eide, Begriffe, Significant Contents all that there basically is in the world, or in us, and are things and persons wholly parasitic upon them, and without any independent content? As against such an unattractive view, the au thor still finds himself believing in obscure Transcendentals or Things in-themselves which underlie Senses, and which are in some sense their dynamic "sources," and of which, in Kantian fashion, we are obliged to think, though we cannot know them. For this kind of Noumenalism the author cannot argue on the present occasion. Causal Decision Theory, BRIAN SKYRMS MIND Vol. 91, No. 364, October 1982 The Trouble with Level-Generation, H. McCANN It is argued that Goldman's condition for level-generation between fine-grained act tokens fails to exclude one of his own counterexamples, i.e., that in which an agent is held to extend his arm out a car window</page><page sequence="11">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 491 by signaling a turn. This failure is due to the fact that the conditions in question are concerned only with the matter of when we have coun terfactual assurance that a pair of actions will or will not occur together, assurance that can be gotten in many ways. Hence the conditions are not specific enough to pick out an ontological relationship of generation between actions, which level-generation is supposed to be. It is further argued that conventional and causal generation, which are held to be specific types of level-generation, are suspect as regards whether they constitute relations by which one act genuinely gives rise to another. Meaning, Use, and Privacy, E. CRAIG The main part of the paper consists in a detailed examination of arguments from the beginning of Michael Dummett's paper "The Philo sophical Basis of Intuitionistic Logic." Dummett claimed that a proper understanding of the slogan "meaning is use" leads to the conclusion that nothing "inner" or "private" can be essential to the meaning of any lin guistic item; and from this he moved to a generalised anti-realist doctrine. Unlike many who have tried to resist Dummett's argument, the author attacks the first stage, rather than accepting it and questioning only the inference to anti-realism. The paper, which also contains as a preliminary a discussion of an argument for the Verification Principle to be found in the work of Moritz Schlick, should be of interest to anyone concerned with verificationism, realism, privacy and the private language debate, and in general with the role of the theory of meaning in philosophy. The Euthyphro Dilemma, M. MACBEATH The so-called Euthyphro dilemma?"Either right actions are right because God commands their performance, or God commands the per formance of right actions because they are right"?does not constitute a true dilemma, even on the assumption that there is a God who commands the performance of right actions. For it could be that right actions are made right by, say, their maximising happiness, and that God commands their performance because they maximise happiness. It is argued that accepting a non-utilitarian version of this third option is preferable to accepting either limb of the "Euthyphro dilemma." A Note on Frege's Notion of "Wirklichkeit," A. REIN The note attempts to clear up some confusions which have arisen in the secondary literature regarding Frege's notion of Wirklichkeit and espe cially concerning the question of whether Frege viewed thoughts as wirk lich. It is argued that Frege, in his earlier writings, identified the wirklich with the spatio-temporal but, in his later writings, stressed the connection what is wirklich and what can be the subject and agent of change. Ac</page><page sequence="12">492 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS cording to this latter characterisation, thoughts can be said to be wirklich only in a most attenuated sense. This, it is argued, sums up Frege's view of the matter. In the final section, the notion of Wirklichkeit is further clarified by relating it to the three realms introduced by Frege in Der Gedanke. On the Alleged Necessity of True Identity Statements, E. LOWE In this paper the author investigates a possible loop-hole in the stan dard deviation (the so-called Barcan-Kripke proof) of the thesis that any true identity statement is necessarily true. Building on a suggestion made by Tom Baldwin, the author argues that, granted the assumption that the first-order principle of the substitutivity of identity is not a stronger prin ciple than the second-order principle of the indiscernibility of identicals, it may be objected that the standard derivation involves a fallacy of equiv ocation on the grounds that a wffof the form "D(a = a)" admits of two non-equivalent interpretations. Causation, Sensations and Knowledge, W. ROBINSON The core of this paper is an argument against the following propo sition: "For any subject S and any x, if S non-inferentially knows some thing about x, then x must cause some change in S which is causally contributory to S's believing what he does about x." The author also argues that there is no way in which we can be reasonable and impartial and yet deny that the causes of physical events are all physical. The main consequences that these arguments make available are that (a) the non physicality of sensations would not be a bar to their being known and (b) epiphenomenalism is the reasonable form for dualism to take. While this paper is not aimed at showing that any form of dualism is true, its main argument clarifies the nature of the issue between dualists and materialists and removes what might have been thought to be a decisive obstacle for dualism.

SCLESINGER</page><page sequence="13">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 493 THE MONIST Vol. 65, No. 2, April 1982 On C. S. Peirce 's Theory of the Proposition: Peirce as a Precursor of Game-theoretical Semantics, RISTO HILPINEN This paper discusses Peirce's analysis of propositions, especially his account of the logical subject of a proposition. According to Peirce, the subject of a proposition can be regarded as a determinate or an indeter minate indexical sign. Expressions of the latter type do not refer to any definite individual, but indicate how the speaker and the hearer must act in order to find an individual which the predicate of the proposition may be regarded as representing. It is shown that Peirce's analysis of the meaning of indeterminate subjects (for example, quantifier phrases) re sembles the modern game-theoretical analysis of quantifier phrases. THE MONIST Vol. 65, No. 4, October 1982 Metaphysical Necessity and Modal Logic, PHILIP L. QUINN This paper is a discussion of the relation between our concept of metaphysical, or broadly logical, necessity and several formal systems of propositional modal logic. The main question addressed is methodolog ical: How could we determine which system of modal logic most adequately expresses, when interpreted, our pre-theoretical concept of metaphysical necessity? Arguments by Alvin Plantinga intended to show that the system S5 best reflects our pre-theoretical beliefs about metaphysical necessity are subjected to criticism. The main conclusion reached is that metaphysical considerations are conceptually prior to formal considera tions in determining the philosophical adequacy of an interpreted modal logic. Analogies with similar problems in other areas of philosophical logic and of science are briefly outlined. Logic and Whitehead 's Criteria of Speculative Philosophy, BOWMAN L. CLARKE This paper attempts an explication of Whitehead's conception of the task of speculative philosophy by taking logicality, coherence, applicabil ity, and adequacy as criteria of the success of the scheme of general ideas. The scheme of ideas itself is explicated in terms of a formal language system, and then the above criteria are formally defined as properties of such a formal language system. Special attention is given to Whitehead's method of imaginative generalization and the role that metaphor plays in the extending of the scheme of ideas beyond its original locus of ap plicability to the metaphysical.</page><page sequence="14">494 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS Presuppositions for Logic, JOSEPH AGAASSI Positivists identify science and certainty and in the name of the utter rationality of science deny that it rests on speculative presuppositions. The Logical Positivists took a step further and tried to show such pre suppositions really no presuppositions at all but rather poorly worded sentences. Rules of sentence formation, however, rest on the presuppo sitions about the nature of language. This makes us unable to decide the question, what is the status of mathematics, which is these days partic ularly irksome since this question is now?since Abraham Robinson?one which mathematicians cannot ignore. Since mathematics is the paradigm of a logical discourse, logic must offer a system adequate enough to serve mathematics. This fact makes it hard to avoid making question-begging moves in both mathematics and logic. We must therefore view the ra tionality of logic as partial and hope it is stepwise improvable. The theory of rationality thus turns to be the major presupposition of logic, and one which has ample metaphysical background to it. The very supposition, basic to all logic, that language is divisible to form and content is under suspicion as mathematics belongs to neither perhaps. Aristotle's "Metaphysics" (Book Lambda) and the Logic of Events, NICHOLAS J. MOUTAFAKIS The paper provides a programatic investigation of Aristotle's text in Book Lambda of the Metaphysics, in light of recent developments in temporal logic. The thesis explored is that of seeing the "sense" of Ar istotle's position in view of how he regards his work as (1) an "inquiry." and (2) as a description of the first principles of things, expressed in terms of metaphors derived from the study of biology. It seems that a temporal logic, based upon an extensionalized pragmatics, becomes a useful tool for clarifying the meaning of Aristotle's metaphysical doctrine beyond what was possible hitherto. Universal Algebra and the Whiteheadian Cosmology, RICHARD M. MARTIN Whitehead's purpose, in his Universal Algebra of 1897, was "to present a thorough investigation of the various systems of Symbolic Reasoning allied to ordinary Algebra. . . . Such algebras have an intrinsic value for separate detailed study; also they are worthy of a comparative study, for the sake of the light thereby thrown on the general theory of symbolic meaning, and on algebraic symbolism in particular." It is perhaps as tonishing, from our modern point of view, that Whitehead did not include a discussion of the logic of relations, a subject "which it does not enter into the plan of this treatise to describe." The paper goes on to show how the system of Whitehead's later cosmology, as formulated in Whitehead's Categoreal Scheme (The Hague: Nijhoff, 1974), can be accommodated in the nonlogical part of the universal algebra. This material helps to unify</page><page sequence="15">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 495 Whitehead's thought and to explicate many themes in his very last book, Modes of Thought of 1938, in particular, that of its very last paragraph: "Philosophy is akin to poetry. ... In each case there is reference to form beyond the direct meanings of words. Poetry allies itself to metre, phi losophy to mathematic pattern." One should add that science too is akin to poetry, allying itself to exact observation and experimentation as well as to mathematic pattern. The three enterprises are much more closely allied methodologically than is usually recognized. The ideal of a uniiied, and uniiying, universal algebra, in which relations of all finite degrees have their proper place, was beyond anything envisaged in either Uni versal Algebra or the later Principia Mathematica. Many years have had to elapse for its realization, one approach to which is given in a forth coming paper (in Mind, Modality, Meaning, and Method, S.U.N.Y. Press, Albany). The theory there is unified in the sense of being formulable as a special deductive system; but it is also unifying in the sense that any number of special disciplines may be accomodated in it by a suitable choice of nonlogical primitive relational constants. The Relationship between Formal and Transcendental Metaphysical Logic According to Kant, AMIHUD GILEAD There is a widespread controversy among philosophers concerning the following questions: What is the relationship between formal logic and transcendental-metaphysical logic according to Kant? Is the former prior to the latter or is it the other way around? Can the one be deduced and derived from the other or based upon it? These philosophers accept the assumption that one of these logics should be prior to the other. In this article the author attempts to show that such a priority is impossible, since the two logics are but different uses or employments of the same understanding (Verstand). Each of the two logics is indispensable. For mal logic, therefore, cannot replace metaphysics at all, and philosophical problems as such cannot be solved by means of formal-logical tools alone; neither can they be clarified by them. On the other hand, formal logic cannot be replaced by transcendental logic, because the former supplies the necessary conditions of all kinds of thinking. Occam's Razor and Possible Worlds, PETER FORREST I argue against Realism about Possible Worlds by showing how it leads to a counter- intuitive skepticism about Occam's razor. The author's argument is based on the simple point that possible worlds with a given redundant entity would vastly outnumber those without that entity. So it would be highly improbable that the actual world would lack the re dundant entity in question. A Logical Theory of Objects, AUGUSTIN RISKA The explication of a logically founded theory (defined as a system of objects expressed in an appropriate language) requires the scrutiny of two</page><page sequence="16">496 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS basic operations: postulation and predication. In such theory T, objects are postulated from a background theory (system) T' where they are al ready characterized by packages of properties and relationships. If the theory T is logically well-articulated, its predicates will reveal these "hid den" packages, i.e., the analytic component of T (as to T'), as well as the "new" properties of the postulated objects and relations between them (the so-called synthetic component with regard to T). This is demon strated by analyzing the contributions of pure and applied first-order logics as well as the logic of part-whole relations (mereology). Objects and Logic, CHARLES PARSONS We discuss the concept of an object in general, in view of the question how there can be abstract objects such as those of mathematics. The usable general notion of object comes from logic: reference to objects is embodied in the use of singular terms, predicates, identity, and quanti fiers. Remarks by Kant and Frege call attention to two important con ditions, actuality and intuitability, that have been taken to be require ments for being an object, naturally but wrongly. Is whatever is an ob ject? Reflection on predication, as expressed in Frege's theory of concepts, suggests a negative answer, but this conclusion is not forced upon us. Is there, as Meinong thought, reference to nonexistent objects, not analyz able as de dicto intentionality? Such a view leads to a distinction of what there is from what exists and thus to an ambiguity of ontological com mitment, but only particular analyses such as that of fiction can decide its truth. Concerning the Logical Analysis of "Existence, " ALBERT MENNE THE NEW SCHOLASTICISM Vol. 56, No. 3, Summer 1982 Being and God, FREDERICK SONTAG Theology in recent times has failed to give us a new vision of God. Theology has tended to do everything else but fulfill this duty. Without that vision the people perish and there is famine in the land of religion. To say that theology should provide a vision of God for each age is not the same as to say that God may be seen either easily or face to face. But we do need new ways to bring God into human focus, since this clarity for human grasp seems to be artificially produced and is not a trait in herent in divinity. There are many faces of God. If we neglect our theological task, no one God will appear from among them, only a new dark night.</page><page sequence="17">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 497 Things and God: On Infinity and Transcendence in Husserl, MARY JEANNE LARRABEE Husserl's references to God are few and far between, but where they do occur, they raise a tantalizing problem?namely, how Husserl might discuss, within the limits of the phenomenological method, the experience of God and the Divine. This paper will examine the intertwining of two traditional divine properties described in Judaeo-Christian thought? transcendence and infinitude. Specifically, the author will trace how an awareness of the infinity involved in our experience of finite, transcendent, spatio-temporal things can point to the infinity of a transcendent God. In part, Husserl's phenomenology of world-experience echoes William Blake's statement: "If the doors of perception were cleansed, everything would appear to man as it is, infinite." However, Husserl moves beyond Blake, because for Husserl one infinity, that of the experienced thing, holds intimations of another and different kind of infinity, that of the Divine. The infinity of the experienced thing applies to its internal and external horizons as objects of possible consciousness. This limitlessness of possible experience derives from the perspectival nature of things and relates to the transcendence of things as we experience them. With cer tain essential modifications, these senses of infinity and transcendence also indicate the sense of divine infinity and transcendence, the latter arrived at by a form of intuition rather than by a rational method of proof. Pike on Divine Omniscience and Voluntary Action, ROBERT SEGAL Nelson Pike has argued that God's being essentially omniscient is incompatible with any human action being voluntary. In this essay the author critically discusses Pike's argument for his thesis, and tries to show that Pike fails to establish his thesis. Reaching Beyond Aristotle: A Note on Absolute or Ontological Difference, KENNETH ITZKOWITZ Kierkegaard and Heidegger each emphasize a kind of inconceivable difference. For Kierkegaard, this is the absolute difference between God and man; for Heidegger, it is the ontological difference between Being and beings. This essay attempts to think toward this inconceivable difference by comparing it to what Aristotle says in the Metaphysics about difference and especially greatest difference. For Aristotle, things can differ either in genus or in species, and what he calls "greatest difference" is between contraries of the same genus?i.e., things which differ essentially in spe cies. In contrast, essential differences with respect to genus are too rad ical to be measured, and hence cannot be regarded quantitatively, i.e., as either great or small. Even so, these latter differences are still conceivable as each of its terms can still be conceived. To continue this line of think</page><page sequence="18">498 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS ing, an inconceivable or absolute difference would involve an essential difference from reason itself (as well as what it can conceive)?and it is this kind of difference which, the author believes, both Kierkegaard and Heidegger attempt to manifest in the only way possible, i.e., in its incon ceivability. Descartes ' Children: The Skeptical Legacy of Cartesianism, LAWRENCE M. HINMAN Descartes' skeptical arguments make their appearance at the begin ning of the Meditations like recalcitrant children whom Descartes lets get out of hand. As a result, Descartes allows himself to be misled into thinking that the cogito is the only epistemologically firm ground available to him at the beginning of the Second Meditation. The author argues that, had Descartes confronted these arguments directly, he would have discovered their self-defeating character and thus would not have been left with the problem of bridging the gap between an isolated thinking subject and an "external" world. He would, furthermore, have thereby prevented these arguments from growing up, moving out, and trying to make it on their own as independent arguments in the philosophical com munity. Had Descartes gotten to know these, his skeptical children, bet ter and at an earlier age, we might all have benefited. The Third Way and the Possible Eternity of the World, CHARLES J. KELLY Critics have contended that Thomas Aquinas's opening to the possible eternity of the world invalidates and is otherwise inconsistent with his Third Way purporting to demonstrate the existance of God, contradicts his view that an actually infinite multitude cannot exist, and undermines his ascription of a timeless eternity to God. The paper centers on the presentation and evaluation of three arguments alleging the first inco herency. The thesis is that the methodology employed by Aquinas in demonstrative argument, his recognition of the eternity of the world as only a supposition and not as an assumption of inquiry, and his essentially predicative concept of time in its serving to preclude a quantifier shift fallacy and to obviate a recognition of a time when nothing existed as even a possible state of affairs combine to deflect the force of the objections as cogent internal criticisms. Realism, Conventionalism, and the History of Science, OLAF TOLLEFSEN It is argued in this essay that the appeal to the history of science to justify a conventionalist interpretation of science is not by itself adequate to make the case for that view. Since the history of science can be used in this way only after it is reconstructed according to some theory of the</page><page sequence="19">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 499 nature of science, no conventionalist reconstruction of the history of sci ence need be accepted by a realist, as he need not accept the conventions which guide the conventionalist's reconstruction of the history of science. Conventionalist history of science is too theory-laden to undercut a non conventionalist view of science. In fact, the realist's own reconstruction of the history of science is a significantly different enterprise: it is the reconstruction of the history of men coming to know the nature of certain kinds of phenomena. This argument does not establish realism or any other non-conventionalist view as a more adequate interpretation of sci ence than conventionalism, but shows that the issue must be settled on philosophical grounds. History of science by itself cannot settle episte mological issues. Natures and Conceptualization, JOSEPH OWENS With sensible things known in their natures through conceptualiza tion, and in their existence through judgment, what is to be said of the claim that "existence" and "whiteness" both fail to express what each is meant to express? Every original concept expresses the nature corre sponding to it. It has no other role. The concept of whiteness, in con sequence, expresses the nature from which it is taken, the nature it is meant to express. But conceptualization expresses the nature only. It was never meant to express the being that is signified by the copula in the phrase "is white." So, while "exists" and "white" are both first-level predicates, conceptualization succeeds in expressing whiteness, but fails to express existence even when referring to what is known through judg ment. Consequently the reason for denying the parallel between existence and whiteness is profound, in fact radical. Maimonides and Boethius of Dada on the Eternity of the World, RICHARD C. DALES THE NEW SCHOLASTICISM Vol. 56, No. 4, Autumn 1982 The Function of Formal Cause, DENIS SULLIVAN In the Thomistic interpretation of Aristotle formal causes are seen as somehow dynamic, as somehow productive of the characteristics and activity of substances. In recent interpretations, however, the formal cause is seen as a mere sortal device, that is, as a logical device for des ignating that set of characteristics we use to justify our identification of a thing as a particular kind of thing. Thus, from this point of view, formal causes are not dynamic; they do not do anything at all. In this paper the author argues that a dynamic version of formal causality is not</page><page sequence="20">500 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS even seriously considered by recent interpreters because they assume that it is inconsistent with Aristotle's use of formal causes as sortal devices and that it would involve, on Aristotle's part, an obvious slip into a crude form of anthropomorphism. The author then develops a model of formal causality, based on an analysis of creative behavior, which shows that these assumptions are unwarranted. Thus, the author concludes that the dynamic version of formal causality, apparently called for by the Aris totlean texts, is both intelligible and defensible. Where to Begin in Thinking about Obligation, MICHAEL B. EWBANK Certain recent approaches toward justifying moral obligation em phasize the necessity of philosophically demonstrating the existance of God prior to understanding obligation as being analyzed in terms of the "good" and "natural law" approaches. It is asserted that to not follow such a suggested procedure lends to an understanding of obligation that is inadequate. Indirect support for this contention is sought in the fact that Aquinas indicates God as being the ultimate source of law at the beginning of his treatise on law. However, the position of Aquinas con cerning approaches to understanding obligation seems to be more complex than a reading of this isolated text would indicate. According to important commentators on Aquinas' ethical theory, other approaches are in accord with the doctrine presented by Aquinas. In fact, his principles indicate that one may utilize two central points of departure in understanding the analogical notion of obligation. One may proceed from a theistic ethics which explicitly acknowledges the source of obligation and understands obligation in the light of a natural ratio superior which results in an ethical wisdom. In contrast, one may proceed according to natural ratio inferior which results in the development of ethics as science. In the light of the second approach, obligation is examined as an item of ordinary experience which is concomitant with the complexus of real relations in which an individual is situated. By examining the data of experience reflectively, one may gradually disengage the strict sense of obligation which implies the otherness of its source. As compared to the first ap proach, the second is certainly more limited and imperfect. However, truths concerning the nature of obligation are discernable within this order of investigation, for right reason is operative within this area of experience being analyzed. To depreciate the second approach opens the way for a view of ordinary experience which will not seemingly accord well with a fully realist metaphysics. This is one reason why Aquinas's comprehensive approach to moral notions implies a recognition of the adequacy of the second approach to understanding obligation, while he acknowledges the imperfect nature of this approach in the light of the first analysis. Both natural ratio superior and natural ratio inferior, re spectively as wisdom and science, are adequate in their own orders. But the development of ethics in the light of each stands one to the other as the more perfect to the less perfect.</page><page sequence="21">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 501 Fundamental Ontology, Scientific Methods, and Epistemic Foundations, PATRICK LYALL BOURGEOIS The aim of this paper is to show that, by an expansion of the fun damental ontology of Heidegger, the epistemic foundations of scientific methods, instructed by Heidegger's fundamental ontology, can be brought to light as equi-primordial with Heidegger's considerations of founda tions. It is certainly inadequate, after Heidegger's exposition of funda mental ontology, to deal either with questions of the relation between methods of the human and the natural sciences or with questions of the relation between explanation and understanding within strictly episte mological limits, just as it is impossible to consider phenomenology within the strictly Husserlian epistemological limits. Heidegger has made clear the ontological conditions presupposed by both of those epistemological enterprises. However, in showing the foundations of the sciences, and of knowledge in general, to be existential rather than epistemological concepts, Heidegger has precluded at the outset the possibility of explicitly manifesting this foundation as epistemic and, at the same time, has dis torted epistemology, taking it to be necessarily limited and derived, and thus not capable of grasping existence as a mode of being. This paper aims precisely to bring to light the foundations of the sciences as epistemic as well as existential. Wittgenstein, Augustine, and Language, KENNETH T. GALLAGHER Wittgenstein begins the Philosophical Investigations with a passage from Augustine, which he takes as a classical instance of the conception of language as a mosaic of "naming" words and which he uses as the point of departure for his own rejection of the adequacy of that view of language. It is the thesis of this paper that Wittgenstein has largely misunderstood Augustine's point in this passage due to his failure to observe the a priori and ideal features which Augustine assumes to be operative in language. This failure has not only skewed his own understanding of Augustine, but has led to some significant shortcomings in his own treatment of language. St. Thomas, Joseph Owens, and Existence, LAWRENCE DEWAN Fr. Owens says that existence, as grasped in the judgment, is grasped as a flux. The author (1) presents his view in some detail, together with an alternative conception, namely that existence is grasped in judgment as an absolute actuality, an immobility, beyond movement, beyond rest, beyond operation. (2) The author criticizes Fr. Owen's interpretation of texts of St. Thomas on time and existence, at the same time arguing that it is rather the author's view which is to be found in St. Thomas's texts on time and existence. (3) The author examines St. Thomas's doctrine of divine conservation of creatures, because he finds there further con</page><page sequence="22">502 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS firmation that it is the author's view of existence which St. Thomas ac tually held. This is because there St. Thomas stresses, not only the dis tinction between existence and change, but also the per se relationship between form and existence: and Fr. Owens admits that form relates primarily to immobility. A Modest Defense of "Bad Old Logic," KENNETH R. MERRILL This paper offers a limited response to P. T. Geach's charge (in Reason and Argument) that traditional logic is "a little truth in a heap of junk." Whether or not Geach's contemptuous epithet "bad old logic" reflects a just and accurate estimate of traditional logic as a whole, some of the specifications of his indictment are pretty clearly wide of the mark. In particular, Merrill tries to show, by means of numerous actual examples, that Geach's complaints about the traditional handling of three so-called informal fallacies (ad hominem arguments, begging the question, and many questions) are largely baseless. Given the number of genuine of fenses that traditional logicians are guilty of in this connection, it is regrettable (and puzzling) that Geach directs his criticisms, for the most part, against imaginary failings. Material Substance?Temporal or Eviternal?, JOSEPH OWENS NOUS Vol. 16, No. 3, September 1982 Behaviorism and the Philosophy of the Act, LAIRD ADDIS Behaviorism and the philosophy of the act are widely believed to be inconsistent with one another. The author argues that both are true, fulfilling the requirements of scientific psychology and the phenomenology of mind, respectively. The key to understanding their mutual consistency lies in the idea of parallelism and its corresponding requirement that all descriptive features of mental states be analyzed as properties, none as relations (to anything physical). So the intentional link itself must be a "logical" and not a descriptive connection. More broadly, it is required to free the act from its origins in the metaphysical notion of "activity" and the substance ontology from which that notion derives. The Relativizations of Truth to Functions: Its Expressive Power and Ontic Import, ROLF EBERLE Abstract entities (e.g., times) can be treated as (1) individuals, (2) as items which are constructed out of individuals, or (3) as respects to which truth is relativized. As an example of the third approach, a theory</page><page sequence="23">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 503 is outlined in which truth is relativized to functions, while special modal operators and a symbol indicative of correlation by one of these functions serve to express cardinal comparisons, such as "There are as many F's as G's." Does such a treatment of abstract entities (here functions) com mit a theory to their existence? Suppose it does not; then nominalists seems capable of expressing cardinal comparisons and arbitrary ances trals (contrary to what is commonly thought). Suppose it does; then already ordinary tense logic seems incompatible with nominalism. The paper discusses this dilemma without resolving it. Realism and Independence, ELLIOT SOBER Realism with respect to a given body of discourse typically maintains that certain statements have their truth values independently of our abil ity to verify them. But what is independence? Can realism take the form of a global doctrine concerning all statements? And of what rele vance is Tarski's theory of truth to realism? These questions are dis cussed with an eye to circumscribing a set of problems that an adequately articulated realism needs to solve.

He rejects the first on the grounds that too many indispensible notions are irreducible to physical notions, including ref erence, causation, and justification. The author rejects the second as ig noring the existence of "equivalent descriptions"?true but incompatible descriptions of space-time, or gravitation, or whatever. The author ac cepts the third as indispensible for coherent thinking about science or knowledge generally. THE PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY Vol. 32, No. 129, October 1982 Conversation and Conditionals, A. APPIAH Importantly different accounts are current of the English indicative conditional. The classical account is the material conditional, but recently Ernest Adams and others have defended an assertibility rule for these conditionals apparently inconsistent with the material conditional theory. That rule is that conditionals are assertible iff the conditional probability of the consequent, given the antecedent is high. David Lewis and Frank Jackson have attempted recently to show that this inconsistency is merely apparent: this paper shows why both Lewis's Gricean defence of the ma terial conditional and Jackson's defence in terms of conventional impli catures as to robustness are wrong. The paper is of interest to those concerned with: assertibility rules, conditional logic, conditional proba bility, and conversational and conventional implicatures. There are Absolute Rights, A. GEWIRTH In "Are There Any Absolute Rights?" the author argued that some rights are absolute in that they cannot be overridden, i.e., justifiably in fringed, in any circumstances. The author gave as an example the right of a mother not to be tortured to death by her son. His argument relied heavily on the principle of the intervening action. Jerrold Levinson has attempted to refute the author's thesis by constructing a case in which the principle does not apply. In the present paper the author shows that his counterexample can be given two different interpretations, but on either interpretation the right of a mother not to be tortured to death by her son remains absolute. Such absoluteness also pertains to the more</page><page sequence="25">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 505 general right of any innocent person not to be made the intended victim of a homicidal project. God's Law and Morality, S. R. L. CLARK A common argument against a "divine command" theory of morality supposes that (i) if God were the cause of acts' being right or wrong, then "right" would mean "required by God"; (ii) if so, it would be tautological to claim that God was good; (iii) if so, it would be impossible to praise God for His goodness: hence, God cannot make acts right or wrong. The author examines the three premises of this argument to show that each is mistaken or confused, and that, if God exists, His word is law. Intentionality: A Reply to Stiffler, E. J. LOWE This is a reply to Eric Stiffler's "Lowe on Intentionality" (Philosoph ical Quarterly, 32 [1982]: 70-73), in which he criticises the author's "An Analysis of Intentionality" (Philosophical Quarterly, 30 [1980]: 294-304). The author defends his original analyses of what it is for an agent to do something intentionally or unintentionally by rebutting the alleged coun ter-examples offered by Stiffler, and casts doubt on Stiffler's own proposals regarding the conditions under which ascriptions of intentionality or un intentionally are warranted. Opportunity Rights?, J. ROBERTSON This is a reply to Michael Levin's "Equality of Opportunity" (P.Q., 31, 123 [April, 1981]), in which the author argues that one may accept his analysis of opportunity and reject his conclusion that reducing the op portunities of one group to enhance the opportunities of another violates, as opposed to over-rides, anyone's rights. Roughly, appointing the less qualified over the better violates a right only if refusing to fire the less qualified to make room for the better qualified violates a right. If the latter is permissible, as it seems to be on utilitarian grounds, the former may be as well. Opportunity?Right!, MICHAEL E. LEVIN This short paper makes it clear that my position in "Equality of Opportunity" is not meritocratic, and does not imply that the candidate with the greatest likelihood of getting a job is entitled to the job. What he is entitled to is, precisely, that likelihood. It is analytic that the best qualified is most likely to get any given job.</page><page sequence="26">506 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS Aristotle on Inefficient Causes, JULIA ANNAS Aristotle twice criticizes Plato for making his Forms in the Phaedo be, in Aristotle's own terms, efficient causes, a role for which they are unsuited. This criticism is usually dismissed as totally misguided. By an analysis of the Phaedo passage and of Aristotle's notion of an efficient cause I attempt to show that there is more force to the criticism than usually allowed, and that Aristotle's real target is Plato's failure to dis tinguish between different kinds of explanation in the way that he him self does. The Existence of Social Entities, D.-H. RUBEN If the things that we say both in social science and ordinary life are true (e.g., that France is a member of the Security Council of the United Nations), then either there must be social entities to which the subject terms refer or we must show how such apparent reference can be elim inated. The author argues that there is no plausible construal of these remarks which would eliminate such reference, and he also argues that such reference is to irreducible social entities, there being no plausible non-social entities, like sets of persons or geographical locations, to which these social entities can be reduced. In particular, the author examines the thought that social entities can be reduced to sets of beliefs or other attitudes held by individuals, and show why any such identification fails to be reductive, since it would be circular. A Mistaken Argument, C. MORTENSEN THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW Vol. 91, No. 2, April 1982 Superadded Properties: A Reply to M. R. Ayers, MARGARET D. WILSON In an essay published in PR, 90 [1981]: 210-51, M. R. Ayers criticizes an earlier paper of the author's on Locke's views about properties and mechanism, and offers what he calls an "alternative" interpretation of Locke. The author maintains that Ayers shows a poor understanding of her paper. In particular he fails to note that the main (explicitly stated) purpose of that paper was to qualify recent construals of Locke as a Boylean, by showing that Locke recognized that Boylean "primary qual ities" are not adequate to "explain" many qualities of substances (e.g., thought, sensation, cohesion). The claims the author was concerned to defend, understood reasonably correctly, don't seem to differ much from Ayers's reading of Locke. Nevertheless the author concludes that her</page><page sequence="27">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 507 original discussion does need modification on two points relating to qual ities and essences. THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW Vol. 91, No. 3, July 1982 "De Re" Belief in Action, LYNNE RUDDER BAKER Beliefs and other attitudes play a prominent role in the explanation of action. It has thus seemed plausible, even obvious, that actions directed upon concrete objects are explainable in part by attitudes directed upon those objects. The aim of this paper is to expose vexing difficulties in the received views that attempt such explanation, to show that the received views can not simply be patched up to avoid the difficulties, and to suggest a somewhat different approach to the explanation of action in terms of the agent's attitudes. The Primary-Secondary Quality Distinction, EDWARD WILSON AVERILL Arguments derived from Jonathan Bennett and George Pitcher for the following three theses, as they apply to secondary qualities, are crit icized. 1) Secondary qualities (but not primary qualities) depend on the human perceptual system 2) Given any secondary quality distinction (and for no primary quality distinction) within some determinable, it is possible for someone to be unable to make out this distinction, even after a thorough perceptual investigation, although this person can make out any other distinction that normal people can make out. 3) If Q is a secondary quality (but not if Q is a primary quality), then "x is Q" is to be analyzed dispositionally in terms of how x would appear to normal observers under appropriate conditions. Finally, an account of color is developed which, if correct, shows that all of the above theses are wrong when applied to colors.

The reducibility thesis asserts that dispositional properties are identical with their physical bases; opium's dormative virtue must be some physical structure that it possesses. These two theses are examined, found to sometimes conflict, and finally rejected. Examples drawn from different areas of psychology are discussed. Kant's Paralogisms, PATRICIA KITCHER In this paper the author offers a unified interpretation of the first three "paralogisms of pure reason." Her interpretation rests on two broad claims: (1) the discussions of the paralogisms are best understood as offering caveats about Kant's own positive views of the self; (2) Kant's positive doctrine of apperception (presented in the Transcendental De duction) developed in response to Hume's celebrated attack on the idea of personal identity. With these two interpretive handles, it is possible to figure out both what Kant objected to in the reasoning of the paral ogisms and why he thought these arguments were so attractive (to himself and others). Predicate Meets Property, MARK WILSON PHILOSOPHY Vol. 57, No. 221, July 1982 How Popper's Philosophy Began, D. C.

The article offers an account of O'Hara's position as stated in his contribution to Science and Religion, and it defends O'Hara against the criticism of Witt genstein. Is Existence a Predicate?, VERA PEETZ Moore argued that "exists" is not a normal predicate like "growls" since (A) "Tame tigers exist," unlike (B) "Tame tigers growl," does not go through the various Aristotelian quantifications; but Moore failed to see that neither does (C) "Tame tigers growled in Sherwood Forest," in spite of its proper predicate "growled." (C) can be interpreted as "Sher wood Forest had tame tigers growling in it," where tame tigers are pred icated of Sherwood Forest. This suggests that (A) can be interpreted as "The world contains tame tigers," where tame tigers are predicated of the world. In (B) we predicate "growls" in its habit sense of the class of tame tigers, but it can never be a habit of anything to exist. Inserting "the" in (A) gives "The tame tigers exist" which goes through the Aristotelian quantifications but the results are tautologies and self-contradictions. "Exists" is thus a predicate, but odd. PHILOSOPHY Vol. 57, No. 222, October 1982 The Choice Between Lives, DON LOCKE In what circumstances are we justified in taking one person's life to save others? This paper discusses the distinction between three possible policies: Maximising, Minimising, and Absolutist (section I); the distinc tion between positive and negative duties (section II); the distinction be tween killing and letting die, or more generally between doing and allow ing (section III); and the distinction between direct and indirect killing (section IV). A case is made for a modified, non-absolutist version of the Principle of Double Effect. The crucial wrong is the infringement of autonomy involved in using one person's life as a means to saving others. The Justification of Morality, C. H. WHITELEY The adoption by a community of a system of moral rules and ideals, and its imposition by training and compulsion, can be justified on non moral grounds in so far as adherence to the system promotes co-operation and forbearance and thereby favours the welfare of all members. Since an effective morality depends on the convinced support of people in gen eral, the values to be upheld, which define "welfare," cannot be laid down a priori, but must be settled by negotiation, a continuous process of ad</page><page sequence="30">510 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS justment of interests between associates. All effective moralities are sec tional, requiring co-operation and forbearance primarily or even exclu sively towards associates in a limited community. But the reasons for accepting a morality within a group are, at least under present conditions, equally valid for the world-wide adoption and enforcement of rules of co operation and forbearance between communities. An Epistemological Peregrination, T. P. FLINT In this philosophical fable, Peregrine, a young bank teller, discovers a hat which has the effect, when placed on his head, of reliably generating true beliefs. Though Peregrine is examined at length by various types of scientists, no natural explanation for his singular ability is unearthed. Upon hearing about Peregrine, a group of philosophers debate whether or not the hatted Peregrine's beliefs are instances of knowledge. Pere grine attempts to help the philosophers settle their dispute, but discovers that, at least in this case, his hat is of little philosophical assistance. The True Secret of Education, BERNARD CURTIS Locke said that to get the true secret of education we must discover how to draw a child towards doing good and useful things yet leave the doing of them to come from his easy, free and active spirit. Some claim a person's acts are freely his if they are for the general good and that we naturally come to act freely unless corrupted. Others claim acts are a person's own if they are suitably produced by rational processes, as if a rationality cleansed of passion constitutes a (free) person. Such views suggest either that we can and may do more or less anything to get a child to act freely, or that we can do nothing at all, depending on whether it is thought that suitable rational processes have causal antecedents and can be engineered, or that reason operates unpredictably freely. Common facts suggest we come to do good things by cultivating proper feelings. Another Idea of Necessary Connexion, ANTONY FLEW Hume and most of his modern followers have failed to take account of contingent or physical (as opposed to logical) necessity, and of the universally familiar experience from which this other idea of necessary connection is in fact derived. The sources of this lamentable failure are two. First, Hume was above all concerned to defend his great negative insight?that, for all we can know a priori, anything may cause anything. Second, he was hamstrung by his narrowly Cartesian conception of ex perience?"the perceptions of the mind" are logically private, while their subject is an incorporeal patient incapable of agency.</page><page sequence="31">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 511 Rationality and Paternalism, E. P. BRANDON Scarre's appeal to "rationality," in his response to Schr?g on chil dren's moral standing, is not so unexceptionable as it looks. He seems to use a minimally evaluative means-end conception, adding only that there be a "systematic approach" to maximizing utility. But this re quirement rules out many actual and possible life-styles. Scarre also evades his own liberal concerns by attending only to the stark contrast between present practice and children's complete independence from adult control. The author concludes by suggesting a reason why we should not expect to find a morally satisfying account of our dealings with children. Mill on Happiness as an End, GRENVILLE WALL Stuffed Tigers: A Reply to H. O. Mounce, COLIN RADFORD Events, Ontology, and Grammar, P. M. S. HACKER Character, Virtue, and Freedom, ANDREAS ESHET? PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH Vol. 42, No. 4, June 1982 Phenomenology of Memory from Husserl to Merleau-Ponty, DAVID FARRELL KRELL A critical appraisal of Husserl's lectures on internal time-conscious ness and passive synthesis (touching the theme of memory) is followed by an appreciation of Merleau-Ponty's "Problem of Passivity." The au thor argues the Husserl's descriptions of memory processes embody prej udices stemming from the "objective time" he claims to have bracketed out and that his phenomenological method is itself a phenomenon of the mathematical imagination. The latter pursues inherited ideals of clarity, evidence, immanence, and presence which distort all mnemonic phenom ena. Merleau-Ponty eschews the representational thought, objective-lin ear time, evidence, and immanence of Husserlian epistemology. Merleau Ponty's philosophy of ambiguity responds with greater suppleness and subtlety to the most ambiguous of phenomena?memory.</page><page sequence="32">512 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS Value Judgments, JOEL J. KUPPERMAN The central question addressed is "How can one tell what is of value?" The author's answer has a good deal in common with the one that he thinks is implicit in Aristotle. In the course of presenting it, the author (1) criticizes recent ethical philosophers who have largely ignored or have sought to finesse questions of value, (2) argues that there is a genuine epistemology of value?that in cases with certain general features one can be in a position to be confident of a value judgment, and that in cases that lack these features one cannot, and (3) argues that, because of lim itations on generalization that are inherent in the subject matter, any thing like a science of values is impossible. Some Ways of Going Wrong: On Mistakes in On Certainty, DEBORAH H. SOLES Can a person fail to make a mistake, but still believe something false? Wittgenstein's program in On Certainty for the rejection of epistemolog ical skepticism requires that there be a non-trivial affirmative response to this question. The distinction which Wittgenstein draws between mis takes and mental disturbances is crucial to his refutation of skepticism, but it is a distinction which is not thoroughly worked out in On Certainty, and which has been little addressed in the literature. This paper attempts to fill both these lacunae. Choice, ROBERT G. BURTON This paper attempts to develop a paradigm adequate to capture cer tain essential features in our experience of choice. The initial formula, "I choose X," undergoes several transformations eventuating in the for mula, "I choose to do X rather than Y because.. . ." Most of the elements that emerge in this analysis are implicit in the dictionary definition of "choice" as "the voluntary act of selecting or separating from two or more things that which is preferred." The paper concludes with a brief dis cussion and resolution of the problem of "choice without preference." Marx's Critique of Philosophical Language, DANIEL J. COOK Though Marx never systematically developed a theory of language, he often commented in his pre-1848 writings on the role of language in traditional philosophies and ideologies. In this paper, the author ex amines Marx's critique of philosophical and ideological language. The first part is devoted to sketching the origins of Marx's ideas on language. The second part analyzes the strategies Marx used in his earliest critical writings to criticize the "languages" of philosophy and ideology. The third part examines Marx's (and now Engels') comments in The German Ideology on the role and use of language in furthering the ideological</page><page sequence="33">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 513 purposes of the ruling class. The final part of the paper extrapolates Marx's own position on the nature of the proper language for philosophy and the social sciences. A Memo on Method: Hilary Putnam, R. M. MARTIN Most of the difficulties with Putnam's general methodology in his Mathematics, Matter and Method can be traced back to his lack of interest in exact statement and formalization. He rests content with formali zation in mathematics, but is slow to espouse it when we step beyond. He writes philosophy in the intuitive style of the working scientist. Cu riously, however, the methodological situation of the philosopher, as com pared with that of the scientist, is just the other way around. Formal ization in mathematics is of course of the highest importance, but is not always needed. The mathematician has the technical skill, partly as a result of training and partly as a result of insight, to handle the quan tifiers, for example, with unexceptional correctness. And he may do this perhaps never having heard of the theory of quantification as such. Rare indeed is the philosopher of whom this could be said. In philosophy, and also in methodology and the philosophy of science, a very self-conscious use of the quantifiers is needed at almost every turn. And with the quan tifiers of course, a host of non-logical predicates, including "hidden" ones, follows along, the exact theory of which constitutes the given domain of inquiry. To keep on the right track in domains of inquiry that are not primarily scientific, the self-conscious use of logical techniques is almost indispensable, as is more and more coming to be recognized. Putnam writes for the most part as though no advance had been made in such technique since 1940 or thereabouts, and it is this that constantly leads him astray on very fundamental issues. Of course one can be led astray by many other means also, and keeping on the right track, both meth odologically and content-wise, is, as we all know, a next to impossible undertaking. Semantical Rules and Misinterpretations: Reply to R. M. Martin, HILARY PUTNAM What is Husserl's First Philosophy?, JEFFNER ALLEN Nonevidential Reasons for Belief?, A Jamesian View, STEPHEN L.

GERRAUGHTY Traditional interpretations of the Euthydemus find little of value in its sophistical sections. Where value is found at all it is in those aspects of the sophistic display which point to (but do not adequately analyze) serious issues in other dialogues. This paper argues that there is meth odological value intrinsic to the sophistic sections, that taken together these displays make a coherent and valuable contribution to an under standing of sophistic argumentation, and of the foundations of correct reasoning. Each of the sections deals in some way with the principle which produces the sophistic tricks, and the principle itself which reveals and organizes around itself the many sides of the sophistic display. The first display offers an apparent refutation of this principle, one based only on verbal ambiguity. In the second display the principle is denied from Parmenidean and Heraclitean perspectives, and the implications of such are analyzed. In the third display the brothers misapply this principle to relational predicates so as to work their tricks. Plato reveals here the necessity and limits of the principle of contradiction, and how its denial and misuse stand at the basis of various sophistical arguments. Wanting to Want, A. C. W. BETHEL Harry Frankfurt has made a distinction between what he calls first order desires, such as a desire for a Porsche, and second-order desires, such as a desire to desire (or a desire not to desire) a Porsche. He claims that this analysis of the structure of the will can provide an account of free human action. The author argues against Frankfurt as follows: First, his account does not really free our wills, but only binds our wills at successively higher levels of desire; second, there is no good reason to think that desires of any level higher than second exist; and third, critical review of one's desires necessarily involves the idea of an ought, and is thus not really a second-order desire at all. Rightly understood, all "higher order" critical review of one's desires occurs at a single "level" of review, contrary to what Frankfurt believes, and this fact makes room for the theory of agency. Rights, Duties, and Justice in Hobbes, MARCUS G. SINGER What is considered in this paper is the Hobbesian contention that there is no morality without government and consequently that there can</page><page sequence="35">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 515 be no moral criticism of government. It is argued that there are vital shifts in the way Hobbes thinks of rights, duties, and justice, without which outright contradictions result. Thus the Hobbesian claim that, in a state of nature, everyone has a right to everything, is equivalent to the claim that, in a state of nature, no one has a right to anything. But on Hobbes' own account there must be rights as well as duties in a state of nature, hence also justice and injustice. It is argued that confusion about duties and justice as well as rights from failing to distinguish rights from liberties and from power. Knowledge and Belief: Contexts of Newman's Epistemology, FLOYD C. MEDFORD The paper assumes the usefulness of juxtaposing the major philo sophical, religious, and literary components of the milieu of Newman's notion of knowledge. Rooted in classical philosophies of mind, his view draws both upon the idealisms of Kant and others and upon the variety of romanticisms of Coleridge and of the Oxford Movement. His Apologia Pro Vita Sua holds in uneasy reconciliation his insistence at once upon the necessity of rational grounds for belief and upon the psyche's need for transcendence of rational processes. The resulting empiricism, most clearly stated in his Grammar of Assent, exhibits some of the theoretical problems common to that modern school of philosophy. Descartes, Locke and the Soul of Animals, KATHY SQUADRITO The view that animals are thoughtless brutes was the subject of considerable controversy during the seventeenth century. Locke clearly perceived his own position to differ substantially from that of Descartes. Historians usually credit Locke with an anti-Cartesian view of the nature of animals and with setting the vogue in France for a concept of soul that differentiated people and animals only in degree. According to Bayle, for example, "Locke has declared himself against those who will not attribute reason to beasts." In this paper the author shows that Locke does not attribute reason to beasts, that his ontological position does not differ in great detail from Descartes' and does not differ in its social consequences for animals. The author argues that the major differences between Des cartes and Locke on the question of animal consciousness are for the most part linguistic. Popper's Defense of Tradition: World 3, Semantics and the Concept of an Objective Norm, ANTHONY MURPHY Popper's three world doctrine, it has been argued by Feyerabend and Krige, is a rejection of the type of critical dualism of facts and norms articulated in The Open Society. Feyerabend argues further that world 3 acts as a methodological prison designed to restrict the free decision of the individual theoretical scientist. It is the author's position that Pop</page><page sequence="36">516 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS per's concept of world 3 is not a rejection of critical dualism but rather an attempt to allow for the existence of free normative decisions within the context of a binding tradition. The key to understanding this move is the notion of an objective norm. Specifically the author argues that Popper's pluralistic epistemology is based on a traditional many-levelled semantics developed originally to combat psychologism and used now to place the issue of the choice of methodological norms within the frame work of a theory of tradition. PHRONESIS Vol. 27, No. 2, 1982 Two Conceptions of Vacuum, DAVID SEDLEY Vacuum, literally "the empty," was integral to the systems of the early atomists Leucippus and Democritus, and of their heir Epicurus (c. 300 B.C.). The widespread assumption that it is empty space relies on an unhistorical characterization by Aristotle. Both the notion's prehistory and Democritus's terminology for it suggest rather that it is "emptiness," an element coordinate with body ("fullness"), occupying space and capable of locomotion. This dualism of fullness and emptiness is remarkable for its conceptual economy. But Aristotle's critique of void in Physics, IV exposed a fundamental difficulty, and suggested an alternative approach which Epicurus took up and developed. Epicurus becomes the first to recognise geometrical space, a three-dimensional extension which persists whether occupied or unoccupied. Vacuum is merely the name applied to this "intangible substance" when accidentally unoccupied. It does not differ essentially from "place"?occupied space. Aristotle and the Emotions, STEPHEN LEIGHTON According to Aristotle's Rhetoric, ta path? alter our judgment and are accompanied by pleasure and pain. But how they alter our judgment and what the nature of the accompanying pleasure and pain is, is far from clear. These matters are the topic of the first two sections of this paper. The author finds five different ways in which ta path? may alter judgment; and he finds that the accompanying is a conceptual point, the pleasure or pain being unique in number, intensity and kind for a given path? type. In the third section of the paper, the author tries to determine just what ta path? are. It turns out that in his Rhetoric Aristotle delimits the realm of emotion, offers criteria for this realm, and keeps it distinct from related realms, most notably desire. Why Aristotle does this and how the work here differs from other discussions of ta path? is examined.</page><page sequence="37">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 517 Plato's Myths of Judgment, JULIA ANNAS The article analyses the judgment myths in the Gorgias, Phaedo and Republic, showing that the philosophical "message" of the myth is dif ferent in all three cases and that they should be assimilated to a single form of "judgment myth." In particular the increasing importance of the idea of reincarnation alters the significance of the element of judgment in the myth. The differences between the myths reflect Plato's increas ingly serious preoccupation with the role of good and bad consequences in a moral argument showing the agent the value of justice. The End of the Euthyphro, C. C. W. TAYLOR The apparently aporetic conclusion of the Euthyphro contains a hint that hosiot?s is properly conceived as assistance given by men to the gods in their task of ordering the universe. Since the only activity in which the gods need human help is the production of good human souls, hosiot?s is thus identical with goodness, seen in relation to the gods. The Euthy phro thus hints at the doctrine of the unity of virtue, which is maintained, implicitly or explicitly, in other early dialogues. Against the difficulty that Socrates argues from the hypothesis that hosiot?s is a part of justice it is suggested that that comes ultimately to the tautology that fulfilling religious obligations is a special instance of fulfilling obligations, which is compatible with the unity thesis. In thus concealing a positive doctrine behind an apparently aporetic conclusion Plato proceeds as in the Laches and Charmides. Melissus' Way of Seeming?, PETER BICKNELL RATIO Vol. 24, No. 1, June 1982 Descartes ' Trust of Clear and Distinct Perceptions, JANICE THOMAS Are all Descartes' clear and distinct perceptions equally reliable, equally to be trusted? In an article in Ratio, 21, 1 (June 1979): 73-84, Donald Sievert argued, on the basis of his reading of Descartes' discussion of the wax in Meditation Two that they are not?that some of our clear and distinct perceptions are not to be trusted. The author's contention is that Descartes believes we have equally certain knowledge of the wax and of the self and that our perception (in the technical sense of "having a mental intuition") of each is as reliable as our perception of the other. We must be careful to distinguish the Cartesian view of what, in Medi tation Two, we know to exist (the self but not the wax) from Descartes' views on what we can know about.</page><page sequence="38">518 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS The Problem of Prior Probabilities in Forensic Proof, L. JONATHAN COHEN Ockelton criticizes only one of the six main lines of argument that were advanced in The Probable and the Provable against a Pascalian anal ysis of Anglo-American standards of forensic proof. But even there he disregards the fact that such an analysis must take account of prior prob abilities when elucidating why two testimonies sometimes corroborate one another though each separately has a low probability of truth. Ock elton's attempt to rescue Ekel?f's analysis does not succeed, since if he were to repair his omission to analyse the concept of evidential relevance he would again have to refer to prior probabilities. Such an appeal to prior probabilities inevitably runs counter to the legal principle that no account should be taken of facts that are not properly before the court. Spatially Coinciding Objects, FREDERICK C. DOEPKE This article presents a theory of the (time-variant) "constitution" relation, which obtains between two distinct objects which occupy the same place at the same time. It explains why pairs of them (e.g., a gold statue and the gold of the statue, a person and his or her body) are in discernible in a variety of logically independent respects, such as place, color, shape, and weight. It accounts for the formal features?notably, the asymmetry?of the constitution relation. (Recall that identity is sym metrical.) In rebutting a variety of attempts to subvert David Wiggins's argument that distinct objects can spatially coincide, the article offers the following: a general argument against relativizing identity (e.g., sor tally or temporally); some explanation of the theoretical point of concepts of continuants; an anti-reductionist argument in favor of admitting con stituted objects (e.g., organisms) in addition to objects which constitute them (e.g., collections of fundamental particles). The Use of Critique in Meta-psychology, PAUL BRANTON Cognitive psychology needs to secure its foundations by meta-pys chological critique. The author applies the critical method to tacit as sumptions about basic human psychological faculties?thought, emotion and action. E.g., in regard to consciousness and thinking, one is not immediately conscious of every item of knowledge. Skilled acts like walk ing and tool-using can only be performed if immediate mental activity (pre-conceptual, non-verbal but not immediately conscious) is possible. If "knowledge" of necessity, causality and relatedness in space and time becomes immediate, behavior need not be automatic. The behaviorist denial of autonomous choice intervening between knowing and doing falls to the ground. A psychological theory of interests is outlined in which emotion provides the impetus to act and also performs an essential "crypto-valuation." Yoking values to action leads to an operational de</page><page sequence="39">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 519 scription of reasoning as choice between courses before action and so to a purposive explanation of human behavior. The Importance of Critical Ethics for the Social Sciences, LOTHAR F. NEUMANN The Use of Mathematical Probabilities in Assessing Corroborative or Convergent Testimonies, C. M. G. OCKELTON Nominalism and the Argument from Causality, ALBERTO CASULLO SYNTHESE Vol. 51, No. 2, May 1982 Three Forms of Realism, PAUL HORWICH A distinction is developed between: (1) Epistemological realism: the commonplace claim concerning some specified class of postulated entities that they really do exist; (2) Semantic realism: the anti-verificationist, anti-reductionist, anti-instrumentalist view to the effect that statements about theoretical entities should be construed at "face-value" and not understood as covert observation reports; (3) Metaphysical realism: the doctrine that truth is a primitive, non-epistemic idea of correspondence with reality, not captured by Tarski's schema ("p" is true iff p), and pro viding a target for the design of our confirmation procedures. It is argued that (a) metaphysical realism should be rejected, (b) contrary to Dummett and Putnam, that this rejection does not impugn semantic realism, and (c) that semantic realism should satisfy most self-styled realists, since it involves the idea that the facts await our investigation independently of our thought and of our capacity to discover them. Strict Finitism, CRISPIN WRIGHT The following theses are argued: that a generalized intuitionist po sition cannot be so much as formulated and that even a most local in tuitionism, argued for the special case of arithmetic, is hard pressed ef fectively to stabilize and defend itself; that strict finitism remains the natural outcome of the anti-realism which Dummett has propounded by way of support for the intuitionist philosophy of mathematics; that it is powerfully buttressed by the ideas of the later Wittengenstein on rule following; and that there is no extant compelling reason to suppose that</page><page sequence="40">520 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS its involvement with predicates of surveyability calls its coherence into question. Conceptual Scheming, Or, Confessions of a Metaphysical Realist, CLARKE GLYMOUR "Conceptual Scheming or Confessions of a Metaphysical Realist" argues by counterexample against Davidson's thesis that most of our be liefs must be true. Use/mention confusions are attributed to Putnam's argument that the ideal theory must be true. Why There Isn't a Ready-Made World, HILARY PUTNAM Modern materialism is the only version of metaphysical realism with clout, but modern materialism is incoherent. The snag is the impossibility of reducing intentional notions to physicalistic ones. Contemporary at tempts are surveyed, and found to "cheat"; each attempt smuggles in an intentional notion which the materialist has not shown he can reduce. "Natural metaphysics"?metaphysics within the bounds of science alone? is as much of a failure as the traditional speculative metaphysics. SYNTHESE Vol. 51, No. 3, June 1982 Who Was Dr. Who's Father?, MURRAY MCBEATH Was Dr. Who his own father? Jonathan Harrison has told a time travel story in which a man becomes his own father, and this article is an examination of a story based on Harrison's. It is argued that the feat of fathering oneself is logically possible, but that, because it involves a causal loop, it is not scientifically possible?even though backward time travel may, for all we know, be scientifically possible. As well as consid ering detailed questions about the coherence and psychological plausibility of the story, the article also includes discussion of more general problems concerning the direction of time, the direction of causation, and the re lation between them. Categories, Toposes, and Sets, J. L. BELL This paper is an introduction to topos theory which assumes no prior knowledge of category theory. It includes a discussion of internal logic in a topos, a characterization of the category of sets, and an investigation of the notions of topology and sheaf in a topos.</page><page sequence="41">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 521 A Solution to the Lottery Paradox, NATHAN STEMMER The lottery paradox shows that some of the assumptions which people have made regarding the notions of belief and acceptance are incompat ible. In the present paper, it is argued that the incompatibility is not a real one. It derives from the ambiguity of the terms 'to believe' and 'to accept'. In order to solve the paradox, it is therefore necessary to dis tinguish between the various meanings of the terms that are relevant to the paradox. It is shown that by distinguishing between two kinds of uncertainties, Humean and evidential, it is indeed possible to distinguish between three different meanings of the terms. Once the distinction has been made, the incompatibility disappears. This can be considered as a satisfactory solution to the lottery paradox. Cohen on Verisimilitude and Natural Necessity, G. J. ODDIE The problem of truthlikeness (or verisimilitude) is to give a rigorous account of what it takes for one theory to be closer to the truth than another. Recently (in Synthese, 45 [1980], p. 489 ff.) L. J. Cohen has argued that the problem is not important, "because it is misleading to charac terise the aim of science as truth or verisimilitude." Moreover, Cohen advocates research into a different concept, which he calls "legismilitude" and which is best characterised as "nearness to natural necessity." In this paper it is shown that Cohen's arguments fail to establish the redundancy of the concept of verisimilitude, that they fail to show the inadequacy of a particular explication of verisimilitude (advocated by Pavel Tichy and Graham Oddie) and that Cohen's own problems of legisimilitude can be solved given an adequate explication of theory-distance for higher-order languages. On the Laws of Nature, G. D. WASSERMANN Well-formed idealized empirical generalisations (EGs) form a variety of classes and are, or ought to be, of a statistical nature (thereby avoiding, in particular, Hempel's paradox, as Kyburg and von Wright have noted in special cases). By convention certain EGs are referred to as "laws of nature" (LNs) (here called Class 1 LNs). But Class 1 LNs do not differ in type from certain other EGs that are not referred to as LNs. In ad dition there exist "Class 2 LNs" which are special instances of starting hypotheses of hypothetico-deductive theories (HDTs), and do not differ in status from any other starting hypotheses of HDTs that are not referred to as LNs. Class 2 LNs ought to be falsifiable and usually have a restricted range of applicability. The relations between Class 2 LNs and Class 1 LNs (and more generally between well formed empirical generalizations and starting hypotheses of HDTs) are discussed.</page><page sequence="42">522 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS The Logical Study of Science, JOHAN van BENTHAM The relation between logic and philosophy of science, often taken for granted, is in fact problematic. Although current fashionable criticism of the usefulness of logic are usually mistaken, there are indeed difficulties which should be taken seriously?having to do, amongst other things, with different "scientific mentalities" in the two disciplines. Nevertheless, logic is, or should be, a vital part of the theory of science. To make this clear, the bulk of this paper is devoted to the key notion of a "scientific theory" in a logical perspective. First, various formal explications of this notion are reviewed, then their further logical theory is discussed. In the absence of grand inspiring programs like those of Klein in mathematics or Hubert in metamathematics, this preparatory ground-work is the best one can do here. The paper ends on a philosophical note, discussing ap plicability and merits of the formal approach to the study of science. SYNTHESE Vol. 52, No. 1, July 1982 Realism and Formal Semantics, DAVID PEARCE and VEIKKO RANTALA In this paper, the authors discuss the problem whether model-theo retic properties of formal semantics are, in general, of any relevance for deciding the correctness of scientific realism. Contrary to some views of H. Putnam and J. Winnie, it is argued that the adoption of a model theoretic semantics for empirical theories is compatible with either a realist or instrumentalist view of science; and, more generally, that results of a model-theoretic nature are of minor significance for the issue of realism. Realism, MICHAEL DUMMETT Realism concerning a given subject-matter is characterised as a se mantic doctrine with metaphysical consequences, namely as the adoption, for the relevant class of statements, of a truth-conditional theory of mean ing resting upon the classical two-valued semantics. It is argued that any departure from classical semantics may, though will not necessarily, be seen as in conflict with some variety of realism. A sharp distinction is drawn between the rejection of realism and the acceptance of a reduc tionist thesis; though intimately related, neither entails the other. Re alism is to be classified as naive, semi-naive or sophisticated: the first of these involves an all but unintelligible epistemological component.</page><page sequence="43">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 523 Why Reason Can't Be Naturalized, HILARY PUTNAM The author argues that attempts to naturalize epistemological no tions are all failures, whether the attempt proceeds by reduction or by "elimination." Generally such attempts take the notion of "truth" for granted; but the naturalist has no coherent account of truth to offer. Some attempt to get by with a purely "disquotational" account of truth; such an account cannot tell us how uttering a sentence can be right or wrong, and hence cannot distinguish speaking or thinking from mere noisemaking or mere subvocalizing. The author urges that we must give up the positivism (and/or materialism) which underlies these attempts if philosophy is to be a healthy subject. Realist Semantics and Content Ascription, COLIN McGINN The Charybidis of Realism: Epistemological Implications of Bell's Inequality, BAS C. van FRAASSEN SYNTHESE Vol. 52, No. 3, September 1982 Realism and Understanding, MATTI SINTONEN This paper examines some arguments by Michael Dummett to the effect that language understanding cannot be equated with knowledge of the truth conditions of its sentences, and that realist theories of meaning which make that assumption are circular or unexplanatory. It is argued that Dummett's circularity arguments impose impossible constraints on accounts of understanding: no account, realist or verificationist, can meet them. This shows that there is fault with Dummett's notions of under standing and knowledge, rather than with the choice of the concept of truth as the central concept in a theory of meaning and understanding. The paper also examines what consequences this finding has for Dum mett's grand design for a theory of meaning, and for his interpretation of Frege. Schlick's Empiricist Realism, ADAM DAUM This paper is a critical exposition of Schlick's Allgemeine Erkennt nislehre. Allgemeine Erkenntnislehre expresses Schlick's early epistemo logical views, before he came under the influence of Wittgenstein, and it contains important attacks on both Kantianism and positivism. The main topics discussed are: the nature of epistemology; the nature of concepts;</page><page sequence="44">524 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS definitions; analyticity; the nature of judgements, and their relations to definitions; the nature of truth and falsity; the nature of knowledge; the distinction between knowledge and acquaintance; logic; the concept of "substance"; time and space; scientific concept-formation; measurement; the nature of reality; the relationship of science to reality; the psycho physical problem; the relationship between Schlick's epistemology and his views on relativity theory; verificationism and theoretical equivalence. The Direct Perception of Universals: A Theory of Knowledge Acquisition, VIKI McGABE A theory is presented which proposes that knowledge acquisition involves direct perception of schematic information in the form of struc tural and transformational invariances. Individual components with sa lient verbal descriptions are considered conscious place-holders for non-conscious invariant sch?mas. It is speculated that theories positing mental construction have three related causes: The first is a lack of con sciousness of the schema processing capacities of the right hemisphere; the second is the paucity of adequate words to express schematic rela tionships; and the last involves the dominance of verbal processes in con sciousness. Philosophical theories are reviewed and schematic data rel evant to biological survival is offered. Applications to education are sug gested.
