<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE BACKGROUND OF THE HAGGADAH By A. MARMORSTEIN, Jews College, London, England MARCIONMARCION AND JEWISH RELIGION IT was for a long time impossible to ascertain Marcion's place in, and influence on the history of Jewish religion. That we must make room on the leaves of our history for Marcion was rightly recognised by H. Graetz,1 who, as a very circumspect searcher of Jewish history and with a high sense for gnostic movements and their influence on Judaism, devotes about half a dozen lines to this certainly extraordinary personality. He is surely not to be blamed for being brief on this occasion, and merits praise for mentioning him in depicting Jewish conditions, spiritual and intellectual, in the second century C. E. For Marcion with his adherents and followers contributed a great deal towards shaping Rabbinic theology and Jewish religion. Although his name is never mentioned nor is there any probability of evidence for his Jewish origin, he is lurking behind many questions and attacks raised against the Jewish doctrine of God, the Scriptures and Israel. The real importance of Marcion generally was often surmised, yet only a few years ago truly established by Adolf von Harnack in his investigations about Marcion.2 The wealth of material heaped up and the far reaching conclusions arrived at by the great German theologian in this publication concern students of Jewish theology in just the same measure as they interest the searcher of Christian origins and cognate problems. It is idle to speculate nowadays, what the history of the world would have looked like, how the course of humanity would have shaped itself, if the Gospel of Marcion had triumphed over the teaching of early Christianity.

MARMORSTEIN [2] war, of cruelty of all kinds, on the one side, might have been the greatest blessing to a world steeped in blood and murder during the last 1800 years. His condemnation of marriage, his loathing of the bringing forth of children, on the other, might have out balanced this and led to the extermination of the human race. Who could dare to prophesy with the vision of a true historian looking backward, what, under these conditions and circum stances, Jewish history could have told or achieved? Yet, there is no need to fall in a network of dreams and visions, when the life and work of the heresiarch supply us with plenty of actual information to remain on the solid ground of facts. The city of Sinope, in the Pontus, on the south coast of the Black Sea, produced a number of great men. The cynic Diogenes, the Jewish Bible translator Aquilas, and the greatest critic of the Bible, Marcion, first saw the light of day at Sinope. The two latter, the great admirer and the greater enemy of the Bible, were contemporaries. It would be of the greatest interest to know whether these two men ever met, ever saw each other, ever aired their views one before the other. No record is avail able to answer these queries. Jews and Jewish communities were scattered over all the towns and cities of the Pontus. Old-Rabbinic literature preserved the name of Pontus.3 There is some chance that another translator of the Bible, namely Theodotion, also hailed from the Pontus,4 if reliance can be placed on a somewhat obscure report. Marcion's personal relations to Jews and Judaism are not recorded, even his contact with Christianity is not clear enough. Altogether the heresiarch did not provide his admirers and opponents with biographical material, as lesser men in his and all times did. Many saints are prone to self-advertisement, sometimes under the cloak of humility. His date, and this is of primary importance for our investigation, can be fixed, with some certainty, between 85-165 C. E. His personal influence and intellectual power was at one time so great and so much felt that the whole edifice of the Christian Church was in great danger of collapsing owing to this great personality and the churches founded by him. Yes, the church fathers of the West, 3 Krauss, Gr. L. W. II 429. 1 v. Harnack, I. c. p. 21 note 1.</page><page sequence="3">[3] THE BACKGROUND OF THE HAGGADAH 143 a host of clergymen, like Justin, Ireneus, Tertullian, Origen and others, fought against Marcion and his followers. They prevailed. The crisis passed in the West. Not so in the East. There Marcion's teaching had a longer life. There it flourished till the fifth cen tury, or longer, till it grew old, and was supplanted by new sects, e. g. the Manichees. We, naturally, can only look as outsiders on the struggle between Marcion and the church fathers. It concerns us, however, that Marcion was followed in Syria, Meso potomia and Palestine during a part of the Tannai tic period and the whole of the ages of the Amoraim. Yet, it may be asked, how does that affect Jews and Judaism? Since Marcion's thoughts centered around the Hebrew Bible and the Jewish Doctrine of God, his activity, his influence could not remain limited to Christians, but left very remarkable traces on Jews and Jewish communities. It must have provoked a counteraction among Jews, just as among Christians. Jewish teachers were forced to protest against Marcion's doctrine or to defend their own just as was done by the church fathers. However great the gulf was between the latter and the former, practical considerations taught both that with the loss of the Bible both Church and Synagogue, Christianity as well as Judaism, are doomed for ever. One has to look at the Antitheses of Marcion, which are lost, as preserved in fragments in the works of the church fathers, to find clear proofs for these facts. Marcion's teachings contained just as great a danger for the Church as for the Synagogue. However that may be, Jews who came into contact—and how could they avoid it?—with Marcion's pupils and followers in Rome or Antioch, in Tiberias or Caesarea, were very deeply impressed by the questions raised or the contradictions pointed out by agitators and fanatics. The Bible, the only treasure which escaped the fire of Jerusalem, was in the greatest possible danger. The doctrine of God, as taught and believed in the synagogues and the houses of the Jews, was at stake. The future and the further existence of the Jewish people, already weakened by so many political debacles and worsted by so many sectarian splits, seemed threatened. The difficulties felt by readers of the Bible are older than Marcion and his age. Readers of the Scriptures asked their</page><page sequence="4">144 A. MARMORSTEIN [4] questions and pointed out their surprise at this or that law or story. Jewish circles as well as Jewish Christians applied to them the allegorical method of interpretation by which troublesome passages could be smoothed out. Old Alexandrian doctrines and Philonic ideas were brought forward from antiquated storehouses of learning and dusty corners of religious or philosophic thoughts to defend the Bible. Marcion contended that the letter of the text must hold water. There were others who eliminated incon venient passages as forgeries. Marcion was more consistent than these. Either the whole, or nothing. Is it at all likely that such a gigantic fight, pro and con the Bible, should have left the Jews cold? Or could it remain unknown to them? A secret to those who visited the synagogues, and their spiritual leaders? We essay to consult the Rabbinic sources on these questions. By such an investigation we can only gain. First of all we may be enabled to pierce through the darkness covering those ages, and secondly comprehend better the background of the teachings of the Haggadah. II The chief feature of Marcion's teaching was the doctrine of the two Gods. The Demiurgos, the god of the Jews, the god of this world, the known god, on one side, and the highest god, the great unknown god on the other side. We will have to hear something about the nature of these two Gods later on. Here, it may be sufficient to point out that this dualistic conception of the Godhead is common to all teachers and sects, who sail under the common flag of Gnosticism. They differ from one another in many, important and petty details. In the principle of dualism they concur. Yet, Marcion's dualism is at variance with the dualism of the other Gnostics. He speaks of an unknown God, who is none else but Jesus Christ, the Christian God. It is still argued and left open, whence this dualistic theory origi nated ; whether it came from Iran or Greece ;5 whether it purposed to answer the old query: Unde malum? or syncretize Polytheism and Monotheism, or bridge over the unbridgeable. Who knows! 1 v. Zeller, Philosophie der Griechen, 3rd ed. vol. 2a, 591ff.</page><page sequence="5">[5] THE BACKGROUND OF THE HAGGADAH 145 One fact is plainly clear that these theories made considerable inroads among Jews, as well as among Christians and pagans. Otherwise their frequent occurrence in older and younger sources of the Midrashic literature cannot be properly accounted for. Let us consider first statements bearing on this point, on the dualistic theories of the Gnostics. We begin with the Unbeliever,6 or according to another source the Emperor, who essayed to impress R. Gamaliel II with his idea deduced from Scriptures that the God, who created the mountains, did not create the wind. This interlocutor was a dualist, but by no means a Mar cionite, for the latter would never have raised such a difficulty. Surely, the one Demiurgos created both. It would be too early to expect Marcionite teaching to be current in the time of R. Gamaliel. Marcion never tried to prove nor did he assert that the Bible teaches the existence of more than one God, one Cre ator. He is not the Supreme Being, he is inferior to the Unknown God. Next to R. Gamaliel II, his contemporary R. Akiba has to be mentioned. His polemic goes against dualists, who believe in two Gods, e. g., Heaven and Earth.7 In his exegetical way he asserts that some people might put in Gen. 1.1 the idea that Heaven and Earth are two gods. The particles את nullify such construction. Marcion knew better than teaching such doctrines. The dualists of R. Akiba could not have been followers of Mar cion. A late Talmudic tradition makes Elisha ben Abuyah, a contemporary of R. Akiba, a believer in dualistic theories. His theories are not preserved to enable us to form a correct opinion of his attitude towards gnostic doctrines. There is a report in 66 b. Sanh. 39a א"ל האי כופר cf Yalkut Makiri,' Amos, ed.

Marmorstein, Dvir,Dvir,Dvir, 1 1923, 126-127 ; v. now Aptowitzer, MGWJ 73 (1929) p. 114, who sees in this discussion between R. Ishmael and R. Akiba an allusion to the Christian doctrine of Trinity, because the idea of Heaven and Earth being regarded as deities, must appear stupid (unsinnig). It is still to be proved that R. Akiba had the faintest idea of the Trinity, furthermore whether R. Akiba paid any attention at all to Christian beliefs and teachings. R. Akiba must have known more about the conception of divinity and about the mythological meaning of Ge and Uranos among his contemporaries than we give him credit for.</page><page sequence="6">146 A. MARMORSTEIN [6] Aramaic,8 according to which Aher saw Metatron sitting and writing the merits of Israel. This vision gave rise to doubts and scepticism in the heart of Aher. There was namely a tradition that there is neither sitting, nor strife, nor weariness above. Aher, therefore, concluded that there must be two powers, God and Metatron.» The report should not be considered too seriously in guiding us in trying to establish Aher's peculiar heresy. As a Jewish Gnostic, he might have taught and believed in the existence of the Highest and Metatron. The next teacher who is to be mentioned here is a contemporary of Marcion, R. Simeon ben Johai. He depicts in a parable citizens criticising a palace built by their king. The original form is preserved in the Tannai tic Midrash on Deuteronomy, the Sifre; the younger sources have an altered and adapted version. This can be clearly seen by comparing the text of the different sources. These are: (a) Sifre,10 (b) Midrash Tannaim,11 (c) Gen. r.12 and (d) Eccl. r.13 The order in Gen. r. and Eccl. r. is somewhat puzzling. Both have R. Huna (two sayings), R. Hona, R. Nahman (two para bles), R. Simeon ben Johai, R. Levi b. Hayta and R. Isaac b. Meryon. R. Levi's saying taught by R. Phinehas concludes the Haggadah. The order cannot be justified and appears strange. Yet the name of R. Simon ben Johai cannot be a mistake for a 8 b. Hag. 15a. י Metratron gave rise to many ill-founded speculations. One identifies him with Mithra, v.

Further S. has first סהלך על ראשי and then פני הפוכים MT. vice versa. 1ל The parable of the king and his palace is not in S. and MT. The agree ment begins with שמא יבוא. Attention may be called to the fact that in the parable people are allowed to visit the palace. The parable exaggerates, when assuming that the palaces might have been open to sight-seers and passers-by. The visits, surely, were limited to guests and distinguished visitors.</page><page sequence="8">148 A. MARMORSTEIN [8] This comparison leaves no doubt about the origin of the saying. The omission in the Sifre and MT. of the reference to God and his heavenly court, and its insertion in the younger Midrashim is very instructive. It corroborates an assumption made by the present writer in another place, that the whole conception of God with his heavenly court, or academy is not older than the third century, and was apparently unknown to the Haggadists of the Tannaitic age.18 Just as there can be no question as to the mutual relation of these four sources to one another, so there can be no doubt as to the origin of these criti cisms. What necessity was there on R. Simeon ben Joljai's part to bring such questions to the pulpit? He wants to ridicule the Marcionite talk about the pussilitates of the Creator, the Demi urgos. Tertullian goes against the "impudent" Marcionites in the Church just the same as, at the same time, R. Simeon ben Johai in the Synagogue. Tertullian says about the Marcionites: "contravertuntur ad destructionem operum creatoris; minirum, inquiunt, grande opus et dignum deo mundus."19 The creation of the world and man are bad, an abominable failure. R. Simeon retorts: Nobody can complain about not having three hands, eyes, ears, legs, etc. Ill A closer investigation of. this Piska, which is ascribed to R. Simeon ben Johai, may lead to far-reaching results, if examined in this new light. Bearing in mind the "pussilitates" of the Demiurgos, ascribed to him by Marcion, we may find in the four homilies preserved in our Piska four sermons dealing with Marcion's objections to the Bible. We observed that one of these homilies is older than the third century. The same date may be given to the other homilies. All of them expound Deut. 32.4. Each sentence is most appropriate to emphasize the perfect ness of God's work, the justice of his ways, his truth and upright ness, all of which were partly misjudged, partly denied by 18 Marmorstein, Anges et hommes dans l'Agada.

His justice, which was recognized, is also faulty.20 The first homily, undoubtedly, rejects one of Marcion's criti cisms of the work of the Creator. The creation of man must not be considered as a gross failure. God trusted the world. Man was not created to be wicked, but to become just. He deals rightly with man. Each of these concluding sentences of this first homily retorts against Marcionite calumnies, that God is envious of the world, inspired by evil desires to make man wicked, and treating him badly. The second homily refutes another of Marcion's much emphasized pussilitates. The subject of the homily is the same as that of the first one. The Creator's deeds are perfect with all his creatures. Evil intentions, unworthy aims, which the Creator is alleged to have harboured in his innermost heart, must not be repeated and thought of. "None can or may say: Why was the generation of the flood drowned, why was the generation of the Tower dispersed from one end of the earth to the other, why were the inhabitants of Sodom burnt by fire and brimstone, Korah and his set swallowed up by the earth, Aaron distinguished by the dignity of the priesthood, why was David crowned? Why? Because God grants to each indi vidual what he rightly deserves." What did the preacher intend by complaining about the punishment of the generations of flood and dispersion, Sodomites and Korah on one side, and about the priesthood of Aaron and the Kingdom of David on the other side? Without Marcion we cannot fathom the purpose of this homily. Let us compare this homily with Marcion, and we will surely behold the proper background of this Haggadah Marcion proves the Creator to be conditor malorum by relating and elaborating the story of the flood, the destruction of Sodom, a0 Each of the first three homilies is closely connected with the text, the fourth is rather fragmentary, yet can be completed by means of the Ps. Jonathan targum on Dt. 32.4. The arrangement of the different homilies illustrates types of sermons as preached in the second century. Put in their proper light they reflect the anxieties and worries felt by preachers and audi ence alike. The proper understanding of the external form is as much needed as the history of the thoughts which agitated the mind of the authors of these homilies; however, that must be left for discussion in a forthcoming chapter.</page><page sequence="10">150 A. MARMORSTEIN ' [10] the plagues of Egypt, the hardening of Pharao's heart, the visiting of the fathers' sin on their children, and the favouring of the wicked, of giving honour to and exalting bad men. Among the latter, naturally, one would not miss David, Solomon, Lot and his daughters, Moses, and Joshua.21 Does our homily not read exactly as a refutation of Marcion's theories? Can it be an accident that the Jewish preacher mentions in the first part the flood, Sodom, Korah, etc., and in the second part Aaron and David, almost the same people, whom Marcion points out for the opposition? That cannot be a play of accident. There must have been channels which led from the Marcionites to the Synagogues and back. We will soon be able to show that this homilist was by no means the only one, who felt himself forced to stand in the breach. There were a number of Jewish sages who repelled Marcionite attacks. Our preacher concludes with describing God as a faithful treasurer, who rewards and punishes according to man's deeds. The third homily22 is also of the same age, and pursues the same aim, as the previous two. God pays the reward of the righteous, and punishes the wicked, but the good deeds of the latter, and sins of the former are not lost sight of. Everything will right itself at the future judgment. These doctrines are pointed out very sharply, in order to combat heretical opinions on these beliefs. Marcion believed in and preached of God's justice, just as the rabbis, but even this virtue was marred by being faulty. This seems to me to be the subject of the fourth homily, which is preserved only in a fragmentary form. IV Was there any need on the part of Jewish teachers and preachers to pay such attention to these heretical views? Is it not rather exaggerated to surmise that these few resemblances and réfuta tions reveal new spiritual and intellectual influences, of which the 31 For fuller details about Marcion, v. von Harnack, 1. c. p. 95.

What do we know of close social and commercial relations between Jews and Gentiles to be able to assert such a far-reaching influence of Marcionite propaganda among Jews? Such a long and dry catalogue of God's sins and shortcomings, as was preached and proclaimed in the assemblies and schools of Marcion's followers, as pointed out in the following lines, could not have remained a secret to Jews, who dwelt among them. The rabbis, just as the church fathers, and perhaps even more so, have had to take up the cudgels for their God and Bible. It is well established that the list of God's sins in the Clementine Homilies (II 48f) faithfully reproduces the attitude of Marcion and his followers to the Hebrew Bible. We give a short extract of these two chapters. "God lies, makes experiments as in ignorance, deliberates and changes his purpose, envies, hardens hearts, makes blind and deaf, commits pilfering, mocks, is weak, unjust, makes evil things, does evil, desires the fruitful hill, is false, dwells in a tabernacle, is fond of fat, sacri flees, offerings, etc., is pleased with candles and candlesticks, dwells in shadow, darkness, storms and smoke, comes with trumpets, shoutings, darts and arrows, loves war, is without affection, is not faithful to his promises, loves the wicked and adulterers, and murderers, changes his mind, chooses evil men." Twenty-four (a number favoured in Rabbinic writings) charges! All of them based on narratives in the Scriptures. Such voices could not have been silenced at any time by merely ignoring them. These assertions must have made an immense impression on Jews of different types of upbringing and sentiment. They must have turned with their troubles and difficulties to their spiritual guides and leaders. Are there any traces of these attempts to refute these slanders and damaging attacks against the religion of the Jews? I propose to treat them individually. (1) God lies! The rabbis assert in many places that God's name or seal is truth. R. Isaac, in the 3rd cent., seems to have had this heresy in mind, when preaching on God and Truth. His sermon is based on Ps. 119.169 ("The beginning of thy word is truth"), cf. Jer. 10.10 ("and the Lord God is truth"). Since He is truth and his word is truth, all his decrees are just, and no creature could plead that two powers gave the Law, two</page><page sequence="12">152 A. MARMORSTEIN [12] powers created the world.23 No student of Marcion's religion can miss the significant points in this preacher's homily, which no pilpulistic Midrash exegesis ever could guess. Analysing his words, we see first of all that God's truthfulness or his identifi cation with truth, is being deduced from Scriptural evidence. God does not lie, but he is truth. Secondly, whence do people get the notion of God's untruth or lack of truth, by finding faults with God's justice. This argument does not hold its ground, for his deeds and decrees are just. Thirdly, this being the case, that God is truthful and just, the whole theory of the two gods falls to the ground. R. Isaac, whose teachings reveal great interest in defence of Judaism and in polemics against heathendom, gnostics and probably Christians as well, may have known or heard of Marcion's teachings.24 R. Abin, 25 another teacher of the same type and predilection as R. Isaac, explains the same passage in Jeremiah by emphasizing the doctrine of God's Eter nity and single Rulership of the world. An often repeated saying has it that truth is the seal of God.26 In later sources truth becomes one of the Divine names.27 On the basis of what facts the actual charge of God's untruthfulness might have been made, is not recorded. (2) The accusation that God makes experiments, and of his ignorance, is based on God's testing Abraham (Gen. 22.1). The difficulty in the text stands, whether one translates: "God did test Abraham" or "God tempted Abraham." The Haggadah shows traces of discussions on this point, which prove that the generations before Marcion must have paid close attention to this problem. At least no direct influence of Marcion can be established. R. Jose, the Galilean must have had a very cogent reason for stating that נסה means neither "tested," nor "tempted," 2נ Gen. r. ch. 1, ed.

R. Akiba is inclined to take the verb literally. God really tested Abraham, he was free to obey or disobey. Why did God test him and leave him free choice? In order that the nations could not argue: "He was confused, bewildered, and he was not conscious of his deeds!"28 Another difficulty of the same sort was provided by Exod. 15.25, which was felt strongly before Marcion launched his destructive criticism of the Bible. This instance is noteworthy from more than one point of view! We learn of the continuity of the attack as well as of the defence. R. Joshua ben Hananiah disposes of the difficulty of ושם נסהו in the same manner as R. Jose the Galilean did later on with 29.והאלהים נסה R. Eleazar of Modi'im agrees with R. Akiba.30 The latter do not object to the literal meaning of the text, the former explain the difficulty away. A later teacher, disregarding the text, makes of the sentence: "Our fathers tested God,"31 Surely only under great stress of gnostic attacks could such a forced explanation originate ! Ex. 20.20 לבעבור נסות אתכם offered Gnostics and Bible critics of various schools a good opportunity to assert that God makes experiments and is ignorant, otherwise why should he say: "In order to test you?" Here, the Mekilta, disregarding the view of R. Eleazar of Modi'im and R. Akiba, records merely the opinion of their opponents. The verb לנסות does not mean "to test," but "to exalt," "magnify."32 Nevertheless, the 8ג Gen. r. 55, ed. Theodor 589, Tantj. B. וירא old ed. B. 26, Agadat Be reshit 31.2. Pes. r. 170a.

The same diatribe is used by the Syrian Church Father Ephraem v. MGWJ. 43.530, yet it is doubtful whether he copied R. Akiba; or did he quote a saying current in his days? It is not impossible that both Akiba and Ephraem faced represen tatives of the same schools. 4» Mek. 46a. MRSbJ, p. 73 שס נשא לו גדולה or שם נעשה נישאו! לישראל based on II K. 25.24.

Hanina, and R. Eleazar b. Pedat exemplified by parables the conception that God actually tested Abraham. A potter knocks harder on the sound pots than on the weak ones. A flax maker tries the strong flax, the farmer places the heavier burden on the strong animal, so God tests the righteous people, and not the wicked, the former can stand trials, not so the latter." But could these Tannai tes and Amoraim see the danger in broadcasting the view that God tests people? Did they not confirm the antagonists in their view that God makes experiments and acts in ignorance? The tests have been real, but not as experiments and marks of God's ignorance, but they served as proofs to the world that God's chosen ones were pious, righteous and worthy of God's favour. Now, this latter point, as we saw already above, and will have plenty of opportunities to recur to again, was harped on most religiously and continuously by Marcion and his followers. The allegation of God's ignorance was not so dangerous as the teach ing that God chooses unworthy, and punishes good people.34 No, the pious and worthies of the Bible were not evildoers and cul prits, they only proved their worth. A feeble, but all the same very interesting solution of our difficulty is offered by R. Abin. He makes Israel point out contradictions between Scriptural passages. They are like pupils, we are told, who find discrepancies 33 Gen. r. ch. 55.1, ed. Th. 585, chap. 32, ed. Th. 290, where, however, R. Isaac's parable is cited in the name of R. Jonathan b.

One may take the opportunity here to call attention to the affinity between Stoic teaching and Haggada, another large subject, which illuminates the background of the Haggada from another point of view. The idea and the aim of this teaching as represented by the teachers mentioned in the text, fully agrees with maxims to be found in the writings of the Stoa. Seneca, de de Prov. I Says: "God does not keep a good man in prosperity, He tries, He strengthens him, He preserves him for Himself." Or, ibid. IV: "Those whom God approves of, whom He loves, He burdens, He proves, He exercises, but those whom He seems to indulge and spare, He prepares for future ills." I hope, at a future occasion, to present my whole material to show the relation of the Haggadists to the Stoa. 3* v. above p. 150 and later on pp. 181 f.</page><page sequence="15">[15] THE BACKGROUND OF THE HAGGADAH 155 between their master's word on the one side, and his doings on the other side. A conflict between what they say and what they do. The questioners are here Jews. Lev. 19.18 teaches prohibition of vengeance. Nahum 1.2 states clearly that God is taking vengeance. Similarly Deut. 6.16 says: Ye shall not test God, yet Gen. 22.1 says: And God tested Abraham? The preacher draws a line between Israel and Gentiles.35 However unsatis factory the reply seems to be, one fact is certain that Marcion's antitheses antitheses penetrated into Jewish circles, just as they found their way into Christian homes, and stirred up feelings of contempt. For these questions are neither Christian, nor pagan, but Mar cion's to prove the great contrast between doctrine and practice in the Bible.36 It would be entirely wrong to assume that the point of view taught by the opponents of R. Akiba was altogether lost sight of. That is not so! Curiously enough—and it must not be ac counted for as a mere accident, but may have a deeper reason, which cannot be searched out here—R. Joshua's and R. Jose ha-Gelili's view is found only in the anonymous Haggadah. There the verb נסה is taken and expounded in the sense ascribed to it by these scribes. God did not test, but exalted Abraham. The anonymous teachers of the Amoraic age are preaching under the dark shadow of Marcionite influence. Why (was Abraham found righteous, was he exalted)?—was the impatient and im pertinent question raised by the opponents. The answer is: In order that the measure of judgment should have some justifi cation!37 The fragments of Marcionite teaching make it quite clear that Marcion's chief objection was to the מדת הדין, the exact measure of judgment. The Known God, the God of the Jews, shows no traces of affection, no signs of love, no vestige of kindness. Strictest justice is observed, so that God becomes cruel in Marcion's eyes. All the same, God is found guilty of injustice in choosing wrong and unworthy people. There is one of Marcion's greatest blunders, by which a schoolboy could 5נ Gen. r. ch. 55, ed. Th. 586.

In the Haggadah as well as in the Cynic-Stoic sermon the preacher or philosopher introduces ideas, sayings or arguments of a real, or made up, questioner. In order to refute their views, which the preacher dislikes or deems harmful, they are put in this manner hypothetically. We are in our case not at a loss or without proofs that such questions were raised, such objections aired by people, who belonged to Marcion's way of thinking. It will suffice to refer the reader to the Matrona, who worried R. Jose b. Halafta with about a score of Bible questions39 and must have been imbued with Marcionite doctrines, as will be shown further on— actually asserts her master's point of view: "Your God chooses, whomsoever he likes!" He is arbitrary in his choice. The scribe demonstrated to her in a rather palpable manner that God is capable of selecting right people and rejecting the wrong ones.40 (3) These tests and experiments of God are signs of his ignorance. So are the questions asked of Adam41 and of Cain.42 Furthermore his descents, among others, to Sodom and Gomor rah.43 He must descend, in order to see for himself what happens in Sodom, otherwise he would not be aware of the events below. These are some of his pussilitates et infirmitates et incongruentes. The first of these allegations was dealt with by one of the earliest Apologists of the Church, by Theophilus in his work addressed to Autolycus.

TheophilusTheophilus surely bore in mind teachings emanating from that quarter when he said: God did not ask this question (namely: Where art thou, Adam? Gen. 3.9) out of ignorance, but in his long-suffering. God wanted to give Adam a fair opportunity for repentance and confession.4s I italicize these two words for a reason. The very same defence is preserved in a late Midrash, which surely used older material, the date of which must go back as far as the third century. I mean the Midrash Haggadah46 where we read: "And God said to Adam: 'Where art thou?' " Did not God know where Adam was? Surely, he did, but he wanted to open a way for him, perhaps he might repent. The very same point must have figured as one of the many attacks against the Bible, collected and spread by Hiwi of Balkh in the period of the Geonim, who is related spiritually to Marcion, and greatly indebted to his inheritance.47 Dark corners of the East may have preserved Marcionite doctrines and writings, espe daily in Hiwi's native place or country, which he perused to a great extent. Of course the possibility of Hiwi's acquaintance with Midrashic literature must not be lost sight of. The old heretical writings perished, yet their destructive queries lived on in the literature of the rabbis as well as in that of the Church fathers. However that may be, they are eloquent witnesses for Marcion's influence in the Synagogue. The alteration of the word א:9ה (where art thou?) into א'?ה (How?) must be con sidered as an endeavour on the part of the scribes to avoid our very troublesome query.48 « v. A.

" Striking parallels can be quoted from the Midrash Haggadah,50 Pseudo-Jonathan Targum,51 the Chapters of R. Eli'ezer,52 the Vita Adami,53 and the Gaon Saadya,54 for the extension and duration of this question, which enjoyed longevity. God is not ignorant, but he likes to open the door of repentance and con fession to sinners, who are his creatures. The negation is just as important as the affirmation, considering the attitude of Marcion. We turn from this later Haggadah to the earlier one. R. Abba b. Kahana refutes the third proof of this school. Marcion, as far as our evidence goes, based his theory of the ignorance of the Demiurgos on Gen. 18.2. An omniscient God need not go down and see! The Amora explains this phrase in the sense of giving the people of Sodom a fair chance of repentance.55 Again the same argument we met in Theophilus and Rabbinic sources. Yet, the idea is older. A preacher, whose name is not preserved, proves that the generations of the flood, of the tower, the people of Sodom, and the Egyptians were granted an oppor tunity of repentance, but they did not avail themselves of God's offer.56 Now, it cannot be a pure accident that these tannaitic homilists should have catalogued the very same people, whom Marcion pointed out as examples of the gross cruelties committed by the Demiurgos. The latter preacher is not concerned about the ignorance of the Demiurgos, only about his justice. R. Abba b.

We are able to prove the great antiquity of the argu ment that God does not, or did not condemn the generations, or the wicked without just cause and without giving them ample opportunity to repent'. The Mekilta offers a striking parallel to the passage of the Sifre Deut. analysed already previously." In both Haggadas God's action against the generations of the flood, tower, Sodom and Egypt is defended, or excused, presupposing, naturally, that his actions were severely criticised. One has to bear in mind Marcion's and his followers' attitude towards these Bible narratives to grasp what induced the older and younger teachers to recur to this subject of the generations of the wicked. There is no other explanation for their words except the force of Marcionite influence. Otherwise, one would like to know, what need is, or was, there to justify God's judgment? He is not responsible to anyone? Who can call him to account for his deeds? There are many more passages in the Midrash group ing these and other people of the same type together. One preacher proves that just as God punished by the East Wind the genera tions of the flood, the tower, Sodom, Egypt, the Ten Tribes, Judah and Benjamin, Tyre, so will he treat the wicked in the future.58 The generations of the flood, of the Tower, the Sodom ites were punished according to their deeds.59 R. Abba b. Kahana, who lived in the latter part of the third century and was more or less acquainted with contemporary culture and knew some of the manifestations of what was considered modern thought, was forced to refute heretical teachings. The older way of think ing, as represented by older Tannaites, saw no cause for deviating from the accepted literal interpretation of these passages. They enumerated the descents of God from heaven60 just as they did not mind enumerating the ten trials of Abraham,61 in spite of the great difficulties involved in their teaching, as shown " v. above pp. 149 f.

In spite of the fact that so early a writer, as Aristobulus, taught that these descents must not be understood literally.62 Furthermore, one of the rank of the Tannaites himself proclaimed that the passages speaking of God's descent and ascent must not be taken literally. It is not surprising at all to learn that this saying was phrased by R. Jose b. Halafta, who was a great master in discussing religious problems with a lady who was rather inclined to the gnostic way of thought.63 Marcion's ques tions, as we see, brought about many dead-sea fruits of apolo getics. Yet, there was also some practical result. The doctrine of God's Omniscience was closely defined and concisely formu lated in Rabbinic theology. God's omniscience is without limit and knows no boundary neither in time nor in space. (4) The Demiurgos suffers from ignorance, therefore he tests people, but he also deliberates and changes his purpose. The Church fathers furnish several instances for this most charac teristic feature, and combine with it the contrarietates precep torum. He regrets having created man, because he turned evil.64 Marcion thought of Gen. 6.6. Teachers of the second century, R. Judah b. liai and R. Nehemiah pondered on the word וינחם (and he repented), and they try to soften the rather harsh mean ing of the verb.65 R. Joshua b. Karha, also of the same period, had a dialogue with a man, who might have been a Marcionite, although he is styled נוי in our sources,66 on this subject. God does not know the future. Consequently, he cannot be omniscient. A number of preachers of the third century, like R. Aibu, R. Levi and many others, dealt with our problem. No wonder that in contemporary literary documents the wicked are made to say: "God does not know what we are meditating, or doing in secret."67 There again, one can only guess whether Hiwi of 626262 Eus. pr. ev.

Our material is so scanty about Hiwi's life and age, that at our present state of knowledge the solution of such a question can not be even attempted. Daniel el-Kumissi68 and Saadia69 tried to smooth over this trouble as in a previous instance. Surely, Gen. 6.6 was not the only passage, which was and could be used by troublers like Marcion. He also could, and surely did make use of other narratives of the Bible. For instance, I.I. Sam. 15.11 נחמתי כי המלכתי את שאול in spite of I. Sam. 15.29 ולא ינחם כי לא בן אדם הוא להנחםלהנחם. Marcion, for reasons known to him, but unknown to us, did not avail himself of this text.70 He saw in Saul's history an instance of God's changeability. First God selected Saul, then he rejected him. The same hap pened with Solomon. These are some of God's contradictions. An omniscient God should not commit such errors of judgment, and ought to be above such contrarietates. Work on Sab bath was prohibited, yet Joshua was commanded to carry the ark around Jericho for seven days. He was bound to disre gard the Law of Sabbath. This is a Marcionite thesis, which recurs very often in the works of the Church fathers and Christian Apologists to prove the change of the Law, especially Sabbath, wrought through the appearance of Jesus Christ.71 Under these conditions we cannot be surprised to find this argument among a number of heretical objections to God and Bible discussed in Rabbinic sources.72 All of these questions alluded to are intro duced by the rhetorical catchword אם יאמר לך אדם common to the diatribe and favoured by orators of old. The answer does not nearly meet the point of view of the questioner. The trouble was that God contradicts himself by forbidding work on Sabbath 68 v.

The reply was not addressed to out siders, merely to Jews, who became worried by Marcionite teach ings, yet still attended the Synagogue and did not give up entirely their loyalty to their people. Other contradictions pointed out are: the prohibition of images on the one hand, and the erection of the brass serpent on the other hand; or the pleasure and dis pleasure with sacrifices. There are traces of polemics against the brass serpent in sources which are certainly older than Marcion, e. g., the Wisdom of Solomon and Mishnah." One of the inter locutors of Justin alleges that he tried in vain to elicit a reasonable explanation for this event from the Scribes.74 The Matrona, mentioned above,75 seemed to have been a serpent worshipper, a member of the sect of the Ophites, who were closely connected with the Marcionites.76 In one of her dialogues with R. Jose ben Halafta we read the assertion: My God is greater than yours!77 The opposition to the sacrifices is also older than Marcion, and the contradiction was most likely felt by previous generations. The whole question of sacrifices will be discussed in a further paragraph. (5) Next to God's ignorance and changeability the Demi urgos' envy and jealousy greatly agitated the mind of Bible readers. A philosopher asked R. Gamaliel II: Why should God be jealous of idols, since there is nothing at all in idols? R. Gamaliel compares idolatry with a man calling his dog by his father's name, or vowing vows by the name "dog;" of whom will the father be jealous? Of the dog or the son? Thereby the philosopher tries to prove the futility of the idols.78 Similar dis eussions are preserved between philosophers and the Elders in " Sap. Sol. 16.7.

Pagans were greatly surprised at reading in the Jewish Scriptures of God's envy and jealousy, and ridiculed the announcements of Jewish propagandists, who preached the superiority of the Jewish doctrine of God. Marcion, considering his strong anti-Jewish bias, must have been greatly impressed by older anti-biblical sentiments and Jew-baiting feelings. The later Haggadah mitigated the older view.82 God is not jealous. He is the Lord of jealousy, but the latter does not overcome him. Or, God is merciful in all circumstances, but punishes idolatry with vengeance. The dividing line between the older and the younger Tannaitic Haggadah is here clearly marked. We have here a repetition of our earlier experience as to the question, whether God tests, or tempts people. The spreading of this idea that the Demiurgos is full of petty jealousy became a most characteristic dogma of the Gnostics. By it the Minim were recognised. R. Nehemiah, a teacher of the second century, makes up a dialogue, quite usual in the old Diatribe, between God and Moses. When Israel made the calf, Moses tried to avert God's wrath, by saying: Lord of the worlds! They (Israel) provided you with an helper, and you are angry for that? The calf will assist you! You will bring forth the sun, your helper will busy himself with the moon ; you with the stars, he with the planets ; you will give dew, he will cause the wind to blow; you will give rain, he will hasten the growth of the plants! God replies: Moses, hast thou become a Min? There is no reality in the calf! Then, says Moses, if so, why art thou angry, O God!83 Moses, here in the dialogue, actually repeats the argument of the Gnostics.

For this shortcoming of the God of the Jews, Marcion could find many proofs in the Bible. One can easily imagine the Rhetors in the squares and the philoso phers in the streets of Tiberias and Caesarea denouncing and blaspheming the God of the Jews for hardening the tender heart of old kind Pharaoh. The sound of the speeches, delivered by gesticulating and mimicking Greeks and pseudo-Jews must have penetrated into the quiet study of R. Johanan b. Nappaha in Tiberias, and greatly upset his equilibrium. So much so that he exclaimed when reading Exod. 10.1 : Thence the Minim found a support for their argument that God prevented him from repenting his (Pharaoh's) evil doings! Considering some of the gnostic arguments, we referred to above, and their refutation by the rabbis, we can fully appreciate this teacher's perplexity. God does not punish without giving the evildoer a chance of repentance. Here the wicked was prevented from reforming his ways and deeds! Whilst R. Johanan could find no guide in his perplexity, his colleague, R. Simeon ben Lakish, was less dis turbed. He says: Let the mouth of the Minim be closed for ever! God gives notice to a man once, twice, thrice, and he does not repent. Then he (God) prevents him from repenting, hardens his heart, in order to punish him for all his sins! The same happened with Pharaoh! God sent: to him his prophets five times, and he did not take to heart God's words. Thereupon God said: Thou hast stiffened thy neck and hardened thy heart, behold I increase thy defilement upon defilement.85 Our teacher found a scriptural evidence for this theory in Prov. 3.34 (Surely he scorneth the scorners) ; a later Haggadist, R. Phinehas ha-Kohen deduced it from Job 36.13 (the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath, they cry in vain when he bindeth them).86 God waits, with great patience, for the return of the wicked!

Rab, a Babylonian sage, who was perhaps less affected by gnostic troubles and criticisms, repeats the older, somewhat harsher doctrine.88 God leads the nations astray, entices them to worship idols, in order to punish them in the end. This teach ing can be traced to the older Haggadah.89 A surprising doctrine, which can be found also in older Greek theological conceptions.90 The difference between these two trains of thought, as outlined here, is most remarkable. It is surely due to Gnostic agitation and Marcionite activities, in the third century. God is not cruel, not jealous so as to mislead people, but in his long-suffering he waits for their change of heart. Failing this, he punishes as severely as they deserve. (7) God makes blind and deaf. It is not quite clear, what the heresiarch meant by this. Did he think of his favorite pro tegees of Sodom (Gen. 19.11)? or similar occurrences? We have no material to decide this question. (8) God commits pilfering ! The interlocutor, who figures under the name of Kaisar and discussed religious problems with R. Gamaliel II91 and the twice mentioned Matrona of R. Jose b. Halafta92 paid attention to this Marcionite allegation. Both of them bluntly assert : Your God is a thief I Here again we find an instance of our suggestion that Gnostic, or Marcionite objec tions, were drawn from earlier anti-Jewish polemics. Many of the Church fathers taught that Marcion's calumnies against the Demiurgos in his Antitheses included the view that the God of the Jews induced his people to spoil the Egyptians.93 The Anti Semites of Alexandria never wearied of repeating this fact in order to defame the Jews as thieves and robbers.

The Talmud'6 copied from an old source a discussion, or a claim put forward by the people of Egypt and a defence of the Jews placed before Alexander the Great. The former asked for the restitution of the spoil taken by the Israelites from the Egyptians at the Exodus from the house of bondage. A man called Gebihah ben Pesisah defended, and put forward a counterclaim for wages due to the slave builders in Egypt. This defence agrees with the view of the writers of the books in the Apocrypha and later in the patristic literature.'7 All these differ ent writers and apologists agree that the spoil was in lieu of the wages for the services and the work earned by the Israelites in Egypt. The Egyptians were still the debtors, and the Israelites were not to be blamed for their action. The reproach must have been felt very intensely by the Jews, therefore no wonder that many scribes refer to this subject.'8 (9) God mocks! Marcion might have used Prov. 3.34 for his argument, a passage, which was by R. Simeon ben Lakish quite appropriately applied to Gnostics and the like." There were surely other passages in the Bible, known to Marcion to substan tiate his blasphemies against God. R. Aha reports in the name of R. Samuel b. Nahmani100 that the phrase ישחק (mock-laugh at) occurs four times with reference to God in the books of Psalms and Proverbs.101 As far as we know this great Haggadist was neither a lexicographer, nor a compiler of a concordance, then what did he endeavour to do by registering these four pas « ch. 48. 95 ch. 10.20, and ch. 12f. 6י b.

He, surely, could not have meant to supply heretics with weapons against the Jewish doctrine of God. On the contrary, he defended it and refuted or minimized the force of their, on the surface, strong proofs of God's mocking at people. The verb does not mean God mocks, but God says that the wicked are laughing at one another. Another teacher, R. Isaac b. Hama,1" denies altogether the possibility of such an action on God's part. All his deeds and manifestations are in holiness. God's holiness excludes the shadow of such an action, of mocking at his créa tures. There must have been teachers to whom the fact that God mocks, or makes fools of sinners, was not repugnant at all. God helped the people of the generation of the Tower. They succeed by God's help in order that he may laugh at them at the end. The old idea known to us from many mythologies that the gods lead people to their destruction, in a new garb! Why does God do such a thing? In order that the wicked should not be enabled to say: "Had we built the tower, we would have ascended to heaven, and dethroned him." Well, you built the tower, and what was the result?103 A similar thought recurs in a sermon speaking of the suspected woman. God says to her: You can mock, laugh at your husband, but not at me! I am sitting on high and am laughing at my creatures!10'' A Baby Ionian teacher mollified this rather crude conception of God by saying, that God laughs with, and not at, his creatures, except on the day when idolatry will be judged and condemned.105 (10-11) God is weak! and unjust! Jews and Christians alike were taunted by heathens and Gnostics together with this argu ment. It is treated at some length in the present writer's The Old Old Rabbinic Doctrine of God, I. pp. 170-176, and need not be repeated here.

The accusations of God's injustice, making evil things and doing evil, require some further élabora tion. Marcion never denied the justice of God. The known God is the ôuatos âeos in contradistinction to the foreign, unknown God, the ayavos 1?60s.106 Simon Magus says to Peter that neither man nor God can be just and good at the same time.107 Peter replies in real haggadic style: "For he is good, in that he is now long-suffering with the penitent, and welcomes them; but just when acting as a judge. He will give to everyone according to his deserts!" These sentences are re peated, almost literally, scores of times, in the folios of Rabbinic writings.108 It is not unlikely that these dangerous denials of God's justice, and destructive teachings of God's injustice im pressed the Jewish mind much more and with greater force than that of the Christians, who were not reared in this fundamental belief of Judaism. Moreover Christians themselves found fault with this teaching, the Jewish conception of reward and punish ment. We noticed the remarkable fact that Mekilta and Sifre preserved eloquent testimony of the spiritual fight between Gnosis and Judaism, the attack of the former and the defence of the latter. The crisis, engendered chiefly by Marcion, threat ened the whole edifice of Judaism not less than that of the Church. R. Ishmael teaches10' that the reward of the righteous and the retribution of the wicked are alike immeasurable. The former reach the mountains of God in height, the latter the abyss in depth. R. Akiba110 taught that God is very particular with both, the righteous as well as the wicked. He punishes the righteous 106 v. Harnack, I. c. p. 86ff. 1»י Clem. Horn.

Just the reverse with the wicked. The same teaching is given in the sermon quoted above111 from the Sifre.1" There it is anonymous, here the name of the teacher is mentioned. The view is often repeated and was favored by many Haggadists."3 The teachers essay to reconcile God's justice with his goodness. Both are shown to just and wicked alike; both share, according to R. Akiba and his followers, reward and pun ishment. A teaching was current that God does not withhold from any creature his reward."4 Yet we learn that God mea sures, or is particular with, the deeds of the righteous to a hair's breadth."3 It was not easy to balance between two extreme views. One insisted on God's one-sided and pedantic justice, the other extended his goodness to the utmost limits. Neither actually agrees with daily experiences, with the brighter and shadowy colours of human existence!—there must be a middle course. To find the same is almost impossible. Yet, a healthy way of thinking was to be found here, as well as in other exasperating perplexities ! (12-13) How can God be good, since he made evil things? Moreover, he himself does evil! He, the creator of the world, made bad things and made the bad things badly. Gnostics never stopped finding fault with the Demiurgos.

MARMORSTEIN [30] and others mention among other pusillitates of the Creator ridi culed by Marcion, the creation of small, stupid insects. It must be in view of these Gnostics and other enemies of the Bible that some preachers uttered an often repeated saying: Even those things, which seem to you superfluous in the creation (world), e. g. flies, etc., are part of the creation, and act as ]God's messengers.117 The Prophet Elijah asked R. Nehorai, who was contemporary with the originator of the previous apology, about the purpose served by their creation. R. Nehorai says: When people sin, God looks at these insects, and says: 'They are useless things, yet I do preserve them! Men, who might become right eous, how much more should they not, as they deserve, be utterly destroyed!' "8" The same interlocutor asked of the same scribe about the origin of and the reason for earthquakes. It seems that Elijah acted in both dialogues as the mouthpiece of gnostic arguments and heresies."' The two cases are, naturally, different from each other. The first, the creation of insects, illustrates the making making of bad or evil things, the second, the earthquake, shows God as doing evil. Marcion's theology was so bitter against the conditorconditor malorum,"° no wonder that the scribes had to pay close attention to such views and opinions, most harmful to the believer. The whole Bible was ransacked by Marcion to establish the evildoings of the Demiurgos. It cannot be only accidental that Marcion as well as the preachers of the Synagogue group together the generations of the flood, of the tower, Sodom and Gomorrah, Pharaoh, Sisera, Nebukadnezzar, Sennacherib, and others. We saw already once, or twice, the inner connection between Gnosis and Haggadah on this point."1 Here we turn to two homilies, "י"י Gen. r. ch. 19, ed.

Jose, the Galilean,122 and the other to one of the latest Palestinian Haggadists, R. Tanbuma.123 The first is based on Deut. 32.34. The word כמוס means that the cup of chastisement is preserved with God for those who despise, ridicule, laugh at the words of the Torah. One drop is missing. The aforenamed wicked people drank some of it, some part of the same is left for all the generations till the resurrection. There is no healing for the nations, yet there will be for Israel. What does all this mean? The Midrash Tannaim furnishes some variants and supplements the shorter version of the Sifre. None of the textual means at our disposal suffices to remove the many obscurities darkening this ancient homily. The long list of peoples, who cruelly suffered at the hand of the conditor malorum makes it imperative to look here for some defence of calumnies brought forward against Biblical doctrines. Those sufferers tasted merely a part of their well-deserved pun ishment. It was a mere drop, and not the full measure of their deserts due to their wickedness. God is good, even in the hour of punishment. Again the incompatibility between justice and goodness, coupled with the view of the evildoing of the Creator. The mutual relation of these two attributes crops up again and again. R. Eliezer ben R. Jose ha-Gelili surely felt very strongly the harmful ascendancy exercised by Marcion's well aimed criti cism of the Bible. He was a very prominent teacher after the Bar Kokba war. Agitators and writers did not appeal in vain to the cruelly defeated victims of Rome in their critical hour of disappointment and despair. The combined effects of political helplessness and spiritual agitation made themselves strongly felt among the Galilean Jews. Bearing these facts in mind, we are better able to throw light on our teacher's homilies. Once he said : One may utter a part of God's praise in addressing him directly, and his whole praise in speaking of him indirectly. The proof for the first half of the sentence is adduced from Ps. 26.3: "Say unto God: How terrible art thou in thy works." That implies God's justice. This is only a part of his praise. The second proof, Ps. 136.1, comprises the whole of God's praise, namely his goodness, IM Sifre Deut. § 324, Mid. Tannaim p. 200, M. Ps. 75, 4. "3 Mid. Psalms, ch. 18, ed. Prag, 16d.</page><page sequence="32">172 A. MARMORSTEIN [32] his mercy, that endureth for ever. The terrible works of justice are in complete harmony with God's everlasting mercy.124 He preserved also in another place a nice piece of gnostic dogmatics and exegesis which must be discussed here. God gives blessing and curse, treats equally the doers of good and evil, sinner and righteous.125 In other words, considering God's justice divorced from the conception of goodness, there would be no difference between good and evil, curse and blessing, righteousness and sin. Marcion was the forerunner of Nietzche in preaching the gospel of the Umwertung der Werte. Let us analyse now the homily of our scribe. Gen. 4.7 (if thou doest well, thou shalt not be accepted, if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door), Prov. 18.21 (death and life are in the power of the tongue, and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof), and Prov. 11.31 (the righteous shall be recompensed in the earth, much more the wicked and the sinner). The actual arguments of the heretics are not repeated. They are alluded to in the way of the Haggadic diatribe by the words מי לחשך which agrees with the later 126.אם יאמר לך אדם These three passages, apparently, have been put together to demonstrate that under the rule of the world creator, and under his peculiar sense of justice, there is practically a world of difference between good and evil, virtue and sin, piety and wickedness. All are treated alike. The theories advanced and developed by R. Ishmael and R. Akiba are of no practical value. R. Eli'ezer proves from Deut. 11.26, Prov. 14.14, and Prov. 16.4 that those, who do well, will share blessing, the doers of evil will be cursed; both depend on man's relation to God, on his obedience or disobedience to the word of God ; lovers of good and evil will eat the fruits of their lips, guard thy tongue from evil, turn away from evil, and do good; and, finally, the Lord Sifre Num. § 10. פצינו שאומרים פקצת שבחו של ט' שאמר והיה העולם שני אפרו לאלהים כי נורא מעשיך עם אומרים מקצת שבחו של טי שאפר והיה העולם קיו לבו"ד.

God in his justice combines mercy with Law. We have a third homily of R. Eli'ezer b. R. Jose ha-Gelili which has a bearing on Marcion's Antitheses. Marcion, we learned, liked to compare the unworthiness of God's friends with the worthiness of God's enemies. Our Tannai te does the same in an opposite direction. He adduces a list of Biblical personages, who show humility; their humility increases the more they are exalted, e. g., Abraham, Moses, Aaron, and David,127 not so Nimrod, Pharaoh, Sennacherib, Nebukadnezzar, and Hiram. God invested them with greatness, magnified them, and finally they rebelled.128 What did our Tannaite mean by this Antithesis?129 His teaching can be understood and illustrated by contemporary heretical doctrines. These sayings of R. Eli'ezer b. R. Jose ha-Gelili are really masterpieces of Haggadic lore. No wonder that R. Johanan b. Nappaha, a special connoisseur of literary documents, drew his hearers' attention to the words of this master of religious thought. We bridge over the centuries between this teacher and one of the latest great Haggadic teachers of Palestine. The centuries which elapsed between the former and the latter left many traces of the changes caused by the ages and the men who lived and toiled in them. They altered thoughts and feelings. The chief idea expressed by R. Tanhuma is at once remarkable and surpris ing. All the wars, we are told, which Israel fought in the past will be renewed in the future, all the proud ones will be severely punished, by fire. Then the whole list from the generations of the flood till Edom is repeated. God is not the conditor malorum but the wicked have to thank themselves for their fate. (14) We arrive at the second group of arguments against the divine attributes. Some repetitions and other obscurities must be overlooked. It is difficult to guess what Marcion meant by God "desires the fruitful hill." The objections to God's dwelling in a tabernacle, his fondness for fat and sacrifices, and his pleasure »' v. Gen. 18.27, Ex. 16.7, Ps. 22.7. "8 Gen. 11.4, Ex. S.2, II K. 18.25, Is. 14.14, Ez. 28.2. "» b. plullin 89a, R. Johanan in his name.</page><page sequence="34">174 A. MARMORSTEIN [34] in candles and candlesticks, are often pointed out. They are by no means new, nor have the scribes allowed them to pass with out some defence of their own. The LXX altered the words and expounded the text of II Chron. 6.2, saying: I built a house for thy name, which is ready for thy veneration during all genera tions to come.130 The sanctuary is erected not for God, but for humanity's sake. The philosopher Zeno spoke with the greatest contempt of those, who build sacred edifices for the Godhead. For, how can a building be sacred, which is erected by builders and human labourers?131 Scepticism penetrated into Jewish circles in Palestine, and was by no means limited to the Greek speaking Jews of the Diaspora. Such views find ready ears among Jews as well as non-Jews, in antiquity as well as today. A number of Tannai tes and Amoraim turned their attention to this ques tion. We begin with R. Tarfon, who taught that the presence of the Shekinah in the Tabernacle was a reward for the pious work done by the workmen, a blessing for the work accomplished for heaven's sake.131 The Temple was not built to supply God with an abode, a dwelling-place, but to make Israel worthy of receiving the Shekinah. Just as the teacher in Lydda, so his pupil in Usha devoted thought to this problem. R. Judah b. liai teaches in close agreement with Alexandrinian theology that the tabernacle was erected for Israel's honour, and not for God's need.133 R. Simeon ben Johai was also led by apologetic tendencies when he preached that the building of the tent of appointment was the completion of the world creation. Up till then the whole existence of the world was doubtful. It became firm and well established by the erection of the tabernacle. He surely wanted to convey the idea that the tabernacle was for the sake of the *"נ v. Dâhne, Gesch. Darslellung II 46, v. also I K. 8.53, v. also Jos. Antt. 8.4. '3' Plutarch VI.l, Diog. VII. 33.

Haggadists more frequently recur to this subject. R. Johanan b. Nappaha rather dramatically depicts the surprised and astonished Moses, when he heard the commandments respecting the building of the taber nacle, the sacrifices and the Half Shekel.135 How can God desire an earthly abode, when the heavens, and all the heights cannot contain him? They put here in the mouth of Moses the question which was raised by Marcion and his successors. R. Levi likens the building of the tabernacle and the dwelling of the Shekinah therein to a cave at the shore of the sea. The cave is filled with water, yet the sea does not lack a drop of its contents. God's glory is not diminished by His dwelling in the Temple.136 The Haggadah served, perhaps, in the first instance, the purpose of reconciling the doctrine of God's omnipresence with His dwelling in a certain sacred place. Yet, it also refuted the conception that God needed a dwelling-place. These instances, which can easily be multiplied, will suffice to show heretical influence on the Jews in the third century, and how it was met on the part of the teachers by more or less strong refutations. (15) It can not be in the least surprising that the problem of sacrifices was coupled in R. Johanan's aforecited sermon, or legend with that of the tabernacle. Both are catalogued next to each other in the long list of God's sins. The conception and the laws of sacrifices were a difficult problem for the Rabbinic apolo gists and theologians from more than one point of view. Contem porary philosophy abhorred sacrifices, mocked at their cruel use lessness, and saw in them an abomination of a strange survival of primitive religious aberration. The masses never ceased to adhere to this practice; leaders of thought performed them in spite of their better knowledge and prominent men of affairs, '« R. Joshua ben Levi in his name, Pes. b. 6a, v. also 7a. להקים את המשב! לא נאמר אלא הוקם המשכן, מה הוקם עמו עולם הוקם עמו שעד שלא הוקם המשכן היה העולם רותת .משהוקם המשכן נתבסס העולם "s Pes. b. 20z, Pes. r. 84b, Tan h. נשא.

MARMORSTEIN [36] notwithstanding their disbelief in sacrifices, attended worship and stood in solemn silence or prayer at these ceremonies; yet, gen erally speaking, offerings of this type lost their hold on the large masses! Among the Jews there must have been masses, who were disquieted by this way of religious worship. Yet, the vast majority of the people felt the cessation of sacrifices after the destruction of the Temple, much more deeply than one would be inclined to be lieve. Prominent scribes had to comfort pious souls, who thought themselves lost in their sins, and defiled by impurity without sacrifices! Charity is much greater than sacrifices! Before God, your Father in Heaven, do you cleanse yourselves! He grants your atonement. Study, prayer, good deeds, fasts, etc., are worthy substitutes for them. These theories were advanced, very often repeated and varied, and further developed as answers to ques tions raised by well-meaning as well as taunting people, which deeply moved Jews, and shook the foundations of the whole fabric of Jewish piety. Christians went even a step further. The abolition of sacrifices, piety independent of priests and Temple, sacrifices and cults, encouraged them to claim the abolition of Sabbath, circumcision, dietary law, etc. The Law can be respected and observed without all of them. These theories and problems, and their handling and refutation occupy a considerable space in the Haggadah. They are the background of many teachings and sayings, which can here merely be hinted at. The present paper is chiefly concerned with the gnostic attitude toward sacri fices, and the stand against it taken by the Scribes. The performance of sacrifices ceased with the destruction of the Temple. Whether some sects, or over-zealous Jews still prac tised this mode of religious worship afterwards, or renewed it in later centuries, cannot be established with our present scanty knowledge of the subject. We have no records to decide this point in the affirmative as far as the third century is concerned. Yet, many of the teachers living at that time turned to defend this institution. R. Johanan used a legend for this purpose.137 His friend, R. Simeon ben Lakish must have met, or heard of people who argued from the commandments about the sacrifices that God 137 v. above p. 175.</page><page sequence="37">[37] THE BACKGROUND OF THE HAGGADAH 177 needs food and drink. That is the reason for sacrifices and liba tions. His reply must have been somewhat like this:138 Look at Moses, who stayed with God for 40 days and 40 nights, let him give evidence, whether God needs food! According to a second version, R. Simeon ben Lakish answered: Look at Moses, who is a human being; when he is among you he requires food and drink, yet when he spent those days and nights with me he neither ate nor drank; how could one assert of God that he is in need of food?139 There are several other refutations in the same strain based on Ps. 10.12, denying the same erroneous concep tion.I4° Another, a somewhat younger teacher, R. Judah b. Pazzi, develops and applies an earlier defence to our case.141 God does not require offerings, candles, sanctuaries, food and drink. They were not ordered for his own sake, but for the benefit of humanity, to purify them, to give them opportunities to acquire merits, make them fit for the Shekinah to rest on them, and to draw them near to their father in Heaven.142 Most interesting is the position taken by R. Levi, a great Haggadist of this age. On the one hand, he can not find appropriate words for putting the importance of sacrifices in its proper light. God loves very much indeed Israel's sacrifices;143 they are Israel's benefactors and defenders.144 Yet, on the other hand, he is as well aware as the author of the Pseudo-Clementine works,145 as in later cen turies Maimonides,146 or nowadays any student of the history of religions, that sacrifices were a temporary measure adapted to the needs of Moses' pupils.147 Moses allowed sacrifices as a conces 38" Pes. r. 194a, כי בהר סיני קרבו קרבנותז אלא אסר הקב"ה אם באת ?יהרהר שמא יש אכילה לפני, הרי פשה שעלה להר סיני ועשה אצלי מ' יום דם' לילה יבא משה ויעירני עם יש לפני אכילה. 18י ibid. 184a. 140 ibid. 184a. 141 v. above p. 174. 144 Lev. r. 30.12. 148 Pes. b. 192b. 144 Pes. r. 201b. 148 Rec. of Clem.

MARMORSTEIN [38] sion to people, who were steeped in idolatry and blinded by that form of religious worship in their surroundings. He central ised sacrificial worship, in order to alienate Israel from the idols. With our scanty means it is difficult to establish whether the former or the latter view, expresses the final thought of our great teacher. The latter, surely, sheds greater lustre on his name and memory, according to our way of thinking. One fact, a very important one, it seems to me, can be adduced with certainty from R. Levi's attitude as well as from the sayings of the other teachers, of those who are named here as well as of those not mentioned here by name, that all of them must have heard of voices raised against the sacrifices. More than two hundred years elapsed since the actuality of the whole question passed away, yet their origin, the meaning and the religious influence of these sacrifices was still a matter of lively disputes and antagonistic contentions.148 Why? Because the teaching of God and the place of the Bible in both religions, in that of the Catholic Church as well as in the Jewish Synagogue, went through one of their most dangerous crises. The agreement between R. Levi and the Clemen tines is more than a blind coincidence. R. Levi, on his part, may be more or less indebted to Alexandrian wisdom—his Haggadah as a whole favours such an opinion. The Clementines, on their part again, may not be immune from Palestinian teachings — this suggestion can also be supported. The agreement is, all the same, most striking. The same is the case with R. Judah b. Simon ben Pazzi and the Clementines. Both group together the alleged needs of God in pointing out: tabernacles, sacrifices and light. Could that be accidental, or, is there not more in such a coincidence? The Amora must have faced the same people, against whom the Church Fathers were arrayed on the common battle ground. Naturally, they fight with different tactics and in a different style and language. (16) Tabernacles, Sacrifices and Light! This trio of command ments was a stumbling-block in the eyes of Marcion. The last question of the lights plays a more prominent part in the Rabbinic sources than the previous ones. It will be necessary to enumerate !48 v Marmorstein, The Existence of God, Jewish Forum, Jan. 1924, p. 16-26, and Jeshurun, VII 1920, Nos. 1-4, Expositor, Jan. 1919, p. 104f.</page><page sequence="39">[39] THE BACKGROUND OF THE HAGGADAH 179 here the views and contentions more fully than on the earlier occasions. R. Judah bar liai demonstrates the absurdity of the belief that God needs light. He points out the impossibility of man looking into the sun—a favoured argument in Rabbinic theology—and man would assert that God requires light?149 The lights were ordered for man's sake, to acquire a share in future life. R. Simeon ben Johai saw in the candlesticks, dietary law (clean and unclean beasts), and in the sanctification of the New Moon the three difficulties, which shocked Moses.130 Turning to the Amoraic Haggadah, there is first of all R. Johanan b. Nap paha, who rejects the allegation that God needs light. The candles wanted by the Law cannot be explained just as the faculty of man, or his use of his eyes cannot be fathomed.151 R. Aha154 compares the commandment of the light (Num. 8.2) with Ps. 139.12 (darkness and light are both alike to thee). God, thou art light, thy garments are light, thy servants are beings of light, the whole world enjoys light from thy glory, and thou commandest us to kindle light? What is our light before Thee? Nevertheless I do not, says God, want any but yours. The light is a sign of God's love of them. A similar idea is expressed by R. Berechiah155 and many anonymous preachers!154 In an anony mous homily Dan. 2.22 and Ps. 139.12 are quoted to show that השמש הזה נתון בחיקו (א" ל בנרתיקו) ובתקופת תמוז הוא יוצא 98 Tanh. b.

The reason for this law is, therefore, to be looked for somewhere else, e. g., Is. 42.21. God gave this as well as other laws as an opportunity for Israel to acquire merit.155 Another theory saw the secret of this law in God's endeavour to distinguish Israel before the whole world. The people Israel are so exalted that they were chosen to serve as light-bearers before God.156 R. Abin ha-Levi, in his mystic way of thinking, saw in the sane tuary the source supplying light to the whole world. Light comes from God's House, how can one assert that God needs light? Light is needed by humanity, not by Him, who is Light Himself.157 These sermons and sayings centre around the false allegation: God needs light! That God is, or ought to be, free from want and need, was well known to philosophers and theologians before the Christian Era, therefore, we can well imagine, how Marcion used these passages and laws for his theories, and what impression their ridiculing propaganda made on Jews and Christians alike. For this very reason scribes and teachers in the 2nd and 3rd centuries had to discuss this topic in the pulpit. (17-18) The statements that God dwells in shadow, darkness, storms, and smoke, and comes with trumpets, etc. are directed against Biblical passages which were understood in their literal sense by Marcion and his followers. They really belong in a treatise on the anthropomorphism and anthropopathism in the Haggadah, and will be treated fully in another connection. (19) Owing to Marcion's pacifism and hatred of war Ex. 15.3 and other passages in which God plays the role of a War God, are severely criticised and strongly repudiated. R. Judah b. liai remarks: The chief idea of this verse recurs very frequently in the Scriptures. He quotes six proofs from Psalms, Isaiah and Habakkuk.158 Yet, God does not want all these weapons and 155 Tant- b. IV. 48 להודיעך שכולו אור ואינו צריך לאורה משלך ולפה צויתי אתכם כשביל לזכותכם.

In one of them there is an unmistakable reference to Gnostics, who speak of two powers, i. e., the God of war, and the other God, who revealed the Decalogue. Both are the same. Preachers took the oppor tunity to emphasize God's might, unchangeability, love, and providence.160 Special attention has to be called to the form of these theological doctrines, which could be called Tannai tic Antitheses. (20) Finally, we turn to Marcion's twice repeated thesis that God loves the wicked, adulterers, and murderers, and chooses evil men. A commentary to these words is offered by the writer of the Clementine homilies and by Marcion himself. Peter161 denies that Adam was a transgressor, Noah drunken, that Abraham lived with three wives at once, and Jacob associated with four, that Moses was a murderer. There can be no doubt that these "sins of the saints," which go back to the letter of the Bible, reecho the Antitheses of Marcion and the Syllogisms of Appelles in 38 books, all lost. In such a company the robber Joshua, the impious Lot and his daughters, the adulterers David and Solomon, could not be missed. It seems to me that an anonymous teacher, whose date I am unable to fix, knew of both: the sharp attack against the Scrip ture, and the clumsy denial of the latter. He makes God say:162 Adam is a thief, Noah a drunkard, Abraham a stranger, Isaac loved God's enemies, Jacob is the right man. The sins of Abraham and Jacob, their polygamy, plays a considerable part in Jewish apologetics of the first three centuries. R. Judah b. liai and R. Nehemiah, who as our previous observations will confirm, must have had more intimate knowledge of Bible criticism, than they are generally credited with, both take great pains to identify «» Mek. 37b, MRSbJ 61 without the name of the Tanna. !60 MRSbJ p. 66 has a fuller list of these Antitheses than Mek. 37b, some of them also MRSbJ p. 61. Both are derived from an older collection, which was probably still known to the preachers of the Amoraic period. 161II. 52. 16נ Tanlj. b. Ill 72f. v.

Moses did not murder the Egyptians with ordinary weapons, but by pronouncing the Divine Name.164 Even Lot's and his daughters' deed found apologists in the Synagogue as well as in the Church.165 David as well as Solomon have had to bear the brunt of attack and blame for their sins and iniquities, which fill many pages of haggadic literature. The biographies of saints and the wicked of the Bible, as depicted and illuminated by the teachers of the Haggadah, must be investigated under this point of view. This can be done under the light thrown on them by Gnostics on one side, Church Fathers on the other side. We are, here, concerned with the background furnished by the former. Such investigations would reveal clearly the religious and intel lectual conditions in the period in which our material was first used. V These studies essay to illuminate the background of the Haggadah. The latter represents a whole world of thoughts and beliefs, some of them ephemeral, others eternal, standing and changing through the tempest of centuries. Original thoughts, borrowed ideas, mystic and magic observances, strange rites, religious development and decay, are put together, sometimes without stops and breaks. The external form corresponds to the inner contents. There are proper rhetorical rules in some, no order in others, similies and phrases familiar to the unlearned with sayings and forms of speech derived from the Academy and Stoa, learned anecdotes and popular proverbs next to each other. 16נ Gen. r. 61.4. !64 v.

We are concerned mainly with the latter point. Our inquiry arises out of curiosity. How far did a mind like Marcion's influence Judaism? Our material leaves no doubt that the great teachers of the 2nd and 3rd centuries faced people, who, more or less, were under the spell of the Marcionite way of thinking. They were the Minim, who, either entirely or partly, severed their connections with the Synagogue. Socially or economically, they could not be sepa rated from members of the community, or from their own family. Teachers and preachers used to have disputes or discussions with them. Some of these took rather an unfriendly shape, e. g. in the case of R. Meir, or in that of R. Joshua ben Levi. Considering the nature of their questions and their attitude towards Jews, one cannot, in the Minim of the early time (up to the 3rd cent.) and in special places where Christians were not to be found at all, see Christians (Jewish or Gentile). Jews, who were imbued with Gnostic doctrines, are known by the name of Minim. Most, if not all of the teachers mentioned in the previous pages, came into contact with people, who inclined to the way of the Minim. About thirty Tannaites and Amoraim named in the previous chapters supply a part of the problems, which agitated the minds of Minim and Scribes. Their list could be greatly enlarged. Yet, our purpose, to show Marcionite influence and to recognize a part of the Haggadic background can be better demonstrated by investigating the anonymous Haggadah, and the teachings of the Haggadists whose names became familiar to us in our present investigation. This leads us to point out a second aspect of the Haggadah, which has, according to my knowledge, not yet been fully investigated. VI DIATRIBE AND HAGGADA (1) The Greek word διατριβή has many meanings. In rheto ric it signifies an "occasion for dwelling on a subject" (Arist. Rhet. 3.17). The addresses and speeches of Cynics and Stoics</page><page sequence="44">184 A. MARMORSTEIN [44] developed the diatribe into an art. The best representatives of those schools used it in speech and written word. In reading E. Norden's, Die Antike K-unstprosa (2 vol. Leipzig 1895) I was struck by the new light, which the investigations of that scholar throw on the style of the Haggadah. This impression became even greater in studying Rudolf Bultmann's: Der Stil der paulin ischen Briefeischen Briefeischen Briefe und die Kynisch-Stoische Diatribe (Gôttingen, 1910). It amounts almost to a platitude to emphasize the fact that the inner content of a literary work cannot be properly understood without understanding its external form. Still, in our studies and researches up till now, the latter has been more or less neglected. It is customary to ignore or to deny style, form and beauty in the literary productions of the scribes, in their homilies and sermons, their parables and similies, their thoughts or teachings. The inner meaning is the chief thing, the external form is of no consequence. The history and the state of preservation of our literature, which is partly fragmentary, and partly sketchy, apparently confirms such a belief. This, however, is an erroneous view! The Haggadah has a style of its own, worth studying. The preachers and teachers, whose immortal names are entombed in the Haggadah of the two Talmuds and the Midrashim, devel oped a homiletical style, which is not much behind that of the masters of oratory in Latin and Greek. We are told, frequently, that educated and intellectual circles among the heathens of the first centuries, looked somewhat commiseratively on the barbar ism of the Gospels. Learned and wise pagans treated rather with contumely the sacred writings of Early Christianity. This is not surprising at all. The Gospels in Greek must have struck them, as far as style and language go, as strange, or foreign to their literary taste. I am not aware of having read anything similar of the Hebrew Bible. The Haggadah, properly searched and studied, offers a lucid object-lesson in the similarities between the style of the diatribe and the homilies of the Scribe. It is too premature at the present stage of our knowledge to decide the question, whether, or how far the Rabbinic preachers actually were indebted to the diatribe of Stoics and Cynics. This question will have to be answered, one way or another. Really, it is part and parcel of a much larger, and more important</page><page sequence="45">[45] THE BACKGROUND OF THE HAGGADAH 185 problem, which has to be tackled, and answered either in the af firmative, or in the negative. I mean, the traces of external, secular knowledge possessed by the Scribes, their relation to Greek wisdom and science. Apart from the comparative point of view, the study of the haggadic style opens many new aspects of the inner mean ing of some otherwise obscure sayings and sentences, forms and ways of our homilies. These enable us to listen to the living voice of the ages, to objections raised to teachings and legends, to criticisms made against exegesis and theology expounded from the pulpit, to abuse and ridicule heaped on the religion and his tory of the Jews by heathens and Christians, by believers and unbelievers, by masters and pupils. Being aware of the form of speech, we are enabled to revive many a long-forgotten historical fact, and reconstruct some intellectual movements, which are otherwise lost in the deep sea of the ages passed. Scientific research of the ancient documents of our literature cannot forego the investigation of the external forms of the material at our disposal. (2) One of the most usual forms of the diatribe is to intro duce dialogues between two parties in a speech. The speaker, or writer, steps into the background, he develops his own ideas by constructing a dialogue, between two, or more, different persons. The dialogue in the Haggadah has not been studied under this point of view. Its part and importance in Jewish theology and apologetics has not yet been pointed out, as was done in Chris tian theology and apologetics, where learned works are at the students' disposal. It cannot be done in this short essay. Yet, two or three facts should here be pointed out. First of all the dialogues between God and the Keneset Israel (כנסת ישראל). Some instances will suffice for it. Illustration: R. Johanan b. Nappaha depicts in a parable a king who had in his service two ill-famed quaestors. These were made use of by him if he wanted to chastise a rebellious province. Once a province became rest less. The king dispatched one of them to this place. When the people heard this, they entreated him: Whatsoever you want to do in order to punish us, do, yet save us from the presence of this man! Israel says similarly before God: Lord of the Universe! Rebuke me not in thine anger neither chasten me in thy wrath (Ps. 6.2). God replies: What is mine anger, and my wrath for?</page><page sequence="46">186 A. MARMORSTEIN [46] Israel says: Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen (ibid. 69.6). God accepts their words, and acts accordingly, saying: And I will act in anger and fury against the heathen (Micah 5.14), but not against Israel (cf. Hosea 11.10).* This instance, by the way, shows another characteristic fea ture of the diatribe: It was customary to put in the mouth of the arguing parties quotations from Homer, or other well-known authors, poets or philosophers. The preacher, Jewish or Chris tian, borrowed from the Bible. Our second instance will show this even more clearly. It is a dialogue between Israel and God, or the Holy Spirit.* The dialogue consists of six3 parts. Israel quotes one passage, the Holy Spirit replies with another from the Scriptures. The dialogue reads as follows : I.I. Israel says: There is none like God. Holy Spirit: Jeshurun is like God (Deut. 33.26). II. Israel: Who is like thee among the gods, O Lord? (Ex. 15.11). Holy Spirit: Happy art thou, Israel, who is like thee (Deut. 33.29). III. Israel: Hear O Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is one (Deut. 6.4). Holy Spirit : Who is like thy people Israel, a unique nation on the earth? (I Chr. 17.21). IV. Israel : Like the apple tree among the trees of the forest, so is my beloved among the sons (Cant. 2.3). Holy Spirit : Like the lily among the thorns, is my beloved among the daughters (ibid. 2.2). V. Israel: This is my God, I will exalt him (Ex. 15.2). Holy Spirit:Holy Spirit: This people I have created unto me. (Is43.21). VI. Israel: For thou art the glory of his might (Ps. 88.18). Holy Spirit: Israel through thee I am glorified (Is. 9.3).4 1 M.

At present they look to the reader as mere quotations of select gems from Pentateuch, Prophets and Psalms, which lack the key to open their secret and connection. No doubt the most sublime theological doctrines of the preacher's age were derived from, or put into these words, and surely expounded at length by the orator on that occasion. The Unity, the Incomparability, the Uniqueness both of God and Israel, the relation between God and Israel, the mutual choice of both, were the themes expounded, as pointed out in another place.5 The introduction and the pero ration are unfortunately missing, or perhaps, misplaced, there fore the actual theme cannot be with certainty established, merely guessed. For our purpose it is enough to recognize that the preachers knew and used this method of the Diatribe. In some cases, the speech, prayer, or request of the Keneset Israel is preserved, the reply of God either originally omitted, or lost through the copyists of our ancient Midrashim. R. Jose b. R. Hanina, one of the most eloquent preachers of the third century in Tiberias, whose life and teaching deserve a good monograph, dealt with Ps. 140.1 in one of his homilies. The Keneset Israel says before God: Lord of the Universe! The nations of the world spread out a net before me in order to catch me! They say : Worship idols! If I listen to them, I am condemned by thy law, if I do not obey, then they slay me. I am like a thirsty wolf, who stands before the well with a snare, saying: If I descend to drink, I will be caught by the snare, if not, I shall die of thirst.6 There we have the address of Israel; the answer of God is not reported. The preacher was satisfied with describ ing the feeling of his hearers, who passed through some persecu tions. The same preacher offers another instance,7 which for style and contents deserves more attention than it has received before. He delivered a sermon, in which we are told that Moses 5 v.

MARMORSTEIN [48] decreed four decrees, which have been abolished by four prophets. The sayings of Moses are: (1) Deut. 33.28; (2) Deut. 28.65; (3) Exod. 20.5; and (4) Lev. 26.38. They were annulled by Amos 7.5-6, Jeremiah 31.1, Ezekiel 18.4, and Isaiah 27.13. This preacher did not fear to state that the prophets ob jected to, or, even abolished the words of the father of the prophets. The homily, which may have been delivered on a New Year's Day (cf. the passage from Jeremiah and from Isaiah) reveals the problems agitating the mind of Galilean Jews in that period, viz. the question of assimilation, the relation of Jews to the outside world, the sins of the fathers being visited on their children, and Israel's very existence. These questions, which trouble us, children of the twentieth century, so greatly in all countries of our dispersion, were alive and pressing in Tiberias, in the third century. In order to develop this theme, or these themes, the preacher put his arguments into the mouth of Moses and the prophets. The attitude of the preacher is not clearly and distinctly stated. We do not gather from his words on this occa sion, whether he favoured the point of view of Moses, and con demned the others, or vice versa. Other homilies of his throw some light on his views.8 (3) Another type of the diatribe is presented in Haggadahs which comprise dialogues between Biblical personages, heroes of antiquity, saints and sages on one side, and God on the other side. Just as in the Cynic-Stoic Diatribe heroes of poetry and mythology, e. g., Odysseus or Heracles are introduced as defend ers or propagators of philosophical ideas and ethical norms,' so in their dialogues the "Fathers of the World,"10 prophets and kings teach or admonish, defend or accuse, rebuke or praise their contemporaries before God. Here also a few instances convey an idea of the similarity between the Haggadists and ancient rhetors as to their respective application of the Diatribe. The 8 v.

Nahmani. He depicts Moses as writing the Torah, especially the story of the daily creation. When he arrived at Gen. 1.26 (let us make man), Moses exclaimed: Lord of the Universe! Wherefore dost thou give an opening of mouth (occasion) to the Minim? i. e., to assert that there were two powers assisting at the creation of man. God replies: Write, and he who likes to err, let him blunder." God said: What about the man, whom I created? Does he not pro duce big and small ones? Now, if the former should ask permission of the latter, will they not say : Why should socially higher stand ing people ask permission of lower ones? Well, let him learn from his Creator, who created the upper and lower ones, and yet at the creation of man, he consulted his ministering angels." Gen. 1.26 gave rise to one of the thorniest questions of ancient Jewish Apologetics, and was properly misused, first by Gnostics, after wards by Christians to prove the truth of their respective theories from the Bible of the Jews.13 Sometimes the dialogue represents a free, dramatized élabora tion of the Bible narrative. R. Levi has a homily on Gen. 8.25. Abraham said: If thou desirest the world, there is no strict judgment, if judgment, there is no world. Thou holdest the rope by both ends,14 thou desirest both, world and judgment. The world cannot exist with the strict measure of judgment, without forgiveness. God replies: Abraham: thou lovest righteousness, hatest wickedness, therefore, has thy God anointed thee (Ps. 45.8). From Noah till thy time ten generations perished, and to none of them did I speak, except to you.15 11 One would be inclined to read איל הקביה, כתוב, אמר משה, הרוצה לטעות יטעה, instead of א"ל כתוב, והרוצה לטעות יטעה.

MARMORSTEIN [50] (4) Among the manifold subjects dealt with by preachers, the most popular and appropriate to impress public opinion, was the national catastrophe, and the religious consequences of the destruction of the Temple. The choice of homiletical subjects was as difficult then, as it is now. Even the best preachers experi enced some disappointments. Special days were set apart for the commemoration of that sad historic event, which marked such a great change in the course of Jewish history. R. Samuel b. Nah mani depicted in a rather lengthy homily the scene of the destruc tion of the Temple. The homily belongs to the form of Diatribe described in the previous paragraph. There are, however, two features, which have to be pointed out especially. This Haggadah shows that sometimes more than two persons take part in the discussion. Abraham appears tearing his beard, plucking his hair, smiting his face, rending his garments, with ashes on his head, lamenting and crying amidst the ruins of the destroyed Temple. He says, rather asks God: Why am I different from all other languages and nations? Why has this shame and disgrace fallen to my lot? There intervene the angels, who endorse his lament by binding laments lines by lines,16 and expounding Is. 33.8. The paths and roads leading to Jerusalem, established for pious pil grims, are desolate. The pilgrimages have ceased; the covenant of Abraham is abolished, Jerusalem and Zion are despised, Israel is treated worse than the idolators, the generation of Enosh.17 God appears thereupon asking for the reason for all these lamen tations. The angels take it upon themselves to reply: Abraham, thy friend, came to the ruins of thy house, and thou dost not regard him whatsoever! God replies: Since he departed unto the House of Eternity (בית עולמו, i. e., grave, or cemetery), he did not appear in my house, and now, what has my friend to do in my house? (Jer. 11.13). Abraham lifts up his voice, and says: Lord of the Universe! Why hast thou exiled my children? Why 16 The term קשר הספד occurs also pal. Yoma 1.1, Sotah 1.10, Jeb. 16.4, Tos. Jeb. ed.

Why hast thou destroyed thy sanctuary, where I brought my son Isaac, the father of the nation, as a burnt offering.18 God says: Because they have transgressed the Torah, and the 22 letters in her! So far goes the first part.'9 The second part of this homily leads to another form of the Diatribe. I mean the method which is known as Personification.20 Abstract conceptions and qualities, like truth, virtue, loving kindness, charity, or the reverse are introduced into the speech as arguing, defending, contradicting, or confirming the speaker's statement. Here, as so often in the Haggadah, the Torah steps forward to plead against Israel. Abraham addresses the Torah, calling her: My daughter! Thou comest to testify against Israel, that they are guilty of transgressing the Law? Dost thou not feel ashamed before me? Remember the day, when God offered his Torah to all the nations, and they refused to receive his Law. No nation wanted to accept thee except Israel before Mt. Sinai!21 Thereupon the Torah departs. Then appear one by one the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet as witnesses, and are put to shame by Abraham. Our text has only the first three letters, each stand ing for one abstract idea, offended by Israel. Originally all the 22 letters were represented. Later the text was shortened for obvious reasons. The rest of the homily, which has nearly the character of a legend, contains several speeches delivered by Isaac, Jacob and Moses, the last quoting elegies in Aramaic, and a dialogue between Moses and the sun, concluding with an address by Rachel to God, who responds. (5) The Haggadah preserved furthermore another significant feature of the Diatribe, which is shorter than the dialogues men tioned in the previous paragraphs, but all the same manifests characteristics of the dialogue. The homilists interrupt their dis course, or begin the same with an alleged or a real objection to their theme or the Bible by some opponent. The first class of 18 v. Gen. r. 55.9. ,י Midr. Lam. ed.

The preacher develops an idea, and in the course of his sermon, he considers: "but, if someone tells you," "so reply to him." Many times the homilist begins his exposi tion: כל מי שאומר "whosoever says so and so." Thirdly, the audience is reminded of a fact שלא יאמרו "in order that people should not say," etc. A fourth group has תשובה למי שאומר "a reply to those, who say, etc." The name, or character of the objector is omitted, yet in many cases, either the פושעי ,מינים ישראל or אומות העולם are mentioned as real, or possible critics. Here belong further the sayings introduced by שלא ליתן פתחון פה in order not to give an opening of mouth, i. e. occasion, or opportunity to the nations of the world, Minim (Gnostics) or Christians to say, etc. Finally, one comes across the phrase אל תתמה "do not wonder," especially after legends and stories which tax even the simplest mind to an extraordinary degree. I will give a few instances for each of these diatribic forms, especially bearing in mind the relation between Minim and Scribes. (a) The first, אם יאמר לך אדם, is to be found as early as the middle of the second century in the Haggadah of the Tannaim, R. Judah b. liai and R. Nehemiah. Both of them, as shown in the first part of this paper, must have taken a prominent part in the fight against gnostic speculations and Bible criticism.22 Here23 we are concerned with their expositions of Eccl. 3.15. Ecclesiastes teaches that that which has been is now, and that which is to be, has already been. Some sceptic objected to the first as well as to the second clause of the saying: אם יאמר לך אדם שאלו לא חטא אדם הראשון ואכל מאותו העץ היה חי וקיים לעולם : "if Adam had not sinned and tasted of ,that tree, he could have lived for ever." Koheleth says: Which has been is now. Sup posing Adam had not sinned, would he be alive? Further, אם יאמר לך אדם שהקב"ה עתיד להחיות לנו מתים: "God will in future revive the dead," consequently, there will be something new, 2222 v. above pp. 160, 163, 181. 2323 Lev. r. 27.4, Pes.

The reply is: Tell him (אמור לו), the first question can be met by Elijah, who is still alive, the second by the deeds of Elijah, Elisha and Ezekiel. R. Nehemiah puts forth other questions of a similar type : אם יאמר לך אדם אפשר שהיה העולם כולו מים במים? אמור לו כבר הוא אוקיינוס כולו מים במים ; ואם יאמר לך אדם שהקב"ה עתיד לעשות את הים יבשה אמור לו כבר היה לא כך עשה על ידי משה. The first part of the verse is attacked by one, who doubts the teaching that the world was "water in water," the second by one who asks: will there be a time, when the sea will become dry land? Otherwise how could Koheleth assert; "that which is to be, has already been?" The teacher reminds one first of the ocean, then of the crossing of the Red Sea. It is quite probable, that the objections affected more Rabbinic lore than Ecclesiastes' wisdom. Could Adam have lived for ever, if he had not sinned? Does Koheleth not deny the belief in resurrection? How can Rabbinic cosmology and escha tology be reconciled with the teachings of Koheleth? The objec tors thought of, must have been Gnostics, who found the greatest pleasure in finding faults in the Bible. The teachers are contem poraries of Marcion, whose influence reached those who visited the Synagogues. Due to gnostic agitation, we hear from this period onwards, the teaching: Whatsoever God will create in the future,future, has its counterpart in the pastd4 Yet, there is another possi bility! May be that pious souls could not yet acquiesce in the canonicity of Ecclesiastes. There might have been a set of Jews, reacting against the gnostic movements, who repeated old, or invented new objections to Ecclesiastes, and agitated for the removal of this book from the Canon. Some traces of such an agitation are still to be discerned in our texts. But, even such activity was under gnostic cross-currents, as we see Minim tack ling the same questions in the third century.25 R. Simeon ben Lakish delivered a sermon on Ps. 60.9, "Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; Ephraim is also the strength of *4 The doctrine is ascribed to R. Halafta (Lev. r.), R .Eleazar b.

God says: (1) If a man tells you, God will not revive the dead, point out the case of Elijah, who comes from Gilead, and revived the dead son of the Zarfith. (2) If a man tells you that God does not receive those who repent, point out Manasseh, who was a king of Judah. (3) If a man tells you that God does not help the barren women, point out the wife of Elkanah, who came from Ephraim. (4) If a man tells you that God does not save from fire (or according to a second version, from wild beasts), point out the three young men, or Daniel, who came from Judah. (5) If a man tells you that God does not heal lepers, refer him to the instance of Moab (or, according to another version, that God does not save from water, point out Moses, who was drawn from the water). (6) If a man tells you that God cannot redeem the weak from the hand of the strong without sword and spear, let David come and testify against him. Tabulating these six different objections and questions, ac cording to the names of the teachers, we learn first of all that there are themes or questions common to all of them, secondly we may be able to establish the connection existing between them, and finally learn the development of these heresies. The first rubric (RJ) represents the questions mentioned by R. Judah ben liai, the second (RN), the third (RSbN), and the fourth (RSbL) by R. Nehemiah, R. Samuel b. Nahmani, and R. Simeon b.

They opposed doctrines accepted and believed by the average Jew in the third century. Even Christians and pagans concurred in such beliefs. On the whole, the term אם יאמר לך אדם-אמור לו is not rare in the Tannaitic Haggadah, yet frequent in the Amoraic teach ings. In the paragraph treating the argument of God testing people, we used an anonymous Haggadah,26 where this term occurs; yet in another source another form of the Diatribe is substituted, namely: 27.שלא ליתן פתחון פה Interesting is another homily, based on Ps. 60.9,28 which repeats objections to Elijah, Gideon, David, and Joshua, who committed some act or other, breaking the commandments of the Law. Elijah built an altar on Mt. Carmel, and brought sacri fices thereon, in spite of the fact that there was a Sanctuary at that time. Such an action was against Lev. 17.3-4. Gideon did a similar thing, offering sacrifices on the high places, whilst the Temple in Shiloh was in existence. David sinned against the Law, and Joshua broke the Sabbath observance before Jericho. All of them, was the reply, acted on God's command (על פי הגבורה), and for His sake. David's case is interpreted as a special example to sinners to repent, since the gates of repentance are always open. The latter is a connecting link between No. 2 in R. Simeon ben Lakish's list and this present diatribe. Here, we can avail ourselves of material outside our own literature to identify the alleged objectors of the preacher. Early writings of the Church refer to Joshua as a proof for the mutability of the Law,29 yet I have shown that Marcion and his followers raised the same questions from their own point of view. The diatribe form is more usual in the Amoraic Haggadah. Yet, it would not be safe to jump to the conclusion that it is a sign of the latter Haggadah. Such a question cannot be finally 26 v. above p. 155. Gen. r. ch. 55.1, ed. Theodor 584-585. 37 Tanlj. B. I. 58a. 38 Num. r. 14.5, Tanb. B. IV.41. 39 v. above p. 161.</page><page sequence="56">196 A. MARMORSTEIN [56] settled in the course of a brief essay, such as the present one, since it necessitates a display of the whole material, for which there is no room here. We find this term in the Haggadah of the following Amorairn: R. Joshua ben Levi, R. Jose ben Zimra, R. Hanina b. Hama, R. Isaac, R. Levi, R. Abbahu, R. IJiyya b. Abba, R. Huna, R. Jose b. Abin, R. Abba Serungaya, besides those mentioned previously. Three instances taken from the anonymous Haggadah shall, for the present, conclude this part of our investigation, they relate to three different subjects, and may be used to reflect different aspects of the intellectual, political and religious conditions of the first centuries. The canonicity of some portions of the Hebrew Bible, the relation of the Torah to worldly wisdom, or the Torah of Early Christianity, and finally the shattered hopes of the Jews in the period after Emperor Julian's death shall be discussed in the following lines. (A) "God made his covenant with Israel for the sake of the Torah." One should not say (שלא יאמר אדם) : The Psalms are not Torah." No, they are Torah, so are also the Books of the Prophets, and not only the Psalms but also the Riddles and Parables.30 The text is unfortunately in a bad condition. This is the more to be regretted, since a very grave and far-reaching subject is touched by the homilist. It presupposes an opposition from some unknown quarter to a part of the established Canon of the Bible. The date is also of great importance. If we might trust the Yalkut,31 we could ascribe the homily to R. Samuel b. Nahmani, which is not impossible. Another source32 renders this information in the form of a dialogue between Israel and the singer Assaf. Israel says: Is there another Torah? Asaph: The פושעי ישראל assert that the Prophets and Hagiographa are not included in the Torah, and they do not believe in them. A similar assertion is repeated in a Piska for the Pentecost, dis covered and published by the present writer, where we read: In order that ye shall not say: God gave Israel the Torah (but 3° M. Ps. ed. Buber p. 344. 3־ Ps. § 819. 3a Tant• B. V. 19, v. Marmorstein, Religionsgesch. Studien I 33, and in the essay given in the next footnote.</page><page sequence="57">[57] THE BACKGROUND OF THE HAGGADAH 197 not Nebi'im and Ketubim).33 Who are these enemies of the two latter orders of the Bible? Christians are excluded at the outset. Prophets and Hagiographa were as sacred to them as to the majority of the Jews. We may mention Samaritans, or Sadducees, who are reputed to have rejected both Prophets and Hagiographa, yet it is unlikely that at this stage of separation from the people of Nablus, or after Sadducees have lost all their influence, or power, this should be the subject of homilies. Some Sadducees may have survived in some corners of Galilee, or may have amal gamated with Minim of different sorts, against whom the homily is directed. (B) A homily on Lam. 2.9b (Her king and her princes are among the Gentiles, there is no Torah)34 begins: If one tells you there is wisdom among the nations, believe him (Ob. 1.8), yet, if he tells you, there is Torah among them, do not believe him. A fuller version35 of this homily is to be found in a Midrash on Deut eronomy. It is not hidden from thee (Deut. 30.11), but it is hidden from the nations of the world. If one tells thee that there are heroes and wealthy people among the nations of the world believe him, but that there is Torah among them, do not believe him. This Homily reflects Christian views. Christians claimed the Scriptures as their inheritance, and accused the Jews of forgeries. The preachers of the Synagogues declared that in spite of Tertullian, Clement of Alexandria, Origen, and others there is no Torah among the Gentiles. (C) This is a reply to those, who say: "It is true that God said : 'I build a sanctuary!', and he built the same, but ye sinned, and he destroyed, and will rebuild it no more!" The refutation is based on the future in the verbs ישכון and ויתלונן (Job 39. 28).36 The taunting voice must have come from Christian circles, who ridiculed the hopes of the Jews, or put obstacles in the way of their attempts at rebuilding the Sanctuary in Jerusalem. The scene meets many historical situations from 68 C. E. till the time 33 v.

It is not unlikely that this Haggadah voices the views of Julian's enemies, their joy at the failure of the hopes of the Jews, and their bitter disappointment. Julian's relation to the Jews are shown in his letters to them, in which the promise to rebuild the Temple is plainly expressed.37 Our homily reflects the feeling among Jews after the death of the Emperor. (b) A second group is that of sayings and sentences intro duced by כל האומר, "anyone who says," or כל מי שאומר, "whosoever says." There is a long catalogue of persons, e. g., the sons of Eli, of Samuel, David, Josiah, and Solomon, who are sup posed to have erred and committed sins. All who say, these persons, or one of them transgressed the Law, is mistaken.38 Similar sentences are reported about the Queen of Sheba,39 and Manasseh, King of Judah.40 The first group is by R. Jonathan ben Eleazar, whom we know as greatly interested in heretical views. He defended also Reuben's deed, yet this apology is much older. R. Eliezer ben Hyrkanus, R. Joshua ben Hananiah, R. Ele azarazar of Modi'im, R. Simeon ben Eleazer, and R. Simeon ben Gamali el, preachers of the Tannaitic age, already found it necessary to deal with this point from the pulpit.41 Bearing in mind Marcion's Antithesis about God's favouring the wicked, and condemning the good, we have somewhere to look for an explanation of Jonathan's endeavours to justify, or to defend the errors of these persons. The same preacher goes for those people, who think that the Queen of Sheba was a woman. The Queen is not meant at all, but the Kingdom of Sheba. The defence of Manasseh is ascribed to R. Johanan. Since the names of these two teachers are very often confused, is it too daring to assume that here also R. Jonathan is the original reading, instead of R. Johanan? "Whosoever asserts that Manasseh has no share in future life, weakens the hands (מרפה ידיהן) of those who desire to repent!" We saw a few pages earlier that preachers had to combat a false doctrine of Minim, who taught that there is no repentance, God 37 v. Graetz, Geschichte IV. 338, and note 34 ibid. 38 b. Sabb.

Due to this greatly damaging conception, the scribes went to the other extreme, and taught that there is no transgression or iniquity, not even excepting the cardinal sins of idolatry, bloodshed and immorality, which, where forgiveness is proper, is not forgiven.42 Only one of the Scribes, R. Haninah b. Hama thought it necessary to contradict such leniency as misleading.43 God's forgiveness and goodness must not be misinterpreted. "Whosoever proclaims that God is too for giving, let his inside be pierced. God is merciful, but he gets his due." Both teachers must have been induced to teach thus by the views of Marcion who denied God's mercy and love. The teaching can be traced back to Sirach, who faced a similar atti tude towards sins many centuries before our period.44 Then, as now, people denied God's goodness, or the possibility of repen tance, on one side, and on the other side thought that God's forgiveness has to be limited. The contemporaries of Sirach aired exactly the same views as the Jews in the third century C. E. against whom R. Haninah b. Hama protested. God is full of forgiveness, consequently, we may sin as much as we like to. We trust in his goodness, and may heap iniquity upon iniquity. His mercy is unlimited. Sirach tells them: Do not say so! His mercy and anger go together! The Mishna Yoma45 may have thought of Sirach's contemporaries, who said, "Iwill sin, and repent!" or "I will sin, and the Day of Atonement will bring forgiveness!" In the third century the Meturgeman of R. Simeon b. Lakish, R. Judah b. Nahmani, preached, "If the Yezer ha-Ra' tells thee: 'Sin, and God will forgive thee!' do not believe him!"46 44 Tanlj. f.26a, Lev. r. 23,9, R.

One instance has been mentioned above.47 These sayings allow us a deeper insight into the thoughts and feelings of both parties. A homily on Job 41.4 teaches: God said: In order that children of man should not say (שלא יאמרו בני אדם): "We may also speak to God, as Abraham spoke, and he kept silent!" God replies: "I will not keep silent, although I kept silent unto Abraham."48 The same homilist makes Abraham say before God: Lord of the Universe! Far be it from thee, etc., in order that people should not say (שלא יאמרו באי עולם) : "That is his way, he destroys the generations in cruelty. He destroyed the generations of Enoch, of the Flood, of the Dispersion, he cannot leave off his way!" We now know the background of this saying of the באי עולם• It was made clear above that this argument is actually copied from Marcion's storehouse of arguments against the "cruel" God.49 It is naturally unlikely that the preachers invented such words about a defeated or cruel God of their own. They introduced them from speeches delivered, or writings compiled by Gnostics. Rhetoricians in the squares of the cities, or in assemblies argued and were listened to by Christians and Jews, Gnostics and pagans. The orators of the Synagogues were bound to pay the closest attention to these opinions of the market philosophers, and dispel their mischievous influence. Another example shall illustrate this: R. Judah b. Simon, a well-known Haggadist of the fourth century, asserts that besides Moses and Aaron, God himself took an active part in the numbering of Israel in the wilderness. Why did God join with Moses and Aaron to count them? God said: "In order that one should not say, 'How could Moses and Aaron correctly count the crowds of Israel?' " Therefore, he who doubts the numberings of Moses and Aaron is to be considered as if he criticized God Almighty!50 We have other, and earlier evidence that the numbers in the *ז v. p. 196. «8 Tanlj.

Jacob was saved owing to his own work, and not through the merit of the fathers in his contest with Laban. We derive hence the teaching that a man should not say: "I will eat and drink, and see good, but I will not toil, for Heaven will provide for me!"52 This saying can be combined with another by Ulla, in the name of R. Hiyya b. Ammi, who teaches: Greater is he who earns his own living than he who fears Heaven.55 How short do these views fall compared with the preaching of R. Eleazar of Modi'im : "He who says, 'what will I eat tomorrow' is one of those who have little faith in Heaven."54 The change of attitude towards this problem between the teacher of Modi'im and the preachers of the third century seems to me most remarkable! (d) A fourth diatribic form in the Haggadah applies the term: תשובה למי שאומר or למי שאומרים connecting the reply with the alleged interruption of the interlocutor. We quoted above an instance,55 which probably opened a new source for the his tory of the Jews after the age of Emperor Julian. An earlier passage uses this form to refute the views of heretics, who deny the existence of the heavenly kingdom, who allege the existence of two powers, and who teach, that God can neither revive, nor is death in his power, he could perform neither good, nor evil.56 Atheists, Dualists and Epicureans stand in the background of this Haggadah. We come across the same term in a refutation of the Christian dogma, teaching the idea of God's son.57 This apology, or polemic utterance is not earlier than the fourth century. (e) We turn now to arguments, allegations, accusations and libels, which are repeated in Rabbinic homilies in the name of a whole set or group of people.

MARMORSTEIN [62] mous interlocutors, whose words or views were quoted by homi lists, without disclosing names, characters, origins, or positions of the respective persons. Some parallels, or sometimes the con tents, clearly point to the source whence they came. Here we consider, first of all, sayings ascribed to the nations of the world, introduced by ארה מונים or ארה אומרים or שלא יאמרו ארה. These sayings cover the whole ground of anti-Jewish polemics of the first four centuries, and reveal the darkest background of Rabbinic Apologetics. The polemical interlocutions touch Israel's relation to God, Israel's past, present and future, Israel's belief and Bible, character and achievements. Some of these calumnies and shortcomings, faults and blasphemies lived a miserable existence for more than a millenium in word and script, and are heard up to this hour of writing in the literature of the gutter and the press of the mire. No wonder! They origi nated there, in the ale-houses of Alexandria, in the dens of wretched, vainglorious humbugs, in the defiled hearts of philo sophic charlatans, who successfully bamboozled their stupid con temporaries with second-rate stunts and slogans. Pious Church Fathers were infected and used those hateful words in the mis guided campaign against the sanctity of the Synagogue. Other attacks were illegitimately born under the shadow of narrow and petty pulpits of the Ancient Church. Some are the wild fruits of the bitter struggle between Early Christianity and Judaism, written with the poisonous quills of prejudice by men, whose professed task it was to spread love and benevolence. It would have been less than human, if some of the Scribes had not paid back their arch-enemies with the very same coin. The anti Jewish polemical literature produced such networks of falsehood and tissues of the most abominable, humiliating accusations that one could not be surprised at the history of that most disgraceful historical appearance, called in want of a better name, Anti semitism. The limited space at our disposal here, does not permit a full description of this awful fight, which may be regarded as one of the most tragic chapters of the history of human intellect. But merely the brief items can be pointed out, which are grouped together under the diatribic form: ארה אומרים. God, or the</page><page sequence="63">[63] THE BACKGROUND OF THE HAGGADAH 203 God of Israel, was depicted as cruel, and weak. The pagan mind was not so much concerned about God, whom they somehow could tolerate or ignore, although the Scribes assert that the nations of the world hate God. This very fact was supposed to be the hidden secret of the great enmity against Israel, God's people, representing the King of Heaven on earth. God's relation to Israel, and Israel's loyal adherence to God, was a thorn in their side. Where is your God? How is he superior to all other Gods? Did he not perish, when his House was destroyed? Is there a God, whose believers are defeated, and whose people are exiled? Could an almighty God suffer his city, his temple to become a prey of flames, his adherents the victims of a foreign sword, and the survivors of that catastrophe the exhibits of the slave-markets all over the world? Christians adapted and developed these pagan taunts by asserting that they are the true Israel, God has for saken Israel, moreover they never have been God's people, by the deed of the calf they broke the divine covenant. To the heathen mind the national misfortune was a proof of God's weakness, to the Christian a weapon in their propaganda that Israel is rejected by God, and his love and grace transferred to the New People. The Apostles of Love found out that God hates Israel. They never will be redeemed. God loves the nations of the world, and finds no pleasure in Israel. Israel has to assimilate either with pagan, or with Christian Rome. Both stretched out their loving arms to embrace the Jews. Many succumbed, yet the old remnant kept to God. Thus, the blackening of the Jews goes on for many cen turies, with greater or lesser force, to this very day. We hear: "The Jews are idolaters, immoral, guilty of bloodshed, robbers, they are the descendants of Egyptians, lepers, despised and low people, never of any use to the world, enemies of law and society, an obstinate, stiff-necked race!" This catalogue of misdoings and faults on the part of the Jews is much longer than could be copied in this place. It is most instructive for the inner relation of Juda ism to Christianity that the latter is styled by the same title, as is used for the pagans by early writers of the Church as well as by Jews. Both appeared to the Jews as the nations of the world. Christians were no longer in the eyes of the Jews the small group of Nozrim, or Posh'e Israel, they became estranged</page><page sequence="64">204 A. MARMORSTEIN [64] altogether. Further it is to be noticed that neither pagans nor Christians attacked the Bible as such; the former, with very few earlier exceptions, out of indifferentism, the latter out of venera tion for the sacred texts. This was left to the Minim, whose interlocutions engaged our attention in the first chapter. (f) In conclusion, a few instances of the Diatribic form of אל תתמה, "do not wonder," may be given. It is used when the preacher indulges in depicting miracles, or repeating legends from the pulpit. There must have been critics among the audi ence, who by shaking their heads, or faint smiles, showed their disapproval. For instance, when describing Moses' endeavour to find Joseph's coffin. He was directed by Serah, the daughter of Asher. Moses took a pebble (צרור) cast the same into the Nile, and the coffin came floating to the surface. There may have been a stir among the hearers, and the preacher uses אל תתמה to alleviate their surprise and amazement by repeating the story of II Kings. 6.6.58 R. Levi teaches in the name of R. Simeon b. Menasya that the heel of Adam darkened the sun;59 and adds אל תתמה, a man who makes two bedchambers (קיטונים, κατών), one for himself, the other for his houshold, which will be more beautiful? the latter or the former? Surely the former! Adam was created for the service of God, the sun for the use of man. R. Berechiah expounded the irrationalistic doctrine that So lomon's temple was not built, by human hands, but it was ready-made. Even the stones came from great distances, and placed themselves in the layer (6 ,דימוסημο$). This strange teaching, naturally, provoked amazement. Thereupon Dan. 6.18 is quoted. Are there stones in Babylon? Certainly not, but a stone flew from Palestine and settled itself on the mouth of the pit.60 These, and many more instances, which can be adduced,61 prove clearly that the statements of the preachers were not accepted on their face-value, but criticised.
